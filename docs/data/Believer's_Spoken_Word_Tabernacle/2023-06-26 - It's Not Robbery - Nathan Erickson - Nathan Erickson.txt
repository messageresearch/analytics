every time we get to be with you and so I hope it feels just as natural and comfortable on your side we just love you so much in the Lord and thank God for the relationship that we've got amen as sister churches in this area so we just say God bless you amen appreciate the invitation to fill in for brother Samuel I don't know if you've been uh streaming those Services there in Australia but I've been I've been keeping track of brother Samuel over there so far and it's just been phenomenal phenomenal and the Lord's really using him and those are really special people to me and brother Ronnie we were there last year so so glad brother brother Samuel was able to go and be a blessing there so we just want to be faithful to uh to to share the burden here at home and instead and and uh and want to be a help today amen by the grace of God let's go to the word in Philippians the second chapter say God bless you amen appreciate it don't we appreciate our musicians song leaders amen we appreciate this atmosphere you know Philippians chapter 2 verses five to eight of course a very familiar very powerful passage of scripture to the Bride of Jesus Christ where the brand will take this text in the in the messages the Mighty God unveiled the unveiling of God there in Jeffersonville and and [Music] it has a special meaning to us amen so we want to take our text here Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God that form is the word morphe he's and morphe God and morphe thought it not robbery to be equal with God he thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man now that fashion that's like the word form but it's a different it's a slightly different word that's the word schema schema which is be the figure or the shape amen so we have we have we have the word morphe and we have the word schema here in the Greek and so being in fashion of a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross will read verse 9 as well therefore wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name as we're praising him this morning a name which is above every name so my title I want to take out of this scripture this text preached to you it's not robbery it's not robbery amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord how we love you this morning Father we love your word we love this message Lord and father the enlightenment that you sent amongst us Lord by divine revelation to see who we are father to see you in more faith today Lord Lord you you've not changed your nature you've not changed your power you've only changed your mask today Lord and father you're the Mighty God that was above us the Mighty God that was with us but now father the Mighty God is in your people we believe father and so Lord that's what we're trusting in today Lord we don't have any ability we have no thought of human ability in ourselves father we are helpless Lord but not hopeless father for you are our hope of glory Lord you are our ever-present help in the time of trouble and I just pray Lord you just come in a special way today Father Lord even in the middle of human weakness and human Frailty father by your anointing Lord may we just break through into Supernatural Realms Lord may you reveal a little more of yourself to your people father may we feel a little more secure Lord in our position in you Lord at the end of it all we pray Lord we commit ourselves we commit this service to you Lord may you anoint speaker and hear alike I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you as you're seated this morning amen just to take a few moments on laying a foundation here brother Brandon preached the messages out of this scripture the Mighty God unveiled the unveiling of God talking about this this uh concept this truth of God and morphe God and morphe now we don't believe in many gods or three gods or two gods or or a multiplicity of God we believe in one God Amen for Lord thy God is one God he's one nature one force one person he he's One Life he's one amen but yet that one God will manifest himself in many different ways he has many different titles he has many different names he he wears many different masks and every time he changes his mask he's not changing who he is but he's changing his form he's he becomes God and morphe in a different mask God in morphe and Moses it was God in morphe in in in Elijah now God in Moses didn't look look like God and Elijah didn't do the same things as God Elijah but it was the same God is that right and so it's not a different person but it's God changing his mask that's what that word means and so so that that that morphe it's a very powerful word I don't think it's really captured in the English word a form being in the form of God it's it's uh it has a real powerful meaning to it this word morphe because we read the other word fashion that's that word schema that means the figure it means the shape it means when you look at it it looks in a certain form when you saw Jesus Christ when you looked at him what did he look like he was in the fashion of a man the schema of a man you saw Humanity you saw Frailty you saw weakness you saw Simplicity and humility but that doesn't that doesn't capture who Jesus was that's just what you saw that was just the figure that was just the shape but Jesus was God in amorphe and that morphe form is the embodiment of a spiritual Essence amen amen spiritual Essence when you when we look at Jesus Christ and we see him and we see the things that he did and hear the things that he said and look at his actions and look at his nature then what we're finding is that the spiritual essence of who God is was embodied in Jesus Christ and so he took the form of a man amen but in that form of a man it was more than a man it was God revealing himself through what we saw as a man is that right amen so God in morphe is very very powerful Concept in the Bible in John chapter 1 John begins to explain this concept he says look he said no man has seen the father at any time our God's a great mysterious and scrutable God he's above us he's Beyond us nobody there's no man that could wrap his mind around to understand who that God is but then John you hear the passion in his voice as I've preached many times when he says look but the word that was with God the word that was God Amen became flesh and our eyes looked at him we beheld him we could hear him we could touch him amen what a beautiful thing that's what God and Morphin is God and morphe is god making himself understandable a god you can't understand but he makes himself understood now now you can't demand that from him you can't you can't ex you can't uh you can't claim that from him force that from him that's God humbling himself by Grace it's God showing what's the desire in his heart because if God didn't desire to reveal himself to you and I we would know nothing about him amen we would have no clue we would have no understanding amen but God makes himself understandable Paul explains this in Romans 16. now he says to him that's a power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began so there's this great mystery that's that it's been a mystery it's been mysterious it's been misunderstood it hasn't been grasped since the beginning of the world Amen but now Paul says it's made manifest amen and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God is made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith amen so there was a mystery in God Amen there was a mystery in God nobody knew who he was but then by profit by prophet he begins to deal with his people we didn't as you've heard this from me before excuse me for repeating myself but we didn't know that God was a Healer amen until he manifested his healing and then we knew he was not only Jehovah he was Jehovah Rapha is that right we did not know God was a provider until Abraham felt a need amen and Abraham had a need that he could not supply himself amen so God provides a ram and by that provision we find out this is not just God it's God jairah Amen God my provider amen we didn't know all these things about him until God by his continually humbling himself continue really manifesting and revealing himself and changing masks and changing Mass God unravels all these mystery of who he was amen so once it was a mystery but in Jesus Christ Paul says it's made manifest amen and so that's what motivates God that's how we understand God is that uh not that we can truly understand him he's so great but we understand how he deals with us because his desire is to reveal himself that's his desire that's God's drive that's God's motive is to is to reveal himself that's what he wants amen so what does he do he keeps changing his mask he he changes mask he changes mask and he's playing out this great drama what is all this world about and all the all of human history and all these things what's it all about It's a drama amen amen God God God God loves a drama it's it's great story that's unfolding it's a romance amen how that God is just unfolding the secrets of his heart through this drama and he plays every part and he manifests himself and he changes mask and change his mask just like brother Braham said you could have one actor amen and you know one minute they're playing they're playing a a a Macbeth and the the other one they're playing you know King Lear or whatever but it's the same actor but they change a mask and they become a different expression amen but it's the same drama it's the same story right we know these things brother bran said he changes his mask he changes his act but he doesn't change his disposition amen I'm the Lord I change not amen he doesn't change his nature he just changes his mask from one to another and he does it why you say why he does it to reveal himself more plain to the people that they might know who he is and they might know what he is isn't that precious brother sister what's this whole thing about it's God wanting you to know him amen God wants to make himself more plain to us and that's what it that's that's the focus of this whole thing how many here know Christ this morning but you lift your hand by Grace I know Jesus Christ and he saved me and I know him and I have a relationship with him how do you think you could know who he is amen how could you know what he is amen if it was not his desire for you to know wrote right do any of us have Amen to form a relationship with God but it was God who initiated this thing no man ever sought God but God seeks man amen God seeks women God seeks boys and girls Amen to draw them unto himself and by Grace amen through through every mask through every Ministry through every member and every joint of this body he's supplying amen he's supplying this great drama he's playing this whole thing's unfolding why because God wants to know you amen and more importantly he wants you to know him hey man we shall know as we are known [Applause] hallelujah what a Perfection What A Perfection amen it's his desire it's his desire and that's something that's where we got to change our attitude many times brother sister as Believers of this message you know we we'll believe it we'll quote it we'll go to a message church we'll believe all these things but so sooner or later we got to wrap our minds around this fact it's his desire for you to know this it's his desire to reveal this to you it's his desire to take you out of whatever circumstances that you're in amen and transform you amen into the mask that he wants you to be so that he can make you amen his point of expression he wants to speak through you think through you act through you amen hallelujah it's his desire that's why he draw you out for this purpose that you might know him and he might use you amen so that someone else might know God in you amen you're the only church there is on this Earth the bride is the only true church amen you got a beautiful building here we got one in Bluffton amen we go to church we have a building we have all these things but God is not a building God is Not bricks amen God is Not boards and two by fours and and shingles amen God but but but but but he's in a a fleshly tabernacle amen it's Lively stones that God has formed he's built them up amen he's drawn each one and he's shaped them and when he shapes them what is he doing he's expressing something now you can't express this whole godhead in your body amen no because you're gonna at least need me amen we're going to need one another because we're all we're all a different masks we all been shaped different we've all been we've all been beaten in different ways and tuned amen because the great composer wants to get a different sound out of you than he does out of me amen but what's he doing he's making something beautiful he's doing a work of expression it's an artistic amen Endeavor God is taking the mystery of what was in his heart and he's making it live through God and morphe God and more face see the power of that amen God revealing himself God manifesting himself God changing his mask so we can learn something about him we didn't know yesterday [Applause] amen there's things that you you might have known this message you might have known the Lord but there were things you didn't know until you till God put you under Samuel Browning to be your pastor amen and used him to preach certain things in certain ways amen and like he uses every Minister like he uses your brother he uses your sister what is it God and morphe amen God revealing himself amen and the ultimate goal of it all is God wanting to get closer to you and I amen he wants to reveal himself to you friends it's his desire that's why it's not robbery amen that's why it's not something you know it's not something underhanded it's not something that's that's not Kosher it's not something that's not allowed it's not us you know vaulting ourselves up say well you know God speaks to me and God chose me oh no friends it's not robbery it was his desire and was freely given it's a free work of Grace you don't have to argue with it you don't have to earn it you don't have to Merit it you just gotta accept it amen it's his desire his desire for you to know it's his will God would have never made himself audible if he didn't want to be heard God would never made himself visible if he didn't want somebody to see him God would have never made himself touchable if he didn't want you on a Sunday morning in the middle of your worst trial Amen to have a way to Touch the Hem of His Garment amen and come into contact with a quickening power that can transform your circumstances in a moment God wants that that's why he made himself touchable that's why he became our high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities they did all these things that he might understand us we might be able to touch him amen that's what it's all about brother Bram said that's what the Bible has been it's been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world in a seven-fold mystery but God promised in this day in the age of the laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing amen what kind of a day are we living in brother sister it's the big reveal it's a great climax hey man what is it doing God has stripped back all the all the all the church Association all the religious tradition all the intellectual theology amen all the ritual amen all the rigmarole amen all the uh all the humanity is being lifted off in this age showing that it was Christ the whole time it was Christ in the first and second and third and fourth and fifth and sixth ages amen and it's Christ today unmasking himself saying here I am amen and I had taken up my mask Hallelujah I have exalted my I've been exalted amen I've been transfigured amen and now the light is shining not just from my face but from my whole body amen deity is being expressed in the body amen God took God Stripped Away Your Humanity he Stripped Away your past he Stripped Away your sin he Stripped Away your reputation he Stripped Away your family traits he Stripped Away your circumstances amen and took the mask off of that thing what a day to be alive friends Jesus Christ Dead He's not in heaven it's unmasked itself hallelujah hallelujah that's what the Bible's been all about that's what this Sevenfold mystery that's what Thunders and seals and all these things is all about amen it's God revealing himself Amen to show that he was not out in space somewhere he wasn't 2 000 years ago on the shores of Galilee amen but he's been here the whole time revealing himself through his church amen not just through Messengers not just through prophets not just through the fivefold ministry but through every joint every molecule of this body is manifesting his glory the light is shining from the body brother sister hallelujah amen brother Brandon would call it the condescending of God amen he takes the mask off the whole thing and we can see it what a glorious thing God and morphe masked in the pillar of fire god in morphe in a man called Jesus God oh the threefold it's threefold God and morphe in God above us God With Us God in us the kind of sinning of God amen First Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh he was handled with hands Amen brother man said God ate meat amen God drank water amen what what an amazing thought God cried God slept he was one of us amen beautiful typed in the Bible he said that was God above us God with us but now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person amen the same person what are you talking about brother brother Nathan I'm talking about this great mystery I'm talking about the the mystery Paul said the mystery which has been hid from ages and generations amen don't you realize Apostles long to know what we know prophets long to see what we see but now it's made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you Christ in you you're saying oh it's Jesus amen Christ at Galilee yes amen Christ on the cross yes Christ's on Easter morning yes but not but today it's Christ in you and that's your hope of glory you got to recognize the me the mystery today what is the message trying to reveal to you it's trying to show you that today today God is eating meat today God is drinking water today God sleeps today God cries what is it not this Fallen flesh but it's deity in this flesh expressing itself in morphe through the bride body of Jesus Christ recognize it brother he's not only one of us he's in US he is in US amen he's changed his mask why does he change his Mass every time he changes his mask we see him in a new role we see another side of him we see an attribute of him that once was mysterious but now it's revealed you say brother Nathan what am I doing here anyway I'll tell you what you are amen you are an eternal thought of God Amen you were something he envisioned in his mind before the foundation of the world yeah he saw me he saw brother Samuel he saw brother Branham but he saw you amen and you had a certain form you had a certain morphe amen that you he said he bred this one to this one amen and he bred that one and he had these two accidentally meet and get married to bring that seed line down to perfectly produce you hey man cause you I'm in our shaped a certain way that God can mask himself behind you Amen in a way nobody else can fulfill it nobody else can reveal it nobody else amen can can do it it's got to be you you are that attribute of God amen and now it's an exciting time because God Amen has collected his attributes together poured his deity into this end time bride amen and so each of you is carrying an equal commission Amen to perfectly Express the attributes of God that he placed in you that he placed in you hey man that's what it means to participate in the church amen can we can we uh can I just preach a little bit amen that's what it means they don't mean you know it don't mean just show up to church and somebody's trying to get you worked up and so you'll clap or sing or say Amen or whatever you should amen but that's not what that's not the point amen the point is you got to have a part in this thing you can't join this you can't you can't absorb this by a social affiliation amen you can't just be you can't just be associated with this you got to be born for this you're elected for this you're predestined unto abduction amen God wants to positionally place you in this many member body make you a stone shaped for his Temple so that he can put his glory behind you and shine it out to this world you got to participate you got to be part of this that's what it's all about amen we're seeing him in a new role now we're seeing him in a new form what is it I'll just say it's the bride coming of Jesus Christ amen when we see him we'll know him because we shall be like him Hallelujah it didn't appear to Paul what we would be but now I've heard but now I see now I see brother Nathan how do I really get a revelation of the message what is the message you know I belong to a message church but what's the message what is it God's trying to get across to me you got to realize that this thing is not just about what God looked like in Christ not just what God looked like in the apostles it's not just how he looked in the prophet what he looks like in your pastor but what does God look like in you that's the mystery is what does God look like you what does deity look like in Brian Hannah amen we're beginning to find out we're beginning to see it what is what is what is glycan brother Paul they're finding out because this is this or this evening light amen when God is raising up a bride to express the mysterious attributes that were in him at the beginning all down through the centuries it's been a mystery but it's not a mystery now because he's spoken it into this world and he has created us new creatures in Christ to reveal himself not through the church not through the group but through the movement through the individual not through the movement but through the individual brother brother Samuel said something at our youth banquet back in February and I wish somebody would have said to me this to me when I was a little teenager he said look look kids he said God doesn't want to give you the Holy Ghost to turn you into a 30 year old in other words God doesn't want to give you the Holy Ghost so you can you can act like you know I'm 33 he's not giving you the Holy Ghost to make you a 33 year old he wants to show the world amen he wants don't you understand he wants you yeah he doesn't want anybody else he wants you amen you were in his mind before the foundation of the world this is not some Watertown watered down you know Sunday school VeggieTales religion you're very special and amen and God loves you so much no friends if you were in his mind before the foundation of the world it's not just that we assign you value it's not that we you are treated as if you have value you are valued you are eternal life you are the spoken word of God what could be greater amen Christ in you the hope of glory it's a glorious thing amen amen see let this mind be in you you say oh deity and cheetah great mystery what a great revelation yes but let that mind let that intelligence be in you let that headship be in you let that mind let those thoughts let those words be in you let it be in you it's not robbery it's not robbery if it wasn't robbery for Jesus Christ neither is a robbery for the joint heirs with Christ amen to to to accept God's grace and stand on equal footing with our Kinsmen Redeemer and say Yes deity was in Jesus Christ amen but deity is in me this morning don't look at the flesh don't look at the veil don't look at the skin no you got to look past that to see the deity somebody say that's heresy that's heresy that's idolatry well after the way that's called heresy show worshiped by the god of my fathers amen because this is not just my god this is my father's God I'm a Seed of Abraham I'm a son of Adam amen I'm a joint Heir with Christ I'm part of this bloodline Hallelujah a lot of my father's brother Graham said and why are people so tossed he says look look you're so yielded he said that Christ is thinking the thoughts he would think you say what does me and let this mind be in you he said he's thinking the kind of thoughts he would think through you yeah he can you know you know God can be up in heaven thinking these things no but he placed you on Earth formed you called you quickened you so that he can thank those thoughts through you and he says he speaks the kind of words he would speak but it's through you and he does the kind of things he would do but it's through you now you feel there's something in the human Spirit a little bit ooh that's trespassing that's getting right on the edge of something idolatrous brother Nathan that sounds a little heretical deity me Christ in me thinking his thoughts doing his speaking his words doing oh brother brother man picks that up he says I know it sounds awful but it's right I know it's awful Jesus Christ being in the form of a man he made himself open what did he do take deity and flesh doesn't puff itself up it doesn't try it doesn't get proud it doesn't make some it's got nothing to prove amen it's got nothing to prove it's humble what is it what does this Revelation do it doesn't lift you up it puts you under the Pew say God you're trying to speak your word through me you're trying to act through me that sounds awful and it is awful but it's right it's not robbery brother sister it's not something wrong it's right it's God's desire it's what the great mystery is all about Hallelujah let this mind this froneo an inner ex an inner perspective showing itself in outward Behavior right yeah you say what's a real Christian Life is it do's and don'ts or rules and regulations no it's an inner truth it's an inside Revelation it's a personal revelation a personal appearing amen manifesting itself in outward Behavior Hallelujah let that mind be in you glory to God let this manifestation be in you God's revealing his deity through you we might as well get used to it amen because you're not gonna Escape it you listen to you look you say oh brother Nathan oh man that's heavy stuff I don't know about all that stuff after the seals 63 and after I don't know we'll go back to 1949 I think it is one of the earliest States recorded that's where brother Brown said did he's not in heaven brother deities in you [Applause] glory to God it's all about the bride amen amen you know if I wrote a message that's who I'd write it about amen my bride brother Graham said the true born-again church in this hour is the Living Word of God murder of this age made manifest he said search the scriptures see what's supposed to be in this age it's Christ Living again just changing his mask one to the other amen what is a true born-again church it's a Living Word a living manifestation it's the word for this age amen amen what's my position in Christ brother Nathan you are the word the word for now the word for today amen the word for this moment amen didn't God thank you amen well then when he created you amen the thought became expressed making you the word you are the word for this day amen the bride of Christ the word bride brother Birmingham said is the manifestation of this hour one of my favorites I know I've said it here many times amen but I don't feel Worthy feels like robbery doesn't seem fair doesn't seem just I don't feel I don't feel worthy of acting in this great drama amen but see you're not the actor you're the mask you're the mask hey man see you you just form it's brother bran said look he said ever since Pentecost what is the Holy Ghost amen what's the baptism Holy Ghost brother Nathan he said since Pentecost God's not acting in man he's acting through man amen on the shores of Galilee in the body of in that body amen that was crucified it was God acting in man but now he's acting through man amen he didn't call you to be the fullness of the godhead bodily amen but he called you informed you that he could take you amen and wear you and express himself through you amen and reveal himself in your life through your actions through your thoughts he said he's he was acting in a man then Jesus but now he's acting through man that he has chosen for this purpose then I have a purpose then you have a purpose no matter how insignificant you feel no matter how unworthy amen that you consider yourself yet you have a purpose and it was his purpose that's why he chose you he picked you up you could never picked your you couldn't pull yourself up by your bootstraps where you came from amen you had no way to get out of that you could not even control amen your own flesh your own actions your own attitude it was God that picked you up off that shelf like the dust of this Earth off of you amen cleaned you up for his service amen and hid his face behind your life amen you're the mask he's the actor he's the action he's the power he's the intelligence amen it didn't say it didn't say oh you know study this message until until your mind amen is is so you until you're so intelligent so educated that you know everything Christ knows no it said let the mind of Christ be in you Amen Let It Be his mind in you not what you know not what you think not what you can do but what could he do through you what could he do through think about it Church what could he do through you amen now if you're looking at yourself you say hey there's not much I could do and that's true but what could he do what could he do through you you got to make it personal this morning you got to make it personal amen he chose you for this purpose he knows the purpose he knows the action he wrote the play amen amen he he he he he knows the end from the beginning hey man he knows just how the plotline go he knows when it gets to when it when the suspense is supposed to build he knows when there's supposed to be a resolution he knows when there's supposed to be a conflict he knows when to send us a tragedy he knows how to form us he knows when we got to go through the fire he knows when we need to be on the hilltop he knows when we need to be in the valley he knows how to tell the story amen he just wants somebody to heal themselves and say God look through these eyes work through these hands think in this mind use me Lord take me I'm an empty vessel for you Hallelujah he talking about he begins to explain his spoken words The Original Seed about God and the father God in the son God in the Holy Spirit he said it's all the same thing it's the same God he said it's three offices or manifestations I like this of one God in action it's one God in action and he said and God and his people today it's God In Action amen it's got an action God and his people is a god of action you can expect it friends you we don't expect to sit around for 50 years and never see God do anything amen never see anything Supernatural never see a miracle never see God use somebody friends God in his church is God in action Hallelujah Satan doesn't fear the word till it's put in action he's not afraid of it until it's put in action amen you can quote the word read the word preach the word Satan doesn't tremble until it manifests itself amen but when it's manifested when it's puts into action that's when Satan gets scared amen you can pretty oh is he preach this message till you're Boo in the face amen but just preach God in action one day preach Jesus Christ is the same today as he was yesterday you can preach about what brother Branham did in the prayer lines you can preach about how how uh the apostles and the Supernatural and and Acts 2 and you can preach all those things Satan don't even get out of bed but preach to that Jesus amen is in action today and he can do the same things in this church this morning through these people and this preacher oh Satan comes out of the woodwork hey man that same gets scared that's when you you begin to preach a message in action amen they'll label you everything oh you're preaching oh that's Pat that's Pentecostal that's Wildfire that's fanaticism that was for a bygone day amen because Satan hates to see the word manifest itself he'd rather us all join a nice message church amen and just every Sunday swap quote and talk about how we were in brother Brandon's meetings and talk about how we got the Holy Ghost 50 years ago and talk about you know my brother's uncle's cousin's nephew saw a miracle you know France amen that's not what this is about amen God is not still today God is the drama is not in it's not intermission time amen the story is still being told but it's but he's changed his mask and when he recognize his mask and you see him in action Hallelujah this message can't just be a bunch of intellectual conceptions and swapping Revelations and trying to explain everything and show someone else spiritual amen God did not send a message to write a 23rd Book of Revelation amen it sent a message to write another book of Acts amen it's the acts of God in the pride God In Action in you and in me hallelujah it's not robbery friends don't let anybody take that from you don't let anybody no matter how intellectual they sound no matter how many quotes they can quote and how well they can explain it away don't let them take God In Action out of the church don't let them take a real a living God out of your life don't let them take God out from behind the mask it's a message for this day it's the light for this day Brother Band preaches about many times talks about that Great Train Robbery I bet Great Train Robbie in England or somewhere what did they do it was by a false light they put up a flashing light and it stopped the train and so they were able to board and steal millions of dollars you know decades ago hey man it was the greatest robbery amen well brother Bram says look he says the greatest robbery today is somebody who will put you under the glare of a bygone age amen try to put you in some past time amen put your mind in some in the past and what God used to do or what he will do someday that's the glare of another age friends but there's a light for now and it's a green light the move is on for the bride that's the saith the Lord God is in action [Applause] hey man hey old brother said they say it's all right for the apostles but it's not for us amen that's a glare Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe it'll be an action Amen to all the world then what's the matter he said they're walking in a glare and it's caused the greatest robbery it's taken Christ taken the Christ from the church amen how can Christ manifest himself in a word that's promised today by some cold Creed of yesterday he said it doesn't warm the seed he said it's the church's greatest robbery amen and to think all over this world today and even in message churches amen the greatest robber amen Satan himself amen has slipped in and taken a living God from among the people and put it back 60 years ago or two thousand years ago or a year ago or last week friends don't be robbed don't be robbed amen Christ is in action today he wants to reveal himself here in believer's spoken word Tabernacle he don't just move a true word Tabernacle thank God amen he don't just move here they are in this ministry or that one no amen every joint supplies but looks out as he said it's the greatest robbery to take Christ from the church what did Jesus you know we uh we get so pharisaic in in just obeying the message and having the right lifestyle and all those kind of things Jesus rebuked him amen he says your tradition it made the word of God another fact it wasn't even that they weren't preaching the word he wasn't even so much rebuking their tradition we got Traditions don't we we're here on Sunday morning we didn't get to we didn't come to church on Saturday we don't come to church on Monday amen we don't come at 2 p.m we come at 11 A.M or 10 30. amen we have it we those are Traditions you see Jesus wasn't so much rebuking the Traditions if they were if they were harmless Traditions but he said what you what happened is your Traditions made the word of no effect you didn't crucify it wasn't they were trying to crucify the word but they crucified the effect so what's the difference France amen what what does all our religion our tradition our intellect our quotes our doctrines do for us if there's no effect he's got to be an action he's got to be an action amen don't be robbed brother bam said that with that cold Creed of yesterday that false glare it doesn't warm the seed it doesn't warm the seed the only way to see germination the only way to see young people getting born again the only way we're going to grow the only way will bear fruit amen is preaching the message as a current and living reality [Music] today God is in action today God is revealing himself today the son of man is speaking amen today it's going on Amen you know and it's so simple you'll miss it you'll miss it if you're not careful we're always treating ourselves like 11th Hour workers well you know Peter did and brothers did and you know the ministry does but I'm I just got here you know I just I've only I've only been born again for a few weeks I'm brand new to this church you know I I I came in too late I'm too late you know uh God can't there's there's no time for God to use me there's no ability for God I'm just I'm an 11th Hour worker amen but the Bible says that the 11th Hour worker gets the same wage as the first worker hey man what can you expect for your labor what can you expect for your sacrifice what should you expect in your life in the ministry God has called you to fulfill you should expect nothing less than the Pentecostal wage the baptism of the Holy Spirit filling your Tabernacle and manifesting deity in your life that's your wage that's your right amen this thing is Union controlled Hallelujah amen see amen you're not treated lesser amen you're not you're not diminished you're not you're not some lesser Christian that can only talk about what God used to do you're an 11th Hour worker right in at the end God brings in a ship you know what God does he actually Saves The Best For Last he does Amen you might not think it but it's true amen see the work is great brother Jesus said but the laborers are few hey man could I slow down on this on this thought for just a moment amen I just want to share something from my heart maybe it's not even on topic fully but you see the work is great but the laborers are few and that that's what we what we lack amen we're not lacking in potential the world is not lacking in hungry people amen who are longing to have somebody show them the light it's not lacking for Darkness it's not lacking for need it's lacking for workers amen somebody will say Hey you know I could get in on this 11th hour and I can do something for the Lord I can be effective I can reap a wage amen amen the laborers are few brother Jesus talked about a good shepherd He said he gives his life for the Sheep he said but a hireling he doesn't care first time trouble does he runs why because he doesn't own those sheep so brother so Jesus said he's a thief and a robber amen a thief and a robber that's somebody who they just don't care enough to be invested oh but but see there's a Good Shepherd over this message he cares I mean is it the church you belong to is it the life that I grew up under or is it your cause is it your labor is it your work is it your calling is it your destiny amen you got to join this cause you know we've had a lot of employees a lot of hirelings we got lots of employees we need some workers I remember one time it just stuck with me it really struck me it was one of those times it wasn't like now but it was one of those times economically where where uh uh there's unemployment rate was high and everything and everybody's saying there's no work there's no work you know not like now there's jobs open everywhere but but at this particular time everybody's saying there's no work and somebody said you know everybody says that you know there's no work there's no work they said but you know the streets are falling apart and the bridges are crumbling and people are sick and dying and and there's children not being taken care of and there's all these all this need in the world they said never say it's no work there's just no jobs there's just no jobs and never confuse work and a job and friends don't ever confuse a Ministry and a position and think well I'm not a deacon and I'm not a song leader and I'm not a preacher and I'm not a pastor amen so let them do their job and I'll just sit up and amen and uh and and entertain me if you can France we don't need amen a bunch of employees amen just just to sit around amen and get an unjust do we need workers you say but Nathan the rapture's coming tomorrow brother said if the Raptor's coming tomorrow I'd be up on my roof amen hammering a nail I don't know what you got in your hand brother sister amen you not you might not be a preacher you might not have a set of notes you might just have a hammer you might just have a broom you might just have a kind word amen amen work cause if you'll make this message amen there's a wage that you will reap and it's not a lesser wage but it's a Pentecostal wage it's an Acts 2 age it's the Apostolic Pentecostal blessings which is the confirmation of the Resurrection but it's in you friends amen you're not supposed to be an entry-level Christian amen you're not supposed to be a part-time believer amen but you see Equity has been restored by this word we received the apostolic blessing but don't make it the glare of another age amen this is not this is not it's not about Christ in Peter not about Christ and Paul amen it's not it's not about Christ in Azusa Street amen this is Christ in you it's not a Pentecostal age it's a bright age it's a bright age so there's a bride wage amen don't tell yourself how don't let Satan rob you don't live below your privileges you're the Bride of Jesus Christ everything the word speaks of him it speaks of you you got a wage amen you've got a right you got something to earn friends not by your Merit but by Christ in you don't let anybody rob you Christ is in this bride she's bone of his bone she's flesh of his flesh you think about that the Bible says he doesn't share his glory with another so how could it be Christ in you the hope of glory amen well I'll tell you it's a mystery when the two become one and he's not sharing his glory with another amen Christ in you glorifying himself amen that's not your glory so it's not robbery but it's Christ glorifying himself through you shining that light through you amen he doesn't share with anybody else what does that mean it means she's him you're him you're identified in Christ Hallelujah something sometime the veil's got to be torn to you Amen to look in there see Jesus Christ face to face boldly enter in there don't you realize who you are you're the Queen of Heaven amen that's a quote you're the object of his affection you are the desire of his heart you are the focus of the word you are the Reason God raised up a prophet you are the Reason God calls fivefold Ministry a minister no matter how great he is the very word Minister means a servant who does he serve it's you no matter how great a prophet was his type in the Bible is a eunuch amen because it could not be he could not bring his own seed amen we're not feeding on the words of a man but the body word of the son of man has made you his Target his media he has made you his bride his Queen his beloved and is drawn you into himself that you might be identified with him amen and delivered amen from the consequences of your first birth your first husband that's dead now amen you live in him and so much greater he lives in you glory be to God Amen you're his desire you're what this message is all about don't get it twisted up friends look in the Book of Proverbs there you got Proverbs about you know it talks about foolish women it talks about evil women it talks about adulterous women yeah and the message talks about the problems with the Pentecostal denomination and the Baptist denomination and the Methodist denomination but that's not what it's all about because it comes down to the end he says but who can find a virtuous woman amen who can fight see where the passion see where the desire God's saying but where's my bride because her price is far above rubies see the message isn't all about what was wrong with denominations and what's wrong with what somebody else believes the message is God seeking a bride there is a bride there is a virtuous woman today that's your type amen her price is beyond rubies hey man you look at the you look at the uh amen how things were valued in the Old Testament and things rubies you know uh maybe it's not today we look at diamonds we look at Platinum things like that but the Bible says rubies is beyond gold Ruby's Beyond diamonds back then a ruby I I believe you could say it was the ultimate symbol of value it was the most precious material it was the most to be desired amen but this virtuous woman her value is beyond rubies it can't be human concepts of value and worth amen do not fit her amen she's beyond that she's lifted out of that Hallelujah she is his bride she's a blood red ruby and he paid the greatest Price ever shed Amen to purchase her and draw her unto himself you that's who you are to God you're his virtuous woman your price is beyond rubies amen quit measuring Yourself by human understanding human concepts of value and worth amen you got to recognize God's economy in God's economy the value is the price there's no inflation no there's no you know there's no markets there's no there's no stimulation and interest rates amen what you are worth is what God was willing to pay so you are that blood red ruby virtuous woman you are the Bro the bride of Christ you are the blood of God Amen he deemed you worthy he paid the price it was his desire that's what he thought about you that's what he thinks about me that's how he feels about his bride Hallelujah that's what he sent a message to tell us that you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man a woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect you are you are perfect how could that be true brother Nathan depends who you ask it depends who you ask if you ask me ah hey Matthew as a pastor who amen let's not go there but to him in his mind in his economy in his evaluation you are perfect you are pure brother said how could you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one [Applause] virtuous woman you are his bride we need to realize where we stand with God the Saints amen you got it we need to realize where we are it's not robbery no it's what the whole thing is waiting for you to realize who you are it's waiting for us to grasp this waiting for it to be revealed that's what brother Bram said if the church knew its position he said it will one day and then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is then the Rapture will come uh-huh when the bride realizes who she is the rapture goes amen you say brother Nathan amen when's the Rapture gonna go when I go cause I'm the Rapture I'm the one amen that he's called to be raptured out I he said I'm the resurrection I'm the life but you're me you're the resurrection you're this life you're you're bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh great man he said it amen talk to him about it amen it's not robber you're not trespassing on these things no what we're guilty of is living below our privileges not going too far with God no we're guilty of not going far enough not all the way into this Shekinah experience amen past the triple Veil past the gate the veil in the door amen into this holy of holies Dwelling Place amen where there's no other human interaction it's a man and it's God restored back to an Eden condition wish I had time for those quotes but I want you to realize this Adam wasn't a trespasser in Eden you think Adam was some upstart going around naming the animals and talking to the trees and God's like what's this guy's deal who invited you he made Eden for Adam and he it what God provided the place God planted the garden God put Adam there and it's God that brought you to the message it's God that puts you under a good passer and amen a good Ministry amen and to get this word across to you to realize this is where you belong you're not a trespasser here it's not robbery this is you this is real this is really you amen it's created for you amen God God made Adam and then he built a garden so God could come down with Adam and experience his own creation through his son amen a month or so ago we were out camping on The Boundary Waters Way Up by Canada and Minnesota there on those beautiful lakes and one night was crisp and clear and uh and and all of a sudden the Northern Lights appeared beautiful just uh so bright so so so stunning like a gay like like almost like you know the The Horizon of another dimension nobody could look at that and not be a spiritual experience you know it's just powerful to watch those things almost you because you know you just just uh Shadows almost look like Angels or something on the other side just you know just coming down out of the heavens like a ribbon like a Stairway to Heaven I'm looking it up up at that thinking you know here I'm out in the wilderness and all around these Woods are teeming with animal life millions of animals looking up in the night sky and squirrels and deer and and fish and birds you know looking up and seeing these lights flash across their vision and unaffected but God made a man God made a man position himself in a canoe soaking wet in the middle of the lake amen put him on this Earth God put man on this Earth to look up at God's creation and Marvel it takes a man to see the beauty old friends and to see the glory of this message to see the beauty of this message it takes more than a prophet it takes a bride amen it takes a son or a daughter it takes you Amen to have this flash across your eyes and Scatter the darkness off your light and look up and say I see another dimension I I'm hearing a voice I hear my theophany calling for me I see a Stairway coming out of Heaven I hear God beckoning me up to a marriage supper it's prepared for me I was put here to experience it amen there's nothing special about me nothing to separate me from the rest of the Dust of this Earth I'm just a vessel but I'm a vessel of Mercy and it is my purpose to receive store and dispense Mercy hallelujah it's prepared for you look at that wedding Parable you know Jesus said a thief doesn't come by the door he crawls in a window or something so it so the man threw a wedding and things you know and he he went to the worthy ones they rejected him amen so he said look go out into the streets get the good people get the bad people get them all and bring him to my wedding because I want to share this wedding I want to share this amen my son is being married I want to share it with everybody so just go get whoever you can bring him in the door there'll be a wedding garment waiting for him then he runs into somebody at the wedding he says hey how come you're not dressed in a wedding garment the guy didn't have an answer amen because he didn't come God's way he didn't come by the new birth he didn't come by the Pentecostal experience so he didn't get to be a part of it but friends her real highs Amen in this Parable not only have I been born again Not only was I baptized with the Holy Ghost no not only did I come by the Pentecostal prescription not only did I come God's provided way it's my wedding so who's gonna kick me out [Applause] supper [Applause] Act of the affection amen you're the one entering into the relationship don't be afraid this is your party man amen this this message is your message it's your word it's your it's it's it's your truth [Music] oh I wish we could just realize that but you know how we get we get like Esther amen where Esther just sits there outside that door and say man once I cross that threshold if I go there if I try to go there with my king if I try to go there with my Lord it could be death because I don't feel Worthy I don't feel Worthy I don't know how he'll react but she should have known she shouldn't there's something she should have been able to hold on to amen she knew if she went through that door just like you come to church you know and he just you know he made some mistakes this week and it's Weighing on your conscience you got stress you got situations things just heavy down and you just you know you know you're supposed to enter in you know you should be entering in what is it you know you you know you should be part of this service you know you know that you know that God wants to be dealing with you but you just there's all this stuff hanging on you you know if you open that door Satan's gonna be right there the accuser is going to be right there the enemy's in there yeah it's not just the king in there the enemy's waiting haman's there amen he's he he's preparing his Gallows amen but there's something she should have been able to hold on to something that must give her the courage to just take the step and that was out of all the maidens in the land he chose her friends hey man I feel not only like the lowest of preachers I feel like the lowest of Christians amen most days of my life I feel low down I feel unworthy but there's something Anchored In My Soul amen and that's a revelation the God chose me God me he did not ask you he did not consult anyone else it was his desire and it was his choice to choose me all friends so then what does the Bible say it says it used to be death to enter in now it's death to stay out it said now don't quiver don't shake Don't Be Afraid amen don't bow and scrape lift up your head and boldly enter amen Before the Throne of God and ask what you will why because you're not just an average citizen you're the queen you're his choice you're his beloved go in there Esther go in amen you say brother Nathan I'm afraid I'm afraid to just open that door I've been in this kind of halfway backslidden just right in the fence lifestyle so long I don't even know I don't even know you know there's so much to work through there's so much baggage there's so much piled up at this point I don't want to go in there I'm scared of what will happen I'm scared I might just fall apart the second I get into his presence go in Esther go in Little Queen amen don't let anything stand on your way make way for the queen amen lift up your head oh ye gates amen I set before you an open door he says come to me ask whatever you will ask for half of my kingdom it's not robbery you're half of me right now amen you're half of me come come in Esther come unto me this is where you belong say brother Nathan again the presence of God I haven't felt the presence of God so long I'm afraid all I'm afraid lightning will strike me if I if I you know if I just open that door this morning if I yield to them to that Spirit brooding over me today I'm just afraid you know I'm afraid what he'll say I'm afraid of what he'll do to me I'm afraid I'll be punished I'm afraid I'll be hurt amen I'm afraid to go in there I'm not worthy you got to realize you're tight brother sister there is a place behind skin amen a holy of holies where the very presence of God is an eternal light it never gets dim and never smokes up it's in that light man is always fresh old broken things become new and green and all of that in his presence but back then there was only one guy that could go in there that was the high priest you had to be a very special man among very special men to even peek through there and even he had to be afraid because if he got one little ritual wrong he'd fall over dead amen But realize you're tight friends you're not the high priest you're not asked to be the high priest we've already had a high priest and the high priest of our confession the Lord Jesus Christ went in and when he went in he ripped the veil from the top to the bottom and now it's not death to go in there it's only death to stay out you're not the high priest you're the ark you're the ark you say brother but I got all this he's what the wood represents amen but they took that wood and covered it with gold and gold represents deity amen don't look at your Humanity brother sister it's covered it's covered whatever you've been through whatever problems you got in your life whatever your situation is it's covered deity has covered you
