is that he's welcome here and that leads to him being welcome here this is the main this is the main reality we want him to be welcome in our lives amen welcome in every aspect of Our Lives we want the Lord Jesus to completely have his way amen I believe that uh God is so mindful of every of every need in our life you know the truth of the matter is is we couldn't make it without him and I know that a lot of times we'll say that and we refer to that but that's the truth we can't make it without him we need his leadership we need him to direct us we need the greatness of God to even help us to see the areas in our life that need his touch and I'm glad that when he comes that way you know he doesn't come come to shame he doesn't come to condemn but he comes to lift up that part of himself on the inside amen reminding you and I of who we are as Sons and Daughters of God that's what this message come to do is to make us aware that we are Sons and Daughters of God and the authority that we have you realize if a person could be sitting even here tonight or even under the sound of our voice and streaming maybe there could be something that there in behind their light life that they would be so bound with do you realize that there is nothing that can hold a child of God when you make a decision in your heart I'm not going to let this keep me here that's right think about it before those Legion of devils were ever cast out of Legion he made his way out of the Tomb a legion of devils was not able to help him or was not able to stop him from getting where he needed to get brother Bram said he heard Jesus was coming and he wasn't about to let them Devils stop him amen he got in the presence of God and we know the rest is history amen one of those days when we stand on the other side we'll greet him and he'll be able to tell us my name is so and so we'll say oh God bless you he'll say now you might have heard of me in the scripture what I was under the name of what I was occupied by Legion but this is my name who I am God is so good he's so good amen I want to uh make just a couple quick announcements uh here this evening um there is a signup sheet that we have put out there on the table where you write prayer request I'll announce it today as well as on Sunday that um that's for if you plan on attending on December 30th um the event that brother Josh way is hosting in welcoming sister Sharon and uh I know that U I don't have the address for the venue but what I do have is it's set up there uh in Parma and um I myself I plan on Lord willing I plan on going and being there I've got a drive back from youth retreat on that uh on that morning and that day so I'll probably just have to come by snatch my wife and we'll head on over there by the time I get back in on Saturday from retreat but um that's December 30th on the Saturday and um we need to know he needs to know a headcount brother Josh way does for those coming so he knows how much how much food to order and so there's a place out there for you to put your name and number that'll be attending and if you have any other questions I'll put his number on the sheet everybody okay with that I'll put his number on the sheet so you don't have to it's not me I he has all the other details with it so any questions you can talk to brother uh Josh way about that and I certainly think that it would be good that as many of us can go and support that that would be really good and um also um just uh want to remember I know different ones are traveling and we have many needs that I know prayer requests that were given here tonight there's many different needs Among Us um I want you to continue remember Sister Ruth Hoyer in prayer brother Brian and them there there as a family and with her and we're standing uh with our sister I know she's not the only one that's battling cancer uh right now there's there's many others that are battling brother Ron Spencer different ones and um we want to continue to remember them in prayer um I think that is I think that is it um also just a little update the I know the red line and all of that that was run going up uh sister Michelle Carper that red line honey am I right the red line is gone the red line is gone and so we thank the Lord for that cuz a lot of you know what that means infection was going to the heart so we just thank the Lord for that that you know that's there's been a touch there for her and so we want you just to continue remember them in prayer um also sister Anna I know that request was made as well the Lord will just continue to strengthen her and then I just had got a text here early this morning that uh for sister from Sister Doris that she is in uh feeling well she was supposed to finally have the appointment uh that was scheduled with the uh the doctor that looks at the brain and all those things like that and months out they had to schedule it but she had to cancel because being um I believe she said was positive for uh Co and so um we just want to remember her in prayer the Lord will just continue to um just move for her so good to be here tonight it's good to be in the house of the Lord and um I to me this is a it's kind of a well it's special time for all of us and um you know we begin to just kind of think of it and uh brother my son he mentioned it last night and I hadn't really gave it too much thought he said dad he was actually talking to his mom and then she made me wear later on at night and she said um how Paul had mentioned he said you know Dad he said here he said God just brought a minister out of the youth group and I said I hadn't really thought too much about that um but I know that um with brother Brian and I've watched you know with his life and I've watched amen and and been right there with him and so I I just he did did a wonderful job at our youth meeting there in in November uh the young people that are here they can attest to that he did a wonderful job and so we just want to pull on the gift of God you know I what I've I've told him I've told him this multiple times three times I told him this and you'll get to hear the fourth time right now I said when I'm there that night I said I want you to understand I'm not there to CR critique you I'm there to stand and pull on the gift of God that's what I'm here for I'm here to support the gift of God Amen and I I I told him like this today I said look I said every one of us are different every one of us we study different the way we go about our notes it's all it's different and even our delivery it's all different and you know that's the same way sometimes when we look at it as a congregation we we can uh see the different styles of delivery and God has such uniqueness that way you know over time all those things God there's a developing as we continue to yield but I believe tonight we just we've gathered here tonight not to hear Brother Brian Hannah but we've gathered here tonight to hear from God and that God would just take a vessel that's yielded to the Lord and just to speak to our needs tonight and that's that's what we want is God just to have his way amen so just just get behind and just pull on the gift of God tonight you know sure he'll be a little nervous but I told him I said if you ever lose that spot about being nervous then you probably better not be standing there cuz no matter how long you've been there still a nervousness that's there but you you learn to just trust him more and more and more but I'm thankful to the Lord for what God is doing amen so as we just welcome brother Brian here tonight amen to come and just deliver his heart what the Lord's put on his heart amen let's just let's just make ready and just pull on the gift of God for what God has for us do you love the Lord tonight man so good to be here tonight amen you got a song on your heart go ahead can we take this give the red one you Lord fill me with your thoughts

father Lord let us have a refilling father Lord tonight in our hearts Lord and we just love you and we appreciate you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's all turn to John 15:7 John 15:7 amen it says if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you brother brandham said in the message presuming I just love to read the word because I know that it's true the word is what we stay by it must always be the word of God or we'll go down the wrong road amen I just want to speak today on I had a couple titles to stay with the word but um just want to preach on the god of possibility amen if you can have your seats so what is it to stay with the word of God each and every age had a had a day where they had to to stay with the word of God in the beginning with Eve she had one message to stay with don't eat don't eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil she was to listen to Adam she had that one word but she went down the wrong road and brother Braham says if we don't stay with that word we go down the wrong road Noah had a message for his day and that was to build an ark amen God said it was going to rain never reigned before in the world but God gave him instructions how to build that Ark only Noah had that instruction if you didn't listen to that messenger of that day if you didn't get inside the ark once that door was closed brother brandham said you perished that was the day of Noah Moses's day I know there's many Commandments and many things he did but um one of the first things he did brother brandham said or um the Bible says that you must apply the token and outside of that token they didn't they were they were children of Abraham they were circumcised but brother brandom said they had to apply the token that light that light was good in that day but in that day you had to apply the token right and it wasn't on the back door it wasn't on the side door it was on the front door for all the world to see and they had to come under it they weren't allowed to walk over it stand upon on it but the word was over them amen right and I just like a story brother brandom told one time in Martin's day there was a man um that he was saying listen to me listen to me I have I I'm going to I'm I'm one of the old prophets God sent me a robe you have to listen to me and brother brandom always said watch out for that man that says listen to me all the time and those were one of Martin's students and those Bishops just kept listening to him and uh man it's real it's real weird not hearing music with me tonight but uh um but uh anyways so that man came and said listen to me there was already a messenger for that day and Martin was that messenger but there was a man that rose up and said listen to me God's going to send me a road but those Bishop Bishops just kept watching them they had to stay with that word that they were just saying H some something's not right but let let's let it play out but all of a sudden you know that man walks in with that robe and those Bishops you know that they said let's let's bring it before Martin let's bring it before Martin and see what he's he's he's got to say about it the messenger of the hour and that that student was like I was told I was told not to go before Martin and brother Braham say see there there where you are that's where you are if you just bring it before the message the message of the hour it'll it'll expose it'll expose that that falseness and uh they took them anyways and that robe just per or or vanished and that I think that's what we need to do today God has sent us a message in this hour any anything that you're seeing in your life anything that's creeping in um I would always take it before the message of the hour bring it bring it always back to the message this message is not brother brandom's opinion it's not our opinion many men have tried to rise up and send out videos and say oh this was just brother brother Brandon's opinion but this message is the the word of God but it's actually the mind of God what God has expressed in this day amen that's right and that's what Eve that's what Eve should have done in her day all she had to do when the serpent was talking to her all she had to do is say hey let's go see what Adam says about this amen bring it back to the word of God Amen and we have a message in our day Malachi 4 behold old I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the children of the fathers the children of that's our message lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen and brother brandom's message like brother Samuel was just saying before I came out here it was to lift us up if this message is is saying oh you know trying to bring you down that's just the enemy trying to keep you away from this truth amen God has never God has has never rubbed your face in the dirt he's never rubbed my face in the dirt he's always come to lift me up amen that's right and brother Brandon was to introduce the Holy Spirit his his highlight of his whole Ministry he said was the token and that tokenise Lord Not only was it it wasn't brother BR said it wasn't the chemistry of the blood it was the actual life that was in the blood and um Jesus said um these works that I do shall you do also why is that because it was the Holy Spirit in us now but brother bram's message was to introduce the Holy Spirit not an actual 2,000 years ago it was an actual being Jesus came upon the Earth John the Baptist introduced the Messiah John the Baptist said behold I send or um he said there's one among you whom you know not that's right and he said Behold the Lamb of God and right when he said that there was Andrew and Phillip that were following John at that time and in the message uh convinced and concerned he said right when uh John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God Andrew and Phillip just stopped what they were doing and started to follow Jesus Christ amen and I think that's what we need to do today amen but brother brandham said convinced and concerned said I'll have to change that part tonight and there is one standing among you whom you see not that's the Holy Spirit he's the one he makes every promise true amen so that that was the message of our hour Amen to follow the the Holy Spirit anything that that God's convicting in your life that is the holy spirit trying to get you back on track back on track with the word amen like brother brandom he saw one time he saw the church the Bride of Jesus Christ um marching in white robes and uh at the very end there was a few people that got got off Off the Mark got out got out of March amen and but brother brandham cried out and said get back in line get back in line and I think that's what we need to do tonight if there's anybody who feels like their their life isn't in in line with the word of God and they're they feel like they're they're in a backsliding condition or there's something that they may be struggling with I pray that you would just listen to uh the voice that's inside you saying get back in line amen and uh my wife and I were talking about that one time and she made a good point and and it was when brother brandom said get back in line they were still children of God it didn't make them not children of God they were still the Bride of Jesus Christ so just because you've got off the mark a little bit got off the path you're still a child of God Amen don't let the enemy try to keep you down try to keep rubbing your face in the dirt you are a child of God this message has come to lift us up amen not to bring us down that's right brother bandam said in the token the token agrees with every word see it's got to because it is the word it's the life that was in the word my words are spiritual they are life said Jesus amen amen and then that he might send back the Holy Spirit to continue the works that Jesus did the works that I do shall you do also amen and brother brandham said in the church age book if you are a true seed of God you'll hear every word you'll receive every word for your day just like just like the the children of Israel they had to receive the word for their day just like Noah they had to receive the word for their day amen they could build whatever boat they wanted to but there was only one message amen sir and God sunk every every everything that wasn't uh wasn't of Noah and I always just I always try to just use this example and um it's just kind of simple but people try to say this message is wrong or brother brandom's you know just has an opinion but I always bring it back to Noah I said can you imagine just walking with Noah and and just try to say oh Noah is this your is this just your opinion are you sure you're cutting this board right are are you sure this door should be here should this window be here should there be three floors but God had a Noah had an instruction from the almighty God Amen and and uh his his boat was the only boat that floated above the waters [Music] amen the proof of the indwelling spear was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age and he sent sent to set the church in order the evidence of the Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe and Obey it amen and brother brandom said have you ever noticed in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the bride speaks the same word as the spirit if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age amen and I pray that we would all receive that Spirit and the word that's in our age amen if like I said my my my thought tonight is if if God is stirring something in your heart I just pray you would you would just yield to that and um I'm just an example of that I've I've had this calling on my heart for many many years and I've always just rejected I've kept things in my life where you know God God couldn't use me and it it would have been a very uh a stumbling block to many but uh God's uh brought me to a place where I was able able to just yield and give my heart completely to him amen um and I just want to talk about Samson tonight and parallel with it with our lives and um obviously we know uh Samson was a Nazarite he was uh was called for a total separation from the world even his uh mother had uh to keep the word for her day the angel of the Lord says don't eat anything defiled don't drink anything strong drink alcohol wine she had a word for her day amen because the God was bringing a deliverer to Israel amen and brother brandham also said God is a separator not a mixer you can't serve God and man at the same time you're either serving God or you're serving the devil amen and U um Samson was never to cut his hair that was the word for his hour his mother taught him as as a young child and I believe all mothers should teach their children as a young child brother brandom said you're the Fifth Gospel of the home amen if you're if you're a mother and you have children tonight I just I just pray you would just uh minister to your CH your children have a life before them that's an example where they can trust you and bring the anointing and the presence of God in your home amen because there's many children that go to school have a lot of pressures in this hour and they need to come to a place not only church but come to home to be able to release their pressures of the age amen and um Samson also his his word of the day was to destroy and kill Philistines he was a messenger for that day for the children of Israel and uh Samson did many miracles in his day as we know and um there was one time when uh the children of Israel um the Philistines came after the children of Israel and uh they were wondering why you coming after us and these Philistines were coming after Sam Samson so the children of Israel bound Samson with with ropes that brother Bram said that um uh that horses couldn't even tear apart and they brought the Philistines or they brought Samson before the Philistines and uh but um once Samson got in front of those Philistines he was uh he was able to um feel those Seven Locks in the back of his head and he he began to remember what his mother told him and uh he says I've got nothing but a Jawbone to give you so I'll give it to you and he slayed over a thousand Philistines and brother brandham said that Jawbone that was laying in the desert and the hot beating Sun would should have just blown into pieces after he hit the the Philistines with an inch brass helmet but Moses or um Samson took took um killed every every one of those Philistines and made them went running amen amen and and brother brandom said the spirit of God come upon him that's what makes the difference amen and Moses Moses wasn't wasn't a soldier he's never fought in a day in his life he had a couple experiences with with a lion but uh brother Bram said he wasn't a skilled Soldier like those men but he just looked around and found a Jawbone and uh whooped a thousand Philistines and I think I think whatever God's revealing to you tonight if it's John 3:16 just take that take that Jawbone and whoop every Devil with it until God reveals something else to you amen hallelujah and also brother baham said he didn't have time to think well now I I got to pray through first to whoop these thousands of Philistines he know that God was with them there was no condemnation and I believe that's the state of the the children of God should be in that we shouldn't have you know times where the enemy is coming in like a flood and we have to pray through first of all of our sins and condemnation we should already be prayed up and serving God like we should so when the enemy does come in like a flood we're able to meet him on the battlefield and Slay Slay thousands of Philistines amen and one time in Gaza another miracle that happened the enemy surrounded Samson um when he went to Gaza and um they went out to kill him and uh he woke up in in the middle of the night and the spirit of God came came on Came Upon him again and uh brother brandom said he ripped off those Gates walked right past his enemy and carried that carried that gate and I I looked it up from Gaza to heon they said it was about 37 miles and it was up elevation 3,000 ft amen and what made the difference was the spirit of God was upon him all Samson had to do was fill those Seven Locks in the back of his head and he said he knew God was with him because why because he was keeping the word of God Amen brother Bram says when a man is in line of duty for God there's no gate know nothing can stand in his way than you Lord but Samson had one problem he was a lady he he was a ladies man brother Bram said Samson was a great man as long as he followed the Lord but what and as long as he kept God's Commandments walked with God God used him and he he did the church the same as long as the church walks with God and keeps the Commandments of God God can use the church but when the church gets off the sideline as Samson did then God can't use the church no more and brother Bram also said Samson did real well he had a good start good start and he did all right until he began to flirt and when he began to flirt he got in trouble and that's that's a lot of the things um with us today or new Believers or just uh the enemy likes to set traps for us and we we begin to flirt with the world and we get in a a heap of trouble and uh Samson he had a lady problem he and it was always with the Philistines the enemy he was called to destroy he always flirted with the Enemy and it was the women he married a Philistine woman and then in Gaza he he had another and then and finally it was Delilah and um the devil always likes to study you as well because Samson his first wife he told a riddle to the people and uh to receive garments and uh some sheets it said but is those those three or those 30 people came and pressed his wife and said get Samson to tell us what that riddle is and that woman the woman he was flirting with pressed him so great that he finally told her the r the riddle and she told his enemy and that was the same thing with Delilah um she began to press him the Bible says in judges and when it came to pass she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so his soul was vexed unto death that he told her his whole heart and that's what that's what um brother brandham said brother Bram said God or Sam gave God all of his strength but he didn't give his heart to God he gave his heart to Delilah and I just pray you would give your full heart heart to God tonight you know I I I was there just like Samson before I I could you know say quotes of the message I believe brother Brandon was a prophet I came to church but I was still flirting with the world and uh brother brandom said once also you had sales but no anchor and it was just like Peter Peter was able to say Lord I'll never deny you and he cut the high priest's ear off but when it came time of the the squeeze and the pressure Peter went off running you're one or the other and uh so when Samson gave his his secret away to Delilah Samson did all these all these Miracles killed a thousand Philistines carried those Tong gates to Gaza killed a lion and he just began to purum and brother Braham said that that's what's wrong with the the church today they they presume they're all right they have they have a lot of blessings God has answered prayer you know just like the children of Israel reain Mana every day but when it time to cross over into the promised land they didn't do it kades barnea and then they finally said okay we'll go but and Moses told them not to go and it um Moses and the Ark stayed behind and they presumed and got defeated and that's that's the problem with the church today and uh and judges he and the Delilah said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as other times before and shake myself and he wish not that the Lord was departed from him Samson said well I'll just rise and shake myself and just go out like I've always done and then when I do it God will be there I just presume he was there but he found out he was gone and brother Bram said ju and just once more Lord that's his that was that's the secret is the word if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it will be done see that's where they lose their secret yes so when Samson was conquered by the the Philistines he was conquered by the the enemy that he was supposed to destroy and uh Delilah stripped him of his power those Seven Locks that his mother told him to never cut that he was always raised to stay with that word and after they they stripped him of his power they took his sight they took his eyes out they bound his feet and they took him to to a a grinding mill and I think that's what the enemy wants to do to a lot of people he wants to strip you of your power take you off the word take you take your sight away so you can't even see where you're going bind your feet so you can't walk in the promises of God and it'll bring you to a grinding mill where you just keep walking in circles a repenti a repen of cycle but I think we we we need to be set free of that tonight [Music] amen amen bro and then um so Samson was brought before the main event brother brandom said where 3,000 Philistines were on a roof and he was led by a little lad just led by by The Hand by a little lad a man that was able to carry tons of tons of weight rip a lion kill thousands of Phil Ines now had to be led by just a little boy and that's that's the dangers of not surrendering your full heart to God Amen when when Satan takes you off that word he's out to Seek and Destroy he's not he's not here to uplift you he's not here to save you he's here to take everything away from you one thing he'll do with a life is he he'll completely destroy it it may look all shin shiny but brother Ram says I don't want anything shiny I want something that glows and that's this message amen amen hallelujah so the Philistines the Philistines at Samson was meant to destroy and kill and help the children of Israel brother Bram said what a sad State because that man was that messenger of the hour to deliver the children of Israel and now their their messenger was blind in Chains and being made fun of by the enemy and brother bam also said God never forsaken Samson it was Samson that forsake God and that's that's when we that's what happens to us God has never forsaken us he's always right here but brother brandom says you need to go back to where you left him amen amen but brother man says what was going through Samson's mind when he was walking around that that that Coliseum with those big pillars those 3,000 people just looking down at them laughing and that's what the enemy wants to do to you is just look down at you and laugh at you you come to church saying you're a Christian but there's something in your in your life something that you're supposed to destroy but Satan can sit there in church and just laugh at you and you're there with condemnation you can't worship like you want to you can't raise your hands like you want to you can't feed on the word of God like you want to cuz Samson or that that enemy is always there making fun of you but brother Bram said do you ever think while those Philistines were wondering about Samson did you ever think what was going through his mind he was thinking about all the great victories that God had given him there there was thinking of the days that was what they used to be or what they used to do what he used to do and that brother Bram said that's the condition of this age man is is always looking at what God did before and what God is going to do but he's he's missing what God is doing right now man is always thinking back to what God did and looking forward to what God will do but ignoring what God is doing see look what he's doing now he's sending to us and trying to stir us up again trying to bring us back to the path of his word amen but then that's when Samson's Samson's thoughts begin to change when he begin to think of the Great victories he began to think on is there a possibility Revenge my eyes what was Samson thinking there was a possibility perhaps Jehovah's full of love it might be possible that he would hear me oh I wish I could get Samson to wake to that tonight there is a possibility he is full of love forgiving the iniquity of his people from generation to generation showing mercies to thousands that love him and keep his Commandments thank you Lord Brother brandham said he seen his mistakes he seen his failures he began to realize what time time it was and brother Bram said you better kill your enemy before he kills you and that what was going through Samson's mind Samson knew he was blind he was chained stripped of his power he knew the enemy was going to kill him but he began to think is there a possibility and that's when brother baram says I'm going to repent he cried out there is a possibility that he could do the same amen and why was there a possibility right when Samson was captured the Bible says his hair began to grow so through that whole time when Samson was being being used of a show a show and sport that hair be to grow I've always wondered why that why why the enemy never cut his hair again but it just shows that the enemy doesn't know anything about this word doesn't know about the promises of God he wouldn't have let Jesus go and be crucified I remember brother Samuel saying I don't know if brother branam said it but when when Jesus was going up that hill to Calvary he Satan was wondering could this this be the one could this be the one but God God blinded him so that we would have an opportunity to be baptized with the holy spirit amen if Satan really knew who Jesus was he wouldn't let let him go to Calvary [Music] amen but Samson not he was blind but he was still able to feel those Seven Locks his hair began to grow and samton began to think about the prophecy I will restore say the Lord he seen Samson's hair grow it out again that was God's promise to Samson and when he God seen Samson with this promise God was obligated to Samson amen and the law of God by the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass regardless of the conditions amen restoration of the Bride tree brother Bram says regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how Unholy we are how sick we are how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue and and says give it back amen oh how we could just think for a minute forces it regardless of the conditions no matter what condition is the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with his word see it's going to Sarah had a possibility one time when those three Angels Came to Abraham when the angel said that they would have a have a child at their age 100 years old and 90 Sarah began to laugh and the angel of the Lord when she became when she came before the the angel of the Lord the of the Lord why did Sarah laugh saying in her heart these things can't be here is the possibility God would have struck her dead right there but he couldn't she is part of Abraham for our our unbelief he would have struck struck us dead but he can't we are part of Christ Grace holds us but he still has to keep his word amen God promised a child through Sarah not Hagar but it was through through Sarah God couldn't strike her dead because she was part of Abraham she was part of the promise amen same with Eve when Eve sinned she went back to her her uh husband Adam but when God Came In The Garden of even Eden trying to find them Eve should have been dead but why didn't God kill her cuz she was a part of Adam Adam's life was inside of Eve amen and God God can't kill himself and God can't kill you tonight amen but Jesus beheld him and said unto them with men it is impossible but With God all things are possible my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father gave them to me my Father which gave them me is greater than than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand but with Sam or with Samson's mind starting to change he began to feel those Seven Locks and think of the possibility and he began to repent and say Lord Revenge my eyes let me let me die with my enemy tonight and that's what it takes with any Christian tonight that's right is that you have to die with your enemy are you willing to pay the price tonight Sams has said Lord let me die with my enemy that's the trouble they don't want to pay the price of dying the lead the the story of legion of Garda Gad I'm sorry when Jesus came came to him all those swine are or all those all those uh Devils went into those swine and those people's cost and their their living went and drowned themselves in the sea and they they they kicked Jesus out of town because the the Revival cost too much it was going to cost them a little something to have a Revival they felt more at home with the devil and the Hogs than they did with the lovely Jesus and it's going to cost you something whenever you give your whole heart to God you H you have to die to self-will you have to give yourself completely to the Lord Jesus just like he did in the garden of uh Gethsemane that's when the true death took place he said Lord not my will but thy will be done he forsook all of his sonship and became a sinner so we Sinners could become Sons amen amen you must die to self nevertheless not my will but thine will be done is that your prayer tonight and brother brandham also said the veil that was in the Holy place and to the most holies was self-will if you ever want to go into the presence of God you have to die to self God won't accept any other way that's right cuz he's not a mixer amen he's a separator right amen that's right yes but Samson prayed prayed right when he said Lord let me die with the Philistines he failed but let me die you must be ready to die with the Enemy that's got this victory over you you must be willing to surrender your own ideas Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again his Fellowship was gone but there was a possibility that a prayer meeting might spark it again amen and I I was just wondering if there was anything in your life tonight anybody who's listening live stream is there anything in your life where the enemy just has you whipped has stripped your power your your eyesight making you walk in circles where you truly haven't surrendered your life to God but brother brandham said it starts with a prayer meeting he prayed the right prayer Lord Lord let me die with the Enemy and that little that little lad that was walking Samson around by the hand he said little boy let put place my hands on the post the pillars and that that that little boy types your conscience that conscience your conscience is always revealing to you what you're struggling with but just ask ask your conscience tonight place my hand on those posts those pillars let me die with the Enemy God searches through the Earth to find one man oh God when I think of that it makes my heart burn God is searching the Earth to try to find one man that'll surrender to him he's always done it but brother or um Samson just said once more Lord Revenge my eyes let me feel your your presence let me feel your power I feel your power Lord just once more renew my life fill me with your holy spirit let this enemy that's Mak me walk in circles for years any bitterness whatever it may be you know your conscience convicts you the word of God convicts you that's why it says it's sharper than any two-edged sword it cuts way deep down and exposes the enemy so if we could all just stand tonight and bow our heads as musicians would come I just pray that I I said something that was that struck your heart if you could just play something softly that's say bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I I just pray father that there was something I said Lord that just helped your people Lord and Lord we thank you for the possibility in our lives Lord the the many mistakes we've done we've had Lord and father but we cry once more tonight father Lord if we think we're all right with our life we're pretty good we're bad backsliding Lord my heart's desire is to go deeper with you Lord that you would use me in a greater way Lord reveal to me Lord what I have Lord that's hindering my walk with you Lord I pray my conscience would place my hand upon those posts that's holding up the enemy and when sson began to feel feel your power is his muscle begin to to press upon those posts as he was crying once more Lord Revenge my eyes and I just pray Lord that you would just completely Lord deliver your people [Music] Lord and just move amongst us Lord Lord the world doesn't want you because it costs too much they kicked you out and you were outside of your own church knocking but Lord I want more of you tonight Lord I open up my heart to you Lord Jesus I open up any door you want to go into father make yourself welcome in my life Lord Lord while I'm at work while I'm at home wherever I go father we're not called to be Christians here at church twice a week but we're called to separate from the world if there's anything in our lives we haven't separated from tonight Lord I just pray you would reveal that to to us Lord father we love you we appreciate you Lord bless your people tonight Lord thank you for what you've laid Upon My Heart Lord and everyone that came out tonight father father lord I Love You Lord thank you for changing my heart oh God and bringing me at where I am tonight father Lord we love you Lord we appreciate you father in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen way so you can use me I Give Myself Away [Music] you Lord I give myself away so you chist stand Lord my life is in your hands and Lord I Longing To See so that your desire R in I want to give myself away we to you Lord I want to give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away to you Lord I give myself away so you can use me Lord take my heart take my life as a living saice and all of my dreams yes all my Lord I place them in your hand I want to give myself away give myself to you Lord I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away oh unto you Lord I give myself away so you can use me my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you Lord my life is not my own to you I belong Lord I give myself I give myself to you oh for my life is not my own Lord to you I belong Lord I give myself I give myself to you I give myself away oh Lord are you ready to pay the price tonight give myself away so that you it'll cost you everything but you'll gain everything the sing oh Lord I give myself away so that [Music] you oh I give myself away all to you Lord I give myself away so you [Music] me I Give Myself Away unto you my Lord I give myself away so that you can use [Music] me I'm glad there's possibilities aren't you amen I'm just thinking it was I thoroughly enjoyed that enjoyed that amen very very clear very clear you know you get the thinking of Samson you know there's a lot of decisions that he made that when he stood there at that Mill grinding he had a lot of [Music] regrets but what was greater than the regrets and the condemnation was the predestinated plan of [Music] God because no matter where Samson was at he could not escape the plan and purpose of God for his life it was God who came and found him and while he was still walking around in a circle just like brother Brian brother Brian was quoting that tonight and begin to think about Jehovah is a god of love God began to visit him and in his mind he made a great decision to entertain the presence of God H and one little decision like that led from one thought to another thought to another thought to another thought to another thought that's just what brother Ram told us he said if you can go back in your mind first where you've fallen from then look to the Lord and repent and he'll take you back there in reality Hallelujah H that is I tell you this is how I believe this [Music] message that I believe that God's not just the god of Second Chances God is the god of chance after chance after chance and opportunity and [Music] opportunity because there's many through the scriptures there's many down through that we could look at that yes if we would just look at it you would think well there would be rode off but it just goes to show the depth of God's grace is so much greater than what you and I in our minds can e them fathom I'm glad he never gave up on me I'm glad I think what the Lord is I know what he spoke to us here tonight it's things were very very simple in that it's to evaluate our life if there's any if there's anything that's come along any trap that's got you going in a circle if you see things returning in your life the way it was before then you need to realize I need to get back in Step amen with God that's right because remember like the scriptures tells us when we're healed and we're delivered what did Jesus say and brother Brandon would repeat it over and over go and sin no more yes less to worse thing come on you because once God's presence has moved to bring release to bring deliverance keep walking with him but anything that gets out of step and when we get out of Step see God's faithful as a parent he's he's not like sometimes us we can our kids can kind of learn how to pull our strings a little bit here and there I don't care how how strict you are or how staunt they can kind of learn but God ain't like that God will he pulls back his presence and the way that he pulls back his presence is really it's not him leaving us it's us leaving him but you know what all it takes is just one moment one decision one moment right now to say Lord I want to go back to that reality and go on that's my desire you see Samson and and I'm not I'm not here to preach after it's just I could preach but there's just some points that I have wrote down here that just I thought about Samson Samson at that time you know he had become so dependent on the spirit of God he'd show up on Thursday come under the presence of God man how wonderful the presence of God is then he'd go right back out Sunday afternoon Monday Tuesday and he keep on going everything that he was already doing but he we got to counting on it was almost like a high he could walk in if he felt like it on Thursday or felt like it some other day he just come under it's almost like a high but he was under the spirit of God and it wasn't Samson that defeated those enemies but you know the greatest enemy that needed to be defeated was Samson right when God got all of Samson then he could destroy all the Philistines and I don't know about you but I just don't want to kill a thousand I don't want to just kill a 10,000 I don't want to just kill 20,000 I don't want to just do a part and have just a little bit in my life I want my life to be so full of God until it's all in his hands amen I thought that just so many things just striking there tonight on that and Lord amen it's a god of possibility amen wasn't that good tonight am amen it was it was real good tonight amen and I'm thankful to the Lord we can we can leave from this place right here and we go with a reflection in our hearts and what matters is what we do with what we've heard from this moment let's value his spirit and say Lord whatever it is where the Holy Spirit has dealt with your heart brother Brian referred to it entertain him with a prayer meeting just take it before God in prayer and say Lord I don't want to keep walking this same path and this same way time and time again I want to go on I want to go forward I don't want to just be anointed Lord but I want it to go to the depths of my life I want to go deeper and you watch you you invite the Lord like that as we do that he'll come he'll come if there's something you feel brother BR said it like this with Samson he said if you feel there's something you're tempted awful bad he said you overcome come that thing a couple of times he said and you watch God calls a testimony to Blossom out of that area of your life you say how to overcome it by the word you take the word and you stand on the word and you're getting stronger and that devil that's saying boo is starting to get lower you tend on the word you're getting stronger and the enem is getting less oh my [Music] um that was good that was good amen I I had enjoyed [Laughter] myself amen God is so good and those that were streaming on the internet and those who are archived I tell you I believe we want to see more victory in our lives we want to see more victory in the house of God more victory in our homes this is where it all begins a real real honest reflection reflections with things say God anything anything that's a hindrance I just told the Lord here in the office earlier today and I was praying I said Lord if there's anything in me that's hindering you from moving any deeper make it known to me not only forgive me but make it known to me show me teach me and you know I can tell you this right now he has continued to do that he has continued to do that in my life amen I want him to continue don't you I want to get I want to be closer I want to be more like him amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you tonight once again for your mercy and your grace Lord father truly over and over through the scriptures we can see that it's you Lord that comes the god of possibility Lord we certainly Lord want to receive of that Grace tonight Lord those of us that are here those that would be streaming those that would archive Lord our hearts desire I pray that oh God that may the spirit of God just moving deeper may we become more of Channel Lord in your hands Lord I pray that father that you would just go with your your people tonight watch over those Lord that have a ways to travel Lord I pray dear God for brother Howard sister Darlene sister Ashley Lord just been so good to have them here with us Lord we pray for the different ones Among Us Lord that are are sick and dealing Lord with with different things of sickness I pray that God you would Minister to them Lord we ask that Lord that as the word as we depart Lord from the presence of one another but we ask that God May in that simple Simplicity Lord we asking and directed to those pillars if there's anything at all that would be hindering Lord May the spirit of God just direct us Lord to that area because we want to see more of you Lord help us tonight I pray Lord we thank you Lord for dear God brother Brian thank you Lord for the burden that you've placed Lord upon his heart Lord I pray that you would just bless him Lord God richly Lord we love you and we thank you tonight father we just give you all the praise honor and glory in Jesus name amen and amen amen amen God bless you we let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord for I spoke a word you were singing Over Me Oh you have been so so good to me
