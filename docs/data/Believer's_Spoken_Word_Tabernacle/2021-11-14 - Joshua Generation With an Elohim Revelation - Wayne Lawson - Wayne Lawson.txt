there in genesis 14 a lot of kings that were around king of sodom and all the rest of those kings but abraham by being a seed of god was drawn [Music] to melchizedek and melchizedek had come there because of abraham and you look abraham and melchizedek had a meeting right in the midst all of that was taking place temptations were being given i'll give you this i'll give you this i'll give you this remember abraham in the midst of all that he said i will not take even a shoe legend because my motive and my purpose is for god so he surrendered all to the king just a wonderful atmosphere here this morning in there amen and i say this morning if if if you don't know that god this is what the atmosphere it's god himself he inhabits the praises of his people and that same that same presence that same liberty is not just to be here at the house of god but it's to go with you in your life no matter what what situation no matter if you're you need to get your life really right with god to get it surrendered that's a liberty that's here this morning that you can lay everything down if there's things that need to be reconciled it can be reconciled right in the presence of god that's what liberty does so that then we might walk in liberty amen it's just so good so good to be together so good to have brother yvonne and sister linda sister kylie of course not under the circumstances but we're glad to have you all we want to continue to keep them in prayer and then them and the family brother yvonne and then they just lost i don't want to say lost because i don't like to use that word i'll just say their mother has went on home to her reward and soon we'll be catching up we don't lose when someone passes away we don't lose them we miss them on this side but we haven't lost nothing it's just they've just gone ahead and they're already ahead you know it's like a family reunion many times you know sometimes you have a family reunion you get people if it's going to be their saturday you get people to show up on thursday is that right they just want to get a head start on everything and i just that's what i believe when it comes to saints just crossing over they're already gathering there and then you know how it is by the time you get there and people start coming out the house there's more people coming to greet you hallelujah oh my amen we want to continue just to remember different ones different needs and prayer it's just i'm thankful that god allowed brother wayne and sister chris and them to be here this weekend with us and appreciate everything how that the lord just uses brother wayne i appreciate his surrendering knowing that not only when you see that brother wayne ministering it's behind every good man there's a good woman and so sister karissa and the family supporting that standing behind how god would use the gift and we appreciate that and and i really appreciate sister bethany i told her last night i said you you can't just sing one you've got to sing at least two and she sang two of my favorite songs course she sang a favorite one last night and maybe it's just every time she sings you just but you know what i appreciate anointed singing singing i just appreciate anointed singing singing that comes out of experience and i really appreciate that and and man appreciate her and and brother isaac hatfield and for those of you don't know they've they've tied the knot back in august and they're officially married amen and we just want to say congratulations to you all amen we're hungry for the word of the lord aren't we i just believe that god has everything that we have need of no matter where we're at no matter what we're going through no matter what it is he has everything that we have need of and so let's just let's just look to the lord as we just invite brother wayne just to take his liberty this morning just god move and god god lead and guide our brother and remember brother wayne is he he could study and he can have a direction for what he feels right now to take but when he gets here and gets under that anointing and that channel and the polling starts taking place all of those things with with a minister and as a minister goes on with the lord and years he just learns to follow that anointing that leading because it can go right away from where the notes or the channel and he may not get to where he thinks he was going to get to but it's where god wants him to get to because the ministry itself it it's not about a message being delivered per se it's about god coming and meeting the needs of his people and that's when a message has really been conveyed because a person can preach a message and not yet preach a message but when god comes in and delivers it god comes to minister to our needs and aren't you glad that god just doesn't operate on the highway he'll come down a little street he'll come a call to sack god will come down a dirt road oh i'm glad aren't you glad for that let's just let's just invite him amen let's just invite him just to draw near whatever the need is this morning let's just invite him to draw near amen so good to see each and every one of you brian

is certainly an honor to be here in the house of god with your children lord with the grace that you have given in this hour lord now we're asking you lord that you would give us a divine direction this morning lord that your mercy would be upon us we ask that you would bless your people father that you would give them strength lord that you would teach them lord thy ways we're asking you father for mercy this morning for the special needs that are here and lord those that are be spoken now lord as you would lead us today we ask you father that you would speak now lord as we yield to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and god bless you this morning amen if you have your bibles we're going to look into the book of joshua the first chapter i want to say god bless each of you it's a real treat this morning to to see you i was really surprised to see our brother yvonne today and i want to say god bless him he's certainly a good friend of ours and we've been able to travel in ecuador a couple of times with him and speak for him in his church and amen god has really given us a special grace with brother yvonne and amen and always it's a real privilege to be with our brother samuel here at the church and amen we certainly have a great and high honor in our heart for the gift that god's placed in his life amen and man we just want to say that these men the leadership of the age of these men of god that are fighting this battle they're worthy of the honor that you can give them man in the book of joshua i want to read here uh in the first chapter if we could read here in the seventh verse excuse me let me start in the sixth verse now be strong and of good courage for unto this people thou shalt divide for inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them but only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whatsoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do all according to that which is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success we ask the lord to bless his words you may be seated i want to speak to you just a few minutes this morning on a joshua generation with an elohim revelation a joshua generation with an elohim revelation and joshua the first chapter here amen i think it's powerful at the vision joshua is having that god is commanding joshua in the way that he would be prosperous in the way he would have success and i believe each of us want to have success i believe we want to prosper in our lives and we want to be successful and i believe our success and the prosperity of our life depends on how we approach the word of god when the scripture here speaks of this it says that if joshua would be strong and courageous and he would meditate on the word then the word would make him prosperous and i believe that still remains true to the church today that they would meditate therein day and night that they may observe now to think about the word that they had received in such a time that god would have an entire nation focusing on the things that were spoken by this man moses i think it's tremendous to think about how powerful the words of moses were that an entire nation would dwell upon those words and then they would worship their god through the things that was spoken by this man i think it's powerful when you see that not only were they to uh to read his words but the bible said that the law should not depart out of their mouth so it should be spoken about it should be meditated on the word meditate don't just mean to think but it means that they would utter it and muse it and they would meditate and they would devise it and they would plot it and they would speak it and they would roar it and growl it and groan it and utter it and meditate it means to imagine it means to mutter to other in other words the word meditate don't just mean to sit and think about it but it was becoming the focus of their thoughts it was the focus of their lives it was how they set up the order of the tabernacle it was how they set up their homes it was how they lived their life it's how they approached the sabbath day the orders of their worship everything that was in their life was coming from their ability to meditate and to think upon the things that moses had spoke to them now to many people of course this had to be very strange that these people were gathering around words that were spoken by mortal man it was a very strange thing to a lot of the the people in that generation and time period now you're reading moses after you know thousands of years and in a rear-view mirror this was a great thing but in that time period amen moses had just departed from the people and to many people it was just another man it was just just a man who who it had had all these problems and he didn't speak well and you know there was all kinds of issues here but but see but but god had put something in the people that they had understood something had happened with moses uh in the unveiling of god brother brahm said it like this he said they seemed something happened and how he was different from the rest of the israelites he was different his message was different he was different from the priest he was different from anything he was a different person and those people seen something had happened amen the people had seen something had happened now what had happened is god had veiled himself in a prophet to speak his word to them that's what he had done moses was that living word to the people he was veiled by the pillar of fire speaking what was to be later veiled behind the badger skins that's what it see had something had happened is god had hid behind the veil of a man to speak words that would go in behind the badger skin and they would worship the words that was spoken from this man so there wasn't just words of man they wasn't just man's words but rather amen according to scripture now it gets a little strong here but thank you think of what you're thinking about now in the unveiling of god brother man said the word had to come to moses first the moses had the word and they were written by god and nobody could interpret them because moses had to interpret them first that's the reason he veiled his face do you see it here it is amen see we could pick this up we could pack it and everything else but it's got to be revealed in order to reveal it moses had to become god to the people you say that's nonsense but he told even moses himself you'll be a god and aaron will be your prophet see therefore he had to veil himself because god is always veiled moses wore a veil because god always veils himself that was god using a prophet to speak a word to deliver the children of israel and give them an order and way of worshiping their generation see god was not asking israel to just worship he was giving them order of worship he was teaching them how to worship him and not worship the god of baal or stardust or it separated nation of israel from all other nations in they had an approach to god they had they had a way they could come to god and it wasn't just the imagination of someone it wasn't just a something somebody pulled out of the air but it was god by divine order hiding behind the veil and speaking his word that they would have a proper place of worship now i'm going to use the scripture here in exodus chapter 4 and verse 16 the bible said god speaking to him he said it shall be he said thus he shall be thy spokesman of the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shall be to him instead of a god amen in exodus 4 and 16. so moses was told to be a god to aaron and that aaron was going to be a prophet unto moses in other words he was going to say the things that moses had said that would be the order of arionic priesthood it would be that they would speak the things that moses said amen and i believe that that should be the order of the ministry today amen they should speak the word of god they should say the things that had already been said amen he wasn't aaron wasn't pulling things out of the air aaron wasn't having his own ministry or his own ideas he was under an order and as long as he stayed under that order amen everything aaron said come to pass exactly the way aaron said it as long as aaron was willing to humble himself go read your bible sometimes and we say moses rod remember what it did but you reckon understand that aaron it was in his hands when it happened amen that aaron was the one that called for the plagues aaron was the one that called for the blood the water all those things were happening but they were happening by aaron through the order amen that they was under a prophet of god and i don't believe this is an hour for the fivefold ministry or the priesthood of this hour to come up with their own ideas and revelation but i believe that in this generation amen and if we can hold ourselves under the word of god the same pillar of fire that was speaking through moses is the same pillar of fire amen that is upon the church of the living god in this hour and in this day i believe it's important to see the authority that we're under amen if we're under god if we're under his authority amen then god is behind the words that has been spoken amen he is actually able amen to see the success and the prosperity of it i believe we should understand our dave i believe this i believe that we are a generation amen likened unto joshua joshua was in a season that he existed after moses had passed after moses the man that god spoke through he was now gone from the scene he was no longer there they hey man they they thought maybe that it was moses all this time their eyes was upon moses but now we begin to understand that god didn't say amen just moses but he was saying focus on the things that moses had spoke unto you amen that the words that moses spoke was what was behind the veils and the pillar of fire was over it wasn't the man moses they didn't lay moses his body back there it was the things that moses spoke because moses was only a veil that god could speak to the people amen wait a minute isn't it amazing that the revelation flows through the entire bible that god can use a veil you don't glorify the veil you glorify the words that are spoken through the veil because those words are words coming from god and they will make a successful marriage they will make a successful church they will make a successful life you've got to focus on the vindicated word that was spoken now we we look at this and i i think that if we study the scriptures and and i i'm a bible believer i'm a i'm a bible worshiper i i believe that the bible is the infallible word of god i'm one that believes from cover to cover this is god's word 66 books of it and i believe every word of it's inspired i believe every word of this is good for doctrine i believe that jesus himself said in search the scriptures and in them you claim to have eternal life and they are those which testify of me i believe this is the testimony of jesus christ i believe that the word of god is so real and true that every word of this bible will produce jesus christ if it's approached correctly you will see jesus in it amen amen and and we hold this bible it's the canon of scripture that we have but we think back about the bible and we think about and we we can carry ourselves back in scripture we can go back in the beginning of creation we can look at the things that happened in the floods of noah and we could we could we can carry scripture all the way through but but most of the time i don't think that we stop to remember that scripture was not written at those days but scripture didn't begin until moses in the days of noah or in the days of abraham or the days of adam those days they didn't have a written text that was called scripture until god gave a scripture in the book of exodus when god came and met moses and began to reveal to moses that's where the books of the bible begin amen the jewish people call it the books of moses or the the law or the torah it's the same thing you have amen but it didn't they didn't have it until that time i think brother branham said it like this moses wrote the five books of the bible the old testament of course then it said here in works at face to express both of them said they had no bible to read from they didn't have a diseases we got it amen see others who took it remember they only had it by revelation now that's the real thing see some some say uh say it by joseph in genesis there was no bible moses wrote the bible he wrote the exodus leviticus none of these characters in the bible had any bible to read from see see they didn't have it to help them in their crippled condition they were rugged men who was revealed to them by god and they stood right there and nothing could move them you think see they had that rugged faith because it was revealed to them of course we get in the season now where everybody's arguing about the absolute amen but but but you got to understand that the absolute is christ amen it's the revelation go back in the in the days of job amen or look in the days of adam or look in the days of abel abel didn't have a book to read from so the book wasn't the absolute it was the revelation it was the absolute amen and that absolute today is the revelation because you can hold a bible and hold a wrong opinion about the bible so the bible is only an absolute when the bible has a revelation that has been revealed then the revelation becomes the absolute of those people amen and i think about it today of how that god would meet with moses amen and he would bribe the bible now if you go back to the book of exodus it gives you a great example of how our bible was written that god met moses back there on the back side of the desert and appeared unto him in a burning bush now when that burning bush began to speak to him he introduced himself as the god of abraham isaac and of jacob since the beginning of the bible began with the pillar of fire meeting this man moses showing us amen that it took the pillar of fire to write this bible amen then this bible is not the works of man this bible is not just a good a good man got together and put their ideas together but it was the works of god appearing to a prophet in a pillar of fire now i think it's a powerful thing now he mentions well it don't take the pillar of fire well what about moses then i think moses is a good example amen that education has always failed amen if you if you want to think about how you should approach god then what about moses who was 40 years old when he decided he would not be the son of an egyptian prince but be recognized as an israelite he was a 40 year old man before he decided that and then he decided he'd do something for god amen but he was a prophet by birth now he was a gene seed of god he was an abrahamic seed he was taught by his mother he was an israelite and taught that he was a deliverer of that lamb and he went out and killed one man and become a complete failure and was banished 40 years in the desert because he tried to do it through intellectual power let me assure you if moses could not do it by intellectual power then neither can the church of the living god it will absolutely take amen a divine revelation of the word of god and when moses met the pillar of fire he met what he lacked in that pillar of fire and from that pillar of fire then that's how the scriptures were being written now i don't have a a lot of time to detail these things but i'll just say this amen do you recognize when moses wrote the word at what point in history he is how many stories that was existence how many things that had been told the oral scriptures or the stories from adam had been crossed down all the way to moses that's all they had was the stories they set around now now adam would have of course visited with his great grandsons and he lived to be 900 years old nearly he was he was i don't remember exact age but methuselah was 900 and something years old so the the stories would get generations it would be like you getting to sit and talk with your father's father's father instead of hearing your dad tell the story you would have heard your father's father's fathers tell the story so the oral scriptures would pass through the generations of how it was but i don't care how well you tell them hey man stories grow and and stories reduce things and and stories has a certain way of having influences of certain families or how now how the family see it wouldn't matter how you tell the story how a certain family would feel or how a certain situation would come amen but you recognize this it meant when it come down to the place when the pillar of fire met moses moses was getting the story from god how it really happened so when moses comes along and deuteronomy he said don't you add one thing or don't you take one thing from what i have said now notice this moses's revelation was superior to everything that was in front of him every story you heard every opinion that was given when moses's revelation was superior it may have been contrary but it was certainly superior to every other revelation i think it's powerful to to recognize today amen that revelation is more accurate than memory revelation is more accurate than it is amen now i i could go through here but i'll just pick it in a simple way but the apostle paul must have been sitting on the steps when jesus christ himself was at the temple and and gamalia was teaching paul the laws and the scriptures and there was jesus standing right there amen but but james and john and peter and all of them was walking with jesus amen but when the new testament was to be written and the law was to be divided amen the pillar of fire come to paul and paul's revelation was superior to every one of him and he even said in galatians though he says though a man or an angel would come to you he said if he says any other thing than what i have said let him be accursed amen he was including himself he was including peter he was including john james any of them that had walked any story that they had must line up with the revelation that paul was given he even went so far to said if any man think he'd be spiritual or prophet let him acknowledge the things that i have said unto him then real true spirituality is what a man can bring his life under the order of the revelation that god would release in that season i know a lot of people thanks to spiritual but show me how spirits you are amen how much can you agree with the spirit of god that has been released in the age that you have come if you want to see a real reality get your life in agreement with the revelation of the age you're living in him and prosperity will come to you and success will come to you and when it visits your home it will bring a blessing upon it amen now now you find out of course that that was god that appeared unto moses it was god that appeared unto paul and when he appeared unto him in the pillar of fire he separated the law from the from the from the grace and gave him a new testament do you know that the pillar of fire has appeared in this last days and it has appeared for a purpose do you know the bible promises that this pillar of fire would return to us amen that the word itself would be vindicated in the last day the very author of the bible amen promised that he would appear in the last days that the son of man would reveal himself now why would he do it he made a promise in john he said see i have some things to say unto you but i can't say them now but when the spirit of truth shall come he shall speak these things unto you amen now now that was a prophecy of the coming of seven seals jesus was saying i got things to say but according to revelations the 10th chapter they had been sealed until the day when the seventh angel began to sound and in the day of the seventh angel would be the same hour that a mighty angel would come down out of heaven he meant a pillar of fire would return at the same time a prophet was on the earth because that pillar of fire cannot come to the earth unless there's a prophet to introduce it every time in the scripture there's always been a prophet to introduce the pillar of fire amen what did it do it come to open the seals he'd come to give the bride the appropriate place of worship in an age of deception it come to bring pure authority back to the church of the living god we're not here on i hope so i think so maybe so it could be we have returned to the vindicated word of god and a supreme revelation in this hour we are not here on hope souls and maybe we're standing on the solid rock of the revelation of the word of god and if you'll stand on that rock the gates of hell cannot prevail against you the gates of hell will fail at your feet because god is given a supreme authority and supreme revelation amen it may be contrary but it's supreme it's supreme see paul wrote this new testament see what did he do he separated himself amen and went down in the desert for three years to get the revelation according to galatians he didn't go to a school he went to the spirit of god and paul separated the word now remember this god sent william branham out to tucson and he separated him even from the tabernacle from all of his friends he separated him and sent him out in the desert for the same purpose that god sent paul into the desert he also sent william branham into the desert to bring back a pure revelation concerning the opening of these seven seals now i know that people think they're spiritual but if they're spiritual let them acknowledge what god has done in this age amen now now i know uh i know it's something like you if you go back to apostle paul and you think about paul who wasn't even in the upper room when the spirit fell and that's something paul wasn't even there when the holy ghost came and 120 were filled when the holy ghost paul wasn't even in the room he wasn't even there amen but you know what it was paul that told him what they had he wasn't there but it was paul told them what they had amen brother branham likens it a little bit hey man he likens it to to uh amen of how when the when they first found lights you know he said that one of them said that he says i believe there's i believe there's power in that lightning amen i believe it's franklin wasn't it he caught the key hey man he said there's power in that lightning and he got a lightning strike to come down and he got that that power in the bottle he had lightning in the bottle amen he see but edison wasn't even there when that happened amen but later edison come along and did something with the power that franklin had found amen but paul did the same thing paul set the thing in order and told them what they had when they had the holy ghost he told them it was christ in you the purifier has come into the church and he identified the position of the sons of god by the baptism of the holy ghost and set an authority in the church and gave it back its power in the book of ephesians set the church in heavenly places by the authority of the word of god now i don't know amen i hope i have the liberty to say this i know i do with brother samuel so i pray you you're okay with me but i i'll say it i believe this with all of my heart i don't believe william branham was here in 1906 when the holy ghost fell out there in azusa street amen brother man wasn't here when the holy ghost was falling amen throughout those 30 years he wasn't on the field during that time amen but amen the power was coming but they didn't know what they had they didn't realize what had come but here comes the prophet and picks up the baptism of the holy ghost and never does away with the holy ghost but he tells them you've got the lightning in the bottle but quit blowing it out the steam pipe and put it to work amen let the holy ghost come in the church and make an action of god come in power and then demonstration hey we're not fanatics here we're not just a bunch of emotional nuts come to scream and holler we've got a message and that message is a word and there's an authority that is returned in the church again come on you know i'm telling you the truth the gentile church amen actually has an authority according to the roman centurion they understood god and when jesus said i'll come to your house and heal them the man said you ain't got to come your personal body your corporal body don't have to come to my house if you'll just speak the word there's authority in your word that has the power of deliverance and truth and i believe today that god has spoke his word over the church of the living god and set it up in authority so brother branham comes along in the message trying to do god of service and he says so say i in the name of the lord. don't you add one thing don't you take one thing don't you put your ideas to this you say what i said on these tapes you do exactly what the lord has commanded you to do and don't you add to it now i i'm not going to spare any spirits of unbelief this morning i'm not going to spare any spirits this morning is that all right well y'all if i just preach the gospel this this prophet did not say you play what i said on the books and tapes he said you say what i said on the books and tapes now if we're going to believe this message let's believe what a prophet of god said and he set the order of a church not a tape recorder in the pulpit but a man in the pulpit that believes this message with power and authority hey man i i have to share what i believe i believe that we got a bunch of cowards who won't have enough manhood to stand in a pulpit and preach the gospel of jesus christ they hide behind the tape player and let brother branham say it but i want the world to know i believe what william branham said i believe it's the message of the hour i believe enough to say it i believe enough to stand on it i believe it enough to die for it but all of heaven is behind it this is not the ideas of some man it's the return of the pillar of fire that is coming the church of the living god and is trying to take over a body it's trying to take our lips and our eyes and our mouth and our hands and our ears god don't just want your ears he wants your feet he wants your mouth he wants the gifts of god amen i believe it i believe that with the situation we're in now amen that they have so bound the gifts of god in the church and a gift couldn't operate if it wanted to i'm not talking about your pastor i know i know but i know this little church here amen this is not the hour of the restoration of gifts so that's not the focus but god has yielded vessels and if he wants to operate a gift he's more than welcome to operate a gift as long as the gift is in order but if you think you're so spiritual that you can bypass the office of god you can bypass the things of god amen you ain't nothing but a spiritual heretic that needs to come under the message of the hour if the word of god has got an authority and it's got a power and if you want to be successful get under the message of the hour and let our priority come upon your life now now one thing about it ephesians the fifth chapter we did not put in this bible it's there and don't you add to it and don't you take from it god will have a fivefold ministry that is his dress where that's the way that god comes into the church he operates through the gifts amen not just gifts of tongues and knowledge tongues is the least of the gifts what about inspiration and knowledge and faith and healing there's nine of them all you ever hear about tongues because it's the easiest one amen to impersonate any old devil can speak in tongues but it takes a real child of god to come under the word of god and submit their lives to the power of the word of god in the season we're living in we're not looking just for an emotional caring away we're looking for a change of our bodies a change of our natures hey man now now you know me well enough to know i'm i'm one that believes i'm walking the back of the pews if you feel like it hallelujah and shouting glory to god but there got to be a reason why we're doing it this is not a pep rally this is a place for the house of god where judgment and truth and anointing comes upon the church but if it's got anointing and it's got truth then it will punctuate something on the believer's heart that they'll say amen to the word of god now if you want to have church like you've never had in your life open your mouth and say amen to the word of god you'll release something in your life amen there's something that will come right into that amen now i don't have time to go into it but i could i could show you amen it matters what you say gloria i think we're going to have some church in here today [Applause] now look what is going on so say i am the name of the lord you know the modern church in its present condition cannot bring on this rapture the modern church cannot fulfill the great commission go ye the world preach the gospel brother brown said so in the visible union he said it cannot finish up the great commission in his current condition the church world cannot fulfill mark 16 in its condition because that it has denomination that is harnessing it from being a full believe in church they got to take they got to take pieces out of the bible and i i don't wanna i don't wanna act smart i don't mean to be smart but i am a little sick of people telling us we follow a man amen and they're belonging to some denomination it's a little bit heartbreaking to me they said well we just believe the bible then then just help me just a little bit amen amen just help me a little bit if you're not following a man then why is it that you'll turn down first corinthians 11 when it said a woman shouldn't cut her hair a woman shouldn't cut her hair that's what the bible said but the denomination will say something else and you follow the denomination then who is it following a man amen but but there's a bride on the earth we don't have to tear one page out of this bible we don't have to take one word out of this bible we can preach every word that's on this bible because the pillar of fire has returned to the church of the living god we're not scared of the anointing we're not scared of holiness we're not scared of the power of god when it comes to this bride you can't preach it too hard you can't preach it too deep you can't preach it too shallow as long as it's the word of god there is something on the inside of them amen preach the way brother amen let the power of god flow in the church amen it is the thing that will put the church in condition if the church can't do it in its condition and it's the commission god gave us then god is responsible to give the church in a condition it can fulfill so brother wayne what would that be brother brown says it like this he said see they're trying to do god a service without being his will but god is sovereign and people today are wondering why we can't have revival but do you believe god is sovereign the bible speaks it this way i was discussing with a group of my baptist friends not long ago and they said brother branham we can only have revival when we can take the word by word page by page and letter by letter he said i believe page by page two he said but they've been trying to do that all along he said we must find the greek interpretation of the word what the greek says i said i he said i haven't read too much but reading the history of the church pre-narcia and i see a council now i see a father's he said they were arguing back there about the greek he said that's 2 000 years ago one man says this and one man says that that's what the greek word means do you see amen people think when we get that page by page letter by letter hey man when when we whoa boy when we get it all lined up then we're going to have revival they've been arguing about the interpretation of that greek for a thousand years now brother adam actually tells us what happened he said god spoke it in a common language and they're trying to interpret it in an educated language and they're missing the meaning because the bible said the common people heard jesus gladly he spoke a common language and these bunch of intellectuals are trying to make it like he was an intellectual giant and he wasn't amen and he wasn't an intellectual he was a deliverer to god's people and he spoke a common language and the things jesus said now they're trying to take it by the greek and they're trying to bring it so brother branham turns around and he says see revival will never come till the sovereign god sends it amen that's the way it is and then he'll take some little nitwit that knows not even good english let alone greek and use him that's the way god does things he uses hey man hey man think about hattie right when god blessed her home how many important people would have liked to sing that in their home but god took a nobody and made us somebody because the supernatural god ministered in that home people people people long to meet this little woman had it right and before that supernatural was told nobody would have cared to meet her nobody cared nothing about the woman she was a poor widow woman but when god done the supernatural inner that's when she becomes special and i tell you every believer here today when god does a supernatural thing in you you're not just another people you're a supernatural people by the things of god amen our revival comes when god sends it so our revival is not denominational our revival is not intellectual our revival is a word revival do you see that's the only reason it won't end this revival of the bride will not come to an end every other revival ends in about three years look what it does it burns a little while it ends it burns a little while the reason it does it is because the life is passing through and it goes from the stalk to the husk and then it goes from the hust to the seed but once the life reaches the seed it's in a place you can hold on to it i don't know how to explain it other than just hillbilly amen go out in the corn patch in the middle of may or the middle of july or june just before the harvest starts coming and pick a stock of that corn put it in your cabinet see how long it lasts it'll rot on you because it's not in the right stage yet but when it comes to corn you can keep a carbocorn for years because the life has come to its fullness it's come to its reality and we're living in a season when god releases the revelation in its fullness it is a word revival we have come to and the word remains the same every day i don't care what you're going through i don't care the problem in your life i don't care the situation i don't care what is happening in your life if you'll focus on the vindicated word you will break out into revival any place anywhere anytime under any condition because it's a word revival and every revival has a miracle that follows it amen and divine healing sure is phil is following this bride's revival but there's a greater healing that is following this revival it is the change of our bodies this revival ends into a great rapturing revelation that will carry the church now you cannot bring this through greek you cannot bring it through intellect because god sealed it in revelation chapter 10 the seventh the sixth verse the bible said that it should be sealed god sealed it revelation 10 and 4 i guess it is god sealed this book same as he did in the days of daniel so the seven thunders according to brother branham now in the third seal he said it be the thunders that caused the revival the bride is that right then john and daniel both saw those thunders john in revelations 10 daniel in daniel 12. in both cases he told him to shut up the revelation until the time of the end so the revelation wasn't never written but the revelation was going to be given is that right and god would have to send a prophet to introduce the revelation of what daniel and john were talking about amen do you see what it is now and we're closing up but god has to unseal something to the undenominational bride so that they can fulfill the commission of go you under the world and preach the gospel you see amen i know i know people think all the times well they're preaching the gospel they're not preaching the gospel they're preaching creeds and doctrines and orders of man creating a bunch of heretics amen denominational people who say they love god and hate his word come on now i'm sorry amen but god is his word you cannot separate god from the word you you can't do it god is his word amen now when i say that i i believe then that god is actually got to open up to the church as he said in revelation chapter 22 the scripture says that that john met somebody amen that told him to unseal the book for the time is at hand so there comes a moment in scripture when the book becomes unsealed for 2000 years men probes and can't get in it because god sealed it the bride's revival was sealed it didn't matter who tried to make it but when god opens it it's open and don't matter who tries to close it when god opens something it's open when he seals something it's sealed and you are living in the generation of the unsealing of the prophecy god has unsealed the word in this generation we have had an unsealing among us listen if you don't get nothing else out of this service this morning i want you to know your revival's been unsealed i want you to know your blessing has been unsealed i want you to know your position has been unsealed it is no longer a secret of who you are of what you're supposed to do or where you're supposed to go hey man do you know perfect faith is revelation isn't it then that's why i said and rahab by faith and moses by faith and noah by faith then there's a bride by faith by a revelation of the divine will of god she can take this devil she can take this age and she can put it under her foot because her revival has been unsealed so maybe i could say it to you like this then you're blessed this morning well it really don't matter what else is happening in your life you're blessed you want to help me preach somebody tell somebody say you're blessed you're blessed this morning amen i don't care the car you're driving you're blessed i don't care the house you're living in you're blessed a blessing does not come from from things and materialism in this age amen the blessing is that you have eyes to see and ears to hear the things that god has done kings have longed to see this and have not prophets have longed to see this and has not but unto you it's been given to know the mysteries of god because christ is the mystery of god revealed come on church the revelation couldn't come to the end time is that right and there's going to be an end time people then the revelation is not effective until it comes in the flesh you are the revelation of the mind of god from the foundation of the world this is the age of the unsealing he's unsealed a pride it has authority they have his name they know who they are they know where they're going my you've wondered what that bride is this is that this is that bride this is the mind of god you just don't know who you are but if it would strike you this morning no devil no power nothing will withstand that see you've got to give authority to the revelation because that authority has to be greater in the way you think come on not just about your hair not just about your dress amen it's got to have a greater authority not about just your teaching of the doctrine but it has to have a greater authority of even what you think about yourself even even if you can let your mind come to the mind of christ and see what god intended you begin to respect what god's done in you you respect how god's using you amen if a minister can only understand the reality that god is using them for then it don't matter what anybody else says they know their position with god and that's exactly what they have to do this is the unsealing of it in revelation 22 and 10 he said seal and unseal it for the times at hand now to me that's powerful then we are living in a season of the unsealing of that revelation he unsealed it amen now nobody can seal it back oh my no matter how many people says it ain't real no matter how many people says it ain't open it's been unsealed to this bride it's been unsealed to her now look what it is amen behind those seals was redemptive rights every redemptive ride of the church has now been unsealed she knows her rights we're living in age of rights aren't we they meant even they got grandparents rights uh in-law rights child rights they got kids suing their parents for their rights you know what a crazy world everybody's eat up with rights amen but there's a bride that has redemptive rights amen we have redemptive rights and we've got a right to tell the devil that our ground has been paid for listen if you went home today and somebody was sitting in your lunch here in the middle of your living room drinking your coffee hey man you've got a right to tell them this is my house i got a title to this house you've got a right to tell them to leave because it belongs to you and listen god has unsealed the bride's rights and every redemptive promise that has been made to the church is a right that belongs to you and if satan is camping out on your rights this morning you've got a right to tell that devil you are trespassing on the things of god it belong to me you're the right to kick them out you got a right to pull them out and tell the devil i don't care where you go but you can't stay here i'm not responsible for your ride home well we might as well preach haven't we hey man i'm not responsible for your ride home i mean y'all know what i'm talking about how many times you ever give a devil ride to church come on now i think it's time to break the date off today and say you might have rode with me to church but you got to get your own ride home you got to get your own ride home you ain't riding with me you ain't riding with me back to the house you've done all the damage you're going to do i think it's time for the church to shrug their shoulders back a little bit and say listen amen i'm not being arrogant i know who i am this is not about arrogance it's about humility amen you've got to be humble enough to say what the word says about you come on now arrogance arrogance actually isn't saying what the word says about you it's being too arrogant to say what the word says because you're thinking that you're doing something yourself you can't do none of this none of this is nothing about you this is the blood of christ that bought it for you so it belongs to you but it's been given to you so there's no reason to be arrogant about it it's been unsealed for you and joel chapter 2 the bible said i shall restore saith the lord the unsealing of the book is for the restoration of a true bride if you really want to be a true bride this message is for you if you really want to be the true bride of christ this message will bring you liberty to be that true bride amen listen this is the season when god will release both the former and the latter rain now according to the prophet in spoken word original seed there's three seeds planted there's a seed of oral roberts that was planted there's a seed of billy graham that was planted and both of them are growing fine he said but then there's a word seed to be planted is that right and that word seed was to be planted by the end time messenger brother graham said the gentile dispensation will be finished with the church age and when the anointed message arrives he says he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain and then he will be rejected now people today hey man they have a lot of trouble saying well brother brown's rejected they're wondering if we should follow the message and all this but the bible says he would be rejected how many knows that how many knows the bible said that this message would be rejected you've got to know what you're looking for now but in revelation chapter 3 of the layout of seeing ages said christ is on the outside of the church do you see that christ is on the outside of the church and some people ain't even come to the realization yet the message is christ but the message has been put out of the churches because men doesn't have the strength to preach the word in the face of contradictions in the face of old heresies and old stories and old ideas that have been told they've not seen the supremacy of the revelation so they let somebody push him away from preaching it amen because see the messenger is rejected now here's the thing the message has been rejected but the seed's been planted the messenger has been rejected but the seed has been planted can i just can i just say it like this amen it don't matter how they treat the messenger the message is already here do you see what it is we can stand here today and see them it'd be like a man planting a row of corn and at the end of the row somebody comes along and hits him in the head to stop that corn well i'm sorry amen you should have dug the seed up because hitting the messenger doesn't change that he's already planted the corn amen and when the message has already been planted in the church amen the church can say satan you're too late the seed is already in the bride oh god come on church that first eve fail because satan got there before adam got there but in this season amen god got to you before the devil got to you amen that's why she's a sealed bride she's sealed to the devil but she's open womb to christ in his word she's a virgin bride she's taking the seed and we can say to satan this morning satan you're too late you're too late satan it's already a finished work the word is already in the church the power of god is already released in the church hey come on brother ma'am told us the story remember the story when the world war ii when the dove remember the world war ii story they there was a a group under attack and they tied a message to the dove's leg and they sent the dove home and the dust started flying away he said the germans shot it he said they cut its wings and broke its beak and broke its legs he said a little thing bloody he said but after a while he said that little dove landed in the camp and he said they had the message he said see the dove was hurt the dove was mistreated but he landed in the camp with the message listen amen the message has already been given amen they can keep cutting off the head of the prophet but the church already has the message the word has already been planted and this what you're feeling is the latter rain on the message of the hour your pastor's sermons are rain sermons and it's maturing the church in the harvest reign i'll tell you what you might not recognize it you might not understand it but i'll tell you this you are going in a rapture by these sermons you're hearing this message is preparing you for adoption authority for the changing of your body my no wonder the devil's after this preaching no wonder he's after the word of god isaiah might be after it too now god sends his holy ghost on the planet word now what is it been planted in here brother brahm says it like this you know pentecost was a shuck right he said now the shuck has given strength into the seed he said it was a good chuck it served its time but it is the word bride of the word groom therefore we must be that word bride it's the manifestation of the hour the living oracles amen i'm going to skip through it the living oracles and the attributes of god in the formation of the bride isn't that something an attribute of god in the formation of the bride people want to see god well look around a little you're literally seeing the mind of god manifesting itself in the attribute of bride it's in the form of pride if you can see it in a rose why couldn't you see it in a believer if you can see it in a lily why couldn't you see it in a believer if you can see it in the sun and the moon and the stars why not in the believer she's the redeemed of god amen do you see amen i know i know that word brian now we we can put all kinds of translations to that and i know that we we have certain uh sections among us and and good people but they get a little in the direction they get a little bit a word bride means intellectual it's what word right means it means intellectuals so if we put all the quotes together correctly see then we become uh we become real educated message guys but let me let me just give you a news flash this morning you can put together the words of god with intellectual power and it only brings intellectual stimulation that's the reason some services really never get off of the ground and people never really get saved or get filled with the holy ghost because there's a lot of intellectual preaching amen and after a while people get a taste for intellectual and they want to draw the word of god through an intellectual filter amen but you know when god really puts a gift in a man's life that gift is to take the word of god and put it together under a supernatural instruction and if you hear a sermon under the supernatural there is a supernatural power released with that sermon that's why the preaching of the gospel is how people are saved the preaching the gospel is how people get the holy ghost do you know that people amen i just say this amen i've been in meetings preaching meetings and people receive the holy ghost in the middle of the sermon amen brother sam you know what i'm talking about people are healed in the middle of the sermon amen some intellectual come up and say well brother wayne's not very smart i'm not trying to be smart i'm honestly not trying i think if i wanted to be smart i probably could get educated and try to go down that line but i'm not going to surrender the supernatural for the education i'm not going to surrender the supernatural for the intellect what i really want to see is that god would come down in the service and heal souls and give the baptism of the holy ghost and refresh an anointing in the church of the living god and i believe it i believe there's a word born bride i believe she's born by the word but not intellectually it's the revelation of the word that comes in the church now i can show you what brother branham said about it now some people really don't like these quotes very well but i kind of i kind of enjoy them he says it like this he said see he meant now the church is bringing forth members all the time so it's not that people don't have members he said they bring forth members all the time he said but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creature she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her see it would ruin her educated ethical scientific society church that she belongs to they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word brings forth you'll know the difference in what you're hearing of what brings forth if it brings short hair bobbed hair makeup amen pant wearing women in your church social societies and entert that's not the word that did that the word of god will produce a bible bride the word of god will produce an acts 238 tongue talking baby it'll produce people that are filled with the spirit of god and they're ready to walk the word of god that's what it'll produce it won't produce a bunch of murmurs and complainers and oh come on now church we might as well preach since we're here amen i tell you what the devil's been punching on you won't you punch back a little bit the devil's been pushing on you won't you push back a little ain't it about time to push back on that devil and say satan get off of the grounds at the baptism of the holy ghost i believe in getting the holy ghost with power and with demonstration and with anointing in joel chapter 2 is it not prophecy that god would pour out his spirit in the last days and the unveiling of god brother bam says in joel 2 i'll pour out my spirit saith the lord now watch he says you have to watch those words now watch the difference brother branham was not against preaching and using greek words he was not against preachers studying and getting in the depth of the word and bringing out the greek meanings and pushing together the scripture he was not against it he's against doing it without a revelation of it to begin with but brother random goes into the scripture and says in the beginning elohim he said now you've got to watch the difference see you've got to watch the difference in the greek word elohim and the english word god because the english word god in the beginning god that could mean that piano any object you worship can become a god but in the beginning elohim and the word elohim means a self-existing one it just means god who is all-sufficient and self-existing in other words the greek meaning aligns with the revelation of what we know god to be he's not a piano he's not a church he's he's a god that is self-existent and in the beginning elohim so you can make a you can make an idol out of everything but nothing but god is self-existent nothing but him is self-existent and he pours himself out into the church he only changes his mask now watch the scripture timothy says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god brother baby uses the word elohim see elohim amen do you see the word elohim veiled in human flesh elohim in the beginning elohim was made flesh see great is the mystery of elohim great is the mystery of a self-existing god amen but when we look here in exodus he the self-existing one introduces himself to moses i think it's powerful today to realize that the self-existent god would introduce himself to a human being and speak to him through a fire i think it's powerful when you when you read here amen that god introduces himself to abraham or to moses and he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and moses hit his face for he was afraid to look upon him now watch moses had met abraham's god and he introduces himself as elohim now now here's a powerful thing to me when you read genesis the first chapter amen the word elohim appears 36 times in 31 verses amen now what he's doing moses is letting you know who it is he's about to introduce to you this is elohim now the greeks the greek theologians will take the word elohim and they'll tell you the word elohim is plural so they'll say it's a plurality it's elohim it's plurality but to the believer you understand there's not more than one god so the polarity must mean something different than multiple gods amen but what is it he is plural in attribute not in person he's not many gods he has many attributes of the same god he is father he is son he is holy ghost and moses met him elohim and introduced himself do you recognize that when jesus introduced himself to john amen he introduced in the book of revelations he introduced himself as the almighty god he introduced himself and john begins the book by saying he was almighty god brother bram said that's the first base revelation that jesus christ is god it's the first and the last the first revelation you've got to get is jesus is god and the capstone revelation of the entire bible is jesus is god so god begins you and finishes you with the revelation he is god he is self-existent we're not worshiping the second person of some godhead we're not worshiping two or three gods up there there is only one god and his name is jesus christ and his name is above everything [Applause] now he's got to let you know who he is and moses amen is meeting one who's going to tell you who he is now we go back in the scripture and we read the book of genesis and we read there about how abraham met god and we we read it from genesis 17 and genesis 18 powerful powerful encounters with the god of all creation elohim and abraham visits with him can you imagine amen the bible tells us that elohim is visiting with abraham under the name of el shaddai now do you see he's a he's one god but he's plural in attribute so what's he saying in the message approach to god he says if you want to come to god there is an approach to god and what he's doing is he's showing abraham how to approach elohim is to approach him through the name of the almighty god he's got to come through el shaddai to realize elohim now think of this here brother madame will tell us this i i don't know about you all but i think it's pretty powerful because what i'm reading in genesis 17 abraham didn't write it abraham didn't write genesis 17. and if something happened to you and another individual and i know about it and since i never talked to you about it you know i must have talked to the other person to know the story amen and abraham didn't tell moses the story abraham didn't tell moses what to write but the one that abraham was talking to told moses what was said and done to abraham and jesus looked at that story and said in the days of the end time it will be like this day here so moses was only telling us what god told him about abraham so we got the important part of the conversation got the important thing that god wanted the church to know about abraham in genesis 17 1 he said when the abraham was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared unto abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect i am the almighty god walk before me and be perfect see it's an approach to a name the almighty is most powerful and brother bram said the word el shaddai of course it means breasted one if you read greek theologians they do not none of them agree on what el shaddai means but we have a supreme revelation of el shaddai now that supreme revelation is he is a blessed god and he gives his word and look what happens is when god manifests his word he vindicates his word he manifests as his word it's like a mother who opens her breast to her starving child and the life that is in her can be approached through those breasts see the child has no existence on his own he only gets alive as he approaches his mother through the breath see there's no other approach to the life of his mother other than those breasts and there's no approach to god's life outside him manifesting his word and it's in the holy ghost power you see then the life is drawn through the word my if you want that holy ghost let it come through the word and it'll come and give you power and strength amen i'll tell you i i i studied one time a little bit deeper in this area and i found out that some of the first milk that come from my mother they call it liquid gold because they say things come into a child from its mother's breast in the first hours he's that builds immunities for things that are years down the road coming out things come in at the birth and through that meal that years it takes to get it out through the strength of it so they're carrying things in them that they nursed out of the breast they don't even know what's in them yet until later times when certain diseases attack them or something and with something put in them at its birth that's the reason we don't need no denominational bottles we need the rest of el shaddai we need the life of almighty god and bring strength into the church with authority and power brother ram said see who said abraham was like a baby he said it was 99 years old but it was a baby to god and god brought him to his breast he brought him to himself he said the name the name think of this the name el-shaddai was given to abraham as a pledge when i give you my name el-shaddai it's a pledge i will be your sufficiency i will be the strength of your life i will be what you need for everything that i have ordained for your life i am thy strength giver if god said you're going to be something he has the strength to make you that whatever god says he has the power to produce it i don't have time to preach this subject but let me just say it like this when when mary heard from the angel she was going to have a child it was going to be a virgin child you know what she said i don't know a man but he said to her amen with man it's impossible with god all things are possible is that right go to the greek on that it means that no word of god is spoken without power that any word god speaks has the power of fulfillment with it god doesn't send it amen and it's not a fulfilling word but if god prophesies to you the power to fulfill the word is in the word when it's spoken to you amen who has to put anything in a seed a seed has everything in it it needs to come at its season and when jehovah pledged this the name el shaddai was i'll be your strength i will be that see see then el shaddai was the place that abraham could draw strength i want you to see this i think it's powerful i'm the creator that hung between the heavens and the earth see see is there anything too great for god i may shadow you're my child though you're weak i'm letting you get to see what you'll do about it i'm going to make an example out of you hereafter that men will believe my word and i'll stand by no matter what it takes how long i'll do it i'll stand by it i'm el shaddai draw your strength see el shaddai he's the breasted god new and old testament draw your strength everything you have need of the baby is helpless to pull strength from the mother that's the only way it gets its strength the only way a believer gets his strength is you got to pull it from god you got to pull it from god do you see why you need to pull on the ministry do you see why you pull on the ministry you don't just listen you pull on the ministry because you pull out of the ministry words that give you strength for the season that you're living in amen we don't just come on i don't i i know y'all don't believe in this and i don't either but i think it's the word amen we don't believe in just the man behind the pulpit and people enduring the preaching but it's got to be a body activity it's got to be a body word the gift is only a gift of preaching amen but that gift has to have an operating power and the church pulls from the gift the preacher preaches and the church is edified and god is spoken and strength comes into the church strength strength of god the strength of god's promises now now i want you to realize that abraham didn't get the miracle the same day he went to draw from the breast but brother brahm said like a wading child he said crying snotting he said but when the mother picks up the child he said two things happen it brings strength from the breast and the breast give it satisfying portion so the baby will quit crying because it's satisfied at the same time it's getting its strength and when the church gets a hold of a word they get a hold of a promise of god amen that promise don't only give you strength it gives you satisfaction that god is answering your prayer so when you need strength it comes from el shaddai now abraham the bible told us he had the resource from god in romans chapter 4 when paul wrote about it he said he staggered not through unbelief but was strong in faith now his strength was coming from the word i think it's important to know where your strength comes from because you can renew strength if you know where strength comes from if you don't know the source then you don't know how to get it but if you know where the source of strength is then you will never be weak you'll always have strength amen now watch this david said in psalms 27 i think it's the rapture scripture powerful he said the lord is my light and my salvation of whom shall i fear for the lord is the strength of my life the lord is the strength of my life do you know david says it in psalms 84 he said blessed is his man whose strength is in thee now the man that's really got a blessing is when his life strength is in the lord because if your strength is in the lord it will never fail thee amen it doesn't matter where you're walking you can walk according to david in the valley of baca amen in other words it's a dry place but god will make a well out of it he'll fill the pools with water because your strength is coming from the lord and david says it like this i think it's powerful psalms 84 and 7 he said they will go from strength unto strength amen to them that pull on god will go from strength to strength if you latch on to the ill-shotty out breast you go from strength to strength now somebody said well preacher what does that really mean it means in the amplified bible that says it this way increasing in victorious power you go from one strength to another strength you're not going from strength to weakness you're not moving downward you're moving upward you're going from strength to strength now you may feel weakest if you've ever filled in your life right now you you may say well wait i i don't really feel any stronger now than i ever have can i can take two minutes of your time and say something to you you're in the darkest age it's ever been right and and i i think that it's fair for me to say this the last two years in this america and this world is the hardest two years any peaceful has ever lived in the history of known time that we know about i don't think any society has been hit harder through politics through science through religion through education through the internet through television through radio you're being attacked from every quarter come on now it's the truth it's the devil and he's attacking the church from every quarter hey man if you you turn towards one way it's attack turn another way it's an attack everything around you amen look at what's happened amen for two solid years it has been a absolute battle come on now amen do you let me just say this you may not feel any stronger but if you're sitting here this morning you are stronger than you were two years ago or you wouldn't be here this morning if god hadn't given you strength sufficient for the hour you wouldn't be in the house of god this morning but we are here this morning and we're not just here we're here in strength we're here in authority we're here shouting the victory of god amen i tell you what sometimes you are to just tell the devil i'm still here satan and you ain't got enough to take me you ain't got enough to destroy me i'm the church of the living god you're not going to keep us from marching you're not going to keep us from coming because of the power of god has come in this age we're moving brother from strength to strength amen i know every further up the road that we were before it is impossible for you to survive now in the same level of strength you had two years ago god has given you strength and it's time to recognize he's the strength of my life he's the power of god in my life my strength comes from the lord they that wait upon the lord shall renew strength come on church amen paul said because we have this ministry we faint not what kind of ministry paul said it was a ministry a manifestation he said i have manifestly declared these things unto you and god has manifested this message unto you with power and authority and if you will turn your eyes to the vindicated word of god you don't have to wait any longer you don't have to wait for strength this morning there is strength in the look you can look one time come on church and victory will return to your life you can look at it one time and see really what it is i think it's time to look yes yeah amen this church ain't getting weaker but samuel we're not getting weaker hey matter of fact we're getting stronger we're moving from strength to strength let me give you let me give you a bible on it in the joshua generation 45 years after the death of moses caleb amen came to joshua and said give me the mountain moses said i could have he knew his rights in the generation he lived in came from the things moses said oh god somebody said caleb show me your title he said moses said i could have it that's the title for the bride of christ if a prophet said we can have it then we can have it if you're strong enough to duck the giants off of it it belongs to you if you're strong enough to take the sword of the lord and knock the giants off of it say well brother wayne i'm getting tired no we're not getting tired we're just getting started amen i know people say well by the way uh uh things are tight and all actually we're just getting started amen i think of brother bosworth who was about ready for retirement but when he seen the gift of operation in brother braham's life he come out of retirement and said i have just begun to fight because he's seen the bible living in manifestation well let me tell you this i don't believe this bride's about done i don't believe she's ready for retirement i think it's time for the church to pick up the sword amen and as a caleb of the hour say i'm as strong now as i ever was and i want to take this mountain away from these amalekites and anax what are you talking about by the way i'm talking about take the sword in your hand it's time for strength to manifest itself in your life elohim el shaddai has come upon the church of the living god and has put you in condition to see god now you wasn't in condition for bride's revival you wasn't in condition for rapture you wasn't in condition to hey man you wasn't there you didn't have the strength there was no condition for it but you know the bible actually says amen in the book of revelations 10 and 1 that a mighty angel would come out of heaven a mighty angel a strong one would come down to the church of the living god where are we getting our strength out of this message we're getting our strength and the weakest of all the ages but our strength is coming from the lord he has opened up the fountains of youth and we are renewing ourselves in the power and the manifestations of god it is a shady eye that has came down amen oh i'll tell you strength has now come strength has now come for the church amen there's a strength here that is a supernatural strength it's a supernatural time because actually amen that is god's charistic if you want to know you're worshiping god it will always be supernatural you cannot worship god without it being supernatural because god is the supernatural and i think this is the season for it don't you i think this is the hour to worship like we never have worshiped church i think it's the hour to believe like we've never believed don't grow weary don't grow wearing well doing your strength comes from god amen can our musicians come this morning your strength your strength that comes from god what a season to live i believe it i believe with all my heart that you can pull your strength brother brahm said after that time abraham was now in condition to see the son that's what put him in condition to see it wouldn't it be something today if you pull on it and get get in the condition to see god to see him revealed right here in this meeting this morning in your life i believe you got a right this morning now y'all know me well enough to know i'm not done with my notes but i feel like we've reached that point but elohim has been manifest among the church of the living god as the all mighty god do you know what he did right after that holy ghost fell upon abraham changed his name and gave him seven letters that ended in h.a.m after the name of the church was changed they set an order for a condition to receive the son and god called his name abraham which meant a father of nations he had drawed something he drawed something from the breast of el shadia he drawled an h right out of those breasts he drawed an h into his name can you imagine bringing bringing a name change from fatherless to the father of nations that's what he took from the breast of el shadia he was a fatherless man and drawed strength to be the father of nations a man without a son and god calls him a father because he had now given me strength to fulfill the commission that he had been given think of this today you as a church of the living god one it was called barren but now fruitful what about florence nightingale when she flew in over there came in the room with a prophet skin and bones she had no strength or power but when a prophet began to pray strength began to come back in that life [Music] i think one of my favorite stories i ever heard brother graham taylor tell was the story of georgie carter i think it's one of the most powerful stories i've ever heard a girl late 99 years later on the bed [Music] nine years [Music] do you know she couldn't walk she couldn't get up there's a lot to that story and i i guess i should tell this point of it i didn't know this for years by the samuel but my brother em tells it he said that georgie carter had tuberculosis he said but it was put in her because her uncle raped her and he said it was the abuse of the uncle that caused the herd in her body and tb set up on that she was taking in piano lessons or something so some people are crippled today no fault of their own some situation they were in some sickness settled down on that they begin to lay down they become paralyzed and they get stuck in the place they're in but georgia carter picked up a a little book and read about a nail girl that had been healed and she believed that jesus christ was the same yesterday she even told her mama that she wanted to be prayed for and be healed and your mama told her said honey god don't do them kind of things anymore when brother branham come around and started preaching divine healing by vision the mother called him a false man and said he's building false hope in the child that she could be healed can you imagine she was saying it was false hope it was false hope that strength would return to her daughter that she'd get up out of that bed it was false hope to believe that god would do things like he did in the bible but god was there to prove it wasn't false hope he was there to restore the hope of the entire church and used one little girl so we could stand here this morning and tell you in these crippling conditions the same god that raised up georgie carter can raise you up and remember when brother brown seen that pillar of fire and brought strength that brought strength come to him and he had thus saith the lord he walked in the room of george he laid there nine years brother bram said he said to her thus saith the lord george stand up on your feet and that's what brother branham i always thought it's amazing the way he said it he said i heard myself say stand up on your feet and then he said then i thought in my mind hey man she ain't been on her feet in nine years there's no muscle in her legs how will the little girl stand without any muscles how would she do what i just told her to do in his mind he's thinking that he said but then i realized if god told her to do it he'd give the strength for it to happen and the power she stood by was not her own power it was the power of the word of god and the same word that brought georgie carter off of that bed is the same word we're preaching in the house of god this morning and i believe it's time for the church to rise up and walk in authority and walk in power i don't i don't care what it is that's happened i don't care what the situations are it's time to rise up like never before keep pressing the battle if you could open the heavens right now and a voice was coming out of the beings of the angels that you would hear them say to you press the bible church press the bible amen the the finish line is right in front of you it's not a time to stop not a time to lay down the sword it's not a time to retire it's not a time to give up and to walk away it's an hour like never before for the church to gather together the strength that god gave them pick up the sword of the word of god and take back what the devil has taken from you saying satan the joyous mind the peace is mine the holy ghost is mine life and you have no right taking it from me oh i tell you i know i know what it is i know satan says to you satan says to you if you just back up a little bit i'll let you have some peace you won't have to fight seek to come to church and to be a part of a body it's a fight and satan says well if you just quit coming around you'll get you a little peace that's a lying devil and amen all you've got to do is ask israel about this when the palestinians told them we'll give you peace if you give us land it's a lie they will never be happy as long as israel's alive come on church and land for peace is a lie satan is lying to you don't you give one inch of the ground that god gave you don't you give one thing back to the devil that god has given to you i believe it's time for the church to possess the borders of every promise of god you're a joshua generation i believe it i believe it's real church i believe it's true i don't think it's time to back up something's already prophesied over you can i say it this way we're not going to give up one inch of ground i want the devil to hear it i want the world to hear it we're not going to give up one inch of ground hey man if you want to hear something beautiful sometime go hear churchill when he was a man through through the through the source of radio he conquered the nazis in germany with the people of britain you know how he done it the power of words he took the power of words and he told britain he said we're in bad conditions things are troubled amen the germans is on the amen looks like they got us against the odds he said but i'll tell you what we're going to do we're going to fight them on the benches he said we're going to fight them in the beaches we're going to fight them in the waters we're going to fight them in their land we're going to fight them in the air he said but we're never going to surrender and i believe we could say that this morning we'll find it in the church we'll fight it in the world we'll fight it in our cars we'll find it in our bedrooms but we will not surrender one inch of ground for the church of the living god they can do what they want they can say what they want we are not quitters we are not backing up we are not quitting we're going to press this battle until there's a change in our bodies hallelujah it's time to shake it off right shake that devil in the fire and rise up from there and get back to walking hey i believe we got the riot this morning don't you won't you stand to your feet with us this morning hallelujah or somebody say hallelujah glory to god let's fight that devil no reason to back up no reason to give our children back to the devil i'll fight for every one of those to be i'll fight for your children i'll fight for my children we ain't gonna let that devil just come in and take over we've got promises every one of them [Music] i'm not just carried away there's an anointing in this church right now there's anointing in this room and if you just surrender right now to that anointing that was something charged on the inside of you and you'll know it's more than a man saying this there's an anointing saying this to you don't you give up don't you sit back don't you let the devil have one inch of your ground this morning this is your hour church this is your season [Music] you don't have to let the devil have nothing

of all power and it is is here i reach my hands to the heavens [Music] i look to you [Music] [Music] in [Music] how many say amen amen amen to the word of god amen to the presence of god god's speaking so so personally in this hour you know everything it always comes down to brother branham said it so simply in the easter seal there in 65. and he speaks of how he says now these seals have been open we know those seals are him it's christ being revealed and unfolded and made known to you and i that he's the same god brother bran made this statement he said it all depends on the attitude that you take toward it as whether it'll do you any good or not and we want to have the right attitude to the things of god sometimes it isn't you know we we know what it's like to have a bad attitude we've all been there sometimes where our attitude's just not right but you see the right remember brother bram tells us the right mental attitude toward any promise of god will bring it to pass it's not just like christian sciences was just positive thinking no it's it's it's taking the word because it's the word that has life in it and when you take the word into your life the word has within it just as the lord spoke here this morning it has the power within it to fulfill and bring to past what god has said and so it's not just good thinking but it's taking the word of god into our being and if we can just take that regardless of whatever the the thoughts are it'd just be like this if you went to the doctor's office and the doctor said maybe you've got whatever it could be back leg whatever it could be and the doctor could say you're going to be in a wheelchair you know it depends on whether or not you entertain that thought as to whether you'll be in a wheelchair a person can come to you and sometimes there's some things that can be earth-shattering to our outer two realms the flesh and the spirit they can say you've got cancer and that word cancer itself just saying it it brings it can bring a fear is that right but when there is that anchor that's in the soul that you can look back to a promise and say this is what the doctor has said it's there in my body but i'm looking to a report that is greater and is above every other report and when we can just look at that and come back because see all these things that come about at times is to take our focus away from what really belongs to us and we can get a person can take something like that and not saying that that's not something real but they can become wrapped up in that and they forget about it's god that has watched over your life all along and it's the same god that's watched over your life is the same god who's present to bring you through that situation don't ever stop don't stop drawing strength from the lord he is our strength amen well even as we're prayed for remember it's the strength of almighty god because it's the quickening power in the body of believers it's quickening power that moves through that pair to strengthen you and i and then what do we do what's the strength you've received keep feeding on the word of god you might say brother samuel i i don't seem like i'm getting nothing it don't seem like i'm it's not about what you feel you're getting or whether you feel anything or not as a matter of fact there were so many that sat right in brother branham's meetings even in dwight moody's meetings and they were healed while the word was being preached and some could sit there and think i don't got enough faith to be healed think of this sitting there in their first conscience and they didn't think they had enough faith to be healed but the subconscious man is where it really lays and it was in contact with the supernatural god it went beyond their first conscience and brought down healing into their life i'm glad that there's a greater you than you there's a greater me than me on the inside that's that part of god that's really him that's really him it draws from the word so if we can just look at that and just take the right attitude towards the word of god and just draw strength from the word of god keep looking keep focusing i believe that's what the spirit of god has really really spoke to our hearts in this hour and you see when when when the spirit of god comes around like this how that god will come around and he'll speak right directly to our hearts the greatest thing we can do you know sometimes maybe if you're you're guilty or you're in this situation you can take one or two things you can either get offended at the word because the word's touching right where you're at or you can say yes lord yes lord i don't want to be offended in the word because the word has come to help me and i need the discernment of the living god the living word to discern things out in my life amen aren't you glad amen oh my let's just give the lord a handclap of praise [Music] thank you lord jesus [Music] whose report will you believe
