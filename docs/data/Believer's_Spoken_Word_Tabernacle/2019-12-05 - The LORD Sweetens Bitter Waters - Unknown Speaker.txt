Lord God for these needs Lord tonight we ask the Lord you'll just take control of speaker and here together receive all honor and glory Lord we ask it Lord won't God in the name of Jesus Christ a precious Lamb our Redeemer amen our Savior our Lord our deliverer our shield and our Butler our precious Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you say amen amen let's look into the word tonight into Exodus chapter 15 I'd like to go there tonight and I want to read verse 22 is where I'd like to go to certainly appreciate brother Brian coming over and taking care of the things we're improvising a little bit right here while we're waiting on things to get here the Brian I know he made the trip over here on Sunday evening his family and everybody was just there still sick but brother Brian came over here on Sunday night and to try to get this to work for us and so that way you didn't have any excuse not to see somebody says what's a song look but we just think the Lord tonight let's look here in the word of the Lord verse 22 we would like to start right there so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to Marah they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marna and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink amen and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth they make god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated tonight I just want to look at this thought here and this has been a very precious probably to many of you as well a very precious scripture reading it's something that that that in just really just meditated for over a year and just just waiting and then the Lord just just picked it up this week with where it was where everything was and I want to speak tonight on the font the Lord sweetens bitter waters and if I had a sub thought within and I'd like to look at the path of the Lord you know when you think of how that that Israel when they they came into this place right here the Bible says that the waters when they they came to him they were thirsty they they needed a refreshment and when you you know how it is when you have need of a drink and they were in a situation they had went three days journey and within three days journey to hear God brings them to a place that the waters themselves were not even waters that were fit to drink they were bitter they could not find any refreshment out of these waters at all and when you look at it within the life if we can just pause just for a moment when you think of a bitter taste there's probably not one person in here that has not that has not at some time or another experienced even where there's been maybe a bitterness within your body naturally or even in your stomach or even you know how the acids would come up within the throat and that's what that's a bitterness that is there and to think that how that this bitterness we know that it's also a type of what would be after the fall we're in that the very we're in that man's nature would be such of a bitterness that it would long and crave for the things of the world but yet God himself by his grace would make away that he would actually take away that bitterness of that old nature and he would put a new nature within us by his Spirit and that that in itself is a great paradox but I I want to bring this down as the holy spirit would if he if this is so be the manner that he would direct it you think of how that the very approach was in the in in the Garden of Eden when when how God had told Israel or told told he told them at that day the day you eat thereof that day you die they could have never known and neither did God want them to experience the bitterness of unbelief he never wanted them to experience this bitterness that was there but yet to find of immediately when they even as they begin to reason and how that this bitterness would set in we find that what took place that now how God's expressed in that time he said from dust I'll came and dust thou shalt return and God let him know that all the days of thy life that the earth now will bring forth thorns and thistles unto you and so when we look at this the bitterness itself and to think of thee you know that would be around the life every one of us encounter bitter trials and bitter tests there's not one believer that doesn't encounter the bitterness of tests and of trials therein in situations that as far as for our soul our soul is not affected but it is our flesh and our spirit that experiences the bitterness of the test and of the trials this is why Paul could say in the scripture that we are delivered alway unto death he would say that the body that we experience within our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life might also be made manifest God know exactly what he's doing so that his life might be reflected in you and I and in among all of us here tonight there's not one of us that would that that that but would have the desire to say Lord I want your life to be so reflected in me and to find that that is not something that is just given to us but it is through victory after victory there is a and a victory that comes in our soul and it's the victory of Calvary that he trapped on that Easter morning he ascended on high and he sent back the victory remember the Bible says he will divide the divide the spoil with the strong and you are the strong he divided he took of that life and he gave of that life but then as we're walking in this life we have tests yes faithful through the midst of it all and and when we think of it that bitter trials and tests of our life things it can be things on the jobs or this or that and we can actually move into a place where you actually begin to entertain those things and when you know how it is when you entertain those things like that you find yourself in a position where you don't even is around us the bitterness of even of thinking of this could be or that could be but you know I want to just say and very simple that the key within it all is to allow the Lord I know that sounds simple it is but the battle is with us allowing the Lord he is ever willing ever-present he is mindful but the key is to allow the Lord to make it sweet I want you to think about this God Benton dry up the waters and put in new honors he doesn't remove the test or trial he just sweetens it are you with me he said I because he knows what he's doing he's over it all and and if we can be honest there is none of us that like the bitterness of tests and trials but yet we know that it is working for our good and within it if any one of us and I've just said it because it's true for everybody if every one of us if we had it and it's a man if I could just let this tester this trial this thing go away I wanted to go away but you know what God proves his victory through the test through the trial in the midst of it that's where he proves he's God so I would say it like this tonight I know it's very simple but it is the key is to allow the Lord to make it sweet and not become bitter from a bitter situation not to become bitter from a bitter situation what you think when brother Branham stood there and the test came to where how they the Lord you know had taken his wife taking his daughter remember he said Satan Swift right up there right beside me and he told him at that time he began to just point out different things and everything you said professed this and you've done this and you've done that and it began to point it out remember what brother Branham told us here he never gave any glory in his own flesh but he gave the glory to God who is present and when Satan and made his boast and and trying to turn the Prophet around remember what brother Graham said about they said at that time I was getting ready to say if that's how he's going to be he said but that type post rose up in the middle of that time thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for the genuine birth in the midst of that cat did it take away the bitterness no but he had the key that would actually transform bitterness into sweetness because you know even after that you read you hear the story how brother branham himself would be walking down the road I believe with REM called it mr. Eisler Monnaie meone it matters is is what was said how that he would say Billy how is your religion he said hey you know how are you keeping your religion he said I'm not he's keeping me that's the reality it's not us keeping its God keeping us that's enough to just shout about right now let me just say it to you right now tests and trials are not sent to make you bitter but they are come to mold and to shape us and to prepare us for things that are to come you see when we we look at this whole part of the journey remember God could have just taken them and moved them from Egypt and move them right into the Promised Land they are in a line of journey this portion we're reading here is not where that they have rejected going in the land this is part of the journey remember the Bible tells us and believe it's in the beginning of that chapter of Exodus 5:15 it says how that God he God did not lead them through the path that would have taken him up along there to sea and brought him in to the land he said he didn't take him up the way of the Philistines less they would rise up and Israel would faint you see God knows what we're able to stay he knows what we are able to stand and God could have taken him that way but you see God isn't is is working with Israel like the Bible would say it like this in the book of Deuteronomy you see Moses takes such time in the book of Deuteronomy to work with the tale the children of Israel now that that new generation has raised up he lets them know that the Lord has bore you through this wilderness as a father does a son he lets him know God has been in control it's been his care over your life from the from from even while you were down in Egypt maybe you say like this tonight why you were down in the slave pits why you are on the bar stool let me tell you something God was still watching over your life what has to happen is to recognize that the Lord is with you and then in you he got just and all of a sudden show up in our life he's there with us all the time that's why there's nothing could touch your life nothing could touch your life God was watching over your life the predestinated plan of God is not something that has just happened in time ittsan folded in time but it's found eternity - glory be to God I feel like preaching a little bit hallelujah this very path of God's leaning listen this was not punishment these bitter waters were not punishment are you with me brother Graham tells us this listen friends this message that God has sent to you and I it discloses the very thoughts of God it lets us know what God even when we take Joe brother Brad would take even this brother Brad would actually convey the phrase under the unction of the Holy Ghost and would tell us in three kinds of believers as long as he said Satan can make Oh faith that he was his god that was doing it to it he had Joe flipped so it's even how we're looking at the trials how we even look at it can either bring victory or defeat oh yeah now so when we see this this was not punishment this was God leading his children God wanted to show them his faithfulness his continued power his love and his care you know brother Branham he as he would replace it through the message of how here they were following Moses as Moses followed the pillar and cloud I think that's a tremendous thing right there they were following they were not on their own device God had sent them a messenger with a vindicated message they were they were following as Moses was following Christ they were following Moses which brought them to following Christ under the blood they were walking with that pillar and fire I just say it very plainly you leave Moses you left the pillar of fire are you with me you left the cloud right you can't have and say well I take Jesus but I don't need the Prophet that is air that is Error that is not the truth of God's Word Paul said follow me as I follow Christ amen there is an authority that God comes with his word and he unfolds it's it's like the scriptures that are here when you look at the scripture concerning Moses going down to Egypt Moses name is not even in there it's three scriptures that are spoken to Abraham in Genesis 15 but God just like the Tabernacle in the wilderness he reveals in the tabernacle the wilderness just speaking of Christ he unpacks his word in every Jenner and everything will always be unpacked the same and place the same because he is to say yesterday today and forever glory be to God oh mama it looks like it looks like to the human carnal thinking it looks like he - let him - good water three days I've been been three days without water mind you they're getting ready to run out of food - but you need water first it looks like he would have let him to good water but he let him to bitter waters so he could prove their faith I think his one writer wrote it let me see if I can get it right now one writer wrote it he said you know in this particular incidence he said what we find is he says is it he said where the complainers that worships sometimes are made manifest or is it where the worshipers sometimes complain I thought that was really good it you know because there is there's times we all complain but a tenant comes out where is it at is it always the complainers once and allow they worship or are we worshipers once in a while you complain Oh hallelujah but he led them to bitter water so he could prove their faith he likes to do it he likes to let tribulations come on you shall listen to these words show you so he can show you his love and his power too think about it brother Raman he goes on he says how can people today who doesn't believe in the miracle working power of God when tribulations come they just give up and gone but we believe God works miracles hallelujah because you see God will always act the same way when the conditions are met God will always act the same way every time he hasn't changed he had to diminish in power there's not in one iota or one ounce he is the same God tonight that he ever was and you see God would bring it down through his word and I'm just referring to your places in the book of Deuteronomy of how that through the wilderness God spoke through Moses in the book of Deuteronomy and this was not just something that they were hearing he took them to experiences in their life you have seen how the Lord has cared for you as a father did the son you have seen how he suffered deed to hunger that he might prove thee and feed thee with manna you have seen how did he kept clothes on your back you have seen how he has made a way time and time again you see it wasn't just word brother but the word comes with experience that was to build an experience for the promises that God had ordained for them to possess in that hour that's why that do not despise the day of small things every test every trial every experience in your life that's war glory has molded you had shaped you for this very moment and every test in every trial right now if you allow the Lord to sweetness he will mold you and shape you for what is to come next with it all being molding and shaping for us to sit in his throne with him he is not the author of confusion there is a purpose in all that he's doing and I love you God wanted to chase him then see the word chasing him as Moses brings that up it doesn't mean we're it's always a belt out here that's not chasing me chastening it has it has its part come on somebody it has its part God God will admonish us with his word God will teach us with his word and God teaches us by experience is that right he corrects us when we've been wrong when we don't heed that correction then that's when we really get the high tenant but thank God thank God he's faithful to Tanner heids you know what that shows he loves us He loves us enough not to let us get by with it glory be to God chastening chastening itself is to discipline it was God disciplining Israel he wasn't he was teaching them personally that that that i am the lord i am faithful in every situation because when they come into the land in their own inheritance in their own possession they're going to be times where they're going to be faced with bitter trials they're going to be faced with bitterness that's around them but they need to repeat reminded that the god that brought you out of Egypt the God that brought you through the Red Sea the God that sweetened the the the waters of Marah that same God that brought you across the Jordan is the same God who is with you in your inheritance he's the one that's done it now we won't ask hands for how many times that we feel like he's not there we won't ask the time for hands that it feels like in the midst of a test or trial that our prayers are going up to the ceiling and ricocheting down we won't talk about we want but but the reality is we all come through that you might be setting in that tonight my mama I just I just want to follow what he's wanting sometimes the things that we are we're praying about and it just seems like we're not getting the answer is because we're not letting God step in we're wanting it in a certain way there's not one of us in here that don't want to be out of a test or a trial listen friends tests and trials let alone situations that we create can you say Amen tonight because everything that comes our way is you know I'm just suffering for the kingdom of God no sometimes we suffer for our own sorry decisions and the church said you can't put everything as though that you eat angels when you ate Donuts with the Angels every morning there's times where you make wrong decisions even in that he is faithful glory be to God now how that God he led them here's God leading them now God as he would lead them out you know when you think about it they didn't know how these waters were going to be Moses didn't know how those waters were going to be but God knew how the waters was going to be this was a divine appointment by God God knew exactly even to where how even the Junction's of time and how that they would come tomorrow at this particular time he knew they would be thirsty it was somebody preach with me tonight there's times where you might seem to look all around you and it don't seem like you're getting any thirst or refreshment but let me remind you the refresher is right there with you he hasn't left you at all I'm gonna believe these are god of his word he's God of his word hey man he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you that's what he said he said so then as Paul said then I will say that the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man can do unto me jesus said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you well I'm with thee even unto the end of the world he says he says I am with thee my presence is there with you but how many times when situations arise we don't feel see God is God listen to me faith is built upon the word I love to feel him as much as anybody does but our faith is built in the word you say what do you mean I'm saying when you doubt feeling you can able to stand there in the midst of the trial and set but Lord you said you are you were with me you never leave me nor forsake this so I'm gonna thank you for being faithful to your word you say brother Samuel that's mind over matter no we are believers they meant we don't walk by sight we walk by faith amen faith is a revelation amen when he was there think of this here is Moses coming to this place and that's what I like how brother Graham says it here he says here he said when they came up to this spring of Marah and when they came to there along this road but he was there talking about the Lord the remedy for the bitter waters was standing on the bank Moses cut down a tree and throwed it in the water and it turned sweet again they couldn't bypass this come on somebody Jesus himself let me put it in the words of the prophet from Matthew 26 he said Jesus in souls in prison prayed to even dodge the cross are you with me if it be possible let this cup pass from me he even would tell Peter put up your sword in John 18 11 put up your sword for I must drink this cup that the father has called for me to drink reality there's a lot of cups that we've asked Lord remove this I hope you understand hear this if you hope you listen very closely this right here God came down and it came one of us so that he could understand that and be able to minister to you and I as a faithful high priest but you must continue to look at the word he came to a place to be able to say nevertheless even a lemon let's not my will but thine will be done and he prayed that way three times showing you here and within even better the human will human will being given over to allow God to step in let me just say this to you Jesus did not go to Calvary bitter who mama he didn't go to Calvary bitterly what I got to do this I never done nothing wrong and they're spitting on me buying a black man black name upon my love the whole time I've had to sit here and there's been one against me the whole time and I had to pretend that he was my brother come on preach with me now I've had to sit here he wasn't acting he wasn't pretended brother it was demonstration of what the love of God can do it can so sweeten the life to work Jesus to get bread in the same dish with his enemy whoo so much--so bet the rest of the disciples questioned themselves not judas see there wasn't anything that was going on like ya see now Jesus looked at him you know how it is I mean you know Jesus you know he don't respond on him he don't call on him he don't do this he don't do now nothing nothing nothing like that at all you say brother Samuel that's Jesus were his bride and it's not my flesh it's that see Jean on the inside that came from the loins of God's mind but the quickening power has quickened the raised up and what that light did in the group yet must do and it will do and is to it the same in the bride for he is the vine we are the branches if it bears if the vine is a lemon branch and it bears oranges its bearing false witness of the life of the vine help me Lord help me Lord you can bypass it sometimes I wonder and I'm just speaking very plainly I know how it is to want to bypass things we all have tests and trials my chest and my trials are not any greater than yours neither are yours and mine and the reality is there's not one of us that's tangled face-to-face with the devil himself we've wish we just had the imps coming come on now Jesus was the one he met that challenge is that right Mendon to think of this that how every one of us go through tests and trials you say why does this one go through this chest or why does this one why am I going through this your tests and your trials are relative to the position that you're called to you are tried and tested based on the position now spiritually our position remember when the sons of thunder there of Zebedee the question was made can you give them to sit on the right hand and left hand what did Jesus say he said it is not mine to give blood I'm said see it shows it was already given but it says it shall be given is what Jesus said to those of whom in his four and brother Adam pointed out clearly he said see what it is the test for the throne had not fallen yet but that test for the throne must fall and when it falls remember it is not can I hold on can I make it we have already overcome in God's mind there is no defeat in God in his plan he did not choose you wandering or biting his nails thinking am I gonna lose him oh my goodness huh no no no I don't know if this tester trial right now no God he molds us he shapes us he prepares us for every test in every trial as it comes along while he's working not so much to make us better in this life he is molding us and shaping us for that life which is to come this is only as brother Brown would say it over and over especially a lot in the Hebrew series this is the proving grounds we can't bypass it is that right they had to follow the cloud of fire the pillar fire that let them you know human thinking human thinking many times we'll look at things and it seems as though everything ought to go right I'm serving God think about it for a moment God is holy God is good god is faithful there is nothing that's greater than God there's not one situation there's not one devil there's not one demon there's not one hold nothing is greater than God but God loves to show his power he's not a show-off he don't clown he don't clown for people he manifests his power and his glory for his children it is true the Bible tells us in the book of Peter that God is not willing that any would perish God don't want to see anybody go to hell because hell wasn't made for human beings it was made for the devil and his angels but there is also the divine will of God where God's choosing and those of God's the God's election that how that God within himself he manifests his glory to take a hold of the hearts and lives of the believer and give us strength and confidence in these hours of tests and of great trial it's through these times that God manifests his his faithfulness to you and I it's why brother Ram say that if we follow he said the church following the purifier the Holy Ghost he said you'll make Canaan as sure as anything but some ways and some pathways our humanity doesn't want that our humanists our spirit our mas oh no because what we do know you're either in a test coming out of one or you're getting ready to go into one one of three categories I know sometimes we want to talk about I can't wait till I get to that that a little bit between coming out and going in we'll get there but ha ha ha God promised he gives rest he gives refreshment oh yeah he feels yet strengthened yeah back into another test back into another trap but he's the author of not confusion but the author with a purpose hey man you love that this is what Jesus would tell tell the disciples in John 16:33 he would let them know that in me you have peace but in the world you don't have tribulations think of this in me you have peace but in the world situations that rise around us will be beer there are bitter situations that we go through tests and trials but notice what he said be of good cheer I have overcome the world you know and he's letting them know there is the tree standing right there on the bank when you come to the waters of mine I'm right there when your window and when you see my glory you come through the Red Sea my what a shouting service not we've had shouting services my this and that but I'm the same God who was with you in the shouting times I've with you in the times of Marah ha I'm there I'm faithful I'm there with you throughout it all and to think of this right here he said I'll be with you even to the end of the age let me quote you another part of God's Word greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world greater is the love of God and the peace of God in yourself than all the bitterness that can be around our prayer I say our prayer I believe this for everybody's heart as a believer my prayer is Lord don't let me bypass the trials just give me like the prophets that give me the grace to go through it give me the grace to go through them in order to notice the scripture says here in 1st Corinthians 10 it says that all all of these things that happened it says in verse 12 I don't know if we have that there or not but it says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful I love that it didn't say was because he was but he is he's the ever-present God in every situation God is faithful and will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it that's a mouthful right there but will with the temptation so God is faithful he makes a way to escape with the temptation the test God doesn't remove the test or the trial if he does he's defeating his own purpose but that you might be able to bear it aren't you glad that he makes a way that we can bear it I'll be honest with you every test in every trial it's been because he's made away the same there been times you complain oh yeah oh yeah they'll tell you there been times you didn't see it coming every time just like you the salmon is there times when you didn't know what the tester trials about every time just like you because it the faith is not that we know what that test is doing or what that travel is do it but we do know what God when he spoke and Joel picked it up and Joel said I know when all this is over with I shall come forth as pill as gold I know what he's doing I don't understand it but he knows what he's doing and I know one thing when I come out of this there's gonna be less a job and more of God and when I come out of this test it'll be less of Samuel and more of God why he's making the way to escape I wonder could it be that the lingering is sometimes were not allowing God to sweeten it I don't want to time just getting away from me tonight but I want to try to just get us to a point and we'll just stop here tonight friends we how many times that we've heard we hear how many times have I myself have preached on tests and trials God does not get down on us his tests and trials are not punishment are you with me tonight it's to understand that they're not punishment it is God leading us there's things in our life God wants to work out there's things many times that if we oh my we would say if this person if that situation if this boss if that and the reality is God allows us to come into those maura times he didn't about the boss sir do we pray but one thing we need to pray remember what brother Graham told us he said let us conduct ourselves with joy and midst our trials brother and sister let me tell you something I'm not preaching something to you tonight that is that is head knowledge I'm telling you something tonight that is things that has to stick to your bones it's things that you have to pray about and you have to die and let God say God in the midst of this trap it's bitter love but would you sweeten these waters Lord why because the Tetra trial did not come to make me bitter it's come to mold me and shape me you've got a right as a believer to ask God tonight and friends he ain't way out there he's right here turning in just right here at the altar he's right there with you hallelujah later if he that is in you than he that's in the world when you're on the job and the bitterness stretch he's right there when sickness stretch he's right there [Applause] hallelu he loves to prove his power Bruce and prove his power I'm still in the midst of this said situation I'm still in the midst of this test he doesn't take away the waters he's sweet so if you're praying for God to take away the waters that might be the problem say Lord sweetener the seminary you tell me that I'm to be content if you got sickness or whatever I'm on your body no I didn't say that at all you misunderstood because we can go on and on through promises in the scripture here we the Bible is filled with the promises and God has made good on every one of them I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases by His stripes I am healed you see what a little bit had in Jesus in it can do to your situation I tell you what you can add in corrupt communication and it creates more bitterness or you can take the word and put the letter in your situation and confess God for who he is you say how long do I confess it first of all possess it till you believe it he's the high trees of your confession Masek about daddy buzzword would said if if Bosworth would say he said that many of the times the problems is he said we're focusing on the situation instead of quoting and focusing on God's Word in the midst of a situation we had the premises of God I'm just I just want to stop here tonight I it's hard to find a stopping spot but I trust my heart's desire I want you to understand my heart's desire is that we would all be encouraged here tonight that's my heart's desire is that one we will leave out of here we're encouraged but the encouragement is it doesn't remove your test or your trouble if it was up to me I'd pull everyone I'm away from you you say you would it's like how I feel about my kids but I can't do that they got to have opposition they've got to have people that call their hand on things at the college now you're only saying that because you're this this and this and this they gotta have that time what are you gonna do brother Samuel let them have that time times of proving grounds bitterness can be around but God is faithful and that's how God does this is why the human mind cannot even consider how in the world when God stands there in revelations 2 and the Bible speaks of the Simonian age an age of such bitterness and yet here it is rung out in that time I know that tribulation and that poverty I know he's not on the sidelines he's walking in the midst of the candlesticks he's walking right in the midst of your life if you'll just let him he'll sweeten the test he'll sweeten the trial it isn't sometimes understand sometimes things don't go the way that we we pray and desire that they would go is that right sometimes certain things and we pray in a certain way and they don't go in a certain way but yet in the midst of the time God is faithful to sweetie I think of how I think of how I'm closing it it's all closed up but this it enclosed down I think of our brother Branham when it came to the stats to his family the doctor kept that baby alive for two days in an oxygen tent but Bream said I pray during this time brother Branham prayed and he walked into his room there's a personal letter that he wrote I've got here that he wrote to the Stanzler family but there is also there in the message the Messiah the very beginning of that where brother Branham he refers back to this how that after then when that when when the Holy Spirit spoke to him in his room and said don't you go this is the hand of the Lord don't tell me in your mind you can understand that you can't but you just know it's the hand of God there's the Lord it is not that we have to understand if we trust him in everything we trust him is that right our trust is not well show me in denial you know our trust is in him he is with us he's guiding us I think of how sister Stansfield brother branham writes he writes to the status of a family a personal letter and he tells them sister staff letter says God didn't raise up this baby because I don't have I don't have I don't have great faith he said oh no sister on the contrary you all have great faith great faith because he said when God even gave an answer like that and were not men did not raise up that baby he said you and your husband stood faithful to the Lord that to me that's powerful that's powerful do you think there listen to me now you think there want some sweetening that had to go on in the stands flip house there was some sweetening that had to go on it wasn't all artificial or alternative measures they called on the Living Christ who was there in their lives I think they're one times the things then come up in their mind the devil didn't try to shoot in thoughts my good night ourselves closing you think there one time all those things were around just like he comes at you and me but in the midst of the time he's present to sweeten the test or the trial he's there I didn't get fully into that tonight at all but just one time if anything at all we take out of this part of it tonight he is present he is present no wonder Paul would say let the word of Christ dwell in you richly taking the promises of God upon our lips upon our hearts meditating upon those words let me just tell you something you can easily tell when it's the devil say how's that because he he's a tormentor he's a tormentor he speaks things against the word he's a liar he wants to try to tell you you don't deserve the promises of God or they're not for you where you're gonna die God does not work that way he is a God of peace and when he reveals his will peace comes with it brother are you with me you say the example on that we can go through a countless but let's just go to Jesus when he went to the cross remember in John 12 he was troubled his cell was exceedingly sorrowful unto death but he received sweetening but where when he went to the cross Peter could say when he was reviled he reviled not back when they pulled beard from his faith there was no guile in his mouth when he hung on the cross and they mocked him he never said wait till I get in position now remember what she did to me and what she said No he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do but how many knows the scripture he was delivered Acts chapter 2 he was delivered according to the determined counsel of God this was not a mishap this was all God bringing his word to pass they didn't know what they were doing but God had it all laid out lord help us to have that attitude help us to have that attitude help us to have that sweet'n these waters are hard sweeten these waters sweeten my spirit sweeten my mind my memory maybe you need a little sweetening in your memory your memory is stinging say annoyed its bitterness all around me but lord you're the sweetness of my soul and the sweet Jesus a muscle lord I need you right now - you're in my ship these troubled waters that are round Lord I need you to sweeten these waters I need to see that Lord that vision that Moses song [Applause] hallelujah Oh God I'm telling you tonight I don't know what you might be going through I don't know what situation that you've come through but I if there's anything at all - take that consolation and I know you found him to be that way but I just the burden of my heart is that right here tonight God knows the encouragement we need and to encourage you that everything that's been before that even sometimes where we have prayed to dodge it Lord I don't want to go that direction but yet on the inside nevertheless nevertheless lord if it be thy will I'm telling you he is no matter what you feel he hadn't left you he's right there walking in the midst and tonight if you feel like maybe the experience around you that you might say you know I I feel like maybe I'll become a little bitter in myself he's here to sweeten refresh you tonight as well he's here to give you a refreshment so that your look and your and even your vision to be able to look at the situation to be able to look at it to where you can realize he cares for you he cares about your need every prayer you've prayed the prayers even when you've asked God listen to me asking God lord give me the strength to come through this it did not fall by the wayside the Prophet would stand there on the platform and here you stand and he said oh he says I I see you in a land called prayer and out there in that land called Perry said I see oh he said here you are you're kneeling beside your bed and and this is what you're praying about you see God he knows what you prayed about he knows your need and he comes to minister to you to let you know I have been here the whole time I'm not way out there I'm here the whole time I can sweeten I'm here to sweeten the experience let's just in here we could just keep preaching tonight to you and I only feel like I'm preaching and I feel like I'm my heart it's just you like we were sitting down in chairs and given counsel and that's how I feel on my heart hallelujah because let me say this to you as the musicians come the song that we sing through many dangers toils and snares I have already come what does it say His grace has brought me safe thus far
