[36:09] you find out when you done thought you
[36:11] made the too many mistakes in your life
[36:13] you know even as a Christian many times
[36:16] you let God down but you found out this
[36:19] blood never loses its power and I'm I'm
[36:22] a greater witness of that today than
[36:24] I've ever been before so we just praise
[36:27] God we thank him for all that he's done
[36:28] for us I want to say God bless you this
[36:30] morning good to see each one good to be
[36:32] with you again we want to thank the
[36:34] church many people have called her but
[36:36] interested that I've been sick just
[36:38] shortly after the last time I preached
[36:39] here and so we're doing much better by
[36:41] the grace of God he's still healer we
[36:43] still deliver and I just want to give
[36:45] him praise for that and so it's my
[36:51] privilege to stand before you this
[36:52] morning to minister once again
[36:53] appreciate the saints of God here and
[36:55] the Spirit of God in this place it's
[36:57] just always so it's just always really
[36:59] nice to be here with you all you know
[37:01] well I don't want to say a whole lot but
[37:02] you go some places you wonder where
[37:04] you're going sometimes but you know just
[37:06] as I was driving here this more I
[37:08] thought you know just like that song I
[37:09] haven't regretted a mile and so I
[37:10] appreciate the the ability to be here
[37:13] this morning and I'll probably get in
[37:15] trouble for this later but I couldn't do
[37:17] it without my wife Maria who's here she
[37:19] saw it raining her birthday today
[37:25] say a whole lot more I think she's
[37:27] glaring at me but she's been faithful
[37:30] all these years I actually actually met
[37:32] her at a birthday party I've been going
[37:35] to church the same churches her and I
[37:37] got invited and there's a whole story
[37:39] behind that maybe she'll tell you later
[37:41] because I preached a whole another
[37:43] sermon if I do that but one thing led to
[37:45] another and I'm thankful for a
[37:47] revelation of a godly wife brother
[37:50] Branham says the best thing God giving
[37:51] me an outside of salvation so we just
[37:53] thank God if you have your Bibles this
[37:55] morning we want to look into the book of
[37:56] Revelation the 22nd chapter amen the
[38:02] 22nd chapter here will read here for
[38:06] well just start in the sixth verse and
[38:09] we just think our Lord Jesus Christ he's
[38:14] been faithful to give us a message in
[38:15] this hour we don't have to wander about
[38:18] in the gross darkness of lair to see you
[38:20] wondering where we're at amen
[38:22] you know some people they got a map no
[38:24] compass and some people there they've
[38:25] got a compass and no mat but we've got
[38:27] the mechanics and the dynamics this
[38:29] morning we know who we are and why we're
[38:32] here is that right praise the Lord
[38:34] revelation the 22nd chapter in the sixth
[38:36] verse as an angel speaking to John it
[38:39] says and he said unto me these sayings
[38:42] are faithful and true and the Lord God
[38:45] of the Holy Prophets sent his angel to
[38:48] show unto his servants the things which
[38:50] must shortly be done verse 7 behold I
[38:54] come quickly blessed is he that keepeth
[38:56] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[38:58] and I John saw these things and heard
[39:01] them and when I had heard and seen I
[39:04] fell down to worship before the feet of
[39:06] the angel which showed me these things
[39:08] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[39:11] for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy
[39:15] brethren the prophets and of them which
[39:17] keep the sayings of this book worship
[39:20] God and he's safe let me seal not the
[39:23] sayings of the prophecy of this book why
[39:26] for the time is at hand he that is
[39:30] unjust let him be unjust still he which
[39:32] is filthy let him be filthy still and he
[39:35] that is right just
[39:36] be righteous still and he that is holy
[39:38] let him be holy still
[39:40] and behold I come quickly and my reward
[39:43] is with me to give every man according
[39:46] as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[39:50] Omega the beginning in the end the first
[39:54] and the last blessed are they that do
[39:57] His commandments that they may have
[39:59] rights think about that I have a right
[40:01] into it now right to the Tree of Life
[40:04] and may enter in through the gates into
[40:06] the city for without are dogs and
[40:10] sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers
[40:11] and idolaters and whosoever loveth and
[40:14] maketh a lie
[40:15] verse 16 here says I Jesus sent mine
[40:19] angel to testify unto you these things
[40:21] in the churches I am the root and the
[40:24] offspring of David and the bright and
[40:26] Morning Star and the spirit of the bride
[40:29] say come and let him that heareth say
[40:31] come and let him that is athirst come
[40:34] and whosoever will let him take of the
[40:36] water of life freely i wonder if we
[40:39] could just bow our heads this morning
[40:40] for word of Prayer our most gracious
[40:44] Heavenly Father we are so grateful to be
[40:46] gathered together this morning again and
[40:48] that name above every other name the
[40:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for those
[40:53] a promise given to us in the scripture
[40:55] that if two or three of us would gather
[40:57] together in that Ning he would be in our
[40:59] midst Lord we just pray now we just take
[41:01] this time and set aside and sanctify it
[41:04] to observe the resurrection not simply
[41:07] as an event 2000 years ago but as a life
[41:10] that is in us today as believers and lo
[41:13] were so grateful for a few not risen
[41:15] Lord our faith in our worship everything
[41:17] would be in vain we of all men will be
[41:19] most miserable this morning but we are
[41:22] so thankful that there is a living
[41:23] Savior today and that you live in your
[41:26] people and you've come now I believe by
[41:28] your promise to be in our midst Lord may
[41:31] you walk these aisles in the very
[41:33] corridors even of our hearts from every
[41:35] door and window now be open to you lure
[41:38] me you have preeminence in this service
[41:40] and in each life father may your warm
[41:43] our spirits and our souls by the power
[41:45] the presence
[41:46] of the Holy Ghost in fire and Lord may
[41:49] this not just be another time that we
[41:51] get together as human beings but may we
[41:53] be mindful that the king of kings and
[41:55] the Lord of lords has come into our
[41:57] presence and we have come before the
[41:59] feet of him that which made heaven and
[42:01] earth and Lord we just invite and we ask
[42:04] and we believe now and you would do
[42:06] mighty things arm it's supernatural
[42:08] things and I'm its father that you could
[42:10] do things in our myths that we ourselves
[42:13] as human beings we are not able to do
[42:15] with our own hands and our own Emmaus
[42:17] father there are situations in our lives
[42:20] today in this church that we have no
[42:22] answer for in our own a being or own
[42:25] ability we have no solution to the
[42:27] problems of life which beset us but I'm
[42:30] persuaded as the Apostle Paul said that
[42:33] you can do exceeding abundantly above
[42:35] anything that we could ask or even think
[42:38] this morning I'm I'm so thankful father
[42:41] I'm persuaded that you know each knee
[42:44] before we even ask so we have to pray
[42:46] now Lord you'd come and do that which is
[42:47] needful get yourself great glory and
[42:50] honor in the midst of these your
[42:52] children and we give you all the praise
[42:54] and glory for we ask it in the mighty
[42:56] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[42:58] and the church said Amen god bless yous
[43:01] you're seated today you know sometimes
[43:04] the devil will tell you you getting up
[43:05] and maybe you're just a little tired and
[43:07] body and well we better just go to
[43:08] church today and we better just do this
[43:10] but let's let's not just show up to
[43:12] church let's be the church today I want
[43:15] to remind you right now before I say
[43:17] another word I want to remind you right
[43:18] now that you are overcomers
[43:20] this Bible this book of Revelation is
[43:22] prophesied about you and your life you
[43:24] are the overcomers of this age you're
[43:26] the overcomers of darkness and of death
[43:28] and of sin so you've got a reason to be
[43:31] here today you've got to reach the
[43:33] testify and rejoice about them songs you
[43:35] sing today
[43:35] praise the Lord somebody I want to take
[43:38] this thought this morning from this book
[43:39] of revelation about catch the vision hey
[43:41] men catching the vision we look here in
[43:44] this scripture and we look at the angel
[43:47] he was told to seal not the sayings he
[43:49] told John still not the sayings of the
[43:52] prophecy of this book and the reason was
[43:54] because the time is at hand hey men we
[43:57] look at this Bible and
[43:59] we read another scripture routine here
[44:00] this morning Isaiah the 29th chapter he
[44:02] says in maybe it's the 28th I'm sorry
[44:05] but he says here in the ninth verse he
[44:06] says state yourselves and wonder and cry
[44:10] out and cry he says they are drunk you
[44:12] but not with wine they stagger but not
[44:15] with strong drink he says for the Lord
[44:16] has poured out upon you the spirit of
[44:19] deep sleep and has closed your eyes the
[44:22] prophets and your rulers the seers Hathi
[44:25] covered this isn't the vision of all's
[44:27] become unto you as the words of a book
[44:29] that is sealed and which men delivered
[44:32] to one that has learned saying read this
[44:34] I pray that he said I cannot for it is
[44:36] sealed notice your education cannot open
[44:38] this book a man handed to the line he
[44:42] said I can't read this it's sealed and
[44:43] the book is delivered to him that is not
[44:45] learned saying read this I pray thee he
[44:47] said I am not learned so notice whether
[44:49] you're an educated man or you're an
[44:51] uneducated person that doesn't give you
[44:53] any power or ability to read this book
[44:54] because the Spirit of deep sleep he said
[44:57] was poured out on them I believe we're
[44:58] living in the day and age where a spirit
[45:00] of deep sleep has been poured upon the
[45:02] people and they're drawing in gross
[45:04] darkness because they received not the
[45:06] love of the truth they should believe a
[45:08] lie and be damned to by it they go on
[45:10] deceiving and being deceived that's the
[45:12] spirit of this age they're like a boy
[45:14] brother Ram said walking through a
[45:15] graveyard whistling knowing that
[45:17] destruction is looming over the bed of
[45:19] any moment on atomic bomb or some
[45:21] disaster could strike we're there and
[45:24] yet they go on to their lives haphazard
[45:26] willfully ignorant of what is going on
[45:29] but I'm so thankful that a light has
[45:31] come to us and you're not at them that
[45:33] sleep in the night or them that a
[45:35] drunken is their drunken in the night
[45:36] but you are the children of the day and
[45:38] you were the children of the light and
[45:40] the light has come upon you and the
[45:42] Bible says arise and shine for thy light
[45:44] has come we're not asleep but something
[45:47] has awakened in this bride the Bible
[45:50] says the lake unto righteousness and
[45:52] then hallelujah somebody well praise the
[45:55] Lord and that will happen in this day
[45:57] you found out you never did it in the
[45:59] first place we found that you were
[46:02] always a child of God but you were
[46:04] asleep you were ignorant of it but a lot
[46:06] of voices come and it scared you out of
[46:08] the slum
[46:09] and on the spirit of deep sleep and he's
[46:12] giving you a vision of a book that was
[46:13] closed to the world yet it's been open
[46:16] to an elected people there's a chosen
[46:20] people I believe I'm preaching to him
[46:21] today there's a chosen people on this
[46:24] earth that they've been handing the book
[46:25] revelation 10 they've been handed a book
[46:27] not that a seal not that is close but an
[46:30] open book has been handed to the people
[46:33] of God well praise the Lord somebody
[46:36] that's pretty good now like this book
[46:38] this Bible we talked about it's a book
[46:40] of dispensations where the RAM preaches
[46:42] not Amen you look at the book of the
[46:44] prophet Daniel and he like the Apostle
[46:46] John he saw a vision of the kingdoms of
[46:48] the Gentiles and of the end time and
[46:50] what was he told to do he say he was
[46:52] told to seal these things up is that
[46:55] right well uh Daniel chapter 12 he says
[46:58] here in the fourth verse but Thou O
[46:59] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[47:02] book even to the time of the end many
[47:05] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[47:07] be increased verse 9 and he said go away
[47:10] Daniel for the words are closed up and
[47:12] sealed till the time of the end now I
[47:17] want you to consider this even brother
[47:19] Brandon himself as a prophet he would
[47:21] see a vision perhaps he'd be in a room
[47:22] and he sees somebody sick laying on the
[47:24] bed and he's seen a hat sitting on
[47:26] television in a certain place and a
[47:27] certain person standing in the corner
[47:29] and he would see a vision of something
[47:31] that was going to come to pass and this
[47:33] prophet now this is an anointed prophet
[47:35] a man of God a man that has prayed for
[47:37] the sick and seen miracles that prophet
[47:40] for all who was calling and all his
[47:42] ability to pray he could pray for that
[47:43] boy till he was blue in the face he
[47:46] could fast he could pray and he could he
[47:48] could muster up all the faith that was
[47:50] in him and yet it was for an appointed
[47:52] time no matter how much he prayed amen
[47:55] no matter how much he sought God or how
[47:58] much he desired to see this boy made
[48:00] well yet there was an appointed time for
[48:02] it and the vision show what the time of
[48:05] it was to all of his faith let me say
[48:08] this that boys America was sealed up in
[48:10] that vision it was sealed not measured
[48:13] but when the time it would come to pass
[48:14] praise the Lord somebody what everything
[48:17] was in its place let me say this this
[48:20] book of the body this book of
[48:21] elation when everything is in its place
[48:23] when all the prophecies have become
[48:26] fulfilled and the time for these things
[48:27] is at hand is that right a prophet of
[48:29] God has told us he sees nothing
[48:31] they'll hinder the coming of the Lord
[48:32] outside of the readiness of his church
[48:34] listen all the pieces are in their place
[48:37] although all the hats and all the people
[48:40] everything is lying that this is what
[48:42] the prophet Daniel saw this is what John
[48:44] saw Isle of Patmos the things that they
[48:47] saw look kings and priests desire to see
[48:50] the things you see they prayed they saw
[48:53] them quite diligently seeking the manner
[48:55] of things which you have today the
[48:59] things we take for granted let me say
[49:00] that way sometimes we let this message
[49:03] sit on the shelf and collect dust we
[49:05] don't listen the tapes like we used to
[49:06] and we don't listen the prophets message
[49:08] like we used to and we don't seem to
[49:10] have the prayer life we used to have to
[49:11] and the things that we let sit idle the
[49:14] things that we let set collect dust or
[49:16] the things that they sought diligently
[49:18] for they leaned on their side and they
[49:20] fast and they were imprisoned and they
[49:22] suffered wanting to see the things we
[49:25] get to see some freely but what was it
[49:27] it wasn't the time for those things
[49:29] they were should've went to the time of
[49:31] the end
[49:32] that's why nature could come here in the
[49:34] book of Revelation and unseal the buck
[49:37] he can testify this book is open don't
[49:40] seal up the sayings of the prophecy of
[49:42] this book why pour the time is it
[49:44] hurting I want you to think about that
[49:48] as much as you could pray as much as you
[49:50] seek God you had no power to bring that
[49:52] vision to pass in your own strength but
[49:54] once it come to pass there was nothing
[49:57] you could do to stop it from happening
[49:59] but the RAM said if I knew that George
[50:02] Washington was gonna raise from the dead
[50:04] tomorrow he would call the world to see
[50:06] cuz it's not home ah huh help me out
[50:09] somebody there's not enough Devils in
[50:11] hell this stop it from coming to pass
[50:13] once God has given the vision he said
[50:17] what's that got to do with me I want you
[50:19] to think God saw you before the
[50:21] foundation Lord oh he saw people at the
[50:23] end time he saw a church without spot
[50:26] without blemish
[50:28] look he didn't see much you defeated
[50:30] people
[50:30] miss Elaina Dacia groping about trying
[50:33] to escape the wretchedness this robbery
[50:35] made a way of escape for you you're not
[50:40] be defeated today you're the victorious
[50:42] you're more than conquerors through him
[50:44] that loved you listen God saw things
[50:48] about you before you knew who you are we
[50:52] still don't know who we are like we
[50:53] ought to know it but one thing is for
[50:55] sure God knows who you are he knows
[50:57] exactly all about you he knows exactly
[50:59] where you come from
[51:01] you didn't come from from Ohio or from
[51:03] some country somewhere or some other
[51:06] state you come from God and you're going
[51:09] back to God he knows exactly all about
[51:11] it he knows exactly what he's called you
[51:13] to and when he placed you him had when
[51:17] he placed his seed in this end time he
[51:20] had all the confidence that it would
[51:23] fulfill his purpose his word does not go
[51:25] forth void and shall not return unto Him
[51:28] void it shall accomplish right here this
[51:32] morning in this building he shall
[51:34] accomplish his purpose in this place in
[51:37] real life because you're the children of
[51:39] God you're the seed of Abraham in Christ
[51:44] well praise the Lord
[51:46] look you have no power look you have no
[51:48] power to bring these things to pass on
[51:50] your home you can't make yourself a
[51:52] child of God you can't make yourself
[51:54] anointed you can't make you something
[51:56] Taurus but praise God he's already done
[51:59] that for you and listen if he is home ah
[52:01] if he has done that for you how could
[52:04] you stop it now listen it's enough
[52:08] devils and how to stop it
[52:09] what makes you think your mistakes would
[52:11] stop it what makes you think your family
[52:13] could stop it what makes you think your
[52:15] job can stop it
[52:16] what makes you think sickness can stop
[52:17] it look you can't stop it you you're
[52:21] savvy said I've done made a mistake I
[52:22] didn't fail God listen Paul said I'm
[52:24] persuaded there's no height or depth
[52:26] there's no width of breath there's no
[52:28] prints of pouty or power or men or
[52:31] angels nothing shall separate us from
[52:34] the love of God which is in Christ
[52:37] that includes you yourself that include
[52:41] you listen you're your biggest enemy
[52:44] let's be honest now the devil's not your
[52:47] biggest enemy William Brown sir my
[52:49] biggest enemies William Branham I know
[52:51] some people didn't think William
[52:53] branham's their biggest enemy but he's
[52:54] not random
[53:01] you're your own biggest enemy your own
[53:03] unbelief and your own problems and your
[53:06] own faults and your past your failures
[53:08] that's all stuff on you that's stuff you
[53:10] brought to the table but praise God the
[53:13] blood of Jesus Christ it's greater than
[53:15] all your sin it's greater than the
[53:17] family you come out of it's greater than
[53:19] your past it's greater than what you did
[53:22] this morning because many times we start
[53:28] out in faith and man and after a while
[53:32] if we're not careful we get back into
[53:33] what we're trying to do for God Paul
[53:36] said having me on the spirity not made
[53:37] perfect in the flesh a man well praise
[53:41] the Lord listen many times if we're not
[53:43] careful we failed to see what God is
[53:45] doing hey man the prophet of God to see
[53:50] a vision I want to think about this talk
[53:51] about the vision being unsealed this
[53:52] Bible this book of Revelation for 1,900
[53:55] years like overnight - 30 years it was a
[53:57] book of prophecy that was sealed this
[53:59] Bible had prophecies that were sealed
[54:01] but it was ordained at a certain time
[54:03] and that's the sayings of prophecy in
[54:05] this book the same one that John was
[54:07] told to seal was gonna be open hey man
[54:10] the same thing that was seen at one time
[54:13] now listen not only wasn't sealed I want
[54:15] you to think about this not only was it
[54:17] sealed he was told not to open it but in
[54:20] this time that is prophesied not only
[54:23] would be open you're not to shut it
[54:25] because listen when God opens the door
[54:27] no man can shut it
[54:28] whom God shuts a door no man can open it
[54:30] and many times we're guilty of trying to
[54:32] open doors that got a shot or many times
[54:35] we're trying to show her I was hoping
[54:37] trying to bring us our will to pass
[54:39] instead of his but listen you listen
[54:42] once it's once it's been told is that
[54:44] right once it's been foretold it has to
[54:46] come to pass
[54:47] so this book is a book of prophecy the
[54:50] book the first chapter tells you the
[54:51] same thing it's a book of prophecy is
[54:53] that right because there are certain
[54:54] seasons in the writing of itself there
[54:57] is a time that it testifies of that this
[55:00] would no longer be sealed I say what are
[55:01] you coming to you brother how would you
[55:03] know the hour how does a man supposed to
[55:06] know the hour when this is no longer
[55:07] sealed it's been sealed for thousands of
[55:10] years what pieces have to be in place
[55:12] for this to be open well the Bible tells
[55:15] you in this last chapter what was gonna
[55:16] happen
[55:17] praise the Lord the 16 verse tells you
[55:19] that Jesus was gonna send his angel to
[55:22] testify of the saint now I'm not seven
[55:25] angels like in at the beginning but one
[55:27] angel is going to testify of the things
[55:29] in the churches you think about a man
[55:32] like Martin Luther John Wesley the
[55:34] different messages they themselves
[55:35] didn't know who they were as I you know
[55:39] Martin Luther didn't sail upon the fifth
[55:41] church age messenger praise God look at
[55:43] me he didn't know his own hour there was
[55:47] an angel that was going to come and
[55:48] testify who this man was
[55:50] and who this person was of the church
[55:53] and the season and the time of it and he
[55:54] would show you the things that have
[55:56] happened in the churches amen praise the
[55:59] Lord think about that now he didn't I
[56:02] mean I don't get in trouble here but I
[56:04] want you to just think about this for a
[56:05] second he said I'm gonna send you an
[56:06] angel not angels not to not some seventh
[56:11] and an eighth messenger not some extra
[56:13] thing one angel sent to this time at the
[56:16] end time one angel in the hand of God is
[56:19] sent to testify the book is no longer
[56:21] closed it's open if you're gonna send
[56:24] him and testify under who under you who
[56:28] is you that's me
[56:30] present Lord some money I saw myself in
[56:33] the vision I'm part of it I caught the
[56:36] vision he was sent Elijah was sent to
[56:38] who on the air who is you that's me
[56:42] let me say that's me if you can receive
[56:45] it this is that Elijah that was to come
[56:49] look we've received in angels that I
[56:51] praise the Lord I'm getting ahead of
[56:53] myself here a little bit hey man but
[56:55] let's understand this angel was not
[56:56] Gabriel or one wormwood or something
[56:59] like that John saw this angel and I want
[57:01] you to think about the Ministry of this
[57:03] angel was so great John father worship
[57:06] the angel John hood walked with Christ
[57:09] and seen the gift and seen the power of
[57:11] Messiah when he saw this angel he fell
[57:15] to worship praise the Lord and yet what
[57:19] you say don't do is I'm a fellow servant
[57:22] I'm not above thy brethren the prophets
[57:26] homie how somebody this angel is not
[57:29] some cherubim somewhere this is his
[57:31] brother this is a man a prophet of his
[57:34] brethren said to him and what do the
[57:37] angel declare worship God in the midst
[57:41] of Satan's even when they're worshiping
[57:43] Satan ignorantly worship in the church
[57:46] worship in traditions and angels come to
[57:49] restore worship to God
[57:52] this is your prophet messenger has come
[57:55] to bring the people back to the worship
[57:57] of God to testify that the book is open
[58:01] I don't know who you think that is but
[58:03] let me tell you who I think it is
[58:05] because there ain't no two angels there
[58:07] was one angel set the prophesied sent to
[58:10] tell you the seals are open
[58:11] will you man better them you see have
[58:16] you know the time is at hand and God
[58:18] sent an angel to you they testified this
[58:21] is the time for these things it's not
[58:24] for another day it's not for next week
[58:27] it's right now praise the Lord God sent
[58:37] his angel under John is half of the rod
[58:40] God sent a messenger then announced the
[58:44] book is open hey man that's why I could
[58:47] say we've been handed an open book we
[58:49] know that from the book of the
[58:50] revelation the tenth chapter the book is
[58:52] no longer sealed and I think it's
[58:54] interesting because the angel the same
[58:56] angel that testifies a book is open and
[58:59] not sealed you have things
[59:01] the people now don't seal up the sayings
[59:05] of the prophecy this book
[59:06] in other words there's gonna be a people
[59:08] that said now that book still closed we
[59:10] don't need to hear those things we're
[59:12] waiting for another age we're waiting
[59:13] for somebody else to come and finish
[59:14] doing that but listen they ancient and
[59:16] open the book Christ up from the books
[59:19] angels just testified it's already open
[59:22] only one angel was promised to tell you
[59:25] about the opening of it and now let me
[59:27] say this in the day and age where people
[59:28] trying to tell you that this book is
[59:30] still sealed let me tell you this she'll
[59:32] not the sayings of the prophecy of this
[59:34] book why because they are faithful and
[59:38] they are true many people say many
[59:40] things about this message but let me
[59:42] testify to you this morning the sayings
[59:44] of His Prophet and the sayings of must
[59:46] set the Lord that we've got on tape
[59:48] today they are faithful and they're true
[59:52] cuz listen it's not just you not the
[59:54] book you said not the sayings of this
[59:56] book why is that probably as God neither
[59:59] had tape recorders nowadays that's why
[1:00:02] it's the sayings it's the spoken word
[1:00:03] that was just spoken by the Prophet
[1:00:06] Malachi far don't see it a lot the
[1:00:09] sayings of the prophecy of this book
[1:00:15] think about that and haha probably says
[1:00:18] this and the rising of the Sun you
[1:00:20] alright this morning I tell you what I'm
[1:00:22] feeling pretty good already I feel like
[1:00:24] I've been caught up I feel like I used
[1:00:28] to live in North Nash me up it's like I
[1:00:32] tell you what Shh

[1:00:38] till a few years ago when I started
[1:00:39] traveling abroad man I tell you what I
[1:00:41] never thought I'd fly like that that
[1:00:42] seemed like something other people will
[1:00:43] do cuz I just a hillbilly just a nobody
[1:00:45] but now I float in the air
[1:00:47] and you get up love them clouds and
[1:00:49] things things on this earth seems so
[1:00:51] small some insignificant mean you can't
[1:00:53] even see past the clouds at the time it
[1:00:55] seems so insignificant at that height
[1:00:57] Amen I just feel this one just to tell
[1:01:00] you I've got caught in such a place with
[1:01:02] the trials that I used to have my life
[1:01:03] and the things that used to bother me
[1:01:05] and the things that used to play me they
[1:01:06] seem so insignificant from where I'm
[1:01:08] sitting now you say what do you mean
[1:01:11] brother I was in the power of art you

[1:01:21] the power of darkness in the kingdom of

[1:01:50] today that you were seated far above all
[1:01:53] principality and power and might and
[1:01:55] Dominion today no reason you ever notice
[1:01:59] it's because you look down hey man so
[1:02:02] looking at the author and finisher your
[1:02:03] faith so look at what the word has said
[1:02:05] many times we look at circumstances and
[1:02:07] trials and we look at those things and
[1:02:10] we miss what God is doing amen but

[1:07:43] he talks about Christ the mystery how
[1:07:44] will let our family will let our job or
[1:07:47] wife or husband we let so many things
[1:07:49] keep the revelation from us none of us
[1:07:53] here we things we let the cares of life
[1:07:59] come up and keep revelation look God is
[1:08:02] trying to give you revelation whatever
[1:08:04] you're going through this morning
[1:08:05] whatever your situation is in your life
[1:08:07] the answer to your problem and the
[1:08:09] answer to your needs is a greater
[1:08:11] revelation of what God has already done
[1:08:13] for you there's nothing he can do for
[1:08:16] you this morning that he hasn't already
[1:08:17] done every man calling every word he's
[1:08:20] ever testify to you every thought he's
[1:08:22] ever had in you he had before there's
[1:08:24] one speck of dust before there was a
[1:08:27] star in the sky before you troubled
[1:08:29] before your trials before everything you
[1:08:31] went through in your life he had a
[1:08:32] thought about you and that thought is
[1:08:34] going to come to pass and the question
[1:08:37] today it's not is the thought true
[1:08:40] that's not the problem the questions do
[1:08:43] we know what the thought is do we know
[1:08:47] what God has said about us or we're more
[1:08:49] we worried about what somebody else has
[1:08:50] said about us many times weeks on our
[1:08:54] own opinion even you say not me I'm not
[1:08:58] arrogant like that oh really
[1:09:01] what about well I'm no good God don't
[1:09:04] love me and he loves these people more
[1:09:05] than mean and God can't do that for me
[1:09:07] that's just as arrogant as saying you're
[1:09:08] somebody better everybody else that's
[1:09:12] just as arrogant who God has said
[1:09:14] something about you he said you're holy
[1:09:16] he said you're bladeless he said you're
[1:09:19] accepted in the beloved he's not call
[1:09:21] you up
[1:09:22] and weakness and doubt they call you to
[1:09:25] give you power and courage and ability
[1:09:31] Godin cost the backup on Devils he calls
[1:09:34] to cast him out many times women many
[1:09:39] times we make room for him we'll get a
[1:09:42] little guest bed for him in a house or
[1:09:43] we'll make a place for him you think of
[1:09:45] the maniac he Portland brother REM dealt
[1:09:47] with when he cast the spirit on that
[1:09:48] great big man that was gonna crush him
[1:09:50] and the police officer asked him is he
[1:09:51] gonna be all right
[1:09:52] he said no to come back because he loves
[1:09:54] that devil many times we love on Devil's
[1:09:59] we don't realize because we give pet
[1:10:01] names like depression and anxiety and
[1:10:03] diabetes and sickness well I was just
[1:10:06] born with this I'm just I just made this
[1:10:08] way yeah but you're born again look that
[1:10:17] power that first birth has no power over
[1:10:20] the believer
[1:10:21] they've been circumcised are separated
[1:10:23] from the flesh that's not who you are
[1:10:26] anymore
[1:10:27] in fact it's never who you were in the
[1:10:29] first place how much you think about
[1:10:35] this when God speaks when God opened
[1:10:37] this book he'd give it a voice hey man
[1:10:40] when God opened the book of your life
[1:10:41] he'd give you a voice think about that
[1:10:43] you were the voice of God to this age
[1:10:47] the spirit and the body say something
[1:10:50] they're saying this having the final
[1:10:52] messenger said they're same comes all
[1:10:54] right you've got a voice
[1:10:57] oh my somebody help me out here I just
[1:11:00] know I don't even know how to convey
[1:11:01] death and life are in the power of your
[1:11:04] tongue not just bent on your tongue your
[1:11:09] tongue has the power of life and death
[1:11:11] in it and the things you say about your
[1:11:14] own life can defeat you amen
[1:11:19] listen you'll never rise above your own
[1:11:21] confession so what it comes down to you
[1:11:24] never rise above your own confession
[1:11:25] you've got to confess if you believe
[1:11:27] this book is open if you believe this is
[1:11:29] the time for it if you believe that
[1:11:31] quickening powers come then you've got
[1:11:33] to confess that it's for me
[1:11:36] the seals have been open to me
[1:11:38] quickening powers come to me listen has
[1:11:42] got to be for a person many times we
[1:11:46] read these things we look at these
[1:11:47] things we know they're true but we're
[1:11:50] not careful to acknowledge that true for
[1:11:51] us that's why we should catch the vision
[1:11:54] of it today because the vision has been
[1:11:56] presented whether you like it or not
[1:11:58] whether you believe it or not the seals
[1:11:59] are open the word has come the word has
[1:12:02] been open the power of God is here
[1:12:04] whether you like it or not the question
[1:12:07] is what will you do with this Christ
[1:12:09] what are you gonna do with it I tell you
[1:12:15] why there's a time this is that right
[1:12:17] the Bible says here in the book of Acts
[1:12:19] the Apostle Peter prophesied to the
[1:12:21] people there in the book of Acts the 3rd
[1:12:23] chapter he says repent ye therefore and
[1:12:24] be converted that your sins may be
[1:12:27] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[1:12:28] shall come from the presence of the Lord
[1:12:31] and he shall send Jesus Christ which
[1:12:34] before was preached unto you whom the
[1:12:36] heaven must receive until the times of
[1:12:38] restitution of all things which God has
[1:12:41] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[1:12:43] prophets since the world began
[1:12:47] he's gonna send Jesus to somebody he
[1:12:51] didn't come to them he's gonna come to
[1:12:53] somebody he's gonna come at the time of
[1:12:55] the restitution of all things praise the
[1:12:58] Lord I want to look at this word for a
[1:13:01] moment here this time as the Bible says
[1:13:03] here in the nineteenth verse the times
[1:13:04] of refreshing you know what that word
[1:13:06] refreshing it's a Greek it's a it's a
[1:13:08] Greek word annex obsess I think is how
[1:13:10] you say it I'm not a Greek scholar but
[1:13:13] it's an exception it means a revival
[1:13:16] what it literally means is the recovery
[1:13:19] of breath in other words you resuscitate
[1:13:21] somebody they start breathing if they
[1:13:23] were dying listen God took the people
[1:13:26] that were dead in sins and trespasses
[1:13:28] and he'd give them revival listen this
[1:13:32] is not a national revival but it's a
[1:13:34] bride's revival it's for you
[1:13:37] why because the power has come so you're
[1:13:41] either looking for a revival or you've
[1:13:43] got a revival
[1:13:45] you've got a recovery of breath think
[1:13:47] about that now breath has come in the
[1:13:49] you look at the book the Hebrew word for
[1:13:51] breath or spirits the same with a rock
[1:13:53] it means the breath when when God
[1:13:55] breathed anatomy breathed the breath of
[1:13:57] life or the action of the breath of
[1:13:58] lives is how it is in the Hebrew but the
[1:14:00] breath of life into him and he became a
[1:14:02] living soul
[1:14:03] but we've received an atom that last
[1:14:06] time a quickening or a life-giving or a
[1:14:08] reviving spirit hey man you think of a
[1:14:12] zq brother then he just touches on this
[1:14:14] in Christ the mystery a little bit but
[1:14:15] you think about Ezekiel in the bath of
[1:14:17] the dry bones when it come to the valley
[1:14:19] of the dry bones he saw he saw death
[1:14:21] everywhere
[1:14:22] he's so confusion that there was nothing
[1:14:25] there that was together and yet that
[1:14:28] prophet he prophesied God asking the
[1:14:31] question can these bones live he said
[1:14:33] Lord you know we said God you know and
[1:14:40] God give him something said I want you
[1:14:41] to prophesy over these dry bones that
[1:14:44] they would come together and God begin
[1:14:47] to form bodies an invincible armor he he
[1:14:50] put him out of the Methodist he pulled
[1:14:52] on the back test of the Pentecostal he
[1:14:54] put a lot of bootleggers joints and and
[1:14:55] back alleys and drug addiction and and
[1:14:58] sin and darkness and what did he do he
[1:15:01] form the body heaven he craved himself a
[1:15:06] body and army and it stood upright on
[1:15:08] its feet so we're not laying down today
[1:15:11] we're standing upright and it's been a
[1:15:15] symbol by the power of prophecy look
[1:15:19] your life from the very time before you
[1:15:21] even born your life was guided by
[1:15:24] prophecy your ancestors survived death
[1:15:28] and darkness because they were guided
[1:15:30] but prophesy over your life and you've
[1:15:37] come to place a prophet is prophesied
[1:15:39] and assembled a body but listen
[1:15:41] Redemption is two parts there's a going
[1:15:43] on to coming in hey man he has assembled
[1:15:46] a body but it was necessary that he
[1:15:49] would prophesy again why for an annex
[1:15:53] oopss for the recovery of breath to
[1:15:56] enter into the body
[1:15:57] I believe Jones told the prophesy again
[1:16:00] for a reason I knew that's why we're
[1:16:02] here this morning we're hearing the same
[1:16:05] word of life that was spoken 40 years
[1:16:07] ago 50 years ago been prophesied right
[1:16:10] now oh he's brought you from places
[1:16:13] he's cognitive darkness but now life is
[1:16:16] coming into the body what is it doing
[1:16:17] quickening the body what for for the
[1:16:20] changing of a body listen you've not
[1:16:23] been called hallelujah to be defeated
[1:16:25] you've been called for a rapture how's
[1:16:33] the rapture gonna come to pass a
[1:16:34] quickening power he's gonna take this
[1:16:38] vile body and change into a body lacking
[1:16:41] in his own the scripture says now listen
[1:16:47] there's three parts that go with that
[1:16:49] that rapture what's that first part
[1:16:51] there's a shout what did it do the same
[1:16:53] thing as Eagles dry bones did it call
[1:16:55] the people to a rapture I believe it's
[1:16:58] going on right now the world has an idea
[1:17:00] about the rapture they didn't get ideas
[1:17:03] about they make fun where's the promise
[1:17:05] of his coming
[1:17:06] not realizing he's here it was taking
[1:17:11] place they're looking for planes to fall
[1:17:13] on the sky her earthquakes are blood
[1:17:15] moons but I've received my last sign the
[1:17:18] Angels testified to me the book is open
[1:17:23] the time is at hand I don't need some
[1:17:27] sort of job some divinity or whatever
[1:17:30] this the divination are all this other
[1:17:31] nonsense I've received my last sign I'm
[1:17:34] not looking for it
[1:17:35] he came to me he came to me I couldn't
[1:17:39] find him so he sent me Elijah why the
[1:17:45] recover breath they give a life to
[1:17:48] revive me out of blackness why because
[1:17:52] he's ordained that his people in this
[1:17:54] hour would be an invincible army
[1:17:58] now if you're an invincible army that
[1:18:01] means there's nothing that can defeat
[1:18:02] you I wonder so many times why we live
[1:18:10] in defeat we're not called to it you
[1:18:13] know I don't like to give the double
[1:18:15] credit but I'll say one thing he's a
[1:18:16] good adversary you know he knows he's
[1:18:20] going to lose because the book of his
[1:18:22] lives and his time has also been in
[1:18:25] Ceylon
[1:18:26] he's a bluff he's a liar he's defeated
[1:18:29] he can't touch you he can't do anything
[1:18:31] new without God's permission he is
[1:18:33] defeated he's the biggest loser in all
[1:18:36] creation and yet every day he fights you
[1:18:41] like you're losing the biggest loser
[1:18:44] that's ever been and he fights like a
[1:18:46] winner to the end and here we are
[1:18:52] ordained a victory ordained to glory or
[1:18:55] didn't rain with him and we can
[1:18:57] discouraged by little things listen you
[1:18:59] be called to something greater you've
[1:19:01] not been ordained than the wrath but our
[1:19:03] salvation by Jesus Christ let's start
[1:19:06] acting like we got victory let's fight
[1:19:08] like we're winning let's press this
[1:19:13] battle look you don't even have to win
[1:19:15] Christ either victory it's time to get
[1:19:22] up your loins like a mat hand and start
[1:19:24] fighting the devil but let them push you
[1:19:28] around and bully in your home so I'll
[1:19:30] take your children I'll I'll do some of
[1:19:31] them
[1:19:32] no devil I got a token I'm gonna take
[1:19:36] your house I'm gonna I'm gonna take your
[1:19:37] help from you and I'll flicked you you
[1:19:39] can't serve God no devil by his straps
[1:19:42] I'm already healed look the Bible says
[1:19:46] resist the devil he will flee from you
[1:19:49] that's why he bothers some of you so
[1:19:51] much you just need to tell them what's
[1:19:53] what well so Jesus did well if your son
[1:19:59] God if your daughter God do this do that
[1:20:01] get behind me Satan it is written of me
[1:20:06] look we know is written about Christ
[1:20:09] what's written about him let the devil
[1:20:12] know where you are look when he defeated
[1:20:14] Satan he defeat him with the Word of God
[1:20:16] the same word that you got in front of
[1:20:19] you this morning
[1:20:20] three times he defeated Satan with us
[1:20:23] saith the Lord and this bride she has
[1:20:26] thus saith the Lord and she knows what
[1:20:31] God wants double head hey man I want to
[1:20:35] encourage you this morning be defeated
[1:20:36] I gotta sent you a message for a reason
[1:20:39] he has sent you revival and listen just
[1:20:42] Jesus testified with this with this
[1:20:44] angel when he comes in this last chapter
[1:20:46] here he said surely I come quickly now
[1:20:52] you think about that Peter talked about
[1:20:55] there'd be scoffers in the last days
[1:20:57] like I was just talkin my mama go they
[1:20:59] say where's the promise of his coming he
[1:21:00] understood there was a time coming where
[1:21:03] they would make fun of the coming of the
[1:21:05] Lord say well all things have continued
[1:21:07] as they DAP since the fathers began well
[1:21:10] he said he was coming quickly
[1:21:11] that was almost 2000 years ago your God
[1:21:14] has a funny sense of time
[1:21:15] ah but see that's not what God said he
[1:21:19] didn't say at the beginning the book I'm
[1:21:21] coming quickly I'm gonna let that sink
[1:21:24] for just a second there he man he says
[1:21:27] in this last chapter three times he says
[1:21:29] behold I come quickly when is he coming
[1:21:31] quickly not in the Ephesian age that's
[1:21:34] Smyrna a man not these other ages but
[1:21:38] when this angel comes and the book is
[1:21:41] open he says now I'm coming quickly
[1:21:44] the mighty angels lift up his heads at
[1:21:46] time shall be no more in other words
[1:21:49] there will be no more delay so there was
[1:21:52] a delay in the church ages but in that
[1:21:55] breech in this time in the end that's
[1:21:58] when he comes he says now I come quickly
[1:22:01] surely behold now I come quickly I want
[1:22:05] you understand the promise of his coming
[1:22:06] when he said I'm coming quickly what's
[1:22:08] not for Daniels age it wasn't for John's
[1:22:10] age it wasn't even for Wesley's age it
[1:22:12] was for this bride at this time you're
[1:22:15] the ones he's coming quickly to her
[1:22:19] that's why I said he cut the work the
[1:22:21] work short he said that he was short in
[1:22:23] the days let's no flesh would be saved
[1:22:25] listen you're you're in a good time to
[1:22:27] be a Christian this is the most glorious
[1:22:30] hour for you to be a Christian because
[1:22:32] this is the time of his company you say
[1:22:35] how do you know the angel told me my
[1:22:37] Eliezer told me that my Isaac's just
[1:22:40] over the next hill this is the time of
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:44] praise the Lord somebody a book of
[1:22:48] ezekiel here in the 12th chapter verse
[1:22:50] 21
[1:22:50] this is in the word lord came to me
[1:22:52] saying son of man and what is that
[1:22:54] proverb that they have in the land of
[1:22:55] israel saying the days are prolonged and
[1:22:57] every vision Fairless notice they had a
[1:22:58] proverb oh god don't bring things to
[1:23:00] pass that's what they said about God in
[1:23:02] them days
[1:23:03] he says tell them therefore I want to
[1:23:05] tell the devil this morning thus said
[1:23:08] the Lord I will make this proverb
[1:23:09] decease and they shall no more use it as
[1:23:13] a proverb in Israel but saying in the
[1:23:14] days are at hand and the effect of every
[1:23:17] vision notice the effect of a vision is
[1:23:20] coming to pass because now the time is
[1:23:22] at hand and they might make fun today
[1:23:26] they might say things about you today
[1:23:28] but I want you understand and as Louis
[1:23:30] maybe three and a half years you'll be
[1:23:32] sitting on the other side of this just
[1:23:36] think of if the law were to translate in
[1:23:38] the next 40 days from today I'm just
[1:23:41] three and a half years time you'll be
[1:23:43] raining it's kings and priests on the
[1:23:45] earth well actually you do that now if
[1:23:48] you understand that your spiritual kings
[1:23:51] of the spiritual dominion you're now
[1:23:53] kings and priests unto God look God is
[1:23:57] not ordained to be the tail but the head
[1:23:59] that arises the Bible says you're not
[1:24:02] the tail you're not the defeated you're
[1:24:04] not the weak when you're not the slave
[1:24:05] you're the ruler you're the master
[1:24:07] you're the King you're a priest over the
[1:24:09] powers of darkness hey man listen the
[1:24:13] Bible says God is not slack and some men
[1:24:15] count slackness but is long-suffering to
[1:24:18] us-ward him
[1:24:21] look I think God he didn't come back in
[1:24:23] that day I wouldn't be here God is
[1:24:26] long-suffering and many times we get
[1:24:28] impatient we wonder what is God doing
[1:24:29] God still saving maybe you got lost
[1:24:33] loved ones God still saving God still
[1:24:37] has mercy you say I've gone through
[1:24:41] things I wish I could just go home maybe
[1:24:42] God has a purpose for you being here but
[1:24:44] let me testify he's still a healer he's
[1:24:47] still deliverer
[1:24:48] our God's not changed his arms not
[1:24:51] latched short that it cannot say his
[1:24:54] ears not growing heavy that it cannot
[1:24:55] hear he's the same he's the Lord God he
[1:24:58] changes not mom listen many people when
[1:25:04] they think that God is d this is the
[1:25:05] thing many people may think God is
[1:25:07] linked they begin to delay amen I was
[1:25:11] talking to brother about this in Africa
[1:25:12] a few years back he was saying I really
[1:25:14] liked it
[1:25:14] he said procrastination is the thief of
[1:25:17] time
[1:25:18] procrastination many times we
[1:25:20] procrastinate because we think my Lord
[1:25:23] dr. Lilly is coming remember the story
[1:25:25] of the wicked and slothful servant he
[1:25:27] said my Lords delayed is coming he
[1:25:29] didn't realize his Lord was coming
[1:25:31] and so he began to beat the other
[1:25:33] servants and become drunken notice what
[1:25:35] happens to a man that loses his vision
[1:25:38] for the coming of the Lord he falls into
[1:25:40] worldliness and drunkenness and malice
[1:25:45] Shh and what it's done it's stolen from
[1:25:49] us our brother Matt talks about being
[1:25:52] dilatory being billet Orry
[1:25:53] procrastinating hasn't been ever we have
[1:25:55] any procrastinators in here I hope not
[1:25:57] huh yes and last because somebody knows
[1:26:01] some procrastinators well I used to be
[1:26:04] real bad about it used to be
[1:26:07] hopefully not anymore amen well I'll get
[1:26:11] this thing hung up honey don't worry six
[1:26:12] months later I'm trying to figure I'm
[1:26:13] gonna hang this thing up well you know
[1:26:17] how that goes many times we make plans
[1:26:20] and we don't know what we're gonna do
[1:26:21] tomorrow let alone six months little
[1:26:23] year from now but one thing is sure the
[1:26:25] coming of the Lord is here our Lord has
[1:26:28] spoken he's declared a shop now's not
[1:26:30] the time to
[1:26:31] mastodons God because it will steal your
[1:26:36] spiritual life it's still your joy yes
[1:26:39] to your victory and you'll sit there
[1:26:40] waiting for God to do something when
[1:26:43] God's already done something for you and
[1:26:45] you've missed it my balance isn't a
[1:26:47] third axis when they're in the Loess
[1:26:48] they were waiting on God and the Prophet
[1:26:51] said God was waiting on them I just I
[1:26:55] just kind of think maybe this morning
[1:26:57] God's waiting on some lot still to grow
[1:26:59] up and show up and be sons and daughters
[1:27:01] of God like we were called to be and
[1:27:04] quit playing games in church and quite
[1:27:06] waiting for God to push us through a pot
[1:27:07] when God is already declared things
[1:27:09] about you and the visions already been
[1:27:11] open to you let's not play games let's
[1:27:14] not sit on God this morning let's give
[1:27:17] God everything we've got ain't got much
[1:27:20] to offer a little but I've got a lot I'm
[1:27:22] gonna will I have a heart to serve you

[1:27:47] week and there'll be another week and
[1:27:49] before you know you'll be further away
[1:27:51] from God than you've ever been
[1:27:52] just the time the first got saved right
[1:27:54] before you got saved and you get so
[1:27:56] Batson so : God because you put off
[1:28:00] well lord help us all but the RAM says
[1:28:04] this second coming of the Lord he said
[1:28:05] it was such a great thing to John the
[1:28:07] Revelator on the Isle of Patmos when he
[1:28:09] saw the preview of the coming of the
[1:28:10] Lord when he saw the curses that rested
[1:28:12] upon the unbeliever and the blesses
[1:28:14] blessings that rested upon the believer
[1:28:16] he screamed out even so come Lord Jesus
[1:28:21] it's so thrilled as hard after all he
[1:28:24] had seen the events before his coming he
[1:28:27] screamed
[1:28:28] even so come Lord Jesus and when the
[1:28:31] whole church had just passed and his
[1:28:33] view and he's seen everything a major
[1:28:35] the way it would happen then the scream
[1:28:37] come Lord Jesus
[1:28:40] now listen he saw them in the preview
[1:28:43] but you got a profit tell you about them
[1:28:44] in Heinz life he's told you all about
[1:28:47] the church changes this is when John saw
[1:28:49] he rejoiced when John saw the comer he
[1:28:52] cried out even so come Lord Jesus if he
[1:28:56] did that for a man on X Ahom Patmos what
[1:28:59] on it to do to us this morning he said
[1:29:05] it must be a glorious thing that the
[1:29:08] coming Lord the coming Lord draws in
[1:29:10] their hand my my what does it do to us

[1:29:20] time he's seen a vision of a preview of
[1:29:24] the bride he's seen Church ages
[1:29:26] I believe he's seen Adam and Eve in the
[1:29:28] garden it seen all these things but one
[1:29:30] day he saw a preview of a bride and
[1:29:31] she'd been marching they begin to see
[1:29:34] the last stage he begin to see the
[1:29:35] churches of America naked walking
[1:29:37] through walking through the preview and
[1:29:40] these other churches and at the very end
[1:29:42] when he became to despair listen I
[1:29:47] understand being discouraged by the
[1:29:48] things that happened in the news and the
[1:29:50] things that happen around us it's very
[1:29:51] understandable but he saw something else

[1:30:57] this way what you need is perfect love

[1:31:02] because perfect love's the only thing
[1:31:04] it'll get there that's the only thing
[1:31:06] that is there my life ah that's why I
[1:31:11] want to be here where it's always always

[1:31:20] promise speak to them he asked him he
[1:31:22] said what will I be judged he says yes
[1:31:24] everybody will be judged was Paul judges
[1:31:26] pulse we were judged he said then I'll
[1:31:28] be fine because I preach for Paul preach
[1:31:30] and the people there they declared we're
[1:31:34] resting on that now let me say this to
[1:31:38] you who my face conservation will you be
[1:31:43] brother my faith called the vision when
[1:31:45] those people there spoke I was one of
[1:31:48] them I was with them I don't just see a
[1:31:52] bunch of faces people standing round by
[1:31:53] the brown I see their faces right now
[1:31:55] maybe they look a little older maybe a
[1:31:57] little younger then they'll look over
[1:31:59] there but I'm looking at their faces
[1:32:01] right now we should allow them and we
[1:32:03] declared we believe the Hat we're
[1:32:06] resting on that we can testify the
[1:32:09] county right but that's nothing but the
[1:32:12] truth listen if she can testify that I
[1:32:17] don't believe that was just for her
[1:32:19] I believe this for us today this word
[1:32:22] these sayings they're faithful and
[1:32:25] they're true that's nothing but the
[1:32:27] truth and when you believe that word and
[1:32:30] you confess a lots of power a power
[1:32:34] that's been sealed through churches but
[1:32:36] it's now unleashed upon the people of
[1:32:38] God your faith has to catch the vision

[1:33:21] listen a man can be condemned for his
[1:33:24] imagination your imagination is part of
[1:33:29] experiment that's more powerful than you
[1:33:31] think of the man can be condemned for
[1:33:33] adultery in his imagination Jesus said
[1:33:36] you look at the end of the living world
[1:33:38] their imaginations were continually evil
[1:33:42] and he destroyed a generation part but

[1:34:04] a whole person
[1:34:05] no brother brand me tells the story I
[1:34:06] love the story tells many probably not
[1:34:09] but he was talking about there's a ship
[1:34:10] one time they're on this thing they were
[1:34:12] seeing and there's a bad storm and he
[1:34:14] said the captain's name was John quartz
[1:34:16] he got real sick you know the story he
[1:34:18] got sick one night and he was down below
[1:34:20] and a boy come to visit him the boy was
[1:34:22] a Christian his name was Willie Pruitt
[1:34:23] and he come to visit the captain he said
[1:34:26] I want to read some scripture T and he
[1:34:27] begin to read to the man and he was sick
[1:34:29] and as he's reading to this man he come
[1:34:31] to the plates in Isaiah the 53rd chapter
[1:34:32] where it testifies he was wounded for
[1:34:35] our transgressions he was bruised for
[1:34:37] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[1:34:39] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:34:42] we were healed now listen that captain
[1:34:47] he didn't cause the vision you have you
[1:34:50] ain't caught the vision yeah he said
[1:34:51] well that sounds really good
[1:34:53] and the well it person can I read it to
[1:34:56] you where my momma used to read it to me

[1:35:01] wounded for Willie's transgressions he
[1:35:04] was bruised for Willie's peace the
[1:35:06] chatter that bruised for our iniquities
[1:35:09] and that's harder to do when you're not
[1:35:11] looking at it the testing has Willy's
[1:35:14] pieces upon them and
[1:35:15] well his stripes really is healed now
[1:35:20] some because the stern Captain John
[1:35:22] Court says do you think I could put my
[1:35:24] name in there see it's great when will
[1:35:28] these names in the book it's great when
[1:35:30] somebody else names the book who what

[1:35:38] transgressions he was bruised for John's
[1:35:41] iniquities the chastisement of John's
[1:35:43] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:35:46] John quartz is healed he's happy gonna
[1:35:49] feel some sweet balmy and that captain
[1:35:50] was healed that very hour in that cabin
[1:35:55] brother ray he was wounded for your
[1:35:57] transgressions
[1:35:58] Hamas Nehemiah he was wounded for your
[1:36:02] iniquities how I can say the chasm of my
[1:36:07] peace was upon him with the stripes
[1:36:11] Alexander McGrew this is healed but hey
[1:36:14] when you catch the vision you can put
[1:36:16] your name in there that's why I testify
[1:36:21] by this angel the angel come to let you
[1:36:23] know your names on the box that's how
[1:36:25] you heard from your theophany what is
[1:36:27] the name in the book brother Branham
[1:36:28] said not some not our natural names but
[1:36:31] the mystery of who it is it's the
[1:36:33] revelation of Christ in you so if you're
[1:36:37] part of that mystery your name is in the
[1:36:40] back well let me just put your name
[1:36:43] anywhere come on think about that
[1:36:47] middleman sent when you become a
[1:36:49] Christian and you come to the Falls of
[1:36:50] Christ you get a checkbook and that
[1:36:53] checkbook is signed on the bottom by
[1:36:56] Jesus Christ on every page and all you
[1:36:58] have to do for any redemptive promise
[1:37:00] let's just fill it out house because the
[1:37:02] name is already on the bottom he said
[1:37:04] brother I thought you said to put your
[1:37:05] name I did
[1:37:06] that's what's his name is there cuz his
[1:37:09] name is your name somebody missed that
[1:37:12] one his name is your name your names
[1:37:15] already at the bottom of the church
[1:37:18] and listen if the Prophet said that
[1:37:21] Golub bankrupt heaven to keep his
[1:37:23] promises if he had to everything that
[1:37:25] you have beat up today your name is
[1:37:27] already in the book it's already on the
[1:37:30] checkbook I fasted B was filling out and
[1:37:33] hand it in praise the Lord all right
[1:37:42] quote do you hear this more I'm getting
[1:37:44] ready to wrap up with this I want to
[1:37:45] read this quote where the RAM says this
[1:37:47] and come let us reason together 1955 he
[1:37:50] said there's a man sitting right over
[1:37:51] there from you what's the hardening of
[1:37:52] the arteries he wants to get well - he
[1:37:55] thinks that God would heal them don't
[1:37:57] you sir this might be speaking somebody
[1:37:59] here this morning don't just put on that
[1:38:02] man put your name in there he says he
[1:38:05] thinks that God would heal him don't you
[1:38:07] sir you believe that he did it then I
[1:38:09] want to ask you something just when I
[1:38:11] was talking to this woman
[1:38:12] he says she missed her healing and it
[1:38:15] went over to you just then in Sovereign
[1:38:17] Grace when it went over to you a real
[1:38:19] strange feeling swept over you didn't it
[1:38:22] now think about this so there's a woman
[1:38:24] there and her healing passed right by
[1:38:26] and went to him Shh he said see you
[1:38:31] wondered why that woman didn't raise up
[1:38:33] didn't you know many times we wonder why
[1:38:35] see she missed it because the angel was
[1:38:38] leaving her and going to you isn't that
[1:38:41] right he said if it is wave your hand
[1:38:43] real funny feeling he says that's right
[1:38:45] it ended with you brother your faith got
[1:38:48] the vision you see how do I catch a
[1:38:51] vision well it's not with a butterfly
[1:38:53] net it's not with a bear trap your faith
[1:38:55] has to catch the vision now I want you
[1:39:01] understand right now as I'm getting
[1:39:04] ready to close here right now there's
[1:39:07] radio shows going through this room is
[1:39:10] that right the Rebbe talks about that
[1:39:12] there's another dimension here there's
[1:39:14] television programs going right from
[1:39:15] this room and police reports and calls
[1:39:17] and phone calls and cell phones people
[1:39:19] talking about one another maybe the
[1:39:21] football game or something else it's all
[1:39:23] going through here right now but see you
[1:39:25] can't catch it because you don't have
[1:39:26] the right kind of a receiver for it but
[1:39:29] I want you to understand
[1:39:30] in another dimension above that there's
[1:39:33] a power that is present the king of God
[1:39:35] is here
[1:39:35] the angels of God are going through here
[1:39:37] right now if you need healing your
[1:39:40] healings you want do here right now if
[1:39:42] you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:44] if you need if you need a real baptism
[1:39:45] of the Holy Ghost if you need joy if you
[1:39:49] need peace the Prince of Peace is here
[1:39:50] right now the question is not whether
[1:39:52] he's here the questions can your face
[1:39:54] get the vision I want matter with my
[1:39:57] many people down the street it might be
[1:39:59] going by something in this room right
[1:40:01] now but don't let it go by you your
[1:40:04] faith has a receiver you can get the
[1:40:06] vision
[1:40:07] oh my it amazes me it astounds me how
[1:40:13] many people they'll fight their way
[1:40:15] through the week they'll fight you
[1:40:16] difficulty they'll fight through
[1:40:18] financial trouble they'll fight through
[1:40:20] sickness they'll fight through family
[1:40:22] problems and work and they'll fight
[1:40:24] their way they'll fight through the
[1:40:25] snooze button on Sunday morning to get
[1:40:27] to church they'll fight through every
[1:40:29] obstacle and they'll show up at the
[1:40:31] house of God I think God for that and
[1:40:33] they'll come to the house of God and God
[1:40:35] will begin to move and God began to
[1:40:37] brood over his people and they miss it
[1:40:39] and they go home well that was a good
[1:40:41] service he talked about the power of God
[1:40:43] to heal the power better deliver and
[1:40:45] they walk out with the same burden they
[1:40:47] brought in why they missed what was God
[1:40:50] was doing their faith didn't reach quite
[1:40:52] high enough but I would encourage you
[1:40:54] this one if you're believing people
[1:40:55] you've got the faith listen you've got
[1:40:59] faith you don't even know about
[1:41:01] the questions are you willing to reach
[1:41:02] up and cast the vision I think about the
[1:41:06] woman with the blood issue I preached
[1:41:07] about her years ago brother Ram talks
[1:41:08] about her as well and the different lace
[1:41:10] in the Bible then where the blood is she
[1:41:12] she had a punishing for 12 years the
[1:41:14] Bible tells us she's been to doctors and
[1:41:16] she spent every dime she had there
[1:41:18] Oliver substance now I want you to think
[1:41:20] about this woman for a second consider
[1:41:23] what this woman was going through
[1:41:24] because we we read that 12 years like a
[1:41:26] footnote in the book and we go right on
[1:41:28] but what you think about a woman that
[1:41:30] unclean for twelve years if she had
[1:41:31] family if she had loved ones for 12
[1:41:34] years she had to live away from them
[1:41:36] being unclean she wasn't even supposed
[1:41:37] to be in the crowd of people I don't
[1:41:41] know maybe she'd been a mother maybe she
[1:41:43] had children before the
[1:41:44] Shanta issue and think about not being
[1:41:45] able to hold your child for 12 years not
[1:41:47] being able to cook supper for your
[1:41:48] husband for 12 years not being able to
[1:41:50] be a part of your family for 12 years
[1:41:52] because of an uncleanness in your life
[1:41:54] and suffering year after year after year
[1:41:56] maybe selling everything you had just to
[1:41:59] get some help from a doctor and doctors
[1:42:01] in there like a lot of doctors today
[1:42:02] that take you for every dime whether you
[1:42:04] get better in a hot here she suffered
[1:42:09] and gone through things and she sees
[1:42:11] Jesus and Jesus passing by and she gets
[1:42:14] down on her knees and she begins to
[1:42:16] crawl through mothers and much admire
[1:42:19] and through the feet the feet of
[1:42:21] different people just to get to Jesus
[1:42:24] and what a shame if she'd got all the
[1:42:26] way Jesus said well I got to see him
[1:42:27] today I guess I'll go home you're this
[1:42:30] close now's the time to grab you can
[1:42:33] just grab the hem of his garment you say
[1:42:34] well I wish the Prophet were here while
[1:42:36] we're sewing so we're here all you've
[1:42:38] got to do is grab the hem of his garment
[1:42:40] and you can be main hall don't let them
[1:42:44] pass you by if you've got to crawl if
[1:42:46] you've got to find you did to Jesus he's
[1:42:50] here enough you can catch the vision
[1:42:53] let's stand to our feet hold don't let
[1:42:57] him pass you by now
[1:42:59] I believe he's still the same I know
[1:43:03] he's still the same I've seen him do the
[1:43:05] same things he's always done we have a
[1:43:08] witness of the resurrection
