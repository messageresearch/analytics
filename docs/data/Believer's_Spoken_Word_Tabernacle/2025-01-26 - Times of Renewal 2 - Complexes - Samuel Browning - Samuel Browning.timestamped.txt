[48:01] Lord as you know I've asked continuously

[48:07] microphone Lord I I'd be just honored
[48:10] Lord I want you to be the preacher I
[48:11] want you to be the speaker this morning
[48:14] because we all have needs Lord and
[48:17] father we ask that you would just sweep
[48:20] among this congregation through every
[48:21] part of this building Lord from the
[48:24] conference room through the nursery
[48:26] through the forer through this assembly
[48:28] God May the presence of God just move
[48:31] Among Us in a special way this morning
[48:34] we just commit Lord every need and every
[48:36] situation into your hands in the
[48:39] precious name of Jesus Christ
[48:42] amen amen God bless you this morning if
[48:45] you will turn with me
[48:49] to I'd like to turn our Bibles here
[48:54] to ro Romans chapter
[48:58] 12 and
[49:01] um I want to just read a couple
[49:04] scriptures from here and just ask the
[49:08] Lord's blessing and guidance here Upon
[49:10] Our Lives I also wanted to mention out
[49:13] there on the table where the prayer
[49:15] requests are at I know many of you have
[49:17] already uh visited there to check the
[49:21] address make sure everything is up to
[49:23] date on that for us as well as birthdays
[49:25] and anniversary iies and um so we just
[49:28] want to do that as well and I they
[49:31] mentioned uh regarding my mother-in-law
[49:33] and uh I see brother brother Brian
[49:36] they're not here this morning but
[49:37] brother Brian had a birthday as well and
[49:40] I was going to tease him a little bit
[49:41] and say I thought of a scripture at
[49:43] least the first part I have been young
[49:46] but now I am old and I was
[49:49] just course everybody knows me a little
[49:51] bit but but I'm glad that scripture is
[49:53] true even in the last part I've got a
[49:55] testimony I've never seen the righteous
[49:58] forsaken aren't you glad yes sir amen so
[50:02] forgive me for that
[50:04] but brother Brian was here he'd probably
[50:06] say I was expecting
[50:08] it so we just want to just look to the
[50:11] Lord here this morning in Romans chapter
[50:13] 12 and uh verse
[50:16] one Paul writes I beseech you therefore
[50:20] Brethren by the mercies of God now
[50:22] notice by the mercies of God that ye
[50:27] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[50:32] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[50:36] reasonable service now Paul's speaking
[50:39] very deeply to the Inner Man The
[50:42] Authority that's given to us because the
[50:44] nature that we were under when the New
[50:47] Birth has come that that nature that old
[50:50] man has died and there's a new man
[50:53] there's a new creation on the inside and
[50:56] then through the authority of that new
[50:58] creation that new Administration on the
[51:00] inside well our desires have changed our
[51:04] life has changed because of him and so
[51:08] then because of that we have an
[51:10] authority as Paul said by the mercies of
[51:14] God not by a mandate or a dictate but by
[51:17] the mercies of God that we would present
[51:21] our bodies a Living Sacrifice now I'll
[51:25] just be honest with you there's
[51:26] sometimes it's easy to be a sacrifice
[51:28] with some things than it is to be others
[51:32] but you know what through it all
[51:34] everything I want you to think about it
[51:36] if there had not been a sacrifice made
[51:39] for you and I that's right we would not
[51:42] be able to enjoy the life that we now
[51:45] have that's right yes sir because it's
[51:47] the character of that life that has come
[51:50] inside of us that is molding us shaping
[51:53] us and it comes to that display of the
[51:56] greater is he that's in us than he
[51:57] that's in the world now look at verse
[51:59] two and be not conformed to this world
[52:05] but be you
[52:06] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[52:10] that ye might prove what is that good
[52:14] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[52:19] hallelujah don't you love the Lord amen
[52:21] amen God bless you as you're being
[52:22] seated this
[52:24] morning I'd like to just pick up on this
[52:27] thought where we were at the last time
[52:30] we were together out of Joshua 8 but I
[52:32] want to just Dive Right into this on on
[52:35] the times of renewal and I want to just
[52:37] hone in on this thought of of
[52:40] complexes and I want you to um
[52:45] understand I would say in this regards I
[52:48] want to just kind of put a little bit of
[52:49] a precursor here uh because the prophet
[52:52] was so apt to do that that when the Holy
[52:56] Ghost has come by way of the new birth
[52:59] brother Bram told us very clearly he
[53:00] said don't ever get in your mind that
[53:03] you're not going to make
[53:04] mistakes you will he said but if you'll
[53:08] and he refers us to those little
[53:11] figurine of three little monkey sitting
[53:13] on a desk and want got its eyes covered
[53:15] and ears covered and mouth covered and
[53:18] he said he said you know don't you know
[53:20] just turning away from that don't speak
[53:22] no evil hearing no evil just you know
[53:24] turning away from it don't doing any
[53:26] evil and um then he goes in just talking
[53:29] to us about just keeping our mind on
[53:32] Christ and and that's not that's not
[53:35] something that is altogether easy if if
[53:38] it was something that was just automatic
[53:40] then God would never have had to
[53:42] admonish us through the writings of the
[53:45] word as he did with Paul as well as
[53:48] where we stand with Joshua when God
[53:50] would remind Joshua that the greatness
[53:53] of the victories that you will have the
[53:55] success will be actually not so much
[53:59] when you're walking around the walls of
[54:01] Jericho but what you're entertaining in
[54:04] your mind and he would say meditate on
[54:08] the word of God and so we know that the
[54:10] word has life within it you know it's
[54:12] it's incredible sometimes there's words
[54:15] there's things there's images and a lot
[54:17] of things that we as we go through life
[54:19] and sometimes there's things that you
[54:21] can hear when you're at school you're at
[54:23] work or things you see and you just say
[54:24] Lord just just let that pass pass right
[54:26] on through my mind and yet it seems to
[54:28] be that where the enemy wants to
[54:31] continually try to flood us with things
[54:34] to where what God is wanting to instill
[54:37] in our hearts by his word that he wants
[54:40] to try to flood that out and get our
[54:42] attention in many ways and truly life
[54:44] itself is filled uh it it there there's
[54:47] a busyness there's all kinds of
[54:49] responsibilities it's almost like
[54:51] incredible of how to keep up with all
[54:53] the different tasks of life and we've
[54:55] got reminders for reminders and we've
[54:58] got reminders for those reminders and
[55:00] you know and so it just we understand
[55:02] how it goes it's we're living in a very
[55:04] complex time and an age and pressures
[55:06] and and all those other things but I
[55:09] want to just say it in this way that you
[55:11] know there's an element of it that what
[55:13] we have to understand more and more even
[55:15] though the mind is that of the No Man's
[55:17] Land it's attached there to that human
[55:19] Spirit but it's a place that we've got a
[55:22] choice to where that we can flood it
[55:24] with the things of God and that's a
[55:27] thing that when we look at I say God let
[55:29] I want to I want to F my mind I you know
[55:31] and this is where it comes to where when
[55:32] you're daily in your walk with God daily
[55:35] reading the word of God it's things that
[55:38] we're in listening to the message of the
[55:40] hour I I tell you friends even at times
[55:42] when you're going down the roadway and
[55:44] you just you may say well I only have 15
[55:46] minutes let me tell you something God
[55:48] can do more for you out of things that
[55:50] he'll say in 5 minutes than what what we
[55:53] could do within a day's time and and who
[55:55] knows that I tell you this when I say
[55:56] who knows I have found it to be this way
[55:59] that there are times that here it is
[56:01] that maybe I've been listening to a
[56:03] message and I want to go back to a place
[56:05] that I've hearing this and I I do this
[56:07] all the time when I'm coming back and
[56:08] forth and I come into a place and it's
[56:10] just like as though right then and there
[56:13] it's speaking to the very particular
[56:15] need and things that are present and
[56:18] it's just an answer that comes from the
[56:19] Throne of God and I just say thank you
[56:21] Lord you know what it is it's the desire
[56:24] in our life as a Believer is I want my
[56:26] life to be under his influence amen I've
[56:29] got decisions I've got things that are
[56:30] going to lay ahead of me and I'm not
[56:32] naive to think that every decision I'm
[56:34] going to make is always going to be thus
[56:37] sayith the Lord decision I want to be
[56:39] purposeful and intentional under the
[56:41] leadership of the Holy Spirit I want to
[56:44] flood my life and see it's kind of like
[56:46] this if you you chop wood and you we
[56:48] have times when we have fire out here
[56:50] you don't you know um like a like a a
[56:53] fire pit we we will gather Woods a lot
[56:55] of times we'll purchase wood and then
[56:57] get it hot enough and we'll burn uh this
[56:59] stuff around here that really don't burn
[57:00] too good and you know we don't burn at
[57:03] all but sometimes it just depends I mean
[57:06] how long we go out there with the fire
[57:07] pit right depends on how many hot dogs
[57:09] that somebody eats or or you know
[57:11] marshmallows are roasted or or whatever
[57:13] more we may not burn it all and that's
[57:15] the same thing that when our lives are
[57:17] being filled with the good things of the
[57:20] Lord I I tell you if if we've got popups
[57:23] on our phone notifications on our phone
[57:26] then then I tell you we've got to be
[57:28] intention intentional in this hour in
[57:30] this time God knew we would be here in
[57:32] this time and you let me just tell you
[57:35] the word of God is just as effective
[57:38] it's just as inspired and it's more than
[57:41] enough to take care of every
[57:46] situation it really comes down to in our
[57:49] lives and us just really putting forth
[57:52] that effort I say God help us you know
[57:54] brother Brandon would take many times in
[57:56] the turn of the new year and he would
[57:59] Express like he did in the Revelation
[58:01] series there in 1960 and he would talk
[58:04] about how that he said let it become a
[58:07] habit in your life where you sit down
[58:10] and you read the word of God now I know
[58:12] sometimes when we think about that we
[58:13] think well that that that doesn't seem
[58:15] very spiritual but you got to remember
[58:17] here we are also it's on the inside it's
[58:21] taking control of all these other Realms
[58:24] because there's going to be times where
[58:26] we don't feel like reading or feel like
[58:28] praying yet there's a desire within us
[58:30] we we love the Lord but sometimes it's
[58:32] it's pressing Beyond I mean there's a
[58:35] lot of things sometimes we have to press
[58:36] Beyond right sometimes you have to press
[58:38] Beyond to say go out of our way to say a
[58:41] kind
[58:42] word right sometimes we have to kind of
[58:45] go beyond our way instead of just you
[58:46] know uh thanking the lord for dinner and
[58:48] you know going ahead and slurping it
[58:50] down we sometimes it's just enough to
[58:52] say honey I appreciate you putting all
[58:53] this together thank you for you know for
[58:56] for doing all this oh boy I hope we
[58:58] don't get off on the wrong foot right
[58:59] now you know but sometimes it it's those
[59:02] things that just moves within us in
[59:03] those times and and um you know we could
[59:06] spend a lot of time within that but I
[59:08] want to just say it in this way it it's
[59:10] times that where we're looking at in our
[59:12] life that don't don't let the enemy
[59:14] minimize that when brother B talks about
[59:16] that of habits it's time when we look at
[59:18] it start a good habit in your life start
[59:21] things in your life you know listening
[59:24] getting in you know and don't try to
[59:25] over over whelm yourself don't try to be
[59:27] you know a a superstar listen just
[59:29] little by little as a matter of fact as
[59:31] you start going even little by little
[59:34] look you'll find your life beginning to
[59:36] benefit Blossom it's strength coming in
[59:39] your life because of the word of God
[59:42] that's so good is that right yes now
[59:46] watch how brother B will take this from
[59:48] when we look back in our text on this
[59:51] EMP power transformation and I want you
[59:54] to think about where we're where we're
[59:55] standing
[59:56] here in this hour brother BR says now
[59:59] referring to that text that's what we
[1:00:01] all want to do is be not conformed to
[1:00:03] this world but be transformed by the
[1:00:06] renewing of our mind to do the perfect
[1:00:09] and acceptable will of God now that we
[1:00:12] have been saved as we are and that we
[1:00:15] have been filled with the Holy Spirit as
[1:00:18] we have now we want the mind that was in
[1:00:23] Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:00:26] transformed from the Natural Things of
[1:00:29] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:00:33] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:00:36] spirit by his
[1:00:38] word so God works on us the same God who
[1:00:43] draws us to himself the same God who
[1:00:47] moves down and and leads us to a place
[1:00:50] of full surrender and comes and changes
[1:00:53] our life completely fills us with his
[1:00:56] spirit that same God moves down within
[1:01:00] our life as we will continue to give
[1:01:03] ourselves to him it's the mind of Christ
[1:01:06] that begins to move down in our life and
[1:01:10] that's what we want to have operated in
[1:01:13] our life you see this is why when you
[1:01:15] look at the message of the hour we're
[1:01:18] living in the time for promises to be
[1:01:22] fulfilled we're living in the time as
[1:01:25] Romans 8 said that the whole earth is
[1:01:27] groaning and travailing it's longing for
[1:01:30] the manifestation of the sons of God we
[1:01:33] are living in the season of the adoption
[1:01:37] of Sons and Daughters of God and this is
[1:01:40] why the prophet of God as we've been
[1:01:41] laying it over and over he distinctly
[1:01:44] separates and says your adoption is not
[1:01:47] your birth it's the new birth then the
[1:01:50] same spirit of God that brought that
[1:01:53] brought about that transformation in
[1:01:55] your life the desires it's leading you
[1:01:58] to a full
[1:02:01] adoption this is why you refer to the
[1:02:03] quot the quote that you've heard me
[1:02:05] refer to out of you must be born again
[1:02:07] and brother BR says I hear some are
[1:02:09] teaching that oh he says here you are
[1:02:11] you're you're born again today and and
[1:02:13] tomorrow you're a fully matured Son of
[1:02:15] God and the prophet's words are that's
[1:02:17] nonsense right because even in our own
[1:02:20] natural life now look look friends I'm
[1:02:23] not here to try to figure it all out I
[1:02:25] don't even know how everything coming to
[1:02:27] PL coming to pass when I think about
[1:02:30] we're waiting on that last one to come
[1:02:31] in I I'm just going to say it to you
[1:02:33] like this the last one coming in may not
[1:02:36] even be outside of these
[1:02:37] walls cuz remember it's not about coming
[1:02:40] the last one coming in isn't about that
[1:02:43] just coming into salvation it's where
[1:02:45] that name becomes splashed beneath the
[1:02:48] bleach of the blood and it's filled with
[1:02:51] the spirit of God so it may not even be
[1:02:53] out there but in the meantime while I'm
[1:02:55] still here it might be and and I want to
[1:02:57] try to witness and encourage everybody
[1:03:00] else I want to try to witness and
[1:03:01] encourage others even if they are not
[1:03:03] ordained to see this light but I want to
[1:03:06] see him at the end
[1:03:09] saved just my desire to see him saved I
[1:03:12] mean you call me strange but you know
[1:03:14] all the way through my years anytime I'd
[1:03:16] listen to off a Moody Bible and hear
[1:03:19] that of Unshackled and and hear those
[1:03:21] testimonies and stories there was never
[1:03:23] a time that it didn't touch me when it
[1:03:25] was hit me in my eyes I would just begin
[1:03:27] to cry and thank God you say well
[1:03:29] there's there's a deeper walk yes but
[1:03:31] they might not be ordained to it but to
[1:03:33] see that they have experienced the
[1:03:36] Saving Grace of almighty God I tell you
[1:03:39] that makes me
[1:03:42] Rejoice because why I can I can
[1:03:44] Fellowship around
[1:03:46] that but we're called there's something
[1:03:49] in us that we didn't put in our lives
[1:03:52] it's a longing to be United with God
[1:03:55] that we did not even understand what was
[1:03:58] taking
[1:04:00] place some of the times we were happy
[1:04:03] where we were at but there was a longing
[1:04:05] in our hearts to move closer to move
[1:04:08] deeper even some of us some of you I
[1:04:10] think about brother Josh way as I'm
[1:04:12] looking at him now gave his testimony
[1:04:14] last February where he suffered there in
[1:04:16] those boarding schools where he
[1:04:18] renounced the Trinity and there they
[1:04:21] would you know lashes on him and
[1:04:22] everything else he stood a reproach for
[1:04:25] this word and to think some of us have
[1:04:27] not even been to that place physically
[1:04:29] but I want you to understand to think of
[1:04:32] how that there were things no doubt the
[1:04:34] flesh would want to go the easy route
[1:04:36] not take the lashes not Stand Out There
[1:04:39] Our flesh would want to go the easy way
[1:04:41] but let me tell you something it's worth
[1:04:43] it all when you can make a stand for
[1:04:46] almighty God he'll make us stand for
[1:04:49] you well brother Samuel my friends may
[1:04:52] leave me but he said if you'll forsake
[1:04:56] I'll give you friends I'll give you
[1:04:58] fathers I'll give you mothers I'll give
[1:05:00] you're not Jesus like the prophet said
[1:05:03] Jesus will never be
[1:05:06] outdone never be outdone
[1:05:10] hallu Hallelujah that's so oh thank you
[1:05:14] Lord so
[1:05:16] renewing and this time of renewal and I
[1:05:19] want to read a few scriptures here of
[1:05:21] where that God brings us to in Ephesians
[1:05:24] 4:22 do Paul would write and admonish us
[1:05:28] that you put off concerning the former
[1:05:31] conversation that's the character the
[1:05:33] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:05:36] to the deceitful lust and be renewed in
[1:05:40] the spirit of your mind that ye may put
[1:05:44] on the new man which after God is
[1:05:48] created in righteousness and true
[1:05:52] Holiness that whole phrase of put on it
[1:05:55] means to sink like you did into your
[1:05:57] shirt or I did into my coat that's
[1:06:00] that's what it means and and and I just
[1:06:01] say it like this that wherever you're at
[1:06:04] in your life we all can go deeper sure
[1:06:07] amen and let me just say it like this
[1:06:09] that no matter what it is that you would
[1:06:12] be facing look in your life and say Lord
[1:06:15] take me deeper amen I I want to go
[1:06:18] deeper you know you say how deep you
[1:06:20] want to go I I want to go deeper so
[1:06:22] where that it's more of him on display
[1:06:26] and and more of a preeminence in my life
[1:06:29] to where you say how do I even know the
[1:06:31] word is being preeminent in my life look
[1:06:33] at your thoughts look at your life look
[1:06:35] at your actions look at how things that
[1:06:38] maybe before you would go and and kind
[1:06:40] of uncheck it and and reason it out but
[1:06:42] now there's things where God moving in
[1:06:44] your life and there's a molding there's
[1:06:46] a shaping there's a maturing that's
[1:06:47] going on and you don't become loose it
[1:06:50] becomes tighter yeah that's so true see
[1:06:52] the pyramid did not it does not start on
[1:06:55] the bottom like this and become
[1:06:57] wider that's the way Christianity is out
[1:07:00] there that's not the bride building the
[1:07:02] bride building is it starts out wide and
[1:07:04] it Narrows amen that's the same way in
[1:07:07] our life not only has God been doing
[1:07:09] that for the bride body down Through the
[1:07:12] Ages he does it with the church he does
[1:07:15] it with you and I as an individual and
[1:07:17] that growing narrow that narrowing down
[1:07:20] is a less of self and more of him
[1:07:26] doesn't mean that we're going to be able
[1:07:27] to just take self hang self up oh these
[1:07:30] certain things don't never bother me
[1:07:31] it's when you recognize I recognize as a
[1:07:34] son and daughter of God there's an
[1:07:35] authority that's given in us that is
[1:07:38] greater than heavens and earth and
[1:07:41] cannot pass away there is an authority
[1:07:44] inside of you there is a power that you
[1:07:47] can tap into that is
[1:07:50] greater
[1:07:53] greater now watch this in Titus Chapter
[1:07:56] 3: 5 not by works of righteousness which
[1:07:59] we have done but according to his
[1:08:02] Mercy he saved us by the washing of
[1:08:07] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost now that that regeneration this is
[1:08:14] God dealing with that old nature and
[1:08:16] it's it's the holy spirit it's the word
[1:08:18] of God it's that washing of regeneration
[1:08:21] where it brings an absolute change on
[1:08:25] the side of our life remember he starts
[1:08:28] out with that and we begin to grow in
[1:08:30] our life it comes by the holy spirit
[1:08:33] this whole word of renewing it means to
[1:08:36] make new to
[1:08:39] repair and and and God comes by his
[1:08:42] Spirit he's the one that makes a new
[1:08:45] creation it it is God coming to ignite
[1:08:49] what he has placed on the inside that's
[1:08:51] what he's drawing upon the whole time
[1:08:54] that he's wanting us to come to a place
[1:08:56] of yielding and surrender but notice
[1:08:59] this renewing of the Holy Spirit it does
[1:09:01] not stop with that of the new birth it
[1:09:04] continues to go on and on you say how
[1:09:08] far will this renewing go on until the
[1:09:11] very atoms of our bodies have been
[1:09:15] renewed prise the
[1:09:17] Lord amen the quickening doesn't stop
[1:09:21] now let me just say this God's objective
[1:09:24] is not to make perfect people with
[1:09:28] perfect actions he's interested he knows
[1:09:31] the sufficiency of his word his word is
[1:09:35] perfect his blood is perfect his blood
[1:09:38] has brought a perfect loosening to where
[1:09:40] we're no longer yolked and held to that
[1:09:44] bondage of sin so it is the Perfection
[1:09:47] of our sacrifice if there's any glorying
[1:09:50] any boasting it's in the Perfection of
[1:09:52] our sacrifice and how we know he has
[1:09:55] moved in our
[1:09:57] life that's the real
[1:10:00] Perfection and through the strength of
[1:10:03] that Perfection is what moves and
[1:10:05] orchestrates and operates in our life to
[1:10:08] bring forth what God has intended to be
[1:10:11] brought forth how many believe that
[1:10:13] God's desire is to operate through your
[1:10:15] life amen amen that's what God wants to
[1:10:17] do listen the very first thing when God
[1:10:19] God spoke to Paul remember Paul was
[1:10:21] doing a lot of things but when he met
[1:10:23] Paul on the road to D ask because the
[1:10:25] very first thing when God revealed his
[1:10:28] name who when Paul asked who are you
[1:10:30] then remember what Paul's response was
[1:10:32] what would you have me do see because
[1:10:35] every time God reveals the
[1:10:37] Revelation it comes in a manner to put
[1:10:41] his subjects into action that's so good
[1:10:44] so whatever way that God chooses to use
[1:10:47] you or use me we don't have God don't
[1:10:49] want us to be
[1:10:50] alike he's not interested in that God if
[1:10:53] he wanted to do that he would have
[1:10:54] carbon copied every one of us we'd all
[1:10:56] look alikee everybody act alike
[1:10:58] everybody preach alike every every
[1:10:59] Church would be just exactly alike 10
[1:11:01] pews here an organ God doesn't want
[1:11:05] that anybody can do that man can do that
[1:11:11] but God is the one who comes to lead his
[1:11:14] church and think about the great
[1:11:16] sovereignty sovereignty let me just say
[1:11:18] it while I'm on it sovereignty is not an
[1:11:21] exemption from Doctrine that's so true
[1:11:24] are you hearing
[1:11:26] I'm I'm a message church but you know
[1:11:28] we're Sovereign we don't have to go
[1:11:30] along with this if if you're a message
[1:11:32] Church sovereignty is not an exemption
[1:11:35] to say we'll follow this we won't follow
[1:11:37] that that's not
[1:11:39] sovereignty that's called
[1:11:41] Rebellion but sovereignty sovereignty is
[1:11:45] where there are things that might be
[1:11:46] done a little different we our music
[1:11:49] might be a little different when we take
[1:11:50] up offering might be a little different
[1:11:52] the way we do things might be a little
[1:11:54] different but always holding the
[1:11:56] standard and the doctrine of the word of
[1:11:59] that of the Apostles and the prophets
[1:12:01] and the foundation stone of the Lord
[1:12:04] Jesus
[1:12:05] Christen oh my prise God
[1:12:09] now I want you to listen this thought as
[1:12:11] we agreed with that God has put us to be
[1:12:15] uh channels brother Bram would say this
[1:12:17] in images of Christ I want you just to
[1:12:18] listen to this he says could we humble
[1:12:21] ourselves tonight and become transformed
[1:12:24] by renewing
[1:12:25] of our spirit by the holy spirit that we
[1:12:28] could yield our lips our eyes and your
[1:12:33] faith and my faith that he would come
[1:12:36] out in the audience and move in you and
[1:12:40] move in me to fulfill his word that he's
[1:12:42] a high priest of our
[1:12:44] confession you know I could probably
[1:12:46] preach a month on that right there now
[1:12:49] cuz sometimes when we think about the
[1:12:50] yielding of the sacrifice
[1:12:52] listen we Face the condition
[1:12:55] of this age and we cannot be ignorant or
[1:12:59] naive and think well you know those
[1:13:01] things are not going to bother me I want
[1:13:02] more if we're not careful this age is
[1:13:06] Anointed with a spirit of lovers of
[1:13:09] self where every decision is made on
[1:13:13] what's the best for me that's so yes sir
[1:13:17] that's the anointing that's upon this
[1:13:19] age and let me just tell you that's what
[1:13:21] happened because of the fall right
[1:13:25] and this is and so when we look at that
[1:13:28] sometimes coming to the house of God and
[1:13:29] being here is not about you getting
[1:13:32] needs met it's about your faith being
[1:13:35] lended and another part of Faith being
[1:13:37] lended and here we are standing as a
[1:13:40] body today may not be my day to come to
[1:13:43] that certain spot but I have have come
[1:13:45] been brought here by God that my faith
[1:13:47] can be y yielded and say Lord speak this
[1:13:51] morning you know the needs that are here
[1:13:53] in this building
[1:13:57] God showed that cooperation when they
[1:13:58] went in the land right you didn't just
[1:14:00] have to say well this is my mountain and
[1:14:02] I'm just I'm just going to go take this
[1:14:03] mountain that's true you have to have
[1:14:05] that resolve and that resolution but God
[1:14:07] also told those who chose even not to go
[1:14:10] over into the land he said you're going
[1:14:13] to come and help fight fight battles
[1:14:15] with your brethren after they're settled
[1:14:17] then you can go on back across that's
[1:14:19] good that's what we're here for it's
[1:14:22] like when we have things like this when
[1:14:24] sister Anna are ones it's a time to
[1:14:26] fight
[1:14:27] battles it's a time to pray it's a time
[1:14:30] to press it's a time to stand there
[1:14:33] because we have promises that are given
[1:14:35] to us how long do I pray pray till we're
[1:14:38] standing on the mountain pray till we
[1:14:41] see our sister sitting right here and
[1:14:44] God restoring her
[1:14:46] sight
[1:14:48] hallelujah we're fighting for every inch
[1:14:50] of ground this is not a picnic it's a
[1:14:53] battle
[1:14:57] and really really really we have a
[1:14:59] battle against the enemy but one of the
[1:15:02] greatest enemies we've got and it's the
[1:15:04] biggest one greatest one just the words
[1:15:07] of the Prophet it's our own
[1:15:10] self that's what it
[1:15:14] is go brother Ram goes on here and he
[1:15:16] says I'm going to want you to listen to
[1:15:18] this I read this one he said God help us
[1:15:20] to lay aside this morning is that a
[1:15:22] deceived Church by the world every toil
[1:15:24] of the day every care of this life you
[1:15:27] know I think that'd be good we come into
[1:15:29] the house of God you might say brother
[1:15:31] Samy that don't seem that deep but you
[1:15:32] know sometimes I we we Overlook the
[1:15:34] little
[1:15:36] things sometimes it be it would behoove
[1:15:38] us to just try
[1:15:40] it don't just try it what have you got
[1:15:42] to lose just try it come in here and sit
[1:15:44] down a little bit before service and say
[1:15:46] Lord help me to lay aside the cares of
[1:15:48] this life cuz I can't do nothing about
[1:15:51] him while I'm sitting here anyhow help
[1:15:53] me to lay aside the toils of this life
[1:15:55] help me just to put it in your hands let
[1:15:57] me tell you the Bible says if you seek
[1:15:59] Him First he'll add all these other
[1:16:02] things God can give you an answer and
[1:16:04] God can take care of a situation while
[1:16:06] you're right here in church trust
[1:16:08] him say Lord I put you first
[1:16:13] Hallelujah he said all the way from the
[1:16:15] janitor to the pastor that there would
[1:16:17] be nothing in our minds now but would be
[1:16:20] waiting listening reverently for the
[1:16:22] Holy Spirit to speak to us what we might
[1:16:25] accomplish something good to know more
[1:16:28] of thee by our gathering together for
[1:16:30] Lord truly that's what we come on this
[1:16:33] hot day it ain't a hot day but speak to
[1:16:36] us through thy Living Word and let the
[1:16:38] Living Word dwell in us and abide in us
[1:16:42] that we might be shaped and formed not
[1:16:46] to the world but be transformed by the
[1:16:49] renewing of our spirit into the form of
[1:16:52] the Son of God so right here taking that
[1:16:55] word into our life because it's not
[1:16:57] positive thinking it's the word that has
[1:17:00] life in it
[1:17:02] right the word has life in it now I want
[1:17:06] you to think about when God as we said a
[1:17:09] couple Sundays ago when God calls for a
[1:17:11] time of
[1:17:13] renewal Israel was already in Joshua 8
[1:17:18] they had already returned to God there
[1:17:20] had been a full repentance aen that
[1:17:23] whole thing was moved out of the camp
[1:17:25] there had been repentance God had come
[1:17:28] down and through repentance then they go
[1:17:30] forth in obedience and then there comes
[1:17:32] Victory and then God would have them
[1:17:35] come to a place of a renewal where
[1:17:38] Joshua would would once
[1:17:40] again he would write on a stone all the
[1:17:45] Commandments
[1:17:48] again I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:17:50] your hands because probably some of us
[1:17:52] been there where you were in school and
[1:17:54] you had to write one sentence I will not
[1:17:57] interrupt the teacher while they are
[1:17:59] talking and they said now you have to
[1:18:02] raise your hand now you have to write
[1:18:05] that 50 times you oh dear lord I mean at
[1:18:07] least I ain't getting a SWAT this time
[1:18:09] but you know
[1:18:12] you now that right there there's a
[1:18:15] reason they want want to do that I'm not
[1:18:17] here for that but I want to just bring
[1:18:18] it to this point when God told him to go
[1:18:20] to mount eel and mount gam and he told
[1:18:23] him cop
[1:18:25] a new p a new writing of the law not
[1:18:28] change it but rewrite it not rewrite it
[1:18:32] but write it
[1:18:33] again you see this is why there's things
[1:18:35] that God will bring us Peter said while
[1:18:39] I am with you I'm going to stir up your
[1:18:43] pure Mind by remembrance putting you in
[1:18:47] remembrance of these things and if you
[1:18:50] look at those virtues within there I I
[1:18:53] tell you for past months just that
[1:18:55] message of stature of perfect man just
[1:18:56] been pouring through that message when
[1:18:58] you look through there it might seem
[1:19:00] like man those things aren't real deep
[1:19:02] but I really wonder I really wonder
[1:19:04] within all of this of sometimes the
[1:19:06] emphasis of what's placed on the bride's
[1:19:08] Revival is not the bride's Revival there
[1:19:11] you go there you go when we can't have
[1:19:14] love and patience and tolerance for one
[1:19:17] another I I I that that's that that's
[1:19:20] not that's not an
[1:19:23] achievement so when I'm looking at you
[1:19:25] look at those virtues that are listed
[1:19:27] there there's there's a place within our
[1:19:29] life we want those things to continue to
[1:19:31] grow and to continue to Lord I I I need
[1:19:35] more patience in my
[1:19:37] life I need more of that in my life
[1:19:41] because let me tell you something the
[1:19:43] more that God as we will yield the more
[1:19:46] he adds to our life that let me tell you
[1:19:48] is just as Supernatural as somebody
[1:19:51] getting off a cot or walking out of a
[1:19:53] wheelchair we need those times and God
[1:19:55] knows sovereignly when we need them we
[1:19:58] don't need them worked up we don't need
[1:20:00] them planned out we just need to let God
[1:20:03] be
[1:20:04] God but that let me tell you somebody
[1:20:06] can get out of off a stretcher or out of
[1:20:08] a wheelchair and eventually if they live
[1:20:10] long enough they'll die or they'll get
[1:20:13] sick again but anything that God has
[1:20:16] added to your life by way of your
[1:20:18] character
[1:20:19] amen nothing can reverse that
[1:20:23] Hallelujah after all he's coming to
[1:20:25] Rapture
[1:20:28] character that's good so this is where
[1:20:31] what's really important within it all
[1:20:33] when God calls that time of renewal
[1:20:34] there's times of revisiting and I don't
[1:20:37] want to say we go away but sometimes God
[1:20:39] brings us back into the Simplicity of
[1:20:42] certain things because God is interested
[1:20:45] in his word being fulfilled in our lives
[1:20:48] and these are times that you know we can
[1:20:50] go look we got a choice we can go in our
[1:20:53] lives and look at it and say well you
[1:20:55] know I you know I I I I you know I I
[1:20:58] failed here and you know I repented and
[1:20:59] I thank God for his grace and and I I
[1:21:02] believe that I don't want to I probably
[1:21:03] sound nonchalantly on that but I'm not
[1:21:05] saying that you're nonchalant but
[1:21:07] sometimes it's got to come to a place
[1:21:09] and it takes God to call us to a place
[1:21:11] to say yes Fellowship is restored but we
[1:21:15] need to deal with the cause of it oh
[1:21:17] that's if not it's going to become a
[1:21:19] mountain that you continue to circle
[1:21:22] around so good now I'm not saying that
[1:21:25] it ain't going to be Temptation come and
[1:21:27] you won't be tempted in the same way but
[1:21:29] it's got to recognize that there is a
[1:21:32] Grace and a growth by the spirit of God
[1:21:35] that will help us to recognize the devil
[1:21:39] and every one of his
[1:21:41] tricks and to recognize that God in us
[1:21:44] has already overcome it that's two parts
[1:21:48] to overcoming
[1:21:50] right hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:21:53] pretty powerful isn't it because we
[1:21:55] would think one thing and and sometimes
[1:21:56] in our mind our overcoming is well it
[1:21:58] don't bother me anymore no overcoming
[1:22:00] remember brother randam emphasized that
[1:22:02] it's to recognize the devil in every one
[1:22:04] of his
[1:22:05] tricks that's a first step and then
[1:22:08] recognize that God in you has already
[1:22:09] overcome it there's times where you have
[1:22:12] to be able to you stand right there and
[1:22:13] you're able to discern and recognize who
[1:22:15] it is and say I'm not going that
[1:22:21] way oh my now I want you to to think of
[1:22:24] this this are three things it requires
[1:22:27] discernment and boy we need the
[1:22:29] discernment of the Lord I I I I need I
[1:22:31] need his help and looking at things I
[1:22:33] need it because I I I'll tell you right
[1:22:35] now I won't see it in my life the way he
[1:22:37] sees it I guarantee you I mean to me my
[1:22:41] time might look straightening but
[1:22:43] somebody else said no it's crooked see
[1:22:45] with God there's things where you and I
[1:22:47] can look at and say man I I'm feeling
[1:22:48] pretty good I I I mean man I'll tell you
[1:22:50] what every P andq but God he knows how
[1:22:53] to bring it around to us and he doesn't
[1:22:55] do it to shame us amen remember he's
[1:22:58] interested in having the preeminence and
[1:23:01] His glory would be made manifest through
[1:23:04] every area of our life he wants listen
[1:23:07] the prophet said in Rising of the sun
[1:23:09] sharing in his victory thank you Jes
[1:23:12] that's so good honesty to stand before
[1:23:14] and say that's the truth Lord I'm I'm
[1:23:18] that that's the truth that that's what
[1:23:19] it's been right there there there's the
[1:23:21] culprit right there let me tell you in
[1:23:23] order for us to come to that place it's
[1:23:25] it's taken Hebrews
[1:23:27] 4:12 the word of the Living God it's
[1:23:31] taken the inspired word of God to come
[1:23:34] down into our lives in this hour let me
[1:23:36] tell you God demonstrated right here I'm
[1:23:39] not I'm not called to be a prophet
[1:23:40] you're not called to be a prophet that's
[1:23:42] not what God has called us to be God has
[1:23:44] that one major prophet that come God God
[1:23:46] doesn't God that's not necessary but
[1:23:48] what it is it's the word that was right
[1:23:51] there on the platform every night that
[1:23:54] was Discerning the conditions and many
[1:23:57] times situations why that people could
[1:24:00] not come to the completion of their
[1:24:02] healing was because there was things
[1:24:05] deeper in their life that they needed
[1:24:07] freed from
[1:24:09] right now you might call me strange but
[1:24:13] I I I I I got a little beside myself
[1:24:16] here even last week after brother Trevor
[1:24:19] mentioned one of the services I didn't
[1:24:20] say nothing to nobody but I just begin
[1:24:22] to worship because the spirit of the
[1:24:24] Lord just began to strike my heart as I
[1:24:25] stood here and I thought about different
[1:24:28] ones down through the prophet's Ministry
[1:24:31] even to where when they would come into
[1:24:33] certain places they they didn't
[1:24:35] understand what was taking place in
[1:24:36] their life they had no idea they thought
[1:24:39] I I've i' I've made this writer I've
[1:24:40] done this and they it's just but the
[1:24:43] spirit of God would so direct the
[1:24:45] prophet right down into those channels
[1:24:48] why because they weren't settled in
[1:24:51] their
[1:24:53] spirit and you know what I'm going to
[1:24:56] tell you if there's one thing we that we
[1:24:58] should aim within our hearts friends and
[1:25:00] we listen we've got a higher aim to aim
[1:25:03] and that's real
[1:25:05] forgiveness I'm telling you real
[1:25:07] forgiveness I'm not oh what the Samuel
[1:25:09] we're in the message what what does that
[1:25:11] mean what does that mean if that if it
[1:25:13] was natural Paul wouldn't have wrote it
[1:25:15] in the book of Colossians he wouldn't
[1:25:17] have wrote it in Ephesians 4 I I I
[1:25:19] believe that I don't believe that was
[1:25:20] Paul that did that I believe he was an
[1:25:22] instrument but I believe it was a spirit
[1:25:24] of
[1:25:25] God my boy we already got brakes pumping
[1:25:30] now well say Amen we'll take some
[1:25:33] services on it probably end up will
[1:25:36] anyhow but true you know we all we all
[1:25:39] want oh God forgive me remember remember
[1:25:42] what Jesus said he said that if you hold
[1:25:46] a in your heart against anybody he won't
[1:25:50] forgive
[1:25:52] you he won't forgive you I just say it
[1:25:54] here today if there's something that's
[1:25:56] tormenting you I just say God if there's
[1:25:59] something I need to make right if I need
[1:26:01] to loosen somebody that I'm holding a
[1:26:04] prisoner in my life so that I can have
[1:26:07] real spiritual
[1:26:09] Freedom Let Me Be Like Jesus who
[1:26:12] released me when I was guilty as a fox
[1:26:15] in a hen house yes
[1:26:18] Lord that's what the Holy Ghost come to
[1:26:20] do oh you may not be walking on water
[1:26:23] but God might call you to forgive like
[1:26:25] Jesus
[1:26:26] forgave come on
[1:26:30] friends we listen don't be ashamed say
[1:26:33] God help me maybe there's an Avenue and
[1:26:35] down in our life where we need the Holy
[1:26:39] Spirit and being honest to say Lord
[1:26:41] search
[1:26:43] me help me
[1:26:46] Lord I want you to think of
[1:26:49] this Psalms
[1:26:52] 139 this a powerful
[1:26:55] chapter David said search me oh God and
[1:27:00] know my heart what an invitation right
[1:27:04] try me and know my thoughts now remember
[1:27:08] this is the same chapter where David
[1:27:09] said thou knowest my Uprising and my
[1:27:12] Downs sitting you knew my members before
[1:27:15] they were ever wrote in your book my
[1:27:19] they were already placed there God you
[1:27:21] know all the thoughts oh how wonderful
[1:27:22] are your thoughts toward me the the
[1:27:25] closing scriptures of that chapter
[1:27:27] search me oh
[1:27:31] God I wonder if we come to the house of
[1:27:33] God how many times that that would be
[1:27:35] the require the desire Lord search me
[1:27:39] search me examine my life Lord search my
[1:27:44] life amen and see if there be any wicked
[1:27:47] way in me and Lead Me in the way
[1:27:52] Everlasting I need help Lord am if you
[1:27:56] find anything in my life I I need you
[1:27:59] you're my big brother I need you to help
[1:28:01] me
[1:28:04] Lord Lord now watch
[1:28:07] this brother takes this up in a and
[1:28:10] standing in the Gap within his own life
[1:28:14] of where a complex had formed in his
[1:28:20] life now I want you to notice these
[1:28:23] these words words when brother Brandon
[1:28:26] was asking the
[1:28:28] congregation to pray for him that God
[1:28:30] will place into his heart what he lost
[1:28:34] out there in that
[1:28:36] complex it's so
[1:28:39] easy to build a
[1:28:43] complex now I want you to notice I've
[1:28:45] mentioned this before but I want you to
[1:28:47] notice 63 June 23 this is 3 months after
[1:28:52] the seals have been
[1:28:54] opened greatest event in the prophet's
[1:28:59] Ministry this complex wasn't built
[1:29:04] overnight that's good right listen we
[1:29:09] take the land
[1:29:10] little by little that's good yeah that
[1:29:14] complex was not something that you know
[1:29:17] it's just like a manufactured home and
[1:29:19] you run it right through
[1:29:21] and no it was it was built now wh watch
[1:29:27] how the prophet places this aren't you
[1:29:29] thankful for this to
[1:29:32] me to me if it had been any probably any
[1:29:34] other oh edit that out oh edit now I
[1:29:36] better not say that I need to make
[1:29:37] myself
[1:29:39] look you see you know you know what you
[1:29:41] know what God did let me just say this
[1:29:43] to you you know where I stand on this
[1:29:44] you know what God did God took a Son of
[1:29:47] God that he was bringing to
[1:29:49] maturity and let you and I see the
[1:29:52] quality of what this spirit will do and
[1:29:56] bring to pass in an individual's life he
[1:29:59] could have took a man that had a
[1:30:01] master's degree or doctor's degree but
[1:30:03] God chose to take a man that didn't even
[1:30:05] have a seventh grade education showing
[1:30:08] it's not about how much we
[1:30:12] know hallelujah it's whether we can
[1:30:15] yield and trust
[1:30:17] God when even the prophet himself had
[1:30:20] met God in a personal way and God be to
[1:30:23] tell him what he was called to do and
[1:30:25] what he was going to do and he said I
[1:30:27] told him I will not be able to do this
[1:30:31] is that the words I will not be able to
[1:30:33] do this it's like Moses I'm not going to
[1:30:35] be able to do that I right but see God
[1:30:40] had already purposed for that and God
[1:30:43] built confidence by his
[1:30:45] word in the life of that Prophet yeah
[1:30:49] you so if we can look at it in that
[1:30:52] right way God took all of that and he
[1:30:55] showed you and I were a Son of God
[1:30:58] coming to
[1:31:01] maturity now watch this brother bam I
[1:31:03] want you to watch what he says uh he
[1:31:06] goes in the very next statement he says
[1:31:08] I had an interview the other day with
[1:31:10] with brother
[1:31:12] wayy and I tell you I've got to know
[1:31:15] more stories about brother way from
[1:31:16] being down in in Jeffersonville with
[1:31:18] good friends I've got down there and I
[1:31:19] thought Lord now I'm just going to tell
[1:31:21] you I'm just going to be honest with you
[1:31:22] I thought Lord there's a lot of things
[1:31:24] that boy you talking about the love of
[1:31:25] God if there's an example I can look at
[1:31:26] how the prophet of God interacted with
[1:31:28] him because there were some real things
[1:31:30] that you know but you know what you just
[1:31:32] look at that and you think well you know
[1:31:33] what God's so merciful and gracious to
[1:31:36] us all right yes he is he really is I'm
[1:31:39] not going to tell you all those things
[1:31:40] but any anyhow you know brother BR says
[1:31:42] it like this he said I had an interview
[1:31:44] the other day with with brother wayy a
[1:31:46] good man but built his
[1:31:50] self around a complex
[1:31:54] another kind of a complex so it was
[1:31:55] different than the one that brother
[1:31:56] brother brandham had he did the same
[1:31:59] thing brother way you can so easily do
[1:32:04] it it's just now watch this it's just
[1:32:07] you get a little something in your mind
[1:32:10] notice not a big something a
[1:32:13] little something in your
[1:32:16] mind you keep thinking that
[1:32:21] way go back now here's really the whole
[1:32:23] thing thing the whole synopsis of
[1:32:25] overcoming go back and check it with the
[1:32:28] scripture oh when when it gets built no
[1:32:33] we have to we're going to have to it
[1:32:34] gets built we got to tear it
[1:32:37] down but when it starts coming in one
[1:32:40] little small thing maybe it's something
[1:32:44] that you perceive a person has done
[1:32:47] maybe they actually have done it maybe
[1:32:49] it's your perception maybe it's
[1:32:51] something that has happened from you
[1:32:53] know earlyer on maybe it was you know
[1:32:55] like brother BR says you can get and
[1:32:56] think he said that all of a sudden that
[1:32:58] somebody walked by you and didn't shake
[1:32:59] your hand and he said if you don't watch
[1:33:01] you'll start entertaining that you'll
[1:33:03] get to imagining that that person has
[1:33:06] something against you and you will be
[1:33:09] the one that will begin acting
[1:33:12] differently towards them that is so good
[1:33:15] W it starts with one just one one one
[1:33:17] one little
[1:33:19] thing wow one little thing so no no
[1:33:23] notice this and you see listen Satan's a
[1:33:26] copycat are you hearing me Satan's a
[1:33:28] copycat this is not this is not
[1:33:30] something he came up with it's little by
[1:33:32] little Now watch how now look how
[1:33:34] brother says that he built his around
[1:33:37] the complex so it's and when brother B
[1:33:40] describes that it's not like the complex
[1:33:42] is something out there but his his life
[1:33:45] now he's build it around that complex so
[1:33:47] the way that he will actually respond or
[1:33:50] even process or even face situations
[1:33:53] will be the basis of that complex even
[1:33:57] though brother wayy is a good man he is
[1:34:00] a Believer but yet that
[1:34:03] complex has got things out of
[1:34:08] line if you notice how brother br will
[1:34:10] say this on and on through the message
[1:34:13] and you think about it he'll talk of how
[1:34:15] it's so easy to build a complex you know
[1:34:19] a lot of times you're going to build
[1:34:20] something you got to have materials for
[1:34:21] building right right that's right
[1:34:24] now the a lot of these right here you
[1:34:25] can get from Menard's Home Depot
[1:34:28] Lowe's a lot of them other places nandex
[1:34:31] on and on and on and on you can get that
[1:34:32] if you're going to build something you
[1:34:33] go and you select certain materials
[1:34:36] right but the difference with the
[1:34:37] complex is you don't get to select the
[1:34:40] materials that come to you because why
[1:34:44] would it be so easy to build a complex
[1:34:47] because of this negative right that's
[1:34:50] right so
[1:34:52] good and can come through each one of
[1:34:55] these things
[1:34:57] experiences sometimes it can even be
[1:34:59] effects from diseases that's come that
[1:35:02] is so good sometimes it's effect from
[1:35:04] Pain it could be from way back right all
[1:35:08] of these different things are actually
[1:35:10] become the
[1:35:12] material that come into a person's
[1:35:15] life I want to remind you brother bam
[1:35:18] would actually take the next service in
[1:35:21] flashing red lights of his coming that
[1:35:23] evening after what I just read you and
[1:35:25] he would say brother way just so you
[1:35:27] would understand that it wasn't about
[1:35:29] you but to understand he said that it's
[1:35:32] by discernment he said probably there's
[1:35:34] not a person in here that doesn't have a
[1:35:37] complex he said how many of you have a
[1:35:40] complex right now probably there would
[1:35:42] have been those at that time you know
[1:35:43] that maybe I don't have no complex maybe
[1:35:45] there have been those that you know were
[1:35:46] just on the spiritual part of it of no
[1:35:48] I'm not going to claim that I'm not but
[1:35:50] you know what brother bam said look at
[1:35:51] the hands that are throughout the
[1:35:56] building all the way through the
[1:35:58] building and he tells us it's so easy to
[1:36:01] build a complex so we can't put it off
[1:36:05] and say well the devil no Satan there's
[1:36:08] a there's situations that he can Inspire
[1:36:11] but it's up to you and I if we accept
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:14] material hey we got a load of material
[1:36:17] for such and such a dress just sign off
[1:36:19] on this right
[1:36:21] here and it depends on whether we sign
[1:36:23] off on it right now sometimes the reason
[1:36:26] listen when we sign off on it it's
[1:36:29] because we have based it on our own
[1:36:34] feelings yes sir oh my Lord sir
[1:36:38] everybody ready for Fellowship
[1:36:42] dinner I don't know about you but I
[1:36:44] don't want to go around the same
[1:36:46] mountains are you hearing me because all
[1:36:49] listen friends I believe in shouting I
[1:36:51] believe in worshiping but if all of our
[1:36:53] Shout and worshiping we continue to go
[1:36:55] around the same Mountain it's time for
[1:36:57] us to get before God and say Lord I just
[1:37:00] don't want victory at 15:30 Lake Breeze
[1:37:04] Road I want to walk with victory in my
[1:37:06] house in my life if I am in the midst of
[1:37:10] Babylon like Daniel was Daniel didn't
[1:37:13] even have the Holy Ghost like you and I
[1:37:16] do and he lived a Victorious Life by the
[1:37:20] portion he was allotted but it's up to
[1:37:22] you
[1:37:24] it's up to you but I can tell you God is
[1:37:28] present he's leading us to minister to
[1:37:31] these things in our lives I don't know
[1:37:33] about you but for me for weeks this has
[1:37:35] just been so exciting it's been things
[1:37:39] that I've looked at and said oh God
[1:37:41] thank you for your
[1:37:42] mercies you say why because many of the
[1:37:45] times the things that we see on the
[1:37:47] surface are not what needs dealt
[1:37:51] with it's what's beneath
[1:37:56] good all these experiences how did
[1:37:58] Brother Bram come of that complex he
[1:37:59] tells us I want you to think how how
[1:38:01] incredible that a complex could come a
[1:38:03] man that has seen Miracle after Miracle
[1:38:06] but he tells us in the message
[1:38:08] indictment that follows these messages I
[1:38:12] had become discouraged right
[1:38:17] right
[1:38:18] wow anybody felt
[1:38:21] discouraged sure absolutely sure Satan
[1:38:23] knows how to point it off he he even
[1:38:25] knows how to point things out he even
[1:38:27] knows how to point things out like he'd
[1:38:28] come around with Nehemiah and them ah ah
[1:38:30] this ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:38:31] rubbish oh this will never happen and
[1:38:33] this will never and it just tries to get
[1:38:35] you discouraged what was happening to
[1:38:36] the prophet was he was preaching this
[1:38:40] message think about this ministering the
[1:38:43] message that God had given to him and
[1:38:46] seeing
[1:38:47] people not accepted right right do you
[1:38:51] realize brother Brandon when he preaches
[1:38:52] statue of a perfect man and he and he
[1:38:54] speaks on the virtue of patience he said
[1:38:57] what do you think about me when I've had
[1:39:00] to have patience where I have
[1:39:01] individuals still cutting their hair
[1:39:03] still wearing things after all these
[1:39:06] years but see God allowed that patience
[1:39:09] even to be formed in his life to me it's
[1:39:11] amazing how God and his sovereignty will
[1:39:13] be working in so many different ways
[1:39:15] God's not like you or I we get a project
[1:39:17] going in our house and we got to do this
[1:39:19] and we got to do that God works in a
[1:39:21] multifaceted way
[1:39:24] there's things that within a person's
[1:39:25] life that here they are they might be
[1:39:27] ever so wrong and yet God is working in
[1:39:30] their life to bring them to that
[1:39:33] understanding while at the same time
[1:39:34] working in our life to manifest
[1:39:37] longsuffering right it's overwhelming
[1:39:40] how God works God does not work in just
[1:39:42] isolated events it's all
[1:39:45] interconnected oh my how many say help
[1:39:47] me
[1:39:48] Lord help me Lord now brother B stood
[1:39:51] there he made a confession this is where
[1:39:53] the key was he made a confession
[1:39:55] discernment had come when the spirit of
[1:39:58] God identified to him this is a complex
[1:40:01] you've got because people won't hear you
[1:40:04] remember what he was going to do he was
[1:40:05] going to make a decision to just go out
[1:40:07] there in the wilderness and and just go
[1:40:09] off there and and you know what that was
[1:40:10] all about that was all about
[1:40:12] him that was all about that complex you
[1:40:15] understand how powerful that is here was
[1:40:18] a Ministry that God had placed upon this
[1:40:21] Earth but shows the human ity that was
[1:40:24] still right there around it had become
[1:40:27] so
[1:40:28] discouraged and that he had come with
[1:40:31] that complex and did not even recognize
[1:40:34] what was going on didn't even recognize
[1:40:37] why he was getting ready and had been
[1:40:40] abandoning the people he didn't
[1:40:43] recognize it let me tell you something
[1:40:45] you or I would not recognize things in
[1:40:47] our life if we can look at that the
[1:40:49] right way God had God took the prophet
[1:40:51] where he saw showed him the seven Peaks
[1:40:53] right there in Montana and begin to show
[1:40:55] him his name and he also pointed out to
[1:40:57] him about the bum on the side of the
[1:40:59] road the bum in the diner and he told
[1:41:02] him it's your decision I'm not going to
[1:41:04] make it for you but if you choose to go
[1:41:06] this way I just want you to know this
[1:41:07] your wife's going to leave you your
[1:41:08] family's going to leave you and your
[1:41:09] ministry is going to be ruined right see
[1:41:12] what it was God had a son there and he
[1:41:16] was had to make a decision see it just
[1:41:18] goes to show God's not going to make our
[1:41:20] decisions for us but when he entrust us
[1:41:22] with decision
[1:41:23] it's even a moment not about just making
[1:41:26] the right decision but it's God wanting
[1:41:29] to mold within us that character amen
[1:41:32] yes of being able to stand with
[1:41:35] honesty and realize why am I making
[1:41:38] right the decisions that I'm making no
[1:41:41] doubt no doubt through this congregation
[1:41:43] here this morning there's many of us
[1:41:46] we've made decisions out of
[1:41:50] complexes if we'll just be honest
[1:41:52] there's things no doubt that God has
[1:41:54] dealt with us time and time again and
[1:41:56] the mercy of God will continue to bring
[1:41:58] us along the way I want you to think
[1:42:01] about this and looking here in the
[1:42:03] scripture let me just move into this and
[1:42:04] deal with this just a little bit can I
[1:42:06] have just a few moments here I want to
[1:42:09] deal with a few of these here I know I'm
[1:42:10] not going to get into other places but I
[1:42:12] want to deal with this and I want to
[1:42:13] approach this here in 2 Corinthians Chap
[1:42:16] 10:3 and I want you to to notice the
[1:42:19] very familiar passage of scripture to us
[1:42:21] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:42:23] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[1:42:27] of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:42:31] through God to the pulling down of
[1:42:34] strongholds well what's a stronghold
[1:42:37] it's a
[1:42:38] retreat it's a fortress it's any
[1:42:42] Reliance upon any reasonings of why I
[1:42:45] can't or why I am or why I do what I do
[1:42:50] that's a stronghold that's so see it's
[1:42:52] some where think about it then then you
[1:42:55] you didn't you didn't lot out land like
[1:42:57] when they do a subd development they buy
[1:42:58] a big old piece of land they go in there
[1:43:01] you see it all around they'll go in
[1:43:02] there and buy out that land and when
[1:43:04] they do then they've already got a plan
[1:43:05] of how they're going to lay out the
[1:43:07] roadways and the C to Sachs and how the
[1:43:09] flow of traffic's going to be and so
[1:43:11] when they do that then they'll bring the
[1:43:13] infrastructure in there and you know
[1:43:14] they're working on that dirt all you see
[1:43:16] is piles of dirt being moved and there's
[1:43:17] infrastructure there's gas lines being
[1:43:19] laid there's electrical lines being laid
[1:43:21] there's drain systems all that that
[1:43:23] stuff is being done and then eventually
[1:43:25] they'll start making the roadways
[1:43:27] through there once they start making the
[1:43:29] roadways what they've already had
[1:43:31] divided out with lots then they'll have
[1:43:33] those lots sectioned off at that time
[1:43:38] and to think about
[1:43:39] it you and I is are not the ones who
[1:43:43] made a choice as to far as to say you
[1:43:45] know what I think I'd like to have a
[1:43:47] stronghold in my life that's right in
[1:43:49] one way and yet in one way we have been
[1:43:52] guilty
[1:43:53] right but yet there's other things
[1:43:55] listen to me now yet there's other
[1:43:57] things that sometimes it isn't even been
[1:44:01] from what has taken place since God got
[1:44:04] a hold of our life right yeah sometimes
[1:44:06] the very things are things that we've
[1:44:09] experienced from even in childhood
[1:44:12] that's right sometimes the things that
[1:44:14] we experien school and other places pain
[1:44:18] rejection all those
[1:44:20] things let me just encourage you this
[1:44:22] morning
[1:44:24] there's not a man that you can read
[1:44:25] about or a woman down through the
[1:44:27] scripture that has not endured and went
[1:44:30] through
[1:44:31] complexes that's true we could pull them
[1:44:33] out over and over you think you think it
[1:44:36] wasn't a complex when they would be
[1:44:38] called Elizabeth the
[1:44:40] baren yeah there you go Seri the baren
[1:44:45] you think there wasn't a battle of a
[1:44:46] complex to be formed when Rachel could
[1:44:49] see Leah given birth right that's you
[1:44:53] see those things moving down through
[1:44:55] down through the scriptures you think
[1:44:57] there wasn't even in the prophets Elijah
[1:45:00] James a man subject to like passions as
[1:45:04] we are
[1:45:05] right Joseph on and on and on we could
[1:45:08] go but here come the perfect
[1:45:10] one yet he came and entered in to this
[1:45:16] walk that you and I walk he didn't come
[1:45:19] by sexual blood so there wasn't any tie
[1:45:22] of any strains that was being handed
[1:45:23] down from Joseph or from Mary he
[1:45:26] borrowed the womb God created amen his
[1:45:29] dwelling place but he came through him
[1:45:32] by the woman through the Virgin birth
[1:45:34] that he might undo what was done in the
[1:45:37] garden and restore that relationship
[1:45:40] with you and I to pay the ultimate price
[1:45:44] for our sins now listen the scripture
[1:45:46] has told us in Hebrews he was tempted in
[1:45:49] all points such as we are yet without
[1:45:51] sin right now you might look at your own
[1:45:54] life and sayl Lord I have fallen short
[1:45:56] many times but he is our Pascal lamb he
[1:46:01] is our
[1:46:03] Perfection and when that life has moved
[1:46:05] into us and brought us baptized Us in to
[1:46:09] his Perfection we are standing there
[1:46:13] redeemed subjects of almighty God oh
[1:46:16] sure we have these battles out here it
[1:46:19] can get sticky it can get susceptible to
[1:46:22] things that will come our way and let me
[1:46:25] just give you another word from the
[1:46:27] prophet as long as you're in this life
[1:46:31] this nature will bother
[1:46:34] you if it doesn't bother you you might
[1:46:37] say well brother Samuel I know so and so
[1:46:39] I I'm not that's what the prophet said
[1:46:41] as long as you're in this life so and so
[1:46:42] is going to bother you the real reality
[1:46:44] isn't so and so bothering you it's that
[1:46:46] you've got buttons you ain't surrendered
[1:46:47] to God there you go and God lets you
[1:46:51] have them buttons to prove the vi ictory
[1:46:53] in his in in your life come on Friends
[1:46:55] listen the change of the body we need
[1:46:57] more than just to go back to being young
[1:46:59] people if we went back to being young
[1:47:01] people we'd have more energy to get on
[1:47:02] one another's nerves a whole lot
[1:47:04] more Hallelujah come on friends we need
[1:47:08] more than that I need my buttons change
[1:47:10] you need your finger pushing buttons
[1:47:12] change we need changed all the
[1:47:15] way but in the meantime God said well
[1:47:18] I'm bringing you to your inheritance
[1:47:20] I've given you an earnest deposit said
[1:47:23] that you might have
[1:47:26] possession of this right
[1:47:30] here
[1:47:33] true oh my I don't remember where we
[1:47:36] were in the scripture
[1:47:38] now casting down imaginations and every
[1:47:41] High thing that exalteth itself this is
[1:47:43] what he was telling brother wayy to do
[1:47:45] against the knowledge of God and
[1:47:47] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:47:49] The Obedience of Christ let me tell you
[1:47:52] something if if you think you're going
[1:47:53] to be strong enough to do that by
[1:47:55] feeding on ESPN on feeding on better
[1:47:59] house house grooming
[1:48:01] housekeeping I listen I'm not friends
[1:48:03] listen I don't believe God's against
[1:48:05] with with with things that there can be
[1:48:07] certain things of pleasure but you got
[1:48:08] to be careful what you're putting in
[1:48:09] your life that's true you got to take
[1:48:12] the word of God into your life that's
[1:48:13] why God told Joshua
[1:48:15] meditate on these
[1:48:18] things why do you think look look look
[1:48:20] look look look look look I don't even
[1:48:23] have Facebook and all that I'm not
[1:48:24] against that but why do you think stuff
[1:48:27] gets on there and things are put in a
[1:48:30] way to cause you to
[1:48:33] wonder that's so good this is put out
[1:48:36] there well I wonder who they're talking
[1:48:38] about wonder who they're running down
[1:48:41] that's right wonder who they're this
[1:48:44] wonder and then throughout the day
[1:48:47] you're
[1:48:48] meditating then you have things going
[1:48:51] on list listen no wonder no wonder the
[1:48:55] depression and anxiety listen friends it
[1:48:57] isn't just all the spirits that are
[1:48:58] congregating they've got to have
[1:48:59] channels to get in amen that's true it
[1:49:03] doesn't even make sense when you stand
[1:49:05] around even in youth meetings and look
[1:49:07] we're here to help but when I think of
[1:49:08] how it burdens my heart with things when
[1:49:10] you see young people dealing with
[1:49:12] depression and
[1:49:14] anxiety and suicidal Spirits it it
[1:49:17] should not be then you realize friends
[1:49:20] it's not only casting it off but we've
[1:49:22] got to look at where is it coming
[1:49:25] from that's so good cuz if you're taking
[1:49:28] a medicine that's making you sick we can
[1:49:30] pray and God can heal
[1:49:32] you but sometime we need the wisdom of
[1:49:35] God for God to say hey you need to stop
[1:49:37] taking that medicine you need to talk to
[1:49:40] your doctor about something
[1:49:42] different everybody with me absolutely
[1:49:45] all right notice this and having in a
[1:49:48] Readiness to Revenge all
[1:49:50] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:49:55] fulfilled I say how how how is my
[1:49:57] obedience fulfilled I'm I'm in Readiness
[1:50:00] to Revenge when my obedience is
[1:50:02] fulfilled obedience is that submission
[1:50:05] in our
[1:50:07] heart that's where Victory takes place
[1:50:10] is in our heart standing there before
[1:50:12] that that complex and
[1:50:15] saying is true
[1:50:17] Lord Lord I Need Your Grace I need your
[1:50:20] strength Lord so good I need your
[1:50:22] deliverance Lord see that's where
[1:50:24] obedience starts with even taking the
[1:50:27] discernment of the word and being honest
[1:50:30] that's why brother BR says I've made my
[1:50:31] confession before this
[1:50:35] congregation and did God work in his
[1:50:37] life God did now watch
[1:50:41] this God being
[1:50:43] misunderstood let me just let me just
[1:50:45] let me just take you through here just a
[1:50:47] just a couple my Lord I wish I wish we
[1:50:49] had two services today
[1:50:53] you don't understand I got to walk away
[1:50:54] with this and this got to be all bottled
[1:50:57] up brother brandom I am saved and have
[1:51:00] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:51:02] Christ but how do I get away from a
[1:51:05] stubborn spirit that I can't seem to
[1:51:09] break away
[1:51:10] from it's
[1:51:12] honesty watch well my Christian brother
[1:51:15] or sister whoever it may be now most
[1:51:18] times when you find people that's got
[1:51:20] stubborn spirits it's usually a complex
[1:51:24] that
[1:51:26] causes this so it's going to the cause
[1:51:31] what's the cause of it either they have
[1:51:33] inherited it from a mother father uncle
[1:51:37] aunt or grandmother grandfather somebody
[1:51:40] like that and if you'll Chase back down
[1:51:43] through your life he said I've taken
[1:51:45] into my experience under
[1:51:47] discernment because I've met cases on
[1:51:50] the platform thousands of those that had
[1:51:52] that Spirit and the first thing you know
[1:51:54] I'd chase that Spirit right back by
[1:51:56] discernment and find that there was a
[1:51:59] granddaddy there was a grandmother there
[1:52:01] was somebody else back there and you
[1:52:04] inherit it wow by Nature W that's good
[1:52:08] so so what H how can that be remember
[1:52:13] every seed will bring forth of its own
[1:52:18] kind the things that we do say our seeds
[1:52:24] yes true let me give you an
[1:52:27] example a brother had called me some
[1:52:29] time back and we were just
[1:52:31] fellowshipping about a few things and
[1:52:33] and we were just just talking about the
[1:52:34] word and he began to relay to me a
[1:52:37] situation I thought my it's
[1:52:39] incredible where in his life his father
[1:52:44] you know raised by his grandfather there
[1:52:46] his
[1:52:47] grandparents after times after Sunday
[1:52:51] evenings Sunday afternoons or whatever
[1:52:52] more instead of getting to play with the
[1:52:54] rest of the
[1:52:56] kids the grandfather would make his
[1:52:58] father sat in the chair in a Sunday
[1:53:03] afternoon and he said you know he said
[1:53:05] brother Samy he said here's what
[1:53:06] happened he said from that moment on he
[1:53:10] said what happened is it developed such
[1:53:13] a stubbornness and I think his dad went
[1:53:15] on to be you know Arm Forces and other
[1:53:17] things like that he said but that right
[1:53:18] there developed such a stubbornness to
[1:53:21] where when there was
[1:53:23] anything to be voluntarily under any
[1:53:26] Authority he would quickly say nobody is
[1:53:30] going to tell me what to do that is so
[1:53:33] good now where did that come from now
[1:53:36] sometimes these aren't things that are
[1:53:37] passed out but you see sometimes even in
[1:53:39] the struggling like this with
[1:53:41] stubbornness where a person could come
[1:53:43] might be sweet nice and everything else
[1:53:45] but let a moment come to where it comes
[1:53:49] to actually being confronted with wrong
[1:53:51] and whether or or not they'll come under
[1:53:53] the authority of it listen our flesh
[1:53:55] always wants to pull back it it hates
[1:53:56] the sting of the word the flesh does but
[1:53:58] when you see something that wants to so
[1:54:00] turn in the opposite direction listen
[1:54:03] friends the prophet was not saying we go
[1:54:05] back and blame granddaddy blame Grandma
[1:54:07] they should have never done this no no
[1:54:09] it's recognizing that the god in you has
[1:54:12] already overcome that thing and to where
[1:54:15] that you need to have that Authority and
[1:54:17] that resolution from your heart by faith
[1:54:20] it stops right here right right it's not
[1:54:25] but first you got to recognize it but
[1:54:27] see sometimes the reason these things
[1:54:29] can build and it gets stronger is
[1:54:31] because we make excuses that's why it's
[1:54:33] a stronghold absolutely it builds and
[1:54:36] builds and before long it's like a whole
[1:54:39] development
[1:54:41] almost it it don't just stop you see a
[1:54:44] complex doesn't just something that
[1:54:45] works and it's just something that's in
[1:54:47] my life it'll affect your family but
[1:54:49] it'll affect your relationship with God
[1:54:52] this is why the prophet when he had that
[1:54:55] complex that God brought him to he told
[1:54:57] us he said I'm not going to go out and
[1:54:59] preach meetings until this is resolved
[1:55:02] he said I will stay around home he said
[1:55:05] I'll preach a little bit here and there
[1:55:06] he said but I'm in every service if you
[1:55:08] listen from standing in the Gap all the
[1:55:10] way through if you listen to it oh
[1:55:12] there's not a service that he won't
[1:55:14] bring it up and ask the people to pray
[1:55:17] for
[1:55:18] him but one thing he said when he spoke
[1:55:20] to those graduates before he ever come
[1:55:22] come home and preach standing in the Gap
[1:55:24] he spoke to a group of G graduates in
[1:55:25] Arizona he said oh he said God showed me
[1:55:29] I was on a road and where I was headed
[1:55:32] he said but by the grace of God I'm on a
[1:55:34] different road now amen he didn't go in
[1:55:37] and tell those graduates about the
[1:55:39] complex but he goes in he said there's
[1:55:40] something I want to share with the
[1:55:42] Tabernacle you see that's what's
[1:55:43] empowerful how could he be on a
[1:55:45] different road because he had come under
[1:55:46] the discernment of the word he had he
[1:55:49] had been honest before God and in
[1:55:53] humility for God to be able to work this
[1:55:55] out in his
[1:55:58] life I may say Lord help
[1:56:01] me help me listen friends I I'm not
[1:56:04] interested in packing around baggage
[1:56:05] like this I I want I want to walk free
[1:56:09] amen Lord search me search me search
[1:56:13] me notice notice brother bam goes on to
[1:56:16] say stubbornness is not of God and the
[1:56:19] only way to get away from that is you
[1:56:21] have to have faith to overcome that
[1:56:24] that's if you're a Christian you're a
[1:56:26] son and daughter of God whichever you
[1:56:28] may be now notice that's that's the
[1:56:30] qualify to be a son and daughter of God
[1:56:32] this isn't something where well I'm
[1:56:33] going to be free of the stubbornness I'm
[1:56:35] going to go down to Mercy Health or I'm
[1:56:36] going to go over the Cleveland Clinic
[1:56:38] where they where they help to you know
[1:56:39] help to make nicer stubborn people or
[1:56:41] you know happier Grumps or you know uh
[1:56:44] uh less uh you know um uh pleasing
[1:56:46] Grudge holders we're not going to do
[1:56:48] that hold hands and sing Kumbaya and
[1:56:50] make chance and chance and chance and
[1:56:53] remember the prophet said we don't grow
[1:56:56] the that little button does not grow by
[1:56:59] bodily exercise of exhortations but it
[1:57:03] grows by a Sanctified consecrated
[1:57:06] yielded life to
[1:57:10] God that is so
[1:57:15] good I tell you what be great thing we
[1:57:17] could do is tell the devil don't I don't
[1:57:19] need no more your excuses right I don't
[1:57:21] need there you go I don't want them
[1:57:24] there you this right here is a problem
[1:57:25] and and what it is it's something in
[1:57:27] here that's causing things to be
[1:57:28] diverted in a certain way even sometimes
[1:57:31] listen friends even sometimes it may not
[1:57:33] even be stubbornness it can be sometimes
[1:57:35] the way that even when the word is being
[1:57:37] preached it can be certain things to
[1:57:40] where that complexes have been formed
[1:57:42] and the enemy has so put things in there
[1:57:44] to where that that individuals are
[1:57:45] actually struggling with the very thing
[1:57:48] that God intends for them to be able to
[1:57:50] receive how could say do that oh he can
[1:57:52] Mar through
[1:57:54] experiences he can come through so many
[1:57:56] Nega negative ways but let me tell you
[1:57:58] nothing's greater than
[1:58:00] God but we'll never be free if we blame
[1:58:04] somebody
[1:58:05] else we've got to be honest and say Lord
[1:58:08] I need help right right notice this
[1:58:12] you'll never be able just to stand there
[1:58:14] and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke
[1:58:16] it it's like a tantalizing rattlesnake
[1:58:19] he's laying there ready to bite you
[1:58:21] that's right but if you will just ignore
[1:58:23] him and walk away from him he can't hurt
[1:58:26] you now this is what's key because other
[1:58:30] places brother Ram will tell us when the
[1:58:32] doctor's report how can I overcome when
[1:58:34] the doctor says you got cancer he said
[1:58:35] you say oh no I don't got cancer brother
[1:58:37] R said oh no you do got cancer but the
[1:58:39] god in you has already overcome that so
[1:58:43] when we look at this if you look how
[1:58:45] brother ra saying this ignore him in
[1:58:47] other words I see the stubborn spirit I
[1:58:50] see what's Rising but I'm not going to
[1:58:52] give any place to it you go I'm not
[1:58:56] going to give any place to it you know
[1:58:58] what that is that's a mature Son of God
[1:59:01] oh I know friends I know I know we we
[1:59:04] all all of us want certain things in our
[1:59:06] life oh God if I can just walk through a
[1:59:08] prayer line and and stubbornness be
[1:59:10] taken off of me but
[1:59:12] listen God intends for that for you to
[1:59:16] walk with overcoming because there's
[1:59:18] going to be tendencies that are still
[1:59:20] there in your life right but this is
[1:59:22] where you recognize the devil at every
[1:59:25] one of his tricks brother Samuel what if
[1:59:27] I fall into a few of his tricks all
[1:59:28] things work together for the good to
[1:59:30] them that are called according to his
[1:59:32] purpose you can say Lord I ain't going
[1:59:34] to keep going but teach me Lord where
[1:59:36] was it where was it that I let down was
[1:59:37] it somewhere that I let down was it in
[1:59:39] my meditation where was it Lord because
[1:59:41] I know what you've done for me I know
[1:59:44] what you've brought me through I've seen
[1:59:45] your grace working in my life to be able
[1:59:47] to stand there and look stubbornness in
[1:59:49] the face and say not today right not
[1:59:52] today right no more you you know what
[1:59:55] you were a constant occupancy at the
[1:59:58] Browning household or whatever your last
[1:59:59] name
[2:00:00] was not today as a matter of fact there
[2:00:03] used to be a seat at the table not today
[2:00:06] Hallelujah there ain't even a booster
[2:00:07] chair for
[2:00:09] you there ain't even no doggy door for
[2:00:11] you to crawl
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:15] through
[2:00:16] hallelujah oh my I feel good don't you
[2:00:20] yes sir don't worry I don't feel good
[2:00:21] enough to keep keep
[2:00:22] going but but but watch this watch watch
[2:00:25] how brother Bram says this and I'm going
[2:00:26] I'm trying Bo I'm trying to bring this
[2:00:27] down he says so when you
[2:00:31] feel that you got a stubborn Spirit when
[2:00:34] you
[2:00:35] feel right when you feel cuz that that's
[2:00:37] the part I could say you got a stubborn
[2:00:40] Spirit not sister Nell I'm just you his
[2:00:44] example but it ain't about that right I
[2:00:46] you got no no when you feel listen
[2:00:49] friends that's that's part of our
[2:00:50] maturity of Sons and Daughters of God
[2:00:52] when we have to be able to look in the
[2:00:54] word and say that's right Lord that's me
[2:00:58] but you know what we're seeing we're
[2:00:59] seeing him what it is God Is Not
[2:01:01] pointing out all the flaw it's his grace
[2:01:05] that he's pointing out this is what I
[2:01:07] called you to be and so when we can look
[2:01:09] at that beholding the beauty in his
[2:01:11] Temple we can behold that and look over
[2:01:13] here and say I'm not measuring up to
[2:01:16] where this is right here Lord give me
[2:01:18] Grace lead me right here Lord lead me
[2:01:21] right here see it's a it's a clear image
[2:01:23] Look Away to Jesus who's the author and
[2:01:26] finisher of our faith glory be to God
[2:01:28] cuz you can't by looking down like the
[2:01:30] chicken in the barnyard you'll never get
[2:01:32] anywhere but the call from Mama Eagle is
[2:01:34] look up look up because you've always
[2:01:38] been taught to look
[2:01:40] down but when the eagle come the eagle
[2:01:42] come and said look up look up look up
[2:01:43] look
[2:01:44] up when you feel you got a stubborn
[2:01:47] Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and
[2:01:51] believe that that thing is dead and you
[2:01:54] will never have it no more watch go on
[2:01:57] and don't even pay attention to it no
[2:01:59] more and the thing will leave
[2:02:05] you
[2:02:07] wo thank you Jesus but that's a battle
[2:02:10] it yeah but remember the promised land
[2:02:13] wasn't picnics that's right it's not the
[2:02:15] Millennium there's
[2:02:17] Wars
[2:02:19] battles and just like God took Jericho a
[2:02:22] certain way AI a certain way and every
[2:02:24] one of them were taken a certain way
[2:02:26] what that showed is in every one of our
[2:02:28] individual portions of our inheritance
[2:02:31] there's certain ways with things in your
[2:02:33] walk with God that God has done in your
[2:02:36] walk right now that if God carries when
[2:02:38] you're a 30y old man 40y old man if God
[2:02:41] terries there'll be different battles
[2:02:43] that will come and God will be guiding
[2:02:45] you to take them battles in a different
[2:02:47] way but it'll be the same
[2:02:50] God God good you know why because he
[2:02:53] wants you to trust him yes yes he wants
[2:02:56] to lead you right let the word lead you
[2:02:58] so it's not always it's not always the
[2:03:00] same way but the outcome is it's victory
[2:03:03] don't you love him my my resist the
[2:03:07] devil and he will flee from you what
[2:03:09] does resist mean get away
[2:03:12] quickly get away
[2:03:14] quickly I don't care you get away
[2:03:16] quickly you you hear something man I
[2:03:18] mean you you're ready you run run from
[2:03:20] it you don't run to where it's at no
[2:03:23] right I mean you hear some commotion
[2:03:25] going on or whatever more you don't run
[2:03:26] to where the commotion are you run away
[2:03:28] from it right
[2:03:31] right that's good I got an image in my
[2:03:34] mind of brother juul forny right now
[2:03:37] brother juel said he said the white man
[2:03:38] goes to find out what's making the noise
[2:03:40] he said the black man runs away from
[2:03:45] it I didn't think I'd ever recover in
[2:03:47] that servant but it's a truth it's a
[2:03:50] truth
[2:03:52] I'll say it like this God make me more
[2:03:53] if I say it like that make me more like
[2:03:55] the black man Lord help me to run Lord I
[2:03:57] don't want I don't need to find it out I
[2:03:59] just
[2:04:01] run run when I hear it
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:05] run now you might call that a Fredy cat
[2:04:08] that that's called smarts that's right I
[2:04:10] don't need to figure it out I don't need
[2:04:12] to know I don't need to figure it out
[2:04:14] it's told resist the devil and he will
[2:04:16] flee from
[2:04:18] you run away quickly
[2:04:23] W so that would be my advice how to
[2:04:25] overcome it we overcome the Devil by
[2:04:28] faith and that's how we overcome all
[2:04:30] evil is by faith not by feelings but by
[2:04:36] faith
[2:04:39] now let me read this to you because this
[2:04:42] is I'm kind of jumping to the end so
[2:04:44] you'll probably hear this one again
[2:04:45] because it's powerful how many remember
[2:04:47] what the other the other time we were
[2:04:48] speaking I well I told you look at those
[2:04:51] words already overcome in the message
[2:04:53] how can I overcome those two words just
[2:04:56] look them up already overcome don't
[2:04:58] parentheses just let them wide open
[2:05:01] brother Bram in prayer he says Lord
[2:05:02] Jesus an hour and 15 minutes
[2:05:06] now standing here trying to take your
[2:05:09] word and explain to the people how to
[2:05:11] overcome you told us how it's done you
[2:05:14] didn't only tell us but you showed us
[2:05:17] how it was done you led us you showed us
[2:05:20] how to do it receive the word inside of
[2:05:23] us and be sure to hold to that word it
[2:05:28] is written in every
[2:05:32] temptation but be humble walk hely then
[2:05:36] we have conquered through you through
[2:05:39] your power which has already conquered
[2:05:43] our enemy and the only thing that we
[2:05:46] have to do is just walk humble with
[2:05:49] faith believing that and our Badge of
[2:05:53] identification of the Holy Ghost and
[2:05:55] Satan has to
[2:05:59] move you believe
[2:06:03] that I'm so thankful for his Mercy
[2:06:08] friends I'm so thankful how God leading
[2:06:10] us down some of these Pathways and
[2:06:12] things like that you say brother Samuel
[2:06:13] is this somewhere in place that you were
[2:06:15] looking at going no but when all of a
[2:06:17] sudden I begin to see God open and and
[2:06:19] speak and begin to deal with these
[2:06:20] things like this just waiting on him I
[2:06:22] said oh Lord you know the you know I
[2:06:24] tell you only thing I can see is
[2:06:26] Victory that's why when I talk about
[2:06:28] excitement all I can see is Victory I
[2:06:31] can see victory in my own life I can see
[2:06:33] victory in the
[2:06:34] congregation why because there's things
[2:06:37] that I believe we come to a place to say
[2:06:38] Lord I'm tired of going around this same
[2:06:40] Mountain that's right
[2:06:43] yes but God give us the grace
[2:06:46] discernment that we need to be able to
[2:06:49] recognize these things in this time yes

[2:07:57] happened in school and you don't even
[2:07:59] realize and you know what you or I can't
[2:08:01] un under uncover that that takes the
[2:08:05] Holy Spirit absolutely I can't do that

[2:08:14] before where he leads me I will
[2:08:17] follow yes put my hand in his hand and
[2:08:23] he'll lead me oh there might be some
[2:08:25] places where there's some
[2:08:27] Giants but his promise made by the
[2:08:31] Living God that's greater than any giant
[2:08:35] that's there squatting in your

[2:09:08] Lord you've been so kind and so merciful
[2:09:12] to us
[2:09:14] Lord
[2:09:15] Lord we We Trust You Lord you you know
[2:09:19] just Lord what what to say what to
[2:09:21] minister and what to bring in our
[2:09:25] lives Lord my my heart and the Heart of
[2:09:29] these
[2:09:30] people were open before you
[2:09:35] Lord I pray that Lord
[2:09:40] Jesus your
[2:09:42] desire and what moves in our
[2:09:45] hearts as we want to see more of you
[2:09:49] Lord less of our own selves
[2:09:54] sometimes Lord
[2:09:55] we stubbornness Lord just just that one
[2:09:58] part that we looked at that it's caused
[2:10:00] by a
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:05] complex Lord I thought about what that
[2:10:07] brother shared with me and like he told
[2:10:10] me he said brother samel if it had not
[2:10:11] been for the grace of God he said where
[2:10:13] would I have
[2:10:17] been he said even when I tried to
[2:10:20] witness
[2:10:22] of the truth to my father he said what
[2:10:25] makes it so difficult is because of that
[2:10:28] right there in his life that he is not
[2:10:31] going to have anybody tell him what to
[2:10:35] do he'll have bosses and other
[2:10:38] things but Lord the word
[2:10:42] itself your
[2:10:45] word we hear it Lord see it in the
[2:10:47] scripture it's Commandments of the Lord
[2:10:51] things that are precepts that are
[2:10:54] given but father your heart's desire is
[2:10:58] all that would be done would be done
[2:11:01] from our hearts Lord the whole
[2:11:05] expression of your
[2:11:07] love was the winning and wooing of our
[2:11:11] hearts Lord in Divine
[2:11:13] love you don't want us to serve you out
[2:11:15] of fear oh there's a
[2:11:18] reverence but the fear of the Lord is
[2:11:20] clean it's it's not
[2:11:25] tormenting
[2:11:27] father many things events situations can
[2:11:31] happen in our lives no doubt Lord's
[2:11:33] sitting right here this morning maybe
[2:11:35] there's things that has been brought to
[2:11:38] light maybe Lord should you carry in
[2:11:41] upcoming
[2:11:42] Services maybe there'll be things Lord
[2:11:45] that it won't even be me as the vessel
[2:11:48] that would be standing here but Lord
[2:11:50] maybe some of the the brothers that are
[2:11:51] coming in here in February that
[2:11:55] father you know Lord I I don't discuss
[2:11:57] with anybody that's coming in here to
[2:12:00] minister I don't even discuss if they
[2:12:01] get on the website that's one thing but
[2:12:03] I don't I don't discuss what I've been
[2:12:05] preaching not what even what I've been
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:09] studying I got confidence in them Lord
[2:12:11] they wouldn't they wouldn't try to fit
[2:12:13] into that but I I've Got Confidence that
[2:12:16] you know what our needs are right
[2:12:18] here and I'm here to tell I'm I'm just
[2:12:20] here to Clare it Lord we need the five
[2:12:22] full ministry we need every a we need
[2:12:26] every gift that Lord that you have for
[2:12:28] us Lord and as your bride like the
[2:12:31] prophet described it like that
[2:12:32] engagement ring that has that diamond
[2:12:35] set in it he described that as that
[2:12:39] bride that would receive the gifts that
[2:12:41] he has sent not only Lord God of the
[2:12:45] five ministerial the nine spiritual she
[2:12:48] receives it all because it's from him
[2:12:52] she's not more taken with the engagement
[2:12:56] ring but it means something
[2:12:59] because it means she's entrusted to him
[2:13:03] his word has sought her
[2:13:05] out and she has submitted her life to
[2:13:11] him oh
[2:13:14] God may you Lord just come in such a way
[2:13:17] as you have been we want to say thank
[2:13:20] you for it through the services like we
[2:13:22] had this past weekend with brother
[2:13:23] Trevor how wonderful Lord you came in
[2:13:26] such a wonderful way and spoke to our
[2:13:29] hearts Lord you know it's you're putting
[2:13:31] it all together it's not brother
[2:13:34] Samuel's program it's not somebody
[2:13:35] else's program Lord we're just
[2:13:37] interested in your program because
[2:13:39] that's the
[2:13:41] program that works it doesn't need an
[2:13:44] update it don't need an
[2:13:47] improvement it's just as effectual Lord
[2:13:52] that program of the Holy Spirit taking
[2:13:54] the word moving down in our
[2:13:57] lives Lord hands throughout this
[2:14:00] building my hand as well
[2:14:03] Lord search me
[2:14:07] Father search me
[2:14:09] Lord if there's things Lord
[2:14:12] undoubtedly like the prophet could ask
[2:14:14] that whole congregation at brandham
[2:14:16] Tabernacle and Lord Jesus they would
[2:14:18] raise their
[2:14:19] hands and he would tell us over and over
[2:14:22] it's so
[2:14:24] easy to build a
[2:14:28] complex
[2:14:29] Lord as Sons and Daughters of God we
[2:14:32] have
[2:14:34] authority to sign the order for material
[2:14:37] that's being
[2:14:38] delivered or to refuse
[2:14:42] it Lord
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:47] Jesus through your strength Lord
[2:14:51] give us strength Lord because many times
[2:14:53] our flesh our
[2:14:57] spirit Lord God would want to be so
[2:15:01] receptive of
[2:15:04] materials sometimes Lord through pain
[2:15:06] and experiences things can begin to set
[2:15:09] up Lord in our
[2:15:11] lives but
[2:15:14] Lord you're here to manifest your
[2:15:17] Victory through our lives
[2:15:21] Lord God may you help us right now this
[2:15:23] morning Lord as our hands are raised our
[2:15:25] hearts are up Lord by by faith we're
[2:15:28] going to take that Lord and if it's
[2:15:31] stubbornness indifference whatever it
[2:15:33] might be maybe it's selfishness maybe
[2:15:35] there's certain things that Lord have
[2:15:37] been prone that we can see in our life
[2:15:39] certain Tendencies but God I
[2:15:42] pray may we lord Jesus look to you right
[2:15:45] now this morning standing there Lord God
[2:15:48] in your presence like the prophet when
[2:15:50] there closing in the message indictment
[2:15:52] he would say Lord I see my errors this
[2:15:55] morning Lord ring out my heart while I'm
[2:16:00] standing before your throne
[2:16:03] Lord oh granted Lord I
[2:16:07] pray Lord help
[2:16:10] [Music]
[2:16:12] us you can
[2:16:14] do what none other Can
[2:16:17] Do Lord there's not a psychiatrist or
[2:16:19] psychologist
[2:16:22] that can do for
[2:16:23] us what you can
[2:16:25] do I'm not saying Lord that times that
[2:16:28] they may not have good things that they
[2:16:30] could tap into but when we stand upon
[2:16:33] the scripture we realize it's going to
[2:16:35] take the renewing of the Holy
[2:16:38] Spirit sometimes Lord there's truths but
[2:16:42] father we need the enforcer of the truth
[2:16:44] the Holy
[2:16:46] Spirit dear God of renewing Lord would
[2:16:48] you just move down I pray Lord through
[2:16:51] each one of our lives and our hearts
[2:16:53] Lord help us
[2:16:55] Lord help us father we want to be more
[2:16:58] like you Lord in this time of renewal
[2:17:01] Lord that you would call help us
[2:17:04] father granted Lord may we recognize the
[2:17:07] safety of your
[2:17:08] presence recognize Lord this is a place
[2:17:11] that we can disclose and open our hearts
[2:17:15] and invite the king of glory the mighty
[2:17:18] conqueror to move in
[2:17:22] granted this morning
[2:17:23] Lord may you move through every
[2:17:26] Avenue if there's one heart that doesn't
[2:17:29] know you Lord and in that way in their
[2:17:31] life where there's a faith on the inside
[2:17:33] to be able to stand with to where that
[2:17:35] Lord in their life they've got a
[2:17:37] confidence I pray that Lord may they do
[2:17:41] just like what the prophet instructed
[2:17:43] the those to do at the end of how can I
[2:17:45] overcome he said if you haven't been
[2:17:47] able to overcome this he listed a lot of
[2:17:50] things
[2:17:51] oh brother brandom I've not been able to
[2:17:52] overcome smoking I've tried I've not
[2:17:54] been able to stop cutting my hair I've
[2:17:56] tried and he went through all those
[2:17:57] things which are are are just attributes
[2:18:00] but he said why don't you stop trying
[2:18:02] and just put your hand in his hand and
[2:18:05] say Lord lead
[2:18:08] me Lead Me
[2:18:11] Lord I say Lord not
[2:18:15] only for any any Heart Lord that would
[2:18:18] be standing Lord before you this morning
[2:18:21] with those requests or others like it
[2:18:25] but for me too Lord lead me
[2:18:28] Father Lead Me Lord
[2:18:32] God lord Jesus as I could see things
[2:18:34] Lord you working moving in my life and
[2:18:38] I'm sure the rest of the congregation
[2:18:40] Lord that they can testify of that as
[2:18:42] well there's things that Lord that you
[2:18:43] bring us to oh these these aren't
[2:18:45] comfortable things lord it's not
[2:18:49] comfortable sometimes Lord when we're
[2:18:51] faced with these things it almost
[2:18:53] becomes Lord a
[2:18:57] moment of
[2:18:59] flight just wanting to move around the
[2:19:02] issue but I believe you've given us
[2:19:03] Grace Lord help us to stand there put
[2:19:07] our hand in your hand and say Lord lead
[2:19:09] me cleanse me Lord and when I see that
[2:19:13] same thing standing there like a
[2:19:14] tantalizing rattlesnake if it's a
[2:19:16] stubbornness whatever it
[2:19:18] is I don't have nothing to prove to that
[2:19:20] that I've laid it on the
[2:19:22] altar I've laid my will upon the altar
[2:19:25] I've laid it there
[2:19:27] Lord and by
[2:19:29] faith I leave it
[2:19:32] there by Faith Lord I walk
[2:19:36] on when I hear
[2:19:40] [Music]
[2:19:43] that I walk away from the
[2:19:46] rattle I may not see the rattlesnake but
[2:19:49] I hear his rattle
[2:19:51] I feel that coming around so when I hear
[2:19:57] that we want to run from it Lord to
[2:20:00] where it goes
[2:20:03] from to where it
[2:20:05] fades from our hearing
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:10] Lord greater is
[2:20:12] he that is in
[2:20:15] me
[2:20:17] overcoming is receiving the word inside
[2:20:19] of us amen and then holding to
