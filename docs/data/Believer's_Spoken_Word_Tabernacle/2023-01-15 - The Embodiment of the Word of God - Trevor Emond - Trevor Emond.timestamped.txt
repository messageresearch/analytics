[34:38] aren't you aren't you just happy to
[34:40] serve the Lord
[34:42] and just good to be
[34:44] it's good to be a Christian it's good to
[34:45] be in Fellowship
[34:47] amen with one another and most
[34:49] importantly what brings that about is to
[34:51] be in fellowship with God
[34:53] amen and we look at it that you know if
[34:56] it wasn't for him well our paths
[34:58] probably maybe never had crossed I know
[35:00] some of your paths crossed from when
[35:02] maybe you were in this community as
[35:04] younger and so forth but the reality is
[35:06] is right now we recognize there's a
[35:09] greater relationship a greater tie than
[35:11] oh you are my classmate oh I remember
[35:13] you you grew up over here there's
[35:14] something we recognize now it's far
[35:16] greater you're my brother you're my
[35:19] sister amen we're part of the body of
[35:22] Jesus Christ amen there can be no
[35:25] greater Revelation than that amen and so
[35:28] we just we thank the Lord for that
[35:30] Benjamin were you were you all going to
[35:32] do that or what okay so I don't know
[35:34] they wanted to do a song but as they're
[35:38] uh making ready for that we want to just
[35:41] remember the service this evening at
[35:43] five
[35:44] but in the meantime we're just here to
[35:47] enjoy ourselves in the Lord this is just
[35:49] a wonderful day I
[35:51] you know I tell you I just I I just look
[35:54] forward to just coming to the house of
[35:56] God because every time God he does
[35:59] something special amen and so God has
[36:02] something really special in mind and I I
[36:04] just I believe that with all my heart
[36:06] and we just want to remember as we come
[36:09] and We Gather here this evening just
[36:12] want to say it just a blessing and a
[36:14] privilege to have brother Trevor and his
[36:16] oldest son brother Zion is here with us
[36:18] as well brother Trevor they just have
[36:21] just a wonderful family his uh his
[36:24] Pastor brother Nathan
[36:26] um brother Nathan Bryant and right there
[36:28] out of Jeffersonville Indiana and uh
[36:31] just really really appreciate brother
[36:33] Trevor and I say this before
[36:35] you know we would they'd sing and
[36:38] introduce him I've watched brother
[36:40] Trevor with just the ministering and um
[36:43] just not only the ministering of the
[36:45] word but that really wasn't what struck
[36:47] me because by before I ever heard him
[36:49] preach he preached here in this in this
[36:51] pulpit and I don't generally I don't do
[36:53] that but you got to know where a man
[36:54] stands in his character and with working
[36:57] with a person at uh when we did it byc
[37:00] together and I seen his heart I've seen
[37:02] the balance even in because when he was
[37:05] working and ministering to the young
[37:06] people and and God is really gifted
[37:09] brother Trevor in that way and I
[37:10] appreciate every gift that God has
[37:12] placed in the body
[37:14] you know you've heard me say it here
[37:15] from this pulpit and we were brother
[37:17] Trevor and I were talking about in a
[37:19] fellowship I said look I I told the
[37:21] people and this is just where I stand
[37:22] I'm just like I'm just a general
[37:24] practitioner
[37:26] specialist I'm just a pastor and God has
[37:29] a pastor to stay and to you know take
[37:31] after the cares and look after that but
[37:33] I'm grateful God has specialists a man
[37:37] that can come in and you know just get
[37:39] out of the way and you know it's the
[37:40] same God different different Veil but
[37:42] it's the same God and you know it's one
[37:44] of those things that sometimes we
[37:46] understand we can become common to one
[37:48] another and we battle against that but
[37:50] it's just something precious that here
[37:52] when God will take another vessel and
[37:54] come in and he'll step down on that
[37:55] vessel and you know hey wait a minute
[37:57] this brother doesn't know me but you
[38:01] know what it is all along what's more
[38:03] important is God knows us
[38:05] and I think that's just wonderful you
[38:07] know that God God shows his love and his
[38:10] care you know even in when correction
[38:12] comes our life you know that's the love
[38:14] of God that's God correcting us and his
[38:16] encouragements in our lives and it's
[38:18] just so precious to serve the Lord I I
[38:21] can't think of any other thing that
[38:22] would be any greater privilege than to
[38:24] serve the Lord and and if I can say it
[38:27] like this to serve the Lord with you all
[38:29] amen it's a real privilege and an honor
[38:31] Amen to be pressing this battle and
[38:34] we're going to make it
[38:36] amen we're going to make it
[38:38] amen I I hope we're setting I know we
[38:41] don't have no clicks or Clans and I
[38:42] don't believe in that anyhow but bunny I
[38:44] hope I get to set close to some of y'all

[47:00] else
[47:07] now somehow I'm supposed to preach after
[47:09] all that so but I guess it gets
[47:11] everybody warmed up real nice
[47:14] I tell you what though
[47:15] um
[47:16] brother Samuel
[47:18] I've always said that uh
[47:20] you all know brother Jack Duff I believe
[47:22] you've had him here and I'm sure he sang
[47:24] for you I've always said that in heaven
[47:26] brother Jack Duff is going to be the
[47:28] choir leader
[47:29] but if he ever needs a break
[47:34] he's got a good backup
[47:38] that was good
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] yeah we were streaming one night I don't
[47:44] remember
[47:45] if we had weather or something like that
[47:47] we weren't able to make it to service so
[47:49] we thought well we'll stream we'll
[47:52] stream brother Samuel and after the
[47:54] preaching he started singing and
[47:58] riffing just a little bit there
[48:01] Zion was like
[48:03] brother Samuel's been holding out on us
[48:08] amen I Love to Worship the Lord
[48:11] so thankful he gives us so many
[48:14] so many Avenues to praising age whether
[48:17] it's in song or indeed or in in word
[48:19] there's poets there's writers there's so
[48:23] many you know God is as brother Brandon
[48:25] says God is in art
[48:27] so we're just so thankful that we can
[48:30] have the best art
[48:32] amen amen I won't keep you standing too
[48:35] long we'll we'll turn in our Bibles to
[48:37] Second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[48:39] 5. um Zion and I as brother Samuel
[48:43] mentioned Thursday night we're at a
[48:45] technology conference
[48:48] um over there in Sandusky
[48:51] but we came Thursday night after
[48:54] you know hearing about
[48:56] you know I can go into it for the same
[48:59] as like oh they speak this different
[49:00] language it's just like wow yeah but
[49:04] we got here and it's like these this is
[49:06] these are my people here okay I can
[49:10] be with these big bearded technology
[49:12] guys wearing star Star Trek t-shirts but
[49:16] these are my people this is this is
[49:20] where my passion is I had a conference
[49:23] like that everybody's all the vendors
[49:25] are looking for people to come and to
[49:27] hire and things like that and started
[49:29] talking to one woman and she's like oh
[49:31] you do this and this and this oh and I
[49:33] was just like look it's just you don't
[49:34] want me my passion isn't in this
[49:38] that'd be terrible for you
[49:40] my passion is this word amen amen so
[49:43] we're just thankful to be gathered
[49:45] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:46] Christ I'm so happy to be with you and
[49:49] have the absolute privilege to stand
[49:51] here and and to minister to you and I'm
[49:53] excited about the day that we have
[49:56] um together
[49:58] um I know I just you know was thinking
[50:01] on the youth service and I had a sermon
[50:03] on my mind that I would have wanted to
[50:05] have brought but just as we begin to
[50:08] seek the mind of the Lord on what I
[50:10] wanted to bring for the or what he would
[50:12] like me to bring for the Youth service I
[50:15] just had
[50:16] Maybe
[50:17] this will kind of be two parts not that
[50:19] the youth that are missing this morning
[50:21] won't be able to catch up this evening
[50:23] but just kind of had a general thought I
[50:26] thought I could use throughout the day
[50:29] so second Corinthians chapter 3 and
[50:31] verse 5.
[50:33] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[50:35] to think anything as of ourselves
[50:39] but our sufficiency is of God
[50:42] who have made us able Ministers of the
[50:44] New Testament
[50:46] not of the letter
[50:48] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[50:50] but the spirit
[50:52] giveth life
[50:54] I'd also like to look at John chapter
[50:55] 10.
[50:57] verses 9 and 10.
[51:03] John chapter 10 verses 9 and 10.
[51:09] says I am the door
[51:12] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[51:15] saved
[51:16] shall go in and out and find pasture the
[51:20] thief cometh not but for to steal to
[51:22] kill and to destroy
[51:24] I am come that they might have life that
[51:27] they might have it more abundantly
[51:30] so it's not just life
[51:32] but it's life more abundantly so I would
[51:35] also ask you why did this message come
[51:39] did this message come from a diff for a
[51:42] different purpose than Jesus himself
[51:43] came
[51:44] when the word comes does it come in
[51:47] different purposes no it comes for the
[51:49] same purpose the word that we have came
[51:52] for the same purpose that Jesus himself
[51:54] came and he says I am come that they
[51:57] might have life
[51:58] and they might have it more abundantly
[52:01] one more if you will with me Hebrews
[52:04] chapter 10.
[52:06] verses 19 and 20.
[52:23] so Hebrews chapter 10 verses 19 and 20
[52:26] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[52:28] enter into the Holiness by the blood of
[52:30] Jesus
[52:31] by a New and Living Way which he has
[52:34] consecrated for us through the veil that
[52:36] is to say his flesh
[52:41] is that me
[52:43] not sure okay we'll just keep going all
[52:45] right let's just bow our heads for a
[52:46] word of Prayer
[52:48] Heavenly Father
[52:54] to approach you o God
[52:56] father can we say to be even able
[53:00] to approach you
[53:03] is amazing Lord because we ought not
[53:08] Lord but by your blood you came and gave
[53:12] us this New and Living Way Lord and
[53:15] you we now have boldness to enter before
[53:18] the throne of grace because we have a
[53:21] high priest
[53:22] Lord we're so grateful Lord would you as
[53:25] we know you're here with us because you
[53:27] promised it and we've invited you now
[53:29] we've praised you Lord and we've
[53:31] worshiped and
[53:33] thank you Lord that one day we're going
[53:36] up yonder not Lord just to be relieved
[53:39] of the sufferings of this world but to
[53:41] be with you o God
[53:45] for you are that relief Lord you are
[53:47] everything that is good and wonderful
[53:49] and we just praise you father
[53:51] Lord we're as we just approach your word
[53:54] may you bless it Lord may you speak as
[53:57] only you can Lord
[53:58] use this gift oh God
[54:01] as we're blessed by your word and we
[54:02] thank you for these things in the name
[54:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you
[54:07] may be seated
[54:13] so I want to take a title this morning
[54:16] of the embodied word
[54:22] and
[54:24] um
[54:27] so I don't know how this is going to go
[54:30] but let's just look at the word of God
[54:32] together can we do that and just enjoy
[54:34] The Fellowship of the word but brother
[54:35] Brenham says in the message the anointed
[54:37] ones at the end time
[54:39] the word is coming to life now
[54:42] and we looked at this scripture here in
[54:44] second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6
[54:47] and maybe if they want to just bring
[54:48] that one back up we'll just have that
[54:50] behind us for a bit but you know that
[54:52] we're able Ministers of the New
[54:53] Testament not of letter but of spirit
[54:55] for the letter killeth and the spirit
[54:57] giveth life and so and we know this and
[55:01] we talk about this and obviously we know
[55:03] you have to have the spirit there but I
[55:05] just like for a moment then I wanna like
[55:07] I want to make things practical as we
[55:09] come down to towards the end of this but
[55:11] but to be to be starting to think about
[55:13] what does it even mean that the letter
[55:15] killeth I mean we we literally are
[55:18] talking about this right yes
[55:20] yeah
[55:21] the most powerful thing ever written
[55:24] down
[55:25] ever
[55:28] and so we shouldn't just like be very
[55:31] well we're in New Testament now don't
[55:33] you know the letter killeth but the
[55:34] spirit giveth life and some people do
[55:36] that and basically it means you know I
[55:37] have the spirit and we don't need this
[55:39] anymore
[55:43] no
[55:45] so what does it mean like
[55:47] can talk about this
[55:48] this what does it mean that the letter
[55:50] even killeth like we just kind of it's
[55:52] like we use that verse to just dismiss
[55:54] it and get into the spirit it's like
[55:55] well that's very dangerous because God
[55:57] gave us the word and so you don't just
[56:00] you don't just throw around well there's
[56:02] kills man don't don't just have this
[56:04] this just kills you
[56:07] as a preacher standing here saying that
[56:10] I don't know that's tough
[56:12] yeah like but yet we get dismissive in
[56:15] that way because we want to say okay
[56:17] well but but okay so so let me ask
[56:19] another question here as we look at this
[56:21] like like how is it that we overcome and
[56:23] we'll look at
[56:24] how Jesus overcame and that's one of the
[56:27] things that we're going to get into but
[56:29] how is it that we overcome
[56:32] he said it but just I would expect
[56:34] everybody knows it's very simple and how
[56:37] is it that we overcome
[56:38] by the word we overcome by the word but
[56:41] the letter killeth in the spirit giveth
[56:43] life
[56:45] so we're Overcoming By the dead letter
[56:48] is that is that what we're like okay
[56:51] brother Trevor you're really confusing
[56:53] us good
[56:55] good that's how I spend most of my
[56:57] sermons is confuse everybody for the
[56:58] first 15 minutes and then and then
[57:00] reconstruct their minds into how it
[57:02] works so um
[57:05] so you were receiving the brother Trevor
[57:06] treatment so
[57:09] so we're gonna overcome by the word but
[57:11] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[57:13] life so we can't disconnect these two
[57:15] things but yet isn't that what what what
[57:17] the scripture is doing here is the Paul
[57:19] is saying the letter killeth the spirit
[57:21] giveth life but we know that like there
[57:23] has to be a way that he can express such
[57:25] a thing but but it happens at our church
[57:28] too don't worry brother
[57:29] um
[57:31] and there has to be a way we can express
[57:32] such a thing to understand just the
[57:34] knowledge of it just just just sitting
[57:37] there and having like what it says isn't
[57:39] enough that's not the point is that are
[57:42] we together
[57:43] to just know the word is not enough and
[57:46] and we could say that the letter killeth
[57:48] in the sense that the law is the thing
[57:50] that does kill us like that the law is
[57:52] what sends us to jail
[57:53] right but but Jesus Christ comes and
[57:55] when Jesus Christ comes Jesus Christ
[57:58] embodies the word and because Jesus
[58:01] Christ comes and is the very embodiment
[58:03] of the word what that produces is the
[58:07] Salvation and freedom to you what that
[58:09] produces is life and not just life but
[58:12] life more abundantly you see Jesus
[58:14] himself being the embodiment of what we
[58:17] would say what we're saying here the
[58:19] embodiment of dead letter is the thing
[58:22] that brings life
[58:23] is that does that make sense to
[58:25] everybody so so so Jesus then being the
[58:28] first fruits Jesus comes then as the
[58:31] firstborn among many Brethren Jesus
[58:33] comes and embodies the dead letter
[58:37] embodies everything that the word says
[58:40] to us and by getting it all not by being
[58:44] what the word is he brings life and not
[58:48] just life but life more abundantly
[58:52] so you remember then that I just said he
[58:54] was the firstborn among many Brethren
[58:57] and what does that what would that
[58:58] indicate to us that would indicate to us
[59:00] that he was the first one to do what
[59:03] many successive after him would do and
[59:07] so so we can say the letter killeth but
[59:09] the spirit brings life but what we're
[59:12] saying in is that that letter is still
[59:14] necessary but it's not just the
[59:17] necessary you know it's not just the
[59:18] letter that we want to bolt on to our
[59:21] lives but it's that letter that when it
[59:23] becomes such a reality it becomes
[59:26] embodied in us that that produces life
[59:30] and life more abundantly and so that's
[59:32] what we're about in today when I say
[59:34] embodied word is how can we then take
[59:38] not to not just leave the letter on the
[59:41] page but rather have the letter come so
[59:44] deeply inside of us that we become the
[59:47] embodiment of this word the embodiment
[59:50] of this message because because that's
[59:53] what I want to be I I don't know about
[59:55] you but I don't I don't want a dead
[59:58] letter telling me do this
[1:00:00] do that like look you know brother you
[1:00:04] know what this message came for it came
[1:00:05] to make your life a lot harder
[1:00:09] a lot more miserable right you know
[1:00:11] there's just so many more laws now
[1:00:12] that's why the message came
[1:00:15] is to weed out all those that couldn't
[1:00:17] do it
[1:00:19] couldn't hack the real
[1:00:21] you know
[1:00:23] that's what it was
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:36] that's not the relationship with Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ that I want
[1:00:44] all right so
[1:00:47] so now though we have boldness to enter
[1:00:49] into the holiest of holies by the blood
[1:00:51] of Jesus by a new
[1:00:54] and Living Way you see why was this a
[1:00:57] new way well because in the Old
[1:00:59] Testament times we didn't have the Holy
[1:01:02] Spirit there was they could begin to
[1:01:05] take the knowledge they could begin to
[1:01:07] structure their lives and try to serve
[1:01:09] God by the letter and what the letter
[1:01:12] told them to do and they could and they
[1:01:14] could be very good at that even but but
[1:01:17] but you know even to Daniel
[1:01:20] as we know he goes into Babylon and he
[1:01:23] doesn't Mar his testimony even though
[1:01:25] he's there amongst the pagans and he's
[1:01:27] doing it without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:30] so he lives in a in a way that's
[1:01:32] pleasing to God he lives in a way that's
[1:01:35] according to the letter but it still
[1:01:37] wasn't what God was looking for you say
[1:01:40] you say brother Trevor did Daniel not
[1:01:42] have what God was looking for that's no
[1:01:43] but you understand the progression that
[1:01:45] God is doing through time the plan that
[1:01:48] he's laying out I'm not saying I'm
[1:01:50] better than Daniel in any way and trust
[1:01:53] me I'm not
[1:01:54] but now I'm at the point where God has
[1:01:57] brought out the New and Living Way by
[1:02:00] the blood of Jesus to cleanse us to a
[1:02:03] place to obliterate sin to make it not a
[1:02:06] fact as the prophet told us that you
[1:02:08] know that the sin question was settled
[1:02:11] at Calvary so the sin question is over
[1:02:13] when the blood is applied that red blood
[1:02:16] the Red Sin you it's white and so you're
[1:02:19] there a spotless bride because because
[1:02:22] of Calvary and so because of that to
[1:02:25] accept him is to to to be born again and
[1:02:28] to receive his holy spirit and that's
[1:02:30] that thing that's quickening what we're
[1:02:32] saying this dead letter is
[1:02:35] right but that's a very important thing
[1:02:37] to think about is how that actually
[1:02:40] happens because it's not happening by
[1:02:43] you being good at serving God
[1:02:46] it's not happening by you being as good
[1:02:49] as Daniel
[1:02:50] and that's what many of us strive to do
[1:02:52] and you say but brother Trevor are you
[1:02:54] telling me you know you just stop trying
[1:02:56] no I'm not not telling you to stop
[1:02:58] trying
[1:02:59] but I'm telling you where to recognize
[1:03:01] where the source of the strength is
[1:03:03] coming from where the source of the word
[1:03:06] and what the word is trying to produce
[1:03:08] trying to understand that the word isn't
[1:03:10] it's that the word by the spirit when
[1:03:13] it's spoken it brings life
[1:03:16] right when we leave it on the page it's
[1:03:18] like okay I must do this I must do this
[1:03:20] I must do this like that's not that's
[1:03:22] not doing anything for us but we should
[1:03:24] still recognize that when God spoke and
[1:03:27] said let there be light there was
[1:03:30] so that word has power when quickened by
[1:03:33] the spirit and when when brought in by
[1:03:35] faith so when we when when you know when
[1:03:39] message Believers and message preachers
[1:03:41] begin to tell you you are the Bride of
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ there should be faith in
[1:03:46] that to take that and to recognize that
[1:03:49] we are living in a day where God is
[1:03:50] looking for a bride he's coming for and
[1:03:53] she will be manifested there will be
[1:03:56] someone here that is going to be that
[1:03:58] Rebecca to come to Isaac
[1:04:01] and by faith we begin to recognize
[1:04:04] that's who we ought to be amen amen but
[1:04:07] the problem is is that many times we try
[1:04:09] to make ourselves Rebecca by bolting the
[1:04:12] word unto us externally by doing the
[1:04:15] works by getting into the thing and
[1:04:17] doing the message stuff and coming to
[1:04:19] brother Samuel's Church sitting on the
[1:04:21] pew
[1:04:24] all right
[1:04:26] but is that how it happens no
[1:04:29] no is that how it happens
[1:04:30] let's look at a few quotes together
[1:04:32] as I said in anointed ones brother
[1:04:34] Branham is saying the word is coming to
[1:04:36] life now
[1:04:38] this is why the message is coming as
[1:04:40] Jesus came to bring life and that more
[1:04:42] abundantly so the message is coming to
[1:04:45] bring life and that life more abundantly
[1:04:47] that word is coming to life now we are
[1:04:50] in the age and time where that word is
[1:04:52] ready to become life where it's been
[1:04:55] planted through the church ages it it
[1:04:57] died and rotted and and but but but
[1:04:59] there in in the in the sixth or fifth
[1:05:02] Church age it becomes to bring that
[1:05:04] stalk out and bring the tussle out and
[1:05:07] bring in bring the shock out and then
[1:05:09] the shock has now pulled away and the
[1:05:11] word itself is now sitting in the
[1:05:14] presence of the Sun and ripening what
[1:05:16] went down is one seed has now multiplied
[1:05:19] Hallelujah so so we're living in the
[1:05:22] days that I am one of the multiplied
[1:05:24] seed that went down yes
[1:05:26] amen and so so it's coming to life now
[1:05:30] and that's what I want I want to be in
[1:05:31] and part of that life so
[1:05:35] brother Brenham says in 1954 why I'm
[1:05:38] praying for the sick
[1:05:39] he says not just teach the word
[1:05:42] but preach
[1:05:43] make manifest the word the word has to
[1:05:47] be made alive it's dead letter Until
[1:05:50] It's Made manifest
[1:05:52] and then it's quickened and it's brought
[1:05:54] to pass what God said about it that's
[1:05:56] the gospel
[1:05:57] in action
[1:05:59] the New Testament Christianity
[1:06:03] in 1963 what a difference he's greater
[1:06:07] than Solomon he's he's contrasting
[1:06:09] idolatry and paganism with Christianity
[1:06:11] he says what a difference it is to
[1:06:13] Christianity though
[1:06:15] we prostrate ourselves before a
[1:06:17] supernatural God that's not an idol
[1:06:22] because what he taught us in
[1:06:23] Christianity versus idolatry is that the
[1:06:25] Pagan would come and prostrate
[1:06:26] themselves before the idol and they
[1:06:28] believed that that God would come down
[1:06:30] into that Idol and speak with them so
[1:06:32] he's saying we're not doing that we're
[1:06:34] prostrating not before an idol but
[1:06:36] before and before a living God a
[1:06:38] supernatural God and then we are filled
[1:06:41] with him and become his Idol now does
[1:06:44] that mean people should start no that
[1:06:45] doesn't mean people should fall down and
[1:06:46] worship you as an idol that would still
[1:06:48] be paganism
[1:06:49] okay
[1:06:50] but what he means is is that we become
[1:06:53] that representation in in that context
[1:06:55] that he's talking about that Idol is
[1:06:57] being the representation of what God is
[1:07:00] coming into now we are that
[1:07:01] representation of what that Supernatural
[1:07:04] God is coming into
[1:07:06] and that's why we should have respects
[1:07:08] for one another as as recognizing that
[1:07:10] that we are the temples that God is
[1:07:13] coming into amen amen
[1:07:15] so so a living his living image of him
[1:07:20] working
[1:07:22] walking on the earth as a living
[1:07:23] representation of God that we serve God
[1:07:28] in a human being
[1:07:29] so today you go home you go to the
[1:07:31] bathroom wherever you're gonna you see
[1:07:33] you look in a mirror I want you to think
[1:07:34] God and a human being
[1:07:40] come on somebody
[1:07:42] because that's what we're talking about
[1:07:43] it's not looking in the mirror and going
[1:07:45] oh God I failed you so bad so many times
[1:07:47] I'm such I'm such worthless flesh I I
[1:07:50] really have nothing you know look yes
[1:07:52] nothing in my arms like I bring simply
[1:07:54] to thy cross I claim yes absolutely but
[1:07:56] then but then that new birth comes and
[1:07:58] that Supernatural God comes into you and
[1:08:00] you become the bearer of His Image you
[1:08:03] you are the representation of him to
[1:08:05] this world and those around you and how
[1:08:07] is it that I can say to you you know
[1:08:09] look I'm just a representation to
[1:08:11] everyone at Chick-fil-A and wherever you
[1:08:14] know at the schools and wherever I'm
[1:08:16] just the representation of Christ
[1:08:17] walking around but then I look in the
[1:08:19] mirror and I'm kind of like yeah you're
[1:08:21] just such a loser
[1:08:24] preach now well it can be God's image to
[1:08:26] everybody else but me why well how are
[1:08:28] you going to have the faith to recognize
[1:08:30] that if I can't see God in myself not
[1:08:33] because of me but because the word is
[1:08:35] becoming alive in me because God is
[1:08:39] doing what he said he would do
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:08:44] so look in the mirror today and say God
[1:08:46] in a human being and let your faith rise
[1:08:49] and throw off the doubts that the devil
[1:08:51] would try to put on you and say you're
[1:08:53] not good enough and you can't do it
[1:08:55] because it's not about the dead letter
[1:08:56] all right
[1:08:58] come on
[1:09:01] it's about the life that he's putting in
[1:09:03] you and growing in you and that that
[1:09:05] that life should be feeding on the word
[1:09:07] of God and strengthening and that and
[1:09:09] and it should be changing
[1:09:12] this flesh from the inside out it's
[1:09:15] contrary to paganism they fall before a
[1:09:17] Mary or a Joseph or some Saint something
[1:09:19] other like that that's been dead for
[1:09:21] years but you see the Holy Spirit comes
[1:09:23] into the living being not into a dead
[1:09:26] Idol
[1:09:28] you're not a dead Idol it's a living
[1:09:30] being that God himself is coming into
[1:09:34] but into the living being and works
[1:09:37] through that living being not through an
[1:09:39] idol ye are temples of God
[1:09:41] so
[1:09:43] one of my favorite quotes here
[1:09:46] 1954 the word became flesh flesh India
[1:09:49] trip report
[1:09:51] he says you can express it by a mental
[1:09:53] conception now many of us have that we
[1:09:55] we try to express this message through
[1:09:57] message mental conception we try to do
[1:10:00] what the we're supposed to be doing
[1:10:01] we're taught and we're trying to do it
[1:10:03] externally and that's fine that's you
[1:10:05] should do that but recognizing that that
[1:10:08] sanctification process is is Paving way
[1:10:11] for God to come and make the actual
[1:10:13] change
[1:10:14] amen so
[1:10:16] you see it before it happened if it
[1:10:19] becomes a revelation real revelation of
[1:10:21] God and express it in word form and that
[1:10:23] word takes hold and becomes material a
[1:10:25] thought expressed
[1:10:27] see if your heart and mind is so filled
[1:10:29] with God's spirit until your thoughts
[1:10:31] become his thoughts
[1:10:33] there you are when your mind and your
[1:10:34] leading and your guiding becomes a
[1:10:36] direct place or a direct inspiration of
[1:10:38] the Holy Spirit that's moving your
[1:10:40] mortal being now how many of us uh can
[1:10:42] say that's that's exactly that's exactly
[1:10:44] a picture of my life what brother I'm
[1:10:46] talking about is that my mind and my
[1:10:48] leading and my guiding becomes a direct
[1:10:49] place or direct inspiration of the Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit
[1:10:52] uh I mean
[1:10:55] I mean yes does he want us to say it in
[1:10:59] faith or is he
[1:11:05] what I want to show you today is I
[1:11:07] believe I
[1:11:09] I believe that we're better at that than
[1:11:10] we'd give ourselves credit for
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:14] and it's because the word is changing
[1:11:16] you
[1:11:18] you see we try to separate those two
[1:11:20] things it's there's me and then there's
[1:11:22] the word
[1:11:23] and what I'm trying to to bring out
[1:11:25] today is to say that that word is
[1:11:27] becoming embodied in you and your
[1:11:30] thoughts but by the quickening of the
[1:11:32] spirit are becoming his thoughts that
[1:11:35] that that you're not doing it right if
[1:11:37] that's not like like well look we so we
[1:11:40] we want this to like we think about like
[1:11:41] I read that and go like my thoughts
[1:11:43] becoming direct leading and in filling
[1:11:45] of his you know like just like his
[1:11:46] thoughts and it's just like wow that's
[1:11:48] got to be amazing it's like I shut my
[1:11:50] own mind off and it's his mind
[1:11:54] and that's one way of thinking about it
[1:11:56] and that's kind of what's happening but
[1:11:57] it but but but think about what we're
[1:12:00] saying is it's like actually I'm just
[1:12:02] you know I'm just a dumb terminal here
[1:12:05] that God is using sorry techie speak
[1:12:07] there you know like I'm just you know
[1:12:09] I'm just I'm just a puppet
[1:12:11] now and God is now it my mind is gone
[1:12:15] God's mind is now here it's supernatural
[1:12:17] and I just get to sit back and go wow
[1:12:19] this is so amazing look at God use me
[1:12:22] whoa
[1:12:24] like that's what we think about it when
[1:12:26] God is my you know my mind is so
[1:12:28] infilled with Gods that's just him like
[1:12:30] it's just and I can stand back and go
[1:12:31] wow that was totally God
[1:12:33] but what I'm saying is when the word
[1:12:35] becomes embodied you become changed and
[1:12:38] molded like him and your thoughts become
[1:12:40] so like his that that the holy spirit is
[1:12:43] reporting back and saying look at this
[1:12:45] son just like a chip off the old block
[1:12:47] he's just like you what does that mean
[1:12:49] that when I think about a situation it's
[1:12:52] like God is thinking about a situation
[1:12:54] that as I grow in him he's building me
[1:12:57] and strengthening me and I'm becoming
[1:13:00] and changing being changed like him from
[1:13:03] glory to glory he's changing me changing
[1:13:06] me changing me well how has he changed
[1:13:09] you well I don't know I'm just waiting
[1:13:10] for him to just supernaturally do stuff
[1:13:13] oh my God you can't sing that song that
[1:13:16] he's changing me and then expect
[1:13:18] everything that he's going to do through
[1:13:19] this worthless bag of flesh is going to
[1:13:21] be totally Supernatural
[1:13:24] no but what he's doing is he's fusing
[1:13:27] the supernatural into the natural you
[1:13:30] know this is because isn't why are we
[1:13:31] becoming like Christ and there's a quote
[1:13:33] brother Adam talks about you know the
[1:13:35] disciples were confused sometimes
[1:13:37] because they couldn't tell if it was the
[1:13:38] man or The God speaking which one was
[1:13:41] speaking Jesus the man or Jesus God we
[1:13:44] but it because it was so fused together
[1:13:46] yes sir it's not that Jesus wasn't a man
[1:13:49] all right right
[1:13:51] but that man fully embodied God and he
[1:13:54] was sinless well by his sinful sinless
[1:13:56] sacrifice I now stand redeemed before
[1:13:59] his presence he sees me as he sees his
[1:14:02] own son
[1:14:04] amen so is it too presumptuous to think
[1:14:07] then that as that word comes into my
[1:14:10] life and is quickened by the holy spirit
[1:14:12] that I that people might be confused
[1:14:14] like Trevor was that you or God speaking
[1:14:16] all right come on yes sir yes sir and
[1:14:20] it's not like well no of course I know
[1:14:22] it was God because did you hear that
[1:14:23] wind come through and come into me and I
[1:14:25] shook all over like brother Samuel
[1:14:30] brother
[1:14:31] it's download right there
[1:14:34] was there a still small voice
[1:14:36] that was indiscernible that something
[1:14:38] happened that was Supernatural but it
[1:14:41] seemed so natural
[1:14:46] this is the embodiment of the word of
[1:14:49] God Amen
[1:14:51] that should be happening to you and
[1:14:53] changing you what kind of people he says
[1:14:56] should we be
[1:14:59] if the very Holy Spirit has you so
[1:15:03] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:15:06] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:15:08] mind you don't use your own opinion but
[1:15:10] the Holy Spirit has you so built amen
[1:15:14] until your thoughts your being is God's
[1:15:19] spirit expressing itself through you
[1:15:23] what kind of church would we be
[1:15:26] and again I just want to say like I I
[1:15:28] don't believe that this is some
[1:15:29] Supernatural like always this rushing
[1:15:32] wind coming through but God is building
[1:15:34] you
[1:15:35] he has you so built
[1:15:38] what is the process if it's supernatural
[1:15:41] always that your mind is like well I'm
[1:15:43] thinking his thoughts because there's
[1:15:44] always the supernatural thing happening
[1:15:46] to me
[1:15:47] then how is that building you
[1:15:49] what is being built
[1:15:52] but God wants to mold you into His Image
[1:15:55] he wants to take your thoughts and teach
[1:15:57] you and and Quicken you and you you sir
[1:16:01] as you surrender to him as you you
[1:16:03] consecrate yourself for him and say God
[1:16:05] here is a being that you can use here is
[1:16:08] someone
[1:16:09] yeah
[1:16:10] God that you can build
[1:16:14] oh what kind of people would we be this
[1:16:16] morning if this Branham Tabernacle was
[1:16:18] so filled with the presence of God and
[1:16:20] you didn't use your own mind or thoughts
[1:16:22] and didn't have no alternative of your
[1:16:24] own but just be led
[1:16:31] the message desperations he says
[1:16:33] it's it's not just a preacher it's not a
[1:16:36] certain congregation
[1:16:38] it's the Holy Spirit showing the same
[1:16:40] thing it did when it was embodied in the
[1:16:42] body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied
[1:16:46] in the body of his bride it should throw
[1:16:49] us into desperation
[1:16:53] amen so what is he saying he was it did
[1:16:55] when it was when it was embodied in
[1:16:57] Jesus Christ
[1:16:59] now embodied in his bride
[1:17:03] so we should begin to understand that
[1:17:05] that if we're calling ourselves
[1:17:06] Christians well they called themselves
[1:17:07] Christians they called them Christians
[1:17:09] because they were christ-like what was
[1:17:10] it they were Christ like well they
[1:17:12] helped little old ladies across the
[1:17:13] street because as we all know that's
[1:17:14] what Jesus did because he was so caring
[1:17:16] he helped little old ladies across the
[1:17:18] street and they showed Christian works
[1:17:21] ah
[1:17:22] I think it was more than that right like
[1:17:24] it was more than just kindness it was
[1:17:26] more than just but but but his body like
[1:17:28] he he exhibited peace he exhibited
[1:17:30] Holiness he he embodied these things you
[1:17:33] you came around him and you knew
[1:17:34] something was different that that this
[1:17:36] man was held and carried himself by a
[1:17:39] different way by a different wisdom by a
[1:17:42] different by by a different character of
[1:17:44] being
[1:17:47] amen so this is what this is what we're
[1:17:49] talking about when we when we talk about
[1:17:50] being embodied what it what it means is
[1:17:53] is that we're taking the truth and the
[1:17:57] meaning the the word itself and it's
[1:18:00] becoming produced so so because here and
[1:18:04] I don't want to get too thinky or too
[1:18:05] philosophical here but but so well let's
[1:18:09] just we'll put it in we'll put it in
[1:18:11] Pixar terms I know no one watches Pixar
[1:18:13] movies here in this church or anything
[1:18:14] like that but you know you've probably
[1:18:16] heard at least of the this little movie
[1:18:18] they did called inside out where there
[1:18:20] was these these five little
[1:18:22] guys be people inside of this little
[1:18:25] girl's head
[1:18:28] and one of them was named Joy
[1:18:30] and so I just you know maybe if you
[1:18:32] haven't even seen the movie that's fine
[1:18:33] that's that's that's great you know I'm
[1:18:35] not here promoting watching movies or
[1:18:37] not watching movies or just I'm just
[1:18:39] here promoting the embodiment of the
[1:18:41] word of God so I just want to bring this
[1:18:42] concept out though and you know kind of
[1:18:47] normal vernacular
[1:18:50] so
[1:18:51] so what these five characters in this
[1:18:54] young girl's head are and they're
[1:18:55] they're watching through her eyes
[1:18:57] they're up in her brain and they're
[1:18:58] watching through her eyes and one of
[1:19:00] them is called Joy
[1:19:02] why do you think this character's name
[1:19:04] was Joy
[1:19:05] she was the one who exhibited the
[1:19:07] emotion joy and then there was a you
[1:19:11] know red rather Square guy who's whose
[1:19:15] name was anger
[1:19:18] I'll ask the same question why do you
[1:19:20] think his name was anger
[1:19:23] and then there were three others that I
[1:19:24] don't remember their names
[1:19:28] I only saw it once
[1:19:30] um but I can tell you that they they had
[1:19:33] an emotion names
[1:19:35] right
[1:19:37] so what we're doing here is we're
[1:19:39] telling a story of a young lady but what
[1:19:42] we're doing is embodying
[1:19:44] emotions inside her head and the story
[1:19:49] is portrayed in this way because if you
[1:19:52] just say well joy
[1:19:53] but joy is of course for the salmon
[1:19:55] don't you
[1:20:00] don't you how are you going to describe
[1:20:02] Joy
[1:20:03] well someone who's joyful is usually
[1:20:05] smiling
[1:20:06] okay
[1:20:08] somebody who's joyful like you know they
[1:20:11] carry themselves and
[1:20:15] joyful
[1:20:17] right so so what am I doing right now
[1:20:19] before you
[1:20:20] as I describe the concept of Joy I have
[1:20:24] to for before we can conceptualize what
[1:20:27] it is
[1:20:30] we embody that to describe that
[1:20:34] so here I am like I joyful
[1:20:37] like so so in this movie Anger is is
[1:20:41] um
[1:20:42] he's he's he's colored red well why is
[1:20:45] he why is he a red color Well because
[1:20:47] most of us when we get angry our faces
[1:20:50] get a little flush looking
[1:20:52] and we get red so what are we doing
[1:20:54] we're describing the emotion by
[1:20:57] embodying it and turning it red and he's
[1:20:59] got little Flames coming out of his
[1:21:02] his head
[1:21:03] so my daughter was she wanted she likes
[1:21:06] me to draw with her sometimes and then I
[1:21:08] don't do it near enough
[1:21:09] um but but we're drawing one day and it
[1:21:11] was not too long after we had seen this
[1:21:13] yeah I watched it okay so we had seen
[1:21:17] this movie and so we're she's drawing
[1:21:19] joy and so I won't
[1:21:20] draw anger so
[1:21:22] and I'm not really that great of a
[1:21:24] drawer but I'm you know I'm illustrator
[1:21:26] drawer whatever the word is you know
[1:21:28] um and so I'm drawing it and I color him
[1:21:30] red and he's got his little flames you
[1:21:32] know and then I put a little thing under
[1:21:33] there and I said and it says do you want
[1:21:35] some tea
[1:21:36] because like I'm just like but tea is
[1:21:38] like in all caps it's like do you want
[1:21:41] some tea you know it's like
[1:21:44] so I was like because anger you know he
[1:21:46] can't you know he that's how he
[1:21:47] communicates he communicates in an angry
[1:21:49] way it's like but again what have I just
[1:21:51] done now I'm I'm in a simple statement
[1:21:54] do you want some tea I'm now embodying
[1:21:57] anger to communicate the the emotion or
[1:22:00] the expression of what anger is by
[1:22:02] saying do you want some tea
[1:22:04] it's like do you have to ask so angry
[1:22:07] yeah
[1:22:09] because I'm angry
[1:22:11] why are you angry I just am
[1:22:14] so what am I doing like I can I can
[1:22:16] embody anger and embodying anger we can
[1:22:19] begin to understand it and so and so
[1:22:22] this is what a lot of the ancient
[1:22:23] writers you know the Greek playwrights
[1:22:25] and all of these you know way back in
[1:22:27] time what they they would do is they
[1:22:29] would take these gods and they would
[1:22:30] give them names that meant the thing
[1:22:33] that they were and and what that was to
[1:22:35] do was so that they could play with
[1:22:37] embodying the emotion so that they could
[1:22:40] write this play or write this story so
[1:22:43] that people could sit there and go oh
[1:22:45] that's why I do that kind of thing or I
[1:22:48] understand why he would make those
[1:22:49] decisions because now I can now I can
[1:22:52] play with the understanding
[1:22:55] of what that emotion is or what that
[1:22:57] thing is I hope I didn't just get too
[1:23:00] thinky on you
[1:23:01] we all together now we're beginning to
[1:23:03] understand
[1:23:04] so as so so then so then if we take
[1:23:08] concepts of emotions and we could say
[1:23:10] well you can embody it as joy and you
[1:23:13] can embody it as anger what we're
[1:23:15] talking about though is embodying the
[1:23:18] word of God we're talking so what is the
[1:23:20] word of God well Jesus was the word of
[1:23:23] God Express right
[1:23:25] and brother Branham then would teach us
[1:23:27] that he said I used to think that God
[1:23:29] was angry with me but that Jesus loved
[1:23:32] me
[1:23:34] but then I found out that Jesus was the
[1:23:38] very Heart Of God Amen so the very Heart
[1:23:42] Of God was expressed and embodied to us
[1:23:46] when he created a body for him to come
[1:23:49] and live inside of now I want to call
[1:23:52] your attention back to what I said
[1:23:54] earlier in this sermon now twice that he
[1:23:57] was the firstborn among many
[1:24:00] brother
[1:24:03] and who's that many
[1:24:05] so if Jesus is the heart of God Express
[1:24:08] becoming embodied and they call people
[1:24:11] who came after him Christians why did
[1:24:14] they call them Christians because they
[1:24:16] were embodying the same the same
[1:24:19] characters not just doing not just
[1:24:22] helping little old ladies across the
[1:24:24] street like Jesus did and not just
[1:24:26] healing people like Jesus did it wasn't
[1:24:29] just the works but it was the embodiment
[1:24:31] and the expression of the character of
[1:24:34] The Heart Of God coming into the person
[1:24:38] hmm
[1:24:39] and that's what I want to be
[1:24:43] because this world needs not just dead
[1:24:46] letter they don't just need us
[1:24:48] expressing it by having great healing
[1:24:50] lives they don't need it just expressed
[1:24:52] by you know having visions that come to
[1:24:55] pass and predicting the future all of
[1:24:57] these kinds of things that Jesus Christ
[1:24:59] himself can and did do
[1:25:02] and that he's doing today in the body
[1:25:06] but it's not merely that but those
[1:25:09] things are coming because they're the
[1:25:11] expression of the heart of God and
[1:25:14] that's what this world needs today
[1:25:15] brother Branham says this world is dying
[1:25:18] for love
[1:25:19] the church is dying because of lack of
[1:25:23] love
[1:25:24] so what we need then is that word not
[1:25:28] just the things that it produces and the
[1:25:30] hair and the dresses and the no shorts
[1:25:32] and no drinking and stop your dirty
[1:25:34] jokes and quit this and quit that and
[1:25:45] but this word then if Jesus says I am
[1:25:50] come that you could have life and that
[1:25:52] you might have life more abundantly
[1:25:55] that's what this message has come to do
[1:25:57] to give you life and that life more
[1:26:00] abundantly but not to just like okay so
[1:26:03] now I'm a message believer no but what
[1:26:05] is that word coming that word is coming
[1:26:07] to be embodied in his bride that they
[1:26:11] could be the expression not merely of
[1:26:13] his works but those works are the
[1:26:15] expression of the character that's
[1:26:17] become embodied in The Believer so where
[1:26:21] Jesus Christ is joy
[1:26:23] all right your life is expressing Joy
[1:26:27] amen where Jesus Christ is angry with
[1:26:29] sin your life is expressing anger at sin
[1:26:33] you understand the metaphor here I'm
[1:26:35] connecting these things together right
[1:26:36] so so we become the embodiment not just
[1:26:40] of what the word is saying to us to do
[1:26:43] but the understanding underneath what
[1:26:46] it's saying so Jesus comes and preaches
[1:26:49] on on The Sermon on the Mount and they
[1:26:51] begin to understand it's not just
[1:26:52] killing your brother that's wrong
[1:26:56] but the character underneath that you
[1:27:00] see what the the law was the expression
[1:27:03] of the character that God was trying to
[1:27:06] portray to the people
[1:27:09] so then and when Jesus comes and he
[1:27:11] embodies that word he's telling you
[1:27:13] you're missing it it's not just about
[1:27:15] not killing
[1:27:17] right
[1:27:18] it's not just about not cutting your
[1:27:20] hair
[1:27:21] right it's not just about not smoking
[1:27:25] it's not just about not not not not not
[1:27:27] this not that this isn't a message of
[1:27:30] knots
[1:27:31] that's true
[1:27:33] maybe we think that so often like I can
[1:27:36] do this I can't and it's not a message I
[1:27:38] can't it's a message of the the Heart of
[1:27:42] Jesus Christ expressed that you could
[1:27:44] have life and that you might have it
[1:27:46] more abundantly now you might think you
[1:27:48] have better ideas on what Abundant Life
[1:27:50] looks like but I tell you that's where
[1:27:52] you're confused and that's where many
[1:27:54] have gone before and said yeah I didn't
[1:27:56] think it was this way either I didn't
[1:27:58] and I went this way and I went that way
[1:28:00] and now every single one of them that
[1:28:02] everyone did
[1:28:04] right
[1:28:05] right and they're every one of them
[1:28:07] locking
[1:28:11] they don't have that thing that lasts
[1:28:13] because they don't have the audience
[1:28:17] of it these sports players they go out
[1:28:18] and they look to win trophies and they
[1:28:20] strive and they train I gotta win a
[1:28:22] trophy and then they win the trophy and
[1:28:25] what do they have the next day
[1:28:27] a trophy
[1:28:39] but what's in here yes sir where is that
[1:28:42] that's right is that fulfillment there
[1:28:44] and they get depressed because you know
[1:28:46] you know they spent a whole tournament
[1:28:48] that took two weeks or a month or
[1:28:50] whatever aiming for something expecting
[1:28:52] something going after something there
[1:28:54] was so much in their heart but then when
[1:28:56] they achieved it it was like okay but
[1:28:58] all of that's gone it's like you know
[1:29:00] it's like
[1:29:01] oh goodness I don't know where people
[1:29:02] stand on Christmas but you know again
[1:29:04] common vernacular here you know it's
[1:29:06] like after you finish opening presents
[1:29:08] on Christmas morning
[1:29:09] yeah yeah
[1:29:11] yeah the expectation is gone
[1:29:16] I have the stuff but the expectation's
[1:29:19] gone and I just
[1:29:20] it's not as
[1:29:25] 8 A.M at Christmas morning is way better
[1:29:28] than 2 p.m I'm telling you
[1:29:31] when the when the presents are still
[1:29:32] wrapped man it's
[1:29:34] exciting after the presents are
[1:29:36] unwrapped it's like well now I know
[1:29:40] you got an Apple Watch man yeah it's
[1:29:42] right here
[1:29:45] it's nice isn't it
[1:29:48] I don't actually have one
[1:29:50] um
[1:29:52] what do you have on Apple watch on my
[1:29:54] wrist but do you have the expectation do
[1:29:56] you do you have some excitement is there
[1:29:58] some like is it per has it no it hasn't
[1:30:00] produced anything but that's what this
[1:30:02] word is coming to do this word is is the
[1:30:05] expression of the heart of God that is
[1:30:07] Holiness that is love that is peace that
[1:30:09] is joy that is patience all that is good
[1:30:11] all that is wonderful is expressed
[1:30:13] through this word and and and the desire
[1:30:16] of God is that the character of that
[1:30:19] word be embodied in you building you not
[1:30:22] just giving you life but that life more
[1:30:24] abundantly
[1:30:25] Oh Glory to God
[1:30:28] well we're on page two and I just
[1:30:30] started had brother Brian it's Brian
[1:30:32] right we had brother Brian helping me
[1:30:34] print out notes and it just stayed Pages
[1:30:36] just kept coming you know after page
[1:30:38] four or five he was like
[1:30:41] I was like don't worry brother I may not
[1:30:43] use all of them
[1:30:46] the last one though was blank just so
[1:30:48] you know brother Brian there's actually
[1:30:49] only seven pages of
[1:30:52] I'm about to flip to three
[1:30:57] to God nobody's nervous now
[1:31:00] oh
[1:31:01] so I just want to break this down what
[1:31:03] time we got
[1:31:04] is that 12 30 is that is that right
[1:31:09] oh my
[1:31:11] God
[1:31:12] Church started at 11.
[1:31:14] Oh Glory
[1:31:17] so they had a long song before I got up
[1:31:19] it was probably 11 45. so I haven't even
[1:31:21] been it's 45 minutes but the brand since
[1:31:23] I should probably stop okay
[1:31:26] but I have to bring some application
[1:31:28] here
[1:31:32] Jesus Christ when he overcomes
[1:31:34] the devil in the wilderness how does he
[1:31:38] do that
[1:31:39] by the word by the word right that's
[1:31:42] that's what we're taught we're taught
[1:31:43] the devil is tempting you
[1:31:46] because of this story we know this and
[1:31:48] we're taught this like the devil is
[1:31:50] tempting you you give him the word
[1:31:53] how's that worked out for you
[1:31:57] some people laugh because they're like
[1:31:59] wait a second this preacher just talks
[1:32:01] funny we don't quite understand like
[1:32:03] he's like how's that worked out for you
[1:32:04] like as if we're expecting what we're
[1:32:06] taught isn't actually working well it
[1:32:08] should work if we're doing it if we're
[1:32:10] actually embodying the word
[1:32:13] but if the dead letter is what we're
[1:32:15] throwing at the Devil
[1:32:17] well as a little it's like so you're
[1:32:20] sitting there
[1:32:21] Temptation in the computer screen there
[1:32:23] in front of you
[1:32:26] young men are tempted with these things
[1:32:28] young women these days are tempted with
[1:32:29] these things
[1:32:30] How Far We've Fallen
[1:32:33] receiving this temptation I know what we
[1:32:35] do we use the word devil the scripture
[1:32:38] says flee you the lusts ha
[1:32:41] got him
[1:32:45] how'd that work
[1:32:48] the Temptation gone did he flee did he
[1:32:50] you used the word you you threw a
[1:32:52] scripture at him and say hi devil I got
[1:32:54] you because and it's almost like we
[1:32:56] begin to use like and is it but isn't
[1:32:58] and as we look at the story and we'll
[1:33:00] turn to Matthew chapter four but as we
[1:33:01] look at the story The Devil's throwing
[1:33:02] scripture back at Jesus
[1:33:06] that's good it's like all right devil my
[1:33:09] Matthew 6 33 trumps your you know
[1:33:13] trumps your numbers 4-1
[1:33:16] what you've got now
[1:33:17] oh man he's coming at me with a John
[1:33:20] three but he doesn't know I'm coming at
[1:33:22] him with a second Peter
[1:33:29] it's funny because it's true
[1:33:31] like that in our in our in our minds
[1:33:34] like we heard like well you you you you
[1:33:36] you overcome by the word like oh how
[1:33:39] else are you supposed to do it brother
[1:33:41] Trevor like I know the scriptures have
[1:33:43] been taught him in Sunday school I've
[1:33:45] memorized stuff and didn't I memorize
[1:33:47] them just to make me feel good and to
[1:33:49] battle the devil with
[1:33:52] or or was it that we're not actually
[1:33:57] we're not actually hoping that you just
[1:33:58] memorized the word but that the part of
[1:34:00] memorizing you see brother random tells
[1:34:02] us the mind is is the mind is is what
[1:34:05] the board comes into and then the spirit
[1:34:06] catches that word and brings it down
[1:34:08] into the soul right and so we're trying
[1:34:10] to equip your mind so that the spirit so
[1:34:12] that so that the embodiment of the word
[1:34:14] as a continual process is happening so
[1:34:17] as you begin to meditate on the word as
[1:34:19] you begin to because we've met Nobody
[1:34:21] Does that anymore I know but you know
[1:34:23] because you know there's infinite scroll
[1:34:25] you know even on your Bible app you just
[1:34:27] scroll infinitely and we don't need to
[1:34:29] meditate we can read more man you can
[1:34:30] get it done in a year
[1:34:32] we probably don't do that much either
[1:34:34] but
[1:34:36] my goodness we got a
[1:34:43] do this we take the word in we listen to
[1:34:46] the tapes we read the scripture we pray
[1:34:49] and say God I want these things that
[1:34:51] you're saying the truths that are coming
[1:34:53] through this word should then become
[1:34:55] reality to me and then fuse themselves
[1:34:58] into me in such a way that these that
[1:35:02] the devil see see when the devil's
[1:35:04] tempting Jesus Christ do you like how do
[1:35:06] you think that went for Jesus is this
[1:35:08] like you know it's like you're hung it's
[1:35:10] been 40 days
[1:35:12] you're hungry how's that going to go for
[1:35:13] you
[1:35:15] you go for a 40-day fast and the Devil
[1:35:17] comes to you and says turn this rock
[1:35:18] into bread
[1:35:20] what are you doing
[1:35:24] you're right I can turn rocks in the
[1:35:26] bread I'm so hungry
[1:35:31] I'm like that's the temp that's
[1:35:33] Temptation man like I'm hungry
[1:35:36] but Jesus like just turns around it's
[1:35:39] like do we really think that Jesus was
[1:35:40] like oh
[1:35:42] man
[1:35:44] hmm
[1:35:48] yeah that rock right there is starting
[1:35:49] to look good
[1:35:52] and the devil's like yeah
[1:35:56] that's bread Jesus oh
[1:36:02] no I just I I just can't I just um you
[1:36:06] know because this is this is us right
[1:36:08] like okay like that's Temptation I gotta
[1:36:11] figure this out man I guess kind of
[1:36:13] trying to run away from it but it's it's
[1:36:16] calling me
[1:36:18] do we think that that's what was going
[1:36:19] on with Jesus as he's tempted by the
[1:36:21] devil in the wilderness I mean was he
[1:36:22] sitting there going oh yeah you're right
[1:36:25] I got to think about this now
[1:36:28] no he he was being tempted but he he was
[1:36:30] immune
[1:36:32] why was he immune
[1:36:35] [Applause]
[1:36:37] because he was the embodiment of the
[1:36:39] word
[1:36:40] how was he using the word by the word
[1:36:42] being embodied in him
[1:36:44] so he could quote the word to him he
[1:36:46] also quoted word with the proper
[1:36:48] understanding of what that word meant
[1:36:50] but because he could he knew the word he
[1:36:53] understood what it meant he also then
[1:36:55] that meaning became fused inside of him
[1:36:58] to where he it was obvious to him it's
[1:37:02] like that's not the right thing it's not
[1:37:04] even a temptate you're tempting me but
[1:37:07] it's really not working because I have
[1:37:09] no desire for the thing that you're
[1:37:11] asking me to do you think it should be
[1:37:14] obvious that a man after 40 days would
[1:37:17] want to turn a rock into bread but to me
[1:37:19] that obvious thing is not obvious
[1:37:22] anymore because I've embodied the word
[1:37:24] and the understanding and the character
[1:37:26] and the meaning of it are so infused
[1:37:28] that it's really not a Temptation though
[1:37:31] you might think it is
[1:37:33] okay so so
[1:37:35] amen so Jesus then as he's
[1:37:39] overcoming brother Branham says he
[1:37:41] constantly applied the word and he said
[1:37:45] in each of these he said he overcame the
[1:37:48] personal Temptations of Satan by the
[1:37:51] word by the word only in each of these
[1:37:54] three major trials that have
[1:37:56] corresponded exactly to the Temptation
[1:37:57] Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the
[1:38:00] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:38:02] life that's out of First John 2 16. he
[1:38:04] says Jesus overcame by the word
[1:38:08] Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of
[1:38:11] Satan by failing to use the word Adam
[1:38:13] fell
[1:38:15] in direct Disobedience to the word
[1:38:18] but Jesus overcame by the word and right
[1:38:21] now let me say that this is the only way
[1:38:24] to be an overcomer also it is the only
[1:38:27] way that you can know if you are
[1:38:28] overcoming because the word can't fail
[1:38:31] amen he says then there was not a time
[1:38:33] when the world was not utterly confused
[1:38:35] by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of
[1:38:38] God
[1:38:39] so so now let's turn to Matthew chapter
[1:38:42] four if you will with me
[1:38:45] and we can start at verse three and I
[1:38:47] just want to analyze this story because
[1:38:49] I want I want to really break this down
[1:38:51] and try to make this very practical
[1:39:02] when the tempter came to him he said if
[1:39:05] thou be the Son of God command that
[1:39:07] these Stones be made bread
[1:39:10] but he answered and said it is written
[1:39:12] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:39:15] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:39:18] mouth of God
[1:39:20] Okay so
[1:39:22] the Devil comes and tempts him and Jesus
[1:39:24] gives him the word now I want to ask you
[1:39:25] just for a moment like when the Devil
[1:39:27] comes and tempts you what is what word
[1:39:29] is like where in the Bible would be
[1:39:31] maybe your go-to places to combat The
[1:39:35] Temptations of the devil in your life
[1:39:40] anybody what's that
[1:39:42] okay do you know where that's found
[1:39:45] somewhere in the New Testament I don't
[1:39:47] know either Paul's writings
[1:39:49] James James's writings
[1:39:55] where else do you go
[1:39:58] anybody just
[1:40:01] okay where's that
[1:40:05] Paul somewhere yes good job Timothy
[1:40:08] that's where that is encyclopedia says
[1:40:13] my pastor's the same way like they're
[1:40:16] like where's that pound Trevor it's like
[1:40:17] well it's on you know it's in Matthew
[1:40:19] somewhere it's on the right side of the
[1:40:21] page three quarters of the way down to
[1:40:22] the column underlined in blue you know
[1:40:24] and it's
[1:40:25] brother Nathan's like
[1:40:27] that's this scripture oh yeah
[1:40:30] I can find it I can't tell you where it
[1:40:32] is I know where it is but I can't tell
[1:40:34] you where it is because you don't have
[1:40:35] my Bible
[1:40:37] anyway what else Psalms probably is a
[1:40:39] good one there's a lot of stuff you know
[1:40:41] it's like break the arm of the evil man
[1:40:43] that's in Psalms maybe don't use that
[1:40:46] one I don't know
[1:40:47] um
[1:40:48] we use so we use different scriptures a
[1:40:50] lot of us would are going to use we're
[1:40:52] going to use Psalms we're going to use
[1:40:53] the New Testament in places when Jesus
[1:40:55] is battling the devil but Jesus is
[1:40:58] battling the devil here in Matthew 4. he
[1:41:00] uses Deuteronomy
[1:41:03] do you ever think about Deuteronomy as
[1:41:05] the this yes that's that's your go-to
[1:41:07] place for battling the devil is the book
[1:41:09] of Deuteronomy
[1:41:11] um
[1:41:12] actually kind of boring isn't it like
[1:41:14] you're reading through it it's like oh
[1:41:15] my goodness
[1:41:17] rehashing everything we just read in the
[1:41:19] last four books
[1:41:21] I hope I'm not too human for you
[1:41:28] maybe I'm the only one that thinks those
[1:41:30] irreverent thoughts
[1:41:34] so Jesus uses Deuteronomy chapter 8 and
[1:41:36] verse 3.
[1:41:39] what does Deuteronomy chapter 8 and
[1:41:40] verse 3 says I'll quote it to you so you
[1:41:41] don't have to turn he humbled thee
[1:41:43] suffered Thee the hunger fed thee with
[1:41:45] Manna which thou knew is not neither did
[1:41:47] thy fathers know that he might make thee
[1:41:48] no that man doth not live by bread only
[1:41:51] but every word that proceedeth out of
[1:41:52] the mouth of the Lord doth Man live this
[1:41:55] is the scripture that Jesus is going to
[1:41:56] as he's battling the devil is the devil
[1:41:58] saying hey why don't you turn this rock
[1:42:00] into in into bread
[1:42:03] so what is it's like well why okay those
[1:42:05] are the words but what's the meaning
[1:42:06] underneath those words well well we're
[1:42:08] we're talking about what was going on
[1:42:10] with the children of Israel that there
[1:42:12] there they were in the wilderness and
[1:42:14] they're hungry and and and and and
[1:42:18] God can't you
[1:42:20] God we're so hungry you brought us out
[1:42:21] of Egypt can't you feed us
[1:42:23] we have a problem you you know can you
[1:42:26] feed us and and so what did God do
[1:42:29] well he fed them
[1:42:32] let me ask you a question
[1:42:36] can can God solve world hunger
[1:42:42] fed five thousand people
[1:42:46] with
[1:42:47] Five Loaves and two fishes yeah five
[1:42:49] lows and two pictures
[1:42:51] except for on the next time it was like
[1:42:52] seven and three I think something like
[1:42:53] that anyway
[1:42:55] um
[1:42:56] encyclopedias
[1:42:57] anyway we'll move on so God can solve
[1:43:01] world hungers just like that
[1:43:03] right he can feed the children of Israel
[1:43:05] for 40 years with Manna in the
[1:43:07] wilderness he can he can feed them with
[1:43:08] quails so much that you know
[1:43:10] well he's going to kill them while
[1:43:12] they're eating it and they'll you know
[1:43:13] just wow like be careful when you ask
[1:43:16] God to feed you that's all I'm saying he
[1:43:19] may actually do it
[1:43:23] that's maybe you go through and
[1:43:25] Deuteronomy and read that story if
[1:43:27] you're confused but
[1:43:29] so
[1:43:30] but if God solves world hunger what has
[1:43:32] he done
[1:43:34] well brother Trevor he's fed a lot of
[1:43:36] people he's staved off a lot of
[1:43:39] suffering that's in the world he's it's
[1:43:41] uh it's just a nicer place to live now
[1:43:43] because everybody has food and that's
[1:43:44] that's nice Okay God has solve world
[1:43:46] hunger and nobody's hungry
[1:43:49] has anyone changed
[1:43:52] is anyone better
[1:43:54] has the character of the people changed
[1:43:56] well but brother Trevor you're all
[1:43:57] you're you're enabling the people better
[1:43:59] you know to uh rise up above their
[1:44:02] poverty and be and and and if they
[1:44:04] weren't faithful in the little things
[1:44:05] that God gave them how are they going to
[1:44:07] be faithful and much
[1:44:11] so yes God can solve world hunger but
[1:44:12] but Jesus himself knows that the knows
[1:44:15] the idea is is that it's not about
[1:44:17] whether I'm hungry or not and whether or
[1:44:19] not God can make bread or not because he
[1:44:21] can that is established that is fact and
[1:44:23] we don't we don't need to we don't need
[1:44:25] to even go into that we don't need to
[1:44:27] have this conversation devil about
[1:44:28] whether or not that rock can be turned
[1:44:30] to bread and whether or not I can be the
[1:44:31] idea is is that if I need the bread God
[1:44:34] is always faithful
[1:44:37] that God is there and following him and
[1:44:39] knowing his word and becoming his word
[1:44:41] is vastly and more important for for
[1:44:44] myself and for this entire world
[1:44:48] than that rock becoming bread
[1:44:51] and so devil you're bothering me with a
[1:44:53] trifle
[1:44:55] because I'm concerned about the word I'm
[1:44:57] concerned about the word being expressed
[1:44:59] through my life and so if you're just
[1:45:01] asking me well aren't you hungry and no
[1:45:03] you know sure it's hey man it's easy for
[1:45:05] someone who's over 250 pounds to preach
[1:45:08] about that
[1:45:11] I get that but that doesn't that doesn't
[1:45:14] negate the truth
[1:45:15] that's right and that's what so so so
[1:45:16] Jesus is embodying the is embodying
[1:45:19] Deuteronomy so fully
[1:45:23] that this temptation the devil is
[1:45:25] bringing him is meaningless to him
[1:45:27] he says devil like
[1:45:30] are you that stupid like Devil like God
[1:45:32] can turn like God can handle hunger it's
[1:45:34] not a problem the more important thing
[1:45:36] is is that I'm here
[1:45:39] to get myself out of the way
[1:45:41] this flesh out of the way that it can
[1:45:43] display the glory of God for three and a
[1:45:45] half years
[1:45:47] we continue on
[1:45:50] Matthew Chapter 4 verses 6 and 7 then
[1:45:53] and this uh or five the devil taketh him
[1:45:56] up into the holy city and set Upon A
[1:45:57] Pinnacle of the temple and saith unto
[1:45:58] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:45:59] thyself down for it is written he shall
[1:46:01] give his angels charge concerning me and
[1:46:03] in their hands they shall bear thee
[1:46:04] uplust at any time Thou shalt Dash thy
[1:46:06] foot against the stone and Jesus said
[1:46:08] unto him it is written again Thou shalt
[1:46:09] not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:46:11] okay so what does he say
[1:46:14] well where's he getting this out of Thou
[1:46:16] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God well
[1:46:17] that's Deuteronomy 6 16 ye shall not
[1:46:20] tempt the Lord your God as he tempted
[1:46:22] him in Masa
[1:46:23] all right so Jesus just extracts this
[1:46:25] random scripture Through the Bible and
[1:46:27] throws it at the Devil no it's more than
[1:46:28] that what he's saying is the devil you
[1:46:30] have no power here
[1:46:33] because I understand what happened in
[1:46:34] the in the in the wilderness see what
[1:46:36] happened was is that God had fed them
[1:46:37] God had given them water and then they
[1:46:40] get to the next place and they have no
[1:46:41] water and they're like is God even with
[1:46:43] us I mean we can't even tell because
[1:46:45] we're so thirsty and that had to be very
[1:46:48] terrible like I don't want to put myself
[1:46:49] really in their shoes and have to
[1:46:51] experience that and I you know and I'm
[1:46:53] like Jesus make sure Lord change me
[1:46:55] because I hope if I was in that scenario
[1:46:57] I'd be just like
[1:46:58] not complaining because I was really
[1:47:00] really thirsty
[1:47:04] [Laughter]
[1:47:09] thirsty just thinking about it okay
[1:47:14] so here so here the point is is that
[1:47:17] Jesus is saying they they the
[1:47:19] understanding of Deuteronomy 6 is they
[1:47:21] tempted him in the wilderness they they
[1:47:23] didn't believe him they see they had
[1:47:25] seen that he had done things for them
[1:47:27] they knew that God was a deliverer they
[1:47:30] knew that God could bring water they
[1:47:32] knew that God could bring food but yet
[1:47:34] when they came to an hour of need they
[1:47:36] said okay we got to prove if God's even
[1:47:38] real here because we're not sure
[1:47:42] I was like you're tempting God God
[1:47:44] oh God can you really do this because
[1:47:46] we're thirsty and if you could really do
[1:47:48] this maybe we wouldn't be
[1:47:51] and that's what the devil is saying it's
[1:47:53] like well
[1:47:55] go ahead throw yourself off this
[1:47:57] mountain and see if just see
[1:48:00] no
[1:48:01] not tempting the Lord
[1:48:03] I know he's real
[1:48:05] so I don't have to I don't have to play
[1:48:06] your games devil
[1:48:08] and sometimes that's what the devil
[1:48:09] wants to do he wants to throw these
[1:48:11] thoughts in your mind and say look is
[1:48:12] this really like if God was real like
[1:48:14] don't you think
[1:48:15] it's like as if as if 6 000 years of
[1:48:18] History isn't enough already that we
[1:48:20] haven't proved him yet like like it's
[1:48:22] going to come that's right here right
[1:48:24] now we're going to prove of God's
[1:48:25] actually real or not come on don't tempt
[1:48:27] the Lord your God and Jesus is like I'm
[1:48:29] not playing your game man
[1:48:31] why because he was embodying the word he
[1:48:34] understood the word it wasn't a it
[1:48:36] wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just a
[1:48:38] trivial mind word game that was going on
[1:48:41] but it was it was desires but the devil
[1:48:44] is trying to attack and Jesus is
[1:48:47] embodying the correct characters and the
[1:48:49] correct desires so this attack isn't
[1:48:51] even doing anything amen so okay so
[1:48:54] Deuteronomy 6 13 to 14 let's try to
[1:48:56] hurry through this
[1:49:00] is that right well we'll keep just
[1:49:01] reading a little bit more so that I
[1:49:03] don't skip anything the devil taketh him
[1:49:04] up into a high mountain and show with
[1:49:06] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:49:08] the glory of them verse 9 and he saith
[1:49:09] unto them all these things will I give
[1:49:11] thee if thou will fall down and worship
[1:49:12] me then Jesus saith unto him get thee
[1:49:14] hence Satan
[1:49:16] for it is written Thou shalt not Worship
[1:49:17] the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[1:49:20] serve
[1:49:21] and the devil leaving leaveth him and
[1:49:23] behold Angels Came and ministered unto
[1:49:25] him
[1:49:28] oh 13 and 14 is what what he used in
[1:49:31] Deuteronomy chapter six so do so what he
[1:49:34] uses there to tell the devil is
[1:49:35] Deuteronomy 6 13 and 14 Thou shalt fear
[1:49:38] the lord thy God and serve him shalt
[1:49:40] swear by his name ye shall not go after
[1:49:41] other gods the gods of the people which
[1:49:43] are round about you for the Lord thy God
[1:49:45] is a jealous God among you lest the
[1:49:47] anger of the Lord be kindled again and
[1:49:48] Destroy thee from off the face of the
[1:49:51] Earth
[1:49:52] you see what the devil is offering Jesus
[1:49:54] is he's offering it like he's offering
[1:49:57] Jesus everything that Jesus was going to
[1:49:59] get anyway
[1:50:00] and you think well that would be like
[1:50:01] why would you do that like Jesus already
[1:50:03] knows he's going to get all of these
[1:50:04] things and the devil's like hey I can
[1:50:06] give you all of these things and you'd
[1:50:07] think Jesus would just say I'm going to
[1:50:09] get that anyway so why do I why would I
[1:50:11] make a deal with you
[1:50:13] but the reality is the devil was
[1:50:15] offering it to him before I don't know
[1:50:16] Calvary
[1:50:18] before whips before beard being plucked
[1:50:21] out before being smitten with reeds
[1:50:24] before being bruised and broken and
[1:50:26] smitten before my God my God why is Thou
[1:50:28] forsaken me all of those things the
[1:50:31] devil is offering him all of this
[1:50:32] without the growth of character all
[1:50:39] ah Jesus said Thou shalt Worship the
[1:50:41] Lord thy God and him only
[1:50:44] Jesus is saying I'm not worshiping My
[1:50:47] Flesh
[1:50:48] to make the glory that I know I
[1:50:52] truly deserve
[1:50:56] come about
[1:50:57] if it's just about my flesh
[1:51:01] and church if we can really Empower my
[1:51:03] if we can embody this concept right here
[1:51:05] to understand that that it's it's I am
[1:51:09] created to worship him and him alone
[1:51:14] devil I'm not going to worship myself
[1:51:19] because I can give myself Glory I can
[1:51:21] become a tick tock Superstar and have
[1:51:24] millions of followers and millions of of
[1:51:26] you know dollars and sponsorships and
[1:51:29] all of these things and you know and and
[1:51:31] and and I I guess there's a a gymnast
[1:51:33] now that's also a Tick-Tock person and
[1:51:35] she's got like six or seven million
[1:51:37] followers and she's had to tell people
[1:51:39] like hey stop you know like crowding
[1:51:42] everything and making it all about me
[1:51:43] I'm at a gymnast competition there's
[1:51:45] other people here too and and it's like
[1:51:47] wow but wouldn't you want to be that
[1:51:49] person that like you're filling stadiums
[1:51:52] just because you're there and walking in
[1:51:54] and people just want to take a selfie
[1:51:56] with you
[1:52:00] because you deserve that Glory
[1:52:03] isn't that right Zach

[1:52:27] else
[1:52:29] nobody else wearing a bow tie this
[1:52:30] morning just Zach
[1:52:33] and we could you know
[1:52:35] it's got a nice smile
[1:52:37] I bet
[1:52:39] just I'm just guessing if you just
[1:52:42] regularly had these posts on Tick Tock
[1:52:45] where you're smiling and you're saying
[1:52:47] something kind of funny
[1:52:48] that in three or four years you've got a
[1:52:50] million followers bro
[1:52:52] there's a business idea you might
[1:52:53] consider it
[1:52:57] I have to confess I literally told the
[1:52:59] brother that I thought that maybe he
[1:53:01] could do that you know
[1:53:03] just yesterday anyway
[1:53:07] like
[1:53:08] because why well Zach I mean aren't you
[1:53:11] a great guy
[1:53:13] yeah right just be honest it's Church
[1:53:16] bro like it's okay
[1:53:22] don't you feel that one day
[1:53:24] you're gonna reign as a king
[1:53:28] but you are because the word says it
[1:53:33] because after all you're son of a king
[1:53:36] man
[1:53:39] you're told you are totally worthy of
[1:53:43] reigning one day
[1:53:49] am I just talking to Zach am I just
[1:53:51] talking to Zach
[1:53:54] totally worthy one day to reign as a
[1:53:57] king and a priest
[1:54:01] look in the mirror God and a human being
[1:54:05] King
[1:54:06] Queen
[1:54:08] bam
[1:54:14] but what the devil is trying to offer
[1:54:15] and especially try to offer to you young
[1:54:17] people is that you deserve that now
[1:54:20] you're worthy now why don't you get that
[1:54:21] now
[1:54:27] and if you recognize the devil
[1:54:30] I am not yet
[1:54:32] the full embodiment of the word
[1:54:36] and what you're trying to promise me is
[1:54:38] glory and all of these things but but
[1:54:41] without
[1:54:42] the fulfilling part
[1:54:45] trying to offer me these things you're
[1:54:46] trying to offer me to Trophies that's
[1:54:48] going to sit on my wall you're trying to
[1:54:50] offer me likes and shares and follows
[1:54:54] and
[1:54:57] when you walk in the young ladies are
[1:54:59] like laughs
[1:55:10] because after all wouldn't that I mean
[1:55:12] let's be honest wouldn't that be pretty
[1:55:14] cool
[1:55:16] never it never happened for me you know
[1:55:19] like
[1:55:21] stop embarrassing you thank you
[1:55:28] but isn't that what the devil's offering
[1:55:32] you can have it now
[1:55:35] this thing that you you're worthy of it
[1:55:37] and it's like well actually yeah that's
[1:55:38] true
[1:55:40] by his grace
[1:55:42] but God wants to bring me through
[1:55:44] something
[1:55:45] to mold the characters in me
[1:55:49] because character
[1:55:51] without a victory
[1:55:54] when it was I totally just
[1:55:57] is satanic did I say it right
[1:56:00] power without character satanic
[1:56:02] characters of Victory not a gift I was
[1:56:04] murdered those two thank you you're all
[1:56:06] with me though you've read the church
[1:56:07] age book everybody knows what I was
[1:56:09] saying that's well taught church thank
[1:56:11] you Pastor okay
[1:56:13] but this is the idea is that God wants
[1:56:16] to like this is this is the heart of
[1:56:18] what we're talking about is that God
[1:56:20] wants you to embody that word God wants
[1:56:23] you to become his very character and not
[1:56:26] only is that a journey like not yes is
[1:56:29] that a hard thing is that a hard journey
[1:56:31] is that are there difficult things that
[1:56:33] you're going to have to go through
[1:56:34] before you come to the glory which shall
[1:56:37] be revealed in us as the scripture says
[1:56:40] if you were worried about whether you
[1:56:42] were worthy of the glory or not because
[1:56:43] one day there will be glory revealed in
[1:56:46] you what Glory will that be that will be
[1:56:48] his glory revealed through the
[1:56:50] embodiment of the word in your life in
[1:56:54] your flesh
[1:56:58] so will that be it can will that will
[1:57:00] there be some difficult times in that
[1:57:02] Journey yes necessarily there must be
[1:57:04] difficult times to get rid of the things
[1:57:07] within you that are going to keep you
[1:57:10] from truly being the king and queen and
[1:57:14] priest and Glory revealer that you ought
[1:57:17] to be and will be but these other things
[1:57:21] inside of you that he's trying to get
[1:57:23] out of you that his him that his
[1:57:25] characters can truly live through you
[1:57:28] and inside of you are the things you
[1:57:30] don't really want but those are the
[1:57:33] things the devil is trying to Quicken
[1:57:35] and say look but you should have it now
[1:57:37] so just worship me just worship yourself
[1:57:40] worship your phone worship your sports
[1:57:43] worship your car worship your children
[1:57:47] worship your wife worship your husband
[1:57:49] worship whatever it is but Jesus says no
[1:57:53] devil
[1:57:59] Thou shalt worship Him
[1:58:02] and him alone
[1:58:04] so I'm not worshiping myself I'm not
[1:58:06] bringing to pass what will be manifested
[1:58:09] in me without the process that God
[1:58:12] because to do so would be cheap and and
[1:58:16] lessen that thing on that final day and
[1:58:19] I don't want that I don't want to come
[1:58:21] to that final day with with half the
[1:58:24] character I ought to have
[1:58:26] praise God I'm gonna have half the peace
[1:58:29] that I ought to have through the
[1:58:30] millennium
[1:58:31] I'm going to have half the joy that I
[1:58:32] ought to have through the Millennium I'm
[1:58:33] gonna have you know half the ability to
[1:58:35] make good decisions in the Millennium
[1:58:38] like no I don't I like no said no one
[1:58:40] ever
[1:58:41] [Applause]
[1:58:46] but that's the reality of what we choose
[1:58:48] when we choose to just go after our own
[1:58:51] fleshly things and ignore ignore the
[1:58:54] process of character growth to achieve
[1:58:57] those same things that we truly want for
[1:58:59] ourselves
[1:59:02] but Jesus says I am come that you might
[1:59:06] have life
[1:59:08] and that you might have it more
[1:59:10] abundantly
[1:59:14] so the greatest thing that you could
[1:59:16] ever be if you didn't have it with with
[1:59:18] if you had it without Jesus you you do
[1:59:21] you are you living yeah I have life I
[1:59:23] mean I I guess I do
[1:59:26] but you're missing that essential
[1:59:29] element
[1:59:31] that brings out that Abundant Life
[1:59:34] that makes it amazing that makes it
[1:59:36] wonderful God did not come Jesus did not
[1:59:39] come to make you miserable now so that
[1:59:42] you could be and have an amazing life in
[1:59:45] the Millennium it's not like we're
[1:59:46] choosing like well if I have misery now
[1:59:48] I can I can reign as a king of priest
[1:59:50] later
[1:59:53] the message didn't come
[1:59:56] to make you miserable now
[1:59:58] to put you under bondage now
[2:00:00] so that you could prove how good of a
[2:00:03] Believer you were bless God and we're
[2:00:06] good at it I know the quotes and I got
[2:00:08] the doctrines down and I man
[2:00:12] there's no TV in my house no
[2:00:14] Christmas tree in my house no Christmas
[2:00:16] presents like that preacher obviously up
[2:00:18] there has like none of that happens in
[2:00:20] my house
[2:00:22] Pixar movies and all this garbage like
[2:00:24] we ain't doing none of that God we got
[2:00:27] the message
[2:00:29] maybe you know that person
[2:00:35] maybe you are that person
[2:00:38] is that the point
[2:00:40] is that truly Abundant Life coming out
[2:00:47] because we know
[2:00:48] we struggle with that we have these
[2:00:50] things and we we recognize those things
[2:00:52] we see those patterns and it is it is
[2:00:54] Noble out of our own desire to to try to
[2:00:57] achieve and to to make ourselves what we
[2:01:00] know we ought to be but at the end of
[2:01:02] the day what it's about is embodying the
[2:01:05] word it's not about bolting these things
[2:01:07] onto us and using these things as
[2:01:10] message armor and different things and
[2:01:12] bless God I'm you know I you know gonna
[2:01:14] fight and the devil and the Got The
[2:01:17] Sword and the shield of faith and quote
[2:01:19] the thing for us now like somewhere
[2:01:22] maybe I'm just teasing but
[2:01:25] the full armor of God and we we think
[2:01:27] the message is my full armor of God and
[2:01:28] I'm going to put it on my outside and
[2:01:30] I'm going to fight off the devil for
[2:01:32] every day of my life and it'll be a
[2:01:34] struggle but it'll be worth it in the
[2:01:36] Millennium when I have when I achieved
[2:01:38] him
[2:01:39] yeah wow man wow grace of God is just
[2:01:43] all through that
[2:01:48] God God wants to give you he came to
[2:01:50] give you life and that life more
[2:01:53] abundantly and he came to do that now
[2:01:55] not later
[2:01:58] but now as you take that word into your
[2:02:01] heart and that word and it becomes to be
[2:02:03] the embodiment of that that word is
[2:02:05] everything that's wonderful that word is
[2:02:07] everything that's amazing everything
[2:02:09] that's awesome everything that's
[2:02:11] righteous and holy and good and peace
[2:02:16] is becoming embodied
[2:02:18] in your flesh and do you think that's a
[2:02:22] miserable life somehow
[2:02:25] no
[2:02:27] it only is if we choose not to embody
[2:02:30] the word not to let the word become
[2:02:32] manifested in our lives not just to say
[2:02:34] God I want this I want this thing that
[2:02:37] brother Trevor is talking about I want
[2:02:38] this to live in me and brother Branham
[2:02:40] talks about stature of a perfect man
[2:02:41] would be a great message for you to
[2:02:43] listen to if you wanted to just like
[2:02:44] this topic is amazing I want to look
[2:02:46] into it more the statue of a perfect man
[2:02:48] he begins to talk about the
[2:02:49] vulcanization of of in a rubber plant
[2:02:51] where where where the Rubber and the two
[2:02:53] become one and that's what God is
[2:02:56] wanting to do with the word is that you
[2:02:57] and the word are becoming vulcanized
[2:02:59] together that you're becoming one that
[2:03:01] there's no separation that that you're
[2:03:04] becoming Jesus
[2:03:08] amen
[2:03:10] that you're becoming a Christian like
[2:03:12] Christ
[2:03:14] the first morning among many Brethren
[2:03:15] I'm one of them maybe I'm not the second
[2:03:17] maybe I'm not the fifth maybe I'm not
[2:03:19] the 250 second but I am one of them
[2:03:24] and so then as the devil is tempting in
[2:03:26] me in my life and as I'm a young
[2:03:28] Christian I I fall and I fail but as I
[2:03:30] grow and as I mature as the word becomes
[2:03:32] embodied and becomes vulcanized in my
[2:03:35] life I begin to man I have way more
[2:03:37] success at the devil's coming at me with
[2:03:40] these things and that and they're just
[2:03:41] bouncing off because it's like that's
[2:03:43] not even interesting to me
[2:03:46] um
[2:03:49] and then I begin to recognize what God
[2:03:51] is doing in my life not only am I am I
[2:03:53] being more successful in in warding off
[2:03:55] the attacks of the devil but I'm also
[2:03:57] recognizing like it's not even a stretch
[2:04:00] for me to look in the mirror some days
[2:04:02] and go God in a human being
[2:04:06] because he did something through my life
[2:04:09] and that's what God is I I want to close
[2:04:11] but give me just a second here but
[2:04:13] that's what God is wanting to do is to
[2:04:15] do something in your life to to to to to
[2:04:17] to to make you what he would be if he
[2:04:21] were you
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:25] it was good
[2:04:26] young man God created you
[2:04:29] what's your name
[2:04:30] Aaron yes okay I thought maybe it was
[2:04:33] Eric or Aaron I said okay Aaron
[2:04:37] God created you
[2:04:39] like you
[2:04:43] God didn't create you like Paul
[2:04:45] didn't create you like men
[2:04:48] God created you like Aaron yes sir
[2:04:52] do you think he made any mistakes
[2:04:55] I don't think so
[2:04:57] I don't either
[2:05:01] so God created Aaron exactly the way he
[2:05:04] intended Aaron to be
[2:05:06] God isn't asking Aaron to stop being
[2:05:09] Aaron
[2:05:13] you are and become
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:18] sometimes it's like oh I've just got to
[2:05:19] be a clean slate no God created the
[2:05:22] Slate that he wanted you to be
[2:05:24] anyway
[2:05:27] but he wanted what he created Aaron to
[2:05:30] be oh Jesus I can't even say it right
[2:05:33] like like he wanted Aaron to be Aaron
[2:05:36] the way Jesus Christ would be Aaron
[2:05:40] [Applause]
[2:05:47] so Aaron like
[2:05:48] the things that you're good at the
[2:05:50] talents that God has given you I don't
[2:05:52] know what they are
[2:05:54] what do you have anything comes off the
[2:05:56] top of your head
[2:05:59] he's athletic
[2:06:02] and God's going to use that someday I
[2:06:04] don't know maybe he's going to run
[2:06:05] messages places or something
[2:06:10] look I just you know I don't know what
[2:06:12] God is going to do with the qualities
[2:06:15] that he created in Aaron right now but
[2:06:19] God isn't going to change those
[2:06:20] qualities and and I'm assuming you're
[2:06:22] his parents
[2:06:24] grandparents okay
[2:06:28] maybe you well you were sitting right
[2:06:31] next to you I'm not complicating
[2:06:33] okay but you're welcome
[2:06:36] but maybe you would look at your
[2:06:37] grandson and say God
[2:06:40] oh he is
[2:06:42] he's so stubborn
[2:06:45] like maybe if you were gonna clean some
[2:06:47] slate you could clean that stubbornness
[2:06:49] out of him
[2:06:51] and God is like no
[2:06:53] I'm gonna use that stubbornness
[2:06:57] I'm gonna make him stubborn for Jesus
[2:06:59] all right
[2:07:05] so so so Aaron's gonna run to somebody
[2:07:09] because he's athletic and he's going to
[2:07:10] start telling them about Jesus and
[2:07:12] they're gonna be like
[2:07:13] and and Aaron's like hack
[2:07:17] You Haven't Seen the Last of Aaron
[2:07:19] [Applause]
[2:07:22] amen because as God God put qualities
[2:07:25] there God put things that he has that
[2:07:28] you yourself Aaron you're gonna have to
[2:07:30] surrender some of those things to the
[2:07:34] will and and character of God and that
[2:07:36] won't be an e process it may not even be
[2:07:39] a fun process but it will be a
[2:07:41] worthwhile process and you'll find that
[2:07:43] the way God created you that you're
[2:07:45] uniquely called uniquely qualified
[2:07:47] uniquely gifted to do exactly what God
[2:07:50] wants to do through your life in your
[2:07:53] area to the people that you see and that
[2:07:55] you know and that follow you on tick
[2:07:57] tock
[2:07:59] it's maybe a stretch I don't know I hope
[2:08:01] you don't have Tick Tock actually but
[2:08:05] because that's the embodiment of the
[2:08:07] word not only does it become your
[2:08:10] protection not that I have to quote the
[2:08:12] word and battle with the Devil by you
[2:08:14] know like I said you know my Corinthians
[2:08:17] 3 is better than your Joshua too like no
[2:08:20] that's not the battle that we're facing
[2:08:22] but what we're looking for is God let
[2:08:24] your characters that the character that
[2:08:27] this letter that we say is dead but once
[2:08:30] it the character and meaning of this as
[2:08:32] this is the heart of God expressed comes
[2:08:35] into my life and the spirit vulcanizes
[2:08:37] that and makes me that thing because I'm
[2:08:40] reading it I'm studying it I'm dwelling
[2:08:42] in it I'm meditating on it and God as
[2:08:45] I'm doing this process is melting away
[2:08:48] the other things and while the heat is
[2:08:50] there melting away the problems the word
[2:08:53] of God is fusing itself into the same
[2:08:56] tube
[2:08:57] that is Aaron's life
[2:08:59] that is your life and you're becoming
[2:09:03] the word of God
[2:09:07] [Applause]
[2:09:18] it's a New and Living Way
[2:09:20] it's a New and Living Way that Jesus
[2:09:23] came
[2:09:24] those
[2:09:26] through the Old Testament all those
[2:09:27] Believers all those Pharisees in Jesus's
[2:09:29] day they were trying to bolt the word of
[2:09:31] God onto them know the word of God and
[2:09:33] do the word of God in their own
[2:09:35] strengths and their own trying and that
[2:09:37] is not what the word of God came to do
[2:09:39] that that is not what Jesus came for
[2:09:41] that is not what this message came for
[2:09:43] but but but it has come to give us life
[2:09:46] and that life more abundantly amen
[2:09:49] and so so this is the embodiment that we
[2:09:52] are to be the the expressors of this
[2:09:55] word in in our own peculiarities and our
[2:09:59] own gifts and our own talents and our
[2:10:01] own things that we got to yield to God
[2:10:07] brother Brenham says in the message
[2:10:08] anointed ones at the end time musicians
[2:10:09] you can come the son of man is Christ he
[2:10:13] is the one you're feeding on
[2:10:15] you are what you eat
[2:10:20] he's the one you're feeding on you're
[2:10:22] not feeding on a man a man his words
[2:10:25] will fail but you're feeding on the
[2:10:27] unfailing body word
[2:10:30] the unfailing embodied word
[2:10:34] because he came and embodied the word so
[2:10:37] that you could see these Concepts that
[2:10:40] we had from the beginning of time that
[2:10:42] were in the mind of God that then he
[2:10:44] expressed in letter then Jesus Christ
[2:10:47] comes and embodies that so that we can
[2:10:50] understand what Joy is we can understand
[2:10:53] what Jesus Christ is you you see what
[2:10:56] I'm saying is that embodiment comes and
[2:10:59] now we understand it because it's
[2:11:01] expressed and not only do we have that
[2:11:03] but then we can see and have a mirror to
[2:11:05] look at our own lives and say am I
[2:11:07] mirroring that
[2:11:09] am I becoming that embodied because it's
[2:11:12] the as what the prophet said to us as we
[2:11:14] looked at earlier that it is now
[2:11:16] embodying itself in the bride
[2:11:23] I don't know why you wouldn't want that
[2:11:27] right why who wouldn't want to sell
[2:11:28] everything and say God that's me
[2:11:34] you're feeding on the unfailing
[2:11:36] body word
[2:11:38] of the son of man
[2:11:39] [Applause]
[2:11:41] that's what this message came
[2:11:43] to do to Quicken us to bring us Abundant
[2:11:47] Life to take us out of the old forms the
[2:11:51] denominations that brought us into and
[2:11:53] bring us to that New and Living Way that
[2:11:55] Jesus Christ brought to us
[2:11:57] and said you can live it
[2:11:59] you can express it and while you're
[2:12:02] doing that you will feel it
[2:12:06] greatest calling
[2:12:08] the highest calling the most noblest of
[2:12:11] things the group the most wonderful
[2:12:13] thing that we can do and not only is it
[2:12:15] just what ought to be done what should
[2:12:17] be done what God is worthy that is done
[2:12:19] but if you choose to say God I want that
[2:12:22] in my life I want to I want to throw off
[2:12:24] all of these things that that bind me
[2:12:26] and that take up my time and all of this
[2:12:28] stuff because I I want that as you do
[2:12:32] that you will find that it's the most
[2:12:34] wonderful thing you ever did
[2:12:36] that it's not a message of Oppression
[2:12:38] but it's a message of life that it's a
[2:12:41] message of of joy that it's a message of
[2:12:44] happiness and fun like like you know
[2:12:46] it's like brother Trevor you just said
[2:12:48] the message was fun yes
[2:12:52] I don't know if you you know think about
[2:12:54] that as like man this meant
[2:12:57] man this message is fun
[2:13:01] but it is yeah
[2:13:04] right it is
[2:13:07] because
[2:13:10] Zion and I were at a technology
[2:13:11] conference we
[2:13:13] end where we started with Zion and I at
[2:13:15] a technology conference and
[2:13:17] we left this service that we were so
[2:13:20] happy to get to on Thursday night
[2:13:23] and go back to the hotel where
[2:13:26] all of our co-workers are at
[2:13:29] and they're having the the party at this
[2:13:31] conference and I'm telling you what you
[2:13:33] know techie people can that's sad anyway
[2:13:40] these people are having fun
[2:13:46] and we walked by the karaoke room and
[2:13:48] let me tell you what that was a disaster
[2:13:54] they're not having fun
[2:13:56] and so Zion and I were Thursday night in
[2:14:00] a span of five hours contrasted by two
[2:14:02] forms of fun
[2:14:04] and I can tell you what
[2:14:05] it was way more fun having being had
[2:14:07] here
[2:14:10] than there was at a convention
[2:14:12] with music and drinking and
[2:14:15] all that
[2:14:19] this message is fun
[2:14:21] it's rewarding it's fulfilling
[2:14:24] every everything that's good and
[2:14:26] wonderful this message is because it's
[2:14:27] it's it's it's the voice of God to us
[2:14:30] it's God's character being expressed to
[2:14:32] us and as and as it becomes
[2:14:35] living in reality in our life
[2:14:37] to be the greatest thing
[2:14:40] the greatest thing
[2:14:43] let's seek to embody
[2:14:45] not just know this not just understand
[2:14:47] it but say God
[2:14:49] let this word live in me
[2:14:52] we say those things we say we sing the
[2:14:55] song
[2:14:58] I don't know we sing the song
[2:15:02] everybody awake I don't know
[2:15:05] we sing the song let the word live in me
[2:15:07] but let's not that let's not
[2:15:10] it's not just a saying
[2:15:12] and so what I hope that I brought to you
[2:15:14] this morning was to begin to
[2:15:16] let your mind conceptualize what does it
[2:15:19] mean to say I want the word living in me
[2:15:21] to be embodied
[2:15:24] shall we pray father
[2:15:28] we love you Lord
[2:15:30] we love your word I would encourages us
[2:15:32] and excites us and we want to
[2:15:35] God we just want to let it live
[2:15:37] we want to be everything that you
[2:15:39] called us to be
[2:15:42] father Aaron wants to be Aaron like you
[2:15:45] would be Aaron Trevor wants to be Trevor
[2:15:47] like you would be Trevor
[2:15:51] there's no greater honor there's no
[2:15:52] higher calling there's no more rewarding
[2:15:55] way
[2:15:58] Lord I just pray that this
[2:16:01] this broke up sermon would just
[2:16:05] resonate in their hearts little God and
[2:16:07] that you would witness the thought at
[2:16:09] least that
[2:16:10] I was trying to express to their hearts
[2:16:13] father
[2:16:14] May the word of God be that thing that
[2:16:16] we grow by
[2:16:18] so bless us now we ask in Jesus name
[2:16:21] amen
[2:16:23] we sing that song Let the word live
[2:16:27] in me
[2:16:31] dear Lord

[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:23:00] [Music]

[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:24:01] a change
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:21] oh yes it's Jesus on the inside
[2:24:28] making your differences
[2:24:34] [Music]
[2:24:51] [Applause]
[2:24:52] in
[2:24:53] my life
[2:24:56] [Music]
[2:24:58] oh Hallelujah
[2:25:01] praise the name of the Lord
[2:25:04] man we have been blessed
[2:25:07] amen thank you
[2:25:09] it's just I just so appreciate how the
[2:25:12] Holy Spirit comes
[2:25:13] God has a way of saying things yes he
[2:25:16] does
[2:25:17] it's it's precious
[2:25:20] you know
[2:25:22] we've said this many times there's been
[2:25:24] a lot of times there's things that we
[2:25:26] want to say and I don't know how to say
[2:25:28] it but I know how I feel I know it's in
[2:25:30] my heart but I don't seem like I can get
[2:25:32] the words to put together
[2:25:34] but you know God God has a way of more
[2:25:38] and more as he reveals himself it just
[2:25:40] comes so much more plain
[2:25:42] the message of the hour doesn't become
[2:25:45] more obscure
[2:25:47] because the message is Christ
[2:25:50] that that's that's where the that's why
[2:25:52] we you don't separate the Bible from the
[2:25:55] message
[2:25:56] that's that's not what you can't
[2:25:57] separate that the message is the light
[2:26:00] that comes upon the word to make that
[2:26:03] word live
[2:26:06] and so when we're looking at it
[2:26:09] and we're approaching these things
[2:26:12] what we're seeing
[2:26:13] is we're seeing that word
[2:26:16] come to pass in our own life and he's
[2:26:19] changing us
[2:26:20] now I'm not going to ask you to raise
[2:26:22] your hand because every one of us
[2:26:25] would love change
[2:26:27] to come like that
[2:26:30] and that is a necessity of the holy
[2:26:34] spirit because the new birth brings a
[2:26:38] change inwardly passing from Death unto
[2:26:41] life
[2:26:42] but then through that death
[2:26:44] it leads us to be able to die to our
[2:26:48] will
[2:26:49] die to ourselves daily
[2:26:54] and that's
[2:26:55] as the Lord spoke to brother Trevor the
[2:26:58] things that was said so
[2:27:00] vividly
[2:27:02] God don't want you being like nobody
[2:27:04] else
[2:27:05] don't how many messages how many quotes
[2:27:08] that we could go through
[2:27:10] brother Brian even addresses this
[2:27:12] thinking and spoken words original C
[2:27:14] well if you had it like this would you
[2:27:16] be like an act like Abraham like you
[2:27:19] know no we don't have to go dwell
[2:27:21] intense
[2:27:22] it was all a type
[2:27:24] but when he stood there that day and he
[2:27:26] says who do men say that I am
[2:27:31] some say you're Jeremiah some say you're
[2:27:33] enlightened
[2:27:35] some say on and on and on but what was
[2:27:37] it it was that portion of Christ that
[2:27:40] was reflected through Jeremiah through
[2:27:43] Atlanta
[2:27:44] and that's the same way it is in our
[2:27:46] lives it's a that portion of Christ
[2:27:48] because you or me and ourselves are not
[2:27:51] the entire body we are a member of the
[2:27:54] body
[2:27:55] and then collectively together this is
[2:27:58] why we need one another because you know
[2:28:00] what it is it's Christ in me longing for
[2:28:03] Christ in you
[2:28:04] that's how the body operates
[2:28:06] and so it's us it's yielding and letting
[2:28:10] go and all of that is the glory of God
[2:28:12] taking place I mean I just say it like
[2:28:14] this the glory of God is just not the
[2:28:15] event that is we see but it's his glory
[2:28:18] that's working behind the scenes where
[2:28:20] our will is submitting to his will
[2:28:22] that's the glory of God
[2:28:24] because before you ever seen the glory
[2:28:26] in the outer Realms of the Tabernacle it
[2:28:29] was the glory abiding within the holiest
[2:28:31] of holies
[2:28:32] and every one of those Realms everyone
[2:28:35] the veil is what it was called then the
[2:28:37] hanging then the gate every one of them
[2:28:41] veil was was separated it had the
[2:28:44] cherubims on it but every one of them
[2:28:46] had the same coloration red blue white
[2:28:50] the purple all the way
[2:28:52] you know why because from in the end it
[2:28:55] would be Christ reflecting from within
[2:28:57] all the way through
[2:28:59] and that's why brother Brahms says when
[2:29:02] the Holy Ghost comes he doesn't take
[2:29:04] away your temperament
[2:29:06] your temperament is your makeup
[2:29:10] right
[2:29:12] I mean we could just preach husbands and
[2:29:14] wives here right now right
[2:29:17] husbands can't change their wives wives
[2:29:19] can't change the husband God put us
[2:29:20] together
[2:29:21] right and that's why brother Brandon
[2:29:23] says the Holy Spirit comes and sets down
[2:29:24] in the middle
[2:29:26] of your temperament
[2:29:29] and that's why he would take a service
[2:29:30] like that and things that are to be and
[2:29:32] say if you ever tried to judge James by
[2:29:35] Peter
[2:29:36] you would put James out
[2:29:38] or judge Paul about Peter or just see we
[2:29:42] don't judge one another by our lives
[2:29:44] our Our Lives individually are judged by
[2:29:46] the words it's us and God
[2:29:49] and it's Christ in US
[2:29:52] it's God working God Desiring to be
[2:29:54] expressed that that longing that you
[2:29:56] have in your life that I have in my life
[2:29:58] you know what that is that's God
[2:30:00] longing to be expressed
[2:30:04] that's the groaning that you have that's
[2:30:07] the desire that you have
[2:30:10] that's God longing to be expressed
[2:30:15] so it's it's Christ in us and it's I say
[2:30:18] God make it more real
[2:30:20] make it more real they help me help me
[2:30:23] Lord to dine more to myself because when
[2:30:25] God makes it more real I want you to
[2:30:26] understand this and I believe you do
[2:30:28] making it more real doesn't mean where
[2:30:29] it just goes
[2:30:31] when it becomes more real you realize
[2:30:34] just how simple
[2:30:36] it really is
[2:30:37] and when you realize wait a minute how
[2:30:40] many times you hear Brother Brown say
[2:30:41] this over and over
[2:30:43] this guy right here
[2:30:45] is my worst enemy but if I can just
[2:30:47] surrender to the god in a human being
[2:30:52] I'm not preaching on tonight's service
[2:30:57] because there's nothing to be added to
[2:30:59] that this morning it just I just I just
[2:31:00] I loved it to me that's it's
[2:31:05] yeah you can put that in your lunchbox
