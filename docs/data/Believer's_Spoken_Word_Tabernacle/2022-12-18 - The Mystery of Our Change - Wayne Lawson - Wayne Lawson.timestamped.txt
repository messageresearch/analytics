[30:56] Glory
[30:58] just so anybody knows we don't bite if
[31:01] you set this close
[31:05] we've uh we've had our shots and
[31:08] I think brother Lang's had his shots and
[31:10] so
[31:11] we're good to go
[31:14] it's good to be a Christian isn't it
[31:17] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[31:20] it's good to serve the Lord and I'm glad
[31:22] like that Psalm says that he truly is
[31:25] he's unshakable
[31:28] he's Unstoppable
[31:30] and what's just so awesome about all
[31:33] that that really brings that to light is
[31:35] he's unchangeable
[31:39] whatever he did once
[31:42] is a prophecy for who he is and what he
[31:45] will continue to do
[31:48] and what a comfort that is to our lives
[31:51] even as we come together and we assemble
[31:53] together here this morning
[31:55] we come and we we receive strength
[31:58] from the presence of the Lord
[32:00] you know it's just like you know you
[32:02] have a garden hose and you're trying to
[32:05] get water out to a certain location
[32:07] you know you got to make sure there's no
[32:09] kinks in that hose
[32:11] my wife this past year she wanted me
[32:14] finally after all these years I put in a
[32:16] box garden for her
[32:19] but we had to step and I got to get that
[32:21] water out there you know so you always
[32:23] got to worry about kinks in the holes
[32:25] and I believe God has called each and
[32:27] every one of us to be a real Channel
[32:30] a conduit that the Holy Ghost can just
[32:32] work through and flow through
[32:34] you know sometimes in the service how
[32:36] God will work in such a peculiar way
[32:39] is God will move right through even as
[32:41] your praise and your worship and you
[32:43] entering right in and just
[32:45] just drawing strength from El Shaddai
[32:48] it'll move
[32:49] right to the very need not only in your
[32:53] life but the lives of others
[32:56] I told you different times there's times
[32:58] where I've been in situations and maybe
[33:01] it felt a little tight
[33:02] so for me as a minister and knowing some
[33:04] of that I'd kind of position myself in
[33:06] that audience and I just start pulling
[33:09] on the gift of God
[33:11] the way I've always looked at it in this
[33:12] way right here sometimes
[33:14] I said you know if I'm sitting back
[33:16] there and I just start pulling on the
[33:17] gift of God I look at like a great
[33:19] canopy that just starts getting pulled
[33:21] over
[33:22] you know why there's nothing I love more
[33:24] than to see God's people help
[33:27] see God's people blessed and
[33:29] strengthened amen There's No Greater Joy
[33:32] because he's the joy of Our Lives where
[33:36] would we be without God
[33:38] where would we be without his Mercy
[33:40] without his grace
[33:41] amen
[33:43] what a privilege it is to serve the Lord
[33:47] brother Wayne is here with us I'm not
[33:49] sure why I think he just loves me a
[33:51] whole lot and that's why he came by this
[33:53] morning he just said I for the family I
[33:54] love you and I've got to be there
[33:58] I believe he does but I know there's
[34:00] other things
[34:02] amen and we we thank God for his
[34:05] Blessing amen how God is blessed brother
[34:08] Brian and sister Mariah and you know
[34:11] this scriptures I I just thought of this
[34:13] this scripture in the Book of Psalms
[34:15] here just um you know a week or a couple
[34:18] weeks ago and
[34:20] little Amelia arrived and I thought of
[34:22] that scripture of how low children are
[34:25] in Heritage of the Lord
[34:28] amen and the fruit of the womb is his
[34:32] reward
[34:33] what a blessing children are
[34:36] that God has entrusted to us
[34:39] the lines and how God has blessed the
[34:41] home bless the marriage
[34:43] amen and what a what a privilege it is
[34:45] you know it's just something that is
[34:47] there within you you know as parents
[34:49] um it just it draws something out of you
[34:52] that God placed there already
[34:54] and even in the times that lay before
[34:57] you you could become perplexed trying to
[35:01] think oh if I do I have the answer for
[35:02] this do I have the answer for that but
[35:04] you know it's it's already built in
[35:07] and God just directs that everything is
[35:10] every situation arises and God's God
[35:13] even helps around people that's already
[35:15] been through that it just
[35:17] God knows he's got all that Comfort put
[35:20] in place
[35:21] that's the same way it is spiritually in
[35:23] our lives
[35:24] when we've been born again of the spirit
[35:26] of God well we don't know all the every
[35:28] step along the way but
[35:31] he's right there it's it's already built
[35:33] within us
[35:34] amen
[35:35] and God's got wisdom and helps along the
[35:38] way and I also thought of this scripture
[35:40] here I love this scripture a lot
[35:42] it speaks of how in Mark chapter 10 if I
[35:45] could just read that scripture in verse
[35:46] 13 the Bible says they brought young
[35:49] children to him to the Lord Jesus and
[35:52] there's no greater place to take our
[35:53] children to
[35:55] that's right amen and that's what this
[35:57] message has done for us it has brought
[36:00] Jesus Christ present and personal in our
[36:04] lives
[36:05] no greater no greater person that we can
[36:08] bring our children to than the Lord
[36:11] Jesus Christ
[36:13] for what purpose
[36:14] that he should touch them
[36:19] and his disciples where they rebuked him
[36:21] but Jesus saw it
[36:22] he was much displeased and he said
[36:24] suffer the little children to come unto
[36:26] me and forbid them not for such is the
[36:28] kingdom of God
[36:29] and whosoever shall not receive the
[36:31] kingdom of God as a little child he
[36:33] shall not enter therein
[36:34] and he took him up in his arms and he
[36:37] put his hands upon him and he blessed
[36:39] him
[36:41] I believe we know and we we think about
[36:43] when we come through this we don't we
[36:46] know we don't believe in infant baptism
[36:48] because it's not scriptural
[36:50] but we believe in following the
[36:51] scriptures
[36:53] and bringing
[36:55] to the Lord Jesus bring in our children
[36:58] and we dedicate them and you know what
[37:00] that dedication is it's recognized God
[37:01] you've entrusted this life to us
[37:04] so with everything Lord as my life is
[37:06] dedicated to you
[37:08] I want to dedicate their lives to you
[37:10] and everything that we do
[37:12] because the world is dedicating
[37:13] themselves to knowledge and everything
[37:16] else they're dedicating to it and
[37:18] oh there's
[37:20] there's an effect there's a reality when
[37:24] we dedicate Our Lives to the Lord
[37:26] dedicate our children in every in every
[37:28] situation and praying and trusting the
[37:31] Lord
[37:32] there's a reality
[37:34] that he would touch them
[37:37] amen and as we I just want to invite

[48:31] God in his fatherhood and his life and

[51:56] chapter 3
[51:58] y'all had to forgive me for being a big

[52:01] uh
[52:02] Lord still moves my heart I just I just
[52:05] it just it just the grace of God that
[52:08] has been given to our lives
[52:11] Philippians chapter 3
[52:14] uh
[52:19] Philippians 3 and verse 20.
[52:25] for our conversation is in heaven
[52:29] from whence also we look for the savior
[52:32] the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:35] who shall change our vile body and I
[52:37] always like when I read this to stop and
[52:40] say
[52:40] who shall change our vow body it doesn't
[52:44] say what it says who
[52:47] so the change is a as a person
[52:50] who shall change the Lord Jesus who
[52:52] shall change our vowed body
[52:55] it may be fashioned like it unto his own
[52:57] glorious body
[52:58] according to the working whereby he is
[53:01] able to subdue all things to himself
[53:05] I want to read one more scripture and
[53:07] I'll just read it for you first
[53:08] Corinthians 15 51.
[53:11] behold I'll show you a mystery
[53:14] we shall not all sleep
[53:16] but we shall all be changed
[53:20] may God bless you as you be seated today
[53:23] I wanted maybe just to approach
[53:25] something for a few moments this morning
[53:27] on the mystery of our change
[53:30] and just want to maybe speak to you I've
[53:33] just been in a a Bible Conference on the
[53:36] Rapture and these things are really on
[53:38] my heart and so I just want to maybe
[53:40] speak a couple things to you today and
[53:42] pray the Lord would help us I know these
[53:45] are troubling times that we're looking
[53:46] at and I know the world and the season
[53:49] and the day we're living I know there's
[53:51] trouble everywhere
[53:53] I know that there is uh fear there's
[53:55] there's threats of nuclear weapons
[53:58] there's there's just so much happening
[54:00] in the church in the world that we're
[54:02] living in and uh and in these times
[54:05] questions come up there's a there's
[54:07] questions that come to the heart of the
[54:09] people and I believe that before there's
[54:12] a question there's got to be an answer
[54:14] and if it's a Bible question there's a
[54:16] Bible answer
[54:18] now there couldn't be a question if
[54:20] there wasn't an answer and so I I think
[54:23] of a prophet of how that he would say
[54:26] and do things I I'm a Hunter a bit
[54:28] myself I I do some raccoon hunting I
[54:31] when I was a kid down the bottoms there
[54:33] in Arkansas along the Black River we we
[54:35] did a lot of that and early in our lives
[54:37] and I wasn't very successful but I
[54:39] really like to do it but one thing that
[54:41] I learned is that whenever you're you're
[54:43] in flat country there's not a lot of
[54:45] landmarks it's not like the mountains
[54:46] you're viewing there where you know I
[54:48] can stand here and I believe that looks
[54:50] just like Lake Mary in Calgary uh just
[54:53] above Calgary they're in Banff I think
[54:54] it is it looks just like it because I've
[54:57] seen those landmarks and if it's not
[54:59] it's very very much like it uh but when
[55:02] you start seeing landmarks um you're
[55:05] able to see things and you're able to to
[55:07] get a direction from those mountains or
[55:09] whatever but when you flat ground I grew
[55:12] up in flat ground along flat bottoms of
[55:14] a river and if the if the fog would
[55:16] settle down and use out there and you
[55:18] talked about three times around the bush
[55:19] or something you take off walking and
[55:21] you think for sure you're headed north
[55:23] and you'll be headed east or south or
[55:25] west or it's so easy to get turned
[55:27] around because of of the fog and brother
[55:30] Brown teaches an entire uh a sermon on
[55:32] this when he talks about how the spirit
[55:35] of truth remember he tells about how he
[55:37] got lost when he was he was hunting he
[55:39] went over a mountain and he was right up
[55:40] there in the Adirondacks actually in the
[55:42] mountains and here just north of us and
[55:44] he got to chasing after a bear and then
[55:46] he shot a deer and he said it got foggy
[55:49] and he said the confusion came he said I
[55:50] took off and thought well I was going to
[55:52] just walk this way he said in a minute
[55:53] here I was back that deer again he said
[55:55] I did that about three times he said
[55:57] finally I said well I'm just going to
[55:59] turn and walk this direction and
[56:02] and so when he did he said well I was
[56:04] going to just take off he said then a
[56:05] hand laid on my shoulder and he said
[56:07] when the hand laid on my shoulder he
[56:08] said I'm the uh I'm ever present help in
[56:11] time of trouble and he said when that
[56:13] hand laid on me he said all of a sudden
[56:14] he turned me and I looked and he said
[56:16] there was a there was a big a hole in
[56:19] the fog he said which let me see
[56:20] Hurricane Mountain which I knew he said
[56:23] I knew Hurricane Mountain and if I could
[56:24] ever see something I knew then I'd know
[56:26] the direction of what to go and remember
[56:28] what he said he said I was actually
[56:29] turning he said I was going the wrong
[56:32] direction 180 degrees the wrong
[56:34] direction he said but when he laid his
[56:36] hand on me the hole opened now I'm a guy
[56:39] that thinks about things like this but
[56:40] when I was a kid listening to the tapes
[56:42] all we was thinking you know a hole like
[56:44] a hole in a napkin or a hole in the
[56:46] paper that was a six mile Hole uh it it
[56:49] it it it and to a preacher and I think
[56:51] that's Church ages isn't it he looked
[56:54] through a big hole and he looked back
[56:56] and saw that Hurricane Mountain which
[56:58] which which gave him uh an Orient he was
[57:01] able to Orient himself and say wait a
[57:04] minute I'm headed this way and I need to
[57:05] be headed this way and it was because of
[57:07] that landmark and I realized that in the
[57:10] season that we're living in that we have
[57:12] a lot of people traveling with us and we
[57:14] walk along and we're fellowshipping with
[57:16] people and it's a little bit like having
[57:19] Hunting Buddies you know you're walking
[57:20] along and somebody says well the truck's
[57:21] this way and somebody else says well the
[57:23] truck's this way and after a little
[57:25] while you're going which way is the
[57:26] truck you know and and it's a little bit
[57:29] that way among the churches you know
[57:31] sometimes someone maybe they say this is
[57:34] happening or they look at it this
[57:35] direction but we we've got to remember
[57:38] that we have a message
[57:40] and uh in the middle of uh you know just
[57:44] as a church y'all we're all Christians
[57:46] and I hate to say this but not everybody
[57:48] listens to the message all the time
[57:49] sometimes they listen to different
[57:51] Ministries and sometimes people are
[57:53] listening to CNN and some are listening
[57:55] to the Fox News and some are watching
[57:57] conspiracy theories and they there's a
[58:00] lot of ideas out there amen there's a
[58:02] lot of confusion and and it matters who
[58:04] you're listening to of what you think's
[58:06] about to happen but when you start
[58:09] looking at this uh there's questions
[58:11] that is ask brother Branham and I think
[58:13] it's powerful to go back to a prophet
[58:15] and see what he had to say in 1964
[58:18] brother random has asked the question
[58:19] will the bride go through the
[58:21] persecution as the Apostolic Church did
[58:24] so as a bride as a church are we looking
[58:27] for a persecution is that what we're
[58:29] about to face that's what he's asking
[58:31] and he's not talking about the
[58:32] tribulation like uh that is coming but
[58:34] he's actually talking about persecution
[58:36] and as the early Apostolic church so in
[58:39] other words are we looking for some kind
[58:41] of a of a problem to come into the
[58:43] church to perfect us or are we looking
[58:45] for this kind of persecution that's
[58:47] going to make us get more serious and
[58:49] this is that what we're looking for and
[58:51] brother bam says no I just explained a
[58:53] few minutes ago the next thing we look
[58:55] for is a Rapture now we're at a Promised
[58:58] Land we're at a border you understand
[59:00] the march of Israel now this is my own
[59:02] thoughts ministering Brethren but in my
[59:04] own way I feel the Holy Spirit has
[59:06] revealed this to me the next thing
[59:08] that's to happen to the Gentile elected
[59:11] bride is to be caught up with the rest
[59:13] of the Gentile elected bride that's been
[59:15] down through of course the ages now
[59:17] brother random he's telling us the next
[59:20] thing now there's a reason they're
[59:21] asking him this because if you're a
[59:23] study of the message earlier in the
[59:25] messages brother Bynum is actually
[59:27] making it sound like there's a
[59:29] persecution coming to the church and
[59:31] we're going to go through some pretty uh
[59:33] big pre-tribulation things that's going
[59:35] to prepare us and he's saying that but
[59:37] he's saying that before the message of
[59:39] feast of the Trump into 1964 which I
[59:42] know you're taught these things but I
[59:43] need to get this to go and uh you see
[59:46] what happens is is brother random is
[59:48] looking to preach the Feast of the
[59:50] trumpets in 1964 and he comes along in
[59:53] that sermon and he said now I was going
[59:54] to preach to you the trumpets he said
[59:57] but the angel of the Lord revealed to me
[59:59] that I already preached the trumpet
[1:00:01] spiritually in the Seven Seals he said
[1:00:04] so what we're looking for now is we're
[1:00:05] not looking for the trumpets we're
[1:00:07] looking for the change of our body
[1:00:09] because what the trumpets are to Israel
[1:00:12] the seals are to the bride so whatever
[1:00:15] you think the trumpets are going to do
[1:00:16] to Israel the seals does that to the
[1:00:19] Bride of Jesus Christ so when he opens
[1:00:22] up the word what he's doing is he's
[1:00:24] doing to you what the trumpets do to
[1:00:27] Israel when they go to their homelands
[1:00:29] of course amen then National Force will
[1:00:31] put Israel in its Homeland but the power
[1:00:34] of God will put the bride in the Rapture
[1:00:37] now we got to expect something and you
[1:00:39] say what do we expect affecting brother
[1:00:41] bam said see he's done or give the
[1:00:43] church everything he did to Abraham
[1:00:45] there's except one thing and that's the
[1:00:47] change of the body so what the church
[1:00:50] ought to be expecting in this season is
[1:00:52] the change of the body he said by the
[1:00:54] way what are you expecting I am
[1:00:56] expecting a body change I am expecting a
[1:00:59] Rapture what am I expecting I am not
[1:01:01] expecting someone to capture us and to
[1:01:04] persecute us for the next while to get
[1:01:06] us ready I'm expecting any moment to
[1:01:08] look up and dead loved ones come walking
[1:01:10] down the aisles I'm looking for the
[1:01:13] opening of the door of mortal to
[1:01:15] immortality I'm looking for something to
[1:01:18] just sweep over the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ and in a moment in the twinkling
[1:01:22] of an eye we will step from one
[1:01:24] dimension to another that's my
[1:01:26] expectation that's what I'm living for
[1:01:29] that's what I'm looking for is the
[1:01:31] changing of our body now the prophet of
[1:01:33] God said of course after the sign was
[1:01:35] given unto Abraham the next thing that
[1:01:38] happened to Abraham was the change of
[1:01:40] his body y'all know Abraham had a body
[1:01:42] change amen and so is the bride going to
[1:01:44] have a body change what happened to
[1:01:46] Abraham right before the change of his
[1:01:48] body Melchizedek or Elohim came down and
[1:01:51] human flesh and showed a sign and then
[1:01:54] his body was changed what have we had in
[1:01:56] the message of the hour we've had
[1:01:58] allowed him to come and to take a mortal
[1:02:01] man amen and to show us the last sign
[1:02:04] now I know people got on the blood moons
[1:02:06] and they get on the signs and they look
[1:02:08] at all these signs but Jesus said
[1:02:10] there'll be no sign given except for the
[1:02:13] sign of the son of man or resurrection
[1:02:15] and we have received our last sign
[1:02:19] Church of the Living God we're not
[1:02:21] looking for a sign this morning we're
[1:02:23] not looking for the blood to show up in
[1:02:25] the moon we're not looking for somebody
[1:02:27] to do something we have already had the
[1:02:30] thing that God said the church would
[1:02:32] have before the change of our body the
[1:02:34] next thing to happen in the church is
[1:02:37] the changing of our body that's exactly
[1:02:39] what we're looking looking forward there
[1:02:41] is nothing to hinder the change of our
[1:02:44] body outside of the Readiness of this
[1:02:46] church
[1:02:48] amen there's nothing amen amen there's
[1:02:50] no scripture in here this morning
[1:02:52] prevents the body change there's no
[1:02:54] scripture that has to be fulfilled to
[1:02:56] prevent the church from moving in it was
[1:02:58] the Readiness of the church brother
[1:03:00] Madam says every Vision has been
[1:03:02] fulfilled or is in the process of doing
[1:03:04] so right now I think we ought to look at
[1:03:07] it this morning and ask us where are we
[1:03:09] in this ibrahimic age we are in the
[1:03:12] season of change we are in the time of
[1:03:14] change this is the time right now that
[1:03:18] the church must get off of the scene
[1:03:20] because God is turning to the Jews
[1:03:23] God cannot God cannot reveal himself
[1:03:27] unto the Jew until the bride is out of
[1:03:29] the way it is time for the church to get
[1:03:31] off of the scene you can see it if you
[1:03:34] if you if you look in the news you can
[1:03:36] see it you can see it's the time uh you
[1:03:38] know I I was sitting here I was talking
[1:03:40] to some brethren the other day and I I
[1:03:42] said you know we're in our age group
[1:03:43] amen we we lived in the time period when
[1:03:46] I was a kid I heard the old Pastor
[1:03:48] preach amen uh Russia is going to bomb
[1:03:51] us and I think that's all he knew at
[1:03:52] that time it's what he he definitely had
[1:03:55] our attention as a kid I remember that
[1:03:57] amen I didn't remember much else but I
[1:03:59] remember Russia is going to get us you
[1:04:01] know well it didn't as a kid I remember
[1:04:03] when I think it was during Ronald Reagan
[1:04:05] when they took down the Berlin wall and
[1:04:07] things and they changed the Russia to
[1:04:10] USSR and I thought well that's odd
[1:04:12] because it don't even call it Russian
[1:04:14] then all of a sudden here we go back and
[1:04:16] you come under this uh Putin fella and
[1:04:18] all of a sudden Russia's Russia again
[1:04:20] and it's not just Russia it's Russia
[1:04:22] with aggression right all right now you
[1:04:25] I want I want to just take a moment and
[1:04:26] say this to you they don't have to
[1:04:28] develop an atom bomb to destroy us this
[1:04:30] morning that was developed years ago
[1:04:33] even in Russia at this moment they got
[1:04:35] the great Satan you know and it's
[1:04:37] designed to destroy now that that bomb
[1:04:40] is sitting there this morning they don't
[1:04:41] have to make it they don't have to
[1:04:43] program it they do not have to come up
[1:04:45] with missile engineering it is literally
[1:04:48] setting ready to go and they told us
[1:04:51] just a few months ago how long it would
[1:04:53] take them to destroy all of Europe you
[1:04:55] know they actually put minutes on France
[1:04:58] and London and the major cities and and
[1:05:00] Russia is literally talking about
[1:05:02] fulfilling Bible prophecy by making the
[1:05:06] concrete melt beneath us and they kept
[1:05:08] telling the Americans you can't hide in
[1:05:10] your homes for the scripture says that
[1:05:12] concrete's going to melt and great fire
[1:05:14] is going to fall from Heaven and they
[1:05:16] believe they're fulfilling scripture and
[1:05:18] they are because the prophet of God said
[1:05:20] listen thus saith the Lord Russia will
[1:05:23] destroy destroy the Vatican with a bomb
[1:05:25] amen amen we're living in a season amen
[1:05:27] when uh when a city can be destroyed in
[1:05:30] an hour and a nation could be born in a
[1:05:33] day things happen quick in this time you
[1:05:36] think it ain't gonna happen and all of a
[1:05:37] sudden it's right on top of you it's
[1:05:39] happening right there amen if you're
[1:05:41] watching the news you know what I'm
[1:05:42] talking about amen the the scientists
[1:05:45] are telling us we're closer to midnight
[1:05:47] right now than we were ever in the
[1:05:50] history they're saying we are we are in
[1:05:52] a greater threat of nuclear war than we
[1:05:55] were in 1960s under the missile crisis
[1:05:58] of Cuba we're look it's like somebody
[1:06:00] pushed a pause button in the 1960s and
[1:06:04] all of a sudden they've let off the
[1:06:05] pause button and things are right back
[1:06:08] where they are when the prophet of God
[1:06:10] was upon the scene Amen in the political
[1:06:13] world things have been set back that in
[1:06:16] a moment things could totally fall apart
[1:06:18] in this entire nation you said brother
[1:06:20] Wayne what are you trying to say I'm
[1:06:22] trying to say brother Brandon said if I
[1:06:23] wasn't a Christian I'd go crazy thinking
[1:06:26] this might happen at any time with a
[1:06:29] house full of little kitties and
[1:06:30] everything else I wouldn't know what to
[1:06:31] do but I'm glad that I can stand in my
[1:06:34] house and introduce them to the greatest
[1:06:36] bomb shelter that that bombs or nothing
[1:06:40] else could ever touch them under the
[1:06:43] protecting wings of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:45] Christ not by might or not by power but
[1:06:48] by my spirit that is our protection if
[1:06:52] you want a protection get the power of
[1:06:54] the Holy Ghost in your home you wanted
[1:06:56] protection get the power of the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost in your church the only way you
[1:07:01] can protect your family is get them
[1:07:03] under the token of the blood of Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ there is no bomb shelter can keep
[1:07:08] you out of this war that's coming there
[1:07:11] is nothing you can do to prepare for
[1:07:13] this that is coming there is only one
[1:07:15] thing for you to do is don't be scared
[1:07:18] of the hydrogen bombs as long as you got
[1:07:20] Christ in your heart that's the best
[1:07:22] bombshell I know of it's made out of
[1:07:25] feathers for under his wings shall we
[1:07:28] abide amen so you don't have to worry
[1:07:30] about that if you're a Christian
[1:07:33] and listen if you're a Christian this
[1:07:34] morning you don't have to worry about
[1:07:36] bonds if you're a Christian you don't
[1:07:38] have to worry about tribulation if
[1:07:40] you're a Christian you don't have to
[1:07:42] protect yourself The Protector almighty
[1:07:45] God has been invited into your home to
[1:07:48] protect can Shield you Amen in this time
[1:07:52] in place now brother I know I know
[1:07:55] William Branham was a judgment Prophet
[1:07:56] we all know brother Brown spoke judgment
[1:07:59] over this nation amen but you got to
[1:08:01] catch your spirit brother Brandon would
[1:08:03] never preach judgment without preaching
[1:08:04] Mercy
[1:08:06] now I know I know you probably have
[1:08:09] caught this but his Spirit on judgment
[1:08:11] it just it just blesses me to hear a
[1:08:13] prophet's Spirit about this because I
[1:08:15] was reading one day and I was I was
[1:08:17] actually reading about all this judgment
[1:08:18] that was coming and I was reading about
[1:08:21] it and I was studying some things
[1:08:22] brother random said and he's in in a
[1:08:24] message you can you can look it up it's
[1:08:26] a message I stay at the door or not
[1:08:27] mother Madam actually talks about
[1:08:30] that he wants to preach a message on the
[1:08:33] handwriting on the wall
[1:08:34] and he wants to preach it but he only
[1:08:36] had one service to do it so he wouldn't
[1:08:39] preach the handwriting on the wall
[1:08:40] instead he preached a different sermon
[1:08:42] he said because listen I wouldn't want
[1:08:45] to leave the people in that condition
[1:08:47] without bringing a message to follow it
[1:08:50] to give hopes to the church he said then
[1:08:53] at least the people wondering and makes
[1:08:55] them nervous so brother Brandon wouldn't
[1:08:57] preach the handwriting on the wall
[1:08:59] without preaching the next service amen
[1:09:03] the church rapturing before tribulation
[1:09:05] so he wouldn't even preach the Judgment
[1:09:07] sermon without preaching the Rapture
[1:09:09] sermon in the evening and I think of the
[1:09:12] grace of God Amen that pointed out the
[1:09:14] Judgment Upon This Nation but at the
[1:09:17] same time he gave the church Grace by
[1:09:20] telling them about a Rapture with every
[1:09:22] Temptation there is a way of Escape God
[1:09:26] always makes a way of escape and the
[1:09:28] Rapture of the church see before it can
[1:09:31] take place before it can take place the
[1:09:33] Rapture comes and takes the church
[1:09:34] Church home listen brother man said this
[1:09:37] Russia of course is going to bomb amen
[1:09:39] before the first bomb ever strikes he
[1:09:41] said we'll be sitting in the wedding
[1:09:43] supper Amen in other words you you may
[1:09:46] not know this but in 1962 brother Brown
[1:09:48] said the issue came for Russia to bomb
[1:09:51] us back then he said and and one of the
[1:09:53] American generals were told to push the
[1:09:56] button to to launch some nuclear strike
[1:09:58] against Russia he said something checked
[1:10:00] him and he wouldn't do it brother man
[1:10:02] said I talked to the man personally he
[1:10:04] said minutes later he said the call came
[1:10:07] and said I'm glad you didn't do it it
[1:10:09] was a blip on the screen and brother
[1:10:11] Brandon said why didn't that General
[1:10:12] fire them missiles he said because
[1:10:14] somebody was left on the earth that was
[1:10:17] needing Redemption listen friend I
[1:10:20] believe there'll come a day the last
[1:10:21] seed's going to be in I believe the last
[1:10:23] seed will be upon the Earth and then
[1:10:25] this thing's going to go that was what
[1:10:27] we were waiting on we weren't waiting on
[1:10:30] persecution we were waiting on the last
[1:10:32] seed
[1:10:34] now I believe you are to comfort one
[1:10:35] another with these words and the prophet
[1:10:37] said that sometimes you can only get
[1:10:39] Comfort out of the word of God and they
[1:10:41] ask him will the family go in the
[1:10:43] Rapture if the Rapture comes you don't
[1:10:45] have children you don't understand this
[1:10:46] these bombers with these little babies
[1:10:48] and these young people they understand
[1:10:50] this if a Rapture would happen what
[1:10:52] happens to my baby brother Adam said if
[1:10:55] the Rapture takes place for the
[1:10:56] believer's family wife and children go
[1:10:58] he said yes if they're in faith and they
[1:11:00] trust the Lord you don't have to leave
[1:11:01] them babies behind amen think about it
[1:11:04] this morning I'm preaching Rapture and
[1:11:06] got a grandbaby back there but listen if
[1:11:08] God has got her name in the Lamb's Book
[1:11:10] of Life and I believe it is I don't
[1:11:12] believe God give me any serpent seed
[1:11:14] amen I believe her name's in the Lamb's
[1:11:16] Book of Life I have to believe that from
[1:11:17] my heart that if a Rapture would take
[1:11:20] place amen you know what's going to
[1:11:21] happen brother West God's going to take
[1:11:23] old people and make them young again and
[1:11:25] he's going to take young people and he's
[1:11:27] going to bring them to the 20 year old
[1:11:29] Mark the same God that can change an old
[1:11:31] man can change a young child and put it
[1:11:34] at the same age we have got a God who
[1:11:37] can bring immortality I've refused to
[1:11:40] live in fear I refuse unless the devil
[1:11:43] pray under a fear fear where I cannot
[1:11:45] worship God
[1:11:46] I'm not going to need a bomb shelter I'm
[1:11:48] already in the bomb shelter I've already
[1:11:51] got the protection of the baptism of the
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost oh I tell you it's a time to
[1:11:56] get into Christ
[1:11:57] God does nothing without a purpose we
[1:12:01] might as well preach it Heavenly the God
[1:12:03] I serve don't do anything without a
[1:12:04] purpose listen if God has got to have a
[1:12:07] purpose in doing things he has a purpose
[1:12:09] in the tribulation that's coming
[1:12:12] you all know the purpose don't you
[1:12:13] threefold brother man said Purge 144
[1:12:17] 000. Purge a foolish version Purge the
[1:12:19] Earth that's the threefold purpose of
[1:12:21] The Sixth Seal
[1:12:23] sometimes you study something and it's
[1:12:25] not what you find in it it's what you
[1:12:27] don't find in it
[1:12:28] that's where the blessing is when you
[1:12:30] study The Sixth Seal if you take time go
[1:12:32] through it one thing you'll never find
[1:12:35] in The Sixth Seal is the bride
[1:12:37] The Sixth Seal does not include the
[1:12:41] Bride of Jesus Christ she is not there
[1:12:44] matter of fact the tribulation cannot
[1:12:46] even begin until the bride leaves the
[1:12:50] bride is not in Tribulation there is no
[1:12:52] reason for her to be in Tribulation
[1:12:54] because she has been purged under the
[1:12:57] seventh seal which has purged her of all
[1:13:00] of her sins so there's no reason for her
[1:13:03] to go through a purging she has already
[1:13:05] been purged by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:08] listen we're sitting here this morning I
[1:13:10] believe it ought to be settled in every
[1:13:12] believer's heart that that she never
[1:13:14] takes a tribulation you can't put that
[1:13:17] bride in the tribulation the bride's
[1:13:19] gone that's right because she has not
[1:13:21] one sin against her at all that's how
[1:13:24] the prophet preaches she won't go in
[1:13:25] Tribulation because she got no sin to
[1:13:28] pay for amen what has happened to her
[1:13:30] sin the grace of God has covered her the
[1:13:33] bleach has tooken so far away from her
[1:13:36] that's not even a remembrance but the
[1:13:39] Purity and the perfect blessedness in
[1:13:42] the presence of almighty God I think we
[1:13:44] already get on my knees and cry out to
[1:13:46] God there's no reason to have a
[1:13:48] tribulation for this bride she's already
[1:13:50] spotless and sinless before her God
[1:13:53] listen brother they ain't nothing can
[1:13:55] make a man spotless outside of the blood
[1:13:57] of Jesus Christ but the power of the
[1:14:00] blood it has an ability to change the
[1:14:02] life to change your heart to move a life
[1:14:05] to completely cleanse the soul
[1:14:08] amen somebody said well by the way and I
[1:14:10] don't know anybody hey man the sinless
[1:14:12] let's read a prophet a church has been
[1:14:14] judged they've been judged themselves
[1:14:16] they've accepted the blood and how can
[1:14:18] God judge a man that's perfectly totally
[1:14:22] sinless
[1:14:24] you say there's no such a person he said
[1:14:27] every born-again True Believer is
[1:14:30] perfectly absolutely sinless before God
[1:14:33] that's not out of an almanac that's a
[1:14:36] Vindicated Prophet that's looking at the
[1:14:38] heart of almighty God and he's judging
[1:14:41] the church from the heart of God he said
[1:14:43] there's no sin against her at all
[1:14:47] brother
[1:14:50] how can you ever take a man through the
[1:14:52] bleach of the blood of Christ between
[1:14:53] him and God it scatters sin so far
[1:14:56] up
[1:14:57] I don't know how to say it other than
[1:14:59] this that I uh you know have you ever
[1:15:03] had have you ever had an experience with
[1:15:05] bleach
[1:15:07] anybody ever had experiences with bleach
[1:15:10] as a young guy you know when I was a kid
[1:15:12] I worked I worked all summer long I was
[1:15:15] about 16 17 my dad didn't know a 40-hour
[1:15:17] week if he didn't know it at all you
[1:15:19] know what a 40-hour week was we worked
[1:15:21] we worked from can to can't
[1:15:23] we weren't construction you know if you
[1:15:26] could you worked if you couldn't you
[1:15:27] didn't that's all it was six days a week
[1:15:29] 80 90 hours in a week it was
[1:15:31] construction and we worked out and well
[1:15:34] you give a 17 year old a check but he's
[1:15:36] working 80 hours a week you know
[1:15:38] here I go down the Brass Buckle
[1:15:40] [Laughter]
[1:15:41] but I had them in that day
[1:15:43] and they were just as expensive in that
[1:15:45] day as they are now
[1:15:47] man I could burn up 250 or 300 on a pair
[1:15:50] of pants and nice shirt you know you had
[1:15:53] to look good you know
[1:15:56] I go home
[1:15:58] you know she's a lovely lady
[1:16:00] and she bleaches everything like a you
[1:16:03] know kitchen and the sinks and
[1:16:06] take that bleach rag
[1:16:08] and she put it over in the laundry
[1:16:10] basket
[1:16:11] and every once in a while I'd take a
[1:16:13] pair of them 150 blue jeans
[1:16:16] and I'd throw it in the laundry basket
[1:16:18] and the next day they come out of the
[1:16:19] dryer and I went
[1:16:22] mom
[1:16:23] you didn't have to tell me what happened
[1:16:24] in blue jeans
[1:16:26] I don't have to explain to me a minute
[1:16:28] what happened I knew the instant I
[1:16:31] know somebody had a rag but bleach in
[1:16:33] that in that laundromat
[1:16:35] she said how'd you know I said look at
[1:16:37] the spots there ain't nothing else to do
[1:16:40] that to a pair of jeans overnight
[1:16:42] it takes bleaks to do that now some
[1:16:45] people you know if you come to me and
[1:16:47] said brother Wayne I I just dip this
[1:16:49] suit and bleached last week and I said
[1:16:52] no no you didn't
[1:16:54] no you didn't how do you know because I
[1:16:57] have experienced bleach
[1:16:59] I haven't I know what it has the power
[1:17:02] to do
[1:17:03] and some people tell me they put their
[1:17:05] lives in the blood no no no no no no
[1:17:08] so what do you mean it's I've
[1:17:10] experienced the bleach of the blood I
[1:17:13] know the power of the blood I know what
[1:17:15] it can do for a life listen there is
[1:17:18] nothing like the power of the blood of
[1:17:20] Jesus Christ to change a man's heart to
[1:17:23] change a man's nature to change a man's
[1:17:26] life he said brother Wayne how do I get
[1:17:28] into the blood the blood is by the word
[1:17:30] and the spirit of God in this generation
[1:17:33] we're not have a tub of bleach up here
[1:17:35] we don't have a tub of blood up here
[1:17:36] we've got the word preached in
[1:17:38] inspiration and there's a spirit behind
[1:17:41] it and it cleanses the heart as a man
[1:17:44] receives the word he receives the spirit
[1:17:46] of God and it cleanses that life and
[1:17:49] brings the power of God into our hearts
[1:17:52] now of course this bride don't go to a
[1:17:54] tribulation there's no reason for her to
[1:17:56] go through tribulation because she don't
[1:17:59] go in it
[1:18:00] I'm sorry I study a lot but you know are
[1:18:04] you study the Book of Revelation study
[1:18:05] the fifth chapter you think there's a
[1:18:07] lot of good things in there but the
[1:18:08] powerful things what's not in there
[1:18:09] that's right
[1:18:11] the powerful things what's not in there
[1:18:13] there's no devil in the Book of
[1:18:14] Revelation 5. there's no accuser in
[1:18:17] Revelations 5. amen you see that there's
[1:18:20] no accuser there because the bleach of
[1:18:22] the blood is done away with the accuser
[1:18:24] in your life he said by the way I want
[1:18:26] to live without seeing you kind of get
[1:18:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your
[1:18:31] life and if it comes in amen then that
[1:18:34] life is settled under the blood now
[1:18:37] you've got to know who you are to know
[1:18:39] what applies to you and where you're
[1:18:41] going let me just let me just say this
[1:18:42] is the best way I know how to say it you
[1:18:45] gotta identify yourself because you know
[1:18:46] it's easy to identify yourself with
[1:18:48] someone else's scripture
[1:18:50] right you got to know who you are in
[1:18:52] scripture so that you get the scripture
[1:18:54] for your life you go to um you go to
[1:18:56] Apostle Peter he's a good example he's
[1:18:58] standing there with Jesus one day he
[1:19:00] said who do you say I am he said without
[1:19:01] the Christ the son of God he said that's
[1:19:03] right Simon he said flesh and blood is
[1:19:06] not revealed to this from this day on
[1:19:07] I'll call you Peter he changed from
[1:19:09] Simon to Peter and then in a minute the
[1:19:11] Lord's told him he was going to go to
[1:19:13] Calvary and be crucified in a minute he
[1:19:15] told him that Peter said not so Lord you
[1:19:17] ain't gonna go and Jesus said get behind
[1:19:18] me devil he got he got another name
[1:19:21] change
[1:19:22] now you can only imagine with that
[1:19:24] mentality sitting at the supper the last
[1:19:27] supper and he said somebody's going to
[1:19:29] portray me well it would have been a
[1:19:31] pretty short jump
[1:19:33] for Peter to think he's talking about
[1:19:35] him
[1:19:36] and he literally says is it me Lord
[1:19:40] but Peter could not take judas's place
[1:19:44] even if he didn't feel worthy even if he
[1:19:47] thought that was he couldn't take that
[1:19:48] place it didn't belong to him
[1:19:51] it belonged to Judas and you have no
[1:19:54] right to say or position yourself in the
[1:19:57] scripture that is God the Creator's
[1:20:00] right to position you in the word and he
[1:20:02] sends the message of the hour to
[1:20:05] position the bride so that you will know
[1:20:07] that's your place and that's your place
[1:20:09] and that's your place you got to know
[1:20:11] who you are in the scripture it's just
[1:20:13] like a if you if you if you read this
[1:20:15] here in the scripture you say well
[1:20:17] preacher what do you mean let me just
[1:20:18] put it like this in the scripture there
[1:20:20] is an Eleazar of course we're not the
[1:20:23] Elisha right
[1:20:24] that's a prophet but if there's an
[1:20:26] Eleazar then there's got to be a Rebecca
[1:20:30] if there's an elevation there's got to
[1:20:31] be a Rebecca so if you see that you are
[1:20:34] Rebecca in the scripture then you know
[1:20:36] how you're going to get into the Rapture
[1:20:38] or the meeting in the air you got to see
[1:20:40] how Rebecca got from the whale over to
[1:20:43] meet Isaac and the prophet of God said
[1:20:45] of course Rebecca was the one that
[1:20:47] showed up in the evening light remember
[1:20:49] when Elijah went out to the well and
[1:20:51] there Rebecca come out to him isn't it
[1:20:53] beautiful when you study that that when
[1:20:56] Elisha walks up to the well he don't
[1:20:58] Tell Rebecca everything that he prayed
[1:21:00] but he just before she comes up he prays
[1:21:03] and said Lord the woman that's a right
[1:21:05] woman when she comes up let me ask and
[1:21:08] she'll offer me a drink and then she
[1:21:10] will also water my camels amen now now
[1:21:13] elieza doesn't tell her what he prayed
[1:21:16] but when she responded to Elisha she
[1:21:20] said the very words that he had said in
[1:21:22] his prayer showing she had the
[1:21:24] Revelation to match the coming of Elisha
[1:21:28] how she responded to Elisha told us who
[1:21:31] she was now look at your response to
[1:21:33] this message I can identify you how you
[1:21:37] respond to the message of the hour now
[1:21:39] look at what she did when she saw this
[1:21:41] she said not only will I water you I
[1:21:43] water these camels and I don't have time
[1:21:44] to preach how much gallons it was but it
[1:21:46] was a lot amen and when she started
[1:21:48] watering those camels you know what the
[1:21:50] prophet of God said he said the camels
[1:21:52] is what brought Ellie easier
[1:21:56] and it was the same thing that was going
[1:21:59] to take Rebecca to meet Isaac whatever
[1:22:02] brought the prophet was going to take
[1:22:04] her to meet her Isaac and brother man
[1:22:06] said what brought the prophet was the
[1:22:08] power of the Holy Ghost and what's going
[1:22:10] to take the bride to meet her Isaac is
[1:22:13] the power of the Holy Ghost so as a
[1:22:15] Rebecca this morning we've got to water
[1:22:17] the power of the Holy Ghost listen amen
[1:22:21] if if the spirit of God starts falling
[1:22:23] flat in the church that's up to you hey
[1:22:25] man let's start watering that until the
[1:22:28] power of God moves with anointing listen
[1:22:30] we're not here this morning just to say
[1:22:32] oh I tell you the holy spirit's getting
[1:22:34] old and it's getting tired and we're
[1:22:35] just going to let it go no sir amen
[1:22:37] we're going to water the spirit of God
[1:22:39] we're going to praise the spirit of God
[1:22:41] until we refresh it in the midst of the
[1:22:44] church with the power and praise and
[1:22:47] because we are expecting this to take us
[1:22:49] to our Isaac and there's no other way to
[1:22:52] get there friends the Holy Ghost is the
[1:22:54] right the church will take by the power
[1:22:57] of God that Camel represents a power the
[1:23:00] power that brought her is the power that
[1:23:03] carries you into the presence of God
[1:23:05] Amen I tell you what's going to bring
[1:23:07] this church home it'll be the power of
[1:23:09] God it'll be the same thing that God
[1:23:11] uses when he changes your body it'll be
[1:23:14] the power of God when when Joseph took
[1:23:18] the wife of a gentile he only had that
[1:23:21] life with him until he wanted to give
[1:23:24] himself or reveal himself to his
[1:23:26] brethren in Israel and when he got ready
[1:23:29] to to reveal himself to Israel there had
[1:23:32] to come A change the bride had to be put
[1:23:34] in the palace you you are Joseph's wife
[1:23:38] in the story and you have got to move
[1:23:40] from the side of Joseph to the palace
[1:23:43] and there's only one way to get in the
[1:23:45] palace it's by the changing of the body
[1:23:47] everything in the scripture points that
[1:23:50] there's got to be a change he said
[1:23:52] preacher why are you saying this because
[1:23:53] if you know where you're going and you
[1:23:56] know what's about to happen you know how
[1:23:58] to prepare you know how to get ready
[1:24:00] listen we are not getting ready for
[1:24:02] tribulation we're not storing food to
[1:24:05] get us through the tribulation we are
[1:24:07] preparing for a Rapture and a paradox to
[1:24:10] come upon the Church of the Living God
[1:24:12] I'm looking for the change of our body
[1:24:14] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:24:17] we have entertained the presence of the
[1:24:19] one who can do the changing if you don't
[1:24:22] prepare how can you prepare if you don't
[1:24:26] know what's coming
[1:24:28] who are you you're the one who's going
[1:24:30] to change
[1:24:31] you are the people that's going to
[1:24:33] change before the resurrection of the
[1:24:37] tribulation could strike the Earth in
[1:24:39] Philippians 3 Paul actually says it he
[1:24:41] said our conversation from Heaven which
[1:24:43] we look for our savior the Lord Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ who shall change our body that
[1:24:48] will be fashioned like it unto his own
[1:24:50] glorious body according to the working
[1:24:52] whereby he is able to subdue all things
[1:24:55] to himself now I don't want to spend a
[1:24:57] long time here but I do want to draw
[1:24:59] this point
[1:25:00] who should change our vile body how many
[1:25:02] knows what that word vile actually
[1:25:03] stands for
[1:25:04] it means
[1:25:06] humiliation
[1:25:08] it's a powerful word
[1:25:10] Paul uses it and says a vile body
[1:25:13] in the Hebrew the word vile actually
[1:25:15] means humiliation a lower State brother
[1:25:18] random uses it in the junction of time
[1:25:20] as if he knew the Hebrew maybe he did
[1:25:22] maybe he didn't I don't know
[1:25:24] maybe he knew the Greek I don't know but
[1:25:26] he did say this Old Vile body of
[1:25:28] humiliation
[1:25:30] that we live in will be changed and be
[1:25:33] fashioned like an unto your own body
[1:25:36] and faith is the substance brother
[1:25:37] random said we're going to groaning
[1:25:39] we're veiled in this Tabernacle of
[1:25:41] humiliation and we have the earnest of
[1:25:43] our perfect and complete Redemption back
[1:25:44] like it was in the beginning when God
[1:25:46] created Adam in the Garden of Eden we
[1:25:48] have a foretaste of Glory Divine by the
[1:25:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:25:51] refreshment coming from the presence of
[1:25:53] God to water the church to make it grow
[1:25:55] in his grace
[1:25:57] now someday brother Brown said someday
[1:26:00] this Mortal will take on immortality
[1:26:03] hey man who shall change it who will
[1:26:07] make us move from this humiliation that
[1:26:10] we're living in to a glorified body who
[1:26:12] could make that happen brother random
[1:26:14] actually says it he said someday we're
[1:26:16] going out of this tent this Dwelling
[1:26:18] Place this Tabernacle of humiliation
[1:26:19] we're going to be changed we're going to
[1:26:22] step into a land of Purity and when our
[1:26:24] feet first touches that blessed Land
[1:26:26] This Old Ship is iron we're going to
[1:26:27] rush out it's all going to be over
[1:26:30] sickness and cripples and afflictions
[1:26:33] and everything's going to be gone old
[1:26:35] age and death and sorrow all these
[1:26:38] natural things that's caused by the
[1:26:40] curse will be gone forever we will be
[1:26:42] changed we will return back
[1:26:45] we will be turned back isn't it
[1:26:48] beautiful Amen Brother by Adam tells us
[1:26:50] this that this Tabernacle who now you
[1:26:53] you if you listen to the sermons you can
[1:26:56] hear Brother random in a sermon entitled
[1:26:58] to whom shall I go it's a powerful
[1:27:00] sermon because remember when Peter's
[1:27:03] talking to the Lord and Peter has has
[1:27:05] heard the Lord sound sounds like a
[1:27:07] contradiction and the Lord said Peter
[1:27:09] you can go also if you'd like and he
[1:27:11] said Lord to whom should we go brother
[1:27:13] man preaches an entire sermon into whom
[1:27:15] shall we go and then in the middle of
[1:27:18] that sermon he said if you want
[1:27:19] translation who are you going to go to
[1:27:22] for it
[1:27:24] he said what doctor can prescribe you
[1:27:26] appeal to translate you from the
[1:27:29] Tabernacle of humiliation to
[1:27:30] glorification what what scientists could
[1:27:33] give you something that could take you
[1:27:35] from humiliation to glorification so
[1:27:37] he's saying who is it
[1:27:39] that you could go to that could give you
[1:27:41] this kind of change this is what we're
[1:27:43] looking for and there's only one that
[1:27:45] can change us that is our Lord Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ to whom we look for in the
[1:27:50] Ephesian Church age brother Adam tells
[1:27:52] us this he tells us of how that our lord
[1:27:55] Jesus can I just preach to you a moment
[1:27:56] here instead of Amen our lord Jesus now
[1:27:59] if you're if you're a believer in the
[1:28:01] Bible our Lord he is the Lord Of Glory
[1:28:04] he was the creator of heavens and earth
[1:28:05] he lived lived in a glorified condition
[1:28:08] our lord Jesus when he was upon the
[1:28:11] Earth said father glorify me with the
[1:28:13] glory I have with you before the world
[1:28:15] began so brother Madam tells the story
[1:28:17] of how the great king of Heaven laid
[1:28:19] aside his robes and came down to be more
[1:28:23] to man you remember the story he tells
[1:28:26] us how that he lays aside to come down
[1:28:29] so let me just say this the God of all
[1:28:32] glory came down to be humiliated in
[1:28:35] humanity showing us that glorified one
[1:28:39] that powerful king of all kings came
[1:28:42] down into a tabernacle of humiliation
[1:28:45] you could call it a pest house you could
[1:28:47] call it this wicked place this evil time
[1:28:49] this evil he and the Bible said and he
[1:28:53] took upon himself sin as a lot of people
[1:28:55] would like to think amen they would like
[1:28:57] to think of this God man in such a way
[1:29:00] that he was God and had no feelings and
[1:29:02] he didn't go through struggles and
[1:29:04] didn't go through problems but that's
[1:29:06] contrary to scriptures the scripture
[1:29:08] said that when Jesus came into the Earth
[1:29:10] he came lower than the angels
[1:29:14] he said preacher what does that mean it
[1:29:16] means an angel has never felt pain an
[1:29:19] angel has never felt Temptations in such
[1:29:22] as a human level he never felt that
[1:29:24] Humanity like that but our lord Jesus
[1:29:27] bypassed the Angelic situation and he
[1:29:30] came to be a Seed of Abraham and the
[1:29:34] Bible said that he may be able to be
[1:29:36] tempted in every like manner that we're
[1:29:38] tempted that he should secure our
[1:29:40] Temptations in other words he became us
[1:29:44] to feel our feelings to feel our
[1:29:46] Temptations to understand our needs to
[1:29:49] understand our desires and listen I
[1:29:52] believe Jesus was God but he took on
[1:29:54] himself Humanity that he might teach us
[1:29:57] that God can live in humiliation that
[1:30:01] God could live in a humiliated State he
[1:30:04] could oh I'll tell you he didn't just
[1:30:06] come to a certain point and say that's
[1:30:08] as far as I'm going with this he brought
[1:30:10] himself so long that he was a football's
[1:30:13] funky he had the worship name in town he
[1:30:16] was born and raised under lies and
[1:30:19] called illegitimate and a bastard-born
[1:30:22] child he was a reject from the Nations
[1:30:24] he was eject from the people he brought
[1:30:26] a humiliation upon himself and brother
[1:30:29] if that wasn't far enough he stood still
[1:30:31] and let them accuse him of making him
[1:30:34] something he wasn't they let they said
[1:30:37] you were accusing you that you call
[1:30:39] yourself God Amen you've made of
[1:30:41] yourself something you've lifted
[1:30:43] yourself up which is the worst thing
[1:30:45] amen that a man could do because of
[1:30:47] course that's a that's the act of Satan
[1:30:49] right to lift himself to the position of
[1:30:51] God they took the god of glory and
[1:30:54] calling the devil they took the God of
[1:30:57] all creation and called him Biel shabub
[1:30:59] because he was God living in the flesh
[1:31:03] as an example of the Church of the
[1:31:05] Living God but his children would also
[1:31:09] be God people and they would live in
[1:31:11] this Tabernacle of humiliation
[1:31:17] he went before us he came into this
[1:31:19] flesh and he lived in this Humanity with
[1:31:22] every Temptation I I tell you I don't
[1:31:24] want to get too graphic here but listen
[1:31:26] young men young women amen our Lord knew
[1:31:29] the desire and temptation of lust
[1:31:31] don't you don't you put him off there
[1:31:34] like he didn't know what you're going
[1:31:35] through he felt the Temptation he felt
[1:31:38] the burning in his flesh but he
[1:31:40] conquered it and overcame it because he
[1:31:43] had to be an example to another seed
[1:31:45] that is coming after him that would be
[1:31:48] like him and they would kill the pull
[1:31:50] they would feel the pull in the world
[1:31:51] they would feel the Temptations of this
[1:31:53] life he was tempted by cigarettes he was
[1:31:56] tempted by alcohol he was tempted by
[1:31:58] lust he could have had a family he was
[1:32:01] not that kind of God man his flesh was
[1:32:04] all flesh
[1:32:07] [Music]
[1:32:09] amen now you said preacher hey man
[1:32:11] you're getting a little far here the
[1:32:12] prophet of God said in the Garden of
[1:32:14] Gethsemane he said the spirit of God
[1:32:16] left him
[1:32:18] and he walked to Calvary as a man he
[1:32:21] didn't walk with the spirit of God
[1:32:23] holding him up in his time of
[1:32:25] desperation brother I'll tell you what
[1:32:27] he did he turned loose of the dove
[1:32:30] nature and as a lamb he was led to a
[1:32:33] Slaughter and he never opened his mouth
[1:32:35] hey man I I don't have time to preach
[1:32:37] this morning but I say this what a
[1:32:39] powerful God I serve what a powerful
[1:32:42] Lord Jesus Christ that he could take the
[1:32:44] accusations and never open his mouth he
[1:32:47] can let him say
[1:32:48] hey and oh my brother you talk about a
[1:32:51] mighty conqueror I I I'd love to just
[1:32:53] preach sometimes upon it but I'll tell
[1:32:55] you it wasn't it wasn't the piercing of
[1:32:57] his hands and the piercing of his side
[1:32:58] that made him a mighty conqueror what
[1:33:00] made him a mighty conquerors he faced
[1:33:02] the Flesh and he overcame it with power
[1:33:05] and manifestation listen he didn't do it
[1:33:08] as a God he done it as a human being
[1:33:10] just like you felt the feelings felt the
[1:33:13] pressures felt the problems amen I I
[1:33:16] have to sometimes I just sit down I get
[1:33:18] to thinking about it it's about more I
[1:33:20] can think it's about more than I can
[1:33:21] think about that my lovely Lord Jesus
[1:33:23] came into this flesh and wouldn't take
[1:33:26] up for himself but he gave himself for
[1:33:29] me and became me and the prophet of God
[1:33:32] said he seen the vision water from the
[1:33:34] rock 55 while he was preaching he said I
[1:33:37] seen Adam and Eve coming out of that
[1:33:38] garden and he said I seen God's swing a
[1:33:41] bloody lambskin around him he said now
[1:33:43] the vision has changed and I see Jesus
[1:33:45] walking up his heel I see blood spots
[1:33:48] getting to come out on his robe I hear
[1:33:51] the clicking of the Cross he was
[1:33:52] preaching a vision showing that the
[1:33:55] cowrish cross would be the way the bride
[1:33:58] would go back into Eden they came out
[1:34:01] under blood of skins but they would go
[1:34:03] back under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:34:06] they came out in the shame but they'll
[1:34:08] go home and they glorified condition o
[1:34:11] Church of the Living God goes that
[1:34:13] morning when Adam and Eve had to leave
[1:34:15] the garden can you imagine the shame
[1:34:16] brother
[1:34:18] The Shame of the Angels The Shame of the
[1:34:21] world seeing what they've done seeing
[1:34:22] how they acted
[1:34:24] shame was upon them and they came out of
[1:34:27] there under shame they only covered
[1:34:28] their shame was God have mercy and put a
[1:34:31] skin around them
[1:34:34] now
[1:34:37] Adam
[1:34:38] became close he was a naked man and
[1:34:40] became clothed by a skin of God to tide
[1:34:44] his shame
[1:34:45] our lord Jesus was stripped of his
[1:34:47] clothes
[1:34:50] this is one of those areas that just the
[1:34:51] brother's name and tear my heart out our
[1:34:54] lovely Lord Jesus the king of all Kings
[1:34:57] was stripped naked before the people
[1:35:02] that the shame that you and I face
[1:35:06] would be placed upon him
[1:35:08] that he would literally bear our shame
[1:35:10] to the cross of Calvary that he would
[1:35:13] that he would go as an exposed human
[1:35:15] being nothing covering his flesh nothing
[1:35:18] covered he was he was a I don't know how
[1:35:21] to say it he was a nude man
[1:35:23] but he wasn't nude in the way of of a
[1:35:26] bodybuilder that would that would
[1:35:28] impress the whole world he was nude in a
[1:35:30] way that what drifted off of him was the
[1:35:32] blood of the mockery and the beatings of
[1:35:35] taking our accusations and not speaking
[1:35:37] up he took a beating for you and me he
[1:35:40] took a beaten in his back until every
[1:35:42] bit of his body had been crisscrossed
[1:35:45] with a cat of nine tails that the blood
[1:35:47] was shrieking down his back mockery spit
[1:35:50] was upon his face crowns of thorns was
[1:35:52] upon his head and they were mocking the
[1:35:54] lovely Lord Jesus as he walked down
[1:35:57] there pulling his own cross under the
[1:35:59] shame and the mockery of mankind but
[1:36:02] brother let me tell you something he
[1:36:03] didn't stop in the middle of the way he
[1:36:05] didn't get in part way and say hey never
[1:36:07] mind you know what he did he carried the
[1:36:10] cross all the way because he knew there
[1:36:12] was a church coming that wasn't going to
[1:36:14] stop halfway he knew there was a bride
[1:36:17] coming and wasn't going to stop halfway
[1:36:19] and we don't have to stop halfway
[1:36:26] he pulled that he pulled that cross
[1:36:28] brother Samuel the cross never gets old
[1:36:30] to me
[1:36:31] he pulled that he pulled that cross and
[1:36:34] he got there to where they they put him
[1:36:35] on the cross now here's the power of
[1:36:37] this church when he lifted his hands and
[1:36:40] they pierced his side
[1:36:42] the prophet tells us that the blood from
[1:36:45] his side
[1:36:46] ran down like this
[1:36:48] and the blood from his back ran together
[1:36:51] at the hip and when it run down his leg
[1:36:54] he said Divine Healing and salvation ran
[1:36:58] together and when it dropped upon the
[1:37:00] ground it was a complete Covenant your
[1:37:02] healing and your salvation was through
[1:37:05] the blood of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:37:08] preacher what are you talking about
[1:37:09] remember his hands are up well let's go
[1:37:11] back in the scripture to Moses when
[1:37:13] Moses his hands were lifted the people
[1:37:15] were in Victory when Moses his hands
[1:37:17] were down the people were in defeat
[1:37:19] brother Brown said God supplied two men
[1:37:21] to hold up Moses's hands so the people
[1:37:24] would see Victory he said but when Jesus
[1:37:26] Christ came the greater Moses he said
[1:37:29] God put him on the cross and nailed his
[1:37:32] hands up so they could never come down
[1:37:34] that whenever a man looks at Calvary all
[1:37:37] he can see is Victory all he can see is
[1:37:40] the blood all he can see is the grace of
[1:37:42] God I say lift up your head bride that's
[1:37:45] a victory in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:49] Hallelujah there's no sin against this
[1:37:51] bride he took my sin he took my shame
[1:37:56] you know you know what the prophet
[1:37:58] taught you all taught well brother
[1:37:59] Brandon called us and when you when
[1:38:01] you're seeking the Holy Ghost anybody in
[1:38:03] here seeking the Holy Ghost today you're
[1:38:04] seeking that place with god brother man
[1:38:06] said what you got to do he said listen
[1:38:08] you're not going to get it out of this
[1:38:09] altar come on now I believe in prayer
[1:38:12] until y'all know me I'm I'mma Acts 2 38
[1:38:14] tongue talking Holy Ghost rolling
[1:38:15] preacher I believe in the whole thing
[1:38:17] but you'll never get salvation out of an
[1:38:19] altar you won't get the Holy Ghost out
[1:38:21] of an altar it's a good place to find it
[1:38:23] but you won't get it there where you get
[1:38:25] it is in the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:38:28] Christ and you can pray and you can fast
[1:38:31] and you can do anything you want but at
[1:38:33] some points you've got to confess what
[1:38:36] Jesus did for you and the power of that
[1:38:39] blood comes back into a Believer and
[1:38:41] sanctions Alive by the baptism of the
[1:38:44] Holy Ghost I'm talking about the blood
[1:38:47] of Jesus Christ that saves the man that
[1:38:51] sanctifies a man and fills a man with
[1:38:53] the Holy Ghost there is nothing like the
[1:38:56] blood and
[1:38:57] oh the blood of Jesus
[1:39:02] the blood of Jesus Mary a man ever came
[1:39:05] to the blood was disappointed by his
[1:39:07] finding in it shall find healing in it

[1:39:31] that you'll have a place to bring the
[1:39:32] devil back to
[1:39:34] wherever you are in the world 20 years

[1:39:40] Holy Ghost you'll say oh wait a minute
[1:39:41] devil back there in the rain on the
[1:39:44] third Pew back late one night I was
[1:39:46] praying for the Holy Ghost and I took a
[1:39:48] steak out of my bag and I drove that
[1:39:51] steak down and devil if you want me to I
[1:39:53] can go up there and lead you to the
[1:39:55] place tonight because the power of them
[1:39:58] something that is able to change that I
[1:39:59] still have sound it's the power of the
[1:40:01] blood it's still able to change it now
[1:40:04] what am I talking about I'm talking
[1:40:05] about the blood the driving of the stake
[1:40:07] and our God took his own advice and he
[1:40:12] drove a stake that day at Calvary and he
[1:40:15] said from this day on right here at this
[1:40:19] place his sin has been defeated Devils
[1:40:22] have been defeated the Church of the
[1:40:24] Living God
[1:40:27] of Jesus Christ devils are defeated the
[1:40:31] wild is defeated there is nothing like
[1:40:34] the blood
[1:40:37] drive your stake this morning listen
[1:40:39] look at God and look at the statement he
[1:40:42] drove for your care for your life
[1:40:45] except for the Wayne I don't know we
[1:40:47] might have to go through the tribulation
[1:40:49] not if you'll accept this blood if you
[1:40:51] will accept this Blood amen nothing you
[1:40:54] don't expect nothing but a body change
[1:40:57] God does not have a reason
[1:41:00] to humiliate you
[1:41:02] he has humiliated himself to show you he
[1:41:06] can take the humiliated and bring it to
[1:41:09] a glorification he took the most
[1:41:11] humiliated State a man could be in and
[1:41:14] he glorified that body and said this is
[1:41:17] the power that I have to change I can
[1:41:19] take it from humiliation and to bring it
[1:41:22] to glorification that's not a sin of one
[1:41:24] sitting in here this morning that you
[1:41:26] don't know what I'm talking about not
[1:41:28] one of you don't know that you were in a
[1:41:30] state of humiliation you were living for
[1:41:32] the world laying out somewhere in a bar
[1:41:34] room maybe drinking or whatever have you
[1:41:36] but the God who is rich in Mercy came
[1:41:39] into your humiliated life
[1:41:43] and change you
[1:41:48] changed you I think the battery just
[1:41:50] went bad bro
[1:41:52] do you see what it is it was from a
[1:41:54] degraded state
[1:41:57] from a humiliated state
[1:42:01] to be brought into the glorification of
[1:42:03] God
[1:42:04] that's exactly
[1:42:06] what God's going to do with you
[1:42:10] he's not going to do it through
[1:42:11] tribulation
[1:42:12] and he's not going to do it through
[1:42:13] persecution he's going to do it through
[1:42:15] that blood
[1:42:16] and that blood is going to redeem this
[1:42:18] church this blood's going to go home in
[1:42:21] glory through the power of the blood
[1:42:23] that's the way she goes it's through the
[1:42:25] power of the blood
[1:42:28] now I know things I know things are
[1:42:31] are looking a certain way
[1:42:34] and All the Troubles is everywhere
[1:42:37] but the prophet of God said when this
[1:42:38] happens he said we need to look up
[1:42:41] for we have a conversation in heaven we
[1:42:45] have our conversation in heaven you said
[1:42:46] brother Wayne what is our conversation
[1:42:48] brother Brandon said our conversation he
[1:42:51] said it's uh it's it's our language
[1:42:54] you know uh if you if you studied this
[1:42:57] particular spot our our conversation in
[1:43:00] heaven
[1:43:01] other translations replace conversation
[1:43:03] with citizenship
[1:43:05] because it actually knows a Believer is
[1:43:07] already a citizen of Heaven
[1:43:12] now if America was about to bomb
[1:43:14] somewhere do you know the first thing
[1:43:16] they do they get all the citizens out
[1:43:18] that's right
[1:43:20] you're a citizen of the kingdom of God
[1:43:24] and before God allows Russia to bomb
[1:43:28] this nation
[1:43:29] you ambassadors come home
[1:43:32] citizens come home he sins he sends
[1:43:35] flights that are specific for the
[1:43:37] carrying out of that citizen it's not
[1:43:40] for all that Nation it's not for all
[1:43:42] them people it's for the citizens and
[1:43:44] the employees of that nation and God has
[1:43:47] got a nation it's a Heavenly nation and
[1:43:50] we are ambassadors of that nation and we
[1:43:53] speak the language of that Nation
[1:43:57] amen now the prophet of God said you see
[1:43:59] if you speak that language he said
[1:44:02] he said what you got to do is remember
[1:44:04] the devil has a language and God has a
[1:44:07] language don't you be speaking the
[1:44:08] devil's language
[1:44:10] he said what's what's the devil's
[1:44:11] language well I'm weak my faith is not
[1:44:13] very much I'm not a very good Christian
[1:44:15] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:44:18] say
[1:44:19] you're just talking his language
[1:44:24] listen you're
[1:44:25] you're a citizen of another Nation you
[1:44:28] have a different language right
[1:44:31] the Africans speak French the
[1:44:33] conqueror's language
[1:44:35] the African speaks Portuguese it's the
[1:44:37] conquerors language
[1:44:39] the bride speaks Faith it's the
[1:44:43] conquerors language
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:46] as you first become a Christian you
[1:44:48] start learning to talk early what what
[1:44:51] language you're taught is faith and as
[1:44:54] you grow the faith language is
[1:44:56] articulated it's developed it's
[1:44:58] sharpened it's anointed and after a
[1:45:01] while you speak fluently and perfectly
[1:45:04] the language of Faith the Bride of Jesus
[1:45:07] Christ I just go I'll just go into
[1:45:09] educational for you the Bride of Jesus
[1:45:12] Christ has a doctorate degree in the
[1:45:14] language of faith
[1:45:16] we speak Heavenly language before we
[1:45:20] ever leave the Earth
[1:45:22] it's a perfect Faith the church has come
[1:45:24] to the changing
[1:45:27] of this vile body listen
[1:45:29] when you look at this word we look for
[1:45:32] our savior the Lord Jesus Christ you can
[1:45:35] look that word up it actually means to
[1:45:38] expect fully
[1:45:42] we expect fully the coming of our Lord
[1:45:45] Jesus Christ and expectation has got to
[1:45:48] be built upon the word
[1:45:50] listen based upon the word of God all
[1:45:53] Christianity is based upon the faith in
[1:45:55] the word so what you have faith in the
[1:45:57] word is your expectation so if you're
[1:46:00] hearing the word you're getting an
[1:46:02] expectation now listen folks the word of
[1:46:04] God is a seed
[1:46:08] the message of the hour is the word seed
[1:46:12] of your day
[1:46:15] the message is the shout
[1:46:19] which is the beginning of the Rapture
[1:46:22] phase that God puts the church in he
[1:46:25] said brother Wayne I want to go on the
[1:46:26] Rapture how do I go in the Rapture put
[1:46:29] the word of faith in your heart and the
[1:46:32] prophet of God said it'll grow and
[1:46:35] manifest whatever seed it is if you take
[1:46:38] the seed of rapture you will manifest
[1:46:40] Rapture if you place Rapture in your
[1:46:43] heart you're going to manifest Rapture
[1:46:45] because the gospel seed has been placed
[1:46:48] into your heart and it'll make you walk
[1:46:50] now listen friends that was a time
[1:46:53] that was a time that these things were
[1:46:56] not available like this
[1:46:58] but things have changed
[1:47:01] things have changed
[1:47:03] I I'm reminded of a service where
[1:47:06] brother Brandon was preaching and he
[1:47:08] gets to see in a vision two two great
[1:47:10] miracles happen at the same time he sees
[1:47:12] a vision he starts talking about a young
[1:47:14] girl he said I see a young young black
[1:47:17] girl he said I see her she's in surgery
[1:47:18] and he describes the doctor that's doing
[1:47:21] the surgery
[1:47:22] he said the surgery is on the throat but
[1:47:24] it's paralyzed the child
[1:47:26] and he starts describing it and the
[1:47:28] mother of the child they're there in the
[1:47:30] meeting and the mother child starts
[1:47:32] screaming and she comes up brother Brown
[1:47:34] she said that's my baby brother random
[1:47:36] that's my baby and he said I see sister
[1:47:39] she said well brother random does that
[1:47:41] mean that the baby can walk now
[1:47:45] and brother bam looked at her and she
[1:47:46] said honey she said I don't know he said
[1:47:48] I just told you what was wrong with the
[1:47:49] child
[1:47:50] he said what you need to do is to pray
[1:47:52] you just stand here and pray and ask God
[1:47:54] he said and I turned around to go back
[1:47:56] into the prayer line he said and when I
[1:47:58] did the mother was praying he said
[1:48:01] another Vision struck and he said I was
[1:48:03] looking at a dark Street and he said I
[1:48:06] seen a little girl I believe she had a
[1:48:07] baby doll didn't you and she'd come
[1:48:09] running down the side street he said
[1:48:11] that I seen her run across the street
[1:48:13] and pick up the doll I think it's the
[1:48:15] way the vision went and he said there it
[1:48:17] is he said there it is he said she can
[1:48:20] walk that's thus saith the Lord
[1:48:23] the lady said you mean she can walk he
[1:48:27] said she can now
[1:48:30] five minutes ago she couldn't
[1:48:34] but she can now
[1:48:36] because a Prophet by Vision opened up
[1:48:39] away
[1:48:41] the minute he said that Congressman
[1:48:43] Upshaw was sitting in the back of the
[1:48:45] building
[1:48:46] he said I see a great man he's wearing a
[1:48:49] brown colored suit I've seen him fall as
[1:48:51] a child laying on the bed and starts
[1:48:53] describing the congressman and the
[1:48:55] congressman says somebody says to
[1:48:57] brother Bradham that's Congressman
[1:48:58] Upshaw he's sitting in the back man been
[1:49:00] paralyzed for 66 years y'all remember
[1:49:02] the story the man stands up they take a
[1:49:04] cord back there and brother Brandon says
[1:49:06] is that you is that your he said yes
[1:49:07] brother Bradham that's me I said I've
[1:49:09] been searching for Healing For Years
[1:49:10] brother bam turned and he saw another
[1:49:13] vision and he said sir he said do you
[1:49:15] have I think it's a blue pinstripe or
[1:49:18] something of that I think it's a blue
[1:49:20] he's wearing a brown so he said you own
[1:49:22] a blue colored pinstripe suit the man
[1:49:25] said I bought it today brother Branham
[1:49:29] he said thus saith the Lord I will meet
[1:49:32] you wearing that suit in a few days
[1:49:34] you'll walk again
[1:49:37] till that day
[1:49:39] it was not possible to walk like that he
[1:49:42] didn't even own the suit he was going to
[1:49:44] walk in
[1:49:45] but he bought the suit on the right day
[1:49:47] and a prophet anointed spoke a word that
[1:49:51] opened up a way for him to walk like he
[1:49:54] never walked before what am I saying to
[1:49:56] you today I'm saying that you may not it
[1:49:58] may have been a time in your life you
[1:50:00] may be sitting here this morning and
[1:50:02] things have been a certain way and
[1:50:04] you've not been walking for the Lord
[1:50:05] You've not had things like you needed
[1:50:07] them and you say someday I'd like to but
[1:50:10] God opens up the door he opens up a way
[1:50:13] and all of a sudden there's a way made
[1:50:15] and you can walk like you've never
[1:50:17] walked before
[1:50:19] a church you said what's that matter
[1:50:20] because this bride is an Enoch type and
[1:50:23] she's going to walk with God until she's
[1:50:26] not I think it's time for the bride to
[1:50:28] start walking
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:34] these are not fables folks
[1:50:37] I I told Brian I didn't have time to get
[1:50:39] into all these things today so I'm not
[1:50:41] going to touch this but I just come
[1:50:43] through a Rapture and I've studied
[1:50:44] strongly on Enoch's pyramid
[1:50:47] if you study Enoch's pyramid and you
[1:50:49] take what brother Brandon said about it
[1:50:51] he says if you watch that last great
[1:50:53] step he said there's where we're
[1:50:56] standing today
[1:50:57] we're the one would introduce
[1:51:00] the comer the worshiper
[1:51:03] it would introduce It To The King
[1:51:05] brother Brian when they discovered
[1:51:07] Enoch's pyramid they were looking for
[1:51:09] Treasures
[1:51:10] for gold for silver
[1:51:12] they didn't find it in Enoch's pyramid
[1:51:14] that's why they say they don't believe
[1:51:16] it was a tomb it was an altar because
[1:51:18] there was no gold really of any value
[1:51:21] found in Enoch's pyramid because the
[1:51:23] treasure that was hid there
[1:51:25] it was not The Treasure of silver and
[1:51:28] gold the treasure that was hid in
[1:51:30] Enoch's pyramid was the mystery of how a
[1:51:33] man could walk from one dimension to
[1:51:36] another and Enoch's changed come when he
[1:51:40] introduced to the king that's where they
[1:51:41] went the Coffer and the way was opened
[1:51:43] now I said that to say this when brother
[1:51:46] Brandon preaches that sermon stature the
[1:51:48] perfect man he shows Enoch's pyramid was
[1:51:51] not capped in his Revelation but in our
[1:51:53] day in our Revelation the pyramid came
[1:51:56] but it was capped and William branham's
[1:51:58] pyramid was the Statue of a perfect man
[1:52:00] and he put the Capstone on the church
[1:52:03] somebody said what does that matter
[1:52:04] because if you're reading II Peter
[1:52:07] he said that let us add remember let us
[1:52:10] add let us add until we get to love
[1:52:12] right he said then there'll be an
[1:52:14] entrance preached unto you amen
[1:52:18] amen there'll be an entrance at the time
[1:52:20] of Love there'll be an entrance preached
[1:52:22] under the Everlasting Kingdom you see
[1:52:25] First Corinthians 13 Love's going to
[1:52:27] come he said what's going to happen then
[1:52:29] you'll be known as you were known you're
[1:52:32] going to know as you were known what
[1:52:35] about in First John 3 when he said what
[1:52:37] kind of love is this the father bestowed
[1:52:38] upon us to be called as sons of God it
[1:52:41] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[1:52:43] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:52:45] him as he is at the time of perfect love
[1:52:48] again there is an opening that teaches
[1:52:51] us what we were before and how we can
[1:52:54] walk back he said brother Wayne what are
[1:52:55] you talking about I'm talking about the
[1:52:57] message of William Branham has opened a
[1:52:59] way for you to walk with God in such a
[1:53:02] way
[1:53:03] amen yes sir you uh just just in closing
[1:53:08] uh if your musicians would come I was
[1:53:11] just I was just out at um at uh with
[1:53:14] brother Doug Baker a couple years ago he
[1:53:16] took me to Sabino Canyon how many have
[1:53:18] you been to Sabino
[1:53:19] I'd love to show you the pictures maybe
[1:53:21] we'll do it someday but uh brother Perry
[1:53:23] has him on his website out there in
[1:53:25] Tucson
[1:53:29] but in wings of a snow white dove
[1:53:31] brother Brown tells a story
[1:53:33] about how he was out in Sabino Canyon
[1:53:35] and he come up and he said I walked up
[1:53:38] to a rock
[1:53:39] and he said I've been you remember he'd
[1:53:41] been praying and about his ministering
[1:53:43] things he said he walked up to a rock
[1:53:44] and how many ever seen the picture he
[1:53:46] walks up to a rock and he said I laid up
[1:53:47] against The Rock and the Lord said
[1:53:49] what's that under your heart
[1:53:51] remember when he said what's that under
[1:53:52] your heart he said I stepped back and
[1:53:54] looked and in the stone was written
[1:53:57] White Eagle
[1:53:59] it's the word Eagle written in the
[1:54:02] English language
[1:54:04] but it's white Court
[1:54:06] and now think about this
[1:54:09] if you see the picture of Perry green
[1:54:11] it'll strike Perry green about right
[1:54:12] here
[1:54:14] but when the prophet stood there
[1:54:17] it was right at his heart
[1:54:22] now if you took it if you look at a
[1:54:23] picture of that it actually is the
[1:54:25] pyramid it's powerful it's actually the
[1:54:27] pyramid the Top of the Rock is a pyramid
[1:54:30] and one side of it's flat well when we
[1:54:32] went there with brother Doug we walked
[1:54:33] up and he said well Wayne you notice
[1:54:35] anything odd about this spot
[1:54:38] I said I do brother duck he said what is
[1:54:40] it I said somebody has drilled
[1:54:42] and shot the rock here
[1:54:44] he said how do you know that I said well
[1:54:46] I used to work construction we did a lot
[1:54:47] of pre-splits we rock drilled put
[1:54:49] dynamite in it blew it off and there's a
[1:54:51] little and next time you're at a
[1:54:53] restaurant where there's a rock wall
[1:54:54] look at that rock wall you'll see little
[1:54:56] strips and you'll remember oh those are
[1:54:59] drill marks
[1:55:00] if you ever see them you know what they
[1:55:02] are so I sing them drill marks and I
[1:55:04] said somebody has dynamited uh dominated
[1:55:07] right here he said that's right he said
[1:55:09] the other half of this rock is laying
[1:55:11] down there
[1:55:12] and if you're if you're walking next to
[1:55:14] Eagle Rock it's bigger than the spot
[1:55:16] right here
[1:55:17] but not much like if it's maybe a three
[1:55:20] foot spot where you could walk by eagle
[1:55:22] rocks to your left and it's a slope like
[1:55:24] this so at some point
[1:55:27] someone split this huge Rock in half
[1:55:29] with dynamite and the other half's
[1:55:31] laying down there
[1:55:32] that eagle
[1:55:34] that white quartz
[1:55:36] was in that rock
[1:55:38] and when they blew it apart it exposed
[1:55:41] it having been in there since God
[1:55:43] created The Rock
[1:55:46] so being the guy I am you know
[1:55:48] I go home and I start studying Sabino
[1:55:51] Canyon
[1:55:53] the trails in that Canyon were built in
[1:55:56] 1933
[1:56:00] the same time
[1:56:02] the angel of the Lord came to William
[1:56:04] Branham in Ohio River
[1:56:06] they was out there dynamite in that rock
[1:56:10] and they were opening up that Granite
[1:56:12] Stone of pyramid and inside of the
[1:56:15] inside was written White Eagle
[1:56:18] look folks a four inch spot
[1:56:21] four inch spot how big is this world
[1:56:25] how big is the circumference of this
[1:56:27] world
[1:56:28] William Branham would put his heart
[1:56:31] over a spot that's that big out of every
[1:56:35] Rock in every canyon in the world
[1:56:39] and he would put his heart over that
[1:56:40] that was not available
[1:56:43] until 1933.
[1:56:48] you couldn't walk like this
[1:56:50] until this Vision came
[1:56:53] you couldn't walk the trail you're
[1:56:55] walking this morning somebody says to me
[1:56:57] so well brother Wayne the historians
[1:56:59] teach it a certain way they did that
[1:57:00] because it wasn't available
[1:57:02] if you talk to a man from the mid-1800s
[1:57:05] and you were talking to him and said hey
[1:57:07] I come up down the Sabino the other day
[1:57:09] and I walked right down this certain
[1:57:10] Trail he'd go there ain't no Trail in
[1:57:12] there
[1:57:13] no Trail in there how there's a big rock
[1:57:15] laying across that you've got to go down
[1:57:17] the hill or way up the hill there's no
[1:57:19] Trail through there there is now
[1:57:23] people said well brother Wayne we need
[1:57:25] this to have a rapture we need this to
[1:57:27] have a rapture
