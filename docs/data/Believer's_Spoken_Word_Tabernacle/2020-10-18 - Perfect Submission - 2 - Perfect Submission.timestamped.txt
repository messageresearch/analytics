[0:00] here is not for us to presume things
[0:05] the program of god is not guessing
[0:12] it's not saying well i feel led and then
[0:14] what you feel led is contrary to the
[0:16] word
[0:19] you might have felt led but it wasn't
[0:20] the holy ghost leader right
[0:22] right you see it comes it comes into a
[0:25] place that god's desire
[0:26] is that we would walk not without
[0:29] understanding
[0:30] but that we would walk with
[0:31] understanding let me just be very clear
[0:33] understanding doesn't mean that you've
[0:35] got everything together
[0:37] that you're a man i've got it all put
[0:39] together let me just go ahead and tell
[0:40] you
[0:41] brother branham would stand there and
[0:42] preach christ the mystery he said i'm
[0:44] sure we don't see it
[0:45] as we ought to see it he said i don't
[0:47] see it as i'd ought to see it you say
[0:49] well then
[0:50] how do i see it more clearly walk in the
[0:53] line you've got to keep walking
[0:57] in the light amen amen
[1:02] so the kingdom of god i know these are
[1:05] very simple but just something i'm
[1:08] building to here
[1:10] the kingdom of god is not natural
[1:15] it's spiritual amen
[1:18] it's not of this world
[1:22] the world itself the deformity and the
[1:26] conformity of all this
[1:28] all the parts that remember that came
[1:30] forth
[1:31] between satan and eve when he
[1:34] sold doubt and unbelief
[1:38] against the word of god and she opened
[1:41] her mind to that
[1:42] and received it and look what it
[1:44] produced
[1:46] it produced a cane who could stand right
[1:49] in the face of god
[1:50] and god offering mercy but he would spit
[1:53] it right back in god's face
[1:56] but then they're coming able see after
[1:58] now the fall has come
[2:00] here come abel and you see with abel
[2:03] here look at the humility god reveals to
[2:07] him
[2:08] bring a lamb to offer up a lamb i wonder
[2:11] was able was it something that the whole
[2:14] time
[2:15] that he was raising this lamb or the
[2:17] birth came
[2:18] and he knew all along or was it
[2:20] something that it was moving in his
[2:22] heart because the bible says
[2:23] in the process of time those boys came
[2:26] to worship
[2:27] it was something that was a longing that
[2:29] abel didn't put in his heart
[2:32] he could look around no doubt and see
[2:34] what cain was doing
[2:35] cain was cultivating all the fruits and
[2:38] man
[2:38] he had everything just right oh it was
[2:41] nice fruits he could quote that chapter
[2:43] knew the chapter after it could quote
[2:46] that verse he knew the books of the
[2:48] bible
[2:48] forward and back and you're not able no
[2:50] doubt looking at it and saying
[2:52] my my mind i can't even do anything like
[2:55] that
[2:56] oh i wonder what it is that god requires
[2:58] who
[2:59] put that in able to long for that
[3:02] it was god that put that in able amen
[3:06] and there's only one that can answer
[3:08] that call
[3:09] there could be a lot of men and a lot of
[3:11] people that can come by the way
[3:14] but there's only one that can give that
[3:16] answer
[3:17] to what's calling for that deep
[3:19] parliamentary thing
[3:20] and that's the god who put it in you
[3:25] thank you hallelujah
[3:29] god put it there and god revealed to
[3:32] abel
[3:32] when abel walked there it wasn't that he
[3:35] walked there with a complete
[3:37] understanding and everything all put
[3:38] together but this is what he had
[3:40] understanding is
[3:41] god has revealed this it was blood
[3:45] that took us out there was so much that
[3:47] god had revealed
[3:48] god had revealed this is the acceptable
[3:51] way
[3:53] he got there and he offered it up and
[3:56] here came down a witness
[3:58] that he was righteous
[4:05] you see it's something that moves within
[4:07] abel as it moves within a heart
[4:10] that a heart can't be settled but just
[4:13] church
[4:17] you can't just be settled with religion
[4:20] right let me just be very clear with you
[4:22] you can treat this message like it's
[4:24] religion
[4:25] but it'll never be any good that's right
[4:28] this message is not religion
[4:30] this message is the revealing of the
[4:32] person of jesus christ
[4:38] this is why jesus would say except
[4:42] a man be born again he cannot see
[4:45] the kingdom of god he can't he can't
[4:47] even understand it
[4:48] now think of how it takes god coming
[4:51] down
[4:52] by the new birth to open our spiritual
[4:56] eyes
[4:57] yes you pass right through us
[5:02] it could pass right through and one
[5:04] person can
[5:05] look there could be people who would sit
[5:06] here or sitting here
[5:08] would look and say pretty good service
[5:11] man it doesn't have an effect right
[5:15] but then sitting within the same service
[5:18] in the presence of god
[5:20] there's another life that's affected
[5:22] right
[5:24] it's things that it isn't all together
[5:25] they can explain but their life
[5:27] has been affected they recognize there's
[5:30] something beyond
[5:32] words that's being spoken here but god
[5:35] is speaking to my heart here you are in
[5:37] a congregation
[5:38] of i don't know how many are here but
[5:39] yet god himself comes in such a manner
[5:42] to where it's like it's only you and him
[5:44] that's in this building you know why
[5:47] because that's his desire for your life
[5:49] that it's only you
[5:51] and him amen
[5:54] hallelujah that's why he comes that
[5:56] personal he comes that person will let
[5:58] you know
[5:59] that he loves you
[6:04] you think of how as we look at this and
[6:08] paul
[6:09] would express this even in first
[6:11] corinthians two
[6:13] and paul would talk about here was a man
[6:17] that was so that was gifted in so many
[6:21] languages
[6:22] this man was gifted and we're talking
[6:26] about a man now
[6:27] he's already he's already received a new
[6:30] birth
[6:31] he's already his eyes are open right
[6:35] but look what the mind of christ in him
[6:37] did before he even steps up to minister
[6:40] he says i was with you in weakness
[6:43] trembling in
[6:47] he fear it be known i'm not coming to
[6:49] you with enticing words
[6:51] of man's wisdom
[6:54] but it was to come the preaching was to
[6:57] come and it came
[6:58] by power and demonstration that the
[7:01] faith
[7:02] of the people might stand in the living
[7:05] god
[7:08] that's god's desire that's why god comes
[7:11] that's why he speaks so personal
[7:12] it's more than just words you can hear
[7:15] words and it just remains right there
[7:18] but when here it is it's zoned it's
[7:20] concluded
[7:21] that this is christ who's talking to me
[7:23] this is the same one
[7:25] who walked the shores of galilee and
[7:26] he's uncovering your life
[7:28] he's revealing the thoughts in your life
[7:30] a man can't do that
[7:32] that takes almighty god and when he's
[7:35] uncovering you
[7:36] he's not trying to shame you what he's
[7:39] doing he's exposing
[7:40] the devil and that's the time
[7:44] to forsake and run to him amen
[7:50] this is why paul would say we speak
[7:53] wisdom
[7:54] he's talking wisdom wisdom
[7:58] that comes from god james says that
[8:01] wisdom is pure
[8:02] yes it's full of mercy he says we speak
[8:06] wisdom
[8:06] among them that are perfect
[8:09] this is wrote to the corinthian church
[8:15] what perfection is he talking about he's
[8:18] talking about those
[8:19] who have crossed and passed the line the
[8:22] point of no return
[8:24] they have come from the carnal into the
[8:26] spiritual mind
[8:28] they have been born of the spirit of god
[8:30] they have come
[8:31] into the perfection of christ and it is
[8:33] christ's own perfection
[8:35] that is working in their life they are
[8:39] perfect even as our father which is in
[8:41] heaven is perfect
[8:44] so this this wisdom if it is that which
[8:48] is spoken
[8:49] among those that are perfect or those
[8:52] that have
[8:53] come into that of the new birth
[8:57] now notice how paul he would go on to
[9:00] write about this
[9:01] uh because among
[9:05] uh the jews pharisees and so forth
[9:08] here they had everything laid out they
[9:11] had all the scriptures and prophecies
[9:13] these people were not ignorant if i
[9:16] could say it like this
[9:17] they weren't ignorant of the bible even
[9:20] though when the bible then it was
[9:21] scrolls and you understand that
[9:23] they weren't ignorant of that remember
[9:25] when they stood and talked with jesus
[9:27] these men could quote things and they
[9:30] would question him
[9:31] what do you say about this now think of
[9:33] it here is a carnal mind
[9:35] it's looking at the word but here is the
[9:38] spiritual
[9:39] mind of god that there is on display
[9:43] and a carnal mind was looking at the
[9:45] word look what the carnal mind did
[9:47] it had them in bondage it pounded
[9:50] everybody else
[9:51] but the spiritual mind concerning the
[9:53] word came down
[9:54] and it was bringing liberty and freedom
[9:58] because why they needed to be loosed
[10:01] from a carnal mind amen
[10:06] and this is why paul would say they
[10:09] didn't know their day of visitation
[10:11] right and that's why they crucified him
[10:18] you see let me just look at look at
[10:21] god's mercy for a moment here
[10:26] you didn't seek this message out
[10:44] this message would go right over your
[10:47] head it would go right past you or as
[10:49] brother branham put in modern events
[10:51] pass right through you and it's gone but
[10:54] what was it
[10:55] what was it you would have missed if the
[10:58] spirit
[10:59] hadn't come upon you let me tell you
[11:03] john john a prophet of god
[11:06] and god had told him this is what's
[11:08] going to happen
[11:09] you're going to be baptizing down there
[11:11] at the river jordan
[11:12] but john would have missed jesus if it
[11:15] hadn't been for the holy ghost
[11:19] you see he was dependent on the same
[11:22] holy ghost that had filled it from his
[11:25] mother's womb
[11:26] he was depending on him to let him know
[11:30] the junction of the word and where it
[11:32] was at what was he doing he wasn't
[11:34] looking at his carnal mind
[11:36] he was looking to god hallelujah
[11:40] the carnal mind what is the carnal mind
[11:42] brother brandon brings a carnal mind
[11:44] and they would come up to john hey john
[11:46] you know this guy down here
[11:48] you know your dad said he's a real good
[11:49] guy real fine guy
[11:51] you know he he can he can he knows the
[11:53] law and he knows all this you know how
[11:55] brother grandma will dramatize it
[11:56] this guy you know he's a real good guy
[11:58] he's a real that's carnal mind
[12:00] right right hey that carnal mind
[12:04] it went up there in the upper room
[12:08] and there was some guy they got up there
[12:10] under the carnal mind this is when the
[12:12] carnal mind
[12:12] was still dominating them and they
[12:15] wanted to pick
[12:16] somebody to take judas's place carmen
[12:20] man does not pick for god god pits
[12:23] man recognizes god's choice
[12:27] well we can preach a lot on that
[12:28] courtship their marriage on and on and
[12:30] on pastors so forth
[12:31] we can preach on that it's not man
[12:33] picking it's god
[12:36] we want to be alert to the mind of god
[12:39] god's will
[12:42] so the spirit comes upon us so we don't
[12:46] miss seeing it
[12:47] right the same spirit that told simeon
[12:49] you're not going to die
[12:51] until you seen the lord's christ is the
[12:54] same holy spirit
[12:55] that came that day when mary was
[12:57] standing there
[12:58] with with jesus in her arms that same
[13:01] spirit said
[13:04] hallelujah follow me
[13:07] send me a new enough just to follow him
[13:10] and he led him right to the promise
[13:13] it had made known to him
[13:16] now notice in verse nine of first
[13:18] corinthians 2
[13:20] it's written i have not seen nor ear
[13:22] heard
[13:23] neither have entered into the heart of
[13:25] man the things which god
[13:27] hath prepared for them that love him but
[13:30] god
[13:31] hath revealed them unto us by
[13:35] his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[13:38] all things yeah the deep things of god
[13:42] for what man look at this not the things
[13:45] of man
[13:46] save the spirit of man which
[13:49] is in him
[13:52] man can only know man things
[13:57] but when god has come into that life
[14:00] then you're no longer just you know here
[14:03] upon this earth
[14:04] you become a twofold being right you
[14:07] hear upon this earth
[14:09] but you're in contact now into that
[14:12] realm
[14:13] where you as a son and daughter of god
[14:16] in relationship with god
[14:17] and the mind of christ is operating
[14:20] through your life
[14:25] and every time do you get in trouble is
[14:27] when you don't let the mind of christ go
[14:29] to operate
[14:30] that's right
[14:33] well i need to give a piece of my mind
[14:35] that's not the mind of christ
[14:41] that's free even so the things of god
[14:46] knoweth no man but the spirit of god
[14:50] now we have received not the spirit of
[14:52] the world
[14:53] but the spirit which is of god that we
[14:56] might know
[14:57] the things that are freely given to us
[15:01] of god which things also we
[15:04] speak not in the words which man's
[15:06] wisdom teacheth
[15:08] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[15:10] comparing spiritual
[15:12] things with spiritual but the natural
[15:14] man
[15:15] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[15:17] of god for they
[15:18] are foolishness unto him
[15:21] neither can he know them because they
[15:23] are spiritually
[15:25] deserving but he that is spiritual
[15:28] judgeth all things notice spiritual
[15:31] talking about spirit fear
[15:35] discerns what is it that deserves it's
[15:38] that inner man on the inside
[15:40] it's not that you've got the holy ghost
[15:42] and now you're relying on your carnal
[15:44] mind no
[15:45] remember it's not you leading god it's
[15:48] god
[15:49] leading you the spiritual mind
[15:54] is the son and daughter of god that has
[15:56] the right of way
[15:57] in our life it's that which leads you
[16:01] to make choices and decisions
[16:04] that are contrary to the natural mind
[16:08] decisions that others could say why are
[16:10] you doing that
[16:11] that doesn't make sense but the
[16:14] spiritual mind
[16:15] catches the will of god
[16:19] the carnal mind says you've been a
[16:22] member of this church for how long
[16:24] your your grandparents we all were
[16:26] raised this particular way
[16:28] that's the carnal mind but the spiritual
[16:32] mind
[16:33] is what looks beyond god beginning to
[16:36] move
[16:36] and open and understanding he's drawing
[16:39] on that part
[16:40] that he's so on the inside
[16:43] amen
[16:47] he that is spiritual judgeth all things
[16:50] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[16:53] who
[16:54] hath known the mind of the lord that
[16:57] he may instruct him but we have
[17:00] the mind of christ amen
[17:05] it's god directing
[17:08] his body from within amen amen
[17:14] god is directing his body he's directing
[17:17] your life from within it's god that
[17:20] draws a life
[17:21] from within into repentance it's god
[17:25] that draws a life from within
[17:27] do you recognize what's taking place as
[17:29] the spirit of god is dealing with a life
[17:32] it's not necessarily that coming to you
[17:34] it's him leading you out of you
[17:37] it's god leading you out it's god coming
[17:41] out
[17:42] in your life that's what he does
[17:48] so this this the mind of christ
[17:52] operating in our life it's that
[17:56] of the spirit of truth it's god
[17:59] moving remember the scriptures
[18:03] the promise is when the spirit of truth
[18:06] is come
[18:08] he will lead and guide us into all
[18:12] things he'll bring things to our
[18:15] remembrance
[18:17] he will lead and guide us the promise
[18:19] was that
[18:20] he will glorify he'll glorify jesus
[18:23] christ
[18:24] it'll lift him up as the victorious one
[18:27] the mighty conqueror
[18:28] he takes what does the holy ghost do he
[18:31] takes of the word
[18:33] and reveals it to you and i it's not how
[18:36] eloquent
[18:37] a man can speak or wow my this man can
[18:39] put this together
[18:40] back this up so it's become so clear a
[18:43] man can't do that
[18:45] that takes god it is a sovereign work
[18:49] between god and his people god will take
[18:52] a gift
[18:52] like paul would tell timothy steady to
[18:55] show that self-approve
[18:56] but it was not timothy to coming to rely
[19:00] upon his studies he studied but when he
[19:02] stood right there
[19:03] he was like paul trembling wow he knows
[19:07] it gotta be god come it's got to be god
[19:10] take the word
[19:11] it's got to be god speak to the people
[19:16] hallelujah the holy ghost takes the word
[19:19] in our lives
[19:20] and reveals that word it's him
[19:24] opening that word in our life you see
[19:26] there's a lot of things
[19:28] that we could look at evidences but the
[19:31] sure evidence
[19:33] of the holy ghost is when the spirit of
[19:36] truth has come
[19:38] he will lead and guide you into all
[19:40] truth
[19:41] the love of the world is gone
[19:45] there's no condemnation because why in
[19:48] your own self
[19:49] you know where you're standing the love
[19:51] of the world is gone
[19:53] you're not just standing at somebody in
[19:55] their spirit or their natural mind say
[19:57] well i love god i love god no it's from
[20:00] your soul
[20:01] you know the love of god has moved
[20:04] inside there
[20:05] and this word that you're reading it's
[20:07] not just words on paper
[20:10] [Music]
[20:11] it's life to you amen amen it's things
[20:15] that nuggets and you might say
[20:16] i don't see the complete picture but
[20:19] you've got to have
[20:20] pieces of the puzzle in order for the
[20:22] picture to come
[20:24] don't get in a hurry don't get anxious
[20:28] what do i do be patient patient
[20:31] is this is what god has done in my life
[20:34] this this is what he's committed to
[20:36] he'll lead and guide me into all truth
[20:46] amen
[20:49] this is what jesus said a little while
[20:52] and the world won't see me matter of
[20:55] fact he said
[20:56] you won't see me but he says you'll see
[20:58] me again speaking of the resurrection
[21:00] they didn't understand that
[21:02] but then as he expresses it i go away
[21:07] right you'll see me
[21:11] remember they asked him how are we going
[21:13] to see you
[21:15] how are we going to see you how are we
[21:17] going to know you
[21:19] now think of it when everything took
[21:22] place i want you to catch this
[21:26] they they the disciples right there with
[21:30] him
[21:30] had not caught john's ministry
[21:34] is that right right they caught it in a
[21:37] sense that
[21:38] they knew there was something about
[21:40] john's ministry
[21:42] they had been listen they had been
[21:43] baptized under repentance
[21:45] but as far as that position and all of
[21:48] that coming and tying together
[21:50] of that of elijah they didn't see it at
[21:52] that moment but when jesus
[21:54] sat down he never said hey john is that
[21:57] elijah he never even had to say that
[22:00] he just began to speak the word
[22:03] the word of promise for that day and the
[22:06] bible says
[22:07] then they understood that he spoke
[22:10] to them concerning john the baptist
[22:16] see that's the same the same way that
[22:19] god comes
[22:20] to make himself known to our lives
[22:25] let me just just take a few scriptures
[22:27] here
[22:30] we're talking of that spiritual mind
[22:34] right in the very center of the bible
[22:37] we're speaking of that's
[22:38] that spiritual mind i i renew
[22:41] how it's just a it must be
[22:45] a transformation a change
[22:48] that god himself alone brings
[22:51] now think of this in the very center of
[22:55] the bible
[22:56] the the very center of it is psalms 103
[23:00] bless the lord on my soul and all that's
[23:02] within me bless his holy name
[23:05] bless the lord on my soul and forget not
[23:07] all his benefits
[23:08] who forgiveth all thy iniquities healeth
[23:11] all thy diseases
[23:12] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[23:14] crowneth thee with
[23:15] loving kindness and tender mercies who
[23:18] satisfy
[23:19] thy mouth with good things
[23:23] so that thy youth is renewed
[23:26] like the eagles
[23:31] in isaiah 40 verse 31
[23:35] the bible says they that wait upon
[23:38] the lord
[23:42] that's what they had to do in the upper
[23:43] room they had to wait
[23:46] on the lord but waiting according
[23:49] to his promise amen they that wait
[23:52] on the lord so a promise is made known
[23:56] god makes that promise known to that
[23:58] life and that life
[24:00] god is drawing that life he's drawing
[24:02] that heart now notice they that wait on
[24:04] the lord
[24:05] shall renew their strength
[24:09] they shall mount up with wings as
[24:12] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[24:16] they shall walk and not faint
[24:19] amen so he satisfied our mouth
[24:23] with good things
[24:27] it's good things it comes into our life
[24:30] it gets down here this is where it has
[24:32] to be lived
[24:34] but he's satisfying us with that truth
[24:37] that reality he's feeding us how
[24:41] how does how does he feed us this is him
[24:44] him imparting his word to you and i
[24:48] am amen so that our youth is renewed as
[24:52] an eagle
[24:52] right amen
[24:56] god likens his prophets to eagles
[25:01] god likens his children to eagles
[25:06] because an eagle you know i know i've
[25:09] probably said this here
[25:10] before we we have them around
[25:14] more and more so in ohio than we than
[25:15] we've ever uh had them
[25:18] and i can look up you know at times you
[25:20] can be driving you can see a set of
[25:22] wings
[25:22] my looks to be like a big bird but every
[25:25] time i watch it
[25:27] and i see can it stay steady if it can't
[25:30] stay steady i turn my eyes from it
[25:32] because i know it's not an eagle
[25:34] because an eagle even in the midst of
[25:36] strong winds
[25:37] and strong currents it's not shaky
[25:40] that's a vulture
[25:42] the vulture you know them ugly turkey
[25:44] vultures them things are
[25:46] they they're all shaking and all over
[25:48] the place
[25:49] right even though i watched the heart
[25:51] get blown around
[25:53] but what you'll find about an eagle is
[25:56] when those currents begin to come in
[25:58] an eagle knows how to take and to move
[26:01] within that current
[26:03] amount it's built for those currents
[26:10] when those currents come the eagle just
[26:13] keeps on climbing
[26:14] and climbing and climbing it was built
[26:18] to travel
[26:19] in those winds
[26:22] i mean just say very clearly you were
[26:24] built to travel in this wind
[26:26] you are ordained for the swim what wind
[26:29] are you talking about
[26:30] the same russian mighty wind that came
[26:34] on the day of pentecost the same wind
[26:36] that came
[26:37] and feel that body that stood up that
[26:40] was dry bones
[26:41] and skin and sinew and all that came
[26:44] upon it that same wind
[26:47] that filled it what is that wind
[26:50] it is the prophecy of the word coming to
[26:53] pass
[26:54] the spirit of god moving and giving life
[26:59] amen
[27:04] this is eagle time amen amen
[27:09] brother branham over and over
[27:14] praise the lord
[27:18] throughout the message they'll say the
[27:22] spiritual mind will catch this
[27:24] he talks about even what was taking
[27:27] place
[27:29] you know even when john f kennedy got
[27:30] elected right
[27:32] is that right
[27:35] he talked about things that was going on
[27:37] then
[27:40] he talked about pressures that was
[27:43] coming on
[27:44] even in the national level that was
[27:46] going on at that time he talked about
[27:48] all those things let me just tell you
[27:50] that wasn't the mind of william brown
[27:53] a spiritual mind sees the chaos but
[27:56] notice
[27:57] that's that is prophesied in the
[28:00] scripture
[28:02] we're living in a time of trouble
[28:06] men's hearts are feeling failing for
[28:08] fear
[28:11] we're living in evil days paul spoke of
[28:14] those
[28:14] to timothy that was not for that day
[28:17] that's for this day
[28:19] if god has spoken that that's clear in
[28:22] this day
[28:22] there is also a promise that god has
[28:25] made no
[28:26] for his children to escape that judgment
[28:30] to abstain the pressures of this world
[28:36] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[28:39] be
[28:40] in the coming of the son of man not just
[28:42] a part of god
[28:45] but the very fullness amen right there's
[28:48] a body on earth
[28:51] the fullness of christ in his people
[28:55] as he walks in the days of noah so shall
[28:57] it be
[28:58] in the coming of the son of man as it
[29:01] was in the days of lot
[29:02] what was the days of loss
[29:09] that's why you look at this movement
[29:11] that's going on right now
[29:13] it's nothing but sodomites
[29:16] they don't have the interest of the
[29:17] black people at all it's solomites
[29:22] why that's what's inspired on this earth
[29:26] in this time but let me tell you there's
[29:28] a real holy ghost
[29:29] that'll bring unity between the black
[29:32] and the white
[29:32] between the latino and the white it's
[29:35] the holy world
[29:36] that's taking us
[29:44] [Applause]
[29:53] it and will not be caught up in foolish
[29:55] things
[29:56] [Music]
[29:58] spiritual mind catches it to recognize
[30:02] what's behind us
[30:08] spiritual mind catches it that's right
[30:11] to wear on the front a couple years ago
[30:13] the man of the year
[30:15] on the homosexual magazine the man of
[30:17] the year
[30:18] pope francis
[30:22] spiritual mind catches those things
[30:26] denominational and others can say my how
[30:29] terrible this is
[30:30] how terrible that is but listen the
[30:32] carnal mind will look at john 17
[30:35] and say well we're all to be one let's
[30:37] all get together
[30:39] it don't matter what you are let's all
[30:41] get together that's balaamism
[30:45] the spiritual minds that you see these
[30:47] are not just scriptures
[30:49] and stories in the old testament the
[30:51] spiritual mind
[30:52] catches that and says balaamism is not
[30:56] of god
[30:58] it's wanting to unite that of god and
[31:01] that of the world
[31:02] and god said i will not accept that all
[31:05] right
[31:05] [Applause]
[31:10] all of these things are taking place
[31:13] but that ain't my focus no the world's
[31:16] getting caught up
[31:18] let them get caught up we've been caught
[31:21] up
[31:21] right amen amen the spiritual mind
[31:25] catches them to me there's never been a
[31:28] better time to live
[31:31] and yet if you just look at the world
[31:32] it's terrible
[31:34] but you see what is it that that is so
[31:37] good
[31:37] about right now it's god himself that
[31:40] has come down
[31:41] among us he's revealing himself in his
[31:44] word
[31:44] that is the same yesterday today and
[31:47] forever
[31:47] i know who i am you know who you are the
[31:50] spiritual man
[31:51] tested and said it's time to leave
[31:58] the spiritual
[32:06] that's why brother branham would say it
[32:09] like this
[32:11] this book men have had
[32:16] we got to get the right greek
[32:18] translation we got to get this
[32:19] translation
[32:22] that ain't what was needed
[32:28] we needed the holy ghost to come and
[32:31] take his word
[32:33] and reveal it to our hearts amen amen
[32:41] it will take brother brown would say
[32:42] like this he said he will take
[32:45] a people with prophetic insight
[32:52] you realize what that means that you
[32:54] ordained to be spiritual
[32:57] paul said let him that is spiritual or a
[33:00] prophet
[33:01] acknowledge the things i write unto you
[33:03] are the commandments of the law
[33:06] it's something that raises within you
[33:08] what is that prophetic
[33:10] you were always an ego
[33:13] right amen but there had to come a
[33:15] quickening
[33:16] it took the spirit of god revealing that
[33:18] word to begin to lift that up
[33:22] we see all of this around us nations are
[33:25] breaking
[33:25] yes that's right israel's awakening
[33:29] the signs that the prophets foretold
[33:34] gentile days are numbered
[33:40] the day of redemption is near men's
[33:43] hearts
[33:43] are failing for fear be filled
[33:47] with the spirit you're lamp trimmed and
[33:50] clean
[33:56] you see this this eagle hallelujah
[34:00] you trace that eagle on down on down
[34:03] through the lineage
[34:05] that eagle here his grandmother's
[34:08] grandpa on and on and on was eagles
[34:11] everybody you find the believers down
[34:13] through the scriptures
[34:15] they were eagles enoch
[34:18] was an eagle elijah was an eagle
[34:22] elisha was an eagle ruth was an eagle
[34:26] rehab was an eagle we're talking about
[34:29] eagles
[34:30] they were able to see yes amen they are
[34:33] able to see
[34:34] afar off
[34:38] they walk as pilgrims and strangers
[34:44] among the people in that hour they were
[34:46] thought crazy
[34:47] they were cut but fools right right
[34:51] ruth why are you going that direction
[34:55] yeah you don't have no promise over
[34:56] there something was drawing here
[35:00] amen you're right
[35:04] something was drawing her let me just
[35:05] move on from there it was drawing her
[35:08] into that place
[35:09] you see as an eagle now an
[35:12] eagle brother brown will tell that story
[35:15] over and over of that little eagle
[35:16] that's in the barnyard
[35:18] that eagle remember when mama came over
[35:21] him
[35:22] that gripped his heart
[35:26] but what mama told him
[35:31] she told him you got to make a jump
[35:34] right
[35:35] right in other words you got to make a
[35:37] start somewhere
[35:38] brother ramble pick this up within this
[35:40] time of the message he'll talk about
[35:42] in a prisoner he said if you got to
[35:44] start with your dress you start there
[35:46] you've got to have a start all right
[35:48] there's there's there's ground you've
[35:49] got to start
[35:50] and build and let god build within your
[35:53] life
[35:54] he said you got to make a jump he said
[35:55] now when that first jump was made he
[35:57] said oh my
[35:58] you know he didn't look pretty right i
[36:00] mean when that eagle made that first
[36:02] jump but you see
[36:03] he had never been there right he had
[36:05] never done that before
[36:07] right but when he obeyed that voice
[36:10] then when he says jump i never jumped
[36:13] before
[36:13] but when he opened it he jumped it
[36:16] didn't look pretty
[36:17] but he was off the ground
[36:20] amen and that's what faith that's what
[36:22] brother ben said we all started that way
[36:25] it took faith in the word to get us
[36:28] off the ground amen
[36:32] but the objective was not just the fence
[36:35] post
[36:36] the objective amen hallelujah because
[36:40] [Music]
[36:45] it's because you were built to fly up
[36:48] here amen
[36:49] there was a call that came over the
[36:52] world
[37:01] the rest of the carnal mind the rest
[37:03] that could be there
[37:04] saying why there's nothing to it and
[37:06] they keep on going back to it but you
[37:08] can't do that
[37:09] right let me preach now
[37:12] i just feel to follow this you can't go
[37:15] back to that now
[37:17] there's things when god taps and he
[37:19] deals with your life
[37:21] you might be flopping around but you
[37:23] know i can't go back you know why
[37:25] there's a reality that's taking hold of
[37:27] your life but that reality
[37:28] he wants to bring you fully into himself
[37:33] that's why you can't be comfortable it
[37:35] doesn't matter where you would go
[37:37] there is only one place of rest and
[37:39] that's in christ
[37:43] christ is that place of rest amen
[37:52] this is what that's the word
[37:56] brother brown i'm here when courage and
[37:58] hearts
[38:00] he says if you if you've not fully fed
[38:02] on this word
[38:04] to give yourself strength to fly above
[38:08] all the denominations and things of the
[38:10] world
[38:11] will you do it at this time
[38:15] you see paul would go on another place
[38:17] and i'm gonna
[38:18] i'm just gonna close here paul would go
[38:22] on
[38:22] in another place here in the scriptures
[38:26] and he would speak of inner life of how
[38:30] we put off that old man put on that new
[38:33] man
[38:34] that is renewed in knowledge after the
[38:37] image of him
[38:38] that created him
[38:42] neither greek nor jew circumcision or
[38:46] uncircumcision barbarians cynthia bond
[38:48] nor free but christ
[38:50] is all and in all right
[38:55] the scriptures we opened with in romans
[38:59] 8
[39:01] that which is of the flesh minds the
[39:03] things of the flesh
[39:05] what's of the spirit minds the things of
[39:07] the spirit
[39:15] the flesh cannot receive the things of
[39:17] god
[39:18] all right it takes that
[39:22] inside man it's the inner man that god's
[39:27] talking to
[39:29] amen don't try to straighten this guy
[39:31] out
[39:34] what do i do die
[39:38] let go all right let go hallelujah
[39:43] let go means lay it night down at his
[39:46] feet
[39:48] did the hound just say god i'm giving
[39:50] everything that i am to you
[39:54] the flesh that mind cannot
[39:57] receive the things of god but it takes
[40:00] the spirit of god
[40:02] coming on the spiritual mind
[40:07] it isn't that you understand everything
[40:10] but you've come in contact with the
[40:13] world
[40:15] around that you know
[40:19] it's real you know you've been brought
[40:22] into that realm
[40:25] the word is not just letters to you any
[40:28] longer
[40:31] it's not just letters
[40:34] it's light to your life
[40:38] when you're listening to the message you
[40:40] hear god speaking to you
[40:44] you're reading in the scriptures god's
[40:46] speaking to you
[40:48] you're in prayer god's speaking to you
[40:55] and isn't that you that they're always
[40:57] hearing an audible voice
[40:59] but the word will speak to you amen
[41:01] right
[41:03] there's things you begin to see in the
[41:05] world
[41:07] it begins to set you in motion amen
[41:10] what is it it's god revealing his word
[41:13] in you it's a spiritual mind
[41:20] the scripture said
[41:26] we no longer walk after the flesh
[41:30] but we walk after the spirit right
[41:34] right it speaks of where the desire
[41:38] the first place in our life is to him
[41:42] the flesh could say but the spirit says
[41:46] this
[41:48] paul think of it but here is over here
[41:51] is
[41:51] that woman following him around
[41:54] these men being the men of god to show
[41:57] us the way
[41:58] under righteousness at any moment paul
[42:01] could have turned around
[42:02] and said all right get out of here satan
[42:05] right at any time he could have done
[42:07] that
[42:08] but you see what the mind of christ did
[42:10] the spiritual mind
[42:12] waited on orders from god amen
[42:16] amen and finally after god let them run
[42:19] their advertisements
[42:21] then finally the spirit of god let paul
[42:24] and paul turn around and said
[42:25] that spirit come out of here all right
[42:27] right see everything was in its
[42:30] season and in its time this is why
[42:33] for the round over and over and say a
[42:35] gift it's not like a knife
[42:37] you take and cut your way into something
[42:39] he said but a gift
[42:40] is what is unit and god uses it
[42:44] this is why the real gift is that soul
[42:47] that comes from god
[42:49] and what is that soul it's a life it's
[42:51] not you doing
[42:52] it but it's christ you yielding and
[42:55] christ is doing
[42:56] it through you the real gift is where
[42:59] you're able to get yourself
[43:01] out of the way
[43:05] and you know what's a paradox is even
[43:07] when you're getting in the way
[43:10] there's a greater reality raises up on
[43:12] the inside
[43:13] just calm down boy
[43:20] something moves up from the inside
[43:25] a spiritual mind
[43:28] a spiritual mind when the carnal mind
[43:31] could say
[43:32] why in the world this airplane down
[43:36] got to get into this place right now
[43:38] memphis stranded in memphis
[43:40] goodness what are we going to do
[43:44] you know what i'm talking about god
[43:47] allowed the instruments on that airplane
[43:49] the prophet was traveling on
[43:50] those instruments started going hey why
[43:52] brother ram couldn't see that
[43:54] good thing i wouldn't want to see that
[43:55] either
[43:58] i already told the young people i ain't
[44:00] getting on a pilotless airplane
[44:02] i get on there getting right back off
[44:04] i'd rather ride a paper airplane than a
[44:06] pilot was formed
[44:08] but here god grounds that plane
[44:12] [Music]
[44:15] why there was a need not in the whole
[44:17] city
[44:18] of memphis one person
[44:27] and she had read in the word there was a
[44:30] need
[44:30] in her home her son was wayward he was
[44:34] dying but what she wanted for his
[44:36] healing
[44:37] she wanted his soul to be right with god
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:42] and she looked in the word it wasn't a
[44:44] battle story to her
[44:46] she read in the word she said lord as
[44:49] that
[44:50] of my woman now where is your
[44:53] elijah
[44:57] spiritual mind amen
[45:01] spiritual mind you see it's a spiritual
[45:03] mind that leads you in the word
[45:05] to find your answer
[45:08] sometimes you're looking for answers you
[45:10] say well that ain't wrote in the
[45:11] scripture
[45:12] but you watch how god can find me god
[45:14] can direct you
[45:15] it might come out here in a service it
[45:18] might come while you're listening to
[45:19] a message or in the scripture and then
[45:21] god might drop something
[45:22] you might be driving down the road and
[45:24] all of a sudden the spirit of god
[45:26] as you're meditating it comes in upon
[45:28] your life and then you got a peace
[45:30] you don't know how it's all going to
[45:32] work out but you know it's settled
[45:34] it's finished what is that spiritual
[45:36] mind amen
[45:41] thank you lord one of
[45:45] one of them i'm so glad that i can say
[45:49] one of them morning person
[45:53] amen praise the lord how did you know i
[45:56] was a person
[45:59] because i've been standing here waiting
[46:02] on you
[46:06] that's somebody who takes a hold of a
[46:08] promise and says i don't care if the
[46:10] weather conditions
[46:11] do was on her back god made something
[46:15] known to her
[46:16] and she said i'm gonna wait here until
[46:18] it comes to pass
[46:20] spiritual mind amen
[46:24] brother batman ask her oh you know
[46:28] tells her his name have you ever heard
[46:30] of me said no
[46:33] see it wasn't because she heard of him
[46:35] or knew about him
[46:37] she only knew she had prayed she
[46:39] identified herself in the word now she
[46:41] said lord i'm identified there
[46:43] you are also in the word where is your
[46:45] elijah
[46:46] to me and she recognizes
[46:50] they go into that house you know what
[46:51] brother brandon said when she got down
[46:53] to pray
[46:53] brother brown says my goodness he said
[46:56] when she prayed
[46:57] i know she had talked to him before
[47:01] hallelujah
[47:05] and the presence of god came right there
[47:08] into that home
[47:09] and where that boy was out there he was
[47:12] drowning in sin
[47:13] he was drowning in despair but a
[47:16] spiritual man
[47:17] was able to look away look beyond the
[47:20] circumstances
[47:21] and call jesus on the scene and down
[47:24] movement he said it's getting light in
[47:25] here oh it's getting light mama
[47:27] mama it's getting light what was it
[47:29] light was coming
[47:31] to him
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:35] the spiritual mind
[47:43] this is why as we walk
[47:48] in the spirit we're walking after the
[47:52] spirit
[47:53] we're not walking after the flesh
[48:00] that word walk it deals with i'm closing
[48:03] it deals with me
[48:05] oversight the regulating
[48:09] the directing of our life
[48:13] brother branham brings it so simple
[48:17] he says in this manner he says the
[48:21] doctor
[48:22] can say you're going to die
[48:27] you don't have a chance to live
[48:31] he said that's what the doctor will say
[48:35] he said but then the holy ghost comes
[48:37] right and he
[48:38] gives a vision and he says
[48:42] thus saith the lord you're going to be
[48:44] well
[48:45] right then we say what the spirit
[48:48] has said amen we no longer walk
[48:52] by the flesh we're walking by
[48:55] the spirit because the brandon brings it
[48:58] down very simple again he says
[49:00] in that same place he says my flesh says
[49:03] oh i'm too tired oh you had such a long
[49:07] week
[49:09] how about just streaming where you can
[49:10] prop your feet up in your lazy boy
[49:13] who preached brother sam
[49:17] you know god and god knows and god
[49:20] understands
[49:22] the flesh says you're too tired
[49:25] but the spirit says get ready
[49:37] and when we get there i'm gonna need to
[49:39] borrow your hands
[49:41] because i'm gonna need to clap a little
[49:43] bit sure sure is the world
[49:45] i'm gonna need to raise him in the air
[49:47] change the world i'm gonna need to
[49:48] borrow that now
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:54] one of these days the flesh is gonna
[49:56] take gonna think that spiritual mind on
[49:57] the inside
[50:01] because this spiritual mind is going to
[50:03] lead it right into a body change
[50:07] the spiritual mind that catches
[50:11] the will of god god's desire is to
[50:15] fulfill
[50:16] his word through our life
[50:20] it isn't about i think god has said that
[50:23] so clearly through this service
[50:25] it's not about you understanding
[50:27] everything
[50:28] right as ministers we don't understand
[50:31] everything
[50:32] the things that we're ministering it's
[50:34] what god has revealed
[50:36] it's not what you understand by your
[50:38] natural mind
[50:40] it's what god has revealed and god
[50:42] doesn't reveal
[50:44] everything all at once he reveals little
[50:47] by little by the way but the first part
[50:51] even in starting is letting go like that
[50:53] little eagle and let god
[50:55] take you into those realms where you
[50:56] belong let him take you there
[50:59] there's nothing to say it's so clear
[51:02] there's nothing
[51:03] that he hasn't already taken care of
[51:08] for your departure he's already
[51:12] made a way it doesn't matter what would
[51:14] be
[51:15] a hold on a person's life he has
[51:18] already freed you
[51:21] if you can only let your faith accept
[51:25] what he has already done as soon as you
[51:28] let your faith just say
[51:30] be it unto me let me just tell you satan
[51:33] he gets antsy in these times
[51:36] because god has come in the word and
[51:38] he's taken the cover off of him
[51:40] he lets it be exposed that he's already
[51:42] a defeated being
[51:44] amen and satan has already been stripped
[51:47] of his authority and right now even as a
[51:50] son
[51:50] and daughter of god you've got a right
[51:53] to accept
[51:54] the liberty that god has already
[51:57] purchased for you you can put it just in
[52:00] this plain
[52:01] simple way i denounced that of the world
[52:04] i surrender fully to god lord fill me
[52:07] with your life
[52:08] and let god let him administer the
[52:11] strength that you have made up
[52:13] to fly above the things of the world
[52:15] what i do jump
[52:22] and if you got grounded maybe you're up
[52:26] there flying
[52:26] and you got grounded it's time to fly
[52:29] away from them chipmunks
[52:33] it's time to fly away from that devil
[52:35] chatter
[52:38] he doesn't hold the mystery of your life
[52:40] no amen
[52:41] don't keep waiting around there what do
[52:44] i have to do
[52:46] let the wings you've been given pack you
[52:48] up out of there
[52:50] hallelujah let it pack you up out there
[52:53] all you got to do is set your wings
[52:56] and all that chatter remember the
[52:58] chatter can't go with you when you climb
[53:00] in him
[53:01] that chipmunk cannot go where you can go
