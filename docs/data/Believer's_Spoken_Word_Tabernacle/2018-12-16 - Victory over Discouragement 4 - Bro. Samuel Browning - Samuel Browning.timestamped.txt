[39:27] verse 31 it says then saith Jesus unto
[39:31] them all ye shall be offended because of
[39:37] me this night or it is written I will
[39:41] smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the
[39:44] flock shall be scattered remember this
[39:48] is a very the Passover supper was a very
[39:53] intimate setting but this is already
[39:56] after Judas has departed so this is the
[40:00] shepherd speaking - not a mixed
[40:04] gathering but he's speaking to the Sheep
[40:07] I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep
[40:13] of the flock shall be scattered abroad
[40:16] but after I am risen again I will go
[40:22] before you into Galilee Peter answered
[40:26] and said unto him though all men shall
[40:30] be offended because of thee yet will I
[40:34] never be offended verse 34 jesus said
[40:41] unto Him verily I say unto thee this
[40:45] night before the crow thou shalt
[40:48] deny me thrice Peter said unto him
[40:52] though I should die with thee yet will I
[40:55] not deny thee likewise also said all the
[41:01] disciples may God bless you bless the
[41:04] reading of the word as you're being
[41:06] seated I want to continue to minister to
[41:12] you this morning on that thought
[41:16] victory over discouragement
[41:25] we can see and realize that there's
[41:30] something here that the Lord Jesus had
[41:33] spoke and has ministered to them they
[41:37] don't understand it they don't
[41:40] understand what he's saying though
[41:43] through a great part of his ministry he
[41:47] makes these things known regarding his
[41:50] suffering he lets them know what's going
[41:53] to await and what's going to come about
[41:56] yet they don't understand it and even in
[42:00] the midst of this time where Peter as
[42:03] well as the rest of the disciples as it
[42:04] is said they made a death great
[42:07] declaration though all men will be
[42:10] offended because of you yet I will never
[42:15] be offended those were some mighty big
[42:19] words I think that we can agree together
[42:23] there's Peter was not just loosely
[42:27] speaking this this was of one who was of
[42:32] love you remember there is a progression
[42:36] through the walk with the Lord Jesus in
[42:40] the disciples there was three folds to
[42:44] that there was where he would regard
[42:46] them as servants and then and the
[42:49] unfolding of leading into this after
[42:52] Judas has departed now he begins to
[42:55] unfold to them I'm no longer gonna call
[42:57] you servants but I'm gonna call you
[43:00] friends they were they were accompanying
[43:03] him at that time a friend is one who's a
[43:05] companion but then after the
[43:08] resurrection is when that he would make
[43:11] known to them go tell my brethren so it
[43:15] was a continual unfolding of the
[43:17] relationship as it continued to move and
[43:20] you know when you you see this in the
[43:23] word of offended there's a lot of things
[43:26] that you and I do not know we do not
[43:30] understand but remember it's not our
[43:33] understanding that is faith
[43:36] faith as we said last week and look in
[43:39] the scriptures through faith we
[43:42] understand so it's not understanding and
[43:45] then having faith but it's faith itself
[43:47] that leads to understanding and the
[43:50] understanding isn't that we and
[43:52] ourselves would need to put all the P's
[43:54] and Q's together that is where that we
[43:56] and ourselves will frustrate ourselves
[43:59] trying to make things fit and you know
[44:02] brother Bantam laid that out you know in
[44:04] in just different parts you hear
[44:06] throughout all the message you see what
[44:08] has happened down through time were
[44:10] people trying to figure things out and I
[44:13] don't believe that people meant wrong
[44:15] trying to figure things out but I think
[44:18] there is a common thread and a principle
[44:21] that it brings us all back to we are not
[44:23] to be anxious about anything we're not
[44:28] to be anxious the Lord Jesus went
[44:30] through that Paul lays that out in the
[44:33] phrase be careful for nothing you don't
[44:35] need to be anxious about anything but
[44:37] you see waiting is not anxiousness
[44:40] waiting in hope hope meaning an
[44:42] expectation of what faith has revealed
[44:45] to your heart you look for that to come
[44:47] to pass and it's something that you're
[44:50] not pulled away from it's something
[44:52] you're able to move through your daily
[44:55] tasks your life and for a moment to
[44:57] moment you're looking for the
[44:59] fulfillment of that as a matter of fact
[45:01] brother Bannon would put it like this
[45:02] where he said believers these things are
[45:05] made known and revealed to believers he
[45:07] said believers then are on their toes
[45:10] waiting for these things to come to pass
[45:13] and realizing that it won't be our
[45:16] understanding that actually is able to
[45:18] grasp what's really happening it will
[45:21] take the same Lord God who spoke it to
[45:24] make us aware of what is taking place
[45:27] within that hour and there is many
[45:29] things that you know and I know as well
[45:32] it's the net it's not always things that
[45:34] we come to a place and say AHA that puts
[45:37] us in motion part of that is where we'll
[45:39] come to are I see it and it starts
[45:42] putting us in motion into what God would
[45:44] have for us and then there's other times
[45:46] where the Spirit of God will move on our
[45:48] life and actually put us in
[45:50] in motion and we don't feel it we don't
[45:53] feel spiritual with it it isn't some
[45:55] great aurora or all about it it's just
[45:58] we see it moving and here it is it's God
[46:01] Himself sovereignly moving in our life
[46:04] you say why does he do it that way
[46:05] because the whole part of Christianity
[46:09] and of the gospel the whole essence of
[46:11] the kingdom is complete trust in him
[46:15] it's not trusting in ourselves it's not
[46:18] trusting it's trusting completely in him
[46:21] and God allows situations based upon
[46:24] each and every one of us how our
[46:25] temperaments our makeups all those
[46:27] things God knows how to deal with each
[46:29] and every one of us I'm glad about that
[46:31] I'm glad that the formula for dealing
[46:33] with me isn't given to you and so forth
[46:35] I'm glad that it were in here sans
[46:37] because the whole goal is us coming to
[46:39] complete trust because when we can
[46:41] really see at Genesis 22 where the RAM
[46:44] Himself comes who was always you know as
[46:48] Abraham went there he comes on the scene
[46:50] and when you think down through time
[46:52] they had been looking for the RAM they
[46:54] stood on the promise that God had gave
[46:57] to them they came each one of these men
[46:59] and women brothers and sisters down
[47:01] through the Old Testament all of the
[47:03] elect ones they stood in the promise of
[47:06] the Lamb and the Bible says that they
[47:08] embrace these promises looking for a
[47:11] city whose builder and maker was gone
[47:13] you see where God had opened the word to
[47:16] them they would actually go to that
[47:18] place in the word by the sovereignty and
[47:20] leadership of Almighty God and they were
[47:23] there with expectation in their hearts
[47:26] the same way it was down through the
[47:28] church ages it's the same way even after
[47:30] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[47:31] Christ the disciple says is it now that
[47:35] you will restore the kingdom to Israel
[47:37] what did he tell him don't worry about
[47:39] it he says it's not for you to know the
[47:42] seasons which has been put in his hand
[47:46] you see brother man tells us the Lord
[47:48] Jesus did not even know his position at
[47:50] that time and even with the coming he
[47:52] said that would actually be revealed
[47:54] after he entered in to his meet at Oriel
[47:57] work what trust I could just preach on
[48:00] for that right there what trust you see
[48:02] everything with the
[48:04] life of the Lord Jesus he did not do
[48:06] everything by a knowledge it was by
[48:09] faith he knew who he was and as long as
[48:12] he walked in submission to that every
[48:15] fold and every part of his life every
[48:17] Junction it would be unfolded to him
[48:19] when it was necessary for him to know it
[48:22] oh my if we can walk and live with that
[48:25] kind of arrest to know that the same God
[48:28] as he moved there in the life of the
[48:30] Lord Jesus his son that's the same way
[48:33] that for each and every one of us has
[48:35] believers as sons and daughters of God
[48:37] as the Prophet would tell us in the
[48:39] indictment he said he is the example son
[48:42] of what God intends every son and
[48:45] daughter of God to be I believe that
[48:48] don't you and when I look at the
[48:50] scripture here there's many times as we
[48:53] said that we're things that we don't
[48:55] know you know we can't figure out and
[48:57] we'll get to looking at things and you
[48:59] know the worst thing that we can do is
[49:01] wander I'm not talking about meditating
[49:04] meditating is where you take a word a
[49:06] promise and you know it's true and there
[49:09] might be something you're looking at
[49:10] saying you know I just don't understand
[49:12] how all this comes together but you just
[49:14] put it before the Lord and you meditate
[49:16] about it and just wait for God to make
[49:19] it known to your heart but then there's
[49:21] other things when situations arise in
[49:23] our lives that you know you don't always
[49:26] know how things are gonna come out you
[49:28] don't always know the Hal or the wind
[49:31] everything's going to happen but it all
[49:32] comes back to trusting the Lord and yet
[49:35] here in the midst of this the Lord Jesus
[49:38] lets them know that all of you are gonna
[49:41] be offended because of me this night now
[49:44] this word offended which we read out of
[49:47] it last week in dealing with John the
[49:49] Baptist where brother BAM says he was
[49:50] kind of offended we look at this word
[49:53] offended in the way and the word itself
[49:55] it deals with something being a
[49:57] stumbling block or an impediment that
[49:59] actually would get in the way and so
[50:02] there's many parts and meanings to this
[50:04] this verse here and it was something if
[50:07] you'll notice and remember the member
[50:09] Peter when Peter himself had actually
[50:11] you know spoke these great words of what
[50:13] he was not going to do remember what the
[50:16] Lord Jesus told him I
[50:17] the scripture he said Peter I've already
[50:20] prayed for you and after you get the
[50:24] Holy Ghost after you're converted then
[50:27] strengthen your brethren but what did he
[50:29] pray for that your faith fail not
[50:33] he said well Peter end up denying him
[50:36] but his faith never failed it just had
[50:39] to come become quickened to the same
[50:42] faith that was dwelling in the life of
[50:45] the Lord Jesus you see there was this
[50:47] was not this offense this was not an
[50:50] offense like it was speaks of a
[50:51] stumbling stone where we look at that
[50:54] the Pharisees they looked at the Lord
[50:55] Jesus and said you're Beelzebub and
[50:57] where there were different ones that
[50:59] walk completely as Peter would pick up
[51:01] that scripture in disobedience to the
[51:03] word these these men right here these
[51:06] disciples though they did not understand
[51:09] what was taking place they were walking
[51:11] in obedience to all they knew and
[51:14] understood at that moment and what they
[51:18] understood he is the Christ he is the
[51:21] Messiah they walked fully in obedience
[51:24] to that you see God does not require
[51:27] from you what has not been revealed to
[51:30] you but what has been revealed to you
[51:32] then great is the requirement and the
[51:35] responsibility I believe that we ought
[51:37] to pray for Revelation but I believe
[51:39] with all of that as the Prophet would
[51:41] lay that out for us and praying for
[51:43] Revelation it comes with the desire to
[51:45] be drawn closer to the Lord that more of
[51:48] us might be consumed that more of him
[51:51] might be made known and reflected in US
[51:54] and through us it's a desire that the
[51:56] relationship would grow deeper and then
[51:59] more even more intimate I believe that's
[52:02] what revelation really is revelation is
[52:04] not knowledge of the scripture there's
[52:06] no prevailing power and knowledge but
[52:08] when revelation is taken hold though you
[52:10] yourself would may not be able to
[52:13] explain certain things but as the
[52:15] scripture says they that believe shall
[52:17] not be confounded and you know what
[52:20] there can be things where you can
[52:21] actually there can be things arguments
[52:24] and whatever more presented it's not
[52:25] because you can now argue somebody you
[52:28] can out prove them with scrip
[52:29] you know this and you know that that's
[52:31] not what we're talking about we're
[52:33] talking about an anchor that holds you
[52:35] even when you don't have the answer you
[52:39] have the answer that's what we're
[52:43] talking about here and so this this
[52:46] experience where the Lord Jesus is going
[52:48] through this were defended it actually
[52:51] is a word scandal II so which means
[52:53] scandalized that's that's what this word
[52:55] is
[52:55] scandalized and to scandalize is where
[52:57] someone is shocked or horrified but the
[53:01] actions that come out of somebody if
[53:03] it's shocked in the Lord Jesus let's say
[53:05] no you're going to be shocked there's
[53:07] gonna be it's this one is going to take
[53:09] place this night it's actually going to
[53:11] shock you but he one word the very next
[53:16] verse I love how the Lord does this this
[53:18] is all the way through the scriptures
[53:19] it's the same way in the israel's
[53:21] journey through the wilderness you'll
[53:22] watch it time and time again judgment
[53:24] and so forth will come out but then
[53:26] you'll notice what the next verse is in
[53:28] verse 33 but 32 but after I'm risen this
[53:33] has to happen but after I miss it I'm
[53:36] gonna go before you into Galilee they
[53:42] couldn't even see the scripture of verse
[53:44] 31 much less verse 32 but that was all
[53:47] right he would make it known to him when
[53:50] they had need of it you see this is
[53:52] where principals of Revelation when we
[53:54] look at it revelation itself is
[53:57] sovereignly given by God remember Jesus
[54:00] he said flesh and blood didn't reveal it
[54:02] unto you
[54:03] but my father which is in heaven so it
[54:06] is a sovereign supernatural act by
[54:09] Almighty God where God would impart an
[54:11] understanding or it would just be
[54:14] dropped in our heart and this is given
[54:16] direct and God can you see who he'll use
[54:18] the agency of man God can actually use
[54:20] the agency even within nature there's
[54:23] things that you can see but remember
[54:25] it's none of those things that actually
[54:27] within itself brings the revelation they
[54:30] are only elements and things that
[54:33] whereby God can use remember Apostle
[54:35] Paul tells us in the book of Romans that
[54:37] even all of creation in nature declares
[54:40] the Godhead so we can see the
[54:42] if we're sensitive enough as brotherman
[54:45] would tell us he says that God is in his
[54:47] creation God is in nature these things
[54:50] would be able to speak and express to
[54:52] you and I aren't you glad that you and I
[54:54] can look all around and it isn't just
[54:56] that we carry a Bible and the Bible
[54:58] speaks to us now that it's become open
[55:00] but you and I are our feeders of truth
[55:03] we are people of truth we can actually
[55:05] take in truth and be able to say thank
[55:09] you lord
[55:10] so Revelation itself I'll say it like
[55:13] this it's also given in the season to
[55:17] those who it's intended for it's given
[55:21] in the season you can't get ahead of the
[55:22] season I I know right now we're heading
[55:24] into a season that maybe some y'all
[55:26] don't like but boy I can't wait til
[55:27] there's more snow comes down here but at
[55:29] any rate yet has to come in its own
[55:31] season huh i never expected a snow storm
[55:33] in july i never expected one in august
[55:36] but i certainly was blessed and shouted
[55:38] a little bit when one and had a little
[55:39] bit of snow came in october than one day
[55:41] and some frost that's set outside but
[55:43] seasons themselves it's reserved things
[55:46] are reserved in seasons it's just like
[55:48] right now this time of the year right
[55:50] here in ohio we don't know if it's gonna
[55:51] ice if it's going to snow is there gonna
[55:53] be sunny is there gonna rain we don't
[55:55] know what's going to happen but yet we
[55:56] know in this season of all you know
[55:58] learned ohio anything can happen
[56:03] we know that so a season itself it's it
[56:07] it is a revelation is reserved for a
[56:09] season and it is given with the in
[56:13] purpose to guide those it's intended for
[56:16] it is the Spirit of Truth that reveals
[56:21] the the spirit of error and gives you as
[56:26] a believer dominion over the spirit of
[56:30] error because remember the spirit of
[56:32] error comes in very innocent the right
[56:36] and then it makes its ride all the way
[56:38] through once it's conceived it leads to
[56:41] death
[56:41] so that the Spirit of Truth gives
[56:44] dominion over the spirit of air even
[56:47] though those who live back there as the
[56:49] elect of God in their time and stood on
[56:51] that revelation though they themselves
[56:53] could not understand
[56:55] everything but it was the patience and
[56:57] faith of the saints that they could rest
[56:59] in what God had made himself known to
[57:02] them in that generation and though they
[57:04] did not see all things but they did see
[57:08] him in their day and they walked
[57:11] faithful to it the other part is that it
[57:14] will always revelation is revealed to us
[57:18] as we have need of it I'm not gonna ask
[57:21] you to raise your hand but I can testify
[57:24] my own life and I know you can as well
[57:26] that there's times there's things that
[57:28] you've you've looked at and you said I
[57:31] just don't quite understand that I don't
[57:33] see that maybe it's things that maybe
[57:35] you know someone has to let you know and
[57:37] you look at it I don't see that quite
[57:39] yet and you're just looking at it but
[57:41] you know when we place it there before
[57:43] the Lord to know that if I have if this
[57:46] is something that I need
[57:48] then God he's provided all I need then
[57:51] God will make me aware of this because
[57:54] he's not going to keep something from me
[57:56] that I need oh I think I brother branham
[57:59] stands there in that phrase as we have
[58:01] need of it programs say let the holy
[58:03] spirit come tonight Lord and land may he
[58:05] come and minister the word to the
[58:07] preacher and to the congregation
[58:10] revealing as we have need of it so it's
[58:14] as we have need of it you see because
[58:15] revelation is what is to put us in
[58:18] action if what has been revealed does
[58:21] not become vindicated in that life it's
[58:24] not been revealed you see it must
[58:28] revelation is given for that in might
[58:31] come preeminent in that life and then
[58:33] put the individual into action to wear
[58:37] what was spoken as a direct
[58:40] communication between God and them now
[58:43] becomes manifest here in this realm you
[58:47] see the lamb Abel offered up it wasn't
[58:49] something in a spiritual realm there had
[58:51] been a supernatural instruction that was
[58:54] given and it put him into motion Oh
[58:59] glory he heard the same preaching that
[59:03] Adam did he heard the same one that Cain
[59:05] you know Cain and him heard the same
[59:07] thing but what
[59:08] different is is that God was speaking
[59:10] directly to Abel God opened up what
[59:15] fruit was what blood was if it was open
[59:17] to him and Abel himself moved by
[59:20] revelation and that's why the scripture
[59:22] could say by faith see notice all of
[59:26] them scriptures come after as we read
[59:28] through faith we understand how did Abel
[59:31] understand he understood what God had
[59:34] revealed to him and he acted in
[59:37] obedience opponent he heard it he
[59:39] recognized it and he acted opponent you
[59:44] see it's also how that it requires it
[59:48] requires a mystery at selfless
[59:50] you know a mystery has many folds
[59:52] there's things that within the mystery
[59:54] even of the coming of the Lord
[59:56] has been one of those things that's been
[59:58] unfolded all the way down through the
[1:00:01] scriptures and yet it was reserved in
[1:00:04] this hour there are things that though
[1:00:05] many wanted to pry into they could not
[1:00:08] it's not because it wasn't that they
[1:00:10] weren't good men it could not be given
[1:00:13] until this time because it is in this
[1:00:16] hour when you and I would have need of
[1:00:19] it
[1:00:22] I thank God for that I'm glad that God
[1:00:26] is watching over his word this is where
[1:00:30] brother Bram would say that a mystery
[1:00:32] itself
[1:00:33] it requires the teaching of the spirit
[1:00:38] it's not something that's just a
[1:00:40] one-shot deal it requires the teaching
[1:00:44] of the Spirit
[1:00:46] it requires that God himself as we were
[1:00:49] saying last week God unfolds this
[1:00:53] mystery it requires him to do that or it
[1:00:58] never as brother Brent says never
[1:01:00] becomes clear so it all comes back to
[1:01:04] the Lord so now when we look at this
[1:01:06] here in John 6 my goodness in John 16
[1:01:10] verse 28 here the disciples they said
[1:01:14] after as Jesus said I'd come forth from
[1:01:17] the father and I'll come into the world
[1:01:19] again I leave the world and go to the
[1:01:21] Father his disciples said to him know
[1:01:23] now speak us now plainly and speakest no
[1:01:27] proverb and now are we sure that thou
[1:01:30] knowest all things and need us not that
[1:01:34] any man should ask thee by this we
[1:01:37] believe that thou camest from God they
[1:01:42] didn't say we know all things they said
[1:01:46] we are sure thou knowest all things and
[1:01:50] they said by this we believe that thou
[1:01:53] camus from God you see this was not
[1:01:58] something that just ceased after he had
[1:02:01] asked him the question of who do men say
[1:02:03] that I am this continued to unfold
[1:02:06] remember brother brems tells us like
[1:02:08] this when the disciples were with Jesus
[1:02:09] he said it was kind of confusing for
[1:02:12] them
[1:02:12] he said because sometimes he said here
[1:02:14] was the son talking other times the
[1:02:16] father talking it was sometimes he said
[1:02:18] it was Jesus talking the man and then
[1:02:20] other times he said here it was his
[1:02:22] father that was dwelling within him but
[1:02:24] you see what was happening for them is
[1:02:26] an understanding that these that they
[1:02:29] are indeed one I and my father are one
[1:02:31] this was being unfolded to them and they
[1:02:34] believed
[1:02:35] now art come from God jesus answered
[1:02:37] them and said do you now believe
[1:02:39] indifferently sometimes
[1:02:41] Jesus answers my questions oh I love
[1:02:45] that you can come with the question and
[1:02:48] Jesus said I got a question for you
[1:02:50] well how lord I I'm the one I ask the
[1:02:53] question first
[1:02:53] but you see Jesus has a way of answering
[1:02:56] questions with questions verse 32 behold
[1:03:02] the hour cometh yay
[1:03:04] he's now come that ye shall be scattered
[1:03:07] every man to his own and shall leave me
[1:03:11] alone
[1:03:13] and yet I am NOT alone because the
[1:03:17] father is with me where is the Lord
[1:03:21] Jesus his confidence in the word this is
[1:03:25] his confidence it's a trust it's not
[1:03:28] he's not going to lose one of them but
[1:03:30] this is a necessary part they're going
[1:03:32] to be scattered there's coming this you
[1:03:35] shall every man to his own and you'll
[1:03:38] leave me alone
[1:03:39] yet I'm not alone because the father is
[1:03:40] with me these things have I spoken unto
[1:03:43] you that in me you might have peace in
[1:03:46] the world you shall have tribulation but
[1:03:48] be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:03:50] world now notice this in mark chapter 8
[1:03:53] verse 29 the Bible goes on here in this
[1:03:56] part which we would know even from
[1:03:58] Matthew chapter 16 and Jesus said unto
[1:04:01] them but whom say ye that I am and Peter
[1:04:04] answered and said unto him thou art the
[1:04:07] Christ and he charged them that they
[1:04:11] should tell no man of him and he began
[1:04:17] to teach them
[1:04:21] he began there's got to be a beginning
[1:04:24] of this unfolding now watch what'swhat's
[1:04:28] the beginning the beginning he begins to
[1:04:31] teach them
[1:04:33] that the son of man must suffer many
[1:04:37] things and be rejected of the elders and
[1:04:40] of the chief priests and scribes and be
[1:04:42] killed and after three days rise again
[1:04:45] now I would say you and I were sitting
[1:04:47] there and we would not have been
[1:04:49] shouting and saying oh ma then that
[1:04:51] wonderful he's going to be rejected he's
[1:04:54] going to be offered up now even right
[1:04:56] now we do not shout and rejoice on that
[1:04:58] but there is something that touches our
[1:05:00] heart that knows that was necessary if
[1:05:03] that would not have happened you and I
[1:05:06] would not be here today there would not
[1:05:08] even need then the entrance there into
[1:05:11] that of eternal life and even the change
[1:05:13] of the body and this was necessary but
[1:05:15] you see even though he's beginning to
[1:05:17] teach and he's beginning to unfold even
[1:05:20] a mystery of his coming they do not
[1:05:23] understand it at this time it would seem
[1:05:26] like that these words are falling on
[1:05:28] deaf ears but they're not remember it's
[1:05:30] not a man that's sewing these words
[1:05:32] these words were already laid out all
[1:05:35] the way through the scriptures but right
[1:05:37] here it's the same God who inspired
[1:05:39] David and all the messianic Psalms it's
[1:05:41] the same God who had inspired the
[1:05:43] prophets before that would lay out this
[1:05:45] example of the Messiah all this was
[1:05:47] inspired now here it is the Living God
[1:05:49] taking his word that has already been
[1:05:52] sold once before and now has come to
[1:05:55] harvest within his life and he himself
[1:05:57] is standing here in a manner of former
[1:06:00] reign the same Holy Spirit the same God
[1:06:02] and he's letting him know this seed is
[1:06:04] going to be sown you ask them what does
[1:06:07] this mean we don't know what it means we
[1:06:10] don't understand what then what's being
[1:06:11] said here but you see their faith it was
[1:06:14] not based on their understanding it
[1:06:16] comes back they knew who he is and
[1:06:20] that's the same way it is with us as
[1:06:22] believers it's knowing who he is I'm not
[1:06:26] just talking about us one who died upon
[1:06:28] the cross but it's knowing that he is my
[1:06:31] Savior he is my Redeemer
[1:06:33] and I am his son and his daughter by way
[1:06:36] of the new birth it's very very very
[1:06:40] important that that would be unfolded to
[1:06:42] you and I now notice this when he had
[1:06:45] turned about
[1:06:47] verse 32 and Hiba spake that openly and
[1:06:51] Peter took him and began to rebuke him
[1:06:56] when he had turned wise Peter rebuking
[1:06:58] him it's Peters understanding it's
[1:07:03] Peters understanding that's how he's
[1:07:07] rebuking Oh God his understanding is
[1:07:11] causing him to rebuke the Lord Jesus but
[1:07:17] when he had turned about and looked on
[1:07:18] his disciples he rebuked Peter saying
[1:07:23] get thee behind me Satan the Jesus was
[1:07:28] not calling Peter Satan but you see
[1:07:30] Jesus was using discernment
[1:07:34] it was discernment that was given and
[1:07:37] that you think that what has been spoken
[1:07:39] when Peter began to rebuke him and
[1:07:42] saying man this shall not be Lord this
[1:07:44] is not going to happen
[1:07:45] this is not going to go you think that
[1:07:47] according to the flesh of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:50] you think his flesh wasn't tempted and
[1:07:52] pulled to go along with that it was
[1:07:55] known he prayed three times let this cup
[1:07:59] pass from me you think he wasn't tempted
[1:08:02] the Bible says he was tempted in all
[1:08:04] points such as we are when God became
[1:08:07] flesh it was not an act he was tempted
[1:08:11] in all points such as we are now for
[1:08:16] many of us how God has brought such a
[1:08:18] deliverance in our life and that by the
[1:08:19] new birth to where that you know things
[1:08:22] that were we once were tempted we're no
[1:08:23] longer tempted by but there is still
[1:08:26] within our life a personal contending
[1:08:28] with ourselves on a daily basis not only
[1:08:32] daily moments ours areas are contending
[1:08:36] with ourself and pulling ourself our
[1:08:40] thoughts in line and when I say our
[1:08:42] thoughts I'm saying things that would
[1:08:44] even come into our our pathway and we
[1:08:47] might be able to allow those things to
[1:08:49] dwell and then we have to bring that in
[1:08:51] submission in obedience to Christ and
[1:08:53] say get out of here Satan in the name of
[1:08:55] the Lord Jesus Christ a constant battle
[1:08:58] but remember greater is He that is in
[1:09:00] you than he that's in the world it's one
[1:09:02] of these things the Lord Jesus could
[1:09:04] have taken this and said you know what
[1:09:06] Peter you don't want me to go you're my
[1:09:07] buddy you're my pal I'm not gonna go but
[1:09:09] he discerned greater than buddy pal
[1:09:12] brother sister he discerned the word you
[1:09:15] see the life of the Lord Jesus as an
[1:09:17] example to us as believers as mature
[1:09:20] believers is to discern everything not
[1:09:23] by my feelings not bhai life ile this
[1:09:26] feels good wait one day it'll fill
[1:09:28] it's not about feelings we do not walk
[1:09:31] by feelings we walk by faith if you
[1:09:36] don't walk by faith your feelings will
[1:09:38] change and feelings will come right
[1:09:40] around
[1:09:41] it's got to be faith that is the walk of
[1:09:45] the believer anything we do it is to be
[1:09:48] done in faith faith does not mean I know
[1:09:51] all the peace and QS
[1:09:52] there's many decisions that God has had
[1:09:55] me to make in my life
[1:09:56] even of one some recent years that I did
[1:09:58] not have all the peace and cues I do not
[1:10:00] understand it was totally against my way
[1:10:02] of looking at things but yet it was dry
[1:10:05] God's grace to be able to discern what
[1:10:07] his will was at that moment in time and
[1:10:10] listen if he did it for me he'd do the
[1:10:12] same thing for each and every one of you
[1:10:14] and no doubt each one of us can testify
[1:10:16] of how that God has moved in those
[1:10:18] different times discernment is not based
[1:10:20] on feelings it's like when you're
[1:10:23] praying about something how you feel
[1:10:24] about how feel good what should I do
[1:10:28] keep praying well I'm kind of feeling
[1:10:31] towards it what should I do
[1:10:32] keep praying and you know I'm quoting to
[1:10:34] you right
[1:10:35] whistlin Answers 54 how do we seek the
[1:10:39] will of the Lord in anything I started
[1:10:41] leaning towards it I feel I keep praying
[1:10:43] because what it has to be is you've got
[1:10:46] to have thus saith the Lord to be able
[1:10:49] to stand there when everything else
[1:10:52] comes your way because things will come
[1:10:54] your way every decision everything we
[1:10:56] make is either rock or sand every
[1:10:59] decision we make you love me get thee
[1:11:09] behind me Satan
[1:11:12] I'll tell you what I had been really
[1:11:17] hard wouldn't it I'll say yes for you
[1:11:22] yeah the Lord they said yes
[1:11:23] it would be hard for him get behind me
[1:11:25] Satan do you think Peter understood that
[1:11:28] he didn't understand the previous verse
[1:11:33] but here the Lord Jesus says for thou
[1:11:36] savourest not the things that be of God
[1:11:40] but the things that be of men it would
[1:11:44] seem harmless
[1:11:45] it isn't like Jesus was you know going
[1:11:47] to go out and commit some sin or
[1:11:49] whatever more know it was his obedience
[1:11:51] to the word what was his obedience to
[1:11:53] the word it was leading him to death for
[1:11:57] us it would have been easier to go
[1:12:01] according to how Satan was anointing
[1:12:04] Peter you see Satan had always come
[1:12:07] after Lord Jesus and tried to get him to
[1:12:10] abandon abort his mission he would come
[1:12:13] in him now you know you're hungry turned
[1:12:15] the stones in the bread he would learn
[1:12:17] him no I'll show you all the kingdoms of
[1:12:19] the world I'll give him to you if you
[1:12:20] only fall down and worship Me but Jesus
[1:12:23] notice jesus knew the Prophet tells us
[1:12:26] he was going to fall heir to the
[1:12:28] kingdoms of the world did he understand
[1:12:30] it he did not understand it
[1:12:32] but the Lord Jesus had faith in what the
[1:12:34] word had given for him to do in this
[1:12:37] hour and this time you realize when they
[1:12:40] said down knowest all things you realize
[1:12:42] what Jesus knowing all things he's
[1:12:44] standing presently in whom God has
[1:12:47] revealed himself to be and who he is and
[1:12:50] he's standing there in that present
[1:12:52] revelation with full authority you
[1:12:54] cannot stand in authority on future
[1:12:57] events that have not been revealed to
[1:12:58] you the only way you stand in authority
[1:13:01] is you're able to stand presently
[1:13:03] knowing who you are in the Lord Jesus
[1:13:05] Christ and when you know who you are you
[1:13:07] can have rest and peace to know that he
[1:13:10] who holds the future will unfold the
[1:13:12] future in his time and when it comes to
[1:13:14] the future then that will knowest all
[1:13:15] things in the future for the future
[1:13:18] right now it's present that's why Peter
[1:13:21] could say it's important to be
[1:13:22] established not in past not in future
[1:13:26] present truth establishment is more than
[1:13:30] just knowing about it
[1:13:31] it's actually being planted and actually
[1:13:33] having roots and fruit itself beginning
[1:13:35] to come forth from the life established
[1:13:38] life now notice this now savourest not
[1:13:40] the things which be of God but the
[1:13:43] things which be a man
[1:13:45] now I want to go on here in the message
[1:13:46] Shalom I love this sub R of the RAM
[1:13:48] places in here he says we said we
[1:13:50] noticed there was Judas the make believe
[1:13:53] or the unbeliever that waited till he
[1:13:54] found a fault then he turned to the
[1:13:57] disciples and said just the twelve and
[1:13:59] Judas was one of them he said you want
[1:14:01] to go - then Peter said who would we go
[1:14:04] - Lord you're the composer
[1:14:11] anybody ever heard a music composition
[1:14:13] composed a little differently from what
[1:14:15] you've ever heard it before
[1:14:16] I haven't am I'm sure probably most of
[1:14:21] you have but you see this sheet music
[1:14:23] here even though it was already written
[1:14:24] out before the foundation of the world
[1:14:26] and then inspiration dropped on the
[1:14:29] prophets of old and they were riding
[1:14:31] down these notes sometimes the writing
[1:14:34] down of the notes was just simply their
[1:14:35] lives expressing the notes right and
[1:14:38] here this is the sheet music that's
[1:14:41] being laid out in this hour but they do
[1:14:44] not know the next note they don't even
[1:14:47] know how to play the notes that's in
[1:14:49] front of them but that's okay they've
[1:14:51] got to wait for their part he's got to
[1:14:53] play his part and then they can get to
[1:14:55] their part Oh glory be to God you're the
[1:15:01] only one you know how it you know he
[1:15:02] says you know how what's going on you're
[1:15:04] the only one that has the word of life
[1:15:06] where could we turn to we couldn't go
[1:15:08] back to be a Pharisee or sad you see or
[1:15:10] Herodian or whatever it might be you're
[1:15:12] the one that has the word of life we
[1:15:13] have no other place to go we've joined
[1:15:16] ourselves to this great concert we are
[1:15:19] in here we're listening we're in the
[1:15:21] rhythm we believe that you are the son
[1:15:24] of God the manifested Jehovah were sure
[1:15:27] of this what was this thou art the
[1:15:32] manifested Jehovah we don't know what
[1:15:36] these great trials and troubles and
[1:15:39] afflictions and things and you saying
[1:15:41] you're going up to be offered up and all
[1:15:43] this and that the other and on the third
[1:15:45] day and all this stuff we don't
[1:15:47] understand that but we know this but we
[1:15:51] don't understand that but what's
[1:15:54] important is that you know this because
[1:15:56] if you know this soon and very soon
[1:15:58] you'll know that and you'll be able to
[1:16:01] say this is that
[1:16:04] oh ma but we're listening to God's
[1:16:08] Symphony we're a part of it we're
[1:16:10] waiting to see what takes place next
[1:16:12] were following clothes with you you
[1:16:14] catch this
[1:16:15] we're following clothes with you the
[1:16:20] lemon goes on in this here program will
[1:16:24] deal with this talk on the spiritual
[1:16:26] mind
[1:16:28] you remember Paul will even make a
[1:16:31] statement regarding the commandments
[1:16:34] that Paul was given by the Spirit of God
[1:16:38] for the Church of the Living God and
[1:16:41] Paul could say let a man he who is
[1:16:45] spiritual acknowledge that the things
[1:16:46] that I've given unto you are the
[1:16:48] commandments of the Lord but if you're
[1:16:52] not spiritual you can't acknowledge it
[1:16:54] but see spiritual isn't well a person
[1:16:57] they pray for the sick and they get well
[1:16:59] that's not what spiritual is spiritual
[1:17:01] means spirit-filled are you with me
[1:17:05] little man we'll go into this and deal
[1:17:07] with the spiritual mind and he deals
[1:17:10] with how think of this here were the
[1:17:13] disciples the Lord Jesus had called them
[1:17:15] from their fishing their tax collecting
[1:17:17] and everything else he had called him
[1:17:19] from the way that they were walking in
[1:17:21] the things that they were doing and here
[1:17:23] when he began to make manifest the the
[1:17:26] very promise in that hour it drew them
[1:17:29] away from where they were the things
[1:17:32] that they were doing that's the same way
[1:17:33] that he works and has worked in our
[1:17:35] lives and noticed when he comes to this
[1:17:38] place and you know he says I and my
[1:17:40] father are one the Bible tells us that
[1:17:43] many John six six six many of his
[1:17:49] disciples walked with him no more they
[1:17:54] went back to what listen now they went
[1:17:56] back to what they knew you know why
[1:17:59] their walk was not faith it was what I
[1:18:02] know and so what they knew is what they
[1:18:05] counted his faith that's not faith we do
[1:18:08] not walk by sight we walk by faith on
[1:18:12] through the Scriptures but we could just
[1:18:13] preach you know that this is the heart
[1:18:15] of it when the Hebrew children went into
[1:18:17] the fiery furnace they did not go in
[1:18:18] there knowing they were going to be
[1:18:20] delivered they did not know that but
[1:18:22] they knew their God we know this vow our
[1:18:26] Jehovah and
[1:18:28] belong to him we don't understand that
[1:18:30] but they walked faithfully fully in
[1:18:34] obedience and all how God showed up when
[1:18:37] they walk fully in obedience how God
[1:18:39] will test us he'll call us he draws us
[1:18:42] in times where we don't understand but
[1:18:45] it's to see will we fully trust him and
[1:18:48] walk in obedience or is it what I got to
[1:18:50] know the next step because if I don't
[1:18:52] know the next step Lord God I can't make
[1:18:54] a step oh but if you are ordained for
[1:18:56] the rapture he will bring that about
[1:18:58] within your life he'll cause that to
[1:19:00] increase in our life listen even in your
[1:19:03] very nature than might be in nature that
[1:19:05] has to have all the t's crossed all the
[1:19:07] eyes daughters got to be said with a
[1:19:09] certain vernacular and this has to be
[1:19:10] like that you know the same God will
[1:19:12] actually manifest his victory in
[1:19:14] overcoming your nature and my nature
[1:19:17] our temperaments that he himself the
[1:19:19] lamb the RAM might be glorified in the
[1:19:22] very change of the body were you and I
[1:19:24] can say by God's grace he overrode even
[1:19:27] my my own temperament think of how
[1:19:30] brother brandon talks about it if God be
[1:19:32] with us we're building miracles at the
[1:19:34] very last closing paragraph in prayer he
[1:19:36] said Oh Claud if there was anything this
[1:19:38] year that was done that was good in our
[1:19:41] life it's because you overrode our
[1:19:43] stubborn rebellion and you went ahead
[1:19:46] and performed it through our lives you
[1:19:48] say how did God work over stubborn
[1:19:50] rebellion it's the same God who moved
[1:19:52] the darkness that was covering the face
[1:19:54] of the deep he spoke his word and the
[1:19:56] Spirit of God went forth to cause a
[1:19:58] condition and a change to come about but
[1:20:01] the seeds he had already planted by his
[1:20:03] word might come forth as the spirit was
[1:20:05] brooding over it that's the same way in
[1:20:07] our life it is no glory that we have in
[1:20:10] ourselves that I brought forth the word
[1:20:12] I've done this no sir it has been him
[1:20:15] alone a sovereign work if you ask Sarah
[1:20:18] Sarah what did you do nothing as a
[1:20:20] matter of fact I laughed in God's face
[1:20:22] that's what I did but in the midst of
[1:20:24] the time there's something happened in
[1:20:27] me that the faith that my husband had it
[1:20:30] actually moved in my heart and I started
[1:20:33] judging
[1:20:34] him faithful and as a judged him
[1:20:37] faithful I received strength from
[1:20:40] l-fatiha down into my life and I was
[1:20:44] able to be ready for the Lord's
[1:20:46] visitation how'd you do it Sarah I
[1:20:49] didn't he and Sarah could say y'all read
[1:20:53] about my what my works were weren't you
[1:20:55] Sarah could say you you read about
[1:20:57] mountain the tests you read about the
[1:20:59] might of the wild man that was created
[1:21:01] right that fella still gives trouble
[1:21:07] today to Israel will glory
[1:21:16] don't worry Isaac your each meal gives
[1:21:19] you trouble too but Isaac is the one who
[1:21:23] the covenants with and the cabinet one
[1:21:27] has the authority over the other one who
[1:21:30] was born in permissive will the Calvin
[1:21:34] had won by the perfect will of God
[1:21:38] the brother Graham tells us like this
[1:21:40] the spiritual mind he says I can imagine
[1:21:43] the congregation walking away and they
[1:21:45] said this man expects us to be a
[1:21:47] cannibal eat somebody's flesh no he
[1:21:49] didn't think that at all
[1:21:50] that's what you thought that he thought
[1:21:54] they were they walked away not on his
[1:21:57] thoughts why went away cuz he said this
[1:22:00] no it's not why you went away you went
[1:22:01] away because of your thoughts of what he
[1:22:04] said it's not because they his word well
[1:22:07] if he hadn't no it's your thoughts it's
[1:22:08] not his word remember his wire there is
[1:22:12] a thought behind that word and that
[1:22:14] thought is life that thought is Jesus
[1:22:16] Christ doctors and medical stand doctors
[1:22:19] and medical doctors and so forth said
[1:22:21] the man is insane that's all there is
[1:22:24] the priest is right that man is crazy
[1:22:27] give us his body to eat
[1:22:31] that's all he said and about that time
[1:22:35] he just ended and said alright let's
[1:22:38] stand let's sing a song take the name of
[1:22:42] Jesus with you but you just got to the
[1:22:45] point he didn't need to go any further
[1:22:47] you see even though this was a great
[1:22:49] mystery that would be unfolded where
[1:22:52] that Paul himself later would be given
[1:22:55] access by the holy spirit not by Paul's
[1:22:58] will but by God's will when he can say I
[1:23:01] have received of the Lord I have
[1:23:03] received not I pried into I received of
[1:23:06] the Lord and Paul begins to unfold the
[1:23:10] Lord's Supper it was not unfolded in
[1:23:14] this season listen but it had to be
[1:23:16] spoken it's just like out here when they
[1:23:19] plan out winter wheat and things like
[1:23:21] and some of the rest of you live in
[1:23:22] Moore farm country they have to get them
[1:23:24] the seed in the ground at a certain time
[1:23:27] you cannot get the seed in the ground
[1:23:29] and all of expects all of a sudden
[1:23:31] expect to have a crop but if you're
[1:23:32] going to have a crop later on there's
[1:23:35] got to be a sowing time and it's not
[1:23:38] necessary you'll understand in the
[1:23:41] sowing time as far as what's being so
[1:23:43] come on now what's necessary is to
[1:23:46] understand who it is that's doing the
[1:23:49] selling because if you know who's doing
[1:23:51] the sowing you remember he that is
[1:23:54] sowing will bring forth that of his own
[1:23:57] kind and in due time he will manifest
[1:24:01] what he sold right so here this is why
[1:24:06] even the ministry in this last days as
[1:24:10] sowing the urgency that was going out a
[1:24:12] sowing that was going forth and many of
[1:24:15] the things you talked to different ones
[1:24:16] it's set right there when the seals were
[1:24:18] being opened and you hear it down
[1:24:19] through the message and he wouldn't even
[1:24:20] been that you had to hear from people
[1:24:22] who were there that could say I knew
[1:24:23] something great was going on but we
[1:24:25] didn't understand it at that time why
[1:24:26] not it wasn't time to understand but it
[1:24:31] was enough it was enough
[1:24:34] for the believers to know God's doing
[1:24:37] something what's he doing well we don't
[1:24:41] understand that but we know this you see
[1:24:46] this is where faith is I know this I
[1:24:48] don't understand that but I know this so
[1:24:53] then when we look at this
[1:24:54] he says that's all he said but the
[1:24:56] spiritual mind maybe they could not
[1:24:58] understand it those disciples they
[1:25:00] didn't know exactly what it meant but
[1:25:02] they believed it anyhow because where
[1:25:04] did it come from it come from the one
[1:25:06] they knowed to be the Son of God so why
[1:25:12] were they receiving it they knew it was
[1:25:14] God they knew it was the truth you
[1:25:18] weren't gonna move him from it
[1:25:19] I explained this to me I can't but I
[1:25:21] know it's the truth I might not be able
[1:25:26] to understand how I love this I may not
[1:25:29] be able to understand all that's in here
[1:25:30] but I believe it it's God's word I want
[1:25:36] to separate myself from anything that's
[1:25:38] contrary to it I've tried to stand like
[1:25:41] that now we realize that within this
[1:25:44] here at just said just beautiful things
[1:25:46] that you can look at it that rest itself
[1:25:48] it's not based on our understanding
[1:25:50] because our under with just the Aaron
[1:25:53] and our own understanding we can stumble
[1:25:55] if that's why our faith is that now you
[1:25:58] might say I kind of think this or I
[1:26:00] can't but I don't know nor do you know
[1:26:03] but it's when we rest in certain things
[1:26:07] and it don't happen according to how we
[1:26:11] think it's going to happen
[1:26:13] Oh Lord then it's like what's going on
[1:26:17] what's happening what's taking place I
[1:26:20] thought this great utopia I thought
[1:26:28] but their understanding was veiled you
[1:26:35] know is like somebody telling you how to
[1:26:37] drive a car and never drove a car
[1:26:40] remember they read and read the drivers
[1:26:42] manual you need to do this so many feet
[1:26:48] back here watch this year what is it
[1:26:50] that's wonderful but they just read the
[1:26:52] manual right did they they don't have an
[1:26:55] understanding by experience right it's
[1:27:00] just like with with anything else and
[1:27:01] understanding its Vail
[1:27:03] he is laying these scriptures concerning
[1:27:07] himself in suffering but yet they
[1:27:10] themselves their understanding is veiled
[1:27:13] to it why it's not their cup it's his
[1:27:17] cup he's got to drink his cup before
[1:27:22] they can drink their cup his suffering
[1:27:27] was his cut so we look at Matthew 26
[1:27:30] verse 37 the principal coming out that
[1:27:33] we can only and we will only understand
[1:27:36] as the Spirit of God will reveal it in
[1:27:38] the season and in the time it wasn't
[1:27:40] necessary I've got to know
[1:27:42] no it wasn't necessary at that time they
[1:27:45] just walked on in faith verse 37 and he
[1:27:50] took with him Peter and the two sons of
[1:27:52] Zebedee and began to be very sorrowful
[1:27:55] and very heavy then saith he unto them
[1:27:59] my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
[1:28:04] death tarry here and watch with me
[1:28:08] what's happening he's pouring out his
[1:28:11] soul unto death the pouring out of his
[1:28:15] soul did not take place just at Calvary
[1:28:18] he lived by the word and as it come to
[1:28:21] this time he's pouring out his soul it's
[1:28:25] a dying it's a giving forth
[1:28:27] it's a yielding of his life and he went
[1:28:31] a little further and fell on his face
[1:28:34] and prayed saying O my father if it be
[1:28:40] possible let this cup pass from me you
[1:28:44] know what he's praying for to dodge the
[1:28:47] cross those are the words the Prophet
[1:28:49] gives us he was praying to dodge the
[1:28:51] cross
[1:28:53] there wasn't that he didn't love the
[1:28:55] love the his father he did
[1:28:59] he was as obedient to the word
[1:29:02] but he's experiencing he knows what lays
[1:29:05] ahead of him this is not an act he
[1:29:08] cannot remember he cannot be made to go
[1:29:11] there if he's made to go there Satan
[1:29:14] would still have a claim I don't care if
[1:29:16] he's virgin born or not
[1:29:17] st. whenever claimed it said he did not
[1:29:19] go willingly
[1:29:20] so he's not the lamb because a lamb can
[1:29:24] be glad and remember Satan knows the
[1:29:27] word he was wearing like a lamb to the
[1:29:29] slaughter Satan could stand right there
[1:29:31] and say that's not him he's got to be
[1:29:36] willing what's going on right here it's
[1:29:39] the same thing within you and I when
[1:29:41] you've been born of the Spirit of God
[1:29:43] it's laying down our will for his will I
[1:29:47] tell you what when God is so moved
[1:29:50] within your life I tell you you come
[1:29:52] through that of the new birth you mature
[1:29:54] I'll tell you the greatest battle you
[1:29:56] look back and you look at things that
[1:29:57] God sanctifies you cleanse you and then
[1:29:59] it moves on the inside there are things
[1:30:01] that you go through and it's a
[1:30:03] contending with self it's what you know
[1:30:06] to be the word and remember obedience is
[1:30:08] not something that's easy obedience when
[1:30:12] obedience comes forth here is suffering
[1:30:14] that's involved and you learn obedience
[1:30:16] by the things you suffer things that you
[1:30:20] suffer and you go through that you don't
[1:30:22] understand what's taking place but yet
[1:30:25] you stand there and say lord I know
[1:30:27] you're in control Lord I know I belong
[1:30:30] to you what's happening learning
[1:30:32] obedience it's a price obedience isn't
[1:30:35] easy there's a cost Peter
[1:30:43] expert swordsman flips off the ear has
[1:30:47] the records there in John the Lord Jesus
[1:30:49] picks the back up puts it on I've always
[1:30:52] looked at that verse of scripture I
[1:30:53] thought was everybody else blind to what
[1:30:55] was going on I mean they just went
[1:30:58] around like business usual oh thank you
[1:31:00] appreciate that like some I hand you
[1:31:02] salt or pepper I mean here was a man no
[1:31:06] stitches
[1:31:07] his ear is put back on where they blind
[1:31:15] through it I don't know I don't know
[1:31:17] they were but then again maybe they
[1:31:20] weren't they could look at it with 20/20
[1:31:22] vision say huh but they were blind to
[1:31:27] what was going on they were blind to who
[1:31:29] who it was it was their remember it Paul
[1:31:31] said if they would have known this
[1:31:34] prints of life they would not have
[1:31:37] crucified him remember what Paul said if
[1:31:39] the world he took all of those religious
[1:31:42] men and he identified that there where
[1:31:45] they were act was of the world even
[1:31:47] though they had the Judaic customs and
[1:31:49] everything else that was laid out but
[1:31:51] the way their heart was in it that heart
[1:31:54] though they could carry her out a Bible
[1:31:56] and have great priestly robes but Paul
[1:31:59] identified as Jesus did when Jesus said
[1:32:02] that you're full of dead men's bones
[1:32:03] Paul could look right back around and
[1:32:05] call it of the world if they would have
[1:32:07] known it they would not have crucified
[1:32:08] the Prince of life what was it it's the
[1:32:10] same spirit that motivated Cain to take
[1:32:13] Abel's life it's the same spirit that's
[1:32:15] worked all the way down through the
[1:32:17] Gentile world powers
[1:32:19] it's that same spirit that's moved right
[1:32:20] through that a Roman Catholic system
[1:32:22] it's that same spirit that works that
[1:32:25] has worked before but one of these days
[1:32:30] he's been lettuce it's going to be
[1:32:32] taking another way and then the mystery
[1:32:35] of iniquity is going to be fully
[1:32:36] revealed I'm glad it's been revealed but
[1:32:39] I'm glad I won't be here for the
[1:32:40] manifestation aren't you I'm glad I've
[1:32:43] got a token out of here
[1:32:47] oh it end about fear and about being
[1:32:50] around that I just my lover's coming
[1:32:52] back for me the lover of my souls come
[1:32:56] there that's what it's all about it's
[1:32:57] about it's not about all that right
[1:32:58] there because if God look at if God had
[1:33:01] ordained when we you and I look he even
[1:33:02] said in his word John 16:33 that be of
[1:33:05] good cheer for I have overcome the world
[1:33:06] in this world you shall have tribulation
[1:33:09] you and I have our tribulation I try I
[1:33:12] suffering right now we're being proved
[1:33:14] out what's being proved of faith that is
[1:33:16] laying on the inside that's been raised
[1:33:19] by the Lord Jesus Christ himself right
[1:33:23] now we're drinking our cup and you know
[1:33:26] what it's the same cup it's just now
[1:33:31] that cup has been passed to you and I
[1:33:33] remember the mother of the sons of
[1:33:35] Zebedee asking that OMA Jesus had
[1:33:40] mentioned shall I not drink this cup
[1:33:44] sure I've got to drink it see how much
[1:33:51] time I got
[1:33:52] let's go to Luke 24 I may have just cut
[1:33:56] it off here
[1:34:09] Luke 24 verse 1
[1:34:15] let me just try to save just a little
[1:34:17] bit of time here and verse five those
[1:34:23] that he came to the Sepulcher says as
[1:34:25] they were afraid and bowed down their
[1:34:27] faces to the earth they said unto them
[1:34:30] why seek ye the living among the dead he
[1:34:34] is not here but risen remember how he
[1:34:40] spake unto you when he was yet in
[1:34:43] Galilee notice word that's already been
[1:34:47] sung he's calling the attention to the
[1:34:52] word that's already been given saying
[1:34:56] the Son of Man must be delivered into
[1:35:00] the hands of sinful men and be crucified
[1:35:04] and the third day rise again and they
[1:35:10] remembered his words it didn't say they
[1:35:16] didn't know his words they remembered
[1:35:19] him you see even to this time these
[1:35:23] words have been sown they didn't
[1:35:27] understand him still yet they don't
[1:35:30] understand them but they have faith in
[1:35:33] who he is right and they remember his
[1:35:40] words and returned from the sepulchre
[1:35:43] and told these things unto the eleven
[1:35:45] and to all the rest it was Mary
[1:35:49] Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother
[1:35:51] of James and other women that were with
[1:35:53] him which told these things unto the
[1:35:56] Apostles and their words seemed to them
[1:36:01] as idle tells
[1:36:04] and they believe them not
[1:36:10] how could they not believe them the veil
[1:36:18] of their understanding is still on it
[1:36:22] now it's being it's it's being opened
[1:36:25] but it's slowly he goes on to say then
[1:36:31] arose Peter and ran into the sepulchre
[1:36:34] and stooping down he beheld the linen
[1:36:37] clothes laid by themselves and departed
[1:36:40] wandering in himself at that which was
[1:36:45] come to past
[1:36:48] do you see Peters faith was not
[1:36:51] overthrown
[1:36:53] the Lord Jesus had already prayed that
[1:36:56] his faith fail not he didn't know what
[1:37:02] was going on yes he did not him thrice
[1:37:04] but Peter you could not get that out of
[1:37:06] Peter what was already in him he wasn't
[1:37:09] born again yet but remember it was not
[1:37:12] natural man Peter looking at the Lord
[1:37:15] Jesus said thou art the Christ no it was
[1:37:19] that representation on the inside that
[1:37:24] spoke out at that time that was
[1:37:26] necessary do you realize that is what
[1:37:29] was necessary at that moment thou art
[1:37:32] the Christ and Peter ran he looks in and
[1:37:36] he's wondering
[1:37:37] he's wondering and what he's seen two of
[1:37:44] them that day same day they went through
[1:37:49] a village called Emmaus
[1:37:51] which was from Jerusalem about
[1:37:53] threescore fallings
[1:37:57] this should have been at Jerusalem this
[1:38:02] should have stayed at Jerusalem but the
[1:38:06] prophecy said the Shepherd is going to
[1:38:09] be smitten and the sheep is going to be
[1:38:11] scattered john 16:32 every man to his
[1:38:15] own you see at this time when they could
[1:38:18] not see the fulfillment and what was
[1:38:21] taking place
[1:38:24] they went back to what they knew but
[1:38:28] they didn't go back to the
[1:38:29] organization's you as me they went back
[1:38:33] Peter said I go fishing they were
[1:38:36] discouraged they were disheartened
[1:38:40] they had it seemed like a letdown
[1:38:43] and it's been instead of it they were
[1:38:47] going away from Jerusalem
[1:38:50] but the Lord Jesus isn't worried after
[1:38:58] I'm rinsing again I'm gonna go before
[1:39:02] you into Galilee
[1:39:04] do you realize he wasn't just talking
[1:39:07] about a person going before him in the
[1:39:09] Galilee he was speaking of the word that
[1:39:12] has been fulfilled he's going to lead
[1:39:15] you to the place you need to be not a
[1:39:21] feeling but the word will eat you and
[1:39:25] they went to Emmaus which was from
[1:39:27] Jerusalem about threescore furlings and
[1:39:30] they talked together of all these things
[1:39:33] which had happened and it came to pass
[1:39:36] that while they commune together and
[1:39:39] reasoned Jesus himself drew near and
[1:39:44] went with him here was one thing that
[1:39:48] they were doing that was good
[1:39:52] remember said what they had about in the
[1:39:55] midst of all their disheartening in the
[1:39:57] midst of all their discouragement one
[1:39:59] thing that they had that was right was
[1:40:02] their conversation now you know Jesus
[1:40:05] wasn't going to show up on negative
[1:40:07] conversation hello somebody Jesus wasn't
[1:40:11] going to show up on that you said they
[1:40:12] were sad they were sad but they were
[1:40:15] still talking about him when they
[1:40:20] witnessed he indeed this is what he did
[1:40:23] everything they were still talking about
[1:40:26] him do you realize them talking about
[1:40:28] him caused him to draw near that's why
[1:40:34] the presence of God will always come
[1:40:36] where the word is being preached and the
[1:40:39] word is received he will come and draw
[1:40:43] near and make himself known according to
[1:40:46] the word he will answer questions he
[1:40:49] will dissolve doubts he will cast out
[1:40:52] Devils he will clean up the unclean
[1:40:54] he will sanctified but unclean he will
[1:40:57] fill up those that are empty and reveal
[1:41:00] those that are in need of an every
[1:41:02] feeling he will always come where he's
[1:41:05] welcome that's why it's important even
[1:41:10] when we are coming to the house of God
[1:41:12] then we're not coming lickety-split oh
[1:41:14] don't get quiet on me now when don't
[1:41:18] just show up as a dude it was time to go
[1:41:19] to church well we're coming here to hear
[1:41:25] from God it's important to you in your
[1:41:28] daily walk it's important to entertain
[1:41:31] him it's important to have him on your
[1:41:34] mind well I'll do when I get time no let
[1:41:38] him redeem the time and you can't redeem
[1:41:42] nothing without a sacrifice and in order
[1:41:45] to redeem it it can't just be any
[1:41:46] sacrifice the book of Malachi it said
[1:41:50] you're bringing me lame blind all these
[1:41:53] sacrifices it says you go offer the
[1:41:55] governor that sacrifice you see if
[1:41:56] you'll take that you're gonna preach
[1:41:59] with me see if he'll receive that but
[1:42:02] you want to bring that to the house of
[1:42:04] the Lord like when I'm
[1:42:05] my sacrifice God you just received it
[1:42:07] God won't receive no lame no blind no
[1:42:10] halt he only receives the sacrifice of
[1:42:13] himself and alive that is willing to
[1:42:17] surrender itself to him and let him be
[1:42:20] Lord one of the great signs of a
[1:42:23] believer is a sacrificial life and I'm
[1:42:27] not talking about taking fruit baskets
[1:42:28] to the poor anybody can do that that's
[1:42:32] religion I'm talking about a lot better
[1:42:34] set aside as a vessel of Honor that's
[1:42:37] been redeemed where the fire of God
[1:42:39] dwells in that vessel and makes his
[1:42:42] glory know through that life and that
[1:42:44] life works in harmony with Almighty God
[1:42:47] with the pulsation of his presence on
[1:42:49] the inside and when this presence is
[1:42:51] dwelling on the inside that vessel on
[1:42:54] the inside will reflect the glory of God
[1:42:56] that's down on the inside it are
[1:42:58] reflected as a chosen vessel that is not
[1:43:01] conformed to the world but it's
[1:43:03] transformed by the renewing of the mind
[1:43:05] and it actually will be a lot that will
[1:43:07] actually sacrifice its own will for his
[1:43:10] will this the Lord Jesus has drawn near
[1:43:17] to them talking with them they got the
[1:43:21] right conversation I believe this is
[1:43:23] what a a great portrayal for us I don't
[1:43:27] believe this is just Scripture we're
[1:43:30] reading I don't believe this scripture
[1:43:31] here is just Scripture that's being
[1:43:33] fulfilled in this hour I believe that
[1:43:36] this scripture right here is a daily
[1:43:38] expression that there are things that
[1:43:42] sometimes you cannot make the ends meet
[1:43:49] but you've got to trust him
[1:43:55] let me find a place in here to stop
[1:43:57] though we'll just go to squid today
[1:44:02] while they commune together and reasoned
[1:44:07] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[1:44:12] them he knows they don't understand he
[1:44:18] knows they don't understand
[1:44:20] but he's drawing near because he's the
[1:44:23] one the only one that can help them to
[1:44:27] understand and they understand the
[1:44:31] understanding is faith in who he is what
[1:44:35] he has fulfilled because what he has
[1:44:38] fulfilled is a necessary piece to what
[1:44:43] he's going to fulfill in them and
[1:44:45] through them must an
[1:44:55] the Bible says but their eyes were
[1:45:00] hoping that they should not know him
[1:45:08] there was a veil over their eyes they
[1:45:11] were looking at him it was not like
[1:45:15] comparing pictures like they put up
[1:45:17] missing persons and they tried to you
[1:45:20] know move in ahead by years and this is
[1:45:22] what they probably look like now
[1:45:24] no a veil was upon them their eyes their
[1:45:30] heart they didn't they didn't realize
[1:45:34] what had taken place and he said unto
[1:45:42] them what manner of communications are
[1:45:46] these that you have one to another as
[1:45:50] you walk and are sad there's not one of
[1:45:55] us that has not experienced sadness
[1:45:59] disappointments discouragements it's not
[1:46:03] one if God Terry's no it's not maybe a
[1:46:07] positive thing but yet it's a reality we
[1:46:11] will experience sadness and
[1:46:13] discouragement but if we can apply
[1:46:16] what's taking place right here it'll
[1:46:19] give us victory when sadness comes what
[1:46:25] is that listen start thinking about him
[1:46:29] start talking about him
[1:46:32] maybe it's a song that comes to you that
[1:46:36] you start singing and it's about him and
[1:46:40] you'll find that his presence it'll draw
[1:46:44] near it doesn't mean that you'll
[1:46:46] understand it right then but his
[1:46:52] presence will draw near the whole time
[1:46:54] that he walked with them on the road he
[1:46:57] was opening the scriptures
[1:46:59] but it was until he was invited in that
[1:47:03] they knew it was him then they sell
[1:47:06] didn't own our hearts burn within us as
[1:47:09] he opened to us the scriptures along the
[1:47:16] way but you see they invited him about
[1:47:21] their conversation
[1:47:22] it's like things sometimes you maybe
[1:47:24] you've gone through certain things
[1:47:25] physically sometimes with the surgery
[1:47:28] whatever it might be other things that
[1:47:30] you go through maybe it's financial
[1:47:31] whatever it is but friends this is not
[1:47:34] this is not a self-help session this is
[1:47:37] reality David said when all the rest of
[1:47:40] them rose up at Z after zig lakh and
[1:47:42] they rose up to kill him his own people
[1:47:44] right around him David said he
[1:47:47] encouraged himself in the Lord he
[1:47:53] encouraged himself I think it's
[1:47:57] wonderful we can have encouragement from
[1:47:59] one another I believe that's what the
[1:48:00] scripture admonished us comfort you one
[1:48:03] another with these words but there are
[1:48:07] some times of things that we go through
[1:48:10] if you let your thoughts go and keep
[1:48:12] going and keep going and keep going
[1:48:14] you'll find yourself moving from sad to
[1:48:18] a very sad very low state what do I have
[1:48:23] to do just start thinking about him
[1:48:28] thank you Jesus
[1:48:31] are you wonderful you don't have to get
[1:48:34] up and you know recite a whole doxology
[1:48:37] and get up in prayer God don't want you
[1:48:39] to act he just want you to be who you
[1:48:44] are this is so simple it's so simple but
[1:48:49] what a formula that it is that lays here
[1:48:51] one of the great mysteries of redemption
[1:48:53] redemption itself is opening parts are
[1:48:56] being unfolded right here regarding
[1:48:59] Redemption Lord willing we'll go into it
[1:49:01] next week folds are being open that they
[1:49:04] don't even understand because Redemption
[1:49:06] itself comes in a three-fold manner and
[1:49:08] they themselves are not aware of any of
[1:49:13] the faults they don't understand it they
[1:49:14] say we thought he should be a redeemer
[1:49:16] they're wanting him to manifest the
[1:49:19] third fold of redemption but you can't
[1:49:22] he cannot do it without the first two
[1:49:24] folds they made manifest
[1:49:27] Lord willing will speak on the next
[1:49:29] weekend they don't know they're looking
[1:49:34] for these things they're sad but they
[1:49:37] just start talking about him anybody
[1:49:40] know I'm talking about times where you
[1:49:43] just say Lord I love you appreciate you
[1:49:46] thank you lord
[1:49:48] maybe some sort of a thought comes your
[1:49:50] way what I do say thank you lord I
[1:49:52] praise your Lord Lord how wonderful you
[1:49:56] are it's not mind over matter this is
[1:50:01] reality
[1:50:02] I want him to draw near and you find
[1:50:06] within that you might be busy in what
[1:50:08] you're doing having everything laid out
[1:50:10] before you in your job and doing this
[1:50:12] maybe I'm putting the biscuits in the
[1:50:14] oven or whatever it is that you're doing
[1:50:17] but you find his presence will draw
[1:50:20] right near and he'll just drop a little
[1:50:24] something in your heart say thank you
[1:50:27] Lord that means so much Lord but do you
[1:50:31] understand no I don't understand but I
[1:50:32] know it's him I've recognized his
[1:50:36] presence when he comes
[1:50:39] how did he'll make himself know what you
[1:50:44] love you this is victory over
[1:50:47] discouragement they don't know they
[1:50:50] don't know it isn't they have a formula
[1:50:51] Road out but what they do know see what
[1:50:54] it is something has grabbed ahold of
[1:50:56] them they didn't want to go back to tax
[1:50:59] collection they didn't want to go back
[1:51:00] to fishing but they didn't have a
[1:51:03] shepherd leadership to know what to do
[1:51:07] next but he told him after I'm risen
[1:51:11] alcohol before you I the Shepherd will
[1:51:15] come gather my sheep I will not leave
[1:51:19] you comfortless glory be to God let's
[1:51:26] pray or Jesus we love you Lord this
[1:51:34] morning
[1:51:37] father the depths needs or that we have
[1:51:44] Lord before us things that Lord that you
[1:51:50] don't look at and just say all that
[1:51:51] simple
[1:51:53] the father I'm so thankful you you help
[1:51:57] us Lord a great thing has taken place in
[1:52:02] the life of these disciples as far as an
[1:52:04] event they're not able to explain it
[1:52:10] they don't understand as a matter of
[1:52:12] fact as a fulfillment of Matthew 26 Lord
[1:52:16] that we read in the opening chapter
[1:52:18] they're offended they've stumbled
[1:52:22] there's been an impediment in the way
[1:52:25] but father as you gave the word you come
[1:52:29] right back around and you make known the
[1:52:33] word that has been sowed and that word
[1:52:36] was already sold it was laid out by the
[1:52:38] prophets all the way down then here was
[1:52:41] that word itself here came the wonderful
[1:52:44] filmin it's soda ghin the son of man
[1:52:46] shall suffer they didn't understand it
[1:52:49] Lord I believe Lord God this service and
[1:52:53] last service you're really trying to
[1:52:55] tell us something Lord not something
[1:52:58] that's so deep and profound that we
[1:53:00] don't already realize maybe but we just
[1:53:03] need to need it to become more more
[1:53:06] personal that it's not about what I
[1:53:09] understand Lord the phrase I took that
[1:53:13] Lord on a study and the message I don't
[1:53:15] understand
[1:53:16] oh my
[1:53:18] just to let alone all through the
[1:53:20] message Lord how the Prophet goes in to
[1:53:23] certain things saying I don't understand
[1:53:25] even when it comes into the message lean
[1:53:27] not to your own understanding he goes
[1:53:29] right through it Lord
[1:53:35] to me this is a comfort I believe it is
[1:53:40] to all of us Lord as a believer it shows
[1:53:42] you're working in our lives it's not
[1:53:44] about what I understand as far as in my
[1:53:47] mind it's to understand you Lord to know
[1:53:53] you like the disciple says we know this
[1:53:58] Howard the Christ as far as the trials
[1:54:01] the troubles the afflictions all these
[1:54:03] things as your prophet said all this
[1:54:05] stuff you're talking about we don't
[1:54:06] understand that but we know this father
[1:54:11] this morning if there is any Lord under
[1:54:16] the sound of my voice that doesn't know
[1:54:19] this by way of the new birth may they
[1:54:23] know this or they don't understand they
[1:54:29] live maybe can look Lord a pad of being
[1:54:32] born again and don't understand but lord
[1:54:34] may they little God have faith to know
[1:54:38] faith that's drawing them Lord to rest
[1:54:40] and say Lord I believe that you are my
[1:54:45] shepherd and I'm one of your sheep I
[1:54:49] believe Lord that this is for me Lord
[1:54:54] I believe in Lord God may that faith
[1:54:59] Lord God within him Lord it may not be
[1:55:01] this moment that they'll receive it it
[1:55:03] might be Lord God in some time today
[1:55:05] tomorrow whenever but they can stand up
[1:55:07] on that word Lord God by faith Lord
[1:55:11] Jesus and you will make it personal and
[1:55:15] real to them it will unfold itself in
[1:55:19] their life Granite Lloyd father lives
[1:55:27] Lord hearts Lord those of us Lord God
[1:55:31] that's been born again yet Lord many
[1:55:35] things in our life we don't understand
[1:55:41] many things we cannot explain what as
[1:55:46] you told us last week Lord through the
[1:55:48] quote some order the message that
[1:55:50] anything we can perfectly explain is no
[1:55:52] longer faith
[1:55:56] your profit goes on and on telling us
[1:55:58] that if we can understand it then we
[1:56:00] don't need faith faith is not something
[1:56:03] Lord God that is blind but faith itself
[1:56:07] is not the natural eyes of man faith is
[1:56:10] the eyes of God it's faith that moves in
[1:56:15] our heart that though we see not all
[1:56:17] things as yet but we are witness all
[1:56:20] things are under our feet Lord right
[1:56:24] here sitting in this building standing
[1:56:26] here right now believers lives and
[1:56:28] hearts Lord God that father you're
[1:56:30] molding and moving into things our Lord
[1:56:32] desiring to see and though Lord not
[1:56:34] seeing all things yet but father from
[1:56:37] that soul can say Lord you have freely
[1:56:41] given me all things I can believe you
[1:56:48] Brannen Lord
[1:56:51] I think of how your profit would place
[1:56:53] it over and over he's asking questions
[1:56:57] and answers on the seals do you know
[1:56:59] your name is there he said I don't know
[1:57:02] but I believe it's there believing is
[1:57:06] greater than knowing you O Lord God
[1:57:13] faith faith does not explain faith is
[1:57:17] not something of mental understanding
[1:57:18] faith is an expression of a life
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:29] lord
[1:57:32] for each need right now Lord I pray
[1:57:35] father may our faith as believers Lord
[1:57:41] may it rest in you Lloyd Lord one of
[1:57:47] these days one of these days in a moment
[1:57:50] and at wrinkling twinkling of an eye
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] will be changed your prophet tells us
[1:57:59] Lord in the Pergamon age that when we
[1:58:01] get on the other side
[1:58:02] he said revelation will still be
[1:58:05] unfolded in that time he told us in that
[1:58:09] moment in that same quote things that we
[1:58:12] have wondered not understood questions
[1:58:17] it'll be answered then Lord God has
[1:58:21] believers it shows we don't have to
[1:58:24] understand and know everything that's no
[1:58:26] longer believers we're believers because
[1:58:28] we believe and the reason we believe is
[1:58:31] because we're believers and we're
[1:58:34] believers because we believe
[1:58:39] help us Lord
[1:58:42] you prove your word by believers may we
[1:58:46] Lord God like these disciples invite you
[1:58:50] our conversations our thoughts then it
[1:58:56] would be a conversation that you'll draw
[1:58:59] near

[1:59:05] talking help us Father forgive us the
[1:59:08] Lord God for those negative confessions

[1:59:47] Enoch got closer to that place than what
[1:59:51] he was to home
[1:59:52] and that quickening power that was
[1:59:55] already upon Enochs life it just
[1:59:57] transported him right on into that
[2:00:00] presence remember when the Lord came on
[2:00:05] the scene down there in Genesis 18 where
[2:00:08] the RAM tells us what took place in the
[2:00:10] tent that morning he said was a fuss
[2:00:12] between Abraham and Sarah that morning
[2:00:14] he said what it was Sarah got to talking
[2:00:17] about some of the fashions and dresses
[2:00:18] that she just seen passed through in
[2:00:20] that Caravan
[2:00:21] but Abraham stood and said don't you get
[2:00:24] your eyes on those fashions on the
[2:00:26] things of the world he said what it was
[2:00:27] Sarah did not realize there was another
[2:00:29] Caravan that was on its way but you see
[2:00:35] what it was Abraham would not allow the
[2:00:37] fashion of the world to dominate his
[2:00:40] home in his life I'm not just talking
[2:00:42] about clothing and dress I'm talking
[2:00:45] about we don't go away and along with

[2:02:48] Satan's seat was that they labored all
[2:02:51] the more so souls were one right there
