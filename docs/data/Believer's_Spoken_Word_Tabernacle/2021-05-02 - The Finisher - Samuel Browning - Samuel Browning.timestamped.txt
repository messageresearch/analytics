[35:06] lives we're not
[35:08] we're not quoting of something of
[35:10] history
[35:11] we know that by an experience amen that
[35:14] he is
[35:15] he is alive it's not a story we've been
[35:18] told
[35:19] it's a reality that's in our lives
[35:21] there's a testimony because
[35:23] we have raised amen in our own self
[35:27] we've raised it's raised us from the
[35:30] deadness of the life
[35:31] and the world of where we walk and he's
[35:34] raised us into the real
[35:35] newness of life amen we're so thankful
[35:39] to god for that reality
[35:41] amen i'd rather have that than anything
[35:43] else in the world
[35:44] amen because with that i'm more than a
[35:47] conqueror
[35:49] no matter what comes our way we're we
[35:51] are
[35:52] more than a match for whatever it is
[35:54] that comes our way
[35:56] as paul could write we gain a surpassing
[35:59] victory in everything you believe that
[36:02] this morning
[36:04] amen i want to just uh mention to you we
[36:08] had prayer here for
[36:10] brother samson shetty on thursday night
[36:14] with his for his mother and his
[36:17] brother-in-law
[36:18] and i just spoke with him we had texts
[36:22] and things like that regarding it
[36:24] and they're still dealing with it is
[36:26] mother
[36:28] she's at home now uh she's still dealing
[36:31] with
[36:32] the covid a lot of the symptoms and
[36:35] things like that
[36:36] and so she's at home and now
[36:40] so and he asked that we would just
[36:41] continue to keep not only
[36:44] his mother in prayer his brother-in-law
[36:47] that has dealt with just some paralysis
[36:50] from a stroke
[36:51] but also all the ministers and the
[36:54] believers there
[36:55] in india he asked that we would just
[36:57] just continue to keep them in prayer
[36:59] so we just want to we just want to
[37:02] remember them in prayer
[37:05] different ones around the world i think
[37:08] of many
[37:09] many places you know that
[37:12] some sometimes you don't even realize
[37:15] just how privileged that we
[37:16] are that we can come to the house of god
[37:20] because we're living and i thank god for
[37:23] that here of america
[37:25] the where that we still have we have a
[37:27] choice
[37:28] it's not like it is even in the nation
[37:31] right above north of us here for
[37:33] months they can't go to church at all
[37:36] it's
[37:36] it and it's just it's just a very sad
[37:39] thing
[37:40] and we're living in a time in an hour
[37:44] that fear is soaked grip
[37:47] upon the hearts of people
[37:50] and we've said it over and over but it
[37:52] depends on
[37:54] in this hour this is a time that when we
[37:57] look at everything we want our we want
[37:59] our attention to be
[38:01] upon that which builds strength it's
[38:04] reality
[38:05] it builds faith within our life because
[38:08] whatever you look at
[38:09] or you give yourself to it doesn't come
[38:13] without spirit are you with me
[38:16] whatever you give yourself to it it can
[38:19] start
[38:20] to dominate your life and these are
[38:22] things that within these
[38:24] parts of it that in this hour
[38:27] we we just want to just absorb
[38:30] from god in this hour god has given us
[38:33] the strength
[38:34] he's given us leadership in this hour
[38:38] amen and so we thank god for that i want
[38:41] you just to continue to remember
[38:43] the different saints of god in prayer
[38:47] also i did not have a chance an
[38:49] opportunity
[38:52] that to be able to show you but
[38:55] when i went to north carolina
[38:59] thanking musicians i won't hold you here
[39:01] any longer
[39:03] when i went to north carolina there the
[39:04] first week of
[39:05] [Music]
[39:09] april and when i went there
[39:13] i i had actually had on my heart for
[39:15] some time because we're
[39:16] things that we're looking at from the
[39:18] missions here
[39:20] within the church and certain things
[39:21] certain operations that we had been
[39:26] behind and looking at i really haven't
[39:28] had any responses from those
[39:30] areas and so i'm not exactly sure where
[39:32] those are at right now with the books
[39:34] and things
[39:34] but what i can tell you is is that when
[39:36] i went there to
[39:38] north carolina i took i took with me a
[39:41] check for four thousand dollars
[39:43] and put that in the hands of brother
[39:45] barry coffey
[39:46] because of the work that is going on
[39:49] right now
[39:50] with books being printed because there
[39:52] is such a need for books in these other
[39:54] countries
[39:56] they do not have the tablets
[39:59] don't work those things do not it
[40:02] doesn't work out there
[40:03] among these places they they it doesn't
[40:05] work they they
[40:06] they need books it just doesn't work i
[40:09] mean we can look
[40:10] at it here and think well a tablet
[40:11] should work and this and that it doesn't
[40:13] work
[40:13] when you get out into those other places
[40:16] very remote
[40:17] and so they had asked even a few years
[40:18] ago and and brother barry
[40:20] we've had things out here that has been
[40:23] laid out as far as
[40:25] within uh i don't want to say a magazine
[40:27] but it's been a pamphlet
[40:29] and they themselves any brother berry
[40:31] had expressed me said every time brother
[40:33] samuel when there's been a request
[40:34] that's come in
[40:35] he said i've just i've moved by faith on
[40:37] it and we're talking
[40:38] of projects that thousands of dollars at
[40:42] a time
[40:42] getting bibles and getting books printed
[40:45] and
[40:46] brother barry some of you don't know
[40:47] this but brother barry from way back was
[40:49] very instrumental in the very early
[40:52] stages of the message of getting the
[40:54] books in the hands of the people
[40:56] because he himself is a is a printer and
[40:59] so
[40:59] they've worked collaboratively
[41:01] collaboratively with another brother and
[41:03] they actually are
[41:04] getting books printed the church age
[41:07] book that brother george smith you know
[41:08] had re had
[41:09] had revised as far as to space things
[41:12] out in that church age book
[41:14] and it to me i want to share with you
[41:17] pictures because i'm on a thread that
[41:19] goes
[41:20] a thread that covers pastors not only
[41:23] here but also in
[41:24] places around the world and when you see
[41:26] these people
[41:27] standing there in zimbabwe you see them
[41:30] see them in honduras
[41:31] nicaragua you see them where they here
[41:34] they are receiving a shipment of
[41:35] books and they are praying over those
[41:38] books and you see them start just
[41:40] dancing and just rejoicing i watched
[41:43] there's a group in zimbabwe they were
[41:45] handed
[41:45] bibles because they didn't even have
[41:48] bibles
[41:49] and to have message books put into their
[41:52] hands
[41:53] it's it's a need you and i don't see
[41:56] that part of it because we have so much
[41:58] access to so many things here
[42:00] there's the need for the books and the
[42:02] things there so on behalf of the
[42:04] assembly through the missions part of it
[42:05] i took just
[42:06] a just a small part of that there and
[42:08] and i really felt on my heart that we
[42:11] need to
[42:12] this vision that god has put and there's
[42:14] there's just
[42:16] i know there's churches and different
[42:17] ones also just just funneling behind
[42:20] just to really support this vision
[42:22] and it's going forward and i actually i
[42:24] actually looked at some of the books
[42:25] that are pla
[42:26] printed in the other languages i sat
[42:28] there in the office and
[42:30] my heart just rejoices when i see that
[42:33] that the word is
[42:34] is being put there and i hope to share
[42:36] some of these things with you
[42:38] in the future where you see the brothers
[42:40] like there was a picture
[42:41] in colombia brother george smith was
[42:43] just in colombia where a shipment was
[42:45] received on the dock
[42:47] and then getting it into the people's
[42:48] hands and i want you to keep this in
[42:50] prayer because a lot of
[42:52] a lot of a lot of things takes place
[42:55] between getting it from
[42:56] when it lands at the dock brother barry
[42:58] described it
[42:59] it lands right here but just to get it
[43:01] to where paul is setting
[43:02] that's money that's money
[43:06] to get it from here just just to right
[43:07] there that's money and so
[43:10] you just pray that god would just you
[43:12] know continue because
[43:14] it's been a real smooth thing and god
[43:16] has opened up the doors
[43:18] and you know in certain places like when
[43:19] you take like russia and other places
[43:21] like that that's so tightened down
[43:23] but god has made a way so that a lot of
[43:26] the printing and things that needs to be
[43:28] done in there
[43:29] it's being done inside so we're not
[43:32] you know it's not a lot of worrying of
[43:33] those things that's coming in there like
[43:35] that or from other places
[43:37] so there's a lot of work that's being
[43:40] done and i i want to show you because
[43:42] you're
[43:43] that's your giving that you're giving
[43:45] you're a part of that with what's going
[43:47] on in the missions and i want you to see
[43:49] that because
[43:50] uh to see those things that are taking
[43:52] place and i can tell you that's
[43:54] it's just a you know just a small part
[43:56] but i wanted to stand behind that
[43:58] and i believe we do as a church to see
[44:00] that this that message and the bibles
[44:03] are getting out into people's hands and
[44:05] it's just a real something they're
[44:07] really rejoicing in
[44:09] i also want to remind you if you would
[44:12] to keep brother joshua in prayer brother
[44:15] josue
[44:16] this coming uh he's not here he's in
[44:19] kentucky here
[44:20] this weekend but he has the lord willing
[44:23] on this coming
[44:24] wednesday when i had spoke with him
[44:27] the other day this coming wednesday
[44:30] brother joshua is going to be having
[44:32] surgery on his leg so it's been a it's
[44:35] been a process it's been a long time
[44:37] they've had to wait on certain things to
[44:40] with the part and and really is it honed
[44:43] in is it just right you know and coming
[44:45] from have they got
[44:46] as the manufacturer in different ones
[44:47] are they honed in on it so
[44:49] all of those things we know that
[44:50] everything is in god's time
[44:53] and you know we know this sometimes
[44:54] things don't come according to our
[44:56] timeline and we get our hearts set on
[44:58] things and it doesn't happen in that
[44:59] time
[45:00] but remember god is in control
[45:05] and so these are just some of the things
[45:08] when we've just
[45:08] prayed about that and looked at it and i
[45:10] want you to keep brother joshua in
[45:12] prayer because lord willing this coming
[45:13] wednesday
[45:14] and i had asked him would it be okay to
[45:16] mention the church and he does he wants
[45:17] you to stand
[45:18] and pray with him for for wednesday that
[45:21] we would just
[45:22] also be with him the other thing i want
[45:26] to mention in regards to missions and i
[45:28] don't mean to take up some time
[45:30] at the time but there's nobody else
[45:33] this is part of pastoral duties but
[45:35] brother daniel
[45:36] uh from from ghana west africa and you
[45:39] know brother daniel
[45:40] there's a need that he texts me about
[45:42] and brother let me just give you a
[45:43] little background brother
[45:45] daniel is never a brother that's ever
[45:47] asked me
[45:48] for one thing i've had individual
[45:51] a lot of these brothers they it's very
[45:53] rare that they've ever asked me for one
[45:55] thing
[45:56] and then i've had people i don't know
[45:57] from from adam that's all of a sudden
[46:00] they've sent me an email here or there
[46:02] and this and that and you know what i do
[46:04] with those things
[46:06] i pray about it but i have individuals
[46:08] that i know of in other countries that i
[46:10] say
[46:10] who is this person because you have
[46:13] checkpoint you have czech people you
[46:14] know because
[46:15] anybody can throw around lingo and and
[46:18] everything else you know
[46:19] so at any rate with brother daniel
[46:23] they had purchased a piece of property
[46:26] uh
[46:26] years ago but when they purchased that
[46:29] piece of property there were certain
[46:31] logistics and things that really came
[46:33] about that they
[46:34] never could build on that property
[46:38] and there were certain things he said
[46:39] that you know he said some things that
[46:41] weren't checked all the way out
[46:43] and so they never able to build on it
[46:45] where they are
[46:46] currently meeting they're renting and
[46:49] they're only able to have service once a
[46:52] week
[46:53] so you know how it is when you're under
[46:54] a situation of renting
[46:57] you're you're at whatever they say and
[47:00] it has nothing to do with the covet it's
[47:01] just simply that this is how it's been
[47:03] so brother daniel has asked he's if he
[47:06] asked he said
[47:07] samuel if there's any way that you could
[47:09] help their they're looking at securing
[47:13] a property over there so that they can
[47:15] uh
[47:16] build a place of worship so i told
[47:18] brother daniel i said i will bring that
[47:20] before the congregation we'll
[47:23] we'll look at what you know we have and
[47:24] i wanted you to pray about it you just
[47:26] you give us unto the lord and what we'll
[47:29] just try to do here over
[47:30] over the time uh brother richard is
[47:32] there is it just go right in that box
[47:34] back there is it just mark missions on
[47:36] there is that what it is
[47:38] okay so if you just mark missions on it
[47:40] and you put it there in the box so that
[47:42] and i think that's what's been happening
[47:44] with things anyhow even
[47:45] when you mark missions on it it goes
[47:47] strictly it goes straight into the
[47:49] missions and the
[47:49] and and the account there and and so
[47:52] let's just
[47:53] let's pray about that we want we want to
[47:55] be a blessing
[47:56] uh you know and and we just we just want
[48:00] to be a blessing as i know brother
[48:01] daniel it's
[48:02] when it's something that just to have
[48:05] that and have that
[48:06] been where they're able to meet and and
[48:08] those things so if you just pray about
[48:09] that and then
[48:10] over the course uh let's say maybe of
[48:13] this month because we're just starting
[48:14] into the month of may and then
[48:16] perhaps by the first part of june and
[48:18] brother richard you can keep me right on
[48:20] that part of it
[48:21] that perhaps then by the first part of
[48:23] june we'll we'll be ready
[48:24] uh to to see what house what we can we
[48:28] we can be able to send over there and
[48:30] we'll do that so i'll let brother daniel
[48:32] know about that is that okay so
[48:35] just be in prayer about that i'll try to
[48:37] keep you reminded of that and i will
[48:39] also show pictures here of things that
[48:42] that's going on

[52:08] amen amen i'm going to invite you to the
[52:11] scriptures in john
[52:12] chapter 19.
[52:22] just been a subject here that
[52:25] or a thought i should say that has been
[52:28] on my heart for just
[52:31] i don't know i'd say months and just how
[52:34] the inspiration of the lord just come
[52:36] and
[52:37] i won't always i pray that he'll help me
[52:39] to get out of the way that it can just
[52:41] come the way that he brought it and he
[52:43] could bring it to us in john
[52:46] 19 30 and i always love because you
[52:48] don't know what he's going to do when he
[52:50] comes
[52:51] and that's what i always i love that
[52:54] john 19
[52:55] 30 when jesus therefore had received the
[52:58] vinegar
[52:59] he said it is finished
[53:02] and he bowed his head and gave up
[53:06] the ghost if you turn with me to
[53:08] revelations chapter 1
[53:09] and verse 8
[53:13] here we find john on the isle of patmos
[53:16] and
[53:16] here is being revealed the coming of the
[53:20] lord
[53:21] now we know that the coming that was
[53:24] promised
[53:25] when the lord jesus even before he was
[53:28] here and then it's just going away he
[53:30] said if i go away
[53:32] i will send the comforter to you so
[53:34] there is a
[53:35] coming of that same life that lived and
[53:38] operated
[53:40] in the body of jesus christ that same
[53:42] jesus
[53:43] would come and would now take upon
[53:47] the body of his church in revelations 1
[53:50] 8
[53:51] i am alpha and omega
[53:55] the beginning and the ending
[53:58] saith the lord which is which was
[54:02] and which is to come the almighty
[54:05] verse 17 and when i saw him
[54:09] i fell at his feet as dead
[54:12] and he laid his right hand upon me
[54:14] saying unto me
[54:16] fear not i am the first and the last
[54:20] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[54:23] behold i am alive forevermore
[54:26] amen and have the keys of hell
[54:29] and of death amen may god bless the
[54:33] reading of his word as you're being
[54:34] seated
[54:36] i'd like to speak this morning on a
[54:38] thought
[54:39] just simply titled the finisher
[54:42] the finisher when you
[54:46] think of how that the lord jesus when he
[54:48] was here
[54:51] upon the upon the upon the earth and
[54:54] many didn't know who he was
[54:58] it was very strange to them it shouldn't
[55:01] have been but
[55:02] it was very strange to them it and yet
[55:06] when he
[55:06] stood there he in matthew 16 he's
[55:10] asking of the disciples who do men
[55:13] say that i the son of man am
[55:17] and he's asking them in many they're
[55:20] they're rehearsing of what many had said
[55:23] some say you're jeremiah some say or
[55:26] isaias and on and on and on they
[55:29] the people knew there was something
[55:32] different about this man called jesus
[55:36] they didn't know exactly what it was but
[55:40] they knew there's something
[55:41] different about this rabbi there's
[55:44] something
[55:45] different about this teacher there's
[55:47] something
[55:48] different about him than others
[55:52] they could now when jesus asked them
[55:55] this question
[55:56] then you find where peter will express
[55:59] and here's the very
[56:01] depth of what is inside of peter this is
[56:03] beyond
[56:04] peter's capacity his mind this is not
[56:07] his intellect that's responding here
[56:11] it's that seed that god had
[56:14] sown in peter's life and here
[56:17] in the presence of the living word of
[56:21] god
[56:21] the seed just expresses
[56:25] who it is that is standing there
[56:28] before him and he says this says
[56:31] thou art the christ the son of the
[56:34] living god
[56:35] and the lord jesus said blessed art thou
[56:37] simon barjona
[56:38] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[56:41] unto thee but my father which is in
[56:43] heaven
[56:44] and here's what he said i will say also
[56:47] unto thee
[56:48] that thou art peter and upon
[56:51] this rock i will build my church
[56:54] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[56:58] against it now notice the announcement
[57:02] i'm going to build my church there's
[57:04] been no speak
[57:05] no speaking of this prior to but he is
[57:08] letting it be known that this church is
[57:11] going to be
[57:12] built on the revelation of who
[57:16] he is personally to the individual
[57:20] it's one thing for you to recognize
[57:23] he's the savior of the world but it's
[57:26] got to come down to where you recognize
[57:28] he's
[57:29] your savior it's one thing to recognize
[57:33] he's the redeemer it's different when
[57:35] you recognize
[57:36] he's my redeemer it's one thing to
[57:40] say he's a deliverer but when you say
[57:42] he's
[57:43] my deliverer you see god
[57:47] this god's desire is that it would
[57:50] become
[57:50] personal because this is the real
[57:54] work of of of the lamb of god
[57:57] is that what god has done it would
[58:00] become
[58:01] personal to you and i he did it
[58:05] for me i was in mind
[58:08] when he did it it was it was for me
[58:11] that that that he died for me that he
[58:14] was crucified
[58:15] it was for me that he got back up there
[58:17] on that easter morning it was for me he
[58:19] ascended on high
[58:21] and the scripture says i will build my
[58:24] church
[58:25] and it expresses that the gates of
[58:28] hell would not prevail against it
[58:32] showing that all hell it would
[58:36] be against this revelation because
[58:39] this revelation when this revelation
[58:42] takes hold
[58:44] in your life i'm telling you there could
[58:47] be floods
[58:47] there can be sickness there's distress
[58:50] all sorts of things
[58:52] that would consume the natural
[58:55] mortal person i don't care how strong
[58:58] the fibers of their genetics how how the
[59:02] constitution of their mind
[59:04] it doesn't matter there's nothing that
[59:07] can stand
[59:08] against the gates of hell except the
[59:11] revelation
[59:12] of jesus christ and that's his own life
[59:16] it's him
[59:19] it can't be overthrown
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:24] and i'll say it this way what god starts
[59:28] he always finishes he finishes
[59:32] everything he starts in luke 14 28
[59:35] it says for which of you intending to
[59:38] build a tower
[59:40] sitteth not down first and counteth the
[59:42] cost
[59:43] whether he have sufficient to finish it
[59:47] lest happily after he had laid the
[59:50] foundation
[59:51] is not able to finish it all that behold
[59:54] it
[59:55] began to mock him saying this man begin
[59:58] to build and was
[1:00:00] not able to finish i remember
[1:00:03] some years ago when we were still
[1:00:05] traveling from sandusky
[1:00:07] there was a place right there off of
[1:00:09] route 6 where
[1:00:10] used to be an airport in sandusky a
[1:00:12] small one there were some things they
[1:00:14] went to build a hotel
[1:00:16] it was supposed to be a country inn and
[1:00:18] suites a man purchased the property
[1:00:20] he began to build and what they got up
[1:00:23] they got the foundation
[1:00:25] they got the cinderblock walls all of
[1:00:27] that was
[1:00:28] right there but there was never a roof
[1:00:30] on it and it came to a place
[1:00:32] it came to a halt and it never moved
[1:00:36] beyond that as a matter of fact it came
[1:00:39] a time
[1:00:40] years and years later matter of fact it
[1:00:42] wasn't until about i think maybe five
[1:00:44] years ago or so
[1:00:46] that somebody took the property then and
[1:00:49] they tore that
[1:00:50] the remnants of what was there because
[1:00:52] you couldn't do nothing with it
[1:00:53] and now there's an actual structure
[1:00:55] there there's a business there
[1:00:57] my point was every time i would go by
[1:00:59] that i always thought of this scripture
[1:01:01] here's a person that started out with a
[1:01:03] very good intention
[1:01:05] they started out with with a program of
[1:01:07] you know if you had asked him can you
[1:01:09] see you know
[1:01:10] families coming here and staying here
[1:01:11] for cedar point and everything else
[1:01:13] they could say oh yeah we've got all
[1:01:15] this planned out and this is going to be
[1:01:17] it never made it to that
[1:01:20] so here the scripture says that when it
[1:01:23] speaks of a person beginning
[1:01:26] and it says conde they would set down
[1:01:28] and they would consider
[1:01:30] whether they have sufficient to finish
[1:01:33] let me just bring this down to you
[1:01:35] god is sufficient to finish
[1:01:39] what he started
[1:01:42] he's already counted the cost brother he
[1:01:45] doesn't have to go back and say
[1:01:47] my i missed the investment on that one
[1:01:50] or
[1:01:50] my messed up there should have never
[1:01:52] chose that one
[1:01:53] my goodness god is sufficient
[1:01:57] to finish what he started you
[1:02:00] are his workmanship
[1:02:05] in our own we don't have any
[1:02:07] self-sufficiency
[1:02:09] but god has already laid it out in his
[1:02:12] mind
[1:02:14] he finishes what he starts and he's
[1:02:17] able able who began the good work in you
[1:02:21] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:02:23] christ
[1:02:25] hebrews 11 39 and these
[1:02:28] all having obtained a good report
[1:02:31] through faith receive not the promise
[1:02:35] through faith they obtained a good
[1:02:37] report they finished their course
[1:02:39] but god having provided some better
[1:02:42] thing for us
[1:02:43] that they without us should
[1:02:46] not be made perfect
[1:02:50] there's a completion of this you see as
[1:02:53] the old testament
[1:02:54] they were looking from there from the
[1:02:57] fall
[1:02:58] forward they were looking for
[1:03:01] the coming of the messiah there was some
[1:03:03] there was a reality that
[1:03:05] there were those who offered the lamb
[1:03:07] and it was just going through the ritual
[1:03:09] but there were others that as they
[1:03:11] offered that lamb
[1:03:12] it was more than a ritual there was
[1:03:15] something
[1:03:16] that was that was real about that there
[1:03:18] was a testimony that
[1:03:20] of faith that's what it come down to
[1:03:22] faith that when they offered it was
[1:03:24] it was by faith they didn't see all of
[1:03:27] these things
[1:03:28] they didn't see everything laid out
[1:03:30] before them
[1:03:31] but there was a witness of the holy
[1:03:34] spirit i hope you're hearing me this
[1:03:35] morning
[1:03:36] they weren't offering the lamb and said
[1:03:38] oh yeah one day
[1:03:39] there's going to come calvary and here
[1:03:41] the lamb of god is going to come on the
[1:03:42] scene they didn't see that
[1:03:44] some of the prophets that god would pick
[1:03:47] up and inspire the prophets
[1:03:49] but many of the times here's where they
[1:03:51] were at they were walking
[1:03:53] with the word that god had given them
[1:03:56] in that season and they took that word
[1:03:59] at times
[1:04:00] when they didn't feel spiritual at times
[1:04:02] when they didn't feel like
[1:04:04] i don't know what's going on but they
[1:04:06] put their faith in the word
[1:04:08] that god had said and it was god
[1:04:11] that gave them achievement through their
[1:04:14] lives
[1:04:15] when you read about the heroes of faith
[1:04:17] these were not
[1:04:18] people that walked on clouds these were
[1:04:21] not people who were free
[1:04:23] from tests and trials but these were
[1:04:25] people that all
[1:04:26] hell came against us these are people
[1:04:28] that in the midst
[1:04:30] of situations they subdued kingdoms
[1:04:34] and they did it without the holy ghost
[1:04:39] but they had faith in what god said
[1:04:42] that they would step out there in a
[1:04:44] place and say
[1:04:45] i don't know how it's going to happen i
[1:04:47] don't know how this is going to come to
[1:04:49] pass
[1:04:49] but god said so you see that's what's
[1:04:52] most important
[1:04:53] and that's where we can stand up on his
[1:04:55] word god has said so
[1:04:57] amen god has spoken who can but prophesy
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:04] faith faith takes hold
[1:05:08] i want you to remember that faith is not
[1:05:10] what you feel
[1:05:11] amen amen faith is not even what you're
[1:05:15] conscious of
[1:05:16] faith is a settled something in your
[1:05:19] heart
[1:05:20] faith is an unconscious it's an
[1:05:22] unconscious reality you're not thinking
[1:05:23] when you go out here
[1:05:24] i wonder if the car's going to start and
[1:05:26] i wonder if i'm going to be able to
[1:05:27] drive home you're not thinking about
[1:05:29] that there's a that's a measure of faith
[1:05:31] but this this faith is even so much
[1:05:33] greater it's a faith you're not even
[1:05:35] aware of
[1:05:36] what's what's taking place because it's
[1:05:38] not conscience it's just
[1:05:39] simply it's a settledness that even when
[1:05:42] what's in front of you you can say
[1:05:44] there's no way possible
[1:05:46] your senses around you can say there's
[1:05:48] no way
[1:05:49] but there's a settledness on the inside
[1:05:52] that just drops there and you know you
[1:05:55] can't explain it but you know
[1:05:59] that's faith i would rather have that
[1:06:02] then know everything out in front of me
[1:06:06] because that right there will give me
[1:06:09] grace
[1:06:09] to conquer and go through every
[1:06:12] circumstance
[1:06:17] there's a completion of this world what
[1:06:20] what was started there
[1:06:22] what was laid out with the prophets and
[1:06:25] all
[1:06:25] you know the patriarchs and all them
[1:06:27] down through time
[1:06:29] there was there had to be a completion
[1:06:31] of that work
[1:06:32] and when the lord jesus himself as he
[1:06:35] came and here he raises
[1:06:39] from the grave you see they're all
[1:06:42] waiting on them remember they're being
[1:06:43] they're held in paradise
[1:06:45] they're they're under the blood of the
[1:06:47] lamb they can't go
[1:06:49] they can't go into heaven because the
[1:06:52] price hasn't been
[1:06:53] paid yet but when he comes
[1:06:57] and he leads captivity captive
[1:07:00] right down there in the midst of hell
[1:07:03] right in there with paradise
[1:07:05] he goes in there deposits sin
[1:07:08] the dead of it he unloads it and he
[1:07:11] begins to sin back up as he
[1:07:14] raises on that easter morning he is the
[1:07:18] keystone
[1:07:19] or what joins together the old testament
[1:07:22] saints that have been waiting on the
[1:07:25] promise
[1:07:26] he joins them into the promise
[1:07:29] and paradise is emptied out there's no
[1:07:31] more paradise
[1:07:32] and they ascend on high with him
[1:07:37] once you remember not all the old
[1:07:39] testament saints got up
[1:07:42] not all of them were elect the bible
[1:07:45] says
[1:07:46] many that slept right not all
[1:07:50] many who slept because there are those
[1:07:52] who walked with that revelation in their
[1:07:55] heart
[1:07:56] so he comes to cap this off then he
[1:07:59] comes back
[1:08:00] on the day of pentecost and in the form
[1:08:04] of the holy ghost as the son of god
[1:08:07] and he comes into a body of believers
[1:08:11] and it doesn't diminish with him going
[1:08:13] from
[1:08:14] the resurrected body that corporal body
[1:08:17] taken up on the right right hand of god
[1:08:20] now the same god
[1:08:22] the same jesus who dwelt in that body
[1:08:25] that saved jesus same life now comes
[1:08:28] and moves into a body of believers
[1:08:32] that are gathered there in the upper
[1:08:34] room what brought their gathering
[1:08:37] his resurrection what was his
[1:08:39] resurrection
[1:08:40] it was promises that lay in the word
[1:08:44] for that hour
[1:08:47] it would have done no good to build an
[1:08:49] ark that wasn't the promise
[1:08:52] of the hour that was a tithe that was
[1:08:55] fulfilled
[1:08:56] and the true ark was the lord jesus
[1:08:59] the body of jesus christ the holy ghost
[1:09:02] and they were
[1:09:03] gathered by that word and here he steps
[1:09:06] in
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:08] the same son of man whom stood before
[1:09:12] peter and said
[1:09:13] who do you say i am the same one
[1:09:16] same power same fullness he stood
[1:09:20] in a bright body in that moment on the
[1:09:22] day of pentecost
[1:09:23] revealing himself that he's the son of
[1:09:26] man
[1:09:30] we know in the scriptures that there was
[1:09:32] promise
[1:09:34] that lay in there or where we see there
[1:09:37] would come in
[1:09:38] we see it in the beginning of the
[1:09:40] gentile ages
[1:09:42] of how that satan would come in getting
[1:09:46] the people
[1:09:47] off track started out with that
[1:09:49] nickelodeon spirit came in
[1:09:51] with a white horse that right real
[1:09:54] innocent satan doesn't come in
[1:09:57] like the big bad boogeyman are you with
[1:10:01] me satan doesn't come on and come in and
[1:10:03] come into your life and say
[1:10:04] i'm gonna make you lukewarm and cold and
[1:10:06] powerless
[1:10:07] i'm gonna you don't come in that way he
[1:10:09] comes in things
[1:10:10] clothed in whiteness innocency
[1:10:15] are you with me the things that you look
[1:10:17] at and say oh there's no harm in that
[1:10:19] and there's no harm in that let me just
[1:10:20] tell you something this is why
[1:10:22] it takes a holy spirit brother and
[1:10:24] sister
[1:10:25] if you don't stay in the word and stay
[1:10:27] before god like you're up to
[1:10:29] you'll find yourself in trap after trap
[1:10:32] after trap
[1:10:32] and you're wondering why why don't i
[1:10:34] have any victory in my life
[1:10:36] why don't i have this in my life we go
[1:10:38] through tests and trials that's true
[1:10:40] but there's a time we have to evaluate
[1:10:42] and say god
[1:10:43] are you the first priority in my life
[1:10:50] that's where it comes down in you the
[1:10:52] first priority
[1:10:53] you see you find how the enemy he rides
[1:10:56] in
[1:10:57] to where he comes to a place that the
[1:10:59] that that the body
[1:11:01] of the bride little by little how it's
[1:11:04] just
[1:11:04] it's just been eating away like those
[1:11:07] four
[1:11:07] stages of the of the insect that speaks
[1:11:10] there in joke it just starts a little
[1:11:12] by little you realize how the devil
[1:11:13] you'll eat a little bit away at your
[1:11:15] testimony a little bit and a little bit
[1:11:17] and a little bit you know the little
[1:11:19] bits itself you can take a great big
[1:11:20] chocolate cake
[1:11:21] you can take a little bit a little bit a
[1:11:23] little bit a little bit a little bit and
[1:11:24] you think you're getting by with
[1:11:26] it eventually somebody comes in and says
[1:11:28] hey
[1:11:29] who took this big old piece i didn't
[1:11:30] take a big piece you did little
[1:11:32] by little by little by little
[1:11:36] it's little foxes that's pearl divine
[1:11:41] the moment you think i got everything in
[1:11:43] control that's the moment of backslidden
[1:11:45] [Applause]
[1:11:47] we don't got everything under control
[1:11:50] it's under
[1:11:50] his control
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:12:00] so how we find this this little
[1:12:03] just trying to eat away but god made a
[1:12:06] promise our restore
[1:12:07] and we see that how the bride body how
[1:12:11] that there had to be there he would go
[1:12:13] in those dark ages go
[1:12:15] in a time there in the very dirt
[1:12:18] of denominationalism it would that seed
[1:12:21] of life
[1:12:22] would be buried but god made a promise i
[1:12:26] will restore because god has made a
[1:12:29] promise
[1:12:30] upon this rock i will build my church
[1:12:34] and he has sufficient to finish
[1:12:37] the work the devil thought he had it
[1:12:40] but you can't stop the life
[1:12:44] the life started working up come a
[1:12:47] sprout
[1:12:47] here and then come and shoot then comes
[1:12:49] a tassel then comes into the place
[1:12:52] now where we stand right back to the
[1:12:54] original
[1:12:55] grain seed the same god
[1:12:59] that can that was there that walked in
[1:13:01] flesh
[1:13:02] the same god that came in fullness on
[1:13:04] the day of pentecost
[1:13:05] is the same god who sent the message and
[1:13:08] night after night
[1:13:09] demonstrated that it is not a man that
[1:13:12] i'm the same lord jesus
[1:13:14] i'm the same god of my word i'm a god
[1:13:17] who made promises in my word
[1:13:19] it is not justice it was not a show it
[1:13:21] was not just a gift
[1:13:23] but this is a reality of the same living
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:26] let me tell you what it was announcing
[1:13:28] it's the same god
[1:13:30] that has come on the scene to cap a
[1:13:32] bride
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:35] this is where we stand he came
[1:13:39] and a bride the old testament bride was
[1:13:42] capped off
[1:13:43] they were taken that right
[1:13:47] now for the gentile bride he's come
[1:13:50] in his fullness of his life the same
[1:13:52] life
[1:13:54] has come to cap off
[1:13:58] this is the marriage of the land and i
[1:14:01] say and i say very impurposely
[1:14:03] it's not enough to recognize that god
[1:14:06] coming on the platform every night
[1:14:09] it's not enough even to just recognize
[1:14:12] that god right here
[1:14:14] in our services but it's got to come
[1:14:16] down to you recognize
[1:14:17] it's that same god in you
[1:14:22] expressing himself through adopted sons
[1:14:25] and daughters of god amen
[1:14:29] hallelujah think of this in acts chapter
[1:14:32] 1 verse 1
[1:14:34] have as it speaks the form of treatise
[1:14:37] have i made o falafelus
[1:14:39] of all that jesus began both to do
[1:14:42] and to teach he began
[1:14:46] what god started in that body
[1:14:49] he's finishing in the bride bob
[1:14:57] glory be to god the way that he was
[1:15:01] in the group is how he is in his bride
[1:15:06] amen what he began in the initiation
[1:15:10] of redemption on the cross
[1:15:13] now is the finishing up of redemption
[1:15:17] in the body of the bride amen this is
[1:15:20] the final
[1:15:21] outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:15:24] there's not another age that's after
[1:15:26] we're living
[1:15:27] in the time of the finish
[1:15:31] this is not the time of the of the in
[1:15:34] between
[1:15:34] this is the time of the finish
[1:15:38] is that right the announcement in
[1:15:40] revelations 10
[1:15:41] that that the mystery of god should be
[1:15:44] finished
[1:15:44] and the mystery of god is not something
[1:15:47] you learn in a school
[1:15:48] the mystery of god is the baptism of the
[1:15:51] holy ghost
[1:15:53] it's the finishing the capping off of
[1:15:56] his
[1:15:56] own life
[1:16:01] amen hebrews 12 1.
[1:16:06] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:16:08] about
[1:16:09] with so great cloud of witnesses and we
[1:16:12] are
[1:16:12] yeah we are we're not just talking about
[1:16:15] witnesses that are back there i'm
[1:16:17] talking about witnesses
[1:16:18] right among us testimonies and lives
[1:16:22] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:16:25] sin which just so easily beset us
[1:16:27] and let us run with patience the race
[1:16:30] that is set before us very interesting
[1:16:33] as it's as it's wrote here
[1:16:34] with patience it deals with a constant
[1:16:37] endurance yes
[1:16:41] just in case you don't know or haven't
[1:16:43] experienced it everything's not hippie
[1:16:46] skippy
[1:16:48] sorry those are only words i have all
[1:16:49] right because there's times
[1:16:51] you have to press when you don't feel
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:57] with patience running this race it's not
[1:17:00] a sprint this is not a sprint
[1:17:03] that's right you know how it is you see
[1:17:06] people sometimes they'll start off you
[1:17:07] know and
[1:17:08] you know i remember back in the days you
[1:17:10] know when we have field days at school
[1:17:12] and things like that
[1:17:13] never signed up for any running events
[1:17:15] but you remember how they would you know
[1:17:17] and you'd see guys start out and when
[1:17:19] when i played football you'd have
[1:17:20] certain timed runs that we had to do
[1:17:22] in the in the summertime and things like
[1:17:24] that you remember that brother dave you
[1:17:25] have certain timed runs that you'd have
[1:17:27] to do or whatever more you see guys
[1:17:29] start out
[1:17:30] you know the lineman had to run this
[1:17:32] amount in this amount of time in the
[1:17:33] backs and everything else
[1:17:34] i don't think i could say i'm glad i'm
[1:17:36] not a bad
[1:17:38] but they had to run it in a certain
[1:17:39] amount of time you'd see guys man they
[1:17:41] would
[1:17:42] start out right away like that pretty
[1:17:45] soon by the time the fifth lap come
[1:17:47] here they are the ones walking
[1:17:50] you know why they started out without
[1:17:53] thinking
[1:17:53] of sufficiency to finish
[1:17:57] they didn't consider amen and see
[1:18:00] this is this is the part it's not how
[1:18:03] fast it's the steadiness
[1:18:05] that's right amen we're not in it god's
[1:18:08] not interested in
[1:18:09] how fast somebody it's a steadiness
[1:18:12] are you with me folks are not interested
[1:18:14] in somebody all of a sudden one
[1:18:15] once and once a month they they deem
[1:18:17] themselves and they appear very
[1:18:19] spiritual god's not interested in that
[1:18:21] he's interested in lives that are steady
[1:18:24] weak in
[1:18:28] steady doesn't mean you're always on the
[1:18:30] top of the mountain
[1:18:31] but it's a steadiness because you know
[1:18:34] as a believer
[1:18:35] there's times where you feel like lower
[1:18:37] than the valley
[1:18:38] but here you are
[1:18:39] [Applause]
[1:18:41] there you are pressing on you don't
[1:18:43] maybe feel like getting up but here the
[1:18:45] leg comes out of the bed
[1:18:47] and here you might feel like my i i feel
[1:18:49] discouraged but there's something down
[1:18:51] on the inside a little
[1:18:53] something that'll reach and hold what is
[1:18:55] it it's the steadiness
[1:18:59] of the finisher he
[1:19:02] finishes what he starts
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:11] so just because you can you know don't
[1:19:13] let the devil try to put anything on
[1:19:15] your wealth
[1:19:15] you're not a spiritual so-and-so or
[1:19:17] you're not you don't compare yourself
[1:19:18] with that way
[1:19:20] you've seen you and i've seen people all
[1:19:22] through the years all of a sudden they
[1:19:23] come in
[1:19:24] mine they've got a tongue or they've got
[1:19:25] a great prophecy for the church
[1:19:27] and they've got this and you want to say
[1:19:29] where have you been
[1:19:31] when the going has been taught where
[1:19:33] faith has needed to be
[1:19:35] manifest where have you been
[1:19:38] so whatever you have it's for you
[1:19:42] if there's a word that word's for you go
[1:19:44] look in the mirror and rehearse rehearse
[1:19:46] it to yourself
[1:19:47] brother samuel that's free it comes with
[1:19:49] whipped cream on top
[1:19:52] it's the truth god's not interested this
[1:19:54] is not an hour
[1:19:56] of display this is an hour that requires
[1:19:59] steadfast steadiness that's just walking
[1:20:03] on notice
[1:20:04] we're not running to the beat of onward
[1:20:06] christian soldiers
[1:20:07] we're marching to the beat of onward
[1:20:11] christian soldiers
[1:20:12] taking promises one by one but
[1:20:16] one by one
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:24] a lot between the lines there looking
[1:20:27] unto jesus
[1:20:29] the offering the finisher of our faith
[1:20:30] so this is how we run it
[1:20:32] looking unto jesus amen
[1:20:36] amen the author and finisher of our
[1:20:39] faith
[1:20:40] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:20:43] endured the cross
[1:20:44] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:20:46] the right hand
[1:20:47] of the throne of god
[1:20:50] you can't look anywhere in the
[1:20:53] scriptures
[1:20:54] and not see and recognize that god
[1:20:57] is over it all
[1:21:00] he said here he would reveal himself to
[1:21:03] john
[1:21:04] put his right hand on john and say fear
[1:21:06] not
[1:21:07] he was revealing himself as the mighty
[1:21:11] conqueror he was letting john know you
[1:21:14] don't have
[1:21:14] nothing to fear i've conquered sickness
[1:21:18] i've conquered death i've conquered hell
[1:21:20] i've conquered the grave
[1:21:22] i've conquered it all and he's revealing
[1:21:25] himself to john i
[1:21:26] am the mighty conqueror and you're
[1:21:30] in me and i'm in you you have nothing
[1:21:33] to fear he reveals it's a finished work
[1:21:39] if you've ever been healed at any time
[1:21:42] in your life
[1:21:42] it's not because god himself has come
[1:21:45] and had to pay a price or had to do
[1:21:48] something for you
[1:21:48] it's where your faith sometimes even be
[1:21:51] um it's unbeknown
[1:21:52] right here but your faith would rise
[1:21:55] into that place
[1:21:56] and here now virtue comes there from the
[1:21:59] reality of a finished work
[1:22:05] hallelujah amen
[1:22:10] sometimes i know we we want things
[1:22:12] sometimes like this
[1:22:15] sometimes those are times where things
[1:22:16] come like that right other times there's
[1:22:18] times when we have to stand
[1:22:20] and you have to battle and you have to
[1:22:22] just stand there on the word
[1:22:25] you're not defeated you're standing on
[1:22:27] the word
[1:22:28] it'd be better to stand there than be in
[1:22:30] heaven or upon this earth
[1:22:32] because heavens and earth will pass away
[1:22:36] but my word shall never fail
[1:22:39] peter spoke by inspiration the word of
[1:22:42] the lord
[1:22:43] endureth forever you see this is why
[1:22:47] to be standing upon the word standing
[1:22:50] in him look unto jesus
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:54] this word look here it's a word that
[1:22:57] deals with
[1:22:58] looking away from one thing and add
[1:23:01] another
[1:23:03] man see it's looking it's looking beyond
[1:23:07] when jesus could say through isaiah look
[1:23:09] unto me all the ends of the earth
[1:23:11] is that right the word ends of the earth
[1:23:13] brother brown picks it up he said what
[1:23:15] that is
[1:23:15] he said it says ends of the earth he
[1:23:18] said it what it is it's
[1:23:19] ends of world civilization
[1:23:22] where you have ends that have come ends
[1:23:25] that have taken place there's been ends
[1:23:27] and it's always at the ending is where
[1:23:30] he steps in
[1:23:31] at his fullness
[1:23:34] look unto me all your ends of the earth
[1:23:37] so to look from one place
[1:23:39] to another so there would have to be
[1:23:43] in this in the hour that we are living
[1:23:46] in it would have to be that god
[1:23:49] would supply and he did supply eyes
[1:23:52] because a prophet is a seer and to be
[1:23:54] able to
[1:23:55] catch that to catch where the church is
[1:23:58] at
[1:23:58] where the church must be in order for
[1:24:01] rapture
[1:24:03] so it has to take eyes to be able to see
[1:24:06] that not these eyes but
[1:24:08] spiritual eyes and to be able to express
[1:24:11] to you and i
[1:24:12] this is who you really are
[1:24:16] it it brings us beyond just looking out
[1:24:20] and looking at calvary just to look at
[1:24:23] an event that took place but to also see
[1:24:25] that through calvary
[1:24:27] and through the resurrection you were
[1:24:29] included in this
[1:24:30] he came with the purpose to set us free
[1:24:34] he came to bring deliverance he came to
[1:24:37] break the hold of sin
[1:24:39] he came that that same life might come
[1:24:42] back to you and i as believers
[1:24:44] that's the life that belonged to you and
[1:24:47] i am
[1:24:48] it's to see that and to get into the
[1:24:51] blood
[1:24:52] get into the blood to where you stand as
[1:24:55] a redeemed son and daughter of god
[1:24:57] you stand there with a reality of where
[1:25:00] you stand there
[1:25:01] that he is the author and the finisher
[1:25:04] of my faith
[1:25:06] the same god who started to work in my
[1:25:08] life
[1:25:09] is the same god finishing that work in
[1:25:11] my life
[1:25:12] let me tell you the holy spirit when god
[1:25:15] has deposited that of his own life
[1:25:17] inside of you everything you have need
[1:25:20] of
[1:25:21] including the rapture is already inside
[1:25:24] of you
[1:25:27] you're healing it's already inside of
[1:25:29] you healing's not an external thing
[1:25:32] healing is what already lays in you
[1:25:38] i want brother sam how do i release that
[1:25:40] drink
[1:25:41] drink drink take in take in
[1:25:45] just just be an absorbent of that amen
[1:25:49] is that right so as a christian we
[1:25:52] a christian doesn't look at what he sees
[1:25:56] abraham could not be focused on what he
[1:25:58] saw
[1:26:01] because what he saw he kept on getting
[1:26:04] weaker and weaker and weaker
[1:26:09] who against hope believed in him
[1:26:12] what was going on but he looked to what
[1:26:16] god had said
[1:26:18] if you were to ask abraham how's this
[1:26:20] going to
[1:26:21] right let me just bring it down if it
[1:26:23] was up to you and i to choose
[1:26:25] and you and i would look and say let me
[1:26:27] see let me see we'll be
[1:26:28] a good person i mean we need we need a
[1:26:30] you know we can't choose anybody who's
[1:26:32] barren i mean surely that wouldn't bring
[1:26:34] the promise forth
[1:26:35] you and i would try to choose out and
[1:26:38] look out somebody that would
[1:26:39] be able to fulfill the promise but god
[1:26:42] doesn't choose based on that
[1:26:45] his choosing's not in time he already
[1:26:48] knew before the foundational
[1:26:50] world you can look at all of your own
[1:26:52] inabilities well i've got this
[1:26:54] and i've got that and i've got this but
[1:26:57] god himself specializes
[1:26:59] in taking lives that with all of our
[1:27:01] weaknesses
[1:27:02] and all of our inabilities can surrender
[1:27:05] it all into his hands
[1:27:06] and say lord i need you lord
[1:27:09] this is what you said in your word and
[1:27:12] i'm looking to you
[1:27:13] to fulfill that and god says yes now
[1:27:16] we're getting into the right place
[1:27:22] he's a finisher
[1:27:25] and a finisher is one this very word in
[1:27:28] this scripture means
[1:27:30] one who is perfection he
[1:27:33] is the perfection of the church
[1:27:38] he is our perfection the scripture would
[1:27:40] say in hebrews 6
[1:27:42] 1 therefore leaving the principles of
[1:27:44] the doctrine of christ
[1:27:45] let us go on unto perfection
[1:27:50] not laying again the foundation of
[1:27:51] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:27:53] toward god
[1:27:54] paul is dealing with that that there
[1:27:56] would be a progression in the life
[1:27:58] where god has started and how god and we
[1:28:01] know we've looked at this
[1:28:03] how god has started to work but to see
[1:28:05] there is a going on
[1:28:07] into perfection and this very word
[1:28:10] perfection
[1:28:11] is the word finisher
[1:28:14] let us go on to the finisher
[1:28:18] just stay with me a few moments let's go
[1:28:21] on to the finisher you see
[1:28:23] he's the high priest of his own word
[1:28:27] and the high priest is one who's been
[1:28:29] chosen
[1:28:30] to minister on our behalf to minister
[1:28:34] of the word to you and i it's not
[1:28:37] the it's not the man samuel browning
[1:28:40] it's the high priest himself
[1:28:42] ministering to our life just what you
[1:28:44] and i have need of
[1:28:46] he's been set aside to minister to move
[1:28:49] upon our life you see it's god calling
[1:28:52] you and i
[1:28:53] to perfection we know we've got to be
[1:28:56] perfect in order to stand there is that
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:59] but that perfection is not a perfection
[1:29:02] in ourself of our own efforts
[1:29:07] they'll never be able to be achieved on
[1:29:09] our own the law could make nothing
[1:29:11] perfect
[1:29:12] and the law was based on the will
[1:29:15] of man the will of man can make
[1:29:19] nothing perfect
[1:29:22] even when it came to the garden of
[1:29:24] gethsemane when the lord jesus stood
[1:29:26] there he said
[1:29:27] nevertheless not my will thine will
[1:29:31] be done he had to surrender his
[1:29:36] will to the will
[1:29:39] of god which was the word
[1:29:43] when he did that then now comes forth
[1:29:46] the victory victory right there in his
[1:29:49] life
[1:29:49] right there in the garden of gethsemane
[1:29:51] that's where the lion prevailed
[1:29:56] that's the very place that he prevails
[1:29:58] in your life
[1:29:59] is when you lay down and say not my will
[1:30:03] thine will be done i'm trying to be a
[1:30:06] good christian right
[1:30:07] trying to do this but just lay down your
[1:30:10] will and accept
[1:30:11] what he's already done he is the
[1:30:14] finisher
[1:30:18] you've got a finisher on the inside
[1:30:20] you've got a finisher
[1:30:27] it's calling you and out of perfection
[1:30:29] this is why you and i
[1:30:30] you can't settle down right amen you
[1:30:33] just say it's not
[1:30:34] it's not just something to where you can
[1:30:36] just settle down and well i've got it
[1:30:37] made her
[1:30:38] we've got this material it's a call to
[1:30:41] perfection
[1:30:42] amen there's a longing within our life
[1:30:45] like paul could say
[1:30:46] i count not myself to have apprehended
[1:30:49] i count not myself to be perfect meaning
[1:30:52] that i've got it all made
[1:30:54] but he said i press toward the mark amen
[1:30:57] i'm pressing towards the finish line
[1:30:59] amen everything that's within me
[1:31:02] so nothing we're perfect in him
[1:31:06] nothing can be taken away from him
[1:31:11] in the in the new birth the work of the
[1:31:14] holy spirit
[1:31:15] in our life a complete experience where
[1:31:18] the old man
[1:31:19] has died the new man there's a new man
[1:31:23] on the inside
[1:31:24] the desires of the world are gone
[1:31:27] there's a desire it's it's him it's him
[1:31:31] that you're in love with
[1:31:32] it's him that you want to please you
[1:31:34] know you're not the same person
[1:31:37] that you used to be there's a reality on
[1:31:39] the inside
[1:31:41] there's a life there's it's a part of
[1:31:44] him
[1:31:46] that's being revealed from in your life
[1:31:50] i want you to i want you to catch this
[1:31:52] here
[1:31:54] but our character our character itself
[1:31:59] is what's molded through the test and
[1:32:02] the trials
[1:32:04] remember what he said it's finished
[1:32:07] he paid he paid the price the work the
[1:32:10] fulfillment
[1:32:12] of what had to be done was done
[1:32:15] in order that this work could come into
[1:32:18] our life
[1:32:18] yes through tests and trials our lives
[1:32:23] are molded amen
[1:32:26] that he in his infinite wisdom allows to
[1:32:28] come to pass
[1:32:32] but the work of the new birth is what
[1:32:33] brings us into the perfection
[1:32:36] of god amen and we stand perfect
[1:32:39] in him this is why he can see
[1:32:43] no sin once that life has passed there
[1:32:47] underneath the blood and you're standing
[1:32:49] there with a
[1:32:50] confidence that you know i didn't do
[1:32:53] this
[1:32:54] god's done this you know what you used
[1:32:57] to be
[1:32:58] and what you are now amen and you know
[1:33:01] what god
[1:33:02] has done within your life yes
[1:33:05] are you are you with me there's tests
[1:33:07] and there's trials that come
[1:33:09] there's things that you learn and you
[1:33:11] grow from there's traps yes that's been
[1:33:14] said
[1:33:14] that you look back and have to say
[1:33:16] father forgive me
[1:33:17] there's things that that that we that
[1:33:19] you experience within your life and
[1:33:21] through test and trial
[1:33:23] even in the midst of tests and trials
[1:33:25] our humanity
[1:33:26] at the very times of tests and trials
[1:33:28] our humanity
[1:33:30] shows the weakness and the frailty
[1:33:33] you would think if god if somebody was
[1:33:35] going to put
[1:33:36] an awesome treasure into something you
[1:33:39] would look at
[1:33:40] and say what could i put this treasure
[1:33:42] in
[1:33:44] you would want to search out the best
[1:33:46] maybe the best vase or the best cabinet
[1:33:48] or
[1:33:49] whatever more you know what is when
[1:33:50] somebody has maybe a piece of glass or
[1:33:52] or they have a
[1:33:53] something and they they want to make
[1:33:54] sure they put it in something that
[1:33:56] that it expresses the value of it it's
[1:33:59] something that you know can hold it
[1:34:01] right there in view
[1:34:02] but god himself did not choose something
[1:34:05] of concrete
[1:34:06] something a mortar but god chose earth
[1:34:09] and vessels
[1:34:11] vessels that if you drop them they
[1:34:13] shatter
[1:34:14] but god chose earth and vessels that it
[1:34:17] may be that it's
[1:34:18] not of us it's of his power
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:23] it's not us it's him
[1:34:27] god chose it that way you and i maybe
[1:34:29] would have put it in concrete
[1:34:31] but god said i don't want an
[1:34:32] organization in life i want a life
[1:34:34] that's able to be moved
[1:34:38] with it being an earthen vessel
[1:34:39] sometimes our feelings get hurt
[1:34:42] sometimes our spirit gets low come on
[1:34:44] somebody there's times where our spirit
[1:34:46] has got wounded as much as our body has
[1:34:49] got wounded
[1:34:50] but it doesn't take away from the
[1:34:52] treasure
[1:34:53] of the holy ghost from the inside
[1:35:00] if it hadn't been for god on my side
[1:35:05] oh i think of that old song if it hadn't
[1:35:07] been for the lord
[1:35:08] tell me where would i be
[1:35:12] it's a confidence that we have in him
[1:35:14] let me just try to wrap this up here
[1:35:17] he revealed himself we read there in the
[1:35:19] book of revelations
[1:35:21] he reveals himself in revelations 3 14

[1:38:23] for rapture
[1:38:25] don't fear little sister there's a man
[1:38:28] here
[1:38:29] that turned on the lights
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:37] hallelujah i want to say it like this
[1:38:40] when they came into the place
[1:38:44] when israel coming back out of babylon
[1:38:48] remember they were down there for 70
[1:38:51] years
[1:38:52] and here there came a time of them
[1:38:54] coming back
[1:38:55] into the land and how god would reveal
[1:38:58] himself
[1:39:00] through zechariah you have the different
[1:39:03] prophets and i
[1:39:04] i don't have time to labor upon these
[1:39:07] points
[1:39:08] of where i was but you'll look even at
[1:39:10] zechariah
[1:39:11] and has the prophets and has they stood
[1:39:13] there
[1:39:15] let me read this in zechariah 4 6. then
[1:39:18] he answered and spake unto me now
[1:39:19] remember the angel of the lord has
[1:39:21] zechariah as a prophet
[1:39:22] and he has him looking at the seven
[1:39:25] golden candlesticks
[1:39:27] and he asked zechariah what is this
[1:39:30] zechariah said i don't know
[1:39:32] you know and here's what he speaks of
[1:39:35] this is the word of the lord unto
[1:39:37] zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[1:39:39] power but by my spirit saith
[1:39:41] the lord of hosts who art thou o great
[1:39:44] mountain
[1:39:45] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[1:39:47] plain
[1:39:48] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:39:50] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[1:39:52] grace unto it
[1:39:54] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[1:39:56] me saying
[1:39:57] the hands of zerubbabel have laid the
[1:40:01] foundation of this house
[1:40:02] his hands shall also finish it
[1:40:06] and thou shalt know that the lord of
[1:40:08] hosts hath
[1:40:09] sent me unto you
[1:40:14] this type of zerubbabel
[1:40:17] it's a type of christ amen
[1:40:20] because it would go on to say even in
[1:40:23] the book of
[1:40:24] haggai that he would speak regarding
[1:40:27] cerebral
[1:40:28] i will make him as a signet
[1:40:31] meaning a seal and you know what a seal
[1:40:33] is it's a finished word
[1:40:36] this is what i will make here so this
[1:40:38] was a type
[1:40:39] a shadow of something that was pointing
[1:40:42] to the work of christ that christ
[1:40:45] himself
[1:40:46] upon this rock i'll build my church down
[1:40:48] the foundation
[1:40:49] that would be laid is that of jesus
[1:40:52] christ what did paul say
[1:40:54] no other foundation can a man lay
[1:40:57] is that right it would also be expressed
[1:41:00] through the word of god there was a man
[1:41:02] who built his house on the sand one who
[1:41:05] built it on the rock
[1:41:06] the floods came made no difference they
[1:41:09] got the same kind of beating of wind
[1:41:11] rain storms but the one on the sand was
[1:41:14] washed away but the one upon the rock
[1:41:17] stood
[1:41:18] through all the tests and all the trials
[1:41:20] and all the wind and
[1:41:21] all the rain oh my you might have felt
[1:41:23] like the tricking and
[1:41:24] you can hear the cricking of the boards
[1:41:26] and everything but it was founded
[1:41:28] on the rock
[1:41:37] this is a this was laid out to show
[1:41:41] that the church of the living god would
[1:41:44] be
[1:41:45] built think of all the scriptures we
[1:41:48] direct it would be built by the power
[1:41:52] of the living god it would be god
[1:41:55] a symbol his children
[1:42:00] god building remember as paul would
[1:42:02] write we are built for a habitation of
[1:42:04] the spirit
[1:42:07] but then we would find there was a time
[1:42:11] in here
[1:42:13] that in the midst of this time when they
[1:42:15] came back
[1:42:16] and some of you perhaps recall there's
[1:42:18] times when we've ministered on these
[1:42:20] things but
[1:42:21] it just there was a time that came here
[1:42:26] that they stopped working all right now
[1:42:28] they were commissioned to build this
[1:42:30] temple right
[1:42:32] they laid the foundation
[1:42:36] but then there's accusations that
[1:42:38] started to come their way
[1:42:40] right lies right that started to be told
[1:42:44] right are you hearing me this is in ezra
[1:42:47] nehemiah
[1:42:48] haggai but you find lies started being
[1:42:52] told
[1:42:53] all right
[1:42:56] we could really preach on this
[1:43:01] satan is the father of lies
[1:43:06] he'd like for you to believe the lies
[1:43:08] that he's telling about you
[1:43:13] are you with me he's got a lot of things
[1:43:16] to try to
[1:43:16] say and wants to try to put out but this
[1:43:19] is why
[1:43:20] as we've been looking at you're walking
[1:43:22] with a real
[1:43:23] confidence you know i know in whom i
[1:43:26] have beliefs
[1:43:28] and satan would like to put things in
[1:43:30] and try to hinder
[1:43:31] they were 15 years the work of god
[1:43:36] ceased right
[1:43:39] and look what happened in this 15 years
[1:43:40] they became occupied on other things
[1:43:43] it became occupied on so many other
[1:43:45] things so god
[1:43:47] listen this shows something here god
[1:43:50] is a finisher
[1:43:54] he came back around and here was those
[1:43:57] men jerubal standing right there and the
[1:44:00] rest of them
[1:44:01] and haggai comes and he begins to speak
[1:44:05] to him
[1:44:06] the bible says when haggai the lord's
[1:44:08] messenger
[1:44:09] spake in the lord's message and the
[1:44:12] first words that he told him
[1:44:13] i am with you
[1:44:17] i'm with you they were so discouraged
[1:44:21] they were so despondent they didn't even
[1:44:24] know where do i even
[1:44:25] start right now it's been 15 years
[1:44:29] are you hearing me where do i even go
[1:44:31] they felt so discouraged
[1:44:33] they listened sometimes their
[1:44:34] discouragement come and then you're
[1:44:36] discouraged that you were discouraged
[1:44:38] then you were discouraged
[1:44:40] somebody go help me preach now you get
[1:44:43] you're getting discouraged you're down
[1:44:44] at your time of discouragement
[1:44:46] right yeah case you haven't realized
[1:44:49] you're a human still
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:52] you're you're not you're not superman
[1:44:54] and superwoman not that you want to be
[1:44:56] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:44:58] there's times when you get down in your
[1:45:00] humanity
[1:45:02] and satan kept coming at him with the
[1:45:04] purpose the bible says
[1:45:05] was to frustrate the work of god
[1:45:09] means to break the purpose of it he
[1:45:12] wants to break the purpose
[1:45:13] he's tried to discourage them by lies
[1:45:16] and
[1:45:16] accusations and coming at them but here
[1:45:19] comes
[1:45:20] god on the scene
[1:45:23] he begins to remind them of their
[1:45:26] purpose
[1:45:27] of where god brought them from what does
[1:45:29] god
[1:45:30] come do god comes with the truth and the
[1:45:33] truth
[1:45:33] cast out the lies
[1:45:37] there's nothing as powerful as the truth
[1:45:40] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:45:44] shall make you free
[1:45:47] the truth comes and it dismantles
[1:45:49] satan's
[1:45:50] lies and his accusations these people
[1:45:54] weren't
[1:45:54] guilty of that
[1:45:58] they weren't guilty of what they were
[1:45:59] being accused of
[1:46:02] but here came god god said i'm with you
[1:46:07] and the bible says the prophets
[1:46:11] through the ministry strengthened the
[1:46:13] hands
[1:46:15] of the people they begin to
[1:46:18] work you know what they did they had to
[1:46:21] go back to
[1:46:22] go up to the mountain and get wood they
[1:46:24] just had there's got to be a starting
[1:46:25] spot
[1:46:26] right right so the word of god encourage
[1:46:29] them
[1:46:30] just just take the steps going back up
[1:46:32] get started getting the wood
[1:46:33] bringing the word wood down start
[1:46:35] building start assembling
[1:46:37] yes and then when it was all said and
[1:46:39] done
[1:46:40] and here stand the temple and the glory
[1:46:42] of god filled the temple
[1:46:44] that temple was in no comparison to the
[1:46:46] first temple
[1:46:48] that solomon built but the elders wept
[1:46:52] because this temple was a fulfillment of
[1:46:55] prophecy
[1:46:56] that god said where you've went away i'd
[1:46:58] bring you back home again
[1:47:00] i'd bring you right back here it was a
[1:47:02] testimony
[1:47:05] of the finishing work of the lord jesus
[1:47:07] christ
[1:47:10] to you amen when he looks at you
[1:47:16] you see the word when it comes like you
[1:47:18] think of how
[1:47:20] god was even bringing it right here last
[1:47:23] last sunday and this is how the word
[1:47:26] comes
[1:47:27] the word comes to let you know of who
[1:47:29] you are
[1:47:33] it's something that raises within you it
[1:47:35] raises in a life
[1:47:37] that even if a life in itself let's say
[1:47:40] a person they don't have the baptism of
[1:47:42] the holy ghost
[1:47:44] but that word it has to tell you who you
[1:47:46] are
[1:47:47] has to tell you what belongs to you and
[1:47:49] you rise to that place
[1:47:51] to say lord jesus i receive
[1:47:55] what belongs to me it's got to be the
[1:47:58] standard of the word
[1:47:59] to let you know who you are
[1:48:03] it's him that lets us know who we are
[1:48:07] and to think of how that here when paul
[1:48:10] could write
[1:48:12] that whom he's called we predestinated
[1:48:15] he called and who he called he justified
[1:48:18] who he's justified he's already
[1:48:20] glorified
[1:48:23] i would say that here throughout this
[1:48:25] building there's not one of us
[1:48:27] that would think of ourselves as a
[1:48:29] finished work right amen
[1:48:32] but god already sees you as a finished
[1:48:35] product
[1:48:37] he's not looking down here in time but
[1:48:40] he looks from eternity
[1:48:42] to eternity remember
[1:48:46] he is sufficient to finish what he
[1:48:49] started
[1:48:51] he knew all of this would come in here
[1:48:53] in between and it's god himself
[1:48:56] who is moving in our lives yes
[1:48:59] it's god dealing with our lives we just
[1:49:02] leave you with this
[1:49:05] but it's not god picking us up
[1:49:09] and moving us right amen
[1:49:15] remember and i know i keep rem i keep
[1:49:17] coming back to this services after
[1:49:19] services
[1:49:20] it's just something that's so precious
[1:49:23] and brother branham was sitting there in
[1:49:24] that house
[1:49:27] he could not tell so-and-so nor could he
[1:49:30] go
[1:49:31] and put things where they needed to be
[1:49:32] put right
[1:49:34] he couldn't say hey you need to be
[1:49:36] sitting over there no no no no
[1:49:38] somebody take the chair away from they
[1:49:39] don't need to be there
[1:49:42] hey the glasses need to be over here or
[1:49:44] the handkerchief or somebody's
[1:49:45] they gotta come in that door that's
[1:49:48] right
[1:49:50] let me just leave you with this the
[1:49:52] vision
[1:49:53] is sure
[1:49:58] amen nobody
[1:50:02] could put that handkerchief or that
[1:50:04] person there or those glasses there
[1:50:06] that all had to come about in the time
[1:50:09] that's right
[1:50:10] if you and i can put ourselves up maybe
[1:50:12] you're the handkerchief
[1:50:14] maybe i'm the glasses
[1:50:17] when the word is coming forth as we take
[1:50:20] that word in
[1:50:21] listen friends it's got to be us for
[1:50:23] taking that word in
[1:50:24] amen it's not about what she's i don't
[1:50:26] understand all this i don't it's
[1:50:27] just take it in and be and be prayerful
[1:50:29] with it take it in and let it be one
[1:50:31] with your life
[1:50:33] let it just say god move me in position
[1:50:38] let the world just move in my life with
[1:50:40] things in position where they need to be
[1:50:43] and let god bring things into position
[1:50:46] so that you can stand i can stand
[1:50:49] yes like paul stood and paul could stand
[1:50:52] brother aaron at the end and say
[1:50:53] i finished my course
[1:50:58] i've done i've run what god's asked me
[1:51:00] to do
[1:51:01] the lord jesus could say in john 17 i
[1:51:04] finished the work thou gavest me
[1:51:07] to me
[1:51:10] but that was only the beginning as acts
[1:51:12] 1 says that which he began to do
[1:51:16] he finished what he was supposed to do
[1:51:21] each and every one of us have a part
[1:51:25] have a purpose there's a course
[1:51:28] everything within it and it takes the
[1:51:31] word itself
[1:51:32] moving in our life let's just laying
[1:51:35] ourselves open to the word
[1:51:36] and let the word have the right away
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:40] i said this to you over and over but
[1:51:42] it's true if
[1:51:43] listen friends god's not going to accept
[1:51:45] excuses if i don't understand it
[1:51:47] when you can come to him just like
[1:51:49] zachariah said
[1:51:50] thou knowest what this meanest what does
[1:51:53] this mean
[1:51:54] and god himself will always come he'll
[1:51:57] reveal himself
[1:51:59] remember they walked with him in luke
[1:52:02] 24.
[1:52:03] cleopas and a friend walked with him in
[1:52:05] luke 24.
[1:52:09] but then they invited him amen
[1:52:12] come in yes amen come here
[1:52:15] and when he came in he did something
[1:52:18] that made it known this is this is who
[1:52:21] it is
[1:52:22] yes it's him it's him
[1:52:26] and just it's taking the word in let the
[1:52:29] word let it change
[1:52:30] our lives you realize friends it
[1:52:32] wouldn't matter
[1:52:34] how much of like the word where they
[1:52:37] could set underneath the disciples could
[1:52:39] sit right underneath the lord jesus
[1:52:40] if they didn't obey it they didn't act
[1:52:44] upon it
[1:52:45] it would do them no good are you hearing
[1:52:48] me
[1:52:49] there was 500 the bible says saw him
[1:52:52] ascend
[1:52:54] that's the book of corinthians 500 saw
[1:52:56] him a sin
[1:52:57] 120 went in the upper room
[1:53:00] what happened to the other 380.
[1:53:05] 120 went in the upper room but the bible
[1:53:07] says over 500 in the book of corinthians
[1:53:10] saw him a sin what happened
[1:53:13] the other 380 found other things to do
[1:53:17] but 120 saw what took place and they
[1:53:20] walked on in
