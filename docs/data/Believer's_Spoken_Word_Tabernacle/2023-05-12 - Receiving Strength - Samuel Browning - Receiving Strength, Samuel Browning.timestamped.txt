[12:57] and the unspoken prayer request tonight
[12:59] uplifted me
[13:00] and just go together with our brother
[13:08] I can just take a quick moment give a
[13:11] quick testimony it was a couple weeks
[13:12] ago probably three weeks ago or so I was
[13:14] going through a real kind of a deep
[13:17] trial on Satan kind of beating me up
[13:19] about uh
[13:20] decisions I made back when I was real
[13:23] little and when God was first call in my
[13:25] life and
[13:26] went a different direction and uh
[13:29] and then you know the Lord called me
[13:31] back but Satan was you know trying to
[13:32] say look at how many
[13:34] you know how how long you you was out in
[13:37] the world and such and the decisions you
[13:38] made there and and the things that could
[13:40] have been better and uh
[13:42] brother Brian actually got up uh a few
[13:44] uh Thursday nights ago and was talking
[13:47] about uh how the children of Israel when
[13:51] they went through and why it was dry
[13:53] ground that they they walked on and he
[13:55] said you know it's because of the mud
[13:57] pits in Egypt and boy the Lord really
[13:59] spoke to me through that just that
[14:01] little thing he shared there and how
[14:03] yeah we were on the in the treadmill in
[14:06] Egypt there and going around in circles
[14:08] through the mud and such but God has set
[14:12] our feet on dry ground and not only that
[14:14] we're not not on the treadmill said
[14:16] we're going somewhere so just wanted to
[14:19] share that sometimes just those little
[14:21] things you know the Lord lays it on your
[14:23] heart to say something you just never
[14:24] know who's going to touch because I
[14:25] could just tell you that really touched
[14:27] me and bless me and help me and just
[14:30] change my uh changed my direction and
[14:33] that impression just started to lift
[14:34] right then so let's just go before him
[14:37] in prayer and
[14:39] dear Lord Jesus we just so love you Lord
[14:42] and you're just such a caring father
[14:44] Lord and just always mindful of our
[14:46] needs Lord and what we need and and your
[14:49] timing is always perfect Lord and we
[14:51] just want to say thank you Lord for for
[14:53] watching over us so much Lord and for
[14:56] taking care of us Lord
[14:58] and Lord sometimes Lord we just uh in a
[15:01] way we can look at the the things the
[15:04] trials and the Lord to even the issues
[15:07] and such we go through and and kind of
[15:09] sometimes even give those
[15:11] a little too much credit Lord we're
[15:13] we're Lord uh the prophet taught us Lord
[15:16] that even though our tests and trials
[15:18] and and the different things we go
[15:19] through is just because there's an
[15:21] attribute inside of you that you are
[15:23] wanting to make more manifest to us Lord
[15:26] and so Lord I just pray Lord even even
[15:29] in the prayer request uh tonight Lord
[15:31] for you to just move on the scene and
[15:34] just make yourself more real Lord in
[15:36] that situation than each each and every
[15:38] one of the situations Lord and just
[15:40] Lord the the purpose of each and every
[15:43] one Lord is so we can know you better
[15:45] and Lord that we can become a closer in
[15:48] fellowship and trust you more Lord and
[15:51] Lord let's uh help us Lord just to not
[15:54] focus so much on on even the problem in
[15:56] that but the one who can solve it Lord
[15:58] no one one who knows Lord why it's there
[16:01] and where it's going Lord and the things
[16:04] that we we can't see and we
[16:06] sometimes they're just kind of kind of
[16:09] feel at a loss a little bit just to get
[16:11] our Focus Lord on you Lord

[41:41] [Applause]
[41:42] for
[41:44] whatever
[41:47] it takes
[41:49] to draw closer
[41:52] to you Lord
[41:55] that's why I'll be willing
[42:00] to
[42:02] do
[42:03] [Music]
[42:05] for whatever
[42:09] it takes
[42:12] to be more like you
[42:18] that's what I'll be willing
[42:23] to do
[42:26] can we sing it together now for whatever
[42:30] [Music]
[42:31] it takes to draw closer to you Lord
[42:35] [Music]
[42:37] to you Lord
[42:40] oh that's what I'll be willing to do
[42:44] I'll be willing to do
[42:49] for
[42:50] one
[42:54] it takes
[42:56] or to be more like you
[43:02] you that's what I'll be willing
[43:08] to do
[43:11] [Music]
[43:14] amen is that how you feel tonight
[43:17] whatever it takes
[43:19] whatever it takes Lord
[43:21] I want to be closer to you
[43:25] I'm sure if we can just have we have
[43:27] that resolve in our hearts no matter the
[43:29] path I'm sure it would probably be some
[43:31] paths that we would not necessarily take
[43:35] you know brother Branham looked in
[43:36] certain things that God had taken him
[43:39] through
[43:40] that at the moment and at the time and
[43:44] for who knows how many months and how
[43:46] many how long he went but when he saw
[43:49] his little baby cross-eyed
[43:52] dying
[43:54] I mean he went to pray and God just was
[43:56] like a black sheep came down
[43:59] brother Brown talks about how that he
[44:01] said
[44:03] when he looked back at that time he said
[44:04] for what God has been able to do because
[44:08] of that
[44:10] where there's not been one cross side
[44:14] child that's ever crossed that platform
[44:17] but what God
[44:18] has not healed him
[44:21] and so In the Flesh and other things
[44:24] you would rather have went the other way
[44:26] but it well I want you to catch this
[44:28] that it brought something
[44:30] out in the prophet's life
[44:33] that only God could do as he yielded to
[44:36] God
[44:37] and what it ended up becoming is it
[44:39] becoming a great blessing to the people
[44:42] of God
[44:43] to where there wasn't one cross-eyed
[44:45] child they could cross there
[44:48] I'm sure there's probably some paths
[44:50] tonight
[44:52] maybe we've come through paths that God
[44:54] will take us through
[44:56] and I say God let me just
[44:59] whatever it takes I want to get closer
[45:01] to you
[45:02] I want to get closer to you
[45:05] no matter what circumstances no matter
[45:07] what comes what arises I want to get
[45:09] closer
[45:10] to you Lord
[45:12] let's just bow our hearts in a word of
[45:14] prayer tonight

[46:39] inner Spirit as well Lord

[46:44] that comes our way
[46:45] God we can become very weary
[46:48] Even in our spirit Lord and we just ask
[46:51] that God that you would just move in a
[46:53] special way and give her strength Lord

[47:23] grace is sufficient even now Lord
[47:26] father we ask that God you'll continue
[47:28] to give him strength Lord against sister
[47:30] Linda Lord
[47:31] we miss them Lord we miss each one Lord
[47:34] that father when they're not here Lord

[47:40] guide us now in the remaining part of
[47:42] this service
[47:43] in the precious name
[47:45] of Jesus Christ
[47:47] amen and amen
[47:50] amen God bless you tonight as you turn
[47:52] in your Bibles to Job chapter 23 it
[47:55] might like to say thank you to the
[47:56] musicians and a man even for
[48:00] Benjamin allowed me to Spring that song
[48:02] on you there I know you knew it but um
[48:06] I didn't I knew it pretty well with just
[48:09] singing it to myself but uh
[48:11] I just couldn't get into that but I'm so
[48:13] thankful for God's grace tonight we
[48:16] wanted to go take a little step further
[48:19] here in job 23 tonight and
[48:23] just ask that the Lord would just help
[48:25] us here
[48:26] in this looking at this here
[48:29] and I want to just read here through the
[48:31] first few scriptures of job 23.
[48:35] and job answered and he said
[48:39] even today is my complaint bitter my
[48:45] stroke is heavier
[48:46] than my groaning
[48:49] all that I knew where I might find him
[48:54] that I might come even to his seat
[48:58] I would order my cause before him
[49:02] and fill my mouth with arguments
[49:06] I would know the words which he would
[49:09] answer me
[49:10] and understand what he would say unto me
[49:15] will he plead against me with his great
[49:17] power
[49:18] no
[49:20] but he would put strength in me
[49:25] there the righteous might dispute with
[49:28] him
[49:29] so should I be delivered forever
[49:32] from my judge
[49:34] amen I'd like to just speak tonight just
[49:37] a little thought out of there on
[49:38] receiving
[49:39] strength receiving strength may God
[49:43] bless you bless the reading of the word
[49:44] as you're being seated
[49:47] I wanted just to say when we know you've
[49:51] had prayer and we've been praying for
[49:52] brother Tommy and the Lord was just my
[49:55] father-in-law had just
[49:57] brought him through just so marvelously
[49:59] there in the surgery and certainly it's
[50:04] a journey that's there even before him
[50:07] and before them and but God is is
[50:10] certainly faithful through it all and we
[50:12] just want to say we certainly appreciate
[50:14] the Lord it meant for his hand of mercy
[50:17] and also appreciate each and every one
[50:19] of you your prayers and continued prayer
[50:21] amen as he is going through the recovery
[50:24] I just want to say I uh the staff that
[50:28] was there
[50:30] at Leary Memorial and some a lot of that
[50:32] right there is where my dad had a lot of
[50:34] things taken care of as well too they
[50:36] were just just exceptional just over the
[50:40] top and I just really appreciate that
[50:43] and I pray God will just richly bless
[50:45] them as well for their for their
[50:48] attentiveness and and everything and how
[50:51] that they've been so mindful in the
[50:53] advice and direction that they've given
[50:55] throughout and so I I really appreciate
[50:58] that I appreciate good doctors
[51:00] I appreciate nurses I appreciate all of
[51:02] that and um so we just thank God for his
[51:05] grace and as I look at this here tonight
[51:09] we have been looking there in job 22 and
[51:13] where the Lord had us there and I don't
[51:15] want to say a pause but there were
[51:17] things that God desired to bring out
[51:18] there in job 22 and to really answer the
[51:21] question that yes God does consider the
[51:25] life of his children uh very profitable
[51:28] unto himself because there's a purpose
[51:30] that we're called to serve and God
[51:33] himself is the one who serves that
[51:35] purpose through our lives as we're
[51:37] yielded to him and there's many things
[51:39] like we looked at it that can come our
[51:41] way to always try to hinder the for our
[51:45] lives from being very useful and that of
[51:48] just being an instrument that's
[51:50] available to God and that that means
[51:52] something that it's always where it's
[51:55] available to where it's not occupied
[51:57] because we understand that there's
[51:59] always a battle that's going on and
[52:01] Satan is always very uh
[52:05] strategically trying to absorb our time
[52:09] and trying to absorb Our Lives
[52:11] and he would like to do that in every
[52:14] way that he can and I I believe with all
[52:16] my heart that it's God's desire when
[52:19] brother Brown tells us he says God help
[52:22] the people to recognize that their duty
[52:24] is not to go home work come back home
[52:28] read the newspaper go to bed get back up
[52:30] do the same thing the next day but he
[52:32] said we're put here for a purpose and
[52:35] that purpose is to be instruments of
[52:39] yours
[52:40] that's our top priority that's our top
[52:42] purpose and and that's the part that I
[52:45] we can agree together to say God let
[52:47] everything else I let it all be set
[52:50] aside that we might be instruments that
[52:53] are available to you
[52:55] in other words where it's not something
[52:57] that's tied up you know if you have
[52:59] something a tool or or something and
[53:01] somebody knows you have that tool and
[53:03] they call you up and say Hey Brother
[53:06] Carlos can I borrow this tool Brother
[53:07] Carlos said I would love to loan it to
[53:09] you but so-and-so's using it right now
[53:12] it's a little tied up
[53:14] that's something that in our lives right
[53:17] now that we know that if God's asking
[53:20] we always want to be in that place to
[53:22] say God let my life be in a place that's
[53:25] available to you
[53:28] and I want to stay and we want to stay
[53:30] in that place and you know there's no
[53:32] way for me or you to know all the things
[53:34] that are before us but I we have a
[53:36] confidence that as we stay in tune and
[53:38] in fellowship with God that God Will
[53:41] Make A Way and God will minister to us
[53:43] the very things that we have need of
[53:45] that would further even help us to be
[53:48] more yielded and more sensitive to his
[53:51] leading I think of this scripture out of
[53:54] uh job 23 and you know when we look at
[53:57] this with job job is still in the midst
[54:01] of uh not understanding he doesn't know
[54:04] what's taking place he hasn't heard from
[54:06] God that is something that's very
[54:09] strange to job he doesn't know God's not
[54:13] answered him on what's taken place and
[54:15] he's got all this accusation around him
[54:18] of why things are happening and why they
[54:21] are and yet job is standing in the midst
[54:24] of it all and this this very scripture
[54:27] in job 23 3 6 brother Brandon will even
[54:30] draw from this in the in the church age
[54:32] book and when he's dealing with tests
[54:34] and trials and so forth and he will
[54:37] refer to this last part of the scripture
[54:39] he says what job is saying that through
[54:41] the tests and trials God puts strength
[54:44] in us and I want to just say this that
[54:47] we I can go on record and I believe
[54:49] there's other believers here tonight
[54:51] that can say that in the midst of the
[54:54] tests and trials God gives us strength
[54:58] and with the the greatest strength that
[55:00] we have need of when we realize that for
[55:03] us to even serve God for the really
[55:05] serve him in the right way we've had to
[55:08] receive his strength and that only comes
[55:10] as we've let go of Our Own Strength to
[55:13] receive God's strength and as we go on
[55:16] day by day Moment by moment year by year
[55:19] we're going to need the strength of
[55:21] almighty God and what's important very
[55:24] simple title receiving strength but to
[55:27] receive something is to accept it and
[55:29] that's the very things that we want to
[55:31] be simple enough just to accept it it'd
[55:34] be like this tonight if I was handing
[55:37] out hundred dollar bills I'm sure that
[55:39] you know we would graciously humbly
[55:43] accept those hundred dollar bills if I
[55:46] was if I was handing out to you know
[55:48] paying for men meals and lunches and
[55:51] dinner I'm sure there were you know
[55:53] humility would rise and hey you can take
[55:55] care of my dinner you can take care of
[55:57] all of this and we would graciously what
[56:00] would accept it what would that look
[56:02] like it would simply be take me up on
[56:05] the offer that's being extended and and
[56:08] this is the Simplicity of the Gospel of
[56:11] Jesus Christ God's desire is he has
[56:14] everything and all that we have need of
[56:17] and all that we have to do all God asks
[56:20] us to do is to believe him is to receive
[56:23] what he's trying to give to us not to
[56:26] even not to rationalize it not to reason
[56:29] it not to determine whether we're worthy
[56:31] or not because the truth of the matter
[56:33] is you can never be worthy enough that's
[56:37] why it's called Grace
[56:39] yeah
[56:41] and we have to even be able to receive
[56:43] that
[56:45] now job said he put strength in me and I
[56:48] want to just start with this part of it
[56:49] out of three kinds of Believers brother
[56:51] Branham is praying and I don't have this
[56:53] quote up but I wanted just to listen to
[56:55] it brother random is praying and he says
[56:57] tonight Lord here we are coming again as
[57:01] a needy people for we are ever in need
[57:05] of thee and as long as we're here on
[57:08] Earth we know that'll be the cry for
[57:12] we're in a battle the battle is Raging
[57:14] and you promised and said how the enemy
[57:17] would be like a roaring lion he's loosed
[57:19] among the people we can see it
[57:21] everywhere like a roaring liaring lion
[57:23] devouring what he may because he knows
[57:26] his time is short but we have a father
[57:28] who cares for his little ones and to
[57:31] thee we flee with our request tonight
[57:35] Lord and we pray that you'll grant them
[57:39] in Psalms 28 verse 6 David said blessed
[57:43] be the Lord because he hath heard the
[57:47] voice of my supplications
[57:50] the Lord is my strength and my shield my
[57:54] heart trusted in him and I am helped I
[57:58] want you to notice this my strength is
[58:00] my shield and my heart is trusting in
[58:03] Him and I am helped or supported
[58:08] I mean you know it's good to be
[58:09] supported
[58:11] there's sometimes where there's things
[58:13] that it just that we're not able to
[58:15] actually pass over we must be supported
[58:19] through it
[58:20] he says and I am helped therefore my
[58:24] heart greatly rejoices and my with my
[58:27] song will I praise him the Lord I love
[58:31] this verse the Lord is their strength
[58:34] and he is the saving strength of his
[58:38] anointed
[58:39] so not only do it not only is the new
[58:42] birth strength in our soul where he is
[58:45] the strength of our life he's the source
[58:47] of our strength but we depend on him as
[58:52] our saving strength he is our saving
[58:56] strength so notice as in brother Branham
[58:59] says the uniting time and time he's
[59:02] saying God I we thank you for all these
[59:04] things now give us Thy word for Thy word
[59:07] is truth bless our souls and give us the
[59:11] grace that we need that we might draw
[59:14] from it the promises of God tonight in
[59:17] the word to sustain us through the rest
[59:21] of this week did I read that right
[59:26] give us
[59:27] this what's Grace tonight then we might
[59:30] draw from the promises of God tonight in
[59:34] the word to sustain us through the rest
[59:37] of this week granted I'm just going to
[59:39] tell you I need God's strength day by
[59:43] day
[59:44] we need God's strength Moment by moment
[59:49] and every time as we come not only
[59:52] together tonight we come together in
[59:55] every service and even daily Lord I need
[59:59] your strength and as we look at a
[1:00:01] service Lord I'm looking to hear from
[1:00:04] you I'm in need of strength from you
[1:00:07] Lord
[1:00:08] Psalms 46 1 God is our refuge and
[1:00:14] strength a very present help in trouble
[1:00:18] can we say that together God is our
[1:00:22] refuge and strength a very present help
[1:00:26] in trouble
[1:00:31] he's our refuge
[1:00:34] he's our place that we run to
[1:00:38] it's who we look to
[1:00:41] he is our refuge now if in order for
[1:00:44] there to be a refuge it speaks there
[1:00:46] would be trouble and endangerment around
[1:00:49] but there is a place of safety there is
[1:00:53] a place that we can run to there is a
[1:00:56] place that though the storm is happening
[1:00:58] all around it's just like at times when
[1:01:00] I've walked out there and here that's
[1:01:03] raining and raining it's just pouring
[1:01:05] down boy that porch is awful nice right
[1:01:07] now it's nice to be able to stand there
[1:01:10] while the rain is coming down the porch
[1:01:12] doesn't take away the rain it only gives
[1:01:15] me a place to stay while the rain is
[1:01:17] falling
[1:01:18] and that's what David is saying God is
[1:01:21] my place to stand while everything else
[1:01:25] is going around I've got a place to
[1:01:27] stand he's a refuge and strength of very
[1:01:31] present Health in the time of trouble in
[1:01:34] Isaiah 28 5 this scripture speaks I hear
[1:01:37] of the hour we're standing in of the
[1:01:40] Holy Ghost Field group of Believers the
[1:01:42] Bride of Jesus Christ in that day shall
[1:01:46] the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of
[1:01:48] Glory and for a diadem of beauty unto
[1:01:51] the residue of his people and for a
[1:01:54] spirit of judgment to them that sitteth
[1:01:57] in judgment and for strength to them
[1:02:01] that turned the battle to the gate
[1:02:04] battles were in a battle I read that
[1:02:06] opening quote we're going to be in
[1:02:08] battles but it matters where do you turn
[1:02:11] the battle to turning it to the gate who
[1:02:13] is the gate who is the door he is the
[1:02:16] gate he is the entrance he is the door
[1:02:18] and you know what the gate is the gate
[1:02:21] is where every transaction has been
[1:02:24] settled when Boaz was there to redeem
[1:02:27] Ruth he went to the gate there and
[1:02:31] before the elders he settled the
[1:02:33] transaction and he redeemed Ruth because
[1:02:36] it's in the gate where every transaction
[1:02:39] for every promise has been settled so
[1:02:43] here for the people of God in this hour
[1:02:46] where the Lord of hosts his presence is
[1:02:49] a Crown of Glory a diadem of beauty and
[1:02:53] it is a spirit of judgment a discernment
[1:02:55] among the people of God of discerning
[1:02:58] not only right from wrong but Discerning
[1:03:00] when situations arise by having our
[1:03:03] lives just sharpen and by the word of
[1:03:06] almighty God that you know this in every
[1:03:09] situation the battle is to be turned to
[1:03:11] the gate I tell you we fail the very
[1:03:14] moment that we look for some other means
[1:03:16] to satisfy or to settle or to overcome a
[1:03:20] battle we're already defeated go ahead
[1:03:22] and get the white flag out but when you
[1:03:24] can realize the battle is to be turned
[1:03:28] to the gate is to be turned to the Lord
[1:03:30] not my reasoning Not My Thoughts not
[1:03:33] what I think not what I feel but turn it
[1:03:36] to the gate that's my strength
[1:03:40] out of the message the token brother
[1:03:42] Brahm said God is your joy
[1:03:45] God is your strength knowing the message
[1:03:48] knowing the truth that's our sufficiency
[1:03:52] now
[1:03:54] he's my all sufficiency in him all
[1:03:57] things I have need of is in him that's
[1:04:01] our strength my help coming from the
[1:04:04] Lord you Christians look at this
[1:04:06] admonition Look to Him for your joy
[1:04:13] see when unbelief sets in then you have
[1:04:17] to start looking for other things for
[1:04:18] your joy
[1:04:20] I could spin we could go in the Book of
[1:04:23] Job and spend time on that but you see
[1:04:25] how Satan's trap is to bring it to
[1:04:27] everything else let me tell you
[1:04:28] something without Christ really being
[1:04:31] first in your life all the rest of the
[1:04:33] things of this Earth as they grow they
[1:04:36] fade and everything else you really you
[1:04:38] can't enjoy them the way that God
[1:04:40] intends for them to be enjoyed because
[1:04:42] for real enjoyment it's not worshiping
[1:04:45] them it's not where you give them
[1:04:46] precedence or cut out God when it makes
[1:04:49] what makes room for that no it's God
[1:04:52] first and all other things will be added
[1:04:56] is that right
[1:04:58] this is a simple simple simple remedies
[1:05:01] you Christians Look to Him for your joy
[1:05:05] Look to Him for your strength you know
[1:05:08] David said restore to me the joy of thy
[1:05:10] salvation right David never lost his
[1:05:13] salvation but he lost his Joy
[1:05:17] Israel in Joel 2 lost their Joy
[1:05:21] right but God makes a way that that Joy
[1:05:24] can be restored
[1:05:26] he lets us know where things have been
[1:05:29] let down and hey The Joy can be restored
[1:05:32] sometimes it's just through the monotony
[1:05:35] of the cares of this life
[1:05:38] right right
[1:05:40] oh help me now
[1:05:42] Look to Him for your strength look for
[1:05:45] him for your happiness he is my peace he
[1:05:49] is my joy he is my love he is my life
[1:05:52] that's a covenant the token upon the
[1:05:55] door
[1:05:57] Psalms 138 verse 3 in the day when I
[1:06:02] cried thou answerest me and strengthens
[1:06:06] me with strength in my soul
[1:06:10] so he Cried unto the Lord and God heard
[1:06:15] him and strengthened him with strength
[1:06:18] in his soul God knows how to get his
[1:06:21] word his strength to where it needs to
[1:06:24] be in our life
[1:06:25] is that right you can look to all other
[1:06:29] source of of of refuge and all the other
[1:06:33] measures and it all leave you empty at
[1:06:36] the end of the day well I'm going to see
[1:06:38] what so-and-so says about it and I'll
[1:06:40] I'll see what so-and-so says about it
[1:06:41] and you know what you have a bunch of
[1:06:43] opinions
[1:06:45] come on Friends well so-and-so's been
[1:06:48] through this so-and-so has been through
[1:06:50] that but you're a Believer you've got a
[1:06:52] greater access than so and so and so and
[1:06:55] so and so and so and so and so the Bible
[1:06:57] says we're to take all things to God In
[1:07:01] Prayer
[1:07:03] hallelujah hallelujah well I ain't heard
[1:07:06] an answer well no answer don't mean go
[1:07:08] ahead
[1:07:10] I don't know this is this is free
[1:07:15] we've got an access in this hour
[1:07:19] take it to God in prayer and he'll
[1:07:21] strengthen us with strength in our soul
[1:07:23] I'm glad about that Isaiah 41 10.
[1:07:26] fear thou not for I am with thee be not
[1:07:30] dismayed for I am that God I will
[1:07:34] strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay
[1:07:39] I will uphold thee with the right hand
[1:07:42] of my righteousness
[1:07:46] I want you to just to draw upon this
[1:07:50] remember job says with his great power
[1:07:54] will he plead against me now I'm going
[1:07:57] to tell you when job is making the
[1:07:59] statements that he's making in job 23
[1:08:02] what we just read at least just just
[1:08:04] reading the first few verses there alone
[1:08:07] job is making statements that he knows
[1:08:10] where he's standing
[1:08:13] he's already been through a lot of
[1:08:15] accusations but job knows he knows where
[1:08:17] he's standing he knows there's nothing
[1:08:19] out from under the blood he knows where
[1:08:21] he's standing with God and that's why
[1:08:23] job is saying oh then I might hear from
[1:08:25] him then I might come before his seat
[1:08:28] job's not in a place of wondering have I
[1:08:32] done everything have I done all that God
[1:08:34] has asked me to do job knows I've done
[1:08:37] all that God has asked me to do I don't
[1:08:40] know what's taking place I don't know
[1:08:42] what's going on but he had but he has
[1:08:44] this confidence if I were to get before
[1:08:46] his throne he will not use his power to
[1:08:50] plead against me but he will put
[1:08:52] strength in me
[1:08:55] I tell you that's a man that knows his
[1:08:57] God that's a brother and sister that
[1:09:00] knows God that if I can just get into
[1:09:02] God's presence then God will put
[1:09:04] strength in my life he's not there to
[1:09:07] consume me he's there to strengthen me
[1:09:10] and encourage me and direct me in the
[1:09:13] right ways
[1:09:16] fear not I'm with thee be not dismayed
[1:09:19] for I am that God and I will strengthen
[1:09:21] Thee I will help you I will uphold thee
[1:09:24] with the right hand of my righteousness
[1:09:29] I want you to think drawing
[1:09:31] drawing from this strength God's promise
[1:09:35] how that he would take care
[1:09:39] of his children of his children and of
[1:09:41] his people
[1:09:43] I wonder the scripture that I'm about to
[1:09:45] read
[1:09:46] I wonder if this wasn't
[1:09:48] one that the Hebrew children
[1:09:51] relied upon
[1:09:55] see when they came to a situation
[1:09:58] God could have completely
[1:10:01] just tore the whole furnace down
[1:10:04] God could are you hearing me God could
[1:10:06] have tore the whole furnace down there
[1:10:08] could have just been bone no furnace
[1:10:11] no problem trials before you I'll just
[1:10:14] tear it all down
[1:10:15] attested before it would just tear it
[1:10:18] all down
[1:10:19] and God could do that let me tell you
[1:10:21] how powerful God's strength is it was
[1:10:23] God's strength that brought him out of
[1:10:25] Egypt
[1:10:27] it wasn't by the strength of a man's
[1:10:30] hand it was God's hand that brought him
[1:10:32] out
[1:10:33] but even in God's strength they had to
[1:10:36] obey his word and when they obeyed his
[1:10:38] word it released the strength of God on
[1:10:41] their behalf let me tell you something
[1:10:42] even in the midst of a tester trial I
[1:10:45] don't want to dwell here tonight but
[1:10:46] even in the midst of a tester trial it's
[1:10:49] not a time to start shortcutting or
[1:10:51] pulling back on God
[1:10:54] it's in the midst of a tester trial
[1:10:56] where you need to say Lord I'm going to
[1:10:59] take up my praise my dedication to
[1:11:01] another level I don't feel like it you
[1:11:04] don't serve God by your feelings
[1:11:06] you serve God by faith and faith is not
[1:11:10] your feelings and your feelings ain't
[1:11:12] faith
[1:11:15] I'm not going to preach that one tonight
[1:11:17] but the reality that within it is that
[1:11:21] the main the thing that we want to look
[1:11:23] at is even the strength that God would
[1:11:26] release to you and I that would come our
[1:11:28] way I I let's just read this here on
[1:11:31] Isaiah 41 43 1 but now thus saith the
[1:11:34] Lord that created thee o Jacob and he
[1:11:37] that formed thee o Israel fear not for I
[1:11:41] have redeemed Thee I have called thee by
[1:11:43] name Thou Art mine when thou passeth
[1:11:47] through the waters
[1:11:48] I will be with thee
[1:11:51] and through the rivers they shall not
[1:11:54] overflow me
[1:11:56] well why not just dry them up
[1:12:01] why not just rhyme up Lord
[1:12:04] what I have to walk through them and the
[1:12:07] fears could come that this is going to
[1:12:09] overflow me
[1:12:15] I won't ask the question but probably
[1:12:17] there's some here tonight they probably
[1:12:18] could identify me of a time that almost
[1:12:20] drowned
[1:12:23] that ain't a fun that ain't a fun memory
[1:12:25] I don't know how how that it all
[1:12:27] happened but somebody came and pulled me
[1:12:28] out of that pool
[1:12:31] I want you to think about there's been
[1:12:33] times in our lives we feel the waters
[1:12:36] it's about to overflow me but God said
[1:12:39] when they're when they feel like they're
[1:12:41] getting up to your neck and they're up
[1:12:43] here I'm still there
[1:12:48] but God gets you just remove the rivers
[1:12:51] no I am there to walk through them with
[1:12:54] you
[1:12:55] I'm telling you talking about a faithful
[1:12:57] friend this ain't somebody ditches you
[1:12:59] when the going gets tough this is one
[1:13:01] who stick it closer than a brother
[1:13:04] this is one who's there who's faithful
[1:13:06] even when we are not faithful he's
[1:13:09] faithful you don't want to stir
[1:13:10] something in us to say God that same
[1:13:13] life I believe inside of me that it
[1:13:16] produces faithfulness Lord
[1:13:20] pass through the waters I'll be with
[1:13:22] thee through the rivers they shall not
[1:13:24] overflow thee when thou walkest through
[1:13:27] the fire
[1:13:29] Thou shalt not be burned why don't just
[1:13:32] put it out
[1:13:34] why not just put the fire out
[1:13:39] can you imagine prayer requests coming
[1:13:40] in
[1:13:41] let's pray that the fire's put out
[1:13:45] let's pray that the fire is put out
[1:13:48] now you see what happens if our faith is
[1:13:51] let's pray that nothing comes back on
[1:13:53] this doctor's report I don't know how
[1:13:55] many times I've been asked to pray that
[1:13:56] way and throughout different times
[1:13:58] listen we pray for healing and I don't
[1:14:00] care what comes back on a doctor's
[1:14:02] report God is still greater than every
[1:14:06] doctor report
[1:14:08] but if my faith and your faith is well
[1:14:11] just pray that nothing comes back on the
[1:14:13] report let's pray and say God you hold
[1:14:16] my hand if there is something there Lord
[1:14:19] you are the Lord that healeth all my
[1:14:21] diseases it may not it don't even have
[1:14:24] to come back on the report but if it
[1:14:26] dies you're the Lord that healeth all my
[1:14:28] diseases you say brother Samuel what do
[1:14:30] you say I'm saying to have the right
[1:14:32] expectations because if that's your
[1:14:35] expectation well this is we're going to
[1:14:38] pray here and there'll not be nothing on
[1:14:39] the report what if something shows up on
[1:14:41] the report
[1:14:43] because it's not you or I that controls
[1:14:46] that
[1:14:48] are you hearing me listen friends that's
[1:14:51] why anything that's been done any
[1:14:53] testimony it has not been our faith
[1:14:55] that's done it it is God's Sovereign
[1:14:57] faith that has dropped down for that
[1:14:59] moment
[1:15:00] explain to me why on the platform that
[1:15:03] you can have certain cases that were
[1:15:05] healed and delivered even that little
[1:15:08] baby went out here it was with that Mass
[1:15:11] on its on its brain and there were
[1:15:13] others that were healed of cancer and
[1:15:15] that one went to an old country doctor
[1:15:18] that's what the holy spirit said there's
[1:15:20] an old country doctor out there that can
[1:15:22] perform that operation
[1:15:24] it wasn't that that person had less
[1:15:27] faith
[1:15:28] do you realize what that was when you
[1:15:30] read the whole testimony the greatest
[1:15:32] hospitals in the land Mayo Clinic had
[1:15:36] wrote that case off and said it can't be
[1:15:38] done
[1:15:39] to me I I believe this is greater than
[1:15:42] just Medical Science when I read across
[1:15:44] set in half for years I look at that as
[1:15:46] the God is showing us it don't take
[1:15:48] great big things it's just simple things
[1:15:51] that's just his nature there's an old
[1:15:53] country doctor with the highest of
[1:15:55] highest doctors said it can't be done
[1:15:57] but God had won an old country doctor
[1:15:59] they performed the surgery and the
[1:16:01] little boy was well
[1:16:05] sometimes we can't understand those
[1:16:06] things
[1:16:07] just like brother Branham you've heard
[1:16:09] it statue of early man Blasphemous names
[1:16:11] he talks about a sister in the
[1:16:14] congregation
[1:16:15] brother Brian you and I were just
[1:16:16] fellowshipping about this the other day
[1:16:19] sister Steffy
[1:16:20] and brother Brahms tells us on
[1:16:22] Blasphemous names he calls her out how
[1:16:24] that God had given a dream and he said
[1:16:27] if I had not prayed for you you wouldn't
[1:16:29] have made it through that surgery
[1:16:32] how couldn't God have just said
[1:16:34] move like that no surgery he could have
[1:16:38] I said he could have
[1:16:40] but sometimes the strength that we that
[1:16:43] God is wanting to send to us I wonder if
[1:16:46] we're wanting to receive it
[1:16:49] or we just get frustrated
[1:16:51] it didn't happen this way it's not going
[1:16:53] how I've been praying about it well the
[1:16:56] thing you've got to be careful of is
[1:16:57] that you're not putting God in a box
[1:17:00] but you've got to answer it this way
[1:17:02] you've got to do it this way because God
[1:17:05] won't do that
[1:17:08] he's God
[1:17:10] and God Alone
[1:17:12] and this is where when it said when I
[1:17:15] pass it through the water I don't know
[1:17:16] it strikes you like it strikes me but I
[1:17:19] will be with thee through the rivers
[1:17:21] they'll not overflow you when you walk
[1:17:23] through the fire you'll not be burned
[1:17:25] neither shall the flame Kindle upon me
[1:17:27] now let me just let me just say this
[1:17:31] footnote here I'm not signing up for a
[1:17:34] moment to be
[1:17:36] nearly overflowed
[1:17:38] I'm not signing up to walk through fire
[1:17:42] are you understanding me what we're
[1:17:44] dealing with here tonight is the
[1:17:46] strength that God gives to us that even
[1:17:49] in the midst of something strength comes
[1:17:52] not even in a way of well I don't have
[1:17:55] to deal with this or I'll just go beyond
[1:17:57] this many times the strength that God
[1:18:00] gives us is to go through something
[1:18:04] can you imagine if every time we prayed
[1:18:07] it was a miracle
[1:18:08] dear God we both we've been such a
[1:18:11] spoiled brat we wouldn't be able to look
[1:18:12] ourselves in the mirror
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:16] yeah and if we Define it he didn't get
[1:18:17] away
[1:18:20] not throwing herself on the floor we
[1:18:22] just throw ourselves out of church
[1:18:24] she asked porn we become because it
[1:18:26] ain't it ain't happening the way that I
[1:18:28] asked for it to happen it needs to
[1:18:29] happen this way but God in his infinite
[1:18:32] grace he knows what he's doing he's
[1:18:34] working on our lives to make something
[1:18:36] out of us
[1:18:39] Hallelujah
[1:18:41] second Corinthians 12 8.
[1:18:43] here's Paul
[1:18:45] I mean he knows that Paul had with his
[1:18:46] eyes they came and went
[1:18:48] I mean remember that
[1:18:50] they come and went
[1:18:52] Paul would even say you know you see how
[1:18:54] I write to you in big letters
[1:18:56] I wonder
[1:18:59] maybe it just happened at convenient
[1:19:01] times for him
[1:19:03] that is eyesight you know
[1:19:06] convenient headache on Monday morning
[1:19:08] you know convenient not feeling well and
[1:19:10] as my shift to start up right now it's
[1:19:13] Lord this this congestion is convenient
[1:19:16] retinal I I don't think it was
[1:19:18] convenient matter of fact for what God
[1:19:20] Called Paul to do Paul wrote many of the
[1:19:24] letters
[1:19:25] and testimonies of Liberty and freedom
[1:19:28] in Jesus Christ
[1:19:30] while in prison
[1:19:34] and when he wrote
[1:19:36] it wasn't convenient where it was let
[1:19:39] alone to have to write in big letters
[1:19:43] so when Paul was asking God three times
[1:19:46] he asked him because it would come and
[1:19:49] go come and go
[1:19:52] and he said to Paul I know we're
[1:19:54] familiar with it my grace is sufficient
[1:19:58] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[1:20:03] in weakness
[1:20:05] then Paul said most gladly therefore
[1:20:07] will I glory in my infirmities that the
[1:20:10] power of Christ May rest upon me now
[1:20:13] that Paul was not saying let me put in
[1:20:15] modern day language Paul was not saying
[1:20:17] that I get on Facebook or insta Twitter
[1:20:20] or you know twittergram or what
[1:20:23] Instagram and you know what I'm saying
[1:20:24] I'm just fun in there but you know he
[1:20:26] departed and say I get on there and say
[1:20:27] glory to God I've got this sickness
[1:20:30] again no that's not what he was saying
[1:20:32] Paul was saying I have learned to
[1:20:36] worship God even in the midst when this
[1:20:39] comes you know why because Paul realized
[1:20:43] God had spoke to him my grace is
[1:20:46] sufficient I wonder how many times the
[1:20:48] Dead the devil tried to bother him
[1:20:50] because the same messenger of Satan that
[1:20:52] came to Buffet him and his eyes would
[1:20:55] give out then they would come back in I
[1:20:57] wonder how many times that the enemy
[1:20:59] stood right next to him and said you
[1:21:01] prayed for others what about yourself he
[1:21:03] don't care for you and look look at your
[1:21:06] labors look at what's taking place he
[1:21:08] don't care for you and what he can what
[1:21:10] how Satan can no doubt stand there but
[1:21:13] when when Paul had an answer from God
[1:21:16] Paul said I realize it ain't going to be
[1:21:19] the last time it comes it might come 50
[1:21:22] more times it'll come in however often
[1:21:25] until I'm taken from this Earth but it
[1:21:28] is not going to steal my praise
[1:21:34] I say God help us to come up to this
[1:21:36] kind of level
[1:21:39] you can't what kind of level I'm telling
[1:21:41] you what kind of level to where we're no
[1:21:42] longer being read like a book in terms
[1:21:45] of we ought to be a written epistle but
[1:21:47] we shouldn't be a book that's being read
[1:21:48] oh Lord have mercy you tell they're down
[1:21:50] well you can tell they're feeling good
[1:21:52] well you can tell they're feeling down
[1:21:54] God help me to be the right kind of a
[1:21:56] book to be read not to be the that other
[1:21:58] kind of a book but don't talk to them
[1:22:00] today oh my what's going on that no we
[1:22:03] go God help me Lord Jesus to be in that
[1:22:06] manner to praise you in the midst of
[1:22:09] every situation
[1:22:11] now you men don't mean praise breaking
[1:22:13] her running around that didn't mean that
[1:22:15] it's all bad that's what it is but there
[1:22:17] is a Hallelujah there is a thank you
[1:22:19] Lord in your soul God your grace is
[1:22:22] sufficient to see me through verse 10
[1:22:24] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[1:22:27] and reproaches in Necessities in
[1:22:30] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[1:22:33] sake
[1:22:34] help me Lord
[1:22:36] help me Lord
[1:22:41] I think it's pretty safe to say nobody
[1:22:42] here sitting here could probably say I'm
[1:22:44] there already
[1:22:48] unless that's humility talking there I
[1:22:50] don't know
[1:22:51] for when I am weak
[1:22:55] weak then
[1:22:57] a part of Paul
[1:22:59] needed to be weakened
[1:23:02] and a part of Paul needed to be
[1:23:04] strengthened
[1:23:06] now brother Brian I love how he puts it
[1:23:08] in this manner how that Paul in his
[1:23:11] prayer to God was asking God to relieve
[1:23:15] him of that sickness Lord take away this
[1:23:18] infirmities so I can be stronger
[1:23:22] no doubt Paul had a good reasoning a
[1:23:25] good objective Lord take this away
[1:23:26] there's things that you know burning on
[1:23:29] my heart letters that are to be wrote to
[1:23:31] the Church of the Living God
[1:23:34] hello
[1:23:36] this is these were things that there
[1:23:38] could be an argument or an appeal that's
[1:23:41] to it but God responds to him that Paul
[1:23:45] in this way that when you're strong then
[1:23:50] I'm weak
[1:23:52] I can only be strong
[1:23:55] when you're weak
[1:23:57] I'm talking about strong in our life
[1:24:00] and this is why Paul said I'm thanking
[1:24:02] God that I got all of it out of me and
[1:24:04] when I get everything out of me then God
[1:24:06] can come in but as long as I got some of
[1:24:08] myself there then God can't come in
[1:24:12] and you know God gives us Grace because
[1:24:14] we smother him out
[1:24:16] now I said we
[1:24:18] brother Brandon said if I can give
[1:24:20] William Branham out of the way he's
[1:24:21] always getting in God's way
[1:24:23] he said to many times that he thinks
[1:24:26] that he can do something about something
[1:24:29] and he gets in the way
[1:24:33] oh my mama I said God
[1:24:36] help me Lord
[1:24:39] help me Lord now this strength Paul
[1:24:41] receives strength from God but it was in
[1:24:45] strength in terms of you'll never have
[1:24:48] any more troubles with your eyes
[1:24:49] whatsoever
[1:24:50] but God does that when God there are
[1:24:53] the Earth and he healed
[1:24:55] heal lives he touches lives Hey listen
[1:24:58] friends his healing is lasting
[1:25:00] is that right it's lasting
[1:25:03] but then how with this situation that
[1:25:06] had arose God instructs Paul that within
[1:25:09] it that my grace is sufficient through
[1:25:13] this all this was strength to endure to
[1:25:16] go through it
[1:25:18] Psalms 37 39 the salvation of the Lord
[1:25:22] the salvation of the righteousness of
[1:25:24] the Lord he is their strength
[1:25:27] in the time of trouble
[1:25:30] and the Lord shall help them once again
[1:25:32] support them and deliver them he shall
[1:25:35] deliver them from the wicked and save
[1:25:37] them because they trust in him I think
[1:25:40] about the picture of the footprints on
[1:25:41] the sands of time the person sees two
[1:25:44] sets then they look back and they say
[1:25:46] hey how come sometimes there was only
[1:25:48] one set of footprints and the Lord
[1:25:50] replied those are the times when I
[1:25:52] carried you
[1:25:55] he is our help our support our strength
[1:26:00] well I thank God for it when in the time
[1:26:04] of trouble
[1:26:05] God could very easily keep trouble from
[1:26:09] our lives
[1:26:11] but God uses trouble can I say it how
[1:26:14] the prophet said it in the message I
[1:26:16] know he said he puts bits in its mouth
[1:26:19] and makes it obey him
[1:26:22] and it only works to draw us closer to
[1:26:26] God
[1:26:29] Philippians 4 10 Paul said I rejoice in
[1:26:33] the Lord greatly that now at the last
[1:26:35] your care of me hath flourished again
[1:26:36] worrying you were all so careful but you
[1:26:39] lacked opportunity not that I speak in
[1:26:41] respect of want for I have learned in
[1:26:44] whatsoever State I am therewith to be
[1:26:47] content I know how to be a beast and I
[1:26:51] know how to abound everywhere and in all
[1:26:54] things I am instructed both to be full
[1:26:57] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[1:27:00] suffer need I can do all things through
[1:27:03] Christ which strengthen me
[1:27:06] can we say that together but say it as a
[1:27:09] real confession no matter what it is
[1:27:11] that we are going through see Paul was
[1:27:14] he said I am instructed
[1:27:19] come on Friends
[1:27:20] when the Holy Ghost has come in when the
[1:27:23] Holy Spirit comes into your life God
[1:27:25] doesn't say well you don't need the
[1:27:26] Bible no more no the Bible tells us that
[1:27:29] scripture all scripture is inspired and
[1:27:33] profitable for instruction into
[1:27:37] righteousness
[1:27:39] and correction
[1:27:40] it's the word that we receive strength
[1:27:43] from to guide us to direct us to to to
[1:27:47] to put us in the right course and Paul
[1:27:49] said I've learned evidently he's been
[1:27:52] through some experiences
[1:27:55] let's read it together
[1:27:57] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:28:01] strengtheneth me
[1:28:05] brother random talks about
[1:28:08] there was a
[1:28:10] condition that he battled in his life
[1:28:12] you know nervous condition
[1:28:15] and brother Graham talks about it like
[1:28:17] this in uniting time and sign of how he
[1:28:20] said that
[1:28:21] he had battled that
[1:28:23] and God came to him
[1:28:26] with that nervous condition and that and
[1:28:28] that tension that can be around about a
[1:28:32] life how many know that tension actually
[1:28:33] is a blessing
[1:28:35] brother Ram talks about tensions as a
[1:28:37] blessing
[1:28:37] because he said to a Christian you're
[1:28:39] always in your mind am I pleasing to the
[1:28:42] Lord am I pleasing to the Lord am I
[1:28:44] pleasing to the lord always within that
[1:28:46] in our life the program talks about this
[1:28:48] nervous condition and he talks about how
[1:28:51] he says he used to bother me so bad it
[1:28:53] would scare me but he said one day how
[1:28:56] he came to me and he told me it'll never
[1:29:01] scare you again
[1:29:04] now listen to this it'll never scare you
[1:29:08] again God didn't tell him you'll never
[1:29:10] get nervous again
[1:29:13] he said it'll just never scare you again
[1:29:18] are you with me brother Abraham said now
[1:29:20] he says I feel it he said I feel that
[1:29:23] nervousness
[1:29:24] I know it's there but I just go on
[1:29:28] because it don't scare me no more and
[1:29:31] I'm so thankful for that
[1:29:34] he said he could have told me it won't
[1:29:37] be no more just as well but he said
[1:29:41] you won't be scared no more
[1:29:44] wow
[1:29:47] what is that brother Samuel that's
[1:29:49] called receiving strength
[1:29:51] the prophet could have contested with
[1:29:53] God and said but Lord what have I done
[1:29:55] but wait a minute did you hear what he
[1:29:57] said I'll take the scare out of it
[1:30:00] the nervousness was still it'll come but
[1:30:04] it won't scare you no more I'm telling
[1:30:06] you I believe that's an example for you
[1:30:08] and I and a real encouragement because
[1:30:10] there are some things that we have to go
[1:30:13] through and labor through that we need
[1:30:15] the strength of almighty God
[1:30:22] let me tell you friends I believe in
[1:30:24] miracles he's still a miracle working
[1:30:26] God
[1:30:28] we could go through testimony after
[1:30:30] testimony but let me tell you something
[1:30:32] every day is not a miracle
[1:30:35] every moment's not a miracle if I go
[1:30:38] back and look over the times of even the
[1:30:40] testimonies that's come in at different
[1:30:42] times throughout this assembly and how
[1:30:44] things would be
[1:30:46] it's not every day it's not every every
[1:30:48] Thursday or every Sunday where there's a
[1:30:51] report of a miracle taking place
[1:30:53] right
[1:30:54] there's there's some where there's
[1:30:57] testimonies that come in that God moved
[1:31:00] on their behalf as far as in terms of
[1:31:02] they didn't have to go through maybe a
[1:31:04] certain medical procedure
[1:31:07] healing
[1:31:09] then there's others had to go through a
[1:31:11] medical procedure what is that healing
[1:31:14] save Holy Spirit Same Spirit of faith
[1:31:19] come on Friends
[1:31:21] God gives us strength
[1:31:23] to go through in this life
[1:31:28] I want you to think of this I'm coming
[1:31:30] down
[1:31:31] Nehemiah chapter 6 and verse 9. I don't
[1:31:35] have a lot to background in this but you
[1:31:37] get home tonight or sometime I I love is
[1:31:39] Ezra and Nehemiah I love that whole
[1:31:41] whole whole whole chapters and whole
[1:31:43] books
[1:31:45] but right here in Nehemiah chapter six
[1:31:47] Nehemiah is tasked with rebuilding the
[1:31:49] walls and there's been all kinds of
[1:31:51] oppositions against it
[1:31:54] there's been those in the land
[1:31:58] that have made fun of those walls
[1:32:01] when they started on them
[1:32:03] they might only been this High a fox can
[1:32:06] run through them what was that about
[1:32:08] what was that really about to see if it
[1:32:11] could distract them to get him entangled
[1:32:13] with that argument
[1:32:16] come on Friends
[1:32:17] then you had accusations same people
[1:32:20] to buy San berlet stirred up the same
[1:32:23] stuff again and they started saying oh
[1:32:26] there's you know making accusations
[1:32:28] against Nehemiah Nehemiah wants to be a
[1:32:30] king and Nehemiah wants to be a ruler
[1:32:32] and all of these walls but their purpose
[1:32:35] was was to weaken the people from
[1:32:39] building the walls the walls was a
[1:32:43] protection but the walls didn't go up
[1:32:45] overnight
[1:32:46] it was Stone by Stone
[1:32:51] by Stone
[1:32:53] and I want you to notice this
[1:32:57] I don't have time to labor on it but
[1:32:58] it's just for this point in verse 9
[1:33:02] they all made us afraid saying talking
[1:33:05] about the people of the land and those
[1:33:07] who were coming against the people their
[1:33:09] hands shall be weakened from the work
[1:33:11] that it be not done by what when you
[1:33:13] read this whole chapter it's accusations
[1:33:17] saying that Nehemiah has wanted to make
[1:33:20] himself something and Nehemiah never
[1:33:22] said that at all Nehemiah said what
[1:33:24] you're saying is lies none of it's true
[1:33:27] but he realizes it's Satan trying to get
[1:33:30] at the people
[1:33:32] and here's what he asked now therefore o
[1:33:35] God strengthen my hands
[1:33:39] you see there's sometimes where we've
[1:33:43] got to turn and the battle is you face
[1:33:45] that opposition head on and there's
[1:33:48] other times that the way that we battle
[1:33:51] through it is is recognizing Satan's
[1:33:54] objective is to get you out of your post
[1:33:57] to duty and away from what God intends
[1:34:01] for you to do
[1:34:02] come on friends and this is where
[1:34:05] Nehemiah said Lord strengthen my hands
[1:34:08] in other words let me tune out all that
[1:34:11] other nonsense and let me focus on what
[1:34:14] you have called me to do strengthen my
[1:34:17] hands
[1:34:18] Hey listen he's the same God that took
[1:34:20] down the walls of Jericho it had been
[1:34:22] nothing for him to put walls up
[1:34:24] but that ain't the way that God intended
[1:34:26] to do it they were going to have to
[1:34:28] heave some Stones move some Stones carry
[1:34:32] some Stones play some stones
[1:34:35] God strengthen our hands
[1:34:39] Nehemiah could have prayed Lord get rid
[1:34:42] of Tobias tracks and bullet Dead with
[1:34:45] lightning Lord remove them out of here
[1:34:48] Lord God send them to another place Lord
[1:34:51] For Your Glory
[1:34:55] nope that is how God works
[1:34:58] so when you find yourself in the middle
[1:35:00] of a situation that's
[1:35:02] uncomfortable say God strengthen my
[1:35:06] hands
[1:35:10] Paul went on to talk about how that
[1:35:13] there were many that came against him in
[1:35:15] second Timothy 4 17.
[1:35:19] verse 16 he said at first my answer no
[1:35:21] man stood with me but all men forsook me
[1:35:24] and I pray God that it may not be late
[1:35:26] to their charge notwithstanding
[1:35:29] the Lord stood with me
[1:35:32] and strengthened me
[1:35:34] what did he strengthen Paul to do
[1:35:37] keep running the race
[1:35:39] when Paul said
[1:35:41] I have run the course he received
[1:35:43] strength from God along the way
[1:35:47] I have kept the faith he receives
[1:35:49] strength from God along the way the Lord
[1:35:52] was the strength of his life and the
[1:35:54] saving strength of his anointed
[1:35:59] by me the preaching might be fully known
[1:36:01] that all the Gentiles might hear and I
[1:36:04] was delivered out of the mouth of the
[1:36:05] lion and the Lord shall deliver me from
[1:36:07] every evil work and will preserve me
[1:36:09] unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be
[1:36:12] glory forever and ever
[1:36:16] amen
[1:36:18] let me just end with this part of it
[1:36:22] skip some things
[1:36:25] have you ever heard the term the Blues
[1:36:28] the Blues
[1:36:29] I'm not talking about a saxophone
[1:36:31] I like saxophones I'm not talking about
[1:36:34] New Orleans
[1:36:36] I'm not talking about the music I'm
[1:36:38] talking about the blues were you get the
[1:36:40] feeling down or sad
[1:36:43] now
[1:36:44] I can give you if you those you have to
[1:36:46] Table app and things like that just look
[1:36:48] the word Blues up
[1:36:51] and when you find that Brother battle
[1:36:53] you'll find him making statements of
[1:36:55] when you begin to think about all that
[1:36:58] God has done all the blessings that are
[1:37:02] there for you
[1:37:04] baptism after baptism you are
[1:37:07] predestinated you cannot fail he said
[1:37:10] how could a man
[1:37:12] get the blues thinking about that
[1:37:18] I'm saying these things purposely in
[1:37:20] this way
[1:37:22] he said how could he get the blues
[1:37:24] thinking about that
[1:37:27] then brother Brown will talk about the
[1:37:29] enticing Spirit talking about people
[1:37:31] getting the blues now if you just read
[1:37:33] those first few quotes and that's all
[1:37:36] you had
[1:37:37] you'd be in a heap of trouble
[1:37:40] the devil probably want to be whipping
[1:37:42] you left to right because you'd think
[1:37:44] Lord have mercy I must be sinning by
[1:37:46] having the Blues
[1:37:50] but let's read a little further
[1:37:53] let's read a little further even
[1:37:56] as the Revelation as it continues to
[1:37:58] break but this is what brother Brown's
[1:38:00] talking about he don't just it's not
[1:38:02] discrediting what was said before
[1:38:04] but brother Ram goes into that same
[1:38:05] thing about one of the greatest hurts
[1:38:08] through that's hurt me through my life
[1:38:09] has been a nervous condition
[1:38:11] and he talks about how that you know he
[1:38:13] says I used to hear the my daddy and the
[1:38:16] rest of them talk about getting the
[1:38:18] blues and you don't know what that is
[1:38:22] there's certain things
[1:38:24] I don't know I've experienced the Blues
[1:38:28] seems like they like to make a regular
[1:38:30] stop at that old cul-de-sac
[1:38:33] right I mean they're as faithful as
[1:38:35] Valpak in the mail all them useless
[1:38:38] coupons
[1:38:42] but the Blues
[1:38:49] Blues 50 years old I've done nothing for
[1:38:50] the Lord
[1:38:52] he said some of you Brethren my age
[1:38:54] he said they used to call it having the
[1:38:56] blues pop used to talk about it and I
[1:38:58] wondered what he meant
[1:39:00] don't have to wonder no more
[1:39:04] and I sure know how what he meant then
[1:39:06] you get the feeling that way which is
[1:39:09] none of it true if there's nothing else
[1:39:11] in that quote you heard me that right
[1:39:13] there none of it's true
[1:39:19] Satan has a way of trying to present
[1:39:22] things to be the truth and it ain't
[1:39:25] it's just you you know it you know it
[1:39:29] it's just you doing that well how is it
[1:39:32] me doing that because you're
[1:39:33] entertaining that
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:38] entertaining that thought
[1:39:40] now let's look what the prophet said
[1:39:42] works as Faith Express I love this
[1:39:45] brother Rams says against all hope he's
[1:39:47] quoting out a Romans 4. all hope was
[1:39:49] gone oh every time
[1:39:52] I go to feeling a little
[1:39:55] what's that say
[1:39:57] blue oh no not brother Branham
[1:40:02] every time I get to feeling blue oh
[1:40:05] probably only happened once in his life
[1:40:07] this is 1965.
[1:40:10] when brother Brown preaches perfect
[1:40:12] faith in 1963 it's an evening message
[1:40:16] and brother Brown comes to the platform
[1:40:18] and he starts the message perfect faith
[1:40:21] and he says you think I don't get gloomy
[1:40:24] times
[1:40:26] see our imagination is brother Brandon
[1:40:29] was eating donuts with the angels and he
[1:40:30] was just walking and he never had any
[1:40:32] battles let me tell you something
[1:40:33] friends that was a man who lived closer
[1:40:35] to God than probably most of us will
[1:40:37] ever be able to attain to as the
[1:40:39] messenger of the age that's that's not
[1:40:40] putting us or locking us out of anything
[1:40:42] but what I'm saying is is that he still
[1:40:45] was a man he still had battles and you
[1:40:48] know what I'm grateful for the Insight
[1:40:51] that we can look into this and see this
[1:40:55] I get gloomy sometimes Satan comes and
[1:40:58] tells me nobody cares about you you
[1:41:01] ain't got a friend in the world but this
[1:41:03] is what's important brother Branham
[1:41:05] didn't get on Facebook and let everybody
[1:41:07] know this is how I feel today
[1:41:10] foreign
[1:41:19] this is what he said he said but then I
[1:41:22] look back and I see those from Georgia
[1:41:25] that have stayed over for the evening
[1:41:28] service and he said I look right back
[1:41:30] and say what about that devil
[1:41:33] they didn't have to be here but they
[1:41:35] want to be here he said I put it right
[1:41:38] back in his face that's what you need to
[1:41:40] be doing you need to be putting back
[1:41:43] those things right in the devil's face I
[1:41:46] am loved I am appreciated put it right
[1:41:49] back in his face
[1:41:52] um
[1:41:53] every time I go to feeling a little bit
[1:41:55] blue I read that chat let's read that
[1:41:57] can we Romans 4 we'll close on this
[1:42:01] who against hope
[1:42:03] believed in Hope
[1:42:05] Mama that he might become the father of
[1:42:09] many nations according to that which was
[1:42:11] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[1:42:14] not weak in faith in body he was weak
[1:42:21] but he wasn't weak in faith
[1:42:23] he considered how do you know it wasn't
[1:42:25] weak in faith because he considered not
[1:42:27] his own body now dead
[1:42:29] brother Brandon picks it up this way and
[1:42:31] he says God was speaking to Abraham I
[1:42:34] have let your body get in this condition
[1:42:37] to see how you're going to react now
[1:42:40] how will you react to me who's made the
[1:42:44] promise
[1:42:45] that you shall have
[1:42:47] a seed a child be an heir how will you
[1:42:51] react to it but notice he consider not
[1:42:54] in other words this was not Abraham's
[1:42:57] talking points
[1:43:01] my Aiken my breaking now this one my
[1:43:06] Latin
[1:43:07] you know what all those things right
[1:43:08] there I know we talk about our hurts we
[1:43:10] talk about her this and that but I think
[1:43:12] we can bring it on down you understand
[1:43:13] what's being said here tonight there's
[1:43:15] sometimes we can talk about things but
[1:43:17] listen Abraham himself was not focused
[1:43:21] he did not make it part of the focus you
[1:43:24] know how it is you can get around
[1:43:25] somebody and maybe you go in their house
[1:43:27] or whatever more and you know what the
[1:43:29] main theme is you know what the main
[1:43:31] picture is all conversations lead right
[1:43:34] to that very thing
[1:43:39] but let me tell you something Abraham's
[1:43:42] body got weaker
[1:43:44] it grew more impossible all the time but
[1:43:48] his faith didn't get weaker
[1:43:50] well how is it possible that his body
[1:43:52] got weaker and his faith didn't get
[1:43:54] weaker ah he was receiving strength
[1:44:00] not strength as far as the natural body
[1:44:03] What If Abraham would have been looking
[1:44:05] at it that Lord my body I've gotten more
[1:44:07] of a hunch in my back now than I had
[1:44:10] last month
[1:44:11] I've had to walk on this cane more more
[1:44:14] times out of the month than I did last
[1:44:17] month but you see he was not looking at
[1:44:20] that he didn't receive strength in his
[1:44:22] Natural Body he received strength in his
[1:44:24] space to persevere
[1:44:27] through it
[1:44:30] let's stand
[1:44:34] and when he was about 100 years old
[1:44:35] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:44:37] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:44:39] through unbelief
[1:44:40] but was strong in faith
[1:44:44] giving glory to God
[1:44:48] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:44:50] had promised he was also able to perform
[1:44:55] and it was imputed to him for
[1:44:57] righteousness
[1:45:00] I say it like this brother Brandon says
[1:45:02] that's the only way a Believer can get
[1:45:03] his strength
[1:45:05] is pull it from the word of God
[1:45:07] that's his strength it's God's promises
[1:45:10] to him stand by it and believe it
[1:45:14] now friends I believe that we can
[1:45:16] receive strength and comfort of the Lord
[1:45:18] from one another I believe that I'm a
[1:45:22] witness of that many scriptures we could
[1:45:23] place on that job himself said that if
[1:45:26] people were in grief from the times past
[1:45:28] he said with my lips I would assuage or
[1:45:32] remove or push away the grief that
[1:45:35] you're in
[1:45:36] with my lips
[1:45:38] I would I would impart I would speak
[1:45:41] strength to you
[1:45:43] job was one who took notice
[1:45:46] of the body that he was with and he
[1:45:47] would notice those things and job would
[1:45:50] go to minister to it but here in the
[1:45:53] midst of these times like this there is
[1:45:55] times that went within it all let me
[1:45:57] friends let me just say it like this we
[1:45:59] can get to such a place we as humans we
[1:46:02] are we can become creatures of habit
[1:46:04] like that
[1:46:05] it'd be just like if if every single
[1:46:08] time you went to this certain oh I've
[1:46:10] got a real need I need to go talk to
[1:46:12] Sister so-and-so or brother so and so I
[1:46:14] need to go this
[1:46:15] well why not talk to God
[1:46:18] don't want your faith dependent on
[1:46:20] brother so and so or sister so and so
[1:46:21] God don't want your faith depending on
[1:46:23] to where Victory and the walk in your
[1:46:25] life depends on me
[1:46:27] I'm here to be of a help to encourage
[1:46:29] you but listen that encouragement will
[1:46:32] never you you know me by now that
[1:46:34] encouragement will never point you to me
[1:46:36] It'll point you to who you are as a son
[1:46:39] and daughter of God you've got just as
[1:46:40] much access as I have
[1:46:42] there might be something that you're not
[1:46:45] seeing and not not recognizing and if
[1:46:47] God don't really reveal it to me none of
[1:46:49] us would know but you see there you have
[1:46:51] access to God just like I do and within
[1:46:55] this there are times we can receive
[1:46:57] strength from others
[1:46:59] and there's times
[1:47:01] our strength is going to come from the
[1:47:04] Lord alone
[1:47:09] and why what are we going to do while
[1:47:11] we're waiting Abraham what are you going
[1:47:13] to do while you wait
[1:47:15] brother Graham talks about this while
[1:47:17] you're resting while you're waiting what
[1:47:18] are you going to do
[1:47:22] but see God revealed himself as thou
[1:47:24] shadow
[1:47:26] the breasted God
[1:47:30] one in whom we can draw strength from
[1:47:35] brother Brian said you know that baby
[1:47:37] drawing strength
[1:47:40] don't all of a sudden look around and
[1:47:41] say wow
[1:47:42] did I grow an inch
[1:47:44] he said the baby don't even care about
[1:47:46] that
[1:47:47] it's just drawing strength
[1:47:50] and that strength that it's drawing man
[1:47:53] it'll satisfy it it'll calm it down
[1:47:57] it's like when our kids were little and
[1:48:00] man said they'd cry in the middle of
[1:48:01] night
[1:48:03] you know what you got to do
[1:48:05] take care of it to get him well you're
[1:48:06] going to get them satisfied you're not
[1:48:07] going to be able to set him up and say
[1:48:09] hey let me tell you why you shouldn't be
[1:48:11] crying right now Daddy's got to go to
[1:48:13] work in the morning I got a long day
[1:48:16] tomorrow
[1:48:18] you're wasting your time
[1:48:21] right
[1:48:22] Mama didn't get up and say let me tell
[1:48:24] you something
[1:48:25] you know what kind of David I've had
[1:48:28] you think I feel like getting up at 2 30
[1:48:30] in the morning
[1:48:33] what's needed he just needs some
[1:48:36] nourishment some strength
[1:48:38] right
[1:48:39] and when that when that strength is
[1:48:41] received it satisfies
[1:48:44] now I hope you hear me how brother
[1:48:45] Brandon brought it he says why I'm
[1:48:47] waiting and while I'm resting I'm gonna
[1:48:50] draw on God for the promises
[1:48:55] he said if I'm waiting on God for the
[1:48:57] Holy Ghost I am going to draw from his
[1:49:00] promises I am going to just set my
[1:49:03] sights in his word if I'm looking for
[1:49:06] healing in my body he said I'm going to
[1:49:08] draw from his promises
[1:49:11] I know that's very simple
[1:49:16] but remember
[1:49:18] God is your joy
[1:49:20] God is your strength
[1:49:22] knowing the message
[1:49:24] he's our sufficiency
[1:49:26] it's drawing our strength from him
[1:49:31] it's looking to him and drawing strength
[1:49:35] from him
[1:49:36] not whether I feel any different that
[1:49:39] don't have nothing to do with it
[1:49:42] feelings will come
[1:49:44] are you hearing me when everything God
[1:49:47] God answers the prayer it comes into
[1:49:50] full manifestation but until that time
[1:49:55] brother Brown says until that time
[1:49:58] he said man shall not live but run alone
[1:50:00] but by out of the bosom of God shall he
[1:50:03] nurse his strength every word that comes
[1:50:06] out of the mouth of God shall he receive
[1:50:08] his strength as it comes
[1:50:10] from the mouth of God the word
[1:50:14] I know
[1:50:16] some Services sometimes
[1:50:20] and this is something I had to learn
[1:50:21] early on even as a pastor
[1:50:24] that some services
[1:50:26] every service is different
[1:50:29] because you know in order to have a crop
[1:50:31] so seed
[1:50:35] and there's things that has to be sold
[1:50:37] and put in place and there's things that
[1:50:40] has to be ministered and spoken and has
[1:50:42] to be moved upon in our life for us to
[1:50:45] even at this time I'll tell you wouldn't
[1:50:47] it be glorious that every time we come
[1:50:48] together every need that we have boom
[1:50:51] every need is met right there Miracle
[1:50:53] power
[1:50:55] wouldn't that be awesome
[1:50:57] I mean I'd like it I'd like it for
[1:50:58] different things that we're praying
[1:51:00] about now I would love that that's I
[1:51:02] would like that but who what part of me
[1:51:03] would like it there's a part on the
[1:51:05] inside that I'd love to see God
[1:51:06] glorified but I think there's a part of
[1:51:08] it with me that would say I won't have
[1:51:10] to labor his heart
[1:51:16] I'll just save for the rest Lord
[1:51:19] because when something lingers
[1:51:22] you pray more
[1:51:24] and you pray more
[1:51:26] and how do you know that a service like
[1:51:28] this tonight or the next service friends
[1:51:30] don't discount any service
[1:51:33] because every service is receiving from
[1:51:36] El shadiah
[1:51:39] it's receiving strength from him through
[1:51:42] it
[1:51:45] are you with me
[1:51:47] God knows what he's doing God knows how
[1:51:49] to bring the expectations and we look
[1:51:51] for deliverances and everything else God
[1:51:53] knows how to set all that in place man
[1:51:55] can do that if man works it up it fails
[1:52:01] because when God brings it to that place
[1:52:03] your faith has been built not only for
[1:52:06] it to happen but to sustain it
[1:52:13] but in the middle of that the Bible said
[1:52:16] he gave glory to God
[1:52:21] 25 years
[1:52:23] you think Abraham wasn't discouraged at
[1:52:25] times Hey listen he wasn't just looking
[1:52:27] at his body getting discouraged
[1:52:29] that guy had mistakes that he could have
[1:52:31] put right in his face
[1:52:35] on and on misunderstandings
[1:52:38] brother Brown said he focused out all
[1:52:41] the misunderstandings
[1:52:43] listen there was one little
[1:52:45] misunderstanding I ran around the camp
[1:52:46] by the name of Ishmael
[1:52:49] yeah are you with me it was there as a
[1:52:51] constant reminder I am your
[1:52:53] misunderstanding
[1:52:55] I am you submitting to your wife
[1:52:58] hello
[1:53:00] he had that he had those reminders but
[1:53:03] it chose to focus on The God Who made
[1:53:06] the promise
[1:53:07] and worship
[1:53:09] and give glory to God
[1:53:11] and say thank you Lord
[1:53:13] for another dose of strength
[1:53:16] thank you for strength Lord strength
[1:53:18] that sometimes comes our way that just
[1:53:21] keeps us looking in the right direction
[1:53:24] I'll tell you there's times we need that
[1:53:26] just strength to keep looking in the
[1:53:29] right direction to the right resource
[1:53:32] I say God help us
[1:53:34] help us the Lord
[1:53:36] let's pray
[1:53:40] how many here tonight maybe man uplift
[1:53:42] that hand say Lord
[1:53:44] I just want to receive strength Lord
[1:53:49] Hallelujah
[1:53:52] whatever and whatever Channel whatever
[1:53:54] way whatever means Lord and how that it
[1:53:56] comes
[1:53:58] father
[1:54:00] you see Lord God our hands Lord you see
[1:54:03] our hearts Lord
[1:54:05] dear God we we identify
[1:54:08] together and identify with a word
[1:54:11] to know that Lord there are times
[1:54:15] where you
[1:54:16] take us through Rivers take us through
[1:54:19] floods
[1:54:20] take us through the fire
[1:54:22] but you're right there with us Lord
[1:54:26] you strengthen us
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:30] there's times Lord where the strength
[1:54:32] comes that my discompletely Lord removes
[1:54:36] whatever it is
[1:54:39] Lord in our life that we're
[1:54:42] troubled with
[1:54:47] I thank Lord of how the prophet you like
[1:54:49] you told like he said
[1:54:51] with that nervousness and that tension
[1:54:54] as his own words in uniting time and
[1:54:56] sign
[1:54:58] you could just have easily have said
[1:55:01] there'll be no more nervous
[1:55:03] no more nervousness that you'll deal
[1:55:05] with
[1:55:07] but instead
[1:55:08] you said
[1:55:10] it won't scare you no more
[1:55:15] now Lord I can't determine that for me
[1:55:17] or for anybody else
[1:55:20] but Lord what I take from there is Lord
[1:55:23] Jesus
[1:55:24] you give us strength
[1:55:27] if that's Lord like as you told your
[1:55:29] Prophet just like you told Paul
[1:55:32] then you don't need me or nobody else to
[1:55:34] go around and say oh this is what is
[1:55:36] this is
[1:55:38] this is what it is with me
[1:55:41] no
[1:55:42] but Lord if it is something that's like
[1:55:45] that where Paul talked about that eye
[1:55:48] that physical condition that would come
[1:55:49] or go
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:51] then Lord Jesus I believe you'll tell us
[1:55:57] what I think Lord God many times I've
[1:55:59] stood Lord with many of my brothers
[1:56:02] even in my own self Lord have stood and
[1:56:05] I have prayed with different ones Lord
[1:56:09] with different problems and issues back
[1:56:11] troubles and things like that and watch
[1:56:13] the Lord how that you would come and
[1:56:16] move for those different needs and those
[1:56:18] people
[1:56:19] and then in myself Lord when I would get
[1:56:21] back to the office
[1:56:23] or not just here but sometimes Lord and
[1:56:26] else places brothers would gather around
[1:56:28] and Lord have prayer over me
[1:56:31] sometimes those are things Lord that we
[1:56:33] just can't explain
[1:56:36] but I know this one thing Lord
[1:56:38] you give us the strength that we have
[1:56:42] need of
[1:56:43] not one time were you instructing us or
[1:56:46] telling us to be acceptive of anything
[1:56:49] that's not what Paul was Paul never
[1:56:52] accepted it Paul never started out a
[1:56:55] circle of eyes getting a vision coming
[1:56:58] and going he never started out a talking
[1:56:59] circle on it
[1:57:01] or a group thread
[1:57:04] no but Paul said when this comes along I
[1:57:07] realize it's not that there's anything
[1:57:11] that God's trying
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:15] something that's wrong with me
[1:57:18] but I've learned within the midst of
[1:57:20] this time that I am more dependent upon
[1:57:24] him
[1:57:25] for he has spoke to me and said my grace
[1:57:28] is sufficient my strength is perfect in
[1:57:31] your weakness
[1:57:33] Lord may we like Paul be able to stand
[1:57:35] and say then
[1:57:37] when I'm weak
[1:57:39] then I
[1:57:41] am strong
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] Granite Lord
[1:57:46] that inner man that is renewed with
[1:57:48] strength day by day while this outer man
[1:57:50] perishes gets weaker
[1:57:53] like Abraham
[1:57:55] oh God help us to receive the strength
[1:57:57] that comes our way
[1:57:59] forgive us Lord when we've prayed and
[1:58:02] wanted certain outcomes in certain ways
[1:58:04] Lord you understand you know
[1:58:08] we are but dust
[1:58:10] the humanity Lord God about us
[1:58:14] we don't want Lord God those ways
[1:58:17] we don't want to go in those Pathways I
[1:58:20] I don't Lord
[1:58:21] I'm sure that many of my brothers and
[1:58:23] sisters Lord we would all raise our
[1:58:24] hands on that part of it but God you
[1:58:27] know the path that we take
[1:58:31] Lord God I just asked for strength
[1:58:34] as your Prophet Lord would stand there
[1:58:36] in the message three kinds of believers
[1:58:39] and he would ask you Lord
[1:58:42] don't take the trials From Me Lord
[1:58:45] but give me your grace to go through
[1:58:48] them
[1:58:49] give me the grace to go through them
[1:58:51] Lord Lord that's what we're asking for
[1:58:56] Grace right here tonight maybe some
[1:58:58] standing here tonight Lord in need of
[1:59:00] fresh a refreshing
[1:59:03] a strengthening maybe like Nehemiah
[1:59:06] could ask strength in my hands Lord
[1:59:09] strengthen my hands to continue
[1:59:11] to stay focused on what you've called me
[1:59:14] to do Lord
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:17] Lord
[1:59:18] as job said you've not used your power
[1:59:22] to contend against us but you will
[1:59:25] you put strength in US
[1:59:28] how we thank you Father for your
[1:59:30] strength
[1:59:31] bless your children tonight Lord
[1:59:34] may we continue Lord to receive
[1:59:37] strength
[1:59:38] day after day like Abraham moment after
[1:59:40] moment
[1:59:42] one of these days one of these moments
[1:59:44] Lord
[1:59:46] what has been promised
[1:59:48] that we have held in our heart and
[1:59:50] watered and watered and watered it will
[1:59:53] come
[1:59:54] to pass
[1:59:58] thank you Father
[2:00:00] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:00:03] amen
[2:00:06] oh his strength is
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:14] gone
[2:00:16] [Music]
[2:00:20] if you
[2:00:22] carry us
[2:00:24] when we can't
[2:00:27] carry on
[2:00:29] oh
[2:00:33] raising in his power
[2:00:38] the weak
[2:00:40] become strong
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:47] is perfect
[2:00:52] history
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:56] yes Lord
[2:01:01] I can do all things yes Lord
[2:01:06] through Christ who gives me strength
[2:01:12] but sometimes I wonder what he yes Lord
[2:01:17] can do through me
[2:01:26] success
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:50] Birds
[2:01:52] perfect
[2:01:55] strangers
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:59] oh he'll carry us
[2:02:04] when we can't
