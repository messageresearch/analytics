[37:11] mission report today on the January
[37:13] mission offerings we would want to say

[37:17] dollars and we have been in contact with
[37:22] brother Tim Dodd from Cloverdale Bible a
[37:27] he's taking care of a lot of the things
[37:29] within Uganda as far as a lot of needs
[37:32] and the things I've mentioned to you
[37:34] from time to time brother Stephen a Bali
[37:37] who was here there is such a great need
[37:41] in that country right now for Bibles
[37:44] they just don't have Bibles and even
[37:47] clothing just it's a very very dire
[37:51] situation even with food and so forth
[37:53] but brother and Stephen in Bali I text
[37:56] brother Stephen we stay in contact and
[37:58] so he'll be following up with this and
[38:01] then I'll be able to share with you the
[38:04] things that will take place there the
[38:05] Lord willing so I wanted to say god
[38:07] bless you I want to just show you real
[38:10] quick we we raised in the mid well and
[38:14] the mission offering we took up an
[38:17] offering toward two boats and actually
[38:21] ended up being one and then another need
[38:22] was presented and I want to just show
[38:24] you where that where that's coming from
[38:26] we have here a boy that's terrible
[38:30] sorry I don't need to put my opinion up
[38:33] there but right here let me just mark
[38:37] this out
[38:37] - Liam island is
[38:41] is right over it's right over here this
[38:44] looks like a piece of land it's not it's
[38:45] a lake it's the lake inside and it's
[38:48] surrounded by the land and it's right
[38:50] out of Manila and you see it right here
[38:52] a little bit more clear it looks like a
[38:54] sword that Island and we came out of
[38:57] here this is where I ministered at in
[39:00] bras and I came out to the island here
[39:02] brother Jian had met me and we went
[39:04] there and that was with brother VIN and
[39:06] but the VIN does a lot of the mission
[39:08] work there along around the island and
[39:11] it's just simply he just was walking
[39:13] just walking and just going so then we
[39:18] were able to secure a boat and so this
[39:21] was his response to me and brother VIN
[39:25] it's really kind of cute because with
[39:27] the email part I don't think he
[39:28] understands it he writes me inside of
[39:31] the what it's all about line so I have
[39:33] to open up they're all about line and
[39:35] really expand it and get this but I
[39:36] wanted to share this with you
[39:37] how are you brother Samuel thank you for
[39:39] everything to support to buy this boat
[39:41] and now weekly we use for mission
[39:44] purposes god bless you all and you'll
[39:46] see brother VIN right here and brother
[39:48] Vince may be about this tall and there
[39:52] is his family and some of the other
[39:53] brothers going with him you see him once
[39:55] again and here's the boat that they were
[40:00] able to secure and they redid it and
[40:03] you'll see here in a moment
[40:06] it can't no I don't know if you can see
[40:08] that or not but you know what it says on
[40:09] the side right of Christ so they're able
[40:15] to use that that vessel and they've done
[40:17] a lot of a lot of work on that so the
[40:20] the other boat that we were able to help
[40:24] with and this is in allowing the Palau
[40:27] and islands in Philippines and this is
[40:30] located right right here and it's just
[40:33] when you zoom in on it's just the
[40:35] multitude of islands and just to try to
[40:38] get around there and brother oh L Roden
[40:41] says trust all is well with you as you
[40:44] read this thank you for helping the work
[40:46] in Palau an island the ministers of Thai
[40:48] Thai town and Pali on plowin are now
[40:51] raring to set sail and start
[40:53] evangelizing the near
[40:55] Islands in northern plowin area there
[40:58] are 30 some small islands in this region
[41:02] that we wish to reach with the message
[41:04] and now the Lord has gifted us with a
[41:06] vehicle to be able to do that palawan is
[41:09] also one of the richest fishing areas of
[41:11] the country and the boat will be a
[41:13] tremendous blessing to the believers of
[41:15] the four main churches that work
[41:17] together in this place and right here
[41:19] you can see this boat now this the
[41:21] difference with this as I believe with
[41:24] this boat they built this the brothers
[41:27] that were here were able then to take it
[41:28] in which it kind of kept costs down
[41:30] there and so they were able to to build
[41:33] that boat so they wanted to express
[41:36] their thinks in in helping with that
[41:40] right now there's just a need I received
[41:43] this from brother
[41:43] Roel there is a need in in tight I for
[41:47] the church building repair and brother
[41:50] Rowell wrote this and he says I also
[41:53] wanted to share with you the need to
[41:54] replace the wall of our church meaning
[41:56] the church that's there in in tight I'm
[41:58] not not brother oels but the church
[42:00] there in plowin we needed we helped
[42:04] build this church in 2010 and the wooden
[42:06] structure has been eaten by termites and
[42:08] the bamboo mesh walls are falling apart
[42:11] they are needing $600 to rehabilitate
[42:14] the building and hope you can help us
[42:16] again and here's a look at the building
[42:18] and brother oels church and then by
[42:21] God's grace they were able to help them
[42:23] to build that and so brother o is just
[42:28] he sent pictures of the building and so
[42:30] forth tell you what it kind of makes us
[42:33] ashamed of ourselves if we complain
[42:34] about what God's given us and so this is
[42:41] that's just the that's the end of it
[42:44] there's so we just want to lift you know
[42:48] towards that need if there's things that
[42:49] you were unprepared today or what have
[42:51] you that's it's fine you can still you
[42:54] know if something you pray about it and
[42:56] the Lord puts it on your heart and you
[42:57] want to give something next week as well
[43:00] that's fine we can get that going there
[43:03] too a brother or well and they'll and
[43:05] the brothers will get that there was
[43:06] another need that came up and I did put
[43:08] pictures on it and what it is it's it's
[43:11] one of the brothers that brother Dre and
[43:12] I will redid the first set of meetings
[43:15] when the when the property was surveyed
[43:19] it wasn't done properly so then the
[43:23] brother
[43:24] they already built the church building
[43:26] okay brother I think brother Chad lamb
[43:29] and those down at believers Christian
[43:30] Fellowship help them help brother lanlan
[43:32] build that building well now it comes
[43:36] out that some of the building is on a
[43:39] lot they don't whole so I'm asking you
[43:44] that you would just pray as well because
[43:46] you know it's just the enemy coming
[43:48] against also and I understand we want to
[43:51] be good business and good stewards and
[43:53] and some of you know you know you go
[43:55] into some of those other places you know
[43:56] brother keener like you think over in
[43:57] Taiwan and sometimes it's just not
[43:59] always the things are not done quite as
[44:04] sometimes efficiently and everything you
[44:06] know and so the brothers are very very
[44:09] good with things but it's just this
[44:11] situation happened and so it's they're
[44:13] kind of right now the ladies really the
[44:18] ladies really pushing them you know with
[44:22] for money and it's not money as far as
[44:24] bribery it's just with the money to
[44:27] trying to get the land and trying to
[44:29] secure that part so I haven't heard any
[44:31] more back from brother Rowell and I
[44:33] haven't emailed him anymore because he's
[44:36] asking us to come so I didn't want to
[44:39] respond to that email but brother Giri
[44:41] you know was there really looking for
[44:44] that right there to go and so we're just
[44:45] you keep that in prayer as well and in
[44:47] October they're asking us about that and
[44:50] I guess I'm kind of the the the person
[44:52] that I look at and say you know if you
[44:55] can't go send somebody I'll take the
[44:57] latter part I know he said but the same
[45:01] year week well you know I I just and I
[45:06] really mean that with all my heart I
[45:07] would stand behind anybody than any of
[45:09] the brothers is they feel led to go
[45:12] but I do love that love the people there
[45:14] I know we love them and and they wanted
[45:16] to extend that greeting to you so this
[45:19] morning we just want to lift the the
[45:22] mission offering this morning and just
[45:25] trust that the Lord will just richly
[45:27] bless you and like I said if there's
[45:28] something that I know we wasn't prepared
[45:30] for that but we have even through next
[45:35] week so if we could let's just bow our
[45:37] heads as the brothers would come for the
[45:41] lift of mission offering

[50:58] sister Patsy good to have you back
[51:00] amen our sisters really just been
[51:02] battling the sickness throughout the
[51:04] time and I know different ones and you
[51:07] know I thought about brother and sister
[51:08] keener they were back with us last week
[51:10] too and they came came back they weren't
[51:13] battling sickness but they know there
[51:14] was things they had to take care of
[51:16] clear over next to the Philippines and
[51:17] Taiwan and we're glad to have brother
[51:20] Claudio back with us too each and every
[51:26] one and you Drake Rebecca's good to see
[51:28] you here amen it's good to see each and
[51:30] every one in the house of God and we've
[51:32] got some that are missing this morning
[51:34] but we just hold them up in prayer
[51:36] someone some had some different
[51:37] commitments and so forth but we just
[51:40] want to turn our hearts and open to the
[51:42] word of the Lord remember next Sunday a
[51:44] fellowship dinner not this Sunday next
[51:49] Sunday this Sunday we'll have to find
[51:52] something else to eat but a fellowship
[51:55] dinner next next week so I just think
[52:00] God that we have a place that we can
[52:01] gather I really think God for that and
[52:04] have fellowship let's look in the word
[52:06] of the Lord here this morning in 2nd
[52:09] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 and we'll
[52:13] just read a few verses here Paul says
[52:17] blessed be God even the father of our
[52:20] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[52:23] and the God of all comfort who comforted
[52:28] us in all our tribulation I want you to
[52:33] look at this verse here let's just kind
[52:36] of you know kind of move it around in
[52:39] our mouth a little bit and just chew on
[52:40] a little bit who comforted us in all our
[52:45] tribulation so God didn't remove them
[52:48] from it but he gave them come
[52:51] in the midst of the tribulation now
[52:55] here's the reason that we may be able to
[52:59] comfort them which are in any trouble by
[53:06] the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
[53:10] comforted of God
[53:12] so Paul saying it's not our comfort
[53:15] that's being expressed it's the comfort
[53:17] that we've been comforted of the God of
[53:21] all comfort and then by that comfort
[53:23] we're able to comfort you wow it sounds
[53:28] like a body
[53:31] sounds like a body for as the sufferings
[53:34] of Christ abound in us so our
[53:36] consolation that's comfort that's
[53:38] encouragement so our consolation also
[53:41] aboundeth by Christ and whether we be
[53:45] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[53:47] salvation which is effectual in the
[53:50] enduring of the same sufferings which
[53:55] which also we suffer for whether we be
[53:58] comforted it is for your consolation and
[54:01] salvation and our hope of you is
[54:05] steadfast knowing that as ye are
[54:08] partakers of the suffering soul shall
[54:10] you be also of the consolation may God
[54:13] bless you bless the reading of his word
[54:15] as you're being seated I wanna I'd like
[54:18] to speak to you this morning if the Lord
[54:19] would just help us hear the God of all
[54:23] comfort the God of all comfort and
[54:29] brother branham made this statement here
[54:32] and to think of this he says I'm so glad
[54:37] to know that he speaking of the Lord
[54:40] Jesus can be found amongst the
[54:44] brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not
[54:48] one that would leave us he stands bias
[54:51] when all has failed and the last hopes
[54:55] of earthly reaching has come to its end
[54:57] he is still God and He loves us he was
[55:01] he was the expressing of God
[55:04] and all how I believed that he Long's
[55:07] and once you just let's just look at
[55:08] this here just very slowly oh how I
[55:12] believe that he longs for his people to
[55:17] be so anointed with his spirit now watch
[55:21] the ice place needs to be so anointed
[55:23] with his spirit that we could go to each
[55:27] other in trials and in troubles and give
[55:32] the expression of his sympathy as it
[55:37] pours from our hearts that's been born
[55:40] of his spirit to reflect in the church
[55:45] the love of the Living God he said all
[55:49] that well expressed what he said or the
[55:50] poet said living he loved me I want you
[55:53] to catch this this as he makes this the
[55:56] statement here that we would be so
[55:59] anointed with his spirit there's a lot
[56:01] of things that we can be anointed to do
[56:05] but the Prophet brings us to this into
[56:08] this place that he says oh how God is
[56:11] longing that we would be so anointed
[56:14] that we could go to each other you see
[56:19] it's one thing I can know maybe seems
[56:21] like maybe brother joy is going through
[56:23] something or another brother and under
[56:24] the sister it's one thing for me to know
[56:26] it but you see what brother bream says
[56:27] that we would be so anointed with the
[56:30] Spirit of God that we could go to each
[56:33] other in trials and in troubles and we
[56:38] could give the expression of his
[56:40] sympathy well why don't God give it he
[56:42] is he's using you
[56:46] he's using you remember on the road to
[56:50] Damascus when Paul was taken off of the
[56:54] horse off of you know he says who are
[56:58] you Lord who are you he says I am Jesus
[57:01] whom thou persecutors you see the
[57:04] offering up of the body now the life
[57:07] coming back down into the very mystical
[57:11] body of Jesus Christ the attributes of
[57:13] God gathered together that which was a
[57:16] part of him his bride
[57:18] and now here Christ is being expressed
[57:20] through his bride and a reflection of
[57:23] that expression is that life itself what
[57:26] it did in the bridegroom this is also
[57:30] part of hitting on 16 cylinders it will
[57:33] also and must do the same thing in the
[57:37] bride he says it gives the expression
[57:40] that it would give the expression of his
[57:43] sympathy as it pours from a heart now
[57:47] you know I know it might be simple but
[57:49] these words mean something not as it
[57:51] trickles but as it pours
[57:53] so God let me be so filled up that it's
[57:59] able to pour you see you and I are
[58:03] priests believer priests we have a
[58:06] responsibility and that responsibility
[58:08] our walk with God as you would say that
[58:12] we were praying in the Holy Ghost
[58:14] building up your most holy faith and
[58:16] it's it is bringing it's just creating
[58:19] that reservoir because within our lives
[58:21] remember virtue goes out of the
[58:24] believers live and as we would go to one
[58:26] another and it don't necessarily mean
[58:29] just somebody everyone in the church but
[58:31] sometimes it's right in our home
[58:34] sometimes it's it's right there
[58:37] sometimes you pass it in in the
[58:39] workplace and you might come across a
[58:41] family member it might be someone who's
[58:44] not even walking in the same light that
[58:46] we're walking in that don't make a
[58:48] difference
[58:48] we still have sympathy now we'll get to
[58:53] that in a little bit but notice it pours
[58:55] from my heart that's really don't have
[58:57] to be primed a channel to express your
[59:08] sympathy notice remember what the Lord
[59:10] Jesus and you find this all the way
[59:12] through the Lord Jesus the ministry here
[59:15] and then it continues on through there
[59:17] of the Apostles a new commandment I give
[59:19] unto you that you love one another as I
[59:22] have loved you that ye also love one
[59:25] another and by this shall all men know
[59:29] that you are my disciples if you have
[59:32] love one to another we believe in signs
[59:37] and miracles and they follow them that
[59:40] belief but I want you to think of this
[59:42] with all the signs and wonders that
[59:45] could follow a life if there's no love
[59:50] behind that and an expression then where
[59:54] where are the person or people's where
[59:56] are they being drawn to are you isn't me
[1:00:01] you remember signs and wonders you know
[1:00:03] bro Graham takes us there and we look
[1:00:05] you you read in the resume of the church
[1:00:07] ages and brother Branham just brings
[1:00:09] back you know in a very wide angle and
[1:00:11] he deals with the motive behind he said
[1:00:15] all those these ministries he said all
[1:00:17] kinds of results they're getting he said
[1:00:19] but what is the motivation behind what
[1:00:22] they're doing it's for self so it brings
[1:00:26] it back although all this is taking
[1:00:28] place but yet everything that's being
[1:00:29] done is herself so this is something
[1:00:32] that you know it's one thing for me to
[1:00:34] have a love for you and you to have a
[1:00:36] love for me but you see even though I
[1:00:38] have that in my heart and you have that
[1:00:40] in your heart how does one another how
[1:00:43] do we know that and even how does the
[1:00:46] world know that there's got to be such
[1:00:48] an expression like the Prophet spoke up
[1:00:51] in the message humble thyself when they
[1:00:54] came down there and when the church was
[1:00:57] starting there in Jeffersonville and
[1:00:58] they asked for the RAM how do you keep a
[1:01:01] people together so in love with one
[1:01:04] another and and things like that it
[1:01:06] wasn't that they didn't have troubles it
[1:01:08] wasn't that they didn't have times a
[1:01:10] disagreement but you see what was
[1:01:12] prevailing was is the love of God and
[1:01:15] that's what was it was a mystery to the
[1:01:18] people how do you do this and brother
[1:01:20] brems says it's not me he said the
[1:01:22] gospel is being preached but you see in
[1:01:24] that the gospel is being preached
[1:01:26] remember there's also the love of God
[1:01:29] that's coming forth the Holy Spirit it's
[1:01:31] moving in the hearts of the people
[1:01:35] oh my I think of how you know where the
[1:01:41] scripture says in Philippians chapter 2
[1:01:43] verse 1 he says if there be therefore
[1:01:46] any consolation in Christ if any comfort
[1:01:50] of love if any fellowship of the Spirit
[1:01:54] if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my
[1:01:57] joy that you be like-minded having the
[1:02:02] same love being of one Accord of one
[1:02:06] mind let nothing be done through strife
[1:02:09] or vainglory no but don't don't set
[1:02:11] yourself apart but in lowliness of mind
[1:02:15] let each esteem other better than
[1:02:19] themselves
[1:02:19] I won't ask but every one of us say lord
[1:02:23] help me every every moment friends pride
[1:02:27] is all around you realize sometimes you
[1:02:31] can be praying for God to change a
[1:02:33] certain person and it has nothing to do
[1:02:35] about that person it's all about what's
[1:02:37] bothering you
[1:02:38] that's selfish prayer that's pride it
[1:02:41] had none there it's like I don't want to
[1:02:43] be bothered no more with this God change
[1:02:45] them Lord help them Lord my brother my
[1:02:47] sister help them Lord God what it is
[1:02:49] here and you're not even entering in
[1:02:50] your you're actually praying Lord Oh God
[1:02:53] stop the pestering Lord I don't want to
[1:02:55] be pestered I don't want to be bothered
[1:02:57] with this anymore
[1:02:58] God says well you're not getting it so
[1:03:04] we keep rubbing and keep rubbing keep
[1:03:06] rubbing look up Paul goes on to say look
[1:03:13] not every man on his own things but
[1:03:17] every man also on the things of others
[1:03:20] you mean Paul had to speak this to
[1:03:22] believers yes
[1:03:25] you mean they weren't we oh they were
[1:03:28] wheat inside of kokuboro you see it's
[1:03:34] speaking this because in some of the in
[1:03:37] in different things they had to be
[1:03:39] admonished what were they being
[1:03:41] admonished it wasn't that Paul was
[1:03:42] putting something in but Paul was trying
[1:03:45] to get them to see
[1:03:47] you have to continue to die and yield
[1:03:51] that that life might flow through you
[1:03:55] and notice where the scripture you know
[1:04:00] there's a place in the scripture there
[1:04:02] where I didn't put this up but in acts
[1:04:04] 9:31 it says after when Paul himself
[1:04:07] here when God took ahold of Paul's life
[1:04:10] the Bible then says then had the
[1:04:12] churches rest through all Judea and
[1:04:15] Ganga and Galilee and Samaria and were
[1:04:18] edified and walking in the fear of the
[1:04:20] Lord and in the comfort of the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost and they were multiplied you see
[1:04:25] God knows just how to comfort us and
[1:04:29] this is what Paul is dealing with if
[1:04:32] there's any consolation in Christ if
[1:04:35] there's any encouragement if there's any
[1:04:37] comfort if everything and then Paul
[1:04:40] comes into it fulfill you my joy be
[1:04:42] like-minded having the same love being
[1:04:44] of one Accord of one of mine so when we
[1:04:47] when we look at this we come back even
[1:04:50] to the text and remember Paul is
[1:04:52] speaking the God of all comfort
[1:04:54] there's things notice if God is the God
[1:04:59] of all comfort then Satan also has a
[1:05:02] deception to that as well because real
[1:05:05] comfort it's real encouragement and real
[1:05:08] encouragement is that of truth in truth
[1:05:11] by truth for truth you see this this is
[1:05:15] where Paul could look at and say in this
[1:05:18] if you'll allow me to paraphrase that
[1:05:20] text we read what God has permitted and
[1:05:23] has he comforts us in our tribulations
[1:05:27] he does that that we in turned by that
[1:05:30] same comfort we might be able to comfort
[1:05:35] you when you're going through tests or
[1:05:38] trials and I think God for that I really
[1:05:44] do I think God for that so much because
[1:05:46] when I look around the course many times
[1:05:49] I'm in assembly and many of you know
[1:05:51] I've done this many times when sometimes
[1:05:53] there's things that one might be going
[1:05:55] through and I'm not talking about
[1:05:56] something so personal it might be
[1:05:58] something you know of a job situation or
[1:06:00] whatever
[1:06:00] more and there's things that would come
[1:06:02] back to my heart and remember this
[1:06:04] brother or this sister you know if it's
[1:06:05] a sister to sister a brother to brother
[1:06:07] they went through that exact thing
[1:06:08] somewhat similar hey you know what
[1:06:10] they're they're gonna be able to really
[1:06:13] get down and minister to them there's
[1:06:15] things that I can you know have an
[1:06:16] understanding and say brother sister
[1:06:18] we're praying for you my you know I try
[1:06:20] to consider that trying to look at but
[1:06:21] you take somebody who's been there in
[1:06:24] those shoes they not only can minister
[1:06:27] and help them but they're able to also
[1:06:29] really get in there and pray for him
[1:06:31] because this is a body first Corinthians
[1:06:38] 12 25 that there should be no schism no
[1:06:42] division in the body but that the
[1:06:44] members should have the same care one
[1:06:46] for another you know it's one thing for
[1:06:47] this statement to be here but you see
[1:06:49] God's desire that there be no schism so
[1:06:52] God will allow things to happen that
[1:06:53] causes us to have to break down walls
[1:06:56] now sometimes walls isn't about you
[1:06:58] having a difference with somebody
[1:06:59] sometimes walls themselves is you just
[1:07:02] getting over yourself me getting over
[1:07:04] myself what he was talking about going
[1:07:05] beyond our comfort did to see God has a
[1:07:10] way of that he has a way of that and you
[1:07:13] see listen friends everything in itself
[1:07:15] even when that's coming out of our life
[1:07:17] it's still God working and maturing on
[1:07:19] us to cause us to see it's him it's him
[1:07:23] that's doing the working we're just
[1:07:25] channels and you know what that does it
[1:07:27] brings forth the rest that's already in
[1:07:30] us and we in it it brings that rest to a
[1:07:33] greater reality and then you look at
[1:07:35] something that you or I could look at
[1:07:37] and say well this this expression and
[1:07:39] how this comes forth but what it does
[1:07:41] you want it no it's more than just the
[1:07:43] expression of this brother or the sister
[1:07:44] it opens us in the channel for God to
[1:07:48] continue to speak to us and lead us in
[1:07:51] his word that the members should have
[1:07:57] the same care one for another
[1:07:59] this phrase same care it means to take
[1:08:02] thought to take care for to look out for
[1:08:05] a thing to seek to promote one's
[1:08:08] interest a caring or providing for so
[1:08:11] it's the promoting of the interest of
[1:08:14] one another
[1:08:14] I think it's good that we get to know
[1:08:17] one another you with me it's just like
[1:08:21] when we had the testimony service here
[1:08:23] that night on Thursday night you know
[1:08:25] one of the statements that was made and
[1:08:28] we don't always know what someone's
[1:08:29] going through but you know there's
[1:08:31] others that might be closer to this
[1:08:32] person or whatever more that they were
[1:08:35] aware of it and they were entering in in
[1:08:36] prayer but one of the individuals you
[1:08:38] know made the common sense I didn't even
[1:08:40] know that brother so-and-so was going
[1:08:43] through that I didn't even know so what
[1:08:46] that did on that testimony service not
[1:08:48] only was it a blessing but it opened
[1:08:50] them up to what they already knew God is
[1:08:53] working but it opens them up to hey I
[1:08:55] need to be a little bit more in tune of
[1:08:58] what's going on and that don't mean
[1:08:59] walking around with a no plan and say
[1:09:01] brother ray what are you been going
[1:09:02] through this week are you suffering with
[1:09:03] a cold okay it's a head cold brother no
[1:09:05] that's not what it's talking about being
[1:09:08] sensitive doesn't necessarily mean you
[1:09:11] can always see it you sense it you don't
[1:09:16] see someone here sometimes I know when
[1:09:18] you those of you there sitting in the
[1:09:19] front things like yeah you didn't always
[1:09:21] see who's behind you and and things like
[1:09:22] that but sometimes when you don't see
[1:09:24] one another or you see something it's
[1:09:26] one of those things where it just moves
[1:09:28] on your heart check up on the person did
[1:09:33] I say that too strong
[1:09:35] let me say it stronger check up on the
[1:09:38] person what you don't have to say hey
[1:09:40] brother I this is a both Samuel Eto'o
[1:09:43] calling here is the interrogation list I
[1:09:45] want to know where you were on the night
[1:09:46] of 33rd no it's contact them and just
[1:09:49] say hey brother sister we missed you
[1:09:51] appreciate you because really the
[1:09:55] greatest thing we can do is pray for
[1:09:57] them we don't need to we really don't
[1:09:59] need to know the problem and whether one
[1:10:07] member suffer all the members suffer
[1:10:09] with it and one member be honored all
[1:10:14] the members rejoice with it now you know
[1:10:18] the devil likes to get in all that stuff
[1:10:20] because when one member is honored then
[1:10:23] the devil has come as a pride you need
[1:10:26] to be elevating nobody but Jesus Christ
[1:10:29] you see you look how the devil will work
[1:10:32] the devil is always working to try to
[1:10:36] undermine the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:39] in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:10:41] do we need encouragement we do do we
[1:10:44] need discouragement we do let me let me
[1:10:46] let me speak on that for a moment when
[1:10:48] brother Branham takes us there in the
[1:10:49] Ephesian Church age he says we're Garn
[1:10:52] were in that Paul says that God is not
[1:10:54] quick to forget your work and labor of
[1:10:56] love and then he takes over in the
[1:10:57] Ephesian age of how he praises them and
[1:10:59] brother brems says we as husbands as
[1:11:01] pastors dads so forth couldn't learn a
[1:11:04] whole lot from this phrase on how to run
[1:11:07] our churches and how to run our homes he
[1:11:10] said and that is know when to encourage
[1:11:12] in the right things and the wind to
[1:11:15] discourage them in the wrong things I
[1:11:17] mean look if your wife makes something
[1:11:20] that doesn't appeal to you you don't sit
[1:11:22] there and say hey this was wonderful I
[1:11:24] mean this was good you just you respond
[1:11:26] say it was this good honey how did it
[1:11:29] feel no it's good she knows it's good
[1:11:33] it's it's palatable I've ate it but I'm
[1:11:36] not jumping off the ceiling so don't put
[1:11:38] it on the menu so without me saying I
[1:11:42] don't care for this I don't like this I
[1:11:44] there's just a way of going about it so
[1:11:53] when Paul speaks of this here when one
[1:11:55] member suffer all the members suffer
[1:11:57] with it not all of us are going to be
[1:12:03] able to identify with the exact
[1:12:06] suffering of what's taking place with
[1:12:08] maybe this person or this family or
[1:12:10] whatever more but sometimes it's where
[1:12:12] we are able to look at and say lord help
[1:12:15] them I mean lord I haven't been down
[1:12:18] that but I don't I don't even know how
[1:12:19] that would feel Lord but would you just
[1:12:21] help them Lord you see this is evident
[1:12:26] that there was a need for this to be
[1:12:30] reminded in the body and the body
[1:12:32] encouraged in this it was a need that
[1:12:36] they would be encouraged because
[1:12:37] sometimes it's our lack of awareness
[1:12:40] and yet the grace of God would have
[1:12:43] speak to us on the things that were to
[1:12:44] ask for in that wonderful sometimes you
[1:12:47] know for myself and and I say this this
[1:12:49] is just a it's not a strong point it's a
[1:12:52] weakness and whatever but you know
[1:12:54] sometimes I'm so focused on the that I
[1:12:58] overlook things that have great meaning
[1:13:02] sometimes you can be so focused on doing
[1:13:05] something that you fail to even express
[1:13:08] sympathy or empathy to a person hey
[1:13:13] brother Dave can you go on back there
[1:13:15] and do this instead of come up and
[1:13:17] saying hey god bless it's good to see
[1:13:18] you today how you doing can you help me
[1:13:22] out see that's that's a little different
[1:13:24] now you might look at that say all
[1:13:26] brother the same or that no it is
[1:13:27] needful sometimes it's things that God
[1:13:30] has you know what and God don't mind
[1:13:32] God don't look down at us and said your
[1:13:35] parents should have taught you that he's
[1:13:37] the ultimate parent and he had Paul
[1:13:41] spend all this time with throughout not
[1:13:44] just in Philippians not just in
[1:13:46] Ephesians not just in Colossians not
[1:13:49] just in Philippians not just in Philemon
[1:13:51] all the way through because why there is
[1:13:53] a part about us whether we've learned
[1:13:56] this or we didn't learn it or there's
[1:13:58] things that we need to be admonished in
[1:14:01] hey be a little bit more considerate
[1:14:06] when the church said help me Lord
[1:14:10] now it's evident that this needed to be
[1:14:13] prayed for Romans 15 5 now the god of
[1:14:16] patience and consolation grant you to be
[1:14:21] like-minded one toward another according
[1:14:23] to Christ Jesus so to be like-minded
[1:14:27] toward one another that's I've been
[1:14:30] granted from God that's not just
[1:14:33] something oh that's just part of my
[1:14:34] natural makeup to a certain degree but
[1:14:37] when it overrides our comfort zones when
[1:14:40] it moves beyond just our natural
[1:14:42] abilities to look at a person's face to
[1:14:44] where it just moves in our heart and
[1:14:46] some about it we can't get that person
[1:14:48] off our heart or get this you see what
[1:14:50] that is that's
[1:14:51] granted by God for us to be like-minded
[1:14:54] not just for that one time but God is
[1:14:56] making known to you and I hey you're a
[1:14:59] priest here you're a believer priest
[1:15:01] you're to be sensitive you're a porter
[1:15:03] you've got certain things and charges
[1:15:05] that you're to watch over be mindful of
[1:15:08] this be sensitive this don't just get so
[1:15:10] occupied in your life be sensitive to my
[1:15:13] leading and we all need help I think we
[1:15:18] all could say Amen lord grant it to me
[1:15:20] Lord grant it to me keep Lord keep
[1:15:22] granting it to me Lord verse 6 goes on
[1:15:25] to say this is why that ye may with one
[1:15:28] mind and one mouth glorify God even the
[1:15:32] father of our Lord Jesus Christ notice
[1:15:33] how Paul is dealing with this The effect
[1:15:35] of this granting of a prayer to be
[1:15:37] like-minded is something that actually
[1:15:40] brings unity oh my goodness you mean
[1:15:44] being considerate of one another and and
[1:15:47] praying for one another and I just don't
[1:15:49] mean oh yeah I'm praying for then no but
[1:15:51] I mean really what you're taking burdens
[1:15:53] upon your heart and not just when you're
[1:15:54] in your prayer closet but actually being
[1:15:57] the channel whereby God's as sympathy is
[1:16:01] actually expressed through your life
[1:16:03] such as walking up to the brother and
[1:16:05] say brother I love you
[1:16:07] I appreciate you brother and we mean it
[1:16:10] with all the hearts I don't need to know
[1:16:11] what necessarily they're going through
[1:16:13] it may not even be anything they're
[1:16:15] going through they don't have to be
[1:16:16] going through anything
[1:16:17] it's just something sometimes it just it
[1:16:19] grips my heart I don't know how it is
[1:16:21] just sometimes you know I come out of a
[1:16:23] service and my texts are flying around I
[1:16:25] just you know at different times or
[1:16:27] things throughout the week or different
[1:16:28] is certain things sometimes just
[1:16:30] Brittany and say hey I'm praying for hey
[1:16:32] I appreciate you hey I thank God for you
[1:16:34] and I mean that with all my heart
[1:16:35] because there's something about it there
[1:16:37] that ray something that's her Lord God I
[1:16:39] can't wait for us to get together again
[1:16:41] you don't have nothing to do with me
[1:16:43] preaching it is a love for his body his
[1:16:47] people 1st Thessalonians 4 9 as touching
[1:16:57] brotherly love you need not that I write
[1:17:00] unto you for year your selves are ton of
[1:17:03] God
[1:17:05] to love one another now did Paul not
[1:17:07] write no Paul wrote about the love of
[1:17:09] God remember he would even write to the
[1:17:11] Galatians and say by love serve one
[1:17:13] another but what Paul is expressing here
[1:17:17] is that when this writing there is a
[1:17:20] teaching that has come forth when Christ
[1:17:23] Himself the love of God has entered into
[1:17:25] your soul by the new birth you have
[1:17:28] received of the love of God and you have
[1:17:31] had a personal teaching of God's love of
[1:17:34] how that you ought to love one another
[1:17:36] well how is that when you and I were
[1:17:38] unlovable he came he paid the price
[1:17:41] while we were yet sinners and he came
[1:17:44] and sought us up he actually cleaned us
[1:17:46] up there might have been some of us that
[1:17:48] had to go through you know certain
[1:17:50] stages a little longer and God was
[1:17:52] working with our life long-suffering yet
[1:17:54] the body of Jesus Christ the local body
[1:17:56] we were gathered with my they were
[1:17:58] long-suffering they were putting up with
[1:18:00] our immaturity
[1:18:01] and whatever more but the putting up
[1:18:03] with it is because they had confidence
[1:18:05] and with a God who was in their life
[1:18:07] that if they would pray that prayer and
[1:18:09] holding you up and encouraging you and
[1:18:11] supporting you that what God did in
[1:18:14] their God will do in you that is a work
[1:18:17] of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:19] the Son of man inside of his body so
[1:18:22] this is the teaching Paul was speaking
[1:18:24] of first Thessalonians 14 Paul goes on
[1:18:27] to say for you yourselves are taught of
[1:18:28] God to love one another and indeed ye do
[1:18:32] it toward all the brethren which are in
[1:18:34] Macedonia so it's evident they not only
[1:18:36] loved them they expressed it but we
[1:18:41] beseech you brethren that she increase
[1:18:45] more and more suppose not taking
[1:18:48] anything from them such as you are not
[1:18:50] expressing the love of God but Paul said
[1:18:52] we're beseeching you we're encouraging
[1:18:54] you were admonishing by the Lord that
[1:18:56] you increase more and more so how could
[1:18:59] they increase more and more was it that
[1:19:01] they were going to go out and look for
[1:19:02] how many soup summers that they could
[1:19:04] set up and no it was that they
[1:19:05] themselves would put themselves in a
[1:19:07] place of being more sensitive to
[1:19:10] recognize that his body needs
[1:19:12] ministering to
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:14] first Peter 3:8 watch this finally be he
[1:19:19] all of one mind hmm you know this is
[1:19:28] kind of like when you're deciding on
[1:19:29] where you want to go eat at no my wife
[1:19:33] tells me nope mm-hmm cuz every time I
[1:19:35] decide you say no no I don't say she
[1:19:38] said what do you want honey she said
[1:19:39] because it's your stomach that matters
[1:19:44] you can tell that finally be of one mind
[1:19:47] and she know the right pick if I get to
[1:19:51] pick where we're going to eat hands down
[1:19:53] but you see when you look at that you're
[1:19:55] trying to in that now you got pretty
[1:19:57] boys in the car and they've got one and
[1:19:59] this one's calling this one one's
[1:20:00] calling this lord have mercy where we go
[1:20:02] but can you imagine now let's let's take
[1:20:04] it from that carnal natural example and
[1:20:06] noticing of how why would that be
[1:20:09] because Benjamin has a pilot for certain
[1:20:11] things
[1:20:11] Ben Zachary has a palate for fine
[1:20:14] delicacies of golden arches Paul has
[1:20:16] certain tastes for certain things you
[1:20:18] know Paul like steak Ben likes barbecue
[1:20:20] you know and my wife you know well gee
[1:20:22] you know she kind of likes the dainty
[1:20:24] you know half a sandwich and thimble of
[1:20:26] soup type places and things for me I
[1:20:28] like the places that have the salsa and
[1:20:30] the chips and the so you can see lord
[1:20:32] have mercy what a divided opinion that
[1:20:35] is there somehow somehow we're going to
[1:20:39] get to a restaurant brother keen or
[1:20:40] somehow but how we're gonna do it it's
[1:20:42] gonna require some compromise because we
[1:20:47] don't want to be sitting at that yeah Oh
[1:20:49] had those damn enrolled dinner
[1:20:51] rolls at the steakhouse that yeast met
[1:20:53] but no no no no no no big one mine to
[1:20:57] where that it's not something wrong why
[1:20:59] don't we go this way what but it's it's
[1:21:01] it's looking to the Lord and you know
[1:21:03] this is something that it's just us
[1:21:04] turning switches this is what Peter is
[1:21:08] expressing by the unction of the Holy
[1:21:11] Spirit then the people of God say lord
[1:21:13] help me to be of one mind and Lord teach
[1:21:16] me if there's places in my life where
[1:21:19] I'm lacking and I'm not moving together
[1:21:22] with the body
[1:21:25] finally Behe all of one mind having
[1:21:28] compassion one of another love as
[1:21:32] brethren be pitiful be courteous this
[1:21:36] word compassion having compassion one of
[1:21:38] another it's having compassion one of
[1:21:40] another suffering or feeling the like
[1:21:43] with another sympathetic now if you
[1:21:46] notice it's a key point having
[1:21:48] compassion one of another this is not a
[1:21:50] one-way street but you might say that
[1:21:54] seemed like a one-way street I've
[1:21:55] expressed it to this I've expressed of
[1:21:57] this I've expected but remember your
[1:21:59] expression of love has nothing to do
[1:22:01] with what somebody will do back to you
[1:22:02] sometimes you realize that the
[1:22:04] expressions of love that are given out
[1:22:06] we do not give it to be recognized we do
[1:22:09] not give it so that all it will be given
[1:22:11] back to me we give it because the
[1:22:13] representation of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:22:16] life says pour out sympathy for my
[1:22:19] brother pour out sympathy for the sinner
[1:22:22] enter in for this right here and we are
[1:22:25] under his direction because we're not
[1:22:27] the high priests we are just the priests
[1:22:29] under the high priest hmm one of another
[1:22:35] so it's got to be reciprocated now
[1:22:37] sometimes when you look at it it might
[1:22:39] be one person or somebody they don't
[1:22:41] know how to reciprocate things back
[1:22:42] remember how brother Bram talked about
[1:22:44] when he saw the Pentecostals hugging one
[1:22:45] another on the floor grabbing one
[1:22:47] another you know what the back bill the
[1:22:48] RAM said I've never seen nothing like
[1:22:49] that in my life
[1:22:51] but brother Ram didn't look at it and
[1:22:53] say well I'm gonna be hugging nobody I
[1:22:55] ain't gonna know he began to recognize
[1:22:57] that and then he himself what after
[1:22:59] seeing that expression then brother ban
[1:23:02] and himself seemed the endearment of
[1:23:04] what that meant oh god help us love as
[1:23:13] brethren be pitiful this word pitiful
[1:23:18] means having strong vows having that
[1:23:20] residing within our hearts that's what
[1:23:22] this speaking of compassionate
[1:23:25] tender-hearted tender-hearted not
[1:23:30] calloused not hardened on though the
[1:23:34] cares of life and other things that come
[1:23:35] on then it works to try to harden you
[1:23:37] see
[1:23:38] if this is what God is asking and and
[1:23:40] this is beingin honest throughout the
[1:23:42] churches and the believers there then it
[1:23:45] shows that within that that if this is
[1:23:48] being am honest Satan is attacking that
[1:23:50] you know sometimes you can look at the
[1:23:53] message Christ the mystery of God
[1:23:55] revealed some three three-and-a-half
[1:23:57] hours long and you could say well let me
[1:23:59] speed up to where brother BAM starts
[1:24:00] reading the text in Luke 24 you miss
[1:24:03] what he's saying there because what he
[1:24:05] says before there when he gives
[1:24:07] direction to the church on about
[1:24:09] discipline and how we're to love one
[1:24:11] another if something stinky comes in a
[1:24:14] poison or whatever more you just yield
[1:24:16] and you hold yourself together unite
[1:24:18] with that pastor there you stay with the
[1:24:20] word you see well why is that that's not
[1:24:22] disconnected from the message you want
[1:24:24] to see Christ who is the mystery of God
[1:24:27] revealed and Satan knows friends when
[1:24:31] we've been born the Spirit of God he
[1:24:33] ain't gonna get us on doctrine he ain't
[1:24:35] gonna get us and running around in the
[1:24:37] world those things are gone brother
[1:24:39] sister but the thing that he'll work on
[1:24:41] is that all sticky carnal nature but
[1:24:48] girl repeated or greater is He that is
[1:24:51] in me than he that is in the world Paul
[1:24:56] goes on to say here's the ephesian
[1:24:58] church the sons of God remember those
[1:25:00] that brother brand would always say that
[1:25:01] Paul could speak and teach deep things
[1:25:03] this is deep be kind one to another oh
[1:25:08] Lord maybe he was talking to the Sunday
[1:25:10] School class no he was talking to the
[1:25:12] children of Abraham oh yeah oh yeah see
[1:25:16] we need to stay simple and be you kind
[1:25:20] one to another tender-hearted forgiving
[1:25:26] one another even as God for Christ's
[1:25:28] sake hath forgiven you now notice how
[1:25:31] Paul would go on here in Ephesians 4
[1:25:34] verse 14 seeing them that we have a
[1:25:36] great high priest that is passed into
[1:25:38] the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us
[1:25:40] hold fast our profession for we have not
[1:25:44] an High Priest which cannot be touched
[1:25:46] with the feeling of our infirmities but
[1:25:48] was in all points tempted like
[1:25:51] as we are yet without sin let us
[1:25:53] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:25:55] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[1:25:58] grace to help in time of need this
[1:26:01] phrase to be touched and the same of
[1:26:03] feeling it's to be affected with the
[1:26:06] same feeling as another to sympathize
[1:26:09] with to feel for have compassion or
[1:26:11] remember we read last week God himself
[1:26:14] in order to understand what temptation
[1:26:18] was in order to understand that as the
[1:26:21] Prophet said in order to justify man God
[1:26:24] Himself came down and he took upon the
[1:26:27] body his body his son which he created
[1:26:31] and he walked here and he lived in that
[1:26:33] body and redeemed you and I and as he
[1:26:36] redeemed you and I remember through the
[1:26:38] whole process of redemption and the
[1:26:41] journey he so subjected himself to where
[1:26:44] that he himself was actually able to
[1:26:47] feel temptation
[1:26:48] remember God cannot be tempted James 1
[1:26:50] but remember Jesus was tempted you're
[1:26:54] saying Jesus wasn't gone well no he was
[1:26:56] cause but remember the body itself the
[1:26:59] body was not God
[1:27:01] but God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:27:05] world to himself are you with me it had
[1:27:08] to be a virgin body a virgin born body
[1:27:11] blood that was not of what was here on
[1:27:13] this earth in order to be able to redeem
[1:27:17] you and I back because it was blood that
[1:27:19] took us out it would be blood that would
[1:27:21] bring us back home so he in through the
[1:27:24] whole process think of this now if the
[1:27:26] resurrection of the Lord Jesus he does
[1:27:28] not leave the corporal body here but God
[1:27:31] takes his corporal body and there it is
[1:27:33] seated on the throne as a memorial you
[1:27:36] know that memorial is that just as he
[1:27:38] ascended you're ascending to just as he
[1:27:41] was raptured up you're going to be
[1:27:43] raptured - it is a witness that what he
[1:27:46] himself was able to prevail and move
[1:27:49] beyond all the atmospheres of evil that
[1:27:51] he himself through the new birth in our
[1:27:53] soul would actually bring us to a place
[1:27:56] of where he is father I would that they
[1:27:58] be with me where I
[1:28:01] I'm out and yet we're not there and yet
[1:28:03] were there when we have been born again
[1:28:05] of the Spirit of God we have been
[1:28:08] connected identified yoked with our
[1:28:10] theophany our representation in heavenly
[1:28:13] places that was always there and were
[1:28:16] identified and reflecting we have
[1:28:18] representation there so if this is our
[1:28:24] high priest he can be touched he a means
[1:28:27] he understands he understands Paul goes
[1:28:32] on and Paul expresses of how the field
[1:28:34] of believers saw this saw this and his
[1:28:36] need that he had Hebrews 1034 for ye had
[1:28:41] compassion of me in my bonds and took
[1:28:46] joyfully the spoiling of your Goods
[1:28:50] knowing in yourselves that she have in
[1:28:53] heaven a better and enduring substance
[1:28:56] look how this was Paul so looking at
[1:28:59] what was the origin or the route as they
[1:29:02] caught and were able to minister that
[1:29:04] compassion they recognized there is a
[1:29:06] better enduring substance waiting on me
[1:29:10] that's what they were living by not
[1:29:12] notice you know as we've said these
[1:29:14] words here I think over the past a few
[1:29:16] weeks or what-have-you but you know
[1:29:18] there's a difference between sympathy
[1:29:19] and empathy we need both of them
[1:29:22] sympathy is when you can and you can
[1:29:23] actually enter in and say I've been
[1:29:25] there I've been through that somewhat
[1:29:26] just like that and then empathy is where
[1:29:28] maybe you have not been through that but
[1:29:30] you're able to enter in and say boy this
[1:29:32] is guy that's got to be rough that's
[1:29:34] just my lord that's just got to be rough
[1:29:41] you know with me here brother branham is
[1:29:44] talking about a situation has taken
[1:29:47] place where a lady she could not get off
[1:29:49] of her heart to go pray for this baby
[1:29:52] she couldn't get her off her heart she
[1:29:54] she kept on saying no that the sister is
[1:29:56] already here in a meeting but she's
[1:29:57] brother bands gonna no doubt the Holy
[1:29:58] Spirit oh called it out it it'll be
[1:30:00] healed then and she couldn't get off her
[1:30:02] heart brother Brent tells in another
[1:30:04] message he said she came up to the
[1:30:06] sister I love this she said sister she
[1:30:09] said would you mind she said if I would
[1:30:11] pray for your baby she said the Holy
[1:30:12] Spirit just keeps dealing with my heart
[1:30:14] said would you mind she said now sister
[1:30:16] she said I know you're here she said and
[1:30:19] you'll probably be on the platform she
[1:30:21] said you go ahead and go to that
[1:30:24] platform she said but will you just let
[1:30:25] me obey the Holy Spirit what he told me
[1:30:27] to do I hope you're with me
[1:30:31] it didn't say right here this is the
[1:30:35] prayer of faith
[1:30:35] you ain't gonna even need to go up that
[1:30:37] platform if that would have been the
[1:30:38] case there would have been nothing done
[1:30:41] you risked me it'd have been nothing
[1:30:43] done because it would have been through
[1:30:45] strife and vain glory you with Holy
[1:30:48] Spirit sensitive friends very sensitive
[1:30:51] now notice brother ram goes on and he's
[1:30:53] talking about what took place and it
[1:30:55] happened to be that this lady was about
[1:30:57] the third or fourth one in line the lady
[1:30:59] with the baby that was sick well the
[1:31:00] little mother up in the building you
[1:31:02] know up in the top she was so happy she
[1:31:05] said oh thank you Lord I'm so glad for
[1:31:08] that little mother that was on my heart
[1:31:10] so forth so so for that poor little sick
[1:31:13] baby when the little baby got in the
[1:31:15] prayer line and come up close to where
[1:31:16] we were standing where I was standing I
[1:31:18] looked at her that brother I said we got
[1:31:20] it on tape and he says I a Connor assets
[1:31:22] sister your baby is suffering with and
[1:31:24] yes I forget what it was some kind of a
[1:31:26] disease or trouble said you've come from
[1:31:29] a certain place and you are so-and-so
[1:31:30] miss a certain name and said but your
[1:31:33] baby is already healed said because the
[1:31:36] Holy Spirit spoke to that little lady
[1:31:38] standing up there in the balcony
[1:31:40] she's already prayed the prayer of faith
[1:31:43] for your baby you see it's just examples
[1:31:50] like this if you even look closely in
[1:31:52] the book of Acts you see the Ministry of
[1:31:55] the body of Jesus Christ it's just like
[1:31:59] that we have that ministry one to
[1:32:01] another we need the Christ in one
[1:32:04] another let me say that again
[1:32:06] we need the Christ in one another I'll
[1:32:11] tell you this right here I've witnessed
[1:32:13] many times things that I've had
[1:32:14] questions and I've prayed about and God
[1:32:17] would bring a minister not necessarily
[1:32:19] an older minister a younger minister
[1:32:23] and they would minister and right there
[1:32:25] whether they said it exact or weather
[1:32:27] was something the Holy Spirit just so
[1:32:29] inspired at that moment right there it
[1:32:31] open and my rejoicing had to do with God
[1:32:34] opened it to me now you know what I
[1:32:36] didn't care how old the person was or
[1:32:38] how young they was because I believe
[1:32:41] there's a gift in that life and the Holy
[1:32:43] Spirit who is the Ancient of Days is
[1:32:46] going to speak to my need it has nothing
[1:32:48] to do with the veil ho glory be to God
[1:32:55] the venoms let me read this next part
[1:32:58] the compassion of that mother for the
[1:33:03] baby would have went far beyond what I'd
[1:33:09] have had for it you catch that the
[1:33:15] compassion of that mother what was it
[1:33:17] she was a mother she had been a mother
[1:33:19] it's evident that within her life she
[1:33:22] had experience as a mother what it means
[1:33:24] when a baby is sick and it gripped your
[1:33:27] heart see the Holy Spirit it wasn't just
[1:33:29] her naturally looking upon somebody and
[1:33:31] trying to naturally fix it it was the
[1:33:33] Spirit of God listen to me the Spirit of
[1:33:36] God moved behind the experience that she
[1:33:40] had went through as a mother and you
[1:33:42] don't even know what kind of experience
[1:33:44] or experiences she'd been through maybe
[1:33:46] there were experiences where her baby
[1:33:48] was at the point of death
[1:33:50] maybe it wasn't experience where she
[1:33:52] lost her baby we don't know what it was
[1:33:54] but any rate the Holy Spirit was able to
[1:33:57] move in there and she was able to say
[1:33:59] dude you might have her proof for your
[1:34:01] baby
[1:34:03] what was that non earthly compassion
[1:34:06] it was the compassion she was so
[1:34:09] anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:20] I'm gonna reading the rest of that but
[1:34:22] I'm gonna read that one again is that
[1:34:23] alright the compassion of that mother
[1:34:26] for the baby would have went far beyond
[1:34:30] what I'd have had for it so you see the
[1:34:33] gift of healing he said if God ever
[1:34:35] speaks to your heart to go pray for
[1:34:38] somebody this end just brother man this
[1:34:41] is from me to you you do you do what God
[1:34:47] tells you to do always follow the Holy
[1:34:51] Spirit listen I'm not a preacher but if
[1:34:58] you're born of the Spirit of God you are
[1:35:00] in the body and subject to any of the
[1:35:03] non spiritual gifts the probably said
[1:35:06] those gifts meal throughout the body it
[1:35:09] might be a one tonight and not on one
[1:35:11] tomorrow really many times here listen
[1:35:13] friends the gifts are working it's just
[1:35:15] that we don't always see them because
[1:35:17] the visible ones would be that of
[1:35:19] tongues and prophecy interpretation
[1:35:21] which are the least I appreciate them
[1:35:26] but I want you to understand sometimes
[1:35:29] when people say we want to see the gifts
[1:35:31] that gets already working even when you
[1:35:34] have been moved on your heart to call
[1:35:36] somebody texts about it send them a card
[1:35:38] do email whatever it is maybe it's the
[1:35:40] contact with them babies to say hey you
[1:35:42] think we can get to Cologne advert for a
[1:35:43] lunch hey you think we can get together
[1:35:45] for coffee or whatever more or something
[1:35:47] just in that manner do you realize it's
[1:35:48] a spirit of God working through your
[1:35:51] life glory to be the God you have been
[1:35:53] able to so surrender yourself and move
[1:35:56] so far away from the cares of life until
[1:35:59] the Lord Jesus can move right behind the
[1:36:02] experiences in your life and my life
[1:36:05] that he's comforting us in and then
[1:36:07] through that that comfort is able to
[1:36:09] pour out to others Colossians 3:12 put
[1:36:18] all therefore as the elect of God holy
[1:36:21] and beloved boughs of Mercy kindness
[1:36:25] humbleness of mine meekness
[1:36:27] long-suffering the joy this in just
[1:36:30] automatic he's telling put all that
[1:36:33] praise mean
[1:36:34] sink into the garment that is given to
[1:36:38] you do you realize you were ordained to
[1:36:42] be a priest of God you were ordained you
[1:36:46] are part of that family that he has
[1:36:48] redeemed but then when the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] the great Road of God moves upon that
[1:36:54] seed on the inside it releases the
[1:36:57] coloration that he is the line the oxen
[1:37:00] and the Eagle it releases the Ministry
[1:37:03] of Christ through your life it is now a
[1:37:06] priestly garment and what does he say
[1:37:10] put off well don't already have it on we
[1:37:12] do but sink into it surrender submit
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:19] this word vows it's a word that dudes
[1:37:24] derive from spleen you know what a
[1:37:25] spleen is a minister on that sometime
[1:37:27] ago a spleen is what cleans your blood
[1:37:30] and your blood cells if there are cells
[1:37:33] that are bad it takes them you don't let
[1:37:36] them pass through a certain opening
[1:37:39] because it can't fit through that
[1:37:41] opening so it has to go to the other
[1:37:44] opening it has to get broke down and
[1:37:46] remoted aren't you glad oh we've got a
[1:37:49] real spleen of God come on somebody
[1:37:52] we're cells themselves remember we don't
[1:37:54] want bruised sails bruised sails can
[1:37:56] start a cancer so having the spleen of
[1:38:03] God say lord help me to have that so
[1:38:07] active so active in you that it's
[1:38:10] arresting wrong thoughts when the devil
[1:38:12] tries to send this thought about your
[1:38:13] brother said no hi I'm taking that I
[1:38:14] know where that's coming from
[1:38:16] well you know how there's an ulcer I
[1:38:18] ain't taking that that maybe there might
[1:38:20] be certain things that bothered me like
[1:38:21] that but I am taking your word for it I
[1:38:23] haven't even taken your word for it
[1:38:24] you're out you're just right here you
[1:38:26] are to obey me
[1:38:30] are you with what's this here the
[1:38:33] Hebrews they regard this the bow as the
[1:38:37] seat of the tender affection especially
[1:38:40] kindness benevolence compassion hence
[1:38:42] our heart tender mercies affections a
[1:38:45] heart in which mercy resides and these
[1:38:49] mercies bowels of Merced have a have a
[1:38:52] reserve you know what it is to have a
[1:38:54] reserve of something it means it's there
[1:38:57] it's reserved it is awaiting display so
[1:39:02] you've got to keep filling it up right
[1:39:05] they had to keep on putting oil in the
[1:39:09] ball
[1:39:10] how did they put all in the bowl the oil
[1:39:12] was poured down from on high come on now
[1:39:15] coming down in through the main stem it
[1:39:18] comes down into the ball and then the
[1:39:20] branches are replaced from that so it's
[1:39:22] keeping the love of God in our heart
[1:39:31] Mercy's his bowels of mercies compassion
[1:39:35] pity mercy vows in which compassion
[1:39:39] resides a heart of compassion emotions
[1:39:42] longings manifestations of pity I don't
[1:39:48] know I don't know if you've ever read it
[1:39:50] but many times there's a many prayers I
[1:39:51] have that brother Neville prayed that
[1:39:52] brother Bram called him to pray there's
[1:39:54] many different prayers I just have them
[1:39:55] saved away they just bless me listen to
[1:39:58] this prayer brother Neville is asked to
[1:40:00] pray in the message father Denton
[1:40:02] different identifications of the true
[1:40:04] church if his prayer is in brackets
[1:40:06] brother Browns words are outside of the
[1:40:08] brackets father the great problems and
[1:40:11] the trials of tomorrow will seem us
[1:40:13] nothing as we're able to hold by hand
[1:40:15] and walk through a theme the events is
[1:40:18] truly Lord we pray Lord that that would
[1:40:22] give us a deep-seated compassion one for
[1:40:26] the other knowing that while one is in
[1:40:29] the deepness of trial and the hardness
[1:40:31] of testing that week - one of these days
[1:40:34] shall go through like circumstances God
[1:40:37] give us the Spirit of Jesus in us till
[1:40:41] we fail for each of
[1:40:43] enough until there will be unity between
[1:40:47] us until we can serve thee together give
[1:40:58] us a deep-seated compassion you see what
[1:41:02] he's doing he's asking one grant that he
[1:41:05] would grant us to be this way lord help
[1:41:09] me Lord help me Lord God
[1:41:12] but then that deep-seated compassion
[1:41:14] would be within me Lord
[1:41:16] not just where I'm just concerned about
[1:41:18] me and thinking about me but it below
[1:41:20] you means such a deep seat of compassion
[1:41:23] that while one is in trial hardness of
[1:41:27] testing may we have that knowing that we
[1:41:29] ourselves too will go through some times
[1:41:38] what I found I'm just going to speak
[1:41:42] very plain sometimes what I found is
[1:41:45] sometimes the people who do not
[1:41:46] expressed expect the most why didn't
[1:41:53] they call me why don't they do this why
[1:41:55] not to do that you need to tell that
[1:41:59] devil get off my shoulder you are not
[1:42:03] running down my brother and my sister
[1:42:05] like that get out of here because they
[1:42:08] might have had something going on too
[1:42:09] maybe there was something you see what
[1:42:11] is giving them the benefit of a doubt
[1:42:12] it's keeping out malice it's keeping out
[1:42:15] all of those things instead of son oh
[1:42:20] lord please let the computer turn on
[1:42:22] because I don't want to pull something I
[1:42:23] don't want to always say sometimes
[1:42:27] people won't let in by nobody know their
[1:42:28] feelings out here they'll just put it on
[1:42:30] Facebook Oh Lord where'd this come from
[1:42:34] no just put it out there for everybody
[1:42:37] to see I'll tell you what Facebook
[1:42:43] itself is gonna be one of the greatest
[1:42:44] damn nations for people because there is
[1:42:48] an effect of your actions whether you
[1:42:50] say it here or you say
[1:42:52] with these are you with me yes we need
[1:42:56] to be very sensitive look the scripture
[1:42:58] said offenses will come you're going to
[1:43:01] be misunderstood I'm gonna be
[1:43:03] misunderstood and we have in but it's
[1:43:06] with standing with deep-seated
[1:43:07] compassion do you realize it's got to be
[1:43:09] something of a reserve operating in our
[1:43:12] life now right now you might not be
[1:43:15] having any difficulty or anything
[1:43:17] whatsoever and there might be nothing
[1:43:19] you're going through but yet within the
[1:43:21] midst of it it's actually staying right
[1:43:23] there in a constant fellowship with God
[1:43:25] to where you've got such a deep-seated
[1:43:27] compassion I'll tell your friends right
[1:43:29] now listen a person can say I'm praying
[1:43:31] I'm doing this and that brother Graham
[1:43:32] says if you're praying and you're
[1:43:33] rejecting the word you are not communion
[1:43:36] with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:36] you've been communing with Devils I'm
[1:43:39] gonna be very straight right now there's
[1:43:41] no way you can stand in the presence of
[1:43:43] God and accuse another brother or sister
[1:43:45] and in Mercy itself is being residing
[1:43:50] within your heart let me tell you
[1:43:52] something it's not looking and being
[1:43:54] critical of one another and of the body
[1:43:57] of Jesus Christ we've got to recognize
[1:44:02] these things what if I ever had a time
[1:44:09] of success of praying for anyone how
[1:44:12] many know there was success in the
[1:44:14] ministry brother banner
[1:44:15] he had member of the Graham said notice
[1:44:17] I said he had success he had more
[1:44:21] success in my ministry he had that
[1:44:24] didn't mean that God overrode brother
[1:44:26] Branham he's a channel if I ever had a
[1:44:31] time of success of praying for anyone is
[1:44:33] when I could enter into the fellowship
[1:44:35] with them feel their infirmities feel
[1:44:38] their conditions then something in you
[1:44:41] goes down beyond the reasoning and
[1:44:44] praise the prayer faith for the sick
[1:44:46] you've got a feel for a man you've got
[1:44:49] to sympathize with him you've got to be
[1:44:52] with him before you can help him you've
[1:44:57] got to be with him before you can help
[1:45:00] him what is this Redemption Redemption
[1:45:02] Redemption before you and I could
[1:45:06] be where we are in him he came to me
[1:45:14] then y'all but it's a me that's work I
[1:45:16] know it's work its work as a parent you
[1:45:21] with me brother Bantam all throughout
[1:45:23] you know the message and take the very
[1:45:25] beginning of the message indictment
[1:45:26] program starts out with there and he
[1:45:28] deals with the teenage children things
[1:45:29] and he said we must suffer with them you
[1:45:35] know sometimes you want to wring their
[1:45:36] necks sometimes you want but you must
[1:45:37] suffer with them because you know what
[1:45:39] really they do know it all I mean they
[1:45:41] don't know I mean you know you you have
[1:45:43] to suffer sometimes with them suffering
[1:45:46] means it's not always saying you know
[1:45:48] what be quiet you don't know what you're
[1:45:50] talking about
[1:45:52] well sounds like I've experienced
[1:45:54] something you with me these things are
[1:45:59] brother Ram deals with suffering
[1:46:00] sometimes suffering is where we're able
[1:46:02] to say wow because you can do more
[1:46:08] damage with this it's sometimes just to
[1:46:14] say Lord I need the greater is He that's
[1:46:16] within me to take a hold of this tongue
[1:46:19] that will set it on fire Lord's call
[1:46:22] calls it Lord and you let the Holy
[1:46:25] Spirit just put the bits in the mouth
[1:46:26] and throw a beat of God then you enter
[1:46:40] into some sort of a deepness not a mind
[1:46:45] you what I mentioned before I'll tell
[1:46:46] you what I think it's wonderful being a
[1:46:48] daddy
[1:46:49] being a parent it's it's wonderful you
[1:46:50] come through those transitions but it's
[1:46:53] also very reflective you're looking at
[1:46:56] how do I continue to win their heart
[1:47:00] Lord help me know when to speak and help
[1:47:03] me know what to say
[1:47:05] you with me they're going through their
[1:47:08] time and listen friends you and I have
[1:47:09] been through that time maybe some of you
[1:47:11] have been maybe some of you are whatever
[1:47:12] listen there's times even after we've
[1:47:14] been born again in the kingdom of God
[1:47:15] some of us have come to a place to over
[1:47:17] spiritual teenagers nobody can tell us
[1:47:19] nothing preach brother Samuel I will we
[1:47:24] know it all man I mean we were the lungs
[1:47:29] well you know we so there's you gotta
[1:47:32] suffer and thank God there were people
[1:47:35] who suffered with me and thank God you
[1:47:36] still are suffering with me but don't
[1:47:39] worry it's reciprocated I'm suffering
[1:47:40] with you too I love you then you enter
[1:47:49] into some sort of a deepness notice then
[1:47:52] you enter into some sort of a deepness
[1:47:54] it's the love of God it's beyond human
[1:47:58] love I mean know what I'm talking about
[1:48:00] when it comes down and you realize
[1:48:01] something has taken over something is
[1:48:07] here controlling me when I ought to feel
[1:48:09] like this or out to be like this or the
[1:48:11] Bulls coming where's the gun but then
[1:48:17] his presence takes over and to think
[1:48:21] brother BAM didn't say you dumb animal
[1:48:24] why no world you even come in after me
[1:48:26] they should have slaughtered you when
[1:48:27] you killed that man before Ronna if he'd
[1:48:31] have done that there wouldn't have been
[1:48:32] any more messages but what did he do he
[1:48:38] took that animal now notice that animal
[1:48:40] would not be able to extent understand
[1:48:42] his words it went like a dog that he had
[1:48:45] trained and that dog can kind of you
[1:48:47] know pick out the sounds and the tones
[1:48:48] no he hadn't been around that but what
[1:48:51] it was it was the atmosphere of the
[1:48:54] Creator that had moved down and was
[1:48:56] being expressed through those words I'm
[1:48:58] sorry I walked through your pasture I
[1:49:02] didn't mean to disturb you
[1:49:04] I'm sorry Oh God
[1:49:11] help me Lord Jesus help me
[1:49:17] the remm says I'm gonna tell you
[1:49:19] something you may clasp me a fanatic
[1:49:20] after this but I feel like I want to
[1:49:23] tell you something anyhow many things
[1:49:24] happen like that and frankly all my
[1:49:27] ministry has been wrapped around that
[1:49:30] one thing if I can love that or fall in
[1:49:34] sympathy with it in my ministry nothing
[1:49:38] next quote I've seen you I've been
[1:49:39] practically over the world several trips
[1:49:41] overseas seven or eight trips among the
[1:49:43] heathens and everywhere and I find this
[1:49:45] that the most forceful thing I can think
[1:49:47] of is love if I'm praying for a person
[1:49:50] if I can't have the feeling of that
[1:49:53] person upon my heart it never works so
[1:50:01] it wasn't just brother branham walking
[1:50:03] around and whoever I lay my hands on and
[1:50:04] I pray for or I take my hat off not even
[1:50:06] Nina lay my hands on if I just pray you
[1:50:08] know God's gonna come and back that up
[1:50:10] it was not so he had to enter in to the
[1:50:15] feeling once you think of this I just
[1:50:18] just through the testimony last night I
[1:50:20] would just listen to a little bit of
[1:50:22] brother Branham when brother Billy was
[1:50:24] out there around the fire they were
[1:50:25] preparing steaks and Sabine Yochanan and
[1:50:27] brother Branham walked over behind him
[1:50:29] and he knew Billy was real nervous and
[1:50:30] they're all tired up and he took off his
[1:50:32] hat he didn't say anything out loud but
[1:50:34] he just prayed for him when he got over
[1:50:36] brother Branham got around with the
[1:50:38] people that the brothers are there that
[1:50:39] day around the campfire and he was
[1:50:41] unlacing his boot while he was talking
[1:50:42] with the brothers and he told him he
[1:50:43] said you know he said I took off my hat
[1:50:45] he said some time ago he said when Billy
[1:50:47] was cooking them steaks he said because
[1:50:48] you don't know what he goes through in
[1:50:50] the meetings he said he's so tore up
[1:50:51] he's so nervous he said the things that
[1:50:53] he has to endure he said I just I asked
[1:50:56] God to let him have a good evening he
[1:50:59] said brother Branham kept on taking off
[1:51:00] his boots and finally got it off and
[1:51:02] brother Billy said his ankle was about
[1:51:04] that big around it was black and blue
[1:51:07] and he told the brothers he said you
[1:51:11] know he said this happened when I was
[1:51:12] hunting he said I tripped over a post he
[1:51:16] said now that's been back since October
[1:51:17] he said you know I've prayed for the God
[1:51:19] to heal that everyday so but it's got
[1:51:20] worse
[1:51:21] I heard I asked you did you hear me he
[1:51:24] said this gift is not for me it's for
[1:51:27] his people
[1:51:28] I prayed since October you know what
[1:51:31] this date this was brother Billy said it
[1:51:32] was February February I prayed and it
[1:51:36] got worse I wonder I wonder when I look
[1:51:38] at that right there I'll tell you I told
[1:51:40] my wife last night
[1:51:41] I said you know that speaks up it speaks
[1:51:42] not of the DNA of Branham it speaks of
[1:51:45] equality of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:48] working in the heart of his people to
[1:51:52] where if he said how about that it had
[1:51:56] not permit a disease to come on you and
[1:51:58] I take you home would you be willing to
[1:52:00] do it would you be willing that your
[1:52:04] your heart would beat out as a testimony
[1:52:06] though he slay me yet I'll serve him
[1:52:08] would you be willing to be so anointed
[1:52:11] for that or we say Lord oh Lord I'm
[1:52:14] gonna prefer my brother wait a minute me
[1:52:18] that one right there Lord I hope you
[1:52:23] understanding me oh can I have just a
[1:52:33] little bit more time when I think no
[1:52:38] brother brems says if I can have the
[1:52:40] feeling of that person upon my heart if
[1:52:42] I can't it never works so evidently
[1:52:45] brother Joey he experienced never works
[1:52:47] right he's experienced where it's where
[1:52:51] it hasn't worked because if you know
[1:52:52] where it works then you also know when
[1:52:54] it doesn't work you've experienced it I
[1:52:55] won't ask you to raise your hands but
[1:52:57] we've been there when I think notice
[1:53:01] when I think what if I was standing in
[1:53:05] their place what if that was my baby
[1:53:08] what if that was my mother my wife my
[1:53:11] sister my brother when you feel that
[1:53:15] wave for them then something begins to
[1:53:19] move out
[1:53:21] compassion goes out and catches the
[1:53:24] patient and brings them back a frenzy
[1:53:27] said I know that God loves you now watch
[1:53:29] brother branham deals with this this
[1:53:30] chain of sympathy here let me read you
[1:53:32] this quote here now two out of
[1:53:35] out of the message blood Ram is talking
[1:53:36] about what took place on the day of
[1:53:38] Pentecost now when you look at this at
[1:53:40] what took place on the day of Pentecost
[1:53:41] there and you think about it here the
[1:53:44] same Holy Spirit that same life of our
[1:53:47] high priest moves down into Peter and
[1:53:49] the rest of a notice brother Bob said
[1:53:51] here they come about two or three days
[1:53:53] later he said in their coming among he
[1:53:56] said the man who's laying by the by the
[1:53:58] gate called beautiful and he said when
[1:54:00] Peter said silver and gold I don't have
[1:54:02] any but such as I have I give it to you
[1:54:05] take up your bed and walk
[1:54:06] brother M said the young man sprung up
[1:54:09] with a great big a man and he said what
[1:54:11] happened he said it was that chain of
[1:54:14] sympathy and when she catch this
[1:54:17] it was the chain of sympathy the
[1:54:20] compassion of him the Lord Jesus that
[1:54:22] said I had compassion on the sick that
[1:54:26] same spirit had taken place in the old
[1:54:29] fisherman's heart chain of sympathy yeah
[1:54:34] he's tied in to the mercy seat he's tied
[1:54:38] in to the high priest and so are you and
[1:54:41] I if we are born at the spirit of
[1:54:43] Almighty God we are part of that chain
[1:54:45] of sympathy so when you think of a chain
[1:54:50] of sympathy you know how many times you
[1:54:52] you think of it in in the midst of of a
[1:54:54] service how many times brother Branham
[1:54:56] tell us in a service where he said there
[1:54:59] were demons that would be calling that
[1:55:01] one to another
[1:55:02] right he talked about how he said when
[1:55:05] one was called out here he would also
[1:55:07] know there was somebody out there
[1:55:08] suffering with that same thing because n
[1:55:10] demons would try to communicate with one
[1:55:11] another in order to strengthen against
[1:55:15] what God was wanting to do and they were
[1:55:18] trying to build a chain of unbelief but
[1:55:21] then at the same time when there were
[1:55:23] believers in there that kept on entering
[1:55:25] in and then when those out there were
[1:55:27] entering in then what you found was a
[1:55:29] wall of faith that was beginning to
[1:55:32] build among the people and when that
[1:55:34] wall of faith would begin to build then
[1:55:36] God would come and move brother mem says
[1:55:38] it like this in Jesus Christ the same he
[1:55:40] said now we're strangers to one another
[1:55:42] and you believe the Holy Spirit is here
[1:55:44] now what I have
[1:55:46] dear sister I have to feel for you you
[1:55:50] know it has to be something that I
[1:55:54] sympathize with you he says there's too
[1:55:58] much of this cold odd Christianity today
[1:56:01] dried and cut you've got to feel for the
[1:56:04] people well brother Samuel they need to
[1:56:09] get right maybe you are the channel that
[1:56:14] the sympathy can pass through to reach
[1:56:18] their heart oh they may not turn around
[1:56:20] after one time two times three times
[1:56:23] this month next month but you are
[1:56:27] anchored in a chain of sympathy knowing
[1:56:30] all it takes is one touch Wow because
[1:56:35] you has a priest or a witness of that
[1:56:37] and there is vows of mercy hmm so to
[1:56:47] think of this here and brother BAM deals
[1:56:49] with there's too much cold out
[1:56:51] Christianity you know that's a spirit
[1:56:52] that's promised for this last day
[1:56:54] without natural affection without
[1:56:57] feeling not without it whatsoever and so
[1:57:00] to look at this now we can deal with
[1:57:03] that a lot but I want you to think of it
[1:57:04] like this here you are and here we are
[1:57:06] setting in a service like this brother
[1:57:08] Doug and in the midst of a service while
[1:57:10] the word is coming forth and to think of
[1:57:12] it as that word is coming forth there
[1:57:14] might be things brother Joey that maybe
[1:57:16] it's not what you're particularly going
[1:57:18] through at that time and it might be
[1:57:19] thing brother ray that you are gods
[1:57:21] already brought you through but yet
[1:57:23] within it you might be sitting there and
[1:57:25] you're looking at this thing and brother
[1:57:26] Brian you look at and said that channel
[1:57:29] right there I'm gonna pull somebody in
[1:57:32] here has a need I know I've got needs
[1:57:33] and I know that right here we're here
[1:57:35] and I'm gonna pull on the gift of God I
[1:57:37] am going to submit myself to the flow of
[1:57:40] the Holy Ghost there are needs to be met
[1:57:43] in this service you know what you're
[1:57:45] doing you are creating a wall of faith
[1:57:49] it's not about how they know that yeah I
[1:57:52] can finish that quote yeah I know it
[1:57:53] scripture come that it ain't about that
[1:57:55] this is not a recital this is where we
[1:57:59] come to worship the Living God that he
[1:58:02] moves among us and meets and ministers
[1:58:05] for the needs of his children and to
[1:58:07] think that we can so unite ourselves
[1:58:09] together it may be something we maybe
[1:58:12] were praying about something brother
[1:58:13] Joey and his son we've got in our heart
[1:58:15] and we've come here and we're expecting
[1:58:16] God to answer
[1:58:17] I mean we're expecting and maybe the way
[1:58:20] that service is directed it may not you
[1:58:22] may look at that text say huh it don't
[1:58:24] look like it's gonna come my way today
[1:58:25] but you know what I know that God is
[1:58:27] able to pass my way because was a kiyose
[1:58:29] it looked like he was going to go the
[1:58:30] other way when he walked with the two on
[1:58:32] the road to Emmaus it made as though he
[1:58:34] would keep on going but I know he's
[1:58:35] still God he knows my need and in the
[1:58:37] midst of that time maybe has the service
[1:58:39] unfolds it don't seem like anything's
[1:58:41] coming down your pathway but you
[1:58:43] recognize as a priest of God it ain't
[1:58:45] about you you submit yourself and say
[1:58:47] come on man of God preached Holy Spirit
[1:58:50] visit us move among this congregation
[1:58:52] Lord speak to the needs of your children
[1:58:55] Lord God you might walk out of here and
[1:58:57] your need wasn't met but you're so
[1:58:59] blessed you mean God would do that yeah
[1:59:04] he would see whether are we over our
[1:59:07] selves because we're priests after all
[1:59:15] huh think about how brother Brandt would
[1:59:17] talk about that greatest battle ever
[1:59:19] fought he said think he said if they're
[1:59:22] going to get people in one Accord there
[1:59:25] won't be one feeble one in the building
[1:59:27] in the next five minutes he said anyone
[1:59:30] would be one person desiring the Holy
[1:59:31] Ghost of what they would receive it do
[1:59:34] you see how the enemy is working it's
[1:59:36] even in that place friends of that
[1:59:38] compassion of where we enter into the
[1:59:40] word y'all still with me where we're
[1:59:46] entering into that of the word and
[1:59:48] allowing the Holy Spirit to move a chain
[1:59:53] of sympathy I know I asked you a little
[1:59:58] bit
[1:59:59] before but can I have a little bit more
[2:00:02] thank you brother Doug I want to read
[2:00:08] this to you because when we're dealing
[2:00:11] with this sympathy and empathy it deals
[2:00:14] with it that it's more than just us
[2:00:16] looking around in our local assembly
[2:00:19] however that is also a great problem
[2:00:23] because sometimes I find where people
[2:00:25] just live everything is else out where
[2:00:27] remember there is one great big body of
[2:00:31] Jesus Christ around the world many
[2:00:34] little outposts and within every local
[2:00:39] body that local body is just like your
[2:00:42] family unit but your family unit is a
[2:00:47] part of other family units that's just
[2:00:50] like the body of Jesus Christ obviously
[2:00:52] you're gonna be more aware and in tune
[2:00:54] with what's going on in your home then
[2:00:58] you are with what's going on elsewhere
[2:01:00] that's how it is in a local body that's
[2:01:02] the blessing but the Rev says you have
[2:01:04] people who love you and pray for you how
[2:01:07] can they pray for me for maybe some need
[2:01:09] that I've got over in Africa unless I
[2:01:11] contact him and say brother Steven would
[2:01:12] you pray for him brother Samson would
[2:01:14] you pray for me brother Timothy would
[2:01:15] you unless I contact him they're not
[2:01:17] gonna know but you see you know who
[2:01:19] knows you Yuda God has placed you here
[2:01:24] in my life to help me however there are
[2:01:31] times when maybe another situation has
[2:01:33] taken place maybe in another another
[2:01:35] assembly brother Andy or or some
[2:01:37] something has taken place is like what
[2:01:38] they can place at their church over
[2:01:40] there where we can actually enter in and
[2:01:41] reach out and help out when I ask
[2:01:43] brother any is there anything we can do
[2:01:44] to help you or anything at all you can
[2:01:46] reach in and pray when they had that
[2:01:48] pipe bust you know I'm talking about
[2:01:49] when you have those things it's like
[2:01:51] that you see it may not be well that's
[2:01:53] not part of my similar but they're part
[2:01:54] of the body of Jesus Christ come on
[2:01:58] church it's a body of Jesus Christ now
[2:02:01] watch this in a personal experience with
[2:02:03] God I feel it's necessary for me to read
[2:02:05] this to you Bill Graham said this great
[2:02:06] evangelist it's on the field today
[2:02:08] perhaps wouldn't agree with me on divine
[2:02:10] healing our lovely brother
[2:02:13] Billy Graham but the other day when I
[2:02:15] was listening to a radio program coming
[2:02:17] across the nation I heard that he was in
[2:02:19] Germany in the hospital or something
[2:02:21] sick with a kidney block I could not
[2:02:24] help but stop right there
[2:02:27] feeling the sympathetic feeling for our
[2:02:30] brother women he disagrees with you yes
[2:02:32] but he's my brother the sympathy they
[2:02:36] don't believe it maybe he don't see the
[2:02:37] same light you do but he's my brother
[2:02:43] feeling the sympathetic feeling for our
[2:02:45] brother and had prayer for God to
[2:02:48] deliver him and as the days went on in
[2:02:51] his service I heard he was better so
[2:02:54] he's paying attention I heard he was
[2:02:56] better how you feeling now brother joy I
[2:02:58] feel better I heard he was better and
[2:03:01] back in the service again God is using
[2:03:04] our brother in a great and mighty way of
[2:03:06] getting people saved and we sure
[2:03:09] appreciate him and I would ask all
[2:03:11] Christians to pray for our brother as we
[2:03:14] see the hand of God with him saving the
[2:03:16] loss now I pray that God will deliver
[2:03:19] him completely I hear that he's still
[2:03:21] feeling pretty bad so I pray that God
[2:03:23] will completely deliver our brother so
[2:03:26] he can preach the gospel what's this he
[2:03:28] reaches a type of people that perhaps
[2:03:31] wouldn't even come to listen to me in
[2:03:36] the message warning before judgment
[2:03:38] brother Brent says there's three
[2:03:39] messages of the hour he said there's a
[2:03:42] message that Billy Graham is caring of
[2:03:44] repentance he said there's also the
[2:03:47] message he said of divine healing and
[2:03:49] gifts that Oral Roberts is preaching and
[2:03:51] catching but there is the message of the
[2:03:54] hour that is for the bride of Jesus
[2:03:56] Christ the elect of God listen friends
[2:03:59] it is and we look down on anybody else
[2:04:00] that we don't have that attitude if you
[2:04:02] do you need to say God get that away
[2:04:04] from my life because it ought to be
[2:04:07] grateful hey if somebody can't see the
[2:04:09] light that we can see I can shout with
[2:04:11] them on salvation I can shout with them
[2:04:13] on justification I can shout with them
[2:04:15] on sanctification because why I know it
[2:04:21] it's God's mercy think about it what if
[2:04:23] there hadn't been a Billy Graham what if
[2:04:25] there wasn't in all Roberts it's God's
[2:04:28] mercy
[2:04:28] remember what lot said down there and
[2:04:30] Sodom thou hast multiplied by mercy to
[2:04:34] me O God
[2:04:38] I'm coming down Philippians 3:10 that I
[2:04:47] may know him and the power of his
[2:04:51] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[2:04:54] sufferings being made conformable unto
[2:04:58] his death paul said before the
[2:05:03] Fellowship of his suffering bearing
[2:05:05] persecutions with him you know paul he
[2:05:09] he was a man who had suffered with
[2:05:10] christ and when that slave talking about
[2:05:13] Philemon when that slave over there had
[2:05:16] run away I like that
[2:05:18] Paul had borne so much persecutions so
[2:05:22] many things of Christ
[2:05:24] I hope you with me are y'all still with
[2:05:26] me or would you rather me just close he
[2:05:30] had borne so much persecutions it's one
[2:05:33] thing going through it it's another
[2:05:34] thing bearing it I may say lord help me
[2:05:37] bear it help me God that Lord if I
[2:05:40] complain and we do complain sometimes
[2:05:41] help me real quick lord help me to
[2:05:43] remember it's for my good you know Paul
[2:05:50] had to Rick recognized to do that to
[2:05:52] glory in his infirmities he said that
[2:05:54] the power of Christ may rest upon me you
[2:05:58] know what that is the power of Christ
[2:05:59] that's the tent of God that's what that
[2:06:02] phrase means the power of God that in my
[2:06:04] his tent his tabernacle is abode my rest
[2:06:10] I've learned to do what glory in my
[2:06:14] infirmities not run around and said Lord
[2:06:16] God I'm sick no batting yet that's
[2:06:19] ignorant but it's just say Lord you're
[2:06:22] faithful you're so good listen you can
[2:06:26] hardly get around a month ago you were
[2:06:29] having to hold you hold your leg back
[2:06:31] here and preach just stand up but huh
[2:06:33] he's
[2:06:34] he's good his faithfulness and his
[2:06:38] goodness to have nothing to do with it
[2:06:40] that I'm in pain it has everything to do
[2:06:43] with who he is you understand this is
[2:06:46] what glory in infirmities even though in
[2:06:49] Furman's these things it comes against
[2:06:51] us and man it really tries to take a
[2:06:53] toll on our life it wants to make us
[2:06:55] feel this sometimes you know when you
[2:06:56] don't feel good you become more
[2:06:57] irritable and the church said Amen and
[2:07:01] become more short but then in the midst
[2:07:06] of it when something can raise within
[2:07:08] you say Lord you're so good you might be
[2:07:13] crying and your tears may not beating
[2:07:15] but because of what you're thinking
[2:07:16] about it might be the pain you're in
[2:07:17] what you're saying Lord you're good just
[2:07:22] hear the power of the power of Christ or
[2:07:25] the joy he just puts the tent down and
[2:07:27] says let's have a meeting it just puts
[2:07:31] that tent down right there and there's a
[2:07:33] meeting going on right inside the little
[2:07:36] room I mean the tent Oh Lord could the
[2:07:39] third pole be that simple it is setting
[2:07:44] his tent upon our lives
[2:07:52] Paul had borne so much persecutions so
[2:07:56] many things of Christ to win that
[2:07:58] runaway slave runaway Paul said and he
[2:08:01] wrote back to his master after the slave
[2:08:04] had been converted he said don't treat
[2:08:08] him as a slave anymore
[2:08:10] treat him as a brother said if he owes
[2:08:14] you anything charge it to me when I come
[2:08:19] I'll pay you he had been solid
[2:08:23] fellowship with Christ in his sufferings
[2:08:26] till he know what it was to be an
[2:08:29] outcast he said do you know what it is
[2:08:34] to be an outcast
[2:08:35] okay so he knowed what it was to
[2:08:37] fellowship in his suffering so he knowed
[2:08:41] how to sympathize
[2:08:43] my father's it's just clothes I can't go
[2:08:49] any further were the persecutions were
[2:08:55] the testings were the trying's were they
[2:08:58] easy no they're not easy for you and me
[2:09:05] you could look at things this brother or
[2:09:08] this sister but really remember trials
[2:09:11] trials are not oopss oops
[2:09:15] the predestinated appointments for the
[2:09:20] molding of our character and in the
[2:09:25] molding of our character for the jury it
[2:09:26] brings more sympathy more empathy out of
[2:09:31] our lives
[2:09:31] it helps us you know by the way we want
[2:09:34] to be sensitive to people but sometimes
[2:09:37] what it is is that God knows how to
[2:09:39] bring about tender-hearted miss
[2:09:44] sometimes we could sit down and say hey
[2:09:45] you need to be more tender-hearted but
[2:09:48] God says I know how to tender you aren't
[2:09:51] you glad glad he's let those things
[2:09:56] happen for you and for me the test the
[2:09:59] trials that you've been through for me
[2:10:01] the comfort that God has come and
[2:10:04] ministered to you that you might
[2:10:07] minister that same comfort to me I'll
[2:10:13] say lord help me to be a faithful
[2:10:17] Channel
[2:10:19] help me Lord to bear the persecutions
[2:10:22] the tests the trials help me Lord to
[2:10:24] receive your comfort you know you know
[2:10:26] how it is sometimes there's things
[2:10:38] sometimes you just don't know what to
[2:10:40] say to somebody I just be honest we the
[2:10:44] same as a pastor no one I don't I don't
[2:10:46] I don't go into anything I have a
[2:10:48] thought of what almost say unless
[2:10:49] there's something God puts on my heart
[2:10:50] and says here let's tell them this most
[2:10:53] of time it's done I don't buy the same
[2:10:56] and sometimes do you walk away and don't
[2:10:57] say anything
[2:10:57] yeah sometimes I just say it's listen
[2:11:00] cuz you know what the Lord knows what's
[2:11:03] needed sometimes people just need
[2:11:05] somebody to listen to him sometimes they
[2:11:11] don't need an answer they just need
[2:11:14] somebody to listen and as you're
[2:11:16] listening from the bowels of Mercy for
[2:11:21] the David's it's pouring out there's an
[2:11:25] atmosphere being created like was in
[2:11:27] that pasture where the bull is that
[2:11:28] where the bees were buzzing there's an
[2:11:31] atmosphere because you and I'm going to
[2:11:34] the Spirit of God our amateur creators
[2:11:38] and when we projected love think about
[2:11:43] this brother Chris when we projected
[2:11:44] love but the brand says it like this he
[2:11:48] says when love has been projected and
[2:11:51] it's come to the end of itself and it
[2:11:56] can do no more Sovereign Grace steps in
[2:12:03] and takes control and produces what love
[2:12:09] has called for Oh God
[2:12:15] I just feel so challenged I've felt
[2:12:18] challenged for weeks and months or a
[2:12:21] month and looking at this but the joy in
[2:12:24] his presence I'm more challenged I'm
[2:12:27] more challenging
[2:12:29] I want more the love of goddess who feel
[2:12:33] God help me to be more sense help me
[2:12:38] Lord help me not to get let to overlook
[2:12:40] but to be mindful of it I know for you
[2:12:45] or from me it may not be that we're
[2:12:47] we've got a text or call over by the
[2:12:48] church but what I'm just let the whole
[2:12:50] thing I believe the Holy Spirit is
[2:12:51] telling us be sensitive and recognize
[2:12:54] that there are things that God has
[2:12:57] brought you through that only the
[2:13:00] compassion that the Holy Spirit will
[2:13:01] take a hold of in your life can actually
[2:13:03] pray the prayer of faith for someone
[2:13:06] else don't you let Satan put your your
[2:13:10] position down you are a believer priest
[2:13:13] you hear me
[2:13:15] you're a believer priest you're part of
[2:13:17] a royal priesthood there's things that
[2:13:20] you have went through experiences it has
[2:13:24] not been for naught
[2:13:26] but it's been so that the Holy Spirit
[2:13:28] can move down and then move behind that
[2:13:31] experience and reach out to somebody
[2:13:33] else I think God for the body of Jesus
[2:13:38] Christ I think God for the Holy Ghost I
[2:13:42] thank God for sensitive arts is in Lord
[2:13:45] if there's any callus about Samuel rub
[2:13:49] it down Lord I don't want to be
[2:13:52] calloused I don't want to let things go
[2:13:54] unnoticed working on me lord help me to
[2:13:59] be tender hearted in the midst of a

[2:19:45] they can recognize this is more than
[2:19:47] something brought by human but it's the
[2:19:50] love of God that moves down and and
[2:19:52] would call to their heart and let them
[2:19:54] know that there's a better way that they
[2:19:57] don't have to live or even try to live
[2:19:59] that way but they can just give
[2:20:01] themselves to you and maybe in their
[2:20:03] heart right now lord it's just simply
[2:20:05] where they say Lord take me to the Lord
[2:20:08] I don't know how to walk the walk but
[2:20:11] Lord will you come and will you Lord God
[2:20:14] guide my footsteps Lord will you tender
[2:20:18] my heart Lord father the things that may
[2:20:21] be that in their heart they can know
[2:20:22] that they still love certain things but
[2:20:25] they would be mindful enough of your
[2:20:27] presence to say Lord would you just Lord
[2:20:29] move that love out of my life Oh God bet
[2:20:32] the love of god would move and he'll
[2:20:34] grow greater and push out Lord all the
[2:20:37] things of the world because Lord I want
[2:20:39] you Lord that atmosphere Lord that I
[2:20:41] sense
