[30:35] of his seed amen he'll not lose one
[30:39] and just as with you know i want you to
[30:41] think about it that even
[30:42] as brother branham would dramatize that
[30:44] of the mama eagle
[30:47] mama eagle knew what time to go
[30:49] searching
[30:51] she knew what time when it was time that
[30:54] that little eagle
[30:55] would be there god knew this was
[30:58] our time amen the holy spirit came and
[31:02] searched us out in this time we've we've
[31:05] not followed
[31:06] cunning device fables amen the message
[31:09] that god sent to us
[31:11] in this hour it has fit us like a glove
[31:15] amen this is the word of god that god
[31:18] has spoke for us we're we're not out of
[31:20] season we're in season
[31:22] amen to the world yeah we're we're out
[31:25] of season with the world but i'm glad
[31:26] about that
[31:27] i don't want to fit in with the world if
[31:29] we fit in with the world there's
[31:30] problems
[31:31] but in the wonderful we haven't had to
[31:33] make ourselves odd
[31:35] brother aaron we haven't made ourselves
[31:36] odd it's the word that has come to us
[31:39] that has brought the separation amen
[31:42] brother braham said the reason abraham
[31:44] separated from lot was
[31:46] because of the promise that he was
[31:48] holding
[31:49] amen so we're we might be oddballs to
[31:51] the world but we've not made ourselves
[31:53] odd
[31:54] amen it's his life in us
[31:57] that makes the difference amen we're
[32:00] just so thankful to be in the house of
[32:02] the lord once again
[32:03] and amen so glad to have uh brother
[32:06] jerry and sister mina here with us and
[32:09] i just was expressing to brother jerry i
[32:11] said um we're just
[32:13] we're just always happy as a as a church
[32:15] and as an assembly
[32:16] uh i know he's my brother but i don't
[32:20] say this because he's my brother
[32:22] i say it because i really appreciate the
[32:24] gift that's in his life
[32:26] and how that how that he allows the lord
[32:28] to use him
[32:29] i stood with him in in the foreign
[32:31] fields and watched when he's ministered
[32:33] there to young people
[32:35] ministered there to you know to older
[32:37] ones when we're able to be together in
[32:38] service like that
[32:40] and just watch how that god will come
[32:42] down and he just surrenders that gift
[32:44] and
[32:44] i really appreciate that with all my
[32:46] heart because as a church we're edified
[32:49] and when i when i i look for things when
[32:51] i pray and i look for brothers to
[32:54] to bring in and brothers to minister to
[32:56] us i'm not after names i'm not after
[32:59] see who we can get in here this i i
[33:02] don't i don't look for things that way
[33:04] i want to see where how is the church
[33:07] edified
[33:08] and so sometimes that's why you see
[33:10] ministry coming back and
[33:11] there's things that i can see and look
[33:13] at and because
[33:15] it's about i want to see the church
[33:17] edified
[33:18] if i looked at it and i you know the way
[33:20] i look at it if i took my
[33:22] my children to a doctor and that doctor
[33:24] didn't help him very much
[33:26] i'm not going back to that doctor just
[33:29] simply put
[33:30] i want i want my children to be helped
[33:32] and so i believe that that's how god
[33:34] feels about our lives
[33:36] amen and i just so i appreciate that and
[33:38] brother jerry lord willing will be here
[33:40] um ministering on thursday as well i

[41:34] to you life forever and
[41:42] forever i wonder what
[41:47] i could have done
[41:50] [Music]
[41:52] to deserve god's only
[41:57] son to fight
[42:00] my battles
[42:01] [Music]
[42:07] [Music]
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] am
[42:19] [Music]
[42:28] am i that he
[42:32] would pray not mine will thine lord
[42:44] [Music]
[42:57] to an old rugged cross
[43:01] he'd go for who
[43:04] am i
[43:09] or to
[43:14] [Music]
[43:17] who am i
[43:25] [Applause]
[43:29] amen praise the lord we're thankful to
[43:32] be here this morning
[43:33] amen just stand with me and we'll go to
[43:36] prayer before we
[43:38] turn to the scripture this morning
[43:42] heavenly father lord we come before you
[43:45] now at this time and we're asking
[43:47] for you to lord come and anoint us
[43:50] father with your spirit
[43:53] lord jesus we're just sinners saved by
[43:56] grace
[43:57] we're so thankful of your grace dear god
[44:00] lord we ask that you to anoint us this
[44:02] morning that
[44:03] to you would come and speak your words
[44:06] to the people dear god
[44:08] for we know that your words are life and
[44:10] they are eternal
[44:12] lord and that
[44:16] they would be a blessing and help to the
[44:18] people their god
[44:19] we pray and ask these things in the name
[44:22] of the lord jesus christ
[44:24] amen amen
[44:27] i'd like to read from romans chapter 5
[44:29] verses 3 and 4.
[44:47] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[44:51] also knowing that tribulations
[44:54] worketh patience and the word patience
[44:56] there in greek means endurance
[45:00] and endurance experience the word
[45:03] experience there in the greek means
[45:04] approved tried character
[45:08] and experience hope which is faith
[45:13] brother branham says in thirsting for
[45:14] life said life is a great thing
[45:18] life molds your character
[45:21] you maybe see that i'd like to minister
[45:24] take that for a
[45:25] text this morning life molds your
[45:27] character
[45:30] our character is molded by the things we
[45:33] go through
[45:33] in this life
[45:37] the trials that we face
[45:40] the tests that we go through
[45:44] they all mold our character
[45:48] now is the time for a character to be
[45:50] molded
[45:52] your character is not molded after the
[45:54] rapture
[45:55] it's molded before you go in the rapture
[45:58] because you got the right character
[46:02] amen the prophet said we should judge
[46:05] our character
[46:07] how we are now would tell us how we
[46:10] would be
[46:11] in the days of moses
[46:15] how that we react to the word today
[46:18] we would have reacted to the word in
[46:20] that day
[46:22] moses was criticized
[46:27] by many in that day many that were
[46:29] supposed to be his brethren
[46:31] criticized him
[46:34] are we critical
[46:38] you see we can judge how we would be
[46:40] then
[46:46] god told moses said separate yourself
[46:48] from them i'm going to swallow them up
[46:51] because of their character
[46:55] but you know moses said
[47:00] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[47:03] a prophet from out of your midst like
[47:06] unto me
[47:08] in other words he would be of the same
[47:10] character
[47:11] that moses was
[47:15] remember when they spoke to jesus
[47:19] they said we know moses
[47:23] he said if you'd known moses you would
[47:24] have known me
[47:29] because moses spoke of me
[47:33] if they'd have known the character of
[47:35] moses they would recognize that
[47:37] character
[47:38] in jesus christ it was a godly character
[47:42] brother branham says
[47:43] i believe that your character identifies
[47:46] you
[47:48] in that same message right after he says
[47:51] that he's praying
[47:52] and he says father god come tonight i
[47:54] pray and help us
[47:55] help our unbelief forgive us our
[47:57] shortcomings
[48:00] so you're having the right character
[48:03] doesn't mean you're not going to make
[48:04] mistakes in this life
[48:07] it doesn't mean that you're not going to
[48:10] fail from time to time
[48:12] it doesn't mean that you're not going to
[48:13] have faults
[48:15] because we're not perfect yet
[48:19] that's one of the things that i believe
[48:21] satan comes and
[48:22] really tries to beat us up over is any
[48:25] time we make a mistake any time we fail
[48:28] anytime we slip up while he comes and
[48:31] tries to point a finger at us
[48:34] but remember when the tax man
[48:38] was after brother branham
[48:41] and brother branham said told me when he
[48:44] called
[48:45] said tell him i'm not in here and he
[48:48] stepped out the door
[48:49] technically he was not in there
[48:53] but the holy spirit told him he lied
[48:57] now watch his character his character
[49:00] was
[49:01] that no matter what it was going to cost
[49:03] him he called back up the irs man
[49:06] and told him i lied i had my wife
[49:10] telling you i wasn't in there and i was
[49:12] there
[49:14] so that showed his character now
[49:18] he lied but his character showed
[49:22] and that he made it right you may make a
[49:26] mistake
[49:27] you may do something wrong but
[49:30] the real character of christ is you'll
[49:33] make it right
[49:35] as soon as it's pointed out to you as
[49:37] soon as you become aware of you'll say
[49:40] father i'm sorry i didn't mean to do
[49:41] that please forgive me
[49:50] we're
[49:54] we're not going to take a special course
[49:58] when after the rapture in order to get
[50:00] our character right for the millennium
[50:04] brother branham said in future home
[50:08] he said it's a transplanting it takes
[50:10] what's here
[50:11] and he puts it there so all of your
[50:14] molding all of your changing and all
[50:17] that
[50:17] it has to go on now
[50:22] he said if god could take elijah and
[50:25] raise him up after
[50:26] 2 500 years and transplant him back on
[50:29] the earth
[50:30] to to show up there on mount
[50:33] transfiguration
[50:35] then he could do it again with the bride
[50:41] he's seriously in redemption by the by
[50:43] judgment
[50:44] i just want to point out these things
[50:46] maybe you're very familiar with them
[50:48] but if you're not then this will make
[50:51] you familiar with them
[50:52] he said when jesus comes again with his
[50:54] bride to reign on the throne of david
[50:56] his father in the millennium he'll come
[50:59] with her
[50:59] then as king and queen so
[51:03] you're not going to take a special
[51:06] tutoring on how to be
[51:08] the queen once the rapture takes place
[51:12] you're getting that tutoring now
[51:16] you're finding out how to rain now you
[51:19] say how am i doing that
[51:20] i'm not reigning over anyone yes you are
[51:24] you start out by reigning over yourself
[51:30] you start out by reigning over this
[51:32] flesh
[51:34] how do you think you're going to reign
[51:35] over flesh likeness if you can't reign
[51:37] over flesh like this now
[51:43] he says everything in the bible
[51:47] is in trinity you're a trinity
[51:52] body spirit and soul
[51:55] you have a trinity a kitchen a living
[51:57] room a bedroom
[51:59] he said you may have eight different
[52:02] rooms but the bedroom
[52:04] but the only three you're living in
[52:07] and we find out the coming of christ is
[52:09] in a trinity he comes first to redeem
[52:11] his bride
[52:12] he comes next to receive his bride he
[52:15] comes next with this bride as
[52:17] king and queen to reign through the
[52:18] millennium
[52:20] everything's in a tremendo trinity we
[52:22] have a mortal body
[52:24] a celestial body a glorified body
[52:28] three stages brings us back to our
[52:30] perfection again
[52:32] like in eden
[52:36] he says in questions and answers he says
[52:38] now the next thing
[52:39] is the translation of the church and
[52:41] then the return
[52:43] of moses and elijah the millennium reign
[52:46] upon the earth with the bride and groom
[52:47] for a thousand years
[52:49] and then the judgment bar and then total
[52:52] annihilation of sin
[52:54] it'll never be no more at that time now
[52:57] the seals never ended time
[53:00] time or seasons until after the
[53:02] millennium
[53:04] it still be time until after the
[53:06] millennium
[53:13] he was asked a question said does the
[53:14] millennium have to do
[53:16] uh with the have to do with the 1000
[53:19] years
[53:21] he says they lived and reigned with
[53:23] christ 1000 years
[53:25] it will be 1 000 years upon the earth
[53:28] because 1 000 years upon the earth
[53:30] is only counted a time for a parable
[53:33] like god as one day
[53:35] 1 000 years upon the earth there's only
[53:37] one day with god
[53:38] as god counting time so
[53:42] it's the sabbath day when the church
[53:44] will no more labor against sin
[53:47] and satan is bound for a little season a
[53:49] thousand years
[53:51] because all his subjects are in hell
[53:54] and the church that's on the earth is
[53:56] redeemed in the
[53:58] right in the presence of christ so he
[54:00] has nothing he can work through
[54:03] so it's not a chain as i said it's a log
[54:06] chain it's a chain of circumstance
[54:10] you know what the chain of circumstances
[54:12] he's saying first of all
[54:14] all of satan's subjects are in hell
[54:16] second of all
[54:17] you're in a glorified body that can't be
[54:21] affected by sin
[54:22] that can't be affected by sickness that
[54:25] can't be affected by
[54:26] death he's bound by circumstance
[54:33] he's helpless and hopeless just waiting
[54:36] for the resurrection
[54:38] of his subjects
[54:46] he says again in question answers you
[54:48] asked the question the church age ending
[54:50] and has blacked out the bride is called
[54:52] we have already entered in
[54:54] have we already entered into tribulation
[54:56] periods no no no
[54:58] i wish i could just have more time on
[55:00] that the bride when she's taken
[55:03] from the church then the church age will
[55:05] cease
[55:06] laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes
[55:09] to glory and the tribulation period sets
[55:11] in upon the sleeping virgin for three
[55:14] and a half years
[55:16] while israel is getting its prophecy
[55:18] then tribulation sets in
[55:20] upon israel then comes the battle of
[55:23] armageddon
[55:24] which destroys all things then the bride
[55:27] returns back with the groom for a
[55:28] thousand years the millennial reign
[55:30] after that comes the white throne
[55:32] judgment after that comes the new
[55:34] heavens and new earth
[55:36] and the new city coming down out from
[55:38] god out of heaven
[55:39] eternity and time blends together so you
[55:42] see
[55:43] the timeline of events the rapture takes
[55:47] place
[55:47] that's the translation of the church
[55:50] then
[55:51] then the two prophets appear in israel
[55:55] and the tribulation period sets in upon
[55:58] the earth upon the foolish virgin
[56:00] and then comes the end of that time
[56:04] and then comes the battle of armageddon
[56:07] when
[56:07] we come riding down out of heaven with
[56:10] christ
[56:12] and then then the millennial rain sets
[56:15] in
[56:16] for a thousand years at the end of the
[56:18] millennial reign is the white throne
[56:20] judgment
[56:22] and it says that that
[56:25] after the battle of armageddon that the
[56:27] dead lived not
[56:28] until the thousand-year reign be
[56:30] completed
[56:32] then at the end of the thousand year
[56:33] reign the sea
[56:35] and the earth and everything will give
[56:37] up its dead and all will come before the
[56:39] judgment seat
[56:40] of god except for the bride who's
[56:43] already in the throne
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:48] and then after the judgment then
[56:52] satan is thrown into the pit where the
[56:55] false prophet and beast
[56:57] and then sin is annihilated
[57:02] then we ascend back up into heaven and
[57:04] the earth and the heavens is burnt over
[57:06] with fire and then there's a new heavens
[57:09] and a new earth
[57:11] and then the holy city of jerusalem
[57:13] comes and sets back down
[57:14] upon the earth now nowhere in that
[57:18] timeline is there time for you to get
[57:20] your character molded
[57:24] when we come on the scene in the time of
[57:26] the millennium with christ to reign
[57:28] as king and queen we've got to be
[57:31] already ready and fit to reign
[57:35] when we leave here in the rapture we're
[57:38] already fit to reign
[57:42] so that's why you go through your trials
[57:44] now
[57:45] that's why you face your difficulties
[57:47] now
[57:48] that's why you're tested and tried now
[57:51] that's why you suffer
[57:52] temptations now it's because this
[57:56] is the time that life is molding
[57:59] your character
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:04] now in the book of revelations chapter 2
[58:09] verse 8 it says unto the angel the
[58:12] church of sumerian right these things
[58:14] saith the first and the last
[58:16] which was dead and and is alive i know
[58:19] thy works
[58:20] and tribulation and poverty
[58:24] but thou art rich and i have known the
[58:26] blasphemy of them which say
[58:28] they are jews and are not but are
[58:32] the synagogue of satan fear
[58:35] none of those things which thou shalt
[58:37] suffer
[58:39] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[58:41] into prison
[58:42] that ye may be tried and ye shall have
[58:45] tribulation ten days
[58:47] be thou faithful unto death and i will
[58:50] give thee a crown of life
[58:58] every age goes through tribulations and
[59:04] it's not the same
[59:05] for every age times change
[59:09] satan changes but god doesn't change
[59:14] because god delivers us out of them all
[59:19] but as the times change and satan
[59:21] changes his tactics a little bit
[59:24] trying to do like he did job trying to
[59:27] push you
[59:28] until you would curse god that's what he
[59:31] tried
[59:32] with job he said i'll get him to curse
[59:34] you to your face
[59:35] i'll keep pushing him until he's had all
[59:38] he can take
[59:42] but i want you to know something he
[59:45] god said my grace is sufficient for you
[59:51] amen we've learned that all we need is
[59:54] to find grace
[59:56] amen so every age suffers
[1:00:00] its tribulation and
[1:00:03] paul says in hebrews chapter 10
[1:00:06] verse 32 said but called to remembrance
[1:00:10] the former days in which after ye were
[1:00:12] illuminated you endured
[1:00:14] a great flight fight rather of
[1:00:16] afflictions
[1:00:18] partly once you were made gazing stocks
[1:00:21] both by reproaches and afflictions and
[1:00:23] partly whilst ye became
[1:00:25] companions to them that were so used
[1:00:29] for ye had compassion of me and my bonds
[1:00:32] and took joyfully the spoils of your
[1:00:34] goods knowing in yourselves
[1:00:36] that ye have in heaven a better and
[1:00:38] enduring substance
[1:00:40] cast not away there for your confidence
[1:00:44] which has great recompense of rewards in
[1:00:46] other words
[1:00:47] don't cast away your confidence because
[1:00:49] you're going through trusts
[1:00:51] and trials don't cast away your
[1:00:53] confidence in other words
[1:00:55] when you start going through things
[1:00:56] maybe facing death in the family
[1:00:59] or whatever it may be you know don't
[1:01:01] start questioning well does god really
[1:01:03] love me
[1:01:04] if god really loved me i wouldn't be
[1:01:06] going through this
[1:01:08] i've heard people question god that way
[1:01:11] does
[1:01:12] does god not love us it has nothing to
[1:01:15] do with the love of god
[1:01:17] [Applause]
[1:01:20] god is molding you
[1:01:24] you're going to face tribulations
[1:01:30] so don't cast away your confidence
[1:01:32] because you're going through them
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:35] for ye have need of patience i think we
[1:01:38] mentioned this thursday night
[1:01:40] for you have need of patience that after
[1:01:42] you've done the will of god you might
[1:01:44] receive the promise
[1:01:46] so after you've done what was required
[1:01:49] of you to do
[1:01:50] then have patience
[1:01:54] deliverance will come
[1:01:58] freedom will come just have patience
[1:02:02] the blessings are on their way
[1:02:06] the blessings are just on the other side
[1:02:08] of the tribulations
[1:02:10] listen friends i would rather face my
[1:02:12] tribulations
[1:02:13] now than to be here during the three and
[1:02:17] a half years and face those tribulations
[1:02:25] for yet a little while and and he that
[1:02:28] shall come will come
[1:02:29] and will not tarry now the just shall
[1:02:32] live by faith but if any man draw back
[1:02:34] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:02:36] now he says partly why she became
[1:02:40] companions
[1:02:41] of them that were so used and brother
[1:02:43] branham says in the smyrna church age he
[1:02:45] says
[1:02:46] based on that he says the mere
[1:02:48] association
[1:02:50] of kind-hearted people with the true
[1:02:52] believer might well bring
[1:02:54] death in return for their kindness
[1:02:58] now i remember brother branham speaking
[1:03:01] about
[1:03:01] there would be those that would receive
[1:03:04] eternal life in the time of the white
[1:03:06] throne judgment because
[1:03:07] they were good to the bride
[1:03:11] not because they knew the truth and
[1:03:14] thought well i can't walk in that way
[1:03:16] but if i'm kind to somebody i'll make it
[1:03:19] no they didn't know the truth
[1:03:24] and yet they were being kind
[1:03:27] yet they were doing great things for you
[1:03:33] we had a man became a friend of mine
[1:03:38] and here back in may he was murdered
[1:03:41] and he became a friend of mine and he
[1:03:43] did work on our church
[1:03:45] put a new roof on our church and and
[1:03:47] didn't charge us
[1:03:48] over a mount for it and he went above
[1:03:51] and beyond
[1:03:53] he made the rafters look like the
[1:03:56] original rafters on the church you know
[1:03:59] because the church
[1:04:00] he said was a historical site and so he
[1:04:03] made him look just like that he spent
[1:04:06] extra time
[1:04:07] and designed the roof on the back of our
[1:04:10] church and
[1:04:11] and then he came and he put a roof on my
[1:04:15] house
[1:04:16] built me a roof over my deck he put
[1:04:19] flooring down in my house
[1:04:21] he built closets in my house he
[1:04:24] put new trim work up and he did all
[1:04:27] these things you know and he went above
[1:04:28] and beyond doing all these things and
[1:04:31] and he was just uh real kind to us as a
[1:04:35] as believers and as a church he didn't
[1:04:38] go to church himself
[1:04:40] he didn't see anything but
[1:04:44] uh then may the 8th i believe it was
[1:04:50] he was he was murdered
[1:04:53] and uh you know i thought
[1:04:57] he did everything he did without knowing
[1:05:00] the truth
[1:05:02] and i thought maybe perhaps on that day
[1:05:05] it'll be taking into consideration what
[1:05:07] all he done for
[1:05:08] our church and for me
[1:05:16] but god says here when he's speaking to
[1:05:20] the sumerian church he says
[1:05:22] i know your tribulations
[1:05:25] but does he hold back the tribulations
[1:05:28] does he hold back the persecutions
[1:05:30] no he simply says i know of them
[1:05:35] and he says i'm not unmindful of your
[1:05:37] suffering
[1:05:39] brother brahm said this puts a stumbling
[1:05:41] block before many people
[1:05:44] because they say how could god be just
[1:05:47] and loving and just stand by and watch
[1:05:49] his people suffer
[1:05:52] the bible israel
[1:05:56] questioned god in this way in malachi 1.
[1:06:01] and it said and god answered back to
[1:06:04] them said
[1:06:04] i have loved you saith the lord yet you
[1:06:08] say wherein hast thou
[1:06:09] loved us was not esau jacob's brother
[1:06:13] saith the lord yet i loved jacob and i
[1:06:15] hated esau
[1:06:16] and laid his mountains in his heritage
[1:06:18] to waste for the dragons of the
[1:06:20] wilderness
[1:06:22] but did that mean that jacob didn't face
[1:06:24] trials
[1:06:26] did that mean jacob didn't face some
[1:06:28] hard times
[1:06:30] did that mean jacob wasn't misused
[1:06:33] and done wrong no
[1:06:41] brother branham says you see they could
[1:06:43] not figure out
[1:06:44] god's love they thought god's love meant
[1:06:46] no suffering
[1:06:48] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:06:50] parental care
[1:06:52] and god said that his love was elective
[1:06:55] the proof of his love is election
[1:06:57] no matter what happened his love was
[1:07:00] proven truly by the fact they were
[1:07:02] chosen under salvation
[1:07:04] because god had chosen you to salvation
[1:07:07] through sanctification of the spirit
[1:07:09] and belief of the truth he may commit
[1:07:13] you to death
[1:07:14] as he did paul he may commit your
[1:07:15] suffering as he did jacob
[1:07:18] that's his prerogative he's sovereign
[1:07:21] but it's
[1:07:22] all with a purpose
[1:07:25] everything you go through is with the
[1:07:27] purpose
[1:07:30] god has a reason for it he's not just
[1:07:33] you know
[1:07:34] letting things happen he doesn't know
[1:07:35] what's going on with you and you know he
[1:07:37] has to
[1:07:38] be made aware of it no he's aware of it
[1:07:41] and he lets it because he's serving a
[1:07:43] purpose
[1:07:46] when you look back over your life and
[1:07:49] look through some of the hard things
[1:07:50] you've come through
[1:07:52] and then you look where you are now and
[1:07:54] you see there was a change
[1:07:56] that happened in you because of what you
[1:07:59] went through
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:01] your faith grew it changed you
[1:08:04] your outlook changed your view of things
[1:08:08] changed
[1:08:08] perhaps your compassion changed
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:14] where you were able to be more
[1:08:15] compassionate to others
[1:08:21] instead of sitting there and watching
[1:08:22] somebody else go through and say boy i'm
[1:08:24] glad it's them and not me
[1:08:29] you're more compassionate
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:37] it's with a purpose he if he did not
[1:08:39] have a purpose then he would be the
[1:08:41] author of
[1:08:42] frustration and not of peace his purpose
[1:08:45] is that after we have suffered a while
[1:08:48] we would be made perfect be established
[1:08:50] strengthened
[1:08:51] and settled as job said
[1:08:54] he put strength in us
[1:08:58] we went through that on thirsty he put
[1:09:01] strength
[1:09:02] in us when i'm weak then i am strong
[1:09:06] amen you see
[1:09:09] he himself suffered talking about christ
[1:09:13] now
[1:09:14] he learned obedience by the things that
[1:09:16] he suffered
[1:09:18] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:09:20] things that he suffered
[1:09:23] in hebrews he's referring to hebrews 5
[1:09:28] and 8-9 where it says though he were a
[1:09:30] son
[1:09:31] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:09:34] which he suffered
[1:09:35] and being made perfect he became the
[1:09:38] author of eternal salvation unto all
[1:09:40] them that obey him
[1:09:42] he's brother branham says here again in
[1:09:44] plain language
[1:09:46] the very character of jesus was
[1:09:49] perfected
[1:09:50] by suffering
[1:09:54] if suffering perfected the character of
[1:09:56] jesus
[1:09:57] then how do we think ours our character
[1:10:00] is going to get perfected
[1:10:01] unless we go through some suffering
[1:10:10] and according to paul he has left his
[1:10:12] church a measure of suffering
[1:10:14] that they too by their faith in god
[1:10:17] while suffering for him
[1:10:18] would come to a place of perfection
[1:10:25] paul says in romans 8 and if children
[1:10:28] then heirs of god and joint heirs with
[1:10:30] christ if so be that we
[1:10:32] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:10:35] glorified together
[1:10:37] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[1:10:39] present time
[1:10:41] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:10:43] glory which shall be revealed in
[1:10:45] us
[1:10:48] compared to what we're going to compared
[1:10:52] to what we're going to have
[1:10:54] the suffering is nothing it only lasts
[1:10:56] for a season anyway
[1:11:02] it doesn't even last for a thousand
[1:11:03] years
[1:11:08] it lasts for your lifetime here and
[1:11:09] that's the end of it
[1:11:11] it's over then that's why
[1:11:15] we're looking forward to the ending of
[1:11:17] this life
[1:11:19] you know i i said to my mother
[1:11:22] yesterday i believe it was i don't
[1:11:25] remember how i got on the subject but i
[1:11:27] said
[1:11:28] what about people who
[1:11:31] don't have a belief
[1:11:35] of something after this what if all they
[1:11:39] think they have is this life only
[1:11:46] we were we were talking about my father
[1:11:48] and we were thinking about him and where
[1:11:50] he is
[1:11:51] and i was saying you know i had mixed
[1:11:53] emotions about the new house because
[1:11:56] my dad never even got to enjoy it i says
[1:11:59] but you know my mom doesn't have any
[1:12:01] memories of him there
[1:12:03] and and i said but he wouldn't want to
[1:12:06] come back here from where he's at
[1:12:10] and i said but what about people who
[1:12:12] don't believe in that
[1:12:17] where they think this life is the end of
[1:12:19] and i said no wonder
[1:12:21] many of them live the way they live
[1:12:24] because they're living this life like
[1:12:26] this is all they've got
[1:12:29] man i'm so glad this isn't all i've got
[1:12:33] i'm looking forward to the ending of
[1:12:35] this life
[1:12:36] but people that they don't want to see
[1:12:38] the ending of this life
[1:12:40] they want to hang on to it because
[1:12:43] they've got nothing to look forward to
[1:12:46] and the reason they have nothing to look
[1:12:48] forward to is because there's nothing in
[1:12:50] there for the word to speak to
[1:12:52] there's no seed there to respond to the
[1:12:55] word
[1:13:00] so all they've got ahead of them is
[1:13:02] judgment
[1:13:06] i'm glad that when you receive eternal
[1:13:09] life
[1:13:10] you've passed from death and to life
[1:13:13] you've
[1:13:13] passed from the judgment amen
[1:13:17] not to come ever into the judgment we're
[1:13:20] being judged now
[1:13:22] brother branham says judgment starts at
[1:13:24] the house of god
[1:13:26] we're being judged we come here and
[1:13:29] judge
[1:13:29] ourselves now by the word that comes
[1:13:33] forth
[1:13:34] hallelujah
[1:13:38] james says my brother encountered all
[1:13:40] joy when you fall into divers
[1:13:42] temptations
[1:13:43] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:13:45] faith worketh patience
[1:13:48] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:13:51] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:13:53] wanting nothing so faith worketh
[1:13:56] endurance and the bible tells us
[1:14:00] those that endure to the end shall be
[1:14:03] saved
[1:14:04] not those that give up part way along
[1:14:07] the way
[1:14:09] when i was in the army and especially in
[1:14:12] germany
[1:14:13] and every friday we would go on a 10
[1:14:16] mile run
[1:14:17] and our uh platoon sergeant called it
[1:14:20] tour the town
[1:14:22] because we ran around the whole town of
[1:14:23] gelnhausen
[1:14:25] and come back to the to the post you
[1:14:27] know
[1:14:28] and uh i would watch we uh
[1:14:31] our barracks was on top of the hill
[1:14:34] there
[1:14:35] and we had to run down the hill uh
[1:14:38] down to get to where the street was and
[1:14:42] i would watch there'd be people same
[1:14:45] ones always
[1:14:46] fall out by the time they got to the
[1:14:47] bottom of the hill
[1:14:50] and start their walk back up the hill to
[1:14:52] go on back up to the barracks
[1:14:55] and then there'd be some that would wait
[1:14:56] until we actually
[1:14:58] got down on the street and got a little
[1:15:00] further on down where they thought
[1:15:02] nobody would look and then they'd fall
[1:15:03] out and walk
[1:15:04] back to the post
[1:15:07] but you know what they felt
[1:15:11] they thought they nobody will know what
[1:15:14] they
[1:15:14] they failed to realize i guess maybe
[1:15:16] because they always done this
[1:15:18] that we formed back up into formation
[1:15:20] after we got back
[1:15:22] and so the platoon sergeant was able to
[1:15:24] look over and see
[1:15:25] who endured the run
[1:15:31] and only those that endured the run got
[1:15:34] his favor
[1:15:40] we can't fall out now
[1:15:43] if the going might get rough it might
[1:15:46] get hard
[1:15:48] but we've come a long way
[1:15:51] we've already come a long way we've
[1:15:53] already come through a lot of rough now
[1:15:55] i know
[1:15:56] some of you you're young and you're
[1:15:57] thinking well i feel like i've just got
[1:15:58] started
[1:16:03] well think of it this way the 11th hour
[1:16:06] worker gets the same page
[1:16:09] so if you've just started your run your
[1:16:11] race
[1:16:12] in this race it's okay you're going to
[1:16:14] win the same prize
[1:16:16] just stay with it
[1:16:25] now
[1:16:33] why why does he stand by and let the
[1:16:36] suffering go on
[1:16:39] this is why unless we suffer with him we
[1:16:44] cannot reign with him
[1:16:47] you have to suffer the rain
[1:16:50] listen to this the reason for this is
[1:16:53] character
[1:16:53] simply is never made without
[1:16:57] suffering
[1:17:01] the character of christ is what he's
[1:17:03] talking about
[1:17:06] not the character of this world
[1:17:09] but the character of christ to have that
[1:17:12] character
[1:17:13] it's you don't get it without suffering
[1:17:16] he suffered and it perfected his
[1:17:19] character
[1:17:21] if jesus character needed perfecting
[1:17:24] then so does ours
[1:17:28] and he goes on he says character is a
[1:17:31] victory not a gift
[1:17:33] now the holy ghost is a gift salvation
[1:17:37] is a gift you don't do anything to earn
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:41] but character you're going to have to
[1:17:44] overcome
[1:17:45] things for you to be considered an
[1:17:48] overcomer
[1:17:49] as the bible says that he would grant
[1:17:51] with the overcomer
[1:17:52] to sit with him in his father's throne
[1:17:55] in order to be an overcomer
[1:17:56] you've got to overcome something brother
[1:17:59] branham says he doesn't
[1:18:01] pull you up through a pipe and you come
[1:18:04] out the other side and say
[1:18:05] i'm an overcomer you wouldn't have
[1:18:08] overcome
[1:18:08] anything but he allows you to face
[1:18:11] things and go
[1:18:12] through things and they're hard
[1:18:15] but paul tells us he'll not put on you
[1:18:18] anything that you're
[1:18:19] not able to bear and you might come
[1:18:23] through times where you think
[1:18:24] i think i'm reaching my end i don't know
[1:18:28] if i can go any further but you will
[1:18:31] because there's something in you that
[1:18:34] won't
[1:18:38] quit when i would go on that run in
[1:18:41] germany do you think
[1:18:42] my legs didn't burn at times you think
[1:18:45] that it did they didn't hurt at times
[1:18:47] they did
[1:18:48] but i pushed on because i wasn't a
[1:18:51] quitter
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:53] we're not quitters we're not going to
[1:18:56] quit
[1:18:56] we're going to keep pushing on why
[1:18:59] because there's something
[1:19:00] in us
[1:19:06] i pushed on because i was a soldier
[1:19:09] first of all we
[1:19:13] push on because we are soldiers
[1:19:16] of the cross
[1:19:30] that song says he never promised that
[1:19:33] the cross would not get heavy
[1:19:35] and the hill would not be hard to climb
[1:19:38] hallelujah he never promised
[1:19:43] victory without fighting but he said
[1:19:46] help would always come in time
[1:19:49] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:19:56] a man without character can't reign
[1:19:59] because power apart from character is
[1:20:01] satanic
[1:20:03] remember when satan took jesus upon the
[1:20:06] the pinnacle and he said cast yourself
[1:20:08] down
[1:20:10] and then he told him said look at all
[1:20:11] the kingdoms of the world if you'll bow
[1:20:13] down and worship me i'll give them to
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:19] jesus replied back with the word i shall
[1:20:22] worship the lord thy god only
[1:20:26] but see he
[1:20:29] could not take the kingdoms without
[1:20:31] suffering
[1:20:33] he couldn't take because that would have
[1:20:35] been satanic
[1:20:39] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:20:43] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:20:45] throne
[1:20:46] on the same basis that he overcome and
[1:20:49] is set down in his father's throne
[1:20:51] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:20:54] and the little temporary suffering
[1:20:58] we go through now is not worthy to be
[1:21:00] compared
[1:21:01] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:21:03] revealed in us when he comes
[1:21:06] oh what treasures are light up for those
[1:21:10] who are willing to enter into his
[1:21:12] kingdom through much
[1:21:14] tribulation it's temporary suffering
[1:21:17] temporary tribulations
[1:21:21] hallelujah
[1:21:24] remember he knows what you're going
[1:21:28] through
[1:21:30] he was tested and tempted
[1:21:34] in every way such as knowing to man
[1:21:41] so he knows what you're going through
[1:21:43] he's been in this kind of flesh
[1:21:47] he's felt the temptations of this flesh
[1:21:50] he's felt the sufferings
[1:21:52] of this kind of flesh
[1:22:01] so the prophet says
[1:22:04] he reproves with long long suffering and
[1:22:06] gentleness and mercy
[1:22:08] and he chastens with nail scarred hands
[1:22:11] he knows your suffering he suffered
[1:22:14] amen paul says in hebrews
[1:22:18] chapter 12 and ye have forgotten the
[1:22:21] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:22:23] children my son despise
[1:22:25] not thou the chastening of the lord nor
[1:22:27] faint when thou art rebuked of him
[1:22:30] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:22:32] and scourges
[1:22:33] every son whom he receiveth if ye endure
[1:22:37] chastening
[1:22:38] god dealeth with you as sons for what
[1:22:41] son
[1:22:42] is he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:22:45] but if ye be without chastisement
[1:22:47] whereof all are partakers
[1:22:49] then you are bastards and not sons
[1:22:52] furthermore
[1:22:53] we have fathers of our flesh which
[1:22:55] corrected us and gave us
[1:22:56] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[1:22:59] much
[1:23:00] rather be in subjection unto the father
[1:23:02] spirits and live
[1:23:04] for they verily for a few days chastened
[1:23:06] us after their own pleasure but he
[1:23:09] for our prophet that we might be
[1:23:11] partakers of his holiness
[1:23:14] now no chastening for the present
[1:23:17] seemeth to be joyous
[1:23:20] but grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:23:23] yieldeth the peaceful fruit
[1:23:25] of righteousness unto them which are
[1:23:27] exercised thereby
[1:23:35] brother branham was praying and the
[1:23:36] message of our hope is in god
[1:23:41] and as he was praying he said and thy
[1:23:44] children many are weary and worn
[1:23:48] been pushed about all for their own good
[1:23:52] their teaching their child training to
[1:23:55] bring them up in the admiration of
[1:23:57] the lord trials worth more than
[1:24:00] silver or gold but as it's written no
[1:24:03] chastisement is pleasant
[1:24:05] for the time being but finally when thy
[1:24:08] church
[1:24:08] comes to have its training then they
[1:24:12] will be placed as sons
[1:24:14] in into the inherit of
[1:24:17] god which shall inherit all things and
[1:24:20] be equal in powers and blessings
[1:24:22] as the son of god brothers to him
[1:24:27] look what all he went through
[1:24:31] and we know he experienced hunger we
[1:24:33] know he experienced weakness we know he
[1:24:35] experienced tiredness
[1:24:38] but he was tested too and tempted then
[1:24:41] came down
[1:24:42] to the time of suffering
[1:24:47] where they
[1:24:50] took and beat him with a whip
[1:24:53] a cat of nine tails
[1:24:56] which if you don't know what that is
[1:24:58] it's they take
[1:25:00] and on the splayed out ends of the of
[1:25:02] the whip
[1:25:03] they put uh like
[1:25:06] sharp razor blade almost like material
[1:25:10] that will rip the flesh every time the
[1:25:12] whip hits him
[1:25:18] and a crown of thorns placed on his head
[1:25:21] not gently
[1:25:25] his beard plucked
[1:25:31] they would hit him and say
[1:25:34] prophesy and tell us who hit you
[1:25:41] and you know what the
[1:25:45] outstanding part of it is
[1:25:48] he took it all in silence
[1:25:59] he never complained
[1:26:02] he never screamed out at them
[1:26:06] he took the suffering
[1:26:10] friends he was not unaware
[1:26:13] of the suffering he was going to go
[1:26:15] through beforehand
[1:26:17] that's why he prayed in the garden and
[1:26:20] said if it be possible
[1:26:22] let this cup pass from me nevertheless
[1:26:26] not my will but thine be done
[1:26:31] he knew the suffering he was going to
[1:26:33] face he even told the disciples and he
[1:26:36] says i'll be forsaken by all
[1:26:38] remember peter said i'll not forsake you
[1:26:42] he said yes peter even you will forsake
[1:26:44] me
[1:26:46] before the has crowed you will have
[1:26:49] denied me three times
[1:26:59] i'm thankful he finished the course
[1:27:02] i'm thankful he took it
[1:27:09] the king of glory came down to be
[1:27:11] tabernacled in men
[1:27:14] not as in the form of an angel but
[1:27:17] is in a form such as we have
[1:27:21] he left the ivory palaces
[1:27:24] came down to be one of us
[1:27:27] he became me so that i might become
[1:27:32] him hallelujah
[1:27:35] hallelujah
[1:27:44] you know when you become new converts
[1:27:48] as soon as you come to christ
[1:27:53] something's going to happen
[1:27:57] you're going to start facing things
[1:28:01] things are going to start happening to
[1:28:04] try you
[1:28:06] to try your faith
[1:28:10] and it's it's not god trying you to see
[1:28:13] are they going to take it and make it
[1:28:15] it's proving it to yourself
[1:28:20] because if you were told when you came
[1:28:23] to christ
[1:28:24] you're going to face this test you're
[1:28:26] going to face this trial
[1:28:27] you're going to go through this you're
[1:28:29] going to face this loss
[1:28:31] you're going to face this death you say
[1:28:33] oh wait a minute
[1:28:35] i don't know about this
[1:28:39] but you don't know everything you're
[1:28:41] going to face
[1:28:44] you would say oh i couldn't go through
[1:28:46] that
[1:28:49] but you do go through it
[1:28:53] you prove it to yourself when you come
[1:28:56] out on the other side of you say
[1:28:58] well i didn't know if i was going to
[1:28:59] make it but i made it
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:08] you know i know we speak against being
[1:29:11] proud
[1:29:13] pride but that's the pride of this
[1:29:16] life but i'm proud to be a christian
[1:29:26] amen i'm proud that i've made it through
[1:29:30] everything god has took me through
[1:29:33] not proud in my own abilities but it was
[1:29:36] god that gave me strength when i was
[1:29:38] weak
[1:29:39] hallelujah it was god that brought me
[1:29:41] through
[1:29:47] but he has confidence in you see
[1:29:51] he has more confidence in you than you
[1:29:53] have in yourself
[1:29:55] today they talk a lot about whether you
[1:29:57] have self-confidence or not
[1:30:03] but he's got confidence in you think
[1:30:05] about when
[1:30:07] the devil came up before the throne of
[1:30:09] god
[1:30:11] and god said have you considered my
[1:30:13] servant job
[1:30:15] there is none like him in all the earth
[1:30:22] he had confidence in job the devil said
[1:30:24] you've got a hedge around him
[1:30:26] remove that and i'll get him to curse
[1:30:28] you to your face
[1:30:30] god said i've got confidence in him that
[1:30:33] you won't be able to do that
[1:30:37] because he's my son my seed is in him
[1:30:42] i don't care what you throw at him you
[1:30:44] can't take his life now satan
[1:30:46] but you can take everything else and
[1:30:50] i've got confidence in him
[1:30:52] see what it means for god to have
[1:30:54] confidence in you
[1:30:56] he knows you're going to make it amen
[1:30:59] many times the devil comes to you and
[1:31:01] says
[1:31:03] man you ain't going to make this rapture
[1:31:06] look at you what a mess you are
[1:31:07] sometimes
[1:31:10] but god's got confidence in you he knows
[1:31:12] you're going to make it
[1:31:14] and therefore he said i will present to
[1:31:16] myself
[1:31:18] a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:31:23] why because he's not dependent on you
[1:31:26] he's dependent on himself
[1:31:28] and we're depending on him we're not
[1:31:31] depending on ourselves
[1:31:34] he's got confidence because he knows
[1:31:36] what's
[1:31:37] in you that should give you confidence
[1:31:40] today
[1:31:40] i can make it no matter what satan
[1:31:43] throws my
[1:31:44] way because there's something in me
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:56] every son that cometh the god must be
[1:31:58] scourged and
[1:31:59] tried and tested
[1:32:07] brother branham said preachers let the
[1:32:08] congregation get by with anything today
[1:32:11] what they need is a little child
[1:32:13] training
[1:32:14] what we need is preachers that will
[1:32:16] preach the word and tell us the truth
[1:32:18] about it
[1:32:18] and tell us we must be born again and
[1:32:21] bring us on the basis of the shed blood
[1:32:23] of jesus christ the son of god and
[1:32:26] introduce all the good things that god
[1:32:28] has got for us
[1:32:30] we need preachers that will tell us if
[1:32:32] you've got the character of christ
[1:32:34] then this is how you will act
[1:32:41] this is how you will live
[1:32:51] job said i wish there was somebody
[1:32:55] that could put one hand on god and place
[1:32:58] the other one on man
[1:33:00] and be a spokesman between a daze man he
[1:33:03] called him
[1:33:06] the prophet said
[1:33:10] a worthy one who could stand in the
[1:33:12] breach and put his hand on a sinful man
[1:33:14] and a holy god and bridge the way
[1:33:17] together
[1:33:19] and we've got that jesus christ
[1:33:23] he's our advocate hallelujah
[1:33:28] he put his hand on a sinful man and the
[1:33:31] other on a holy god
[1:33:33] because he knows what it's like to go
[1:33:36] through the things you're going through
[1:33:37] because he went through them
[1:33:39] but he can put his hand on a holy god
[1:33:41] because he'd done it without sin
[1:33:45] hallelujah praise the god
[1:33:49] hallelujah job was coming through all
[1:33:53] this and not understanding what was
[1:33:55] going on
[1:33:56] job says i will offend no more
[1:34:01] whatever i've done i won't do it no more
[1:34:03] see that's
[1:34:04] showing his character he began to search
[1:34:07] his life
[1:34:09] it's just something i did and then when
[1:34:13] he come down and he's asking god and god
[1:34:15] said
[1:34:16] where were you
[1:34:20] where were you job when i created this
[1:34:24] world
[1:34:28] then job comes down to his revelation of
[1:34:31] the end and says
[1:34:34] though the skin worms devour my body yet
[1:34:37] in my flesh shall i see god
[1:34:41] and not another but i'll see him for
[1:34:44] myself
[1:34:48] hallelujah
[1:34:52] abraham says god hasn't promised a
[1:34:54] flowery bed of ease
[1:34:57] but he's promised a lot of mountains
[1:35:01] he's but he's promised the grace to go
[1:35:03] over every one of them
[1:35:07] watch job when he went through his
[1:35:08] trials and testings
[1:35:11] every child of god first has to be tried
[1:35:14] and tested in other words
[1:35:15] they have to be trained like child
[1:35:17] training
[1:35:19] take some whipping straighten up you
[1:35:21] know how to act then how to conduct
[1:35:23] yourself as a christian
[1:35:25] god gives you a little bit of whipping
[1:35:26] once in a while turns you around a few
[1:35:29] times you know what
[1:35:30] it's all about sometimes lays you on
[1:35:33] your back so you can look up
[1:35:38] but it gives you the grace to go through
[1:35:51] paul says in second timothy persecutions
[1:35:54] afflictions which came unto me at
[1:35:57] antioch and iconium and lystra
[1:35:59] what persecutions i endured but out of
[1:36:02] them
[1:36:03] all the lord delivered me hallelujah
[1:36:07] yea and all that will live godly in
[1:36:10] christ jesus
[1:36:11] shall suffer persecutions
[1:36:15] but god will deliver you out of them all
[1:36:18] yes amen
[1:36:20] hallelujah peter said beloved think it
[1:36:23] not strange concerning the fiery trials
[1:36:26] which is to try you as though some
[1:36:28] strange thing is happening to you
[1:36:31] but rejoice in so much as ye are
[1:36:33] partakers of christ's suffering
[1:36:35] that when his glory shall be revealed
[1:36:38] you may be
[1:36:39] also you may be glad also with exceeding
[1:36:43] joy
[1:36:45] if ye be reproached for this for the
[1:36:48] name of christ
[1:36:49] happy are ye
[1:36:55] for the spirit of glory and of god
[1:36:58] rests upon you and on their parts he is
[1:37:02] evil spoken of but on your part he's
[1:37:04] glorified
[1:37:06] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[1:37:08] as a thief or as an evildoer as a
[1:37:09] busybody in other men's matters
[1:37:12] yet if any man suffer as a christian let
[1:37:14] him not be ashamed
[1:37:16] but let him glorify god on this behalf
[1:37:20] for the time has come that judgment must
[1:37:23] begin at the house of god
[1:37:25] and if it first begin at us what shall
[1:37:29] the end be of them that obeyed not the
[1:37:32] gospel of god
[1:37:34] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:37:36] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:37:38] appear
[1:37:39] wherefore let them that suffer according
[1:37:41] to the will of god
[1:37:42] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[1:37:45] in well-doing as into a faithful creator
[1:37:50] if we suffer because of the will of
[1:37:54] it be the will of god then we commit
[1:37:57] ourselves
[1:37:58] our souls unto him for his keeping
[1:38:05] brother branham said
[1:38:11] speaking of what i just read to you
[1:38:14] about what peter said said thinking not
[1:38:15] strange beloved when fire trials come
[1:38:17] upon you for
[1:38:18] it's only done to prove your faith
[1:38:22] that's more precious to you than gold
[1:38:27] look when you get sick sometime
[1:38:32] how is it the righteous suffer
[1:38:36] god does it in his for his own glory
[1:38:40] turns right back around and heals that
[1:38:42] and starts a testimony
[1:38:47] hallelujah when he allows sickness to
[1:38:50] come on you
[1:38:51] there's a testimony down the road coming
[1:38:54] when he allows you to to lose your job
[1:38:58] there's a testimony down the road coming
[1:39:00] because you're going to get another job
[1:39:02] god's going to give you one
[1:39:04] hallelujah
[1:39:08] i have never seen the righteous no
[1:39:10] forsaken nor his seed begging bread
[1:39:16] hallelujah
[1:39:20] i've quoted that for years but i can
[1:39:22] quote the first part of it now i was
[1:39:24] once young but now i'm
[1:39:26] old
[1:39:33] remember how elisha was tested to see if
[1:39:36] he would stay with elijah
[1:39:38] elijah says we've come here to the
[1:39:40] school of probably stay here when i'll
[1:39:41] you know i'll
[1:39:42] come back bye nope as my soul liveth
[1:39:46] i'll not leave you
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:49] he said what do you want he said i want
[1:39:52] a double portion of your spirit
[1:39:57] he said if you see me when i'm taken up
[1:40:00] you'll receive your request
[1:40:04] elisha remember he was plowing in the
[1:40:07] field
[1:40:08] and he left the plowing behind
[1:40:11] and went to follow elijah
[1:40:14] and elijah constantly tested him to see
[1:40:17] if he could get him to stay
[1:40:18] nope i am not stand i am going to get
[1:40:21] that double portion of your spirit
[1:40:23] i'm staying with you no matter what
[1:40:28] right elijah went up there
[1:40:32] to the river and the river parted
[1:40:35] horses fiery chariot came
[1:40:38] down sweeping down out of heaven elijah
[1:40:42] throwed back his mantle
[1:40:44] stepped on that chariot and ascended
[1:40:49] elisha picked up that man and went back
[1:40:50] to the rivers mode and said where's the
[1:40:52] god of elijah
[1:40:55] and the waters parted and he walked
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:02] across
[1:41:07] brother branham says in jehovah jericho
[1:41:09] every time that man really steps out to
[1:41:11] serve god
[1:41:12] he goes through testings god gives you a
[1:41:15] little training child
[1:41:16] training it is not very pleasant the
[1:41:19] bible says for a while
[1:41:21] but it yields forth peaceful fruits
[1:41:24] daddy used to take me out behind the
[1:41:26] house with a strap of leather about like
[1:41:28] that
[1:41:29] and got some good old-fashioned child
[1:41:31] training
[1:41:32] it's too bad our children don't get it
[1:41:34] today
[1:41:35] the trouble of it is use cigarette
[1:41:38] smoking cocktail drinking pitcher
[1:41:40] show running mothers run around on bar
[1:41:43] flies and things
[1:41:44] and letting babysitters take care of
[1:41:46] your kids instead of you being a home
[1:41:48] taking care of them like god
[1:41:50] gave them to you that's what caused all
[1:41:52] this stuff to get in that's exactly
[1:41:55] right
[1:41:55] no wonder we can't have faith how can
[1:41:58] you associate with things of the world
[1:42:00] and try to associate with christ
[1:42:02] god calls for separation then trials and
[1:42:05] testings come
[1:42:06] the bible said if we can't stand by the
[1:42:08] trials and testing
[1:42:10] then we become the illegitimate children
[1:42:12] bastard children
[1:42:14] the bible calls it and not the children
[1:42:16] of god we
[1:42:17] if we can't stand the trials and
[1:42:26] testings
[1:42:30] so there were three israelites
[1:42:37] and they were in babylon
[1:42:40] and there was a statue
[1:42:44] an image erected and the image was the
[1:42:48] image of daniel
[1:42:49] one of their brother beltazar
[1:42:55] and they were commanded when you hear
[1:42:58] the instruments play
[1:43:00] everyone's to fall down and worship and
[1:43:03] you know there were some
[1:43:04] there were some agents of the devil that
[1:43:07] had it in for them
[1:43:09] and they brought this to the king and
[1:43:11] said let it
[1:43:13] so be a command that if no one if they
[1:43:16] don't worship
[1:43:17] that they get thrown in the fiery
[1:43:18] furnace the king says all right i can
[1:43:21] see that i agree with that
[1:43:24] and send then them same ones come to him
[1:43:26] and said hey there's three down there
[1:43:28] that's not falling down and worshipping
[1:43:31] this image that you've erected
[1:43:34] he said bring him here he said
[1:43:38] i'm going to give you another chance
[1:43:41] we're going to play
[1:43:42] these instruments again and when you
[1:43:45] hear them play
[1:43:46] you fall down and worship this idol
[1:43:50] and they said king we're not careful to
[1:43:52] answer you in this manner
[1:43:54] in other words we don't have to take
[1:43:56] counsel we don't have to go
[1:43:58] we don't have to pray about this we
[1:44:01] already know the will of our god
[1:44:05] we're not going to fall down and worship
[1:44:07] it
[1:44:09] so he said you're cast them into the
[1:44:12] fiery furnace and heat it up
[1:44:16] heat it up many more times hotter
[1:44:22] cast them in the bible said it was so
[1:44:24] hot that the men that went down to cast
[1:44:26] them in
[1:44:27] and killed them
[1:44:30] and they cast them in see they were
[1:44:33] tested
[1:44:35] here's the thing
[1:44:38] they were going to die no matter what
[1:44:42] the way they looked at it if
[1:44:45] if we fall down in worship then we're
[1:44:47] going to die a spiritual doubt
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:52] yes sir but if we don't fall down in
[1:44:55] worship
[1:44:56] and our god doesn't deliver us from
[1:44:57] there then we're going to die
[1:45:01] but will be delivered out of your hand
[1:45:03] and will not die
[1:45:04] spiritual death
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:09] so we don't we don't have to be careful
[1:45:11] in answering you this
[1:45:14] threw them in there and then
[1:45:18] king nebuchadnezzar looks over in there
[1:45:19] and he says hey wait a minute how many
[1:45:21] men did we throw down in there anyway
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:24] amen he said didn't we throw three in
[1:45:27] there
[1:45:28] he said yes o king we threw three in
[1:45:30] there
[1:45:32] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:45:35] and he said well i see four down there
[1:45:41] he said and they're unbound they had
[1:45:44] bound them and thrown them in there
[1:45:46] he said they're unbound and they're
[1:45:49] walking around down there and the fourth
[1:45:51] man is like the son of god
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:57] he commanded them take them up out of
[1:45:59] there and you know what the bible says
[1:46:01] the bible says the fire had burned off
[1:46:03] their bonds
[1:46:05] but the bible says that not even the
[1:46:07] smell of fire was in their clothes
[1:46:11] not even the smell of fire and smoke was
[1:46:14] on their clothes
[1:46:17] god protected them through the fire
[1:46:20] hallelujah
[1:46:24] hallelujah
[1:46:28] fire had no power
[1:46:31] their hair wouldn't sins neither were
[1:46:34] their coats chains
[1:46:36] nor the smell of fire on them
[1:46:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:45] you know
[1:46:51] when we're tested when we're tempted
[1:46:56] we can take our stand
[1:47:00] there was a man in the bible
[1:47:03] and his name looks like job bets but
[1:47:07] it's pronounced yabets
[1:47:11] and he's only mentioned in two verses of
[1:47:13] the bible
[1:47:16] and it says he was more honorable than
[1:47:18] his brother it's in first chronicles 4
[1:47:20] 9 9-10 and his mother called his name
[1:47:24] yahbet
[1:47:24] saying because i bear him in sorrow
[1:47:28] and yahweh called on god of israel and
[1:47:31] said
[1:47:32] oh th thou would has blessed me indeed
[1:47:35] and enlarge my coast that thine hand
[1:47:39] might be with me
[1:47:40] and thou wouldest keep me from evil
[1:47:44] that it may not grieve me and god
[1:47:47] granted him that which he requested
[1:47:52] enlarge my territory god
[1:47:57] let me take more domain over this
[1:48:01] flesh enlarge my territory
[1:48:08] let me reign more supreme
[1:48:11] in this life
[1:48:16] the bible says he to them that received
[1:48:19] him he gave them power
[1:48:23] power to become sons
[1:48:27] you know the character of christ
[1:48:30] and i'm closing where's brother doug
[1:48:40] the character of christ a lot of times
[1:48:43] people
[1:48:44] get his character wrong they think of
[1:48:47] sweet jesus
[1:48:54] but you know he came down to the temple
[1:48:56] one time brother ritchie
[1:48:59] and he saw them in there making money
[1:49:02] off the people
[1:49:04] for them to come and buy animals to be
[1:49:07] sacrificed for their sins
