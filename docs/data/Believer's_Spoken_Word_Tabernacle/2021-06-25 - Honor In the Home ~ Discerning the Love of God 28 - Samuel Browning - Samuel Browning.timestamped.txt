[35:50] life and
[35:51] lord situations oh god just brood over

[35:59] and the soul
[35:59] lord may you just brood oh god i pray
[36:03] father and
[36:03] may the word just come the lord this
[36:05] evening lord and
[36:06] just put things right in order lord god
[36:09] and just
[36:10] move in a very special way a very
[36:12] personal way lord
[36:13] in our lives lord you know every need
[36:16] lord that's here and
[36:17] we just lord god ask that you'll just
[36:20] now
[36:20] come lord and speak to us lord speak to
[36:24] us through your word we pray
[36:26] we love you and we thank you father in
[36:29] the name of jesus christ
[36:31] amen amen we want to invite you to the
[36:34] word of the lord
[36:35] let's go to first corinthians 13 i'm
[36:38] going to start there and then we're
[36:40] going to move
[36:41] move on
[36:50] and just as you're turning there i'm
[36:52] just going to read just two verses out
[36:53] of there but
[36:57] we see how that paul has said all of
[37:00] this here in the
[37:01] very first three verses that a lot of
[37:04] great exploits or things that could be
[37:06] done but yet
[37:08] if love itself is not present it doesn't
[37:12] account for anything
[37:13] as paul would say over and over i am
[37:16] nothing
[37:17] and so we recognize that this love is
[37:20] much higher than that filial love that
[37:23] we would have or a husband would have
[37:25] for his wife and wife or a husband
[37:27] we recognize that this this charity this
[37:30] love we're speaking of it's
[37:31] it's god's own love it's his own life
[37:34] it's his word it's it's who he really is
[37:36] and so this is this is what brings about
[37:39] as we looked at last week a real
[37:41] character within our lives it took the
[37:44] character of that life coming
[37:47] that you and i might receive life and
[37:49] that our lives might be
[37:51] molded and shaped by his life
[37:55] dwelling on the inside of us and here
[37:57] paul
[37:58] expresses this in verse 4 charity
[38:01] suffereth long
[38:03] it is kind it envieth not
[38:06] and it vaunteth not itself and is not
[38:09] puffed up
[38:10] it does not behave itself unseemly
[38:14] it seeketh not her own is not easily
[38:18] provoked and think of no evil
[38:23] so we were looking at that a little bit
[38:24] last week and i just kind of put all
[38:26] those together and yet there's so many
[38:28] parts there
[38:29] but it doesn't act unbecomingly or
[38:32] rudely
[38:33] and it does not seek its own it isn't
[38:36] all about
[38:36] me and it also it doesn't
[38:40] it doesn't it's not easily provoked
[38:43] where it just
[38:44] quickly something comes up and it's
[38:45] quickly responding or spouting right
[38:48] back it's
[38:49] love is not easily provoked and it
[38:52] thinketh no evil it doesn't keep
[38:54] records of evil
[38:59] oh my god
[39:02] we need his help don't we amen
[39:06] amen may god bless the reading of the
[39:08] word as you're being seated
[39:11] i want to just take as the lord's been
[39:13] leading us on this for
[39:15] some time and we're looking at that part
[39:18] in there
[39:20] it does not behave itself unseemly and
[39:22] we find a lot of
[39:23] of those parts within it where paul was
[39:26] saying
[39:26] what charity is not
[39:30] and you know at one time and depending
[39:32] on how each and every one of us were
[39:35] natured in our first in our in our
[39:38] original
[39:39] makeup or temperament you recognize that
[39:42] there are things that many of you can
[39:44] look at even in the way that your makeup
[39:47] is and you can say
[39:48] wow what a difference since the lord has
[39:52] come into my life
[39:53] you find you find strength you find that
[39:56] the overcoming power is so real
[39:59] and how that it brings such a change on
[40:02] the inside and it's an overcoming
[40:04] because you're
[40:05] always going to be tested and you you'll
[40:07] find yourself that if you
[40:09] are not in the presence of god like you
[40:11] ought to be you'll find yourself
[40:13] very weak because he's our strength and
[40:16] that's what jude would say
[40:18] to building up yourself on your most
[40:21] holy faith praying in the holy ghost
[40:24] keeping yourselves in the love of god
[40:28] so it's there's there's an effect of a
[40:31] life that is in the presence of god and
[40:33] think how brother branham would talk
[40:34] about it when he would minister the
[40:36] different messages
[40:37] a hidden life with christ and what it
[40:39] takes to live in uh you know an
[40:41] overcoming life or why
[40:43] why uh you know why people are so tossed
[40:45] about he would deal with that
[40:46] refreshment
[40:48] of a life that is living behind the veil
[40:51] and this is something that within our
[40:53] lives that we recognize that every day
[40:55] as believers that we do we can't live on
[40:58] yesterday's experience we've got to have
[41:01] a fresh experience with almighty god
[41:04] it takes first of all a real experience
[41:06] with god where our
[41:08] nature has been changed and and god has
[41:10] brought a real dominion on the inside of
[41:13] our life and then from that once that
[41:16] that
[41:16] has come into our life well it's just a
[41:18] desire that we have there's no other joy
[41:21] outside of getting into his presence and
[41:23] that's where we realize
[41:24] this is my source of strength prayer
[41:27] then does not become
[41:28] something that's laborious or i have to
[41:31] read my bible or i have to pray or
[41:34] no no you recognize this is my strength
[41:37] and
[41:37] this is where god is god he he ministers
[41:40] to my heart
[41:41] and you just simply take it not even in
[41:43] a manner of of study you just
[41:45] you know you just have a time with him
[41:47] there's times for study but
[41:49] there's a time just with him to allow
[41:51] him just to speak to you and even in
[41:53] prayer where
[41:54] we're not the ones always doing the
[41:56] talking but where we stop and allow him
[41:58] to talk a little bit amen i think that
[42:01] makes a huge difference in our life and
[42:03] this is where
[42:04] we draw strength as as a believer and we
[42:08] look at this here with
[42:09] in in the part of in taking the contrast
[42:12] and that's really how the lord's been
[42:13] leading us
[42:14] on this in in in that of that when it
[42:17] says
[42:17] does not behave itself uh unseemly
[42:21] rather we want to say it is that of
[42:24] honor
[42:24] so our life is to be a life that looks
[42:28] and looks at things in honor holds
[42:30] things in honor
[42:31] esteems that in honor and to treat one
[42:35] another
[42:36] with honor and respect you know brother
[42:38] branham as we
[42:39] looking at this here in the scriptures
[42:42] and just
[42:43] taking this here over the last uh some
[42:46] some of these last few moments uh
[42:48] services how the lord was just dealing
[42:50] with us on that of order
[42:52] and authority that even to where what
[42:55] goes on even outside
[42:57] of these walls and the walls of our home
[43:00] that god himself has set
[43:01] all of those things in place and god
[43:04] values
[43:05] those who value authority
[43:08] and respect that authority because god's
[43:10] put it in place
[43:12] and we we recognize that's not always
[43:14] something that maybe
[43:15] is popular but you see brother brown i
[43:17] mean and i've i mentioned to you as a
[43:19] church if you haven't listened to the
[43:21] message
[43:21] respects in a while i've been living in
[43:24] that message for
[43:25] months now and just going through that
[43:28] message over and over
[43:29] because even within the part of when
[43:32] brother brown would tell us he said
[43:34] even if you can't respect the man you
[43:37] respect the office that they hold
[43:39] and to see how you know i just had a
[43:42] person you know
[43:43] just some time ago and here they were
[43:45] present when we happened to speak a few
[43:47] weeks back in one of the first services
[43:49] on that with how
[43:50] servants and masters and how we relate
[43:52] to every situation
[43:54] and the individual just they told me
[43:55] they said you didn't realize it but
[43:57] what god had you to speak that was for
[43:59] me because i just had a change in the
[44:01] supervisor
[44:02] and there's things that was going on at
[44:04] that time not even from here
[44:06] but how that you see god i don't believe
[44:08] it was just for that person i believe
[44:09] that was for all of us
[44:11] amen you see we we recognize that when
[44:14] we're looking at things in honor
[44:16] i want to just really set this here in
[44:18] the background because what i want to
[44:19] begin to speak on is
[44:21] some things has really just been
[44:23] pressing on my heart for just
[44:24] months and then see how god just brings
[44:26] this that to bring it right here
[44:28] and that is i want to speak on honor in
[44:31] the home
[44:32] brother bram says i think one thing is
[44:35] needed in the great universal church of
[44:37] god tonight
[44:38] is love we do not need other things as
[44:42] much as
[44:42] we think we do and all these other
[44:45] things
[44:46] our emotions and our gifts they're all
[44:49] wonderful
[44:50] and to god we give praise but if those
[44:53] gifts are not
[44:54] governed by love then they are not
[44:57] effective
[44:58] love should govern the home
[45:01] love is the greatest force that was ever
[45:04] put
[45:04] into the power of man how many believe
[45:07] that
[45:09] it's the greatest force that's ever been
[45:11] put into the power
[45:13] of man you're aware as a believer when
[45:16] you
[45:16] you listen to the messages on divine
[45:19] love and when love is projected and
[45:21] on and on you listen to all of those
[45:23] messages you will find a common
[45:25] thread that is throughout that when love
[45:28] has been
[45:29] projected then grace steps in
[45:33] and produces what love has
[45:36] called for so but first grace can't step
[45:40] in
[45:40] if love's not been projected so that
[45:43] that part is very very important so love
[45:47] is the greatest force that was ever put
[45:49] into the power of man a home that's not
[45:52] disciplined by love is not much
[45:56] of a home he's talking about the order
[45:58] of it if the husband and wife
[46:00] doesn't solemnly love each other they
[46:03] can't
[46:03] trust each other he says that's why i
[46:06] think that instead of
[46:07] resting our faith upon some emotion
[46:11] which is all right or some gift which is
[46:14] all right
[46:14] like shouting speaking with tongues or
[46:17] other things
[46:18] that we take for saying that we have the
[46:20] holy spirit when we do this
[46:22] or those things are all right now let me
[46:23] just pause here a minute don't finish
[46:25] reading the quote on me
[46:26] let me pause here for a moment you see
[46:28] when the message of the hour come let me
[46:31] just
[46:31] lay this in a little bit of teaching
[46:33] when the gifts were restored there
[46:36] out there in uh for at the beginning of
[46:39] the lady of seeing age
[46:40] here with that part that was not the
[46:43] long
[46:44] promised restoration back to the word
[46:47] but it was a restoration
[46:49] of gifts are you with me you find that
[46:52] then here
[46:53] the word comes behind that because every
[46:56] gift is to be judged by the word
[47:00] is that right every dream every vision
[47:03] every prayer everything nothing is
[47:07] to go beyond the word it's always to be
[47:10] tested by the word is that right
[47:12] this is where you find remember how
[47:14] brother brahma make a statement
[47:16] he talks about how he says you know when
[47:18] how that you know
[47:19] satan's he came there in a robe and he
[47:21] came and presented himself to martin and
[47:24] you know he says
[47:25] martin fall down and worship me and he's
[47:27] there in my
[47:28] great supernatural happening brother
[47:30] braham said many pentecostals would have
[47:32] fell for that
[47:34] is that right but he said martin looked
[47:37] at him
[47:37] and he saw this crown and he said get
[47:40] behind me satan because
[47:42] he knew the word said that his saints
[47:45] shall
[47:46] crown him didn't matter the experience
[47:49] didn't matter how good it felt
[47:51] didn't matter to all the emotions and
[47:52] this is what brother branham is bringing
[47:54] it back to
[47:55] is let me just bring it down even to our
[47:58] lunch box
[47:58] in our home we can have a lot of
[48:00] different emotions but what everything
[48:02] should be brought right back to
[48:04] and tested is the word no matter what it
[48:08] is
[48:08] in the church no matter what emotion
[48:10] it's got to come back to the word
[48:13] because that's where faith can really
[48:16] rest that's where all true honor comes
[48:20] from
[48:20] is the word is that right honor comes
[48:24] from
[48:25] the word think about the time that ahab
[48:27] in them you know
[48:28] when they called up and they wanted to
[48:30] go on down to ramoth gilead ahab wanted
[48:33] to do it so ahab didn't want any voice
[48:36] that was going to speak against it and
[48:38] this is why he had all
[48:39] his prophets that were around him you
[48:42] know the bible says
[48:43] in the multitude of counsel there is
[48:45] safety and that is true
[48:46] but this is where it has to be who is
[48:49] the council
[48:49] that's established around you come on
[48:52] somebody
[48:53] because real counsel is that which holds
[48:55] to that word
[48:57] and to think of here they were they
[48:59] outnumbered all
[49:00] all of them but jehoshaphat said is
[49:02] there not
[49:03] one more prophet of the lord
[49:08] ahab said i hate that guy he's always
[49:12] prophesying evil concerning me
[49:17] but jehoshaphat said let the king not
[49:19] say so
[49:20] you see among all of those prophets that
[49:23] were there
[49:25] here they were under an anointing but it
[49:28] was a lying
[49:29] spirit hey man they were emotional they
[49:32] know that they felt the goosebumps and
[49:35] whoa glory they felt all of that but the
[49:37] problem was
[49:39] it wasn't with the word
[49:42] and micah being a true prophet of god
[49:45] he just didn't lay aside and say my look
[49:48] at all of them my goodness
[49:49] what a meeting that's going on micah
[49:51] stood there and he knew what god
[49:54] had spoke through elijah and he knew
[49:56] this
[49:57] can't go this way because there's a
[49:59] curse
[50:00] upon ahab
[50:03] is that right and so you find that
[50:07] within this
[50:08] that god in this hour brings it around
[50:11] that not that gifts are done away with
[50:14] gifts are not looked at as well those
[50:16] are just
[50:16] little things or or though no the
[50:18] everything is put
[50:20] in its place and its order it's kind of
[50:23] like a young lady who
[50:24] has her uh shower or whatever more where
[50:27] she gets her gifts her pots and pans
[50:29] she might be just looking at them pots
[50:31] and pans for months
[50:32] but eventually there comes a time
[50:34] there's a home where they're going to be
[50:36] put in place and order and she's gonna
[50:39] need this
[50:40] stockpot when it comes to making pasta
[50:42] she's gonna need this one
[50:44] when it comes to making rice everyone
[50:46] has its purpose and that's
[50:48] how the gifts go in the body to be used
[50:51] by the lord jesus christ
[50:53] through his bride
[50:57] glory be to god so we're not out of line
[51:01] we know right where we're standing amen
[51:04] but if we come back to the principle
[51:06] look what he says
[51:07] love first and then those things
[51:11] i think our church would progress a lot
[51:13] faster
[51:14] if we would get god first and god
[51:18] is love now the scripture tells us here
[51:22] when we look at this of how
[51:25] love itself brother branham has laid
[51:26] this in love it brings
[51:28] trust it brings confidence it brings
[51:31] faith
[51:32] it brings respect and to think the home
[51:34] itself
[51:35] is just a small part that reflects what
[51:38] the economy of god
[51:40] is to operate or how the economy of god
[51:42] operates
[51:44] so the thing there is a there's a set
[51:46] order
[51:47] of which and i want you this is where i
[51:49] want to take you here tonight
[51:50] there's a set order here of which
[51:53] the leadership and the presence of god
[51:56] is to flow
[51:57] within a home god has a divine
[52:01] order and god will never depart from
[52:04] that order
[52:05] he set that order in place and so when
[52:08] we look at this here
[52:09] in the scripture i want to just move
[52:11] here and i just been kind of moving back
[52:14] and forth and let me just
[52:15] go to one scripture here in first
[52:17] corinthians 11 verse 1
[52:19] paul is speaking here to to the
[52:21] corinthian church
[52:22] and to us as believers be ye followers
[52:26] of
[52:26] me even as i also am of christ
[52:29] and he says now i praise you brethren
[52:31] that you would remember me in all things
[52:33] and keep the ordinances as i delivered
[52:37] them
[52:37] to you but i would have you know that
[52:40] the head
[52:41] of every man is christ and the head
[52:44] of the woman is the man and the head of
[52:47] christ
[52:47] is god now notice how paul would would
[52:50] bring this in here he is paul being
[52:52] the first messenger there to that age
[52:55] paul
[52:56] paul was given this of which peter
[53:00] did not have peter paul was given this
[53:03] to set
[53:04] the church of the living god in order in
[53:06] that hour
[53:07] it was to paul was revealed the mystery
[53:10] that was
[53:10] hidden god and how that paul just as
[53:13] much as peter
[53:14] god wrought effectual in peter's
[53:17] ministry to the jews
[53:18] he wrought effectually towards the
[53:20] gentiles
[53:21] in paul's ministry and this was
[53:24] something that was established
[53:26] paul was letting it was taking it back
[53:28] and tying it back into the place
[53:30] of the fall that took place in the
[53:32] garden of eden
[53:33] where at that one time that man and
[53:35] woman were co-equal together
[53:38] with god but after the fall has come
[53:41] now here they are set within a dual
[53:43] covenant and god has a certain order
[53:46] and he refers there even in that place
[53:49] of how
[53:49] the woman let your desire be unto thy
[53:52] husband
[53:53] and he shall rule over thee now let me
[53:56] just i've got to just drag my feet here
[53:57] a little bit
[53:58] because that word rule does not mean
[54:01] to dominate over are you with me
[54:05] that word that word to rule it deals
[54:08] with so much more of a
[54:10] cultivate and how that that direction
[54:12] let me say this to you
[54:13] that speaks to us as as husbands as
[54:16] men within the home there is a great
[54:19] responsibility
[54:20] it will not be the woman that will
[54:22] answer it will be
[54:24] us as husbands as men that will answer
[54:29] it's like for this church i'll give an
[54:31] account on that when i stand there i
[54:33] will give an account
[54:34] for the word that i preach or what i
[54:37] have would have
[54:38] failed to preach there is an
[54:41] accountability
[54:42] that is held there but if i can say i
[54:44] have not shunned to declare
[54:46] the full counsel of god god you know
[54:48] i've told them i'd sent this
[54:50] they went and they did this anyhow but
[54:52] it's off of my hands
[54:55] i don't want anything on my hands when
[54:57] it comes to that day
[54:58] i'd rather somebody be mad at me now
[55:02] i'd rather you because you might get a
[55:04] little mad now but i got confidence in
[55:06] the holy spirit
[55:07] if you're a child of god god will deal
[55:09] with your life
[55:10] you can't stay mad at the word that's
[55:12] being delivered
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:18] the head of every man is christ and the
[55:20] head of the woman is the man
[55:22] and the head of christ is god now notice
[55:25] paul goes on he says every man praying
[55:27] or prophesying
[55:28] having his head covered dishonoreth his
[55:31] head
[55:32] is that right now notice just even in
[55:35] in the hair now that paul is speaking of
[55:38] that if a man have
[55:39] long hair and you know this in the
[55:41] scripture but moving down to it
[55:43] if he were to have long hair he
[55:45] dishonors his hand
[55:48] is that right but every woman that
[55:50] prayeth or prophesied with her head
[55:52] uncovered dishonoreth her head for that
[55:56] is even
[55:56] all one as if she were shaven the
[55:59] background of it is that
[56:01] it it would be it would be an
[56:03] unacceptable thing for a woman
[56:05] to be found out in public and now taking
[56:07] this in account of the time
[56:09] if her head was shaven it spoke
[56:12] of a form of adultery
[56:16] it spoke she was not under headship it
[56:18] spoke there was
[56:20] there was fault there was error and
[56:21] there was uncleanliness
[56:23] that was there all through the scripture
[56:25] a veil has been given
[56:27] and not just a veil here but the hair
[56:30] itself
[56:30] is the veil that of long hair that's
[56:33] given to the woman
[56:35] has her covering but for a man to have
[56:38] long hair
[56:39] he's a
[56:47] notice for a man indeed ought not to
[56:49] cover his fed
[56:50] head for as much as he is in the image
[56:52] of image and glory of god
[56:54] but the woman is the glory of man this
[56:56] is this is just a great part right here
[56:59] you see with that of the woman being the
[57:01] glory of the man the man
[57:03] recognizes this right here is my glory
[57:07] you wouldn't treat your glory wrong
[57:11] that's a reflection glory the word glory
[57:14] is
[57:14] honor she is thine
[57:17] honor is that right
[57:21] for man notice this for the man is not
[57:23] of the woman
[57:24] but the woman but the woman of the man
[57:27] the paul's taking it back here before
[57:29] the fall
[57:30] neither was the man created for the
[57:32] woman but the woman
[57:33] for the man so coming back to
[57:36] the beginning is that right so now when
[57:40] we see this for this cause
[57:41] off the woman to have power on her head
[57:44] because
[57:45] of the angels brother brown lays that
[57:47] down very clearly
[57:48] that of that of the long hair it shows
[57:51] that you have received and come under
[57:54] that
[57:55] messenger's message
[57:58] is that right now i know i know there's
[58:01] things in
[58:01] individuals you can know that they have
[58:03] long hair and they ain't come under
[58:04] nothing
[58:06] is that right but you see for those that
[58:09] have and really
[58:10] having that that real heart that is
[58:12] inclined to god's word
[58:13] what a great compliment because there's
[58:15] a character
[58:17] it's not that well long hair is in style
[58:19] no no if they're holding to that word
[58:21] but there's a character
[58:22] that's behind that oh i'm gonna preach
[58:24] for a little bit you see a person can
[58:26] have long hair
[58:27] but actually it's shaved off on the
[58:29] inside
[58:32] come on somebody you could have a man
[58:34] that's got short hair
[58:35] but he's a big on the inside he's
[58:38] a pushover come on somebody
[58:40] you see it it deals with a real
[58:43] character
[58:44] that's on the inside this is what god
[58:47] looks for this
[58:48] is god's desire is that there's real
[58:50] character
[58:51] that's on the inside now notice he goes
[58:53] on to say
[58:54] neither the nevertheless neither is the
[58:56] man without the woman neither the woman
[58:58] without the man
[58:59] in the lord for as the woman is of the
[59:01] man even so is the man also by the woman
[59:04] but all things of god judging yourselves
[59:08] is it comely that a man a woman pray
[59:11] unto god
[59:12] uncovered doth not even nature itself
[59:14] teach you
[59:15] that if a man have long hair it is a
[59:17] shame
[59:18] unto him but if a woman have long hair
[59:21] it is a glory to her for her hair
[59:24] is given her for a covering
[59:28] let me just say this to you you've heard
[59:31] this and i've heard this
[59:32] and then you know you hear things well
[59:34] i'm just trimming the dead ends
[59:36] where does your hair grow from does it
[59:39] grow from the outside in
[59:41] or from the inside out preach brother
[59:44] samuel
[59:45] that don't even make sense that's a lie
[59:49] that the devil has told
[59:52] what is long hair you might there might
[59:54] be a sister then maybe
[59:56] her hair can't get very long because of
[59:58] just how her hair is
[1:00:00] long hair is uncut hair
[1:00:03] you might have the longest hair in the
[1:00:06] church tonight but if you took off a
[1:00:07] millimeter of it
[1:00:08] you've got cut hair short hair now i'm
[1:00:12] not condemning anybody
[1:00:13] but i'm condemning that spirit
[1:00:16] because when god look what god did
[1:00:18] jeremiah 7 29
[1:00:20] when israel went away from following god
[1:00:23] because they wouldn't obey his voice
[1:00:25] jeremiah 7 29
[1:00:26] god said cut off thine hair old daughter
[1:00:29] of jerusalem
[1:00:30] why because that she was rebellious and
[1:00:33] god said
[1:00:34] you might as well let it display on the
[1:00:36] outside of what's on the inside
[1:00:41] honoring the home i'm getting somewhere
[1:00:45] i'm getting somewhere so here when we
[1:00:49] come back to this here
[1:00:50] you see god has an order thing sometimes
[1:00:53] it's just that
[1:00:54] simple that just even what is
[1:00:57] there on the outside of how god has set
[1:01:00] that forth
[1:01:01] just of an honor that here a woman would
[1:01:04] she
[1:01:04] here in honoring god's word honoring her
[1:01:06] husband and the husband himself
[1:01:09] honoring that of his wife let me just
[1:01:11] assert this in this manner
[1:01:13] there is no other way to have honor in
[1:01:15] the home
[1:01:16] without the word the only way that
[1:01:20] where honor can come in the home is by
[1:01:22] the word
[1:01:23] other than that remember the honor
[1:01:25] itself that the pharisees had among one
[1:01:27] another
[1:01:27] is they did this and oh this one honored
[1:01:30] them because of
[1:01:31] you know their position and they were
[1:01:32] always trying to outdo
[1:01:34] one another instead of holding to the
[1:01:37] word
[1:01:39] when we hold to the word then it is
[1:01:41] honoring the word
[1:01:43] it's honoring god then honor can come
[1:01:46] into the hall
[1:01:48] oh my my my my look at this here tonight
[1:01:52] god has an order here in psalms psalms
[1:01:54] 133 verse 1
[1:01:56] david said behold how good and how
[1:01:59] pleasant it is
[1:02:00] for brethren to dwell together in
[1:02:04] unity now unity ain't just dwelling
[1:02:07] under the same roof
[1:02:10] are you here now listen now preach with
[1:02:11] me i'm gonna i'm just i'm in the mold
[1:02:14] just
[1:02:14] just the teeth just preach with me now
[1:02:16] don't get oh my brother samuel
[1:02:18] you don't know my situation but remember
[1:02:20] you can't fix your situation
[1:02:23] god's the one who can fix it and you
[1:02:26] don't want to sit there and say oh but
[1:02:28] you don't know this
[1:02:29] why don't you just invite him to your
[1:02:31] pew right now
[1:02:32] invite him and say god come take over in
[1:02:34] this situation
[1:02:35] and and don't sit there with the you
[1:02:37] don't know all the records why don't you
[1:02:39] just let him come
[1:02:40] and let him deal with that if that's
[1:02:42] what's here tonight
[1:02:45] order whole honor in the home notice for
[1:02:49] brethren to dwell together
[1:02:50] in unity god doesn't want disunity in a
[1:02:53] home
[1:02:54] he doesn't want disunity in a church
[1:02:57] is that right god does it because when
[1:03:00] you find that if you find that of
[1:03:01] disunity this is why brother branham
[1:03:03] could say
[1:03:04] even when he would speak to individuals
[1:03:06] and in church order he said when you
[1:03:08] feel like you're getting to know more
[1:03:09] than your pastor or he says or in that
[1:03:12] way he says that
[1:03:13] you just can't do that he said then it'd
[1:03:15] be best for you to find another church
[1:03:18] he wasn't commending them on that he was
[1:03:20] letting them know
[1:03:21] they've rose to a place they should
[1:03:22] never have rose to
[1:03:25] but in order to go on you better find
[1:03:27] yourself another place
[1:03:29] is that right so when we we see this
[1:03:32] it's
[1:03:32] it's important to dwell together in
[1:03:34] unity god likes unity
[1:03:36] he likes harmony he likes a oneness that
[1:03:38] is there
[1:03:39] a oneness of spirit this is god's desire
[1:03:43] i mean you know for let me just go on to
[1:03:45] preach here
[1:03:46] it is like the precious ointment notice
[1:03:49] what he describes this unity
[1:03:50] it's like the precious ointment upon the
[1:03:53] head
[1:03:54] that ran down upon the beard even
[1:03:57] aaron's beard that went down to the
[1:04:00] skirts of his garment
[1:04:02] as the dew of hermann and as the dude
[1:04:04] descended upon
[1:04:05] the mountains of zion for there the lord
[1:04:07] commanded the blessing even
[1:04:09] life forevermore do was
[1:04:12] necessary in these areas in order to
[1:04:15] bring life
[1:04:16] because it can get really hot
[1:04:19] think of this who was it that put the
[1:04:22] anointing oil
[1:04:24] upon aaron it was moses
[1:04:28] the prophet the word in that generation
[1:04:31] and that our that anointing was poured
[1:04:34] out this is why
[1:04:35] that the word is not a letter the letter
[1:04:38] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[1:04:41] it must be the anointing of the word the
[1:04:44] presence of jesus christ
[1:04:46] upon that life and notice that anointing
[1:04:49] is poured out
[1:04:50] and then it moves and it flows from the
[1:04:52] head
[1:04:53] down through the body clear there to the
[1:04:56] garments clear down to the feet
[1:04:59] that's the presence of god upon the
[1:05:03] generation upon the people of god
[1:05:05] upon a church upon the families upon the
[1:05:08] homes
[1:05:09] are you with me you see god doesn't god
[1:05:13] doesn't work it in any other order
[1:05:15] you see then brother branham when he
[1:05:16] would take this in the message
[1:05:18] in the message wantness and he would
[1:05:20] deal with this
[1:05:21] and deal with the part of how that of
[1:05:23] family and things is to be won and
[1:05:25] brother bram says oneness itself it
[1:05:27] means to be one with or united
[1:05:29] and he's you know he says everything we
[1:05:31] do should be
[1:05:33] weighed by the word i think that's a
[1:05:36] very powerful thing
[1:05:38] because you know when you weigh things
[1:05:40] things can look right
[1:05:41] but when you weigh them they may not be
[1:05:44] right on is that right
[1:05:48] i mean you can look at two different
[1:05:49] balls and both of them say my goodness
[1:05:52] man they're the same
[1:05:53] but one of them might have a greater
[1:05:54] density than the other
[1:05:56] and when you weigh them or the bible
[1:05:59] says
[1:06:00] prove all things try is that right
[1:06:03] prove one is right there this is why
[1:06:06] brother branham when he's dealing with
[1:06:08] in
[1:06:08] in the choosing of a bride brother
[1:06:10] branham will take that of of character
[1:06:11] and he says it
[1:06:12] he say it of how that even in
[1:06:15] approaching of
[1:06:16] marriage or any of those things he said
[1:06:18] the man he said a person should
[1:06:19] study carefully for they could ruin
[1:06:23] their life is that right and he makes a
[1:06:26] statement just listening here to it
[1:06:28] this morning brother brown says
[1:06:30] character he says look for character
[1:06:31] first
[1:06:32] then love now you know character
[1:06:35] sometimes
[1:06:36] you can find a good person there's
[1:06:38] individuals brother branham when he
[1:06:39] preaches statue of a perfect man
[1:06:41] follows it with blasphemous names he
[1:06:43] takes those virtues that are laid out in
[1:06:45] ii peter
[1:06:46] and he said we know that there are
[1:06:48] people he said that they themselves
[1:06:50] have many of these virtues he said but
[1:06:53] the difference is
[1:06:54] is there is a nature given and there's
[1:06:57] one that is a
[1:06:58] spirit given and the spirit given is the
[1:07:01] one he said
[1:07:02] that we're talking about that's the one
[1:07:05] that has to come
[1:07:06] from god is that right so when we
[1:07:09] weigh things by the word now notice you
[1:07:12] know
[1:07:13] this is when we look at when you know
[1:07:15] we're looking at a home and
[1:07:16] we think of my you know what what our
[1:07:18] desire is
[1:07:19] you know i think of how brother braham
[1:07:21] says in in spoken words original seed
[1:07:24] and brother baby says if you want a
[1:07:25] church preach the word
[1:07:29] now he ain't just talking about a group
[1:07:30] of people but he's talking about
[1:07:32] a church one that that is filled with
[1:07:35] god what is
[1:07:36] really a life that's called out of the
[1:07:38] world and set aside with god
[1:07:40] preach the word and god the word itself
[1:07:43] will have an effect
[1:07:45] is that right so in order when we look
[1:07:48] at this here
[1:07:49] that every home itself that it should be
[1:07:52] place the word before anything else
[1:07:56] is that right i know we all agree on
[1:07:58] that now let's look here
[1:07:59] in genesis chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:08:02] very familiar passage here and i i'm
[1:08:06] just you know i'm not just speaking
[1:08:07] these things here
[1:08:08] to those of you who are married i'm
[1:08:10] speaking it to young people who are not
[1:08:12] married yet i'm speaking this
[1:08:14] to things you know i've got three or two
[1:08:16] young men and one on the way
[1:08:18] so there's a lot of things that that
[1:08:20] within this that for them
[1:08:21] these are certain things that they hear
[1:08:23] they hear all the time
[1:08:24] they had certain talks with daddy and
[1:08:26] they hear some of these things
[1:08:28] verse 15 and the lord god took the man
[1:08:32] and put him into the garden of eden to
[1:08:35] dress it and to keep it
[1:08:39] his responsibility now watch this and
[1:08:41] the lord god
[1:08:42] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:08:45] of the garden
[1:08:46] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[1:08:48] of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:08:50] thou shall not eat of it for in the day
[1:08:52] that thou eat is thereof
[1:08:54] thou shalt surely die and the lord god
[1:08:57] said
[1:08:57] it is not good that the man should be
[1:09:00] alone i will make him make a helpmate
[1:09:02] for him
[1:09:03] and out of the ground the lord god
[1:09:05] formed every beast of the field
[1:09:07] and every fowl of the air and brought
[1:09:10] them unto
[1:09:11] adam to see what he would call them and
[1:09:14] whatsoever
[1:09:15] adam called every living thing that was
[1:09:17] the name thereof
[1:09:18] and adam gave names to all cattle and to
[1:09:21] the fowl of the air and to every beast
[1:09:23] of the field
[1:09:24] but for adam there was not found and
[1:09:26] helped meet for him
[1:09:28] now i want you to notice eve's not even
[1:09:32] on the scene right now
[1:09:34] she's not on the scene god is speaking
[1:09:37] and giving
[1:09:38] his message to the man
[1:09:42] are you hearing me now god is speaking
[1:09:44] directly
[1:09:45] to adam and he's in charging adam
[1:09:48] this is the thing that the lord hath
[1:09:50] commanded this is what
[1:09:52] god has said so here god is delivering
[1:09:55] his word to adam and remember what is
[1:09:59] god's word
[1:10:00] it is his presence it is
[1:10:03] life so god is setting a pattern here
[1:10:06] that in order for there to be
[1:10:08] real honor in the home and let me just
[1:10:10] kind of step back just for a minute i
[1:10:12] know sometimes
[1:10:13] we're speaking in situations and i'll
[1:10:14] get there in coming services but not
[1:10:16] tonight
[1:10:17] of even how that when you have spouses
[1:10:19] that are not believing
[1:10:21] a god has laid it out within his word
[1:10:23] and
[1:10:24] all of these things so that there can
[1:10:25] still be that of a real honor
[1:10:28] that would be there even within the home
[1:10:30] brother branham would deal with it
[1:10:31] countless number of times
[1:10:33] peter dealt with it paul dealt with it
[1:10:35] and i still believe that god
[1:10:36] is the same god tonight god is the one
[1:10:39] that will just invite him if we want
[1:10:41] honor in our home then we need to invite
[1:10:44] almighty god on the scene it's like
[1:10:47] elijah when elijah stood there there on
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:51] mount carmel that day brother in order
[1:10:54] for
[1:10:54] the fire to fall he had to do things
[1:10:57] according to
[1:10:58] the word that had been revealed to him
[1:11:00] when he would respond and act according
[1:11:03] to the word
[1:11:04] then the fire would come he he put
[1:11:06] things in order
[1:11:07] according to the word is that right
[1:11:10] and the fire of god came there that day
[1:11:13] it's such a pattern it shows that
[1:11:15] in everything in our life in our homes
[1:11:18] we want the pillar of fire to come down
[1:11:20] we want god to be present then there is
[1:11:23] a water and it's according
[1:11:25] to his word it invites the presence of
[1:11:28] almighty god
[1:11:28] because you and i both know that a
[1:11:30] letter alone ain't enough
[1:11:32] it's got to be the presence of the
[1:11:35] living god
[1:11:36] because it takes him to come and give
[1:11:38] life to that word
[1:11:40] that that word would become flesh just
[1:11:43] like
[1:11:43] god would walk down in the garden of
[1:11:46] eden the bible says
[1:11:47] the presence of the lord came
[1:11:50] walking down
[1:11:54] that word had been given to the man you
[1:11:56] see adam had been abiding
[1:12:00] in the presence of almighty god
[1:12:03] he's secure in boundaries of the word
[1:12:06] that's been given the boundaries had
[1:12:08] been given
[1:12:09] within the word is that right
[1:12:13] and yet here eve was not even around at
[1:12:15] that time
[1:12:17] under now watch under under this
[1:12:18] authority
[1:12:20] abiding in the presence of god you see
[1:12:22] this is very important
[1:12:24] there's a reason has god even in that
[1:12:27] part
[1:12:28] of a delay that in this time he's
[1:12:31] preparing
[1:12:32] the man he's he's setting everything in
[1:12:34] a place the man is abiding in his
[1:12:36] presence he's giving him the word
[1:12:38] now god begins to bring animal life to
[1:12:42] him
[1:12:42] and ask him what will you call this and
[1:12:45] adam begins to name them
[1:12:47] it wasn't adam just thinking things up
[1:12:50] or adam just pulling things and saying
[1:12:51] i wonder this in the name means a
[1:12:54] character
[1:12:55] is that right and what adam was
[1:12:57] expressing
[1:12:58] was exactly what god's mind and god's
[1:13:02] heart was in the situation
[1:13:04] this was god laying out a pattern of
[1:13:06] where a man
[1:13:07] should be even leading into that of a
[1:13:09] husband
[1:13:10] and where a husband is to be in order to
[1:13:12] bring honor in the home
[1:13:14] that that man is so close to god living
[1:13:17] in the presence of god
[1:13:18] there is spiritual discernment about his
[1:13:21] life
[1:13:22] to be able to catch things and be able
[1:13:24] to pick them up
[1:13:25] and be able to pull this out and pull
[1:13:27] that out let me tell you something
[1:13:28] that doesn't come outside of the word
[1:13:30] and the word itself i ain't just talking
[1:13:32] about quotes
[1:13:33] the word is the very person of jesus
[1:13:36] christ
[1:13:37] are you with me i'm not just talking
[1:13:40] about being around the message
[1:13:41] i'm talking about being in the word
[1:13:44] there's a difference in being
[1:13:46] around the message and saying i believe
[1:13:48] the word and being in the word
[1:13:50] to be in the word is to be baptized in
[1:13:53] by the holy ghost is that right you are
[1:13:56] now in the
[1:13:57] safety in the boundaries of god's word
[1:14:01] oh my he began to discern the
[1:14:03] characteristics why
[1:14:04] because as a husband is to discern
[1:14:07] characteristics
[1:14:09] it's to sit there when things are coming
[1:14:12] not go by their feelings but god holds a
[1:14:14] responsibility because
[1:14:15] sometimes maybe a wife would say well
[1:14:17] what about this and i feel this way
[1:14:19] she's works on a higher emotional level
[1:14:23] it's true i mean it's true
[1:14:26] so here is gotta be a word that's there
[1:14:30] there's gonna be a standard that's there
[1:14:33] now i want you to look at this here with
[1:14:35] the presence of god let me just read a
[1:14:37] few scriptures
[1:14:38] first first chronicles 16 25 for great
[1:14:41] is the lord and greatly to be praised
[1:14:43] he also is to be feared above all gods
[1:14:46] for all the gods of the people are idols
[1:14:48] but the lord made the heavens glory and
[1:14:51] honor
[1:14:52] are in his presence strength and
[1:14:54] gladness
[1:14:55] are in his place
[1:14:58] this is where what is there in his
[1:15:01] presence glory
[1:15:02] and honor in psalms 37 23 the steps of a
[1:15:05] good man
[1:15:06] are ordered by the lord and he
[1:15:08] delighteth
[1:15:09] in his way psalms 112
[1:15:12] 1 blessed is the man that feareth the
[1:15:15] lord
[1:15:15] that delighteth greatly in his
[1:15:18] commandments
[1:15:18] his seed shall be mighty upon the earth
[1:15:22] the generation of the upright shall be
[1:15:24] blessed wealth and riches shall be in
[1:15:26] his house
[1:15:26] and his righteousness endureth forever
[1:15:28] notice
[1:15:29] all of this comes out of from a man who
[1:15:32] greatly
[1:15:33] delights in the commandments of god
[1:15:38] oh my it takes a whole lot more to make
[1:15:40] a home than just a man and a woman
[1:15:44] are you with me in order for it to
[1:15:46] really be a home and
[1:15:48] really be a marriage it's got to be a
[1:15:50] life that is established
[1:15:52] upon the word of almighty god
[1:15:55] oh my think of this now in psalm 16.
[1:15:59] notice here that david let me just skip
[1:16:01] to verse 11
[1:16:02] thou wilt show me the path of life and
[1:16:04] in thy presence
[1:16:06] is fullness of joy at thy right hand
[1:16:09] there are pleasures
[1:16:10] forever more i mean who wouldn't want to
[1:16:13] be in the presence of god
[1:16:16] you see this is the responsibility of
[1:16:18] even of the man of the husband
[1:16:20] to where he's living in the presence of
[1:16:22] god and now
[1:16:24] it comes into a place eve's not even on
[1:16:26] the scene yet
[1:16:27] but you see he's already living in the
[1:16:29] presence of god
[1:16:30] there's a place that he's dwelling oh my
[1:16:34] it's not just important that he might
[1:16:36] have a place to take her
[1:16:38] but there should be one place that is
[1:16:41] more upset above
[1:16:42] everything else and that is to invite
[1:16:44] her
[1:16:45] into the presence of god that is upon
[1:16:48] his
[1:16:49] own life
[1:16:52] oh my can you say amen
[1:16:55] oh my this is where very important david
[1:16:59] think of how david
[1:17:00] when david would pray here the bible
[1:17:02] said david in first chronicles 29
[1:17:04] 10 david blessed the lord before all the
[1:17:06] congregation
[1:17:07] and david said blessed be thou lord god
[1:17:10] of israel our father forever and ever
[1:17:13] thine o lord is the greatness and the
[1:17:16] power and the glory and the victory
[1:17:18] and the majesty for all that is in the
[1:17:21] heaven and in the earth is thine
[1:17:23] that is the kingdom o lord and thou art
[1:17:26] exalted as
[1:17:27] head above all both riches
[1:17:30] and honor come of thee and thou reignest
[1:17:34] over all and in thine hand is power and
[1:17:36] might and in thy hand is to make great
[1:17:39] and to give strength unto all
[1:17:42] so the presence of god of the living god
[1:17:45] now has made a way
[1:17:48] adam has has come into this place
[1:17:51] and now here the bible goes on to say
[1:17:55] now
[1:17:55] in verse 21 of genesis 2 and the lord
[1:17:58] god caused
[1:17:59] a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
[1:18:02] slept
[1:18:03] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[1:18:06] up the flesh instead thereof
[1:18:08] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[1:18:10] from man
[1:18:11] made he a woman and brought her unto
[1:18:15] the man notice god's order
[1:18:18] the man has been in the presence of god
[1:18:21] now when it's time god deals with
[1:18:24] he lays the man to sleep and god brings
[1:18:28] then
[1:18:29] that woman that he has prepared for
[1:18:32] adam to adam is that right and adam said
[1:18:36] this is now bone of my bone and flesh of
[1:18:39] my
[1:18:40] flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:18:42] she was taken out of man
[1:18:44] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:18:46] and his mother and shall cleave
[1:18:48] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:18:52] flesh you know brother adam you'll hear
[1:18:55] him
[1:18:55] make this statement in invisible union
[1:18:58] marriage itself being the
[1:19:00] oldest institution in the bible or the
[1:19:03] oldest institution it's instituted by
[1:19:05] god
[1:19:06] when god married the first couple let me
[1:19:08] just read here just a little bit
[1:19:10] brother branham as he's given these vows
[1:19:12] these are the same things that we
[1:19:13] we would read as ministers and brother
[1:19:15] adam and i'm just going to read
[1:19:17] the part there to the groom he said well
[1:19:19] you have this woman to be your
[1:19:21] lawful wedded wife to live together in
[1:19:23] this holy state of matrimony
[1:19:25] do you promise to honor and love and
[1:19:28] cherish
[1:19:28] in sickness and health riches or poverty
[1:19:32] and will forsake all others and cleave
[1:19:34] the only unto her as long as you both
[1:19:36] live thinking of this in this manner
[1:19:39] because
[1:19:40] in every situation no matter what it is
[1:19:44] to love to honor and to cherish
[1:19:48] in the good times and in the bad times
[1:19:51] in the times of trial and in the times
[1:19:54] when
[1:19:54] there ain't no trial right
[1:19:57] it is it is companions it is that of a
[1:20:00] union that
[1:20:01] that god has brought together these are
[1:20:04] where things that
[1:20:05] you know there's testing times that come
[1:20:07] there's testings within
[1:20:08] in marriage and my goodness you know you
[1:20:11] you're two different people
[1:20:13] i don't care if you both are filled with
[1:20:15] the holy ghost you're two different
[1:20:16] people
[1:20:19] and the other thing that's very
[1:20:21] different i know not in this generation
[1:20:23] but it's very different the bible said
[1:20:25] god hath made a male
[1:20:27] and female
[1:20:30] sorry i don't think like a female my
[1:20:33] wife don't think like a male
[1:20:34] thank god be with me
[1:20:38] you see there's a different thought
[1:20:40] process there's different thinkings
[1:20:42] about things
[1:20:43] sometimes you know with with men
[1:20:45] sometimes we can tend to be a little bit
[1:20:46] more
[1:20:47] gruffer here there and and the woman
[1:20:49] team seems to be maybe
[1:20:51] a little bit more dainty you know with
[1:20:53] things and how she'll go about things
[1:20:55] you know and
[1:20:56] maybe you know they fall and get a cut
[1:20:58] and you know dad said get on in there
[1:20:59] and wash it out and put some you know
[1:21:00] peroxide on it
[1:21:01] mom said come here let me let me see
[1:21:02] that oh my look at hey honey you seen
[1:21:05] this you look at it yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:06] hey go go and get the peroxide on and
[1:21:07] put a band-aid there
[1:21:08] they're right in there
[1:21:14] something you know i'm talking about
[1:21:16] [Laughter]
[1:21:18] so there's there's differences a lot of
[1:21:19] differences you know there's a lot of
[1:21:21] differences
[1:21:22] but all those things are apart and and
[1:21:24] they're all necessary
[1:21:25] they're all complementary just like
[1:21:27] among the body
[1:21:28] when god had every one of the tribes in
[1:21:31] israel you know if you brought every one
[1:21:33] of those heads together
[1:21:34] they would look at things differently
[1:21:36] you could take the same problem
[1:21:38] and they would all look at it a little
[1:21:40] differently they would come from
[1:21:42] a certain perspective of what was laying
[1:21:45] within their character
[1:21:49] god has things that way just for a
[1:21:51] reason
[1:21:52] now you know when brother batman goes
[1:21:54] through this here and he's dealing
[1:21:56] with this perfect harmony and i want to
[1:21:58] just i want to read this here
[1:22:00] out of the message oneness brother brad
[1:22:03] talks about he says this first man and
[1:22:05] first woman
[1:22:06] in the garden of eden was in perfect
[1:22:08] harmony with god
[1:22:10] so much that god could come down at any
[1:22:13] time
[1:22:14] he desired and talked lip to ear with
[1:22:17] adam and eve isn't that wonderful
[1:22:19] it was in that place now you might say
[1:22:22] well brother samuel
[1:22:22] it's just me it's just me that's in
[1:22:25] contact with god
[1:22:26] it's just me that has that oneness with
[1:22:28] god where his life
[1:22:30] is dwelling within me then you know what
[1:22:32] god's got a conduit
[1:22:34] a channel a place that your life you
[1:22:37] said no matter what's going on
[1:22:39] my life is reserved for a place if it
[1:22:41] hadn't been for me
[1:22:42] god wouldn't come to this home but
[1:22:44] because i'm here it's a channel
[1:22:46] for god to come down
[1:22:51] any time he was in such harmony god
[1:22:53] could just
[1:22:54] he could just come down at any time and
[1:22:57] just talk to him lip to hear
[1:23:00] what a fellowship notice he says that's
[1:23:02] perfect oneness god
[1:23:03] and his creation god speaking lip to ear
[1:23:06] with adam and eve and they were so
[1:23:08] perfect in harmony with god till they
[1:23:11] were one with god
[1:23:12] and god and his family was one and man
[1:23:15] in his family
[1:23:17] a correct good noble obedient
[1:23:21] family is one with another
[1:23:24] any family if there's something in the
[1:23:26] family that moves them apart
[1:23:29] then it's not right the family's broken
[1:23:32] somewhere they should all be one
[1:23:35] father with mother mother with father
[1:23:38] children with parent
[1:23:39] parent with children all in agreement
[1:23:41] and when you see that
[1:23:43] you'll see one lovely picture
[1:23:48] that's god's desire is that that
[1:23:52] agreement that
[1:23:53] father with mother mother with father
[1:23:56] and and then as he says
[1:23:57] children now you and i all we know know
[1:23:59] that but that's not just something that
[1:24:01] somebody
[1:24:02] just waves the one and my we just all
[1:24:05] are in agreement
[1:24:07] it's like when i was teaching you okay
[1:24:09] now you tell someone so you're sorry you
[1:24:11] tell someone so you're sorry and this
[1:24:13] and that and one more
[1:24:15] you knew turn your back and put them on
[1:24:17] the playground they'll be fighting and
[1:24:18] fussing again
[1:24:20] right it's back to the same thing
[1:24:22] because just in that event that thing
[1:24:24] like that
[1:24:24] it don't resolve anything but in order
[1:24:27] for there to be an agreement come about
[1:24:29] don't want it for there to be agreement
[1:24:31] there's got to be concessions
[1:24:34] is that right there's got to be
[1:24:36] submitting that's and that's how the
[1:24:38] word works in our life
[1:24:39] the word doesn't come in our life and
[1:24:41] grab us you know in a headlock
[1:24:43] and god says now i'm your husband and
[1:24:45] this is what you're going to do
[1:24:46] god doesn't operate like that he
[1:24:48] operates over the church
[1:24:50] of the living god by his love by his
[1:24:52] spirit
[1:24:53] and that's how god brings you and i into
[1:24:56] harmony with what he
[1:24:57] desires in our life let me just say this
[1:25:00] to you
[1:25:00] god sometimes will deal with your life a
[1:25:03] week or weeks ahead of time
[1:25:05] to get your heart and everything ready
[1:25:07] for when the word will come forth here
[1:25:09] and god might bring correction in your
[1:25:11] life but god
[1:25:12] knows what's needed in order for you to
[1:25:15] receive it
[1:25:18] that's how attentive god is he loves to
[1:25:21] come down
[1:25:22] and talk with his children and there is
[1:25:24] an agreement that god likes to have
[1:25:26] a unity
[1:25:30] now the one thing we don't can we do not
[1:25:32] there's no concessions on the word
[1:25:35] are you with me we're not talking about
[1:25:37] concessions on the word
[1:25:39] the word is the standard we hold that of
[1:25:41] the word
[1:25:42] but i want you to remember the word
[1:25:44] itself just what we're preaching here
[1:25:46] the word is a display even in
[1:25:49] the home and in the lives
[1:25:53] this is why that even in the midst of it
[1:25:55] of how
[1:25:56] peter would write of it paul would write
[1:25:58] of it of even the testimony
[1:26:00] that would be present in the life of a
[1:26:02] husband in the life of a wife
[1:26:04] so much that titus himself would write
[1:26:07] of how things and the conduct
[1:26:09] would be and he would write it in this
[1:26:10] manner that the word of god
[1:26:12] be not blasphemed why
[1:26:16] because we recognize there's such a
[1:26:18] reality that god desires
[1:26:20] for our heart to be in agreement and to
[1:26:22] express
[1:26:23] his word i'm glad that god is
[1:26:26] mindful of our needs i'm glad that god
[1:26:29] desires that things
[1:26:30] would operate in agreement in our lives
[1:26:34] aren't you this is god's desire for our
[1:26:37] lives now let's look here
[1:26:39] he says that's god's purpose and his
[1:26:41] purpose
[1:26:42] as father supreme was to be one with his
[1:26:46] family
[1:26:46] earthly family adam and eve and the only
[1:26:49] way they could
[1:26:50] be one with the family or with god was
[1:26:52] because god's nature was in them
[1:26:55] so that made them with god's nature in
[1:26:57] them
[1:26:58] then with each other and god they become
[1:27:01] all one
[1:27:02] well he said isn't that a beautiful
[1:27:03] picture god in his family
[1:27:05] father over all supreme no death
[1:27:08] no sorrow no heartaches no nothing
[1:27:11] just joy unspeakable never to be sick
[1:27:15] never to have a heartache just one with
[1:27:18] god what a picture
[1:27:19] because the very nature of god was in
[1:27:22] those people
[1:27:24] and therefore what they did they
[1:27:26] followed just in line with god and god
[1:27:28] with them made them
[1:27:30] one god
[1:27:34] was invited in god think of this how
[1:27:38] adam
[1:27:38] adam dwelling in the presence of
[1:27:40] almighty god then
[1:27:42] here eve comes in of
[1:27:45] just the atmosphere that that that was
[1:27:47] there within
[1:27:49] that of the garden of eden how god had
[1:27:51] set
[1:27:52] all of that place you know when we look
[1:27:55] at this here
[1:27:56] you find that in in the scripture of how
[1:27:59] noah and let me just i'll just close on
[1:28:01] this one here
[1:28:03] the bible says in hebrews 11 verse 7
[1:28:06] by faith noah being warned of god
[1:28:10] of things not seen as yet moved with
[1:28:13] fear
[1:28:14] and prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:28:16] house
[1:28:17] by the which he condemned the world and
[1:28:19] became heir
[1:28:20] of the righteousness which is by faith
[1:28:25] once again just as god spoke to noah
[1:28:29] you find god speaks to abraham god
[1:28:32] speaks god delivers
[1:28:34] his word in that manner
[1:28:37] that here of what is taking place
[1:28:41] and then through that word that has come
[1:28:43] how that
[1:28:44] that noah in himself would be would be
[1:28:47] moved by the spirit of god
[1:28:49] to think here with his children and his
[1:28:51] family everything that was going on
[1:28:53] how it had an effect upon the whole
[1:28:56] household
[1:28:57] you see there wasn't things that no
[1:29:00] doubt there might be times that we could
[1:29:01] go back where
[1:29:02] you know noah might have had to say this
[1:29:04] to his son or say this or say that
[1:29:06] but you see there was an effect what was
[1:29:08] the effect that was in his life
[1:29:10] it was the presence of god that at times
[1:29:14] that even when
[1:29:15] his children or his family maybe they
[1:29:18] couldn't see
[1:29:18] everything but you see there was an
[1:29:20] effect of the presence
[1:29:22] of god that was within his life that it
[1:29:25] had an effect there in that home
[1:29:27] it was it brought honor that was there
[1:29:29] it brought on or invited the presence of
[1:29:32] god
[1:29:32] to come in there there was an honor that
[1:29:34] was between
[1:29:36] one another and it invited god's
[1:29:38] presence to come down
[1:29:41] you see when we look at this here in the
[1:29:43] word
[1:29:45] this is why when you look at how in the
[1:29:48] scriptures
[1:29:49] when it says when the holy ghost when he
[1:29:52] has come
[1:29:53] the spirit of truth he will lead and
[1:29:56] guide us
[1:29:57] into all truth
[1:30:01] is that right he leads us into all truth
[1:30:05] and you saw god god never he never
[1:30:09] intended anything outside
[1:30:11] of his spirit of his life to lead
[1:30:15] the church of the living god
[1:30:18] when things came in in the garden that
[1:30:20] was wrong
[1:30:22] and notice notice how the enemy came the
[1:30:25] enemy he did not come
[1:30:27] to adam he came to the woman
[1:30:30] is that right hey let's just look at it
[1:30:32] now as an entire bride of jesus christ
[1:30:34] where does the enemy he comes to try to
[1:30:37] tempt you
[1:30:38] he comes to try to say things against
[1:30:40] you he comes to try to bring all kinds
[1:30:43] of
[1:30:43] accusations is that right because
[1:30:46] the real man on the inside cannot be
[1:30:50] tempted the real man on the inside the
[1:30:54] real son and daughter of god
[1:30:56] is an overcomer born by that overcoming
[1:30:58] life
[1:31:00] amen is that right but you see god never
[1:31:03] intended
[1:31:04] for the woman to lead
[1:31:08] god intended for the man to lead
[1:31:12] god intended that's why even when we
[1:31:14] look at the very simple things
[1:31:16] of the marriage covenant who's the first
[1:31:18] one that enters the door
[1:31:21] the man comes in because he is the
[1:31:24] initiator
[1:31:26] are you with me it follows the same
[1:31:29] pattern that was there i'm talking about
[1:31:30] honor
[1:31:31] bringing honor in the home honor begins
[1:31:34] with the word the presence of god
[1:31:38] because just like david we read here in
[1:31:40] the scriptures glory and honor
[1:31:42] riches all everything joy it comes from
[1:31:46] the presence of god
[1:31:48] direction it comes from the presence of
[1:31:50] god
[1:31:51] it's the word of god it it's not
[1:31:53] something in our homes that
[1:31:55] we look for a different way how do i
[1:31:57] handle this problem
[1:31:58] we realize problems in every situation
[1:32:02] is to be handled by the word
[1:32:05] is that right sometimes it's not
[1:32:07] altogether a scripture that you can find
[1:32:09] it's the character of our life of how to
[1:32:13] handle that
[1:32:15] my goodness
[1:32:28] i'm just going to stop here there's just
[1:32:30] too much i can't i can't
[1:32:31] lay more of this in here but god
[1:32:35] intended
[1:32:35] god intended for the man and i know
[1:32:38] sometimes we look and say brother samuel
[1:32:39] you preach on the men an awful lot
[1:32:42] i'm don't worry we'll get we'll come on
[1:32:44] down
[1:32:46] but you see it's very important
[1:32:49] it's very important because in this in
[1:32:52] this hour
[1:32:54] i'm at my face i can put my glasses on
[1:32:55] so i can see you
[1:32:57] in this hour in this time we're living
[1:32:59] in
[1:33:01] it's hard to find men
[1:33:05] and i'm not just talking about somebody
[1:33:07] who you know prefers women
[1:33:09] i'm talking about a man sorry to
[1:33:12] speak so straight but i've got to speak
[1:33:14] straight it's hard to find a man that
[1:33:17] would that stands up and takes
[1:33:20] responsibility come on
[1:33:22] it's a man that is making preparations
[1:33:25] for life
[1:33:27] instead in this day and age that we live
[1:33:29] in this is very much scripture
[1:33:30] instead in this day and age we live in
[1:33:32] you find many times where
[1:33:34] men and there and here they are men and
[1:33:36] they can be ever so old and they're
[1:33:38] still boys
[1:33:40] it's a time of responsibility to take
[1:33:44] responsibility for things
[1:33:46] to to to make room for things that even
[1:33:49] that are coming in because it doesn't
[1:33:50] just happen with a light switch
[1:33:52] overnight things just don't take place
[1:33:56] overnight but it's making preparation
[1:33:59] it's laying all those things just as
[1:34:00] brother branham would tell us about
[1:34:02] he said we don't know how long god will
[1:34:04] tarry and he speaks to the fathers and
[1:34:06] the husbands and he says
[1:34:07] we must make arrangements for our
[1:34:09] children
[1:34:10] that are coming on because it's such a
[1:34:13] it's such an hour you and i know in this
[1:34:16] hour let me just tell you something
[1:34:17] you already know this we're out here the
[1:34:20] things that are even
[1:34:21] have been in our schools things that are
[1:34:23] coming into our schools
[1:34:24] and a lot of these things they want
[1:34:26] taught and everything else that's out
[1:34:28] there
[1:34:28] i tell you there has to be a standard
[1:34:30] that's in the home you cannot
[1:34:32] allow the schools to raise your children
[1:34:36] you can't allow those things it's got to
[1:34:39] be a presence that's right there
[1:34:41] that raises them up that lets them know
[1:34:44] this is what a man is this is what a
[1:34:46] real lady is
[1:34:48] it's honor in the home
[1:34:51] invites the presence of god invites him
[1:34:55] into the home
[1:34:56] amen i know that wasn't shouting from
[1:35:00] the rooftops but i
[1:35:01] it's okay sometimes there's things
[1:35:04] that's needed and correction i never get
[1:35:06] excited when i have to correct my own
[1:35:07] kids
[1:35:09] but they'll look at it
