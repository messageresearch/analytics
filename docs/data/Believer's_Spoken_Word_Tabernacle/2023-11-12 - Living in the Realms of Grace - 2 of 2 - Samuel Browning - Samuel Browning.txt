TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is what I say that though Israel could not hear it here but remember those trumpets were supernaturally sounded so the spirit of God going out throughout the Earth and that's why it that's what it is that begin to cause you to yearn to desire you might have had your start at an altar in some Mission somewhere or some church but listen what it is the spirit of God come and begin to draw upon your heart and it's something that you could not where you were and you might say well brother Samuel I was born and raised in a message church now you're talking my language I was as well but you recognize that still there had to come a moment where God begin to stir what he had placed on the inside that there's got to be something more than just knowing what's right just believing this message but there's got to be something more what is it it's the spirit of understanding the spirit of Truth the quickening power that's drawing upon that part of himself on the inside and we can never be satisfied with anything less than Christ so here we are standing in the end time when the ages are finishing and a bride of Jesus Christ the Bible says the Lamb's wife is on Earth and he is manifested himself according to his word think of it think of it the countless number the tapes you and I listen to the messages and how many of them with the things that were said in a manner of oh you know oh this gift oh this precious gift all this gift but they missed the revealing of the son of man the gift was not the emphasis but the gift was only to manifest and to declare that he is now here he's here in the fullness and the Fulfillment of his word but there's a people that were ordained to it elected to it that the grace of God catches our lives and it draws Us in this place and here he is in his fullness in a people she's under her husband the word and she's bringing forth children unto the Lord I wanted just looking at this living in the Realms of Grace in this hour I certainly believe that that's where God has called for us to live we find the the the the the the admonition in the scripture that we have been orain gain to live in Heavenly places is that right it's just like this I and I'm I'm going to say something that is a supposed to but that might be serve as a little example here in this area we supposedly elect people to represent us in another place supposedly okay I know that's a big supposed but it is now don't get caught up on that but the people that we elect are to be a representative before a body and decisions that are made are to be in our best interest let me just say this when we speak about being in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are speaking about that representation that we had before the foundation of the world yes sir where the Bible says where the sons of God shouted for Joy that's right is that right absolutely we are speaking of that to where that even when John himself would see his name what was John seeing it's the author name are you hearing me we're speaking of that representation like you would go and you would call whoever I don't even know who it is whoever a representative is for this area you would call them and say hey uh can you do something about the parks down here but you see we we recognize this is something so far greater because our representation is Before the Throne of God but there had to be somebody to connect us back to that representation somebody who could span the breach somebody who could take take away the Gap somebody who could bring that reality of thy will be done in in Earth even as it is in heaven right when I go somewhere else there's times where you know you go to another Nation they can say tell you're American by the way you walk I don't know I mean I don't know about that oh that's true but well listen how much more greater right here we're of a greater Kingdom we're not of an Earthly Kingdom we might stand here in these different citizenships and so forth but we are of another kingdom we've been born of the spirit of God into that Kingdom and our lives here are to reflect in this earth that other Kingdom so we're tied back into that representation we're tied back in being represented in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that's where we live that's our Authority living in the Realms of Grace now I want to just deal with this in terms of of that in law and Grace and I want you just to keep that thought in mind because when we're looking at this here in the Scripture it says a woman clothed with the sun and we know that that's the gospel that's Christ and the moon under her feet and above her head a crown of stars so she's living in the realm of Grace Above the Law we want to get to that here in a moment in Galatians 3:21 Paul lay lays us out in this time here with with with that of uh in the galatian church is the law then against the promises of God God forbid now we all know what the law is Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not but he says if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe but before Faith came that's faith is the absolute essential necessity before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up in unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed we were in a prison house the law was there expressing we are guilty right Paul said I had not known sin L there was the law right I mean it's like how many have well don't raise your hand but you know you've been up and down sometimes a Road thank God for the GPS's that you have on right now times I'm other places I'm looking you know I pull that up and I want to know what's the speed limit here cuz sometimes you get in a place and there's no signs on what the speed limit is good luck trying to tell the officer I didn't know what the speed was good luck with that one right but you're recognize that this here the law was to point out that we that we are guilty but notice this we where the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith so the law wasn't all bad there was a shadow so there was a measure of light but it was a school Master to bring us unto Christ right now notice that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school Master for ye are all children all for you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise in Romans 3:31 Paul said do we then make void the law through faith God forbid yay we establish the law remember God's desire was and he made a promise Ezekiel Jeremiah and he made this promise to the house of Israel but we know that it had that it was coming to that of the Gentiles where God said I will write my laws and my statutes upon your heart and in your minds and I'll remember your sin no more God made a promise that he would do that man could copy the law but God made a promise that I'm the one solely reserved the right that I will inscript this my own law my word on your heart and in your mind so coming to a place to think of this that even when the Lord Jesus when he come remember when he come even even Paul afterwards this is where Paul is even referring to this it it's so misunderstood when the Fulfillment of the word comes to many look at as though it's trying to take away from what was already there but Jesus said I am not come to destroy the law or the prophets see the Fulfillment of it you we would think in our minds you would think though the Fulfillment of it it's just going to make sense but remember the Fulfillment of it is just as Supernatural as the god supernaturally moved upon the prophets and spoke it and God speaks it and here is a time and a season for it to be fulfilled there's all types of ways that it that man can get in his mind and maybe it'll be this way and maybe it'll be that way and we know that that was there but what was greater than all of the ways that could be thought is that down on the inside like the little woman at the well like Simeon like Anna they were able to catch the expression of the Fulfillment of the word they did not see the word as this fulfillment as taking away from the law and the prophets oh my you see a with the scripture this is here's God coming coming down almighty God coming down changing his mask great Jehovah God Spirit now changing his Mas he was in portion in part in the prophets is that right when he stood there and he asked them who do you say I am some say you're Jeremiah some Elias some Moses some on and on but notice they inart not in the fullness but in part it was Christ being revealed through each of their lives right now within that how God himself coming down and he takes and he changes his mask and now you and I were standing in need of a kinsman redeemer we were standing in one we we could not pay the price we could not satisfy the debt but God himself changed his mask amen he came down and took upon a body on himself and he paid the price for you and I that that life might come to you and I that we could become fully manifested Sons and Daughters of God this is why we hear this establishing of the law this is why Jesus could say and is expressed through David in Psalms 40 but he says I Delight to do thy will oh God yay thy law is within my heart that's that's good this could never be before this could never be before this is speaking this is now coming God restoring and is restoring it by himself where God would take his own laws upon himself is that right David you know could say I bind him on my finger I bind him on the fringes all of that had a tight but it could never be in the heart Hallelujah because this is a sovereign work of almighty God Amen that's right where God comes in and God sets in the midst of the Throne of our life this is why his expression back there when he told Moses he told the rest of Israel let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them he didn't say let them make me a tabernacle let them make me a sanctuary the sanctuary is the innermost sanctum the innermost place because God himself was calling for let them oh my they could only surrender what they have and you and I can only surrender what we have you might say what gift do I have let me tell you what the prophet said in things that are to be he said that real gift on the inside of you is that soul that came from God that can be surrendered to God and God can take that life and so impregnate that life with his presence and bring forth a son and daughter of God that bears His image thy the law thy law is within my heart think of this in Matthew 17 I I'm just I'm moving here very quickly but remember on Matthew 17 there were three Earthly witnesses that were taken up to mount's Transfiguration and there was three Heavenly Witnesses let me just read this in verse one and after six days Jesus taken Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain Mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his rment was white as the light what is this this is the adoption it's an adoption Ceremony this is why that even as the prophet would would bring us and emphasize in this hour that we're living in brother Brown countless times would preach hear you him then coming into the adoption series I'm I'm going this way as he's leading purposely that as he would deal with that there's more to it than just being born of his Spirit meaning that more than just repentance it's more than just sanctification right but it's to be adopted or placed to where his life comes on the inside that's it's an adoption it's a moment it's listen the Holy Spirit has been given out throughout the ages is that right because you could look back and say well the holy spirit's been given throughout the ages but it was a portion in the Ephesian age a portion all the way down through was a portion but in the end time we are not promised a portion but we are promised he himself who is the gift amen the person of Jesus Christ let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come How can there be a marriage if there's no groom but he's here declaring himself and he's calling to Hearts to unite with him that's him it's not just a portion so here we are standing in a time where a word here even as the word serving as our school Master do you realize that even within every one of our lives even uh lives that can be in Journey right here this morning the word itself if you haven't fully received the the spirit of God to come into that place of adoption where it's Christ in you do you realize the word is given as a school Master to teach you it's not there to put you down but it's there to guide you in the right way before the fire could come down on Mount on Mount Carmel the the stones had to be put in order is that right right how did how did Elijah know how to put the stones in order well he was a prophet okay but how he said I have done all of this according to Thy word now the scriptures we read in Galatians 3 said we were shut up unto this faith we were shut up we were kept back from it you see it takes a faith to even respond and believe God's word it takes Faith to First recognize in your life that I'm a sinner and I need God it takes Faith to recognize that I need God now what is it it's God moving upon your faith to draw you and bring you to a place to where he can step in and it's no longer your faith alone because your faith or my faith will give out in times but his faith it cannot give out his faith holds you when your faith come on Friends pulled up next to brother brandham asked him and said Billy he said how you holding your religion now he said it ain't holding me he said that I ain't holding it he said but it's holding me it's something that's real that it's him it's Christ it's a living God that's holding me that's stabilizing my life that's giving me strength and see that in itself in When Faith even its initial places comes it starts as a love affair I mean if you start talking to a young lady young man and there's not something there's not some sort of an attraction or some something you can see a substance then what are you doing talking to them well that got quiet but it's true there's going to be a reason or purpose it's not just playing around you see this is why the prophet said in Christ the mystery he said who does he reveal himself to not flirters not flirters but lives that desire to know him Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments and we will come and make our Abode in your life so it's simple obedience to the word of God that takes faith it's Faith to recognize he's calling you calling he's dealing with your life it's God touching our hearts it's God drawing us so here we come into this place of Matthew 17 and here at verse three let me get back to this behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord is it good for us to be here he got excited didn't he if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias Elijah while he spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him I like how brother Ram says this brother Ram said before he could get it out he said the voice spoke and shut him up he wanted to make three Tabernacles Peter was all excited I mean my think about it here you are and you see Moses standing there you see Elijah you've only heard about them right but here you are seeing them you say how did they know it the prophet said because at that moment under that presence under that inspiration they knew who they were can I preach for a moment he said you might be wondering how will I recognize my dad how will I recognize my mom he said you will recognize them when they raised because of the inspiration of the moment you'll know your loved ones maybe it's one that's died as a little baby passed on how will I know them oh my you won't need a computer generated program you won't need an app to know Hallelujah the inspiration of the moment will make it known to you the point is to be found ready watching looking and that understanding poured out within that moment just as it is right now that you understand this is a moment this is an hour this is a Time Christ is Among Us and I'm one of his children that same understanding so to think of it where Moses you know I'm glad I'm glad that these Tabernacles were not built because the law only put us in jail is that right the law only put us in jail and the prophets were there as God's justice to execute judgment when the law says you're guilty and the prophets came to execute judgment is that right but here notice the focus and the attention here this is my beloved Son hear ye him where one who has met all the requirements one who has satisfied the debt amen what was needed in order for man to go free because we couldn't live by the law I mean we could but we couldn't it wasn't God's perfect will God's perfect will is that it would be and reside in the heart of a people his own life moving through you and I but notice because even as David would write things David knew the prophet said he was missing something in his life he knew there was something Beyond oh my don't you love him and to think of this but how that Christ was Mercy the law put you in jail but it couldn't get you out the prophets is God's justice to condemn you and kill you forth but Jesus was God's love and re Revelation to to let you know as a predestinated seed that he had called you this is him hear ye him now I don't want to just go back there to where we have to go back prior to Calvary but remember prior to Calvary this statement is made this is my beloved Son hear ye him and he hadn't even been smitten yet it was prophecy the sacrifice that'll be offered up it will be smitten and hear ye him he's going to speak Liberty will come Jubilee is going to be called calling you and I back to a rightful position and here he is he begins to speak he enters into a bright body enters into a life and it begins to Paul say and here we stand in this hour a mount Transfiguration experience a time of adoption where Sons and Daughters of God come into manifestation to reflect the Living God standing here adorned in his reignment the son the righteousness the glory of God the son and notice even of here of this where we read in our opening chapter and to think about here this woman is crowned having 12 stars on her head the doctrines of the Apostle this is why that anything that outside of accepting the full word of God is not the bride anything less than the doctrine because the church is built on the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets is that right where the what the scriptures taught what the word taught that's why we we stand it's not just something we say is a cliche of say well I believe the Bible we are Bible Believers We Believe believe all the word of God the Bible said blessed are they who do and keep all his Commandments for they shall have right to life is that right it's not just part it's not just not just fragments it's not just what we like but I'm thankful to God God has delivered us from the Ingenuity of man and man's reasoning and Theology and brought us to a living presence of a living God that we can know him and there is not one thing in the Bible not one word of God where our soul cannot punctuate amen if there's anything in here anything that where your heart draws back check your spirit and say God bring me to that place to where I can stand there and say Amen to every word of God hallelujah hallelujah that's what God does that's where he brings us to and this is why the prophet would say just to just to think of this we are what we are right now this moment because the grace of God has appeared to us if God's grace had not appeared to us now I may have got your attention some way or another but let me say it what it all comes back to is God calling you as an individual me to a personal relationship with him that's what it all comes back to to where he's living his own life through you and I oh what what would we have been we'd have still been Sinners we'd have still been under the wrath of God we would have still been walking with a I trust everything's all right I hope everything's all right but God's brought us certainty in this hour the word that God has delivered in this hour listen friends when we talk about the lamb taking the book it's all about the person of Jesus Christ it's God himself coming down Among Us there's no greater certainty than his voice he said my sheep know my voice and a sheep longs to hear his voice yes sir I'm not looking for something that you know that man will Pat me on the back and go along with me and tell me what a good guy I am I I want a word that brings Assurance in my life a word that I know where I'm standing and not just know where I'm standing but I can live I can move as a son and daughter of God and I'm going to say the grace of God Has Lifted Us in this hour to a rightful position it's pointed out to you and I that there is a blood to take care of every sin stain that When sin is confessed and it goes in the bleach goes in the Clorox of God if I can say it the blood of Jesus Christ and that person cannot come out the same way again it changes you it changes your life it transforms your life now just to confess We Believe something won't do it there can be a start but I'm telling you the God has called you and I to a place as Sons and Daughters of God where his own life is living through you and I let me just say this that is something that your mom your dad or or the prophet even Jesus Christ standing right here and I believe he is speaking through our vessel through our lives this morning but he cannot create or bring about and cause you to all of a sudden to want it that's got to be something that rises within your heart amen he brings that desperation is that right his presence moving among us but without desperation where are we at oh my think of the Prophet just listening to this week and in the message I heard but now I see they're in the first part of the week brother Brown talking and I Marvel when I go back across that where hady Wright was standing there and she remember she hears the report about those squirrels being spoken into existence now brother brandham goes in to tell us he'll tell in different stories but those two boys were over there laughing at him right are you hearing me right they were laughing at him but then she's at that moment here's where she heard her here's where she stood steady she stood steady at that moment as a Believer God knew God knew the needs of her of her boys God knew those needs but at that moment here it drops down in that moment that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon amen and at that moment brother Brandon says super anointing dropped down in the room you see how powerful it is to agree with the word of God you see how powerful it is to be in a place that even when as we come into the house of God and we're walking daily not just when we're here but to be in that place to be a channel where inspiration can drop down God provides a way for that now I think of that those two boys brother BR says here they were over here laughing cutting up my I wonder I wonder how many of us would have just put him out what I'm trying to show you is is that listen in order for something to take place it took the supernatural to move on their hearts their actions and responses was as much in opposition to what was going to be asked for and sister hady right said ask whatever you want and brother R mentioned that to her and she said I want the salvation of my boy brother B said at that moment they fell across turn lap gave their heart to God and were filled with the Holy Ghost what happened the atmosphere changed so it brings me back to this place and this point God has to change the atmosphere that's why it's not just coming and receiving the Holy Ghost upon our life but God it's getting into that of the place of the word yes am man entering into the spirit of God and allowing the spirit of God to affect our lives let me tell you something don't hold back to the end of the service don't let the devil get on your shoulder and say well you're not worthy you're not there you're not this you've got to enter into the atmosphere you've got to get into the word that's what this word is being ministered it's a word of life it's a word of the glory of God it's a word that says you are Sons and Daughters of God it's God that changes the atmosphere God that changes the heart I want you to think of this grace that you and I are standing in In This Moment Paul says in Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God in 1 Peter 5:12 Peter writes it like this Bas sylvenus a faithful brother the end of the quote scripture exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand so to be above the law I know that's very simple but to be above the law Paul said Galatians 5:18 if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law brother bandam simply takes it like this in the uh latter part of that of that scripture or that that quote in the mark of the beast seal of God part two he says so through the true Seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ which is the grace of God and no more law to it no sir laws not connected with it at all you're above the law over the law it's love love is above the law Grace law came by Moses Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ in the message then Jesus came and called he said the law was for the Jews years ago today we're in the Realms of Grace We're living Above the Law a man that's living in Grace has no law there's no law for Grace oh my he said how can you condemn me for running a stoplight here which the city has done give me a right to run any stoplight I wish to you couldn't there's no law to condemn me so as long as I'm in Christ I'm free from the law I'm above the law because I'm in his grace what's he talking about in his life in Christ he's put that confidence in me that I won't do anything that's wrong or he wouldn't give me gra give me that Grace that's what he does to you the same way we in his grace this is the true grace of God it's not we in Grace and you know God doesn't care about how it it no the this that's not the grace of God at all that's disgrace that's what that's what Jude wrote that there were men men who crept in unawares turning the grace of our God into obviousness but there is a true grace of God where a Heart Is Made free from where how is it made free from bondage it wasn't remember the scriptures God didn't do away with the law he fulfills the law and the same one who gave the law now comes and lives inside of your life and it's him living out his own life your nature that was against the law that was against the word that nature has been done away with don't you understand the new birth is not God cleaning a person up and saying I'm going to marry you the new birth is God killing the old man that's why he can remember your sins no more you look in the mirror and you remember yourself as a sinner but God sees who you have been a whole time a son and daughter of God and that's what the quickening power came to raise up what did that the grace of God not law the grace of God Romans 8 can I have a few more moments Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus we passed judgment's been passed he that hear my words and believeth on him is me has passed from Death unto life when they put the blood on the lentil and the post of the door the Lamb's blood being applied was signified death has already come here there's one that's taken the place and the Death Angel passed right over and that's why to be a partaker of the Holy Spirit it shows that you have been identified in the shedding of the blood it's a token hallu the token that gives us Grace to move beyond the living or the dead works of man dead Creeds of man come on friends I was like that even as a young boy of things I got to do this I got to do that and you got to do this and you got to do that listen it's something deeper it's deeper than I've got to do this and I got to do that oh I got to make sure everything's just right brother so and so they might see me here or sister so and so it's deeper than that amen it's got to be something to where you realize whether brother or sister so and so are around or not God is always around and it has to come to a place that your desire is to please him watch this who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what's he speaking of the nature on the inside you're not walking after that first nature you're walking after the spirit in other words he is your aim he is your goal for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness look at this that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us so as the law was fulfilled in him so is the word fulfilled with in The Bride of Jesus Christ that's why a person say well you know how I I I can't live that well of course you can it's got to take Christ on the inside of you so don't let the devil beat you up or try to put it out that it's got to be you doing it but just invite him fall in love with him when you begin to fall in love with him the things that seem hard and difficult that you look about laying this side laying that aside and let me just put this real clear I'm not just talking their lives right now that are coming to the Holy Ghost but lives that are already in the Holy Spirit it takes a real love affair of us laying aside our reasoning us laying aside everything around of where we maybe have responded in certain ways and it takes the love of God so moving in our lives because who's our goal he's our goal that's who we want to please right it's like the little the boy who played the piano oh they were clapping clapping clapping on here and he came and looked straight up in the balcony oh what's he doing the master was in the balcony all this was fine but the master he wanted to know what did his master say amen that's what we're looking and we're not looking to the Applause of men hallelujah we're looking at what does he say is that right so we're not controlled by fear but by love cuz fear had torment God God's desire is to bring you to settled places in our lives for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we're the children of God Romans 2:13 for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified I want that word to so drop is that your desire amen you see we come and we hear the word and what an atmosphere that the word itself brings and my how encouragement the challenging but God comes by our way that that word might drop down in our lives say God let it drop down within me Let It Drop down in my life Lord let the word like the rain I you know there's times in the summer we were blessed this summer with rain ah we really were but there's been other times you know how it is we say we're getting rain and all you can say is the ground's so dry I hope it's not I hope it's not a heavy rain all at once because you know that Heavy Rain ain't going to do much good it's just going to run off erosion and stuff just runs right off but Lord let it be a steady rain a rain that comes down I don't care if it rains all day and it might rain the same amount that it would rain rain within just minutes but if it just rains a steady Mist throughout all day it allows it to do what soak in that's why as we give ourselves to the word of God that's why as you're hearing certain messages quoted from that's why you're hearing certain scriptures that's why even as we leave the house of God even we're here Lord let it settle down lord for the rain cometh to water amen is that right what is what is that rign his thoughts my ways my thoughts are above yours Lord let him let them saturate down here just let it keep on Sat even when we walk out let it keep saturated let it let it just drop Lord for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts now let let me just read I want a couple more scriptures than I want to read here of quote in closing in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines for it is good it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which are not profited them that that have occupied therein that the heart be established with Grace that's let me just say this that's God's objective is that our heart be established in Grace and let me just say it like this let me just let me read this let me read this quote here there's much more it could be said brother brandham here in the message he says paragraph 140 there law having a shadow he said when God brought is brought out brought out is an Israelite Abraham believed God he said I was talking to a very outstanding one of the greatest Christian leaders in the world today one of the greatest Pastor Bose and I in the room the other day speaking on that see it's not what we did it's what Christ did it isn't what I'm going to do it's what he's done already now I believe in Reading I believe in praying right that's something that draws upon our heart but I'll tell you right now I've been serving God for many years it hadn't gotten no easier My Flesh has never come to a spot and said hey come on let's go pray brother Crest has it got any easier no my flesh has never come to a spot and said hey let's just sit down and listen to a message no my flesh hasn't done that so it's got to be something deeper than my flesh brother Samuel what is that it's overcoming where we have to overcome and press beyond what we feel that's true is that right right so it isn't what I'm going to do it's what he's done already so it you know it's like this right here let me just say it like this if even if I went a day or a moment without praying or reading my Bible it does not change who I am in Christ now I will tell you this right here there will be something missing in my life is that right it'll be like trying to drive the car you know on bad gas I don't know if any of you you know this gas they sell I won't call the gas gas station out but this gas and it looks so cheap and we were out on a trip the one time and I put some in my Expedition you know I don't know what it's 87 or 88 whatever it says on the on the sign and man it's supposed to be cheap I'm telling you I didn't know if I was going to be able to get my truck through Pittsburgh it was acting terrible I said never again I am never gassing up with this gas again they just open a a beautiful brand new one on the exit where I live go on by it every time what is you saying brother Samuel that we want real fuel in our lives this is why the spirit of God this is why that it is Grace moving within our lives notice he says I know I'm no good never was never will be but then in the presence of God I'm absolutely perfect because it's not me he never sees me he sees Christ I'm in Christ and my name was asso associated with him at the foundation of the world I'm just waiting for the cord to be draw up we'll go some of these blessed days to meet him in the air some of them said brother brandom aren't ain't you afraid you know many times way back when I was a kid little boy preacher all the people used to come around and say brother brandom why if that be so what he's just spoke why if that be so well then I can just do anything I want to I said that's right sure do anything you want to if Evil's in your heart then you've never been to Calvary that's one thing for sure I always do what I want God lets me do what I want and I'm so glad of it if I did what the devil wanted me to do it's hard to tell what I would do but if I do what I wanted to do like I did before I was Sav but now watch how this comes in service there's a new spirit in here it's not the Spirit of a lamb neither the spirit of William brandom it's the spirit of Jesus Christ that makes me love the unlovable makes me do things that I thought I never would do it's him watch how watch this makes me do things why if it was up to me you know what I'd say tonight I'd have called up brother Mr Bose and said say boy look I've been up for two nights I ain't had a bit of sleep I ain't slept about two hours in the last two nights going and coming people have to door and everything else and weigh in the night and trying to lay down a few minutes they get you up again then it's broke and then that goes away here's another sure I'd stay home he probably have a pretty good excuse now watch he's talking about A Love Affair here but there was something in me that wasn't me said you're supposed to be in Chicago tonight and it was 12:30 at home about 280 Mi to drive through the traffic I said Lord I'm going you help help me and he did and I got here just in time yes sir that's right wow something in me glory be to God oh he says see it's something in you there is now no condemnation can't be to those that are in Christ for they don't walk after the lust of the flesh they walk after the spirit if you love the Lord you want to do everything you can to please himely that's right it'd be kind of be like in your marriage if you just said I'm only going to do big things good luck it's the little things it's the little things to please maybe things that don't even seem maybe to you you don't even see the significance of it like taking your shoes off at the door right I know I have to say this maybe for some for brothers hanging your towel up when you get done in the bathroom that's right picking your own clothes up and putting them in a clothes hamper that's right if you need to act like you're you know you're at the closing shot of the game and you know putting them there maybe your brothers are different ones don't really see the significance of it like I don't understand why this wants to be I don't but when that's made known to you after time maybe years down the Lo Road some things down the line begin to make sense to you that's right absolutely it's just why there's certain little things that sometimes that we maybe don't understand even when brother BR talked about coming to the house of God early okay that's not a law I want you to understand this that's not something that comes along and says oh the you're a bride and you're not that's not what it is at all but he's giving us admonition that for everything that is around us something that we may not even understand but there's a value in it it's a little thing absolutely but there's a value in it you understand that that's what Grace is there's certain things it isn't about if you do this if you don't do this bless God you're not in the bride you're not going to no it's not that there's little things that make a difference we're living in an hour where sometimes where it's looked at the little things don't mean much but it does mean much to God yes it does if you say brother Samuel show me that in the scripture he said he was not forgetful to overlook a cup of water being given to one who was in thirst and that's not even a bride type are you with me that's not even a bride type when was I naked and you clothed me when was I hungry and you fed me that's not even the bride that's those who will stand at the white Throne judgment and be granted to enter into life how much more for you and I God helped me to be observant of his needs help me to care about that help me not to be so consumed with life itself that we forget the little things that's what the love of God does this is why you had you sat down with your husband with your wife cuz sometimes you have to sit down and be reminded and reminisce where things got off the rails from little things simple little things everybody stay with me you wer until I got there right watch this let's take it this way that the unlearned one understand if you love your wife right I love my wife real good well if there was such a thing if some other woman would come up and say Billy I love you too she might be a pretty girl and she'd say I love you well she wouldn't do it he said but what what would I tell her I'd say look sister kneel down here a minute I want to pray with you a little bit well you say Bill you're in Africa Asia somewhere your wife would never know it that might be true and if she never did know it I'd know it I would know it and another other thing if I love her the right way if she loves me so much she'd forgive me that's what you'd say that may be so too but I love her too much to do it that's Grace not nothing i' done but it's just my love for her and that's the way our love is to Christ when we've been born again and realized that we're Sons and Daughters of God it ain't me have to do this have to do that Paul said all things to me are lawful but not all expedient right amen amen right amen amen so it now it comes into a different place to where it's not just where we're we're not under you can do this you can't do that but it's evaluating even the things in our lives that could be absolutely permissible you see this is where maturity comes to where it now raises to a place to it's not just something about is this against the word or not there's a lot of things that yes as we grow there's certain things we grow and we learn and God brings us to the attention but it goes to even deeper than that that if there are things that we can look in our life and say Lord what do you say about this like brother BR he wanted to be a hunter and a Trapper is that right what's sinful about being a hunter and Trapper nothing unless it takes away from serving God if it hinders in any way from him being effective to what God called him to do do and that's where we are called to as Sons and Daughters of God oh my brother Samuel I want to talk about the adoption that's what I'm talking about well I want to talk about speaking storms and storms out of existence hey there's storms come in your life come in my life and we've got to stand as Sons and Daughters of God and speak to those storms Amen to be able to look at things as it comes around our life and it's not looking at it of what's sinful and what's not it's even looking at in a manner of is will this edify Christ in me will it edify my family will this Choice encourage my familyes walk in God hello I'm talking about adopted Sons and Daughters of God so it isn't some law that I have to preach the gospel isn't some law I have to do this it's because I love him so much I just love to do it and if you love him like that as long as I love my wife like that she don't never have to worry as long as she loves me like that she don't have to worry we don't go around one another and say now listen here Mr brandom tell you something right now you're going away on a trip I'm going to lay the law right down on you don't you run around on me young man don't you do that and after she gets done laying down the law then I turn around and say now my fair lady let me tell you something while I'm gone don't you have no other husbands don't you do this don't you do that brother B says see I just love her so much my trust is in herah in another place he says what kind of home would that be amen what kind of home would that be aren't you glad that he's prepared a place living in the Realms of Grace We're not living under a law if you're still living under fear you're still living God doesn't want you to live there God wants you to live in the freedom and the Liberty to where from within your full desire is to please him amen is that right and then even as our lives to even look and evaluate through our lives God wants us to be able to look as Sons and Daughters of God and say Lord in my life this domain that you've placed me over my home and my job and other things because you know there's decisions that you've got to make sometimes you could easily get yourself so tangled up and no doubt we all have made mistakes we've got entangled with things and we've overcommitted oursel we've committed ourselves in areas of ways to where it's affected sometimes it hasn't maybe taken you out of the house of God but when you come to the house of God you're so wore out listen it hasn't been because something has been mandated sometimes it's been from our overc commitment is that right we all know how we are I can get that done in two hours two hours turns into two months right but what do we do oh oh oh what do I do well we learn from that Lord help me to learn help me to be sensitive help me not to overcommit myself why because even my spirit I don't want to just be here physically in my body and weary in my spirit I know he can help me I witnessed that amen how many witnesses I got here that he's helped me when I've been weary in my spirit but I don't want to be that way and I know sometimes there's things we can't help but God help us as Sons and Daughters of God I want to give my very best to him decisions that I make that are not about Sin of doing this oh this is right this no it's decision that I look at to say God I want you to be glor glorified in my life and you know what if there's something where it's come along a trap well listen God's here to Spring traps amen now the Trap itself doesn't mean that God just takes the Trap away but say God help me right and he'll lead you out of that he'll give you Grace to overcome that and say God help me that I won't make that same mistake again because why the same trap will be presented itself once again you will you you and I both we know that you'll be presented with it once again why so that God can manifest just as you overcome to get out of the Trap that when it comes along again there's Grace that manifest to where you might be pulled this way or pulled that way reasonings can come what will your family take or you ought to do this for this but there is something that stands what does my Lord say you love him oh god let's live in the Realms of Grace let's live as Sons and Daughters of God Amen let's bow our heads in order of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we certainly thank you Lord God for your mercy Lord once again Lord Jesus truly Lord in the Simplicity of your word Lord God as you would speak to our hearts we thank you for your mercy Lord we thank you Father that Lord to realize that that's your objective is that the word itself Christ it would be you Lord living your own life through US Lord Lord to where our our our desire our desire is all about pleasing you what I pray this morning if there's one that God that doesn't know you that way maybe Lord they've looked looked at it of I have to do this or have to do that may they Lord I pray this morning may it come Lord to a place that they can really get a real glimpse of Calvary to realize what you did for them Lord the price that was paid the way that was made that Lord God that they might have that same reality in their hearts

outside but Lord It's Your Glory of your presence moving in our lives Lord the desire that we have is to please you you made a way that we could serve you you made a way that we could live for you now Lord I pray here this morning God as we are called to live in these Realms of Grace Lord if there's any along the way that's fallen into a trap or maybe something Lord that they have Lord stumbled into maybe become negligent Lord within something Lord maybe become a little careless Lord in their walk not meaning to intentionally but to where Lord things things have just little by little by little it's crowded out and lord they're just living if we can say it like that but right here this morning Lord in your presence their desire Lord God is for a complete renewal a complete restoring

that's spoken to my life Lord I I want to live as an effectual witness Lord I Want To Live Lord freely fully as a son and daughter God the full potential Lord help me Lord give me discernment in my life let there be that discernment we know that Lord the word of God tells us Lord that our senses are exercised to discern Good and Evil by the word that we are feeding [Music] on Lord God I pray father May Our Lives Lord in the little things you spoke to us on tonight or this morning Lord God may we give attention to little things may we not look or count certain things as being small may we not even Lord God look at it in a man well God don't really care about this Lord you care about your word and as Sons and Daughters of God we care about you we care about your word Lord we want to please you Lord Lord in the little things because it's little foxes that spoil the vine but as you said there Lord to the bride let us take us the little foxes Lord your you're here right here this

that we would be invested in may we lord always come down to this evaluation we want to do that which edifies Christ that Lord God which promotes you that which Lord strengthens our walk with you that's our desire we love you Lord not out of a law but out of love Lord I pray God I pray right here this morning Lord like sometimes Lord a couple will start off sitting right next to one another be kind of hard on the cars we got now but and what car used to be sat right next to one another but then over time they're drifting apart Lord God if there's been any drift right here may we lord I pray
