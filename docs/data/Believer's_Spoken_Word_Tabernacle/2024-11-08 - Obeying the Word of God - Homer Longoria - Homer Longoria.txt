what really comes down to the real true investment where there's a return is when that life has been committed into the hands of the Lord and you know God just in his in his Mercy just he moves in such a wonderful way you know it many times we look at things that God could take other lives it could take them right home very quickly and um but yet God in his Mercy he said I'll not lose one and I'm so thankful for that I'm glad that it's God watching over amen his seed his word and uh think about it if you and if it hadn't been God watching over us all the way back down through our life we

the time of rapture amen we're promis that have been made we're not in the season of promises being made we're in the season of promises being fulfilled amen what a privilege what a privilege the only thing you can say within it all it is the grace of God it is God's grace amen amen and so we just want to amen just say we're just so thankful once again to have brother Homer here with us and just want to invite our brother to minister to us and brother Homer is just a real good dear friend and I believe you'll be blessed and we certainly want to we want to hear from the Lord and God has such a unique diversity of gifts in the body and I'm I'm glad for every gift every gift is so necessary you know we might have certain preferences and things like that and gifts and so forth but the real reality if we want a full balanced diet it takes all of the fful ministry you know if you and that's God knows what we would have need of you know when Paul I was we were fellowshipping in the car myself and the boys the other day and I said you look at how that Paul when he came to make known in the son of man Ministry and where that would be placed in the body of Jesus Christ through every individual as well as through a multifaceted fful Ministry how God would Veil himself in the midst of his people and would speak through the veils that are redeemed to me that I just begin to meditate on those things of how that God takes redeemed vessels and works through redeemed vessels I mean to me that's just overwhelming that thought when I think of it but it just shows you the power that is in the blood of the lamb and when the Holy Spirit has come my there's no greater cleaning agent there's no greater greater resolve for any heart than the blood of the Lamb amen so we just want to just pull on the gift of God we all have needs here tonight you have requests on your heart we've not come here to be seen we've not even come here to fulfill a duty we've come here to hear from God and I know that God knows just what we have need of and so we just want to uh just pull on the gift of God as brother Homer make his way out brother Richard you may have to retrieve him brother Homer you know here he stands I think he's one of the Brethren as we talked about it here he is 82 years old he's one of the older Brethren he's seen a lot there's a lot of things that he seen that I didn't know he saw and the first time he and I connected in meetings together my jaw was probably down here with things that he was where God has brought him through so many things and you know it just it just goes to show that within everything God's word cannot fail God knows where every one of us are at you know tonight God knows where you and I are at no matter what where where a circumstance he knows right where're at and you know he's the same God that come and lead us right out of there it might be a cloud of Gloom but he's still the same lily of the valley he still the light he still the rose of Sharon amen so we just want to just pull on the gift of God tonight Amen brother Paul and sister Rebecca God bless you all for being here we so appreciate you all amen amen so glad to have each and every one of you brother Mike thank you for that special amen hallelujah you might not have sung but you was whooping Devils with that flute that's right amen amen that's right amen sing something go ahead and sing [Music] something oh Lord have [Music] your Holy Spirit Come Fill all our hearts [Music] and and as we wait oh Lord as we [Music] pray Lord come speak your word into our hearts [Music] [Applause] and leave a little [Music] [Laughter] yes got come [Laughter] backed to get this [Music] you think we got to live like this [Music] PA whose house is this Paul hey Josh we home a't we buddy that's what we do at home all the time so at least y'all didn't upset us none praise the lord well praise the Lord amen somebody said somebody said they embarrass you what do you mean embarrass me I look I I I run around with John Fain so you don't you don't get embarrassed you know amen amen and so I'm first time here and uh probably my [Applause] last amen now all the things you heard about me through brother brother Samuel is not true amen amen and so uh uh I just do the best I can but you know I'm thankful for the word I appreciate the word amen amen you know when I told somebody I'm not going to sing if that's what y'all waiting on Lord Jesus amen I'm sorry you know amen but you know when we when we uh started following the word of God you know we've been through everything right you want to know a little bit about me I was born a Roman Catholic I went through the Protestants I went to the United Pentecost I went through the oin move in the 50 6 early 60s been a I got saved amen and I got saved I come to the message 1969 my folks my wife's folks was following Brother bam for since 62 and uh they come out with Brother Richard Blair out of Louisiana and so uh uh you know so we followed uh in 1969 February the 16th God called me into it and so uh I've been here ever since I didn't come in on the bridge that's right I didn't come in on a cloud preacher that's right I come in on the word I don't care if it would have been 30 men fall off the bridge I didn't care no preacher call me no preacher call me I come in under tapes amen but I believe in something Bes I push play come on amen amen so I came because God called me I did not want to come I didn't want to come I want to stay out there where I was at but I didn't want to God said you got to come amen amen so when God called me I came and you say amen amen see the thing about it is amen somebody's got somebody to lean on I have nobody to lean on but the word of God itself amen and so the thing about it is what we seeing now amen to me amen there had to be in a restoration of the word not the gifts not all of this other thank God for all of that we went through that we believe that but thank God that there come a restoration of the word we were amen we were in darkness church and it took this message of Malachi 4 to bring us back to the word not just bring us back to the Bible if we just come back to the Bible when amen David Jeremiah's got us whipped amen he knows amen every letter everything but tonight church he couldn't come back to the word because the Bible says he ever learnning never come the knowledge of the truth amen so they look right at it and they don't ever see it can you say Amen because the Bible says he hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and it revealed to somebody like Homer can you say Amen see so the thing about it is is amen somebody said wow brother R was wrong here that's okay right but what he brought he brought a restoration of the word look church amen amen when God Called Paul amen he was to Open the Eyes of the Gentile he met the pillar fire you say Amen so what he did was he came and if he hadn't Paul hadn't to come their eyes wouldn't have been open nobody could take God's uh men's place can you say Amen brother B tells us he said nobody can take your place and you say Amen am see the thing about it is is amen when you're looking at something you look at something that's amen that a stand that's substantial amen I shouted with most of them I talked in tongues amen I told somebody night we was talking that our brother I said you know back in Pentecost you know they shake you beat you amen wiggle your wiggle your jaws right I said my God man everybody's going to have a stamina Li you wiggle their jaw hello say amen amen but it's word amen amen cuz you know when we we get old amen we can't run like we used to man we can't do like we used to but amen but there's a basic fact amen amen they got us back amen I want you I want you to look with me tonight if you would in in Luke Chapter 5 I want to talk to you amen tonight on the word amen and obeying the word of God now let me tell you something man when we talk about obeying the word of God it comes with a price it comes with a price amen you just don't walk into it that's right can you say amen amen so I want you to look with me if you would for a little while and amen y'all now it's just clock in my time amen amen so I won't try to hold you you know over two days amen let's look at it amen chapter 5 The Book of Luke amen the Bible said he come to pass that the people pressed upon him for the word of God Amen not amen they wern't pressing on him for something else they pressed and to hear the word of God can you say Amen it was so it was such a a pull for them to hear the word of God that's what it is tonight it's such a pull for us to hear the word of God Amen it's not so much amen how much good singing we can have that's wonderful but it's a pull on us for the word of God it's a pull amen that we want to see this word becomes so alive amen watch what he says amen he said now excuse me now everybody's preached on this but you had heard it from me amen and they start to ships Fishman were gone going out of them and they were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's man he said he prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land sat down and he taught the people of the ship and when he had left speaking he said lunch out into the deep let down for the dra let the ne down for the dra Simon Peter answered this is first on watch it Simon Peter answered saying unto him master all right Master we have t all not now he's aggravated now he's not in the spirit but he's with Jesus he's with Jesus he's with the word but he's aggravated like I said you ain't never heard me before okay so he says look nevertheless and that word in the dictionary nevertheless is in spite of in other words in spite of you I Ain't Got Confidence but in spite of what you say because I know I know who you are but in spite of it in spite of it I'm going to let it down but I want you to know there is nothing down there are you miss me now he said nevertheless at Thy word amen nevertheless Amen Let nevertheless he says at Thy word I let down that net but I want you to know I've got some feelings that ain't nothing down there are yall with me me tell what you come to church sometimes and you're only obeying the word of God and there's something for you it's not how you felt it's because of the word in obedience to that God minister to you even beyond your knowing amen what what he said Peter's aggravated now Peter's aggravated he says nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the word I'll let down on that and when he had this done they enclosed great number D of fishes their nest break amen amen so I want you to notice he says we've Tau all night long amen Peter says we tall all night long that word tall means to work extremely hard you may be seated that is so good that word tall means extremely hard we're tired amen amen yeah that's the way it is tonight we're getting tired yeah amen listen church amen you know we we're looking at something in this hour amen and everybody's trying to get something to stimulate them I just like to have some Assurance huh amen i' like to have assurance that amen that I'm a part of that because I've aggravated God a few times yeah hey get your Halos off set them right here that's right that's right amen I've aggravated God yeah brother bam says Abraham tried God's patience if he did what about you and me he tried God's patience can you say Amen see the thing about it is we come to the house of God we want a shout we want the victory want under the cups amen and a lot of times you probably tried God's breast before you got here wow is this my water has somebody else drank out of it hey I've been overseas a lot some drank it baby I had my water down one time and guy got it he started drinking I thought you can have rest of it no I can't I ain't got there where you can choose somebody else's gum yet yeah right and we go on Amen see he says nevertheless I like that you know I like that because you know we think everybody super spiritual that's good we think everybody's super spiritual we're humans Amen brother says hey look amen Peter was burly amen and you know what he didn't mind amen even when the when barnas was crying amen and they say shut up hold your peace and don't bother him amen well I could imagine Peter was when he was telling one of them he said I tell you what i' about had it you better shut up yeah that's good that's good how mean when you aggravated to somebody you ain't going to just say honey I wish you stop shut up and S out hold your peace he said I can't right amen why because the word passing by the word's going by this is my only hope this is my only Outlet I'll never see if he gets by me if this word passes by me I'll never see I'll Never See God I feel the Holy Ghost all anyhow but the thing about it is if it don't come if it don't come by the word who cares [Applause] yes Hallelujah can you say Amen yes sir the thing about this bride we've Tau extra hard we fought through every kind of spirit huh everybody trying to quit it's wrong here I always ask them what brought you here can say Amen so he said we've taught all night hey Paul I want to say it like this people you know they want certain prayer prayer lines it's okay but I said it like this at my church I said the right mental attitude right yes sir amen yes sir it'll bring every word to pass I said if you sick tonight you take the right attitude you won't have to walk up here you won't have to be anointed the right attitude you can walk out well look what delivered oh yeah amen we want all of them jumping and shouting and screaming that's okay but they didn't come basically on the word is that all right see the thing about this I always kill people with this quote this statement I'm going to make so y'all get ready to back up and leave [Laughter] okay okay so I said you're right mental attitude towards the heart any Divine promise will come to pass so I said it like this let's take God out of the picture n n brother REM said if he was here with this suit on he could do nothing right that is so good he could do do nothing for you he's already done he's already finished it he can't do nothing he's already done he can't recreate the world it's done he can't recreate the word it's done glory to God it's got all the way that's true Hallelujah Hall he can't do it brother R said if he was standing here with his suit on he could do no more for you you have to allow [Music] iten see amen amen the Bible says look when you ask you receive right but see that's too simple that's too simple I told a story many many times about my my youngest daughter and I said we was having a meeting our Memorial meeting one time and she's a young girl and I was talking with the preachers and she walks up said Daddy I need $5 ask your mama she said I did said come to ask you and I said go on baby I'm talking I'm just go Daddy I need $5 they gonna go off without me and I'm GNA get no pizza well why didn't she go to them other brothers because she knew right I was a [Applause] giver I and she wasn't leaving until she got the $5 if he says Ask Don't Stop amen don't stop he said knock don't stop knocking amen it's not how much oil you get poured on you it's Amen it's how much you take to the word and let the word affect [Applause] you hey when you go to the doctor the medicine and whatever they give you you want it to affect you right so if I take the word I want it to fect [Music] me you see in the process of of being cured of helped with medication it takes us takes a while yeah amen and when you get the word of God and you start believing it after a while Satan comes in there amen see the thing about it is we get we get so uptight thinking brother BR said if bothy brother BR was here amen a brother so and so was here brother so and so here I don't care if he never comes because I have him I have him amen amen why church he said look amen I I I'm the word I'm I'm totally word amen but see the word is done done it see I I hey I you know I didn't know I was going to be here but I knew I had to be here because God called me before the foundation of the world amen see the thing about this that's the reason I don't I don't worry about missing the Rapture because he fixed the Rapture when I before I ever got here he fixed a Rapture for me before I ever come on the scene all my trials everything I go through amen it's just a place Amen to get me to where I'm going because I'm raptured [Applause] amen very good Hallelujah very good see the thing about this he fixed all of that he couldn't put my name there without some kind of [Applause] benefits he put my name with a benefit hey I've got to have this guy to end the [Applause] journey are you with me see the thing about it is amen God fixed all of that yes amen and hey you think hey man he's had a bad day he's failed he done this God said I ain't worried about that I ain't worried about that I think he's going to be in trouble but I ain't worried about he's coming cuz God didn't sit there he sit over here and waits for their maturity the manifestation cuz he knows he's coming Hallelujah is that right see amen I was part of the Rapture before amen anybody ever talking about Rapture I was already a part of it sir praise the Lord can you say Amen see you know amen see I I couldn't help but being bride of Christ I just couldn't help it for the reason is brother B said in 1964 God created a bride for his son all right he made a bride for his son yes and I said my mother-in-law and dad-in-law they made me a bride brother Wade made that's good Paul a bride he didn't know it he didn't know it that Amen brother way him made him a bride God made Christ a bride glory to God anyhow aren't you look church this thing is wonderful even without the sh out say Amen so amen Peter told he worked extremely we do too Satan fights us every [Applause] day you know what I tell him a lot of times I said you're in trouble today boy cuz he told me he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of it I said so guess what Satan you're in trouble today come on Church come on you know hey the word is fixed it amen it's fixed it's [Applause] rigged it's rig [Applause] Church GL Satan's so

outside house hey hey you live in a house long enough it's going to need pain it yes sir he's going to need some upkeep but the inside's pretty good isn't it on my outside pretty bad shape but inside I'm secured amen I'll tell you one thing I'm happy as I had good sense amen hey amen so says look amen so he said I thought look my men is they're troubled and a lot of the real Godly ministry right now they're troubled they struggling sir they struggling everywhere amen amen but the thing about this we've to we've to we've worked extremely hard to try to keep keep you together and you know what people just run W like we don't even exist he said just do it and you don't tell me just do it hey I'm 82 years old I can I can't run but I may be gone before you get [Music] [Laughter] there the Lord hallelujah you love him yeah amen a he all right amen amen so he says look somebody said well what can I do I said what could you what could you do before then right well amen let me read you something brother says it like this he said here it is get it nevertheless at that word I'm going to let down that word I'm going to let down that net see he he done it he done everything humanly everything humanly our knowledge our ability we're at the end but at that word Lord at word Lord I'll let it down I'm not in a Revival Spirit God I'm not shouting God I'm really agravated God I know I'm not spiritual but I'm telling you he didn't say how'd you feel it right he said Let It Down yeah so Peter comes with his knowledge knowledge pop puff us up God we've called all not right we've caught nothing we're fishermen we're cleaning these rotten Nets and we out of here right right they can't his wife can't even go to Walmart today he said I tell you what Peter one more time am once more Lord amen where's it coming from God I've got every gauge I've been on this River all my life I've seen this thing all night he said I'm not asking what you can do I'm not asking what you think I'm not asking what you believe I'm asking you to take me at my [Applause] word I'm not asking you I'm not I'm not I'm not questioning your ability I know you got ability to fish but you ain't got nothing right amen you ain't got nothing so you might already take a little advice from somebody I'm going tell you something Peter done saw the Miracles he could do but he still was renigging that all right amen so what brother R said he said look if you'll just take him man at his word amen you know you know we just make very few things you know okay or God will heal that let me read you something brother M says like this he said look the doctor told you you're going to die amen and you easily took his word so easy wouldn't it yeah I mean you know okay man God have mercy you know but brother B said before you finally take it all amen walk with God Amen amen he said if you're sick walk with God he said if you're dying doctor said you're dying he's doing all he can do walk with God sir yes sir walk with God amen amen and I said you know he said if you walk with God he look you're going to walk right into your [Music] inheritance as you walk with this word you walking right into your inheritance thank you Jesus Lord huh thank amen amen shouting in church is one thing shouting out there is another sir yes sir can you say Amen is this all right brother amen you and Paul can preach Sun that Sunday morning amen watch what he says so he says look you probably been to the doctors you had operations you tried everything right you've been through the prayer lines before but at Thy word Lord now listen at thaty word he said if you'll just drop that net right here well I'm going to show you Vindication of my word I'm going to show you Vindication of my word not what you feel like I want to show you because I told you to do that so that has to be a manifestation of what I told you Hallelujah bless the Lord the Lord amen see when he tells you something amen I don't go over here and said man I don't know if it worked or not it worked see you know we we we we deal with the with the uh patience of Abraham okay 25 years but that wasn't the only thing that's right see Abraham waited 25 years for the boy right so we believe we we all talk about his faith but his reality was was to build a boy to bring Jesus on the scene he had to come through Isaac Abraham had to wait and fix his faith amen no matter what amen so he could bring forth [Applause] Christ he ain't just having you hallelujah amen to run the a there's a reason amen I you waited 25 years I've got to get Christ on the scene is that all right amen see the thing about it is is amen we we we ourself out a lot of times young people they see one shouting and they're not shouting and they all discouraged amen but think about it is amen you may be more into the word than they are that's right true amen so he says amen I want you to know he amen he's bring bring on Christ through Abraham's amen but I want Abraham to have enough patience with me because God brother R said God uh uh go Abraham tried God's patience so he had to get his patience in order to bring forth a son to bring forth the Son of [Music] God now I'm not I'm not a smart man like brother your pastor amen he's got so much schooling I got less amen amen so the thing about it is amen he says now I want you to notice he said now I'm going to tell you something Jesus they talk like like brother probably Banks wood and brother brandham you know let me tell you something I tell you something Jesus I know you're smart I know I know what we all hear about you and I know what I've seen about you but I want tell you something sir you you don't know what's down there that is so good and he turns and says you know what I'm going to put him down [Applause] there I'm going to put them down there Glory because I told you to do it and now I'm going put them down there so you can come up shouting you come out praising the Lord but you stubborn outfit amen you are Target with the one that could put them there amen amen see see amen he sat there arguing he said I tell you what amen he said I tell you what you don't have to worry about your nets and all that just drop them down there right hey you know what and there was other fisherman there they reap benefits they reap benefits amen because this hard-headed guy finally finally obeyed and when he came up when it came up then amen then he says God I'm a sinful man God I'm a sinful man God you know I'm ignorant praise the Lord Amen brother sister like this Peter says to Jesus there ain't no fish ain't nothing can you imagine right can you imagine a guy telling him ain't no fish human knowledge human knowledge huh human ability Amen brother brother said

well the word of God says you can be well he didn't even say be anointed and prayed you take that word you can be anointed amen somebody times you have to help your faith yeah right huh sometimes have

with all I ain't preaching that I'm taking about what you can do thank you that's the reason brother B kept saying your pastor ordained to pray for you you don't have to wait for me man amen he said

of them I'm one of them by the gra of God I'm one of his oh I'm so glad I can one of Amen how many say amen amen and amen amen hallelujah you know that's the that's the whole reality of God of this message coming to us amen is to restore our faith to a real Bible Faith amen you know when Jude said contend earnestly for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and that's that's the whole principle that's the whole basis of our walk with God is Faith you know the things like as the Lord was is going through that tonight with us when God would send the message in this hour and we seen the Messiah s amenu that was to lift our faith in the word of God Amen just heard brother Bram say it here today you know he'll say it in many places he says he talks about the visions that has been witnessed and he was talking about this he said many people come and want to see that Silver Tip Grizzly that he killed and that Caribou he said they even want to measure it he said but you know he said and that was a vision he said there's been many other Visions he said but but you know what he said if there is any Vision that's a contrary to the word we take the word above the vision and he said it points us to this right here that if God did that then what about the word that he gave to you and I that that that was the whole point to bring it down into that place that you know even when brother Braham was walking through Memphis brother Braham never told us in any place of the message that he felt in anything Supernatural but he was told to go here to go there to turn here he said he had some postcards to mail yeah but it was simply following yes the holy spirit amen amen and we know we're following the spirit of Truth he'll always lead us into the word and just like was said tonight and you know it's it's not just a statement it's God speaking to us in such a way our confidence is in the word whether you feel it or whether you don't God God made a promise and I'll tell you the prophet said it like this he said God will bankrupt heaven to keep one promise he'll bankrupt it to keep onek Hallelujah said when you say to this mountain he said there'll be one grain of sand turned loose he said that's a testimony that the rest of the Mountain's on the way he said you got a condition in your body he said cells that are bad he said you say at that time the word of God over that in your life he said and soon as you take that promise and say it over your life he said those good selves begin to arm themselves and begin to go to battle against those Invaders why because it's not our voice that's speaking it's it's him when we've taken his word into our heart and it comes across our lips it's no longer us speaking it's God speaking and I I tell you that was powerful that that testimony about about the eagle you're talking about Bobby Thompson and what he mentioned with that that was powerful right life bu building up on the eagle whatever kindes of things just fly into the Sun and and you see that's the reality with everything in our life it no matter you know sometimes a a person get to look at I've got this habit I've got this or I've tried to get rid don't listen brother Bram says if you just give yourself to feed on this word this word will give you the strength to Fly Above the things of the world that's where our power is that's where a transforming power that's where our source is at amen so brother says when the scripture said believe on thine believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved he said we're so busy telling people what not to do he said just tell them what they need to do he said as soon as you do that he said there's a faith that comes that'll lift you and you begin to watch the habits and begin to watch the things going from your life you know what I love about my experience with God it's mine that's what I like about it it's mine it it ain't nothing that nobody's School into me it isn't anything that I sat down and somebody convinced me but it's something that I can witness the resurrection and the supernatural my own life I know what I was and I know like what was being said tonight it was God that stepped in and overrode the stubborn will of Samuel Browning it it wasn't Samuel it was God who stepped in and then the things of this world just continue to fall away and you know what he's still working on me amen he's still molding me amen what a I tell you friends the whole thing with this message is to bring rest the real message of the hour the gospel is about rest it's a finished work it's just about entering in to a finished work my I'm not going to preach but that I tell you I was fed tonight I was fed tonight I was blessed my heart was blessed I was encouraged I was strengthened amen you know what I I'm so thankful that God comes by our way and I I tell you what I believe just out of my own life there's a testimony coming I believe that and if not something in the future I just go ahead and claim it right now I claim it I say go ahead and say thank you Lord for iten whatever that whatever the request is you've got something in your heart tonight just go ahead and say Lord instead of instead of asking I've asked now I'm going to thank you for it I'm going to go ahead and thank you for it amen don't you love him tonight it's been so good to be in the house of the Lord amen I so appreciate each and every one of you and we're looking forward to if the Lord carries this Sunday morning and and yes you you'll be preaching on Sunday
