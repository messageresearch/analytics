[29:28] we're in the midst of snowy weather
[29:33] but we just thank god that we're able to
[29:35] make a way and
[29:37] you know when it comes like that whether
[29:40] that we have like this we just
[29:42] as we the brothers we try to look over
[29:44] it and try to evaluate
[29:46] the situations and things and you're
[29:49] aware of that we just ask that you some
[29:52] of you that live from for a distance
[29:55] and places like that just you that you
[29:58] would just make the decision that
[29:59] what you feel comfortable with there's i
[30:01] know there's different
[30:03] means to be able to determine what the
[30:05] roads are like
[30:06] and things like that so we just want to
[30:10] just we're thankful to be here
[30:12] and we're thankful to be in the presence
[30:15] of god
[30:16] amen there's some requests that also
[30:19] that we wanted to make known here
[30:21] that were printed out and we
[30:24] as we prepare to go into the word ask
[30:28] the lord's blessing on the word we just
[30:29] want to remember these requests
[30:32] it was one request as please pray for
[30:35] the families living in states
[30:37] you're experiencing power outages
[30:39] without having heat in their homes
[30:42] some areas do not have water so
[30:45] some of you may have relatives or
[30:47] different ones who are actually affected
[30:49] by
[30:50] some of those things and i seen a short
[30:53] clip today
[30:55] that was of texas and
[30:58] just kind of looking at that and you
[30:59] know this is the first
[31:01] this is the first that has hit texas
[31:03] like this
[31:05] and you know with the it's been a
[31:08] blackout
[31:09] you know brother bannon will pick that
[31:11] up in the message the rapture and he
[31:12] keeps referring back to that even in the
[31:14] message
[31:15] shalom you'll go into it and he speaks
[31:18] of it in the message the rapture he said
[31:19] all these blackouts that we're having he
[31:21] said it's a sign
[31:23] of the end you begin to go through some
[31:25] of them we don't always hear about
[31:27] but when i started just to study a
[31:29] little bit on blackouts
[31:31] some months ago and look at that you'll
[31:33] find at times that in california
[31:35] a lot of times it doesn't make its way
[31:37] to us but a lot of things in california
[31:40] they've suffered
[31:41] from these blackouts and different
[31:42] things but you know it's a sign
[31:45] it's a spiritual sign even though it
[31:47] comes in the natural
[31:48] but it's a sign of the blackness the
[31:51] darkness
[31:52] that's upon this world and what's upon
[31:55] this
[31:56] nation they wanted to invest in a lot of
[31:59] alternative forms of power
[32:02] are you with me that's that's really
[32:05] that that's a lot of the culprit they
[32:06] haven't taken care of
[32:08] a grid now just listen they haven't
[32:10] taken care of a grid and now they've got
[32:12] to go back and reevaluate because
[32:14] everything that has been said
[32:15] this will take care of it this will take
[32:17] care of it
[32:18] it's the same way with the church they
[32:21] didn't take care of the necessary grid
[32:24] it ties you back into into the realms of
[32:28] deity they by alternative forms of power
[32:32] but you see there's a real power it's
[32:34] the same power of acts 2 4
[32:37] amen will be endued with power from on
[32:39] high
[32:40] amen it's still the same sending station
[32:43] it doesn't create a blackout
[32:44] it creates a light show you who were
[32:48] darkness now are you light
[32:52] in the lord amen praise god for his
[32:56] mercy
[32:57] his light our light has come
[33:00] amen the glory of god has risen upon us
[33:04] it's the same original power amen i
[33:07] don't mean to go off on that but
[33:08] i just just looking at a lot of those
[33:10] things but we want to pray for different
[33:12] ones because they're experiencing things
[33:14] that
[33:15] you know that i i can't imagine it
[33:18] either
[33:19] being without power you know and without
[33:22] water and those things also want to pray
[33:25] uh
[33:26] i've just waited to hear back from
[33:28] brother shane
[33:30] as well sister lily she got stranded
[33:32] down there in texas
[33:33] she had went to visit her family so i
[33:36] think brother sean is that still on she

[33:45] just to keep that in prayer i don't know
[33:47] exactly where that's out
[33:48] i want to do that as well i want to also
[33:50] keep brother ray hernandez in prayer as
[33:52] well
[33:53] with the whole process of his shoulder
[33:56] those three areas that are torn
[33:59] he really needs god to intervene on his
[34:01] behalf so we want to remember him in
[34:03] prayer
[34:03] there's a need for tomorrow that he
[34:06] moves into
[34:08] um also sister linda cavilla
[34:11] she requests prayer for a family
[34:12] salvation and a request
[34:14] also that she has in her heart so let's

[34:21] well as to take every one of these
[34:22] requests

[37:44] mind i
[37:45] it's not laying in front of me it
[37:48] doesn't get sad but um
[37:49] just thinking about it a couple of weeks
[37:51] ago was that brother bill sanchez
[37:53] leading songs here on
[37:54] on sunday and i thought when i heard him
[37:57] leading songs i said
[37:58] praise be to god amen because how the
[38:02] lord had
[38:03] had delivered our brother from that
[38:05] affliction even what he's dealt with in
[38:07] his
[38:08] in his lungs and sometimes some of the
[38:10] uh residual effects but
[38:12] we just think we thank the lord so much
[38:14] amen
[38:15] amen we thank god for that i just was so
[38:18] thankful i sat back there in the office
[38:19] and it was so good to hear
[38:21] brother bill's voice amen coming across
[38:24] again
[38:25] amen so first corinthians chapter 13
[38:27] verse 4
[38:28] charity suffereth long and is kind
[38:31] charity
[38:32] envieth not and charity vaunteth not
[38:35] itself
[38:36] and is not puffed up may god bless you
[38:39] bless the reading of the word as you're
[38:40] being seated
[38:42] amen like to welcome a visitor here
[38:45] tonight god bless you
[38:47] we want to look here
[38:50] at at the scriptures here just uh just a
[38:53] little bit more here this
[38:54] this evening and some of these parts
[38:57] within it you know it's always
[39:00] when we approach you know any part
[39:02] within god's word
[39:04] it it in reality when we follow the
[39:07] leading of the holy spirit
[39:08] you never come to an end you
[39:12] come to a part and then you can circle
[39:13] right back and circle and it
[39:15] keeps moving it because it's the same
[39:18] once it's tied into him
[39:19] he's the theme of the entire bible and
[39:22] so
[39:23] when we we look at this in the scripture
[39:25] and i want to just deal a little bit
[39:27] more tonight
[39:28] on this part of it that charity
[39:30] advanteth not
[39:31] itself and that it deals with where it's
[39:34] not
[39:35] boastful it's not vainglorious and we
[39:38] realize that that is
[39:40] it the working of charity is the love of
[39:42] god it's the holy spirit that
[39:44] what we have received by that of the new
[39:47] birth
[39:48] there's nothing that you and i can glory
[39:50] in that we've done
[39:52] but it's it's simply been the work of
[39:55] almighty god
[39:56] we we've had we have we've yielded to
[39:59] his working but even to yield to his
[40:02] working that's the grace of god as well
[40:05] and so when we we begin to look at it
[40:07] and to think that if we
[40:08] see this that in even in our lives he's
[40:11] the theme of everything about our life
[40:13] then there is nothing that we in
[40:16] ourselves
[40:17] can brag on in any way of what we have
[40:21] done
[40:21] or what we could do because even in the
[40:24] life
[40:25] of god once we have been born of the
[40:28] spirit of god
[40:29] john would write it in this way in first
[40:32] john 5
[40:33] whosoever is born of god overcometh the
[40:36] world
[40:37] and this is the victory even our faith
[40:41] so that once that a life has passed from
[40:44] death
[40:45] unto life then it comes into the place
[40:48] of an overcomer and it's overcoming a
[40:50] life that's working in you
[40:52] even when the lord jesus as they he was
[40:56] placed
[40:56] in the grave through his death and his
[40:58] burial but that quickening spirit that
[41:01] life
[41:02] it went on and it moved down and we know
[41:05] the what took place there
[41:06] the sins were deposited in health and
[41:09] then he he raised back up on that easter
[41:11] morning
[41:12] he spoiled principalities and all powers
[41:15] he loosed the seals of death what was a
[41:17] mystery to man and
[41:19] what held man as a fear the fear of
[41:21] death he broke the seal of that
[41:23] to begin to reveal and unfold to man
[41:26] what it was
[41:27] what with this life now what is that
[41:30] next life
[41:30] how how what comes after this and
[41:34] and who is it that will that can break
[41:36] that seal who is it that can make that
[41:38] known
[41:39] and on that easter morning then it was
[41:42] through his working
[41:43] that took a group of believers that was
[41:46] so
[41:47] saddened because of what they thought
[41:50] they saw the supernatural saw the
[41:52] reality but things
[41:54] did not turn out in the way that they
[41:56] thought they ought to
[41:58] but when he came to them he began to
[42:01] unfold
[42:02] the word that re that was pertaining to
[42:05] him
[42:05] scripture that had to be fulfilled
[42:09] and when he begin to reveal to them that
[42:11] place in the word
[42:13] and then it comes to that moment that
[42:16] now
[42:16] he reveals himself in that little that
[42:19] place with them where they invited him
[42:21] in
[42:21] their hearts the bible says did not our
[42:24] hearts burn
[42:25] while he spoke to us along the way they
[42:28] recognized him as
[42:30] the fulfillment of the word you see he
[42:33] just didn't want them to know
[42:35] that i'm the same jesus that walked with
[42:37] you he wanted them to know
[42:39] that what was against you the debt
[42:43] i have come to settle that debt
[42:46] i have fulfilled the scriptures of what
[42:49] was spoken
[42:50] of the shepherd of the redeemer of the
[42:52] savior
[42:53] of the deliverer he wanted to make sure
[42:55] that they could see that
[42:57] in the scripture this is what he was and
[43:00] see that's the same way
[43:01] that god works today his characteristics
[43:04] never change
[43:05] his natures never change he's the same
[43:08] god as the scripture said i'm god
[43:10] and i change not he's the same yesterday
[43:13] today and forever
[43:14] if he ever healed a man before he heals
[43:16] him tonight
[43:17] if he ever delivered before he delivers
[43:20] tonight if he ever saved before he saves
[43:22] tonight
[43:23] if he ever filled with the holy ghost he
[43:25] still feels with the holy ghost
[43:27] the word is what reveals him to be
[43:30] the same in power in glory
[43:34] and nature so within this
[43:37] when we when we can see this this
[43:40] reality that
[43:42] within the vaunting itself uh or the
[43:44] boasting or
[43:46] any uh how the word would be used of
[43:49] bragging
[43:49] there's nothing that in ourselves that
[43:52] we can brag on
[43:53] i want to just maybe cut in here in a in
[43:56] a scripture
[43:57] and to look how paul all through the
[43:59] gospel
[44:00] you find all through the gospel it is
[44:04] it is everywhere that the glory
[44:07] belongs to almighty god
[44:11] and it never ever should be you see this
[44:14] is where
[44:15] this is our desire is that he's the one
[44:18] who's glorified in our midst
[44:20] we don't want when people come to church
[44:22] or they remember
[44:23] uh this or they remember something else
[44:26] what we want them to remember is
[44:28] is that there was something here who
[44:31] knew me there's one here who's dealing
[44:34] with my
[44:35] life there's something here that's
[44:37] calling me
[44:38] that's greater than my ability to even
[44:42] comprehend there's one that's here it's
[44:45] god that's what we that's our desire
[44:50] hallelujah i really don't care if a
[44:52] person remembers
[44:54] if it was me speaking or somebody else
[44:56] that has that doesn't make any
[44:58] difference
[44:58] what matters is is our needs we have
[45:02] received our needs
[45:03] met in jesus christ that's what's
[45:05] important
[45:08] see paul would write of this of the god
[45:11] who is rich in mercy
[45:12] and he said it like this familiar
[45:14] scripture but god who is rich in mercy
[45:17] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[45:20] even when we were dead in sins
[45:24] hath quickened us together with christ
[45:28] by grace ye are saved
[45:31] and have raised us up together made us
[45:34] sit together in heavenly places in
[45:36] christ jesus now
[45:37] paul is speaking this here and declaring
[45:40] not only to those who have experienced
[45:43] this reality
[45:44] but he's letting know let it be known to
[45:46] everyone even a son or daughter of god
[45:49] that hasn't experienced that reality
[45:51] he's sounding a trumpet to them
[45:54] to let them know what you have need of
[45:57] has
[45:57] already been provided
[46:02] and god didn't even ask you
[46:05] amen he already provided it
[46:11] hallelujah that in the ages to come he
[46:14] might show the exceeding riches of his
[46:17] grace
[46:17] in his kindness toward us through
[46:20] christ jesus so through the word
[46:24] he makes known this reality to you and i
[46:28] through the anointed word he it
[46:30] expresses to you and i
[46:32] it calls upon us that redemption
[46:36] has come we are included in it and now
[46:39] it's for us
[46:40] to receive that redemption
[46:43] notice what paul says in verse 8 for by
[46:46] grace
[46:47] are ye saved through faith
[46:52] now we know there is a faith there
[46:55] there that even the seal of the holy
[46:57] ghost
[46:58] is god coming to seal our faith
[47:01] but how could you and i even have faith
[47:06] except god comes and would even stir
[47:09] our faith up the bible says
[47:12] how shall they how shall they know how
[47:15] shall they hear
[47:16] except one be sent to declare
[47:20] these glad tidings of peace and the glad
[47:23] tidings of peace are
[47:24] our god rage
[47:27] [Music]
[47:28] there's nothing greater there's nothing
[47:31] too hard
[47:32] our god rings
[47:35] notice and that not of yourselves
[47:38] it is the gift of god faith
[47:42] that is gifted to you and i it's grace
[47:46] it's grace it's god working the whole
[47:48] time and remember as we've been looking
[47:50] here on sundays
[47:51] it is the faith of god moving down
[47:55] to receive himself into
[47:58] the temple not made with hands so you
[48:01] and i cannot even take glory and say
[48:03] well i received him that's why brother
[48:05] graham said over and over
[48:06] in the earlier part of the message then
[48:08] he comes in future homes and he says
[48:10] i don't think he said you should say i
[48:12] received the holy ghost
[48:13] you should say the holy ghost received
[48:16] me
[48:18] because it's god's work notice
[48:22] and that not of yourselves it's the gift
[48:24] of god
[48:25] not of works lest any man
[48:28] should boast so when god does a
[48:33] it takes all boasting away from us you
[48:36] see the real work of charity of the love
[48:38] of god
[48:39] there's nothing that we can boast of
[48:41] ourselves
[48:43] for we are his workmanship created in
[48:46] christ jesus
[48:47] unto good works which god hath before
[48:50] ordained that we should walk
[48:53] in them so you see in reality we hear
[48:57] this
[48:57] over and over but it's true we weren't
[48:59] seeking for god
[49:02] he was seeking for us it's true you can
[49:05] say well i i had a longing
[49:07] but who put that longing there
[49:10] you didn't i didn't god put it there
[49:13] [Music]
[49:14] it's gone to begin to drop on it why is
[49:17] it that the things
[49:18] of the world could never satisfy
[49:22] because it it was god working in your
[49:24] life
[49:25] those things were never meant to satisfy
[49:27] you
[49:28] there's only one place of real
[49:30] satisfaction and that's
[49:32] in jesus christ thank god that we
[49:34] couldn't fit in
[49:35] anywhere else hallelujah
[49:38] well it might have hurt us a little bit
[49:40] why we couldn't fit in here or couldn't
[49:42] fit in there
[49:43] but god that was god's mercy to you and
[49:46] i
[49:47] his mercy to send a word to you and i
[49:49] when we were in need of the mercy of god
[49:52] we were without help and god's mercy
[49:55] comes
[49:56] and deals with our condition yeah he
[49:59] points out our sin
[50:00] the holy spirit comes and he brings
[50:02] conviction but he lets you and i know
[50:05] i am your answer i
[50:08] am the remedy to your problem i am what
[50:12] you have need of i am that bauman gilead
[50:15] i am your all-sufficient one i am your
[50:18] health shadow
[50:19] he reveals himself as the almighty god
[50:23] and the god that's got everything
[50:25] covered for your life
[50:28] hallelujah this is why when you look
[50:31] even at david
[50:32] when saul was rejected god speaks
[50:35] through samuel and says
[50:37] the lord to saul he hath rejected thee
[50:40] from being king over israel and hath
[50:42] given the kingdom
[50:44] unto thy neighbor hallelujah
[50:47] saul was still king but the kingdom is
[50:50] god's power
[50:52] that's the power of god god removed rent
[50:56] that was rent from saul
[50:57] for his disobedience in him exalting
[51:00] himself
[51:01] instead of operating in humility so
[51:05] now with david think of where david here
[51:07] is david
[51:08] here he is he's out there tending sheep
[51:13] you look out there i don't look like too
[51:15] much of the king
[51:17] that looks more like a peasant you know
[51:20] somebody just keep in shape
[51:22] but god sent samuel down there
[51:25] to jesse's house with that horn
[51:28] of oil this wasn't a vial saul got
[51:31] anointed with violence
[51:33] come on now but david got anointed with
[51:35] the horn
[51:38] hallelujah there was no looking back
[51:40] after this anointing
[51:43] the vows has eyes that cause the eyes to
[51:46] look back
[51:46] as though something's after you but when
[51:48] the horn has been that oil
[51:50] has been poured out there ain't nothing
[51:52] to look back to your
[51:53] past has been done away with
[51:58] glory be to god it isn't if it's gonna
[52:00] get me one day no sir
[52:02] it's already been done away with by the
[52:05] blood of jesus christ you're anointed by
[52:08] the horn of his strength
[52:11] looks at all the brethren that's there
[52:13] looks at jesse
[52:14] now remember samuel looked at different
[52:17] ones
[52:18] and he thought for sure by stature
[52:22] see god would allow these things to be
[52:24] shown to you and i
[52:25] because it's just a part about us
[52:27] sometimes we
[52:28] want to choose i don't care how
[52:29] spiritual we are there's a part about us
[52:32] that we can still be inclined
[52:34] to look at things like this would make a
[52:36] good fit but god was showing
[52:38] in that hour a type of the lord jesus
[52:40] the lord jesus the bible says
[52:42] there was no beauty that we should
[52:44] desire him he was despised and rejected
[52:46] of men
[52:48] is that right it would not have been a
[52:49] way that he came and god
[52:51] chose to come in that way you and i
[52:53] would not there would not have been well
[52:55] we'll choose to come this way
[52:56] we would have probably chose it to where
[52:58] there would have been no black mark
[52:59] there would have been nothing that
[53:00] anybody could have said
[53:02] but god chose it in that way to hide
[53:05] himself
[53:05] from the wise and prudent god chose it
[53:08] to reveal
[53:09] his glory and here's samuel himself he
[53:12] looks upon the outside
[53:14] and he's getting ready to anoint the
[53:15] different ones you know brother brahm
[53:17] tells us he said it's something about
[53:19] people
[53:20] that we will judge people by either what
[53:22] they wear
[53:23] what they drive or on and on and on and
[53:25] on but we
[53:26] realize we are not to judge people by
[53:29] that
[53:31] there could be somebody who can be ever
[53:33] so boisterous and somebody else who's
[53:35] not as boisterous
[53:36] it doesn't mean that the one who's more
[53:38] boisterous is more spiritual
[53:39] the one who's more boisterous might just
[53:41] have a bigger mouth the one who is
[53:43] actually more quiet
[53:44] might actually be the more spiritual one
[53:48] is that right so we recognize that that
[53:50] within these things it isn't about
[53:52] the things that sometimes that you and i
[53:55] would look at it's in god's choosing
[53:57] and what god looks at so david did not
[54:00] choose himself to be a king
[54:02] but it was god who chose him to be a
[54:05] king
[54:05] and in the presence of the brethren he
[54:08] was anointed
[54:10] king of israel now brother branham would
[54:13] say it like this
[54:14] and he relates it to you and i he said
[54:17] if you're a christian he said
[54:18] how many of you are here christians
[54:20] tonight he said you're not a christian
[54:22] by your desire you're a christian
[54:26] by god's desire oh glory
[54:30] hallelujah none you can't boast of this
[54:32] well it was my desire no no no
[54:34] that desire belonged to god it was god
[54:38] who put that desire
[54:39] within you that's where the longing was
[54:42] within your life it was god
[54:44] that would begin to move over your heart
[54:46] and begin to stir
[54:47] up the desire and longing that he put
[54:50] within you this is why as god elected
[54:54] you
[54:54] then from election he calls you and now
[54:57] once he calls you he anoints you with
[55:01] the holy spirit
[55:02] a promise you heed to the cause
[55:05] but even in heeding to the call we can't
[55:07] glory in that
[55:09] in ourselves we can say lord you gave me
[55:12] grace
[55:12] you helped me to overcome my own
[55:14] rebellious ways you helped me lord god
[55:17] you're the one who began to open it to
[55:18] me
[55:19] the way i would look at the word i
[55:20] looked at it as a law i looked at it as
[55:22] do's and don'ts but lord then you came
[55:24] and you began to deal with my heart and
[55:27] turn my heart around to her and i
[55:28] realized
[55:29] this is god's love and his care for my
[55:31] life it's god drawing me it's god
[55:34] speaking to my heart
[55:35] and see what's happening you're heeding
[55:38] the call and he who's you
[55:39] right into his presence to where you're
[55:42] surrendered
[55:43] and at that time he takes out the
[55:45] anointing oil
[55:46] and anoints you with the holy ghost and
[55:48] you're positionally placed
[55:50] and the only thing that you can say and
[55:52] i can say is to god be the glory
[55:55] it is god that has brought me safe this
[55:57] far
[55:58] it's god that'll take me the rest of the
[56:00] way home
[56:01] oh my you see how what a powerful thing
[56:04] the real
[56:05] experience of the holy ghost the new
[56:07] birth is in a life
[56:08] it's our resting it's our joy it's our
[56:11] delight
[56:11] it's the basis of all operations in our
[56:14] life
[56:15] it's the strength when we feel down we
[56:17] come back to that ground that's given to
[56:19] us
[56:19] that we are sons and daughters of god
[56:22] and we know that we have passed from
[56:24] death unto life
[56:25] brother with that revelation in our life
[56:28] the gates of hell cannot
[56:30] prevail against that glorious revelation
[56:34] hallelujah so we're not a christian
[56:37] by our own desire but it's god's desire
[56:42] oh glory now when we look at this look
[56:45] in first corinthians chapter one
[56:47] let's just skip to verse 26 paul would
[56:49] write for you see your calling brethren
[56:52] how that not many wise men after the
[56:55] flesh
[56:55] not many mighty and not many noble
[56:58] are called but god hath chosen
[57:02] the foolish things of the world to
[57:05] confound
[57:06] the wise isn't it amazing
[57:10] god calls noah to build an ark
[57:14] you think god would have got an engineer
[57:16] right
[57:17] you think god would have had you know a
[57:20] team of engineers and
[57:22] myself and you know zach we were we were
[57:24] looking at this little
[57:25] thing where this guy was you know
[57:26] talking about you know and somebody was
[57:28] you know kind of debating him or
[57:29] whatever more and talking about the ark
[57:31] and the one man said well you know
[57:33] and no i know i might have had other
[57:34] guys that were engineers i said
[57:36] here's a man i said he's standing
[57:38] they're not going to move him from the
[57:39] word i said but because i said
[57:41] what they failed to understand is the
[57:43] supernatural element
[57:45] god did not call noah because noah was
[57:48] qualified
[57:49] god does not call the qualified he calls
[57:51] the unqualified
[57:53] and then those that he calls that's
[57:54] unqualified he
[57:56] qualifies them how does god qualify
[57:59] but they recognize they can do nothing
[58:02] without him when they recognize i can't
[58:06] do this lord
[58:07] i need you and god says that's exactly
[58:10] what i was looking for
[58:13] because the wise would try to figure it
[58:15] out noble would try to
[58:17] you know figure it out but god calls
[58:19] that which has
[58:20] is of that the foolish things of the
[58:23] world
[58:23] to confound the wise and god had chosen
[58:26] the weak things
[58:27] of the world to confine the things which
[58:29] are mighty and
[58:30] base things of the world and things
[58:33] which are despised
[58:34] hath god chosen yea and things that are
[58:37] not to bring to not things that are
[58:40] that no flesh should glory in his
[58:44] presence
[58:45] brother iran would pick this scripture
[58:46] up over and over and say thus
[58:48] he said even the very flesh of our lord
[58:51] jesus christ could not
[58:52] glory in the presence of god
[58:56] as he stood here on earth he said it is
[58:58] not me
[59:00] that doeth the works it is the father
[59:02] that doeth that dwelleth in me
[59:04] the son john 5 19 can do nothing
[59:08] in himself but what he seeth the father
[59:12] doing
[59:13] constantly he was bragging on the father
[59:16] who was in him glory be to god
[59:20] but of him notice how paul brings us all
[59:22] of this
[59:23] but of him are ye in christ jesus who of
[59:26] god is made unto us wisdom
[59:30] righteousness sanctification and
[59:33] redemption
[59:34] god has made him unto us he is our
[59:37] wisdom
[59:38] he is our redemption he is our
[59:42] sanctification
[59:43] he is the oil on the inside that when
[59:46] the world would want to try to encroach
[59:48] there is an oil a sanctifier on the
[59:51] inside by that inward desire
[59:53] that it washes away the very pools and
[59:56] holes of the world it washes it away he
[59:59] is our redemption
[1:00:00] that according as it is written he
[1:00:04] that glorieth let him glory
[1:00:07] in the lord oh glory be to god
[1:00:11] think of this how paul would write this
[1:00:13] in hebrews 11
[1:00:15] 34. he speaks of how that out of this of
[1:00:18] the great
[1:00:19] heroes of faith in hebrews 11
[1:00:22] and this phrase i'm just going to take
[1:00:24] out of the scripture
[1:00:25] out of weakness were made
[1:00:29] strong amen
[1:00:33] brother brown would say it like this
[1:00:37] he said here's something to console us
[1:00:40] here's something to encourage us
[1:00:43] out of weakness and humility god chooses
[1:00:46] the people
[1:00:47] to build his kingdom out of
[1:00:50] if we ever get to heaven if we ever
[1:00:54] stand in the presence of god with his
[1:00:57] church
[1:00:58] we'll stand in a bunch of people that's
[1:01:00] been
[1:01:01] weak and rejected and cast out by the
[1:01:04] world
[1:01:05] and know it nothings
[1:01:09] that's achievement by the love of god
[1:01:13] that's god's achievement what to realize
[1:01:15] that i can do nothing without him that's
[1:01:17] god's achievement
[1:01:19] it's an achievement how god brings us
[1:01:21] into that place
[1:01:22] brother brown would go on to like it in
[1:01:24] his way he says isn't it a strange thing
[1:01:26] that god likens you and i to sheep
[1:01:28] rabbits can run you know different ones
[1:01:31] have certain attributes
[1:01:33] about them but a sheep is helpless
[1:01:37] a sheep is in need of a shepherd
[1:01:41] is that right and you see that brother
[1:01:43] ram says a
[1:01:44] sheep stands helpless that's the way
[1:01:47] god wants us realize
[1:01:51] that we're totally insufficient let me
[1:01:54] just do a pause right here
[1:01:56] that doesn't mean that doesn't mean
[1:01:57] walking around i ain't good for nothing
[1:01:59] i that ain't that ain't it right there
[1:02:01] you're hindering god
[1:02:03] you're not even resting and relaxing you
[1:02:05] you're just you're beating down on
[1:02:07] yourself
[1:02:08] you're joining in and the devil hey
[1:02:09] listen the devil tries to do that enough
[1:02:12] but to realize you're totally
[1:02:13] insufficient how is that it's to
[1:02:15] recognize
[1:02:16] i can't do this but lord i'll surrender
[1:02:19] it to you
[1:02:20] i surrender it to you the weakness there
[1:02:22] are weaknesses
[1:02:24] the weakness the need within our life
[1:02:26] when we go through tests when we go
[1:02:28] through trials
[1:02:29] when we go through things in our life
[1:02:31] the weakness notice
[1:02:32] god does all of that as paul said we are
[1:02:35] killed
[1:02:36] all the day long that the life might be
[1:02:39] made
[1:02:39] manifest in our mortal body look at the
[1:02:42] grace of god
[1:02:43] god knows that we're still strong he
[1:02:46] knows that there's things that must come
[1:02:48] our way
[1:02:48] to keep us beat down to keep us down i'm
[1:02:51] not talking about
[1:02:52] in a negative attitude i'm talking about
[1:02:55] god allows things to come our way
[1:02:57] to remind us i'm the one who's in
[1:02:59] control
[1:03:00] in your life i'm the one who's got this
[1:03:03] in control
[1:03:03] and he brings it around that we realize
[1:03:06] lord i
[1:03:07] need you in every step and every stage
[1:03:09] of my life
[1:03:10] that's god's grace given to you and i to
[1:03:13] keep us
[1:03:14] humble realize that we are totally
[1:03:19] insufficient then god takes that person
[1:03:22] and begins to mold himself into that
[1:03:25] person
[1:03:29] it's one thing for us to recognize our
[1:03:30] weaknesses but it's another thing to
[1:03:32] submit them to god
[1:03:35] to realize that with the weaknesses now
[1:03:37] we're talking we're not talking about
[1:03:38] sin here
[1:03:39] paul we're not talking about sin we're
[1:03:41] talking about weaknesses
[1:03:43] situations things that come about that
[1:03:46] that brings about the reality
[1:03:48] of our need like paul could say it like
[1:03:50] this paul would say
[1:03:52] here he is he said that the excellency
[1:03:54] may be
[1:03:55] of the power of god and not of us god
[1:03:58] hath placed this treasure in earthen
[1:04:02] vessels vessels that are
[1:04:05] fragile you know i don't like the i know
[1:04:08] they still sell them now but it ain't
[1:04:09] like a lot of the flower pots and things
[1:04:11] that they
[1:04:11] they used to have you know when i was
[1:04:13] growing up the only thing really that
[1:04:14] mom had
[1:04:15] everything was fragile it was it might
[1:04:16] be some ceramic or decorative thing
[1:04:18] but it was it was fragile if you dropped
[1:04:20] it the wrong way or set it down it broke
[1:04:22] it wasn't like the fiberglass and
[1:04:24] plastic god never intended you to be a
[1:04:26] fiberglass or plastic christian
[1:04:30] hallelujah the holy ghost does not come
[1:04:33] to you
[1:04:34] by the new birth and all of a sudden
[1:04:35] transform you to where you now become
[1:04:38] a fiberglass christian no you can still
[1:04:40] experience the weakness
[1:04:42] within your spirit and within your flesh
[1:04:45] but in your soul you've got the strength
[1:04:48] of almighty god
[1:04:49] you've got the same deity that stood
[1:04:51] back there in the beginning and said let
[1:04:53] there be
[1:04:54] it is such a marvel and a paradox that
[1:04:57] here you have
[1:04:58] that very portion of the power of deity
[1:05:01] of god
[1:05:01] and yet here you walk in the frailty of
[1:05:04] humanity
[1:05:05] where you can get down where you can
[1:05:07] experience sickness
[1:05:08] where you can experience different
[1:05:10] feelings and emotions
[1:05:12] but there is a power on the inside of us
[1:05:15] if we can just yield
[1:05:17] that weakness to god and say lord be
[1:05:19] glorified in this lord lead me through
[1:05:22] it lord receive the glory
[1:05:24] because through it it's how god will
[1:05:25] mold our character now notice how
[1:05:28] jeremiah will pick this up
[1:05:29] of what we are reading there in
[1:05:30] corinthians in jeremiah chapter 9 verse
[1:05:32] 23
[1:05:33] thus saith the lord let not the wise man
[1:05:36] glory
[1:05:37] in his wisdom neither let the mighty man
[1:05:40] glory in his might
[1:05:41] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[1:05:45] but let him that glorieth glory
[1:05:48] in this that he understandeth
[1:05:51] and knoweth me glory be to god
[1:05:56] that i am the lord oh my my my
[1:05:59] my my which exercise loving kindness
[1:06:03] judgment and righteousness in the earth
[1:06:06] we
[1:06:06] are witnesses of god what god has done
[1:06:10] what he's doing right now in the earth
[1:06:13] we are witnesses
[1:06:14] of the loving kindness the mercy of god
[1:06:17] we are witnesses of the judgment of god
[1:06:20] we are witnesses of the righteousness of
[1:06:22] almighty god
[1:06:23] it's not that we glory in ourselves we
[1:06:26] glory
[1:06:27] in him for in these things i delight
[1:06:30] saith the lord now notice how paul would
[1:06:32] pick this up in galatians 6
[1:06:34] 14 god forbid that i should glory
[1:06:39] save him the cross of our lord jesus
[1:06:42] christ
[1:06:44] by whom the world
[1:06:47] is crucified unto me
[1:06:50] and i'm to the world now you'll find
[1:06:54] paul
[1:06:55] over and over very much like david would
[1:06:58] in the
[1:06:59] psalms you'll find over and over where
[1:07:02] paul would even write
[1:07:04] in the scriptures and he would speak
[1:07:07] even to timothy regarding
[1:07:09] a faithful saying that is with with
[1:07:12] that is to be spoken again and again
[1:07:15] of how that god how he came down
[1:07:18] in christ to save sinners
[1:07:21] and paul said of whom i am the chiefest
[1:07:27] now paul didn't say that bragging on
[1:07:29] that man i was worse than all of you all
[1:07:32] no no no
[1:07:35] man i could do this and do that no no
[1:07:36] that's wrong kind of bragging
[1:07:38] you're not testifying on god you're
[1:07:39] testifying on what you used to do
[1:07:42] boy i could drink this or i could do
[1:07:44] that there ain't nothing about god in
[1:07:45] that
[1:07:46] that's you but when you can testify and
[1:07:49] say
[1:07:50] god took a life he took a life i think
[1:07:53] my brother bill said it i stood right
[1:07:55] there in honduras
[1:07:56] that day and dad my dad brother browning
[1:07:58] was standing there and we were
[1:07:59] he was waiting to preach that night we
[1:08:01] were waiting on the workers to come in
[1:08:02] from the fields
[1:08:03] and we sat there i don't know three four
[1:08:05] hours you know how it was church is
[1:08:07] supposed to start at this time
[1:08:08] didn't start can't postponing postponing
[1:08:10] postponement postponing
[1:08:11] and right there the spirit of the lord
[1:08:13] began to move and and brother browning
[1:08:15] he looked over and he looked at myself
[1:08:17] looked at brother heard and he looked at
[1:08:18] brother bill
[1:08:19] he said i want all three of you tonight
[1:08:21] i want you to get up and you all start
[1:08:23] and you testify
[1:08:24] of what god has delivered you from he
[1:08:26] said once
[1:08:27] once that's come i'll come behind it and
[1:08:29] i'll preach that night
[1:08:30] i'll never forget when brother bill
[1:08:32] stood up brother bill he was the third
[1:08:34] one in line before
[1:08:35] before brother browning stood there i
[1:08:36] never forget the lines that brother bill
[1:08:38] said brother bill said i knew a man once
[1:08:42] i knew a man once oh man he laid it out
[1:08:45] what kind of a vile man that was but he
[1:08:48] let it be known
[1:08:49] it was the grace and mercy of almighty
[1:08:52] god
[1:08:52] and when the word came behind that there
[1:08:55] was a little girl
[1:08:56] a little one about this tall here she
[1:08:58] was in prostitution
[1:09:00] nobody knew it god set her free
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:04] hallelujah it was a testimony
[1:09:08] the spirit of god picked that up in that
[1:09:11] community they were they were drinking
[1:09:13] and the things that were going on
[1:09:14] but god let it be known i'm your answer
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:18] hallelujah
[1:09:22] this is where paul could go on he would
[1:09:25] write about that
[1:09:26] bragging and he would talk about this in
[1:09:28] romans and he would talk about
[1:09:30] how we joy in god through our lord jesus
[1:09:33] christ by
[1:09:34] whom we have now received the atonement
[1:09:36] you know
[1:09:38] i referred to this one last week just in
[1:09:40] in closing or
[1:09:42] brother brown you know he got where this
[1:09:45] he kept on bringing this up where this
[1:09:47] one woman
[1:09:48] she came and she said you know very good
[1:09:51] tonight
[1:09:52] brother brandon she said but i got one
[1:09:53] problem with you
[1:09:55] he said what's that you break too much
[1:09:58] on jesus
[1:10:00] that's a sad thing that what who what
[1:10:02] the organization she belonged to
[1:10:05] didn't believe he was divine
[1:10:08] didn't believe in the real deity of
[1:10:10] jesus christ
[1:10:12] this was god's example of what
[1:10:15] sons and daughters of god were to be
[1:10:20] hallelujah he said the works that i do
[1:10:24] shall you do also
[1:10:27] and greater works than these shall you
[1:10:29] do for i kill to my father
[1:10:32] he let it be known that what you have
[1:10:35] saw here
[1:10:36] is an innate initiation there's gonna be
[1:10:39] a continuation
[1:10:40] of this same lie
[1:10:47] you brag too much on jesus let me just
[1:10:50] read a few little places here
[1:10:52] brother brown says i couldn't brag on
[1:10:54] him too much
[1:10:56] no matter what i'd ever say i still
[1:10:59] can't brag enough on him
[1:11:01] i can't find the words to speak to exalt
[1:11:04] him
[1:11:05] high enough i can't find gifts anywhere
[1:11:08] to declare him he's beyond that
[1:11:13] if it wasn't for sake of time i'd play a
[1:11:15] little clip he's my king
[1:11:17] but i won't do it all that time notice
[1:11:19] brother ram goes on another place
[1:11:21] he says oh you can never say too much
[1:11:23] bragging
[1:11:24] about our lord jesus christ because he's
[1:11:26] worthy of all
[1:11:28] praise david picks it up in psalms 89
[1:11:31] verse 15
[1:11:32] blessed is the people that know the
[1:11:35] joyful sound
[1:11:36] do you know the joyful sound the sound
[1:11:39] that was declared
[1:11:40] you're free you're free you're free you
[1:11:43] can return back to your inheritance
[1:11:45] you can come back home it's a joyful
[1:11:48] sound
[1:11:48] laboring and slaving away but the sound
[1:11:51] goes forth it's a joyful sound
[1:11:55] it doesn't say wait another day wait
[1:11:57] another moment it says throw it down
[1:11:58] right now and start heading home
[1:12:01] they shall walk o lord in the light of
[1:12:04] thy countenance in thy presence
[1:12:06] in thy name shall they
[1:12:10] rejoice all the day
[1:12:16] and in thy righteousness shall they be
[1:12:19] exalted
[1:12:20] for thou art the glory
[1:12:23] of their strength and in thy favor
[1:12:27] our horn our strength shall be exalted
[1:12:31] for the lord is our defense and the holy
[1:12:34] one of israel
[1:12:35] is our king you know david went through
[1:12:37] a lot of tight places
[1:12:40] the songs are all experiences
[1:12:45] a lot of tests a lot of trials
[1:12:49] but in the midst of it david could find
[1:12:53] that god is present
[1:12:56] he's worthy of all praise
[1:12:59] don't you think about this when he faced
[1:13:01] off against goliath the spirit of the
[1:13:03] lord was
[1:13:04] upon him to where he did not hear it
[1:13:07] in the way that others heard it david
[1:13:09] heard it this guy
[1:13:10] is challenging god he's trying to tear
[1:13:13] down
[1:13:14] his excellency and david said i'm going
[1:13:17] to stand for god
[1:13:18] i'm going to stand up for god in this
[1:13:21] time i know what he is
[1:13:23] so i'm going to stand for him in this
[1:13:25] hour and the goliath was out there
[1:13:27] just boasting and boasting and boasting
[1:13:31] but that day i like how brother braham
[1:13:32] says it that day
[1:13:34] somebody came in the camp he made the
[1:13:38] wrong boast
[1:13:39] with the wrong person that day
[1:13:43] oh my there could be sickness there can
[1:13:45] be things that can come your way
[1:13:47] and a lot of other things and the enemy
[1:13:49] can try to boast
[1:13:51] he can try to stand there and say a lot
[1:13:53] of things but to a son and daughter of
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:55] there is a reality in your heart that
[1:13:58] burns that's greater than
[1:14:00] every boast of the enemy he might have
[1:14:02] afflicted your body but
[1:14:03] god said i'm the lord that healeth all
[1:14:06] thy diseases
[1:14:08] by his stripes i am healed
[1:14:14] david looked around and said all right
[1:14:16] who's going to shut his mouth
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:20] i'm tired of hearing his mouth run
[1:14:23] david what are you talking about he's
[1:14:25] running down my king
[1:14:28] he's talking about my god
[1:14:32] david didn't look at himself that that
[1:14:35] that by statute of stature he could
[1:14:37] match up
[1:14:38] but what did he say he came rejoicing
[1:14:41] in the name of the lord rejoicing isn't
[1:14:44] always where you just say
[1:14:46] oh praise the lord jesus there is a
[1:14:48] rejoicing to that
[1:14:50] but there is a rejoicing in his name
[1:14:52] which is his character
[1:14:54] which is his word and you can rejoice
[1:14:57] like david rejoiced
[1:14:58] and david said you come to me in the
[1:15:01] name of science
[1:15:02] you come to me in the name of theology
[1:15:05] but i
[1:15:05] am coming to you in the name of the lord
[1:15:16] you see this is why we can never brag on
[1:15:19] him enough
[1:15:21] all right brother brown said i ain't got
[1:15:23] much more to talk about than just to
[1:15:25] brag on him
[1:15:26] he's my life he's my peace he's my joy
[1:15:30] he's my rest he's my comfort
[1:15:34] he's everything oh my
[1:15:38] god whatever your need is
[1:15:41] yes when they have need of water
[1:15:45] you let them know i'm your provider
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] hallelujah god takes situations
[1:15:52] and god will allow us to be led into
[1:15:54] situations
[1:15:55] and the enemy will say aha i got him but
[1:15:58] that's when god
[1:15:59] will reveal a characteristic of his name
[1:16:02] as he revealed it all the way down
[1:16:04] through the old testament and he
[1:16:06] revealed himself as jehovah jireh
[1:16:08] as jehovah rapha as jehovah shalom as
[1:16:11] jehovah nisi of jehovah's
[1:16:13] canoe he reveals himself in the midst of
[1:16:16] a crisis
[1:16:16] and a situation he remind reveals
[1:16:19] himself that i am
[1:16:20] god in this situation amen
[1:16:24] oh hallelujah
[1:16:29] oh my psalms 3 oh i love this
[1:16:34] here was david here he is lord
[1:16:38] how are they increased that trouble me
[1:16:39] now remember david's being
[1:16:41] run from the throne by absalom
[1:16:44] many are they that rise up against me
[1:16:48] he's been spit on in everything many
[1:16:51] there be which
[1:16:52] say of my soul
[1:16:56] there is no help for him in god
[1:17:02] that's just like the devil ain't no help
[1:17:06] for you
[1:17:07] this was listen to me this was a man
[1:17:11] whom god had anointed and god
[1:17:14] had used this human instrumentality
[1:17:18] to take down the boastings of the enemy
[1:17:22] and yet the enemy would stand there and
[1:17:25] say
[1:17:26] there's no help for his soul in god
[1:17:31] but here's how he responded but thou
[1:17:35] o lord are a shield for me
[1:17:39] hallelujah i might have been run out of
[1:17:42] places that i reside come on now i might
[1:17:45] be removed from my comforts
[1:17:47] from where you know everything going on
[1:17:50] but thou o lord on my
[1:17:52] shield my glory
[1:17:55] and the lifter up of my head
[1:17:59] i tell you the only way for you and i
[1:18:01] even to be able to lift our head up
[1:18:03] and to have joy in the midst of this
[1:18:05] time it's because the lord
[1:18:07] is our shield the lord is our glory the
[1:18:12] lord is our strength
[1:18:17] hallelujah brother brown takes this
[1:18:19] example like this
[1:18:21] he talks about he says imagine he said
[1:18:23] if you were giving
[1:18:24] you know you had an invitation to go to
[1:18:28] the president's house the president and
[1:18:30] he said eisenhower sent
[1:18:32] an invitation for you to come to a
[1:18:34] wedding banquet of his son
[1:18:36] and he said now if that was so he said
[1:18:40] you'd brag about it
[1:18:41] he said you should it's a great honor
[1:18:45] of course nowadays it would be posting

[1:19:05] the context of it

[1:19:08] that'd be an honor
[1:19:09] it would be an honor what would make it
[1:19:12] an honor who it is that's invited you

[1:19:34] mistake they knew exactly where to
[1:19:36] deliver it to

[1:19:39] said we've been called
[1:19:40] to the wedding supper of the lamb
[1:19:43] hallelujah
[1:19:44] he said now he said people say all the
[1:19:46] time those people that are filled with
[1:19:48] the holy ghost
[1:19:49] they brag too much he said we've got
[1:19:52] something to brag
[1:19:53] about we've got some southern term we've
[1:19:56] got something to crow about
[1:19:58] there is something that's real that's
[1:20:00] taken a hold
[1:20:02] of our life he's changed us he's opened
[1:20:04] our life
[1:20:05] he transformed our lives we have
[1:20:07] something
[1:20:08] to brag about and he said now if you
[1:20:12] looked at that invitation
[1:20:13] and you looked at him and said oh my
[1:20:14] goodness to go to the president's house
[1:20:16] how could i do that i don't even have
[1:20:18] clothes worthy enough to wear
[1:20:20] he said if the president and sent you
[1:20:21] that invitation
[1:20:23] then he will surely provide the garments
[1:20:25] that's needed
[1:20:26] for you to show up how much more has god
[1:20:30] provided for you and i the wedding
[1:20:33] garment the garment that is needed of

[1:20:53] right
[1:20:54] and that's what brother brown says he

[1:21:24] hallelujah oh my we could just move
[1:21:28] through different scriptures let me just
[1:21:30] go to
[1:21:30] psalm 62 here with this psalm 62 verse 5
[1:21:35] verse 6 verse 5. my soul
[1:21:38] wait now only upon god for my
[1:21:40] expectation is from him
[1:21:42] these are the scriptures read from the
[1:21:43] message shalom
[1:21:45] he only is my rock
[1:21:49] sorry cnn sorry fox news sorry
[1:21:52] [Music]
[1:21:54] sorry doctor whoever he is
[1:21:57] my rock everything else is shifting
[1:22:02] sales come on somebody
[1:22:06] he is my rock he's my revelation

[1:22:14] in the midst of storms and tests he
[1:22:17] is my standard
[1:22:21] glory be to god he is on whom my
[1:22:24] life my experience is built upon
[1:22:28] he only he only now my bank account
[1:22:36] he only is my rock
[1:22:40] and my salvation this is the seed of
[1:22:42] abraham
[1:22:44] he is my defense
[1:22:47] i shall not be moved in god
[1:22:50] is my salvation and my glory
[1:22:54] the rock of my strength and my refuge
[1:22:57] is in god
[1:23:01] brother branham would say oh
[1:23:05] he said i can't brag too much on my
[1:23:09] first birthday
[1:23:12] the ghoster talks about his ancestors
[1:23:16] that him doesn't mean that maybe there's
[1:23:18] not some good traits
[1:23:21] but the reality of it is
[1:23:25] that's all that it could be but there's
[1:23:26] a whole lot of bad
[1:23:30] that first birth you can't brag on it
[1:23:37] sometimes you can look at it boy i'm a
[1:23:40] i'm a good at this or i'm good at that
[1:23:42] i'm you're bragging on that first birth
[1:23:46] i'm good at this i'm good at that
[1:23:49] you can have talents and skills and
[1:23:51] things in your life but
[1:23:53] don't forget who gave them to you
[1:23:57] well brother samuel i went to school for
[1:23:59] this who gave you the ability to learn
[1:24:02] and to desire right you understand what
[1:24:05] i'm talking about
[1:24:08] i mean there's some things that i could
[1:24:10] no doubt i could do but after i got done
[1:24:12] you know somebody did it that didn't
[1:24:14] know what they're doing
[1:24:18] that's okay whether you say man or not
[1:24:19] it's the truth
[1:24:21] there's some things that yeah i can do
[1:24:23] and do it to kind of
[1:24:24] cut costs it takes me a little bit
[1:24:26] longer
[1:24:29] i mean i don't have all the skills for
[1:24:31] that and then there's others who've got
[1:24:32] those skills can look right at it
[1:24:34] and it's just like like butter and bread
[1:24:38] but there's not one of us can take
[1:24:42] glory in even the abilities and the
[1:24:44] skills that we have
[1:24:47] even our strengths become hindrances
[1:24:50] if they're not surrendered and submitted
[1:24:53] to god
[1:24:58] my that's why brother brahm said i can't
[1:24:59] brag
[1:25:01] on my first birth but i can brag on my
[1:25:04] second birth
[1:25:07] what he took me from what he brought me
[1:25:10] from
[1:25:11] you might look back down through your
[1:25:12] ancestors and not to look down on them
[1:25:14] but you realize if not for the grace
[1:25:18] of god
[1:25:21] simple if not for the grace of god
[1:25:24] where would i be where would i be
[1:25:28] if he hadn't come looking for me
[1:25:31] where would i be if he didn't start to
[1:25:33] pull on that desire
[1:25:35] that he placed within me
[1:25:38] where would i be if it didn't start to
[1:25:40] stir up a hunger and a thirst for right
[1:25:42] where would i be
[1:25:48] let me close on this scripture tonight
[1:25:51] and we'll just end here psalms 34.
[1:26:02] i will bless the lord you know the
[1:26:05] background of it
[1:26:07] it's a time where david's running again
[1:26:10] people are against him they're after his
[1:26:13] life
[1:26:14] so brother brian this isn't like
[1:26:16] something where david shows up to
[1:26:17] service that night man he's been on a
[1:26:18] mountaintop
[1:26:20] he's looking around said you valley
[1:26:21] dwellers get up here on the mountaintop
[1:26:23] with me no no
[1:26:24] most of david his psalms are wrote when
[1:26:26] david was also in the valley
[1:26:28] in test notice
[1:26:31] while david would write this i will
[1:26:33] bless the lord
[1:26:36] sometimes when times are good
[1:26:43] at all times
[1:26:46] at all times his praise
[1:26:50] shall continually be in my
[1:26:53] mouth my soul
[1:26:57] all of this shall make her
[1:27:00] boast in the lord notice how david
[1:27:06] places the soul her boast
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:11] bride womb life
[1:27:15] my soul shall make her
[1:27:18] boast in the lord the humble
[1:27:22] shall hear thereof and be glad
[1:27:27] o magnify the lord
[1:27:31] with me and let us
[1:27:34] exalt his name together
[1:27:39] magnify let us render powerful
[1:27:42] praise let us surrender praise to his
[1:27:46] name
[1:27:47] we're living in the hour
[1:27:51] where he has revealed himself
[1:27:55] where redemptive claims the book in
[1:27:57] revelations 5
[1:27:59] has been taken that book
[1:28:03] being unfolded the book of redemption
[1:28:07] worthy is the lamb who was slain
[1:28:11] to receive riches
[1:28:14] glory honor power
[1:28:18] worthy is the lamb the one who has made
[1:28:22] it possible the same one
[1:28:24] who's worked all the way down through
[1:28:27] the church ages
[1:28:28] that same joshua has come back
[1:28:32] in the form of his word to bring us
[1:28:35] fully into our inheritance worthy
[1:28:38] is the lamb i don't know what you might
[1:28:42] be going through what you might be
[1:28:43] facing even questions or decisions or
[1:28:45] whatever
[1:28:47] but i do know this i will bless the lord
[1:28:52] at all times his praise
[1:28:56] shall be continually in my mouth
[1:29:00] that doesn't mean that you know in the
[1:29:02] midst of you get a bill that shows up
[1:29:04] you're not expecting that you stand in
[1:29:05] the middle of the kitchen and start
[1:29:06] doing a praise break
[1:29:07] every praise is to no you might be
[1:29:10] singing near my god to thee
[1:29:13] but when it but when it comes when it
[1:29:16] comes
[1:29:16] you see this isn't something psalms 34
[1:29:19] is not a turn
[1:29:20] on and turn off type thing this is not
[1:29:24] a once in a while once in a while up and
[1:29:26] down in and out that's not what psalms
[1:29:28] 34
[1:29:29] is this is a life that's living
[1:29:32] from his own life a life that's walking
[1:29:36] in his presence
[1:29:38] and when situations arise it can affect
[1:29:41] us
[1:29:41] it can hit us it might seem to hit a
[1:29:44] square between the eyes
[1:29:45] it might even take the breath out of you
[1:29:48] but you can say god is faithful
[1:29:53] i don't know how but he's faithful
[1:29:59] it ain't my business to know how he's
[1:30:02] faithful
[1:30:03] he knew this was coming he knew this was
[1:30:06] he knew this was approaching
[1:30:07] he knew this test he knew this trial and
[1:30:10] i'm going to stand there and declare
[1:30:12] he's faithful his praise shall be
[1:30:15] continually
[1:30:16] in my mouth kind of hard for the devil
[1:30:20] to dwell around that isn't it
[1:30:25] oh my listen i know tonight i'm talking
[1:30:28] to believers
[1:30:30] those are even streaming i'm talking to
[1:30:31] believers we're not talking something of
[1:30:33] fantasy
[1:30:35] this ain't walt disney this ain't
[1:30:37] something you put on and start up and
[1:30:39] turn off and
[1:30:40] everything else no this is reality
[1:30:44] this is this is reality this is where in
[1:30:47] the midst of
[1:30:48] times and situations tests and trials
[1:30:50] good times
[1:30:51] bad times as brother bill sings that
[1:30:53] song all the time god is good
[1:30:56] all the time
[1:30:59] he is not just when it's good for us
[1:31:03] he's good all the time
[1:31:07] may god help us that we can
[1:31:10] boast brag on him
[1:31:14] in the midst of trials in the midst of
[1:31:17] tests in the midst of situations
[1:31:19] and even as we're going about our daily
[1:31:21] life
[1:31:23] may we take even those simple times that
[1:31:25] brother brown says
[1:31:26] you can worship god by walking up to the
[1:31:28] person in the grocery store
[1:31:30] and saying and the lord blessed us with
[1:31:32] a beautiful day
[1:31:35] and wait and see if there's an open door
[1:31:37] there
[1:31:39] oh my don't you love him amen don't you
[1:31:42] just want to spend your whole life
[1:31:44] just bragging on him bragging on him
[1:31:47] bragging on what he's done for you might
[1:31:48] say well
[1:31:49] samuel i i don't feel maybe all that far
[1:31:51] along but brag on what he's done for you
[1:31:54] testify of it don't look down you might
[1:31:57] don't then listen don't compare yourself
[1:31:59] with nobody else
[1:32:01] you let the word you compare yourself
[1:32:03] with the word
[1:32:04] and you know in your heart when the word
[1:32:06] deals with your heart there is a part
[1:32:08] that within you say yes lord
[1:32:10] let it be lord be it unto me
[1:32:13] brag on him for he is faithful
[1:32:17] let's pray heavenly father lord we love
[1:32:19] you tonight
[1:32:21] we just appreciate you what a privilege
[1:32:22] it is lord to be able
[1:32:25] to brag on you lord to be able
[1:32:29] lord to speak of you you're the theme of
[1:32:32] our lives lord
[1:32:34] you're the theme of everything that we
[1:32:37] would say or do
[1:32:39] lord as paul would write for christ
[1:32:43] who is our life lord is when a person
[1:32:47] would
[1:32:47] read a book after they get done reading
[1:32:50] that book there's been
[1:32:52] a plot where there's been a problem or
[1:32:54] problems arise
[1:32:57] but then there's a solution the solving
[1:33:00] that's all part of that plot but when
[1:33:03] the book is
[1:33:05] all finished there is an overall
[1:33:08] theme within that story
[1:33:13] that theme within that story lord many
[1:33:15] times
[1:33:16] can be summed up sometimes in just a
[1:33:20] sense sometimes
[1:33:22] lord in just a few so lord the very
[1:33:26] theme
[1:33:27] of our life when it comes back to it
[1:33:31] gets you of all of the tests and trials
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:37] lord god of your molding the shaping of
[1:33:39] our character
[1:33:41] the work of redemption in our life
[1:33:44] the lord god you would deal with our
[1:33:46] hearts you would pull upon the desire
[1:33:49] that you sowed within us
[1:33:52] the lord we would heed to your call
[1:33:56] lord no matter what it is that we could
[1:34:00] be facing or what we're going through
[1:34:03] and lord when it comes down just to our
[1:34:05] daily walk with you
[1:34:09] lord jesus may we remember lord
[1:34:13] that we have not made ourselves what we
[1:34:16] are you have made us
[1:34:19] jesus it's you lord god
[1:34:23] as we read here in this scripture we are
[1:34:25] your
[1:34:26] workmanship created in christ jesus
[1:34:30] ordained unto good works
[1:34:33] lord we we want to yield
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:38] we know lord god it's not us
[1:34:42] it's just lord that your grace lord god
[1:34:46] extended to us
[1:34:49] lord that we would yield to that call
[1:34:52] and heeding to it in full surrender and
[1:34:55] lord god you poured out that anointing
[1:34:58] of the holy ghost upon our life so lord
[1:35:02] when we look over the course of all of
[1:35:03] our life
[1:35:06] there's nothing that we can brag on we
[1:35:08] don't want to brag on ourselves lord
[1:35:12] lord help us because there's parts as
[1:35:15] you showed us lord even where the
[1:35:16] prophet samuel went
[1:35:18] and he went with that anointing oil to
[1:35:20] pick out
[1:35:21] the one whom you had ordained to be king
[1:35:23] instead of saul
[1:35:25] he looked at the stature looked at the
[1:35:27] height looked at all that
[1:35:29] lord god he was ready to pour that
[1:35:31] anointing oil
[1:35:32] on even the first one the eldest of
[1:35:34] jesse's sons
[1:35:36] even that the prophet samuel would say
[1:35:38] surely
[1:35:39] this is the anointing of the lord lord
[1:35:42] to show
[1:35:44] that even at times the things that we
[1:35:46] could think we could look at
[1:35:48] showing that lord how paul would write
[1:35:50] to us do not be desirous of vainglory
[1:35:53] how paul would write let not anything be
[1:35:56] done with strife
[1:35:58] and vainglory lord jesus
[1:36:02] keep it from this lord keep lord that
[1:36:05] boast and that bragging lord of
[1:36:08] ourselves or anything lord god whether
[1:36:10] it's about our church or about anything
[1:36:12] else
[1:36:12] lord let us your god keep it away from
[1:36:14] us
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:17] help us the lord jesus and may our lives
[1:36:21] lord god
[1:36:22] it'd be a reflection of you and
[1:36:25] everything we pray
[1:36:28] help us oh god how we need you lord from
[1:36:32] father mother husband wife lord pastor
[1:36:36] deacon trustee no matter lord god
[1:36:38] no matter no matter lord where our
[1:36:40] calling is
[1:36:42] the lord jesus help us help us lord to
[1:36:46] be vessels
[1:36:47] help us not to despise weakness
