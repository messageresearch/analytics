[34:14] lord

[34:18] name of jesus christ
[34:20] amen amen if you would if you'll turn
[34:23] with me
[34:26] let's go to first first corinthians 13
[34:29] 4 and i want to say we just so
[34:32] appreciate your your prayers while we
[34:36] were
[34:36] there in michigan ministering and
[34:40] i tell you uh brother ron spencer just
[34:45] just was really just how god just used
[34:47] our brother in such a special way and i
[34:49] tell you for those of you which most of
[34:51] you you know this as a church because
[34:52] we've been praying
[34:54] but i tell you brother rahm didn't
[34:56] preach like a man
[34:57] who has stage four cancer i think
[35:01] a what a testimony and what a courage
[35:03] that should give
[35:04] each and every one of us amen you know
[35:08] it's just
[35:09] sometimes there's things that sister
[35:12] rita you know how god moved for you and
[35:13] sage for cancer god completely
[35:16] healed you and we just believe that for
[35:18] brother ron
[35:19] as well we're just waiting on the
[35:20] manifestation of it
[35:22] because god's already that the promise
[35:24] has already been
[35:25] been given and god has already confirmed
[35:28] that we're just waiting on the
[35:29] manifestation and i believe that with
[35:31] all my heart
[35:33] so we just it was just a wonderful time
[35:35] with brother paul
[35:36] and the saints as they dedicating the
[35:39] the assembly there
[35:41] the church and so we just want to turn
[35:44] our attention to the word here and
[35:45] what we've been reading from this this
[35:48] particular verse of scripture here for
[35:50] some time i want to just go just a
[35:53] little bit further here this evening
[35:55] and paul as he writes here charity
[35:58] suffereth long and is kind
[36:01] and charity envieth not and charity
[36:05] vaunteth not itself and it's not
[36:08] puffed up and we know that that to be
[36:10] puffed up it's not
[36:12] arrogant or proud or does not display
[36:16] itself
[36:17] in a in a haughty manner so
[36:20] we want to just look at this tonight a
[36:22] little bit further if the lord will help
[36:24] us
[36:24] may god bless you bless the reading of
[36:25] the word as you're being seated
[36:27] i want to go to first corinthians
[36:28] chapter 8
[36:30] and i want to to look at this here
[36:33] tonight paul will bring
[36:34] here's another place and you'll find
[36:37] paul he will deal with this
[36:39] the spirit of god through paul will
[36:42] catch these things even as it's
[36:45] there within in the body and it's the
[36:49] spirit of god god's love and god's care
[36:51] his desire to make himself known
[36:55] and to reveal himself in such a manner
[36:59] in a way that god doesn't want anything
[37:01] to be a hindrance and for us
[37:03] we don't want anything to be a hindrance
[37:06] either
[37:06] and so it's god's desire that that how
[37:09] that
[37:10] in his life and his glory that he would
[37:13] flow
[37:13] freely through our lives and so when we
[37:17] look at this look how paul would write
[37:19] of this
[37:20] in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 1
[37:23] now as touching things offered unto
[37:25] idols
[37:26] we know that we all have
[37:29] knowledge knowledge puffeth
[37:32] up but charity edifier
[37:37] now to edifies to to build up if any man
[37:40] think that he knoweth anything
[37:43] he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
[37:47] know
[37:48] but if a man loved god the same
[37:51] is known of him now paul would would
[37:54] deal with this we all have
[37:56] knowledge and you'll see this word
[37:59] that is as it's used throughout the
[38:01] scripture and it's not
[38:03] it's not always the same meaning of
[38:06] where we're drawing this from but
[38:08] here at paul there's times where it
[38:10] would speak
[38:12] of knowledge where it is dealing with
[38:14] the intelligence the understanding
[38:17] understanding what's right understanding
[38:18] what's wrong but then there's
[38:20] also that knowledge which is of a divine
[38:24] knowledge
[38:25] and so you find that how we have both of
[38:28] them but yet
[38:29] when we look at this this word as paul
[38:31] would say here
[38:32] knowledge puffeth up and to see
[38:35] that that knowledge itself there is an
[38:38] understanding
[38:39] there is there is a a knowledge that
[38:43] that also comes that as we further
[38:46] walk on with god as paul would would
[38:49] write even of this right here of things
[38:51] that's
[38:51] lawful things that's unlawful for
[38:54] christians
[38:54] look how paul and some of these them
[38:56] some of these scriptures i'm going to
[38:57] read so that you
[38:59] you just won't put this word knowledge
[39:01] as something that is earthly because
[39:03] that's not
[39:03] what it is but when we look how paul
[39:06] would even how the spirit of god this
[39:08] word would be used
[39:10] paul would write in romans 11 33 all the
[39:13] depth
[39:14] of the riches both of the wisdom
[39:18] and knowledge of god this is the
[39:21] knowledge of
[39:22] of god all the depth of the riches both
[39:24] of the wisdom
[39:25] and knowledge of god how unsearchable
[39:27] are his judgments
[39:28] and his ways past finding out in first
[39:31] corinthians 1
[39:32] 4 and i'm just pulling just from a few
[39:34] here i thank my god always on your
[39:37] behalf for the grace of god which is
[39:39] given you
[39:40] by jesus christ that in everything
[39:44] ye are enriched by him
[39:47] in all utterance and in all knowledge
[39:50] even as the testimony of christ was
[39:53] confirmed in you
[39:55] so that you come behind in no gift
[39:58] waiting
[39:59] for the coming of our lord jesus christ
[40:02] now
[40:02] i want you to just to catch this here
[40:04] that there is a part of it to where
[40:08] when the knowledge that we speak of and
[40:10] paul is was is even
[40:12] a writing of this here it's to know
[40:15] first of all what is right and wrong and
[40:18] to know that god's word is true
[40:20] the very first thing that the enemy in
[40:23] his attack
[40:24] upon the church of the living god and
[40:27] it's been all the way
[40:28] even through the old testament if the
[40:30] enemy can get in there and
[40:32] tamper with that word and remove the
[40:36] truth of it
[40:37] and the knowledge of that word and try
[40:40] to put it off of
[40:41] well this is something in the past this
[40:43] isn't no longer required this isn't
[40:46] really necessary that's the enemy
[40:49] tampering with the truth of god's word
[40:52] the knowledge of the word and remember
[40:55] when jesus
[40:56] using the same word knowledge he spoke
[40:59] to the pharisees and he says
[41:01] that they themselves wouldn't enter into
[41:04] the kingdom
[41:05] and he says they also have shut off
[41:08] the key of knowledge from others to
[41:11] enter in
[41:12] you see you've got to know what you have
[41:14] to know in order what you have to know
[41:16] in order what to do
[41:18] by the bible says he would make known
[41:20] unto us the pathways
[41:22] or the path of life so it is god
[41:25] remember even when they stood there on
[41:26] the day of pentecost they said
[41:28] what must we do to be saved
[41:32] and peter peter rang out with a
[41:34] prescription
[41:35] repent and be baptized in the name of
[41:37] jesus christ
[41:38] those are two things that we must do but
[41:41] then that's when
[41:42] god steps in after that and you shall
[41:45] receive the gift of the holy ghost see
[41:48] there's a pathway there's a true pathway
[41:51] when israel got away from the word look
[41:53] where it took them though dwelling in
[41:55] the word
[41:56] but here they are bound with idolatry
[41:58] and they're
[41:59] between two opinions here between bowel
[42:02] and god and you know which one which one
[42:04] is and see
[42:05] there became a tampering of the real
[42:08] truth the real knowledge of god
[42:11] and then look where it led them to it
[42:14] led them to where sin was in the camp
[42:16] it led them to where god pulled back his
[42:18] presence from their lives
[42:20] and here they were standing here in a
[42:23] mess
[42:23] really of a defeated state so when we
[42:26] see
[42:26] this brother bannon would say it like
[42:28] this and i love this statement
[42:30] in the sumerian church age and he deals
[42:32] with how the paralysis would work
[42:34] through
[42:35] uh the false vine and he said it was
[42:37] also coming in the true vine
[42:39] and he says it like this no true
[42:42] believer is any stronger and
[42:45] spiritually healthy and alive
[42:49] than his knowledge of and adherence
[42:52] to the pure word of god so notice notice
[42:56] our brother
[42:56] put that there it's not only the
[42:58] knowledge of the pure word of god
[43:01] and we need we need the mind of god
[43:04] to speak forth the knowledge of god and
[43:07] then we need the grace of god
[43:09] to adhere to it so that it's not just
[43:12] knowledge but it becomes manifestation
[43:16] so this is where it's in god's hands god
[43:19] comes
[43:19] to unfold himself and the grace also
[43:22] that is
[43:23] needed that that word might be expressed
[43:25] this is where
[43:26] it comes into our lives in second
[43:28] corinthians 10
[43:29] 5 paul said casting down imaginations
[43:33] and every high thing that exalteth
[43:36] itself
[43:37] against the knowledge of god when the
[43:40] enemy wants to try to fire in
[43:42] a thought or fire in a suggestion or
[43:45] anything else
[43:46] as a believer it's brought to that of
[43:49] the word
[43:49] and the word is what judges it don't
[43:53] care how good it looks
[43:54] how good it feels it's the knowledge of
[43:56] god the word where we're standing on
[43:59] that word to know
[44:00] god's word is true what god said back
[44:03] there
[44:03] he's never altered i'm god and i changed
[44:06] not
[44:06] he's the same on everything
[44:11] second corinthians 8 7. now notice how
[44:13] paul brings these two together
[44:15] he says therefore as you abound in
[44:18] everything
[44:19] in faith in utterance and
[44:22] knowledge and in all diligence and in
[44:25] your love to us
[44:27] see that ye abound in this grace also
[44:30] abound would mean to grow within it
[44:34] and you see when we look at this you
[44:36] might say well what more do i have to
[44:38] know
[44:38] brother brown would deal with this you
[44:40] know even as a maturing
[44:42] of a believer there's more even as you
[44:44] go along
[44:45] that you come to understand you grow
[44:48] even in your walk with god
[44:50] as you walk with god it should be in
[44:53] your life and as a believer
[44:54] you learn more that it's less about you
[44:57] it's more him
[44:59] it's us yielding and god doing
[45:02] is that right this is where the reality
[45:05] comes in brother branham would put in
[45:06] this way he says
[45:07] when i first started out he says i said
[45:10] i'm like a man swimming across and
[45:13] going real quick he said but after a
[45:15] while you just kind of learn how to make
[45:17] those strides he said
[45:19] so that as you're making those strides
[45:20] then you're not so worn out you know
[45:22] exactly where to start and
[45:24] where to stop see that's that that's
[45:26] knowledge that's understanding
[45:28] that's that's learning that's maturing
[45:33] now notice this is ii peter 3 18.
[45:36] but grow and i always like how this is
[45:39] wrote here
[45:39] grow in grace and in the knowledge of
[45:43] our lord jesus
[45:44] our lord and savior jesus christ to him
[45:47] be glory both
[45:48] now and forever amen notice how peter
[45:51] would write this
[45:52] grow in grace not grow you don't grow
[45:54] into grace
[45:55] you grow in grace must first come into
[45:59] grace grow
[46:00] in grace and knowledge not knowledge
[46:02] then grace
[46:03] but grow in grace because with the
[46:06] knowledge that's being opened
[46:08] we need grace coupled with it because
[46:10] it's grace that opens
[46:12] our eyes it's grace that helps us to see
[46:15] and it's that same grace that helps us
[46:17] to be tolerable
[46:18] with others so do we need
[46:22] understanding and not in knowledge
[46:25] yes we do we need knowledge there's
[46:28] things that
[46:29] you know even when brother branham would
[46:31] be asked questions you find in questions
[46:33] and answers
[46:34] in different places and different ones
[46:36] where you know speaking about even where
[46:38] it was um
[46:39] you know maybe somebody uh coming in and
[46:42] and and how a gift is used you know
[46:44] within the church
[46:45] and brother brahma is is trying to get
[46:47] to us
[46:48] express to them how to go about it in
[46:50] wisdom instead of just
[46:52] looking at something in a manner of
[46:54] right and wrong but he brings it to a
[46:56] place he says
[46:57] when a toddler your child's learning to
[46:59] walk you don't go up and correct them
[47:02] because
[47:02] they're learning to walk but he says
[47:04] you're there to kind of and to instruct
[47:06] them but as they get older
[47:08] that's a different story then there
[47:10] comes a correction because
[47:11] now they know better is that right
[47:14] then brother rams ask questions about
[47:16] things of you know do we take you know
[47:18] somebody aside and and uh you know tell
[47:21] them this and
[47:22] or you shouldn't dress this you
[47:23] shouldn't wear this and i always go back
[47:25] i was a little boy i don't remember it
[47:27] but always remember when my dad stood in
[47:29] the place you know
[47:30] where he when he was pastoring uh down
[47:32] in in rockford ohio there
[47:34] close kind of the van were in those
[47:36] areas and when he was pastoring there
[47:38] and here was a was was was a lady who
[47:40] came in and
[47:41] my goodness when i did you've heard
[47:43] those of you that have been in the
[47:44] assembly for some time you heard dad
[47:46] tell it
[47:47] she came in with a mini skirt and
[47:48] everything else or whatever more
[47:50] and you had different ones that stood up
[47:52] and said should we pull her aside and
[47:54] tell her and dad said
[47:55] don't you touch her you let the word of
[47:58] god
[47:59] because she's responding to the word let
[48:01] the word bring conviction
[48:03] and dress her and and you heard how
[48:05] brother browning told it brother dave
[48:07] you probably remember that
[48:08] you find different ones and and what was
[48:10] taking place
[48:11] little by little the word as the salt
[48:14] was being put
[48:16] into the pottage it was neutralizing the
[48:19] effects
[48:20] of sin to where she's responding to the
[48:24] word of almighty god
[48:25] you say why do you mention that well as
[48:27] god brings it back to my attention
[48:29] i think sometimes that people have made
[48:31] the gospel
[48:32] and made the message to where it's no
[48:35] more than rulers and
[48:36] everything else instead of the real
[48:38] grace of god
[48:39] i believe in real holiness that it'll
[48:42] display itself
[48:43] but i'm also going to tell you you can
[48:45] have all the holiness on the outside
[48:47] and not have the holy ghost on the
[48:49] inside
[48:52] i've come face to face with that as well
[48:55] the message is not something you put on
[48:59] it's what you get into
[49:03] because you can put it on here and take
[49:05] it off out there
[49:06] but the message is jesus christ
[49:10] it's a place of dwelling to the believer
[49:13] we're not something we put on here on
[49:15] thursday and
[49:16] take off the next day and put on here
[49:18] and put off there
[49:21] are you with me neither is it a code of
[49:24] conduct
[49:25] immorals or ethics and we do this and we
[49:28] don't do this
[49:29] and we do you're no different than the
[49:31] amish but there must be a reality on the
[49:34] inside
[49:35] that you live by a real godly conviction
[49:39] [Applause]
[49:42] hallelujah
[49:46] hallelujah it's got to come down to the
[49:49] depth to the inside
[49:50] do we need knowledge and understanding
[49:53] yes
[49:55] because even in those things that god
[49:57] would just share even there
[49:59] that's understanding that's knowledge
[50:01] for a person to come to terms with
[50:03] wait a minute here i might be doing all
[50:05] the p's and q's but if the desire is
[50:07] still down here
[50:08] and if there's still not a love affair
[50:11] i've not made
[50:12] the mark of really being born again
[50:16] because the love of god it holds us
[50:20] now notice how brother branham and
[50:22] notice how paul let me just let me move
[50:24] to this paul
[50:24] speaking of this knowledge here he says
[50:27] though i have
[50:28] the gift of prophecy and i understand
[50:32] all mysteries and all
[50:35] knowledge and though i have all faith
[50:40] so that i could remove mountains and
[50:43] have not
[50:44] charity i'm nothing
[50:48] so it it shows when we look at it
[50:52] as paul has expressed this we all have
[50:54] knowledge
[50:55] knowledge prophets up but charity
[50:58] edifies so
[51:00] yes we need knowledge and understanding
[51:02] but without
[51:03] charity what good is it
[51:08] what good is all the mysteries without
[51:09] charity
[51:11] without charity what good is all the
[51:12] knowledge that do this and we don't do
[51:14] this and we
[51:15] what good is it without that you see
[51:17] this is where
[51:18] as as brother brown would deal with this
[51:21] in the knowledge you know the knowledge
[51:22] itself
[51:23] it doesn't do us any good without the
[51:25] real
[51:26] spirit of love in our life without the
[51:29] holy ghost
[51:30] it doesn't do any good brother brown
[51:32] would pick it up of how
[51:33] that knowledge would would look at
[51:35] things and knowledge and he would say it
[51:37] just in this manner
[51:38] i can't associate with those people
[51:41] they're uneducated or
[51:42] i can't associate with them brother
[51:44] braham said it don't make any difference
[51:46] whether they know
[51:46] their abcs or not they can know christ
[51:54] i'm going to say it pretty plain here
[51:56] you know to really believe in a
[51:58] pentecostal experience
[51:59] it's sad but that's becoming a rare
[52:03] thing around this
[52:04] message i'm not trying to bring
[52:08] differences i'm just trying to tell you
[52:10] that knowledge and mysteries and all the
[52:12] everything you can
[52:13] go through that if it don't come down
[52:15] into practicality
[52:16] to where there's a real birth on the
[52:18] inside and if it despises the real move
[52:22] of the holy ghost
[52:23] deny it renounce it they have a form of
[52:26] godliness but deny
[52:28] the power thereof the commandment says
[52:31] from such
[52:32] turn away is that right
[52:36] he ordered jesus it ought to be him
[52:39] that's welcome if we want if we believe
[52:41] he's the same
[52:42] yesterday today and forever that's just
[52:44] not a scripture
[52:46] that's who we declare he is what he did
[52:49] before
[52:50] he still does today
[52:54] amen
[52:58] oh the baptist says you can never get
[53:00] too low he said may god
[53:02] always keep that spirit in me
[53:05] no matter what what the man believes
[53:07] what he doesn't
[53:08] creed color well i want to reach a
[53:10] handout to help him
[53:12] i want that spirit in me that i will not
[53:15] think i'm better
[53:16] than somebody else oh he says let me
[53:19] humble myself
[53:20] who am i but clay that god has made let
[53:23] my life be humbled
[53:25] that his life will be reflected lets all
[53:28] christians feel like that knowledge gets
[53:31] us
[53:31] nowhere look at this in verse 2
[53:36] if any man first corinthians 8 2 if any
[53:38] man
[53:39] think that he knoweth
[53:42] anything he knoweth nothing as he ought
[53:46] to
[53:46] notice think here the spirit of god
[53:50] is identifying if one would
[53:53] think or be of the opinion or to think
[53:57] indeed that he has perceived something
[54:01] knoweth perceived something he's
[54:03] perceived it
[54:04] he's discerned the correct knowledge or
[54:06] understanding
[54:08] notice where paul is going if he thinks
[54:10] this is a
[54:11] feeling of himself that i've got a
[54:14] handle on this
[54:16] i've got a real hand on this whether
[54:17] it's man or woman
[54:19] it's not that way it's not us that has a
[54:22] handle on it
[54:23] it's god's grace that we understand
[54:26] these things
[54:27] it's god's grace that god has made you
[54:29] and i aware of what's acceptable
[54:31] and what's not acceptable
[54:36] this is why even in divine revelation
[54:38] real
[54:39] true revelation even when it's revealed
[54:42] brother iran would point this out to us
[54:44] there remains a supernatural element
[54:47] even after the word has been revealed
[54:51] there's a there's a supernatural element
[54:54] around it
[54:54] and to think i love how daniel says it
[54:56] in daniel 2 30
[54:58] when daniel remember he was praying for
[55:00] the mercies of god
[55:01] and daniel stands before the king after
[55:04] god
[55:04] has revealed to him the dream
[55:08] of nebuchadnezzar and the meaning and
[55:10] daniel says it like this as for me
[55:13] this secret is not revealed to me
[55:16] for any wisdom that i have more
[55:20] than any living but for their sakes
[55:25] that shall make known the interpretation
[55:27] to the king and that thou mightest know
[55:28] the thoughts
[55:29] of thine heart notice it's not revealed
[55:32] to me for any
[55:33] wisdom that i have more than any living
[55:36] see the word daniel saying it didn't
[55:39] come
[55:40] to lift me up above you
[55:44] but this came that life might be
[55:47] preserved
[55:51] daniel now here paul goes into this here
[55:55] in verse two and let's just let's just
[55:57] look at this here just
[55:58] just a few moments if any man think that
[56:01] he knoweth
[56:02] anything he knoweth nothing yet
[56:06] as he ought to know it so paul by the
[56:09] spirit of god
[56:11] it is not so much what the person knows
[56:14] but it's does he know it the way he
[56:17] ought to know it the first word
[56:21] that's used here in this knoweth
[56:23] anything it's dealing with
[56:24] a perception or discerning but the next
[56:27] three
[56:28] knoweth nothing as he ought to know and
[56:31] in verse 3
[56:32] if any man love god but if any man love
[56:35] god
[56:35] the same is known of him every one of
[56:38] those words right there
[56:39] it points to relationship
[56:43] if he has knowledge without relationship
[56:47] he doesn't know it the way god wants him
[56:49] to know it
[56:50] god doesn't want us to know him by facts
[56:55] brother mcspang explained it he said
[56:57] like a canary
[56:59] in a cage and that canary can say hey
[57:02] i'm i'm i'm more superior than the rest
[57:05] of you canaries
[57:06] i watched this girl today and she did
[57:08] this and she did that and she did this
[57:10] and she did that
[57:12] and these human beings do this and they
[57:13] do that and he said you let
[57:15] another human being now a human being
[57:17] walk in
[57:18] and begin to speak to that canary he
[57:21] said that canary though it has all this
[57:23] knowledge
[57:24] of human beings it cannot understand
[57:27] that human being speaking to it why it's
[57:30] only got a canary brain
[57:33] are you with me this is why you must be
[57:37] and it has to be more than just
[57:40] knowledge it must be a real
[57:43] substance on the inside
[57:47] we can know all the facts about
[57:49] everything and this
[57:50] and that and this and that and that's
[57:52] all it is at the end of the day nothing
[57:54] but a bunch of facts
[57:57] but you don't marry facts
[58:01] this word is not facts it's a person
[58:06] jesus christ is not a doctrine doctrine
[58:09] comes from him
[58:10] but he is the person of the word
[58:14] himself and this word every man
[58:18] thinks he knoweth it i mean you see look
[58:20] how knowledge
[58:21] my i've got an understanding of these
[58:24] things and
[58:24] my nervous and and though sometimes
[58:27] those things are not said
[58:28] but you catch it it can be caught
[58:32] in the way even in looking at things
[58:35] probably perhaps every one of us have
[58:37] been in situations like that where
[58:39] you can feel like you know what you've
[58:41] been made to feel like as though
[58:43] you know nothing sometimes that's taking
[58:46] place whether you've been on the job or
[58:48] you know somebody likes to make you feel
[58:49] little so they can feel bigger
[58:51] you know now they've got they've got the
[58:53] inside scooping on the
[58:54] revelation and everything else and as
[58:56] i've said here before
[58:57] there's no minister on this earth right
[59:01] now
[59:01] that has the inside school on jesus
[59:04] christ
[59:05] there's not one that the bride is
[59:07] looking to
[59:08] the message has already come by the
[59:11] messenger
[59:12] that's the voice that we're hearing from
[59:16] amen brother samuel aren't you going to
[59:18] seek out this pastor
[59:19] no because they know god i know god just
[59:22] let they know god
[59:24] they don't know the mind of god for this
[59:26] for this assembly
[59:28] but god knows what he's doing it's god
[59:30] that assembled this work
[59:32] it's god that lays taking account our
[59:35] needs and lasers on our life
[59:36] it might come in a little bit of a
[59:38] different angle but it's
[59:40] god letting himself be known he's a
[59:42] personal god
[59:44] hallelujah oh my
[59:48] we're never too big to learn but there's
[59:51] not one man
[59:52] and if any man wants to put himself up
[59:54] in that category
[59:55] you know right away it's a wrong spirit
[59:58] it's a kingdom
[59:59] spirit to try to elevate himself that
[1:00:02] doesn't come
[1:00:03] from the spirit of jesus christ that is
[1:00:06] not come for the real
[1:00:08] true revelation
[1:00:15] brother brown could stand on the
[1:00:16] platform and he stood there
[1:00:18] with an understanding that was not based
[1:00:22] on seventh grade education
[1:00:24] he stood there let me tell you something
[1:00:26] what god did in this
[1:00:28] hour as god would reveal himself
[1:00:31] god let it be known this was not a man
[1:00:34] this was not
[1:00:35] the intelligence of man it was not man's
[1:00:38] man's well let me see what my perception
[1:00:40] of the word is
[1:00:41] it was not that at all even where men
[1:00:44] had wandered at the word of god men had
[1:00:47] made
[1:00:48] statements about the word of god but god
[1:00:51] came down
[1:00:51] assembling stones that were on the
[1:00:54] mountain
[1:00:55] and where men said i don't know if this
[1:00:57] could be or that could be
[1:00:59] god came down with his presence not
[1:01:02] knowledge but his presence put every
[1:01:05] stone
[1:01:06] in order it ain't plagiarism it's god
[1:01:10] coming on the scene
[1:01:11] and god declaring this was my thought
[1:01:14] that they wondered at but these are no
[1:01:16] longer the days
[1:01:18] of wondering these are the days of thus
[1:01:21] saith the lord
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:26] to the greeks see this knowledge
[1:01:29] right here as we speaking about this but
[1:01:32] he as he ought to know if any man love
[1:01:35] god the same is
[1:01:36] known of him the greeks
[1:01:39] they looked at this and this this word
[1:01:42] to the greeks
[1:01:43] the greeks believed when they they knew
[1:01:46] something
[1:01:47] when they knew the facts about it
[1:01:49] whether or not a korean whether or not
[1:01:51] it affected their conduct or not
[1:01:52] they knew it if they knew the facts
[1:01:55] but to the jews true knowledge was
[1:01:58] always manifested
[1:02:00] itself in one's conduct i like that
[1:02:03] one did not know something until that
[1:02:06] fact
[1:02:07] had a practical outworking in his life
[1:02:11] its relationship so paul was letting it
[1:02:13] be known
[1:02:14] its relationship god's relationship
[1:02:18] with his people his life pulsating
[1:02:21] in every individual believer and
[1:02:25] through the body so now as we look at
[1:02:28] this the bible look how i would say
[1:02:30] in another place with guarding this of
[1:02:31] knowledge charity
[1:02:33] never faileth but whether there be
[1:02:36] prophecies
[1:02:37] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:02:40] they shall cease
[1:02:41] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:02:43] vanish away
[1:02:44] but charity never fail
[1:02:48] you see knowledge without that true
[1:02:50] revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:52] without the love of god being shed
[1:02:54] abroad in our heart it eventually
[1:02:56] vanishes
[1:02:58] we've seen it over the years seeing even
[1:02:59] reason where
[1:03:01] it has been nothing but knowledge and
[1:03:04] now
[1:03:05] there comes other knowledge along and
[1:03:07] that knowledge vanishes
[1:03:09] but if but charity cannot be
[1:03:12] moved charity is that thai post of
[1:03:16] the holy spirit the revelation of jesus
[1:03:20] christ
[1:03:20] where you're not living this life by
[1:03:23] do's and don'ts
[1:03:24] it's by the love of god that's in your
[1:03:28] heart
[1:03:30] is that right this is why paul could
[1:03:32] write
[1:03:33] within it then ephesians 3 19
[1:03:36] and to know the love of christ this is
[1:03:40] by experience that same word
[1:03:42] to know it by experience which passeth
[1:03:46] knowledge yeah we need knowledge but we
[1:03:49] need
[1:03:50] that experience because it passes
[1:03:52] knowledge
[1:03:53] amen that we might be filled with all
[1:03:55] the fullness of god
[1:03:57] paul would write in second corinthians 4
[1:03:58] 6 for god
[1:04:00] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:04:02] darkness hath
[1:04:03] shined in our hearts to give the light
[1:04:06] of the knowledge of the glory of god
[1:04:08] in the face of jesus christ and we have
[1:04:11] this treasure in earth and vessels
[1:04:13] that the excellence of the power may be
[1:04:16] of god and not of us
[1:04:17] notice the knowledge how was this
[1:04:19] knowledge
[1:04:20] come about it was god who has
[1:04:23] shined into our hearts so it was not
[1:04:27] knowledge that just it stopped here but
[1:04:30] it came
[1:04:30] all the way to the inside and it's
[1:04:34] reflecting it's reflecting the glory of
[1:04:37] god
[1:04:38] through our lives
[1:04:41] so notice now it's touching things
[1:04:44] offered unto idols we know
[1:04:46] that we all have knowledge knowledge
[1:04:49] puffeth up
[1:04:50] but charity edifier
[1:04:55] knowledge alone apart from real charity
[1:04:58] to govern that understanding in our life
[1:05:00] can lead to a
[1:05:02] feeling of pride we know a little bit
[1:05:06] more
[1:05:08] but charity notice how paul put this he
[1:05:10] separates
[1:05:11] charity edifying
[1:05:14] we need knowledge we need understanding
[1:05:17] but we need
[1:05:18] charity most of all because charity
[1:05:22] is there to govern that understanding
[1:05:28] because there's a lot of things that we
[1:05:30] can see
[1:05:31] a lot of things then and within it
[1:05:33] charity is there to
[1:05:35] edify what does edifying mean edify is
[1:05:37] not just you know you
[1:05:38] you you speaking a good word to somebody
[1:05:41] but real edification
[1:05:43] comes by the holy ghost
[1:05:46] and that is a life that's lived it's not
[1:05:48] just edification
[1:05:50] that takes place through through the
[1:05:52] through the ministry the word here
[1:05:54] through the pulpit but even through your
[1:05:56] life one to another
[1:05:58] the holy spirit is able to edify
[1:06:01] the body it's him that's edifying
[1:06:04] encouraging
[1:06:05] building up it's him that you see this
[1:06:08] is why paul would write
[1:06:09] even of these things when he would speak
[1:06:11] uh to titus and he would speak about
[1:06:14] the responsibilities he said let the
[1:06:16] older the elder
[1:06:18] brothers let them teach the younger and
[1:06:20] he wasn't all together talking about
[1:06:22] sit down and have a seminar with them
[1:06:23] and and you know teach them how to be
[1:06:25] sober and this and that
[1:06:27] though those things are very very good
[1:06:30] but he's talking about an example and a
[1:06:33] life that's lived
[1:06:35] because he would also write to the older
[1:06:37] women to those he said that's already
[1:06:39] married with children
[1:06:40] that they would teach the younger and he
[1:06:42] would tie it in
[1:06:43] with how that they're to love their
[1:06:45] husbands how did they're to care
[1:06:47] for the children how to be keepers of
[1:06:49] the home that's not just something that
[1:06:51] we just
[1:06:51] that's spoken out here in christianity
[1:06:54] it's not just not just a a
[1:06:56] a bundle of teaching it's in life that's
[1:06:59] lived
[1:07:03] so notice how paul would bring this is
[1:07:06] very
[1:07:07] very simple scriptures but it applies to
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:10] so much more than even how paul is
[1:07:12] dealing with this here
[1:07:13] because in everything we do remember
[1:07:16] this
[1:07:17] it's not just about us
[1:07:21] when we've surrendered our heart and our
[1:07:23] life to god we've been drawn
[1:07:25] it's about him we've surren our life has
[1:07:28] been drawn to surrender
[1:07:30] it's not about us it's about him and so
[1:07:33] that it's about him it's about his body
[1:07:39] notice how paul in picking these verses
[1:07:41] up
[1:07:42] of how that this will how the life and
[1:07:44] how the expression of that life is to be
[1:07:46] lived
[1:07:47] in verse four of first corinthians eight
[1:07:49] as concerning therefore the eating of
[1:07:51] those things that are offered in
[1:07:53] sacrifice unto idols
[1:07:55] we know that an idol is nothing in the
[1:07:58] world
[1:07:58] and that there is not other god but one
[1:08:01] no the same word no
[1:08:02] this is knowledge for though there be
[1:08:05] that there are called gods whether in
[1:08:08] heaven or in earth
[1:08:09] as there be be god's many and lords many
[1:08:12] but to us there is but one god
[1:08:16] the father of whom are all things and we
[1:08:20] in him one lord jesus christ by whom are
[1:08:23] all things
[1:08:24] and we by him paul is expressing we have
[1:08:28] this understanding
[1:08:30] now notice how he brings this how be it
[1:08:33] there is not in every man that knowledge
[1:08:38] for some with conscience of the idol
[1:08:41] unto this
[1:08:42] hour eat it as a thing offered unto an
[1:08:45] idol and their conscience being weak is
[1:08:48] defiled
[1:08:49] let me just pause here for a moment
[1:08:51] paul's dealing with and
[1:08:52] we see it in different parts and i know
[1:08:54] we've read through these things before
[1:08:56] but it pertains more than just eating
[1:08:58] meats and
[1:08:59] and what they were dealing with it
[1:09:01] pertains to the whole
[1:09:02] of the body and what it was dealing with
[1:09:05] is how that
[1:09:06] even in that time when they would go to
[1:09:08] either purchase meat because there was
[1:09:11] sacrifices that were offered to these
[1:09:14] gods
[1:09:15] in these temples and they would take
[1:09:17] that and then that meat itself
[1:09:19] whatever it wasn't taken would be taken
[1:09:21] out there and it was
[1:09:22] sold in the shambles or in the meat
[1:09:25] market
[1:09:26] and so paul paul is letting it be known
[1:09:29] here
[1:09:29] then he's he's saying saying to them we
[1:09:32] have this understanding
[1:09:34] but he's letting it be known to the
[1:09:35] whole body that that same
[1:09:37] understanding is not in the whole body
[1:09:42] because for some their conscience now
[1:09:45] paul's not dealing in the soul realm
[1:09:47] he's dealing in the spirit realm are you
[1:09:49] with me
[1:09:50] he's dealing in a place to where in this
[1:09:53] particular point
[1:09:54] where it's still weak where there's
[1:09:55] certain things that just bother them
[1:09:58] there's certain things that they just
[1:10:00] don't you know and
[1:10:01] it wouldn't matter how much you could
[1:10:02] explain it it still troubles them
[1:10:07] with me i mean you know there's certain
[1:10:10] things where
[1:10:11] you know maybe you know somebody you
[1:10:12] know maybe because
[1:10:14] i don't know maybe because you know out
[1:10:16] in the world you know how things were
[1:10:18] and it might sound strange to you but it
[1:10:20] might be how that they live down the
[1:10:22] world
[1:10:22] and and they might associate a pair of
[1:10:24] genes with how they lived out in the
[1:10:26] world i'm talking about a man now
[1:10:28] and so to them there's still that
[1:10:30] association they don't want no
[1:10:32] association with that
[1:10:33] they're just fine to say you know what
[1:10:35] i'm fine without it and there's no sin
[1:10:37] against it
[1:10:38] i'm talking for a man are you with me so
[1:10:41] paul is dealing with this
[1:10:42] conscience because that's one of the
[1:10:44] five inlets of the spirit
[1:10:46] and he's speaking it says that howbeit
[1:10:48] not every man has this knowledge
[1:10:51] for some with conscience of the idol
[1:10:53] unto this hour
[1:10:54] eat it as a thing offered unto an idol
[1:10:57] and their conscience being weak
[1:10:59] is defiled
[1:11:03] but meat commendeth us not to god look
[1:11:06] how the instruction comes
[1:11:08] me commendeth us not to god for neither
[1:11:11] if we eat are we the better
[1:11:13] neither if we not are we the worst
[1:11:18] so paul is letting him know you don't
[1:11:19] have to prove your understanding that
[1:11:22] i understand these things so if i don't
[1:11:24] eat
[1:11:25] then i'm going to offend the lord no
[1:11:27] paul paul he's bringing it beyond that
[1:11:29] we're not commended to god if we eat or
[1:11:32] if we don't eat
[1:11:35] but take heed lest by any means this
[1:11:37] liberty of yours
[1:11:39] become a stumbling block to them that
[1:11:41] are weak
[1:11:42] for if any man see thee which hast
[1:11:46] knowledge sit at meat in the idol's
[1:11:49] temple
[1:11:50] shall not the conscience of him which is
[1:11:52] weak
[1:11:53] be emboldened to eat those things which
[1:11:56] are
[1:11:56] offered to idols you see our lives are
[1:12:00] influencing somebody
[1:12:02] amen and we can't look across even i'm
[1:12:05] just saying it for here
[1:12:07] for our assembly and say well
[1:12:08] everybody's strong
[1:12:10] and i'm saying it's strong and even to
[1:12:12] be endued with the strength of the lord
[1:12:15] the holy ghost
[1:12:17] our lives are set forth to be an example
[1:12:21] we're influencing somebody
[1:12:25] whether we want to be or not you might
[1:12:27] say well i ain't even professing this
[1:12:29] way or not
[1:12:30] whether you like it or not you're
[1:12:32] influencing
[1:12:33] somebody and you want to make sure that
[1:12:36] your life
[1:12:37] is influencing them to jesus christ
[1:12:42] we don't want to put anything of a
[1:12:44] hindrance in the way
[1:12:45] of somebody else because our the focus
[1:12:48] is
[1:12:49] the body paul's not dealing with things
[1:12:52] what he's speaking of here
[1:12:54] uh you know in things within this manner
[1:12:56] as though
[1:12:57] of sin he's talking about a person's
[1:13:00] perception
[1:13:01] on things
[1:13:06] their perception on it if paul would
[1:13:08] would deal with it our
[1:13:10] liberty on it our liberty
[1:13:13] to where that the weaker one would be
[1:13:15] emboldened to eat it
[1:13:17] but they're eating it with the thought
[1:13:20] this is offered to an idol
[1:13:23] is that right if any man notice
[1:13:26] and through thy knowledge verse 11 shall
[1:13:28] the weak brother
[1:13:30] perish for whom christ
[1:13:33] died
[1:13:37] but when ye sinned so against the
[1:13:39] brethren
[1:13:40] and wound their weak conscience ye sin
[1:13:43] against
[1:13:44] christ wherefore if meat make
[1:13:47] my brother to offend i will eat no flesh
[1:13:50] while the world
[1:13:51] standeth lest i make my brother
[1:13:54] to offend even though paul had an
[1:13:58] understanding on it but paul said if
[1:14:00] meat
[1:14:01] makes them to offend long as the world's
[1:14:04] standing i won't eat meat
[1:14:09] who is this about the body
[1:14:14] you see the love of god takes out of us
[1:14:16] the me
[1:14:17] mine i we it takes that out of us
[1:14:21] we still have to pull things in
[1:14:23] subjection but there's a greater
[1:14:25] resource on the inside
[1:14:29] paul deals with this here and just for
[1:14:31] sake of time
[1:14:33] paul is dealing with this here in the
[1:14:35] book of romans
[1:14:36] in romans chapter 14.
[1:14:39] and paul is speaking here in verse one
[1:14:42] he says him that is weak in the faith
[1:14:44] receive ye but not to doubtful dispute
[1:14:46] disputations
[1:14:48] for one believeth that he may eat all
[1:14:49] things another who is weak
[1:14:51] eateth herbs letting on him that edith
[1:14:54] despise him
[1:14:55] that eateth not and let not him which
[1:14:59] eateth not
[1:15:00] judge him that eateth for god hath
[1:15:02] received him
[1:15:03] sad thing is this devil even has got
[1:15:06] around
[1:15:07] even on different things that has
[1:15:09] nothing to do
[1:15:10] even with this then listen
[1:15:13] the devil is a very deceptive and
[1:15:16] cunning guy but he can't
[1:15:18] out fox the holy ghost
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:21] i'm appalled at the church and i say
[1:15:24] this
[1:15:25] message believers that are being
[1:15:27] motivated
[1:15:28] by things outside in the government and
[1:15:32] taking positions on faith
[1:15:34] well we do this they don't do this that
[1:15:37] is not
[1:15:38] the holy ghost
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:41] see it begins a spirit of knowledge and
[1:15:45] puffing up and we do this and we don't
[1:15:47] do that
[1:15:48] we we need to have discernment of the
[1:15:51] spirit of almighty god
[1:15:53] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:15:58] are you with me egypt but it's it's
[1:16:00] something how
[1:16:01] i've watched this over months over the
[1:16:03] course of years where people have got
[1:16:05] some sort of a self-righteousness
[1:16:07] because they were a massacre this one
[1:16:09] doesn't wear a mask
[1:16:10] that is nothing of god whatsoever
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:16] you understand me we don't want those
[1:16:18] things coming in here
[1:16:19] i won't stand for it coming in here
[1:16:22] this is where the spirit of god is to
[1:16:24] have liberty
[1:16:28] there's one resource we're to rely on
[1:16:30] and that's the holy ghost
[1:16:32] it's thus saith the lord
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:38] i mean it's it's i mean these are things
[1:16:41] that's all laid out
[1:16:42] you find statements this way and
[1:16:43] statements that way do you pay any
[1:16:45] attention to it
[1:16:46] not that nor the news but i hear
[1:16:48] different things
[1:16:49] and i'm appalled at how can the church
[1:16:52] of the living god
[1:16:53] get caught up in such nonsense
[1:16:57] are you hearing me we have one who's our
[1:16:59] protector
[1:17:00] and that is jesus christ
[1:17:06] amen my confidence it's not i i'm
[1:17:09] faithful for all but i want to look into
[1:17:11] this and look into that
[1:17:12] but our confidence is in jesus christ
[1:17:16] if you feel more safe with this and say
[1:17:18] well i feel safer now
[1:17:20] you need to check up because it's in him
[1:17:23] he is our safety
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:29] that's free but i see how that spirit
[1:17:32] wants to come
[1:17:33] in amen and as long as we do this
[1:17:36] we do this or we do that or we what does
[1:17:38] that have to do with the gospel
[1:17:42] it has nothing to do with the gospel at
[1:17:44] all let's see how
[1:17:46] how even if this right here and i'll
[1:17:48] just let me just resume here
[1:17:52] and notice how paul would bring this
[1:17:54] here
[1:17:55] because you see if you don't then it
[1:17:57] becomes what's the next thing we have to
[1:17:59] do
[1:18:01] are you with me what's the next thing we
[1:18:02] have to do i have to do this or i have
[1:18:04] to do that
[1:18:05] i want you to understand what i'm saying
[1:18:07] it becomes what what becomes the next
[1:18:09] thing you have to do
[1:18:10] there comes a time we've got to stand on
[1:18:12] god's word
[1:18:15] either god is a god of his way or he's
[1:18:17] not
[1:18:20] that's not arrogance it's god who made
[1:18:23] the promise
[1:18:24] he didn't become a less god when a virus
[1:18:27] came along
[1:18:28] he steal jehovah rapha
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:36] you take a brother right here just one
[1:18:38] of them that has been
[1:18:40] right in the face in three floors of
[1:18:43] that virus and those things of when it's
[1:18:45] taken place
[1:18:46] and god has kept him i know different
[1:18:49] ones got it
[1:18:50] and god brought you through it
[1:18:53] the atonement is just as strong
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:04] so everyone cast these things down
[1:19:08] cast these things down this and this and
[1:19:10] taking positions on this and position
[1:19:12] this
[1:19:13] why would we allow that devil to bring
[1:19:15] division
[1:19:17] discern him out and withstand him
[1:19:22] just one thing if we can't do it on that
[1:19:24] what about other things
[1:19:28] that was free with a bow on it
[1:19:33] right one man is timothy in verse five
[1:19:36] one man esteemeth one day above another
[1:19:38] another esteemeth every day of life
[1:19:39] every let every man be fully persuaded
[1:19:42] in his own mind and paul goes on verse
[1:19:46] six
[1:19:47] let me just let me just let me just skip
[1:19:49] down here on this for sake of time
[1:19:53] verse 8 for whether we live
[1:19:56] we live unto the lord whether we die we
[1:19:59] dine to the lord whether we live
[1:20:00] therefore or die
[1:20:02] we are the lords
[1:20:05] and paul says in verse 10 why dost thou
[1:20:08] judge thy brother while why dost thou
[1:20:11] said it not thy brother
[1:20:12] for we shall all stand before the
[1:20:14] judgment seat of christ
[1:20:16] as i live saith the lord every knee
[1:20:18] shall bow to me
[1:20:19] every tongue shall confess to god so
[1:20:22] then every one of us shall give account
[1:20:24] of himself to god yes
[1:20:27] there's a lot that could be said about
[1:20:29] that but paul as he says in verse 13
[1:20:32] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:20:34] anymore
[1:20:36] but judge this rather let us discern
[1:20:38] this
[1:20:39] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[1:20:42] occasion
[1:20:43] to fall in his brother's way amen i know
[1:20:47] and am persuaded
[1:20:48] by the lord jesus that there's nothing
[1:20:50] unclean of itself
[1:20:51] but to him that esteemeth anything to be
[1:20:54] unclean
[1:20:55] to him it is unclean
[1:20:59] it's not looking down it's if the person
[1:21:01] esteems it to be unclean
[1:21:03] okay all right you have to have that
[1:21:06] that that's that's your perception on
[1:21:08] okay we're still brothers
[1:21:11] we're still brothers and sisters okay is
[1:21:14] that right
[1:21:15] notice even then we're not talking about
[1:21:17] sin we're not talking about sin
[1:21:19] but if thy brother be grieved with thy
[1:21:22] meat now
[1:21:23] walketh thou not charitably
[1:21:26] destroy not him with thy meat for whom
[1:21:29] christ died
[1:21:31] let not then your good be evil spoken of
[1:21:33] for the kingdom of god
[1:21:34] is not meat and drink but righteousness
[1:21:36] and peace and joy in the holy ghost
[1:21:38] for he that in these things serveth
[1:21:40] christ is acceptable to god
[1:21:42] and approved of men let us therefore
[1:21:46] follow after pursue the things which
[1:21:49] make for peace
[1:21:51] and things where with one may edify
[1:21:53] another
[1:21:54] for me destroy not the work of god
[1:21:58] to prove that i'm able to do this
[1:22:03] this is there's nothing there's nothing
[1:22:06] in the word of god against it there's
[1:22:07] nothing in my heart against it but
[1:22:08] notice
[1:22:09] for the word for meat for your liberty
[1:22:12] don't destroy the work of god
[1:22:19] some things that may sound it may sound
[1:22:21] very strange to you but you hear brother
[1:22:22] branham pick up certain things
[1:22:24] even in god hiding and revealing himself
[1:22:27] in simplicity and he deals with even how
[1:22:31] sometimes he talks about and he
[1:22:33] identifies as self-righteousness but he
[1:22:35] talks about among
[1:22:36] some of the um the holiness people where
[1:22:39] they don't believe you weren't they
[1:22:40] don't believe the brothers wearing short
[1:22:42] sleeve shirts they ought to wear
[1:22:43] you know a long sleeve shirt you might
[1:22:46] look at that and we could look at that
[1:22:47] and say
[1:22:49] i mean come on what does it matter if
[1:22:51] they wear a short sleeve shirt or they
[1:22:52] wear a long sleeve shirt
[1:22:54] but remember we're there to try to reach
[1:22:57] them
[1:22:59] there's things sometimes where i've went
[1:23:00] if i don't know exactly where it's going
[1:23:02] i don't mind wearing a white shirt
[1:23:03] but sometimes you know what i'm not
[1:23:05] there i'm not there to prove anybody any
[1:23:07] liberty that i can wear a brown shirt or
[1:23:09] a purple shirt or a red shirt
[1:23:10] i'm not interested in that i'm
[1:23:12] interested because i've been
[1:23:14] asked god's laid on their heart god's
[1:23:16] laid on my heart i want to go there i
[1:23:17] don't want anything to be a hindrance
[1:23:20] that's not how just i live my life out
[1:23:22] there i live it here as well
[1:23:25] that's my heart's desire i don't want
[1:23:27] anything
[1:23:28] because god holds me responsible i don't
[1:23:31] want
[1:23:31] anything for there to be here a
[1:23:34] hindrance
[1:23:35] for god to be able to speak to his
[1:23:36] people
[1:23:38] sometimes that requires maybe there's a
[1:23:40] little bit more prayer
[1:23:42] waiting on certain things and this and
[1:23:43] that i just say that
[1:23:46] not just for me but that's for all of us
[1:23:49] the desire we want we want
[1:23:50] the body of jesus christ to be built up
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] we don't want anybody to stump notice
[1:23:56] all things indeed are pure
[1:23:57] but it is evil for him for a man who
[1:23:59] eateth with offense
[1:24:01] it is good they're good neither to eat
[1:24:03] flesh nor to drink wine
[1:24:05] nor anything whereby thy brother
[1:24:07] stumbleth or is offended
[1:24:09] or is made weak
[1:24:13] sometimes these are things it's not all
[1:24:17] together
[1:24:19] you say well brother simon i don't you
[1:24:21] know i this is not something i
[1:24:23] you know would do in front of somebody
[1:24:25] else or anymore remember we're not
[1:24:26] talking about sin
[1:24:27] right but see we've got other also other
[1:24:30] avenues that we have to deal with as
[1:24:31] well
[1:24:32] you may not you may not be something you
[1:24:34] do completely out here
[1:24:36] but everything that you post
[1:24:39] everything you put out that's right
[1:24:42] are you with me there can be things that
[1:24:45] hey
[1:24:46] not everybody within the congregation or
[1:24:48] assembly and you can know
[1:24:49] there are certain things that just might
[1:24:51] not be
[1:24:52] real set up what should i do keep it
[1:24:55] at your house the world don't need to
[1:24:59] know furthermore i never understood why
[1:25:00] the world needs to know what you had on
[1:25:02] your plate for dinner
[1:25:04] but i know it's more than that you
[1:25:05] understand what i'm saying sometimes
[1:25:07] there's things like that that just and
[1:25:10] you look at it and say well well
[1:25:12] i ought to have that freedom but
[1:25:13] remember it is your liberty
[1:25:15] but you've got liberty here that's
[1:25:17] what's most important
[1:25:19] you have a liberty here you're not
[1:25:21] condemned within it
[1:25:22] this is what paul says hast thou faith
[1:25:25] have it to
[1:25:26] thyself before god
[1:25:29] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[1:25:33] in the thing that he allows so what
[1:25:37] is allowed don't condemn yourself
[1:25:40] by putting it out and then where it
[1:25:42] troubles
[1:25:43] others it could be a wrong example
[1:25:47] in the wrong example it's not that it's
[1:25:48] sin remember
[1:25:50] what paul is saying sometimes there's
[1:25:52] things that just out of a weakness of
[1:25:54] conscience
[1:25:56] watch how paul would govern this i'm
[1:25:58] closing here
[1:25:59] watch how charity would govern this in
[1:26:01] paul's life
[1:26:02] in first corinthians 10 23 all things
[1:26:05] are lawful for me
[1:26:07] but all things are not expedient all
[1:26:10] things are lawful for me
[1:26:11] but all things edify not right
[1:26:14] paul said i'm a liberty i'm a liberty
[1:26:19] all things are lawful but not everything
[1:26:21] edifies that's right
[1:26:23] paul was evaluating not whether it was
[1:26:26] lawful to him or not
[1:26:28] does it edify right
[1:26:32] i tell you this to me this this
[1:26:34] scripture
[1:26:36] it speaks of even that character that
[1:26:38] nature that paul was speaking of
[1:26:41] in philippians 2 look not every man on
[1:26:44] his own things
[1:26:46] but also on the things of other there
[1:26:47] ought to be an awareness
[1:26:49] in order to be an awareness of of of one
[1:26:51] another
[1:26:52] awareness within this assembly awareness
[1:26:56] of that of the body where god has placed
[1:26:59] us
[1:26:59] an awareness of these things and what's
[1:27:01] around us
[1:27:05] it says where paul would go on he would
[1:27:07] express
[1:27:08] these things and he would say it in this
[1:27:11] manner can i read these to you
[1:27:14] whatever sold in the shambles that eat
[1:27:18] asking no questions for conscience sake
[1:27:21] the earth is the lord's and the fullness
[1:27:22] thereof
[1:27:23] if any of if any of them that believe
[1:27:25] not bid you to a feast so
[1:27:27] unbelievers invite you to come over
[1:27:29] whatsoever is set before you
[1:27:31] eat asking no questions for conscience
[1:27:33] sake he's dealing with the meat
[1:27:36] because if you ask was this offered to
[1:27:38] idols
[1:27:39] and they say yes and you go ahead and
[1:27:41] eat they perceive it
[1:27:42] they're they're eating it to idols but
[1:27:45] in reality there's liberty in your heart
[1:27:47] it's meat the earth is the lords and the
[1:27:51] fullness thereof
[1:27:52] i'm not eating it because it was offered
[1:27:54] to the idol
[1:27:56] like sometimes you look at some of those
[1:27:59] you see pictures of those buddha temples
[1:28:01] and whatever
[1:28:01] they got some good looking cakes in
[1:28:02] there you know i mean three tiered cakes
[1:28:05] and chocolate cakes and things like that
[1:28:07] no wonder that that guy's big
[1:28:11] but if any man saying to you this is
[1:28:13] offered in sacrifice unto idols
[1:28:15] eat not for his sake that showed it and
[1:28:18] for conscience saying
[1:28:19] for the earth is the lords and the
[1:28:20] fullness thereof conscience i say
[1:28:23] not thine own but of the other
[1:28:27] paul said why is my liberty judged of
[1:28:29] another man's conscience
[1:28:31] for if i by grace be a partaker why am i
[1:28:34] evil spoken of
[1:28:35] for that for which i give things
[1:28:39] whether therefore you eat or drink or
[1:28:40] whatsoever you do
[1:28:42] do it all to the glory of god amen
[1:28:47] give none offense neither to the jews
[1:28:50] nor to the gentiles
[1:28:52] nor to the church of the living god
[1:28:55] that's a challenge
[1:28:56] because james said we offend all is that
[1:28:59] right
[1:29:00] we've things whether it's been sadder or
[1:29:03] whatever more
[1:29:04] but the objective is god help us to be
[1:29:06] sensitive
[1:29:09] help us to be sensitive to be sensitive
[1:29:12] to him
[1:29:12] amen and i think even in this time and
[1:29:16] in the hour that that we're living in
[1:29:18] just some things that wasn't even in my
[1:29:20] notes but
[1:29:20] what we see going around this is where
[1:29:22] we want the holy spirit and it's not
[1:29:25] just in
[1:29:26] those things of mask and no mask and
[1:29:27] this and that
[1:29:29] it's beyond that it's god help us to be
[1:29:31] sensitive
[1:29:34] help us to be censored help us to have a
[1:29:36] real discernment
[1:29:38] within things to discern and discern
[1:29:41] this one thing
[1:29:42] discern the body of the lord to stand
[1:29:45] there as a
[1:29:46] as a real soldier of god to say
[1:29:49] satan you have no part here
[1:29:53] because there can be certain things
[1:29:54] there's certain things that you that
[1:29:56] you as an individual can have certain
[1:29:58] convictions
[1:29:59] certain beliefs even certain thinkings
[1:30:01] about some of the things that
[1:30:03] you know as we're dealing with that's
[1:30:04] not the problem where it becomes the
[1:30:06] problem
[1:30:07] is where you start taking things and
[1:30:09] looking down on somebody else
[1:30:11] as though you know more and this and
[1:30:14] that
[1:30:14] that's not of god so it's always
[1:30:17] evaluating those things even brother
[1:30:19] branham talked about even in bringing
[1:30:20] the message
[1:30:21] he said we don't bring it with the
[1:30:23] motive of saying
[1:30:25] we're right you're wrong see that's not
[1:30:28] the motive
[1:30:29] it's truth it's the spirit of truth it's
[1:30:32] god
[1:30:33] has delivered his word in this hour but
[1:30:34] the motive behind it
[1:30:36] is not we're right and you're wrong
[1:30:40] if the word has gone out to catch the
[1:30:42] elect of god
[1:30:44] and it's god's grace that we that we
[1:30:46] would see it verse 33
[1:30:47] even as i please all men
[1:30:51] in all things not seeking mine own
[1:30:53] prophet
[1:30:54] but the prophet of many that they may be
[1:31:00] saved
[1:31:06] may god help us
[1:31:09] may god help us that even in
[1:31:12] the understanding and the knowledge that
[1:31:15] god
[1:31:16] has given to us may it may be governed
[1:31:19] with charity when you see when we look
[1:31:22] at things
[1:31:22] we see things may god
[1:31:26] may we not may not be you feel
[1:31:29] what we feel or i feel we know more than
[1:31:32] somebody else
[1:31:33] and may we look and recognize and know
[1:31:36] it's god's grace it's things that
[1:31:40] you might see there's things we might
[1:31:41] even differ
[1:31:43] but we have one common purpose and one
[1:31:46] common goal
[1:31:49] we're looking to him and that the body
[1:31:50] of jesus christ
[1:31:52] is edified that god be lifted up that
[1:31:56] souls would be saved and filled with the
[1:31:59] holy ghost
[1:32:01] lives would be build up
[1:32:04] in him we would grow in grace and in
[1:32:07] knowledge
