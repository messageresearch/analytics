[37:16] lives. The most precious. Amen. Just so
[37:19] good to be together once again in the
[37:22] presence of the Lord. And um just to be
[37:24] gathered together. And um I know u
[37:28] brother Brian mentioned different ones
[37:30] as I know the youth camp will be letting
[37:33] out there tomorrow and um I've been able
[37:36] just to tune in a little bit here and
[37:38] there to see in some of the services and
[37:41] just so thankful for everything that the
[37:43] Lord is doing. Amen. And uh I I just was
[37:47] telling the Lord today in prayer, I'm so
[37:49] thankful for every every ministering
[37:51] gift. And I said, Lord, I'm not saying
[37:53] that as I'm not saying that as one as a
[37:56] part of. I'm saying one who's a benefit
[37:58] of. I thank God for every gift that he's
[38:00] given in the body. And I so appreciate
[38:03] uh one thing I so appreciate is such a
[38:05] balance within the word of God that's
[38:08] you know just pointing uh the young
[38:10] people to a real a real true reality and
[38:14] to minister Amen. the Lord to their
[38:16] heart. So it just is a we want to pray
[38:19] for them. I know many will be traveling
[38:21] back throughout all over the country and
[38:23] um and I want to say I'm so thankful for
[38:26] those uh for the meetings there and uh
[38:29] so thankful for every one of the youth
[38:30] meetings even those that I've never been
[38:32] to before. I'm so thankful that it's
[38:34] Amen. that God has has all of that
[38:36] provided. It's certainly a lot more than
[38:39] when the Lord first got a hold of my
[38:40] life. there was only a few, a handful.
[38:42] And uh sometimes we would, you know, you
[38:44] would travel if you could when they were
[38:46] going to even have like a Saturday or a
[38:48] Friday, you know, somewhere in a church.
[38:51] But I'm so thankful for all the the
[38:53] different meetings that are had. And uh
[38:55] we just thank God for that. We want to
[38:58] just turn our attention here in the word
[39:00] of the Lord here. And um I'd like to
[39:02] just try to go just a little further
[39:04] here tonight
[39:07] and uh to see how the Lord will direct
[39:09] us.
[39:11] I certainly believe that in everything,
[39:13] God always has our best interest in
[39:15] mind. Amen. I I found come to find that
[39:18] in all things. So,
[39:22] uh it's so good. I know I I didn't
[39:24] mention it on Sunday, but it's so good
[39:26] to see Sister Maria here.
[39:28] I was in here on last Thursday and and
[39:30] how the Lord just is moving for her and
[39:33] um I'm going to tell you I'm going to
[39:35] preach with a prayer cloth for your mom
[39:37] here tonight. It just was really it was
[39:39] you are praying there. I just felt I'm
[39:41] going to do that here tonight and let's
[39:43] just join together in prayer as we get
[39:46] ready to approach the word and uh just
[39:50] look to look to the Lord to move here.
[39:52] You've heard that about uh Marco Miranda
[39:54] and uh he really needs just a real touch
[39:57] from the Lord and uh also that God will
[40:00] just continue to move on his heart. As I
[40:02] was talking with sister Anna here today
[40:05] um he shared with his mom, you know, he
[40:07] was uh listening to a message and I said
[40:10] um I said I'm thankful for that and I'm
[40:14] just you know the whole the whole thing
[40:15] is is that is that our hearts would be
[40:17] turned to accept what God has already
[40:20] done. And that's brother Brandham when
[40:22] he spoke to the young people there in
[40:24] come follow me there in that little
[40:26] gathering in Arizona he said uh it must
[40:29] be so imperative it's not to teach he
[40:31] said and train our young people that
[40:33] it's not what you can do but it's to
[40:35] accept what he has done for you and we
[40:38] can accept that and then when you accept
[40:41] that then the works themselves will
[40:42] they'll come out of that acceptance amen
[40:46] because works don't lead to belief it's
[40:47] belief then works follow what you
[40:50] believe. Amen. So, we want to continue
[40:52] to remember them in prayer and also as
[40:54] Matthew mentioned there uh for his
[40:56] mother, Sister Carmen, we had prayer
[40:59] here with her on the phone here just uh
[41:01] some days ago. Actually, I think it was
[41:02] over a week ago. So, we want to just
[41:04] continue to u just remember her in
[41:07] prayer, too. She's really been battling
[41:08] in her in her in her back. Um been hard
[41:12] to get around with her leg and so forth.
[41:14] So, they think it's a I think a pinched
[41:17] nerve, I think. So, um, we want to just
[41:20] ask the Lord just to move for her in a
[41:23] special way. Okay, let's just go to the
[41:26] Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[41:29] as we just take, oh God, each of these
[41:31] requests, there are so many needs, Lord,
[41:34] that, Father, are upon our hearts, Lord,
[41:38] and needs that we have, Lord, that are
[41:41] are wrote, Lord. needs that Lord that
[41:44] maybe Lord as individuals we know from
[41:46] different text threads Lord and just all
[41:49] around the world Lord and Father yet
[41:53] Lord how that you have every aspect
[41:55] covered Lord you are still Lord Jehovah
[42:00] Raa Lord and Lord for these needs that
[42:03] we have here Lord locally in the body we
[42:06] thank you Lord for how that you have
[42:08] moved Lord and been moving for sister
[42:10] Maria Lord And we just ask God as we're
[42:14] so thankful to see her here this evening
[42:16] and Lord there on Sunday we ask that
[42:18] you'll continue to move for brother Dave
[42:20] Crest Lord in his body Lord and that
[42:22] shoulder Lord and we pray heavenly
[42:25] father as well Lord for sister Carmen
[42:28] Lord you you see the need Lord that is
[42:31] there Lord that affliction Lord and
[42:33] where the troubling in her body father I
[42:36] pray may the angel of the Lord just
[42:39] visit Lord the neighborhood Lord Lord,
[42:41] may you move, Lord. I pray for our
[42:44] sister's need. Lord, may you bring,
[42:46] Lord, a real relief, Lord. I pray to her
[42:50] body, Lord Jesus. For Lord, it's by your
[42:53] stripes that were healed, Lord. And
[42:55] Father, we remember, Lord, Marco Miranda
[42:58] as well, Lord.
[42:59] just blow God even in these moments Lord
[43:03] may he just Lord coming into that place
[43:06] Lord to even just to accept what you
[43:09] have done for him Lord I pray God Lord
[43:13] you've never made Lord your word
[43:15] complicated Lord it's very simple Lord
[43:19] may you just make yourself so real to
[43:21] him Lord I pray let him know God that
[43:25] what you did for him Lord that he was
[43:28] included Lord Lord, and may your grace
[43:30] just move upon his heart. And Lord, I
[43:33] just ask now for every Lord God, each
[43:35] one that has children, Lord, that may
[43:37] bear wayward. We lift them up under that
[43:40] same request, Lord God, that Father, you
[43:43] might just become a real, Lord,
[43:46] revealing of Calvary to their heart,
[43:48] Lord. No matter where they're at, Lord,
[43:51] may you touch their hearts, Lord. Let
[43:53] them know, Lord, what you've done for
[43:55] them, Lord. Oh God, for none of us are
[43:58] worthy, Lord. But the pardon, Lord, is
[44:02] given, Lord. And may they just take of
[44:04] that pardon and accept it, Lord. For
[44:07] Lord, there's strength in that pardon,
[44:08] Lord, to rise, oh God, in the newness of
[44:12] life. Grant it, Lord, we pray. And Lord,
[44:15] we just ask as we would look into your
[44:17] word tonight, God, give us grace once
[44:20] again, Lord. May you just direct our
[44:22] hearts, Lord, here in the word and just
[44:25] speak to us, Lord, the things that would
[44:27] be pleasing to you, Lord, beneficial to
[44:30] our lives, Lord, for it, Lord, we want
[44:32] to please you in all ways, Lord. We love
[44:35] you and we thank you now, Father, in the
[44:38] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[44:41] Amen.
[44:44] Amen.
[44:47] Hold on, just a second here. I
[44:51] Hebrews chapter 12 is where I'm going to
[44:53] go here tonight and and and and pick up
[44:56] there and I'll have it here on the
[44:58] screen here.
[45:04] I want to go here in verse just read
[45:06] through verse 5 through verse 13.
[45:11] And here Paul is writing and says, "Have
[45:14] you forgotten the exhortation which
[45:16] speaketh unto you as unto children,
[45:20] my son, despise not thou the chastening
[45:24] of the Lord, nor faint when thou art
[45:28] rebuked of him. For whom the Lord
[45:30] loveth, he chastineth and scourgeeth
[45:34] every son whom he receiveth." And if you
[45:38] endure chastening, God dealeth with you
[45:42] as with sons. For what son is he whom
[45:45] the father chastineth not? But if you be
[45:49] without chastisement,
[45:51] whereof all are partakers, then are ye
[45:55] bastards and not sons. Verse nine.
[46:00] Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
[46:03] flesh, which corrected us, and we gave
[46:05] them reverence. Shall we not much rather
[46:09] be in subjection unto the father of
[46:12] spirits and live? For they verilely for
[46:16] a few days chastened us after their own
[46:19] pleasure, but he for our our profit,
[46:22] that we might be partakers of his
[46:25] holiness. Now no chastening for the
[46:28] present seemth to be joyous, but
[46:31] grievious. Nevertheless, afterward it
[46:35] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[46:37] righteousness unto them which are
[46:40] exercised thereby.
[46:42] Wherefore lift up hands which hang down,
[46:46] and the feeble knees, and make straight
[46:49] paths for your feet, lest that which is
[46:52] lame be turned out of the way. but let
[46:55] it rather be healed. Amen. May God bless
[46:58] you. Bless the reading of the word as
[46:59] you're being seated.
[47:01] I'd like to speak
[47:04] uh move into this point. We've been
[47:06] looking at subject to the spirit and I'd
[47:08] like to look at this part on receiving
[47:12] the benefit of correction. And um
[47:16] brother Brandham would spend much time
[47:19] not only within the church order message
[47:21] but in the revelation series um Hebrew
[47:26] series uh questions and answers God
[47:29] being misunderstood in many places
[47:32] brother Brham would take that and this
[47:34] is where that he could stand there in
[47:37] Christ the mystery of God revealed when
[47:40] he's opening that that message and
[47:44] remind the people that we have tapes on
[47:48] the correction and on discipline and how
[47:51] that we are to conduct ourselves and how
[47:54] things are to be u conducted, you know,
[47:57] within in in in church and in the
[48:00] services and so forth. And so, you know,
[48:02] God laid all of that in store for you
[48:05] and I. And I certainly believe that it's
[48:08] more than something that's just
[48:09] rudimentary principles of things of just
[48:13] um words. But I believe to see when we
[48:15] look at what real correction is is to
[48:18] see be able to see what God's heart is
[48:21] within it. Because when God has God has
[48:25] a true motive, he has a true desire. We
[48:28] know that uh within us as as parents
[48:32] there's things that you know we always
[48:34] have to be aware of um our humanity.
[48:39] This is where that David would speak uh
[48:42] even to even to the Lord and say uh
[48:45] chasen me not in thy hot displeasure
[48:48] uh not in thy wrath not in thy anger and
[48:51] to understand as David said lest I be
[48:54] consumed. And those were just insights.
[48:57] And you could see even how that when
[48:59] when Israel had had failed and went
[49:02] astray and did what they did, even after
[49:04] God had already spoke to them and let
[49:08] them know previous chapters on what not
[49:10] to do. Don't don't make anything of the
[49:12] likeness of, you know, the earth and so
[49:14] forth. And here they turn around and
[49:16] they do exactly the opposite. And yet
[49:19] God is ready now to move and to consume
[49:22] them. But it is the spirit of Christ
[49:25] that raises up in Moses life. And
[49:27] brother Brandham calls that that example
[49:30] the power of a believer. And he also
[49:33] speaks to it and says, you see, he says,
[49:36] put the word there before God. God will
[49:39] not cross over his word. And it was a
[49:42] spirit of Christ that was within Moses
[49:44] because uh to bring about what God has
[49:49] laid out in his word, God has provided
[49:51] to us of his spirit which is his word
[49:55] which is nothing different from whom he
[49:56] is. But God has provided for you and I
[50:00] of what it is needed in order that what
[50:03] are what might be brought out of our
[50:05] lives and things that are to be curbed
[50:08] out and and uh uh and transformation
[50:11] take place. God has provided grace to
[50:14] you and I. You know, God has provided
[50:16] grace in our lives that we could even
[50:18] understand ourselves. Yeah, that takes a
[50:22] lot of courage to be able to see that
[50:24] because every one of us, the Bible says,
[50:27] "I'm fearfully and wonderfully made."
[50:29] And just as much as God has made you or
[50:32] I in a certain way and just like he told
[50:35] the prophet when the prophet became
[50:37] frustrated with how uh you know, he
[50:40] wasn't hitting the squirrels in the eye
[50:41] and he put his gun down against the
[50:43] tree. Why am I this way? And the spirit
[50:45] of the Lord spoke to him and said, "I've
[50:47] made you this way." And you realize that
[50:49] brother Brandham in out of the
[50:51] temperaments, brother Brandham will say
[50:52] it over and over and you can pick it up
[50:53] clear as you can with many others
[50:56] through the scriptures. You can kind of
[50:57] pick out their temperament within there.
[50:59] And brother Brandham was very
[51:00] melancholy. Melancholy can fly so high
[51:03] and they can be everything is so
[51:05] perfect, but when they're low, they're
[51:06] low. And so there's a part of that. But
[51:09] see within that when God says I've made
[51:13] you that way for a purpose, it wasn't
[51:14] just that just to say that everything
[51:17] about your temperament is perfect. But
[51:19] God was letting him know there's a part
[51:21] of it that I have placed there that as
[51:25] me dwelling in the midst of your life.
[51:26] That's why brother Bram says in why
[51:28] people are so tossed about. He says when
[51:30] the Holy Spirit has come into your life,
[51:32] he says he sets down in the middle of
[51:36] your temperament.
[51:37] It's him living his life through your
[51:40] temperament. So, it's Christ living his
[51:42] life because God God has a reason. So,
[51:45] sometimes the things that we're looking
[51:47] at and we're trying to get rid of is
[51:49] actually things that you'll never get
[51:51] rid of. But you have to re over it. And
[51:54] the only way we can re over it is to
[51:56] recognize our weakness and our
[51:58] littleness and to recognize that it's
[52:00] not always in some ways a plus or a
[52:02] strength. Abraham was a man of great
[52:05] faith, but his faith could never put
[52:07] Ishmael in the promise. There you go.
[52:10] Strong faith. But see, he had to Abraham
[52:13] had to be taught through through the
[52:15] leadership of the Holy Spirit, God
[52:17] working with Abraham's life throughout
[52:20] that there was the times for that of
[52:22] that strong faith. And we know that that
[52:24] was all energized by God. But it's just
[52:26] like with everything about our lives and
[52:29] and times. I mean, hey, it it it
[52:31] sometimes can be a good thing for a
[52:32] person who's a very uh passive person.
[52:35] Maybe they're the life of the party and
[52:37] whatever more, but there's that
[52:38] sometimes can be a very good thing to to
[52:41] have and then it can be a very bad thing
[52:43] at other times. So, the Holy Spirit
[52:46] leading us and directing us in our lives
[52:48] to know how and when. You know, after
[52:50] all, the prophet tells us that's what
[52:52] the real anointing is all about is to
[52:54] know how and when. And so, we understand
[52:57] anointing isn't a feeling. I I'm not I'm
[52:59] not waiting until I come into this
[53:01] church to be under the anointing. We are
[53:03] under the anointing of the word in this
[53:04] hour. When the Holy Spirit has come upon
[53:07] our life, we have been anointed
[53:09] quickened for the purpose of almighty
[53:11] God. It's just staying in contact with
[53:14] the anointing upon our lives. And so
[53:17] when we look at this here, there is a
[53:19] benefit of correction. And I don't I
[53:21] don't want you to take into thought here
[53:23] tonight of just always that with with
[53:26] correction that it's always about
[53:27] something of you're doing this wrong or
[53:29] doing that wrong or doing or something
[53:31] of you know a belt or a rod. It's much
[53:33] deeper than that. There's ways as we
[53:36] were looking at it last week the ways
[53:37] that God can bring correction and
[53:40] direction to our lives by just even
[53:42] being a lived example. It can be even
[53:46] how that God will come right through the
[53:48] word and there's things that the Holy
[53:49] Spirit will so inspire to our heart and
[53:52] you will catch something and immediately
[53:54] your heart is set to a place to say oh
[53:57] God give me grace in that area of my
[53:59] life and it's God working the whole time
[54:01] and it's not he's not taking a rod to
[54:03] you but it's something you realize that
[54:05] there's an area in your life I need to
[54:07] correct this I need to hone this in and
[54:09] that's something that comes even as we
[54:12] mature because we have to be able to
[54:14] receive receive correction because if we
[54:16] receive correction there's the benefit
[54:19] to that and the real benefit is is that
[54:22] we're it becomes more like God the
[54:25] benefit is is growth the benefit is that
[54:28] God will entrust more to our lives and
[54:31] our hearts so when look I love this
[54:34] statement that brother Brandham makes
[54:35] here in the church age book brother says
[54:38] here here and now he's referring to this
[54:40] portion of scripture we read herein now
[54:42] is set forth the love of God. He desired
[54:45] in love a family of his own, a family of
[54:48] sons, sons like himself. There before
[54:52] him lies all mankind as one lump of
[54:56] clay. And out of that same lump he will
[54:59] now make vessels unto honor and unto
[55:02] dishonor. The choosing will be his own
[55:06] choosing. Then those chosen ones born of
[55:10] his spirit will be trained to conform to
[55:14] his image in their walk.
[55:18] Now this choosing of vessels unto honor
[55:21] and dishonor
[55:23] we understand this is already before the
[55:25] foundation of the world. Even you pick
[55:27] up in Romans nine and you look at Moses
[55:30] and you look at Pharaoh and here Pharaoh
[55:33] himself vessel of dishonor. Moses a
[55:36] vessel of honor. But what is that that
[55:39] brought that display out of honor or
[55:41] dishonor? It was their response to the
[55:44] word of God in their hour. That's what
[55:48] reveals what is really there. See God
[55:51] the light comes to only raise up the
[55:54] seed. That's why when the prophet tells
[55:56] us in rising of the sun, he said the
[55:58] seed ne or the light never came to bring
[56:02] the dirt to life. It only came to raise
[56:04] up the seed where dirt is housed around
[56:07] it. And so it's the seed that the light
[56:10] and the water. It came to nourish to
[56:13] raise that up because upon the ground
[56:15] it's only a temporary thing. Eventually
[56:17] like the ground out here now it's dry
[56:20] and and pretty soon after a time you
[56:22] know winter will come first fall and
[56:24] it'll be saturated again then it'll
[56:26] become cold again and so forth. But the
[56:29] the seed and the germ that's within that
[56:31] those plants, it will live on as it
[56:34] serves its purpose. And there's a
[56:36] reproducing of the life as it'll come
[56:38] back into seed form. And that's the same
[56:41] that's that's God's desire is that the
[56:43] light and the and the nourishment of the
[56:45] Holy Spirit that it's continuing to
[56:48] release what God knew that he's placed
[56:51] within every one of you. So, it's God
[56:53] it's God working in our lives. And you
[56:56] know, here's the thing that to me is
[56:57] just so beautiful when we read that
[56:59] scripture, it it speaks children. It
[57:02] speaks sons. And then the only only word
[57:05] that we read out of there of when it
[57:07] comes to a place of to one that will not
[57:11] receive correction and is without
[57:13] chastisement, it is not a son, but a
[57:16] bastard child. And so what is it that
[57:19] actually brings that into manifestation?
[57:22] It's the lack of receiving correction.
[57:26] See, that's what happened with Abel and
[57:28] Cain. This is what happens throughout.
[57:30] God sends his word to every generation
[57:33] and within that generation there are
[57:35] there are hearts that will rise. That's
[57:38] what brother Bram tells us in um in the
[57:41] Ladyan age and he's speaking of the last
[57:44] scripture that is mentioned there. Be
[57:46] zelious therefore and repent. And
[57:48] brother Bram says, "See, many of the
[57:50] true have repenting to do." And to be
[57:53] honest, that's the only ones that's
[57:54] really going to repent because
[57:56] repentance is not about getting caught
[57:59] and feeling sorry we got caught. Right.
[58:01] That's good. That's real good. This is
[58:03] why that even in repentance. It's not
[58:06] about, let me just say, it's not about
[58:08] just being moved under under under the
[58:11] spirit. It's to recognize our wrong. And
[58:14] repentance means turn from it. Amen.
[58:17] There's already a turning from and not
[58:19] not a not just a it's almost like an
[58:22] unloading and then we and then we pick
[58:24] up with the same thing that we repented
[58:26] of. No, that's not true repentance. True
[58:28] repentance is to turn from that which
[58:32] where we were. And so that's the same
[58:34] way as it continues throughout our life
[58:37] and our walk with God. And there's a
[58:39] choosing. And I I I love how the prophet
[58:41] says, "Those chosen ones born of his
[58:44] spirit will be trained to conform to his
[58:47] image in their walk." Training is a huge
[58:51] thing. He goes on to say, "He reproves
[58:54] with longsuffering
[58:56] and gentleness and mercy.
[58:59] He chasens with nail scarred hands."
[59:03] Listen, God had God uh uh omnis and
[59:06] having all knowledge, but God never had
[59:09] the experience of what it was like to
[59:12] walk here and to go through the the the
[59:15] the journey, all the journey the whole
[59:18] way through. He understands what it's
[59:20] like of all the challenges of of a
[59:23] teenager. He understands what all of
[59:26] those those places are like. He he
[59:28] understands all of that and he
[59:30] understands even what it is for our
[59:33] lives of how then even within our lives
[59:37] how even after God begins to deal with
[59:40] our life the spirit of the Lord taking
[59:41] over he understands listen when he went
[59:45] back to glory and the body was caught
[59:48] back up he never left that understanding
[59:51] on the earth he took that understanding
[59:54] back
[59:56] that's why the Bible says says that he's
[59:58] a high priest that can be touched by the
[1:00:00] feeling of our infirmities. He suffered
[1:00:03] is all points. The word suffered means
[1:00:05] he went through a sensible experience.
[1:00:09] So he understands what you and I go
[1:00:12] through. And this is why Satan always
[1:00:15] wants to try to uh get between you and
[1:00:18] your sacrifice, get between you and your
[1:00:20] high priest. But I wanted to say to you
[1:00:22] is is that you have the authority to to
[1:00:25] make sure there's nothing that stands
[1:00:28] there. And if there is something that
[1:00:30] would happen to get in there, go to him
[1:00:33] quickly and he is there to resolve
[1:00:36] whatever is there. And he understands
[1:00:40] even as we're coming in to situations,
[1:00:42] even with things in our life, when we
[1:00:45] look in our own lives and say, "Lord,
[1:00:47] this is difficult on me. Lord, this is
[1:00:49] hard. This is a this is a challenging
[1:00:51] brother Samuel. That's not being very
[1:00:53] positive. Listen, we're talking about a
[1:00:56] high priest who is merciful and
[1:00:58] faithful. And God wants you and I to be
[1:01:01] honest. As a matter of fact, the prophet
[1:01:02] says with people being honest, oh, what
[1:01:06] God can do when people are honest with
[1:01:08] him. Hallelujah. And if we can't be
[1:01:10] honest with him, how can we be honest
[1:01:12] with one another?
[1:01:15] God's not looking down on you or I.
[1:01:17] Lord, I'm tempted in this area. Lord,
[1:01:19] this is He's looking down. He's there to
[1:01:21] minister to you. And I I I'm listen
[1:01:23] friends. I say that we need to take the
[1:01:26] other aspect that's provided for us
[1:01:28] instead of always looking to the throne
[1:01:30] of grace of Lord forgive me. How about
[1:01:33] let's take the rest of that scripture
[1:01:35] that we might find help in the time of
[1:01:38] need. Instead of waiting till we're
[1:01:41] overcome, let's go to him and say,
[1:01:43] "Lord, I need help right now, Lord. I
[1:01:46] need grace right now, Lord. You know
[1:01:49] what that's part of? That's part of
[1:01:50] maturing.
[1:01:53] That's part of recognizing that I'm not
[1:01:55] my own. I belong to him. It's part of
[1:01:57] recognizing that I need and I'm
[1:01:59] depending on him. I can do nothing in
[1:02:01] myself. But what I see the father doing
[1:02:04] that doeth the son likewise.
[1:02:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:02:10] He reproves. Notice with an
[1:02:12] understanding, right?
[1:02:15] is not just pow, he chasens.
[1:02:19] God is very patient.
[1:02:23] This next one is very, it's a very
[1:02:26] challenging thing. Sometimes this potter
[1:02:28] must take the vessel he is working on
[1:02:31] and thoroughly break it down in order
[1:02:34] that he may rebuild it exactly as he
[1:02:37] desires it. Amen.
[1:02:41] I've pondered this quote for many years
[1:02:43] and just looked at this statement and I
[1:02:45] just you know in my heart I've said oh
[1:02:48] God is undoubtedly there's areas even in
[1:02:51] our lives that God has allowed us to be
[1:02:54] thoroughly broken down and sometimes
[1:02:57] even in this aspect of it God has to
[1:03:00] allow a life to get to a place
[1:03:02] thoroughly broke down to where there's
[1:03:05] no other reliance we're not relying on
[1:03:07] anything else because why God's 's
[1:03:10] desire is to build us in his image, in
[1:03:14] his likeness. God is not making a
[1:03:17] patchwork quilt. He doesn't It's not
[1:03:20] It's not our nature mixing with his
[1:03:22] nature. That'll never work.
[1:03:25] But it must be his nature manifesting
[1:03:29] victory over our nature.
[1:03:33] That's subjection.
[1:03:35] That's the real victory there of
[1:03:37] Calvary. You're right.
[1:03:40] So I want you to think of this just
[1:03:42] thoroughly. He says but it's love. It's
[1:03:44] his love. Another way of his love there
[1:03:46] is not there cannot be. So with an with
[1:03:50] with the discipline the prophet tells us
[1:03:52] here even in the church age book he
[1:03:54] tells us that God disciplines with the
[1:03:57] subject's amendment in mind. So it's not
[1:04:01] about the temporary uh but it's it's the
[1:04:04] long term. Right? It's it it be it's
[1:04:08] dealing with what's here because if this
[1:04:10] is allowed to go on here, where will it
[1:04:12] be on down the road? So good. Right.
[1:04:15] That's why brother Brandham, he'll use
[1:04:17] examples throughout the message. You can
[1:04:18] comb through and find him. And brother
[1:04:20] Brand will talk about a young man has
[1:04:23] been able to get his way and he'll throw
[1:04:25] himself on the floor and everything
[1:04:27] else. And brother Bram says that that
[1:04:29] young man, he says if he gets married,
[1:04:31] he'll make hell on earth for his wife.
[1:04:34] You know why? He's been used to getting
[1:04:36] his own way. He knows how to, you know,
[1:04:38] contort the faith or or do this or the
[1:04:41] silent treatment or the He just is at a
[1:04:43] way. And you know what? What's fostered
[1:04:45] that has been the upbringing,
[1:04:49] right? Instead of just, you know, the
[1:04:52] buckling down and realizing that to see
[1:04:54] something that it's greater than what
[1:04:56] we're seeing here, then what does that
[1:04:58] lead to further on down the line?
[1:05:00] Because listen, this is why, as I've
[1:05:02] explained to you before, when I'm
[1:05:04] sighting in the guns or I'm sighting in
[1:05:06] the bow, I I don't take I don't take a
[1:05:08] shot at 40 yards with with the bow. I
[1:05:10] start out marking it with the pin at 5
[1:05:13] yards because if I can get it set at
[1:05:15] five yards, then I can set the other
[1:05:18] pins off of that. In other words, if
[1:05:20] it's hitting on target close, it'll hit
[1:05:22] on target further. Hallelujah. And it'll
[1:05:25] the adjustment will be made. And that's
[1:05:27] the way God deals with our lives is
[1:05:29] hitting on the mark in the little
[1:05:32] things, in the small things, and then in
[1:05:34] the bigger things, it'll be right on
[1:05:36] target. Amen. Thank you, Lord. That's so
[1:05:40] good.
[1:05:41] Now, I referenced this to you last week
[1:05:45] that this is one of the just a statement
[1:05:48] just just so the Lord just so pressed in
[1:05:51] my heart even of having this quote for
[1:05:53] some time for months and just looking at
[1:05:56] this last week and it's these two words
[1:05:58] instructors and not bosses
[1:06:02] just just be because as as we look at
[1:06:05] this brother Bram said God never sent
[1:06:07] brother Neville and I to be bosses not
[1:06:09] at Paul, we're just your brothers, you
[1:06:12] see, instructors in the gospel. So,
[1:06:14] let's all work together. What's what's
[1:06:16] the objective? Look what look what
[1:06:19] Paul's desire was within the Galatian
[1:06:21] church was not that they would become
[1:06:24] Paulites.
[1:06:26] That they would become many Paul's and
[1:06:28] act like Paul. It wasn't. Paul was a
[1:06:31] real unic. His desire was that it would
[1:06:34] be Christ formed in you. Right?
[1:06:38] It was a desire to see Christ manifested
[1:06:42] in the lives of the people. Think about
[1:06:44] that even in the in in the regards of
[1:06:47] even of our own children because every
[1:06:50] one of them are every one of them. I
[1:06:51] think of our three boys, they're all
[1:06:53] different yet they're they're they're
[1:06:55] very much alike. But even in my approach
[1:06:57] with all all three of them, they're
[1:06:58] different. even in their temperaments
[1:07:00] and their makeups and and how things are
[1:07:03] and everything yet within itself is a
[1:07:06] desire to to to God give me the wisdom
[1:07:09] on how to instruct them that the
[1:07:11] potential you placed within them might
[1:07:14] come out within its season and its time.
[1:07:18] It's an instructing because God knows
[1:07:20] about you or I. God knows what we have
[1:07:23] need of even in this hour and in this
[1:07:26] season.
[1:07:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:32] And a boss, a boss has no a boss has no
[1:07:36] investment. Yeah. You know, they're
[1:07:39] there. It's okay. It's just exchange in
[1:07:42] and out. It's just But but an instructor
[1:07:45] is one. I mean, to me, let me just say
[1:07:48] like this. When I was when I was
[1:07:49] teaching school, you know, the thing
[1:07:52] that I wanted to see is where the kids
[1:07:54] would come to a place of mastery in what
[1:07:56] I was teaching them to where that they
[1:07:59] would not just repeating it cuz that
[1:08:01] that would never work when they would
[1:08:03] become tested on on on the test and
[1:08:06] things and we could go and talk about
[1:08:07] all that, but but they need to be able
[1:08:09] to take think critically. They need to
[1:08:10] be able to decipher things and and go
[1:08:12] into there. The skills are necessary but
[1:08:15] you also have to be able to go into
[1:08:17] thing because life itself is word
[1:08:19] problems.
[1:08:21] That's true. Yes, sir. Is that right?
[1:08:23] That's good. Yeah. You know, and so when
[1:08:25] we're looking at that is that the desire
[1:08:28] that would burn within my heart is that
[1:08:30] I wanted them to be able to stand on
[1:08:33] their own two feet and be able to go
[1:08:35] through and and and to master those
[1:08:38] things that were being taught. Oh my.
[1:08:40] You know, some days I I would come home
[1:08:43] and my on my way home from some dusky I
[1:08:45] thought my it's man it's going I mean
[1:08:48] it's man this is this is just man we're
[1:08:51] we're just like a step ahead cuz I
[1:08:53] always knew where I was at even from the
[1:08:54] previous year and I would take previous
[1:08:56] challenges and and try to say okay what
[1:08:58] can I learn from this in approaching
[1:09:00] this year but then I'd come into the
[1:09:02] next week and man we're going going and
[1:09:04] all of a sudden on Friday you'd be in
[1:09:07] the middle of teaching and where did
[1:09:09] these kids come from
[1:09:12] who let the ones out that was here the
[1:09:14] other two weeks that I was saying my
[1:09:16] they're right on target. My they're
[1:09:18] making such progress. Let me just say it
[1:09:20] was like fractions or something. Oh my
[1:09:22] this and that and I think what happened
[1:09:24] who who who let them in and who let the
[1:09:26] others out and and man my here you are
[1:09:28] on a Friday my just be so down and my
[1:09:32] you know and I think oh no is the
[1:09:34] concept lost but we recognize there's a
[1:09:37] there's a there that that burden was
[1:09:39] there because you're wanting to see them
[1:09:41] grasp the concepts and be able to apply
[1:09:44] it right and how much greater God our
[1:09:49] heavenly father the
[1:09:52] the Holy Spirit. God's desire is to see
[1:09:55] his word reflected in our lives. Not
[1:09:58] just doing what's right because it's
[1:10:00] right because that's still wrong. Amen.
[1:10:03] But it's to do it from our heart. Amen.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:07] And the way that his word would come
[1:10:09] into our heart and our life is, Lord, I
[1:10:12] want to give myself to you, Lord. I want
[1:10:14] to adhere to that. I want to give myself
[1:10:17] because because it's got to be more than
[1:10:19] just what I know intellectually is
[1:10:21] right. It's got to be from the heart.
[1:10:24] That's the truth. That's what God works
[1:10:26] upon. That's what correction comes for
[1:10:28] is to drive foolishness out of the
[1:10:31] heart.
[1:10:33] Not just so that the outside looks
[1:10:35] exactly right and going through the
[1:10:37] part. But God wants a real image and an
[1:10:40] image that's durable. An image that is
[1:10:42] substance. an image when the word and it
[1:10:45] are placed on the balance of his word,
[1:10:47] it is held the same substance of
[1:10:50] character. Amen. It's God's desire. I
[1:10:53] say, "Oh God, grant him, Lord."
[1:10:57] So to be not bosses but instructors,
[1:11:01] look at this scripture. I read this to
[1:11:03] you last week.
[1:11:05] Ye fathers, now I want you to be fa look
[1:11:07] at this very carefully. you fathers. And
[1:11:10] yet it's it's parents included in your
[1:11:12] even in the previous verses. But
[1:11:14] fathers, the responsibility, provoke not
[1:11:17] your children to wrath, but bring them
[1:11:20] up in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:11:25] Lord. Let me just pull it up in the
[1:11:27] amplified. Fathers, do not irritate and
[1:11:31] provoke your children to anger.
[1:11:34] Do not exasperate them to resentment.
[1:11:38] but rear them tenderly in the training
[1:11:42] and discipline and counsel and
[1:11:45] admonition of the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:49] God's not interested,
[1:11:52] as I've said before, to crush our
[1:11:55] spirit, right? To bring us to a place to
[1:12:00] where there's no enthusiasm. That's not
[1:12:02] how God corrects. Right?
[1:12:04] when God corrects you. Listen, sometimes
[1:12:07] it's just it's our viewpoint on things.
[1:12:10] It's adjusting to a viewpoint of how God
[1:12:13] will work. and to see that it's God's
[1:12:16] desire is to not just, you know, not
[1:12:19] just be to where it's just a a continual
[1:12:22] uh, if I could say it, just always just
[1:12:24] just correction and and this is wrong
[1:12:27] and that's wrong and this is wrong, but
[1:12:29] God's desire is to lead us even as he
[1:12:32] sees the seasons that we're in right
[1:12:35] now.
[1:12:37] Let me just let me let me read this
[1:12:39] definition here from nurture. This word
[1:12:42] nurture here that we used out of the
[1:12:43] scripture, it's the whole training and
[1:12:46] education of children which relates to
[1:12:50] the cultivation of mind and morals and
[1:12:54] employs for this purpose now commands
[1:12:57] and admonitions now reproof and
[1:13:00] punishment. It also includes the
[1:13:02] training and the care of the body. I
[1:13:04] want you to notice it's a a key term
[1:13:06] here. There's a training that's going
[1:13:08] on. those chosen ones born of his spirit
[1:13:11] will be trained. Amen. See, God trains
[1:13:15] us. And and and how does God train us?
[1:13:18] God trains us by revealing himself to
[1:13:22] you or I. Amen.
[1:13:24] I hope that don't seem so obscure, but
[1:13:26] to understand the most powerful the word
[1:13:30] itself is a living image. Right. That's
[1:13:33] where when it comes down to it, what who
[1:13:36] are we and and to follow? When Paul
[1:13:39] said, "Follow me as I follow Christ," is
[1:13:41] not just following Paul as a man, but
[1:13:43] it's recognizing that image of Christ
[1:13:46] that I see being projected. That's what
[1:13:49] I'm following. And I'm following it
[1:13:51] through that ordained vessel that God
[1:13:54] has emitted that to my life. So, we're
[1:13:57] not what are we following? We're
[1:13:58] following a living image. This is why
[1:14:00] that the most powerful things within our
[1:14:03] homes is not a recitation of all the
[1:14:07] letters and everything else. Yet it is
[1:14:09] important that the word would be there.
[1:14:12] But what is so much greater than all the
[1:14:14] word is to have that of the living image
[1:14:17] of the word himself. Because in that
[1:14:20] image is life. In that image is
[1:14:22] longsuffering. In that image is
[1:14:24] forgiveness. In that image is the
[1:14:26] essence of who he is the word. Amen.
[1:14:29] Amen. That's why the prophet said that
[1:14:32] we are to be their Holy Ghost until they
[1:14:35] are old enough to receive it.
[1:14:39] And the next line, but first they have
[1:14:42] those adolescent days, right? Those days
[1:14:45] of suffering and
[1:14:48] working with them and dealing with them,
[1:14:51] right?
[1:14:53] Admonishing them. You don't see them
[1:14:55] changing here. Don't see him changing
[1:14:57] here. Every parent within when their
[1:15:00] children is coming to a place you want
[1:15:02] to see God to take a hold of their life
[1:15:04] right and you watch I watch watch
[1:15:08] experiences I want to see where's the
[1:15:09] depth of that where let's see where it
[1:15:11] goes I you know this is one thing this
[1:15:12] is one thing that that I I don't believe
[1:15:14] in doing I don't believe in taking away
[1:15:16] any experience from any person right
[1:15:19] right are you hearing me yes sir it's
[1:15:22] just like oh you you had this at camp or
[1:15:24] had this or had that well let's just see
[1:15:26] because it'll all it'll manifest Right.
[1:15:29] Okay. I mean, there's a lot right now I
[1:15:31] could go and start preaching there of
[1:15:33] even dealing with on the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] because sometimes there's even
[1:15:36] misconception of thoughts that, well,
[1:15:37] you'll never have any battle. You'll
[1:15:39] never have this and and that's just that
[1:15:40] that that's that's very skewed. That's
[1:15:43] not the word of God. You there there is
[1:15:45] a growth. There's a battle. There's a
[1:15:47] birth that takes place and you grow from
[1:15:49] there and you are learning to submit
[1:15:51] yourself to the word. Right? It's God
[1:15:54] working throughout your life. And yet
[1:15:56] with any experience, I I just say it
[1:15:58] like this. I've said it to countless
[1:15:59] young people, not just here, but
[1:16:01] throughout the world where I've been
[1:16:02] able to minister, and I've just said,
[1:16:03] "Look, every experience you've received,
[1:16:05] don't ever throw one away. It's from
[1:16:07] God."
[1:16:09] Look, Jacob had an experience first of
[1:16:11] all that never changed him. The
[1:16:14] experience that first of all that let
[1:16:16] him know when he came to Bethl and God
[1:16:18] showed up that night, but it never
[1:16:19] changed him. But he knew, he knew that
[1:16:22] the God his father talked about was
[1:16:24] real. Amen. And it was for him. Is that
[1:16:28] right? And we know what happened when he
[1:16:30] came back to that place. So it was an
[1:16:32] experience. That experience did not
[1:16:34] change him. But neither did that
[1:16:36] experience leave him. He came back to
[1:16:39] that place. This is why the Bible said
[1:16:41] that train up a child in the way that it
[1:16:44] should go and when it grows old, it will
[1:16:47] not depart. The prophet tells us it
[1:16:50] didn't mean that they wouldn't depart
[1:16:51] maybe from your midst. But that real
[1:16:54] experience of being in God's presence
[1:16:57] and a living image that would not depart
[1:17:00] from their mind.
[1:17:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. You're
[1:17:06] talking about confidence in the
[1:17:08] supernatural. That's why we must have
[1:17:10] and need the supernatural. That's why,
[1:17:13] friends, listen. That's why we just
[1:17:14] don't want to show up to a service. We
[1:17:17] want to be in prayer and oh God come
[1:17:19] down Lord and manifest yourself in our
[1:17:22] midst Lord. Impress Lord your presence,
[1:17:25] your image upon hearts and lives Lord.
[1:17:28] God hallelujah. Change situations Lord.
[1:17:32] Those that don't know you Lord don't let
[1:17:34] them have peace until they come to that
[1:17:36] place of a real submission to you.
[1:17:41] Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] It's a whole training. It's cultivating
[1:17:46] It's just like things that let me just
[1:17:47] say it to you. When the Holy Spirit is
[1:17:50] come into a life,
[1:17:54] the Holy Spirit coming into the life
[1:17:57] does not all of a sudden go back down
[1:17:58] through there and make up for all of the
[1:18:02] lack of or improper training that we
[1:18:06] didn't receive as children.
[1:18:08] That's where the Holy Spirit comes in.
[1:18:10] And there's got to be instruction. Thank
[1:18:12] God for the Holy Spirit that would
[1:18:13] protect a person. Let me just give you
[1:18:15] an example. Take for example a young
[1:18:16] lady that has never really been taught
[1:18:18] on how to conduct herself around a young
[1:18:20] man.
[1:18:22] She wasn't raised in that way. Oh,
[1:18:24] brother Samuel, that's just natural. You
[1:18:26] can't show me that. The whole thing
[1:18:28] about it is is that you see these things
[1:18:30] as it comes in. Then this training has
[1:18:32] to come in and move in. God will hold as
[1:18:34] an anchor in that life, but there has to
[1:18:36] come a cultivation. That's why Paul
[1:18:39] would speak through Titus on even the
[1:18:41] things that were to be done in that hour
[1:18:44] among the sons and daughters of God.
[1:18:46] Things that were to be instructed,
[1:18:48] things that were to be taught. It didn't
[1:18:50] mean that they would be worldly. It's
[1:18:51] things sometimes that then where the
[1:18:53] Holy Spirit through instruction has to
[1:18:56] reach down and there's a reshaping of
[1:18:59] our character.
[1:19:01] It's God working to give us instruction.
[1:19:04] And you know what instruction is? It's
[1:19:05] actually correction. Right? It's God.
[1:19:08] It's training that's coming to our lives
[1:19:11] and then how we're going to receive it.
[1:19:14] So God works in our lives as it as it
[1:19:16] goes on to say, it's whatever in adults
[1:19:19] also cultivates the soul, correcting
[1:19:21] mistakes and curbing passions. I would
[1:19:24] venture to say without us even raising
[1:19:26] our hands that there's things that in
[1:19:28] your life right now when the Holy Spirit
[1:19:30] has come into your life that there's
[1:19:32] things that now that you recognize I
[1:19:34] can't I can't go this way. I I I I I
[1:19:37] can't I can't no I I can't I can't give
[1:19:39] myself to this or I can't this or and
[1:19:42] and then you begin to also recognize as
[1:19:44] I said before things about your own
[1:19:46] temperament things about your own
[1:19:48] personality and you're not trying to
[1:19:50] filter everybody else through your
[1:19:51] personality nor are you making your p
[1:19:53] personality the absolute of the word but
[1:19:56] you recognize I am here in humanity
[1:19:59] there are flaws in my life and I need
[1:20:02] God's grace in my life and it's
[1:20:04] recognizing that there are times as I
[1:20:07] said that we can be ever so structured
[1:20:09] and there's times that yes that's
[1:20:11] necessary and there's times when it's we
[1:20:13] need God's grace to override that
[1:20:18] that's where that's where instruction
[1:20:19] comes in
[1:20:21] it's instruction that aims at increasing
[1:20:23] virtue I love that it's always God's
[1:20:27] interested in increasing our virtue
[1:20:29] increasing in our lives so receiving
[1:20:31] instruction let's let's run through some
[1:20:33] scriptures here the scripture Scripture
[1:20:36] says, "All scripture is given by
[1:20:38] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:20:42] doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
[1:20:46] for instruction in righteousness, that
[1:20:48] the man of God may be perfect, complete,
[1:20:53] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[1:20:55] works." It would be like you having a
[1:20:58] home and no furniture. Right?
[1:21:03] I remember what it was when my wife and
[1:21:06] I had our we had purchased and had our
[1:21:08] brand new double wide mobile home built.
[1:21:10] Oh, we were so happy when it came in.
[1:21:13] You know, we had beds and this was gift
[1:21:16] to us, this and this and this, but we
[1:21:17] had no furniture to sat on in the living
[1:21:20] room. And uh so you know it always makes
[1:21:23] you thankful you know every time you sit
[1:21:24] down on a couch now and when we got a
[1:21:26] couch because we had the plastic chairs
[1:21:28] that are uh like the chairs they use in
[1:21:31] the Philippines for church and other
[1:21:33] things and and that's what we had in in
[1:21:34] in our living room was was those was
[1:21:36] those kind of chairs. But you know think
[1:21:38] about what it is when God has done a
[1:21:40] work in your life he wants to furnish
[1:21:41] it. Amen. He wants to furnish your life
[1:21:45] and he furnishes what is it's his
[1:21:47] character that's coming out. And this is
[1:21:49] where God works in our life through
[1:21:51] through not only just doctrine. But
[1:21:53] there's reproof that comes. There's
[1:21:55] correction that comes deals with our
[1:21:57] character. And there's an instruction
[1:21:59] into righteousness. And this is why that
[1:22:02] the next scripture without me reading at
[1:22:04] all. This is why that Paul would charge
[1:22:06] Timothy of the need in this hour be
[1:22:09] instant in season and out of season.
[1:22:12] Right?
[1:22:13] There's a change that takes place and we
[1:22:16] have to know what season are we in.
[1:22:20] Right. I I think I've had many times
[1:22:22] parents tell me say, "My, you know, I
[1:22:24] wish my children, you know, they they're
[1:22:26] grown, got kids, and everything else.
[1:22:27] My, you know, I wish they was back to
[1:22:28] when they were little. I could just take
[1:22:29] them and put them in bed and everything.
[1:22:31] It's a different season." And within
[1:22:32] that season, you cannot approach them in
[1:22:34] the season they're in now like the
[1:22:36] season when they were five or six. It's
[1:22:38] a different season. Right. Right. But
[1:22:41] God is able to give us the grace that
[1:22:43] what we need to be in that season
[1:22:47] to minister to them to be of a help to
[1:22:50] them to guide and direct us. It's just
[1:22:53] as God takes a hold of our life even as
[1:22:55] even as uh uh coming to the Lord and how
[1:22:58] that God will work. I mean even in the
[1:23:00] midst of a course of a time throughout a
[1:23:03] church, God will work in seasons. one
[1:23:06] season here we are in this and another
[1:23:08] season over here and it's God working
[1:23:10] all along with that group of people to
[1:23:13] bring us to what into the image a and
[1:23:16] what God desires to bring out of our
[1:23:18] life what he knows is there in other
[1:23:20] words God's not going to be speaking to
[1:23:22] us of a season that we're not in right
[1:23:26] you you can't speak of a season that's
[1:23:28] way out here that's why the prophet said
[1:23:30] man's always wanting to look back at
[1:23:32] what God did always look ahead to what
[1:23:34] God will do and failing to recognize
[1:23:38] where he's at now
[1:23:40] because the strength of where he's at
[1:23:42] now will bring us where we need to be in
[1:23:45] this season so we're ready for next
[1:23:47] season. Yes. Amen. So God's working to
[1:23:51] direct us. This is why even think of it
[1:23:54] of the coming of the Lord upon our
[1:23:55] lives. how that Peter would write about
[1:23:58] what kind of people that we should be
[1:24:01] seeing that the coming of the Lord is
[1:24:03] upon us because the rapture is not going
[1:24:06] to change our character. The rapture is
[1:24:09] a transplanting.
[1:24:12] Is that right? That's what the the word
[1:24:14] the prophet used. It's a transplanting.
[1:24:16] It's taking that character that's here.
[1:24:18] And that's why the prophet would tell
[1:24:20] us, "Let it be. It is to be." the order
[1:24:23] of that city is to be reflected in our
[1:24:27] lives right now. And that's what's being
[1:24:29] ministered, the order of that city.
[1:24:31] Because the reality of that city, the
[1:24:33] life of that city, the lifegiver of that
[1:24:36] city, the mother of us all is that new
[1:24:39] Jerusalem,
[1:24:41] a lifegiver to bring out of our lives
[1:24:44] that which would now make our lives fit
[1:24:48] subjects for there. Hallelujah.
[1:24:52] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:54] And that part about fit subjects, it
[1:24:56] doesn't mean that we're here here in
[1:24:58] this time free from our flaws, free from
[1:25:00] No, it's now coming to a place. Maturity
[1:25:03] is recognizing our weaknesses and our
[1:25:06] littleness. Right?
[1:25:08] It's recognizing that within our lives,
[1:25:11] Lord, I need you more now. Amen. And
[1:25:15] that's not just just something that's
[1:25:17] saying that, but Lord, I need you. Lord,
[1:25:20] I need your grace, Lord, moving and
[1:25:22] operating and working in my life, Lord.
[1:25:25] Mold me, Lord. Shape me, Lord.
[1:25:29] Now, watch this. The scripture tells us
[1:25:32] in Hebrews 12:1, "Who so loveth
[1:25:35] instruction loveth knowledge, but he
[1:25:38] that hateth reproof is brutish."
[1:25:43] So whosoever loves instruction,
[1:25:46] loves knowledge, God instructing you and
[1:25:49] I, teaching you and I, showing us his
[1:25:52] word. And it rubs. Sometimes it rubs
[1:25:55] things. It rub. You know why? Because
[1:25:58] listen, this message will not mix with
[1:26:02] old leaven. That's right. This message
[1:26:05] is not an extension or a continuation of
[1:26:09] Isuza Street.
[1:26:11] No, that was the shock.
[1:26:14] The life has went out of the shack. The
[1:26:17] shuck pulled away from it. Amen. It
[1:26:19] wasn't the seed pulling away from the
[1:26:21] shuck. The shuck pulled away from the
[1:26:23] seed
[1:26:25] and didn't want it. No, I don't want
[1:26:27] this. But it was all in God's plan. And
[1:26:30] the life that went to make the seed is
[1:26:32] the life that went to make the sh. But
[1:26:34] in order to be a part of the rapture, we
[1:26:37] must go on with the seed. There you go.
[1:26:39] Because that's the promise. The seed
[1:26:42] would come back to itself. That is the
[1:26:44] promise of restoration. I am alpha and
[1:26:48] omega. Hallelujah.
[1:26:51] Yes. Is that right? Yes. So notice
[1:26:54] Proverbs 15:5. A fool despiseth his
[1:26:59] father's instruction, but he that
[1:27:02] regardeth reproof is wise.
[1:27:07] My
[1:27:09] It would be like this. What if, let's
[1:27:12] say, for example, Silas, what if I came
[1:27:14] to you
[1:27:16] and unbeknown to you,
[1:27:19] you're at a meeting that I'm at and your
[1:27:20] parents aren't there
[1:27:23] and your and your dad passes something
[1:27:25] on to me, sends a text, cannot get a
[1:27:27] text through to you, and I come to you
[1:27:30] and say, "Listen, your dad has noticed
[1:27:33] this and this and this and and he sent
[1:27:36] me to tell you."
[1:27:39] Oh my, I thought I was out of dad's side
[1:27:42] or I thought of this. You know, he might
[1:27:45] be able to look at me and say,
[1:27:49] right?
[1:27:51] But see, if I've talked with his father
[1:27:54] and his father has given instruction to
[1:27:57] tell him,
[1:27:59] then when he goes, it's not at me, it's
[1:28:03] at his father, Brian.
[1:28:06] Now, you see where this is coming from?
[1:28:09] That's good because to be able to
[1:28:11] discern his voice. The Bible said, "My
[1:28:14] sheep know my voice." Hallelujah.
[1:28:19] And when we when we're not acting like
[1:28:21] remember brother says when you know
[1:28:23] you've come to that place and you the
[1:28:25] way you're acting he said the dove just
[1:28:27] flew off. But the way to welcome the
[1:28:29] dove back is become a lamb again. How do
[1:28:33] we become a lamb? Submit ourselves to
[1:28:35] his character. Right? Submit ourselves
[1:28:38] to his life. Is that right? Notice
[1:28:43] Proverbs 19:25. Smite a scorner and the
[1:28:46] simple will be where? And reprove one
[1:28:48] that hath understanding and he will
[1:28:50] understand knowledge. Right? That's
[1:28:53] good. So it's already you see that the
[1:28:56] reproving God coming with correction and
[1:28:59] dealing with our lives. I mean look at
[1:29:01] what happened in the book of Acts when
[1:29:02] that of Ananas Safara. You had others
[1:29:04] that took place when God dealt with that
[1:29:06] situation. The fear of God fell on
[1:29:09] others. Right. Right. People even my the
[1:29:12] the the the church was moving them right
[1:29:15] under the word of God. They took heed to
[1:29:17] what God was doing. Is that right? And
[1:29:21] notice reprove one that hath
[1:29:23] understanding and he will understand
[1:29:26] knowledge. The reproving through the
[1:29:29] understanding. Well, how did he get
[1:29:30] understanding? That understanding had to
[1:29:32] come from God. How did that
[1:29:34] understanding get there? From an open
[1:29:35] heart. What is understanding? Is
[1:29:38] understanding just teaching? Is
[1:29:40] understanding just knowledge?
[1:29:42] Understanding is experience.
[1:29:44] Understanding is knowing him. It's
[1:29:48] understanding. Even through experiences
[1:29:50] of of things that I shouldn't have done
[1:29:52] this and and and and there was direction
[1:29:54] and correction come to my life. There's
[1:29:56] an understanding, a moment of
[1:29:59] understanding.
[1:30:00] Amen. Proverbs 21:11, "When the scorner
[1:30:03] is punished, the simple is made wise.
[1:30:07] And when the wise is instructed, he
[1:30:10] receiveth knowledge."
[1:30:13] See, it's just like many of these things
[1:30:15] that we looked at here, even within that
[1:30:17] of church order and things like that. It
[1:30:19] wasn't all together, brother Brandham
[1:30:21] coming down and saying, "You're wrong
[1:30:22] and this and that." It was giving
[1:30:24] instruction, right? It was giving
[1:30:27] guidance. That's what Paul was doing to
[1:30:31] the to the Corinthian church. That's
[1:30:33] what the Holy Spirit comes to deal with
[1:30:35] and move upon our lives. I I I I want to
[1:30:39] I want to receive that instruction. I
[1:30:41] want to receive it because there's a
[1:30:43] benefit from it in my life. I don't want
[1:30:44] to be I don't want the spirit of this
[1:30:46] age that's a know-it-all. I don't want
[1:30:48] that spirit. That's just that's an
[1:30:50] ungodly spirit. I I want that in my
[1:30:52] heart that God to be able to recognize
[1:30:54] his voice and submit myself to him.
[1:30:59] Amen.
[1:31:02] When the wise is instructed, he
[1:31:04] receiveth knowledge. Look at the
[1:31:05] benefit. David said, "I will bless the
[1:31:07] Lord who hath given me
[1:31:10] counsel. My reigns also instruct me in
[1:31:14] the night season." This is the this is a
[1:31:16] benefit of receiving the instruction
[1:31:21] of the Lord. Now, where's it at? In his
[1:31:23] heart. Right?
[1:31:25] You see, if it's just here, the
[1:31:27] Pharisees had it here. They didn't have
[1:31:29] it here. They didn't have it here. You
[1:31:32] can have it here, but it's got to be
[1:31:33] here. Because when it's here, it's not
[1:31:36] something that you're trying to do. It's
[1:31:38] something that is there. There's one on
[1:31:40] the control tower. It's life. It's not
[1:31:42] an intellectual faith. It's supernatural
[1:31:44] faith. Amen. Amen. And if you do, if you
[1:31:47] do wrong, if you go wrong, even thinking
[1:31:50] wrong, the Holy Spirit on the inside
[1:31:52] will bring correction.
[1:31:56] Hallelujah. Why? Because when the Holy
[1:31:58] Spirit has come into our life, that now
[1:32:01] the throne of God, a judgment seat of
[1:32:03] Christ where our sins are taken daily,
[1:32:05] there's conviction that strikes our
[1:32:07] heart.
[1:32:12] Hallelujah.
[1:32:14] This is where brother Brammo over and
[1:32:17] over in the messages he's tell talking
[1:32:19] about the tutor and he's talking about
[1:32:21] how that how do you think the Holy
[1:32:23] Spirit must must be when he goes before
[1:32:26] God brings our character our fussing
[1:32:29] fighting indifferences separating
[1:32:33] brother Ram goes on to say how he'll
[1:32:34] bring he'll bring he'll bring news back
[1:32:37] to the father your your child didn't go
[1:32:39] to church tonight the bells rung but
[1:32:40] they stayed home to look at television
[1:32:43] your daughters, they're dressing in
[1:32:45] morally on and on. He goes, he says, and
[1:32:47] yet he said, the Holy Spirit says, Lord,
[1:32:49] he says, how the Holy Spirit will say, I
[1:32:51] speak to their hearts to move them up
[1:32:53] and nurture them by the way, and they
[1:32:55] won't listen to it. When the minister
[1:32:58] will come to town to preach in the
[1:32:59] fullness of the power of the
[1:33:00] resurrection, people just walk by and
[1:33:02] make fun of it. The Holy Spirit has to
[1:33:05] bring that before the father. No,
[1:33:06] brother giving the dramatization of a
[1:33:08] tutor. He's dealing with the whole thing
[1:33:10] of the adoption of a son because your
[1:33:14] birth is not your adoption.
[1:33:17] The new birth when the new birth has
[1:33:19] come now the spirit of adoption has come
[1:33:21] in. Okay. when the spirit of God even
[1:33:24] dealing with a life, working upon a life
[1:33:26] and can you imagine that that where the
[1:33:28] Holy Spirit would turn a life around
[1:33:30] into a place of justification and then
[1:33:33] oh so thankful to fear things lifted
[1:33:35] from off their life and then you know
[1:33:37] the Holy Spirit the tutor begins to work
[1:33:39] and deal with her life and and begins to
[1:33:41] try to move upon things in her life and
[1:33:43] they come to a place to say I ain't
[1:33:44] going to do that I you don't have to
[1:33:46] dress like that you don't have to act
[1:33:47] like that you don't have to do that you
[1:33:49] don't have to do you know and they're
[1:33:50] telling the tutor
[1:33:54] what is not necessary and the tutor is
[1:33:57] the word himself.
[1:33:58] And you see this is why the Holy Spirit
[1:34:00] will not come upon an argumentative
[1:34:03] spirit.
[1:34:05] The Holy Spirit only comes upon a lamb.
[1:34:08] Amen. That's what the spirit of God
[1:34:10] comes to lead us to is to a place of
[1:34:13] being a lamb of submission to submit our
[1:34:17] rights.
[1:34:19] Yeah. So you see, brother Bra says here,
[1:34:22] the Holy Spirit would teach anything. If
[1:34:24] he does, it'll be right out of the
[1:34:25] Bible. He said that's the kind of tutor
[1:34:27] we got. The Holy Spirit to reveal and to
[1:34:29] bring the discipline book of the father
[1:34:32] and to reveal what God's plan is. And
[1:34:35] God does that in seasons.
[1:34:38] You Let me just say this. It's just
[1:34:40] like, listen, I certainly believe that a
[1:34:42] that a seed of God, my they can come to
[1:34:45] a reality of listening to marriage and
[1:34:47] divorce. I don't limit God.
[1:34:50] But you see things within seasons as
[1:34:53] something that'll stand out in a
[1:34:54] person's life. And and then you see with
[1:34:56] seasons as you begin to work and work
[1:34:58] with certain things in her life. Now you
[1:35:00] begin to see this, you know, coming on
[1:35:02] and then let's work with this and and
[1:35:04] then let's work with this. It's all
[1:35:05] within its season. God never overloaded.
[1:35:08] You are overloaded me. That's right.
[1:35:11] It's in seasons. And it's it's important
[1:35:14] to understand that season. It's just
[1:35:16] like can you imagine? Can you imagine
[1:35:17] telling you, you know, when when my
[1:35:19] children when I my boys were 10 years
[1:35:20] old, can you imagine how I'm telling
[1:35:21] now? This is how you got to change a
[1:35:22] lane. This is how you change a lane
[1:35:24] right here. When you come up here and
[1:35:25] you're driving on this road right here,
[1:35:27] you know, you always got to watch this
[1:35:28] way and always they're 10 years old,
[1:35:30] right?
[1:35:32] I don't care how much they said. Uh-huh.
[1:35:34] Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. They made
[1:35:36] you feel good. But the reality of it is
[1:35:38] is that
[1:35:40] maybe it's because you promised them the
[1:35:42] ice cream.
[1:35:44] They're just being nice and polite. So,
[1:35:45] you've done a good job with that part of
[1:35:46] it, but this it's not the season. But
[1:35:48] then when they start showing that
[1:35:50] interest, you know, it's now moved on
[1:35:52] from just the go-kart tracks and they're
[1:35:54] riding, you know, in the go-kart and oh
[1:35:56] my, you know, they're going out and
[1:35:58] they're sitting maybe in the car in the
[1:35:59] driveway and you're making sure none of
[1:36:00] the keys are around and or they're start
[1:36:02] asking, "Hey, can we move the car
[1:36:03] around? Can we can we do this?" Then you
[1:36:05] start know there's an interest. Sure.
[1:36:08] And when that interest begins to show,
[1:36:10] then that's the season to move in. Why?
[1:36:13] They're open to instruction, right? It's
[1:36:15] catching the season. Oh, hallelujah. God
[1:36:19] knew the season of the word that we
[1:36:22] right here in this hour, this time that
[1:36:24] we would be in. It's not a coincidence
[1:36:26] of the revealing of the word of the son
[1:36:28] of man in this hour. We are ordained for
[1:36:31] this hour. It's the season of rapture.
[1:36:35] It's the season of the fullness of the
[1:36:37] word coming back into our lives to
[1:36:40] deliver the church of the new birth.
[1:36:43] It's a season.
[1:36:47] Now, the discernment that's that's
[1:36:49] needed. Think about this. Discernment
[1:36:51] that's needed in our life. If there's
[1:36:52] anything that that is so needful in our
[1:36:55] lives is discernment. It's true. We need
[1:36:58] we Lord, I I want more. Amen. I want
[1:37:01] more. Discernment to be able. It's not
[1:37:04] about, let me just tell you something,
[1:37:05] friends. It's not about everybody else.
[1:37:08] I'm not asking God for more discernment
[1:37:10] about you. That's not what I'm asking
[1:37:13] God for. I'm asking God more discernment
[1:37:16] for my own life.
[1:37:18] Not just for you, for my life. God will
[1:37:21] give that according to the office that
[1:37:23] he's placed me in. But God, give me that
[1:37:25] discernment that I have need of.
[1:37:28] You know, a discernment of where it can
[1:37:30] always is pointing out everybody else is
[1:37:32] wrong and forailing failing to look at.
[1:37:34] What about your own? That's right. What
[1:37:37] about your own?
[1:37:40] This is why the scripture said 1
[1:37:41] Corinthians 11:31-32, for if we would
[1:37:44] judge ourselves, what a what a privilege
[1:37:46] God gives us to do this. We should not
[1:37:49] be judged. That don't mean running
[1:37:50] ourselves on the ground. But that means
[1:37:52] being honest with the word, examining
[1:37:55] ourselves by the word of God. But when
[1:37:58] we are judged, oh, here this is grace,
[1:38:00] too. We are chasened of the Lord that we
[1:38:03] should not be condemned with the world.
[1:38:06] Let me run through here a few quotes
[1:38:08] here.
[1:38:09] In the message shalom, brother says, "Oh
[1:38:11] God, 15 years of hard preaching and
[1:38:13] scolding, and God, thou knowest the
[1:38:16] reason. Love, love is chastening. Love
[1:38:21] is rebuke. Love is discipline. Now, let
[1:38:25] me just let me just hone in on this
[1:38:26] point because that can be very that can
[1:38:29] be used in a oh love is corrective. But
[1:38:31] you understand when this is being said,
[1:38:33] that's the motive. And if love is what
[1:38:37] what is love? Love is calling for a
[1:38:40] specific action. Amen. That's why
[1:38:43] brother Brandham all the way through the
[1:38:44] love messages different titles and so
[1:38:46] forth. When love is projected, comes to
[1:38:48] its end, sovereign grace steps in and
[1:38:51] delivers to love what it has called for.
[1:38:54] Right? This is the love of God working
[1:38:57] in our life for what? For for for a
[1:39:00] clear vision, a clear purpose. Love is a
[1:39:02] discipline. Oh God, may I throw myself
[1:39:06] with this people this week and may you
[1:39:09] discipline us Lord to your word. Now
[1:39:12] look here here the prophet is standing
[1:39:15] before us. I can read you countless
[1:39:17] number of quotes where brother Brandham
[1:39:19] talks about of even things that was
[1:39:21] shared with him of even how God
[1:39:24] corrected him in his life. His desire
[1:39:27] was to be corrected. You know why? That
[1:39:30] wasn't William Brandham's genetics,
[1:39:32] right? That was the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:37] Notice this. In the prisoner, we ask
[1:39:39] you, Lord, to give us your word. This is
[1:39:40] the opening prayer. Speak to us, Lord,
[1:39:42] and warm our hearts strainly that we
[1:39:45] would know how to discipline ourselves
[1:39:48] for the great time that lays ahead as we
[1:39:51] believe that we're nearing the coming of
[1:39:53] the Lord. It goes on, forgive us our
[1:39:56] sin. Chasen us Lord with thy spirit and
[1:39:59] thy word that we might discipline
[1:40:01] ourselves obedient servants obedient
[1:40:04] servants in the will of God. Amen. So
[1:40:08] what the goal of of receiving correction
[1:40:11] is where the discipline is shown in our
[1:40:15] lives. Our own lives become disciplined
[1:40:18] just like with what was given at the
[1:40:20] tabernacle. Just like within these
[1:40:22] things when it came to heart submitting
[1:40:24] to the guidance and instruction even of
[1:40:26] things that was given for Brandham
[1:40:28] tabernacle where brother Bram says we
[1:40:30] have found that these certain things and
[1:40:32] he got on to the testimony meetings he
[1:40:33] said it don't profit here in he said if
[1:40:35] it does in your church fine if it's in
[1:40:37] your church that's okay and he got into
[1:40:39] certain things and he's giving
[1:40:40] instruction and even when it come to the
[1:40:42] word of giving direction listen people
[1:40:46] were given an opportunity on whether or
[1:40:49] not they would discipline
[1:40:51] their own lives to it. You see, the the
[1:40:54] result of correction being received is
[1:40:56] it shows itself in our lives being
[1:40:59] disciplined to it, not resentment.
[1:41:03] Are you hearing me? Not I'll do what you
[1:41:05] want me to do, but I don't agree with
[1:41:06] it. I think it's I tell you this, I
[1:41:08] think
[1:41:10] that's not discipline.
[1:41:12] That's not discipline. But dis but real
[1:41:15] discipline is where our lives show it
[1:41:18] reflects the correction that we've
[1:41:21] received. Amen. And you know many times
[1:41:23] what it is we it God I'm so glad that
[1:41:25] God can see so far beyond of where you
[1:41:28] and I can see. And God knows exactly
[1:41:31] what's coming down the line. God know
[1:41:33] and you know God does things to test you
[1:41:35] and I to see where where it's at. See
[1:41:38] where our lives are at. See where
[1:41:39] certain things are at in our lives.
[1:41:42] Watch this.
[1:41:44] Brother Ram says this, I I love this
[1:41:45] quote of power transformation. Brother
[1:41:47] Ram says, "Now I want to read this
[1:41:48] morning some of the Bible." I like the
[1:41:50] word, don't you? He said, "We've
[1:41:52] worshiped the Lord and we'll continue to
[1:41:54] worship him. Now, let's worship him as a
[1:41:57] cutting, sharpedged sword as it moves
[1:42:00] through us to find out where we're
[1:42:03] standing." Oh my. So, worship doesn't
[1:42:06] stop when the song service stops, right?
[1:42:09] It's a continuation as the word is
[1:42:11] cutting right through us, helping us to
[1:42:14] see where we're standing.
[1:42:18] Let your light so shine before men. Oh,
[1:42:20] God, helping me. Maybe we could speak
[1:42:22] some words to something that'll be
[1:42:24] edifying to us, that'll help us all. How
[1:42:27] that we could do better and live a
[1:42:29] better life. I'm sure that's what we are
[1:42:31] all here for is to take correction and
[1:42:34] to get an understanding of what we can
[1:42:36] do to make us a better Christian. If I
[1:42:40] have one thing in my life that I desire
[1:42:43] is to be a better Christian than I am.
[1:42:45] And I'm sure that's the heart's cry of
[1:42:47] every soul that's here tonight is to be
[1:42:51] a better Christian.
[1:42:54] The Bible said, "A wise son heareth his
[1:42:58] father's
[1:43:00] instruction,
[1:43:02] but a scorner heareth not rebuke."
[1:43:07] So a wise son, one that is in tune with
[1:43:11] God,
[1:43:13] with his spirit, wise,
[1:43:16] hears his instruction. Because his
[1:43:19] instruction is it's things that God
[1:43:21] gives us. If we can receive it, it will
[1:43:24] increase the virtue in our life and it
[1:43:27] curbs out certain mistakes, curbs out
[1:43:30] certain things in our life. And God will
[1:43:33] work with such such grace to deal with
[1:43:37] our hearts to instruct us. You know why
[1:43:39] God wants our lives to be built on such
[1:43:42] a confidence in him? Not in anything
[1:43:46] else but the word. Not in any gift, not
[1:43:50] in any nothing but his word. That's
[1:43:54] where God wants us to be because when
[1:43:56] it's all said and done, that's where our
[1:43:58] trust has to be. Lord is I trust you.
[1:44:05] Let me let me close on this one.
[1:44:08] Brother Bram says, "When you ministers
[1:44:10] are correcting someone about a gift,
[1:44:12] when you're correcting them,
[1:44:13] scripturally correcting them, and they
[1:44:15] get offended, remember it wasn't the
[1:44:18] spirit of God because the spirit of God
[1:44:20] cannot be offended by his word. He comes
[1:44:23] to his word. He's always willing,
[1:44:26] willing. A real saint of God wants to
[1:44:29] tow the mark.
[1:44:33] I want to be corrected."
[1:44:36] This is the prophet's words.
[1:44:39] Let me just say it to you like this.
[1:44:41] What if you're corrected on something
[1:44:42] and you feel like that you've got the
[1:44:44] scripture word for word for word, I've
[1:44:47] got a refute. Does that refute allow a
[1:44:52] character to be displayed other than the
[1:44:54] character of Christ?
[1:44:58] Hello, I'm preaching. If it's not line
[1:45:01] by line, oh, if it's this and this, does
[1:45:04] that allow us then to act out not
[1:45:08] according to his character? It won't.
[1:45:11] The spirit of God will always show
[1:45:13] itself. Amen. In subjection,
[1:45:17] I want to be corrected. Look in Pilot's
[1:45:20] Hall example. Pilot's hall, he opened
[1:45:23] not his mouth, right? He could have he
[1:45:26] could have refuted everything, but you
[1:45:28] know what? He stood right there. right
[1:45:30] there in Pilot's Hall. He showed us
[1:45:33] what it was to be in subjection. Look
[1:45:36] how the prophet I I love this. To me,
[1:45:37] this is a real example here, the
[1:45:39] messenger of this age. I want to be
[1:45:41] corrected. I want the Holy Spirit to
[1:45:42] correct me in the things that I'm doing
[1:45:45] that's wrong. I don't want nothing
[1:45:47] substitutionary. I want the real thing
[1:45:48] or nothing. Just let me alone. Don't let
[1:45:50] me have nothing at all then. Cuz I'd
[1:45:53] rather do that than to bring a reproach
[1:45:56] on Christ. Yes, sir. And I wouldn't
[1:45:58] teach and say anything unless it is the
[1:46:00] scripture. He says, "If some brother,
[1:46:02] some Christian brother would see me
[1:46:03] teaching something wrong, I'd appreciate
[1:46:05] it if he'd call me over to one side
[1:46:07] after the service and say, "Brother
[1:46:08] Brandham, I'd like to come to your room
[1:46:11] and to talk to you. You're in error upon
[1:46:13] something." I'd sure appreciate that,
[1:46:15] brother, cuz I want to be right.
[1:46:20] How many say, "Yes, Lord. I want to be
[1:46:23] corrected." See, this is where we're
[1:46:25] standing in this age. We're looking at a
[1:46:29] church, a church world that refused. The
[1:46:32] brother Ram uses these words, the
[1:46:34] discipline book of the father. They
[1:46:37] carry this Bible but do not believe it.
[1:46:40] Will not receive it. Oh, this certain
[1:46:42] parts, certain fragments they want of
[1:46:44] his nature. They want certain things.
[1:46:47] You know, that's kind of like when a
[1:46:49] person can say, "I want all the word."
[1:46:51] But in order to have the word, you've
[1:46:53] got to also have his character. Because
[1:46:55] the word and the character are not
[1:46:56] inseparable. They're one and the same.
[1:46:59] Is that right? So it will not be when we
[1:47:01] have the letter and not the character,
[1:47:03] but it'll actually be the character
[1:47:05] that's expressing what the word actually
[1:47:08] is talking about.
[1:47:10] But you see in this time they they don't
[1:47:13] want it. I don't want that. They've
[1:47:14] walked away from it. I don't want it. I
[1:47:16] don't want it. Look, they they put it
[1:47:17] out. I don't want it. But God in his
[1:47:20] grace friends look even in us you heard
[1:47:25] in throughout many of us there were
[1:47:26] things that we can look at didn't even
[1:47:28] see ourselves here didn't even see this
[1:47:30] but God rich in mercy knew what was
[1:47:32] laying beneath all the darkness about
[1:47:33] our lives and God reached down by his
[1:47:37] grace and that part him working in our
[1:47:38] life to bring us to a place in our lives
[1:47:42] to where by the grace of God a life
[1:47:44] that's disciplined to the word of God.
[1:47:47] Do you realize it takes discipline to
[1:47:50] come to the house of God? Let's stand.
[1:47:52] It takes discipline to come to the house
[1:47:54] of God.
[1:47:56] God can speak to our hearts. Just I know
[1:47:58] that's a very simple thing. It can God
[1:47:59] can speak to our heart because the Bible
[1:48:01] said for us forsake not to assemble
[1:48:03] yourselves together. That's not
[1:48:04] something that God's going to do. You
[1:48:06] know, God just don't reach down to pick
[1:48:07] us up by the by the shirt and here I'm
[1:48:09] going to transport you here to the
[1:48:10] church. No. God allows things for us to
[1:48:14] willfully show our obedience. Yes.
[1:48:17] or disobedience.
[1:48:19] God allows that to be shown. What what's
[1:48:21] what's what's what matters? What's
[1:48:22] really important? And then when our
[1:48:24] lives can receive that correction, then
[1:48:27] our lives become disciplined to it. And
[1:48:29] discipline to it is that you know what?
[1:48:32] Even in the times, no doubt I could say
[1:48:34] throughout this service right here and
[1:48:35] other services, there's times they
[1:48:38] didn't feel like it. There's times I
[1:48:40] said, "Ah,
[1:48:42] you go on. I I you go on. You you go on.
[1:48:44] I I I just don't feel like it.
[1:48:47] But there's a discipline that's in your
[1:48:49] life that puts your flesh in subjection
[1:48:52] and said, "I don't care how tired I am.
[1:48:55] I don't care how this I am. I'm going to
[1:48:57] the house of God." Amen. That's a
[1:49:00] discipline in our lives.
[1:49:02] Cuz we know we've been corrected. And
[1:49:04] God God will correct us. We're his
[1:49:07] children. Every father will correct his
[1:49:09] children and God will correct us.
[1:49:11] Sometimes you know his correction is
[1:49:13] he'll pull back his presence from off
[1:49:14] our lives.
[1:49:18] That that's that's that that's a rough
[1:49:19] that's a rough situation. I I don't like
[1:49:22] that. Do you? But see, he knows what to
[1:49:24] do to get our attention. He knows what
[1:49:27] to do. And you know what it does? It
[1:49:28] brings correction in our lives.
[1:49:31] Oh my. I want to receive that benefit.
[1:49:33] Don't you?
[1:49:36] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:49:39] Lord Jesus,
[1:49:43] thanking God of your mercy, Lord, even
[1:49:46] upon the time, the day, the hour that
[1:49:48] we're living in, Lord, what grace that
[1:49:51] you come and you deal with in our lives,
[1:49:55] Lord, to work and to minister to us,
[1:49:58] Lord, to instruct us,
[1:50:01] to bring correction in our lives, Lord.
[1:50:05] Sometimes Lord the things is just like
[1:50:06] it is with our children in the natural.
[1:50:09] Sometimes there's things Lord that you
[1:50:10] will
[1:50:12] bring correction or instruction to our
[1:50:14] lives that it isn't necessarily
[1:50:16] something that is Lord altogether wrong
[1:50:20] is something that would be of the
[1:50:22] benefit in our lives and what you can
[1:50:25] see
[1:50:27] Lord
[1:50:28] so easy Lord it's many times it's so
[1:50:31] easy for us and you know sometimes Lord
[1:50:35] in the things that is so black and white
[1:50:37] why it's so easy. But Lord, it's in
[1:50:40] those times of sometimes gray areas in
[1:50:43] areas, Lord, and that's where we need
[1:50:46] your leadership. Amen. We need your
[1:50:49] direction to lead us and to guide us,
[1:50:51] Lord. Father, even here, Lord, in in our
[1:50:55] assembly, Lord. Father, in each of our
[1:50:57] homes, in each of our lives, Lord, I
[1:51:00] pray, oh God, may Lord, it be a place,
[1:51:05] Lord, that Father, always, not just this
[1:51:08] place, not just this assembly, but God,
[1:51:11] our hearts, may our hearts be a place
[1:51:14] that, Father, you're welcome to come and
[1:51:18] to speak to us,
[1:51:21] Lord God, to correct us.
[1:51:24] And Lord, I pray
[1:51:26] may our hearts be, Lord, a receiving
[1:51:28] ground to receive that word, Lord, that
[1:51:32] our lives could now reflect
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:37] that of the correction we receive, Lord,
[1:51:40] becoming disciplined lives, Lord, by the
[1:51:44] spirit of God. Lord, it always begins
[1:51:47] with us dying to ourselves, dying to
[1:51:49] what we think. Oh Lord, how many times
[1:51:53] your grace Lord God Lord I think of
[1:51:56] times Lord Jesus even from Lord when you
[1:51:59] first got a hold of my life Lord
[1:52:02] Lord Jesus I can remember sitting in
[1:52:05] services and meetings Lord my
[1:52:08] it wasn't something that was maybe said
[1:52:10] right out but I can remember Lord I knew
[1:52:13] exactly what you were saying to my life
[1:52:17] and it was things Lord God that you
[1:52:20] would give me the grace, Lord, to curb
[1:52:22] those things out of my life. Lord, it
[1:52:25] would see the value and it's you working
[1:52:27] with us because ultimately, Lord, your
[1:52:30] desire is to train us.
[1:52:33] I think about it, Lord, what a detriment
[1:52:35] it would be in this hour. We're in the
[1:52:37] hour, Lord, where the seal of God and
[1:52:39] the mark of the beast, it's actually
[1:52:41] been going on, Lord. We're living, Lord,
[1:52:44] in such a time, Lord, as this. But you
[1:52:47] did not leave us in this hour without
[1:52:50] the certainty that was needed
[1:52:54] to live
[1:52:57] a life that is worthy of the gospel.
[1:53:00] Lord God, as you sent your word, you
[1:53:03] came down.
[1:53:05] Lord God would reveal yourself in this
[1:53:08] hour. You would manifest yourself. Lord,
[1:53:11] we've not received like the prophet
[1:53:13] said, that little eagle that was down
[1:53:14] there in that chicken yard. He had heard
[1:53:17] eagles preached all his life. The
[1:53:19] prophet said, but one day he saw a
[1:53:24] living image
[1:53:26] flying above him. Lord God, that's what
[1:53:30] this message come to do. Lord, it never
[1:53:33] came, Lord God, to highlight William
[1:53:36] Brandom. It never came to lift up
[1:53:37] William Brandham. We thank you Lord for
[1:53:40] your prophet Lord our messenger. But
[1:53:42] father we recognize Lord who it is that
[1:53:44] has been revealed to us Lord. It's you
[1:53:48] our heavenly father that Lord God you
[1:53:51] knew exactly where we were at. You knew
[1:53:52] the bed of time that we were planted in
[1:53:54] Lord. You knew the mess that we were in
[1:53:57] Lord God. And Father you came by our
[1:54:00] way.
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:03] And Lord Jesus,
[1:54:05] you have worked and you continue to work
[1:54:08] in our lives. That little eagle, Lord, I
[1:54:11] think how the prophet would just Lord
[1:54:13] describe it. It jumped upon a fence
[1:54:15] post. It had to be encouraged. It was
[1:54:18] encouraged by that living image
[1:54:19] reminding it that's who you are.
[1:54:23] Oh God, as your prophet said, that
[1:54:26] little eagle had always been taught all
[1:54:28] his life to look down.
[1:54:31] But this message was different. He was
[1:54:34] taught to look up.
[1:54:36] Lord God will never get anywhere with
[1:54:38] looking down. But it's always looking up
[1:54:41] to you, Lord.
[1:54:43] Looking unto Jesus, the author and the
[1:54:45] finisher of our faith.
[1:54:48] Lord, that little eagle, as the prophet
[1:54:49] said, he jumped upon that fence post.
[1:54:52] That was a start. Everything moving.
[1:54:56] And then eventually, Lord,
[1:54:59] he took off and began to fly. Oh, I'd
[1:55:02] say his flying was kind of wobbly at
[1:55:04] first. And but the potential was in him.
[1:55:08] He just had to get used to using those
[1:55:10] wings for what they were meant for.
[1:55:12] Glory be to God. Lord, that's where your
[1:55:16] prophet said that every man and woman of
[1:55:18] God when he would refer to Moses is born
[1:55:21] with this equipment in them to believe
[1:55:24] God. All it takes is getting in the
[1:55:27] presence of the supernatural. And it
[1:55:30] unfolds that equipment that God's
[1:55:32] already placed in us. Hallelujah. Lord
[1:55:34] Jesus, that's how you're working with us
[1:55:37] and training us,
[1:55:39] guiding us, Lord.
[1:55:42] Father,
[1:55:43] I'm so thankful, Lord, for your
[1:55:45] tutorship in our lives.
[1:55:48] Lord Jesus,
[1:55:50] how we're longing, Lord, for that day of
[1:55:52] full adoption when we receive the
[1:55:54] adoption of these bodies, Lord. But in
[1:55:58] the meantime, Lord, as we're growing, we
[1:56:01] are laboring and working with the spirit
[1:56:04] of adoption in our life that will lead
[1:56:06] us to full adoption.
[1:56:10] Oh God, we're not going to become sons.
[1:56:12] We are sons. We are and Lord God, help
[1:56:16] us
[1:56:18] like you admonish them in the scripture
[1:56:21] not to despise
[1:56:23] chastening.
[1:56:26] Neither faint
[1:56:29] when we're rebuked of you, Lord,
[1:56:32] but rather, Lord, to endure it.
[1:56:35] Not endure it as though like a child
[1:56:37] would say, "Well, I'll wait till dad
[1:56:39] gets done talking. He's going to be
[1:56:41] probably 30 minutes and when he's done
[1:56:43] we'll be able No, that's not what you
[1:56:45] meant,
[1:56:46] but to endure it,
[1:56:49] be patient under it, to take it into our
[1:56:52] lives.
[1:56:54] And I love, Lord God, the promise as you
[1:56:57] have conveyed to our hearts, God dealeth
[1:57:00] with us as sons. Lord, we're your
[1:57:04] children.
[1:57:06] You're working on our lives. You're
[1:57:08] working, Lord, that everything would be
[1:57:10] curved out
[1:57:13] that's unlike you. Help us, Lord. Help
[1:57:16] us, Lord, as we realize even some of the
[1:57:19] things in our lives.
[1:57:21] Father, no doubt things that maybe,
[1:57:22] Lord, that we've prayed about and prayed
[1:57:24] about and asked you to change certain
[1:57:26] things in our life. And Lord, I'm not
[1:57:28] saying there aren't things that won't be
[1:57:30] changed, but Lord, I look at many
[1:57:31] different things in our life. You call
[1:57:34] us to rule over it.
[1:57:36] Like your prophet tells us, Lord, in
[1:57:38] faith is the victory. The things that
[1:57:41] once ruled us, we now rule it. The
[1:57:44] position has changed from the tail to
[1:57:46] the head.
[1:57:48] It's ruling over it, Lord. Oh, Father,
[1:57:52] I'm not talking so much about drinking,
[1:57:54] smoking, or this or immorality or
[1:57:56] fashions or other things like that.
[1:57:58] There's ways that the spirit of God will
[1:58:00] move right through our lives on many
[1:58:02] dealing with those areas and separating
[1:58:04] us. But Lord God, even when it comes
[1:58:07] down to our very temperament,
[1:58:10] makeup and character,
[1:58:14] help us, Lord,
[1:58:16] help us to always be that lamb,
[1:58:19] a lamb
[1:58:21] that's led to the slaughter.
[1:58:25] Lead us, Lord. As Paul would say, I die
[1:58:29] daily.
[1:58:31] He would also go on to tell us that we
[1:58:34] are always delivered up unto death that
[1:58:36] the life of Jesus might be made manifest
[1:58:38] in our mortal bodies.
[1:58:41] Lord God, help us, Father.
[1:58:45] Paul would describe the crucifixion,
[1:58:48] describing that of being crucified.
[1:58:52] They that are Christ have crucified
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:56] that of the lust of the flesh, that of
[1:58:57] the affections thereof. Lord, it speaks.
[1:59:01] It is an ongoing crucifixion,
[1:59:04] daily dying to ourselves.
[1:59:09] Lord, help us.
[1:59:11] Help us, Lord. I pray. Give grace to
[1:59:14] each and every one. Lord, help us, Lord.
[1:59:17] Even when it comes to things, Lord, on
[1:59:19] the job, things that Lord, maybe a boss
[1:59:21] or somebody would come along the way.
[1:59:23] Maybe sometimes there's a new person
[1:59:25] that comes Lord into the department or
[1:59:27] whatever more and they're there Lord to
[1:59:30] try to maybe help to show. Maybe they've
[1:59:33] Lord sought an engineer out. I know
[1:59:36] different different brothers Lord that
[1:59:38] I've met and they'll be called in to
[1:59:39] actually study a whole operation in a
[1:59:41] plant sometimes and looking at things
[1:59:43] how things could be made maybe more
[1:59:45] efficient. Not as so much to be more of
[1:59:47] a workload,
[1:59:49] but Lord, to be something that would be
[1:59:51] of a of a benefit.
[1:59:54] Lord Jesus,
[1:59:56] help us, Lord.
[1:59:59] Help us, Lord. We want our hearts to be
[2:00:02] tender, Lord, to you, Father.
[2:00:07] Grant it, Lord, in the name of the Lord
[2:00:10] Jesus Christ.
[2:00:12] Amen. Brother Brian, lead us, would you?
[2:00:14] Beautiful.
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:24] Wonderful.
[2:00:27] I know for sure.
[2:00:31] All of my days are held in your hands,
[2:00:37] crafted into
[2:00:40] your perfect.
[2:00:45] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:48] You gently call me
[2:00:51] into your presence,
[2:00:55] guiding me by
[2:00:58] your Holy Spirit.
[2:01:01] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:01:04] to live all of my life
[2:01:08] through
[2:01:10] your
[2:01:11] eyes.
[2:01:15] I'm captured by
[2:01:18] your holy calling.
[2:01:21] Send me aart.
[2:01:24] I know you're drawing
[2:01:27] me to yourself.
[2:01:31] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[2:01:41] Take me. Yes Lord mold me. Yes Lord use
[2:01:49] me.
[2:01:51] Fill me.
[2:01:54] I give myself
[2:01:57] to the potter's
[2:02:00] hand.
[2:02:05] Amen.
[2:02:06] Oh, call me Lord and guide me.
[2:02:13] Lead me, walk beside me. Oh, I give my
[2:02:21] life
[2:02:23] to the potter's
[2:02:26] hand.
[2:02:30] Beautiful roots.
[2:02:33] Beautiful Lord,
[2:02:36] wonderful Savior,
[2:02:39] I know for sure.
[2:02:43] All of my days are held in your hand,
[2:02:49] crafted into
[2:02:52] your perfect
[2:02:55] plan.
[2:02:59] You gently call me
[2:03:02] into your presence,
[2:03:05] guiding me by
[2:03:08] your Holy Spirit.
[2:03:12] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:03:14] to live all of my life
[2:03:18] through
[2:03:19] your
[2:03:21] eyes.
[2:03:24] And I'm captured by
[2:03:27] your holy calling.
[2:03:30] Set me aart.
[2:03:33] I know you're drawing
[2:03:36] me to yourself.
[2:03:40] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:49] Take me.
[2:03:53] Hold me.
[2:03:56] Use me.
[2:03:59] Fill me.
[2:04:01] I give my life to the potter's
[2:04:08] hand.
[2:04:14] Call me,
[2:04:17] guide me,
[2:04:20] lead me, walk beside me.
[2:04:26] I give my life to the potter's hand.
[2:04:35] Take me.
[2:04:38] Yes. Take me,
[2:04:42] mold me,
[2:04:45] use me,
[2:04:48] fill me.
[2:04:51] I give my life to the potter's
[2:04:57] hand.
[2:04:58] [Applause]
[2:05:00] Yes, Lord Jesus. Call me Lord. Call me.
[2:05:06] Yes, Lord. Guide me,
[2:05:10] lead me, walk beside
[2:05:14] me. Oh, I give my life
[2:05:19] to the potter's hand.
[2:05:27] Hallelujah.
[2:05:32] Hallelujah. Go ahead. Empty.
[2:05:37] and broken.
[2:05:40] I came back
[2:05:43] to him
[2:05:46] of that soul
[2:05:49] unworthy
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:52] so scarred
[2:05:55] by sin. Oh, but he did not
[2:06:01] despair.
[2:06:03] He started over
[2:06:07] again
[2:06:10] and I bless
[2:06:12] the day he never threw. Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:20] Oh,
[2:06:21] and over
[2:06:24] and over. He molds me
[2:06:30] and he makes me
[2:06:33] into
[2:06:36] his likeness.
[2:06:39] He fashions
[2:06:41] the clay.
[2:06:43] Oh, a vessel
[2:06:47] of honor. Yes, I am
[2:06:53] today.
[2:06:55] And it's all because
[2:06:59] Jesus
[2:07:01] didn't throw
[2:07:04] the
[2:07:05] Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] And he is
[2:07:13] the potter
[2:07:16] and I am Yes Lord.
[2:07:20] Yes Lord Jesus. Holy
[2:07:25] in his image.
[2:07:28] He wants me. He wants me to stay. So
[2:07:32] when I stumble
[2:07:36] and fall
[2:07:38] on my vessel
[2:07:42] grace,
[2:07:44] he just picks up
[2:07:47] all the pieces. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:52] I will throw the clay away
[2:07:56] over
[2:07:59] and over. He's molding me
[2:08:04] and makes me
[2:08:08] into
[2:08:10] his likeness.
[2:08:13] He fashions
[2:08:15] the clay.
[2:08:17] Oh, a vessel
[2:08:21] of honor.
[2:08:24] Oh, I am
[2:08:27] today.
[2:08:29] And it's all
[2:08:32] because Jesus
[2:08:36] throw
[2:08:37] the clay away
[2:08:42] over
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:44] and over. I'm glad he's molding me
[2:08:49] and makes me
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:53] into
[2:08:55] his likeness
[2:08:58] he fashion. Thank you Lord.
[2:09:02] Oh
[2:09:04] vessel
[2:09:06] of honor.
[2:09:09] I am
[2:09:12] today.
[2:09:14] And it's all because Jesus
[2:09:19] did it through
[2:09:22] the A vessel of honor. A vessel
[2:09:28] of honor
[2:09:31] I am
[2:09:34] today.
[2:09:36] And it's all
[2:09:40] Jesus.
[2:09:43] Throw the clay
[2:09:46] away.
[2:09:49] Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen.
[2:09:52] Aren't you glad he's working on you?
[2:09:53] Amen. Amen. I'm so glad he's working on
[2:09:56] us. I never forget. I know this isn't
[2:09:58] maybe something real spiritual, but it's
[2:10:00] always, you know, God takes experiences
[2:10:02] through your life. And I remember the
[2:10:03] football coach that I had and he he told
[2:10:05] us he said boys he said we're getting
[2:10:07] ready to start into the season and he
[2:10:09] said I'm going to tell you he said
[2:10:11] there's going to be times we're going to
[2:10:12] get on you and he said but I want you to
[2:10:14] understand it's not because we're
[2:10:16] against you it's because we we see
[2:10:20] there's potential in you more than what
[2:10:23] you're given. Hallelujah.
[2:10:26] And you know the scripture is very true
[2:10:28] that no no chastening in the present is
[2:10:31] joyous.
[2:10:33] It's grievious. But grievous to whom?
[2:10:35] See that's what's important. Grievious
[2:10:37] to what? Our flesh. But if that spirit
[2:10:41] on the inside is a is of God. Yes Lord.
[2:10:44] This I mean it's grievious but Lord
[2:10:46] Jesus guide me Lord help me. The real
[2:10:50] reality, friends, for us as a children
[2:10:51] of God, when it would become grievious,
[2:10:54] I think the greatest thing, the things
[2:10:56] for me that were, and I think for every
[2:10:58] child of God that we've had to go
[2:10:59] through is the things to where when I
[2:11:01] know that I've let him down
[2:11:05] to where to know that Lord, I failed you
[2:11:07] in this area. Lord, I've overlooked
[2:11:08] this. Lord, I've missed that. I'll tell
[2:11:10] you, that's not something you just shrug
[2:11:12] off. Sometimes it's something that it
[2:11:14] carries with you and you finally have to
[2:11:16] be able to come to a place to forgive
[2:11:18] yourself. Yeah. And the only way you can
[2:11:20] really forgive yourself is to accept his
[2:11:22] forgiveness.
[2:11:23] But you know what? What if that wasn't
[2:11:25] there? What if it was just something we
[2:11:27] were so dismissive? We wouldn't be the
[2:11:29] people that we are today. But God knows
[2:11:33] just just how to let the things linger.
[2:11:35] I'm so glad. Aren't you friends? Listen.
[2:11:38] It'll be worth it all when we stand
[2:11:40] there on that day. It'll be worth it
[2:11:41] all. It'll be worth it all. It'll be
[2:11:44] worth it all. Hallelujah. It'll be worth
[2:11:48] it all. Amen. God bless you. Shake hands
[2:11:51] with one another as you're being
[2:11:52] dismissed. Can we sing that song? He's
[2:11:53] still working on me.
[2:11:55] Hallelujah.
[2:11:58] Working on me
[2:12:01] to make me what I ought to be.
[2:12:08] Make to make. Let's pray together.
[2:12:10] Heavenly Father, you see the need. Lord,
[2:12:13] we've already agreed to Mars. How loving
[2:12:17] and patient he must be.
[2:12:20] For he's still working on me.
[2:12:25] Yes, he's still working on me
[2:12:30] to make me what I ought to be.
[2:12:35] It took him just a week to make the moon
[2:12:38] and the stars, sun and the earth,
[2:12:43] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[2:12:47] he must be.
[2:12:49] For he's still working on me.
[2:12:54] There really ought to be a sign upon my
[2:12:58] heart. Don't judge me if there's an
[2:13:02] unfinished part. I'll be perfect just
[2:13:06] according to his plan. Fashioned by my
[2:13:10] master's loving hand. Yes, he's still
[2:13:15] working on me
[2:13:18] to make me what I ought to be.
[2:13:23] It took him just a week to make the moon
[2:13:26] and the stars, sun and the earth,
[2:13:30] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[2:13:34] he must be.
[2:13:37] For he's still working on me
[2:13:42] in the mirror of his word. Reflections
[2:13:46] that I see makes me wonder why he never
[2:13:50] gave up on me. But he loves me as I am
[2:13:54] and he helps me when I pray. Remember,
[2:13:57] he's the potter, I'm the clay.
[2:14:01] For he's still working on me,
[2:14:06] to make me what I ought to be.
[2:14:11] Took him just a week to make the moon
[2:14:14] and the stars, sun and the earth,
[2:14:18] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[2:14:23] he must be.
[2:14:25] For he's still working on me.
[2:14:30] Yes, he's still working on me.
[2:14:35] To make me what I to be.
[2:14:40] Took him just a week to make the moon
[2:14:43] and the stars, sun and the earth,
[2:14:47] Jupiter
[2:14:51] patient. He must be
[2:14:54] cut out.
[2:14:59] Amen.
[2:15:01] And see higher ground.
[2:15:03] My heart has no
