this is where we draw our comfort and our strength from the word of the Lord amen we just want to just so thankful for the mercy of God this morning so glad to be able to be here and I was glad I want to say I appreciate it brother Jerry ministering for us on Thursday night amen is such a wonderful word that the Lord delivered to our hearts and we just so appreciate him and sister Mina and being here with us and knowing that the circumstances and we want to continue just pray for them as they go back home tonight and we want to remember continue remember brother bill and the family in prayer and also for all the Sanchez family the losses has just been through you know and I think every I think as a church there's a lot that with that right there we had been through I just met with them just met with someone Friday and I said you know I kind of looked forward to this little time on Friday to meet I said with you all I said because this is the first meeting I've had this not dealt with death and dying it's been a solid month it's been a solid month and I just thank God for His grace that house that he has he has strengthened us and he'll continue to strengthen us each and every each and every one and that's where as a body we feel for one another we pray for one another and you know the reality of it is is that whether or not somebody goes to church here or not I don't know how many times even when I was still teaching school different ones would lose somebody my heart still goes out to them and I still pray for them and still pray for my because prayers itself I don't find that scripturally that prayers just stay if if I think they're a member of the bride of Jesus Christ or if they are go to this assembly with that they see that's what the real Spirit of God of this message come to do it come to deliver us from that organizational thinking amen to where even Paul as I mentioned to you the other night Paul would take and write in Timothy and say let us remember to pray for the Kings rulers and different ones who are in charge that we may live peaceably that scripture still applies because we're not praying to turn America around we're not praying for that so that scripture still has to be in effect Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we pray as long as we have to be here we pray that God would give them wisdom and you know some of the things right now we we don't know you know we see a lot of it around us where people is fear people are living in fear and I and I really believe it's it's it's something it's a condition it's almost like a litmus test where you see just a little something right now and it just sends the people off and everybody starts scrambling and you know if we understand the things that just common sense wise if you just go to the store buy what you need for the week like you normally do about what you need for two weeks then you go to the store and you know I think God for His grace and you know it's not like the word ignorant of things but at the same time we're not to be occupied to where that it becomes everything about our conversation you know I love your brother Josh way but if every time I talked with you and you talked about coronavirus I think you wouldn't be seeing me too much just gonna be honest with you I mean it's the truth I mean I don't want to add to me that's not fellowship I don't want to talk you know we there's times I'd keep up with it read it try to do what little things I can do here and there but it's not gonna I don't want that to occupy my life and it's wonderful I think how the Lord has spoke to us we find it over and over in his word we have peace and thank God for the peace that we have amen and you know the thing of it is and you know brother Scott you'd know this and being a doctor and things they've made it very clear abran P individuals have come out and said more people die from the flu 16,000 deaths in a year and they said you're more likely to die from it they said if they would actually follow all of their announcements with make sure you get the flu shot but you know what there's a bigger epidemic than Korona more than the flu it's called sin and I'm glad there's an inoculation Mystere as affected this morning I'm glad about that aren't you hey man I'm so glad about that and in that inoculation we've got the promise then no plague shall come now that dwelling amen if it comes thank god we've got it we have a promise in the word of the Lord we want to I just want to announce to you we had put out that you know where we were going to have the fellowship and I'm just I'm making a decision and it's it's not because of coronavirus this was before all that I just made a decision I think as a church where the sisters everything of how they've labored and cooked and the resources we're just gonna cancel March and April's fellowship dinners and just save our energies and things for the time in May and so it had nothing to do with coronavirus because I still believe in praying over the food and sanctify everything sanctified through prayer let me tell you something probably some of the safest food you eat is that a carry and you don't know what some of that stuff is that the restaurants you go to hope brother Nathan preaches on faith now right but it's true so we we just you know we I want to just do that because and I want to say for the congregation I know that there had been the different ones that are even not here and money that was was given to towards the whatever's needed you know take care of it whatever is needed for food and different ones and your labor and and and cooking and the resources and just coming together as a body for both it was back to back I think within two weeks of one another and and I can tell you I was even at the one with them for for Liliana and I tell you it was it was a it was beautiful the spread that was there the food and how things were just done up and we want to say I thank you to sister Amanda and brother Aaron I appreciate all their labors a [Applause] sister Maya sister Amanda was right on it right away with sister when when Liliana had passed she was right on that and then also with sister Mary and so we just appreciate that them arraigned getting everything together the halls and things like that and just really appreciate that and as a body and so we March and April we won't have that and I've already instructed I instruct the song leaders every fall just don't have the people shake hands and it's simple it's just simple things you know over the flu and things like that you know and and and I told you on Thursday night and I don't mean this for a joke but if you haven't if you haven't been a regular hand washer start doing that godliness is next to cleanliness and I mean that I mean I don't mean that for a joke I can take you back into into chapters that are designated in the Book of Leviticus where God would not even allow the IFS of a vessel came in contact with something else it's unclean destroy it see God's not even though he said I'm the Lord that he loved thee but God didn't walk around and want us to be ignorant you say well that was all a type in a shadow but it still pertains it still pertains and we want to do what all that we can do that God has put into our our hands and even as we gather here I want to say thank you to brother Nathan and sister Cheyenne for being here sister Cheyenne thank you for letting him come all those times this is really this is to me this was a real it's a real treat as well to be able to be here I wasn't supposed to be here this weekend but I I cancelled out where I was supposed to go I just told the end I told the brother I said I'm just I'm weary I'm tired and I said we've had a lot here I just want to stay and so I really appreciate them being here and coming and I'm just looking forward to the word of the Lord God knows what we have need of this morning amen so brother Nathan we certainly appreciate you and sister Cheyenne and you your labor of love and without any further ado if we could let's just stand to our feet and we want to just sing a song let's sing that song there is none like you Lord there is none [Music] thank you [Music] amen sing that one more time there is none [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you I could search for all [Music] and [Music] amen isn't that the truth this morning a man blessed to be the name of Lord God bless you it's so good to be with you again I always get so excited to come and be with the Saints here this this assembly really has a special place in my heart I just appreciate the warm welcome that we've always found here and we just appreciate and love you all in the Lord and how hard especially with the Sanchez family and this season of loss and we've been thinking and and praying for you so god bless you all let's go right to the word in mark chapter 4 and just want to thank for the Samuel for the invitation this morning the opportunity appreciate our brother Samuel we're gonna read a familiar story in the Bible here and mark the fourth chapter and I thought it was wonderful how the Lord even even even in the songs this morning inspired brother Brian with with the songs to just tie right into the inspiration it's on my heart this morning but I wanted it I want to spend a little time and I trust it won't keep you long this morning on this thought I've had on my heart on the Prince of Peace Prince of Peace amen amen and in this time in this season that we're living in this age there's one thing we have need of it's peace amen when when the world is falling apart people are tossed about and there's such a great pressure in this world amen but we have a source of peace this morning it's a mark 4 verse 35 and we find here that Jesus has been at the height of his ministry he's drawing the multitudes doing great miracles and and preaching great doctrines and mysteries and and and and here he's he's he's met with the multitudes and he's given parable after parable after parable but now he's come alone with his disciples and he's sharing things personally with them that's not for the public but just for his elect amen and now they're there they're taking a journey here Jesus and His disciples in verse 35 the same day when the evening was to come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto Him master carest thou not that we perish amen anybody ever felt that way and he arose and rebuked the wind and saith unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great call and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to the other what man or a man is this that even the wind and the sea obey amen let's just pray give him glory this morning let's all pray together Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for this time that you've set aside Lord - Lord to make this place available for us to gather together as Christians Lord in bonds of love father we're seeking refuge today from the storms of this life Lord Lord we know it's not in the world it's not in the systems Lord or the politics of this world the Lord pieces in you father pieces in our Lord Jesus Christ Lord and here you are present amongst us father you're not a far off Lord you've not forsaken us you've not left us alone but you're here in our midst Lord to bring us peace and I pray father that Lord hearts that are in turmoil and Lord those that have been suffering would be able to Lord have a moment Lord have a have an oasis a relief this morning Lord a moment in your presence Lord takes care of it all I just ask that you would be merciful to speak to us reveal your word to us Lord maybe in a greater way this morning father then we a greater understanding Lord along life's journey in Jesus Christ's name we dedicate ourselves to you amen amen god bless yous you're seated let's turn also to take our text here on the Prince of Peace to Isaiah chapter 9 another very familiar scripture speaking of the coming of the Lord Isaiah 9 and verse 6 amen and we find the prophecy here of our Lord in Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father and the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen I think the Lord I just been studying on this Scripture you know and and and meditating on this this Prince of Peace and and one of my favorite one of my favorite types of studies in the scripture is to study on the names of God the names or the titles by which he calls himself and and maybe a year or two ago I had won on the Lord of Hosts that was so edifying to me but but you know these names of God there they're put in the scripture to reveal to us something about his character right he doesn't he gives himself these titles and all these things are all together in our Lord Jesus Christ but but he has these titles and he has these names by which he's called names like wonderful and counselor mighty God but but but he's called the Prince of Peace and it's revealing to us something about who he is and and his relationship to us as our Prince and our Prince that brings peace amen and so so so it's revealing an aspect of his character that he is the Prince of Peace now this scripture of the talking about a coming son to a child that's going to be born we know that speaking of the coming of the Lord unto us a child is born and that's a scripture that's been fulfilled we've had that he's calm he's been born into this world in a manger and and so if that part is fulfilled but then we find that there's more to this prophecy speaking of a son of David reign when he's going to take the throne of David and he's going to bring peace to the whole world amen and so there's the son of David ministry here in this same scripture amen but it's revealing these different aspects so it's an Advent promise which is a promise that's speaking of his coming so when he comes he's coming as the Prince of Peace a meant his presence his arrival his appearing amen is bringing peace so so so when we are looking for is coming when we're looking for his appearing looking for his presence amongst us then what we should find in our midst is peace amen a spirit of peace an atmosphere of peace and and so it's an Advent promise we find that same Advent promise echoed in Philippians chapter 4 and I'll just read it this morning that the Lord is at hand an Advent amen the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding Oh glory amen I just feel excited this morning the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen hallelujah the Lord has see it's an Advent the Lord is at hand and he's coming with peace peace on earth and goodwill toward men amen not fear not worry not dread but peace and and joy amen but now but see the peace that he's coming he's coming and he's uttering in a great peace but it's a peace that passeth understanding amen and that's the wonderful thing about a Christian life is that we have access to a peace which is not really it's not in relation to our cares for he said for he said be careful for nothing don't worry about anything don't look at the circumstances the things that you're going through amen knowing that we go through trials and knowing we go through disappointments and heartaches and yet the peace that we have through the Prince of Peace is not it has nothing to do with our feelings or emotions or what we're going through but it's a knowledge that he is on the throne of our heart amen and all things are under his control amen it's a sovereign peace amen it's a rulership peace hallelujah oh it's a good news to the bride amen good news Advent a Shalom a good morning amen peace be with you the Sun's up amen we can see where we're going we can see clearly where we are and what we're and and then all these things all the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared amen to the light that has been shed revealing the glory that is to be revealed in this pride amen it's a Shalom it's a peace that passes all understanding all all intellectual all reason all worry all doubt all emotion amen peace our peace is greater than all those things for it's not a peace that is a is in relation to our cares and our needs and whether our needs whether we feel like our needs are met or whether whether we feel like like like the world is secure our situation is secure it's not it has nothing to do with that this piece that we're preaching about we can have peace in spite of the circumstances in spite of the trials we can have peace in spite of all the conditions around us Christ is coming with peace his coming is with peace amen and and also it's a bit but you see this peace it's it passes all understanding do you see it his coming is not according to our print are our expectations when he comes when the God's doing a work it's never it's never according to our expectations brother Graham said in the world is falling apart they always turn God down because he doesn't come according to their taste to their taste didn't that's in that powerful that see when he comes it's not necessarily according to our taste the way that we think it ought to be the way the way that we think everything ought to end up though you know the outcome that we want amen is it's not always the way that the Lord does it is he said it's the same thing today it doesn't come in our theological taste but it comes in the way of the power of the demonstration of the manifestation of God's promise for the Aged amen beautiful quote amen but they refuse it they refused it then and they refused it today I'm just building to something here amen so bear with me they refuse it then they refuse it today because it doesn't meet the expectation of the according to the way that people expect it now now we understand that the message we understand that relation to the message that we're believing how God sent a prophet in the world rejected it but take that to our day to the bride of Jesus Christ amen believing that Christ is present in this bride and he's manifesting himself and revealing himself through this body these believers amen these sons and daughters of God showing a light to the world amen but what the world the world has missed it friends the world has rejected it they don't they have they don't accept it it's not according to their theology according to their tastes and that's the way that God works is never Amen never subject to our tastes and amen when that when this child that we read about when unto us a child is born when that child came it was a disappointment to a lot of people a man had brought a great disappointment to the way that God moved the way the God fulfilled his word was so a foreign to their taste because they were expecting a shining King to come and and we're in the temple veil and step out and announce himself to the high priests and put on shining armor and overthrow the Roman rule and all those sayings that and so there were a lot of disappointed people think about that now a lot of people disappointed yet it was a true fulfillment of the scripture the Pharisees were disappointed because he didn't endorse their religion amen he didn't care about their works and who their daddy was and where they came from what their position and and and their status and their dignity he had nothing he had no time for any of that amen and so it was a disappointment to them when Jesus came Judas was disappointed because Judas was a zealot and he was looking for something to happen in a political realm come on now he was he was expecting something to happen and God he thought God was going to work through politics and bring a great peace and it didn't happen France amen so what Judas he got disappointed because it wasn't according to his taste a rich young ruler was disappointed because he wasn't a dis respecter of persons Amen he didn't care about status didn't care about wealth he it wasn't he wasn't bringing those kinds of blessings and so and neither is the world satisfied with the advent of the bride amen because it's too humble it's too human amen for their taste and it might be even be to Pentecostal you see it when the breath see it's the same thing Christ and his bride amen it doesn't look like what we think it should look like it looks too weak it looks too human amen it looks too too too subject to the circumstances and the trials and the tribulations and even you and I it's not according to our taste some time because we're looking at our humility and our own humanity not recognizing God hides himself in such as that and is actually looking for a people that are so humble that the world will miss it and that's where he wants to hide his glory glory to God amen if you're home if you're weak this morning if you've got trials you've got struggles you're in the battle you're just where God wants you because that's where he reveals himself amen his strength is made perfect in weakness glory to God they're not the they'll never see the advent of the bride amen and that's why even people around this message have missed they have missed the awakening of the bride looking for a revival looking for something to come something off in the future some third pole that's going to come or some return of a prophet or something in the future but friends don't miss the awakening this morning hallelujah it's a shalom sunrise the rising of the Sun amen here and he's in his bride amen and we are in revival amen despite many times what our emotions are feeling and the things that we're going through and the burdens that we're carrying in this world yet we are what the word says we are hallelujah glory not even according to our taste looking at our trials and looking at the things that we endure but oh my it's not about you or I or the substance of these bodies or these human lives I I love this quote in Shalom brother Branham said talking about talking about creation he said Jesus could take he could take something that was created and he could multiply it Amen he took water he took some a creation of water and he turned it into wine amen he took her he took a little fish and he multiplied it he took a little he took a little bit of bread and and he multiplied it but look what he's done in this day I love how Bill Graham brings it out he said but in the last days when there's no sign of creation amen when there's no sign of creation he speaks it into creation anyhow what's he talking about he said he it shows he's the same God that was in the beginning he can create squirrels hey man he can create whatever he wants to because he's God hallelujah amen he's God so he can do what he wants to with creation if he can take nothing and turn it into a squirrel amen then you might be nothing and I might be nothing then he can take this creation and he can multiply it and multiply it Man Alive surrender to Jesus Christ amen the power of God will take that creation amen and make it multiplied of what it could ever be hallelujah he can bring out all the potential not your potential but all of his potential as a son or daughter of God it's all the potential the father is in this bride amen amen we got young people sitting here amen you don't know what you could be you don't you had you have no idea what God could do in your life amen surrender to God and watch him multiply and make things out of you you never thought were possible glory to God hallelujah because why because Brill Graham said he's God and he can do what he wants - amen he can create whatever he wants - because He is God so it's a sovereignty it's a sovereign creation he didn't solicit your opinion he didn't ask your idea he didn't ask what you thought about it he didn't hidden he didn't ever consulted you a what your opinion on what you thought you could be amen but he chose you amen he didn't consult you but he chose you and he predestinated you and the zeal of God shall perform in your life every word that a prophet spoke of a bride hallelujah all you got to do is believe it it's sovereign hey man Amen we're looking at these vessels that were living in and what are we but nothing but the the clay of this earth amen I was listening that message go awake Jesus and brother Brandon was dealing he was preaching that down in down in Louisiana he said what are you people he said you're nothing but Louisiana clay nothing but Louisiana clay or Texas clay all right or Ohio clay amen Amen nothing but the dirt of this way but what he said is but there's been a god of creation has taken this clay and built mud ships hallelujah friends amen you might be nothing but the dust of this earth but let God shape you let him have control of your life he'll make a mud ship out of you and you'll realize one day you're not the one at the helm Amen but he's the one steering the ship lorry to God and what are we we're actually vessels carrying about the body of Jesus Christ the Spirit of God the Prince of Peace amen everywhere that we go and just like these disciples not even cognizant of it many times a mud ship I just love that a mud ship amen amen or just a vessel just a vehicle for the Holy Ghost to take control and then he can steer it any way that he wants to and when we get a revelation Friends of who we are and what we have been called to be and who is the captain of the ship friends then it doesn't matter what waves we might steer through or what storms might come or great winds or trials or things that would assail us because he's in control and he's the master of every win the master of the sea glory to God amen multiplier you see so it's peace through preeminence what is he's that he's that he's the Prince of Peace now Prince speaks of rulership it speaks of authority see he's the captain of the vessel he's the one with the authority he's the one with the preeminence and it's peace through preeminence that's many times why we don't have peace because he's not the preeminent one not allowing him to be the sovereign one no no trust no faith no no no resting in him amen when we go through things in life's journey but in it but but that's the way that peace comes we look at this this story in the Bible of the Sea of Galilee how they came into this storm and I was just marveling about it here how here's Jesus Christ an actual advent of the Savior amen he's come in a human flesh he's come in a body and the world is so miss him his disciples have missed him not knowing who was in their midst amen and and and and it's such a mystery to them until when the waves came when the storm came even they begin to grow free they begin to they begin to question they begin to worry I say Lord do you even care amen and and and and I've been there friends in my Christian life amen when the waves come and when things we don't understand and we just wonder why it is the way why it has to be the way that it is and and and wondering Lord do you even care are you even are you in control where are you in all of this amen but yet his presence Amen never left for a moment Amen it might have looked like he was sleeping but the important thing was he was there and he was there then there was no wave that could seek that boat there was no storm that could tip it over as long as he was in the boat amen so we're resting not in our self not in the makeup of these mud ships not in the waves that we think we can crest but our rest is he's in the boat his presence on the inside gives us peace amen but you see but I was marveling at this situation because it's so it's so perfect to the day that we're living in how his disciples didn't understand everything that was going on maybe they were looking at the crowds getting smaller maybe they were looking at the critics rising up they were they looking at this one and that one and this struggle and this seemed like this unanswered prayer or whatever would be amen and becoming discouraged amen and I'm marveling they're on that boat and here's the one that the scripture said was going to be the Prince of Peace and he was going to bring peace to the world he was going to take the throne of David amen he was going to bring order to everything but they're in a storm there's no peace there was no peace in the world amen there was no peace on that sea but there was peace on the boat amen so you see Jesus brings the correction amen there they're saying where where's peace but Jesus said think not I'm coming to bring peace to this world he said I came not to send peace but a sword amen he said I came to divide I came to I'm not bringing peace it's not coming he said it's not coming this coming you're looking your thing about a son of David Rainey said but but but I'm not bringing peace to the world and neither is it today friends when we look at the state of the world that we're living in the message didn't bring peace to the whole world it brought an indictment but to us it was Shalom hallelujah amen because the message to the elect it's peace in spite of the storm in spite of the state of the world in spite of the temptations and the trial that we're going through he's in the boat so here there's peace there's peace where we are all see their expectation was all wrong and even the ones who heard his met came out heard his message Amen or they were there for the healing campaign that scripture says there are couples verses up how all they heard was parables they didn't couldn't understand it all it wasn't a quarter of their taste it wasn't according to their expectation Oh master don't you care that we perish amen but he said peace be still brother Breton said go away Jean he said he said you you you can awake him today amen however if you're one of those mud ships born-again Holy Ghost on the inside you can wake him amen you're going through a storm you can wake him today and brother Graham said it didn't have to be old master Oh master oh Jesus amen Oh in a panic and worried but just master amen Oh hallelujah and then he would rise he we can wake Jesus this morning Alleluia but not if you're looking at the circumstances in the world but look who's in the boat friends don't look at what the critics say about the message look at the Christ that's in this message the life that's in this message it'll bring you peace it'll bring peace it'll give you preeminence hey man amen and he rises up speaks peace to that storm because he was the master of the storm he's the Prince he was the Prince he see but they were looking for they were looking for what they thought I should be they thought I should be peace in the world they thought I should be peace in Jerusalem but it was peace on the boat amen because the prince was on the boat so friends don't worry when the circumstances don't match your expectations and I'm not just talking about our personal Christian lives I'm talking about this message this move of odd what this revival coming to this bride when it doesn't match our expectations it ought not to shake us a bit Amen because every every storm every every trial that said is to prove who's in the boat a man that's why that's why he brought a storm oh my and I love this quote an endtime evangelism brother brems said that see now think about art now change your expectation let the message change the way that we think this morning he said it seems like at the end time that the message and messenger both is about broke he said it looks like Satan is trying to rim wreck us it looks like we're defeated but don't you worry he said you know it's usually in that time when God steps in at the scene amen he's been watching for a long time amen and it's always in those weakest moments when it looks like the true message is just about defeated that's when God steps in and he lets the messenger and the message get to the end of the road and then he comes in and rides the high waves hallelujah amen that's what I believe amen oh that's the kind of God I sure Amen many times he seems like he's sitting back and just watching watching our reaction watching our faith watching our tests watching our trial but don't be afraid friends amen when it comes down to that weak moment when it comes down to the end it seems like it seems like it's all falling apart that's when he steps in and the master of the wind rides the high waves amen and the boat that you're in will never go under as long as he's at the helm he might steer you through a store and he might take you over some waves and down in his from valleys but he's in the boat and it'll never sink as long as he's in there amen amen the Prince of Peace amen as Christians we often look for peace and find a storm how many times are we looking for a looking for an answer looking for a peace looking for a looking for an oasis looking for a rest and we find another storm and another storm and another trial and another tribulation but not realizing that the piece is in us not in the conditions not in the surroundings not in the circumstances but in here amen oh if I go to prepare a place for you I will not leave you comfortless peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world giveth let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid not as the world gives Amen not a worldly peace but his peace and what is it it's that comforter it's that holy spirit on the inside bringing us peace oh my you're not alone friends many times we feel like we're going through life's trials and we feel like we're going in alone like heaven is shut and God's not answering but but the but but what but all through the Bible he's given us the instruction he's given us the exam he took the three Hebrew children amen going into the fire and they didn't know if they were going to come out of it they had nothing to tell them that they were going to survive that ordeal but what they what but what the answer that they had was to just be still just take another step a man had come to find out the fire only served to prove who was with them the whole time a man the only thing the fire kigu was take away the bondage hey man you're not alone friends you might feel load you might not know what's around the corner but you're not alone you're not forsaken he's with you even in you even to the end of this world Lord of God you might be struggling with the Lord like Jacob struggle just wrestling sing God I need an answer I need I need something Lord I need a breakthrough I feel like I'm falling apart I feel like I'm coming down to the end of my last straw and what did the God do he let Jacob come to the very last straw amen brother Brad said God took Jacob wrestling with that angel and he took him to the very end of his human strength until he had come to just just the verge of death until his strength was gone he couldn't stand anymore couldn't walk right amen and wrestling with the Lord until brother Aaron said crippled and it was weak just like we get spiritually sometimes but watch now what came in the morning what came in the morning brother man said a fearless Prince hey manna and every Christian you might be wrestling with God today but just wait joy comes in the morning amen something's coming strength comes in the morning the joy of the Lord will be your strength hallelujah a fearless Prince I love it I love the way the prophet preaches that Amen one day what a difference one night can make just a couple hours in his presence until you've wrestled until you've just come to the end of the rope and then find within yourself a strength that will you didn't fake was there because it wasn't their friends it wasn't there when you were looking at your straight it wasn't there when you were looking to your wisdom but when you look to Jesus you can press the way just look to Jesus glory be to God Amen God speaking this morning and then receive your peace this morning amen we're going through a trial amen oh hold on to God today and you'll find out it's not you doing the holding but he's the one holding on to you hallelujah when you come down to the end well even Jesus amen here we are battling a spiritual death that's coming to the churches amen an antichrist spirit that's come to make us cold and lukewarm and make it a burden to serve the Lord try to make us so formal and so starchy and so back slid a man and we're battling that spiritual death but death can't take you friends when death took Jesus where the ran said Jesus came down to those so low came down to death but he said when the shock of death left him he was stronger than than he ever was before when the shock of death left him he could walk through walls he could work miracles he goes ascend up into heaven friends I tell you oh we might be in a battle we might be under attack there may be a pale horse riding against this bride but I tell you when the shock of that spiritual death cannot hold us it cannot it cannot keep us friends but we will be stronger from the trials oh I wish I could preach it the way that I feel it this morning God's peace Shalom good news not worry not fret Shalom God's peace be with you hallelujah and brother Browns chatter when he when he had recovered from the shock of the death that's when he was at his strongest Amen and it looks like brother Brown said it's pretty weak now for both message and messenger come on friends let's be real about it what about the devil come into your mind say what about this what about that how about it you know what about this statement of that and this and that and it looks like brother have said it looks like it's pretty weak now for a message and messenger but don't you worry he said somewhere I don't know how but I'm trusting him I don't know how but I'm trusting him he'll come riding in on the scene someday don't you worry friends I believe with all my heart that that one that he's talking about has ridden this trail once more a man and he's here with this bride to do the impossible to Chris every way to speak peace every storm and there is not a storm in this world there is nothing the devil can whip up that will seek you and I because we are sons and daughters of God predestinated to stand hallelujah it's always darkest just before the dawn oh but the peace see the piece is in recognizing his presence you will never find peace looking out here oh mercy you spend five minutes with the newspaper spend five minutes on on a website I mean it'll destroy you the peace is in his presence and recognize in his presence that's our Shalom our light has come a light has come to this bride friend and brought us peace the principle has come the Dayspring from on high half visited us to give light to them that are in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace amen what is that light scriptural light is the manifested word The Vindicator word is light and the light has come France and then we have the word we have the light and it's able to guide us into the way of peace but we must recognize what it is who it is and recognizing his presence will bring the peace France amen brother Brad said the spoken word of God being made manifest the light of the hour so if he vindicated the word of today if he vindicated the word how many believes he's been he's thrice vindicated he's dedicated it over and over and over again as if a prophets ministry wasn't enough he sent you a pastor he broke we rose up a ministry a man who revealed his word to you and over and over and over again he's brought light to your feet friends it's a vindicated word that has come to bring us peace hallelujah then if it is a vindicated word what do I care about what the year brings what do I care about next year what do I care whether I live today or die today every word that a promise will be vindicated every word hallelujah everyone brother Graham said well at one place he said every word that was spoken of this endtime of this bride he said I must fulfill it I must fulfill it if it's a word of God spoken for this day not another day friends this day we must fulfill it we will fulfill it amen and recognizing his presence as sure as there is a Sun in the sky and a moon to reflect it amen we know that this day it is the rising of the Sun and the mighty God has been unveiled amongst his people brother have said my ministry is to declare him not that he's coming not that he's coming not that he's coming that he is here amen then if he's here we can have peace friends we don't have to worry we don't have to struggle and wonder how we're gonna do it how we're gonna take a rancher he's here to take a sinner rapture blurring the gun but what and what is he here to do to take preeminence in a bride that's what he's come for is to take preeminence in you hallelujah Prince of Peace peace through preeminence amen a ruler a prince peace through preeminence Amen these and there on that boat they're looking for that son of David rain wondering why is everything white seems like everything falling apart I thought he was going to come and fix this I thought he was going to take the throne I thought he was gonna kick the Romans out I thought everything was going to be great I thought there was never gonna be a trial I thought there'd never be a storm when Messiah came amen and they're looking for something that was to come and missing what had come in their day missing what was present in there Mitch oh and there is a son of David Crane there is a son of David coming Isaiah said oh he's going to sit on the throne of David on the throne of his kingdom he's going to bring it into order he's gonna bring priests peace to the whole world but they're but they're on that boat friends on that boat of life like you and I are sailing in this morning amen there was no peace in Jerusalem there was no peace in Rome there was no peace in politics there was no peace in religious systems but there was peace on that boat and friends that's what a bride coming means to me we are not in a son of David reign hallelujah but we have the Prince of Peace well peace I leave with you my peace give I unto you we're not in a church age Amen but we are in Christ we're not in a millennium but we are in Christ amen and I had a rapture yet but we're in heavenly places hallelujah he's not on the white throne the judgment but he's enthroned in his bride and wherever he's in throne there is peace if the Prince of Peace ever it's the throne of your life and will bring peace friends but it will only be peace through preeminence no wonder the most miserable people in our churches are the ones riding the line between religion and priced between worldly things in Christ riding that line of religion no wonder you're miserable no wonder there's no peace you've got to get in the boat you got to get into Christ you've got to give him the preeminence in your life young man young woman you will never have peace from this message without preeminence until he's your master your king your Lord the sovereign one of your life it will never bring you peace it will bring you trouble it will bring you struggle amen but in him there is ultimate everlasting peace that passes all understanding peace through preeminence amen amen you say brother Nathan yeah there's going to be a millennium there's gonna be peace we're gonna go to that place there will be peace oh yeah I believe that you know we're going we can have peace over there amen you know that's Scripture you know that's first son of David rain and I'm looking so looking forward to that time when he'll come and he'll bring peace to every heart and it'll wipe away every tear amen and he'll he'll help us in our sorrow but friends what do the scriptures say it said he's wonderful I want to ask you was he wonderful amen as he revealed himself to be wonderful amen oh he's um he's a counselor amen oh it has he counted you by the revealed word amen he's been your counselor is he Almighty God and everlasting father then he's the Prince of your peace hallelujah don't have to wait for peace wherever he is there's peace hallelujah amen and the wonderful thing about a prince is the prince has rulership over a principality over every prayer amen when he has the preeminence he also has the power hallelujah when he has the preeminence he also has the power and he rules over a principality and I'm here to declare to you that this prince is greater than the principalities of the powers of darkness he's greater than the Prince of the power of the air but this prince has the power over every devil friends amen amen whatever you are up against this morning you can cast it down by the authority of the Prince of Peace amen wherever the devil's bring it against you your imagination cast it down worrying about what's going to happen your affections hold things are holding on to you can cast it down today amen reason you just trying to figure it all out cast it down cast down all these things cast down fear cast down every word you have the power you have the authority this morning by the Prince of Peace to take authority brother Brent said now we are spiritual kings and priests ruling over a spiritual Kingdom you have an authority by the Prince of Peace and that authority Trump's every authority of every devil every Power Out of Hell is not worried the stand well then why are we so afraid friends the devil has come with such fear and such worry and such dread in every heart I say let the devil tremble today Amen I say let the devil be afraid let the devil be notified the Prince of Peace is here in the bride of Jesus Christ and we've come to tear down every wall take down every stronghold cast down every vein pay every dark thing and take authority over the principalities of darkness don't be afraid friends let the devil tremble he doesn't fear us but he fears the one we represent he fears our prince hallelujah for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God well but we have this treasure in earthen vessels mud ships mud ships we got this treasure in mud ships that the excellency of the power might be of God and not of us hallelujah who's got the power not you not me hey amen I don't know if you realize friends that you're not the one holding it all together Amen I tell you look at look how gods look look at the things God's done just in this assembly but well we ought to begin to think as a church how God has blessed how God has prospered how God has opened his work a man that's not that's not a man that's done that there's no deacon there's no trustee Amen it's sure not brother Samuel has done it all any man you got a good pastor to believe that a man but God has done the work God has built a church God has brought us together and God's going to take us all the way through the zeal of the Lord shall perform this the excellency of the power is not on you and I Amen but of God then that's where our peace is that's where our rest is we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed and there is no storm there is nothing the devil can whip up there is nothing he can do a man that could ever destroy what God has wrought if God built this mud ship it'll crest every way hallelujah you see friends he's going to have the preeminence now we preach in it give him the preeminence given me authority give him the rule ship but he's going to have the preeminence in a bride he will because we are predestinated unto adoption I don't know if you know but adoption isn't some super achievement it's grace that capstone grace it's grace it's the work of God and then be at peace this morning friends God's doing the work God's build the church God's were God's at the helm a man he's the one steering the boat we're gonna be okay you realize that friends everything's gonna be okay everything's gonna be all right hey man that's not wishful thinking or some psychology mind over matter some kind of positive cult-like thinking that is the truth by the Word of God everything's gonna be all right we're gonna make it through we're gonna have an adoption we're going to take a rapture we're going to be crowned we're going to be capped we're going to go hallelujah and he's the one doing it the zeal of the Lord shall perform this it's his passion behind it his strength his desire Oh hallelujah it's his it's it all it's his longing to bring it forth well then I'll tell you what if he's longing to do it there's no devil's gonna stop it and neither are you and I gonna stop it how do they mean we ought to take a praise break hallelujah we're gone you realize he's going to perform it amen hallelujah someday friends we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna stand there and that's a son of David Rick there's coming a time when we shall crown him with many crowd but before we crown him do you realize he has come to crown us amen for he has brought the capstone down upon this bride and the government is upon the shoulders of this body hallelujah and if he's able to crown you then he's able to crown himself hallelujah is able to bring forth his crowning achievement his greatest desire the zeal of his heart he's able to bring forth a bride but you've got to let this message crown you let it be your crown friends sometimes it's going to feel like a crown of thorns it'll feel like a cup of suffering but that's the kind of crown he wore amen Oh sometimes we're going to go through things sometimes we're gonna wonder why things are happening sometimes we're gonna wonder why we got to be sad and discouraged and go through hard trials oh but the peace is only through preeminence let him have his way I say let him crown my life let him take control let him have the sovereign authority let him be our Lord and our King brother has said he achieved the church Christ a mystery God revealed he achieved a church the fault that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days that when he gets preeminence in the church when he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do even more than the shall he do for I go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation the thing that's been at the center of God's heart from the beginning of creation and beyond before there was a world before there were governments before there were civilizations before there was human history before there was before there was a Sun or moon France God desired a bride and you think you think Laodicea is going to stop him Amen you think the struggling of this present time are worthy to be compared to what God has envisioned from the beginning for you and for me Amen and how he has chosen us and shaped us out of the dust of this earth to be a simple - in our eyes a simple vessel a humble little mud ship but with him at the helm it's a battleship friends Amen it's got nuclear power it's got it's got it's got an engine it's got a force it's got a drive you're not going to hold it back it's going to crest every way amen the rains and the storms of this world it might melt the clay away it might have rode the kingdoms of this world rode the worldly things but this mud ships sealed amen it's pitched friends amen it's covered hallelujah it's not going down it's going up it's going over hallelujah I don't want you I feel happy this morning amen then friends the only thing that we can that we can stay this morning to God be the glory I'll just let him be the preeminent one to God be the glory hey man when we're going through friends when we're going through hard times to God be the glory good times to God be the glory trials come to God be the glory deliverance comes to God be the glory whatever stain we find ourselves friends to God be the glory I believe there's something special in the heart of the bride of Jesus Christ because of the love that she has for her bridegroom there's a trust there there's a perfect faith there in the one that has loved her the one that has nurtured her the one that has covered and protected her that when she has to go through something when she has to go through a trial there's just a strength in the bride of Jesus Christ a desire in the heart of a true believer say God I don't know what you're doing I don't know quite understand but to God be the glory to God be the preeminence hallelujah friends amen I get so inspired to see to see the strength of a faith in fellow believers many times amen just recently a young lady I know very well and she just gone through her fourth miscarriage and carrying that sorrow carrying that that trial yet walking around singing yeah whatever it takes Lord for my will break whatever it takes to be more like you that's what I'm willing to do that's the bride of Jesus Christ amen when the storms come when the waves come to God be the glory he's in control he knows what he's doing God's got this friends he's got a purpose he's got a plan for it all amen doesn't always bring comfort to our emotions but it brings something to our heart a peace a rest now for him to get the glory it can't be yours or mine no for him to get the glory it's not going to be my opinion in your opinion the way I think it ought to be and the way we ought to run things around here No oh my he could never get the glory in that kind of environment France it's not going to be your church or my church or that ministry or this ministry or that one or this celebrity Amen or this politic it's got to be the word has to be the preeminent one amen amen that's why we have a wonderful fellowship with brother Samuel I believe in this church the word has the preeminence and never let it be friends don't ever think that you a men aren't important enough in your opinion or your idea or your direction or your vision amen to bring something that's not according to this word because it's not your work it's not a man's work not brother Sanders work it's God's work just let him work hallelujah let it be the preeminent woman friends Amen we've got to in this crucial hour we have got to keep the vision amen my heart for you though this morning a manicure hold fast to this vision hold fast to this word let it be the bridge now more than ever let it have the preeminence friends for the devil is raging he's brought up every storm he's tried to whip up everything trying to bring a division trying to bring disagreements trying to bring hurt feelings and everywhere he can get a foothold he's trying to come in and and split things up and pull it apart but friends when he has the preeminence when the Prince of Peace has the preeminence the devil will never have a foothold but you've got to give him the preeminence we can't just get distracted by earthly politics when we belong to an attorney kingdom an eternal Kingdom France amen and when we get over there it won't matter anymore who's who and who said what and what's going on there and what they're preaching down there and you know our church we shout and they don't and we sing this and they don't we don't have time for that friends amen it's too late of an hour not trying to do a work don't get distracted now keep the vision keep the word the preeminent one and watch what God's fixing to do I feel with everything that's in me that we aren't in to move friends there's something in the air amen I'm not just saying that to stir somebody up it's in my every thought throughout the day throughout the weeks in the months God is doing a work friends in this time in this season there's something happening with the bride the move is on for the bride I feel that Russell amen I know something's coming something's happening already amen amen I believe that I believe that so I'm not going to get caught up in this and caught up in that we got to rise above those things you know exactly what it is brother Bram said God created the wind and God created the water it was a work of God just like God brings the church God raised up a church God raised up a ministry God raised up a man or a woman or a deacon or whatever amen and God created it but what it is the devil got into that the devil got into that wind and brother Bram said that's the way it isn't believers sometimes they let down the bars the unbelief and their Satan comes in with a whirlwind causes fusses and stret and stews and arguments and everything that's the devil getting among people the Prince of the power of the air what a quote now those disciples should have said now there's something wrong here something wrong there lays the Creator right there right there but instead of looking at that personal presence of the literal life of Jesus Christ they were looking at the store looking at what the devil did devil will split a church raise up a critic bring a falling away amen some turmoil some drama some whatever he could do trying to take our eyes and get us looking at the storms of this life but the prints that's in this boat the Prince of Peace is greater than the Prince of the power of the air and there is nothing he can stir there is nothing he can bring up that our Lord cannot bring peace amen for he's the master of every storm friend you know what that means to me when he has the preeminence we can have unity in the church we can have resolution now you say now we got this bad situation this there that whatever you know I don't know what's what what you all deal with but people are people Amen and so this one rubs against that one and this rise up and this happens and there's this falling out of disagreement I believe with all my heart that because we have the Prince of Peace Amen that there can be a resolution there are no impossible situations there are there is nothing impossible there is no storm that he cannot master no matter how bad it looks no matter that you might feel like things are falling apart it's not going to fall apart there's someone who can hold it together let's wake him up wake him up in my life wake him up in your life say Jesus Amen I'm calling on you Lord be president be preeminent and speak peace to my sister oh that's why Ephesians 4 they're talking about this adoption endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace what is that bond of peace one body one spirit one hope one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all if he's in you and he has the preeminence in you and he has the preeminence in me we might disagree bitterly but we can get
