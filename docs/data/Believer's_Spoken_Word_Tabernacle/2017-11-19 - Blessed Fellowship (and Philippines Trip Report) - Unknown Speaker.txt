good it's so glad to be in the house of the Lord and we want to just show you a little bit of things here from the Philippine report or from the trip to where the jury and I had went there and he's caught we just want to show you some pictures here and now to see how the Lord will take it this morning because I have some things on my heart that I'd like to share with you looking into the word of the Lord one reminds you we we set the communion service for 3:30 this afternoon and the reason that we had done that has just try to allow as little time in between so we didn't have things dragging on in between services and time and we can get back here and and go right into the communion service without any delay so the Lord willing that should work out well for us there at 3:30 amen if you will you know what while we're waiting waiting Nita let me hook this up here thank you Miss Brian why don't you turn in your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 11 it's not what I'm going to preach from but you can at least get a little hold there well you know I'm the pastor of this church I got a tambourine in my bag and I don't know how it got there they find some other good things in there too it's not a big tampering it's a little this in Isaiah chapter 11 verse 10 and through verse 12 there this is a this is a scripture here that that brother Rowell and go ahead and give me up on vga one this is a scripture that brother Rowell and the brothers over there really had we're just really bringing to our attention and this is just I really believe a fulfillment of what we see there because there say you you've witnessed it as a congregation here over a number of years of the reports of things that are going on and taking place in the Philippines and it's just truly just the great work of the Lord and you know it would not have it would not have happened if God did not provide the direction and the leadership in order for that to take place and you most of you you know of the things that have have taken place where brother al had the burden on his heart to do the mystery expose because many of the the ministers and different ones they're there they're longing for new material so brother o L put together many different powerpoints and he would go in and they would you know offer a minister's Expo or seminar and that would get their attention because the ministers wanted new things to bring to their assemblies and so you know as you go through the whole they go through the whole presentation sometimes a couple days sometimes one day they go through all of these that brother oil has just laid out there in the scripture and you know it were Bible schools Bible students and different ones have actually been brought there and there's been is the reports have been over the years there are entire churches have have come and embraced for the message of the hour it's just a real wonderful thing I got a chance to meet and actually ministered in some of those places that where those pastors and and and now in in those places you have pastors who are there as young men because those who had embraced that in the message with the church they've they've moved on or they've either passed on and so you see the work of the Lord continuing so we want to just just read here in the scriptures it says and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an in sign of the people to each shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand against the set again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria from Egypt from Pathros from cush alam from shanaar and from Hamas and from the islands of the sea and they really really really lay on that from the islands of the sea because the Philippines itself is made up of over 7,000 islands and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth so it's truly a time where God is is redeeming and laying claim to that which belongs to him I just want to kind of in going just going back a little bit maybe to try to give a little bit of just a little bit of a an idea of where where that it's at just in case anyone doesn't know that but here very very close there you can see to Vietnam they see the Philippines there in the middle and then just in relation to where we're at and my you know that's a map that when I was there I did not want to see that map right there because that meant that my family was right there my wife was there and I was here but don't block those thoughts out so it's it's quite a you know it's on really on the other side of the world and you see here just a little bit of fun I apologize would it help if I turn these lights off would help I apologize that this is a little blurry here it's because of the connection that that would that I have going through here is that better okay so here there I've showed you this because we most of our time was really concentrated around Manila I need to lower this just a little bit this was really concentrated around Manila we also went out into you'll see in just a moment we go out into this area over here into Samar so the the two main places where we were going we flew into Manila and then we were traveling to the island of Samar and to go there we flew from Manila down here to Cebu and then from Cebu over to caballo the island of Samar this is this is the the camp meeting that they were having and brother Gerry a brother Oh al and myself were ministering there at three services a day brother Rael took the middle service and we allowed us to rest but it allowed them to speak just in in the native language without any translation in the island of Samarra I just skipped that other one because this is this brings it a little bit more to you we were right here in caballo in Samar so we flew in here and this is where that camp meeting is taking place we had just about I think three or four hours of sleep we landed with one the first night we got there and brother or else we've sweep this away we could not even go to even though brother o-l lives in a part of Manila we couldn't go from the airport to his house because in order to do that even though it's only from his house to the airport is about nine miles it would have taken us over three hours to get there so we had to actually just stay very very close to the airport and then we which allowed us to have a few hours of sleep and then we had to get up and board the plane early to fly here we came into the bayou and my that's you know you can kind of see it's a very very very small airport I think even the airports that we have here in the state some of the smaller ones would probably be bigger than this Airport the the baggage claim area there is no belt it's just men bringing the bags in there's no there's nothing moving it along you they just push it on tables and you know I have pictures of that as well but it's just you know and you're there and you know in the plane itself is the propellers you know on the plane it's it's it's not a little puddle jumper but it has propellers on it and so you know it I don't know if it's just an older plane an older model that they received but anyhow we we did have a wonderful a trip there in the Lord gave us safe travels we come in here to the the camp-meeting and this is out there in the in the in the the country there of caballos so we flew in and then coming you see a little bit more into the the venue where the camp meeting is gonna be taking place and brother-brother lanlan which is the host pastor he they just had built this church here just within the past two years and so they had been having church there right there in the city where he's located which is right there but the Lord provided that property for them and if you remember the Wednesday night brother Jerry spoke on possessing the unknown and I made mention to you that I had received reports from the airline that you may have to reschedule and you know because of weather that was coming up and there was a typhoon that was coming through that area and the typhoon itself it the direction diverted you know into Japan and that's really where they were looking at our flight being hindered is right there in in Tokyo the typhoon continued to come but it was more direct in that area but it was the it was the rain and one of the things that's just a real testimony to the prayers not only here but also is well over there is the the rain itself stopped on the Monday before we even left here and from from that typhoon and that's a that's a real rainy season for him and you should have had to rain from the typhoon one of the arms coming out there and that rain did not resume again until the Monday after we were finished it just was the Lord and the thing of it is is that I'll show you a picture here in just a moment if if it had been where that rain if it had rain during that time which that's their normal rainy season I honestly don't know how that we would have been able to even walk up to the church or even to to get around in that area where they were having the meetings because they didn't hold it at a campground this year they the brother just held it there and I don't know how we would have been able to get around I don't know how the believers would have been able to set outside even though they had tarps that's because of the amount of rain and the mud and how that would have been running so God was so merciful for that this is this is brother brother lanlan is that he was the host pastor here of the of the of the meetings and just a picture of brother landlord's family and it's just a blessing every one of them I think except the young lady right here every one of them were right there on that stage playing instrument and right there in the service but I tell you what she really has a dynamic voice just being able to really enter in it all of them sing as well so and brother lanlan I don't have the picture on here but brother lanlan actually makes guitars yes it looks just like that bass guitar right there and other guitars just makes it right out of hand he gets the little parts from United States but he then you know makes it all out of the wood you can kind of see here that the place where they had actually been able to construct heading into these meetings right here is where the believers the quarters were those believers who are coming in where they were going to stay and there were believers that had traveled down from ran on the northern part from Manila all the way down they had to take a ferry between two of the islands and it took them I think was about 2425 hours some of them to get there by then and and the amount of people in the van I just I was just amazed I told her I told the brothers I'm just amazed because they were traveling and they picked up more I don't know how they they they put him in there but you know they did this is on the back part of the church they're gonna be making that into Sunday school rooms but also they use that he will use it and did use it in these meetings for sleeping quarters or visiting believers see some of the some of the pictures share show you of the believers worshipping during the time of the camp me you can kind of see out through there they had the what I was telling you about the chairs they had set up there out there they also had it had the chairs set up off to the side over here and the windows so that the people could could hear the services as well these were the pastor's that that attended the camp meeting and and some of them like the brother here he traveled like 24 25 hours here to be in that service and it's just a real real wonderful unity that was there among among the brothers and a rung among the saints of God and as I was ministering and even actually I think it was he might have been one brother Jeremy's ministry I noticed within the church I thought lord have mercy there's so many young people here in this service you know and so with that right there you know I just my heart I just really started in the services just you know the Lord just even really taken a direction for for the young people and of course they you know one wanted a picture and when they get into pictures man it's just like it's non-stop I think selfie was invented in the Philippines so they you know they was really a wonderful time there with the with with all of them and here you find a little place they had set up this is on the out outside of the church there where have a line where you see some of the believers I got a few pictures of where they're starting to go into and eat there after service they they cooked on the ground they had people that were designated and they they cooked breakfast they cooked lunch they could suffer for for all of the people and then you have here I took another little picture in this little area right here this is part of the kitchen but then there's a they have the fire out to the right where there was a brother that was the brother actually did all of the cooking as far as for the meat from the you know from the beef to the water buffalo to the you know they lachung you know they're wanting to put that out and you know inlet own and you know they were wanting to show me their Cheech other that's it that's that's not I don't need to teach our own he's like that mine are more crisp but I did have some I took a picture of some of the buffet very very good but this one here I just you know I we it was such a wonderful thing that they had had done but you can see what I'm talking about with the wisdom with the dirt if it had rained this is where we had come in off the street here off the road if it had rain all of this you know you're kind of walking up a little bit of a hill that got a little swell for the water to travel but I honestly don't know how we would have been able to do this because you see right at the very next day the next morning here's the rain from the typhoon right here right after the camp-meeting it's just it's coming down the river that was on the other side over the hotel we were staying it rolls just within that one night it rose I would say at least at least about two foot if not three foot I was amazing it took a picture of it because the rivers right there right up next to the to to the little cafe and I took a picture of it and it was already up to that place where I could see the marks on the cement and it might have been well over three foot it just was a it was just I couldn't believe it we heard it in our room raining but I didn't know what it was I thought well I don't know maybe it's rain that's outside or but you know the Lord was so mindful of us I'm going to show you a little picture here a couple of pictures because I gotta show you some things that be a little bit funny here you know because there was so many funny things that happened during that during the trip and think the Lord for that as well you know you had a here's a little pull here's a little thing now this is this is a motorcycle and then you know they put this over top of that motorcycle there's a chair right up here right next to the driver where the jury's gonna get in there and then beside brother Giri is a brother brother VIN brother VIN you know is a pastor here I'll show you in just a little bit and what we're doing is a very important mission we're traveling for coffee now I know you think it's my idea this was not my idea I found out the very next morning after we got to some more before we started the meetings that brother Allen one of the pastor's here that you'll see in a few moments brother Alan took a tricycle out into the city because brother Allen likes good coffee and see we were drinking the powdered instant coffee you gotta use your imagination you know you imagination imagine you know so brother Jay and I were taking there so when brother Allen said hey he said last night I went on a mission and I scoped out the town I said well why did you do that he said you know we wanted to check out for coffee I said oh man so they asked do you wanna go I said let's go let's let's go let's go so anyhow we went we went down there and now in the back there was already a person here setting in the back brother Roy gets down and sets right there then brother Owen says come on in here he said there's plenty of room so I jumped in here and then brother Allen comes in there were four of us back here three up front that motorcycle was in the process of I think I can at least it never come to I thought I could it overcame it and then here we are on the way back so on the way back you know we a little bit less room and they put brother Jerry and brother VIN up front again and then they have brother brother Oh L and brother Alan there and they have me to sit here and put my feet right here okay you know I thought man you know it might be all right I got something hanging on to well you know how it is some of you there's been over in those other places and countries you know the horn is decorations here you all know what I'm talking about I tell them that I told I've told to the brothers in Ghana I said look horns are decorations they're novelty here they're not we don't you really use them I said you all use them yes sir you got a morse code like beep-beep I'm turning right beep-beep I'm turning left let me out I'm coming out it doesn't matter what's going on I've come out got a faith to drive here man so anyhow they have me here on this and I and and and the story was is that you know they're driving and you know it's almost like what the you know the Lorraine Ian's tried to do to Route six here before they put all those lines down Route six thank God they just did that they would you know want to make six lanes out of one lane well that's what they were doing here and my feet were on the edge right there and here comes this big old bagel bus coming by and I seen the bus I'm moving off feed him and then I realized wait a minute there's the motorcycle wheels right here so I'm trying to move my feet and I said Oh Lord don't let my toes go down that way but I mean that thing was right there right and right in front of me I remember the colors it was dark pink here and light pink up here it just went right by and I remember seeing the rivets lord help me so they you know they were they got a chuckle out of that but for me it was serious that's a very very prominent mode of transportation there there among them you have many that there are drivers there's some of the brothers even in the church even a brother oels that that do that for for a living this is one of the things that's very very very common and they're travel in the Philippines is that GP and the jeepney is just it's it's old war vehicles which you see here how they'll they'll get up on the back and get in you got the driver in the front and it's just it's it's a taxi service this is a little bit better picture of it and they'll get in and they just they haul them around from point to point they're actually doing away with these in the city of Manila as of December they will no longer be able to use those because they're all diesel and they're going more to e environmental things with vans so that they will those will not be allowed in the city of Manila so the Lord within that meeting there in Samar the Lord really really blessed there were many lives that were touched and I'm just going by at the services of what had taken place and you know then afterwards you know I have not had any other reports but I you know you just see the response when the word is is going forth and how that the people are responding to to the word and they were very very receptive and I I know that there were lives that were touched I believe that with all my heart lives that were that were changed and you know sometimes we don't ever you may not ever see anything on this side or no of it but you have that confidence that the word will not return back to the employee see the response and people in the lives and hearts you know hands being uplifted and hearts coming you know to the Lord so then we we made our journey back to Manila and on the journey back to Manila we made a stopover in in Seibu because we had to in change flights there and we just we got a chance to meet with a brother a pastor a young man who would take over a church and we got a chance to meet with him brother Marlon is his name and we had went there because brother Giri had known his dad and brother o.l kind of wanted to re-establish that contact there so we we went there we come back into Manila and we're actually where the church is gonna be at is right here in TyTy and we are here at the convention now the convention was in this time it's only one day they do a one day convention here at brother oels church and they do that because during this time when we had the camp meeting there beginning on the 27th and then all the way through this week through through that particular week the kids and most everybody else had time off they have two weeks off like we have Christmas break and it's because of All Saints Day All Souls Day it's a very very important thing there so they take time off so this is why that people are able to gather in and they have the meetings like they do at that time so we had a day really actually about two days here I mean one day we had there in Monday and some more than Tuesday we traveled back to Manila Wednesday we started in the convention brother o el obviously the host pastor there in the convention and then you see some of the of the pastors that are present that's not all of the pastors but there is there is a good representation and some of those pastors standing right there many of those are pastors that have come out from the mystery expose where where one you know to the Lord in their congregation so see some of the believers that are coming in and it's raining this is theirs there during this there was rain still from the typhoon that was reaching in here to Manila and it's very wet day but the believers here they are they're arriving for that convention here we are and this is a place right next to brother brother Rho elz the church itself that they were able to purchase and they brother o L and the different believers that were there the older ones were quick to remind me that your dad is also very very instrumental when he heard of this he directly gave right towards that and that was probably within the last six or seven years or what-have-you and so that was really kind of gripping you know when I looked there at that I knew when I was here within I think Manila especially as well because I know dad had not spoken that venue but dad had as far as that that place but I knew dad was there so that was a it was a challenging time as far as you know where you have to kind of go beyond all of those those thoughts you know but there's here's brother Pete leading the song service and I'm telling you right now brother Pete was leading the song sort of getting the people in fellowship and brother Jerry and I looked at one another now when you look at it right here who do you think he would look like say it again brother bill he was like brother bill getting the people together in worshipping men just encouraging them in unity and brother Pete is the first pastor who actually was one to the Lord he and his congregation from the mystery expose and you know brother Owen and we're quick to tell us there's been a lot of things that they've learned over the time on how to approach things you know even here after so here's just some of the a little bit more of the pictures kind of get you a little bit of a setting brother all's churches right there so this is this is a the the desire they had is so that they could be able to have venues here they hold a December convention that is about four I think four or five days long and they're able with the different facilities that are in here to actually feed the believers as well when they come so there's this is the the Ida tribal believers which brother Oh Ella those of you they were here on that Thursday he spoke about those those from the Ida tribe that was up there near Mount Pinatubo and the reestablishment of that in that place this is the group of believers right here those that have traveled and some of them travelled and they're not you know they haven't embraced the the word as of yet but but they came this is the pastor right here now there is a there is a lady who was in here and I don't know she has you know I don't think she's fully embraced the message but she is technically under title the pastor but right now really in reality he is that the brother here is the pastor and through this they introduced us after the service all of the tribal council they have their order so I was getting introduced to all the different tribal orders that are among that are among them so it's just a wonderful work that the Lord is doing there it's a very very fresh work that is taking place there and brothers are going in there the we had a service there for the Royals then the following night on Thursday we administered there and then Saturday the young people had a convention they had been having a retreat right after this time but brother royal and them just didn't have the the strength to do it but the young people were pressing them so we had a we had a service there with the young people and just um just a wonderful wonderful time in the Lord just to see how that the Lord would would touch and and deal with with hearts and lives and you know they face they face the same pressures and things that that that we do a lot of times you have things that were because I'm because when I'm ministering here I'm ministry you know you've got I don't want to say exactly all ages but there was there was some that was even a little bit older that we're in there but you have young people that are really they become very occupied you know the the college and things like that a lot of those things are stressed which is fine but sometimes with all of the the pressures and the tension and you think about it many of these young people when I talk to them if they're commuting back and forth to college they have a normal day but then they have a three hour or four our commute at the beginning and a three hour four hour commute at the end of the day so most of their day is just so it's busy and then when their occupation then they work into a city and so forth so there's a there's a lot of pressure sometimes and sometimes you know there's things that the focus of the hour can become clouded in the midst of things but God is merciful and we were so thankful to God that God you know it helps us when we would anything would get out of balance so just a wonderful time with them after this we went on Sunday morning brother Jerry stayed there in Manila and spoke to another Rho elz assembly on the morning and I traveled from over here tight I was about right there where brother owns churches and I traveled to brass and at brass you remember brother Oh L mentioned but he didn't show you pictures of where that this is the the congregation of believers where the government came in and took the land that had been theirs for years and not just talking about a few years but under a Homestead Act that was there in that place after five years that land belongs to you you farm it you settle it it belongs to you many of these believers it's been there within their families for some 35 37 years and the government came in and took and confiscated many of the believers homes the property as well as the church and they tore those down I'll show you pictures in a moment here but this is an area that when brother oels shared that with me at my house here in august it really had touched my heart but i had no idea that i would get a chance to go in and and be with the church here brother Oh Alan the brother Alan the pastor he was with us the whole time when we were there in the Philippines so we got a chance to go there and you see right here this is a little place they've rented now this all of this back in here is government housing and there's things that has that have taken place where because these believers were displaced then you have people in the surrounding areas obviously the rental fees and things like that they're going to charge more now because they know there's people that's displaced so they're they're paying to rent this little space right here and you know it was a little space but here's the thing I did get up on brother Jerry well Jerry preached in Manila and brother Rho elz that day but when I met him later that evening I said I want you to know I said there's one little thing I had that you didn't have he said what's that if I preached in a sea this morning that was good because I had to go and preach right after that I had to travel and preach that night and didn't have too much time in between so here we are and then here's the pastor brother Alan of the assembly brother Alan is 41 years old really has a real real burden for the congregation there this behind here is where they have all their instruments I'll show you a picture here looking out from I'm standing around the front front pew and you can see the little the the space that they have those are the clear doors that I had showed you before and you get a chance to look at the congregation here just a little bit and just a just a very lovely group of people then here they before I travel to the - to the island for this evening service they wanted me to to eat here with them and just just wonderful wonderful people wonderful brothers and sisters and you know to see it when this when some of these things took place right here with the people let me just show you this is some of the property there the government you know put the wire up all of this property up in here this was seized by the government and you know brother Alan when all this was taking place brother Alan obviously the pastor was their brother Rowell came down at that time - because you had brothers probably understand it this is your family heritage for 30-some years so they got out the things with bullets and brother Alan and brother Oh l said hey you know because the government's taken everything they've got so by God's grace you know they were able to to speak to the brother and you know and and to see just a change of events it's not to say that there's not things that don't bother them and you know because there's a great thing that has taken place but it just such a wonderful atmosphere when we gathered there that morning with them and just ministering the word of the Lord to encourage him it's just such a wonderful atmosphere and the fellowship afterwards you didn't detect any bitterness no bitterness there's no doubt they went through their time and there's no doubt that they go through their battles but you know what out of it all it's like when brother or brother Alan told me after that service because there's some things that I had just felt on my heart just to preach from my heart was just some little things and brother Alan's that you know he said I have I communicated to the people he said that in this I don't understand why I don't have the answer he said but there's something that God has out of this if God allowed this to be able to happen and just a little bit more of the pictures here I this up in here there's this little white thing that so anything brother Alan could point out to me that is just one of the walls or one of the places of the church but all these things in here these are believers houses that they just they came in and torn down a thing that they find out is obviously on the next on the other side of the hill the the guy who's developing it for a development well you've got to have a nice certain right away then there has to be an entrance into that development so you need a clear entranceway so their property lay in the way so you know you know how things how things work within that that the reality is really what's behind it all is because there's somebody who owns some property behind there and then you have everything taking place with the government so then they take the land the person behind it has the but God is in control your Lord is in control this right here is what they showed me they did show me there is a property that are inquiring about I couldn't get a real good shot this is after the service after we've eaten it's it's a land right out in here in its land that's out from this out here in the country here's another little bit better shot of it and it's land that they're inquiring to purchase for for the Saints and for the church the idea and the thought line that brother o/l has and they're working to bring the pastors together over there is that this land to purchase this land and then allow this land to become not only a place where they can build the church but believers can build their homes there and they can also be a campground for them to have their camp meetings but it'll be a place for the brothers and sisters who are displaced because virtually all of them that you've seen in that picture in that congregation are displaced there just but they are farmers they know how to go into a land develop a land so that's what they're looking at that it would be an investment for the believers but also be a place where that they can come together in a camp meeting from there we tried traveled we traveled down here and I'm gonna go to this island that evening or the jury's coming down he's gonna meet me and I'm coming from this way and we're gonna go to that island that evening in Liam Island and right just in relation you're Manila's over here this is Metro Manila and here is tule Milam your we're traveling travel to that island and just a little above above the scope shot here of the island see looking down on it one of the things that brother Jerry and and my dad they had come together when my dad was still daddy still passed me and they had come together and there was a brother who was pastoring in this congregation that I went to that they purchased a boat for him that he could do evangelism and most year a lot of you older ones here to the assembly remember that they purchased that that boat so there could be evangelism that would done that pastor has has moved but there's a pastor that's right here brother ven who was with us throughout the whole trip and brother ven evangelizes this whole island he and some others with him but you know they're walking over you know the mountain getting back and forth and so it takes a lot of time for them to get to certain places whereas if there was a boat involved that they could actually get into some things brother then let me know that there are brothers in the church that can build a boat from fiberglass they have that they have that skill in craftsman and I think that where he had told me I have it down in my notes somewhere but it's somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 dollars where they're actually able to do that and build that boat to where he'd be able to get around on the island and for the poor evangelizing he's doing it anyhow he's doing it he's walking he's not it doesn't have a motorbike or nothing he's walking so he's doing it and it's getting done here we are traveling we're gonna we're traveling on a on a boat boarding the boat and here we are we've all met up and going over to the island and I have to tell this on the way to preach that morning brother Alan tells me says the other the Sammis edifice I got in contact with brother VIN you know over at the island he said everything's good to go for this evening I said okay wonderful you know and he said but you know it's our asked him about the weather he said because there's currents in that Lake I asked him you know how is everything going you know with the with the currents in the lake and he said brother Vince said everything is wonderful and he said what it is he said there is a boat he said there was capsized here just the first part of the week and 20 people just lost their lives so I just you know by God's grace I just focus on so my lord you know you you directed that we would go to this island tonight you'll make away well come to find out later on it wasn't that there was some problem with the boat the problem was is you had 20 people on the boat who wanted to go to one side and take a selfie and because they went to one side and took a selfie the boat capsized and they lost their life in the lake so needless to say you see that you see everybody sitting we were ensuring everybody was sitting spread out but the captains were as well looking into this so here we are getting ready to we're getting ready to approach the island coming into the island here and then we made our way up to to the church as soon as we got off the boat you know we had to get there because the service has already started and brother o-l just points to me he says look well the jury and I are gonna take this tricycle you know they're gonna be able to ride but the jury's gonna be able to ride you know next to the motorcycle and brother where I was gonna ride in the back and he's her brother Samuel jump on that motorcycle right there and looked at let that brother take you on up there you know it isn't like you ride a motorcycle every day so I grab on to the back the brother I've got water bottles in this hand the only thing I could do is just hold on with this hand in the backpack one of the brothers grabbed the backpack and they rode me up up the hill and over the speed bumps I just think the Lord we made it there but the brother that was driving was very gracious he didn't try to really rock it over those speed bumps but when we came in here I wish I would have had more pictures of the brothers and sisters singing in this church because I just I got off the motorcycle everything has to start rolling and brother Jerry took some pictures at times but this little church there has been a lot of change that's taken place physically to the church since brother Jerry and dad were there years ago and one of the things the pulpit area used to be right here so they turned the church around and the brother who's the pastor there brother VIN right now brother VIN has done a lot of work physically in the building as well as evangelizing but I want you to see this I want you to see this right here I'm sure some of you noticed this as this caught my attention as I sit there on the front row and I looked at this here's the offering tithe and a mission fund mission fund to go forth in that Island this here it's you know obviously not that you know anyone's more wealthy than anyone but it's it's obvious that when you come to the island here you go out into the outskirts away from Manila and so forth you things change drastically change drastically so things really really change from here the next we went back to Manila that night and then we went into old Metro Manila this they held a ministers meeting there at brother Nestor's church and for the Giri spoken and I put a picture so you can kind of see just it's pretty pretty good-sized so that they can hold the ministers and once again I wish I would have had a better picture because they feed the ministers when they come in there and those ministers come once a month and they all get together and then they talk about different topics and things like that and the word and a lot of things are are even centered around especially some of the the newer ones that are coming in and certain things that they are discussing and speaking about so it's a wonderful it was really wonderful time that we had there and then here we are this is right we traveled back to brother oels place and this isn't his whole place one of these I think that right in here we'd come in here and this is brother oels place right here and when we went there to his house right right the night before we departed and come back home but overall I certainly want to say we certainly appreciate it your prayers and you could sense it when we were there and I really mean that because you know when you're sometimes this was this this particular time was a little different for me and some of the times that previous when I went to Mexico here just two years ago and then the other two times I went into to Africa I was I went in there and I just went in and we did it did a convention so you know you're able just to be right there in your room you're kind of by yourself but when you're in and out here on these things you know you're interacting with people constantly you don't have a whole lot of a long time you got to be ready to go and there's things that you know God was just really really merciful to us and I believe that I know we were refreshed even though tired and body but refreshed in spirit and the people were were really were edified in the word of the Lord and I just want to say we certainly appreciated your prayers I you know sometimes you you look and think my I wonder what the reports will come by and where we will stand someday to be able you know to know what what happened in a certain meeting what happened in a certain time you you know you because sometimes we just don't see or as far as half verbally the things communicated to us but you know what God is in control he is in control so it just had some wonderful services there so my I think I've taken almost all of my time but can I have about 30 minutes communion service is until 3:30 so let's just maybe change our position here and let's stand you can go ahead and turn it off of that sister let's go to first John chapter one bless you verse 1 in John first John chapter 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life where the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you may also have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we we love you lord we're so thankful for your mercy Lord you're gone just as we Lord would look into your word here for a few moments alone I pray that God that you'll just anoint us together Lord and may you just speak to our hearts words that Lord would Lord encourage which strengthen and Lord would Lord minister to the depths of our life Lord Father we just give ourselves to you Lord and ask that you would just have your way in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you may be seated I want to I want to look here just to take a little thought here and dealing with the things that we have been looking at with the new birth with that of election and my heart was just drawn to here over the past times in in thinking of even the approach to the service that we have here this evening into the communion service and to realize that what that we have set before us it's not something that we are coming to do out of a mirror out of a tradition and frankly even in our lives if we're just coming to church and it's just merely just out of tradition we're truly missing the goal and the desire of what God has for us you know you can people can go to gather in many places faithfully they can gather in lodges they can gather in meetings things that take place even around educational environments and other things they can be very faithful in doing that but serving the Lord and coming to the house of God it's not about us just coming to perform a duty serving the Lord is not performing a duty but it is God's desire is that we would serve Him from the depths of our heart that it's not something that it's were required to do but it's that which is done from the very love of God moving in our hearts that what he has done for us by the way that he has made for us that that is so gripped our hearts and our life then now through us what's reflected back to him is the same love that he has expressed to us and so only think of this in terms of the scripture the thought that I was just just looking at and just weighing upon my heart is that of blessed fellowship you think of fellowship one of the words of a fellowship and meaning when you would take of one of it it's a joint participation it's things to where people share a common interest a common goal there's things that you know when you have a meeting sometimes it's your job or you have certain places and you have maybe different committees people come together and the people who are on there are supposed to have the same purpose and being there you know you're not gonna meet there and talk about something else but there's the same there's a common goal there's a common vision there's a common burden and I believe that that's that's the unction of what the Holy Spirit draw calls us together as believers is that it draws us beyond just the living in this life we know we have to live and walk in this life but it brings us to a reality that this earth itself this world the world that we know it's not our home but we are Pilgrims and we are strangers without God moving across our path we we would be as as anyone else we would have and hold the same goals and the same things where they're trying to turn this around and try to turn that around but by the grace of God the sovereignty of God him moving within our hearts then as were assembled together for one purpose and that is the that's the objective that God would bring down through the ages is that we have one hope we have one desire and that's for the coming of the Lord we want to live daily pleasing to the Lord we look and we live for his coming that's everything that that we do he's living for his coming and I I think of that term of fellowship because one of the one of the meanings within that or a word that you can draw from and is the very word communion itself and communion is a very very precious thing you know you communion is where as the definition would say it's it's a sharing or an exchanging of intimate thoughts it's it's it's it's personal it's things that can be spoken and it's received and you know it's just like in this right here right here well we're gathered and in this particular part of the service this part of the service here you're listening you're taking in but in your life when in my life when we walk out of these doors and in a daily that's when we enter in further into communion because God is not interested in just speaking he wants you and I had to speak back to him God wants to have fellowship with you and I that's and that's the desire that that God has and so to see that that that communion in that desire because fellowship itself is a very very precious thing you know the Prophet tells us that within fellowship there is protection we find that within in fellowship it's a wonderful thing because God himself desired fellowship and he still desires fellowship think of it that even prior to the fall and Eden of how that God would make an appointment to come down and visit with his children and it wasn't just a passing by visit that God was meaningful and purposeful that he would come down at a designated time and that time was totally set aside to come down and to fellowship with Adam and with Eve then we won't realize and we understand of how that after that there was a there's a break in that fellowship there is an interruption within that fellowship you find that how that God himself even when God dwelt alone before the Garden of Eden before that Adam was ever here but God was dwelling alone and he desired fellowship you know you know when you flying this God even having the portrayal of where that he would look at Adam and he would look into Adam and God was even seeing himself there within Adam for he said it's not good for man to dwell alone it was that yet what was what had a need and then what he was longing for and what would satisfy what God could see in him is something that dwelt within him and it would take God to bring that forth that's the same thing with God himself there is nothing that could satisfy what he was longing for outside of his own family being expressed that he could communicate with his family sure we find the a wonderful development of how God here bringing in the Stars and all of the the planets and all those things but God couldn't fellowship with stars he couldn't fellowship with planets all of the wonderful things that he he writes it there in the heavens but yet God couldn't fellowship with those with those wonderful those things but God can only fellowship with that which is of is kind so how that God himself think of it of how that in the the Garden of Eden after the news had come of the fall how that God himself God make so Wayne when Adam and Eve are unable to stand in his presence God makes away that they would be able to come and to stand in his presence they could not make their own way but God took that of an innocent one he took from me took that of the skins God here he slays an innocent one and throws those skins back in there that they can be covered by the clothing of one that's from an innocent one God was letting them know that there's only one thing that can take away the guilt there's got to be an innocent one come and that innocent one remove the guilt it's just where God himself in order to bring you and I back to himself as the Prophet tells us in the message token he says God had to get himself back a son again God had to to create God had to bring forth that of a blood cell and and come forth with a blood that was separated from that which was already here because it could not be a polluted blood no matter how many righteous men that ever had lived there was none of them that could sufficiently pay the price that would bring you and I back into fellowship as innocent as the blood of bulls and goats and those of the animal life truly they were innocent but yet none of them could restore the fellowship that God intended to have yet God could communicate he would speak many times to the prophets and different ones but yet it was not the fellowship that of the perfect fellowship that God desired and wanted to have but God would make a way for that to think of how that you know that the Prophet would would place it you know when we look at the great intercessory prayer that takes place here's the Lord Jesus standing upon earth here the the very one holding within him the very price that is required for redemption only he can do it and define here the very heart of God is expressed in an intercessory prayer in John 17 he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are high in them thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou has loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom Dallas given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world this intercessory prayer when we could look just even from the beginning of it and you can take even from the scriptures they them they them they that there is an intended audience for this there is that there is the here the desire that is within it all that thou hast given me those which are ordained to that life that are a part of God and were always a part of God and here this intercessory prayer is that there would be a union you see this is God's desire coming forth it was always God's desire for this fellowship to come God God displays this when here through the life of the Lord Jesus God moves and he claims back that body that he has created he redeems that body back at the River Jordan and declares this is my son it wasn't that the holy ghost me made him the son of God he already was the son of God just like the Holy Ghost does not make you a son of God or the daughter of God it only declares you always were a son or daughter of God so the intercessory prayer this is that if we can say it like this it's a prayer where a mom and dad would have for their own children they would have a desire that their children would be saved would be filled with the Spirit of God that their eyes would be open that they would be walking in the truth that is the same intercessory prayer of how that the Lord Jesus he's praying here for the family of God he's pray for the elect jeans of Almighty God and we realize because of the fall there are many that enter in it's not just where there is going to there is coming for just elect children but there are many who are coming forth no not elect but still they can be saved here is that right so here within this prayer look how the Prophet places that hearing things that ought to be he says Jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the Father one thing after all his sacrifice that he did it on earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing that where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship I don't know about you but this every time I'm listening to this I read across this it always grips my heart because to think of it in the midst of everything that is facing him in this time he asked for our fellowship this was the intercessory prayer and I believe we're always in the mind of God always in tomb and God when were praying for harmony among the children of God I believe we're always in tune with God's mind when we're saying Lord let the bonds of fellowship Lord be strengthened Lord in our hearts Lord God let your word Lord let it let my let our life Lord anything within me that is hindering the connection Lord let it be purged from my life that's coming in line with that intercessory prayer because this prayer this intercessory prayer it is not without fulfillment it has been being fulfilled down through the ages and this prayer right here that's being pray was not a new prayer this is echoed from the mind of God there was already intercession that was made for you and I before there was Adam Stardust or molecule the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he's coming in contact with the intercessory that took place Oh glory that's why when God sends a message every time God sends a message it's God it's the Spirit of God moving in intercessory to that age standing out there with the aged and the darkness and things are Craig Croce and coming upon it but God can take a vessel in his hand and that vessel surrendered to God begins to cry out not that the age would turn around but that that which is of God within that age would be gathered unto the Lord is that right think of how the prophet standing in the message indictment and how that even at the end of that message and here the indictment has come of where that the people have the churches have rejected the very resurrected Lord Jesus Christ and he stands there at the end of that message in his own life he's he's recovering he's he's clearing out over those courses of messages that are there a complex of something in his life and he's asking God when he stands right there for mercy for those who are still caught in those systems and tell you that was not that was not just a man but God had been able to get such an in tune such a love such a desire that it would see that those who are ensnared in their Lord God deliver them I'm telling you friends I'm glad there was one who stood and prayed for me aren't you glad he meant under the inspiration of God I'm glad tonight huh and you know I'm not gonna stay long I just got to get this off because I don't want to sweat this shirt up but I'm glad that there was an accesory prayer that was made when I was astray I'm glad there was intercessory prayer that even if I'd have been sitting in a message church I'm glad that was an intercessory prayer god quicken his seed Lord light him up Lord God Feli what the Holy Ghost I'm glad there was intercessory prayer seseri prayer sees the need of the hour and it moves to call him on the scene who alone can fulfill that word and make that word come to pass only he can he's the high priest of his word Amen I say tonight this morning he's still the high priest of his word oh yeah glory be to God it ain't just for my failures it ain't just for my mistakes no he's not just a high priest for my failures he's a high priest one who's able to minister the strength that I have meet up in order for that word to become flesh in me yes for our fellowship my you know my he could have he could have he could the Lord Jesus he went through friends the the greatest things you know as we stood and we've looked at that here he went through the greatest time of his life but notice there was a deliverance as he looks to the Lord that he's still right here could have been talking about everything that was gonna be fall him what he knew that God had given him strength and here he is in the midst of this asking for our fellowship Oh God that's the only thing he asked the Father in prayer your companionship forever then how much or should we desire him you find how that Abraham remember in Abraham let me just kind of refer to these places Abraham in his own life he gets to a place God's showing these shadows and types and Abraham is looking upon his own house and he sees one Eliezer but Abraham does not see an heir of his own he says one that's born in my house is mine heir and God lets him know that this Eliezer is not your heir but one that will come forth from your own loins that will be your heir what is God all of this said is moving upon Abraham Abraham doesn't know that he's acting out of time he doesn't know that he's acting out the very desire that God had before star duster molecule he doesn't realize that oh my brother and sister down through the time and ages there's things about that God even in this time of day and age that we live in God's desire is being acted out and it's not something that is a tight but it is the fulfillment of those things that were tights but as now made manifest day man what was burning upon Abraham's heart here and God lets him know that that's one from your own bowels that one that shall be thine area now do you remember that there was Sarah she refers she refers Abraham you know to her her handmaid and to to Hagar and Sarah you know says I perhaps God will give me a child by her see Sarah is still under the font line of eye it's not Sarah Syria she's still operating under self and so operating under self self has to make the word come to pass itself so Sarah puts a suggestion let the blonde woman come and let her you can see it she conceived and let that one be thine heir but that was never God's mind I don't care how much alterations to the Word of God it's never God's mind what God has said in his word he will fulfill the right God was letting Abraham know that that from within you that seed that life that will come from out of you and here Hagar she she's put there before him and here Abraham here his seed is not dried up yet are you with me he still has self come on somebody see he hasn't reached a place of complete deadness oh my now I hear the Prophet tell us in the message prisoner Jesus Christ Oh God he said we need to dine more to ourselves he said keep in mind the promise that is before us but let us die more to ourselves in perfect strength of perfect weakness the Prophet says over and over three different junctions within that message concerning his own self and as he's leading into the next phase of his ministry he said I want God to remove me I'm too strong here the strength came forth a seed came forth Abraham his life here it is issuing out but it issues out Wildman it is truly we could say that's a seed of Abraham but Abraham could not have fellowship with that seed as far as in that of the inheritance and the airship that God intended but what what took place we find that no matter you know what would happen that the Bible tells us that Sarah afterwards not Syria but notice Sarah's discernment is honed in the scripture said Sarah saw in that tremendous it doesn't say Abraham saw it's a Sarah saw but Sarah had received of Abraham's faith come on somebody Abraham was ministering that revelation and the Prophet tells us it wasn't Sarah's faith it was Abraham's faith that brought that change and here the promise comes in the notice that learning formed in Sarah that in her life in her life it now brings discernment to where she sees that one who Ishmael mocking the son of the promise as her discernment is he's mocking her determinist is taking away you know that same discernment what was what you see with Abraham shooing away the fouls that same spirit of certainement was moving there and pulsating in Sara's life it wasn't necessarily fouls flying down but she caught it Ishmael is mocking the promise taking away from it so she gives word look at this Authority look at the voice that she has a voice of faith this is not the voice of reasoning now she speaks to Abraham and says cast out the bondwoman and her son because it shall not be heir with him with my son the son of the promise Isaac it shall not be and God stands back listen to me now God comes back around and he a man's what's been said he tells Abraham you hearken unto Sarah's vice he never told him to hearken the first time Abraham did that of his own self but this time this is not no one else but God letting Abraham know this is my mind she's a sign of wise she caught the mocking that was there within the camp what's the difference most were seeds both had come from that of of Abraham one before the deadness one after the change of the body both of them had that of seeds of life but the difference was is the bedding ground the bedding ground made the difference the bedding ground is what separated one to be a son of a bond woman and the other one to be the son of promise one of them God could have fellowship with and one of them God couldn't fellowship with and then put it to you like this this is where the Prophet tells us in power transformation he said that seed word that God sends forth that seed word he said you let it fall into a heart he said and then they start to pervert that word he said it in this word he said when it falls in like that he said he can make a good church member out of a doubter out of a skeptic out of an unbeliever he said but when you begin to tell him the word they'll never come in line with the word but don't let their hair grow they won't let let their lot be changed by the Word of God they never come to bear the image of Jesus Christ they cannot God can not have the kind of fellowship with them that he can with his children you understand what I'm talking about I love your children but there is a there is a different fellowship that I have with my children that I do with your children it ain't that I don't love them and then in then I don't love them at all but I have a different fellowship we said there are things that I'm able to intimately communicate with them there's things that they can ask me for is that right believe with the resources all of those things why there is a fellowship that is here because they are mine but instrumental hid no matter how much Holy Ghost comes on this rail he'll always be in his smell never able to come to the world but this smell takes the Holy Ghost and he uses the Holy Ghost as a benchmark to say what I've got speaking tongues and I do this and I do that and I do that and it does that without having a life that lives to the word oh my but thanks be to God there are sons of the promise there are daughters of the promise born of the Spirit of God in this hour that loves the Word of God that love his appearing amen children of God that are gain for this hour amen think of it how did God Himself to look in this hour you know to have fellowship fellowship also another on one meaning of the word fellowship is to be a partaker is that right to be a partaker the Bible tells us in Hebrews six there are those who have tasted of the good word of God but taken but never never a revelation never a change in her life never to wear that they they see this to be Jesus Christ revealed in this hour it's a truth friends but you see when that when that word has moved you don't got it you don't have to tell nobody it's a life that's lived this is where when the scripture declares of how the Lord Jesus here he is think of how the scripture says standing in the midst of his church declaring his name when God came in Redemption he didn't come as a woman I know that simple but God didn't come as a woman God came as a man right because it's a man that carries that of the life carries that of a father's name their rights he didn't come as a woman as a church but he came to redeem and bring his subjects to himself it had to be his life come forth to you and I without his life coming we are seeds that remain dead walking in this earth as dead men dead women a life to the world but dead to the things of God having no having no desire having no nothing with sin our life but that god himself had a desire and he's going to bring back he breeds back his own children you know sometimes you read about things and some of you no doubt follow things with on different pets and animals and things like that and they try to reestablish and get certain things back again they want maybe on a certain breed of dog or a certain cattle or what a more they're looking for certain characteristics they're looking back on something back there and they're trying to make selections of things out here to breed together so that they can somehow get this back here they're trying to take all kinds of parts to do that but God Himself in order to breed back it required him coming self his own life the bedding ground was here the bedding ground would be here in every age is that right for different types of ground that bedding ground would be here those seeds of God they would be here the bedding ground for the word to fall into and bring that into life it would be his life his water the water of the word passing over that sea and raising that seed up into life and then what does it do it brings forth a fellowship think of how the Prophet places it like this he says in the message invisible union of the Bride of Christ he said any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet you could not have fellowship yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but through the betting grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and becoming the image of your father then he could fellowship Levi walking around there in the loins of Abraham but Abraham couldn't have fellowship with him it was there but the only way fellowship could come is when it comes into expression so here as the seeds of God God remembered the desire for fellowship God sets it it makes an earth to take you and I honor and God places within our lives that seed it's already for known even listen the very design as David said in Psalms 139 my members yet being imperfect yet they were formed in thy book God knew that the stature the iconic God knew all of those things and God had everything set to even two generations on back that all of those things God orchestrating it all and here when you come up on this earth here God Himself deposits that seed when you drop from your mother's womb and the breath of life is taken there's that seed that real you that real me it's getting closer to time for expression it's not fully expressed but it's getting closer it's just like winner you know a young man young lady they're they're courting and then you know moving to engagement and then you know here into marriage and and it keeps they're moving closer to a time and then here when when there is a conception that takes place it's moving closer to a time of expression but the only way that it can be expressed is when that comes to birth and when that comes to birth which will always was there my brother Bram says as a 16 year old boy he says here I was he said Billy Paul was in me I didn't know it the difference is with God God knew it God knew just exactly what bed of time that you and I were going to come in we were fitted to that word and God's desire and longing just as a as a father and as a mother would be longing for their children to come into expression that they might fellowship with them and then think of this friends in the hour that we're living in you know there's a certain fellowship that you have when they come and they're newly born it's a fellowship of changing diapers it's a fellowship of burping getting up at night and all of those things it's a fellowship there's a bonding that's going on there's things that you cannot you know you're saying to them do you want this you want that they didn't understand that but they can hear your voice but it's like that to the mother they go to the mother and hearing the mother it's that heartbeat that's something that they knew in the womb and it's something that serves them and calms them and that's there it's a part of that time in their life there's a fellowship going on it's just not a fellowship of real great understanding but as time goes on the understanding increases the understanding increases there are responsibilities that's given at that time the Fellowship is increasing it's not no longer where you know things begin to change where it's no longer just do this and do that but there's a fellowship that's moving in where you're taking your sons or your son or your daughter and so forth you're saying yeah you're in being inclusive not demeaning but inclusive with them and really reaching out to to speak to them and to and to share within this in their life hi that's how God has been down through the ages there's been a nurturing and even within every one of our life there was a beginning and there is a beginning where there's a nourishing there's a need for the sincere milk of the word of God there is a beginning there's a nourishing all of those things are precious times of fellowship and I say it like this in this regards is that you know in times past I knew of individuals that would actually look at another brother or sister and they would deem them as not being spiritual because they couldn't remember certain quotes about the message or this or that and then they hand that about their life their friends that's that's not to credit the Spirit of God the spirit of God is to reach out it wants to create and bring forth that fellowship it's just like in your job if there's only people who can fellowship on salvation let's fellowship but there's a fellowship what does fellowship do you know yeah you don't increase things if you're not in the fellowship among us as believers brothers and sisters it's not altogether our words but it's our life we're a body of believers you know sometimes you have here you know you have the firstborn in the first part catching on different things and the other one maybe they're a little bit slower catching on you know why for the first point is doing everything for we know we can do everything for everybody but there is an image that is before that you also see when you have that of a firstborn going forth and those that come behind it there look and they begin to imitate those things they are seeing what is it it's influence from an image that said before and that's why it must be the image of Jesus Christ it's him walking in the midst of his church not not just standing he's walking in the midst of his church if he's walking that means he has a body to walk in they met he's moving through his church he declaring his name i am alpha i am omega what has he done he's breathing back sons and daughters again through the water of life the word going forth raising up the seeds of god that had been planted in that bed of time and what do they do express him in that hour the message itself what was print it's now flesh they say this to you there's not a printing press that can produce Christ in you there's not a man that can do that it's a sovereign work of God searching out us as his children and he moving by his Spirit brings forth the image of his own person inside of you and I there's a fellowship that's going on it's an intimate communion he's disclosing thoughts to you that to the rest of the world as the prophet called it flutters he cannot speak that way God's not interested in flirting he's interested in the depth of sincerity that's why this this this word this gospel it deserves every part of our life every part every part of us that fellowship what he has longed for what he's desired now it can become expressed within our lives the Prophet says so were you sons of God I'm closing sons and tons of God and daughters of God before there was even a moon stars or molecule you were sons and daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning there's only one form of eternal life and that was you that's not God is eternal you're a part of God you always had eternal life the Holy Spirit comes to let you know the person of eternal life comes to let you know yes you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your earthly father anybody remember when they were in their earthly father don't raise your hand we don't want to embarrass you you don't a matter of fact sometimes we could look back and what's the earliest memory you have Booth's am i remember when I was 1 year old let me go on read now neither did you know when you was in your earthly father but you are manifested - in his image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of God I want you to think about this here for a moment here is this little woman that we know so we you know we don't need we don't know her name all we know where's a woman at the will but here the Lord Jesus says I'm have must need to go by this way now I'm gonna tell you it's very clear when you look at the man who was remember on the road the Pharisees and different ones walked by him the religious of that day but the Samaritan came pick the guy up took him to the end remember that religion itself would have stayed so far away from that from that woman it did religion looked down on her because you know why religion couldn't help she didn't need religion she already had religion she knew about religion what she needed was the Living God she already had troubles and mess and all of the books that she'd got from the bookstore nothing delivered her you know how to how to have a successful marriage after 13 she didn't she didn't have that you understand that there was not power within the bookstore to give her that but what was what what was needed in her life was one visitation one moment one moment is all it took she come into the presence of the Living God and at that moment as the word began to talk to her none notice here she has eternal life the whole time as a seat of God that life is laying in there you understand what I'm talking about when brother Ram says this in multiple places the message the seat the life the germ of life is already there in the seed but it takes the quickening to release the germ that's there that's why the flow of the water the word is it passes over the sea it brings the seed for the rest of the dirt doesn't bother the rest of the dirt but it's intended for that seed so here she is standing there in that time and here the father is desiring he is seeking true worshipers why didn't he go up there to the temple they weren't true worshipers they were religious people but they weren't true worshipers but he was seeking such to worship him met with worship Him in spirit and in truth those who would be bought and could be born of the water in the spirit those who could receive the word for their day for their age for that hour could receive him one moment in his presence change the course of her life she never went back to the city and started self-help groups I hope y'all with me she never went back to the city and did that but she dropped her water puffs there was something greater than what daily and all the other things something had happened greater than all her plans something had taken place she received the answer she had been looking for she received the attention she had been craving well this was not loud that shot just to take advantage but this was allowed that sought to move and bring a change she went running into the city and began to say come see a man who told me all things no religion - it was a living witness of the Living God what had happened God said I have need to go by he was longing for fellowship and here he comes she comes into expression now there's fellowship see that seed he's dialoguing with that see it comes into expression and the prodigal son was away from home he went on his way he made his decision couldn't be couldn't have no fellowship that right couldn't have any fellowship but one day there was intercessory prayer that was being made the Prophet said there was a mother and father who were down in their living room and he said as they were praying the angel the Lord moved where that man was at he was at the lowest sometimes those things have to happen but the angel of the Lord came and whispered in his ear a prophet said it's time to come and he began to think in that right the scripture said he thought hey servants got it better than I have it here right there that moment in the midst of that Pigpen he made a decision and he made a decision to you the voice that was speaking to him that was calling him he didn't know how everything was going to be done but he yielded to that voice but God made away all that portrayal with the prodigal son God made away and here that young man comes back fellowship restored he was always a son but he couldn't be recognized as a son but now that he's come home his attitude is different everything is different his desire is I'll do whatever I'm not worthy to be called your son but the father said you can't change your name but beneath all of the month beneath all the gone there was that reality that was there all he needed was to get into the presence of his father changed everything they didn't have to bind him to the to the estate no no he's there to work to labor he's an expression of the father he's expressing the image of the father and this is why let's tan the Prophet says here we are sitting here as the children of God in this hour he said believing the Scriptures believing the message of the hour he says you're setting here present a vindication God moving and working in your life that life pulsating through you it's not something that we do not something that we have to make happen it's god it's sovereignly God moving and it's God overseeing it all for what fellowship a lot of things can try to come and stand in the way and get between that fellowship and hinder that but remember this is God's desire God does it he doesn't call us to be church members or that that that's miserable that's miserable that that gets old it's very miserable when things are just a duty it gets old I know some people can be very very very dedicated sometimes with things that even maybe you don't care about doing or like doing you can be dedicated but I'm talking about the love of God in our heart why why are we here why do we serve Him we serve Him because we love him why do we love him because he first it's the love of God in our hearts friends that's the real reality of the Holy Ghost moving in on that seed and quickening that seed it lets you know who you are there's a fellowship he communicates with you he tells you who you are he's strengthened you it's a fellowship all would he even long for now he's having that fellowship not with an infant but he's having it with his bride one who can understand things by his grace it's by his working you love him let's pray Heavenly Father more truly blessed fellowship your God that we have received Lord from you Lord we thank you what God held that your light moving across our
