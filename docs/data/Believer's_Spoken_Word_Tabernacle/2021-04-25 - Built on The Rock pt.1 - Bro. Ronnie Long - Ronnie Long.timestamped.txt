[27:39] love that of his family
[27:40] i love his stand for the word and it's
[27:43] his first time
[27:44] being here with us and we want you to
[27:46] feel at home
[27:48] we want him just to take his liberty and
[27:51] god'll just
[27:52] just come down and just take the gift
[27:54] and you realize that
[27:56] it's god coming to minister to our needs
[28:00] you have the control on the gift of god
[28:03] the man of god has studied and he's
[28:05] looked at things that god's put on his
[28:07] heart some things that you don't even
[28:08] have in his notes you don't even know
[28:10] why did i have this down why did i feel
[28:13] drawn this way
[28:15] but god had you and me in mind
[28:18] god's so mindful god is so mindful of
[28:20] every little detail he doesn't leave
[28:23] anything out so whatever your need is
[28:26] this morning
[28:27] know that god is mindful so we hear that
[28:30] but i want you to understand that god is
[28:32] mindful of your need this morning
[28:35] this service though i when i contacted
[28:37] brother romney some months ago
[28:39] to come and see if he'd be available god
[28:41] already knew this service would be here
[28:43] before the foundation of the world
[28:46] god knew we would still be here god knew
[28:48] that brother ronnie would be standing
[28:50] here
[28:51] and god know you and me would be sitting
[28:53] there
[28:54] and most importantly that he'd be right
[28:56] here in our midst
[28:58] god knew that so this is not a
[29:01] coincidence
[29:03] it's been arranged by god it says the
[29:06] prophet would
[29:06] just direct us and how god would teach
[29:08] him and how those things would be spoken
[29:10] to us to where whoever has to be sitting
[29:13] in that chair
[29:14] the glasses have to be right here this
[29:16] one has to be right here
[29:18] we don't have to try to get nobody into
[29:21] that place
[29:23] it's god in his sovereignty that
[29:25] orchestrates
[29:26] everything amen and i love that
[29:30] i love that that's a that's that's a
[29:32] real rest that we have in the lord
[29:35] so we just as we invite brother ronnie
[29:38] to come and just to take his liberty
[29:39] here this morning that the holy spirit

[41:17] thou hast searched me and knew
[41:20] thou knowest my doubt sitting in my
[41:22] uprising
[41:23] thou understandeth my thought afar off
[41:26] that passes my path and my lying down
[41:29] and art acquainted
[41:30] with all my ways for there is not a word
[41:33] in my tongue but o lord
[41:35] thou knowest that all together appears
[41:37] thou hast to set me behind and before
[41:41] and lay thy hand upon me such knowledge
[41:44] is too wonderful for me

[42:20] me even the night shall be light about
[42:22] me
[42:23] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[42:26] but the night shineth as the day
[42:28] the darkness and the light are both
[42:29] alike to thee
[42:31] for thou hast possessed my reigns thou
[42:34] has covered me in my mother's womb

[42:44] soul knoweth right well
[42:45] in the uh amplified there that fearfully
[42:48] and wonderfully
[42:49] translate to to intricately
[42:53] my substance was not hit from thee when
[42:55] i was made in secret and curiously rod
[42:58] in the lowest parts of the earth
[42:59] thine eyes did see my substance
[43:03] yet being unperfect and in thy book all
[43:06] my members were written
[43:07] which in continuance were fashioned when
[43:09] as yet
[43:10] there was none of them how precious also
[43:13] are thy thoughts unto me o god
[43:15] how great is the sum of them if i should
[43:18] count them
[43:19] they are more in number than the sand
[43:21] when i awake
[43:22] i am still with thee amen may we just
[43:25] bow our heads
[43:27] jesus we love you lord father we just

[43:46] of the way lord just let us open our
[43:48] hearts to you
[43:49] father lord even you even now father in
[43:52] our trials and our moments father lord

[44:06] your servant father this morning god may
[44:08] your word just come forth lord with
[44:10] power and demonstration lord as jews
[44:12] orchestrated it before the foundation of
[44:14] the world
[44:14] father lord there are trials that walked
[44:17] in this door father but there's a
[44:19] there's an answer dwelling already in
[44:20] the building father lord we just look to
[44:22] you
[44:23] as the author and the finisher this
[44:25] morning god
[44:26] we pray in your name jesus christ amen
[44:29] you may be seated
[44:30] amen brother samuel already set me up
[44:34] he just kind of took my intro there but
[44:36] we weren't here by chance
[44:39] we're not here just because there's
[44:40] nowhere else to be but god has already
[44:42] ordained this
[44:43] i mean down to the color of the shirt
[44:45] and the color of the tie and
[44:46] yes and uh and even even through through
[44:50] you know we never would have thought you
[44:51] know a couple years ago we'd be sitting
[44:52] in a brother shane god bless you
[44:54] with the masks on you know we never
[44:56] would have thought that a couple years
[44:57] ago but
[44:58] here we are but god saw it's not a
[45:00] surprise to god and
[45:01] he saw us here in this situation and in
[45:03] this time and
[45:04] everything is perfectly in place but
[45:07] it's all according to god's plan
[45:09] and it's a setup all right come on now
[45:12] it's just a big setup and we think we're
[45:15] just walking through this life
[45:16] and we're just going ahead with the
[45:18] without we're just pushing through with
[45:19] our troubles and our styles but
[45:21] but i just want to tell the devil
[45:23] something this morning it's a setup
[45:26] you maybe walked in here thinking you
[45:28] had the upper hand on somebody but it
[45:29] was all a setup
[45:31] from the time that you started with that
[45:32] cancer and the time that you started
[45:34] with that depression
[45:35] it was just a setup for a moment in time
[45:38] where you could be defeated where
[45:39] where that devil would be defeated where
[45:41] that devil would be put in its place it
[45:43] was all just a setup
[45:44] according to the timing of god and i
[45:46] believe we're walking in perfect time
[45:48] with god's word there's nothing out of
[45:50] place and nothing out of cater nothing
[45:52] out of step
[45:52] for his words perfect amen and
[45:54] everything he does is perfect and
[45:56] there's a season
[45:57] and a time for everything there's a time
[45:59] for a cleansing but there's also a time
[46:01] for action i believe we're
[46:03] we're in a in a time and in an age where
[46:06] we are doing things that nobody else has
[46:08] ever been required to do before much
[46:09] like mary where
[46:10] where she was to bring forth a promised
[46:12] word when there had been women of old
[46:15] age bring forth and sarah had been
[46:17] had brought forth and hannah had brought
[46:18] forth but mary was required to do
[46:20] something that nobody else had ever done
[46:22] and it was bring forth the promised word
[46:24] i believe that's us this morning
[46:26] we are going to manifest the promised
[46:28] word of this hour
[46:29] and we're not just here with with our
[46:31] own inabilities by chance but god
[46:33] has intricately made us that way he
[46:36] crafted us that way with our
[46:38] with our inconsistencies and our own
[46:40] failures and our own
[46:42] faults but yet he made us that way so
[46:44] his strength could be made perfect
[46:46] through our weaknesses amen and i
[46:48] believe that we all have one thing in
[46:50] common and that's we're all too weak to
[46:52] get it done
[46:53] but god who is rich in mercy have placed
[46:56] within
[46:56] us that overcoming power and it's
[46:59] already
[47:00] laying within the church the prophet of
[47:01] god said that that everything that we
[47:03] have need of your healing
[47:05] you're rapturing faith your overcoming
[47:07] power is
[47:08] already laying within you yeah i think
[47:10] my if we could just realize
[47:12] what is already what we already possess
[47:16] abraham was told you're the possessor of
[47:18] all things
[47:19] it was already in abraham he just needed
[47:21] the revelation to know
[47:22] he's talking about me brother he's
[47:25] talking about me if you can just put
[47:26] your name in that scripture
[47:28] he's talking about i am the possessor of
[47:31] all things
[47:32] just think about an infinite god with
[47:34] infinite capabilities he can create a
[47:36] molecule he can create a speck he can
[47:39] create
[47:39] whatever he wants the earth we're
[47:41] standing on the air we're breathing
[47:42] and yet maybe he missed it with you no
[47:46] i don't think so not not my god but he
[47:47] made you exactly the way you
[47:49] are to fulfill an exact purpose in this
[47:52] hour
[47:53] and there's nobody nobody that can take
[47:56] your place
[47:58] you might think that your neighbor might
[47:59] be more qualified or your pastor might
[48:01] be more qualified but there's nobody
[48:04] that can fill your shoes there's nobody
[48:06] that can have your testimony
[48:08] and god is just looking for a
[48:10] surrendered somebody
[48:11] to make his will come forth he just
[48:13] needs a body that will say here am i
[48:16] send me lord i'm not worthy woe is me
[48:19] i'm a man of unclean lips i don't
[48:20] deserve it i didn't i didn't earn it
[48:23] but here in my lord let me be a living
[48:25] epistle written in red of all men filled
[48:27] with the holy ghost and power
[48:29] living this word to make it manifest in
[48:31] this hour
[48:32] he made each of us perfectly
[48:35] just perfectly we look at ourselves in
[48:37] the mirror and
[48:38] my goodness isn't there things we would
[48:41] change if it were up to us
[48:44] oh man then we start we get into our
[48:46] personalities oh man
[48:50] but god didn't make him
