I just want to say it is so good to be together and um we just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer. Amen. I wonder as our heads are bowed. No doubt there's I know there's many requests, but maybe individually it would say, "Lord, you know, you know my need, Lord." And just with an uplifted hand, Lord, [music] just speak to my heart this morning, Lord. I I need to hear from you. I didn't come to hear a man. I come to hear from you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. My hand is up with you, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Without you, we can do nothing. &gt;&gt; When you brought Zachchariah to that place, Lord, and he looked upon that candlesticks, oh God, and you spoke to him and he said it was as a man who was awakened out of sleep. He wasn't asleep, but yet you brought him Lord into a place, oh God, even by vision to speak to him. &gt;&gt; And you asked [music] Lord of Him, what what do you see? And oh God, as a real servant of God, he said, "Thou knowest." And Lord, when you spoke to him, when he looked upon that, you said, "Not by might, nor by power, &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh God, this mountain shall be removed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, I'm asking for your grace just to continue to move, Lord, in among us this morning. May we too, Lord, as your servants, oh God, be as it were, may be awakened, Lord. May our eyes be so anointed, Lord. Not as though that we don't see, but we want to see you more clearly, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's needs upon hearts. There's desires. And we need to hear from you. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we need you to speak to us. So, we're asking, oh God, Lord, we have nothing to say to you or to tell you as to instruct you, but we do want you to know we love you. We appreciate you. And Lord, we're asking that you would come and speak to our hearts this morning. Minister to our lives, Lord. Help us, Lord, as we have praying, Lord, for one another. May you come, Lord God, specially to every need, Lord. You're no respector of persons, Lord. &gt;&gt; We could never merit &gt;&gt; your righteousness. We could never earn it, Lord. We could never even merit, Lord, you even coming and speaking to our hearts. So we stand here, Lord, this morning just to look to you in your sovereign grace and say, "Oh God, move upon my heart, Lord. Let my will, let all that is within me, Lord, let it just be so melted, Lord, in your presence, oh God, that you might, Lord Jesus, do and bring forth from us of your own life, Lord. We pray. &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you this morning. in the precious name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. If we could here this morning, I want to go to a passage of scripture in Psalms. And uh I want to say I heard that I got to see Josh as I was walking by back there. So it's good to have him here with us. And um [clears throat] I want to just uh read here this this portion of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats. The scripture says, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, and though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, sailor, why won't we fear? Because God is our refuge &gt;&gt; and strength, a very present help in the time of trouble. Verse four, there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the most holy of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her. And that right early. One more scripture before we're seated. And you don't have to turn here. We'll just read it from the screen. And here is John seeing this future home, the new city. And he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal. proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to speak on this thought here this morning. There is a river. You know, Brother Brandham when he would go to dedicate the tabernacle there in Jeffersonville in the message, God hiding and revealing himself in simplicity. And it was the dedication where they had added on to the tabernacle. And then they it was the preparation then and uh how everything had went to make that reconstruction. And so they came to rededicate that that temple. And you know, brother Brandham makes some statements within there that he looks back on that of how that God had led him to that place to build that tabernacle. As a matter of fact, he said of how that many of the people it was during the time of the depression and what a that in itself you could speak that's a paradox how that during the time of such a an economic downturn but yet a tabernacle was built. Brother Brandham even told us of the sacrifices that went into that where he said even there were mothers that allowanced their children at the table in order to be able to support that work. And so what you find is I would not say that that in itself is anything that's easy, but I think what we draw from there is where you find that there were hearts that God had placed a burden in their heart to have a place where God could come and visit with his people and where that they could come and to bring their families. God had called them out from many different walks of life and places where they had been and brother Brandham lays that remember he lays the cornerstone and when you uh hear how brother Brandham tells of it of how that that particular place was it's kind of hard to visualize it when you're standing there I've stood there each time mostly every time I go to Jeffersonville I always go into those areas for me a lot of times um when we're there I get out early of a morning and I go find somewhere to pray. I do that where I'm mostly anywhere I'm ministering. I get out early and I'll go pray somewhere, but there there's many places and like I told I told others there, I said, I don't care what you say about me. I said, but these these are special places to me. And so, I'll get out there and I'll go up to the mill where I can see that will where I don't know somewhere over there brother Brandham's cave is. And then I'll go and sometimes sit down right in front of Spring Street where the angel of the Lord came down and and just talk to the Lord and then we'll always as a family go by um where brother Brandham was buried and it's just you know you're thankful. Um I think of how that brother Ray was the one who showed me where Finny uh and then from there I've taken other brothers by there and you know you go by those places even where Finny out in um uh Oberlin and you know you'll pray and thank God for for men of God like that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would do that. As a matter of fact, Brother Brandham even stood out stood in front of um Amy Simple McFersonson's tombstone and thank God for her life. So you know I look at this within here how the prophet would you can see that there were many things that was said regarding this tabernacle. Many said brother Bam will pick it up in a another message where many had said it would be turned into a garage in just a little bit of time. And you see when you're looking at it, you know, that's all men could see. Here you're taking I'm going to raise up a tabernacle in a place that is not fit to even build because it was a pond. It was a it was a place that what what what could come out of here? I mean, why would you choose this place? And yet then the prophet will go on to tell us of how that even when there was a fire that they were really unaware that but it was because of the way the stove and the pipe going up in there and when they were doing the uh renovations in the tabernacle there they were able to look into the rafters and um able to see how the the burn marks and brother Brandham you know how he says it on tape he says why it didn't burn down he said only God knows &gt;&gt; then he speaks about how the flood came and how that you know the the podium that they had there and that flood itself and where it came you know and then the podium it sat back down after the flood you know had had you know receded back to its banks and the Bible was still open to the same place &gt;&gt; to me when we look at little things and you can see and hear in brother Brandham's voice because not only does it it's it's means something when he can witness witness and others can witness that what God has put within the heart that no man can take that out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God has given in his word, God will watch over his word. &gt;&gt; And there's many things that try to completely destroy that little tabernacle. And you know, I want to just say this to you. Don't just leave that as a brickandmortar building. But I want you to see that in your life and my life of how that the enemy would like nothing more and has made attempt after attempt to try to destroy a tabernacle of God. &gt;&gt; And remember, I didn't say thee, but I said a tabernacle of God because you are a tabernacle &gt;&gt; of the living God. Paul said that know you not your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost. And you know when we consider this and look at the tabernacle itself and how that when brother Bana would go through this dedication and he would speak of how that he said, you know, in reference to that of Revelations 21 where John saw that of the new city coming down and and he saw John saw all of the all the glorious attributes all that's being described and even of the temple and how that you know there is not of building that's made of of hands. But you know, it is that where it's described of the Lord God and the Lamb as the temple. And so, Brother Brandon will pick this up and he'll say it in this way. He said, "These little places like David, he had David could not build the true tabernacle of God because he wasn't prepared to do it. There was nothing he could do. He was mortal and had shed blood. And so it is today to us. We are not prepared to build the true tabernacle of God. There's only one can do that and it's being in construction now. He says, "But this little tabernacle." Now he brings the attention to the dwelling place there on 8th and Penn Street along with the temple that Solomon built and along with the others such as this right here are only temporary places of worship until the time comes when the real tabernacle will be set up on the earth &gt;&gt; and righteousness shall reign from sky to sky. There'll be no more sorrow. He refers to the scripture. There'll be no funerals preached in that tabernacle. &gt;&gt; There will be no more weddings for the wedding will be one great wedding for eternity. What a time &gt;&gt; that will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let us purpose in our heart today. He said that in commemoration and waiting for that tabernacle to come that we will so characterize ourself by his spirit that we will worship in this place as if we were in that other place waiting for that place to come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that we will so characterize ourself by his spirit and that's what God has given what God promised and he's given is the Holy Spirit to lead the church of the living God. So I want to come into this into this thought on there is a river because here we are we are in uh what the prophet called a temporary place and I want you to also see very clearly that the that the body that you are dwelling in is also a temporary dwelling &gt;&gt; but in that temporary dwelling is to be a memorial of how God has brought you out what he's done in your life and it's also will witness that he's got he has a place prepared for you. Not just this city, but you have a body reserved in the heavens. &gt;&gt; One that's not made with hands, but here these are just temporary &gt;&gt; dwellings. &gt;&gt; And so in these temporary dwellings, let us so characterize our lives even here in our lives and how we are here. Even not only in here but how we in in our life and in our walk. Let it be so characterized by his spirit. Notice not by our our uh efforts or our strivings but by his spirit as he will lead us and guide us and shape us and mold us to where our lives reflect that oncoming city. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because remember when John saw it, it is as a bride that is prepared &gt;&gt; and adorned for her husband. Let me just read just a few other scriptures because when we take from this here there is a river and I want you just to look at a few scriptures here within in in the Bible. many scriptures we could read from. But look, let's just fellowship around these around these principles. For it says, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, singular, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. And so looking at this here, rivers of one water in Psalm 78:16, speaking of God's faithfulness there when they were in journey out of Egypt to the promised land, he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers. I want to remind you here this scripture, this rock, you and I would not choose a rock or think of a rock as a likely place to find water &gt;&gt; because a rock is the driest thing there would be. &gt;&gt; But yet God making himself known that he is the supply of all we have need of. He alone as David said is my rock. &gt;&gt; He alone is my rock. And out of that rock, speaking of Christ himself, would come forth the waters that would be needed to sustain you and I in our earthly journey. How sweet and how precious is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. That God himself and that what would be looked upon to be maybe the most unlikely source, but it is the very source of our strength, the source of our life. And God has revealed himself. He has brought streams also out of that rock. Not just one little trickle, but there are streams out of that rock and cause waters to run down like rivers. In Isaiah 32, behold, a king shall reign in righteousness. Princes shall rule in judgment, and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Notice rivers of water in a dry place. Jesus said in John 7:37, "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink, he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Isaiah 12 and verse two, behold, God is my salvation. I will trust and not be afraid. For the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song. He also is become my salvation. &gt;&gt; Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. In Jeremiah 2:13, for my people have committed two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them outnists that can hold no water. Notice the fountain of living waters. In Zechariah 13:1, in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness. So over and over just within these little portions of scripture as as as was in our text, you find that there is one river with many streams. There is one fountain with with many streams or avenues that it flows. And I want to just say it as Jesus said in John 17 or John 7 where we read from that scripture there when he when he said in in the word if that great day of the feast that's the feast of tabernacles temporary dwelling places that if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. So understanding that within all of this as we're looking at here that it is one river with many streams and when you bring that on down the prophet would bring it down in this manner and talk about even with Kadesh Barnea and how Kadesh Barnea being that place of many springs and brother Brandham types that has that there is one main water source and that is that water source that comes from the presence of God. But God has many local springs where they are fed from that water source. That that's why we we don't want any other water source. We just want the water source that comes from him. &gt;&gt; Because the water source that comes from him is a living water. &gt;&gt; It's a flowing water. It is fit to take care of whatever the need might be. it it's able to direct us and to expose the enemy at all his attempted discrediting and trying to destroy and break confidence in God's word in the presence of this great fountain. Not only is sin and uncleanliness dismissed and lives are changed, but how Satan is brought from undercover. He's exposed and God brings forth a real liberty and there is a real joy that is to be present within the tabernacles of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, I want to pull upon a quote that I used last week and um here I want to begin to read from this and draw a little bit more. And brother Bram says, "A communion with the Lord is like an oasis in a desert. It's like the spring underneath the pond. &gt;&gt; You see, it's got to have a a source that's providing it. &gt;&gt; You all have drove and been around places that do not have a feeding source, a supply source, and they have to continue to keep that going. They'll have um uh those water fountains, you know, it's bubbling up. that's trying to in their treatments and everything. But if it's got a living supply source, you don't have to worry about stagnation &gt;&gt; because that living source sees to it that it's a moving water. And where there's moving water, wiggle tails can't exist. Where there's moving water, uh critters aren't welcome. They they can't survive there because the cleanliness WILL KILL IT. BACTERIA CANNOT survive where there is cleanliness. And and that's why that in all of those scriptures that I read, HE IS THAT FOUNTAIN that's open to us. &gt;&gt; He is that river. He is that source. He is our life. HE IS THE FOUNTAIN of living water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is what is supplying. IT'S NOT US SUPPLYING. HE IS our supply. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's like the spring underneath the pond where the traveler comes by, stops, drinks the water till he quenches his thirst. That's remembering the Lord, coming by the order of his table where the passing pilgrim that's sojouring here on earth with us together. that we can come by his table and there drink of his blessings and of his grace and of his word in fellowship around his word until our thirsty souls are satisfied. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Bam is only bringing the type when we take communion here of what it is to come to the house of God that here we gather together and drink of his blessings, of his grace, of his word in fellowship AROUND HIS WORD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT IS NOT ABOUT WHO IS WORTHY and who is unworthy. AS YOU DRINK ON THE WORD AND FROM THE FOUNTAIN, IT IS THE FOUNTAIN THAT HAS MADE YOU WORTHY. AND AS YOU TAKE OF THE FOUNTAIN, IT WILL CONTINUE [screaming] TO MAKE YOU WORTHY. AND THIS FOUNTAIN WILL TAKE AWAY SIN AND UNBELIEF FROM YOUR LIFE. THAT'S [screaming] THE POWER &gt;&gt; OF THIS FOUNTAIN. [applause] &gt;&gt; Can I just share SOMETHING WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; BROTHER RANDOM TALKS ABOUT HOW HE SAW A MAN. He said there was, he said, here he was. He said, "I knew this man real well." And he said, "But you know, he had a problem with smoking cigarettes." And he said, 'I WENT DOWN TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GIVING HIS LIFE TO THE LORD. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE BROTHER BRAM had a relationship with him. And he said, 'Well, brother Brandham, and you know, God was dealing with the man's life. HE SAID, "BUT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE I GOT THESE CIGARETTES." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "QUIT LOOKING at them cigarettes." &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, DO YOU REALLY mean that IF I IF I'LL JUST ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOU MEAN THAT THAT GOD GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT?" HE SAID, "YES." HE SAID, "BUT BROTHER BHAM, THESE CIGARETTES." AND BROTHER BAM SAYS, "THERE YOU GO AGAIN WITH THEM CIGARETTES." &gt;&gt; NOW, let me TELL YOU, YOU CAN PUT WHATEVER IT is in your life. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE COMING TO THE PROMISED LAND OR YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE PROMISED LAND. The the the the the CURE TO IT ALL IS THE SAME. HE THE PROPHET SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL JUST COME AND TAKE OF THIS FOUNTAIN, IT WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT IN YOUR LIFE." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM BAPTIZED HIM IN THE NAME OF the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; STILL SMOKING AND EVERYTHING. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I KNOW." HE SAID, "I GOT A LOT OF THE FAMILY THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT upset with me. Thought I was doing wrong." But brother said, "I knew what I WAS DOING. WHAT WAS IT?" YOU KNOW, YOU IF YOU GET IT BACKWARDS IF YOU TRY TO CLEAN YOURSELF UP FIRST. YOU CAN'T CLEAN YOURSELF UP OUTSIDE OF THIS FOUNTAIN. THIS FOUNTAIN WAS OPEN FOR YOU. AS A MATTER OF FACT, [screaming] THIS FOUNTAIN CAME DOWN FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD CLEANSE SIN. OH, THE THE BLOOD COULD, YOU KNOW, THAT GOD GAVE THROUGH SHADOWS AND TYPES. IT COULD COVER, BUT HE CAN NEVER REALLY DEAL WITH THE UNBELIEF. BUT THIS FOUNTAIN, &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE VERY PERSON OF LIFE HIMSELF CAME [screaming] DOWN AND BECOME ONE OF US. HE WENT THROUGH LIFE. HE EXPERIENCED IT AS A TEENAGER. HE EXPERIENCED EVERY PART OF LIFE SO THAT HE MIGHT BE A FAITHFUL AND MERCIFUL HIGH PRIEST &gt;&gt; for you and for me. &gt;&gt; And he became the fountain open &gt;&gt; for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Drink until our thirsty souls are satisfied. And then when we leave the place of worship, refreshed, satisfied, &gt;&gt; going out to meet the desert's problems again, the problems of life's desert, that's life &gt;&gt; is a desert, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of dry places. You see, when when as God begins to deal and move within a person's heart, things change within their lives. Just as we were working with the young people there on Friday night, associations begin to change in your life because there is a call that has come upon your life from God and their faith is building in your life. And it's not something that you're quitting. THERE'S THINGS. IT'S HIM AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM THAT'S even affecting your choices in life. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; WHO'S DOING THAT? HE IS. YES. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE MAKE YOU THINK IT'S YOU THAT'S STOPPING IT. [applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT YOU. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE DECISION YOU'RE MAKING IS NOT [screaming] IS ABOUT WHAT GOD is moving AND DOING IN YOUR LIFE. SO WHEN WE WE COME TO THIS PLACE HOW GOD IS EVEN drawing upon our lives AND DRAWING UPON OUR HEARTS, YOU COME TO A PLACE THAT I YOU KNOW EVEN AS GOD IS DEALING WITH THE LIFE, HE BEGINS TO REMOVE ANY SATISFACTION THAT YOU FIND OUT THERE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT'S REMOVING THAT IS THE FOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT REMOVED IT FROM THAT MAN WHO WAS SMOKING CIGARETTES? THE FOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; HE JUST KEPT DRINKING FROM THE FOUNTAIN. LET ME TELL YOU, THE FOUNTAIN WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU YOU HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE PROBLEMS IF THERE'S ANYTHING ANY PLACE AND WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. BUT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE FOUNTAIN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD OR WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS. LISTEN, WE ARE STILL MORTALS, BUT [screaming] WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE FOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] IF NOT FOR GRACE, WHERE WOULD I be? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND TO COME BECAUSE OUT THERE IT'S DESERT. YOU START FINDING WHAT MAYBE AT TIMES WAS YOUR REFRESHMENT AND YOUR JOY AND WHAT YEAR WAS YOUR GO-TO for when you got down and and go to here and go to this and and maybe AND AND THEN THINGS CHANGE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING? THOSE THINGS NO LONGER HOLD THAT SATISFACTION AND THAT JOY AND THAT REFRESHING TO [screaming] YOUR LIFE. AND GOD WILL EVEN ALLOW YOU TO TEST THOSE WATERS. AND WHAT YOU FIND THOSE ARE [screaming] NOT ANY ANY OASIS. Those are mirages. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD BEGINS TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN THAT I AM YOUR ALL SUFFICIENCY. &gt;&gt; I am your oasis. &gt;&gt; And he gives us the strength we need here to face life's desert [snorts] problems. So he is &gt;&gt; our oasis. &gt;&gt; Now the scripture that we read from our text, it said there is a river where the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her. And that right early I I didn't forget a slide. I just don't I'm not going to put no more up after this. I just want to go. There is a river &gt;&gt; where the streams thereof do what? Make the city make glad the city of God. Now this glad it's coming from a true resource. So it ma it brings true gladness. Now remember I want you to think about this. You know, you could find this in the scripture and many times, you know, we quote it and we quote it in different in different ways, but you know, the Bible tells us that that happy is that people whose God is the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham would go over and and and and work through many places and speak of how that God intended and wants us to be happy. And he says,"I believe he wants us to be happy. And I believe we could also, he said, run it to extremes and just get insincere about it. But I believe that God wants his people to be real happy and sociable, friendly from our hearts, loving each other as God for Christ's sake or Christ loved us." I THINK THAT'S WHY we ought to be happy Christians &gt;&gt; IS BECAUSE WHY? NOT it really it don't have anything to do with everything of life that's going on around us because let me just say it to you like this there are seasons Peter describes that we are in heaviness &gt;&gt; right BUT BEFORE HE STARTS THAT SCRIPTURE THERE'S THREE words that he says before that scripture he says and he's referring to that lively hope we've been begotten unto a great expectation there is a body reserved in the heavens And our faith IS IN GOD. BY him who hath raised from the dead. HE'S RAISED US UP. BY HIM DO WE REJOICE GREATLY. BUT IF NEED be are in heaviness for a season. &gt;&gt; Now the heaviness for the season, the pressure it comes around. that weighs upon, you know, uh, whether the body or the spirit because anytime there's things that are going on within a trial, I I want to just say this to you that the joy of the Lord that has been deposited in our soul, THE WORLD DIDN'T give it and the world can't take it away. &gt;&gt; Uh, the NASDAQ didn't give it and the NASDAQ can't take it away. Are you WITH ME? THE JOB DIDN'T GIVE IT AND THE JOB CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY. THIS IS A JOY &gt;&gt; AND THAT JOY HAS BEEN DEPOSITED IN THIS temporary dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN NEHEMIAH SPOKE TO THEM AND THEY THE THE THE BOOK became open and they were standing the Bible says on the pullpit and he be to read AND AND AND CAUSE understanding to come to the people. THE PEOPLE BE TO HEAR what was being read and they begin to weep. AND THERE WAS A PART OF THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DESERVING OF THE grace that has come to us. BUT TO BE FOCUSED ON THE VOICE THAT THEN STEPS FORWARD and says, "WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT SEASON. You're in a season you you are weeping but you've got the wrong reaction or you've got the right reaction but in the wrong season." AND HE LET THEM KNOW YOU THIS IS IN this is in the SEASON OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES. &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME OF MEMORIAL. IT'S A TIME AND THIS IS WHERE THE SCRIPTURE THAT WE TALK ABOUT QUITE OFTEN. THE JOY OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH. THAT'S WHERE THAT SCRIPTURE COMES FROM. BECAUSE THE RIGHT RESPONSE IN THAT FEAST WAS TO BE JOYFUL, WAS [screaming] TO WORSHIP, WAS TO GIVE HONOR TO GOD FROM WHERE HE HAS BROUGHT YOU FROM. SURE, WE [screaming] DON'T DESERVE IT. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S HIS GRACE THAT HAS GIVEN IT TO US. BUT WE ARE TO REJOICE. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A MESSAGE OF CONDEMNATION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO LIBERATE SONS AND [screaming] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO DRIVE BACK THE DARKNESS. [cheering] THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO LOOSEN PRISONERS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, AS IT SAYS IN ISAIAH, HE SHALL SAY UNTO UNTO HIS PRISONERS, "BE FREE." &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD THAT IS BRINGING A LOOSENING. &gt;&gt; One of these moments, it'll be the final loosening. [sighs] &gt;&gt; That's why we ought to be happy Christians. And yet we find that when you look at an oasis like this and water supply, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A river. I have videos that have come in even now from brother Keith Reed and others from there in Jamaica, other brothers and their churches, their buildings, [clears throat] some of the homes are completely gone and so forth. I mean, you you've seen no doubt the devastation, but the point is is that you can find a source of source of water and a supply like this in my out in the middle of a desert. Man, that's a refreshing place. All you can think about, if I could just get there, if I can just get there, I'll be refreshed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Same way with that of the river is looking at that. If I can just get to that river, you begin to hear the sounds of that river. But you know the one thing that is so uh very crucial within it is that you know uh I for I think a brother a brother was sharing this when we were there together at the the men's meeting and I had no idea none of this was before me at that time whatsoever and really this all didn't drop until early Monday morning but the brother was talking about how that on one of their pieces of property he was out with the brother on his piece the property and they had a they had a spring that was fed from it was it was fed or or a a source of water, a pond that was actually fed by a real source. But what had happened is there had been a lot of things that had started to just build up. You know, it starts to old tires, &gt;&gt; 2x4s, things just start building up and building up and building up until eventually you look at that source as he described it. Nobody would want to drink from it. Yet, IT IT IT HAS WITHIN IT THAT SUPPLY SOURCE to where it's ABLE TO CLEAR OUT ALL THOSE THINGS. YOU SEE, WHAT WAS ALLOWING EVEN things to build up was because the things that was PUT IN IT. NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE WATER SUPPLY. &gt;&gt; THE WATER SUPPLY WAS STILL PUTTING OUT WATER, BUT IT'S WHAT HAD BE TO ACCUMULATE. WE COULD CALL IT DEBRIS BUILDUP over time. WHAT BECAME JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST A, YOU KNOW, A LAWNMOWER TIRE. WELL, eventually led to tractor tires, eventually led to, you know, to wood beams, eventually led TO OTHER THINGS TO WHERE LOOKING UPON IT, IT'S NOT APPEALING. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT YOU WANT TO DRINK FROM BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AROUND THERE, BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SOURCE THAT WAS ACTUALLY BENEATH. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE BRETHREN HAD to do? The brother talked about it. He said WHAT THEY DID? THEY GOT TOGETHER, you know, A TRACTOR AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THEY GOT ALL OF THE [screaming] STUFF THAT WAS IN THERE AND PULLED IT OUT. &gt;&gt; G. AND WITHIN JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, A COUPLE HOURS, THEY COULD TAKE THEIR A CUP AND GO DOWN IN THERE AND DRINK THAT WATER. WHY? BECAUSE THE SOURCE WAS STILL [screaming] GOOD. &gt;&gt; THEY JUST HAD TO GET THE THINGS OUT OF IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU AND I HERE THIS MORNING THAT THERE IS A RIVER &gt;&gt; WHERE THE STREAMS THEREOF MAKE GLAD THE CITY of God. BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE ALWAYS WE THERE HAS TO BE A MAINTAINING OF THAT OASIS. YOU GOT TO WATCH OVER WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STREAMS AND SO FORTH. ANYBODY THAT HAS PROPERTY WITH A STREAM GOING THROUGH IT OR WHATEVER, you know, I've I love water. To me, I love hearing water. There's nothing to me. There's not I like pictures of water. I like to relax listening water. But, you know, I ALSO KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, EVEN UPON YOUR PROPERTY, you are obligated to maintain that. EVEN IF IT JUST FLOWS AND YOUR PROPERTY IS no more than this building and it flows from THIS CORNER TO THAT CORNER, you are responsible for that flow. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT FLOW OF WATER IS NOT SOMETHING that is licensed or owned by you. &gt;&gt; It's on that land, but you've got to maintain it. &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THIS RIGHT HERE. WE DON'T OWN THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; NO MAN HAS A COPYRIGHT ON THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. THAT IS GOD. AND IT'S NOT UP TO ANY MAN TO DETERMINE WHO RECEIVES THE HOLY GHOST. IT IS GOD HIMSELF WHO IS THE FOUNTAIN, THE HOLY SPIRIT HIMSELF THAT gives of his own life. &gt;&gt; And I want to say that we look at it in many times that the source of supply, it's still operating, still good, but at times it becomes unappealable and undrinkable. Not the Lord, &gt;&gt; but sometimes the place where it's supposed to be refreshing &gt;&gt; place we're supposed to come to the house of God. If we're not careful, it can lose its appeal. &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO RESTORE that cleaning out the debris? &gt;&gt; All right. SO, NOT JUST PUSH the debris on in it. No, IT'S GOT TO BE IT'S GOT TO BE PULLED OUT OF THERE. IT'S GOT TO BE CLEANED OUT THERE THERE BECAUSE THERE IS A POWER of restoration to bring refreshments from wounds, &gt;&gt; weariness and misunderstandings. Because when brother Brandham, remember these three words THAT I POINTED OUT LAST WEEK, THESE ARE THE three words that the prophet took when he spoke OF THIS OASIS BOTH TIMES THAT HE preached remembering the Lord and he spoke about coming together to worship that what it meant for the oasis TO BE PRESENT AND HOW THAT WITHIN THAT OASIS THAT SPRING COMING UP WAS A SPRING TO MINISTER to the wounded. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. and the wounded as we looked at that that wounds itself my wounds can be deep and Jesus said I've been wounded in the house of my friends &gt;&gt; but I want you to notice this right here Jesus himself remember he's going to be what we read the fountain open in the house of David &gt;&gt; to them to the house of David in Jerusalem he's the very one is saying WHEN THEY'LL ASK HIM WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE WOUNDS IN THE HOUSE OF MY FRIENDS BUT NOTICE WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED and What has TAKEN PLACE IS THERE is a healing and a healing that will come to Israel. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's nobody that can heal wounds like Jesus. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN HEAL WOUNDS LIKE JESUS. And and YOU KNOW WHAT? WOUNDS ARE ALL AROUND. BUT THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO SAY, GOD, I'VE NOT COME TO FELLOWSHIP ABOUT MY WOUNDS. NEITHER HAVE I COME TO IGNORE THEM. BUT I'VE COME TO SUBMIT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT THE WOUND MIGHT BE CLEARED OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WOUND MIGHT BE CLEARED OUT AND THAT HE MIGHT MINISTER TO THE WOUNDS IN OUR LIFE AND BRING REFRESHMENT in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Misunderstanding. That's another one the prophet said that would would be present, you know, misunderstandings that were there. And he brought up Hagar and everything. How there's weariness for the weary traveler. And as I said, there's many times we get weary. We get weary as like the Bible said in welloing, &gt;&gt; right? And I forget one time that you know the doctors they uh I was just I think 13 or 14 years old. It comes to my mind and when my parents they took me there and there's an old country doctor down there in Rockford and they took took me in there and I just couldn't figure out because it seemed like that well I mean really can't pinpoint exactly what's what what's going on and it just was a sickness but they really couldn't pinpoint it you know and you said well brother Sammy that was the enemy. That's true. But let me let me also deal let me deal with something here that that the man he he pointed out doc the doctor did and he told my parents he pulled him aside. He said what it is he said it's the stress of just daytoday life of keeping you know and every one of us are made different but it's the routines and you know getting this done for school and this has to be done and this it was just the the buildup of the stress of life. Now as far as I know I never experienced that anymore. I can't say I hadn't experienced rest, [laughter] but I will say it like this and never left me because I thought, my goodness, what a what a thing to say, you know, because you're thinking, YOU KNOW, HOW do I GET HOW DO I get free of this or how do I get rid of this? And and you know, the doctors are wanting to to help out. And I want to say it like this that they're we we CAN BECOME WEARY, NOT JUST FROM TRIALS, NOT JUST FROM SICKNESS, BUT SOMETIMES JUST WEARY WITH DOING THE things of life. SURE. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A WEARINESS OF BATTLING AND FIGHTING AND WAGING. SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN GET WEARY even in what you're PRAYING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JESUS SAID, "I WOULD MAN PRAY AND THINK NOT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORST THING THE ENEMY CAN DO IS TRY TO DISCOURAGE YOU AS THOUGH [screaming] YOUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HAVING any effect. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO REMEMBER HOW SATAN IS. HE CANNOT HE CANNOT INTERPRET THE WORD BUT HE ALWAYS WANTS TO TRY TO DISCREDIT OR BRING DISCOURAGEMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T BE FAINT. CONTINUE PRAYING. CONTINUE LOOKING TO GOD. BE LIKE THAT OF THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT WIDOW WOMAN THAT KEPT ON KNOCKING AND AND KEPT ON LOOKING THERE and that judge rose and gave to her what it is that she was asking for. You see, WHEN WE THINK OF THIS CLEANING OUT debris and and SO FORTH, BROTHER RAM T TALK TALKED TO US IN A MESSAGE FUNDAMENTAL foundation of faith and he'll go through that whole message and and pointing US THAT THE THE POWERS OF GOD ARE STILL UNLIMITED. THEY ARE STILL the same. And he said many times we become too clogged up and we can't understand and we thank God or we think the doctor said I CAN'T GET WELL. AS LONG AS YOU THINK THAT, YOU'RE NOT thinking God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, I'M GOING TO DIE. THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS GOING TO DIE." ALL REGARDS TO THE DOCTOR. THAT'S THE BEST of his knowledge. If he said you WAS GOING TO DIE, [screaming] HUMANLY SPEAKING, I WOULD believe the SAME THING. BUT BY THE WORD, I DON'T BELIEVE IT. That's right. BECAUSE HE PROMISED ME THAT WHATSOEVER I ASK THE father in his name would be granted. And I believe that's true. Now, you understand WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? HUMANLY SPEAKING, ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE DOCTOR CAN SEE, I COULD AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE WORD SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; SEE, that's where we've got to be ABLE TO STAND AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD. [screaming] HUMANLY SPEAKING, I CAN SEE THIS. I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS. BUT THE WORD SAYS THIS. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU BRING THE WORD TO ANY SITUATION, THAT'S WHERE DEBRIS STARTS TO BE CLEANED OUT. THE WORD STARTS TO POINT OUT, REMOVE THAT. REMOVE THAT. GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE THE WORD IS ALL POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WHEN ELI WHEN DEESA WAS ALL SHAKEN UP, OH, WE'RE SURROUNDED. OH. OH, we're surrounded. THEY'RE ALL AROUND US. HE WAS RIGHT [screaming] HUMANLY SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; BUT ELISHA SAID, GOD, &gt;&gt; OPEN HIS EYES &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN SEE THERE'S MORE WITH US THAN THERE IS AGAINST US. AND THE PROPHET OPENS UNVEILING OF GOD WITH THAT AND SAYS, "SEE, THE [screaming] GOD THAT ALWAYS WAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE. HE'S JUST CHANGED THE SEEING OF HIS SERVANT." &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IS, "OH GOD, [screaming] LET ME SEE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF ALL I CAN DO IS LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S AROUND ME, MY THAT'S TROUBLING. BUT GOD, [screaming] OPEN MY SEEING &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then we can get that channel the prophet said cleared out. Then the energy it begins to run. It begins to move. It begins to flow. And that's why he said just as sure. He said as it takes every member of my body to operate and give me life. It takes every member uh of the body of Christ to operate to give it life. &gt;&gt; Now let me just run over a few things here. Just very briefly. And I'm going to cover a couple a couple things here this morning. Here we find when you go through the letters in the New Testament truly the fountain of God has been opened, the river of God and the streams thereof that make the city of God glad. And God has been building his body down through time. We remember God made a promise that I will restore. And so there's only one thing that can actually really make glad the city of God and that's the spirit of God moving down and to really deal with our lives. Now I'm just going to say it like this. The making glad of our lives. I I've had times where oh my just a shouting and a jumping and and things like that. I've had I've had those KIND OF MOMENTS. BUT I'VE ALSO HAD THE KIND OF MOMENTS AND AND for me the moments that I so even appreciate. I I love THEM ALL. BUT I APPRECIATE HOW THE WORD GETS DOWN AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A JUMP IN time and there may not be a shouting TIME AND AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING THE WAY THE WORD GETS DOWN AND IT'S JUST LIKE THE WORD IT'S JUST LIKE A PERSONAL INTERVIEW AND IT'S JUST TAKING IT'S TAKING COVERS OFF. IT'S JUST IT'S TAKING DISPUTES AND ARGUMENTS THAT THE ENEMY HAS PLACED THERE AND GOD'S JUST TAKING THEM ONE BY ONE AND JUST TABLEABLING EVERY ARGUMENT. SO IN OTHER WORDS, YOU SEE, GOD JUST DOESN'T WANT TO JUST WIPE IT AWAY. HE WANTS TO DISMANTLE SATAN'S HOLD. SO WHATEVER HAS A HOLD WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE A HOLD ON YOU AGAIN BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE SATAN'S ACCUSATIONS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORD IN YOU IS GREATER THAN ANY ACCUSATION. AND YOU'RE ABLE TO STAND THERE ON THE WORD OF GOD. GOD takes and dismantles Satan's arguments. &gt;&gt; Remember what Satan's trying to do is put debris is load things up cuz he can't stop the water supply. &gt;&gt; SO HERE PAUL comes in and in the Corinthian church he finds among the Corinthian church where there are disputes and divisions AND HE COMES AMONG THEM. AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. THE FIRST PART PAUL OPENS in one of the first few scriptures in 1 Corinthians chapter 1, he commends them. HE LETS THEM KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN PLACED. He actually says that YOU HAVE BEEN PUT IN POSITION. THEY COME BEHIND IN NO GIFT. HE COMMENDS THEM AS A FATHER EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS THERE IS WRONG. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But remember, it's trying to bring them into that place and to deal with that debris because there's nothing wrong with the water. &gt;&gt; Right? And Paul begins to deal with this where you have those there that are, you know, I'm of Apollos, &gt;&gt; I'm a Cphus. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you friends, &gt;&gt; you know, Brother Brham tells us over and over in the message, I can't remember exactly the number of quotes, four, five quotes, where he says, "You've got a punch coming. Satan's got a punch coming to you. &gt;&gt; You didn't find it. You can even look at the one cler in Christ revealed in his own words 64 he said what would you rather and he talks about sometimes it can be on the physical level or emotional level he said would you rather not know about it or would you rather know about it but keep it covered with the blood see God you say well brother Sam I thought God just there's I mean it's just everything but you realize is that there's certain things of weaknesses that's still within our flesh let me just Say this, if we if your thought line on the maturing of sons and daughters of God is where I'm no longer going to have problems as a son and daughter of God, &gt;&gt; maturing is recognizing and understanding your weaknesses &gt;&gt; and understanding who is your source of strength &gt;&gt; and reigning as a son of God over it. Now, see that that that that takes a real SON OF GOD BECAUSE LISTEN, we're prone we're prone in our humanity to sometimes blame other people. right? For for for things to go on. I I'm saying we &gt;&gt; I didn't say you. I say we. &gt;&gt; So, God has to bring us TO THAT. AND GOD HAS A WAY OF BRINGING you and I to that place to where we begin to see and realize and recognizing more and more our dependency upon him. And so within this of the weaknesses that lay there, it's continually to keep it covered by the blood. Simply put, what that means is is continuing to stay in fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; You say, "WELL, YOU MEAN GOD WOULD DO THAT?" LET ME JUST TELL you something. Even when I'm sealed with the spirit of God, ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE THERE'S STILL THIS HUMAN PART ABOUT us &gt;&gt; and it's THERE WE ARE MADE TO RELY upon God. And God brings us to that realization as we're to rest upon him. So now with that being said, THAT HUMAN PART THAT COULD RE THAT COULD RESIDE THERE WHERE PAUL EVEN TOLD HIM, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU. THERE'S THINGS I WANT TO SAY. &gt;&gt; He said, but I can't say them. He said, I can't speak to you AS SPIRITUAL. HE SAID, I HAVE TO SPEAK ON TO AS CARNAL. &gt;&gt; He said because when right NOW WHERE YOU SHOULD BE, YOU'RE NOT UP TO THAT POINT. YOU SEE WHAT THE WORD IS LETTING THEM KNOW THIS IS THE SEASON OF MATURITY. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO COME ABOUT IN THEIR LIFE IS GOD HIMSELF WHO IS A FAITHFUL FATHER IS THERE TO POINT THOSE THINGS OUT IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT GIVE YOU AN EYE THE HOLY GHOST AND SAY, "OKAY, JUST, YOU KNOW, AUTOMATIC EVERYTHING JUST AUTOMATIC." IT'S NOT ALL AUTOMATIC. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE THINGS OF GOD. BUT YOU LEARN, you grow, and you RECOGNIZE IN YOUR LIFE OF EVEN THINGS of your weakness as things you can give yourself to and things you can't. &gt;&gt; And it don't have nothing to do with the other person sitting beside you. It's you. &gt;&gt; And it affects decisions you make. &gt;&gt; That's part of your personal walk. &gt;&gt; But here is the Corinthian church and here they are sitting here in this moment and I'm of Paulus. I'm of Cphus. I'M OF THERE WAS SUCH DIVISION. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE, you know, NO DOUBT MAYBE getting out debating. I I I don't know if they were all what THEY WERE DOING, BUT WHAT IT IS, IT DIDN'T MATTER IF THEY WERE SAYING it all out here OR IF THEY WERE SAYING IT JUST IN POCKETS AND THEY HAD POCKETS IN THIS HOUSE THAT THIS WAS THE POCKET IN THE Corinthian church for Cphus. THIS WAS THE POCKET FOR APOLLOS. THIS WAS THE POCKET FOR PAUL AND this was the pocket for Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they had that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER &gt;&gt; UNDER THE SAME ASSEMBLY &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SEEING WAIT A MINUTE THE OASIS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US BUT WHAT IS TAKING WHAT'S HINDERING IS DIVISIONS AMONG US. NOW, LET ME JUST say this to you. The question, I want you to listen carefully. The question, there was not really so much one right answer what the dispute was all about. Are you hearing me now? As I said last week, a misunderstanding is not about somebody's right and somebody's wrong. Right? &gt;&gt; Not going to go all there, but that's that's not what that's about. Misunderstanding is about when there's been a misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; Someone doesn't know what they've done and this other person's been offended or vice versa or what back and forth and everything that's led to all this. But you see within those things, how Paul is bringing it to this place, Paul steps down and as a father, HE LETS THEM KNOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE. &gt;&gt; I planted, APOLLOS WATERED, BUT GOD GAVE THEIR INCREASE. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HE DOING? PAUL'S BRINGING THE FOCUS BACK [screaming] TO &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT, THE WATER SUPPLY AND THE OASIS. HEY, GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY. [screaming] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS I'M RIGHT. YOU'RE WRONG. LISTEN, THAT THAT THAT'S NOT REMOVING DEBRIS. THAT'S ONLY PUSHING THE DEBRIS IN THE WATER. THERE'S ONLY ONE WHO'S RIGHT AMONG US, AND THAT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE ONE. AND LISTEN, WHEN WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG, THE WORD is reconciliation. And reconciliation, WHEN IT'S TRUE, RECONCILIATION DOES NOT GLORY IN CORRECTION. RECONCILIATION IS ABOUT TO SEE A LIFE RESTORED BACK INTO FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; ANYTHING ELSE IS A WRONG SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; NOW, IT'S A QUESTION, but you know, even within all of these things, we have to really really look at it and deal with IT AND SEE GOD BRINGS US TO things in our life. He brings us to things in our life. Like when you consider Israel come out of the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; right? Just watch this. They come out of the Red Sea. My goodness. Miriam had the tambourine. Man, she was coming ACROSS AND DANCING. &gt;&gt; MY, SHE WAS REJOICING. WHO WOULDN'T BE &gt;&gt; TO SEE THE TASK? I MEAN, THINK ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL HAPPENED. AND then to be able TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THE HORSE RIDER AND HIS HORSE &gt;&gt; TO SEE POWERS DESTROYED BEHIND YOU. &gt;&gt; TO SEE TASK MASTERS THAT SAID, "I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK." [applause and cheering] WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPY &gt;&gt; TO SEE GOD MADE A WAY? AND BROTHER, THEY WEREN'T WALKING ACROSS ON SQUISHY GROUND. IT WAS DRY GROUND. &gt;&gt; WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EXCITED? WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY? WHAT [screaming] HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT? YES, IT WAS A NATURAL WATER SOURCE. IT WAS OPENED UP. BUT WHO MADE A WAY THROUGH THAT NATURAL WATER SOURCE? I TELL YOU WHO DID IT. THE RIVER OF [screaming] LIFE. OUR OASIS. WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEIR BACKS WERE UP AGAINST THE WALL, [screaming] GOD HIMSELF STEPPED ON THE SEA AND SAYS, "I AM YOUR WAY." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; They come right out of that meeting. &gt;&gt; And are led right to the waters of Mara. &gt;&gt; How many it would seem like, Lord, I've just come from camp meeting. There ought to be a camp meeting service, camp meeting service, camp meeting service, camp meeting service. And if it's not, let's create it. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; We don't want to do that. That becomes a sister. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It's that that that's why you have it's why you have when you find different ones I've heard. I'm not talking about the message, but I'm heard of different ones. And what they refer to as Pentecost is worship and live worship on the stage and and the pounding of tambourines and and emotion and all that right there. That's not Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Let me just give you a definition. the prophet did in spoken word's original seed. Simply put, three word sentence, Pentecost is God. &gt;&gt; PENTECOST IS THE JUBILEE of the re of the revelation OF THE ATONEMENT SOUNDING IN YOUR LIFE THAT THE SIN DEBT HAS BEEN PAID AND YOU WERE INCLUDED IN CALVARY AND THE RESURRECTION. YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN ON THE BOOK AND THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES TO SEAL YOUR LIFE. IT MAKES GLAD THE CITY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT PUTS A JOY THAT DON'T WITH THE ORGAN DON'T HAVE TO BE GOING. &gt;&gt; The piano don't have to BE GOING. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SINGING A CERTAIN SONG. IT MAKES GLAD THE CITY OF [screaming] GOD. YOU CAN BE WALKING RIGHT THROUGH &gt;&gt; TAR GOING RIGHT THROUGH THERE, WALMART OR WHATEVER MORE. AND MY GOODNESS, YOU BEGIN TO MEDITATE ON THE LORD. YOU CAN HAVE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BROTHER? WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THE STREAMS. THEY'RE NOT LIMITED TO NOT GOING IN THOSE PLACES, BUT IT'S WHERE YOU ARE. [screaming] YOU ARE A PART OF THE CITY OF GOD. [cheering] YOU'RE A PART OF THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE A PART OF THIS WORD [screaming] AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE STREAM OF LIFE. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO MEDITATE ON THE things of God, it comes. &gt;&gt; Pentecost equipped us to live right &gt;&gt; here. They are in Mara. Man, a bitter place. Bitter. They could have started complaining. But God let Moses see here. Here's a little tree. Cut it down and put it in the water. Now, you would look and say, "I thought we were taking debris out of the water." Yeah, we're taking what don't belong in there, &gt;&gt; but we want But in order to do that, we want to put Christ in it. &gt;&gt; That means bring Christ in every situation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you don't have to try to figure it out. Just bring him into the situation. &gt;&gt; You don't have to chemically figure out the how do I turn this water from bitter no to sweet. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. JUST BRING HIM INTO IT. YOUR TEST, YOUR TRIAL, A SITUATION AFTER COMING OUT OF A GLORIOUS SERVICE, A GLORIOUS MEETING. DON'T TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. JUST BRING HIM INTO YOUR LIFE. THAT'S WHY HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN IN THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA. AND THEN THROUGH THIS AMARA, he laid it as an ordinance. I'm the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to have times of bitter sickness, &gt;&gt; sometimes bitter trials, cuz life, listen to me, life itself is bitter. &gt;&gt; But the challenge is don't become bitter &gt;&gt; from life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that's the challenge. &gt;&gt; And the only way to to to fight that is to bring Christ into it, &gt;&gt; right? is to let the Lord come into it IN EVERY SITUATION. LORD, DRAW ME CLOSER TO YOU. LORD, SHOW ME HOW HOW I'M TO BE IN THIS SITUATION. LORD, DO THROUGH MY LIFE AS A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO ARISE. IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ME BY SURPRISE, BUT YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO ARISE. EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING RIGHT. IT'S GOING GREAT ON MY JOURNEY. WHAT DO I DO? DON'T TURN BACK. DON'T PULL AWAY, BUT JUST LOOK AND SAY, "GOD, LET ME SEE YOU RIGHT NOW." &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN JUST SEE HIM AND BRING HIM TO INTO your situation, that'll change things. &gt;&gt; And then God will bring you from Mara to &gt;&gt; Elim. &gt;&gt; Where there's 12 wells of water, where there's some worship. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you've brought me through. Lord, you gave me strength. And not only did he bring me through, but God, you gave me a word to let me know there's going to be more maras. But as there's more maras, you're still the same God. &gt;&gt; No matter if it's a mara here or a mara here, you're still the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where the enemy, he likes to get us discouraged. But I want you to remember that it's God's business, the prophet said, to take care of what he himself has took to himself. &gt;&gt; God is watching over you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; There's where discouragement will want to want to come in. It's always in those times where the enemy really likes to try to pour it on you when you get discouraged. I won't ask you to raise your hand because we've all been discouraged. You might be sitting here this morning and are discouraged. And it can be for such A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT THAT'S THE VERY TIME THAT THE ENEMY LIKES TO POUR IT ON. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, YOU SAY, "HOW COULD HE POUR IT ON IN HERE?" HE'D LIKE TO POUR IT ON IN HERE AS THOUGH THAT THE WORD IS AGAINST YOU. RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'D LIKE TO POUR IT ON HERE AND TRY TO INTERPRET AND TRY TO MAKE YOU OUT TO BE JUDAS. &gt;&gt; HE'D LIKE TO POUR IT ON AND TRY TO MAKE YOU OUT TO BE CAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE. YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT. YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. YOU AND GOING ON AND ON AND ON. BUT LISTEN LISTEN. THIS IS WHERE THAT WITHIN THE MIDDLE OF IT. IT'S THAT WE MUST GOD GIVE US THE STRENGTH TO CAST THAT ASIDE. I'LL JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU, FRIENDS. IF WE CAN JUST BE HONEST WITH THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO CAST THAT THOUGHT ASIDE." CUZ I CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH THAT THINKING, BUT I NEED STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; I NEED THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE TO GET BETWEEN ME AND THAT THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; I NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT TO GET BETWEEN ME AND THAT THOUGHT. LORD, I'M INVITING YOU RIGHT WHERE I'M AT, LORD GOD, TO GET BETWEEN me &gt;&gt; and that discouragement. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hagar was at a point of death. &gt;&gt; She had a the prophet called it. She had a sister with her and her sister ran out. I want you to watch how God is so mindful. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You got to look at this in the scripture. Here she is by a fountain &gt;&gt; and she doesn't even realize what's there. She's at a point of dying, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And she's expecting. She's expecting with child. SHE'S BEEN PUT OUT OF THE CAMP, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Sarah Sarah ran her out of the camp. &gt;&gt; Come on. Sarah did before Sarah ran her out of the camp. You know, she wanted to just completely, you know, get rid You know what? Well, I'm not going to go there. I'll just let me just stay here with this cuz that that'll get me on a it'll get me on another another string and it'll take me a while to get into that point. But the point coming to is she's been misunderstood. She don't have no idea why in the world am I out here? &gt;&gt; Why in the world have I been run off? &gt;&gt; You know sometimes, let me tell you something. The Bible tells us that whatever seed we sow, we'll reap it. And sometimes the way, let me just preach now. Sometimes the way that the enemy will want to dis uh disorient the word is as is as though any wrong seeds that I've sown, I don't have to deal with them. &gt;&gt; That somehow the blood of Jesus Christ, it takes care of all that. I don't have to deal with them. Wow, &gt;&gt; I got your attention now. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, he takes care of unbelief. &gt;&gt; But if there are actions and behaviors that have been done, those seeds, the only way you're going to ever be able to really, really move on, you've got to deal with them. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the hardest thing is dealing with a bitter harvest. Nobody likes to harvest bitter seed. &gt;&gt; So, we can't say and come to a prayer line and SAY, "I WANT THIS BITTER SEED TAKEN AWAY." Who wouldn't? And then the enemy will work on that. And he gets somebody to wear their they're down. Now, I'm not talking about listen. I'm not talking about your nose or my nose or any nose being rubbed in the dirt. That's not what I'm talking about. There's sometimes there's actions and there's seeds that have consequences, &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes within that we have to bear out that bitterness. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT HARVEST OF BITTERNESS IS NOT GOING TO BE GRAIN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND RECYCLE IT. BUT you've got to stay faithful. &gt;&gt; This is where being weary in welloing can be hard. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? It's where it takes us really coming to terms with what's taking place in our life, &gt;&gt; what's going on and really identifying that sea. And you know what? It's only let me just I want to say only, but it's a season. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It's a season. It's not the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; And we can't WE CAN'T WELL THAT THAT SEASON DON'T EXIST THEN. NO. GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE GRACE TO GO THROUGH THAT SEASON. BUT LET ME REMIND YOU WITHIN THAT SEASON YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEW the right seed. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Now let me just let me pull one more example here. &gt;&gt; Here stands the Galatian church. This is another body of believers. And Paul comes to them and he's remember he's notice there's something different. Who has bewitched you? &gt;&gt; Who who has done this? Now I want you to remember God knows our humanity &gt;&gt; and that among the Gauls when you study the the people in their makeup they were very fickle people that was in their natural makeup. So here they were you know and could be it's it's evident as Paul said even here you find that he said where did this persuasion come from? you you WERE MADE YOU'RE NOW MADE perfect by the law. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT PAUL WAS SAYING? WAIT, PAUL WAS DRAWING THEIR ATTENTION to and Paul SAYS THIS AND BROTHER BROWN PICKS IT UP over and over and he says, "You started out and with with him, THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND BY FAITH WHO WAS WORKING MIRACLES AMONG YOU. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR LIFE. LOOK WHERE HE IT'S HIM THAT HAS CALLED YOU UNTO HIMSELF." AND NOW &gt;&gt; AND NOW GOING BACK to holy days AND AND HOLY FEASTS and this and and and it WASN'T LIKE THEY HAD BEEN CALLED OUT OF THAT. THEY HAD NEVER BEEN A PART OF THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WERE MEN WHO IN THEIR OWN SELVES WERE unsettled &gt;&gt; and they WERE UNSETTLED AND THEY came into Galatia AND THEY WANTED TO TRY TO TAKE THEM BACK TO A PREVIOUS SEASON OF THE WORD. That's right. &gt;&gt; SEE, WITH NOT STAYING IN THE SEASON OF THE WORD WHERE PAUL TOLD TIMOTHY, "BE IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON." &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE IT ALL TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T TAKE ISOLATED QUOTES AND ISOLATED SCRIPTURES. IT ALL HAS TO COME TO SHOW JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS A CONTINUAL [screaming] UNFOLDING OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HIMSELF WAS GROWING IN REVELATION. &gt;&gt; GROWING IN UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THINGS THAT YOU KNOW HIS UNDERSTANDING BACK THERE WITH EVEN HOW THINGS WERE AND HOW IT CAME TO THEM NOW. IT NEVER CHANGED MANY OF CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES THAT WERE SPOKEN. BUT SOMETIMES THE PRINCIPLE OF HOW THINGS ARE, HOW THINGS WERE SAID. WHO WAS THAT THAT BROUGHT THAT TO LIGHT? IT WAS THE LIGHT HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I trust that makes sense. It's operating in the right season. It'd be like you or me try if I to try to take my boys and treat my boys as though they're five years old. &gt;&gt; It's the wrong season. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen in the wrong season is is their spirit's going to get broke. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Right? &gt;&gt; It's a wrong season. I'm one to tell them, "Don't do this. Hey, you do this. You do that. You don't do this. You do this or you don't do that. You do this." Then not only is their spirit broke, but when their spirit is broke, there's no longer any growth. &gt;&gt; They become dependent upon what dad will tell them. WHEN WHEN AS YOUNG MEN THEY'RE TO BE NURTURED INTO MANHOOD, &gt;&gt; apply that to the church now. Apply it to your life. See, God's not interested IN BREAKING OUR SPIRIT. HE'S INTERESTED IF WE GET OFF COURSE IS THAT it would be lined back up. &gt;&gt; So operating in the right SEASON AND THAT'S WHY IT takes the wisdom OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID WE'RE NOT BUILDING A WALL. &gt;&gt; It's a tabernacle of the living God. &gt;&gt; MANY CAN GET ON THAT WALL AND RUN THAT WALL AND KEEP RUNNING THAT WALL AND KEEP RUNNING THAT RAW. BUT YET GOD, IT TAKES GOD, NOT A MAN, BUT GOD. AND THE PROPHET SAID, "ONE COMING DOWN FROM ABOVE TO TURN THAT CORNER." &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOD HIMSELF THAT HAS TURNED THE CORNERS IN EVERY GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH ME NOW. IT'S GOD WHO HAS DONE THAT FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AND IN YOUR LIFE, [screaming] THERE'S MANY CORNERSTONES, A CHIEF CORNERSTONE. THERE'LL BE MANY CORNERS YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN. RELATIONSHIPS AND ON AND ON. JOB AND SO FORTH. BUT HE HIMSELF IS THE ONE WHO IS PRESENT AND WILL COME DOWN AND GIVE YOU GRACE TO TURN EVERY CORNER. &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THE RAISING OF YOUR CHILDREN, IN ALL THOSE THINGS, HE IS THE EVERPRESENT HELP IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF LIKE HAGAR. I DON'T know about you, but as a parent, I found myself like Hagar. Lord, I don't know how to approach this. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know how I don't know. I don't know how to Oh, I mean, I could Yeah, sure. I could step out and act like I do. I don't want to act cuz you know what? That don't do nothing. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But God, help me. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, God, the answer, it'll come in unexpected ways. &gt;&gt; Don't ever close yourself off. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't be like the Corinthian church where you close yourself off. I can only receive help through this part right here. Don't ever do that &gt;&gt; because when you do that it starts to stagnate. &gt;&gt; DON'T CLOSE YOURSELF OUT. GOD HAS MANY CHANNELS AND VESSELS HE CAN USE AND THEY ARE A DIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; SOME THINGS LISTEN SOMETIMES IT IS NOT OUR ANSWERS DO NOT COME THROUGH THE CHANNELS that we would choose. That's true. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS you need AND YOU MUST RECOGNIZE GOD speaking through the channel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because you see, IF WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT, we can already become divided. &gt;&gt; Oh, so and so's preaching. &gt;&gt; Oh, so and so's preaching. You don't realize that's a divisive spirit. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't get as much from them. And listen, we all have, listen, let me tell you, friends, we we every every person can have their preferences, but remember, don't let your preferences dictate &gt;&gt; your pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, God wears many complexions. &gt;&gt; God is veiled in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? See, see you have to when you deal with that properly in that way, then as you deal with that and say, "No, that's not right. I'm not going to let that resolve right here. I'm not going to let because God is able to speak right through his channels." Then you know what'll happen? You'll find even in your own life where you also receive confidence because of obeying the character of the word to even be a help to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. here in Galatian. What had happened? How just, you know, let me just let me just have just a moment here. Finish this. This part, this is only one little part of it. Here was a church that was going so well. My goodness, God had I mean, they had received Paul as an angel, &gt;&gt; a messenger, even as in thestead of Christ. They had received they had received that word. But then things came among them. And I want you to notice what happened with that seed that was being sown. Not only did you have brothers that was came down and started to sew the wrong seed, but Paul watched Peter under the pressure of other brethren. other brethren that did not say anything to Peter. But here they are coming down. And here is Peter with a pork rib in his hand, bacon on his saucer. He said, "Dear Lord, thank God for the blood of Jesus. This stuff is good." [laughter] But because of pressure, God allowed the humanity of Peter to be shown. &gt;&gt; Soon as Peter saw him coming over the hill, [snorts] he changed clothes quick. I don't even want them to smell pork on me. &gt;&gt; He might have had a shot of Listerine. I don't even want them to when I speak to him. &gt;&gt; You know why that was? Because Peter was also unsettled. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now Peter, I want you to think about this. Peter, unlike those other brethren that came down, Peter was settled in that remember God had given him the keys. &gt;&gt; He was the one who preached in the house of Cornelius, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where the where where it was where it was loosed among the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND GOD EVEN LET PETER KNOW BY DREAM when Peter when it was SPOKE BY DREAM, RISE, KILL, AND EAT. OH LORD, IT'S UNCLEAN. AND GOD SPOKE TO HIM BY A DREAM. AND PETER DIDN'T EVEN FULLY understand it. And even WHEN PETER SPAKE THE WORDS, THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME AND FELL UPON THEM so that they could not even dispute or discredit. &gt;&gt; There's nothing you could do. &gt;&gt; And yet Peter got caught up in this moment &gt;&gt; and it it had a ripple effect. That's what it says in Galatians. There was others, even Barnabas, disassembled. Peter's going that way, so am I. If so and so's going that way, so am I. &gt;&gt; This is where it becomes dangerous of wanting to fit in with certain groups. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in fitting in with anybody's group. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in fitting in with anybody's mode. I'm not interested if I preach here. Oh, they might I I don't care. I really don't care because that spirit is not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not anybody tell me that, but that's exactly what I would say. It's not the spirit of God because then it becomes organizational. &gt;&gt; And it becomes a well, I'm not going to friend that brother. I'm not going to do that with that brother. I'm not going to do that because that was wrong. Haven't we been wrong sometimes? &gt;&gt; You see, but what happens? It's debris. It's debris. And that debris, debris has a welcome pathway. Wherever there's pride, it brings pride. And then look in Galatian here. They were they become they become critical. &gt;&gt; They were CRITICAL OF ONE ANOTHER. YOU KNOW WHY? Because the wrong word out of season entered into their life. &gt;&gt; And what it did is it started to cause them to compare their own life by how good they were with how good they were doing. And Paul brings them right back little by little by little by little showing them the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; I just went through the whole book of Galatians right there. But Paul brings them back to that place and he's asked them that question. Why? Why? What's happened? And as you know what's what's incredible is that as that rippling effect the word and the flow of the spirit of God always should be moving us forward &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It should never is take us backwards but move us forwards. You can be tested even to come even to try to be drawn back into things that God has brought you out of. Maybe maybe you were a part of a family where it was just common place at a dinner table to talk about other people. And if you're not careful, that very same thing can come right back around. Things can come right back around to start comparing one another. When you start comparing yourself to one another, that's a sign of backsliding. you've fallen away from the grace of God. &gt;&gt; We're never to compare ourselves among ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's a very unsettling behavior because sometimes, listen, let me just tell you something. If a person can hear and hear that kind of a talk, even sometimes as a person getting caught up in it, and let me just tell you something. Don't blame anybody else if you got caught up in the conversation. &gt;&gt; You're guilty, too. &gt;&gt; Take ownership of it and say, "You know what? I got caught up in it, too. I'm talking about cleaning out some debris. Come on, friends. Cleaning out debris and moving those things away from our lives because it can become very unsettling. It becomes very unappealing and a person can think, "Does everybody else in there? Is everybody else a critic?" &gt;&gt; Is that what this whole message is? &gt;&gt; We want to be a right representation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. And I'll tell you, if there's any critical spirit, it needs a fresh trip to Calvary. &gt;&gt; And needs to remember the grace of God that touched its life. &gt;&gt; And if it's never went deep enough yet, he's here to take us deeper. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Brandham himself, he had to deal with the critical spirit things that he was seeing that he kept on seeing build up. Listen, let me tell you something. I'm closing. Brother Brandham even even brings it in this place. When you read, just read Word Made Flesh India trip. Pull it up on your phone. Go into Word Made Flesh India trip, click on the tab that says current sermon and punch in critical. &gt;&gt; Just do that and read that succession of quotes. And when you read the incident of what took place in India of WHAT A FEMALE EVANGELIST went over there and did and bered those people, I won't even GO INTO IT. YOU WOULD ALMOST LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "WELL, HOW COULD YOU NOT BE CRITICAL?" But see, what Brother Brandham was realizing is not only was he being critical of that, he was being critical of other ministries. He was critical of this. And you know what brother Ram said? He said, "I've developed a critical spirit. I've developed," he said, he called a critical spirit a selfish spirit where it's about me. say, "Oh God, may God hear as he directs them with the Galatian church, they were to remove the debris." I realize that, you know, when we look at this, we we just want to apply some of these points going forward because the fountain of God is still just as real as it ever was. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Satan always wants to try to minimize the supernatural among us. This is why he'll try to get eyes over here or eyes over there because he wants to minimize the supernatural. The prophet said it like this. He said you take after he said a meeting. He said, "And where where there's been such a marvelous meeting where the message has went forth, the church has rose to such a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God has thrilled every person in there and the glory of God falls all around. Signs and wonders takes place less than a week, Satan is permitted to come into that congregation." Why does he do it? He said, "God permits it." And then the church begins to murmur and fall back. Maybe it wasn't so. And he said, "That's where we failed." Brother Brham goes into that quote because he said, "You'll Satan will point out, well, this person was, man, they were shouting the glories of God right next to you. Look where they're at." &gt;&gt; He'll point Who's doing that? Satan. Brother says that in that quote, Satan. Satan points out weakness. &gt;&gt; God ministers to weakness. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Two different things. &gt;&gt; Bailac took Balam up to a high place &gt;&gt; where he was looking down on the people of God. &gt;&gt; But when you are in that position, you can't see the pillar of fire like you need to. Because the only way to see the pillar of fire and the atonement is get under it and look up &gt;&gt; and to recognize his grace is above you. &gt;&gt; His grace has brought you SAFE THIS FAR AND HIS GRACE WILL LEAD YOU HOME. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Everyone when Paul brought that to the Galatian church, everyone anyone who had maybe been affected, can you imagine what their homes was like? It wasn't just the church. Can you imagine what home life was like? Cuz you see, criticalness doesn't stop with just you and your family. Eventually, you'll start questioning one another. &gt;&gt; It It doesn't stop. It keeps going. It keeps going. It keeps eating. It keeps eating. Why? It's a bacteria. &gt;&gt; It's a wiggle tail. &gt;&gt; It's something that was not meant to live or thrive. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, what should I do? Well, you take it to the Lord in prayer. And if there's something that you see that's wrong, and I'm going to stop right here. Brother Bram says, "You go to that brother. You go to that sister. But don't go." But I've got a word for you. You got to get it out of your own eye &gt;&gt; before you can get it out of theirs. &gt;&gt; What we talking about? Getting rid of the debris. Removing the debris. I know. Listen. I I know it's not all together. Maybe it's not the most comfortable thing, but yet I believe as the people of God, we're interested in the things of God. We're interested in life. &gt;&gt; We're not we're not interested in just going through the motions. And I'm not saying we have, but I believe with things that God brings to our hearts, he wants to take us deeper. And there's certain things right now that look there's a there there is there is a place for prayer lines. There is a place for all of those things. You you know very clearly I was supported all that. What I'm saying is is that I've also seen where that how Satan it's not with it's not with oh brother Sam you conduct prayer lines and you're bring confusion. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is is that the enemy if he can go undetected and really what's the root of the problem? Because brother Bam says it over and over. He says we know the cure, but what's the cause? Brother B focuses on that over and over. So it wasn't just something we just sweep people through. Some there's a place for that. Sometimes there's things where we have to look at and say, "Wait a minute, God, I remedy out any debris, anything in in me. Maybe there's something that is still God's bringing us to a place to get hung up." And friends, I'm not saying that, "Oh, there's debris laying everywhere." I'm just saying that within our life, if God would lay these things and stop me right in the middle of certain things that I'm getting ready to minister and to bring and God would bring us into a place last week and then into this early Monday morning and early yesterday morning looking over and things are just moving through my heart. Oh God, help me. Help me to get it all down. I reach over and grab one of my iPads and start typing in more. We have need of him. &gt;&gt; And if it's not so much as to clean debris, it's to keep it out. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's to keep it out. We are part of that city of God. There is a river where the streams thereof make glad. The city of God. God is in the midst of her. &gt;&gt; I believe God is dwelling in the midst of us. &gt;&gt; I want him to be fully I want him to be I want God to be be free. We want him to be free in our lives. Want the Holy Spirit. Lord &gt;&gt; just search me Lord. Look when I say friends search me. I like brother Brandon when he preaches invisible union. He said, "God, don't leave my heart out." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram just didn't take things that wouldn't for granted. But God searches. And neither is it mean where, "Oh my goodness, I'm repenting. I don't know what I'm repenting for." You're missing it. &gt;&gt; That's that's not that's not that's not at all. &gt;&gt; It's just simply God, search me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Direct me. Sometimes these things, beams and tires or whatever more are things that we can't get on on our own, we have to go to one another in order to get these out. But God is merciful. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; God is merciful. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we raised our hands, Lord, even in the beginning of service. And Lord, we've asked for your mercy. Lord, &gt;&gt; there was so many different Lord, so many different needs among us, Lord. And we know that, God, that you're the supplier, you're the satisfier, Lord Jesus. We're so thankful there is a river. &gt;&gt; So thankful that you are Lord our oasis. Lord we we see Lord our responsibility. That's our heart's desire, Lord. [music] that not only in her own life and her own walk, but Father, each one that would come in here, God, they would really have an experience with you and really become their oasis at that river of life, oh God, they would have that same experience, Lord, where then out of their life would flow rivers of living water. Lord, I no doubt Lord as many of us Lord have come to that place and Father throughout Lord we're a place Lord that God where the sick and where the needy gathers. Not a not a gathering of perfect people, but Lord God, a gathering of hearts and lives that believe and are resting in a perfect sacrifice, a perfect word that's been delivered by a perfect God and a perfect Holy Spirit among us, a perfect fountain that's able to satisfy the thirst. Lord Jesus, we ask here this morning, Lord. Lord God, even as the word's searching our lives, even Lord, even as we will come to a place and we'll be dismissed from one another's presence. But Lord, we're asking may the word just continue to move in our lives. &gt;&gt; Giving discernment, Lord, alerting us, knowing that when Paul would write to the Galatian church and say, "Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ have made you free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage." Lord, it was letting them know, reminding them, stand fast in this liberty. Father, we see as your prophet many places he said it, how that the enemy wants to come and will come right among us. He's permitted to. But Lord, as I hear your prophet say over and over and over again, it's not my brother, it's the enemy that's got between us. Lord Jesus, if any feelings would be any other way contrary, would you just open eyes this morning? Open our eyes like you did, Gahesus, that we can see it in the right light, Lord. That we might go with a Lord, a [music] real discernment in our heart. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, &gt;&gt; Lord. I pray maybe Lord that as we come through this Lord and look at it. &gt;&gt; Will you just give us strength Lord give courage to every heart Lord in every life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Lord Jesus. Whatever it might be, a tractor tire, a beam, maybe it's something, Lord, God to be settled, a misunderstanding. But I pray, heavenly father, Lord God, for not only the sake of our assembly, but for the sake of every home. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful, God, for your mercies among us, Lord. It just does our heart, Lord. Just it makes us glad. There's a gladness about it, Lord. Even when there's, oh God, when there's things that can be, Lord, reconciled, or hearts are mended, Lord, it makes glad even as you uncover and you minister to our weaknesses and you help us. Strength is ministered to us, encouragement, refreshing. Oh God, grant it here this morning. Lord, we're looking to you, Lord. The perfect sacrifice, the perfect blood. Oh God, continue to lead and guide us, Lord. Like your prophet, Lord say over and over. Oh God, we have no creed but Christ, &gt;&gt; no law but love, and no book but the Bible. Grant it, Lord Jesus. I pray father may you always lord Jesus be before us &gt;&gt; oh God our live the living source of water Lord the refreshment our joy our peace Lord &gt;&gt; you're the restorer of life Lord God where the enemy Lord has wanted to steal and to take away but you're a restorer Lord oh God may the streams from that river may it reach every heart and every life. I pray grant it Lord &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ a river that flows [singing] from deep within. Oh, there is [music] there's a fountain that frees [singing] [music] the soul from sin.

As a brother said, Lord, today if there's any impediment, Lord, if there's anything that's in there that's that would try and block up that channel, Lord Jesus, I pray that you'd just show it to us, Lord, and give us the strength and courage to go down and start pulling those things out, Lord. And like you said, that river, it'll clean itself up, Lord, with that that that spring that's flowing up from below, Lord Jesus. We're so thankful for that, Lord. Just continue to cleanse us, Lord. when we hear your word, Lord, when we're in prayer and the Holy Spirit's there, Lord, just continue to cleanse us, Lord.
