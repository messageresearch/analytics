[29:34] house yesterday and the Lord spoke to me
[29:39] tell arose and I want her to sing a song
[29:42] to identify my body and when you tell
[29:46] her she's going on this stand your was

[30:02] the morning let's sing this with all our
[30:05] hearts
[30:09] [Music]
[30:24] it no more
[30:27] [Music]
[32:02] god bless you this morning why you know
[32:05] how to worship over here
[32:07] I thought the North was cold and starchy
[32:10] but you guys must be from down south
[32:12] moved up this way or something yes wow
[32:15] this is good atmosphere to come into and
[32:18] and my sister Rosa and that was that was
[32:23] something right there and you know I
[32:26] know not to embarrass you but but that
[32:28] was anointed now you really set the bar
[32:37] for me having to preach now following
[32:39] that god bless you and greet you on the
[32:43] name of the Lord and I guess if you just
[32:45] want to have your seats we'll just take
[32:47] a minute to to do that to greet you I
[32:50] you know I don't go out a whole lot and
[32:53] preach I just feel called at home
[32:55] they're helping brother Paul in the
[32:57] local body and I heard brother Branham
[32:59] say one time he said you know every
[33:01] minister knows that when you go out
[33:02] somewhere he said you just talked to the
[33:04] people a little bit to help break the
[33:06] ice and get to know one another so you
[33:09] know so I'm not very experienced than
[33:11] that but you know I have been here
[33:13] before about I don't know maybe a year
[33:16] ago or so and I remember telling brother
[33:19] Sam I said brother Sam you got a well
[33:21] oiled machine over there said it's it's
[33:23] working fine the people were sweet and
[33:26] very greeting and you know last time I
[33:28] don't think I got to tell you the last
[33:30] time cuz I don't I don't think if I'm
[33:32] remembering correctly we did announce it
[33:34] yeah back home but my wife couldn't be
[33:36] with me because we found out she was
[33:38] pregnant and we were having some
[33:39] complications and she was sick and
[33:41] things and just couldn't make the drive
[33:42] and seven months old now baby boy I got
[33:47] my boy so we're very happy for that
[33:52] it's quite the trial my my wife was put
[33:55] on bed rest for I don't know maybe the
[33:59] last three months of it I can't remember
[34:01] so it was just real hard on her
[34:03] especially but but he came and the Lord
[34:06] helped us get to the hospital in time we
[34:09] arrived an hour later he was born so he
[34:12] was he the Lord just held him off and
[34:16] the the Midwife was actually driving
[34:18] behind me and and you know I had her
[34:21] cell phone and she called me and she
[34:23] said where are you and I said I'm
[34:24] passing the exit whatever exit this was
[34:26] and she goes okay I think I'm behind you
[34:28] and after we got to the hospital and and
[34:31] he had been born and everything she said
[34:34] I was watching you she said if you
[34:36] pulled over I was pulling over with you
[34:37] and we were gonna have that baby on the
[34:39] side of the road and I said well thank
[34:41] the Lord we all made it here but
[34:44] unfortunately my I had a little one that
[34:46] was sick last weekend and then kind of
[34:49] came came up with it again Thursday and
[34:53] so we just my wife just wasn't sure up
[34:56] until even last night she was really
[34:58] wanting to be here and meet you all and
[35:00] be here with me but just just felt to
[35:03] keep the little ones home and and let
[35:05] them kind of recoup and things so I
[35:07] apologize they're not here but give you
[35:11] greetings from them and that brother
[35:13] Paul and the church back home and just
[35:16] pray we could be a blessing to you today
[35:19] often think of myself a little bit like
[35:22] like Ally Hugh and if you know the story
[35:24] of job he was just this young man fourth
[35:28] guy that shows up you know we know Joe's
[35:30] three accusers or you know as so-called
[35:33] friends you know that we're putting him
[35:35] down and all of a sudden this fourth guy
[35:37] shows up and he's just this young young
[35:40] kid you know but he says listen he says
[35:42] if if God could be upon you in the
[35:44] spirit he said he can be upon me too so
[35:46] I'm just trusting that's where my trust
[35:49] is this morning not my own abilities
[35:51] because I I know I'm the least among the
[35:53] preachers and amongst you and everything
[35:56] else so I just believe that the Lord
[35:59] will be with us here so let's turn to
[36:02] the word if you want to stand
[36:04] and open with me to Matthew 24 last time
[36:11] we were here we spoke on brotherly
[36:15] kindness I'm sorry that's my title today
[36:17] statue of a perfect man we spoke on
[36:19] temperance and it was just something
[36:21] that the Lord I heard a message that
[36:25] Donnie Regan's preached a long time ago
[36:27] a couple years back now on on charity
[36:29] and it just so moved my heart and and so
[36:34] I just started looking at that and then
[36:36] I thought Lord was the starting point
[36:39] you know IFIF I'm gonna bring something
[36:40] like this to our local body where's the
[36:42] starting point for divine love and he
[36:45] just seemed to say you know I don't even
[36:48] know how he led me to this it was just I
[36:50] was reading them the message statue of a
[36:52] perfect man I guess and he said that's
[36:53] that's where you start so that's where
[36:56] we're gonna start today and speak on
[36:58] brotherly kindness so just bear with me
[37:00] as we lay a foundation here but Matthew
[37:02] 24 and verse 9 says then shall they
[37:06] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[37:08] kill you and ye shall be hated of all
[37:11] nations for my name's sake I want you to
[37:13] catch in these scriptures the spirit
[37:15] here though hate you and they'll kill
[37:17] you and then shall many of many be
[37:21] offended and shall betray one another
[37:23] and shall hate one another and many
[37:26] false prophets shall rise and shall
[37:28] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[37:31] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[37:34] so just catch the condition here of
[37:37] betrayal and hatred so much to a point
[37:41] that they would kill if they had the
[37:42] opportunity they would physically kill
[37:44] but you know we have laws and things in
[37:47] place here in this country and we're
[37:48] very blessed in that way but they'll
[37:50] kill you in another way they'll kill
[37:51] your influence they'll kill your example
[37:54] they'll kill everything that that just
[37:57] run you down and that and that's another
[37:59] form of killing and and he says in verse
[38:04] 13 but he that shall endure unto the end
[38:08] the same shall be saved
[38:10] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[38:13] preached in all the world for a witness
[38:14] unto all nations and then shall the end
[38:17] come
[38:18] let's just ask the Lord bless the word
[38:21] here father we come before you in Lord
[38:25] you just moved mightily God in the song
[38:27] service Lord and I know father I heard
[38:30] the prophets say a couple times here in
[38:32] the recent past Lord that the the
[38:36] singing would go before the the soldiers
[38:39] in battle when they're on their way to
[38:40] war and he said that's why we have song
[38:42] service at the beginning is because
[38:44] we're marching into battle and then the
[38:46] word comes and so father your people
[38:49] have done God just I'm very impressed
[38:52] Lord at the worship here this morning
[38:55] father and and I truly mean it God I
[38:58] could see Lord them worshiping with all
[39:01] of their hearts Lord sister Roseanne
[39:04] given that special with all of her heart
[39:05] God and now I'm asking you to help me
[39:08] preach with all of my heart Lord speak
[39:11] to this people God no doubt father they
[39:14] didn't come Lord to hear me they came to
[39:16] hear from you and they're hungry to hear
[39:18] your word help me to bring it now get
[39:20] out of the way and we pray Lord for
[39:22] brother Sam father ministering out and
[39:25] Bluffton I just ask you to give him
[39:27] strength and that you would give him
[39:29] traveling mercies Lord and that you
[39:31] would bless the meeting there Lord we
[39:34] love our pastors God God called men in
[39:36] our lives and we just pray for him now
[39:38] and ask that you bless him in Jesus name
[39:41] Amen amen you can be seated I know I
[39:47] said it last time too but I so
[39:49] appreciate what you've done for your
[39:50] pastor there in his office you know I've
[39:53] seen the office my pastor has had before
[39:55] and and you know it's just such a
[39:57] blessing to him maybe you don't know how
[39:59] much a blessing but I thank you for
[40:01] treating him that way I heard this
[40:05] recently in investments brother Branham
[40:07] says and you don't you don't say it to
[40:10] be mean you say it for love people has
[40:12] got all things mixed up thinking love is
[40:14] just some little puppy dog something he
[40:17] says love is straight god is love God
[40:19] rebukes and Chasen's because of love I
[40:22] hope that soaks just as deep as I tended
[40:24] to do see that it's love that corrects
[40:28] it's love that's corrective and genuine
[40:31] love will
[40:32] stand correction and you know it's it's
[40:35] difficult to start to speak on love
[40:37] because I don't know if you've ever read
[40:39] the the 11th commandment here is a
[40:44] little book somebody put out you know
[40:46] brother Branham and it's just beautiful
[40:48] the things he says but in there he says
[40:49] you know many many poets and many
[40:52] songwriters and many preachers have
[40:54] tried to explain what love is what God's
[40:57] love is and he said we cannot do it as
[40:59] mortals we can't we have no
[41:01] understanding of that but you know it's
[41:03] it's I believe that you know we know God
[41:05] by his nature and by his characteristics
[41:07] and the things that he does we can
[41:09] recognize God in that and so I believe
[41:11] that we can recognize what divine love
[41:13] is by its nature and and and you know
[41:17] the this world this age of laodicea has
[41:19] got it so mixed up they all claim to
[41:21] have love and to claim they know what
[41:24] love is
[41:25] and yet it's it's a perversion of love
[41:28] it's it's a it's a lustful love there's
[41:32] different levels of love and this this
[41:33] age of laodicea has has a has just has a
[41:36] lust on it and they call it love but
[41:39] Roman says that God's going to give him
[41:41] over to a reprobate mind and he says
[41:44] that they'll they'll have vile affection
[41:46] and and and they'll think that it's real
[41:49] love but they do things that aren't
[41:52] natural it's it's it's not a natural
[41:55] love it's not the love of God but it can
[41:58] get it can become so confusing because
[42:00] it looks so good and it sounds so good
[42:02] in it and it seems so real and it seems
[42:05] like you know it's it's just become a
[42:08] you know many many of you know the the
[42:11] Planet Fitness you know they just kind
[42:12] of blew up everywhere and there's
[42:13] there's a statement in there I guess
[42:16] that says judge you know it's a
[42:18] judgment-free zone and and that's the
[42:20] thing that this world has its you could
[42:22] you could wrap it up in that saying is
[42:24] this is judgment free don't judge me
[42:27] don't don't do this don't do that and
[42:29] and you know I just been a little
[42:31] reluctant because I just had just
[42:34] believed it was the Lord I just started
[42:36] just interested in something I heard
[42:38] years ago about I think it was
[42:40] Ambercrombie and Fitch and if if you
[42:42] wear Ambercrombie and Fitch don't don't
[42:44] don't be a
[42:46] this morning I'm just going back and
[42:47] looking at a little history here but you
[42:50] know they're their slogan back at a
[42:52] certain time was was and forgive me I
[42:56] just hope this is okay to say but if you
[42:59] don't believe that there's a spirit
[43:01] behind fashion this will prove it to you
[43:03] their slogan was was is to be sexy their
[43:08] their their target audience was that was
[43:11] the preppy and the ones who could put on
[43:13] their clothing and be transformed into
[43:15] something that was that was had sex
[43:18] appeal to it and and and it just it was
[43:21] just a big big huge I don't know what
[43:24] else to call it besides a big huge lust
[43:26] fest I mean that's all as it was you
[43:28] couldn't even walk through the mall
[43:29] without you know their big posters and I
[43:32] didn't realize this but when you if you
[43:34] went into the store they had greeters
[43:36] that were shirtless and and it was just
[43:38] all kinds of just just sin and and and
[43:41] just filth in it but that was that was
[43:44] what appealed to the young people that
[43:46] was what appealed to the generations but
[43:49] now they had to kind of switch that back
[43:51] in about 2014 I think it was they had to
[43:54] kind of switch their approach because
[43:56] they said you can get sex anywhere you
[43:58] can go out and you could see things that
[44:00] are sexy anywhere so they said it's it's
[44:03] it's they're gonna approach it that it's
[44:05] sex but it's but it's more than that
[44:07] it's sex plus they said is this okay
[44:11] this morning forgive me I just I'm just
[44:13] trying to lay a foundation here because
[44:16] because the love of God is so different
[44:18] it's so it's so much different than that
[44:21] it's it's holy and it's and it's got its
[44:24] place in marriage but nowadays you can
[44:27] you know you can just have quick access
[44:29] to anything you don't have to wait for
[44:31] marriage that's just the way Satan has
[44:33] set it up but so they go along and in
[44:36] this history and and they change the CEO
[44:38] because they realized that this is no
[44:41] longer selling this way we need to
[44:42] change our approach and so they change
[44:45] it from from now it's now sex plus they
[44:48] got a it needs to be inclusive it needs
[44:51] to fit the the direction of the age and
[44:53] that was 2014 2015 was when they
[44:56] legalized same-sex and you can watch
[44:59] this
[45:00] spirit moving this fashion this fashion
[45:02] world in this direction and and you know
[45:05] it's just it's just filth but but now
[45:07] they they they tone back on it and and
[45:10] it's and it's so that you can you can
[45:12] you can choose your orientation you can
[45:16] you can choose it's just it's just
[45:18] perverted but God's love is so different
[45:22] from that God's love is yeah okay sure
[45:26] come into the house of God I'll accept
[45:30] you come into the house of God I'll
[45:32] accept your sacrifice but there better
[45:34] be a sacrifice and I expect change I'm
[45:37] not going to leave you in homosexuality
[45:39] I'm not going to leave you in your sin I
[45:42] want to change you because I'm after
[45:44] something I'm after a people that I want
[45:47] to reflect myself through and that's
[45:49] what I want to change you into it's not
[45:52] this just you got to accept me as I am
[45:56] God okay we give them that come as you
[46:00] are come and see come and see what we
[46:03] have but you will be changed you have to
[46:05] be changed you're either going to go out
[46:07] of these doors were so you're gonna be
[46:09] closer to God there's only two ways
[46:11] that's not staying still it's not going
[46:13] to be stay as you are I'm driving this
[46:15] home and I don't know why but you get
[46:17] you've got to leave change God wants you
[46:19] to change can you say Amen it's a it's a
[46:25] selfish love it's a self pleasing love
[46:30] but Jesus's own words says that because
[46:32] iniquity shall abound and we see that
[46:36] it's iniquity because iniquity abound
[46:40] the love of many waxes cold they don't
[46:44] they don't know what love is really in
[46:47] their hearts if you don't accept them
[46:49] they hate you and they want it they want
[46:50] to wipe you out that's not love that's
[46:53] not love the love of many shall wax cold
[46:57] why am I saying all this because it's
[46:59] the spirit of the age and if we're not
[47:02] careful that spirit can come in amongst
[47:05] us and I'm not talking that maybe
[47:08] necessarily we we get lustful or that we
[47:12] go off in
[47:13] in some sin or something though though
[47:16] we can the spirit of the age can affect
[47:19] us that way can you say men but the love
[47:24] of many shall wax cold and if we're not
[47:27] careful that will come into our ranks
[47:29] and I love for one another
[47:30] starts to wax over we become common to
[47:34] one another we we start not really
[47:37] caring about one another we're talking
[47:39] this morning on brotherly kindness and
[47:42] and brotherly kindness the Prophet said
[47:45] I'm all over my notes so I'm just gonna
[47:48] stay back from them for a minute the
[47:50] Prophet says that brotherly kindness is
[47:52] is put yourself in their shoes on the
[47:55] matter brotherly kindness is putting
[47:59] yourself in their shoes that you might
[48:01] understand brother Branham said that
[48:03] when when he preached or when he prays
[48:05] for the sick he says the success of me
[48:08] praying for the sick the reason that
[48:09] they're healed is he said because I can
[48:11] put myself in their shoes because I can
[48:15] I can feel for the people and and if you
[48:18] want results when you're praying put
[48:20] yourself in their shoes if they're sick
[48:23] amongst us this morning
[48:24] and you know it you you all know I don't
[48:27] know I don't know the needs and the in
[48:29] the congregation which you all know them
[48:30] if somebody's sick this morning put
[48:33] yourself in their shoes and pray for
[48:36] them listen you have the power within
[48:41] you to drive out cancer you have the
[48:45] power within you to drive out diabetes
[48:48] to drive out depression if you're
[48:52] depressed this morning you don't have to
[48:53] be that way if you know somebody's
[48:55] depressed maybe they're not here this
[48:57] morning because you know that they're
[48:59] depressed you you individually every one
[49:03] of you has the power to drive those
[49:05] spirits out all's you got to do is pray
[49:08] the prayer of faith and put yourself in
[49:11] their shoes when you put yourself in
[49:14] their shoes you can love like like no
[49:16] one else can love you can you can see it
[49:20] from their perspective my let me catch
[49:25] myself here
[49:29] you know it's interesting another thing
[49:32] just that that can wax our love cold for
[49:36] one another especially in a local
[49:38] assembly is being common to one another
[49:41] you sojourned for years with each other
[49:44] and you start to learn one another's
[49:46] weaknesses and those weaknesses instead
[49:50] of realizing that you have weaknesses -
[49:52] you'll capitalize on those weaknesses
[49:54] you'll focus on them and then after a
[49:57] while you start getting a little funny
[49:59] feeling towards that person and then you
[50:01] just don't want to be around them
[50:02] anymore but it's easy and and you know
[50:06] we'll have new ones come in amongst us
[50:08] and and we should flock to them we
[50:11] should make them feel welcome
[50:12] we shouldn't we should invite them over
[50:14] and go out to eat in things with them
[50:17] and enjoy getting to know them but I'm
[50:20] talking about an imbalance when the new
[50:23] ones come in and you say well I'm gonna
[50:25] go over here because I'm just tired of
[50:27] the old
[50:29] I'm tired of the relationships that I
[50:32] have there's too much strain I don't
[50:34] want to go back and try to repair that
[50:35] so I'm gonna I'm gonna gravitate over to
[50:38] these new ones now if you're new here
[50:39] this morning this isn't to make you feel
[50:41] bad I'm speaking of the ones who have
[50:43] been here for a while you just you just
[50:45] enjoy yourself but just know that after
[50:48] a while
[50:49] watch yourself that you don't take on
[50:51] the same approach that you get to know
[50:54] these ones so you just don't like that
[50:58] about that brother I don't like that
[51:00] about that sister come on somebody we're
[51:05] in a body of Christ and and we should
[51:08] have all things in common we should have
[51:10] unity but but the Prophet said Satan is
[51:14] continually punching at us he's always
[51:16] trying to get in he doesn't listen you
[51:20] got a beautiful thing here Saint gonna
[51:22] let that stay that way he's gonna fight
[51:24] you tooth-and-nail
[51:25] every step of the way and and if you
[51:28] feel this morning that you've been
[51:29] mistreated and and and you've backed off
[51:33] a little bit because of that let me
[51:34] encourage you to put that behind you let
[51:37] me encourage you to put yourself
[51:40] quit wallowing in your pain and I say
[51:43] that with the utmost love I just don't
[51:45] know how to say it
[51:46] don't don't wallow in it and and and
[51:50] start thinking about somebody else it'll
[51:53] help you I promise it will help you get
[51:55] your eyes off of your own pain get your
[51:58] eyes off of your problem is this helping
[52:00] somebody this morning and and start
[52:02] thinking about somebody else look for a
[52:06] way to show them that you love them do
[52:08] good to those who despitefully use you
[52:11] pray for them the Bible says it's his
[52:14] tall order friends but but these are the
[52:18] promises of God this is the life that he
[52:21] expects from us this is the life that
[52:23] he's wanting to reflect through us can
[52:26] you say Amen we can have unrealistic
[52:32] expectations of one another we really
[52:36] can I think it's because because we
[52:40] we've been given the truth that we have
[52:42] and we have the opening of the word and
[52:45] so we we come to expect a certain level
[52:49] of standard with that and I and I think
[52:53] that that's a good thing I think we
[52:55] should we should expect of ourselves
[52:57] especially to have a certain standard
[53:00] because because this is what God
[53:02] requires a holy life and it's incentive
[53:05] ocation but know though that you can't
[53:08] live that life in yourself you have to
[53:10] have the grace of God to live that in
[53:12] you if you don't understand something in
[53:15] the Word of God don't throw it out don't
[53:19] don't get so beat down and let the enemy
[53:22] just just put you in turmoil over it
[53:25] give it to God God has to do that
[53:29] through you if you if you you know and
[53:32] so often we can look at older ones and
[53:34] and who have been around awhile and we
[53:36] say man I just I do this all the time I
[53:39] want to be like that brother I want to
[53:42] have that kind of life I want I want to
[53:44] live so close as brother branham said
[53:48] that I'm so sensitive to his Holy Spirit
[53:51] I heard somebody and I don't remember
[53:53] where
[53:53] I heard it they said I think it was
[53:55] brother Eddie Driscoll and they were
[53:57] they were walking and they were taking
[53:58] these the the garbage totes out to the
[54:00] road any and he said the wind kind of
[54:04] blew by and he said brother Eddie just
[54:05] stopped and the any he said you know he
[54:08] said brother Branham was so sensitive to
[54:10] the Holy Spirit that if just a little
[54:12] breeze would come and touch the back of
[54:14] his neck he would stop and say is that
[54:17] you Lord I want to live that sensitive I
[54:21] want a relationship like that and I
[54:24] believe that we can I don't believe that
[54:27] it's a far out of our reach I believe
[54:30] that if there's a deep that calls to the
[54:33] deep within your heart that says come up
[54:35] higher then there is a higher place for
[54:38] you to live don't let it get you down
[54:41] but just know and keep pressing for the
[54:44] mark of the high calling in Christ can
[54:46] you say Amen is this helping you this
[54:48] morning
[54:59] you know just one last comment and then
[55:01] I'll and then I will move on here but
[55:02] you know relationships that are new
[55:05] maybe you went to camp for the young
[55:07] people and you met some some new young
[55:10] people and it's easier I've seen it
[55:13] before it's easier to to create a
[55:16] friendship with those and it's easier to
[55:19] create a friendship with those who who
[55:22] maybe are at work and who are outside
[55:24] the local body and you'll hear sometimes
[55:27] people say you know I don't have any
[55:28] friends at church or I don't feel like I
[55:31] belong there or something along those
[55:33] lines but it's because relationship is
[55:36] work it's hard work it's reconciling
[55:40] it's it's paying a price laying down
[55:43] things that have hurt you and laying
[55:45] down your own pride and and and it takes
[55:48] hard work can you say Amen
[55:53] so second Peter chapter one and verse
[55:57] five and he says and besides this giving
[56:05] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[56:06] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[56:09] temperance and to temperance patience
[56:11] and to patience godliness and to
[56:13] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[56:16] brotherly kindness charity now I don't
[56:19] know if I showed it last time or if
[56:21] you've seen it before but I was noticed
[56:23] in the pyramids here that are these are
[56:24] these are beautiful by the way I love
[56:26] those and at the top of it is charity
[56:29] but right before you hit charity it's
[56:32] brotherly kindness and you watch the
[56:34] holy spirit throughout the scripture and
[56:36] he'll put things in such an order and
[56:38] when you start studying man and God and
[56:40] the Holy Spirit reveals him you realize
[56:41] there's an absolute order to this God
[56:44] knew what he was doing
[56:45] when he had the right or right this this
[56:46] way because you want you look at you
[56:49] look at brotherly kindness and then I've
[56:51] gone into into charity there in first
[56:54] Corinthians 13 and and long-suffering
[56:57] and you realized that I mean it has to
[57:00] sit on this foundation of putting
[57:03] yourself in one another's shoes I don't
[57:06] I don't
[57:06] it just it's so perfect I just I just
[57:09] love the Lord it's just perfect
[57:13] now I want to read you a couple quotes
[57:15] here and I realize you know I'm coming
[57:19] in and I'm trying to preach this where
[57:21] you know it's just will try to fit it in
[57:23] and not read too much but brother
[57:27] Branham said and humble thyself now
[57:29] surely after all these years on the
[57:31] field and around the world and seeing
[57:32] different people I ought to know a
[57:34] little bit about the gate to enter in
[57:36] that and if you want to get somewhere
[57:38] with God never let an arrogant spirit
[57:41] ever come around you don't let no malice
[57:43] come in malice one of the definitions of
[57:46] that is a funny feeling and we're gonna
[57:49] emphasize that this morning is a funny
[57:51] feeling
[57:52] don't leaven that never let no malice
[57:55] come in you no matter what anybody does
[57:57] if they are wrong don't you never build
[57:59] up a complex around a complex against
[58:03] that person see you be sweet and kind
[58:06] remember God loved you when you were in
[58:09] sin and if the Spirit of God is in you
[58:13] you love the other person when he's in
[58:15] wrong see just pray for them and love
[58:18] one another
[58:19] earlier in there he says he says just
[58:22] talk sweet and be real sweet to him -
[58:27] against our nature isn't it above
[58:32] everything love God and love one another
[58:35] when they asked Christ they said what's
[58:38] the greatest of the commandments What
[58:40] did he say
[58:40] love God and love one another because if
[58:44] you love right where the venom says this
[58:47] he says I will tell you this my friends
[58:52] when the love of God comes into your
[58:54] heart you won't go around hurting or
[58:57] being hurt you won't go around hurting
[59:01] or being hurt when you love right you
[59:05] live right you you there just when you
[59:10] love it just brings a faith about it
[59:13] that you you have faith in that person
[59:16] you realize that you know they don't
[59:18] they don't really I don't believe that
[59:19] that brother or sister I don't believe
[59:21] that they really mean me harm I don't
[59:24] believe that they would do that if they
[59:25] if they were thinking right maybe
[59:27] they're just having a bad day give them
[59:30] the benefit of the doubt maybe they're
[59:33] just having a bad day and we all could
[59:36] have do you all have bad days amen
[59:40] maybe maybe a family member sick can
[59:44] they and they just haven't shared that
[59:45] with you yet
[59:46] maybe something is going on see what I'm
[59:49] saying
[59:50] put yourself in one another's shoes have
[59:52] grace for one another love one another
[59:55] and be humble above everything love God
[1:00:00] love one another and be humble with God
[1:00:02] and around one another and God will
[1:00:04] bless us and it's hard telling what he
[1:00:07] will do usually when a church begins to
[1:00:10] get in numbers and get getting a little
[1:00:12] bigger or something like that then they
[1:00:14] get away from the real thing and then he
[1:00:17] says it again the real thing a little
[1:00:19] bit further down and I just want you to
[1:00:21] catch this okay when we had the tent
[1:00:24] meetings just across the street a tent
[1:00:26] that seated about 2,500 people ministers
[1:00:29] come from everywhere and said brother
[1:00:31] come here a minute
[1:00:32] he said I was just a boy just a kid and
[1:00:35] he said how do you keep those people in
[1:00:37] one Accord they love one another told I
[1:00:40] haven't seen people love one another
[1:00:44] that's the Lord that's what this church
[1:00:47] was established upon that godly
[1:00:49] brotherly love for one another I seen
[1:00:52] them even shake hands with one another
[1:00:54] leaving the place and cry like babies to
[1:00:58] leave one another they love one another
[1:01:00] that well and you know I remember
[1:01:03] interjecting here you know sometimes we
[1:01:05] look around at each other and I don't
[1:01:07] know if you have these problems I just
[1:01:09] this is what the Lord laid on my heart
[1:01:10] you know you look around at one another
[1:01:13] and you think that'll never happen in
[1:01:15] our church you may think that but it can
[1:01:21] it can it absolutely can friends God
[1:01:24] wouldn't say these things and and and
[1:01:27] kind of hang the carrot way out there
[1:01:29] that you'll never attain to and just
[1:01:31] make you continue running after it
[1:01:33] eventually you're gonna catch the carrot
[1:01:35] God's gonna do it in our myths God's
[1:01:37] going to do it amongst the body of
[1:01:39] Christ
[1:01:39] around the world we're going to come
[1:01:41] into this kind of love I believe that
[1:01:43] with all of my heart because friends
[1:01:45] when he when the Prophet went beyond the
[1:01:48] curtain of time the angel of the Lord
[1:01:50] said only love can enter here only love
[1:01:53] it's it's you only take love and your
[1:01:57] character with you and it's out of
[1:01:59] divine love for one another you're gonna
[1:02:01] spend eternity with one another now down
[1:02:05] down the road but but you can have this
[1:02:07] now it starts here
[1:02:08] can you say Amen I believe it starts
[1:02:11] here and let me just let me just skip
[1:02:23] this here and I just summarize it here
[1:02:29] for you a little bit let's catch this he
[1:02:32] says further down let not that spirit
[1:02:34] ever depart from this place if it ever
[1:02:37] does that I don't care how eloquent your
[1:02:40] pastor might be how well he might bring
[1:02:42] the Word of God the spirit of God has
[1:02:44] grieved away when you don't have this
[1:02:46] spirit of charity working among you he
[1:02:49] says I don't care the Spirit is grieved
[1:02:51] away when we can have all things in
[1:02:54] fellowship in common and love one
[1:02:56] another then God will work with us
[1:02:58] I believe it's another place he says you
[1:03:01] know when you act like that when you act
[1:03:03] out against one another he says you hurt
[1:03:04] your pastor you know he says I don't
[1:03:06] care how your pastor holic when he
[1:03:08] brings the word he says the Spirit of
[1:03:09] God is grieving away in another spot if
[1:03:11] I if I have it correctly he says you
[1:03:12] know you hurt your pastor yeah it is
[1:03:16] this okay you don't understand sometimes
[1:03:19] maybe the heart of a pastor you don't
[1:03:23] understand what that does I mean I'm
[1:03:26] serious friends I'm not a pastor but but
[1:03:29] I've been blessed to work alongside mine
[1:03:31] closely and and see the heart of other
[1:03:35] pastors and I tell you it grieves them
[1:03:37] it grieves their heart it hurts them
[1:03:40] because they think first of all they're
[1:03:42] gonna look at themselves first and say
[1:03:45] Lord what am i what am I not preaching
[1:03:48] or what what's going on here why is this
[1:03:51] this way you know I believe
[1:03:53] love brother salmon and you wouldn't
[1:03:54] necessarily do it just for brother Sam
[1:03:56] but I don't know where this is coming
[1:03:58] from I believe the Holy Spirit so we'll
[1:04:00] just keep going but just know that that
[1:04:03] it doesn't you're not an island to
[1:04:06] yourself you friend you affect the body
[1:04:10] of Christ you do the way you live the
[1:04:14] way you act you you are part of this
[1:04:17] body and if and if listen I cut my
[1:04:20] finger my thumb the other day on a
[1:04:22] pocketknife and it hurt and I tell you I
[1:04:26] needed this thumb for many things I was
[1:04:30] doing I needed this thumb I ended up
[1:04:33] falling carrying my son and I slipped on
[1:04:37] this curb and I just kind of think the
[1:04:39] Lord held him up and I I hid tore my
[1:04:41] jean and you know I mean I just I had
[1:04:45] this I almost said booboo I got three
[1:04:47] kids
[1:04:47] I had to scrape on my knee and and you
[1:04:56] know trying to work in things and I was
[1:04:58] on my knees with knee pads mind you but
[1:05:00] it just it get rubbed and it break open
[1:05:02] and things and it just it just hurt I
[1:05:04] needed that knee and I didn't realize
[1:05:07] how much that affected me until I was
[1:05:10] trying to do things so listen I don't
[1:05:12] care what you feel about yourself this
[1:05:14] morning I'm here to tell you as a gospel
[1:05:17] minister that you are needed and that
[1:05:20] you are important in the body of Christ
[1:05:22] and you're loved you're loved you may
[1:05:26] not feel loved this morning and that's
[1:05:28] because Satan has you bound up in a
[1:05:30] complex but let me tell you this morning
[1:05:32] you are loved amen
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:38] so he goes on in humility and hopefully
[1:05:43] this is all flowing together for you
[1:05:45] humility is the first key to unlocking
[1:05:47] brotherly kindness because to put
[1:05:50] yourself in someone else's shoes you got
[1:05:52] to tear down your pride you got to be
[1:05:55] humble and and through that quote we
[1:05:57] just read I believe it was love and
[1:06:00] humility and he talks about family altar
[1:06:03] in the homes you know you have a part to
[1:06:05] play in your home
[1:06:06] and your everyday walk with life it's
[1:06:08] not just here on Sunday or Wednesday or
[1:06:11] whenever you have service this isn't
[1:06:13] this isn't the only spot you go home and
[1:06:16] you live it and you you should you
[1:06:18] should be in prayer and you should be
[1:06:20] reading your word and you should be
[1:06:21] feeding your experience you know over
[1:06:23] there at Peter says he talks about
[1:06:24] diligence he says and add this with
[1:06:27] diligence and and what that is is it's
[1:06:30] not you try to work it up in yourself
[1:06:32] basically this is my summary of it this
[1:06:35] is this is Brandon's dictionary of the
[1:06:38] Bible I guess is feed your experience
[1:06:42] that's diligence feed your experience
[1:06:45] come to church when the doors are open
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:55] now if you have trouble seeing how Lord
[1:07:01] how do I do this how do I put myself in
[1:07:03] their shoes these people Lord the the
[1:07:07] people out in the world the people that
[1:07:09] I work with how do I put my solisten
[1:07:11] this goes beyond the body of Christ -
[1:07:12] you want to win a soul you got to put
[1:07:15] yourself in their shoes can you say Amen
[1:07:17] some of us you know maybe I don't know
[1:07:19] the dynamics of the body here but you
[1:07:22] know maybe there's a lot of people that
[1:07:24] are that are you'd say generational
[1:07:26] message believers you know they we've
[1:07:29] been blessed you know young people if
[1:07:31] you grew up in a message home you're
[1:07:32] blessed but there's a lot a lot of
[1:07:35] people who grow up in the world and and
[1:07:37] you know they can they can more easily
[1:07:39] put themselves to know and other
[1:07:41] people's shoes but listen I went to
[1:07:43] public school and I'll tell you like I
[1:07:46] said with that study with just a little
[1:07:48] bit of reading on that on that that
[1:07:49] fashion and seeing that man I tell you I
[1:07:51] saw it I was there and and and it's it's
[1:07:55] you can you can put yourself you you
[1:07:57] have to break down your pride so that
[1:08:00] you can see that this is a lost soul
[1:08:04] this is a lost soul and listen brother
[1:08:08] branham lost the feeling for the people
[1:08:09] remember I said a little funny feeling
[1:08:11] will become very very important in the
[1:08:15] service a funny feeling and he says he
[1:08:19] says you know I lost
[1:08:20] feeling for the people this was after
[1:08:21] the seals in the breach no standing in
[1:08:27] the gap I'm sorry standing in the gap he
[1:08:29] speaks to that and and he admits he says
[1:08:32] I lost a little something because the
[1:08:35] people they they they they don't seem to
[1:08:37] be accepting the message and he said
[1:08:39] it's not so much me what I'm bringing he
[1:08:41] said but it's the truth I'm trying to
[1:08:43] tell him the truth and he says you know
[1:08:45] he was just ready to give it all up and
[1:08:47] go up and live in the mountains and he
[1:08:49] said I'll sure do some good fishing but
[1:08:51] he said that was a little selfish but in
[1:08:54] another spot I found he's talking about
[1:08:56] that feeling that he lost and he said
[1:08:58] you know he said it's not just that I
[1:09:01] tell him you know hey you know blah I
[1:09:04] forget how exactly how he cause he words
[1:09:06] it a couple different ways you know I
[1:09:07] think it's in a boat he says they're in
[1:09:09] a boat and they're headed for a cliff
[1:09:10] and he said it's not just hey you're
[1:09:12] headed you're headed for a cliff stop he
[1:09:15] said it's not just that he said I want
[1:09:17] to chase after him
[1:09:18] if they laugh and snicker and they don't
[1:09:21] accept it he said I want to chase after
[1:09:23] him that's the feeling that he was one
[1:09:25] that's the feeling that he had lost was
[1:09:27] not just telling the truth but to chase
[1:09:29] after him to keep loving him now how do
[1:09:37] we do that
[1:09:38] how do we put ourselves in other
[1:09:39] people's shoes in one spot he's talking
[1:09:44] about Romans where Paul says you know
[1:09:47] the things that I that I want to do I
[1:09:48] can't seem to do and the things I don't
[1:09:50] want to do I seem to be doing and I find
[1:09:53] that there's there's two laws working
[1:09:55] within me Paul says and brother
[1:09:57] branham's talking about that and he says
[1:09:59] and the life of the cocklebur has been
[1:10:01] taken out but the nature of the
[1:10:03] cocklebur is still sticky I'm sorry I
[1:10:06] love these because you just can't have
[1:10:08] pride in them the nature of the
[1:10:10] cocklebur is still sticky so he says you
[1:10:12] were a cocklebur before you received the
[1:10:14] Holy Ghost but when you receive the Holy
[1:10:16] Ghost the life of the cocklebur is taken
[1:10:18] out and the wheat life is put in but he
[1:10:20] said you're still cocklebur on the
[1:10:22] outside I think I said it before and
[1:10:24] you've heard it many times no doubt
[1:10:25] you're a three-part being there's only
[1:10:28] one part of you that's saved there's
[1:10:30] only one part I just love this because I
[1:10:33] just Aaron
[1:10:33] pride only one party as you say there's
[1:10:37] two parts that's unconverted and there's
[1:10:40] two parts listen now you got one part
[1:10:42] that the Spirit of God can come up
[1:10:44] through there's two parts that Satan can
[1:10:46] torment and he does it and he'll use it
[1:10:49] and he'll try to get to that to that one
[1:10:51] part but he says it's still sticky and
[1:10:54] it will be listened it will be until
[1:10:58] this new life has fully been developed
[1:11:00] out on the ground and raised up again
[1:11:02] when it comes forth when it's no more
[1:11:05] cocklebur but wheat but while it's here
[1:11:09] on earth and in out of the earth and a
[1:11:13] cocklebur it's still sticky but it's got
[1:11:16] the nature on the inside of it wheat and
[1:11:18] as long as you're in this life you're
[1:11:20] going to be sticky and have a carnal
[1:11:22] nature that's going to bother you as
[1:11:24] long as you live but the inside of you
[1:11:28] you're born again and when you're raised
[1:11:30] up you're in the likeness of Christ and
[1:11:31] all the sin has gone from you see that's
[1:11:34] the thing he says you know so we so we
[1:11:38] have these two natures and they're
[1:11:39] warring against us so so how do you put
[1:11:43] yourself in somebody else's shoes to
[1:11:45] realize that you're sticky too you're
[1:11:48] still a cocklebur on the outside also
[1:11:50] can you say Amen and what a cockle burrs
[1:11:54] do if you've ever gotten them they stick
[1:11:57] one another and they stick to one
[1:12:00] another and when you're trying to take
[1:12:02] them off they'll stick you and this is
[1:12:04] our this is our nature the outside that
[1:12:07] we're stuck with until we leave but
[1:12:10] listen there's an inside nature of the
[1:12:12] Holy Spirit am I allowed down here with
[1:12:14] you there's an inside spirit that's
[1:12:19] that's the nature of a weak and you
[1:12:21] might act out a place with one another
[1:12:23] and you might say something just a
[1:12:26] little snappy at one of your brothers or
[1:12:27] your sisters but the Holy Ghost inside
[1:12:30] of you that nature on the inside of that
[1:12:32] cocklebur that's sticking one another
[1:12:34] it's gonna smite your heart and it's
[1:12:37] gonna say you know what you weren't
[1:12:38] right when you said that you need to go
[1:12:41] back and apologize and let me tell you
[1:12:43] something we some of us need to lose our
[1:12:45] pride and go apologize
[1:12:47] that's why I'm saying it's humility
[1:12:48] friends because we got to humble
[1:12:50] ourselves lose our pride and say you
[1:12:52] know what I'm sorry I'm wrong and how
[1:12:54] many times have we have we seen it where
[1:12:56] somebody can't do that
[1:12:57] and it's a shame it tears the whole
[1:13:02] thing up until we can humble ourselves
[1:13:08] humility and in love I tell you I just I
[1:13:12] just I love the Word of God
[1:13:14] remember we said diligence is feed your
[1:13:17] experience that chief the one time he
[1:13:19] says you know brother Branham said how
[1:13:21] you doing chief or the man that was
[1:13:23] talking to him he said how you doing
[1:13:24] chief he said pretty good pretty bad
[1:13:26] what do you mean chief and he said well
[1:13:29] there's two dogs that are inside of me
[1:13:31] one black dog one white dog and he said
[1:13:34] they're constantly fighting he said well
[1:13:36] chief which one wins he said the one
[1:13:37] chief feeds the most so remember friends
[1:13:44] McMinn astir swear broken records but
[1:13:48] there's a truth to it we're pointing you
[1:13:51] to the source of your strength because
[1:13:53] you can't you have no strength in
[1:13:55] yourself your strength is weakness to
[1:13:59] God but his strength is perfect are you
[1:14:04] with me a little bit longer we're doing
[1:14:05] pretty good on time Romans 3:23 for all
[1:14:10] have sinned and come short of the glory
[1:14:13] of God how do you put yourself in the
[1:14:16] other person's shoes you were a sinner
[1:14:18] too you had to come to God the same way
[1:14:21] that they have to you know what I heard
[1:14:30] some time ago sorry I'm just trying to
[1:14:36] think of how much to share here my mom
[1:14:42] my mom and dad are divorced as of a
[1:14:44] couple years ago and there was an
[1:14:49] adultery involved in the situation
[1:14:51] and one day you know I had a hard time
[1:14:56] with that as a kid
[1:14:58] as a son you know it's it's difficult if
[1:15:01] you come from a broken home it's hard
[1:15:04] it's hard it even that I don't know how
[1:15:08] old I was at the time but I'm 31 now you
[1:15:10] know it affects you it does and so
[1:15:14] that's why we have to have grace for one
[1:15:15] another is because you never know what
[1:15:17] somebody's been through in their life or
[1:15:19] what they're going through at a time at
[1:15:21] a later age but I was driving on the
[1:15:24] road one day and I and I had a message
[1:15:26] playing and brother branham he said you
[1:15:28] know he said if an adulterer a
[1:15:31] prostitute an adulterer or somebody who
[1:15:33] commits adultery he said if they'll come
[1:15:35] back and they'll they'll meet the same
[1:15:38] conditions that those women prostitutes
[1:15:40] and adulterers in the scripture met he
[1:15:42] said God will forgive them God will
[1:15:45] forgive them all have sinned and fallen
[1:15:47] short of the glory of God it doesn't
[1:15:51] matter what you've done if you repent
[1:15:54] it's gone
[1:15:55] listen you justified you're justified
[1:16:01] it's not that you're just you know okay
[1:16:04] pardon this is gonna go in your file
[1:16:06] over here God says I don't have a file
[1:16:12] on them they never did that and listen
[1:16:18] God extended His grace to you in that
[1:16:21] way don't you want to extend grace to
[1:16:24] somebody else
[1:16:34] Ephesians 4:32 sorry I'm getting I'm
[1:16:39] just enjoying the word this morning I
[1:16:41] hope you are too if he ends 432 and be
[1:16:46] kind one to another tender-hearted
[1:16:51] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:16:54] Christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:16:58] Colossians three and verse eight and I'm
[1:17:01] going to bounce a little bit between the
[1:17:02] amplified and King James just because I
[1:17:04] really like the way it just explains it
[1:17:06] a little bit further for me but now you
[1:17:09] also put off all these anger wrath
[1:17:12] malice blasphemy filthy communication
[1:17:14] out of your mouth and that verse and the
[1:17:17] amplified says but now put away and rid
[1:17:19] yourselves completely of all these
[1:17:21] things anger rage bad feeling towards
[1:17:25] others curses and slander and
[1:17:28] foul-mouthed abuse and shameful
[1:17:30] utterance from your lips lie not one to
[1:17:33] another seeing that ye have put off the
[1:17:35] old man with these deeds and have put on
[1:17:37] the new man which is renewed in
[1:17:39] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:17:41] created him where there is neither Greek
[1:17:44] nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision
[1:17:46] barbarian scaly and bond nor free but
[1:17:49] Christ is all and in all verse 12 out of
[1:17:52] the amplified put on the King James says
[1:17:54] clothe yourself therefore as God's own
[1:17:57] chosen ones his own picked
[1:18:00] representatives who are purified and
[1:18:02] holy and well beloved by God Himself by
[1:18:05] putting on behavior marked by
[1:18:07] tender-hearted pity and mercy kind
[1:18:11] feeling a lowly opinion of yourself
[1:18:13] gentle ways and patients which is
[1:18:16] tireless and long-suffering and has the
[1:18:18] power to endure whatever comes with good
[1:18:21] temper be gentle and forbearing with one
[1:18:24] another and if one has a Korell a
[1:18:28] difference a grievance or a complaint
[1:18:30] against another readily pardoning each
[1:18:34] other even as the Lord has freely
[1:18:36] forgiven you so must you also forgive
[1:18:43] and above all these things put on
[1:18:45] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[1:18:49] now where I've been getting this little
[1:18:51] funny feeling statement from is I kept
[1:18:55] hearing it pop up in the message as I
[1:18:57] was as the Lord was just directing me
[1:18:59] down this months ago and I just kept
[1:19:02] hearing it a little funny feeling a
[1:19:05] little funny feeling towards them never
[1:19:06] have a little funny feeling if you have
[1:19:08] a little funny feeling get it taken care
[1:19:09] of
[1:19:10] and it just it just caught my attention
[1:19:13] and brother branham says don't never let
[1:19:16] a little ism or a little something
[1:19:18] another a little bad feeling ever rise
[1:19:20] up among you get it out of the way right
[1:19:23] now
[1:19:23] that's the little fox that spoils the
[1:19:26] grapes you know so keep it out of the
[1:19:27] way
[1:19:28] any little funny feeling go and tell the
[1:19:30] person to it say I'm wrong I don't feel
[1:19:33] right towards you and something help me
[1:19:35] pray over it that it'll be better
[1:19:37] because we did it we don't want nothing
[1:19:40] but just purely the unadulterated Holy
[1:19:42] Spirit of God among us that's all we
[1:19:45] want then what the gifts and things will
[1:19:48] work right and everything will be coming
[1:19:50] right you want gifts among you you want
[1:19:53] to see manifestations of the Spirit get
[1:19:55] the funny feelings out from among you
[1:19:57] now listen friends I like to balance
[1:20:00] this because out of a pure desire we can
[1:20:04] take this too far to and and and I got a
[1:20:09] little funny feeling I need to go tell
[1:20:10] that person well you're gonna start
[1:20:12] giving them a little funny feeling if
[1:20:13] you're not careful I'm talking about a
[1:20:18] good a good thing to judge it is listen
[1:20:21] pray about it pray about it don't just
[1:20:28] pray that God will change the other
[1:20:30] person pray God will change your heart
[1:20:33] because remember when love the real love
[1:20:36] of God comes into your heart you won't
[1:20:38] go around hurting or being hurt so you
[1:20:41] need a heart change to regardless of
[1:20:44] what they've done wrong so pray about it
[1:20:46] pray for them if that little funny
[1:20:48] feeling doesn't go away give it a give
[1:20:51] it a little bit of time and not you know
[1:20:53] I'm just I hope this is okay trying to
[1:20:55] balance this out
[1:20:56] and and and you just can't seem to get
[1:21:00] past it then it's time to go talk to him
[1:21:02] it's time to go talk to him brother
[1:21:06] branham says a little bit further in
[1:21:07] this quote he says now that he refers to
[1:21:09] the scripture and the scripture says if
[1:21:11] anyone has ought against you go make it
[1:21:13] right so after a while again pray about
[1:21:18] it
[1:21:18] you should always pray first there's
[1:21:21] that saying talk don't don't talk to God
[1:21:25] about the people before you go talk to
[1:21:28] the people about God go go talk to God
[1:21:30] about it before you go talk to the
[1:21:32] people about it because maybe your heart
[1:21:35] will change on it
[1:21:36] can you say Amen that is that clear but
[1:21:42] you may need to go talk to that person
[1:21:43] and say hey brother I just just want to
[1:21:45] make sure the air is clear and listen
[1:21:47] now listen to me real close this is just
[1:21:50] real practical I guess I hope that's
[1:21:52] okay to call it that sometimes when you
[1:21:55] go and you go to make something right
[1:21:57] everything okay everything's fine
[1:21:59] brother everything's all right
[1:22:00] well god bless you I guess you know
[1:22:02] we're okay then you know everything's
[1:22:04] not right
[1:22:06] they continue on and I mean you just
[1:22:09] know that it's not right
[1:22:11] but listen you did your part you tried
[1:22:14] it's it's between them and God not to
[1:22:17] get an attitude now watch your attitude
[1:22:19] continue praying about it but I'm just
[1:22:23] saying you did your part
[1:22:25] you did well can you say Amen so I don't
[1:22:35] know if you ever heard it this is in the
[1:22:37] revelation series are you still with me
[1:22:39] a little longer because I like I like to
[1:22:43] see I'm so thankful for a prophet and
[1:22:45] I'm thankful for the Prophet we had
[1:22:47] because you see somebody with a
[1:22:50] spiritual life that all of us there's
[1:22:51] just something in us yearning to attain
[1:22:53] to that and yet he shares his mistakes
[1:22:57] with us and I just love that and and
[1:23:01] there there was a situation and and
[1:23:03] maybe you're familiar with it maybe
[1:23:04] you're not where the least I think it
[1:23:08] was two men that started it these two
[1:23:10] men started this rumor that brother
[1:23:12] Branham was deity he was Christ and he
[1:23:14] said stop he said stop doing that you
[1:23:18] make me Anti Christ when you do that I
[1:23:20] don't know where some of these tapes
[1:23:22] these people are listening to or maybe
[1:23:23] they're missing these but the ones who
[1:23:25] are making brother branham Christ and
[1:23:27] and you know take the preacher out of
[1:23:29] the pulpit and just hit play you kind of
[1:23:32] wonder and what message that listening
[1:23:33] to but so he's ready to take himself out
[1:23:38] of the off-the-field then he says I'm
[1:23:40] shutting my office I'm done I think he
[1:23:43] may say you know I'll preach here and
[1:23:44] there catch a convention but he said I'm
[1:23:46] done I'm through with it I'm not gonna
[1:23:47] have that and and he actually it it
[1:23:53] creates from what I understand of it it
[1:23:55] creates a little funny feeling towards
[1:23:57] these brothers because he's I mean he's
[1:23:58] been to him he's asked him don't do that
[1:24:00] he took brothers with him don't do that
[1:24:02] finally he tells it before the church
[1:24:04] and he says I'm done I'm just I'm
[1:24:05] through there's a situation he says I
[1:24:08] can't have it you make me Antichrist
[1:24:10] when you do that this is what he said so
[1:24:13] he turns it over to God he turns it over
[1:24:16] to God catch that and he says but when I
[1:24:18] come to a place I
[1:24:20] thought as them men put himself in their
[1:24:23] shoes and I could finally love those men
[1:24:26] enough they can't get away from it and
[1:24:30] immediately shows that those men were
[1:24:32] called so as soon as he did that as soon
[1:24:35] as he started thinking about those men
[1:24:36] as soon as he could put himself in their
[1:24:39] shoes and think you know there is
[1:24:40] supernatural around this ministry I
[1:24:42] could understand that being mistaken and
[1:24:45] he just this this love came over him and
[1:24:48] he said they couldn't get away from the
[1:24:50] love at that point because it just
[1:24:52] filled his heart for him and and God the
[1:24:54] Holy Spirit moved on those men and it
[1:24:57] was over he turned it over to God and
[1:24:58] the Holy Spirit just came down and took
[1:25:00] care of it but he says he had to feel
[1:25:02] for those men and he says that that
[1:25:06] shows remember at the beginning we said
[1:25:08] love is corrective and love can stand
[1:25:10] correction he says that shows that those
[1:25:13] men was was called that they were
[1:25:15] elected because he said they they they
[1:25:17] wish stood when the scripture was spoken
[1:25:20] he said they took the correction and I
[1:25:24] just say that for your benefit whether
[1:25:27] it's through the pulpit or whatever it
[1:25:30] might be when if if you get all burnt
[1:25:33] out of shape when somebody comes and
[1:25:35] corrects you when the Holy Spirit
[1:25:37] corrects you where where else can we go
[1:25:40] to be corrected in the house of God you
[1:25:42] ought to you ought to come and say Lord
[1:25:44] if there is anything in my life
[1:25:45] correctly can you say Amen
[1:25:49] you'll walk away and you'll say thank
[1:25:52] you Lord we'll just breathe start
[1:25:58] bringing it down to a close here what
[1:26:04] was God's response remember we're
[1:26:05] talking brotherly kindness what was
[1:26:08] God's response to brother Branham when
[1:26:10] he criticized the woman in the
[1:26:12] restaurant do you remember that the
[1:26:15] blood bumper he the Lord gave him a
[1:26:17] vision of the blood bumper and he and it
[1:26:19] was it wasn't a woman since it was
[1:26:21] brother Branham sense and it would go up
[1:26:24] and it would hit that bumper and come
[1:26:25] back down and he ended up he went over
[1:26:27] and he said lady I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:26:30] this is how it was feeling about you but
[1:26:32] God hey God correct
[1:26:34] me on that and he said and he ended up
[1:26:37] leading her to the Lord the very one
[1:26:39] listen the very one that he was
[1:26:42] criticizing needed him needed him and in
[1:26:46] that state of criticism of a critical
[1:26:49] spirit and looking down and in those
[1:26:52] funny feelings against her God comes in
[1:26:55] corrects him and then love is projected
[1:26:57] and Sovereign Grace took over amen I
[1:27:03] hope you bring in this in mind of the
[1:27:07] local body here what was Christ's
[1:27:11] response when they hung him on the cross
[1:27:13] with such brutality when they read
[1:27:15] listen they rejected their Savior they
[1:27:19] rejected the God that we worship they
[1:27:22] rejected him they treated them it just
[1:27:27] terrible terrible don't even explain it
[1:27:30] awful I mean it was just terrible what
[1:27:33] did what did what was Christ's response
[1:27:35] Father forgive them for they don't know
[1:27:38] what they're doing Christ saw that
[1:27:42] they're blinded they're blinded and
[1:27:45] they're doing this they don't they don't
[1:27:46] know what they're doing and he said
[1:27:48] Father forgive them can you do that this
[1:27:52] morning I want to challenge you this
[1:27:55] morning right now in this moment I want
[1:27:56] to challenge you can you forgive can you
[1:28:01] humble yourself maybe you say brother I
[1:28:04] don't I don't have anything to forgive
[1:28:05] well praise the Lord we have those times
[1:28:08] too but there's times remember Satan's
[1:28:12] always punching he's always trying to
[1:28:14] come he's always trying to come in and
[1:28:16] break up what you got here
[1:28:19] put yourself in one another's shoes
[1:28:26] and I just just feel the clothes here so
[1:28:30] if the musicians would come you know the
[1:28:37] Bible says love your enemies and I
[1:28:38] always had a hard time with that Lord
[1:28:41] how do you love your enemies you know
[1:28:45] you just sharing all this morning I
[1:28:49] guess you even going through the
[1:28:51] situation with my family you know I had
[1:28:53] a hard time I had a hard time separating
[1:28:56] the sin from the sinner and I didn't I
[1:28:59] didn't it I just had a hard time just
[1:29:02] being honest with you it was difficult
[1:29:05] because you know we can we can get so
[1:29:09] reflected where it's so much on our own
[1:29:11] pain that we don't see the pain of
[1:29:14] others and you know so I just thought
[1:29:18] Lord how do you love your enemies and I
[1:29:22] thought and then it was just like the
[1:29:24] Lord spoke back and he said put yourself
[1:29:26] in their shoes
[1:29:28] love your enemy put yourself in their
[1:29:31] shoes the boss who is constantly riding
[1:29:36] you at work how do you how do you show
[1:29:40] love to somebody like that the Bible
[1:29:42] says to to do good to and it would be
[1:29:46] like not that you do this for this
[1:29:48] reason but it says if you do good to
[1:29:49] them it's like heaping coals of fire on
[1:29:51] top of their head it just sets them on
[1:29:53] fire all the more because they're
[1:29:55] thinking I'm trying to get to this
[1:29:57] person the spirit in them is thinking
[1:30:00] I'm trying to get to this person I want
[1:30:03] to destroy their day and yet there's
[1:30:05] something about them
[1:30:06] there's Oh help me Lord there's an
[1:30:10] atmosphere that's coming out of them I
[1:30:11] can't seem to get through that
[1:30:13] atmosphere they're still smiling why are
[1:30:16] they still smiling because you're
[1:30:19] thinking lord I was a sinner once I used
[1:30:23] to act like that I've had bad days lord
[1:30:27] help my boss you know there's another
[1:30:32] quote and I'm sorry I'm trying I guess I
[1:30:34] wasn't done just yet you can stand to
[1:30:37] your feet
[1:30:39] there's a quote and I just I just love
[1:30:41] to say it because it just it expresses
[1:30:45] this so well
[1:30:47] and brother branham said when someone's
[1:30:49] done you wrong and you know that they
[1:30:52] absolutely justifiably they deserve
[1:30:55] punishment because they've done you
[1:30:56] wrong he said go to prayer and I'm just
[1:31:01] paraphrasing I got the quote but I just
[1:31:03] don't want to just paraphrase it here
[1:31:07] and he says you take him to prayer and
[1:31:10] he says when you're in the presence of
[1:31:13] God says you're you're mortal you're to
[1:31:19] mortals and one can't condemn the other
[1:31:22] in the presence of God he says listen
[1:31:24] now when you come down from there when
[1:31:29] you come down from there he said maybe
[1:31:31] you'll see what your brothers your
[1:31:32] sister's going through and you can love
[1:31:36] them right so that's what I'm saying
[1:31:37] friends it's it's very important to take
[1:31:40] them to prayer take them to prayer you
[1:31:44] need to see someone else's shoes pray
[1:31:47] for I hope this was a blessing to you
[1:31:51] this morning
[1:31:54] you've been very attentive and I
[1:31:58] appreciate that I tend to slow down a
[1:32:01] little bit towards the end so hopefully
[1:32:02] it didn't bore you I just I pray that
[1:32:10] you can come up a little higher this
[1:32:13] morning and see the Christian walk a
[1:32:17] little bit more clearly and and and help
[1:32:19] you because I know it's hard friends I
[1:32:21] know it's hard when someone's at
[1:32:23] treating you that way it's difficult
[1:32:29] let's just bow our hearts in prayer here
[1:32:33] and I wonder with every head bowed eyes
[1:32:37] closed if you've got a little something
[1:32:40] in your heart towards somebody nobody
[1:32:42] looking around now it's just between you
[1:32:45] and God but it's just to identify Lord
[1:32:47] I've got a little something in my heart
[1:32:49] towards that brother or that sister
[1:32:51] maybe towards my boss or towards that
[1:32:54] co-worker
[1:32:55] because that's having a lot of
[1:32:56] testimonies come back coworkers you just
[1:33:01] want to make that known to the Lord and
[1:33:02] say father help me to put myself in
[1:33:04] their shoes that you could be expressed
[1:33:07] to them maybe you're the only hope
[1:33:10] you're the only source that the lever
[1:33:12] here or or see a life lived of the love
[1:33:16] of Christ father we come before you lord
[1:33:25] Lord I know God that I've had many times
[1:33:29] funny feelings in my heart towards
[1:33:31] somebody in even situations now Lord
[1:33:34] that I'm thinking of while I'm praying
[1:33:36] here father that Lord is just difficult
[1:33:40] to see their place on it or their
[1:33:42] position why they're acting that way why
[1:33:45] would their doing that why they would
[1:33:47] speak out like that but father we want
[1:33:52] to check our own hearts Lord we pray
[1:33:56] that whatever that person's going
[1:33:58] through that you would go administer to
[1:33:59] that need but father right now Lord we
[1:34:02] need minister to God in our hearts we
[1:34:05] ask you Lord to change our hearts God
[1:34:08] that your love could be expressed Lord
[1:34:12] we love you so much father and we just
[1:34:15] want to be the best representative of
[1:34:17] you and of this message on this earth
[1:34:19] that we can be help us to love deeper
[1:34:23] Lord bless your people now god I just I
[1:34:27] pray Lord that this would have spoke to
[1:34:32] him this morning

[1:34:39] them around this body here God that the
[1:34:45] love of Christ or that you'd be
[1:34:47] glorified and brother branham said at
[1:34:50] the end of that humble thyself quote he
[1:34:53] said we're looking for the time that
[1:34:55] people drive by and say have you been up
[1:34:57] to that Tabernacle that's the sweetest
[1:34:59] bunch of people reverent for the word or
