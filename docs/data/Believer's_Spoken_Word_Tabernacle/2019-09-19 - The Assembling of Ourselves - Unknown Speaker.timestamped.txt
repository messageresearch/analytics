[30:47] [Music]
[31:07] [Music]
[31:36] [Music]
[31:42] [Music]
[31:56] [Music]
[32:09] you believe that tonight hey man he's
[32:14] bigger he's greater amen he's above
[32:18] every situation amen so good to be
[32:22] together in the house of the Lord and so
[32:26] thankful to God for His mercy made a way
[32:28] for us that would be able to be here we
[32:33] just want to look into the word of the
[32:35] Lord here tonight could you want to open
[32:38] your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10 just
[32:42] want to just continue to speak there
[32:47] we've been looking at the purpose of our
[32:51] gathering but I would like to tonight
[32:54] just deal with the thought the
[32:56] assembling of ourselves together
[33:06] verse 23 is where we like to start
[33:11] let us hold fast the profession of our
[33:16] faith without wavering for he is
[33:20] faithful that promise
[33:23] let us consider one another I want you
[33:26] to notice how this is placed here and
[33:29] let us consider one another to provoke
[33:32] unto love and to good works I'm not the
[33:39] only one he's coming after he's coming
[33:42] after his body and you're not the only
[33:46] one he's coming after but if you were
[33:49] the only one in this area he'd come for
[33:52] you so because of that let us consider
[33:57] one another to provoke which means to
[34:01] incite or stimulate unto love and to
[34:06] good works amen
[34:09] I can't think of any other way to
[34:11] provoke one another then just be an
[34:14] example I think that's the greatest way
[34:17] we could do it because the gospel is
[34:19] made to be lived in flesh amen not
[34:25] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[34:29] together as the manner of some is but
[34:34] exhorting one another so much more so
[34:39] much the more as you see the Day
[34:42] approaching
[34:44] I appreciate the exhortation don't you
[34:47] I appreciate the word that comes forth
[34:50] it may not be these exact words but it
[34:53] comes forth every service keep pressing
[34:55] keep pressing keep pressing keep
[34:58] pressing and we're comforted by those
[35:02] amen let's read that again verse 25 not
[35:06] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[35:10] together as the manner of some is but
[35:14] exhorting one another and so much the
[35:16] more as you see the Day approaching
[35:22] you might have a need you'd like to be
[35:24] remembered
[35:26] tonight
[35:28] let's just pray together hands up all
[35:30] over the building tonight we all stand
[35:33] in need
[35:34] Lord Jesus we Lord aren't just so
[35:40] thankful the Lord that you have given us
[35:43] your name Lord you said and you bid to
[35:48] us ask the Father anything in my name
[35:51] how do it
[35:53] Lord Jesus we're coming to you tonight
[35:56] Lord we believe your God that for every
[36:00] need Lord that is gathered here Lord
[36:03] together tonight that you're present
[36:06] more to minister to that need Lord
[36:10] whether it's for that Lord life that was
[36:14] Lord behind the uplift at hand or
[36:16] whether they're standing in Lord for
[36:19] someone else Lord you know tonight Lord
[36:22] and we just pray Heavenly Father that
[36:25] you were just Lord come among us in a
[36:28] special way tonight every time you come
[36:32] in special it's special and we just ask
[36:36] God that just be another special time
[36:39] tonight Lord as we Lord step away from
[36:42] the cares of life for just a few moments
[36:44] Lord and to hear from you O God Lord
[36:48] Jesus we pray that you'll just come
[36:50] speak through these lips of clay Lord
[36:53] here Oh God
[36:55] father through the ears of clay Oh God
[36:59] may you just take control now Lord in
[37:02] the further part of the service Lord
[37:04] come and speak to our hearts in a
[37:06] personal way we pray in the name of
[37:09] Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as
[37:13] you're being seated
[37:19] I think it's very very fitting in that
[37:24] you know we look here in the scripture
[37:27] and Paul would speak to us that not
[37:33] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[37:35] together there's some things that God
[37:40] does for us and there's other things he
[37:43] expects us to do and this is one of the
[37:47] things that he expects us to do he
[37:51] manifests himself one of the many he
[37:54] manifests himself to us and his love and
[37:57] his care you know there's things that
[37:59] not one of us can heal our body when
[38:02] we're sick no matter how much medicine
[38:05] we take or whatever that only aids the
[38:07] process but there and we see that
[38:11] there's so many things that God he does
[38:14] for us but yet this is something that
[38:16] God will not do for us God will not
[38:19] assemble for us but he puts this now
[38:24] into into our responsibility that we're
[38:28] not to forsake to assemble ourselves
[38:30] together and if that if this admonition
[38:32] in the word when I look at things in the
[38:35] word when it would speak in express of
[38:38] this it lets me know that there are
[38:41] things that can arise and things that
[38:44] can come about that would seek to pay of
[38:48] our responsibility sometimes in the
[38:51] measure of these things right here is
[38:53] simply as brother Branham lays out
[38:57] throughout the message it's a lack of
[38:59] the love of God we're in that that in
[39:02] within the life they they have not
[39:05] received the love of God down in their
[39:07] soul then there's other times where it
[39:10] becomes the cares of life can actually
[39:13] get in the way and I understand
[39:14] sometimes and you do as well that
[39:17] sometimes there's things to where you
[39:18] are mandated to do certain things and
[39:21] they tell you you're gonna work over and
[39:24] there's no ands ifs or buts about it but
[39:27] then there's other times about it that
[39:29] when we come together and I know there's
[39:32] times that I'll be honest with you just
[39:34] as much as it would be easy for you to
[39:37] come at certain times it's easier
[39:39] sometimes for me to preach than it is at
[39:41] other times there's some times I feel
[39:43] like preaching and other times I don't
[39:45] feel like preaching and you know I know
[39:47] that might sound like a marvel but the
[39:49] only thing that I can do is present
[39:51] myself and let gain knowing that God's
[39:54] going to take control and do what he has
[39:57] purposed to do and so within that I
[40:00] believe that that's where the sacrifice
[40:02] comes into play
[40:04] within our lives because we know that we
[40:07] are not this is not a protracted social
[40:11] gathering but we are assembled and I
[40:14] want you to catch this now we are to
[40:16] assemble according to his assembling of
[40:20] his body this is not like Sunday School
[40:23] where we get stars on the chart for how
[40:26] many times that you come in attendance
[40:28] or whether you know I remember the other
[40:30] church so nothing was a that Gary Avenue
[40:33] that we rented there for a while I
[40:35] remember for a period of time I always
[40:37] looked at that as a boy and I thought
[40:38] it's strange that they had a little
[40:40] placard on the wall where you could
[40:41] slide in numbers and they would always
[40:43] have numbers in attendance how many were
[40:46] in attendance and you know I think it's
[40:49] wonderful for the people of God to come
[40:51] together but we understand that it's not
[40:54] just it's not about numbers well we're
[40:58] not coming here out of numbers we are we
[41:01] are coming here to meet with God so this
[41:06] is not a social gathering we could have
[41:08] that outside at some other place but
[41:11] this is a time that we are to assemble
[41:14] our assembling together is to be an
[41:18] example of the very assembling that God
[41:22] Himself is assembling his body together
[41:25] that he has bought brought his body from
[41:28] all different walks of right life the
[41:31] Bible says when it looks upon it in
[41:33] Revelations 5 that it's out of many
[41:36] Kindred's nations and tongues and when I
[41:39] look at this it must be under the
[41:42] unction of the Holy Spirit
[41:44] that has brought us in
[41:46] to the body of Jesus Christ so I say it
[41:49] like this every time that I go to the
[41:52] house of God I am in the will of God
[41:57] every time I go to the house of God I am
[42:01] in the will of God no question I don't
[42:03] have to pray Lord is it your will for me
[42:06] to go to your house see there are some
[42:08] things that are laid out in the word
[42:10] that even Paul would talk about in 1st
[42:13] Thessalonians 5 then every man ought to
[42:15] know how to possess his vessel on the
[42:18] SATA fication and honor for this is the
[42:21] will of God there are things that times
[42:23] we pray for the will of God and then
[42:25] there are things that the will of God is
[42:27] staring us right in the face and this is
[42:31] one of those things that is the will of
[42:33] God how many knows every time you're in
[42:37] the will of God you don't always fill it
[42:39] [Laughter]
[42:41] jewelry so you know when we look back in
[42:45] this time you know gatherings themselves
[42:48] when you read through the New Testament
[42:50] you'll find many times where they would
[42:52] write and Paul would write about the
[42:55] church in churches in Corinth and then
[42:58] in Ephesus and this you know the the
[43:00] churches of the Gentiles and he would
[43:02] write to different ones salute you and
[43:05] he would write about them that are
[43:07] gathered in the house and he would write
[43:09] about them because they didn't have
[43:11] church buildings like what you and I
[43:13] have done that didn't happen too many
[43:15] hundreds of years later but what they
[43:17] had was public houses and houses that
[43:20] they would come together and they would
[43:22] come out of their houses but they would
[43:25] come together to worship the Lord Jesus
[43:28] Christ they would come together to hear
[43:32] his word and to be exhorted not to think
[43:35] about this when you're running a race
[43:37] there's some times where when you could
[43:39] get a little faint you could get a
[43:41] little discouraged you could get a
[43:43] little doubt cuz after all when God gave
[43:46] you the Holy Ghost he never took away
[43:48] your human body as a matter of fact he
[43:51] never did away with your human spirit
[43:53] you steal five times of being down you
[43:56] steal five times of sickness you
[43:58] Fite plans of discouragement you know
[44:01] sometimes when you get on the
[44:03] mountaintop you think my lord
[44:05] I never coming down from here I'm gonna
[44:07] make sure I do everything so I don't
[44:10] come down from here that's but it is a
[44:12] process within a Christians life think
[44:15] about a song if a song had only high
[44:18] notes how boring that song would be it
[44:21] would be like this apana me you know
[44:23] upon a piano and forgive me because I'm
[44:25] not any pianos but it would be simply if
[44:28] we were playing all low notes now
[44:30] realize there's some people all they
[44:32] talk about is their problems and then
[44:34] you have other people you know that
[44:35] maybe they're only talking on the high
[44:37] end but both of these scales have to go
[44:40] together to make a song and that's why
[44:42] there are high points in a Christian
[44:45] life and no points within a Christian
[44:47] life and that's why when we come to the
[44:50] house of God the Holy Spirit is present
[44:53] to exhort us and point to us that our
[44:57] labor is not in vain that the toils of
[45:01] this road will see nothing when we get
[45:05] to the end of the way it encourages you
[45:08] it it doesn't take away the problem
[45:10] you've got to face tomorrow but it just
[45:12] gives you a little a little charge and
[45:15] encouragement and exhortation of what
[45:18] you to be looking at and I appreciate
[45:21] that of the Lord so as we look at this
[45:25] you know Paul would say in Ephesus one
[45:28] one he would say Paul an apostle of
[45:30] Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
[45:33] Saints which are in Ephesus and to the
[45:35] faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you
[45:39] and peace
[45:44] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[45:46] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[45:50] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[45:53] in Christ how many of you realize that
[45:57] when we have come together prayed up
[46:02] they meant lives full of the Spirit of
[46:05] God that we're going to set in heavenly
[46:08] places that is our promise
[46:13] but God will not you know send down the
[46:15] latest drone and coming to the house and
[46:18] and pick us up and then just drop us off
[46:23] he won't do that he wants us to make a
[46:27] declaration verse 4 of Ephesians 2 but
[46:33] God who is rich in mercy for his great
[46:35] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[46:38] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[46:41] together with Christ by grace are ye
[46:44] saved what you notice what Paul is
[46:46] bringing the focus to we were dead but
[46:50] he quickened us verse 6 and hath raised
[46:54] us up together and made us sit together
[46:57] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you
[47:01] see what this quickening does the
[47:03] quickening power of God upon the seat of
[47:06] God just not isolated it brings it into
[47:09] the body because this is the purpose
[47:14] it's God assembling himself together Oh
[47:20] glory be to draw that that is why that
[47:24] brother Branham could say many times
[47:25] it's a lack of the love of God why
[47:28] because when that has taken place within
[47:30] the heart
[47:31] it is a longing to be in the house of
[47:35] God not this building so much but it is
[47:38] to come together with believers of like
[47:42] precious faith because it's here we get
[47:46] strength from the Lord and by the help
[47:48] of the Lord we want to look at that a
[47:50] little bit tonight and seeing this
[47:52] purpose that's in here because brother
[47:54] Branham would go on and I've read this
[47:56] quote to you before but there's a part
[47:58] of it here a few weeks ago just stood
[48:00] out to me in and I want to read it again
[48:02] out it's out of the message a position
[48:04] of a believer in Christ he said you're
[48:07] inside of Christ walking and then all
[48:09] the things of the world passes away and
[48:12] all the great Creed's that you had of
[48:14] this thing or that thing is all vanished
[48:16] away and your heart and mind becomes
[48:19] singular on Christ Jesus that's a great
[48:22] paradox in it
[48:23] amen that shows you have died to
[48:27] yourself and born again
[48:28] see there's one of the things it's not
[48:30] just a cleaned-up life but it's where
[48:32] that the heartbeat of that life beats
[48:35] for
[48:35] cries he's the object team man that's
[48:39] the seal of the Holy Ghost then look at
[48:43] this just as sure as church time comes
[48:47] you can't keep from coming to church now
[48:52] we can all be honest on those times when
[48:56] you II could have made more of a little
[48:58] sacrifice than we didn't refill it you
[49:03] know it's kind of like you know brother
[49:05] Joey if you and I were lifting this
[49:06] piano which you wouldn't want me you'd
[49:07] want one these other guys but if you and
[49:10] I were lifting this piano I'll tell you
[49:11] one thing brother Joey after a period of
[49:13] time to be able to look across and say
[49:15] hey brother Samuel you need to lift you
[49:19] need to lift we you need to help me here
[49:21] you need to lift you see it's a part
[49:24] about it that we in ourselves you say
[49:27] well you know I know God don't change
[49:29] this mind toward me no God listen even
[49:31] in the slothfulness you cannot change
[49:34] God's mind can't change God's mind but
[49:38] there's a point within us that it feels
[49:41] the let down why because it's that part
[49:45] of God that he put on the inside of you
[49:48] that longs to be together with God to
[49:52] come together and it's not satisfied
[49:59] streaming we can hear the word and you
[50:02] know will the word itself it's it's
[50:04] edifying its encouragement and we and we
[50:08] need to give heed to the word but but
[50:10] brother and sister you understand that
[50:12] it's not just about well I'll get this
[50:14] off the internet or I'll do this or I'll
[50:16] do that you're you're under estimating
[50:19] here what God has placed within your
[50:22] heart and the value that God sees in it
[50:25] that when you and I come together we
[50:28] need one another
[50:31] mmm say God help me to put that extra
[50:36] effort you know brother Branham says you
[50:41] show me a person he said a man or woman
[50:43] then I'll put God first in everything he
[50:46] said I'll show you a man or woman
[50:47] that'll come out on top no matter what
[50:49] the devil puts on amen a sacrifice you
[50:56] know it's a sacrifice many times that
[50:59] when we come here there's times you
[51:01] don't feel like lifting your head idiot
[51:03] that you don't love God even when it
[51:06] comes to coming to a date that you don't
[51:08] love God but there's a part about it
[51:11] that has to be brought in line because
[51:12] there's a law of V Thresh that's got to
[51:18] be brought subject and sometimes you've
[51:22] got to talk to this guy and say remember
[51:24] you are the house you're not the owner
[51:29] over the sámi you know I'm the only note
[51:37] brother Branham said for himself he said
[51:39] when his throat got the feeling a little
[51:42] bit you know Scratchy
[51:43] he said God tell brother never let him
[51:45] take the service but brother Graham said
[51:47] then something rose up and said no I
[51:50] promised him I would do it
[51:54] oh my you just can't keep from coming to
[52:00] church amen
[52:02] you know those times were we don't put
[52:04] forth the effort and we get that little
[52:06] sting in that correction thank God for
[52:08] it
[52:09] aren't you glad that that they can sting
[52:12] you and he comes we feel that correction
[52:14] within your heart and then it's a
[52:16] blessing Amen it's there on our partner
[52:20] noticed this
[52:20] he says you're just going to go if you
[52:23] have to hobble that's all you're going
[52:26] to church and wants you to look at this
[52:28] statement because the spirit itself
[52:33] bears record of gathering together in
[52:37] Christ Jesus it's not a natural thing it
[52:42] is a spiritual thing the spirit itself
[52:46] bears record of gathering together in
[52:50] Christ Jesus
[52:51] it is according to the Word of God I
[52:54] want you to think of this in Matthew
[52:57] 18:20 the Lord Jesus said for where two
[53:02] or three
[53:04] then in a crowd he ain't looking for a
[53:08] crowd for where two or three are
[53:14] gathered together in my name there am I
[53:20] in the midst of them
[53:23] he ain't sitting on the side with dirty
[53:26] feet he's in the midst he's the center
[53:30] of that service
[53:31] he's the theme of every part of that
[53:34] service like a story that you would
[53:38] write or you read a story when you get
[53:41] to the end of that story you know what
[53:44] the theme the main idea the summary what
[53:48] is it that all things were the
[53:51] supporting calf the special was about
[53:53] him
[53:54] the message about him the testimony
[53:56] about him he puts it all together every
[54:01] service he puts it together not me he
[54:10] does
[54:14] all glory be to God it's not numbers
[54:18] that attracts the presence of the Lord
[54:21] it's hearts I want you to listen I know
[54:23] the simple it's hearts that are gathered
[54:27] together in his name believers if I can
[54:32] say it like this we're believers our
[54:35] Jesus says I can take my shoes off I can
[54:42] make myself at home I'm at home now
[54:49] notice this in a very familiar scripture
[54:53] where the Lord Jesus remember he's asked
[54:56] who do men say that I am
[54:58] Simon Peter you know responds thou art
[55:02] the Christ the Son of the Living God and
[55:03] Jesus responds in this manner says
[55:06] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[55:08] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[55:10] but my father which is in heaven and i
[55:12] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[55:15] and upon this rock I will build my
[55:19] church and those very simple but Jesus
[55:24] wasn't talking about a church building
[55:27] he wasn't talking about mortar he was
[55:32] talking about his place of dwelling the
[55:36] place of worship where he will meet
[55:39] together and worship with his family
[55:42] under the shed blood that is his church
[55:47] it can be a lot of buildings that got
[55:50] that has his name on it but it's not a
[55:53] building that he's building it's the
[55:57] assembling of his body Oh a bulldozer
[56:05] could come in here some of these crazy
[56:08] people that run through stores and
[56:10] everything else could run in through a
[56:12] wall right here but rather the Church of
[56:16] the Living God the gates of Hell cannot
[56:19] prevail against it there could be a
[56:23] storm of fire whatever more that could
[56:25] wipe this building out but there is no
[56:28] storm there is no fire there is no demon
[56:31] that can upset or overthrow the Church
[56:34] of the Living God
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:40] are you in that church amen than greater
[56:45] is he that is in you glory be to God
[56:54] notice in John 17 verse 20
[56:59] neither pray I for these alone there is
[57:04] the Lord Jesus in an intercessory prayer
[57:07] but for them also which shall believe on
[57:11] me through their word
[57:14] that they may all be one as thou father
[57:20] notice as now it's not left open to
[57:22] interpretation as thou father art in me
[57:25] and I envy that they also may be one in
[57:29] us that the world may believe that thou
[57:34] hast sent me and the glory which thou
[57:38] gave us me I have given them that they
[57:42] may be one even as we are one let me
[57:45] tell you something O Lord
[57:47] oh my I'm telling you the glory of God
[57:51] is a guarantee to the seed of God this
[57:56] glory I have given them at Pentecost and
[58:01] not even come yet I'm telling you
[58:05] heavens and earth to pass away but not
[58:08] one word can pass away well I feel like
[58:15] preaching right now it wouldn't matter
[58:17] what kind of muck and gumming everything
[58:20] that the devil would try to put over
[58:22] your life and shame you and condemn you
[58:25] but yet God said there's not enough
[58:28] condemnation there's nothing great
[58:30] enough that the blood of Jesus can take
[58:34] ill because before there ever was a
[58:39] devil he was a low him and we were in
[58:49] him hmm take that one devil
[59:04] I and them now and me that they may be
[59:10] made perfect in one that the world may
[59:14] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[59:16] me as thou has loved as thou has loved
[59:20] me you've seen it I've seen it people
[59:25] that could be all together in one room
[59:27] and yet they're not one people all
[59:32] together in the same house or whatever
[59:34] and they're not one I'll tell you what
[59:36] for unity and to have oneness it takes a
[59:39] lot of sacrifice takes a lot of patience
[59:44] somebody gonna help me preach it out it
[59:47] takes a lot of overlooking it takes a
[59:52] lot of just what do you think about that
[1:00:03] what you say too bad we find the key
[1:00:18] it takes sacrifice for unity now there's
[1:00:27] no way as much as as much as we would
[1:00:31] try there's no way in the world that we
[1:00:35] could get the group of people that's
[1:00:37] here tonight and get everybody together
[1:00:39] if it was not for the Lord we're
[1:00:48] different and that's what God got in
[1:00:52] mind that but it shows there's a point
[1:00:55] within us that goes beyond our
[1:00:59] differences peculiarities and that part
[1:01:04] is God that's the part of you that's
[1:01:09] really you so there had to come the
[1:01:17] release of the true unifying power he's
[1:01:21] going to build a church by the joy but
[1:01:23] he wasn't going to build it out of
[1:01:24] mordor brother Carlos he had the right
[1:01:28] thing to bring those stones together
[1:01:31] that had been hewed out in their
[1:01:34] different ways hallelujah the unifying
[1:01:41] power of the Holy Ghost acts 2:1 and
[1:01:44] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:01:47] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:01:51] place verse 1 God did not do that for
[1:01:56] them they had to do that but it was more
[1:02:01] than just coming in a room that's still
[1:02:04] one in unity they were in one Accord and
[1:02:08] that phrase one Accord is throughout the
[1:02:12] New Testament in places especially in
[1:02:14] the book of Acts and it means that of
[1:02:16] notes that are brought together that
[1:02:19] lend themselves to form a harmony this
[1:02:23] note might say no I don't play that
[1:02:25] scale I played this scale right here I
[1:02:26] don't play that scale I play right here
[1:02:29] right but this note says no no no no no
[1:02:32] no no I was meant to be a high note I am
[1:02:35] a high note in the Symphony of God if
[1:02:39] that would have been there or would have
[1:02:42] remained they wouldn't have been in the
[1:02:44] upper room but those who were in the
[1:02:47] upper room awaiting on the fulfillment
[1:02:50] of the promise we're all in one place
[1:02:54] one mind and one of course what did that
[1:02:57] their love and expectation for the
[1:03:01] fulfillment of the promise of the coming
[1:03:05] of the Holy Ghost and what is it that
[1:03:08] brings the believers together it is the
[1:03:11] promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:14] Christ that unites us together Oh glory
[1:03:22] be to God so I don't know about you but
[1:03:26] hey I just wanna I'm glad to be part of
[1:03:28] the music sheet I don't care if I'm on
[1:03:32] the cliff I don't care if I'm on the
[1:03:34] lines or I'm below the lines as long as
[1:03:37] I'm on the paper wherever he wants to
[1:03:42] use me and because of that suddenly
[1:03:51] there came a sound from heaven know what
[1:03:57] you think you think that sound from
[1:03:58] heaven would have come if they weren't
[1:03:59] in one Accord in one place see sometimes
[1:04:02] we go to blaming things on God that
[1:04:04] ain't God's fault God said this is your
[1:04:07] responsibility it's your responsibility
[1:04:11] to get in one mind in one Accord vs. I
[1:04:16] mean you don't know sometimes I come to
[1:04:17] church I'm in an awful mess that's why
[1:04:20] we see that's why we've gotten musicians
[1:04:24] that are anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:26] and a song leader to sing well let me
[1:04:32] correct that not sing but lead you
[1:04:40] but because of this suddenly I love
[1:04:43] suddenly don't you suddenly there came a
[1:04:46] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:04:48] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:04:52] they were sitting notice before I went
[1:04:54] to them it filled the house so they're
[1:05:01] coming together in one Accord one place
[1:05:05] at the right appointed time Amen their
[1:05:11] hearts were knitted together it invited
[1:05:14] him to come in their midst and there
[1:05:17] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:05:20] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:05:24] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:05:30] Ghost filled with it and began to speak
[1:05:35] with other tongues as the Spirit gave
[1:05:38] them utterance he it wasn't just
[1:05:39] something that was on him and left him
[1:05:41] when they left it filled them the doubt
[1:05:44] said this is my place this is my place
[1:05:51] this is where our by look at this and
[1:05:56] the message the Godhead explained
[1:06:02] you see brother Brad says well we
[1:06:06] couldn't touch him there
[1:06:07] here we felt him with our hand now what
[1:06:11] did he do through the offering of that
[1:06:13] body
[1:06:14] he becomes Jehovah in us we are parts of
[1:06:20] him on the day of Pentecost the pillar
[1:06:24] fire bursted itself up and tongues of
[1:06:27] fire set upon each one showing that God
[1:06:31] was separating himself amongst his
[1:06:34] church then brethren we can only get
[1:06:39] together and bring that together then we
[1:06:43] got Jehovah in the fullness when we come
[1:06:47] together but how can we when this one
[1:06:52] speaking in tongues and got the baptism
[1:06:55] and this one and then keeping this lick
[1:06:58] of fire over here and this one let's put
[1:07:01] it together
[1:07:07] Yara put one there puzzles together with
[1:07:09] somebody you know the one on a table you
[1:07:12] know how it starts getting down to the
[1:07:14] end you've been around people that all
[1:07:18] of a sudden they and magically have a
[1:07:19] few pieces better laughs no with me
[1:07:26] don't keep that piece back from the
[1:07:29] puzzle that piece makes part of the
[1:07:33] picture and if they don't have that
[1:07:37] piece what do you look at you don't look
[1:07:40] at the puzzle and say we did it but
[1:07:42] there's a part of it that's incomplete
[1:07:44] you look around and say where is that
[1:07:47] piece at hey move your feet can I see
[1:07:49] here you sitting on it hey did you put
[1:07:51] it in your paper plate and throw it away
[1:07:52] what happened to it where's that piece
[1:07:54] you see what happens it moves us in
[1:07:57] desperation because the picture is not
[1:08:01] complete without that one little piece
[1:08:06] so don't keep back your little fire
[1:08:09] bring it together with the rest of the
[1:08:12] body oh this is my liquor fact but save
[1:08:17] grace that gave you the liquor fire gave
[1:08:20] me the liquify we did not earn it we did
[1:08:23] not matter we do not have ruled over it
[1:08:26] we are to surrender
[1:08:41] I just keep my lick back
[1:08:44] ain't gonna sing with you cuz you sing
[1:08:47] too loud every time and he knows I'm
[1:08:49] picking with it and singing with you
[1:08:52] seem through loud every time and they
[1:08:53] can't hear me sing but you say that
[1:08:57] aleko see here you take the mic and I'll
[1:09:02] sing with you hello somebody you see it
[1:09:07] ain't about the song or about air all
[1:09:11] this out here is about the little fire
[1:09:13] coming together the liquor fire in me
[1:09:22] desires to be united with a lick of fire
[1:09:24] in you this part of you and me it's
[1:09:29] tickle who this part about you part
[1:09:33] about me sometimes you say but that's
[1:09:38] the great mystery so many times we miss
[1:09:45] what the real love of God is the real
[1:09:48] love of God is not a feeling it is
[1:09:52] submission and Dominion by the word of
[1:09:56] part in our lives us submitting when
[1:10:00] brother Branham faced that bull and he
[1:10:02] faced those bees he did say in the name
[1:10:05] of Jesus I rebuke you know he submitted
[1:10:10] himself didn't take it out on the bees
[1:10:14] then take it out on the cow he submitted
[1:10:16] himself into the hand of God see the
[1:10:23] lick of fire in me and the liquor firing
[1:10:25] you you know what it desires to see him
[1:10:28] glorified one liquor fire gets together
[1:10:34] with one
[1:10:35] and another look like you know another
[1:10:39] look about bit another little pocket
[1:10:43] pretty soon it's just a Russian woman so
[1:10:50] it isn't about us it's about him oh god
[1:10:57] help us to keep that sticky part brought
[1:10:59] in subjection it's serving one another
[1:11:08] sometimes I don't feel like preaching
[1:11:09] certain things that God wants me to
[1:11:11] preach I just come to me to say it right
[1:11:14] now there are certain things that are
[1:11:15] more glorious to preach than other parts
[1:11:19] but I have to be obedient to the Lord
[1:11:23] because he knows what we have need of
[1:11:31] same thing within each of our lives so
[1:11:34] I'll just say it to you like this don't
[1:11:36] underestimate the part of Christ in you
[1:11:38] that it's necessary to the whole body
[1:11:46] quit holding out the puzzle piece when
[1:11:51] God on the day of Pentecost come down
[1:11:53] and the Bible said tongues of fire set
[1:11:56] up on each other and tongues like fire
[1:11:59] licks it was that pillar of fire
[1:12:01] separating itself and dividing itself
[1:12:05] amongst the people that we would be
[1:12:09] brethren that day you'll note that I'm
[1:12:13] in the father the father in me high in
[1:12:16] you and you in me and well were one we
[1:12:19] are one not divided not like a family we
[1:12:27] are a family God didn't want to have a
[1:12:31] family he is a family he meant what he
[1:12:38] thought of you and me he thought of
[1:12:40] himself becoming tangible hallelujah and
[1:12:47] just like a father and a mother would
[1:12:49] come together and a stream of life would
[1:12:53] come forth
[1:12:54] and from that stream of life there were
[1:12:58] the two coming together and it would
[1:13:00] bring forth a family it would bring
[1:13:03] forth progeny it would bring forth fruit
[1:13:06] of that union so has the outpouring of
[1:13:10] the Holy Ghost God's only eye that was
[1:13:14] sealed in that blood stream now poured
[1:13:17] out upon the believer it quickens that
[1:13:20] seed and it assembles us together and
[1:13:24] you realize this is my family these are
[1:13:30] my brothers these are my sisters
[1:13:40] and like any family you go through
[1:13:42] growing pains all stages toddler
[1:13:48] teenager can't pass it by nope you got
[1:13:50] to go through all stages this is why
[1:13:54] many times even in the church
[1:13:57] the church sometimes here is in the mid
[1:14:00] not sometimes but it's carrying children
[1:14:03] in the womb that have not been born
[1:14:07] careful not to injure them lest it abort
[1:14:13] you with me
[1:14:14] it's careful because the church is a
[1:14:18] womb a womb that must be brought forth
[1:14:24] now I don't know about you but you know
[1:14:26] there could have been some more probably
[1:14:28] hmm well you know all of our boys were
[1:14:31] at convenient time so I can't say it but
[1:14:34] maybe some of you who were born and I
[1:14:36] don't know me more time I was born but
[1:14:38] maybe you know a birth is sometimes it
[1:14:39] don't always come you can't plant it and
[1:14:41] say hey what this coming Saturday
[1:14:45] brother Brian you're gonna be born
[1:14:46] sure the world you're gonna be boring
[1:14:48] you can't plan that if you try to make
[1:14:52] that happen
[1:14:53] you could have end up killing me it is
[1:14:58] sovereign by God but what brings birth
[1:15:03] the word the preaching of the word the
[1:15:06] Holy Ghost coming down brings birth
[1:15:11] sometimes when the Holy Ghost as it
[1:15:14] comes like that it's like the IV drip
[1:15:16] that starts the dilating process but
[1:15:19] we're just gonna go with this it starts
[1:15:21] that whole process it's getting it ready
[1:15:23] man everything starts happening and then
[1:15:25] before you know it the waters breaking
[1:15:27] you're like oh my when that water breaks
[1:15:29] you're like it's time to go for delivery
[1:15:33] yet delivery hasn't come but yet you're
[1:15:36] looking at it all deliveries are out
[1:15:38] here hey mom dad
[1:15:39] deliveries about here you're calling
[1:15:41] people talking to them like it's 12:00
[1:15:43] noon and it's 2:00 in the morning you're
[1:15:46] so excited about one
[1:15:50] that is coming to birth
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:16:05] what is a lot I could reach on that
[1:16:07] right now but I'm going to keep on with
[1:16:09] this
[1:16:14] I believe the love of God in our hearts
[1:16:16] if it's represented in the right way it
[1:16:19] can be the right kind of a drip that'll
[1:16:24] move on that heart you look at it you
[1:16:28] might say it's working let's turn it up
[1:16:32] hey hey hey hey it's not doing what I
[1:16:35] want to do no but it's dripping just as
[1:16:36] it ought to be dripping my my we gotta
[1:16:41] go war this is the fulfillment of prayer
[1:16:47] of John 17 make them war bring into
[1:16:52] unity and to oneness into that of a
[1:16:55] family and you know you recognize the
[1:16:59] family name when it's expressed to you
[1:17:03] my brother and I have different first
[1:17:05] names we got the same last name we're
[1:17:08] part of the same body that right we are
[1:17:12] part of the same family amen there's one
[1:17:17] the great big family of God Universal
[1:17:20] the body of Jesus Christ but then there
[1:17:22] are local bodies oh ma you recognize
[1:17:28] when that family name you see the
[1:17:30] expression of that family name will not
[1:17:33] take effect upon everybody but it takes
[1:17:35] effect upon those who are a part of that
[1:17:38] family when that name is expressed that
[1:17:41] life is expressed in unfolds a mystery
[1:17:43] in their life
[1:17:44] things begin to start to unfold of who
[1:17:49] their father is who they are you with me
[1:17:54] what a time we're living in where people
[1:17:57] want to know who their daddy is and you
[1:18:01] know to think about it with the internet
[1:18:03] and all these things before I don't know
[1:18:05] what it would have been tailed before
[1:18:06] for somebody they'd have to find that
[1:18:08] out but now they're able to get a few
[1:18:11] little clicks and they're clear across
[1:18:12] the world it's something within them to
[1:18:16] what to know
[1:18:19] mmm I believe that there's a greater
[1:18:22] going on among the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:25] it's a desire to know him even as I am
[1:18:29] know amen and when that reveals it
[1:18:35] reveals the Son of God that glorified
[1:18:38] the atonement been accepted and full
[1:18:41] pardoning grace has come to me it's the
[1:18:45] coming of the Holy Ghost in the name of
[1:18:47] Jesus Christ oh my I think of this in
[1:18:52] Ephesians 5 where it speaks the husband
[1:18:57] is the head of the wife even as Christ
[1:18:58] is the head of the church and he is the
[1:19:01] savior of the body husbands love your
[1:19:06] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:19:10] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:19:13] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:19:15] washing of water by the word
[1:19:18] he loved the church
[1:19:21] his body he knew you before the
[1:19:27] foundation of the world and therefore he
[1:19:31] gave himself to redeem us amen he left
[1:19:36] the church so he gave himself amen the
[1:19:41] church was not even in existence at the
[1:19:44] time when he gave himself but he gave
[1:19:48] what was necessary to bring into
[1:19:52] manifestation his church his body just
[1:19:57] like Adam was put into a deep sleep on
[1:20:01] Calvary our Savior entered into a deep
[1:20:05] sleep is that right his side was open
[1:20:09] and out of his side went water and blood
[1:20:14] and spirits is that right
[1:20:18] out of the side of haddem he took his
[1:20:22] bride and out of the side of Christ he
[1:20:26] took his bride and he's been assembling
[1:20:30] his bride together down through the ages
[1:20:33] to himself it's not a man-made work it's
[1:20:39] God at work aren't you glad before the
[1:20:44] foundation of the world he looked beyond
[1:20:47] all of our mistakes all of our faults
[1:20:52] all of our shortcomings hold my little
[1:20:58] attitudes he left me on all of that lord
[1:21:08] help us
[1:21:12] he looked beyond that in order to become
[1:21:15] one with us so the church itself it is
[1:21:23] the called out body of believers that
[1:21:24] are baptized into the body of Jesus
[1:21:26] Christ by the Holy Ghost of which that
[1:21:29] revelation is Jesus Christ made manifest
[1:21:32] in and through our lives it is not an
[1:21:35] idea or a building but a gathering of
[1:21:41] believers by the Holy Ghost in him in
[1:21:47] Acts chapter 8 verse 1
[1:21:50] i'ma try to get us to a place here in
[1:21:53] Acts chapter 8 verse 1 and Saul was
[1:21:57] consenting unto his death and at that
[1:22:00] time there was a great persecution
[1:22:02] against the church which was at
[1:22:05] Jerusalem the church which was at
[1:22:07] Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:22:10] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[1:22:13] and Samaria except the Apostles and
[1:22:16] devout men carried Stephen to his burial
[1:22:19] and made great lamentation over him
[1:22:24] that just stands out to me right now
[1:22:26] devout men who glory that just jumps off
[1:22:32] the page right now these were men but
[1:22:36] enjoyed that after here he was left he
[1:22:40] was found these were devout men
[1:22:52] the men said you know what we better
[1:22:54] stop being Freddie cats because they
[1:22:56] weren't the first one after to the women
[1:22:59] were and the men were this ones that
[1:23:02] said nah what you're sayin ain't right
[1:23:05] come on now I'm talking Bible see Jesus
[1:23:11] given position where it belongs you
[1:23:14] understand me now so now here's some
[1:23:16] devout men that are standing there now I
[1:23:21] don't know if they waited till everybody
[1:23:24] left no doubt they did
[1:23:28] it might have been nightfall it doesn't
[1:23:31] matter when it was but they what gonna
[1:23:34] leave their brother under a rock pile
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:39] this is one they broke bread with this
[1:23:42] is one they fell a shift with devout men
[1:23:47] rose up had to pull away the stones
[1:23:53] Stephen was a man full of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] full of wisdom he was the first deacon
[1:23:58] in the church they were moving that away
[1:24:01] or what a loss to the Church of
[1:24:03] Jerusalem but devout men carried Stephen
[1:24:10] to his burial and made great lamentation
[1:24:13] over him you think it was sorrow that
[1:24:18] hid their hearts it was one of them had
[1:24:21] gone this was one who's good on the
[1:24:27] front lines if I could just have a
[1:24:31] little bit of license to preach a little
[1:24:33] bit this is one who was right in the
[1:24:36] midst of everything that God was doing
[1:24:39] he wasn't in the forefront but he was
[1:24:41] just to be a part of it he was as you
[1:24:45] would say all-in never had to worry
[1:24:51] about Stephen Stephen is he on fire for
[1:24:54] God this man had a testimony he had a
[1:25:00] testimony even though that may be the
[1:25:03] rest of them could weep and cry and say
[1:25:06] what are we going to do or God what
[1:25:10] Stephen Lord he's he's been such a
[1:25:12] faithful part of the church he's been
[1:25:14] one Lord that know now he called me how
[1:25:16] many other people has he called how many
[1:25:18] other people has he checked on how many
[1:25:20] other people has he done this for cuz he
[1:25:23] was a deacon you know hello somebody he
[1:25:26] was a deacon and the deacons were to
[1:25:29] care for the people I better leave that
[1:25:31] alone tonight they were to care for the
[1:25:35] people so that the ministry could be
[1:25:37] given to study and pray
[1:25:42] somebody say help me Lord
[1:25:46] did you see if we can really look at it
[1:25:49] as a body don't just wait for the
[1:25:51] Deacons don't just wait for somebody
[1:25:52] else you do your part that lit a fire
[1:25:57] that's moving in your heart that brings
[1:25:59] somebody to your attention do something
[1:26:01] about it
[1:26:03] amen Carl reach out to them was just
[1:26:10] literal me well you're under estimating
[1:26:12] the lick of fire in verse 3 I'm not
[1:26:21] gonna keep you here I'd love to
[1:26:28] we've got to work in that school in the
[1:26:30] morning verse three asks for Saul he
[1:26:35] made havoc of the church entering him to
[1:26:40] every house and hailing men and women
[1:26:43] committed them to prison so the check
[1:26:48] this was not a building it was the
[1:26:51] people who made up that gathering the
[1:26:57] body of believers I wonder how many
[1:27:01] houses they came to I seen you I seen
[1:27:06] you hanging around with James no not me
[1:27:08] yeah you know I've always thought James
[1:27:10] a little strange little off
[1:27:13] bless his heart I mean I just those are
[1:27:18] the kind of no doubt they probably
[1:27:19] thrust through out of way cuz they were
[1:27:22] as green as green and yellow as Leola
[1:27:24] could be when the time of persecution
[1:27:27] came it shows who's who so I wonder how
[1:27:35] many dollars they said you got the wrong
[1:27:37] door I thought I've seen you going down
[1:27:42] there with that group no not me I I just
[1:27:44] went along sometimes because you know
[1:27:45] sometimes they well you know they had
[1:27:47] fellowship afterwards and kind of like
[1:27:49] their chicken and rice and things like
[1:27:51] Adam one of these days you might get
[1:27:57] caught there's Samuel don't that bother
[1:28:03] you that somebody would come for chicken
[1:28:05] and rice no it don't bother me but
[1:28:09] neither do I go out invite the community
[1:28:10] either this is not a spaghetti supper in
[1:28:16] a chicken dinner that's not why we have
[1:28:18] it we have it to come together and to
[1:28:20] have a meal with one another and have
[1:28:24] fellowship
[1:28:28] and after all I happen believe the
[1:28:31] gospel is more than just in the four
[1:28:33] walls of a church if the gospel ain't
[1:28:36] walking in human flesh then you might
[1:28:39] want to check what's on the inside of
[1:28:41] you
[1:28:43] cuz the liquor v brings the word to life
[1:28:46] and it makes you it makes us call
[1:28:50] partners in Redemption brother Samuel I
[1:28:59] can't believe it
[1:29:01] you would have fellowship and let
[1:29:04] somebody come through a fellowship
[1:29:06] dinner
[1:29:06] that's not even believer okay let's use
[1:29:09] your prophets quotes on you brother
[1:29:13] Branham would hunt both a man called
[1:29:14] Burt and all his rotten things that he
[1:29:19] would do he won the only one but Brendan
[1:29:22] random wasn't with them because they
[1:29:24] were rotten he was with them because he
[1:29:27] lacked the hunt the man was a guide and
[1:29:30] the Prophet was praying for that man's
[1:29:32] soul I tell you there's not enough soul
[1:29:36] travail if there was more travail of
[1:29:39] soul than this of the mouth or my we'd
[1:29:43] be a lot further down the road Oh help
[1:29:49] me Lord
[1:30:01] here's Paul
[1:30:04] here's Paul's recount his testimony you
[1:30:10] know Paul he recounts us three times
[1:30:12] about the road to Damascus
[1:30:19] and each one of the times two of the
[1:30:21] three times as he records that he says
[1:30:26] that that light appeared to him and said
[1:30:28] on Jesus whom thou persecuted sometimes
[1:30:32] the audience you're in just merits a few
[1:30:35] more extra words in verse seven I fell
[1:30:39] into the ground and heard a voice saying
[1:30:40] unto me Saul Saul why persecutest on me
[1:30:43] and I answered who art thou Lord and he
[1:30:48] said unto me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom
[1:30:53] thou persecute us it was necessary in
[1:30:56] this audience for it to be identified
[1:30:59] the one you crucified and buried rose
[1:31:03] again and that saved Jesus is now
[1:31:07] dwelling in a minute members bodies
[1:31:15] where they mean that where they meeting
[1:31:18] where believers get together well what
[1:31:22] are they doing when they get together
[1:31:23] they're feasting on the unfailing body
[1:31:28] Word of the Son of Man well why do they
[1:31:32] do when they get together all one might
[1:31:34] sing one might testify want to preach
[1:31:41] really yeah because you see this is not
[1:31:44] the orchestration a man this is the
[1:31:47] assembling of God and His people of God
[1:31:53] I think of how brother Bram says in
[1:31:55] mighty God unveiled before us I love
[1:31:57] their quote he said this convention is a
[1:32:00] lot different than a lot of other
[1:32:02] conventions he said we just come
[1:32:04] together and we just present ourselves
[1:32:07] not knowing what God's gonna do but he
[1:32:12] comes among us and does what God does
[1:32:16] and so we can expect when this look of
[1:32:19] ours together this look of fires
[1:32:21] together God's gonna be a month
[1:32:27] let's just pause there tonight
[1:32:31] Lord Jesus let me live
[1:32:36] but surrender heart and life now let me
[1:32:40] keep back that liquor far from you
[1:32:42] brother Joey you say brothers say no I
[1:32:45] don't need you yeah I know you may not
[1:32:47] need this guy but yet in one way if this
[1:32:49] guy rubs you you need me you need me you
[1:32:52] need me because you need me to show what
[1:32:55] greenness lays in your life just as much
[1:32:58] as I need you to rub me but that ain't
[1:33:03] the part that ain't the part about it
[1:33:04] it's the lick of fire on the inside that
[1:33:08] gives Dominion to says shut up this
[1:33:14] ain't this service ain't about you I
[1:33:20] know you may not like that song but
[1:33:23] you're here and you're gonna worship
[1:33:28] they may not be your favorite text but
[1:33:31] it's mine you gettin burnt but I'll be
[1:33:35] enraptured let's stand this thing
[1:33:45] the assembling of ourselves together all
[1:33:50] the Redeem body of Jesus Christ his
[1:33:52] church
[1:33:58] we need one another
[1:34:01] we need one another
[1:34:11] every part is so vital let me read you
[1:34:15] this
[1:34:20] but the RAM says in the message
[1:34:21] absolutely we are not a divided people
[1:34:25] we've got to be in unity because each
[1:34:29] one of us is holding a part of God we
[1:34:36] must come together and then the pillar
[1:34:39] fire is manifested in the wholeness in
[1:34:42] the fullness of it it's kind of like
[1:34:45] puzzle pieces
[1:34:50] if there's a hundred puzzle pieces and
[1:34:52] there's only five pieces on the table
[1:34:55] you look at and you say it's not
[1:34:58] complete gotta have all the pieces
[1:35:02] together we must come together and then
[1:35:07] the pillar fire is manifested in the
[1:35:09] wholeness and the fullness of it when
[1:35:12] his church y'all believe this when his
[1:35:16] church sets together in heavenly places
[1:35:20] then the fullness of the power of God is
[1:35:24] in the church each one of us holding
[1:35:28] spiritual gifts and spiritual offices
[1:35:32] coming together brings that pillar of
[1:35:35] fire back again
[1:35:41] I want to give
[1:35:44] how about you
[1:35:46] I want to give I want to surrender
[1:35:48] not-not-not oh I gotta give my no no to
[1:35:52] give my part means for me to die that he
[1:35:54] might step forth I want to surrender
[1:36:01] that lick of fire he did
[1:36:05] he did
[1:36:07] he did that we might all be together
[1:36:14] oh I don't want to I don't know about
[1:36:15] you I believe your heart beats the same
[1:36:17] way too we don't want we didn't just
[1:36:19] come here just to be seen we did not
[1:36:21] just come here just just to come to a
[1:36:23] building we've come to surrender because
[1:36:27] you don't know that you're liq a fire
[1:36:31] anointing with another lick a fire
[1:36:33] anointing with another liquor fire
[1:36:35] whether Bram says there's more amongst
[1:36:37] than and that very chain of faith
[1:36:41] getting started no telling what can
[1:36:44] happen
[1:36:45] we're brother Samuel what about what
[1:36:47] about my need let us consider one
[1:36:52] another so you mean the coming together
[1:36:57] is not about my needs
[1:37:01] no not primarily it's about him and the
[1:37:07] rest of your brothers and sisters but
[1:37:11] the joy I've said this many times for
[1:37:13] the herb I've said this many times now
[1:37:15] every time I come to the house of God I
[1:37:16] believe that what God is going to say
[1:37:19] God's got something in it for me brother
[1:37:21] Brian I believe that I don't have to
[1:37:23] pick and choose I know the Holy Spirit's
[1:37:25] gonna but sometimes I've prayed it just
[1:37:29] like this I said Lord I've got needs but
[1:37:34] I would rather you meet the needs of my
[1:37:38] brothers and sisters I don't tell you
[1:37:41] that to make myself anything that's my
[1:37:44] desire I thank God if we all come
[1:37:50] together that way lord have mercy what's
[1:37:53] going to happen
[1:37:54] [Music]

[1:38:19] the power that has come to our lives to
[1:38:22] put us into service Lord here tonight
[1:38:27] your children redeemed by your blood
[1:38:30] Lord I've gathered or the sacrifices but
[1:38:35] I know that that's not what they're
[1:38:36] putting before you I see it Lord I see
[1:38:39] it to me it encourages me it encourages
[1:38:44] me Lord God I thank you for that Lord
[1:38:49] there's hearts that love you
[1:38:52] so much Lord that they would sacrifice
[1:38:56] and go beyond the easy and they would
[1:39:01] make the effort but there's something
[1:39:04] greater Lord there because they just
[1:39:05] didn't come we've not just come to
[1:39:07] church just to come to a building the
[1:39:11] assembling of ourselves together you did
[1:39:13] not do it for us but you call us
[1:39:17] together and you admonish us don't
[1:39:20] forsake to do it don't neglect don't
[1:39:22] count it a light thing don't don't make
[1:39:25] it an optional thing the lick of fire in
[1:39:29] your heart it's necessary to come
[1:39:34] together with the other licks of fire to
[1:39:39] make more of that pillar of fire in our
[1:39:42] midst

[1:40:36] that extra effort and we just kind of
[1:40:38] gave in and just kind of reasoned why
[1:40:41] that it may not be so important forgive
[1:40:43] us for that Lord and help us Lord God to
[1:40:49] realize that this coming together it's
[1:40:51] not about us it's about my brothers and
[1:40:55] sisters
