[45:59] for his Mercy once again and so good to
[46:02] see each and every one of you and amen
[46:05] your your faces part of
[46:08] them and uh you you know you have to do
[46:12] accordingly I know sometimes those
[46:13] things get a little bit annoying and
[46:16] things like that so I don't want nobody
[46:18] passing out in here but um I than you we
[46:22] we know what to do and we just you know
[46:25] the thing is we're just thankful that
[46:26] God
[46:27] would permit us to come back
[46:30] together amen we have faith in only one
[46:32] thing and that's in him that's where our
[46:35] faith and our trust lies it's it's just
[46:37] that's it right there it wouldn't matter
[46:40] how it would not matter how effective or
[46:42] how good of no matter you know if you
[46:46] were sick and medicine and we appreciate
[46:48] that you wouldn't want the doctor to
[46:49] give you sugar pills but you know when
[46:52] it all comes down to it it it it isn't
[46:54] our faith is not resting in that our
[46:57] faith is resting solemnly and completely
[47:00] in the Lord Jesus
[47:02] Christ amen and you know it's just like
[47:05] God he spoke it over and over in his
[47:08] word and we you remember back in the
[47:10] first part of this year we were we were
[47:12] ministering for some Thursday nights and
[47:15] never got all the way finished with it
[47:17] but on healing and how that at the
[47:20] Waters of Mara he was right there and I
[47:24] I there's one scripture that I love it
[47:26] it it follow follow through the whole
[47:28] whole Cannon of scripture but God said
[47:31] in Exodus 23 when he brought them out he
[47:35] said I will bless your bread and your
[47:38] water and I will take sickness from
[47:41] among you he never said it wouldn't come
[47:45] he never said we wouldn't get sick he
[47:47] never said that so where is our faith
[47:51] our faith is in what he said I'll take
[47:54] it
[47:55] away I'll take it
[47:57] away s how will we deal if this comes
[48:00] about or this comes about in our life he
[48:02] said he will take it away healing itself
[48:07] is already it's a finished work and
[48:10] that's where our trust is at it's
[48:11] completely in the finished work of the
[48:14] Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm so glad about
[48:17] that aren't you I mean it it just gives
[48:19] us a real rest and a real trust and and
[48:22] a real peace in the midst of that amen
[48:25] God bless you I want to make mention we
[48:27] won't have service here this Thursday um
[48:31] so you just do
[48:33] accordingly and uh sure many some of you
[48:37] may be traveling in in other places but
[48:39] um let's just let's look to the Lord

[51:33] oppression drive away oh God every
[51:38] hold oh God we ask it in the name of
[51:43] Jesus Christ for the glory of
[51:47] God
[51:50] Amen let's look in the word of the Lord
[51:52] this morning thank you musicians amen
[51:56] James chapter 2 I want to go back
[51:58] there we could this
[52:01] morning and I'm just going to read just
[52:04] go in begin at verse 20 here this
[52:16] morning James
[52:19] writing by the spirit of
[52:21] God wilt thou know oh vain man that
[52:26] faith without
[52:28] works is
[52:31] dead now evidently there
[52:35] were
[52:37] individuals even potentially Believers
[52:40] or those who were there that they
[52:42] believed I mean they were
[52:44] gathered with the church but see the the
[52:49] goodness and the grace of God the love
[52:51] of God would reach down and help them to
[52:54] see that Faith itself
[52:57] that has no works is
[53:01] dead and so he's speaking of O vain vain
[53:04] means empty so there is that that God
[53:08] would be encouraging them to that's
[53:11] something greater than what they would
[53:14] have we understand intellectual Faith as
[53:17] far as human Faith there's a beginning
[53:19] right there and in order for that to
[53:22] even be stirred up even in our hearts in
[53:26] going in the right direction it takes
[53:29] God coming down and stirring that up and
[53:33] drawing us to that
[53:35] PL oh vain man that faith without works
[53:39] is dead was not Abraham Our Father
[53:43] justified by works when he had offered
[53:48] Isaac his son upon the
[53:50] altar seest how thou how Faith wrought
[53:55] with his work
[53:57] and by works was Faith made perfect now
[54:04] James is not
[54:06] writing about works of the law Paul
[54:10] separated that out that is not what
[54:11] James is speaking as though that a
[54:13] person is trying to make themselves
[54:16] pleasing or to
[54:18] perfects but he's speaking of The Works
[54:22] which is the work that is done by the
[54:26] faith of God operating in the
[54:30] light so notice the scripture seest thou
[54:35] how Faith wrought with his works and by
[54:38] works was Faith made perfect so what a
[54:41] union and the scripture was
[54:45] fulfilled which saith Abraham believed
[54:49] God and it was imputed unto him for
[54:53] righteousness and he was called the the
[54:56] friend of
[54:58] God you see then how that by works a man
[55:02] is Justified and not by faith
[55:06] only likewise also was not Rahab the
[55:09] Harlot justified by works when she
[55:14] had received the
[55:18] messengers and had sent them out another
[55:21] way remember she never met
[55:24] Joshua but she received
[55:27] those who carried the word from
[55:32] Joshua glory be to God and sent them out
[55:35] another way for as the body without the
[55:39] spirit is dead so faith without works is
[55:45] dead
[55:47] Also may God bless you bless the reading
[55:49] of the word as you're being
[55:55] seated brother Brandon would say it like
[55:57] this some of these quotes I I don't have
[55:59] in there because I've just got so much
[56:01] in front of me
[56:03] here he would speak and admonish to the
[56:07] believer I want you to get built up in
[56:11] the whole these holy Oracles of God the
[56:14] oracles is that which is spoken by
[56:18] God it's
[56:20] no this word that God has sent to you
[56:23] and I this is not the thoughts of a
[56:27] man it's the word of God God has
[56:34] spoken it's the holy Oracles of almighty
[56:39] God and when God speaks there are lives
[56:44] that are to be moved by that word and
[56:48] come into expression you see it clear
[56:50] back from Genesis 1 the word was spoken
[56:53] and then you see the word come to pass
[56:56] the manifestation itself let there be
[56:59] light light came forth that was the
[57:03] interpretation
[57:04] manifesting what was spoken it was God
[57:09] manifesting his word so God just doesn't
[57:13] speak his word and then leave the God
[57:16] who speaks his word is present to
[57:19] fulfill it so it's the holy Oracles of
[57:23] God in the faith the faith of this the
[57:26] faith it's going to take more faith than
[57:29] ever was in any age for this has to be
[57:34] rapturing Faith to be taken
[57:37] out so he says we want you to believe in
[57:41] all that you have seen heard the word
[57:45] being preached the signs and wonders
[57:47] that you have seen done notice he's
[57:48] taking all of this together all of this
[57:51] has been working for one purpose that
[57:57] faith that Faith might come Faith might
[58:01] be built it's God who's doing it me just
[58:04] say it like this brother Brandon would
[58:06] say it clearly in um uh false anointing
[58:10] was at the end time he said it wasn't me
[58:13] that appeared down there on the
[58:15] river he said I'm not the one who does
[58:18] these
[58:19] things I just happened to be standing
[58:23] there when he came and did
[58:26] it how many can say the same thing about
[58:29] your
[58:32] life it isn't what I knew it's what I
[58:37] surrendered myself
[58:41] to so he says we want you to accumulate
[58:44] all this together in your heart now in
[58:47] John 6 verse
[58:50] 28 Jesus here is
[58:54] expressing here to them them when they
[58:57] saw Miracles taking
[59:00] place and he says they said to him what
[59:04] shall we do that we might work the works
[59:09] of God now I want you to just catch this
[59:11] here they're asking this question now
[59:14] what they've seen they've seen
[59:17] miracles in this in this particular
[59:19] passage they have witnessed the loaves
[59:23] of bread being multiplied
[59:26] they've witnessed the phenomenon the
[59:29] Supernatural and they came to seek after
[59:32] him but Jesus tells them you're not
[59:35] coming after me because you saw the
[59:39] Miracles it's because you ate and were
[59:44] full it it you know when you look at
[59:48] this it almost is so much for your mind
[59:50] to think how could they not be taken
[59:53] more with the miraculous
[59:56] than the
[59:59] bread they were more taken with the
[1:00:02] bread than they were the miraculous that
[1:00:04] was only to let them know and identify
[1:00:08] who is the one who is
[1:00:12] present who can do these things but
[1:00:17] God but they're asking even when Jesus
[1:00:20] would say labor not for meat that
[1:00:23] perisheth
[1:00:26] but labor for that that meat that which
[1:00:29] God gives labor for that which that of
[1:00:33] the son of man giveth for him hath God
[1:00:38] the Father
[1:00:40] sealed the father has sealed him and his
[1:00:43] put the witness the stamp his
[1:00:46] Vindication that this meat is the meat
[1:00:50] that you need to
[1:00:54] receive what shall we do that we might
[1:00:57] work the works of God they're not all
[1:00:59] they're thinking about is is these
[1:01:01] things happening Miracles taking place
[1:01:04] or I can do this that this can be done
[1:01:06] and I it was this this question had
[1:01:09] nothing to do with the purpose of
[1:01:12] God but Jesus taking this this question
[1:01:17] because in their heart remember the the
[1:01:19] word of God discerns the thoughts and
[1:01:22] intents of the
[1:01:23] heart God's word comes into heart that
[1:01:26] having the right motive and right
[1:01:28] objective and let me just say this to
[1:01:30] you this is the mercy of God you or I if
[1:01:33] not for him coming and moving upon our
[1:01:36] midst we wouldn't have the right motive
[1:01:38] or right objective but he has come and
[1:01:42] that same God who veils himself in the
[1:01:44] pillar of fire he has come to change our
[1:01:48] objectives he he came to change and and
[1:01:50] move around in our life than even
[1:01:53] Ambitions that you and I had in life
[1:01:56] those Ambitions he begins to remove that
[1:01:59] from being the priority of our life to
[1:02:02] where now it's him coming into be the
[1:02:04] Center focus of our life that's him
[1:02:07] doing
[1:02:09] that so what shall we do that we might
[1:02:12] work the works of God and Jesus answered
[1:02:14] and said unto them this is the work of
[1:02:19] God that ye believe on him whom he has
[1:02:22] sent they're wanting to know what do we
[1:02:23] do to work the works
[1:02:25] and he says this is the work of God
[1:02:30] alight what is the work of God that you
[1:02:33] would believe on him whom he hath
[1:02:38] sent now brother Brown will pick this up
[1:02:42] and he'll speak about the works of God
[1:02:44] and he says he'll say it like this he
[1:02:46] says now the works of God has many
[1:02:48] phases to it he says as for example he
[1:02:52] said even he said in building a church
[1:02:55] he said that would be be a work of God
[1:02:57] evangelism that would be a work of God
[1:03:00] healing that's a work of God above all
[1:03:04] the salvation of souls that's a work of
[1:03:06] God and he's here he is he's elaborating
[1:03:09] these are all works of God healing and
[1:03:14] many many different things gifts of the
[1:03:16] Spirit they're all different Outlets or
[1:03:19] phases as brother bam called it but you
[1:03:21] see now when we come into this here it's
[1:03:24] not just of of of the phases but now
[1:03:28] brother Bram hones into it and he says
[1:03:31] now let's look he said at what the
[1:03:33] prophet spoke that there should be light
[1:03:37] in the evening time what is light the
[1:03:39] Bible says God is
[1:03:42] light God spoke in the beginning and he
[1:03:45] says let there be light his word became
[1:03:49] the very source of of energizing and
[1:03:53] bringing forth life God is light they
[1:03:57] that were in darkness you know the
[1:03:59] scripture they were in darkness Isaiah
[1:04:01] prophesied of it and here it is
[1:04:03] fulfilled in the ministry of the Lord
[1:04:05] Jesus and it's going on yet today they
[1:04:08] who were in darkness saw a great light
[1:04:10] spring up among them what light is this
[1:04:13] this is a light that comes as it did in
[1:04:16] Genesis 1 to bring seeds to life push
[1:04:20] back the waters it is the same light of
[1:04:22] the Gospel that comes to bring forth for
[1:04:26] those seeds that he already planted in
[1:04:29] this
[1:04:31] Earth so he brings it to a place to we
[1:04:35] must identify the hour and the
[1:04:37] Fulfillment of the scripture he says
[1:04:40] we've had enough light for people to
[1:04:42] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:04:44] their savior notice enough like two
[1:04:46] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:04:48] their savior we've had enough enough
[1:04:50] light to turn out great Ministries he
[1:04:52] said we've had enough light to do
[1:04:54] charitable work
[1:04:56] but yet notice he's identifying this
[1:04:58] here in 1959 but yet he says we've not
[1:05:02] had or seen the light like like it was
[1:05:05] at the beginning speaking of when it
[1:05:08] fell on the day of Pentecost until just
[1:05:11] recently this is the promise there shall
[1:05:15] be light in the evening time we are at
[1:05:20] the end of
[1:05:23] civilization we're at the end you see
[1:05:26] God in his Mercy is announcing this in
[1:05:30] his word this is the evening
[1:05:33] time not maybe not perhaps this is the
[1:05:37] evening time we have arrived oh my so
[1:05:42] that same light as he would go on to say
[1:05:45] that same light that same holy spirit
[1:05:48] that moved there in the same
[1:05:50] characteristics in that first church
[1:05:52] this same gospel is come now in the
[1:05:55] fullness of the power of the
[1:05:57] resurrection of Jesus Christ we're
[1:05:59] living in the setting of the Sun and he
[1:06:02] ties this together and I want you to
[1:06:03] catch this here because we are living in
[1:06:06] a time when we've been down Through the
[1:06:08] Ages this is why uh John under the
[1:06:12] inspiration would say beloved try every
[1:06:15] spirit and see whether it be of God or
[1:06:18] not this is why Jesus could say in
[1:06:20] Matthew 24 that there would be many
[1:06:23] false Christ not false Jesus false
[1:06:27] anointed ones because here the miracles
[1:06:30] of god being done and yet it's an
[1:06:32] unclean
[1:06:34] vessel a life that is not being lived by
[1:06:37] the word is that right the what are they
[1:06:39] doing it by it's not the men doing that
[1:06:42] it is there that anointing that is upon
[1:06:45] them but notice the the Miracles are
[1:06:48] done but yet it is not a life that
[1:06:50] corresponds with the word in other words
[1:06:53] the love of the world is still in them
[1:06:57] I'm just going to preach you might say
[1:06:59] well they don't drink or they don't
[1:07:01] smoke let me just tell you something
[1:07:03] Deus forsook Paul and he did not go out
[1:07:06] into nightclubs but Deus having loved
[1:07:09] this present World why because the love
[1:07:13] of the father was not in
[1:07:20] him Hallelujah so the here we've seen so
[1:07:24] many different you see Minds Hey
[1:07:26] listen if I can say this like this and
[1:07:29] you understand right here among the
[1:07:32] bride is not the only place where
[1:07:34] Miracles are
[1:07:37] happening I mean there's there's
[1:07:39] different testimonies and different
[1:07:41] reports okay but here's the thing here's
[1:07:44] what's different what separates from
[1:07:48] everything else is the sign of the
[1:07:52] Messiah the sign of the Messiah is that
[1:07:55] word in a man now that word is in a body
[1:08:00] of
[1:08:01] Believers watch time brother Brandon
[1:08:03] places this he said we're standing here
[1:08:05] in this Messiah sign remember this is
[1:08:07] what he prophesied in Luke 17 was that
[1:08:11] as it was in the days of Noah taking us
[1:08:14] clear back to the tent door of Abraham
[1:08:17] it's a messiah sign here was a man
[1:08:20] standing before the tent door and this
[1:08:22] man showed up and Abraham wrecked
[1:08:25] recognized that this is
[1:08:28] God this is the one I've talked to and
[1:08:31] that same God that's spoke to him by
[1:08:35] word now stood before his tent door he
[1:08:39] fed him a calf fed him bread and milk
[1:08:43] and that same one was standing right
[1:08:45] there and called them by the name that
[1:08:48] he had revealed in Genesis 17 Abraham
[1:08:53] where is thy wife
[1:08:57] Sarah he never even regarded Hagar as a
[1:09:02] wife see it's passed he's not looking
[1:09:05] upon the churches it's time for the
[1:09:08] bride it's time for the
[1:09:11] wife are you with
[1:09:14] me you see I just let me just say and
[1:09:18] point this very
[1:09:19] clearly because when he says this here
[1:09:23] it's a messiah sign now listen just he
[1:09:25] says Healing The Sick wasn't exactly the
[1:09:28] sign of the Messiah anyone knows that
[1:09:31] Healing The Sick is not the sign of the
[1:09:34] Messiah for the prophets healed the sick
[1:09:37] years before the Messiah come is that
[1:09:41] right many places in the scripture but
[1:09:43] he says and in the last days Healing The
[1:09:46] Sick in this great Revival of Divine
[1:09:49] Healing is not one of the outstanding
[1:09:52] signs of the coming of Jesus notice it's
[1:09:55] not one of the outstanding signs of the
[1:09:58] coming of Jesus yet many ran and run
[1:10:01] after
[1:10:03] it you understand what I'm saying it is
[1:10:07] it is a signification it is a sign that
[1:10:11] the Living God is there but notice
[1:10:13] notice it goes on to say for we've had
[1:10:16] Divine Healing through the 2,000 years
[1:10:19] since the going away of the Messiah at
[1:10:21] Pentecost or Jerusalem and the returning
[1:10:24] of him again but there was a sign and
[1:10:27] that was the sign of the Messiah and the
[1:10:30] closing of the
[1:10:32] age and he goes on to say now he came
[1:10:37] he's he's bringing this down he came to
[1:10:39] his own his own received him
[1:10:41] not so he went to the Gentiles you see
[1:10:45] Jesus will come to those who's looking
[1:10:47] for
[1:10:48] him those who BL would say wanting to be
[1:10:52] saved he'll save
[1:10:53] them those who desire healing he heals
[1:10:58] them he makes this statement he never
[1:11:02] pushes
[1:11:03] himself you have to do that you're on
[1:11:07] the basis of a free moral
[1:11:13] agency now back into the scripture of
[1:11:16] John 6 what shall we do that we might
[1:11:20] work the works of
[1:11:22] God Jesus answered and said unto him him
[1:11:26] this is the work of God that ye believe
[1:11:29] on him whom he has sent let me just
[1:11:32] pause I just feel this being pressed on
[1:11:34] my heart what we just read in right here
[1:11:37] with the Messiah sign by no way by no
[1:11:40] means does that do away with healing of
[1:11:43] the sick you should be balanced in that
[1:11:44] by
[1:11:45] now he still heals the sick we still
[1:11:49] rejoice in that but what is being
[1:11:51] announced is is that was not an
[1:11:53] outstanding sign of the coming of the
[1:11:56] Lord Jesus it's been done for 2,000
[1:11:59] years yet the sign of the Messiah to be
[1:12:02] able to discern that thought which is in
[1:12:05] the heart to see that God and let me
[1:12:07] just say this to you right now there's
[1:12:09] not been for 2,000 years one ministry
[1:12:13] that's paralleled to the Lord Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ as the ministry of William
[1:12:18] brandham not parallel brother brandom
[1:12:20] said it in the message token he said he
[1:12:23] had more success and he said notice said
[1:12:25] he had more success in my Earthly
[1:12:28] Ministry than his
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:33] own
[1:12:35] hallelujah amen healing is the
[1:12:38] children's
[1:12:40] bread but the sign of theiah to
[1:12:43] recognize who is this Among
[1:12:46] Us who is this that knows my
[1:12:50] name who is this who knows about me it's
[1:12:53] as though they're telling the story of
[1:12:56] my life that I never knew but yet it's
[1:12:59] fitting my life perfectly who is
[1:13:07] this this is the work of God that you
[1:13:11] believe on him whom he hath
[1:13:17] sent brother Bram would say it like this
[1:13:20] the Son of God himself he said believe
[1:13:23] me for the very work
[1:13:25] sake he put an emphasis on his own Works
[1:13:29] while here on Earth The Works that he
[1:13:32] did were ordained of God to inspire
[1:13:37] faith in
[1:13:40] him the works of God were ordained to
[1:13:45] inspire faith in
[1:13:50] him Nicodemus comes to
[1:13:53] Jesus we know
[1:13:55] that thou art a great
[1:13:57] man thou art a man come from God for no
[1:14:01] man can do such things Miracles except
[1:14:05] God be with him well we could preach on
[1:14:10] that one that's Joshua 1 I'll be with
[1:14:13] you that's what God told Moses I'll be
[1:14:16] with
[1:14:17] you is that right God's promise of being
[1:14:21] with that in itself even what can you
[1:14:24] the say even the things that was coming
[1:14:26] out of their mouth was also going to
[1:14:28] stand in judgment against
[1:14:32] them they knew this was of
[1:14:37] God is that right his own Works
[1:14:41] testified who he was notice Jesus could
[1:14:44] say in in John 10:37 if I do not the
[1:14:48] works of my father believe me not but if
[1:14:50] I do though you believe me not believe
[1:14:52] the works that you may know and believe
[1:14:54] that the the father is in me and I in
[1:14:58] him John 14:9 Jesus said have I been so
[1:15:02] long with you yet thou Hast not known me
[1:15:04] Phillip he that hath seen me has seen
[1:15:06] the father how sayest then show us the
[1:15:09] father oh my show us the father he said
[1:15:13] believest thou not that I in the father
[1:15:16] and the father in me the words that I
[1:15:19] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[1:15:23] the father that dwelleth in me
[1:15:25] he doeth The Works believe me that I'm
[1:15:29] in the father and the father in me or
[1:15:31] else believe me for the very Works
[1:15:36] sake he that believeth on me here we
[1:15:38] come the works that I do shall he do
[1:15:43] also and Greater Works than these shall
[1:15:45] he do because I go unto my father you
[1:15:50] see here we are in a time and notice
[1:15:53] brother Rand would picked this up and he
[1:15:55] talks about what is taking place there
[1:15:58] and what has been in the ministry here
[1:16:00] in works of Faith expressed he says now
[1:16:03] that don't heal you talking about the
[1:16:05] vision that just
[1:16:07] identified that's the works that
[1:16:10] identifies the faith of the presence of
[1:16:13] God his word made manifest so the faith
[1:16:17] of the presence of God is his word made
[1:16:20] manifest it identifies his workings
[1:16:24] identify the faith of the presence of
[1:16:27] God his word made manifest so God's
[1:16:29] desire remember you or I cannot fulfill
[1:16:32] this word even when the Bible says
[1:16:34] Abraham believed God but the opening
[1:16:37] part of that scripture in James says
[1:16:39] that it might be fulfilled God when he
[1:16:42] speaks a word it's not just good enough
[1:16:44] that we say well I believe that word
[1:16:47] brother B says you can actually
[1:16:48] entertain it and you're looking at it
[1:16:51] and says my that's good makes sense yeah
[1:16:53] you know it just seems right he said but
[1:16:55] yet you will never identify yourself
[1:16:57] with it but you see there's something
[1:16:59] about it to the believer that goes
[1:17:01] beyond our ability to even comprehend
[1:17:05] it's something that begins to move in
[1:17:07] our life what is it it's the faith of
[1:17:10] God that is present that is actually
[1:17:12] moving upon what God has already sown in
[1:17:16] our life it's to make you I or to get
[1:17:19] our attention listen theology will never
[1:17:21] do it it'll never do it intellect ual
[1:17:25] will never do it but it must be him by
[1:17:30] his works that he would come and stir up
[1:17:33] that part that lays within us now let's
[1:17:36] look at this here Jesus could say in
[1:17:39] that time in John 8 to to those
[1:17:42] Pharisees religious men in that time he
[1:17:45] said I said therefore unto you that you
[1:17:48] shall die in your sins for if you
[1:17:50] believe not that I am he ye shall die in
[1:17:54] your your sins he just told him if you
[1:17:57] are Abraham's children you would do the
[1:18:00] works of Abraham but he says you're of
[1:18:02] your father the devil your his works is
[1:18:06] what you're doing because the word is
[1:18:09] standing among you the word the same one
[1:18:12] that came to Abraham and he said before
[1:18:15] Abraham was I
[1:18:17] am he was the I am standing right there
[1:18:21] in his Temple of humanity and there they
[1:18:24] were they were resisting it rejecting it
[1:18:27] Jesus said my word it has no place in
[1:18:30] you you have not the love of God in your
[1:18:33] heart but look at this little woman down
[1:18:35] here by the well she was written off
[1:18:38] from society there were nobody have
[1:18:41] thought anything laid there but that's
[1:18:43] why Jesus said do not judge according to
[1:18:46] the outside appearance but you must
[1:18:49] judge what's on the inside there's only
[1:18:51] one way that can come it takes the
[1:18:54] perception and discernment of the Holy
[1:18:56] Ghost to discern what's down there on
[1:18:59] the
[1:19:01] inside oh glory be to God you see we
[1:19:04] must as the scripture said this is the
[1:19:07] work of God that you believe on him whom
[1:19:11] he has sent brother BR would say it just
[1:19:13] this way so simple in spoken words
[1:19:15] Original Seed he says in order to serve
[1:19:18] God you must receive the servants he
[1:19:21] sends on Earth with his word that's
[1:19:24] scripture we've been through that so it
[1:19:26] takes God manifesting
[1:19:30] himself in his promised word to set the
[1:19:36] church in motion and when I'm talking
[1:19:38] about the church I'm talking about the
[1:19:41] believer notice this how that it would
[1:19:45] it would take God moving in that way
[1:19:48] think of this in Paul would write if I
[1:19:50] can refer to a couple of these places
[1:19:53] Paul would write to the Galatians in
[1:19:55] Galatians 3:1 oh foolish Galatians who
[1:19:58] hath Bewitched you that you should not
[1:20:01] obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus
[1:20:06] Christ hath been evidently set forth
[1:20:11] crucified among
[1:20:13] you he's calling them back to that
[1:20:17] experience that set their lives in
[1:20:21] motion you see Jesus Christ was set
[1:20:25] forth evidently among you this word I
[1:20:27] love this word it means to depict or
[1:20:29] portray openly it's that which is
[1:20:33] written before the eyes of all that
[1:20:35] others can read it's to portray or paint
[1:20:39] before the eyes so here God become
[1:20:42] visible before them it was God operating
[1:20:47] by the Revelation that he gave Paul it
[1:20:50] was God moving in that time sure the
[1:20:53] sick were healed Devils were cast out
[1:20:56] but the word as it was going forth it
[1:20:59] was a word that was changing their lives
[1:21:03] it was a reality that the Believers
[1:21:05] sitting there that they were witnessing
[1:21:08] and they were seeing Jesus Christ
[1:21:11] revealed in his power and in his glory
[1:21:14] as a matter of fact let me just say it
[1:21:16] like this the ministry of Paul Paul was
[1:21:19] the canvas that God chose to manifest
[1:21:22] himself on Elijah was the canvas that
[1:21:26] God manifested himself through Elisha
[1:21:29] there's got to be a canvas that's
[1:21:31] ordained of God that God might portray
[1:21:35] His Image his likeness brother it's not
[1:21:38] the canvas of our first birth but it's
[1:21:40] that canvas of that seed germ on the
[1:21:44] inside that is the ordained canvas of
[1:21:47] God and there's only one one that can
[1:21:50] place that image there by the stroke of
[1:21:53] his brush and that's
[1:21:57] him oh my you're talking about
[1:22:02] masterpieces look at it here what an art
[1:22:08] gallery what an art gallery by The
[1:22:11] Stroke of the
[1:22:13] master no wonder Paul could say I was
[1:22:16] with you in weakness and trembling but
[1:22:18] that your faith might rest in the power
[1:22:20] of God just referring to these places
[1:22:22] Paul would talk about even in 2
[1:22:25] Corinthians 4 of how that he says the
[1:22:28] minds of the world is blind but God has
[1:22:32] shined into our hearts how does Minds
[1:22:34] become blind by dogma and Creeds of
[1:22:38] man they believe that they have the word
[1:22:41] but what they've got is dogmas and
[1:22:43] Creeds and dogmas and Creeds have no
[1:22:46] power there's only one that has the
[1:22:49] power and that's
[1:22:50] God the word listen now when God gets
[1:22:53] into that word that word has the power
[1:22:57] to bring Liberty and to set you free and
[1:23:00] to bring you back from where you came
[1:23:04] from that's the authority of this word
[1:23:06] being
[1:23:08] revealed this is why Paul could say you
[1:23:10] are our epistle written in our
[1:23:14] hearts before it could ever be given out
[1:23:17] Paul God revealed this to Paul and what
[1:23:21] happened right evidently set forth
[1:23:23] before them as the word was being
[1:23:26] ministered not written and engraved you
[1:23:29] know chipping away and oh my got to get
[1:23:32] this and oh my got to get this like as
[1:23:36] there when they engraved there the
[1:23:38] tables of stone no Paul said you were
[1:23:41] written not with ink you were written by
[1:23:45] the spirit of God it was the spirit of
[1:23:48] God ministered to your life and that
[1:23:50] word begin to move in your life things
[1:23:54] begin to break away maybe not all at
[1:23:56] once but little by little things are
[1:23:59] Falling
[1:24:02] Away
[1:24:04] hallelujah oh my it's The Treasure of
[1:24:07] God the testimony of Jesus Christ that
[1:24:11] is right here Among
[1:24:14] Us you see the believer is the only one
[1:24:18] that can receive this testimony this is
[1:24:21] why Paul would write by inspiration and
[1:24:24] God would give the ministerial gifts the
[1:24:28] gifts as it sets forth in Ephesians 4:13
[1:24:31] are till we all come in the unity of the
[1:24:36] faith notice not a faith the
[1:24:41] faith the wisdom of
[1:24:44] man does the same thing it did back
[1:24:48] there in the Trap at at the moabites
[1:24:50] feast
[1:24:52] Israel was undominated
[1:24:55] National but there was a false prophet
[1:24:59] that got hired he had the wrong motives
[1:25:01] and wrong objectives he kept asking God
[1:25:04] why did he keep asking God because in
[1:25:06] his heart was the root of evil the love
[1:25:10] of money he loved
[1:25:14] popularity is that right and notice he
[1:25:17] was not able to curse
[1:25:22] Israel B got him up there and said curse
[1:25:25] him but it just let me just say this to
[1:25:27] you it shows that even what Satan would
[1:25:31] want to try to do or to try to stop he
[1:25:35] canot stop it he cannot th
[1:25:41] it Oh Glory I don't care how down you
[1:25:45] might feel you can't stop
[1:25:49] that you can't stop God's work in your
[1:25:52] life
[1:25:54] this is God's work it's not a man's work
[1:25:57] it's not a Church's work it doesn't need
[1:25:59] propped up by man it is God's
[1:26:04] work a man's Works need so many promises
[1:26:07] will you promise to come to church here
[1:26:09] promise to do this oh if you do this
[1:26:11] we'll make you this
[1:26:14] nonsense the work of God calls to that
[1:26:18] person it calls to that life on the
[1:26:21] inside let me just tell you something
[1:26:23] that is not the power of man at work
[1:26:26] it's the power of God that's moving down
[1:26:30] and taking a hold of your
[1:26:34] life
[1:26:36] Hallelujah till we all come in the unity
[1:26:39] of the faith up with that moabit his
[1:26:42] Feast he got Israel up there they got to
[1:26:48] Mixon we're all
[1:26:51] one we're all the same
[1:26:54] it was a
[1:26:56] spirit of the enemy listen now he was
[1:27:00] preaching integration in an
[1:27:03] ecclesiastical realm I hope you're with
[1:27:05] me that Spirit moved over into the
[1:27:08] natural realm as well it's Spirits at
[1:27:10] work right
[1:27:12] now God desired that his people would be
[1:27:16] separated to him and he is the word the
[1:27:20] only unity and the only thing the unity
[1:27:23] is the unity and Oneness of God inside
[1:27:26] of
[1:27:30] you to the unity of the faith so in
[1:27:34] order for this to come about this Unity
[1:27:37] of the
[1:27:38] faith God would send ministers brother
[1:27:42] says to bring this Faith up God has
[1:27:45] ministers that are Gods sent not just
[1:27:48] ministers God sent they met God the
[1:27:53] Revel
[1:27:54] the unction the inspiration that they're
[1:27:57] preaching from is an experience where
[1:28:00] they've met that
[1:28:03] God it's not calling you to a church or
[1:28:06] an idea it's trying to bring you to a
[1:28:09] place of unity in Jesus Christ and no
[1:28:12] man could do it I don't care if he
[1:28:14] preaches soft or he preaches hard his
[1:28:16] voice has nothing to do with it it's the
[1:28:19] voice that's inside that voice
[1:28:24] glory be to God this is a sovereignty of
[1:28:27] God this is why the scripture would say
[1:28:30] who hath believed our report and to whom
[1:28:33] is the armor of the Lord revealed faith
[1:28:35] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:28:37] of God God sends the gifts in the church
[1:28:41] to manifest his presence with his people
[1:28:44] and his attitude towards us that we
[1:28:47] might see
[1:28:50] him Hallelujah
[1:28:56] glory be to God in the
[1:28:58] highest the gifts are to Magnify Him to
[1:29:03] unify the people I want you to catch
[1:29:04] this it's to Magnify Him and unify the
[1:29:10] people unifying with what the word now
[1:29:14] listen the word will come and it speaks
[1:29:17] against
[1:29:19] sin is that right the word calls sin out
[1:29:22] sin is not to be in the account it's not
[1:29:25] to be in your
[1:29:26] life amen now maybe even the person
[1:29:29] who's guilty of it they may never ever
[1:29:32] come to a place with God that that's
[1:29:34] between them and God but you see God
[1:29:36] don't want that in the camp that's why
[1:29:38] God will call out against it it's not
[1:29:41] just calling out against sin I hope you
[1:29:43] understand me it isn't just calling out
[1:29:45] against sin sometimes people hear the
[1:29:47] word say well you shouldn't cut your
[1:29:48] hair or you shouldn't wear pants or you
[1:29:50] ought to come to church and then and it
[1:29:52] becomes something to where that they
[1:29:54] feel well I they feel a little bad or
[1:29:56] why do I do this or why do I do that or
[1:29:58] yeah maybe I shouldn't do that and they
[1:30:00] missed the whole point what God is
[1:30:02] identifying is there is a condition
[1:30:04] there that needs to be greater than what
[1:30:07] is there you say well how does that
[1:30:09] happen you realize a person could stop
[1:30:11] cutting their hair they could start
[1:30:12] wearing dresses and men and everything
[1:30:14] and on and on and on we could go people
[1:30:16] start coming to church and everything
[1:30:18] else you realize and yet still it not be
[1:30:21] where it needs to be it's got to be a
[1:30:24] condition that changes in the heart of
[1:30:27] the individual because if it's just
[1:30:29] something on the outside it will fade
[1:30:32] eventually in time it'll never hold it
[1:30:36] only becomes a ritual and a doing and
[1:30:38] let me just say this to you that is not
[1:30:41] the emphasis of the Gospel but yet if it
[1:30:44] is there it will present itself on the
[1:30:48] outside it will declare itself in
[1:30:51] works is that right you see sometimes
[1:30:54] you saywell why would you have to tell
[1:30:56] people to come to church cuz sometimes
[1:30:58] you need to encourage them just like
[1:30:59] people who get hard-headed and think
[1:31:01] they don't need to go to the doctor oh I
[1:31:03] got this on my own and I can do this and
[1:31:06] I can do that well bless God I've got
[1:31:08] faith the faith of God is not something
[1:31:10] you use like a cheap
[1:31:12] toy that all of a sudden when you don't
[1:31:14] want to be inconvenience you just slap
[1:31:17] it on there that ain't Faith that's
[1:31:18] called hope that's intellectual Faith
[1:31:23] that's not Faith that's hope faith finds
[1:31:26] the perfect will of God and moves in it
[1:31:30] now I don't know about you there's times
[1:31:31] I don't feel like going to the
[1:31:34] doctor anymore the thing that I don't
[1:31:36] like about it I don't like
[1:31:38] waiting oh but the same it seems like
[1:31:40] you need patience well you know when
[1:31:42] it's there at 11:00 and you don't get to
[1:31:44] see your doctor till
[1:31:47] 2:30 thank God you know I've learned my
[1:31:50] screen on my phone's big enough that I
[1:31:52] can still study
[1:31:54] my iPad is still big enough to has my
[1:31:56] keyboard where I can still study I can
[1:31:59] still listen to the word but you
[1:32:00] understand what I'm saying there are
[1:32:02] times that where when we're looking at
[1:32:04] this that with faith that of how that
[1:32:06] it's to unify us together a real gift
[1:32:08] does not seek to separate us from the
[1:32:11] body of Jesus Christ it does not seek to
[1:32:13] separate let me just say this it's to
[1:32:15] separate from the body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:17] is to separate from the word it comes to
[1:32:20] unite Us in the word
[1:32:24] now notice this this reality of how that
[1:32:27] God would so work because God it's God
[1:32:30] moving through the gifts that he would
[1:32:31] place within his body and even as
[1:32:34] brother Bram would tell us he said it's
[1:32:35] God embodying in that gift and he also
[1:32:38] has gifted you to believe and he said
[1:32:40] between the two corresponding parts
[1:32:42] that's the secret
[1:32:45] food now Hebrews 11:1 let's try to look
[1:32:48] at this here just a moment faith is the
[1:32:52] substance of of things hoped for be
[1:32:55] evidence of Things Not Seen now let me
[1:32:58] just let me just lay this
[1:33:00] in R says what is faith faith is
[1:33:04] something that's revealed to you that is
[1:33:08] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[1:33:13] is a revelation of the will of God am in
[1:33:16] works as Faith Express faith is a
[1:33:19] revelation from God faith is a
[1:33:22] revelation he says now
[1:33:24] he has revealed it to you by his grace
[1:33:29] it's nothing you
[1:33:35] did what did Abraham do for God to call
[1:33:39] him nothing as a matter of fact he was
[1:33:43] making
[1:33:46] Idols he has revealed it to you by his
[1:33:50] grace it's nothing you did you didn't
[1:33:53] work work yourself up into Faith you
[1:33:56] ever have faith it's give to you by the
[1:33:59] grace of God and God reveals it to you
[1:34:03] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:34:05] whole Church of God is built upon the
[1:34:07] Revelation this is how healing
[1:34:11] comes how does healing come it comes by
[1:34:15] God
[1:34:16] revealing himself to
[1:34:19] you now let me just labor on this this
[1:34:22] is not my notes it'll be free
[1:34:27] sometimes the way we look at this or
[1:34:29] that statement that is made not just
[1:34:30] here I've heard but now I see other
[1:34:32] places through the message we take and
[1:34:34] canonize that that statement yeah
[1:34:36] healing must be a revelation and somehow
[1:34:39] we canonize it as though it's got to be
[1:34:42] an instant
[1:34:45] Miracle that's
[1:34:47] error that does not mean that at all but
[1:34:50] healing being a revelation is simp that
[1:34:54] I don't know how God's going to do
[1:34:57] it but God's already healed me you might
[1:35:01] be on your second dose of
[1:35:04] medication but your faith is resting in
[1:35:07] the Revelation maybe God has allowed the
[1:35:10] surgery to come about or maybe you know
[1:35:12] when you say well other times he's
[1:35:13] touched me like this and sometimes
[1:35:15] people are waiting on things to be
[1:35:17] revealed oh I want that to be revealed
[1:35:19] why hasn't God revealed it to me why
[1:35:21] hasn't God doesn't oh look at just even
[1:35:23] going through the land of promise God
[1:35:25] never took every city the same way but
[1:35:27] yet it was
[1:35:28] God but somehow or another we get this
[1:35:31] feeling as though that if we got to go
[1:35:33] to the doctor we're weak in faith where
[1:35:35] did you get that from I'll tell you
[1:35:36] where you got it from if it wasn't from
[1:35:38] a tradition or setting underneath the
[1:35:40] preacher you concocted it your own self
[1:35:42] and if you'd let the Holy Ghost help you
[1:35:44] he would release you and give you
[1:35:46] greater Liberty so you're not walking
[1:35:48] under condemnation and bringing
[1:35:50] everybody else under condemnation
[1:35:52] too woo Lord have mercy faith is a
[1:35:57] revelation faith is not just something
[1:35:59] we throw out there and say well have
[1:36:01] faith no faith is a revelation and it is
[1:36:05] that Revelation moving behind our faith
[1:36:08] that moves us forward this is why when
[1:36:11] it drops in your heart oh that I'm going
[1:36:13] to be well that God has made me well you
[1:36:16] might God can drop that right here in
[1:36:19] the service and maybe after this service
[1:36:21] maybe you're riding in an ambulance
[1:36:23] maybe there's something else that comes
[1:36:25] along but you realize when that
[1:36:27] Revelation is dropped you might look at
[1:36:29] it and say I didn't think it was going
[1:36:30] to be this way I didn't think it was
[1:36:31] going to be that way but look at the
[1:36:33] power of Revelation the power of
[1:36:36] Revelation is just in you the same way
[1:36:39] it was in John the Baptist when John the
[1:36:41] Baptist said this is him Behold the Lamb
[1:36:44] of God it has come exactly how God
[1:36:47] identified and then he said go ask him
[1:36:49] if he's the one or do we look for
[1:36:51] another but you see the p is revelation
[1:36:55] cannot be overthrow but revelation will
[1:36:58] direct you in the rest and the peace in
[1:37:01] the will of almighty God it will say you
[1:37:04] know what I thought it was going to be
[1:37:05] this way but it ain't that way but that
[1:37:07] don't change the Revelation Oh Glory
[1:37:12] misunderstandings of the promise do not
[1:37:15] change that
[1:37:19] Revelation and the devil says you
[1:37:22] thought it was going to come that way
[1:37:24] and it didn't yeah my peab brain thought
[1:37:28] it was going to be that way but I'm so
[1:37:30] glad devil oh stay stay around don't run
[1:37:32] I'm so glad that the Revelation it is
[1:37:34] not resting in my intellect it's resting
[1:37:37] right here I know what he has said how
[1:37:40] he's going to put the RAM on the
[1:37:42] mountain I don't know but he said it'll
[1:37:45] be
[1:37:48] there same way with the Rapture how many
[1:37:52] sitting right here that you might have
[1:37:53] thought I thought years ago or this or
[1:37:55] that or this or that a lot of things
[1:37:57] themselves I predict that maybe did not
[1:38:00] come according to how we
[1:38:02] thought but that don't change the
[1:38:06] Revelation aren't you glad you're not
[1:38:08] resting upon your
[1:38:10] predictions we're not presuming we know
[1:38:12] where we're
[1:38:14] standing glory to God I feel like
[1:38:18] running oh my if you ever have faith
[1:38:20] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:38:22] works this faith Express in an audience
[1:38:25] of people where a prayer line comes
[1:38:27] through and there are all good people
[1:38:29] will'll say there's some that's trying
[1:38:31] hard to believe it trying to work
[1:38:35] themselves into it some just can't do it
[1:38:38] at all and others it's just by Grace
[1:38:42] it's just given to them let me just let
[1:38:44] me just address that devil right
[1:38:47] now if that devil is standing on your
[1:38:50] shoulder and telling you even on the
[1:38:52] internet
[1:38:54] that you don't understand this you don't
[1:38:57] understand that you're trying this and
[1:38:58] you're trying that let me tell you first
[1:39:00] of all those of you that's passed from
[1:39:02] Death unto life that's the ground that
[1:39:05] your understanding comes on you're able
[1:39:07] to look right there the devil right in
[1:39:09] the face and say I may not be able to
[1:39:11] put it all together but I know the God
[1:39:13] who put me
[1:39:15] together I know the God who changed my
[1:39:18] life and let me just tell you something
[1:39:20] God will never ever tell you that you
[1:39:23] don't belong to
[1:39:25] him as a matter of fact let me give you
[1:39:27] some word he said whosoever cometh unto
[1:39:30] me I will in no wise cast out Jesus
[1:39:34] never even ran Judas
[1:39:39] away he treated him just the same as he
[1:39:42] did the rest of them so let me just tell
[1:39:45] you right now God will never tell you
[1:39:48] well you must be one of them spies you
[1:39:51] must be a Judas you must be a that why
[1:39:53] don't right now you just tell that devil
[1:39:55] shut your
[1:39:56] mouth you're a liar you've been a liar
[1:39:58] from the beginning and I am not going to
[1:40:00] live under your oppressive
[1:40:07] lies oh my and others just by Grace it's
[1:40:11] just given to them there's the
[1:40:13] difference that's the real Revelation
[1:40:15] because faith is a revelation from God
[1:40:17] it must be revealed first now watch
[1:40:20] brother Ram will pick this this part up
[1:40:21] in the scripture Jesus clear clearly
[1:40:23] expressed this when he said no man can
[1:40:25] come to me except my father draws him
[1:40:27] first or reveals me to him first he
[1:40:30] asked the people a couple different
[1:40:31] times in this message to read these
[1:40:33] scriptures we're going to read here in
[1:40:34] John 6 now notice he says they didn't
[1:40:37] know who he
[1:40:40] was they didn't know who he was remember
[1:40:42] what remember what even the elect
[1:40:43] thought the elect even when they looked
[1:40:46] at John the Baptist they said why are
[1:40:47] they saying that Elias must first come
[1:40:50] right but when they got in the presence
[1:40:52] of the Lord Jes Jesus and he began to
[1:40:55] talk to him he didn't even mention
[1:40:56] John's name but when the word was being
[1:40:59] revealed it identified who John was who
[1:41:03] did that the Lord Jesus it was necessary
[1:41:06] for them to see that because it's all a
[1:41:08] junction you see how the word itself all
[1:41:10] coming together it was necessary at that
[1:41:12] time for them to see that they did not
[1:41:14] know who he was even when they walked in
[1:41:17] Luke 24 we thought he was the
[1:41:21] one we thought he was the one that
[1:41:24] should have redeemed Israel once again
[1:41:26] it didn't happen according to their
[1:41:30] thinking oh glory be to God they did not
[1:41:33] know who he was but God's grace came
[1:41:35] aren't you glad for that they thought he
[1:41:38] was just an ordinary man they thought
[1:41:41] him just to be as people does today some
[1:41:45] Prophet see people don't have no problem
[1:41:47] with a prophet but once you begin to
[1:41:49] identify and bring this together with
[1:41:51] the promised word of the hour that's
[1:41:53] where the problem
[1:41:55] is some prophet he was the prophet he
[1:41:59] was he was an ordinary man but there was
[1:42:01] more than that now let's read here in
[1:42:02] this scripture here John John 6:44 no
[1:42:05] man can come to me except the Father
[1:42:08] which hath sent me draw him that word
[1:42:11] draw means to impel by an inward power
[1:42:16] it's the same word that describes when
[1:42:19] Peter and them let down the net and they
[1:42:21] were trying to draw up the catch that
[1:42:25] was in that net they needed there had to
[1:42:27] be strength to draw what was beneath the
[1:42:31] surface they felt it but there had to be
[1:42:33] strength to pull what was beneath the
[1:42:36] surface above the surface and you see
[1:42:39] this is where that as he said no man can
[1:42:41] come to me except the Father which hath
[1:42:43] sent me draw him so it takes God drawing
[1:42:47] you an eye above the
[1:42:50] surface Hallelujah you are a little p
[1:42:53] Lily and you didn't know it but you know
[1:42:55] how a pond can be so M Mucky and gunky
[1:42:58] and man it's green and nasty ain't
[1:43:00] nobody would think about jumping in that
[1:43:02] pond saying W my I want to go swimming
[1:43:04] you I don't want to touch that man even
[1:43:08] want to water your roses with that kind
[1:43:09] of water
[1:43:11] you how about you and me there was a lot
[1:43:15] of mud and duck Gunk packed around in
[1:43:18] our life but what was it he let down his
[1:43:21] word at Thy Word word he let down the
[1:43:25] net what was he doing drawing up from
[1:43:28] our lives what was hidden down there
[1:43:32] that we were trying to
[1:43:34] satisfy it's like we couldn't figure out
[1:43:36] why don't I fit in why am I not happy
[1:43:39] here why isn't this enough maybe you
[1:43:41] went to church and you're like but
[1:43:42] there's got to be more I'm asking you
[1:43:45] who put that hunger inside of you I'm
[1:43:49] telling you who did it your father did
[1:43:51] it he put that hunger in you and there
[1:43:55] is nobody can satisfy that but
[1:43:59] God and I will raise him up in the last
[1:44:05] day the power of the Holy Ghost working
[1:44:08] verse
[1:44:09] 45 it's written in the prophets and they
[1:44:13] shall be all taught of God see the
[1:44:18] spirit of God when it comes he comes to
[1:44:21] speak his word the speaking of his word
[1:44:23] is the revealing of his word it's the
[1:44:26] teaching of his word teaching of his
[1:44:28] word wherein that he is unveiling or
[1:44:32] unfolding his word Paul said I was
[1:44:34] taught this by the revelation of Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ so every man notice how this is
[1:44:40] worded every man therefore that hath
[1:44:44] heard and hath learned of the father
[1:44:50] cometh unto me
[1:44:54] so who has heard and has
[1:44:57] learned where it's it's taking place so
[1:45:01] quickly how has this happened it wasn't
[1:45:04] that it was you know let's say necessary
[1:45:06] that my you know teaching seminars
[1:45:08] that's not what he's talking about or we
[1:45:10] can explain it or we can bring it no
[1:45:12] it's where God himself the spirit of God
[1:45:15] is there the spirit of Truth he's there
[1:45:17] to teach he's there to unfold he's there
[1:45:20] to make real he he's the one that brings
[1:45:23] the word to life otherwise the word is
[1:45:26] just a letter do you realize it takes
[1:45:28] him coming in these Services just like
[1:45:31] this the same God this same message and
[1:45:34] what does it do it comes along and
[1:45:36] discerns the Very thoughts and intents
[1:45:38] of our heart it discerns situations it
[1:45:41] discerns maybe battles We're In It deals
[1:45:43] with feelings we're feeling it deals
[1:45:46] with issues it deals with habits it
[1:45:48] deals with sin it calls Souls IT issues
[1:45:51] forth the baptism of theol ho ghost it
[1:45:53] heals the sick who is that that comes
[1:45:56] and inspires that word and makes it
[1:45:59] alive and real and calls to you and I
[1:46:02] it's him it's our
[1:46:06] father not that any man have seen the
[1:46:09] father notice what happens Whoever has
[1:46:10] heard and learned comes unto me not that
[1:46:14] any man hath seen the father save he
[1:46:17] which is of god he hasth seen the father
[1:46:20] Jesus said in John 5:24 he he that
[1:46:23] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:46:27] that sent me notice what hearing the
[1:46:30] word is to lead to real hearing of the
[1:46:33] word is to lead to believe on him that
[1:46:38] sent me so you're hearing through a
[1:46:41] human
[1:46:42] voice but who what you're hearing is not
[1:46:45] the human
[1:46:46] voice there is a connection that's going
[1:46:49] on than just between humans it's a
[1:46:53] Divine connection of the heavenly father
[1:46:56] speaking to his
[1:46:58] children he's calling to his children
[1:47:01] he's drawing Our Lives now notice you
[1:47:05] see this is why in the scripture notice
[1:47:07] let me read it again he that ha heareth
[1:47:09] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:47:11] me hath everlasting life and shall not
[1:47:13] come into condemnation but is passed
[1:47:16] from Death unto life this is what the
[1:47:19] real working of the Holy Ghost does
[1:47:23] the Holy Ghost it comes by the
[1:47:27] word it comes by the word now listen it
[1:47:30] might be why you're Minister it might be
[1:47:32] why you're sitting right here but when
[1:47:33] I'm talking about coming by the word
[1:47:36] remember the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:47:38] different person he is the word he is
[1:47:43] the experience that's being made
[1:47:45] manifest and is preached and is calling
[1:47:49] too it listen it's him it's it's him the
[1:47:53] word it's the holy spirit it's him
[1:47:56] outside of that notice Jesus said no man
[1:47:58] cometh to the father but by
[1:48:02] me he said the Holy Ghost the father
[1:48:05] will send it in my name what is his name
[1:48:10] is his word revealed right notice oh my
[1:48:14] I love how brother Bram I love this
[1:48:15] quote in Satan's Eden brother R picks it
[1:48:17] up and he's talking about scientific
[1:48:19] knowledge let me just refer to it he
[1:48:21] says notice they'll make such a
[1:48:23] scientific understanding and say all you
[1:48:25] got to do is believe just you know you
[1:48:26] heard the word and my you just believe
[1:48:28] on him and that's it but the one thing
[1:48:31] as he points out he says the one thing
[1:48:33] that they that they leave out but these
[1:48:35] signs shall follow them that believe see
[1:48:39] he fails to put that there she believed
[1:48:42] on Jesus Christ she is saved if these
[1:48:46] signs follow the believer oh he says
[1:48:49] it's he that heareth my word not just
[1:48:51] makes out not to hear it with his ears
[1:48:54] but understand
[1:49:00] it understand it brother Samuel I do
[1:49:04] good to spell my name that ain't what
[1:49:06] I'm talking about that ain't what Jesus
[1:49:09] is talking about when he's talking about
[1:49:10] hearing it's understanding is to
[1:49:12] recognize
[1:49:13] him this is my
[1:49:16] mate explain it how I don't know how but
[1:49:19] I just know amen I just know there's
[1:49:21] there's something
[1:49:23] this is him this is what I've been
[1:49:25] searching for in reality it wasn't you
[1:49:28] searching it was him
[1:49:31] drawing oh he that heareth my word not
[1:49:34] just makes out and hears it with his
[1:49:35] ears but understand it anybody can hear
[1:49:38] it a prostitute can hear it and remain a
[1:49:43] prostitute a drunkard can hear it a liar
[1:49:46] can hear it and still remain a liar but
[1:49:48] he that understandeth my word and
[1:49:51] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:49:53] everlasting life and no man can do that
[1:49:56] except God for ordained
[1:50:01] him well let me ask you since you've
[1:50:03] heard it have you remained the
[1:50:08] same when you really hear it and
[1:50:11] understand it you cannot remain what you
[1:50:16] were now who does that that's God that's
[1:50:19] a for knowledge and sovereignty of God
[1:50:23] working on our
[1:50:27] life now you might be sitting here this
[1:50:29] morning and you may not be all the way
[1:50:31] where you need to be there might be
[1:50:33] things within your life but yet one
[1:50:34] thing that you do know is I'm not what I
[1:50:36] used to be I'm not what I used to be
[1:50:39] brother Samuel what do I do keep keep
[1:50:42] gleaning keep taking in the word don't
[1:50:44] try to work yourself up but listen give
[1:50:47] yourself to the word how do I give
[1:50:48] myself to the word obey the word
[1:50:54] obey the word in
[1:50:56] Simplicity ask God to continue to reveal
[1:50:59] himself to you until God brings a full
[1:51:06] transformation can I have just a few
[1:51:08] more
[1:51:10] moments now notice how brother Bram
[1:51:13] would say this I'm just going to skip
[1:51:14] some scriptures here I want to just lay
[1:51:16] this in
[1:51:18] here brother Ram is talking about here
[1:51:21] in works of Faith Express he's dealing
[1:51:23] with this betting ground and he deals
[1:51:25] with these same scriptures that he's
[1:51:26] told the people over and over in that
[1:51:28] message to read and we just read them he
[1:51:30] said now no man can understand who he is
[1:51:33] or how it is except it be revealed to
[1:51:35] you by the revelation of God and then
[1:51:37] faith in that you act
[1:51:42] accordingly he talks about how that no
[1:51:44] other man can do it it don't matter how
[1:51:47] good you are who you are it's got to be
[1:51:49] revealed to you now in paragraph 12
[1:51:52] before let me just lay this in here
[1:51:55] everybody all
[1:51:57] right now here is where the
[1:51:59] predestinated plan is in view just as
[1:52:04] other seed the word of God is a seed and
[1:52:08] must have the
[1:52:10] ground
[1:52:12] prepared
[1:52:15] beforehand if you seed seed and just
[1:52:18] throwed it out there on the ground it
[1:52:21] would do no good
[1:52:23] the birds would pick it up you throw it
[1:52:25] among thistles and Thorns it'll choke it
[1:52:28] out pretty
[1:52:30] soon this is the Gospel Matthew Jesus
[1:52:33] talking about The
[1:52:34] Parables there is way there's
[1:52:36] places where you would select right when
[1:52:39] you're going to plant a garden you don't
[1:52:41] just say hey you know what let's just
[1:52:42] plant a garden right here a garden is a
[1:52:45] select
[1:52:47] place where you plant certain plants
[1:52:50] those of you that know that plant
[1:52:51] certain plants you plant certain plants
[1:52:53] based on the drainage of your soil
[1:52:55] what's it like in this area of the soil
[1:52:56] is it better drained right here how's
[1:52:58] the Sun come in this area and all you've
[1:53:00] got certain things that you scope out
[1:53:03] because you know I don't care how
[1:53:04] beautiful you think a particular thing
[1:53:06] is it might be the most gorgeous
[1:53:09] hydrangia bush in the world but if you
[1:53:11] don't plant it in the right place it
[1:53:14] doesn't matter how beautiful it is the
[1:53:15] place where you planted it will not
[1:53:17] yield the beauty that's
[1:53:19] there so it's got to be scoped out of
[1:53:21] where it's going to be planted now
[1:53:23] notice let's just let's just look at
[1:53:25] this here as we're coming down he said
[1:53:27] you throw it among thin thistles and
[1:53:29] Thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon
[1:53:31] Jesus parable said so so the ground has
[1:53:34] to be made ready first so God in
[1:53:39] Sovereign Grace prepares the heart
[1:53:43] first he prepared you before the
[1:53:46] foundation of the world to receive him
[1:53:50] in this age amen amen he fornew You by
[1:53:54] his forn knowledge and ordained you to
[1:53:56] eternal life he knew you therefore he
[1:53:59] prepared
[1:54:01] you now notice in this particular quote
[1:54:03] what he's just said here first let me go
[1:54:06] back to that statement so God in
[1:54:08] Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first
[1:54:12] now what is the betting ground that God
[1:54:14] is coming for it's that
[1:54:17] seed that which is of him that is laid
[1:54:20] dormant or as Paul would write you were
[1:54:23] dead in sin and
[1:54:27] trespasses it's not the old man that had
[1:54:30] to be raised up the old man had to die
[1:54:33] and it's that man right there that needs
[1:54:35] to have the
[1:54:37] resurrection that happened on that
[1:54:38] Easter
[1:54:40] morning right that raises a dead a dead
[1:54:43] one to
[1:54:44] life is that
[1:54:46] right so here God prepares the heart
[1:54:49] first God dealing with the heart God
[1:54:51] dealing with your life God's speaking to
[1:54:53] that heart oh my maybe that heart or
[1:54:55] that life is just resisting I don't want
[1:54:56] nothing to do or I don't this or that
[1:54:58] and God's dealing with the heart God
[1:55:00] starts drawing the heart to where what
[1:55:01] happens the heart itself it begins to
[1:55:03] feel
[1:55:05] guilty you begin to feel guilty why am I
[1:55:07] doing this I don't want to live this way
[1:55:10] I shouldn't be living this way oh I I I
[1:55:14] I I need help what is that that's
[1:55:16] working it's God preparing the heart
[1:55:20] first well brother Samuel I thought you
[1:55:22] said he already prepared me to receive
[1:55:25] he did he did but he is preparing your
[1:55:28] heart to make way for him to come to
[1:55:32] that
[1:55:34] seed just as a person would go and you
[1:55:37] would scope out ground where you're
[1:55:38] going to plant that Garden you don't
[1:55:40] just even though it could be the most
[1:55:42] Choice spot this is the spot oh the Sun
[1:55:44] comes right here oh it's well irrigated
[1:55:47] you just don't walk out there and just
[1:55:48] start throwing seed you don't walk out
[1:55:50] there and just dump tomato plant
[1:55:53] it is a spot that you have
[1:55:56] chosen and when that spot that choosing
[1:55:59] what makes that choosing real is when
[1:56:02] you start going along there maybe you
[1:56:04] take the paint
[1:56:07] Canon Oh Glory I feel like preaching
[1:56:12] now when God comes down around your life
[1:56:15] and
[1:56:18] goes it's already been marked out he's
[1:56:22] letting you know you have always been a
[1:56:26] place marked out I've never lost sight
[1:56:31] of you I don't care what kind of a mess
[1:56:33] and what kind of a trouble you were in
[1:56:36] you were always a chosen place that
[1:56:40] belonged to me you see he's got to make
[1:56:43] it known to you and I it's not enough
[1:56:45] that he has faith that same faith that
[1:56:48] he has in his word must come and pulsate
[1:56:52] and energize in our life that it would
[1:56:55] reciprocate back to him in the same
[1:56:58] measure I believe you papa I believe you
[1:57:01] papa I believe you
[1:57:05] papa once you get it marked out staked
[1:57:08] off what do you do get around the
[1:57:12] edge you know that edging tool then you
[1:57:15] can work scrape that get that grass out
[1:57:18] of here why you don't want that grass
[1:57:20] coming up in your plants
[1:57:23] so first of all justification he's
[1:57:26] already marking out you belong to him
[1:57:28] sanctification he comes he sets the mind
[1:57:31] in order for
[1:57:32] Holiness when you look at I don't want
[1:57:35] to do that I I don't want these things
[1:57:37] around my life I I don't want that and
[1:57:39] what's he doing he's he's clearing out
[1:57:41] the space that's already laid out for
[1:57:44] him what's going on he's making knowing
[1:57:48] is
[1:57:50] choosing he's choosing is moving upon
[1:57:53] this ground that he prepared
[1:57:58] beforehand then he sends it down there
[1:58:00] maybe you know whether you scrape the
[1:58:02] grass up or you plow it up you know you
[1:58:04] got to break up fow ground you got to
[1:58:06] break that ground up because you just
[1:58:07] can't put seed on hard ground that's why
[1:58:10] God's got to get you get it get it
[1:58:12] replace that Stony heart with a heart of
[1:58:14] Flesh come on now somebody he gives that
[1:58:17] I'll give you I'll give you a new heart
[1:58:19] and a new spirit where all of a sudden
[1:58:21] where you were so hard I don't want
[1:58:22] nothing to do with God I don't want this
[1:58:24] or I don't want that or I don't want
[1:58:25] this and then God begins to move in that
[1:58:28] place and things begin to change your
[1:58:30] mind your thinking begins to change
[1:58:32] what's happening it's God himself
[1:58:34] working upon that ground that he has
[1:58:37] prepared
[1:58:39] beforehand and he's bringing it to
[1:58:41] himself he breaks the ground up and
[1:58:43] finally as the ground itself is broke up
[1:58:45] then he begins to plant he begins to
[1:58:48] plant he begins to place within that
[1:58:50] ground what needs to come forth and that
[1:58:52] ground that I'm talking about that
[1:58:54] ground is that seed of God that lay
[1:58:56] within you that was the prepared ground
[1:58:59] of almighty God that is when the
[1:59:01] scripture said in The Parables was the
[1:59:03] good ground it was good ground it was
[1:59:06] word notice nothing wrong with the word
[1:59:08] some fell in Stony places some among
[1:59:10] thorns and thistles some fell over here
[1:59:12] and then the word fell in good ground
[1:59:14] nothing was wrong with the word what was
[1:59:18] it what made the difference the ground
[1:59:21] that the word fell in the ground that
[1:59:24] the word fell in is what actually
[1:59:28] declared amen the word itself that it
[1:59:32] had
[1:59:35] received can I read you this in
[1:59:39] closing I love how brother Brown words
[1:59:41] this I just got to read
[1:59:45] it he says let me let let me let me read
[1:59:49] that in that last part again I I can't
[1:59:51] leave that off you you know it'd be like
[1:59:53] to me be like eating cake without icing
[1:59:55] BL I don't want
[1:59:57] it I like cake with
[2:00:00] icing so God in Sovereign Grace prepares
[2:00:03] the heart first he prepared you before
[2:00:07] the foundation of the world to receive
[2:00:10] him in this age he fornew You by his
[2:00:13] forn knowledge and ordained you to
[2:00:15] eternal life he knew you therefore he
[2:00:20] prepared you that's the reason you
[2:00:24] staggered out of these things and
[2:00:26] staggered into what you have now did you
[2:00:28] catch how he word said I I you know for
[2:00:30] me I'm just I'm just kind of simple but
[2:00:32] I looked at that this morning after I've
[2:00:34] been looking at this for weeks and I
[2:00:35] thought staggered what does that
[2:00:38] mean staggered means you know you're
[2:00:40] just kind of you really don't know
[2:00:41] what's going on you just just you don't
[2:00:43] know what's taking place I mean you just
[2:00:46] I don't know what it is I
[2:00:49] just you know I've been thinking about
[2:00:50] going to church
[2:00:54] see there's nothing you could look at
[2:00:55] that and say wow that's real Faith No
[2:00:57] but what's happening is you're
[2:00:59] staggering out
[2:01:03] of staggering out of this where are you
[2:01:07] going I don't know I mean see it really
[2:01:08] doesn't look like anything real sure it
[2:01:11] doesn't look like anything you would put
[2:01:12] your garden in right there that's
[2:01:13] staggering out but God knows what he's
[2:01:16] doing you don't even know what's taking
[2:01:18] place you don't even know why in the
[2:01:20] world you ended up here right you don't
[2:01:23] even know why in the world how in the
[2:01:24] world I get connected with this how in
[2:01:25] the world I end up here why in the world
[2:01:27] did this happen why in the world would
[2:01:29] this get R see you don't know but you
[2:01:30] see God knows that's what's important
[2:01:33] and God being being you staggering here
[2:01:36] God who always knew you he's letting you
[2:01:39] know I've always known
[2:01:44] you I've known about
[2:01:46] you my you stagger out of these things
[2:01:50] and you stagger into what you have now
[2:01:52] so don't don't listen to me now don't
[2:01:55] don't don't take it don't don't get
[2:01:56] offended when people are staggering out
[2:01:58] of and staggering into well brother
[2:02:00] Samuel I want to see people quit
[2:02:02] staggering how long did it take you to
[2:02:04] quit staggering right as a matter of
[2:02:06] fact if you'll be honest you still
[2:02:08] stagger just like I do right there's
[2:02:11] certain things come on now there's
[2:02:12] certain things in how God would deal
[2:02:14] with our life we have no more knowledge
[2:02:17] about it than
[2:02:20] nothing right God grounds a plane in
[2:02:23] Memphis Prophet didn't know why he did
[2:02:25] it he didn't say wow there's something
[2:02:27] Supernatural here no he didn't make
[2:02:31] nothing out he didn't have to everything
[2:02:34] was no it was just you know brother Joey
[2:02:37] just just everyday life I'm going to go
[2:02:39] down and mail these letters I got
[2:02:40] letters I need to I need to mail and and
[2:02:42] here he is just going down through there
[2:02:45] you see the Staggering part within it
[2:02:48] even sometimes where you and I come into
[2:02:50] places we do not know how God's going to
[2:02:52] answer his
[2:02:53] word boy I tell you what we could really
[2:02:56] preach right here sometimes we're we're
[2:02:58] looking and we're waiting well Lord I
[2:03:01] don't know what you want me to do Lord I
[2:03:02] don't want you to do Faith itself is
[2:03:07] subconscious now there's certain things
[2:03:09] in the word that God tells you to do you
[2:03:11] don't got to pray about it is that right
[2:03:14] I mean when the Bible says come to the
[2:03:15] house of God you don't have to pray and
[2:03:17] say is it your will Lord that's wrote in
[2:03:19] the
[2:03:20] word there's a lot of things that are
[2:03:22] wrote in the word you don't got to pray
[2:03:24] about it just got to have faith in The
[2:03:26] God Who said it now notice this here
[2:03:29] staggered out of and staggered into look
[2:03:32] he said it's God leading you to the
[2:03:34] place where he ordained for you to be if
[2:03:38] this ground isn't prepared beforehand it
[2:03:40] can't grow that's the reason this seat
[2:03:43] of faith when you're preaching Faith you
[2:03:45] see the discernments of the Lord and see
[2:03:46] what takes place and all the gifts of
[2:03:48] the Bible working people work themselves
[2:03:50] up oh Hallelujah I believe it and come
[2:03:52] out and they find themselves
[2:03:54] disappointed see the ground has to be
[2:03:58] foreordained and you know when it
[2:04:00] strikes it let me just read this I I
[2:04:02] know we've heard this so many times but
[2:04:04] I just I just love it like my little
[2:04:07] Eagle last night he knew when he heard
[2:04:11] that scream of that mother Eagle there's
[2:04:13] a lot of difference between that and the
[2:04:16] cluck of the H see because he was an
[2:04:20] eagle from the
[2:04:23] egg if you had have looked down in that
[2:04:25] barnyard you would have looked at him
[2:04:27] and said what in the world is that ain't
[2:04:30] a chicken in
[2:04:36] there but nobody there knew what he
[2:04:43] was but his mama
[2:04:46] knew and his mama knew there's an egg
[2:04:51] that I had in my
[2:04:53] Nest it's been
[2:04:56] lost but I'm coming to find
[2:04:59] it coming to redeem it I'm coming to
[2:05:02] claim it so Mama Eagle sweeps
[2:05:06] over you see he wasn't he wasn't made an
[2:05:10] eagle right then he was always an eagle
[2:05:16] and a Christian always was that's the
[2:05:19] reason he said with divorce when you
[2:05:21] divorce because you were trapped into it
[2:05:24] by your first parent Adam and Eve you
[2:05:26] become a sinner by Nature listen you
[2:05:29] didn't want to
[2:05:30] be brother Brian who's the you he's
[2:05:33] talking about the real
[2:05:35] you the real you not the you that you've
[2:05:39] always thought was
[2:05:40] you but the real you that laid down on
[2:05:44] the
[2:05:45] inside that God knew if I just and get
[2:05:48] him into my presence when I can get him
[2:05:50] into my presence presence and make
[2:05:53] myself known to them they did not want
[2:05:56] to be trapped in
[2:05:58] that but he comes he spreads his Wings
[2:06:03] by his power he begins to move
[2:06:07] over list
[2:06:10] stand you didn't want to be that but now
[2:06:13] you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by
[2:06:16] hearing Revelation comes by
[2:06:19] hearing there is a little something
[2:06:22] inside of
[2:06:23] you another man sitting right by you
[2:06:27] could
[2:06:28] say I don't believe that stuff nonsense
[2:06:32] I don't believe that nothing to
[2:06:35] it but like they did on the day of
[2:06:38] Pentecost they laughed said these men
[2:06:41] are full of new
[2:06:44] wine they know it was it was a great
[2:06:47] thing to those it was happening to isn't
[2:06:51] it a great
[2:06:54] thing why it was God revealing himself
[2:06:59] to the
[2:07:00] individuals While others laughed these
[2:07:03] were rejoicing it was an individual
[2:07:06] Revelation which is faith
[2:07:10] faith that's
[2:07:14] revealed faith is the
[2:07:18] substance of things hoped for
[2:07:22] expected
[2:07:25] Revelation is Faith brings Faith what is
[2:07:29] it it places within us that
[2:07:33] deposit of an
[2:07:37] expectation that faith that comes by the
[2:07:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the
[2:07:43] earnest of our
[2:07:45] expectation that revelation of faith
[2:07:48] that
[2:07:49] comes maybe there's a situ sitation
[2:07:52] going on in your life healing whatever
[2:07:56] it might
[2:07:56] be it still requires a
[2:08:00] revelation from
[2:08:05] God it's the evidence of Things Not
[2:08:09] Seen and it
[2:08:11] tremendous it's the evidence just what
[2:08:14] James had said by the spirit of God
[2:08:17] without faith without works faith is
[2:08:20] made Vo
[2:08:22] so faith and works are husband and
[2:08:28] wife the wife expresses to whom she
[2:08:31] belongs and the husband expresses this
[2:08:34] is my wife he reveals himself to
[2:08:38] her as her
[2:08:41] husband she yields herself and makes
[2:08:43] herself
[2:08:44] known I am your
[2:08:47] wife she declares remember remember
[2:08:50] remember through her life proverbs 31
[2:08:52] her husband is known in the
[2:08:57] gates where transactions take place
[2:09:01] where lives are set
[2:09:03] free holds are
[2:09:06] broken healing takes place Deliverance
[2:09:10] comes her husband is known in the
[2:09:16] gates he's the same yesterday today and
[2:09:19] forever it's an Evidence
[2:09:22] it's an Evidence in our
[2:09:26] life you know think about it brother
[2:09:28] Brown would put it so simple he said a
[2:09:29] person could say they're married he said
[2:09:31] if they say they're married and they
[2:09:33] can't show their husband or their wife
[2:09:35] you doubt
[2:09:37] them you say you're married but you
[2:09:39] don't where's your husband at or where's
[2:09:42] your wife at well you know but when you
[2:09:46] see their
[2:09:47] husband
[2:09:49] War the husband's claim you see his
[2:09:53] wife then you know you there there
[2:09:55] there's the evidence right there that's
[2:09:58] the same way right now when Jesus said
[2:10:03] Philip said show us the father have I
[2:10:05] been so long with
[2:10:07] you when you have seen me you have seen
[2:10:11] the
[2:10:11] father now there's not one of us that
[2:10:14] contain the fullness of the godhead
[2:10:17] bodily but that portion that lick of
[2:10:20] fire that light life that's went into
[2:10:22] that bedding ground of that seed in your
[2:10:26] life then that little licks of fire it
[2:10:28] joins together that's the godhead
[2:10:33] bodily made manifest in its fullness
[2:10:37] among
[2:10:39] us because we are a part of that body of
[2:10:43] Jesus
[2:10:46] Christ by this same Faith the Bible says
[2:10:50] by it
[2:10:52] they obtained a good
[2:10:54] report how was
[2:10:56] it it was that faith that
[2:11:00] Revelation that Revelation that came
[2:11:03] into their lives it further taught them
[2:11:07] it showed them it directed them in every
[2:11:12] part of their
[2:11:17] life and this morning no matter where
[2:11:20] you're at
[2:11:23] I like how Paul would write this
[2:11:26] here I just just want to read this this
[2:11:28] to
[2:11:31] you Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 2:13
[2:11:35] for this cause also thank we god without
[2:11:38] ceasing because when ye receive the word
[2:11:41] of God which he heard of us ye received
[2:11:46] it not as the word of men but as it is
[2:11:50] in truth the word of of God which
[2:11:53] effectually worketh also in you that
[2:11:57] believe
[2:11:59] effectually worketh it shows
[2:12:02] itself operative in your
[2:12:06] life he's
[2:12:09] working his word being spoken is what
[2:12:14] freed the prison bars from around our
[2:12:18] life remember brother brandham
[2:12:21] when they're asking he sees all these
[2:12:23] people behind prison bars brother Braham
[2:12:25] he looks at himself he looks at his arms
[2:12:27] he says I'm not strong enough to get him
[2:12:29] out of
[2:12:32] there but he stepped back and he said
[2:12:35] House of hell yeah give way in the name
[2:12:40] of Jesus
[2:12:41] Christ begin to Creek
[2:12:45] pop maybe your life today is creaking
[2:12:48] and popping
[2:12:51] what is that it's the word going to work
[2:12:54] it's the word loosening creaking and
[2:12:57] popping and breaking away the things of
[2:13:00] the world House of Hell give way in the
[2:13:03] name of Jesus
[2:13:07] Christ and those bars fled away from
[2:13:10] that life it was
[2:13:13] removed and the people who were in there
[2:13:15] were good
[2:13:17] people now what was inside of their life
[2:13:20] could be expressed you know what that
[2:13:22] house of hell was it's our first birth
[2:13:28] yeah it's the organizational systems of
[2:13:31] man that keeps man bound tells him just
[2:13:34] come to church be a good guy you'll be
[2:13:37] all right but there's a longing inside
[2:13:40] of your heart as an
[2:13:42] eagle there's there's got to be more
[2:13:44] than
[2:13:45] programs there's got to be more is
[2:13:48] there's something not satisfying me
[2:13:51] what is that God prepared that ground
[2:13:54] before him to receive him so when you
[2:13:59] would walk people are not saying are you
[2:14:02] Methodist are you Baptist are you
[2:14:04] Pentecostal but there's something about
[2:14:06] it that they'll say I don't know what it
[2:14:08] is about their life but I know they're a
[2:14:13] Christian I know there's something
[2:14:15] different about their
[2:14:17] life it's a presence do you realize it
[2:14:20] isn't just even our outward adornment
[2:14:22] although that will reflect itself but
[2:14:25] there's a presence of God that comes
[2:14:27] with your life when Moses came off the
[2:14:31] mountain he had to cover his face his
[2:14:34] face Shone with the glory of
[2:14:40] [Music]
[2:14:42] God your
[2:14:44] life shining with the glory of
[2:14:47] God the Bible said the glory of the Lord
[2:14:50] shall be seen upon
[2:14:55] thee I say this morning in the name of
[2:14:58] Jesus Christ House of Hell give way in
[2:15:02] the name of Jesus
[2:15:05] Christ Satan you're a liar and you've
[2:15:08] already been defeated

[2:15:16] it's the word of my
[2:15:18] father that dwells inside of my heart it
[2:15:22] says speak
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:26] it I'll just go ahead and say it in the
[2:15:28] name of Jesus Christ it's time for
[2:15:30] prodal to come
[2:15:33] home it's
[2:15:36] time months ago when God dropped that in

[2:15:40] heart is this is the time this is the
[2:15:45] hour this is the season for lives to be
[2:15:49] changed Hallelujah this is the time for

[2:15:55] for the captive to go free Hallelujah

[2:22:37] Christ had made you free be not
[2:22:39] entangled again with a Yol of
[2:22:42] bondage he would go on to tell them how
