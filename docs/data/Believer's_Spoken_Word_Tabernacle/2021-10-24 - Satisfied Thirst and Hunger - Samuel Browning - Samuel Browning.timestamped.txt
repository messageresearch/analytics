[40:49] this morning so good to be together
[40:52] together
[40:53] it's cold today
[40:57] some of you look at me strange
[40:59] you all passed through that didn't you
[41:00] you were awake enough to realize it was
[41:02] cold outside today
[41:04] my we had this change in weather for
[41:07] some things i'm happy in the change of
[41:09] weather
[41:10] but other things you know this time of
[41:13] the year we we enjoy it but my goodness
[41:15] it seems like it just comes with such a
[41:17] quickness when it gets cold
[41:20] and
[41:21] but we have such a we know this is a
[41:23] season and a cycle you go through
[41:26] after you know the flowers that we've
[41:28] enjoyed and everything they've
[41:31] if they've served their purpose
[41:33] they'll come back in the spring
[41:36] if it's if it that flower you know just
[41:38] because it's a flower doesn't mean it's
[41:39] going to come back
[41:41] that flower's got to be germatized
[41:44] if that flower has been germatized then
[41:46] the spring itself only vindicates
[41:49] the secret work
[41:51] that was done in the summer
[41:53] buried in the winter
[41:55] and the summer itself
[41:57] its presence
[41:59] only makes manifest
[42:01] the work that was already done
[42:04] and that's the same way it does with the
[42:06] resurrection of jesus christ the
[42:08] presence of god it only vindicates
[42:11] is the working
[42:13] placing of his word and of our lives
[42:16] amen just to get into his presence
[42:19] when we get into his presence we begin
[42:20] to recognize
[42:22] that sounds like home
[42:26] that sounds like home
[42:28] there's something about it that
[42:29] resonates out that's that's what i'm
[42:31] longing for
[42:32] is home
[42:34] amen

[42:38] in the house of the lord good to serve
[42:39] the lord jesus

[45:39] we've done

[45:43] or how good we could ever be lord our
[45:46] righteousness is as described oh god by
[45:50] the prophet lord in the old testament is
[45:52] but filthy rags

[45:59] coming today or approaching
[46:01] on the merits of our righteousness but
[46:04] we're coming

[47:31] ask it for the glory of god now in jesus
[47:35] name
[47:36] amen
[47:37] amen deuteronomy 16 verse 1
[47:41] observe the month
[47:43] of abeth which would be the month of
[47:46] april
[47:47] and keep the passover unto the lord thy
[47:49] god
[47:50] for in the month of abib the lord thy
[47:53] god brought thee forth out of egypt by
[47:56] night
[47:57] thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[48:01] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[48:03] passover unto the lord thy god
[48:06] of the flock
[48:07] and the herd
[48:09] in the place which the lord
[48:12] shall choose to place his name
[48:16] there
[48:17] i want to just really emphasize that
[48:20] thou shalt
[48:22] offer the sacrifice
[48:24] but only in the place which the lord
[48:28] shall choose to place his name there
[48:32] amen you can offer it many other places
[48:34] but god will only accept it
[48:38] in the place
[48:40] where he's chose to place his name
[48:43] just give you an example
[48:45] it would be like if you you know we have
[48:47] mailboxes that are set up i'm talking
[48:49] about those blue
[48:50] um
[48:52] places where you put your mail so you
[48:54] see them sometimes you see them by a
[48:55] school you see them sometimes they don't
[48:57] have to go to a post office right
[48:59] now
[49:00] you can you can look and you could see
[49:02] one of those blue things set up
[49:04] but if there is no u.s postal service
[49:07] seal
[49:08] on the outside of that
[49:10] you could say i mailed my taxes
[49:14] i sent them in but the only way that
[49:17] those taxes actually make it or whatever
[49:20] document is you've got to put it in a
[49:22] place
[49:24] that is recognized by the post office
[49:27] that'll come pick it up and get it there
[49:30] you see what that seal does upon there
[49:32] when you see that seal
[49:34] it separates that blue receptacle from
[49:37] every other blue receptacle
[49:39] the seal is what gives you confidence
[49:44] and god
[49:45] seals
[49:46] himself his word
[49:49] by his presence
[49:50] [Music]
[49:52] thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it
[49:56] seven days shalt thou eat unleavened
[49:58] bread therewith even the bread of
[50:00] affliction for thou came us forth out of
[50:03] the land of egypt in haste that thou
[50:06] mayest observe mayest remember the day
[50:09] when thou came us forth out of the land
[50:11] of egypt all the days of thy life
[50:13] and there shall be no leavened bread
[50:15] seen with thee
[50:17] and all thy coast
[50:19] seven days
[50:21] neither shall there anything of the
[50:23] flesh which thou sacrificeth the first
[50:26] day of even remain all night unto the
[50:30] morning there's many parts within there
[50:32] but i don't want to get off on those
[50:33] today
[50:34] thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
[50:39] within any of thy gates
[50:42] which the lord thy god giveth thee so
[50:44] god has given them these gates
[50:47] but god has said there's only one gate
[50:49] where i'll receive the worship
[50:52] and you won't have to guess you won't
[50:53] have to wonder
[50:55] i will place my name
[50:57] in that gate
[50:59] but at the name but at the place verse 6
[51:01] which the lord thy god shall choose to
[51:03] place his name in
[51:05] there thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[51:08] at even
[51:09] at the going down of the sun
[51:11] at the season that thou came us forth
[51:14] out
[51:15] of egypt and thou shalt roast and eat it
[51:19] in the place which the lord thy god
[51:22] shall choose
[51:24] and thou shalt turn in the morning and
[51:26] go
[51:28] into thy tents
[51:30] six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread
[51:32] and on the seventh day shall be a solemn
[51:35] assembly to the lord thy god thou shalt
[51:37] do no work
[51:39] therein
[51:40] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[51:42] of the word as you're being seated
[51:47] i want to say
[51:49] that i mentioned to the church
[51:52] here on thursday
[51:54] that we just so appreciated
[51:57] the prayers that even as we were gone
[51:59] and we were praying for you here and for
[52:01] the services
[52:02] and just so thankful to god's mercy to
[52:05] bring us back together
[52:07] i want to speak this morning we've been
[52:09] dealing with a thought here
[52:11] as god has been leading us
[52:14] on the testimony of our lives but i want
[52:17] to just hone in on this this part of it
[52:19] this morning
[52:21] satisfied
[52:23] thirst
[52:24] and hunger
[52:26] satisfied
[52:28] thirst
[52:29] and
[52:30] hunger and when we
[52:33] think of the scriptures that we've read
[52:35] here
[52:36] god also
[52:38] mentioned this very thing in deuteronomy
[52:41] 12.
[52:42] god let it be known that we're where he
[52:44] places his name
[52:46] this should be the place that the people
[52:50] would seek to that place
[52:54] now
[52:54] this message of deuteronomy 16
[52:57] deuteronomy 12 it wasn't for everybody
[53:01] this was to israel
[53:04] the rest of the nations and the gentile
[53:06] nations at that time
[53:09] it had no meaning to them as a matter of
[53:11] fact god did not it was not uh a message
[53:15] that went out to them but god in grace
[53:18] showed glimpses
[53:20] that even in times when things were
[53:23] taking place in israel there would be
[53:26] intervals
[53:27] where gentiles would be brought in
[53:30] which was a type
[53:32] of the interval of time from when israel
[53:35] was blinded and they rejected that of
[53:38] the messiah there would be an interval
[53:41] of time that god would take a gentile
[53:43] bride
[53:45] the same thing you look like as you look
[53:47] in the book of ruth
[53:49] ruth chapter one is naomi ruth chapter
[53:51] four naomi in between is the bride
[53:55] so there is an interval in the time that
[53:58] god was showing even when the occupation
[54:00] of coming into the promised land
[54:03] here god sends out a word israel is
[54:05] coming in to possess what belongs to him
[54:07] but god sends out a word and there is a
[54:10] gentile there by the name of rahab that
[54:12] is desiring has heard about the living
[54:17] god
[54:17] and hearing about the living god has
[54:20] started to raise something within her
[54:23] that god
[54:24] placed within her before the foundation
[54:28] of the world
[54:29] and so in the midst of this
[54:32] time of coming into the land there was a
[54:34] small interval where god does a short
[54:38] quick work and takes to himself
[54:41] rahab
[54:43] a gentile
[54:45] so knowing the wise i say that with this
[54:48] in mind these things that are wrote in
[54:50] the old testament
[54:52] were tights and shadows
[54:56] that was speaking
[54:58] of a positive that was to come
[55:02] there was a place where god remember
[55:05] when they came over into the land the
[55:07] god placed his name in shiloh or had
[55:11] them to set up their the tabernacle in
[55:14] shiloh and god's place of rest was right
[55:18] there in shiloh shiloh
[55:20] meaning rest
[55:22] then the second place that he would now
[55:25] god would remove his name from there and
[55:27] he would place his name in jerusalem
[55:30] jerusalem being that of peace and and to
[55:32] recognize that it first must come a rest
[55:35] in our soul now
[55:38] which leads us to the peace of god which
[55:41] will lead us into that place of the
[55:43] millennium and the future home
[55:46] so all of us we must follow god in every
[55:49] step of the way and where god is at
[55:52] presently that's the desire of the
[55:56] believer
[55:57] that's the desire of a child of god is
[55:59] to know god and i want to just say as
[56:02] this was types there was an antitype or
[56:06] that which was pointing to what the true
[56:10] representation was and that true
[56:12] representation is the lord jesus christ
[56:17] himself
[56:19] it's just like you know when you see a
[56:21] shadow on a wall and there's a shadow on
[56:24] the wall well the shadow
[56:26] if you see put your hand up and there's
[56:28] a shadow cast on that wall the shadow is
[56:31] not your hand
[56:33] but the shadow
[56:34] is only a reflection
[56:37] that of what is actually real and true
[56:40] and that's the hand you see all through
[56:42] the old testament there was the shadows
[56:45] and tights of the lord jesus as well as
[56:49] the bride
[56:50] and once it moves from the shadow to
[56:53] where it's no longer obscure but now it
[56:56] becomes the real true reality
[57:00] amen
[57:02] see
[57:04] here brother brown says it like this and
[57:06] i want you to just to just to take this
[57:08] in i don't i just some of these i'm just
[57:10] going to preach from
[57:11] brother braham says now if god
[57:14] chose a place it behooves us to find out
[57:17] what he said about it
[57:19] where is it i want to find out because
[57:22] truly i want to worship him amen
[57:26] amen
[57:27] you know i don't think there's anybody
[57:28] who would be sitting here or for that
[57:30] matter i'm just going to go on go out
[57:33] maybe on a limb i don't believe that
[57:35] anybody just wants to just just uh you
[57:37] know do something just of just to do it
[57:40] i believe we're here to seek out truth
[57:43] we want to know it's something in our
[57:46] heart that wants to know we want to know
[57:48] the ground that we're standing on is
[57:50] solid ground
[57:52] because storms are going to count
[57:56] is that right
[57:57] like he said here you eat the bread of
[57:59] affliction testing trials will come
[58:02] right
[58:03] but jesus said
[58:05] what matters where were resting whether
[58:08] we're resting on a rock or sand
[58:12] storms are going to come
[58:14] it's if the storm itself only proves
[58:16] that a believer is a believer
[58:20] and only shows
[58:22] that for a life that maybe hasn't went
[58:25] deep enough
[58:27] are you with me
[58:29] because we can't blame storms on a lack
[58:32] of victory
[58:34] we're all here
[58:35] and look notice what jesus said the the
[58:38] profound statements when he was here
[58:40] knowing that there were people desiring
[58:43] to know the truth
[58:44] he stood before pilate and pilate asked
[58:47] the question what is truth
[58:51] you see a question was asked in that
[58:53] time for even a man to ask a question
[58:55] like that and to recognize the very
[58:58] truth was staring him right in the face
[59:02] it was right in the face
[59:04] jesus did not have to go and go through
[59:06] a whole lecture series it isn't words
[59:09] that break god down
[59:12] it is in words that reveal god but god
[59:15] comes on the scene and reveals himself
[59:18] in his word through his word by his word
[59:22] amen
[59:26] because you see remember what jesus said
[59:29] he said here i am come in my father's
[59:31] name
[59:33] the very life the very promise that was
[59:36] wrote in the scriptures is being made
[59:38] manifest through my life and you call me
[59:41] an evil
[59:44] spirit he was manifesting that word but
[59:47] he says if another will come in his own
[59:49] name
[59:50] his own interpretation
[59:52] his own arrangement of scriptures you
[59:54] will receive him
[59:57] and whatever is received will be
[59:59] reflected
[1:00:01] this is why the baptists reflect
[1:00:03] baptists this is why pentecost reflect
[1:00:06] pentecostal this is why methodists
[1:00:08] reflect mad methodists
[1:00:10] and with me they take on that identity
[1:00:13] they identify with that doctrine
[1:00:15] identify with that creed and they move
[1:00:18] no further
[1:00:22] and yet the pillar of fire was there at
[1:00:24] one point revealing himself in a station
[1:00:28] of the word
[1:00:30] but the pillar of firm moves on god
[1:00:33] is working to bring a full restoration
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] is that right
[1:00:40] so jesus said you shall know the truth
[1:00:43] and the truth
[1:00:45] shall make you free somebody say the
[1:00:46] truth
[1:00:48] the truth shall make you free the truth
[1:00:50] is not a doctrine
[1:00:53] the truth is the person of jesus christ
[1:00:58] he said i am the way
[1:01:02] the truth and the
[1:01:04] lies
[1:01:07] not one of them
[1:01:09] not a value menu
[1:01:12] where you choose whatever value meal you
[1:01:14] want or how you want to arrange it i'm
[1:01:16] not a value menu
[1:01:18] jesus said i am the way
[1:01:22] the truth and the life
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:26] what does that do it puts it back in our
[1:01:28] lap do you want the way do you want the
[1:01:31] truth do you want the life yes
[1:01:35] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:01:38] shall make you free
[1:01:40] now you see
[1:01:41] before you can do anything brother
[1:01:43] brahman says it's simple like this
[1:01:44] before he says you can do anything you
[1:01:46] you don't know what to do
[1:01:48] until you know how to do it
[1:01:51] i want you just let's let the holy
[1:01:52] spirit uncover just
[1:01:54] unfold these things to us this morning
[1:01:56] you don't know what to do until you know
[1:01:58] how to do it
[1:02:00] you must know what you're doing and how
[1:02:02] to do it it's just like let me just drop
[1:02:04] this and move on it's just like in
[1:02:06] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:10] you've got to know how
[1:02:13] and you can't you must anointed until
[1:02:15] you must first know
[1:02:18] what to do and then how to do it
[1:02:21] jesus said repent
[1:02:24] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:02:27] jesus christ and you shall receive the
[1:02:29] gift of the holy ghost now that seems
[1:02:31] very simple it is very simple but what
[1:02:33] you realize is the holy ghost will never
[1:02:37] come into a sinful life amen right
[1:02:42] right a lot of times with kings it's
[1:02:43] like i'm going over we're preaching some
[1:02:45] things on on friday night with the young
[1:02:47] people there we wonder about why don't i
[1:02:50] have the holy ghost you have to first
[1:02:53] come to a complete confession and a
[1:02:56] repentance you can't say god i got all
[1:02:59] this stuff in my life i need the holy
[1:03:02] ghost but god has made a way that if you
[1:03:05] really want the holy ghost you can
[1:03:07] invite the very cleanser himself to come
[1:03:10] in your life and say god clean my life
[1:03:13] up lord i want to be sanctified that i
[1:03:16] can be filled with you lord god that's
[1:03:19] consecrating to god
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:23] you can worship god in your gates
[1:03:27] but god ain't going to receive worship
[1:03:28] unless it's in the gate he places his
[1:03:30] name
[1:03:33] so you must know what you're doing and
[1:03:34] how to do and this is where the enemy
[1:03:36] likes to try to mess with people and try
[1:03:38] to mess with the young people try to
[1:03:40] mess with them because they'll come to
[1:03:42] an altar and look i believe in altar
[1:03:44] calls i believe in all that my point is
[1:03:46] within this is that they're coming god i
[1:03:49] need the holy ghost but it's like coming
[1:03:51] with all this stuff that's in my arms
[1:03:54] and i've got all this right here and i'm
[1:03:56] saying jesus i need the holy ghost jesus
[1:03:59] i need the holy ghost and i got all this
[1:04:01] stuff right
[1:04:03] you've got to let him take it
[1:04:06] you've got to confess
[1:04:08] you've got to confess and repent and
[1:04:10] allow him to come and cleanse those
[1:04:13] things out of your life
[1:04:16] you see many times we've looked at
[1:04:17] things like the holy ghost and just said
[1:04:19] well you know god i mean i'm so sorry
[1:04:21] and i can't do nothing and i i just need
[1:04:24] the holy ghost and if i had the holy
[1:04:25] ghost in the lord i could do all this
[1:04:27] but god wants remember consecration god
[1:04:30] looks at you and i and says how bad do
[1:04:32] you want it
[1:04:34] are you willing to cut things off in
[1:04:36] your life you might say i can't get rid
[1:04:39] of this but there you're in the presence
[1:04:41] of a god that you can invite in your
[1:04:43] life he'll cut every time he'll sanctify
[1:04:46] your life he'll make you a fit place for
[1:04:49] himself to come and dwell in amen
[1:04:54] well i didn't just drop that we preached
[1:04:56] it a little bit
[1:04:59] but i just got to do it as it comes god
[1:05:01] notice god has a meeting place for his
[1:05:03] worshipers in one certain place and in
[1:05:06] that place only god meets his worshipers
[1:05:09] so where god
[1:05:11] has chose to place his name now what is
[1:05:14] his name
[1:05:16] well you say his name is jesus that's
[1:05:18] god coming down and taking on a human
[1:05:20] name so he could relate to us
[1:05:23] that's how he's our high priest are you
[1:05:25] with me
[1:05:26] after the rapture we will not need that
[1:05:28] form of relationship
[1:05:31] right now that's why that god became man
[1:05:34] god became us to an extent to where that
[1:05:37] he can relate to us as a brother
[1:05:40] he can relate to us as a friend god
[1:05:42] became that not a separate person but
[1:05:45] god himself unfolded himself to that
[1:05:48] place that he might know and understand
[1:05:51] you and i as a merciful and faithful
[1:05:54] high priest that's why great is the
[1:05:57] mystery of godliness
[1:06:01] notice his name is his very life
[1:06:04] the very person of himself
[1:06:08] because when i call a name you think of
[1:06:09] a person right
[1:06:11] i mean you know sometimes you might call
[1:06:13] out somebody's name i know how it was
[1:06:14] when i was in teaching you know
[1:06:16] you called out a certain name and they
[1:06:18] call who who i'm not gonna call their
[1:06:20] names here but i said wait a minute are
[1:06:22] you talking about so-and-so and i'd
[1:06:23] identify their last name yep one of the
[1:06:26] same oh boy good luck this year
[1:06:28] you got them in your class good luck
[1:06:31] i'll be praying for you
[1:06:33] because there's a lot of people that can
[1:06:34] have that first name
[1:06:36] hello somebody but the last name is the
[1:06:39] surname which is the family name
[1:06:42] that right there puts an identity right
[1:06:45] there and that's how it is with the
[1:06:47] family of god it's the last name that
[1:06:50] matters where god puts that last name
[1:06:53] there and it is his own life
[1:07:02] see you so it's on his name it's who it
[1:07:04] is
[1:07:05] you see he would confirm
[1:07:07] this chosen place he was vindicated by
[1:07:10] his presence
[1:07:11] this is why you hear the prophet when
[1:07:14] he's standing there and he's getting
[1:07:16] ready in the opening of the seals and he
[1:07:19] makes this statement
[1:07:21] he says
[1:07:22] in this time
[1:07:24] he said not only must it come by
[1:07:26] revelation
[1:07:28] but
[1:07:29] by divine vindication also
[1:07:33] you see why because there's been much
[1:07:35] revelation loose ends
[1:07:37] that were scattered are you with me
[1:07:40] this is why when the old brother branham
[1:07:41] pulled here but brother man didn't pull
[1:07:43] there that was god assembling what god
[1:07:44] had revealed
[1:07:46] and god laid all of that there for this
[1:07:48] moment and this hour so now it's coming
[1:07:51] by divine revelation and vindication of
[1:07:55] his very person what is that that's the
[1:07:58] seal of the living god where god is
[1:08:00] putting his seal upon his own message
[1:08:05] that's why this message is not the
[1:08:06] message of william branham it isn't that
[1:08:09] the sense that god used that vessel but
[1:08:11] this is the message of the living god
[1:08:13] from the crown of almighty god the
[1:08:15] message of god that is sent to call sons
[1:08:18] and daughters of god into the family of
[1:08:20] almighty god
[1:08:23] hallelujah
[1:08:24] oh my it's a gathering that's going on
[1:08:26] in this hour and god is a great
[1:08:29] unchanging god and he can't change i
[1:08:31] like that don't you
[1:08:33] amen that's the only place we can have
[1:08:35] confidence
[1:08:37] in this hour we're living in it ought to
[1:08:39] be more real that's right
[1:08:41] brother brown picks it up in the message
[1:08:43] uncertain sound and through that whole
[1:08:45] time you know even when kennedy was
[1:08:46] elected brother brown picks that up and
[1:08:47] part starts preaching those messages on
[1:08:49] uncertain sound he points out there's
[1:08:52] uncertainty in everything that's around
[1:08:55] us
[1:08:56] but you see god has it that way are you
[1:08:58] hearing me
[1:09:00] don't get caught up in that
[1:09:02] don't get trying to look out there is no
[1:09:04] certain ground out there i don't care
[1:09:06] how a man's persona is how much a man
[1:09:09] could raise his hand and say i swear i
[1:09:12] will do this and i promise to do this
[1:09:14] and i promise you that you don't see the
[1:09:15] back room deals
[1:09:18] come on friends even in the hour that
[1:09:21] we're living in sure the previous
[1:09:23] president many good things that were
[1:09:24] done but there was catholics that was
[1:09:26] put on that supreme court as well
[1:09:29] are you hearing me
[1:09:31] it's filled with catholics now roman
[1:09:34] catholics
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:35] [Applause]
[1:09:36] it shows within these things that even
[1:09:39] don't ever put your hopes in any man
[1:09:44] never you put your hope and your trust
[1:09:47] in almighty god
[1:09:50] that's where we're to draw our strength
[1:09:52] from there's no other place of
[1:09:54] confidence that's how we're to live our
[1:09:56] lives even as families fathers husbands
[1:09:58] mothers brothers sisters we should be a
[1:10:01] confidence that when we address things
[1:10:03] in our home it ought to be addressed by
[1:10:06] the word of god it ought to be a life
[1:10:08] that's lived by the word of god you say
[1:10:10] what's that doing that is producing a
[1:10:13] confidence in the word of god you say
[1:10:15] they don't even got the holy ghost yet
[1:10:17] but brother branham tells us you are to
[1:10:19] be their holy ghost until they get old
[1:10:23] enough to receive it
[1:10:26] it would bring a confidence in
[1:10:29] the word amen
[1:10:31] my lord i don't know if we're going to
[1:10:32] get to where we're going to get to today
[1:10:33] or not
[1:10:34] the only thing i can have confidence in
[1:10:36] is in the bible because whenever god
[1:10:38] acted one time you see it all the way
[1:10:40] through the scriptures
[1:10:42] however god acted one time right
[1:10:45] he ever
[1:10:46] he ever
[1:10:47] you know accepted a man
[1:10:50] that come to him for salvation and the
[1:10:52] basis he accepted him on god will do the
[1:10:54] same thing again
[1:10:56] and again and again and again he said
[1:10:58] i'm god and i
[1:10:59] changed not all right
[1:11:01] amen man one man changes
[1:11:05] how does man change
[1:11:06] because when man doesn't meet god
[1:11:10] then man will come in and they approach
[1:11:13] the word by their intellects
[1:11:16] reasonings and feelings
[1:11:19] boy we're living in a time that don't
[1:11:21] hurt nobody's feelings we're living in a
[1:11:22] time that everything's so hyped up
[1:11:24] emotionally listen that is a sign of the
[1:11:28] time
[1:11:31] is that right that's a sign of the time
[1:11:33] that's taking place even in this hour
[1:11:36] but to recognize that when a man really
[1:11:39] meets god that man meets god because
[1:11:42] there's a confidence he that cometh to
[1:11:43] god must first believe that he is and
[1:11:46] that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:11:49] diligently seek him
[1:11:51] so that way must be opened up the living
[1:11:54] god must be set before us so we can
[1:11:57] actually come to a place to really seek
[1:12:00] after who it is that our heart is
[1:12:03] longing for aren't you glad that god
[1:12:04] makes a way you and i can never have
[1:12:06] found it
[1:12:08] i'll tell you what this is how our lives
[1:12:10] were
[1:12:11] it'd be just like you trying to go to
[1:12:13] some city in some state you take away
[1:12:16] your phone your gps my goodness all the
[1:12:18] tools we've got now you'd have to be
[1:12:19] dumb not to find somewhere they got
[1:12:21] stuff turned here turn there turn here
[1:12:23] turn there approaching the light stop
[1:12:24] here go through this slide do this i
[1:12:26] mean they've got things so far you can
[1:12:28] actually go back and go to sleep in your
[1:12:29] car and pretty soon you know how the
[1:12:31] auto pilots but i don't want one of them
[1:12:33] no
[1:12:34] that's a little carnal but i don't want
[1:12:35] one of those things right there
[1:12:37] but to think all these things that are
[1:12:39] before us roadmaps i remember when my
[1:12:41] daddy would get out the big rand mcnally
[1:12:44] atlas and we would go through and plan
[1:12:47] the trip and it had the little boxes you
[1:12:49] know on the interstate and that little
[1:12:51] white box with the number next to it 152
[1:12:55] it was an exit
[1:12:57] now you could go and start planning on
[1:13:00] that there were certain things about you
[1:13:02] know what well i think we're going to do
[1:13:03] go drive halfway we're going to stop
[1:13:05] about this exit right here it was a
[1:13:07] pathway or a road map that you knew
[1:13:10] where you were going and you knew glory
[1:13:12] be to god there were junctions or
[1:13:14] stopping places along the way and that's
[1:13:17] exactly what god himself does he don't
[1:13:20] leave you and out of wonder he opens and
[1:13:22] reveals the way and lets you and i know
[1:13:25] there are junctions there are places so
[1:13:28] you're not wondering lord am i very
[1:13:30] editor lord and you know i i wanna i
[1:13:33] really wanna serve you but you can
[1:13:34] actually begin to look in your life and
[1:13:36] say praise god i might still have the
[1:13:39] things in my life but i know that i have
[1:13:42] seen him and i want to be sanctified and
[1:13:45] then you come to the next place and
[1:13:48] knowing on the pathway that god you're
[1:13:50] the god that cleans me up lord i want to
[1:13:53] surrender all of my life and hear you
[1:13:55] move into that place and then you come
[1:13:57] to the next part and say god lord take
[1:14:01] me in lord baptize me into the body what
[1:14:04] is it you've got a clear road map
[1:14:10] sometimes on that road map you got to
[1:14:11] stick to it
[1:14:13] yeah because you get off on that road
[1:14:14] map you know how it is
[1:14:16] we've all had relatives that want to
[1:14:18] tell us i'll take a shortcut yeah right
[1:14:20] [Laughter]
[1:14:22] well we're going to take the scenic
[1:14:23] route they meant it all right
[1:14:25] you're going to be seeing scenery for
[1:14:26] days
[1:14:28] but see god ain't interested in taking
[1:14:30] us on shortcuts because there's no
[1:14:32] shortcuts
[1:14:34] into the body of jesus christ
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:37] man might offer shortcuts handshake sign
[1:14:39] this that's shortcuts that's not god's
[1:14:42] way
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:45] god has made a basis now let's look here
[1:14:48] in the scripture let's look here in john
[1:14:49] chapter 4 verse 7.
[1:14:52] here in john chapter 4 verse 7
[1:14:55] hear the lord jesus
[1:14:58] he reserves he holds himself back when
[1:15:00] the rest of the disciples
[1:15:02] they need to go get food right
[1:15:05] why do they need food
[1:15:07] hungry
[1:15:08] anybody still get hungry don't raise
[1:15:10] your hand if you're hungry right now
[1:15:12] because i am too
[1:15:16] but that ain't even on my thoughts right
[1:15:17] now
[1:15:18] but i know right
[1:15:20] but natural natural hunger nothing wrong
[1:15:22] with going to get something to eat
[1:15:24] is that right they needed to go
[1:15:27] do that that was a natural
[1:15:29] thirst
[1:15:31] in their life
[1:15:33] even the lord jesus himself
[1:15:36] remember he got hungry even in the
[1:15:38] temptations and so forth now here is it
[1:15:41] comes into
[1:15:42] here the lord jesus there's an
[1:15:44] appointment that has been arranged
[1:15:47] this is an appointment
[1:15:49] that god himself has made in his great
[1:15:52] appointment book before the foundation
[1:15:54] of the world
[1:15:56] before the devil was ever the devil
[1:15:58] before there was adam stardust molecule
[1:15:59] for there was angels or anything else
[1:16:01] this appointment book brother vivian was
[1:16:03] already
[1:16:04] set
[1:16:06] it's like you know when you you get into
[1:16:08] things sometimes there was just you know
[1:16:09] some months ago a brother had called me
[1:16:11] and i was out in other meetings asked me
[1:16:13] and said hey brother samuel could you
[1:16:14] come and do this particular meeting for
[1:16:16] us and i said brother i'll pray about it
[1:16:18] i i think right now i'd be all right to
[1:16:20] do that and i began to look at and i had
[1:16:22] already done it one time already this
[1:16:24] this year already and had to call a
[1:16:25] brother and say you know what i can't
[1:16:27] come because that's my son's graduation
[1:16:29] so i'm sorry brother i had committed to
[1:16:31] coming but fortunately i was only a
[1:16:32] couple days later you know i could you
[1:16:34] know you get out of that but i i looked
[1:16:36] at it and i thought well i thought you
[1:16:38] know i i think i can do it you know
[1:16:40] inspiration i begin to feel inspiration
[1:16:42] and i always wait for that too you know
[1:16:43] my in my sense is there inspiration that
[1:16:46] god has given me towards that and so
[1:16:48] when i begin to look at it i begin to
[1:16:50] talk with my wife and but something
[1:16:52] would not allow me to commit to it and i
[1:16:54] finally i pulled up my you know your
[1:16:56] google calendar and i pulled it up and i
[1:16:58] realized because i have to put
[1:16:59] everything in there i know i'm only 46
[1:17:01] years old but i got to put everything in
[1:17:04] there even when one of you all asked me
[1:17:06] hey brother samuel can you call me on a
[1:17:07] certain date that's why many times that
[1:17:09] it might seem like i'm going blank but
[1:17:11] i'm putting it there on the calendar so
[1:17:12] i don't forget
[1:17:15] i got to looking brother joey and i
[1:17:17] thought something don't sound right
[1:17:19] and i got to looking in there and i
[1:17:21] realized oh
[1:17:22] i've got a youth meeting already
[1:17:24] scheduled at my house
[1:17:26] for that date so i called the brother up
[1:17:28] i said no
[1:17:29] i said the young people i said i already
[1:17:31] have a meeting with my young people it's
[1:17:32] been planned i said a month out in
[1:17:34] advance i said so brother i said i'm
[1:17:36] sorry i said but i'm sure you can get
[1:17:37] somebody else i'll be praying for the
[1:17:39] meeting and so forth but i want i'm
[1:17:41] right here
[1:17:42] so when you begin to look at that i'll
[1:17:44] give you that little example as it would
[1:17:45] come to me of how that god himself hear
[1:17:48] the appointment book that was made in
[1:17:50] the mind of god from before the
[1:17:52] foundation of the world and here the
[1:17:53] lord jesus himself is now god manifested
[1:17:57] on earth to keep every appointment
[1:18:02] now i can tell you right now with the
[1:18:04] person that he's getting ready to
[1:18:06] interact with there were many people
[1:18:08] that had appointments with her but they
[1:18:10] didn't have good appointments
[1:18:13] are you with me there were many people
[1:18:15] that would not have even had an
[1:18:16] appointment not even given her the time
[1:18:18] of day you were telling me we don't even
[1:18:20] know this we don't even know this little
[1:18:21] woman's name but if you were to mention
[1:18:23] her name in town no doubt many would
[1:18:25] know oh no no no no not her not her no
[1:18:28] no not her they would not want to give
[1:18:29] her the time of day but you see now
[1:18:31] there's an appointment that's taking
[1:18:33] place because now here god's word is on
[1:18:37] the scene now what's needed this word
[1:18:40] being on the scene meaning the living
[1:18:41] god himself in the fulfillment of his
[1:18:43] word is now coming and here is one of
[1:18:47] his words that is laying in seed form in
[1:18:51] her life and now he's coming into a
[1:18:54] place to bring the living reality of the
[1:18:57] living god to her
[1:18:59] you know why because she's got a thirst
[1:19:02] and a hunger
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:05] notice in verse seven there cometh for
[1:19:07] woman of samaria
[1:19:08] to draw water
[1:19:11] jesus said unto her give me to drink
[1:19:14] for his disciples were gone away into
[1:19:15] the city to buy me then saith the woman
[1:19:17] of samaria unto him how is it that thou
[1:19:20] being a jew asketh drink of me which am
[1:19:23] a woman of samaria for the jews have no
[1:19:26] dealings with the samaritans
[1:19:30] there's nobody can cross can conquer
[1:19:31] racial divides like jesus
[1:19:34] are you with me right amen
[1:19:37] john 4 10 jesus answered and said unto
[1:19:39] her
[1:19:40] if
[1:19:42] thou newest
[1:19:43] the gift of god
[1:19:45] and who it is that saith to thee
[1:19:49] give me
[1:19:50] to drink
[1:19:51] thou wouldest have asked of him and he
[1:19:55] would have given thee
[1:19:57] living water
[1:19:58] now right here i'm sure she's not aware
[1:20:01] of what's going on but if we could
[1:20:03] actually go back and pull her up right
[1:20:05] now
[1:20:05] she could tell you that there was
[1:20:08] something that was different at that
[1:20:10] moment
[1:20:11] there was a presence about that man that
[1:20:14] this man that what she saw was just a
[1:20:16] man but there was a respect and a love
[1:20:20] that was emanating glory be to god from
[1:20:23] this man that she had never since before
[1:20:28] but yet it's what she craved
[1:20:33] oh glory be to god
[1:20:35] and here she is standing there and he's
[1:20:37] trying to alert her to the place if thou
[1:20:40] knewest the gift of god
[1:20:44] god's gift it's god himself
[1:20:48] the holy ghost
[1:20:50] and the holy ghost operating in his word
[1:20:52] you see it wasn't so much that that she
[1:20:55] would recognize or you know many times
[1:20:57] people think well if i could only see
[1:20:59] jesus and they're looking for a corporal
[1:21:01] body will only see the corporal body if
[1:21:04] you've been united with him in the form
[1:21:06] of his word by the baptism of the holy
[1:21:10] ghost
[1:21:11] because the holy spirit is what that's
[1:21:14] who god is that's who the lord jesus is
[1:21:16] are you with me he says i go away and
[1:21:18] then i will come again
[1:21:20] and i will receive you unto myself so
[1:21:22] the holy ghost is the same person of
[1:21:26] jesus christ that's now being revealed
[1:21:29] in his word just as he was in luke
[1:21:31] chapter 24 remember their eyes were
[1:21:34] withholding that they shouldn't know him
[1:21:36] and yet he's the very one that they
[1:21:38] fished with slept around and everything
[1:21:40] else they didn't know him their eyes
[1:21:43] were withholding but he took them into
[1:21:46] the word and he began to reveal himself
[1:21:50] in his promised word and confirmed that
[1:21:52] to them why because they must as
[1:21:55] believers recognize him in the
[1:21:57] fulfillment of his word
[1:22:00] and because they recognized him in the
[1:22:02] fulfillment of his word what did the
[1:22:04] word tell him he told him go up to
[1:22:06] jerusalem wait until you be endued with
[1:22:08] power from on high amen you see the
[1:22:11] vindicated word the living word will
[1:22:14] always call you and i to a living word
[1:22:17] experience
[1:22:20] it's not enough just to know the living
[1:22:21] word
[1:22:22] but to understand the purpose of the
[1:22:24] living word coming that you might have a
[1:22:26] living word experience
[1:22:31] let me tell you something many people
[1:22:32] can know brother branham was a prophet
[1:22:35] the devil knows that
[1:22:37] the bible says that the devil believes
[1:22:39] that jesus is god the christ and he
[1:22:43] trembles
[1:22:44] come on the devil ain't no make-believer
[1:22:47] that guy's a believer he believes
[1:22:51] but there's one thing in different
[1:22:52] between the devil and that of a believer
[1:22:54] the devil can never ever become a
[1:22:58] full-fledged holy ghost born believer he
[1:23:01] can never get where you are when you've
[1:23:04] been baptized with the holy ghost why
[1:23:06] he'd have to repent he'd have to be
[1:23:08] baptized he'd have to come the same way
[1:23:11] and if he does that he would mar
[1:23:13] his inheritance
[1:23:17] are you with me he would marry who he is
[1:23:24] notice give me
[1:23:25] to drink
[1:23:27] he's you would say give me notice you
[1:23:29] would ask give me to drink and thou
[1:23:32] wouldest have asked of him and he would
[1:23:34] have given the living water
[1:23:35] is this simple
[1:23:37] if you knew
[1:23:38] who it was it's talking you would ask
[1:23:41] give me drink yes
[1:23:44] give me drink
[1:23:45] give me this living water
[1:23:49] so verse 11 notice sir thou has nothing
[1:23:52] to draw with and the well is deep
[1:23:54] from whence then hast thou
[1:23:57] that living water
[1:24:00] see he's getting her to open up
[1:24:03] he's getting her to open
[1:24:05] art thou greater than our father jacob
[1:24:07] which gave us the will and drank thereof
[1:24:10] himself and his children and his cattle
[1:24:12] and jesus answered and said unto her
[1:24:15] whosoever drinketh
[1:24:17] of this water speaking out of that well
[1:24:20] shall thirst
[1:24:22] again
[1:24:23] what's he dealing with natural
[1:24:26] desire
[1:24:27] natural
[1:24:29] thirst
[1:24:30] now think about this whosoever drinketh
[1:24:33] of the water that i shall give him shall
[1:24:36] never
[1:24:37] thirst well this is a different kind of
[1:24:39] thirst
[1:24:41] but the water that i shall give him
[1:24:42] shall be in him
[1:24:44] a well of water springing up into
[1:24:46] everlasting life
[1:24:48] the woman said unto him sir
[1:24:51] give me this water
[1:24:54] that i first not neither come hether to
[1:24:57] draw
[1:24:59] amen now remember she's still looking at
[1:25:02] it in a natural way but what is taking
[1:25:05] place by being there as an attribute of
[1:25:08] god she doesn't realize this she does
[1:25:11] not know exactly who it is she really is
[1:25:14] her true identity but the word knows who
[1:25:16] she is and the word is moving in her
[1:25:19] life and though her understanding is not
[1:25:21] complete in this moment but her
[1:25:23] understanding at that time she knows i
[1:25:26] need a living water i need something
[1:25:29] that's real i'm tired of doing the same
[1:25:32] thing again and again and again and
[1:25:35] again i want that living water
[1:25:38] i'm thirsty
[1:25:40] you know what thirst is it's a painful
[1:25:43] desire
[1:25:46] this young woman she had a painful
[1:25:49] desire
[1:25:51] now she had natural thirst
[1:25:54] water
[1:25:55] food
[1:25:56] all those things are in our life that we
[1:25:58] have natural desires for let me tell you
[1:26:00] brother brad would bring this down he
[1:26:01] said it's a natural desire for a woman
[1:26:03] to want to look pretty
[1:26:06] so natural god has put that in that's
[1:26:08] not sinful
[1:26:10] but what makes it sinful is when satan
[1:26:13] starts interpreting
[1:26:15] what pretty is
[1:26:17] right and anything satan gets a hold of
[1:26:19] it's a perversion
[1:26:21] because what everything that satan does
[1:26:23] when he he takes the women maybe he
[1:26:25] don't strip them off he just skins it
[1:26:27] down in them tight winter weener dresses
[1:26:29] where every form and figure and
[1:26:30] everything else is all around and then
[1:26:32] they wonder why why do i get the kind of
[1:26:35] looks i get why do i get the man i get
[1:26:37] or this or that because the man is not
[1:26:39] attracted to the character he's
[1:26:40] attracted to what's on display
[1:26:43] i'm going to preach and how is it coming
[1:26:47] you see what it is that love that beauty
[1:26:50] that desire it's nothing wrong with
[1:26:51] wanting to look beautiful but you
[1:26:53] remember while you adorn yourself on the
[1:26:55] end on the outside should match the
[1:26:58] character that's on the inside
[1:27:01] the outside is only a reflection of the
[1:27:03] true character on the inside the
[1:27:06] character that is in submission and
[1:27:08] subjection to the word of god that's why
[1:27:11] a real woman cannot say well yes i'm in
[1:27:13] subjection to god and they still wear
[1:27:15] all sorts of things of the world
[1:27:17] painting their face and doing everything
[1:27:18] else why because the inner person is
[1:27:21] still not in subjection to the word of
[1:27:24] god but when the inside one gets in
[1:27:27] subjection to the word of god it'll show
[1:27:30] on the outside
[1:27:37] i don't want to come here no more but
[1:27:39] now she's probably going to have to go
[1:27:40] back to that well to get natural water
[1:27:44] but what jesus here is tapping into
[1:27:47] is to bring a deliverance to her life
[1:27:49] because another natural desire
[1:27:52] that she has
[1:27:54] is to be loved
[1:27:56] brother brown picks that up in the
[1:27:57] message thirst he said for a young
[1:27:59] person it's a natural desire to be loved
[1:28:01] natural desire he said to avoid a woman
[1:28:04] to want a husband
[1:28:06] vice versa young man
[1:28:08] natural desires but you see upon those
[1:28:10] natural desires how satan
[1:28:12] would love to come
[1:28:15] and come at those natural desires
[1:28:17] so much so that this
[1:28:20] this little lady that we're reading
[1:28:22] about she wouldn't been regarded as a
[1:28:24] lady at this time by the people of the
[1:28:26] city
[1:28:27] but you look at how what jesus is going
[1:28:29] to start
[1:28:30] dealing with now he's moving into this
[1:28:32] place to where this spiritual
[1:28:35] thirst he's dealing with a spiritual
[1:28:37] thirst and now he's going to deal with
[1:28:40] where the root of the problem i'm so
[1:28:41] glad that jesus helps you and i to know
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:45] oh lord i want to know the way well you
[1:28:47] can't know what to do until you know how
[1:28:49] to do it
[1:28:50] notice what he does
[1:28:52] jesus said unto her
[1:28:53] go call your husband and come hither
[1:28:57] and the woman answered and said
[1:28:59] i have no husband
[1:29:01] jesus said unto her thou hast well said
[1:29:05] i have no husband you see what's
[1:29:07] happened the word is dealing with those
[1:29:10] things that satan has perverted to try
[1:29:14] to quench that holy thirst
[1:29:17] she's been with man after man after man
[1:29:19] look you can flip it around and talk
[1:29:21] about man being with woman after a woman
[1:29:23] or looking upon things and every trying
[1:29:25] to satisfy
[1:29:27] a holy thirst that god put there
[1:29:30] some will turn to looking at things on
[1:29:31] the internet some will turn to you know
[1:29:33] the bottle or drugs or anything else
[1:29:35] what is it they're trying to satisfy
[1:29:38] that thirst that god put in there let me
[1:29:41] tell you something a church didn't put
[1:29:43] that thirst in you your mom and daddy
[1:29:45] didn't put that thirst in you the
[1:29:47] prophet didn't put that thirst in you
[1:29:49] that thirst was in you all the time in
[1:29:53] your life and that's why you searched
[1:29:55] here you searched there you saw glory be
[1:29:58] to god as a young person you tried this
[1:30:01] friend you tried that friend you tried
[1:30:04] this and you try that but there's
[1:30:06] nothing could satisfy that why it's not
[1:30:09] a natural desire
[1:30:11] it's a spiritual desire that only god
[1:30:15] himself
[1:30:17] can satisfy
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:28] let me read the next verse here
[1:30:30] for thou has had five husbands
[1:30:33] and he
[1:30:34] whom thou asked
[1:30:36] is not thy husband
[1:30:39] in that
[1:30:41] in that
[1:30:44] said is thou true
[1:30:46] see what he's the words identifying
[1:30:49] it's identifying
[1:30:51] the attributes of unbelief that's been
[1:30:53] in her life
[1:30:55] what are those attributes and remember
[1:30:56] all the attributes smoking drinking all
[1:30:59] those things those are only attributes
[1:31:00] of one sin
[1:31:03] unbelief amen
[1:31:05] it's unbelief
[1:31:07] so now that undoubt that unbelief
[1:31:10] it's being addressed
[1:31:13] did you see what one is down there
[1:31:14] notice notice the approach here
[1:31:17] remember he said if you would have asked
[1:31:18] me if you ask i will give you this
[1:31:21] living water now what's he dealing with
[1:31:23] it's kind of like i stepped out here
[1:31:24] with all them bottles
[1:31:26] in my arms
[1:31:28] right right
[1:31:30] but he identifies go call your husband
[1:31:35] now she had a choice at that time
[1:31:37] she could have took her water pot and
[1:31:38] said you know what
[1:31:40] you ain't getting in my private life
[1:31:42] all right i'm going to worship god but
[1:31:44] you ain't touching my private life
[1:31:51] but here she is in the presence of god
[1:31:53] hallelujah
[1:31:57] and she confesses
[1:32:00] what the word
[1:32:02] has spoken
[1:32:04] she doesn't try to get away from it
[1:32:06] she doesn't try to run around it it's a
[1:32:08] sacred moment there between her and god
[1:32:11] i tell you friends that is such a
[1:32:13] blessing to a believer that when god can
[1:32:16] come down and the heart and the life and
[1:32:18] the believer can say yes lord that's
[1:32:21] true that's my life lord god that's
[1:32:23] exactly where i'm at
[1:32:26] that is a blessing if she would not have
[1:32:29] done that
[1:32:30] in the story
[1:32:32] she could have continued to come to
[1:32:35] jacob's well
[1:32:38] and she remained thirsty
[1:32:41] spiritually
[1:32:43] what would the end of being well it kind
[1:32:45] of seems like that where the pattern is
[1:32:47] going that after a period of time that
[1:32:49] we could if we had a sheet of stopped
[1:32:50] right here and walked away she might
[1:32:53] eventually been on her 13th husband
[1:32:56] hello somebody
[1:32:58] i mean we know marriage and divorce is
[1:33:00] still wrong
[1:33:01] is that right
[1:33:04] it's the word of god
[1:33:06] god is coming to deal with these
[1:33:08] situations that's right here present in
[1:33:11] the word of god
[1:33:13] and we don't believe marriage and
[1:33:14] divorce the way that the bad that the
[1:33:15] way the world wants to interpret it that
[1:33:17] when you get tired of somebody you
[1:33:18] divorce them and get somebody else that
[1:33:20] is not god's order
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:24] it gets down pretty pretty sticky and
[1:33:26] pretty tight as well because i know a
[1:33:28] lot of times a man wants to feel like
[1:33:29] well you know my wife ran out on me so i
[1:33:32] got a right to remarry but what about if
[1:33:34] you in your life were not living a real
[1:33:37] godly life in your home i'm not talking
[1:33:40] about just warming a church pew i'm not
[1:33:42] talking about just associating around
[1:33:44] the message but you weren't sorry enough
[1:33:47] to live a real godly life then you are
[1:33:50] guilty
[1:33:52] yes sir
[1:33:54] there is an answer for these things
[1:33:58] there is a remedy i pray for god's grace
[1:34:01] friends but this woman right here if
[1:34:03] this thirst if she walked away and said
[1:34:06] you're not dealing with that area of my
[1:34:08] life she would have continued on and it
[1:34:10] would have been worse for her
[1:34:14] that's right
[1:34:15] she might have found a millionaire of
[1:34:17] her dreams she might have the rich young
[1:34:18] ruler built more barns after he turned
[1:34:21] jesus down
[1:34:22] his stocks went up
[1:34:25] he became so profitable
[1:34:27] yeah
[1:34:29] as i said with the young people there on
[1:34:31] thursday night here was a young man that
[1:34:33] could stand in the face of the lord
[1:34:34] jesus and not a finger laid on his life
[1:34:39] he knew the message he knew the prophet
[1:34:41] moses but he had it maybe on his head as
[1:34:44] an ornament of grace had it has chains
[1:34:46] about his neck he had it all written
[1:34:48] upon you know upon his heart he had all
[1:34:50] these things i've hid it in my heart but
[1:34:52] what he didn't have it because he
[1:34:54] couldn't get there yet was down into the
[1:34:56] innermost part of his heart in his soul
[1:34:59] to wear to the word it was not something
[1:35:01] out here as a natural adornment but it
[1:35:03] became a living reality on the inside of
[1:35:07] his life
[1:35:09] and eventually that rich young ruler he
[1:35:11] took the crumbs remember thou shalt love
[1:35:13] thy neighbor as thyself he took the
[1:35:15] crumbs gave it to dogs over top of
[1:35:17] lazarus
[1:35:18] victory you would wonder why how man
[1:35:20] he's been raised in a message how could
[1:35:21] he get away from it because where the
[1:35:22] message was at in his life was not where
[1:35:24] it should
[1:35:27] the be was here
[1:35:29] it was in spirit in his spirit oh he
[1:35:32] knew it
[1:35:34] but satan will come to test where is it
[1:35:37] in your life
[1:35:39] where is it at in your life is it really
[1:35:41] the anchor and the absolute
[1:35:44] of your life
[1:35:46] but saying you know that's pretty
[1:35:47] straight we're interested in getting to
[1:35:48] the other side
[1:35:51] we're not interested in pats on the back
[1:35:53] i just heard the prophet of god say it
[1:35:54] last night when that woman was dying
[1:35:56] there and here she was she had lived
[1:35:58] every way she wanted to live sunday
[1:36:00] school teacher played the music on
[1:36:02] instruments in church she was patted on
[1:36:04] the back and everything else but when it
[1:36:06] came time for her to die and eventually
[1:36:08] when that soul caught up with her she
[1:36:10] realized go get the pastor she said i'm
[1:36:13] lost and the pastor what did he come in
[1:36:15] and do he said give her another shot of
[1:36:16] hypo she said get out of here you
[1:36:19] deceiver you've lied to me
[1:36:22] her soul was exposed
[1:36:25] the soul that sinneth
[1:36:28] shall
[1:36:29] die
[1:36:40] oh god be merciful
[1:36:42] oh jesus
[1:36:44] notice where the word is doing
[1:36:47] she's receiving leadership
[1:36:50] because the word is dealing with her
[1:36:52] life
[1:36:54] to lead her
[1:36:56] into a place to where she's
[1:36:58] agreeing with the word
[1:37:00] you know you first have to come into
[1:37:01] agreeance with the word
[1:37:04] that's the grace of god even a new heart
[1:37:06] and a new spirit is a new way of
[1:37:08] thinking
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:10] is that right
[1:37:11] so god's leading he's trying what's he
[1:37:13] doing he's getting that old nature
[1:37:15] to agree with him
[1:37:17] then here she begins to side with the
[1:37:19] word
[1:37:20] that's
[1:37:21] true lord
[1:37:23] right
[1:37:24] see she's starting at the right place
[1:37:27] she's believing it the next thing
[1:37:29] is a complete and thorough
[1:37:31] repentance
[1:37:35] i want you to think about it
[1:37:38] that infidel that
[1:37:40] brother branham was out there hunting
[1:37:42] look how brother branham was blood
[1:37:44] squirrel all over him
[1:37:46] probably looked like we do sometimes
[1:37:47] coming out of the wood blood
[1:37:48] on our fingernails and stuff and
[1:37:51] dirt and every it wouldn't have been you
[1:37:52] as a man that's a respectable man of god
[1:37:57] brother brown here he has beard on his
[1:37:58] face
[1:38:00] right
[1:38:01] he stands there and begins to talk to
[1:38:02] that
[1:38:04] man who's known as an infidel i want you
[1:38:06] to watch this approach
[1:38:07] brother branham never
[1:38:10] ever
[1:38:10] condemns that man
[1:38:14] you know why
[1:38:15] he's going to point him by the grace of
[1:38:17] god to the source
[1:38:18] that'll help him all right
[1:38:20] that's good he's going to point him to
[1:38:22] the source that's going to help him
[1:38:23] right now you're wrong but you're wrong
[1:38:25] you're this
[1:38:26] i don't do nothing right matter of fact
[1:38:28] he wouldn't have been a hunt there
[1:38:31] right
[1:38:33] well that fellow wasn't knowing
[1:38:34] something from kentucky he might have
[1:38:35] got scanned right there
[1:38:39] but instead
[1:38:40] he begins to speak to this man
[1:38:42] but using god's one of god's first
[1:38:45] bibles
[1:38:47] nature
[1:38:49] and god begins to unfold himself because
[1:38:51] this man don't know chapters he don't
[1:38:53] know scriptures he don't even if he
[1:38:55] didn't know that he still needs to know
[1:38:57] the living god
[1:38:59] and it begins to unfold
[1:39:02] right there in that time what happens
[1:39:04] that man as he
[1:39:05] begins to
[1:39:06] agree brother brother man begins to talk
[1:39:08] to him you know how it goes on brother
[1:39:09] man starts talking to him and said well
[1:39:11] he says now
[1:39:12] he said you know you put water on that
[1:39:14] post and well why don't the water go
[1:39:17] down he said i never thought that before
[1:39:18] see what's he doing getting him to think
[1:39:21] is that right
[1:39:23] then he starts talking you know but
[1:39:24] first the first thing about it before
[1:39:26] brother brown went into that
[1:39:28] i hope it's all right
[1:39:30] because if not we're still going here
[1:39:32] anyhow
[1:39:34] but brother branham began remembering
[1:39:35] the man said you know what there is a
[1:39:37] preacher one time
[1:39:39] i'd like to ask him a few questions
[1:39:40] because he goes into a testimony of what
[1:39:42] happened on the hill over there
[1:39:45] and what did brother bram say you don't
[1:39:47] believe that do you
[1:39:49] man said i know one thing that woman was
[1:39:51] bedfast was bedridden and i know one
[1:39:53] thing she ate that way no more brother
[1:39:56] said really you believe that brother
[1:39:57] that said see what's happening he said
[1:39:59] he's starting to decide
[1:40:01] what's he doing he's opening up why
[1:40:03] there was a thirst
[1:40:05] down there in that man's life
[1:40:11] hallelujah
[1:40:12] and brother branham began to stand there
[1:40:14] as an instrument
[1:40:16] and begin to preach that of god
[1:40:19] revealing himself hiding himself in
[1:40:22] nature right there in that apple tree
[1:40:24] until eventually brother branham said
[1:40:27] when you can tell me the the one that
[1:40:30] causes the sack to go in the roots and
[1:40:32] stay there until the winters pass then i
[1:40:36] will tell you
[1:40:37] how that was done up there he said
[1:40:39] you're not that preacher he said i am
[1:40:42] would you recognize his name if i told
[1:40:45] you he said sure he said my name is
[1:40:47] william brattle he said that's it right
[1:40:50] there
[1:40:51] right there that man was led to the lord
[1:40:54] it wasn't in a church building but the
[1:40:56] lord jesus was on the grounds right
[1:41:00] there at sportsman's hollow
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:09] this woman let me try to finish this
[1:41:12] sir i perceive that you're a prophet
[1:41:15] oh
[1:41:16] my things are being uncovered in our
[1:41:19] life
[1:41:22] there's a presence about it
[1:41:24] the presence of the lord
[1:41:26] our fathers notice now questions our
[1:41:28] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[1:41:30] you say that in this jerusalem is the
[1:41:31] place where men ought to worship jesus
[1:41:33] said unto here woman believe me
[1:41:35] the hour cometh when you shall neither
[1:41:37] in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[1:41:40] worship
[1:41:41] the father
[1:41:42] ye worship you know not what we know
[1:41:45] what we worship for salvation is of
[1:41:49] the jews
[1:41:50] but the hour cometh and now
[1:41:53] is notice its transition time
[1:41:57] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:42:00] the father in spirit
[1:42:02] and in truth for the father seeketh such
[1:42:06] to worship him
[1:42:08] notice
[1:42:09] it's not just spirit
[1:42:12] it's not just truth either
[1:42:14] a person could have a law have all truth
[1:42:17] and no god present
[1:42:19] right
[1:42:22] they can have spirit
[1:42:24] and no truth at all
[1:42:28] now friends listen don't tell me
[1:42:30] they're getting under their own i know
[1:42:31] sometimes there's evil spirits but
[1:42:32] sometimes even with different things
[1:42:34] where they can they get under the
[1:42:35] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:42:38] who do you think it is that when they go
[1:42:39] pray for people and people are made are
[1:42:42] made whole it ain't the person who's
[1:42:44] laid hands on them no more it is your
[1:42:46] hands
[1:42:47] it's the person's faith in god
[1:42:51] amen is that right
[1:42:53] but if it's just in spirit are you
[1:42:55] hearing me now there's no life
[1:42:58] to back it up
[1:43:02] yet it can claim spirit spirit
[1:43:05] but yet
[1:43:06] the life is contrary to the word
[1:43:09] and remember what it'll fall back on is
[1:43:11] well praise god i've got gifts in my
[1:43:12] life
[1:43:14] praise god i shout praise god i do this
[1:43:16] and praise god i do that
[1:43:18] but no
[1:43:19] spirit and
[1:43:21] truth
[1:43:22] it's resting on
[1:43:24] the anointing of the spirit
[1:43:26] upon the flesh
[1:43:28] upon the spirit
[1:43:30] upon their mind
[1:43:33] is that right jesus said many will come
[1:43:35] to me in that day
[1:43:36] and they will give a whole list and i
[1:43:38] not done this i did this i did that i
[1:43:40] did this i did that i did this and jesus
[1:43:41] said depart from me you
[1:43:43] workers
[1:43:44] of iniquity
[1:43:46] for i never knew you relationship
[1:43:51] but then again a person could have truth
[1:43:54] form of godliness but deny the power
[1:43:57] thereof
[1:43:58] god have truth oh we have all the
[1:44:00] mysteries we understand all this we are
[1:44:02] we have all the truth but no dynamics
[1:44:04] and no life
[1:44:07] same shape
[1:44:08] i said same shape
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:10] jesus said true worshipers are those who
[1:44:13] will worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:44:19] between some the pharisees had truth as
[1:44:21] far as scriptures they had words down
[1:44:24] they knew all of this they you go man
[1:44:26] you could just push the button and
[1:44:27] they'd rehearse the psalm they had their
[1:44:30] lives were such a rehearsed life
[1:44:32] right and the sad thing about it is
[1:44:35] that's all it was
[1:44:37] was no more than a rehearsed lifestyle
[1:44:42] they knew the tenants knew what to do
[1:44:45] here knew what to do here but they
[1:44:47] couldn't recognize the god
[1:44:50] of the word oh
[1:44:51] friends i'm telling you what a
[1:44:52] privileged people that you and i are is
[1:44:54] to recognize god for who he really is
[1:44:59] when you recognize that the message and
[1:45:00] you see what god has done for us in this
[1:45:03] hour that the message is not a bank of
[1:45:05] doctrine but the message is god himself
[1:45:08] come down to the church of the living
[1:45:11] god to reveal himself in his word and to
[1:45:14] make himself known to the believers that
[1:45:17] you can too have a living word
[1:45:20] experience
[1:45:23] what does what does his presence do it
[1:45:26] raises the certainty of his promise
[1:45:35] this young woman
[1:45:39] she wants to worship
[1:45:41] everybody agree with that
[1:45:43] she wants to worship
[1:45:46] she wants to worship the living god
[1:45:49] there's a desire
[1:45:51] that she has
[1:45:53] within her life
[1:45:55] now let me just let me read a little
[1:45:56] something here before i
[1:45:58] before i move on here
[1:46:01] sometimes you wonder and you look
[1:46:03] sometimes in situations
[1:46:05] that sometimes a person or people can
[1:46:07] come into
[1:46:10] you can look at it and say oh
[1:46:13] this person or this or that but
[1:46:15] sometimes
[1:46:16] not that it makes exceptions or we
[1:46:18] compromise but sometimes when you know
[1:46:20] some of the background on it you can
[1:46:22] step back and say
[1:46:23] wow
[1:46:25] how great is our god
[1:46:27] brother brown goes into her life
[1:46:30] and he says this little woman
[1:46:32] ill-famed we call her sometimes
[1:46:35] a prostitute notice this
[1:46:37] sometimes
[1:46:39] maybe the child had been turned out on
[1:46:41] the street
[1:46:42] sometimes like now it ain't altogether
[1:46:44] juvenile delinquents it's parent
[1:46:46] delinquents
[1:46:48] let the little lady get out and act like
[1:46:50] that
[1:46:51] you know what that says to me it's a
[1:46:53] responsibility as parents brother brown
[1:46:55] says you keep this is direct words from
[1:46:57] the prophet brother adam what should we
[1:46:59] allow our kids what kind of activities
[1:47:01] should we allow our teenagers to
[1:47:03] participate in direct quote he said you
[1:47:06] make sure you keep them in christian
[1:47:09] company
[1:47:10] as long as you can
[1:47:13] amen that's direct words
[1:47:17] i believe that
[1:47:18] you understand i believe that brother
[1:47:20] brown says you wonder why this one gets
[1:47:22] out and becomes a thief who they're
[1:47:23] hanging around
[1:47:27] are you with me
[1:47:29] this puts such a responsibility to
[1:47:31] recognize that has they just they just
[1:47:33] turned around brother saying i ain't
[1:47:34] turning them out but it's to lead them
[1:47:36] also in the right way
[1:47:39] oh brother samuel i believe the message
[1:47:41] what do your footsteps say
[1:47:44] what do our footsteps say
[1:47:46] remember the little boy coming home
[1:47:47] behind his dad little boy was doing this
[1:47:51] falling in the snow
[1:47:53] and that man looked back he kind of
[1:47:54] sobered up a little bit what are you
[1:47:55] doing
[1:47:57] just following you daddy
[1:47:59] right in your footsteps
[1:48:01] see children only know
[1:48:03] the value
[1:48:04] of what you say is valuable
[1:48:07] are you hearing me
[1:48:10] rocco you know what i'm you know i'm
[1:48:12] getting ready to say sister maria
[1:48:13] different ones that's been in school
[1:48:15] you could sit there and i could you
[1:48:17] could tell sometimes when you had maybe
[1:48:18] a parent or somebody come in they had a
[1:48:20] bad experience in school
[1:48:22] yeah right when they had a bad
[1:48:23] experience in school they already
[1:48:25] started with
[1:48:26] with things within teachers
[1:48:29] and so because maybe they had a bad
[1:48:31] experience then there was not a value
[1:48:33] that they held within that of education
[1:48:36] and then you try to start talking about
[1:48:37] education or other things like that they
[1:48:39] don't have no value to it but why is
[1:48:41] that you can't say well you're wrong you
[1:48:43] should have no no no
[1:48:44] but what about the background
[1:48:47] that's right
[1:48:49] maybe they had something in school maybe
[1:48:50] there was a teacher that abused them
[1:48:52] maybe there was a teacher that said
[1:48:53] something about them that you're dumb
[1:48:55] you'll never make anything
[1:48:58] come on brother graham talked about a
[1:49:00] young lady who had her glasses glasses
[1:49:02] smashed on the desk and as a older woman
[1:49:04] was still dealing with nervousness from
[1:49:07] that moment
[1:49:09] tell me that things back in life don't
[1:49:11] have an effect
[1:49:15] but i'm so glad
[1:49:17] that there's a great physician
[1:49:19] who's able to go down and deal with
[1:49:22] wounds in our life
[1:49:25] all glory be to god not only can he deal
[1:49:28] with things in the flesh but he can go
[1:49:30] down in the spirit where we've been
[1:49:32] wounded so deep and the great ointment
[1:49:35] of the holy spirit gives applaud and
[1:49:38] there comes healing
[1:49:40] to that wound and then it becomes a scar
[1:49:43] and a scar is i once was wounded but
[1:49:47] i've been healed on my womb
[1:49:50] i'm no longer wounded
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:50:02] i read that i thought about this over
[1:50:03] and over brother braham tells the same
[1:50:04] story regarding rahab too
[1:50:07] rehab was turned out as a young girl
[1:50:12] natural desire to want to be loved
[1:50:15] natural desires but satan begin to slip
[1:50:19] right in and perversion doesn't come
[1:50:20] right out like that perversion slips in
[1:50:24] subtly
[1:50:28] you look at where the church is at right
[1:50:29] now i'm talking about the church world
[1:50:32] it did not get that way overnight that's
[1:50:34] right
[1:50:35] it came in
[1:50:36] suddenly
[1:50:38] innocently
[1:50:40] right in the end
[1:50:44] here is this young lady
[1:50:47] can i have just a few more moments
[1:50:49] i know i ask you for that a lot but i i
[1:50:52] don't want to just leave this part
[1:50:53] hanging i have to stop here
[1:50:55] but notice what he says
[1:50:57] god is a spirit
[1:50:59] and they that worship him
[1:51:02] must
[1:51:03] worship him
[1:51:05] in spirit
[1:51:07] and in truth not an option but they must
[1:51:11] and here's what she said the woman said
[1:51:12] unto him i know look at this you talking
[1:51:14] about a believer
[1:51:16] believer brother samuel that woman is a
[1:51:18] prostitute no no i ain't talking about
[1:51:20] what you see out here i'm talking about
[1:51:22] what's down there
[1:51:25] i know who's the i know that seed down
[1:51:27] on the inside
[1:51:29] not yet quicken but it's speaking out i
[1:51:31] know
[1:51:32] that messiah's cometh which is called
[1:51:35] christ and when he
[1:51:37] is come he will tell us
[1:51:40] all things
[1:51:42] and jesus said to her i'm to speak unto
[1:51:45] thee
[1:51:48] that's all it took
[1:51:49] i'm here amen the one that you've been
[1:51:52] looking for the one to satisfy the
[1:51:55] thirst i'm he
[1:52:00] she was always
[1:52:02] always
[1:52:03] a believer
[1:52:05] she was always a daughter of god
[1:52:09] but she could never be recognized
[1:52:13] as a believer or a daughter of god and
[1:52:15] she knew it
[1:52:17] condemnation
[1:52:19] was over her life
[1:52:21] but there was a thirst hallelujah for
[1:52:24] the living god
[1:52:27] she had tried to satisfy that thirst
[1:52:30] with so many things
[1:52:32] it was a shame it never satisfied amen
[1:52:36] she went to this let's bring it on down
[1:52:38] she went to this sport to this sport she
[1:52:41] took up this activity she took up and
[1:52:43] nothing wrong
[1:52:45] nothing wrong with things that you could
[1:52:46] look at like that that pleasurable that
[1:52:48] are not sin but it'll never
[1:52:51] ever
[1:52:52] satisfy right amen
[1:52:54] let me just say this to you
[1:52:58] woman
[1:52:59] for a man will never satisfy the godly
[1:53:02] desire that's right
[1:53:05] and for a woman a man
[1:53:07] will never satisfy
[1:53:09] the godly desire on the inside amen
[1:53:13] but there's one who can satisfy it
[1:53:16] and that one who's satisfied he'll lead
[1:53:18] you to the right one
[1:53:20] like brother brown talked to that one
[1:53:21] woman and when brother batmaster and she
[1:53:22] was down there doing certain things and
[1:53:24] brother brown said sister have you
[1:53:25] received the holy ghost yet
[1:53:27] and she said
[1:53:28] well i'm you know i'm i'm seeking after
[1:53:31] it but the brahman says you get the holy
[1:53:32] ghost first
[1:53:34] and then he will tell you
[1:53:37] who to marry amen
[1:53:39] oh friends i love that kind of
[1:53:40] confidence don't you
[1:53:42] i got confidence in that there might and
[1:53:43] there can be things sure within a
[1:53:45] person's life what about this and what
[1:53:46] about that but we are not resting
[1:53:49] ultimately on any of our feelings our
[1:53:51] thoughts any of our plans it all comes
[1:53:53] back to the absolute of the holy ghost
[1:53:56] in a believer's life
[1:53:57] that's our rock that we rest on
[1:54:00] sure we might be disappointed sometimes
[1:54:02] sure we go through tests and trials but
[1:54:05] we have an anchor
[1:54:07] a stabilizer that in every situation
[1:54:10] there's a god who has made himself known
[1:54:13] to us and we are held even when we feel
[1:54:15] like we're coming to pieces
[1:54:18] why
[1:54:19] because we are in the chosen place
[1:54:24] eating unleavened bread bread wonderful
[1:54:26] bread of the word but remember
[1:54:28] unleavened bread
[1:54:29] it's not soft bread
[1:54:32] it's like we need communion
[1:54:36] it has a roughness to it
[1:54:39] the word of god that we partake of is
[1:54:41] wonderful it's precious
[1:54:44] but with this word comes tests
[1:54:47] and trials
[1:54:50] same unleavened bread is also known as
[1:54:52] the bread
[1:54:54] of affliction
[1:54:56] it's the same bread
[1:54:58] that they were put out of egypt go in
[1:55:00] the middle of the night before their
[1:55:02] bread ever rose
[1:55:05] it was unleavened
[1:55:06] bread
[1:55:08] you go to eating on the word of god you
[1:55:10] find things that's in your life or you
[1:55:11] find this you remember you go to green
[1:55:14] with the word go to eating on the word
[1:55:16] of god i'll tell you what the word of
[1:55:17] god will do it'll start cleansing
[1:55:18] desires it'll start cleansing things
[1:55:20] right out in your life if you'll give
[1:55:22] yourself
[1:55:24] to him that's true
[1:55:29] i'm closing here
[1:55:32] i don't know where time goes
[1:55:35] if you all would see how many pages up
[1:55:36] here that i have up here you'd die
[1:55:37] probably
[1:55:38] and i don't ever expect we're going to
[1:55:40] get to all these pages at all i just
[1:55:44] brother joe i'm going to try to end
[1:55:45] right here
[1:55:45] [Laughter]
[1:55:50] the mighty god
[1:55:52] hey friends really what's what's what's
[1:55:53] what's greater not me not me it's not my
[1:55:56] message what's greater than the word of
[1:55:57] god
[1:55:59] what is it that stabilizes us
[1:56:01] i understand our bodies my goodness
[1:56:02] we'll come to a time sometime that we
[1:56:04] won't ever have to say goodbye
[1:56:06] we'll never have to lay down and sleep
[1:56:08] we'll never have to tell somebody you
[1:56:09] know what
[1:56:10] i love fellowship but i can go to bed
[1:56:13] see you
[1:56:14] if you want a mirror i'll put them here
[1:56:15] you can talk to the mirror but i got to
[1:56:17] go i am tired
[1:56:19] but don't do that to me right now
[1:56:22] mighty god unveiled before us look at
[1:56:23] the priest
[1:56:26] when they seen him express his self
[1:56:28] exactly with the word and what he was
[1:56:31] they said it's beelzebub
[1:56:34] that showed
[1:56:36] where their nature
[1:56:39] was
[1:56:41] it was in the modern
[1:56:43] thought
[1:56:44] of the day
[1:56:46] you catch what brother brahma is saying
[1:56:49] when he the living word
[1:56:52] for that day
[1:56:54] was made known it showed where their
[1:56:58] nature
[1:56:59] was
[1:57:03] you see brother brother brahma is
[1:57:05] actually unfolding these things what the
[1:57:06] lord jesus said ye are of your
[1:57:09] father
[1:57:11] the devil
[1:57:12] and he's the father
[1:57:14] of lies
[1:57:16] he was actually telling them your birth
[1:57:18] is a product of a lie
[1:57:21] without coming into the truth it's a lie
[1:57:27] but when the little prostitute oh i like
[1:57:29] this
[1:57:30] that he met at the gate and told her
[1:57:32] expressed his messiah sign
[1:57:34] by telling her what she'd done why she
[1:57:36] said sir i perceive you're a prophet we
[1:57:38] know the messiah when he comes he will
[1:57:39] tell us all these things she was
[1:57:41] recognizing him
[1:57:44] as the messiah
[1:57:45] the anointed one
[1:57:47] because he met
[1:57:49] the scriptural
[1:57:51] qualifications
[1:57:53] but then says you see those two pieces
[1:57:55] that were coming together
[1:57:58] we know that when messiah's coming
[1:58:01] now god might have had to interbreed
[1:58:02] this one and that one to get this
[1:58:04] certain king of the bell like but the
[1:58:05] motor but when jesus turned and said i'm
[1:58:08] he that speaks with you
[1:58:10] there was no such expression as
[1:58:12] beelzebub
[1:58:13] she left
[1:58:15] her water pot
[1:58:18] you see what happened confession was
[1:58:20] first
[1:58:21] thou sent us truly lord
[1:58:25] and now once
[1:58:27] he's made himself known to her
[1:58:30] she just
[1:58:31] leaves
[1:58:33] her water pot
[1:58:35] she leaves all of the burden of sin that
[1:58:40] she's been carrying
[1:58:42] leaves it
[1:58:44] leaves it
[1:58:45] right and she ran into the city she said
[1:58:48] come see a man who told me the things
[1:58:49] that i've done isn't this the very
[1:58:50] messiah
[1:58:52] now what did this
[1:58:53] putting the old scripture
[1:58:55] with the experience that jesus was
[1:58:57] giving to her what did it do
[1:58:59] it made
[1:59:00] the messiah
[1:59:02] quickly her sins
[1:59:05] were forgiven amen
[1:59:07] because at the beginning now he's
[1:59:09] telling where her nature is
[1:59:12] right
[1:59:14] she was redeemable
[1:59:17] because she was in god's thinking
[1:59:20] at the beginning
[1:59:22] her nature was not in the modern thought
[1:59:24] of the day her nature
[1:59:26] that germ that seed that thought that
[1:59:29] was there she had a thirst
[1:59:33] she had a thirst
[1:59:36] she tried to satisfy with a lot of other
[1:59:38] things but there's only one that can
[1:59:40] satisfy that first
[1:59:44] she was redeemable it'd be like this
[1:59:46] handkerchief if i gave you this
[1:59:47] handkerchief this is mine
[1:59:50] is that right if i gave you this these
[1:59:52] pair of glasses i gave them to you and i
[1:59:54] said i need to borrow ten dollars
[1:59:56] you gave me 10 so i can maybe go get a
[1:59:58] hamburger maybe
[2:00:00] and then i come back to you later i'll
[2:00:01] say i need i want my glasses back you
[2:00:04] said a required price
[2:00:05] they're your glasses but it's going to
[2:00:07] require a price
[2:00:09] and so then the price that's laid is ten
[2:00:12] dollars you get your glasses you see
[2:00:14] what had to be it was life that they got
[2:00:17] away from so it would require life to
[2:00:20] come back and be offered up by the lord
[2:00:22] jesus christ and that makes a way so you
[2:00:25] and i can surrender our life to him and
[2:00:30] receive that true life
[2:00:34] redeemable at the beginning
[2:00:38] he redeemed her
[2:00:39] brought her back
[2:00:41] when she seen the express scripture
[2:00:44] manifested of jehovah
[2:00:46] what he was
[2:00:47] and what he is
[2:00:50] she was
[2:00:52] seeking for satisfaction
[2:00:59] a lot of she had a lot of many many
[2:01:01] thirsts
[2:01:02] in her life and she was seeking
[2:01:05] for each one of those
[2:01:08] satan had perverted a lot
[2:01:10] but she was unsatisfied
[2:01:13] now i want you to notice this
[2:01:16] she knew
[2:01:18] she knew
[2:01:20] i know messiah's coming
[2:01:23] can i just put it this way
[2:01:25] this young woman
[2:01:27] though a prostitute
[2:01:29] she knew about the prophet's message
[2:01:34] she knew those things and you think she
[2:01:36] knew those things but she was a
[2:01:38] prostitute
[2:01:41] remember
[2:01:42] the message out here will never do any
[2:01:44] good right
[2:01:45] it'll help it'll keep
[2:01:47] it'll lengthen days
[2:01:49] i mean it'll keep you from a lot of
[2:01:50] things keep you from a lot of things
[2:01:51] it's just heating to it out here but if
[2:01:53] you ever get it inside of here
[2:01:56] you ever get it down on the inside of
[2:01:58] here where it becomes the flame in your
[2:01:59] heart
[2:02:00] oh that's different
[2:02:03] that's different it's not you keeping it
[2:02:05] it's it keeping you
[2:02:07] it's god keeping his own word
[2:02:09] through your life
[2:02:11] oh sure there will be temptations that
[2:02:13] comes but the desire seated on the
[2:02:15] inside is to please him
[2:02:19] the desire
[2:02:20] is to serve him
[2:02:23] he is
[2:02:24] your life
[2:02:26] amen
[2:02:27] he's become
[2:02:28] now where you could say
[2:02:30] my thirst
[2:02:32] is satisfied
[2:02:35] my hunger is satisfied as david could
[2:02:37] say master the parents the heart
[2:02:39] pantheth after the water brooks so my
[2:02:41] soul pantheth after thee oh god amen
[2:02:45] david as he would speak of that thirst
[2:02:47] that was a thirst that was going on in
[2:02:48] david's soul
[2:02:51] brother brown tells us david had the
[2:02:52] word all around him but he wasn't able
[2:02:54] to live it he knew there was a place
[2:02:57] if i can just get to that place where i
[2:02:59] can live it
[2:03:01] oh my god
[2:03:03] to think about it
[2:03:04] that place is right here this morning
[2:03:07] it ain't just this building
[2:03:09] it's right here in jesus christ
[2:03:12] right here in the presence of god that
[2:03:14] come right up next to your heart and let
[2:03:15] you know
[2:03:17] i'm here to lead you
[2:03:19] i'm here to guide you what do i do yes
[2:03:21] lord even in our lives where god has
[2:03:24] brought us into a place of fellowship
[2:03:26] and union with him he's the only one
[2:03:28] that can satisfy
[2:03:30] our lives
[2:03:32] friends if you try if you try to satisfy
[2:03:34] you listen to me you might be on you
[2:03:36] might be alive and here you are you're
[2:03:38] dwelling there you could say brother
[2:03:39] samuel i know i love the lord and i i
[2:03:42] know i love the lord but maybe there's
[2:03:43] things within your life that you've
[2:03:45] allowed to accumulate
[2:03:47] and you've gotten cold
[2:03:49] there's a place
[2:03:51] what can i do
[2:03:53] say what he says
[2:03:54] say lord jesus all this has been
[2:03:56] accumulated in my life that's caused me
[2:03:58] to cool off
[2:04:00] you don't want to be a cold christian
[2:04:03] because you weren't made to be a cold
[2:04:04] christian you were meant to be on fire
[2:04:07] that'll mean to be walking around like
[2:04:09] you're an oddball and every time you
[2:04:10] walk in walmart you're quoting a
[2:04:11] scripture here and you walk in the
[2:04:12] target and you i didn't want to talk
[2:04:14] about it it's you are the scriptures
[2:04:16] you're living a life that when somebody
[2:04:18] runs into you you might be in the
[2:04:19] hardest trial and right here there might
[2:04:21] be a somberness on your face but there's
[2:04:23] a joy down in your soul that even though
[2:04:25] you don't know what's going to take
[2:04:27] place or how this is going to come out
[2:04:28] but i know that god is in control
[2:04:30] i know there's an anchor in my life that
[2:04:32] i pass from death unto life he is my
[2:04:36] satisfying
[2:04:37] portion
[2:04:38] amen
[2:04:41] oh glory
[2:04:43] let's pray
[2:04:46] father
[2:04:50] lord
[2:04:53] you know every need lord
[2:04:56] that's been gathered here this morning
[2:04:58] even those lord that on the internet
[2:05:00] those that would
[2:05:02] eventually stream this message lord
[2:05:07] but god
[2:05:09] my desire lord
[2:05:11] is the lord jesus
[2:05:15] knowing that what you've placed
[2:05:17] on our hearts this morning to speak
[2:05:21] that you would have a desire
[2:05:25] the lord
[2:05:27] i believe with all my heart
[2:05:30] that there's heart setting right here
[2:05:31] this morning
[2:05:35] the lord down within they know
[2:05:41] i need
[2:05:42] this thirst satisfied
[2:05:44] in my life
[2:05:47] maybe they've been around the message
[2:05:49] they they know what's true
[2:05:53] maybe they've lord been in and out of
[2:05:55] church
[2:05:57] lord i'm not condemning them for being
[2:05:59] in and out or living an up and down life
[2:06:01] i'm only trying to point them to a place
[2:06:03] this morning
[2:06:04] that there's a place that they can get
[2:06:05] to in you
[2:06:06] where it's no more in and out and up and
[2:06:08] down
[2:06:10] it's no more one day i've got victory
[2:06:12] and one day i don't
[2:06:14] there's a place in you lord
[2:06:19] may they lord i pray
[2:06:21] be that honest in your presence
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:25] that as that that woman
[2:06:27] when you begin to speak to her there was
[2:06:29] a thirst
[2:06:31] that she had
[2:06:34] it didn't matter there wasn't
[2:06:38] it wasn't men that could satisfy that
[2:06:40] thirst she was trying to find love
[2:06:45] but god no doubt as a young lady
[2:06:48] it was natural
[2:06:50] she wanted to be loved
[2:06:52] [Music]
[2:06:53] she wanted somebody
[2:06:56] that would love her
[2:06:58] but lord as she was turned down in the
[2:07:00] streets
[2:07:02] i think about it
[2:07:06] if i could go out on this lord and say
[2:07:07] it like this
[2:07:10] she never had a daddy
[2:07:12] that could take her out one-on-one
[2:07:15] and show her how a real man would
[2:07:16] conduct himself
[2:07:18] on a date
[2:07:20] with a young lady
[2:07:24] daddy was maybe too busy
[2:07:26] daddy had a lot of other things to take
[2:07:28] place in his life
[2:07:30] lord
[2:07:31] may i say this
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:34] we are all very busy
[2:07:37] there's things sometimes lord that i
[2:07:38] know i can speak on behalf of the
[2:07:40] congregation here there's times lord we
[2:07:42] feel like there's just not enough hours
[2:07:44] in the day
[2:07:45] we feel like my lord the pressures of
[2:07:48] work the pressures of life
[2:07:50] sometimes lord the things lord that even
[2:07:52] i know in myself if it's lord with me i
[2:07:54] know the same way with the people
[2:07:56] sometimes our best intentions of things
[2:07:58] that we have laid out for the week
[2:08:00] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[2:08:01] this and get to this and sometimes the
[2:08:03] schedule that we have laid out
[2:08:05] we don't even get to those things lord
[2:08:10] but there's sacrifices there's things
[2:08:11] that we have to make
[2:08:13] help us lord
[2:08:17] would anybody want to be
[2:08:18] honest before god and say lord
[2:08:21] i don't want to just make sacrifices but
[2:08:23] help me to make the right sacrifices
[2:08:26] because the only sacrifices that you'll
[2:08:27] receive is the sacrifices that's in the
[2:08:29] place where you've chose to place your
[2:08:31] name
[2:08:34] lord god as much as i want to spend time
[2:08:36] in the rest of lord my brothers and
[2:08:38] sisters maybe their children
[2:08:39] grandchildren so forth
[2:08:41] but never never
[2:08:44] should coming to the house of god be an
[2:08:45] option
[2:08:48] and say lord i'm spending time with them
[2:08:50] i'm doing this lord
[2:08:53] but oh god
[2:08:55] we realize lord jesus
[2:08:57] that even though you've commissioned us
[2:09:00] to do that
[2:09:02] but it'll never be received and become
[2:09:04] profitable
[2:09:07] if i was to do that lord i'm sure
[2:09:10] my boys
[2:09:11] they would grow up
[2:09:12] and they would come to this place going
[2:09:14] to the house of god is important
[2:09:16] but if there's something that comes up
[2:09:18] with family or something else that's
[2:09:19] more important than going to the house
[2:09:21] of god
[2:09:23] lord
[2:09:24] i and everyone else that's here we
[2:09:27] realize it's more
[2:09:28] we're not talking about just church
[2:09:30] attendance we're talking about really
[2:09:33] coming lord god and really being on fire
[2:09:35] really seeing the value
[2:09:39] not just the lord when we're here
[2:09:41] but seeing the value in our daily life
[2:09:46] oh god i'm so thankful how you bring
[2:09:48] these things down and apply them in such
[2:09:50] a
[2:09:51] real real tangible way
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:55] maybe if this young woman
[2:09:57] maybe her daddy would have would have
[2:09:58] showed her how a young man is to conduct
[2:10:00] himself
[2:10:02] he would have showed that love that part
[2:10:04] that was needed at that time
[2:10:07] so she would understand to walk in
[2:10:09] discretion not to give her heart away
[2:10:12] not to all these things
[2:10:15] lord might i say likewise
[2:10:18] we sometimes joke around and say mama's
[2:10:20] boy
[2:10:22] but how else is a young man to really
[2:10:24] know
[2:10:25] how a young lady
[2:10:27] ought to conduct themselves
[2:10:30] without having that time with mama
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:33] oh god
[2:10:35] thank you lord thank you lord
[2:10:39] help us father help us
[2:10:42] help us lord
[2:10:45] i realize lord jesus there's things that
[2:10:48] as i said right here
[2:10:49] [Music]
[2:10:52] we can go back down through lives and
[2:10:53] say i never had that or i never had this
[2:10:55] but god
[2:10:57] you're not here to point out
[2:10:59] failures this morning no
[2:11:02] you're here to call us you're here to
[2:11:03] admonish us those of us that have
[2:11:05] children those of us that have teenagers
[2:11:07] those of us that have that even with
[2:11:08] grandchildren as a grandfather
[2:11:12] can take that granddaughter out on a
[2:11:14] date
[2:11:17] show
[2:11:18] how a real father how a real man
[2:11:22] acts glory be to god
[2:11:27] thank you lord jesus
[2:11:31] help us lord i pray
[2:11:34] help us o god
[2:11:35] lord with the responsibilities that
[2:11:37] we've been entrusted with lord we need
[2:11:39] your help father
[2:11:42] but lord even in these things
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:46] if we could have read differently
[2:11:48] regarding this young lady
[2:11:52] if she didn't have upon her life
[2:11:55] the tag
[2:11:56] ill faint
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:11:59] or what we would know in this term
[2:12:01] prostitute and she did not even have
[2:12:02] that tag maybe
[2:12:04] in this scripture maybe we could read it
[2:12:07] like this
[2:12:08] she was the ideal
[2:12:12] message girl
[2:12:14] she had long hair
[2:12:16] she had the dress code down perfectly
[2:12:20] she knew exactly when to say amen
[2:12:23] she knew who the messenger was for the
[2:12:25] age
[2:12:26] she knew the promises that pertain to
[2:12:28] that age
[2:12:30] she could even explain serpent seed and
[2:12:32] many other doctrines knew of the seals
[2:12:37] but yet
[2:12:39] she was still thirsty
[2:12:43] because knowledge will never quench
[2:12:46] that thirst
[2:12:50] knowing truth will never quench that
[2:12:54] thirst
[2:12:56] is to know the person
[2:12:58] of eternal life
[2:13:01] lord
[2:13:02] your prophet tells us like this with the
[2:13:04] pharisees
[2:13:06] that they had lived such a life you
[2:13:08] could put no
[2:13:10] finger
[2:13:12] finger
[2:13:13] on their life
[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:17] but here was a woman
[2:13:19] that somebody could have put all kinds
[2:13:21] of fingers
[2:13:22] but yet down beneath all
[2:13:25] of that darkness
[2:13:27] there was a
[2:13:29] a thirst that
[2:13:32] man didn't put there
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:35] you put that thirst there
[2:13:38] oh god she had long to be loved she had
[2:13:40] long to be accepted
[2:13:44] that i tried lord to be satisfied in
[2:13:47] many times in many ways
[2:13:49] but lord god it had never been satisfied
[2:13:54] until that moment
[2:13:58] you came lord
[2:14:03] what she had been longing for
[2:14:07] that desire let me tell you something
[2:14:08] young person

[2:14:30] her life there were things desires that
[2:14:33] she had natural desires
[2:14:36] but the lord jesus came to deal with
[2:14:38] that desire that was down on the inside
[2:14:42] if he could only get that desire lined
[2:14:44] up and beginning to agree with the word
[2:14:46] of god
[2:14:48] hallelujah
[2:14:49] he'll release the transforming power of
[2:14:52] god and give her strength
[2:14:54] to lay aside those other things
[2:14:58] and be united with him
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:02] say brother samuel i want that life
[2:15:05] lord jesus i want that let me tell you

[2:31:32] there's only
[2:31:34] only one way
[2:31:38] to touch it
[2:31:53] you know i think about this little woman
[2:31:57] the situation that she was in
[2:31:59] the grace of god
[2:32:01] came to deal
[2:32:04] with the root of the problem
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:06] now i don't know what transpired after
[2:32:09] that part
[2:32:10] i i don't know we don't know
[2:32:12] brother joy lord willing we get there on
[2:32:14] the other side we'll know her name
[2:32:16] we'll get a chance we'll get a chance to
[2:32:18] meet her i don't know what transpired
[2:32:21] but i have a good i have a good
[2:32:22] indication that how
[2:32:25] when the prophet himself remember when
[2:32:26] brother branham would remember when
[2:32:28] brother brown was even one at the time
[2:32:30] and people kept pressing him about
[2:32:31] marriage and divorce how many remember
[2:32:33] reading that but they kept asking
[2:32:34] brother branham questions and questions
[2:32:36] and from 59 and asking him in 64 and
[2:32:39] brother brahma said i could give you the
[2:32:40] answer he said but i don't want to right
[2:32:42] now
[2:32:43] never forget
[2:32:45] many of you know brother hankins
[2:32:47] went on home to be with the lord
[2:32:49] brother hankins would tell the story of
[2:32:51] how it was
[2:32:52] at those meetings at parkview
[2:32:54] junior high school
[2:32:56] i was able to drive around that school
[2:32:58] there
[2:33:00] that place was trying to get a visual of
[2:33:01] it
[2:33:02] a couple of years ago or a year ago
[2:33:05] brother hankins said when people came
[2:33:06] into that meeting brother joe he said
[2:33:07] they came with suitcases packed
[2:33:11] husbands and wives brother dave i know
[2:33:14] you've heard this
[2:33:15] they came with suitcases packed ready
[2:33:18] to part ways if that's what
[2:33:21] would have been said
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:25] but the truth remember here's god's
[2:33:27] grace he said the problem has been
[2:33:31] of wrong
[2:33:32] teaching
[2:33:34] and when you go down and pick it up and
[2:33:36] all the way down through the message and
[2:33:38] things that brother brown deals with
[2:33:39] with marriage and divorce you realize
[2:33:40] that brother brown even of things that
[2:33:41] brother brown said back there in 1959
[2:33:43] brother bram never changed that at all
[2:33:45] never changed it
[2:33:47] never changed
[2:33:49] what came a greater understanding when
[2:33:51] you listen to the marriage message
[2:33:53] marriage and divorce
[2:33:54] it's more
[2:33:55] spiritual than it is natural
[2:33:58] it deals with the reality of how there
[2:34:01] had to come a death in our life
[2:34:04] not just a divorce
[2:34:06] but a death of that old nature
[2:34:09] in order for there to be that new nature
[2:34:11] the quickening power of god because god
[2:34:13] cannot marry anybody who still has a
[2:34:16] living husband
[2:34:17] that's invisible union the bride of
[2:34:19] christ right
[2:34:21] but god's grace would come down in that
[2:34:24] service
[2:34:26] remember the pillar of fire had come
[2:34:28] down on that on figure rock right out
[2:34:31] there
[2:34:32] in arizona right up and down that rock
[2:34:35] they dismissed the school children and
[2:34:37] said
[2:34:38] wow something's taken place up there
[2:34:41] right
[2:34:42] brother brown comes down from there
[2:34:44] and he stands there in marriage and
[2:34:45] divorce
[2:34:47] and at the end of that he says
[2:34:50] but god has given grace
[2:34:54] he said because you never knew this
[2:34:57] before
[2:34:59] but god has given grace and then he goes
[2:35:02] on to say
[2:35:04] but make sure you teach
[2:35:07] your children
[2:35:09] never
[2:35:10] to do these things
[2:35:12] that's a responsibility
[2:35:15] but what grace that came down
[2:35:18] friends what grace
[2:35:20] that come down for you and i
[2:35:22] we were united
[2:35:24] with the wrong nature that old nature
[2:35:27] nobody had to tell us how to how to
[2:35:29] start lying nobody things were pulled
[2:35:31] when all of a sudden we came to a
[2:35:33] certain age the music just started it
[2:35:34] drew it why that nature was aligned with
[2:35:37] that
[2:35:39] but there had to come not just a divorce
[2:35:44] but there had to come a death
[2:35:47] amen then when death comes then here
[2:35:49] comes the quickening power
[2:35:52] raises up in a new union
[2:35:56] with that seed on the inside that's the
[2:35:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:36:00] then you're a new creation what grace is
[2:36:02] given without the grace of god you or i
[2:36:04] wouldn't even have a chance
[2:36:09] i'm so glad for god's grace
[2:36:11] this might have been some things
[2:36:13] sometimes the first time that some had
[2:36:15] heard certain things said but i'm just
[2:36:17] here to tell you god's grace is
[2:36:19] sufficient
[2:36:21] said can i
[2:36:23] i'm almost i'm going to say this it come
[2:36:24] to me i said across the table from an
[2:36:26] individual they're not here they went on
[2:36:28] home to be with the lord
[2:36:31] time ago
[2:36:32] sit across the table at one time per
[2:36:34] person
[2:36:37] and they held that book
[2:36:39] trembling in their hands
[2:36:42] looked across the table and said i've
[2:36:44] been wrong
[2:36:45] i've been wrong
[2:36:47] i said i never i never seen this here
[2:36:49] before

[2:36:57] how i passed this up how did i bypass
[2:36:59] that
[2:37:00] how did i get around that
[2:37:02] but samuel what happened in that moment
[2:37:04] the grace of god came on the scene
[2:37:07] god didn't care that we were in a
[2:37:09] restaurant the grace of god came on the
[2:37:11] scene the desire to be right with god
[2:37:15] was permeating through that life you
[2:37:18] talking about grace
[2:37:20] that person walked away from that table
[2:37:22] that's morning
