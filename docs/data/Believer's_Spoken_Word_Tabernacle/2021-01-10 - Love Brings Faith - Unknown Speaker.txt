the word of god this morning amen how many is hungry how many is hungry hey man you want to feed on that word let's pull on the gift of god this morning amen amen wasn't that love how he left his home above thank you jesus amen that's why we love him he first loved us in the town of bethlehem bob came down to visit [Applause] [Music] he knew the pain and loneliness [Music] wasn't that loved [Music] [Applause] [Music] just to save someone like me every day i'm still amazed there's only one thing left wasn't that love wasn't that love [Music] he never said a word at all [Applause] knew that he came to die for me [Applause] [Music] [Music] jesus died on calvary just to save someone like me oh every day still amazed hallelujah only one thing left [Music] [Applause] [Music] he did just what he came to do wasn't that love the church wasn't that long oh but then he rose from the grave so that we could live today [Music] just to save someone like me every day i'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love [Applause] it wasn't bad [Music] [Applause] amen remember brian the young people brought this song to us i really love this song amen let's just sing the chorus amazing love how could it be that you my king would die for me amen could you ever understand a love like that hallelujah appreciate the lord let's try this song i'll start i'll start it out i guess hey man help me sing it if you know it i mean i mean a little lower little a little lower since [Music] which love how can it be that you my king would die for me amazing love i know it's true it's my joy it's my joy to honor you [Music] i'm forgiven because you were forsaken thank you jesus hallelujah i'm accepted cause you were [Music] amazing is how could it be that you my king would die [Music] amazing amazing love i know it's true it's my joy to honor you [Music] but if you wouldn't mind being seated again i really do i know you sometimes it might be harder for some joints to get up and down than other joints but i should have maybe communicated that to brother brian just they usually have you to stand up before i come up here or another minister and i just so appreciate that and we're just so thankful to to be in the house of the lord together and be thankful for what god has provided and seeing different ones and different faces and you know i tell you there's nothing like like coming together and seeing the body of jesus christ you know it's just something about it when you you see one another even when you may not even be in church but you just see one another and it's just something that just it just strikes you you know sometimes it like i said it not even on a church day or you're not even here it might just be out here in the parking lot or some other place a store or a restaurant or it just it's just something it's just like refreshing amen just to be able to see one another and i'm thankful that there's a there's a reality that burns in our heart that we're part of the family of god amen it's it's greater than than this of the earth and the tie of the earth has has lost its hold amen we might be held down here by gravity right now but we're no longer held by sin amen we've been delivered by the grace of god just something about it that just to be a part of the family of god amen as brother branham would put it so clearly and in the message and he would say that when we come together he said what it is it is the fellowship of the attributes of god you've never really seen me all you see is the expression of the attribute of the son of god on the inside and we come together and he said so actually what it is he said it's the attributes we fellowship in the spirit of god amen that's that's a precious precious place that we have been called to in heavenly places and um we just thank god for that i want to just mention to you i felt that we i needed to do this um on behalf on just some things that are taking place here in the local assembly and i i would say that uh perhaps that many of you have noticed that there's different changes that are taking place within the building um there's some changes that have actually happened months ago that you you wouldn't even be aware of i kind of alluded to it a little bit ago on the baptismal service a few weeks ago but you wouldn't have even been aware of those changes uh if i hadn't mentioned it but because it's behind closed doors right back in that closet back there there is the uh there was we had a water heater there and then we also had a tank that heated this baptistery up here uh in other words so that when we came time to baptize they could have that heater going and it would take the water cycle it from here pass it back there cycle it back up and all of that was going on and we inherited that with the building so we you know we used it and brothers worked on it brother carlos took it a few years ago and just took it apart and filed the burner down and everything's because if you don't know it this is cold sometimes when you go to get in there to baptize now i i can take it up here but i've got to put people down in that and sometimes this is all suspended up and you know how it is in a crawl space it's it's just suspended up a big cement uh part down there but at any rate we we we replaced that it wasn't something we had a choice of any longer that heater went out and so what was done uh we we put in one of those on demand it's a pretty large one a commercial size one is that right brother carlos is it is it regular one okay it fits our needs and it's so we we have been looking at that for some years and we went ahead and did that so that right from back there not only did we replace the water heater there we also were able to take and replace that baptismal tank those are two things that constantly going even when we weren't here and we took that and brother richard and brother carlos worked on that and they not only replaced that but then they fixed it so that all we have to do is we pull a lever back there and we can send warm water hot water in here and then when it gets close to the time for the baptismal service they can kick it back on again and more water comes out the side you might say how was it done in the past well aside from running to the well with buckets we had a hose sitting under the floor where brother tommy's at you pull the garden hose out fill it up and then we had a a heater tank in the back that that was what was here when we got here in this church and and the lord blessed us with the building in 1997 and so we are thankful that god has has worked it out that we were able to replace that and i thank god for the brothers you know we've we've never had to up to this point uh to to ask well i think one time we actually paid for some outside individuals to come in and do some of the drywall in the upstairs but other than that the brothers have have all done it and there's different brothers have different trades and different backgrounds and things and some of them just have the knowledge they just know what to do so we thank god for that because that certainly has saved the church a lot of money and yet if we had to get somebody you know i don't believe in cutting anybody i want to pay them because that that to me is a valuable skill if somebody can do drywall or lay flooring that to me is an art that's that's a gift and i that's how i've looked at it always even painting uh all of those things it just to me is a real gift and a real trade and so i want to say we we appreciate that you wouldn't even know about that if i hadn't we hadn't mentioned that but i wanted you to know about it because those are things that are taking place behind the scenes to make this uh this a little bit a little bit better some of the other changes that you've noticed is the lighting in the sanctuary and that lighting project this all came about because there was a need for more of ceiling fans to be placed in in order to really aid the air conditioning time during the summer months that was not something that the brothers came up with but it was what was recommended countless times through different heating and air conditioning men who came in and even when we had was it two years ago the the furnace and a new air conditioning unit put in for this part of the building three years ago soon before we had a new furnace and an air conditioning unit put for the back of the building and how many appreciate that air conditioning in the back of the building well i'll tell you i do when i'm in my office you know but i i really you know even in the latter parts i told the brothers don't even put one in my window and just make sure the nursery's taken care of so that they're comfortable in there with the babies and but i'm thankful that we are able to do that because it benefits uh it benefits here the building and benefits everyone but the lighting that all came about because there had there was a uh redoing of these um ceiling fans and trying to make these the air uh circulate a little bit better especially during the warmer months and we i tell you with the lighting let me just tell you how the lighting came about brother carlos's son victor god's dealing with him amen i can tell you that but he victor came victor even back there all those cam lights i'd have never asked anybody to put can lights in back there but he came and he said you all need cam lights back there and he said that's what we're going to do then when he came in here he got to looking at this everything and he said this is what we need to do he came in he measured this out then he came back over measured it again and i happened to come in the one day and everything was he took it personal he took it in a manner that this he wanted this to be done in a way that that was very very good and so even to where the blades would not hinder with the with the lights and things and i i just um i was just looking at that and you know victor started in with it uh and brother richard and brother carlos were here and you didn't see it i think didn't it start on on thanksgiving week wasn't that the first week that's when all these different holes were were were up here you know and so that all started you come i come in here and these and these brothers i walked in the one day and they're i got pictures of them they're up here on these on these platforms super high you know you walk in and they're taking a router and they had a template made out and a gentleman allowed us to borrow the the um the router and they're up there and i'll tell you they were a mess they were they were a mess and brother richard and brother carlos and and victor victor did a lot of these holes here and appear this part up here on the platform brother richard and brother carlos they uh they they just took over on that and started working on that completing and it's been one of those things we've just had to look at and go along and the part with the lighting you know sometimes i know sometimes we can look at it and say well why did you need to improve the lighting well let me ask you something do you get new furniture at your house i mean these are things that you buy maybe like you they see a new chair well this is the house of god you see there's a lot of things that can actually show what we what we think right now when we look here in this house we this is something we understand it's not about the brick and mortar but we we want to make it look nice we want to make it comfortable not extravagant but everything that's been done i can tell you from the lights and the things that's been done even from what we talked about earlier with that water heater and then even replacing the furnace everything that has been done it's been done with this thought let's make it more efficient so even when so that the the operating cost that those would start to go down so it becomes more efficient let's make it in that way and i think god that god has has allowed us to be able to to do those things and so we i tell you how many appreciate the the the lights i tell you i really appreciate that now for those of you that don't know it and and i never complained about it but this whole area you couldn't read a bible up here i don't know how the song leaders read read the prayer requests see i i preach with my ipad so i've got the light i can increase it's got its backlit so if you if you notice remember when brother john lafontaine was here the past few times when he preached and they had to bring that light from over there and put it here the reality is is that you couldn't you definitely couldn't read your bible because your bible's not really white white paper and there was a time up here that i i had i read this i read a scripture i didn't have it in my notes and i had to step out here and try to find a place where light was coming out so i could try to read the bible now like i said i had an ipad but brother john lafontaine remember what he said when he was here he said the trustees you need to get together he said we need to get these this is the and it was this was the darkest spot in this whole uh place we had a gentleman that we didn't ask him to come in didn't even know anything about him but he was here in one of the meetings and that brother does these things for a living and he said brother samuel can i speak to you a moment and he said the darkest spot in your building is your pulpit particularly your podium area and so you know what we've tried to do with the lighting is try to do everything that we can to make it a better um better and then also better quality for for video and streaming the archives and and all those things right there because we know that eventually the lord willing we'd like to replace the cameras and bring those things a little bit more you know up to date and i know some of you said hey brother samuel can you get rid of that bar on the side of the screen well brother bran brought my brother branham i feel like i'm getting ready to preach but brother brian brother brian put that bar in there because if brother brian didn't put that bar in there all it is is a four by three it's a standard screen you'd have black on either side so he just put that in there move that over so if you move that bar you don't see nothing but you know to the thing is we we knew that you you get a better camera but all the better cram the camera is going to do as many of the professionals and different ones have said it just shows up your your need for better lighting so we we recognize that something that is that is that is coming and and the light it seemed to be more a little bit more uh concentrated and so uh now with all these things changes and different changes in the past that has taken place like all of that back there that was done in the back of the church right there all of that was done all of that there was not one time even a special offering that was lifted for all of that in the back of the church and sometimes i realize that we we might look at and say well things are just happening but you know just to encourage you that um we're there there's not a money tree around here so you don't shake it in money and money just you know falls off you know my my mom my dad used to tell me i'd say hey mom i'd like to have this she said well money don't grow on trees and so i i you know we've never lifted a special offering at any time and i i'll take you know when we look at that i think there's times that we we should do that and perhaps we should have done that to allow you to be part of be a part of that a little bit more though you are a part of it and that the reason that we were able to do that and to do some of these other things to start on is because of the giving and it was beyond what the expenses were so what was done that money was just would be set there and then when needs arise because sometimes things like that water heater arose and it wasn't planned it was an emergency and thankfully we were able to take care of that without having to go into the building from the savings and god's blessed us there we we don't want we didn't want to have to go in there and pull from that so when i i'm saying that are you still with me okay i'm getting to some real important points now you know um and with that in mind i i'd really what i'd like to do is to encourage you to continue to support the work of the lord as you did prior even to the beginning of march now there is there are many many that you know what there's not been any wavering even during the times of the month of march we went into the we had to start streaming a little bit a different one you know as you just took up and you kept on sending you kept on supporting because the work kept on going on and you kept on supporting with your tithes and offerings and sending that and and the bills were being paid and all of that and we thank god for that and i'm not in any way saying this to you because we're in a crunch we're not in a crunch but i just want to encourage you because before when we would pass around the offering baskets and take up ties and offerings many times we would there would be in there cash that would also come in because people would just want to put a little bit more in well that really hasn't been taken place but you know those of you i know you send in things through the bank you'll send it it goes right into a lock box that's worked out really good but there's also a little red box back there and that box if you something you know you want to put a little more in or that's some of you put your ties and offerings back in and we've had to do that during this time when everything's going on i want to encourage you to do that and encourage you to really to you know as even though there's been changes within that but you know i i want to bring it to your attention that within this right here that we i know you're unable to respond to something a need if you're not aware of it and so i want you to understand that when these things that are taking place there's sometimes when you begin to see that or even i'm encouraging you don't pull back on your giving if anything at all say god what more could i do because an offering is something that you to pray about let me just say this to you very clearly this this church is not my church this is not my church this is your church this is where you have a responsibility i have responsibility and we've taken that responsibility but i just want to encourage you within this that in a blessing if you haven't been supporting in the tithes and offerings and that goes even for those that are streaming by way of the internet if you haven't been i want to encourage you in the blessing of god where god said prove me that's one of the first promises that god ever said prove me is that right in the book of malachi prove me said and see if i will not pour out a blessing now this isn't about pride this isn't prosperity gospel this is the this is the word of god but we want to encourage you because it's important to be a part of what god is doing it's important to be a part you realize that brother branham would lay it out so clearly you don't if you're not supporting entities and offering you don't even have a vote in the church on what goes in because you're not it's not really being a part of it but we want to be a part of those things we want to be invested in what god is doing we want to be a part of it that whatever part that you can do is god lays it on your heart you know the tithes and offerings and i'm not here to preach on that this morning perhaps sometimes we'll do some teaching on it but you know there's a difference between times and offerings the tithes that's you know that's the tenth of the first fruits of of of your of your harvest and that's that's what's given to god but the times does not go to putting in lights and everything else in the church that's the offering that's the general expenses the offering goes to that to bringing those things about and and all of those things taking place and so when we when we see that god god just i believe his desire is that our attention just to say lord let us pray over these things let us be mindful of it we don't want to become even if you're not here you know sometimes if you're not here for a week or two or three or a month or something comes up expenses keep on going on and i want to encourage you just to just to remain and faith and stay faithful and if you haven't come into that place i want to encourage you because that's part of being a christian that's part of being a real christian that's part of the blessings of almighty god now when i talk about blessings it don't mean that you you know you're going to give you know in your times and your offerings because and then you walk outside and there's a cadillac we're not from texas with smiley teeth you understand but what it is i've witnessed this in my own life and i know i can different ones could say this where where where god has made a way when it didn't seem like there was any way and it might be something later on down the line god will open up a pathway he'll open up a way how many witnesses i got in here gotta just open up a way and see what what is that that's jehovah jireh it's him providing for himself and that's where our faith that's where we we rest within that and i want to i want to just encourage you because the offering that's you know the offering that's a part that it comes from it's from your heart it's what you pray over it's a free will offering and you just pray you think about it like this this is how you evaluate it when perhaps maybe within the next month or so the trustee brothers they'll start you know showing you the different expenses and we do that just so that you're mindful of that but to think about it what if you didn't pay your water bill what if you didn't pay your gas bill what if you just said i'll just wait on so and so to do it but when you can look at it and say this is my part in this this is what i'm going to do this is if you take it personal you you're not taking it for granted you take it personal that you know what this is my church i'm a part of this work here and that's that is the that is the absolute truth this is the work of the lord and we are privileged to be a part of it let us let us let us get behind everything with all that's within us and what i mean that that you when i say all this within us i truly mean that from all that is within our hearts that you know that god we would just be able to further not only meeting and meeting the different bills at different times but also when there is things that comes up whether it's an emergency or other improvements like if the lord tarries we'd like to be able for the body to improve the things that are back there with the computer and and it's not just improving there are things right now that some of it right now it's running by a thread and there are things that some need to be improved and so i can tell you that we we want to we want to be in prayer about that and we we will not only as you continue to and give really pray about that but when there's time maybe for special offerings we'll be committed to that to bring that to your attention because there's times that we might have to pray and say you know what let's set a little bit more back for what for what's taking place and so we want to be able to do that and i've i've not come i these are things that i'll just be honest with you i get very uncomfortable in talking about you know why because i myself i don't care about money i don't i don't like my i don't for my own self i don't even like being tangled up with things that i have to think about it i'd rather not have and not think about it that's me i'd rather not have and not think about it and but that's just how that you know for me and how that operating i know no doubt there's many of you or if not all of you operate the same way and so these are things that we just we just want i want to encourage you as your pastor let's really look deep in these things let's really think about let's pray over it and say god i want to be a part fully and if you haven't been part fully i want to encourage you to be a part fully and just to really make that commitment there is that okay man now i've got to preach after this but i i don't i don't believe this was negative at all this is the word of god and these are things sometimes that we call i don't want to say house cleaning but it's things that sometimes that we need to we need to speak about we need to mention about and so i just want to uh just thank you for for your time we want to just look to the word of the lord here this morning and if you wouldn't mind standing with me once again now i know i've taken some time and i know that time will anytime i stand here i know a lot of times that time gets counted against me so i'll try to be mindful of that here this morning amen ephesians chapter 3 is where i'd like to go if we could i'm just going to read just a portion of scripture here this morning and maybe as we turn there we couldn't just maybe bow our heads in just a word of prayer and whatever your need might be just just know that god is mindful he's mindful of your need heavenly father lord it's so true that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we thank you dear god for indeed you are still jehovah jireh you're our provider lord and dear god we thank you father that lord that how you provided for us lord as a little assembly lord we're not a big assembly but god we're thankful that lord that you've provided for us most importantly lord we're thankful god that you have provided of your own life lord you provided away your god that we could come lord into a real union with you lord oh god it's lord these reasons lord as even we stand here this morning and are gathered together lord o god under this roof that you provided for us lord that there's a purpose lord that souls and lives might be reached for the kingdom of almighty god lord i just pray that you'll just come now in a very personal way and speak to our hearts oh god help me lord the man part help me to get out of the way that you can just come on the scene oh god and just speak to our hearts in a very personal and very special way lord you know every need and every heart that's gathered here and we just dear god ask that you would just come and meet every need you're the only one that can meet those needs lord so may you just help us just to step aside oh god and may you just speak personally to our hearts this morning we pray we love you and we thank you lord and we ask it for the glory of god in jesus name amen in ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 the bible says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god amen may god bless you as you're being seated i want to read to you hold here out of the message desperation brother branham in beginning of that message he asked the people to put down galatians 5 and 6. and it's the portion as he relates there that faith worketh by love faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is love's incentive it's an incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love if you don't have love you can't have faith so i want to in looking at these the scriptures here we have been dealing with or looking at the thought operating by the faith of this hour and we recognize that that faith that we're talking about is that same faith that was once delivered to the same it's the same faith that moved into early church it's the same faith that is moved down through the ages that faith is the faith of the son of god it's god's own life it is the love of god that moves into a heart into a life where you and i as we've looked at and just spoke just at different moments that indeed in our own life there is a faith that resides but when the faith of god begins to move down and begins to deal with our life and then it it drops into our life then it pushes our faith out onto the battlefront but we're not we're not without backing or authority or an absolute in other words our faith is not venturing without authority but our faith is backed up by our big brother the faith of the son of god so we've got an absolute we've got that which we can step out on the battlefront you know our faith love will push it out there because the faith of the son of god has moved down within our life and god's faith is not a dormant faith the faith of god is a living reality it's a person it's the person of jesus christ it's the same god who thought his word spoke his word and then came and became what he thought and spoke he expressed it that is that is all uh the great paradox of god's working and the faith of god and this is where paul as he's writing here in the book of ephesians and is the first part of that chapter that we read paul is declaring to the ephesians as well as to the gentiles that god has revealed himself to me the mystery that is to be preached among the gentiles which that mystery would be christ in you the hope of glory in other words you and i were not even aware of the covenants we were not aware of the promises but god had all of this reserved within himself it was a hidden mystery that was reserved there where god would come after there was a putting away by the jews where they rejected the messiah but all of that was in the plan and program of god because god himself was going to take a gentile bride and as we were looking at that last week it's not just god coming down and selecting people right now but god is omniscient god already knew the end from the beginning as an elect child of god we come from the very loins of almighty god and this is where now god he comes down by his word no other way that god has of redeeming than by his word and god came down he became one of us he paid the price he shed the blood which the blood was the payment or the ransom that was required in order that you and i might come back into an expression of the son and daughter of god because as long as there was a debt that was hanging over our head there's no way that god could call us to him and say it come be my son or come be my daughter although we already were sons and daughters of god you see what i'm getting at there had to be a way that was made in order to begin to call us in that way that we might come back into that expression now the spirit of god moved down through the ages it moved upon the prophets it moved upon abraham it moved upon the believers and they experienced that part of god that was allotted or given to them in that time but they never experienced the indwelling and abiding presence of the holy spirit that you and i have been privileged to be a partaker of when they fell in the beginning the prophet tells us in the message oneness that the image of god it left them so i just say it very clearly what adam had he was able to fall from but quite now for you when you have received the spirit of god it's impossible to fall away because the scripture would go on you see this is god's word all of this was hidden in the old testament it continues to come out in the new testament it was hidden in shadows and types of the security that there is in jesus christ paul would go on to call it a seal that's also an old testament word and to let you and i know the assurance the security that comes from the seal of the living god and that is where god has literally pressed his life into you to where now you're no longer known by your first birth but you are now known by your new birth that you are a new creation in christ jesus you you're the seal designates this is my personal property and the reality of that seal not only does it show coming and going but that seal it packs within it a transforming power you're no longer living by your own strength but now it is the very strength and dunamis of almighty god that is not coming upon you once in a while but now god has made his abode and his tabernacle his habitation inside of your life [Music] very precisely he came to claim that part that always belonged to him say it very clearly there's a part of you that's really him and that part of you that's really him is what he come to clay i'm talking about that seed we've been talking about that bedding ground that's the part that there has never been dirty traps on that seed because it wasn't alive before it was a seed but it was waiting for the time the season the inspiration that was needed in order to come and raise that seed to life who all can do that but our heavenly father who alone knew where we were at but our heavenly father he knew what age you'd be in he knew exactly where you would be at it was not a mystery to god but god was seeking you out and bringing you to himself it says why you can say i'm not my own work i'm not the work of a church i am his workmanship amen that paradox is a great precious reality that you can stand on when the doctor says i don't know what's coming next you've got solid ground to stand on hallelujah you've got an absolute an authority grounds that you know who you are very precious i say that's very precious it's very precious in this hour it becomes more precious hallelujah oh glory be to god faith so when we look at this i want to just speak a little a few moments here at least to try into this because i'm watching my time i want to speak on love brings faith these are some things that probably over a month ago i got ready to sit down on a saturday and finish and certain things and inspiration just dropped enough whole thought to come out and i didn't know that this was going to be today i didn't know when i would speak this but i just how god just began moving in my heart here even this week and moving different things and directions but i want to look at this about love it brings faith and i'm talking about the love of god it brings the faith of god because the love of god it is the faith of god brother brown would say it in many places like he goes on in the message desperation then you'll come in the message perfect faith and he'll speak love and he'll say it in this terms not you can't have faith without love and love and faith are kinfolks then they're related and so in the scripture first john 4 17 the bible said herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment notice this a love hearing is our love made perfect it's it's a powerful reality of how that god begins to deal with our heart we begin to fall in love with him it's all him working until it comes to a place that it is no longer just it's no longer just our love alone but god's love has completely moved behind it's entered in as paul could say in another place the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts it's where the love of god that passes all understanding it's where now that love of god it's what masters circumstances it's what causes faith to step out and when i say faith to step out we're not talking about lucy goosey we're talking about the things that say you know i don't know exactly uh what to do maybe in this in this but this is what god's word says amen i'm gonna stand on his word this is what this is why brother babies say what's the greatest compliment that we can we can give god is to believe what he said simply because he said that's the greatest compliment what brings it about love brings that about it [Music] so even for you and me even to come to a place of serving god you can never serve god under fear god doesn't want you to come and serve him under fear there can be fear that strikes the heart as far as like hey i realize i'm undone i realize i'm unclothed i'm talking about your soul i'm unclothed i'm not under the blood and it strikes your heart where would you be where would you where would you i can't say spend eternity because hell there's an ending of time there is that right the bible says it was created but you see it goes deeper than then then when then we begin to look at those things and we begin to you know in in in a manner begin to look and say for that of the love of god here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness that's a confidence that's not an arrogancy but it's a it's a confidence you ever tried to do something without confidence you might as well just quit right i don't care if it's shooting the ball shooting a gun working and plumbing or whatever you're doing you do try to do something without confidence just just set it down we know that's true you see because why listen to me real godly confidence is real faith and that is where you are rested in other words you become a channel a surrendered branch of the vine and you're aware it's not me doing this it's him doing it and you become rested not in your ability but you're resting in the confidence of the love of god where christ is dwelling in your hearts by faith that's why you can say regardless of anything i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me hallelujah it's a confidence and that confidence that faith that we're talking about it does not cause you and i to go out and act on our own but it brings a rest in other words brother greg it brings an availability where we make ourselves available to god because look at this as he is so are we in this world as he is seated on the mercy seat but remember he came back in the form of the holy ghost in that body pilate looked at that body pilate looked at that life and said i find no fault in him he was a man subject to subject to the the temptations and things that were all around us in the likeness of sinful flesh but there was the life and the character that they could not put their finger on i find no fault in him you see he was to be the true passover sacrifice we're talking about there was no fault in this life or this character that not only threw him by the shedding of the blood the offering of that life would pay the ransom would pay the debt but it would make a way that that same life now comes back upon the worshiper and you are no longer recognized by your first birth you now are recognized by your new birth by the spirit of god frankly put when god looks at you he sees himself because it's his life that has bred back or raised up a son or daughter of god you are i have memories of the past but remember those memories of the past was not that of that seed on the inside that seed did not do any of those things but that seed has been raised up by the power of almighty god so as he is we are in this world see it's a perfection of his life it's not us trying to oh i got to bring myself into perfection stop you you can't do that right that's not what god wants you to do anyhow you're only fighting and struggling against him he don't want you to do that well i can't lay this down i can't do that he's not wanting you to do it on your own accord he's desiring that you would allow his love and fall in love with him to the very hold of it passes out of your life that's a work of almighty god i mean think of it i know some people think well we believe in arranged marriages the only arranged marriage i believe in is that which come from the mind of god i don't marry no i don't well i'm saying married cause i'm already married but you understand what i'm saying i don't want to marry nobody that where everything's arranged now if i'm speaking against anybody's culture or customer or whatever more you forgive me but you understand what i'm saying it's kind of hard if you don't love somebody but the whole purpose and the whole framework and groundwork that leads even into courtship into engagement and into a union it's got to be based on love sure it starts with an attraction but then you realize hey it's much deeper than just the attraction brother there's a character of a person behind that that you fall in love with [Applause] and then when you hear that uniting has come between us and christ remember it is god as a matter of fact brother battle we just had a dedication of a uh of little isaac here last week a little baby and brother i'm standing there and standing in the gap all right no no in the message look he says to think of it that when you've been born again of the spirit of god because everybody knows a baby's innocent right but when you've been born again of the spirit of god you're more innocent than a baby that's what the new birth brings it brings innocency innocency that's what the real justification of god is all about mom preaching all ahead and honor amen i want to be i want to lay this in as well this is where it comes there's no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear hallelujah because fear hath torment and you know what i'm talking about i'm talking about even even after you've passed beyond from death unto life there's things that can come up and if you listen to it or they're saying this at work right now right they're saying this about the economy right now they're saying this about this right now they're saying this about a new strain right now they're saying if you let it it'll take you over you go from like peter walking on the water you start looking at the waves and you start sinking all right that's right i'm talking to i'm talking to any of us now are you with me this is where then perfect love and it comes back into that place we have a confidence to say wait a minute god's word didn't change i respect science respect all those things but that ain't my god i am not going to bow down and worship it are you with me we're not being arrogant but this is god's word as a believer with rugged faith there is no compromising on the word of god brother this goes deeper than ability to quote ability to put this together i'm talking about a life i'm going to preach now judas had a ministry that was second to none he never even got questioned has been the betrayer but let me tell you something you look there were lives like simeon you read of simeon's life you read of anna's life you read of those down through the old testament brother they were not in the book of who's who matter of fact they weren't even who's who among the religious of that day they were thought to be nuts outcasts you know why they had direct contact with god it was a living faith that they themselves were like the salmons going upstream back to the birthing grounds they went upstream through all the tommy rock and all the trash and all the current of the day why there was a force behind them i'm trying to get somewhere now oh my you see this is where this is where perfect love it cast out fear i wish i could just preach more on that verse 19 we love him because he first loved us glory be to god we're rooted and grounded in love that that whole phrase rooted and grounded it means you're established amen amen you're growing in his love yeah it's a building up there's a rootedness there's a ground you know you can tell when you plant plants you can tell when they're rooted or not it's like when we you know you plant shrubbery or you plant other plants or whatever more forgive me if you you just need to ask god to give me different examples but you understand these things sometimes when they plant them trees and things like that when they're planted a lot of times during that first year sometimes the first couple years not only are they staked they've been planted they're staked because the wind direction of the wind and you've got to water them right why why don't you have to water them until they're established even sometimes certain bushels hydrangeas and on and on you've got to water them why are you doing that because their roots haven't got deep enough to where they actually can find that water that's well beneath the surface this is where when a life becomes rooted and grounded in jesus christ and look there's a growing going on in our life this is why you in your life you look back you can look back and say god through all the tests and the trials and everything in my life even the windstorms that had your tree going like this but you know why i think god you could go like this because every time you're moving like this what's happening the roots are being loosened beneath the trial so you can go deeper in jesus christ so the trials are not a curse the trials are a blessing as peter said they're more precious than gold tried in the fire glory be to god rooted and grounded in love to where it's all based on a love affair between you and god amen what does that create it creates faith i've read this scripture to you and who knows how long how many times i'll keep reading it to you as long as he keeps putting it in here but i like it i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me notice he notice what happened here the faith of the son of god that paul is now living by this is a living faith but notice how did this come about it's because that which was made known to paul has the spirit of god dealing with his life that he loved him that god himself had come down become one of them god had taken on the form of his word and he had expressed his love no wonder paul could write in the book of romans in colossians john could write about it first john 2 john 3 john in this was the man of man was the love of god manifested toward us paul said while we were yet sinners he loved us he died for us he gave his life wow this was something that was so real to paul that in order for paul's life to be changed there had to be another life a greater life come that could actually release the bondage and the imprisonment that he was in oh glory be to god and you know the only thing that could really release that imprisonment would be very really the manifestation of the name of jesus christ because that is the word that is redemption that is god coming to fulfill his word and when that word was made manifest to paul brother he he let loose of what he was tied to he had been tied to that pharisee post he matter of fact paul was resting on his natural birth i'm of the stock of benjamin i'm of this talk of me i'm a pharisee of the pharisee paul he knew so much there was so much knowledge he had but in the presence of almighty god he became like every one of us that had been born of the spirit of god we go from a know-it-all to a know nothing in a matter of nanoseconds it comes to a place to say god everything that i thought i knew and everything that i thought about the new birth everything that i thought were about you it changes in a matter of moments when he he makes this statement because we're we're dealing with faith and brother brandon would make this statement and he would say faith is based on forgiveness now he he he's bringing it from the book of mark where if you say to this mountain and you recognize that is the is an hour where the sons of god were living in a time where the sons of god coming to manifestation we're living in that hour the earth is groaning and travailing this is why the bible says earthquakes in diverse places the earth let me just say it right now the world is not the earth and the earth is not the world the world is the system of governance or administration that's upon the earth right now but god himself is come to in order to release that hold of the world upon the earth because the earth is a redeemable attribute of almighty god is that right the same way that he redeems the earth is the same way he redeems you and i yeah he started this redemption of the earth through noah's message right god saw the wickedness of man where their thoughts and everything else was filled with all with evil and wickedness and everything else and god sent a message that would lead this earth to a place of repentance i'm talking about the earth it would lead it to a place of repentance and god would baptize this earth under that message under the revealing of that word in that hour then we know it came to that of calvary and the shedding of the blood whereby the blood would drop upon the earth and then claim it and make it known that this is my redeemable attribute it's always belonged to me and even now after the blood has been shed god is working yet by his spirit and he will move through even in the time in the millennium when it will set forth in a further in a further portion of sanctification where the bible says the knowledge of the lord shall fill the earth land sea and sky and it makes ready there for the actual event after the millennium and after that there of the white throne judgment on the battle of gog and magog it then makes ready then it comes be cut back up and now comes that city down to where now the earth itself is absolutely cleansed and the fire of god the city of god sets down in this earth what is that that's the same way that he redeems you and i am there but faith itself is based on forgiveness watch out brother says this in the beginning of perfect faith and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it such a flow that it'll be a help to us and us flow out to others i say amen now you realize brethren will go into this in the message of perfect faith let me just read this here to you to where as we're dealing with some of this he says i want to speak to you now upon faith a different type of faith a perfect faith that's a great thing faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you can't be saved without faith faith is something that you have to believe it's there and really nothing else will declare it's there but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line in the next few moments i want you to watch how brother branham is working with this here because not only is he trying to get the people in condition for the prayer line but he's trying but he's working that the people would focus on the right realities and the right foundation of faith and that if they're not ready they can be made ready now think of this he said i'm trying to prepare you for the prayer line that's going to be coming but you see we realize we're being prepared for more than just a prayer life now it's true if you've got a need in your life let me just say it very clearly you don't got to wait till the preaching is over to receive your need don't limit god i believe that the bible said they show their hands on the sick and they shall recover we believe that promise no question but the bible also says in the book of psalms he sent his word and he healed his people see it's not up to you and what i'm trying to say is don't try to put god in a box but just say god here i am i'm a believer this is your word lord and you know what if however that you would choose if it's at the end of service and god moves on your heart to be prayed for let me just tell you it is no less of faith to be prayed for we're interested in trying in being held maybe you need a little boost to your faith you know god's not ashamed to give you a boost god don't pull up you know with the jumper cables and say here i want you to come up here and my servant will pray for you man if you want so sorry if you want so weak in faith god's not interested in running you down because you might need a boost you might need a boost how many here has ever needed a boost in faith thank god that god will come by whether through the preaching of the word or while we're in prayer and god will give a boost as a matter of fact brother brown would say it like this when people are in need of a charge from god he said god may that theophany body of theirs come near where they're setting this morning and give them a fresh charge glory be to god hallelujah oh michael's heaven ain't somewhere way out there it's right here in a faster dimension faith notice he said he that cometh to god must believe that he is it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him if you say you believe god you have never seen him so then you've got to believe it by faith if you could see him listen to me now if you could see him it would be no more faith anything that the census declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's not no more faith so if we're living our life by facts it's not faith if you're living by facts you might want to check where them facts are coming from because a lot of times scientific facts have to re-fact-check and redo this and redo that so what are you saying i would not rest my ground i would not rest my life i would not stake it upon science that is the god of this evil age how many times the prophet of god would tell us even the things that was sweeping down even around in this earth in this world he would talk about different ones that were motivated by a communistic spirit he spoke of these things that was coming on what is the god of communism science education well you see because it's godless it's got to have something that would be somewhat worship or to make it feel good remember now even though it's a science it's not without emotion you take people that'll believe in this and they'll do this and i'm doing this and you're not and i'm better than you and you're not what is that that is religious emotional worship but nothing is to replace the divine worship of in spirit and in truth and his sons and daughters of god in this age as they withstood science and the oppressiveness down through every age and told the believers it's not possible it's not so but there were believers that had the backing of jehovah god they had that god who failed himself in the pillar fire was so real to them it pushed their faith out on the forefront even when they didn't know how things were going to turn out but like the hebrew children they said god will not fail oh glory i believe i'm speaking to someone i'm one of them i believe meshech said wreck and abednego i know that's their babylonian names but they had real real hebrew names one of these days you'll find out your real name you see we were called this and called that but one day the word came by our way and the word began to call our name hey mary was in the garden she thought he was a gardener after his resurrection but when he called her name she said raponi rabbonai when he called her name they were speaking but the difference was when he called her name amen she recognized this is my master oh my god anything that senses declares it's no more faith it's a scientific fact is that right i mean it's like the if the doctor tells you take this pill take that pill or do this sure we'll take this pill we'll take that pill or whatever but we're not basing it on that we take that pill take it with water or what juice whatever you want to take it with chocolate milk lord jesus i take this in the name of jesus christ the lord you're my healer all healing comes from god [Music] is that right amen so this is how we approach everything respect it yeah i mean it's just like you know telling us drive down the road i respect stop signs don't you yeah i appreciate what other people do too is that right appreciate all that but you know when we look at this it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god you must first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word you can't come to god outside of it being by the word just take the word what it says that's right everything else contrary to it is not right abraham had to believe just what the voice told him now watch how he goes here and when he was a hundred years old 25 years later he was stronger believing it than he was 25 years ago when it was given to him why he was growing [Music] he was growing he believed it and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing he was able to perform what he had promised and that's the way everyone must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith now watch this believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith notice what he says in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk on see to receive that faith all right now brother rabbit he goes on and continuing throughout the message he's dealing with because in our lives there's needs as we said throughout there's needs that come about in our life maybe you're praying about a job praying about family matters praying on and on and on and on you need an answer from god you need a direction from god you need his will and you're you're waiting lord you know sometimes the will of god it can come right across the platform it come right where you're reading you're listening to a message prayer closet believe it or not while you're walking down target that's not excuse to go to target now it can happen because in anywhere listen to me even when i go different places i don't i don't break contact with him there many times i'm walking sometimes i'll just try to get out maybe with my wife but on and on as i'm going there's things that still is upon my heart by the joy there's things i'm studying things within that god i just just have here before me and it's right there and it's just what i'm meditating on now i know as a minister there's ways and and things like that that you know as i'm able to do that but but i believe that that's the same way it is for all of us or else god would have just restricted it and said now just for the ministry meditate on those things but it's not it's for every one of us now you know how it is when you're in the word and you're feeding on the word you're listening to the word and then when you you know you have to put pause or stop and you go to work or you go to your other places you realize you might have put stop there or pause or close it up put your book marker there but it didn't stop that's right because you know why you're a feeder you're a feeder and you're feeding on living word and that word is alive and there's things that as it's just moving you know and it's not even something necessarily that maybe that you're all together thinking about but it's right there and then all of a sudden there'll be something that'll just drop and things will connect and you'll have this what's going on you're a feeder on the word and the word is actually ministering to your life you're taking that in and god is ministering to your needs you see when god wants to make known his will for our lives there's things that we can pray over and i don't know about you but i would love in every situation for god to come down like he has at times for certain decisions in my life and would tell me just things that just you know is like an olive voice that would speak to me but it hasn't happened that way every time it hasn't always come about in that manner sometimes it's just been in a manner to where i'm praying and i'm praying and then all of a sudden there is a deep peace that sets in upon my life and that deep peace regarding that situation it's not something you know i've had people tell me before when i asked him have you prayed about this did you pray about this well yeah god never told me no that don't mean he told you yes are you with me i mean it's like trying to get daddy's attention you know zachary's sometimes trying to get my attention or this or that daddy that just because that i am into something at that time and i'm not able to respond to him it don't mean hey go ahead dad don't care about it that's not it at all you better make sure you got papa's approval so the one thing that sometimes that you and i it regards what we're praying we're waiting on god we're looking to god but as a believer we learn a lot of times we learn this by experience as we go on in life sometimes we've done things hastily sometimes we've done things presuming well i'm going to preach sometimes we've done this this ain't even in the notes but we're just going to preach it these are things sometimes we've went along with it and then you realize afterwards oh boy i shouldn't have made that decision but you see god's grace will allow you to come back to that place not just to say lord forgive me but it teaches you and i one thing that they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as an eagle it teaches you and i to be patient to look to the lord because god does not want us acting by our own ability that's not what faith is but faith itself is there when the peace of god has dropped down in your heart you cannot even explain where others would say what in the world are you doing but you see when faith has dropped there is a peace that passes all understanding as a matter of fact there is a peace by the faith of almighty god that sees obstacles but it doesn't consider them it doesn't focus the mind's eye upon the obstacles it's so focused upon that of god his program and his word this is what faith does and you see so being brought in position there's needs in our life to come up even after even after we have come into position by the new birth we've come into a position because listen for translation faith for rapture you've got to be in position the rapture is for those who's in position in christ jesus position is not something we come to after we're born again position is where we are placed positionally by the holy ghost in the body of jesus christ so being in position is that where our life is grounded it is that where christ is dwelling in our hearts by faith it's where that in the scripture as it would say there is therefore now no more condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not according to the flesh but after the spirit it would also go on to say in the book of john if our heart condemn us we can't have confidence so you see what the work of the holy spirit does in bringing us in position as god would deal with our life and bring us in a place that we might have this perfect faith that then when situations arise we are in position as a channel to receive from god direction we must be free from condemnation now the greatest the greatest condemnation there is is that of the first birth there's got to be one who's able to lift us from that condemnation of our first birth it takes more than good morality good morality it's not lifting above condemnation there might be others that could look at you and say well they're a pretty good person but listen you can still be under condemnation you can take the finest man and the finest woman you may not even be able to put a finger on their life but yet if that life has not really truly been born again and come under the blood of the lord jesus christ it is under the judgment and the wrath and condemnation of almighty god but you see god's desire is to remove or leave or lead us out of that condemnation remember look in the scripture god never comes along and he gets down in the mess and the monk but what does he do he wants you and i to come out come out and be separate come out from under the condemnation come out you see his desire is to bring us out from where we are and bring us into him that's what redemption is all about it's bringing back into the rightful place and position what was lost so this position then it puts us in a place to where we're ready to go amen now i want you to think of this here do me have just just a few moments can i have just a few moments just to lay in a little bit of this because we're not even i'm just barely getting anywhere here but i want to just lay this in here this morning when we look at this here as brother brown was telling us here with the word of god is to take god's word and to believe it it's where god would begin to deal with our life because it takes love bringing faith in our life so it takes a real operation of almighty god this is where that in john 14 15 it says if ye love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father now notice this is before the holy ghost has been given if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you how many know that jesus is a high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities remember that a high priest himself when god would have the priest the priests were set aside to be able to offer up gifts on behalf of the people that was only a type that would speak of the very life of the lord jesus christ it would also have a part to do with us as priests of god that have come in by the new birth but he is the high priest he is the one that offered up the the ultimate sacrifice by the offering of his life that would absolutely pay the ransom for you and i once and for all and then he would come back now in the form of the holy ghost to fulfill that part of the word that was left unfulfilled or that part that he would come and he would fulfill in redemption in the gathering end of his very own attributes his sons and daughters of god and so remember now as he would come his word would go forth and notice what he said if you love me keep my commandments so who is it if peace with people only focus on commandments you're missing the real reality well i got to do this and i got to do this and i got to do that you're missing the real reality this is where that many steal they struggle with things well well i love god and i love this but you see you're you're separating they're missing the point if you love him that's what was first if you love me then keep my commandments so you begin what happens is there begins to be a love affair that begins to take place in that life and love begins to work upon that heart it's god that's moving in that time let me read this again brother adam will take us back to this scripture in john 14 17. look at this even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you in the message the comforter brother brethren words it like this he said notice even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive the world as long as you love the world you'll never receive it [Music] see the world the world is that that administration that which is governing that which is upon that life as long as you love the world you'll never receive it so you see in order to receive it god listen to me now god will not go over i think we're starting to look at some of this last week but notice when we look at it god will not go over our own free will god will not save us against our will he don't grab us by the arm and you know pulling that's not how god works that would be slavery that would be an operation of fear that's not how god works god does not desire that we would serve him out of fear i'm talking about slavish fear there's a difference between that fear that was spoken in first john 4 that fear that has torment that fear that's a slave is fear that if i don't do this if that's a slavish torment that is not what god intended when we talk about the fear of the lord the bible said the fear of the lord is clean the fear of the lord is reverencing him referencing his word notice this the world as long as you love the world you'll never receive it now in first john 2 14 look how the scripture with being was set forth i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one love not the world it's amazing how the word wrote love right here is agapa amazing in it love not the world but there's also a part that deals with this love right here that means to be content with are you with me love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away right aren't you glad it passed away for you amen hallelujah and though i and the world passeth away and the lust thereof so they're removing listen the removing of the world the administration the system if pat takes with it all of the unbelief or attributes of the world and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever it's amazing you know how god god will work and deal with the heart and deal with the life but if there's things that you know can continue on and the person says well you know this it ain't that bad i got this under control and i got this and i've been doing this you're letting me you're playing around with that you're actually content with the world this is where the scripture says love not the world in other words you don't make excuse for it what about samuel that's just my weakness that's an excuse there is no weakness in the atonement amen you see this is why we must be strengthened with might in the inner man there's got to be a change on the inside a positioning for perfect faith a positioning for faith to drop into a positioning for god to lead us and you see it's got to be ground because remember what real faith does what does love do it brings confidence it brings us in a place to be available but you see as long as there is these things right here a person is still bound in condemnation they can never a god can never operate it can never move the way it needs to move in their life because they're still content let me just tell you right now don't try to take care of things in your life but surrender it to god but when i say that surrender to god god ain't gonna pry it out of your hands he won't pry it right it's got to be surrendered it has to come to a place to a person no longer is content with the world no longer wanting it no longer where it becomes an acquaintance or a body but where there becomes a transformation notice how jesus would say this i'm just just just a little bit more here matthew 16 24 jesus said unto them if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul now think of this you know jesus would would write of it in this way remember when the disciples they were asking him we've we've left father mother house's lands and all this we we've done this what do we receive jesus goes on to let him know he said those that have followed me in the regeneration of the son of man he's talking about the new birth the regeneration shall receive life everlasting eternal shall set upon 12 thrones he's going into a place to show the positioning and those who will follow him now remember to follow somebody is where you let somebody lead you amen now you and i did not know this way we could not know this way remember the way into the holiest of holies was blocked off there was a veil right but that veil had to be opened but the veil that needed to be opened was not the veil that was in the literal temple the veil itself would be that of where god himself would come down in the veil of his own pitching that veil of his own body that then through the offering up of his life the bible would call it in isaiah 53 when he offered up his soul he offered up his life we say i think sometimes they sing the song here his life for mine sister mercy sings it his life for mine there was an exchange that was made amen what we received because he was willing to drink his bitter cup amen i think my brother tells us he said he wanted our fellowship so bad that one of his last request was father granted that where i am they may be there also [Applause] that's the desire of our father that was projected in the life of the lord jesus christ to pray on our behalf to encourage as a life as he begins to deal with that life life begins to change it begins to dissolve he begins to move in that life you see brother brown would say it like this and believe in god i don't have all the quotes down because some i just want to refer to but just just listen i know this is simple he says no man could heal anybody christ done that when he died i couldn't save nobody or no one else can save anybody but god and god can't save you because he's already done it the only thing you have to do is accept it it's already done he said i wasn't safe 20 years ago i was saved 1900 years ago 20 years ago i received it and accepted it if it hadn't the first sin i did god would have wiped me off the face of the earth because he said he would he's kept his promise i was healed 1900 years ago but i've got to accept it you see that's what the preaching of the gospel is all about that's what god sent the message in this hour was to bring our faith in a finished work of calvary [Applause] it was an announcement it's finished [Music] it's a trumpet that is blown that sounds liberty brother samuel what do i got to do accept it [Music] let me say this to you now contentness with the world will never allow you to accept it there's a reason why hearts can set in church or on and on just dial in with me here just a moment and the reason sometimes when you're praying for loved ones you're praying for different ones i want to see god move on their life of course we do and we know it has to be god to do it is that right you know that as a believer that your life is a paradox you know you didn't change your life and you can't explain it either but you know you've been changed but you're praying and you look and you say they're so close what's this they're they're sensitive thank god for all that keep praying but let me tell you what's going on the reason god can't move no further is because they're still content with the world when the love of the world is still there where it's still holding on you said well i think i thought that has to be god to take that out of the way but remember god just does not come and take something that you want to hold on to if you want to hold on to it that's contentness that's love but god wants that to be directed to him to where you lose sight of this and it's focusing on him you see what's happening then it's god and the only way this happens it's god working on that life god working on that's why i told you when you're praying for your children and you're praying for your loved ones just don't pray for them here and just don't pray god you bless them you say god get them to a place if you've got to bring them to a place the only way they can do is look up bring them to that place lord bring them to a place to where they know they really need you bring them to a place that they're sick and tired of this world you understand what i'm saying i'm not saying you know lord do this to me that's not what we're saying at all god knows how to he knew how to get my attention he knows how he knew how to get your attention he knows how to get the attention of each and every one let me just tell you something our experiences are not the same but we did have the same experience of passing from death unto life hallelujah by the same almighty god by a paradox of his omnipotent power [Music] that's why it's your testimony that's why my testimony is my testimony and your testimony is your testimony but you see it's in a place where we come to rotting out how do you how does a seed rot we got to put it in the ground right but even when it's in the ground you can put a seed right in the soil if there's not moisture in that soil it won't rot but you let moisture start getting around it all right i've dug a minimum as a science teacher and taught these things i had to do everything with them and not to break out into a shout and spell you dig that up and you show where where the flats that we had to plant underneath them lights you planted them you didn't water them they didn't grow but as soon as water came upon that soil you know what that soil did it held that water in and that hard stoney heart i mean that hard stony seed coat on that seed that he was setting in there and what happens that water it begins to rot it what's it doing it's loosening it up so the inside man can come out amen and that's why it takes the water of life that's why it takes the word of god being preached that's why it takes that original life that original word that original word water that original outpouring of the holy ghost to bring about a real rotting of the seeds to where the seeds get so miserable get so tired of the condition and the life they're in they then take their ambitions and the direction about why does the preacher preach this why is the preacher preaching this he now trains to say lord it's not about the preacher you're trying to change me lord i want to be changed help me to rot i don't know about you but when anything rocks it's a mess sometimes you take them seeds out of there that's the same way when god's working on our life we're falling in love with him it gets messy things start breaking down on our life but you know what it's a glorious thing it's a rotting way it's not anything where we're under you know the the hammer under you better this you better it's not that at all it's a love affair and a matter of fact you didn't even know it then you didn't even know what was going on you didn't even know why things started to turn in your life why you started to be open to some things it's god working my mind we gotta stop here somewhere you see what's happening god he's bringing you into a place of surrender a place of surrender that we can accept what he's already done for us brother brown would say it like this young people middle age old every one of you i want you to hear this brother tells us he says the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old was because a spirit hung over me a devil said to me wait a little longer a devil wait a little brother longer i didn't want no devil i i know none of us did but you see that first nature it was inclined that way it could be inspired that way it'd be kind of like in your phones you know some of you got att some of you got sprint some of you got verizon some of you got whatever you know how to do sometimes you gotta you when you buy your phone they ask you oh okay what what's your carrier you say my carrier is sprint or whatever it is and so you might be having an awesome deal on the phone but it's verizon i know you can get all this stuff reworked but don't don't don't don't get all me you understand if you if you're on verizon network and you buy an att setup phone phone you're in trouble you're not going to be getting the sigil signals like you need to get right but when you get that that that that phone if your plan is on a verizon plan you're going to want a phone that's got a verizon sim card because that's a sim card that when it's activated it's tapped into that network then it begins to receive within that network from the sending towers of verizon because that's the plan you're a part of you were a part of redemption plan [Music] there was a sim card in you before it was a sim card of the world [Applause] there was all sorts of pictures and things that come up and how things would look on you and everything else and you were moved by this post and moved by that and you posted this and you did this but one day god took a hold of your life and he yeah that there's a little itty-bitty thing right there he took it i didn't know when things existed like that he took it a little small little instrument and that little thing pops out on the side it's an itty bitty brother greg a little sim card it's got writing on it and you've got to tell if you've ever had to do it this way i had to do it this way if you ever had to do it this way you have to take it out and you got to tell the guy at verizon or whoever your carrier is read me off the numbers mr browning okay and you're looking brother joe it's hard even with my bifocals [Laughter] three seven z two now that ain't the one don't try to copy it down but brother richard i had to tell them that you know why if they don't know what's written on that card they can't activate it in that seed down on the inside of you your first sim card it could not receive nor would it ever become a son or daughter of god but that sim card that come from god i hope that's all right to say it that way that real seed that real representation that come from god brother when that right there it's being dealt with bringing to a place to where that is the one who gets activated that changes everything but before it can get activated it's got to get in the hands of the right person who knows how to deal with it and god knows how to deal with our life like brother brahm says that devil he said it hung over me wait wait a little longer wait a little because the first birth was inclined and it was sensitive to that but then god continued to deal with that life now let me just close with this that god commissioned his church to cast out devils a devil that can tell a person you're in this you're not a part of this you'll never understand this look at you but that devil what it is he's afraid you see the devil operates by fear [Music] because what he knows is all it takes is simple accepting what the word has said is letting go and say lord i stand upon your word and that it begins the horde begins to break over it begins to break loose the preaching of the gospel right while the gospel is being preached let me tell you something i've witnessed it not just here i've witnessed it in in the youth camps i've witnessed the devils and having people on the ground and casting out spirits among among young people and everything else let me just tell you something even when you or me or anybody else you come to the lord let me tell you what had to happen the gospel of jesus christ went forth and it cast off the devils because the devils are what we're telling you wait longer hold on this isn't for you look what you're going to have to give up look like what's he trying to do proposition the world but there's a greater reality taking place the love of god is pulling on that life what's happening god's casting out that devil might have been a drunken devil an immoral devil homosexual devil whatever that devil is he deals with that devil that unbelief that's in the light you might be as pure as a lily but unbelief is still ravaging through your heart there's a god who deals with that devil there's a god who meets that devil face to face in my name they shall cast out devils [Music] it's his word the authority of his life taking a hold of another life what is it it's not it's not out of fear it's a love affair let me just stop right here i want to just say this to you if you think i'm preaching if you think this right here is just for people who don't have the holy ghost let me let me dial you in a little bit right this is not just for people who don't have the holy ghost it's for those of us have already passed from death unto life it's that you can look at you're seeing the ground that you're standing on and if there is let me tell you something if there is condemnation in your life if there's something that's hindering make it right if it's something between you and somebody else or something make it right why so you can be in position to receive from god you see this is what this is where when abraham went up there to mount moriah brother braham said he walked up there and here was isaac one who had been raised from the dead he received him as one from the dead he believed he would likewise brother graham said and how about you and i we were once dead in sin and trespasses but now are we alive in christ jesus how are we heading into this rapture because we've been positioned in christ by the new birth love brings faith love cast out fear love what does it do as god brings his word it leads to a place of the rotting away of the desires in that life this is where it takes the mercy of god working this is why listen this is why we want an atmosphere right here in the church it isn't just something that's on me it's on every one of us this is why that even in our life of how that we live our life outside of church this is why that even as we come to the house of god coming to the house of god is just not about you when you come here well you know i just barely made it you're still living for yourself i hate to say it that way but sometimes you need your toes stepped on if you're just praise god everybody clap for me i just made it to church today shame on you it ought to been something you were looking forward to bro samuel you don't know what i've been through let me tell you something you can look all around this room there are different ones that could say the same thing they might be feeling lower than this rug down discouraged but there's something that's there that says god i am trusting in you something is going to come my way that's going to encourage me today there's something that's going to minister to my life brother when you come with that kind of an expectation you're making yourself available that the pillar of fire can move freely right here among us listen there's lives that need to be born again of all ages hearts that need to be changed lives we want an atmosphere of that of an atmosphere where the holy spirit is free to move truly the word creates an atmosphere but we want to be receptacles we want to be lives that the word can fall into we want to come here and say god it's like when you walk through those doors this is a place you know hey this is the maternity ward this is a place where babies are born this is a pla in that right in a hospital you know what floor is the floor where babies are born they got different kinds of furniture there the walls are painted a little different it's made of a place maybe seemingly to be more conducive to birth brother and sister it ain't the pews or the pads on the pews or even the lights but it's the atmosphere of almighty god that it creates the place that you know there's something here there's one here that's greater than the temple there's one that's greater [Music] love brings faith brings confidence brings strength it brings assurance that things that you would have to face or what you do have to face or what we faced or what we've went through it gives us confidence he said he'd never leave me nor forsake me i got to thinking about just praying even the other day and it's like god what we've been through here not just us i know the church has been through different things as well but even in the past year different loved ones that we've went on home to be with the lord then we had you know where the sickness and different things is we've had to you know move through that and navigate through this time never thought that we'd have to certain things we'd have to navigate through but i'm so thankful that our jehovah is faithful i'm so grateful for his faithfulness his leadership that he would give us peace and direction in this time we're not wondering we're not staggering we're not guessing we're not hoping we're not presuming we know where we're standing as the holy spirit has told us and spoke to us listen friends there are things that there's many of us there's things that you might be have a fear about you might have a fear about this or a fear about that but let me just tell you something right now we're not glorying in that at all but just to know that these are things and things that transpire around our life in our life or whatever is to know that there is a god who is still in control of every situation there's a god who is ever present that's able to say to you and i be not afraid it is i be not afraid a same god that would let you and i know rest in me trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding he's still god he's still faithful he answers prayer he still heals the sick he's still saved souls he's still cast out devils hallelujah he still feels with the holy ghost he's the same yesterday today and forever what should i do love him love him love him because he first loves you amen hallelujah lord be to god in the highest glory be the god in the highest love that brings of faith hallelujah glory be to god blessed be his name oh hallelujah let's pray dear jesus you are the same yesterday today you're the same god lord that moved in the beginning you're the same god lord when there was an adam stardust or molecule you're the same god lord who stepped back and dear god you blew off of your hand lord oh god as it were a creation lord and saying let there be you're the same god lord jesus that stood lord god here in the temple of your humanity you're the same god who came back in the form of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost you're the same god who came lord and god inside of your people lord you're the same god who changed their lives you're the same god who gave them strength and courage lord when they walked into the lion's den you're the same god lord who was with abraham lord and sarah and change their body you're the same god lord who comes in this hour and heals the sick lord and delivers the captive lord and fills with the holy ghost you're the same lord jesus christ now father i ask lord god as lord jesus you have manifested yourself lord to be the same lord as you have lord spoke to our hearts lord for lives lord that are in need of coming into this position for lies lord god that are already in this position but maybe
