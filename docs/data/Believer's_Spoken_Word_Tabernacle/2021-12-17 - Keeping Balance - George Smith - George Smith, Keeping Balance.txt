is it brother john god bless you good to have you too amen different ones god bless you it's so good to be in the house of the lord it's good to be in amen and fellowship around the word of the lord isn't it amen we're just just expecting amen to receive from the lord tonight we we didn't come here to be seen if we did we really came here for the wrong purpose we came here tonight because we love the lord and we we desire to hear from him amen that's what we have need of tonight just just you know just a few words from him you hear brother braham say it over and over and over but it's so true brother brown would say just a few words from him will mean more than anything and that's exactly true just a few words and and that's that's all that matters and god knows the few words that you and i have need of you might have need of a certain few words i've got need of a certain few words but god knows exactly what we have need of tonight amen god's interested in just meeting and ministering to every need tonight amen so as we invite brother george i wonder we just couldn't sing that song only believe as our brother would come amen and just to take his liberty brother george enjoy having you brother amen amen amen and when we just couldn't stand and let's just sing this [Music] only me [Music] oh [Music] amen amen a real simple message only believe then say figure it out go ask a bunch of people just only believe something okay let's pick up our bible and turn to proverbs chapter 3. and it's good to be back it's good to see brother samuel and his family a lot of good memories and this won't be a shouting message but it'll be something that'll do you some good and if you don't say man that means you're listening so it doesn't scare me i'm never worried about the empty benches i'm not worried about the people that are here actually paying attention so proverbs chapter 3 and verse 1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man i trust trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise in thy own thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil let us pray father we thank you for this occasion we can be here together we thank you lord for life and health and all the things you've provided we're so thankful lord we're thankful we have a promise that we're leaving soon yes or just pray that you would bless these few words to your people let them sink deep and be something they could chew on for a long time help us now in jesus name amen you may be seated we do greet you in the name of the lord jesus and bring greetings from some other places i've been i'm not going to name wall but we do move around a little bit the title tonight the time is now it's not next week it's not when you get ready when bills are paid the time is now and if we look over at the book of matthew real quickly matthew 24 and you've probably read this many times but matthew 24 and verse 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple in other words this was the biggest thing there was back at that time huge white beautiful building and they're you know regular jews and they're bragging on look lord look what we've done you know and he says see all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one there shall not be left here at one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down well they don't want to hear that they want a little pat on the back good job boys no he's given bad news and sure enough years later the romans came in and the stones are still sitting there where they landed you know the smallest stone weighs four tons and um we're going to go through verse five and as he sat upon the mount of olives so now they went from the temple over the mount of olives about 600 yards the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them he doesn't give him just a straight answer he works around first thing out of his mouth take he that no man deceive you which means that there's going to be a lot of it coming along watch out you know for many shall come in my name saying i'm christ and shall deceive many okay go down to verse 23 then if any man shall say unto thee no here's christ or there believe it not for thou shall rise um false christs and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders instruments that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect behold i've told you this told you before pay attention it's going to come to pass now there's a friend of brother rams called george lomza do you have along with the bible brother i need to get one it's uh it's a translated the scriptures translated straight from the from the aramaic and uh it's very similar just has a little more color he says in these last verses here of chapter 24 then if any man should say to you behold here's the christ or there do not believe it for there shall arise false christs and lying prophets that's interesting and they shall show signs and great wonders as to mislead if possible even the chosen ones behold i've told you in advance now i don't know if i wrote this level before this is a different one but this is the that still levels good you haven't poured up yet now this has got several purposes one is that you have something to focus on besides me but you remember to stay level in all your stuff and so we leave it here now if i see anybody nodding off get your attention it's okay they're cheap i can buy another one but um anyway um we're living in very dangerous times not just because they're out of your favorite stuff at the store but very dangerous time in this period of church history there's every kind of distraction every kind of deception you know you get out on the interstate they build all the stuff close so that you'll be tempted to stop in well you can only eat maybe two or three meals a day so you can't stop at all those places you've got to get where you're going you know and so um we want to know how to identify the dangers and to stay clear of the dangers you see we've got to stay balanced balanced in the scripture the promise that god gave the the uh you know giving scripture there through malachi he condensed it down to a few words but the bigger part of it is if you unpack it now he could have said now there's going to come a time and i'm going to send you know lamb of god and the church is going to start it's going to be 2 000 years but it's going to get off the rails but i'm going to send you elijah as you bring it back to the original and that's the time we got to live in okay and if we look at revelations 19 yeah keep your hand keep your bible handy revelations 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints okay so that's in the near future that's coming up for those that are ready but in the meantime between now and then there shall arise false christs that's anointed ones very anointed that they can cause others to believe like a good salesman you know and lying prophets so everybody that's got a bible doesn't speak the oracles of god uh no no um and they the anointed ones and the lying prophets or preachers will show signs and great wonders explanations opinions and figure things out so as to mislead if possible the chosen ones so don't think it's strange when people just walk away they don't even tell you they just disappear sometimes so the time is now now in revelation 7 we have and forty four thousand and if you're in doubt what that means well then you go listen to the seventh seal it's real plain there uh of the tribes of israel there's not one more not one less it's an exact number let's see god is watching over his heritage very close he's in total control of all the details that's why you pour the color clothes you're wearing that's why you're here tonight you're not at the lake you're not at the theater you're here god is in control of these things and so amongst the jews there's great anticipation now not all of them there's you know just as many crazy people there's there is here but amongst the believing jews there's great anticipation any of them that you talk to oh the messiah is almost here and but first elijah they said now elijah will either be two steps in front of him or right next to him but first we will see elijah so they know that so god in his great wisdom and his foreknowledge has chosen and he's predestinated a number redeemed by the blood of the lamb now see with the jews we know exact number you know not one more and one less with the redeemed gentiles we don't know the exact number see but when you get there there will not be any extra chairs nobody's going to be standing around the wall wondering where the chair is it's all figured out and psalm 46 10 says be still i'm god i've got to figure it out don't need your opinions and so um the bride of jesus christ which is you well that's where we're going we're headed there so focusing closely uh we are a many membered body many languages many kinds of people called out of the confusion of laodicea for his namesake not to make the pastor rich not to have the fanciest church in town for his namesake you see so we're living in very dangerous times and anyone can read history they can see the history channel and everything and uh be thankful you live now it could have been a lot worse you know they didn't used to have air conditioning being used to have hot water hello we got it made yeah and so um we uh we're just glad that we live now instead of in the physical persecutions you know but the god of glory has us living here in these closing hours of church history and he has confidence in you that you have heard it's been revealed to you and you're going to stick with the program you see he's trusted you with the mysteries of the kingdom it's no small thing because if you have any relatives in the baptist church or the catholic church or wherever you can't share all the things that we know you can't get too far back past john 3 16 you know and but he's had confidence that you can live right here in the darkest part of laodicea and overcome the demons of this age because there will be overcomers and when we get to heaven and if they do hand out t-shirts it's not going to say survivors are laid to see it barely made it praise god no we're overcomers received so 2700 years ago the jewish prophet isaiah said he said here behold the darkness shall cover the earth this is future tense okay and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee speaking of a future time speaking of dark laodicea i know it's hard to you know get a handle on that because we all have a you know 500 cell phone we got you know 40 thousand dollar cars and all no no no but it's dark late to see it okay we're in one of our darkest hours when matthew 24 24 that we just read is coming into sharp focus you see it's not with the pentecostals not with the mormons or anybody else it's people carrying this bible and these spoken word books that's who's the deceiving is going to come by okay so not out there but the same thing so how dark is it well i might have told you this before but you know if you live to get over 70 you get to repeat yourself so it's okay my kids you know they're bless their heart they're not kids they're adults so they'll catch me saying something or doing something bad i said okay well just wait you get this age see what you're like you know but how dark is it well in 1959 brother bran was preaching in the islands of the caribbean and he had some americans with him and one of them later said that he had four hours uh one day with brother branham and uh talking about a lot of things and he asked brother branham why do you um why do you say so much about 1977. well he's asking him the question 18 years before you know and of course been me i'd say well it's none of your business but that wasn't way deeper so brother brown said that he um he said as i was looking through the stream of time okay so he's seeing numbers yeah he said as i was seeing those numbers the stream of time it got so dark by 1977 i didn't see how anybody could live there well all the kids know that we're 44 years the other side now you know it's 44 years uh more dark more corrupt more subtle and we're 44 years closer to catching away the bride the secret catching away we're not going to go out here in the blaze of glory oh wow there they go now we're going to disappear because this thing is so messed up they'll be glad when we're gone really yeah so they're going to say what happened to those strange people you know all that long hair oh they're gone yeah so uh you know they were following a prophet but as the redeemed and anointed bride of christ god has provided us with our love letter right here now all you guys that are over 50 years old remember when you actually wrote a letter you knew how to spell you could read your writing remember those days yeah you don't have to be 50. but but it wasn't immediate it wasn't immediate you have to write it line the envelope find the stamp and she might get it in a week or two and then it comes the answer i already forgot what you wrote but um we have our love letter right here it's up to date and god was gracious enough to send us a prophet to highlight the things that are for our time you know and um and we can even read between the lines yeah when you're reading your bible every day remember the four steps read your bible read your church age book listen to the prophet and pray guaranteed success so we read between the lines and another thing about this love letter you don't put anything on top of your bible it's on tape oh listen he says not even my books hello the few books there were back then so this is very important he's provided with a prophetic ministry with uh god sent gift of unquestionable accuracy you see there was no wondering no guessing i wonder if this is going to work tonight no no he knew exactly what he was doing right because he was plugged in you see and so only believe and the message is totally scriptural yes it's all these foolish questions that come out on the internet let's throw them away because you will get messed up see amen and he's provided him with all the instructions that we need to walk from here to the door of the resurrection amen he's preparing us for that time you see so there's some sitting here that will not see death it's that close it's not a hundred years away it's close and uh but he says one of these days there will be a sweep come over here like a breeze you know and then what somebody'll be knocking at the door and there's your dad yeah there's the ones i've been looking for you know it's real and uh and then you'll know that the the resurrection is in full effect the day of the lord and uh that's when the minister can retire so we don't have a retirement plan you got to keep going right yeah that's what i'm doing so we're um we're not going to retire that'll be the first day of the resurrection but there will be people coming to this church the day after the resurrection and pain playing church and beating drums and they think things are going on but some of us are going to leave you see so the redeemed of the lord are focused on that day that's where our focus is the day of our full redemption and we're focused on keeping in step with god's word and maintaining in balance i know you get tired of hearing that but see we got these nice cars out here they service very well especially in cold weather but that every wheel has a little piece of lead on it what about a dollar's worth or less if you go taking that off you're going to get it unbalanced right so you got to stay in balance okay now in acts 3 21 it talks about the restoration of all things including the restoration of the bride you see restored to her original condition as we were in the mind of god before he formed the planets now some people have time and money to restore an old car it looks nice but there's lots of money involved in that so to restore means that you were at some place and you're brought back to that and that's what we're into now you see so uh that's why we press forward with successful missionary work that's bearing fruit we don't pour money into things that don't work you see individuals converted to the gospel of jesus christ people that i could never get out there and visit but we have we have memory stick with messages on it it's on the radios on different things and so when they hear the message god calls them for repentance and baptism you see but our bible tells us that that special day will be preceded by a falling away from the faith an apostasy a rebellion it's in the bible okay we'll get to it so any departure any apostasy or rebellion always begins from the inside see when when when apple goes bad it doesn't start from the outside starts from the inside you know and so uh it starts with inside going out and takes as many as it can with them so that kind of activity doesn't begin way out there no but from within it's subtle it's engaging and it's very dangerous and none of us put together even are smart enough to combat it just leave it alone because god is not the author of confusion okay so don't ever think that you are a match for the devil because you're not uh just because you've read and you've memorized a few verses and so forth that somehow you can argue with the devil and his angels and his agents and a win with your logic no it doesn't work so they stay up day and night with a fine-toothed comb looking for the flaws what what day was that brother brown actually born what happened he's gone um and so they don't feed on the nutritious manna that we appreciate so jesus had to put up with the same kind of people 2 000 years ago matthew 22 15 it says then went the pharisees now these are religious people they knew moses message perfectly without an ipad they didn't have movable press anything they had to copy word by word you know and a lot of people couldn't read anyway so here's these pharisees they had the attitude to prove it and says and they took counsel how they might entangle him with his talk in other words trap him with a question i've been around people like that so we still have pharisees today okay um and like those back there today we have people that they know the letter very well but zero revelation what good is it to memorize half the bible you've got no revelation that's right you know you buy a new pickup doesn't have no tires on it well you're not going anyplace you know so we still have the pharisees today and um if the message is not real to you i mean really real and in your soul then one day you will walk away that's right you enjoyed this fellowship and the scripture says if you've been here and you've enjoyed the preaching and you've enjoyed the music and you've enjoyed the communion and everything else and you walk away it's a one-way trip as much as you cry and scream there's no way back sorry so but for you to turn your back on the truth you have to misunderstand and reject the bible promises right okay there's the process two you must reject supernatural vindication and three according to hebrews 6 4 the person is left with zero chances of returning god is the judge not me not brother samuel no we are only fruit inspectors so when we see bad fruit well then we give that lamb a little extra attention but when he keeps jumping over the fence well see ya we got better things to do there's a limit you know so over in john chapter 8 we have the scene where jesus is in early morning church before breakfast okay he's sitting teaching a group of people now first of all you've got to realize that the church back then wasn't like this the church back then was a was a small building by comparison but only the priest came in offered the sacrifice and everything the people were out there in the courtyard so he's over there in the corner teaching some people one day and a very um arrogant group of pharisees all men they showed up with this woman and they were holding her wrist really hard and she wasn't dressed right she wasn't her hair wasn't cold and they interrupt him okay and they put her right in the middle of the or get his attention and they posed a very loaded question and um uh they probably each had a few stones in their pocket because hey we're going to get permission here that we're going to beat the tardive you know yeah and um so they interrupt him and so they um they had they were very legal and they were very ready to judge and uh because the chair the pharisees job was to make jesus look bad somehow we're gonna trip him with his words because you know he says he's he knows and he says he's god but we know the letter of the law we know exactly what moses said and even until today they have church every saturday around the world and they read a portion of their spoken word a portion of moses it's clear until the day see and so um they start telling him how bad she is and everything he acts like he doesn't hear he goes down he starts writing in the sand and he heard everything he said so he comes back up and um you know they they wanted some help in fulfilling the law the literal words of their prophet and when they finished their accusations he raised up he heard it all he looked around i'll tell you what guys the one that is without sin the one of you that never you know stole anything never looked at a woman wrong nothing throw the first rock go ahead see they thought he was down there looking for a rock to help him he was just riding in the sand but now he's up here go ahead you know so then he went back and erased it but with those words they all began to slip away yeah verse 9 there in chapter 8 of john and by discernment he was able to see her whole life you know they brought her here to get stoned and this is her day of salvation she didn't expect this you know and so they one by one they start hot potato we don't want nothing to do with this step away and um the fact is she had representation in heaven and she had been on this detour we don't we'll find out her name we'll find out the whole story one of these days but she met the master you see she came and received life from the life giver and it turned her into a real lady overnight right then not not three weeks you know her heart was filled with joy she went away with hope to live a new life so that was her encounter with the master her chains fell off she was free so it's a nice story but have you had your encounter with the master or are you just you know brother brown said brother abraham said anybody can do that any ten-year-old can learn to you know memorize but it's got to be something living see right and so um or is it only in your head or because your mom told you see we still have a lot of pharisees today yeah we call them legalists so they had their prophet's message their their prophet's message they had it memorized perfectly but they were out of balance because you can have all the letter oh just perfectly you know with no spirit or you have all kinds of spirit and beat and beat and not know what he said but jesus told the woman there in john chapter 4 uh god is looking for those that will worship god in spirit and in truth balanced see so these people they knew their prophet's message perfectly but they're out of balance so all word no spirit no revelation and um it's a word that they had memorized by constant repetition so we must worship god in spirit and in truth because your life you know here everybody looks nice some of them are smiling but you know um your life reflects what's on the inside how no matter how much you memorize i know people have gone through the ibeka system boy they memorize those verses every day and you see them a year later they don't know nothing because there's just memorization it's got to be real see um first timothy four in the lamb's bible says misleading spirits okay let's look at this in our bible first timothy chapter four um i already warned you that this one wasn't going to be a glory hallelujah but at least you'll know what it says let's see here first timothy chapter 4 verses 1 and 2. now the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some okay some shall depart from the faith it's going to happen giving heed to what seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy in other words you can't even lie right you know speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron now we don't use any hot irons today but i'm sure you've had a nylon rope you know when you cut it and kind of starts to frazzle you light a match to it it kind of binds up well that's what that means seared okay the llamas the bible says misleading spirits and doctrines of devils scofield says seducing spirits it's very very serious you better know what you're where you stand and having done all stand firm because the winds are going to blow like it did out there today it's going to blow some away you see so we do not engage in conversation with doubters negative people that was the fatal mistake that eve made everything was fine she you know she had no needs everything was provided but then mr slick come by and start talking to her and she listened and she might have responded we don't know but she might have said really wow how long you been here anyway you know and so she listened she got involved she tried to argue and we're still paying the price today spirits don't die jesus said in john 6 53 verily verily i say unto you if you do not eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up the last day so there's another promise john 6 53 the disciples were a little bit confused they were you know they were concerned you know but they stood steady see they didn't get in his face with stupid arguments what in the world what are you doing peter wanted to but you know sometimes he did you know stay quiet they did not understand what he said they were ordained to eternal life chosen by the lamb of god and i've often thought and you look at those guys lord is this the best you could find but they look at us well yeah it's okay and so they were chosen by him they stood steady believing that he knew what he was talking about okay they believed the supernatural they had seen unquestionable indication uh they believed the supernatural and brother branham was sent to us with a very simple message just listen he goes through these stories it's right there in the bible and he's not speaking to sinners he's speaking to sunday school people they they know their bible he could send up four thousand people well now i don't know the bible too much but i know the author how about that but we need to know the word also we need to know what it says you see and so um in hebrews 13 7 8 you know totally vindicated they don't stop to question or doubt a believer just believes it at the wedding of cana very interesting he was invited to this wedding and so it says right in the scripture that it was on the third day well sunday's the first day and monday is the second day and tuesday is the third day and so why is that because over in the book of genesis when the creation each day that's good but on the third day he said that's good twice so they chose that tuesday to be be married and to this day you know so they're there and he they ran out of wine they drank wine and mary got all nervous and uh what should we do whatever he says you do it they had these big old water pots there and fill them with water okay now try it well they're expecting water it was nice wine well he turned the water into wine okay and that's why they have wedding on tuesdays and so forth but you see at the branham tabernacle they have communion every uh first sunday night of the month and so one sunday night um there's the people there well one of the members at the church had a friend a neighbor that was church of christ his name was mr hill so mr hill you know uh was invited he always had an excuse but on this sunday he said fine i'll go with you so here he comes and see there's closed communion and there's open communion closed communion where it's just us and everybody stays away open communion if you say you're a christian you receive the blood of jesus christ fine you can have the communion with us you don't belong to the church so they have open communion and so here's mr hill and the member and all these other people and about then brother neville says to brother branham we're out of wine that's embarrassing those people were out of wine so brother bran says oh we'll just pray well this mr hill he thought this would be interesting so he keeps one eye open you know i mean the bible does say watch and pray and so his testimony until the day he died was that as brother branham prayed those little cups filled with wine from nothing see so the day of redemption is very very near we've had all these uh wonderful preaching we have all these miracles and everything how far away it's real close when when we the redeemed do our part and find the last eagle that's what we're trying to do that's why i travel to encourage people okay let's let's each one in our little circle be a shining light because god's program is right on schedule okay and uh spreading the gospel and being a beacon of hope isn't passing out tracks at them all no it's it's living a life you see so that people can see okay and um we want to get serious and say what he said well let's have a contest i mean it's in there you know brother abraham says in the new ministry on a sunday 1959 god knew that we would be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded now you've probably seen on your phone or a tablet or something they have the the sun and the stars and all these things all you know you can see the big picture well there was a time when that wasn't there now we put all of our effort to you know farm our two acres and do all the things but have you ever thought what keeps us together it's just hanging out here in space but why doesn't it fall and the moon comes out every 28 days and all these things happen perfect order you see so god knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded did you know that um let's say the infinite sea of god knew every fly every gnat every time they would bat their eyes and how much towel that would produce before the world was ever formed god knew all that every mosquito every cockroach all that you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching he says that's part of god's program preaching is his program okay so we established that when he looked upon the apostles he looked up on the harvest and he said the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few you all need to pray to the lord of the harvest he will send laborers into his harvest okay that's what he said and he says here well why would he why would he why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing how it would be was that done thought of a question like that he says listen here god has so arranged that his program cannot move without you and me and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we're in god's will doing this program very simple you know preaching is his program his program not mine my brother samuel god's program see so we would do well to forget our little program and get in line and in step with his divine program works a lot smoother because the fourth elijah was sent to this generation according to god's divine plan to turn our hearts back to the original where we come from and so this glorious message that we have brother brahm said brother braham said wonderful but it's only the vehicle to bring us back to the open book see so the first church age messenger paul said over here in first corinthians for we are laborers together with god you are you are god's husbandry you are god's building according to the grace of god which is given to me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another builds thereon but let every man take heed how he builds thereon for other foundation can no man lay than that which is already laid which is christ jesus now you've seen some of the houses and i see a lot of things in the neighborhood when i travel but it's the house of jackville you know it probably was a small house at one time and then they you know they got some money and they had it on more they added them back there and put a second story well be careful how you build this thing might crash one day you know so like paul says here he says we're labors together you are god's husbandry so who are these laborers together in the first sentence good question if we look real close at our bible 41 pages later in ephesians 4 11 through 16 it's all one sentence watch closely how paul structures his words it's one sentence and it's all done in love so you can read it later ephesians chapter 4 verses 11 through 16. but you see brother brahman says i believe there's a church coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection where the offices were apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church those pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the lord and i believe we're nearing that time now i believe it is so yeah uh about 60 years ago see it's nothing god's time we're living now we already forgot what we had for lunch yesterday you know that's gone and we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but we live now so today we're getting ready so these five ministries of ephesians 4 they work in harmony okay and they're in balance nobody's fighting the other no it works in harmony just like these musicians now they do a good job and each one want to be you know in their place but if she's playing in a minor and he's playing an f sharp it's not going to work too good it's got to be together let's see and um so it's under one anointing anointing the word and spirit of god now all others out there whoever they are that are out of tune that seem to be out of balance they're attracting people to themselves because they are the most important person on the block you know and that's happening right here in 2022 a lot of those people don't qualify for this verse you see but god is not responsible for their foolishness you see their tantrums and their explanations but individuals must appear on the scene to produce the fulfillment of each part of god's eternal word spoken by his prophets we spend a lot of time on the positive promises and building faith but matthew 24 24 we'll have a fulfillment somebody's going to do that you know and but some people say well you know the bible's so ancient and even the pope of rome that's the bible forget it we need a new bible yeah you're going to write at 86 years old i don't think so no it's antiquated we're smarter we live you know up on this time frame that's correct but we are smarter we're better informed but we're out of balance with god's program we've got to get back to scripture even martin luther said christ alone yes it's got to be scripture or forget it you see even brother branham says over 200 times back to the word well it might be important well in 1964 brother brown said if this all continues the way it is going right now in 50 years it'll be total insanity and that would have been 2014 and some of you guys weren't even born back then right barely and so we're in that time frame total insanity i mean i got a nice run but i don't turn on tv because full of garbage you know and um so yeah we're in that cycle right now and that is why we see the horrible things happening around the world and it's also because we see the spiritually insane because we live in a pleasure mad laodicea and we must really concentrate on getting away from this sense-bound existence yeah that's a hyphenated word sense-bound existence brother brown speaks a lot about that too so just look at these figures now this is a few years ago in the last 10 years in a three year period we had 138 students have been shot dead that makes the news in the same time period 6 million babies were murdered by legalized abortion it's nothing but murder and now i just saw on the phone today that they've they've approved where you get your your abortion pills free in the mail no problem from now on it's it's insane that's just in our country who knows about the rest of the world so we don't have any business telling those other countries how they should run their country and human rights and all this business were we to shake the stick out of them you know so our messenger was brave and he entertained questions from the audience and in one question uh questions and answers on the seals he said the question was will the bride have will the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture that's way back in 63. sure he says that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of me and samuel no consists of but stay here apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and then he added this little piece it'll be so humble see we're not going to go out in big lights it'll be so humble but we know where we stand we're sure that we're in the word you see so there's only two forces directing all the activity on the planet tonight okay every one of you is listening or following a spirit or you know in every activity every waking moment either you're following god or you're following satan so we're free human beings humans make choices we regret some of the choices and this is a serious thing it's not a game and balance is not an option the message sirs we would see jesus you follow the scripture and see if the spirit follows the scripture any spirit that does not follow the scripture is a wrong spirit well just put that on the front of the church i mean that's that's his gospel any spirit that does not follow the scripture is a wrong spirit see that's right if it goes beyond the bible it's wrong spirit if it doesn't get to it it's a wrong spirit if the devil can't keep you from seeing the truth he'll push you overboard that's his business he'll he will go off on some fantastic or he'll keep you from seeing it all together but to stay right straight on calvary it always comes right back to the word every time see the bubble is always in the middle when it's when it's balanced would want to fall so the scripture says in james chapter 2 that demons believe and tremble they know what the truth is you know but unfortunately we have people today that they they carry the bible boy they got their tablet or spoken word books you know they claim to believe and because they believe something and they're so calloused by sin and unbelief of ledocia that they don't know what the bible says and they never cry and they never tremble the devil's got them beat you know so god has a provided way amen and he says here in this other tape friends i've always tried to keep a balance of the road you get way off on formalism just as formal and ritualistic as it can be people grab that a lot and then if you don't watch get plumb over on the other side be just as fanatical as you can be but there's a middle of the road there's a true sound same gospel is preached and god moves there vindicating the truth straight as the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it that's right so it's not going to be crowds it's going to be individuals so look at these things here we have redeemed individuals who are waiting for the coming of the lord we believe all of us here okay and we're saved by grace believing and depending on the atonement of calvary that's not just billy graham's message don't get that crazy idea we all have to come to the foot of the cross that's where we start and so we have bride members that are paying attention to the ministry that god has placed in the body and neither you or anybody else can take out what god has installed i don't care who it is what the name is we've got to stick with scripture so as elect of god we are waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed remember that from august we we are going somewhere we're waiting for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she is part of that word and she's watching for her life not everybody else my life to manifest that word it's a direct quote and in hebrews 11 it says all these about 20 individuals having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided a better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so they are waiting for us see they're waiting for us to get balanced and um but so many are wasting time and money on foolishness because we still have three kinds of believers only in heaven there'll be no make-believers and unbelievers jesus told us in matthew 24 that there would come along those that would claim to be anointed and appear to be very special you know follow me single file don't ask questions i know the way but jesus told us in advance believe not such things it's in the scripture you've got to read your bible then a few years later paul came along and gave us the words in ii timothy i mean ii thessalonians right back here ii thessalonians chapter 2 where it says um now we beseech thee wait a minute ii the psalms too right um now we beseech thee brethren by the coming our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit or by word nor letter from us because there were some false letters going out that the day of christ is at hand verse 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there be some except there come a falling away and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so right here in 2022 this day this scripture is being fulfilled it's it's coming into focus you see brother brown says in the great servant moses 1955 as moses went with that judgment sticking before him that same stick tonight to the church is jesus christ if those egyptians could have ever got that little stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and the devil when he can get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he'll have the church whip and we've got any number of people putting the deity of jesus christ over here over there somewhere else and they have no victory at all so come back away from the dangerous borderline okay the borderline of unbelief um eve didn't have any idea how far her mistake was going to take her you see and none of these individuals that have turned their back on the truth uh that we treasure none of them planned to go where they're at today they thought they had a better idea they're smarter they can go yeah we can no you're going down so it's already been predicted and it's not going to be smooth sailing the good times are behind us okay troubled waters are ahead and um we always thought yeah that'll be out there someday no it's now now is the time but i thought everybody carrying this bible and these spoken word books you know and they'd be worthy of our confidence don't you bank on it now there's a bunch of liars and all kinds of stuff going on discern carefully in these days with jesus they had the pharisees they knew their prophet's message just right you know and so we have things today that people are repeating scripture they're repeating things and calling for single file believers brother brahm never said that he said arm up that means all the way across make a sweep not a single file you know hitler tried that and so um but if we look at isaiah 46 and verse 9 i'm going to go over here real quick we're not going to stay much longer let's see here isaiah 46 and verse 9 we have remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet to come in other words future say my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure god is in control okay god's map is all on one page he sees the whole thing paul wrote without controversy great is a mystery of in us in spanish he says unarguably great is a mystery of godliness but we've got people who've dedicated their entire life to prove you know their version of godhead and such no just leave it alone it's unarguably you know so the time is now for the fulfillment of certain scriptures it's the manifestation of every seed according to its kind in genesis 1 11 it says every seed according to its kind the baptists are producing more baptists we believe that you by coming here you're learning more word you're becoming more ready for a rapture you see scripture cannot be broken scripture cannot be stopped it's moving and our god is on time and he's all about balance and our canary brain can't interpret god okay god speaks to his anointed prophet and god fulfills his word on his schedule so the time is now when the prophetic word is in effect it's always been the case from the beginning from the very church first church age and um he says here in every age we have exactly the same pattern so it's going to repeat that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger that spreads out the light to the ministry of others that have been faithfully taught and if they've been faithfully taught they'll produce similar fruits and similar spirit but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger that the messenger has spoken they add here they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice be careful before we go jump into conclusions it says here um the for the for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god paul warned them to say what what he said even as peter did likewise he warned them even he paul could not change one word of what was given by revelation how important it is to hear the voice of god by way of his messengers there's always been a voice of god on the earth you see to say what has been given to them to say to the churches and according to galatians 1 8 paul you know had been with these people a few months before maybe a year he had taught them they come to repentance they were baptized now he comes back and he said i'm surprised that you strayed what happened here he said if i come back or if barnabas or even an angel comes out of heaven and preaches anything different than what i gave you over here by revelation let him be accursed that means go straight to the hot place you know so as ministers we're not innovators we're not trying to polish this and make it look different we're not looking for shortcuts we're not we're not dreamers we're not money gatherers we're just and we're not managers of god's bride when you see that step away from it we're not seeking to control everything we're just simply repeaters that's why you'll see me repeating what he said see and we are out here to encourage the bride of christ to stay with the program stay balanced and don't be looking over the fence you get in trouble you see and so our job is to make christ real to the people for the perfecting of the saints we are simply public servants to help you okay and so we got to stick with the blueprint we don't deviate you got to stick with it elijah says over here in the resurrection of lazarus he says lift up your heads redemption is drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing this is 1950. signs and wonders appearing critics infidels waxing worse and worse yeah it wouldn't it never has been easy we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to god amen so watch what you put in your head you see so the time is now what are you focusing on what are you reflecting here in dark laodicea you see in 1951 the angel of the lord you remember church that you're living in the best day that you will ever live in right now until jesus comes he says it shall gradually and he changes it not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse well 1950 that was way back now here we are yeah very rapidly things are changing so when these things come to pass what are we going to do we're going to open up saying what we're going to do you know you call 9-1-1 uh change churches yeah those people that no that doesn't work stay here and let your light shine let's see you call headquarters what should we do please help no lift up your heads your redemption is drawing nigh luke 21 28 when you see these things come to pass look up don't get involved don't try to change everything just look up so the flashing red light of his coming is another favorite message he says they have to call us bad names so get used to it they have to call the truth bad names jesus said whosoever speaks a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven yeah he said now whatever you guys say and do i'll forgive you no problem but when my spirit comes back it does the same thing one word you're off the list serious whosoever speaks one speaks against the holy ghost when it comes to the same thing will never be forgiven in this world see they have to do that there has to be a message like that to make the people make fun of it to show god's justice to condemn the whole world and destroy it while there is mercy and someone standing in the gap jesus christ an open door tonight won't you receive him wow over here in what is abraham and his seed do you know what god did he reached out with his hand and stopped it he is holding time in his hand for the church to make itself ready there are a few members yet to come into the body of christ maybe one of them is here today that's why i'm here that's why i'm led to be here not to try to persuade you i'm not speaking i'm not trying to say you know don't be catholic don't be methodist i ain't saying that but i want you to be filled with the spirit just remember i'll meet you on that day and these words will be a witness against you it's all on god's tape recording and with his great picture camera now this is 1961 they didn't have video cameras but he's talking about it on the big picture camera you know and you sitting and walking away and leaving it and you'll see your own self on that day in the mirror of god the gospel and power of almighty god is spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when god is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of that bribe so the time is now don't let another day go by until you get serious and like brother brown says the most important thing you can uh hope for the most important thing you can seek is revelation of the word that's right now we need to read it so we know what it says but it's got to be revealed to you so we're going to cut there because we can go on a long time with some other things but god knows what the needs are and i'm just glad to be alive and got breath to come and see you god bless you [Applause] enjoy it tonight amen and i thank god for his word you know it's it's true you know as so many things we're living in a time where the scripture says in first john chapter 4 beloved try every spirit and i think that's a that's a very it's a very key key point to me you know i don't have any time for anything if someone wants to raise a question about this message don't have any time for you sorry because god's already vindicated it and for a person that wants to even try to straighten things out well god never called me nor any other minister to qualify this message in the scripture god's already vindicated it what god has called us to do as ministers is come under that same anointing of the word that's what samuel poured out upon david and david went in that word anointing and what it did it brought the strength of israel back into the camp and it was the strength of israel that defeated goliath i tell you the enemy in this hours i rehearsed that quote to you from the message the contest on sunday brother brahm says satan is getting more powerful and more powerful and more powerful but it only shows you an eye of what god is to us in this hour he is greater than any power of the enemy you know i look at that always in revelations 9 when it speaks of that king that one of the bottomless pit it was given a key to release all those spirits those demon spirits began to go and found channels brother graham tells us in face of the trumpets it found channels men like stalin hitler to work through and as it was moving and working to the tender hand of jehovah to bring israel put them push them back into their homeland but yet those same spirits are released against the bride of jesus christ you see the forces that we face now you know we we catch a little glimpse and we see how that things that rise up against israel rise up against israel because satan knows the prophecy as well as anybody does he knows the prophecy that god's going to bring them back and when that moment comes that that time everything is his days are numbered but i love the very next verse i love how revelations 10 1 starts it deals with them spirits been released in revelations 9 but the very first word of revelations 10 says and i saw another mighty angel [Laughter] oh i love that and i saw so above all of these spirits this gross darkness the mighty angel the holy spirit the fullness of the word of god the person of jesus christ is here in bride form he's here in his body there's a bride that's been anointed for rapture our eyes we we're not looking for another we're not looking for another message we're not looking for a you know another revelation out here we have found him and the reality we have found him is that what was drawing and we were longing for we tried this maybe went here in the world or tried this none of that could satisfy because we were built it was ordained that god himself would come and bring forth that place that he reserved for himself in our life and that temple is a temple not made with hands god has prepared that place for himself he's jehovah jireh and he's come to bring us to himself you realize nothing else nothing else when that revelation strikes there's nothing else that matters nothing else brother brown said it just as plain as this right here in trying to do god of service and shreveport he said once you have once seen the message you cannot see anything else because it's not our eyes it's not our oh i'll read into this and i'll study this all the study and not that study is is bad but all of that like it says there was in the book of kali ecclesiastes much study worries is we're we're trying to do something brother brahm brings us and tells us real quickly he says it will take more than comparing verse to verse to make this book real he said it will take an operation of the holy ghost now to me i'm thankful for that because my understanding is not based on my bachelor's degree or my bachelor's master's it's not based on that it's based on a revelation of the holy ghost and i'm glad so that means no matter if you high school drop out no matter no matter we're not supporting the literacy but you understand it's not based upon our ability you might say brother samuel i can't memorize scripture revelation is not based on can you memorize scripture but can you recognize the living god who speaks to your heart personally and deals with your life and it's this is between you and him that's a living god coming personally to your life that's a revelation to recognize who it is that's doing the speaking that it's god who's speaking to me and that same god who's speaking to me is the same god who's always knew me cared about me loves me and desires to be one with me and direct and order my life oh how beautiful it is to walk and to recognize this within the economy of god no wonder the scripture said behold all things have become new once he has come then you're no longer ringing and reading a letter [Music] it just it just starts coming off the page or it don't all come together all at once no they don't all come together all at once there's things i i still said even in the morning in devotions there's times as i'm studying and man things just is impressing and i look and say wow wow my yeah it's like i've never seen this before what it is is that it just keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper and it's him it's him it's not prying it's just going deeper in him you know the reality of this this revelation that god has brought to us in this hour it was not a was not you or i having to pry things open but god in this hour through this revelation of jesus christ has opened took the lid off of that mountain revealed opened it up we have an access now there's an open channel there's an open channel of inspiration that we
