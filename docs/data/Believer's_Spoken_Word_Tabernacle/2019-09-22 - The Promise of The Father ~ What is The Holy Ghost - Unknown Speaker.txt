now may the chief Shepherd soul ring into their hearts this morning Lord God would overthrow every other voice and would lead that sheet safely into the fold now Lord will you just come minister healing to every every life soul spirit body come Lord Jesus we love you this have your way the name of the Lord Jesus was a turn with me if you would to Acts chapter 7 greet each and every one of you the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when I read verses 2 through verse 8 in verse two and he said men and brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia and before he dwelt in Iran he said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which I shall surely want you to catch something here the promise was ministered to him while he was yet in Mesopotamia he had not made one step toward the promise how could he he didn't know about so he can only make a step toward the promise when he became aware of the promise and not that there was just a promise but it was for him verse 3 again then if you could turn me down just a tad bit in these monitors just a tad sign get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child and God spake on this why's that his seed sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for 400 years I want you to notice this God has a boundary God said 400 years time's up that's the same way when God begins to deal with the heart and the life the Holy Spirit is saying times up devil times up times up because you see God comes according to his promises that he's made and when he takes that promise and begins to sound that promise it is like a trumpet that is being blown with such clarity and distinction it has a certain sound to it it calls it registers with that seed on the inside and they're not looking at the trumpet they're just hearing what's coming through it because they know what's coming through it that is the promise for me and the nation whoa look at this and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge this is what God told Abraham I'm gonna bring judgment to that nation that you're in bondage to and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place notice after judgment after visiting in judgment then they'll come forth and serve in this place what he gave him and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and Isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs they god bless you being seeded bless the reading of his word I'm gonna take my time maybe operate in a different gear but I'm gonna begin to speak on the Holy Ghost because it's not the Holy Ghost is not a option it is a necessity the Holy Ghost is not the third person of the Trinity it is God him self his own life it's the same God that spake and was above in the wilderness in the pillar fire that same God came down and created a body of flesh in order to pay the price and thereby redeem us back to himself and deposit in us the life we were intended to have from the mind of God you see as we read here in act and act seven a person cannot receive cannot even come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and I want you to listen to me closely and you cannot receive it unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and you can't what know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results that it brings so you know what it is and who it is and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you got it and so when we look at this the first thing I want to just deal with this morning and I'm not I'm not gonna run on a lot of types I'm not doing that I'm just gonna stay right here there's times for that but I'm just going to stay right in here because I want I just I'll say it like this I feel reserved to him to to just bring it in these in these matters so I'm going to deal with it this first here's the first thing I want to deal with just this morning the Holy Spirit is a sign I said it's a sign when you were driving down this road right here it might be your first time here or the first time when you came here but you had to look for a sign and a sign would tell you there's a gathering going on here a sign puts out a distinction puts out a mark it is to make aware of something and this sign this sign is to a covenant people and I'll say it to you like this there's a vast difference between just a Christian and a Holy Ghost filled Christian big difference so you know you can have or a Christian a person who accepts the Lord Jesus Christ there as their Savior they repent that's the first place that that's a starting point you've got to start but the only way you can repent is first of all believe that there's one who already died for your sins and to believe he did it for you and if there wasn't no one else he'd do it for you listen to me your focus is on him it's on him you say well I'm not very good at that's we're not talking about that we're talking about him repentance is not based on what you think you're able repentance is based on what he has done and is available for you repentance is you're going this direction and you repent you're no longer facing and going that direction you're going a different way there's a big difference if a Christian you see as a Christian profess to be a Christian of this Christian has not been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in process of being a Christian a glass that's been picked up but still dirty before you can before you can ever wash the glass you got to get it out of the mud first is that right there's not one of you if you were if there was a dirty dish that was laying in dirt you don't go to the dirt and start scrubbing it you you reach down and lift it there's a power that lifts and makes real to a person one has already bore your sin away sometimes that's mistaken for the filling of the Holy Ghost when they feel the burden lifted but the feeling of the Holy Ghost is where he comes to dwell what you're experiencing what a person experiences is what he's already done he's professed a professed Christian yet not field he's professed to believe it he's working listen to me now he's working to it and they just say to you like this and you sir probably come more clear in the message God does not come and fill anybody who's just sitting with their feet propped up and saying well he's gonna give it to me he's gonna give it to me God don't give the Holy Ghost like that the Holy Ghost is given to those who believe him and they make themselves available to receive why because they think they can be good enough no because they believe him are you with me we don't believe because oh this seems reasonable this seems possible that's not faith faith says I believe it because God said it glory be to God he's working to it but God has not given him the spirit of the Holy Ghost he has not reached the goal with God that he's recognized God made a covenant of promise to Abraham if you need to pinch yourself through you I don't want you to go to sleep but you will be able to come back to this message God made a covenant of promise to Abraham and that covenant that the Lord made to Abraham was I have already I will notice i I I will do this not we I Abraham had to believe the Covenant promise that the Lord had made to him worthiness worthiness Abraham was dwelling in Mesopotamia making idols making gods worthinesse he had all sorts of thing upon his life all sorts of sin and condemnation let me just say this to you the devil will try to take a life and he will try to somar that life to where that they in themselves instead of when the trumpet sounding instead of looking at that trumpet listening to God who is speaking they look at themselves let me just say this to you that's a trick of the enemy who has been the one to influence you to make decisions that you've made in the past but there's a living God present to let you know I can remove I will remove the condemnation that you can go free worthy no sir worthy that he would speak to me I don't care if you had not done one thing we are born in sin shaped and iniquity and come to the world speak in live in John chapter 3 Nicodemus stood there before the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus ministering one of the very first doctrines and the principle of all the scriptures you must be born again because without the new birth you're not even in the Covenant a man who you could not put a finger on his life the Pharisees here's the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus speaks to the Pharisees religious people and he called them righteous is this the word but when he could look beyond all of their righteous acts out here and looked down on the inside he said you're full of dead men's bones every messenger that God has sent to you crucified you cut him off when if what was what was every one of those prophets the Bible says in Hebrews one verse one through verse four that the Holy Ghost spake to the father's in the prophets in your Bible it says by the prophets what was he doing he was announcing and declaring the promise of his word I don't get tired of hearing it he called Abraham and Abraham listen Abraham heard the call and noticed what we read the result is Abraham moved out of the country and went into a strange land me to say this he had a citizenship in Mesopotamia but God was calling him to another land God was calling him to a land he did not know that Abraham it is inscribed a citizenship here but you need to come here that I can Minister this citizenship to you not a back and forth but this is a one-way one-way ticket burning every bridge behind you Amen it's a type of how God calls a man listen God calls the man to stop all his meanness repent of his sin he turns then from the crowd that he was in I said he turns from the crowd that he was in and I say this to you respectively but pointedly if you're still dwelling in the crowd that you're in and you still enjoyed that company then you do not have the Holy Ghost it calls you out of and into another company you understand what I'm saying it isn't that you can't eat lunch with them but if you join in and you're a part of that you feed of that same stuff you do not have the Holy Ghost he turns din from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd I want you to understand me these things that are ministering right now and has it just coming to me is not set to condemn you it's to convict you you can live in a new crowd among new types of people I want you to look at this after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise how was Abraham being faithful to the promise God God declared the promise when Abraham was still down there honing out other gods how did he find Abraham to be faithful when Abraham said Sarah sorry I let's get packed up where are we going you remember that old uncle I had her great-great-great great-grandfather Noah you know the same God that spoke to him just spoke to me well what brought that about is something within me begin to hunger and thirst I heard how God moved in Noah's life and I just said God if you're still real but you speak to me and God came and spoke to him I'm quoting you don't know that I'm quoting he spoke to him and Abraham began to pack think listen to me listen to me he's being faithful to the promise when he started to pack things up he's still in Mesopotamia but his heart was already it was already from here you begin to turn sometimes the turning of the heart it's things we don't always see right away but God comes to turn the heart he's first gonna turn the heart hot to be leave then Abraham he begins to pack up the journey from Mesopotamia and they come to her on at the end of Genesis 11 you know where I'm at in the Bible he comes to her on but God never told him to stop in her on God never told him to do that god never told you to stop and just come to a message Church God never told you just to stop there well I believe he never told you to stop there he turned his hair on his father's with him this is the Bible lot is with him God did not go through a list and say get rid of this one get rid of that one don't be around this one don't be around he didn't say that his word held within it the declaration for the moment woman's God saying don't reason with my word and say I could keep this I can keep this I don't need this I can get rid of this well you know so-and-so does this in church and in my bill Kate do never make somebody else your standard there is one standard among us and that is the Holy Ghost the word if you do that you'll reason yourself right into hell the scripture says those who will move in that way forsake their own mercies he's in her own what's with him his daddy's with him god never told him to stop on her own God said get the out into a land that I'll show you where's this land that Abraham didn't ask that question the God who told him to separate he said I'll show you a land Abraham had to have faith not explanations he had to believe that same voice that spoke to me and said come out is the same voice that will direct me to where he wants me to be and show me what he wants to show me calls him out separate from this separate from that said you see let me just say this to you if you're looking at everything well I don't want to quit doing this and I'm not gonna stop doing that and I'm not gonna stop doing this for brother Samuel and I'm gonna go I'm not asking you to do nothing for me I've come to minister on his behalf I'm not here representing me I'm representing the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not I'm not trying to put my image in your heart amen i'm not a vessel of dishonor i'm a vessel of Honor I want you to be united with that image of Christ and that image of Christ to be reflected in you to where when you walk down the street no matter where you go there's the presence of the Living God that is with you that denotes itself that you are a Christian you're not a Christian by title you're a Christian because Christ is in you get out of the land you see many times people are always looking at the wrong thing when you look at what you gotta give up that's the tactic of the enemy can't you see it's that old nature that's under condemnation but it's to look at who is calling you he who calls you is faithful to perform but if your love is to all of those other things and you're not willing to say love of God separate me I turn my back on that why you turn your back on it because he's calling me there's something greater than every desire that I have every dream there's something that's greater I can't explain it then you're being like Ruth Ruth left all of her country come on friends these aren't just Bible stories these were spoken in the Word of God as a direct prophecy of the children of God when orful walked up to Naomi and kissed her on the cheek and then she turned around and went right back Ruth said I'm not going anywhere where you go I'm going where you lunch I'm gonna launch and your God is gonna be my god Ruth's color vision something rules in her heart that said I'm not going back into the land of Moab Moab was under a curse and God's mercy spared it from being wiped out in the Book of Numbers why because there was a roof down there and the judgment of God would have already broke fully upon this earth but what is it there's a Ruth and Naomi Alleluia after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise that he gave him that he would give him a child and through this child all the earth would be blessed you weren't talking about Isaac Isaac was the type but it was talking about the faith child the sea child Jesus Christ because it's through that child that then can come the blessing upon all the families of the earth were blessing are we talking about the Holy Ghost God's own life well what a loving father he would pour his life out for his children then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision itself is a type of the Holy Spirit remember I'm speaking to you this morning that the Holy Ghost is a sign in genesis 17:7 I'm Melana laying this right into the scriptures I'm not skipping it I'm not trying to preach it and move along I'm doing everything I can to stay right here but I am faithful to the burden he's put on my heart in verse 7 and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee I want you to notice this God already made the is that right he already announced the promise and the covenant but God says I want to establish it I want to drive it right down my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant in that wonderful to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee he's just as much God today as he ever was and a child of God calls out from the heart awakens a low strength of the Lord awakened or arm of the Lord that same God who moved down and part of the Red Sea who opened the Jordan await thy old strength of the Lord glory be to God to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee verse a and I will give unto thee and to the seed after thee the land were in thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant beat therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations you see what God is telling to Abraham I want you to show the same kind of diligence towards this covenant that I have displayed to you I have made my word real before you and he could ask the question are you sufficiently impressed with a word in your midst then give the same carefulness the same diligence people will look over the silverware more carefully at a restaurant for spots of filth than they will examine their own soul and they wouldn't stick anything like sticking that in its got a piece of dried egg and yet everything else all around all other forms of trash all other forms of things that come in to defile remember defiles God wants his people separated we're not separated by odd ideas because I do not call the Word of God an odd idea but I'll tell you what's odd to a believer is the traditions of man that makes the Word of God of no effect where it's rendered powerless God has not lost power as a matter of fact jesus said after his resurrection when he appeared to the disciples he didn't lose power he gained power he said all power in heaven and earth is given into my hands show that same diligence here it recognized it to be God and act upon it act upon it this is my covenant verse 10 which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you notice cut away the surplus flesh it would be an evident sign and still note it'll be a token God said I want to give you a token and assurance that when the devil tries to bring his Bluffs you've got a token I want to give you something he might punch at it but it's a seal to you it's an assurance in here that you know that you know that you know that you know who gets it the past forget no no God said I do it what said I don't want you I don't want any other man's circumcising my children I circumcised them I've already made a decision before the foundation of the world they're going to be circumcised and I make preparation that in their generation they can also receive the same circumcision of the Holy Ghost what's going to stop him are you with me that's it what's gonna stop him nothing no matter what unbelief seems to be present it can not stop or hinder God from fulfilling his word when God is present brother he comes packing ready to deal with unbelief he may not be packing heat but he's packing the blood hallelujah he comes ready to deal with that intruder in your life because that intruder jumped in he cometh a thief and a robber seeketh to destroy to kill but he said I am come that you might have life and have it more abundantly beyond what you can imagine and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you eight speaks of a new beginning the circumcision is an eighth day circumcision are you with me amen and eight speaks of a new beginning because after the seventh is the eighth but you go back to the beginning again we're still in time in the seventh but the circumcision of the Holy Ghost we receive the reality of the eighth day in our soul as sons and daughters of Almighty God I'm trying not to run there what is that that's the spirit of that other land let me ask you something how do you know somebody's from a different nationality it's because of how they look okay I'll give that to you that's also how they look is a sign how they dress is a sign they'll dress according to the I'll say guard guard not meaning anything derogatory but they will dress according to the garb or that of their homeland you with me that's why our women don't wear pants not because it's a rule because God said so in his word that's why our men don't act like and look like sissies when super tight matches come on somebody it's nothing but a perverted spirit out of the pizza hell that's why women don't cut their hair why they recognize I'm a daughter of the king and my conduct reflects the king so if you're doing that you might want to bring an exile let the King of glory bring an ex out to the king that's ruling your life that's why that's why we don't do certain things why because the king and the kingdom we are of you with me this is Scripture you understand that I know I've got people here the first time maybe being here I'm talking Bible to you the Bible said that you did that that a woman is to be adorned in modest apparel and modest means free-flowing you might have a dress on but it might be skin tight like a wiener that is not the Word of God your body let me ask you something your body is to be reserved for your husband or if you're in process or even in that place saying I don't need but God I'm looking for one day your body is to be like the gold that's behind the vault in a bank you go into a bank you're with me I can't see it I got my glasses on but when you go into a bank you don't go in there and say I want alone show me the gold see how far that gets you they keep what's precious to them under lock and key nobody is going to see that that's right that's why the Bible tells us it ought to be free-flowing it might be up here and all loose but it's to cover because God said this is his word above that of the knee and not coming down his nakedness that's his word y'all with me I'm preaching the Holy Ghost this morning that's his word his word opposed you to let go a hot heels that's your idea I'm talking Bible to you this morning I'm talking to you out of the book of Isaiah and the Book of Jeremiah cut hair is regarded to God as rebellion buckle Jeremiah and that's why Paul would pick it up in first Kirk first Corinthians 7 and 11 and deal with it and he won't talking about putting a hat on your head but that covering is power on your head if sir recognize members you too have power on their head because of the angels angels lowercase not wings on their back lower case one of the lower case angels messengers earthly human messengers endowed with the Holy Ghost to call those people out that have power on their head - shell I'm under authority of the word not of a church because the church came back you up unless it's the one over there that said if own seven hills called Rome come on which is the of the whole earth come on somebody I'm talking to your Bible this morning I always talk to you by God I'm not preaching man's ideas I preach it to you the Word of God that's why the scripture said come out of her my people it causes the faith paint to be gone that's only a covering that's only trying to pretend to be something that you're not and if you're a husband and whatever more if he likes your paint he needs a good baptism of the Holy Ghost that ain't legalism that's thus saith the Lord [Applause] this is the Word of God after you found faithful he that are safe or in the least of these things I will make ruler over many God doesn't make person ruler if they're not faithful in one didn't think like a person can't even be faithful to come to the house of God who can him be faithful to pay their ties can't even be faithful in offering God didn't just say you are me around me and times he said you robbed me and tithes and offerings if we have been not faithful in the small things how can God release that great riches and I ain't talking about BMWs and houses and lands he give it to you if he wants you to have that but that's not why we serve him we serve him because of him not because of what he can't do for me but because of what he already did verse 13 and he that is born in the house and he that is bought with my money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant your gods are saying it's gonna be a sign it will not be any guessing it'll be a sign in your flesh you with me well I believe God I've got the Holy Ghost is this thing in subjection or not if it's not in subjection then you lack sufficient power that he promised you never make this perfect but mistakes are mistakes not excuses for lawful or for willful behaviors I just made a mistake you know really that's a careless attitude and you've got the greatest treasure indeed not just the earth but the greatest treasure how do we treat that treasure verse 14 and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul notice where he's going to that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant how did he break it because he didn't heed to the word he knew he ought to eat too ignorance is one thing but once you've known and you failed to act upon it then it's no longer ignorance amen so you see circumcision it isn't an option it is a must in order to be in the Covenant notice that soul will be cut off they were in the Covenant it would be a sign in the flesh that would be a witness that they were Abraham see can't you see God's desire was so that Abraham's seed would have an evident seal that whether they felt like a seed of Abraham or not they had a seal that was the answer to the devil's question come on somebody it would be an answer right there to the devil's question it would be like that word Tamar had that seal she said this this right here this is the man that I've been with here the one who sealed this is that's whose seed is in my womb the seal says this wound belongs to Jesus oh ma you see that seal when pressure would come around circumstances arise there'd be a man in the Bible in the book of Judges with one two little verses of Scripture two two little verses of Scripture but they don't take a lot of people to be a mighty man it only takes two you and God that's the majority with two vices Shamgar began to recognize all the encroachment of the enemy have been coming against him they were taking the crop every time that the crop would come near harvest here would the enemy show up again about ready when they were to harvest in the seed into their dwelling the enemy would show up this time Shamgar was not focused on the previous defeats I tried I failed I trying to fail the focus was not upon him the focus was God made a covenant with Abraham surely and I'm a seed of Abraham I've got the seal I've got the sign I've got the token come on I got the badge of believer I don't have to settle for the enemy's encroachment so sangar remember he solved in the ox gold what is an ox code it's used to prod the Ox what is ox it's a beast of burden you've got something to do sangar took that ox goad up I don't remember the exact number but let me tell you something it was more than three to one thousands but he didn't look at the odds that was against him he looked at who watch for him and I tell you that's what the Holy Ghost is if God is for you and if God be for us who can be against us the sin I walked in here a sinner today you tell me God is God is with me yes but he wants to be in you Stephen goes on in acts 7 verse 51 and he's talking to remember these audience he's talking to he's talking to religious people these were guys that well Peter Stephen begins to speak and he says ye uncircumcised in heart in heart and ear you do always resist the Holy Ghost even as your father's did you say the Holy Ghost he's faked through Jeremiah he's fake through Isaiah and they hacked him to pieces not foreign entities his people people that knew the covenants but they rose up in here was something different and different nature said don't tell me I have to have this don't tell me I have to do this to me a Christian don't tell me if that spirit surrounds you this morning recognize that's the devil and so Satan get behind me go ahead say get behind me devil I am here to receive what God has for me notice he said stiff net that couldn't be led they could not be turned from their ways but the Bible says there is a way the book of Proverbs that seemeth right unto a man but the end and the ways thereof are the way of death the circumcision sign it was after God after he Abraham had accepted God on his promise and he walked out into a strange country God uses that same sign of circumcision as a distinction that makes a separation listen to me it's not us making ourselves awed you're with me it's not us trying to be awed and different this is not me to say if I can get the right words here it's not a way of life or we're just gonna do things this way no it's not a way of life it is the way of the life it's a distinction it's a mark and you and I both know there have been people and there still are people I'm gonna call them religious quacks or whatever you want okay it hasn't stopped out there it come right around our ranks - we got nuts here - you know that is that's enticing spirits against the Word of God there is a path in the word to come into the righteousness of God repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost that's the word pass but anything rising up against our will I felt this or I did this or I did that and it is not a heart that has a style a seal a token on the inside that I know I passed from death unto life because it's a lie that a man's and lines up with the word not just out on an experience or a sensation walk in a cool freezer you'll get a sensation there to meddigan sensations but I'm saying after the sensation and experience has left where is your life Adi in the word I'm talking about a distinction and then God Who am I when God seals you he don't unseal you and let you go back out in the world and say we'll come back you were sealed I'll seal you back here once he seals you brother if he unseals you he breaks his word once you're sealed it is God saying you are sealed unto the day of redemption it's not us making ourselves odd now I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know we look odd you walk out in the street today you walk in the grocery store and you see it what listen I've been around here in this community I walk other places I see a woman walking around in a dress I look since she got a long hair okay she don't got your Bob's in her in her ears I get to looking around and I want to go up to him and say you're Christian aren't you you say how in the world would you even they may not be they may just be long hair just might be the style come on somebody oh yeah dresses are in style come on ain't talking about skin tight maxi skirts then things are sometimes more and godly than pants preach brother Samuel I will but he makes you want to look at me say hey are you a Christian why would you do that because you're seeing somebody who's taking a stand that's different from everything else you're used to see and you you as they believe or know that's God's Word it's somebody that they must have an honor it must be something maybe they were taught by mama or daddy and they never had that experience yet but there's still something about it they reverence that it's a sign let me just be very clear a person could have all of that right there and still not have the Holy Ghost but a person is not going to have the Holy Ghost and still have all the other things in the flesh walking around in miniskirts or walking around with high heels or you know putting on a little bit of lipstick I got to give myself a little bit of color if you get in the presence of God like Moses got in the presence of God in the book of Exodus the Bible says he didn't need maxfactor to make himself distinguished it was the glory of the Lord that came upon his life I know sometimes people want to use quotes they want to use I'm not against quotes you know right now tonight you know right now I'm speaking to you the truth right through God's Word but I don't believe in taking a quote and trying to hide sin that's a trick of the devil to take your soul to hell any child that refused circumcision well how could listen how could any child eight days old how could they say they don't know what's happening but their fathers Oh Lord their parents know the value of the world that they are under and their parents show that value that has been released in them and the value it causes them to take that household and hold that household to the word we're not talking about little itty-bitty fellas just eight days old we're talking about when it comes to a time to be circumcised by the God who made the promise to bring you fully in to the promised if that man was not circumcised he could have no fellowship with the rest of the congregation if we refuse to go to be circumcised he might go to their fellowship dinners but he don't have fellowship with him he might come to the church for that but it don't have fellowship because you see that fellowship ends on earthly things but we're talking about a fellowship that speaks in first John won a fellowship with Jesus Christ with Almighty God and that same fellowship among believers by having that same nature on the inside of them they've got things in common doves love doves you don't see dust flocking around with a bunch of crows doves seek for doubts and the Dove of the Holy Ghost in you seeks for that part of the Dove and somebody else that's how we can fellowship with the mystery it's fellowshipping with God in the word that's why we can look at Ruth and says that's me what are we doing with fellowshipping with the mystery of Christ that was in Ruth's life we have fellowship a person they refuse a person that refuses the baptism of the Holy Ghost that have no fellowship among those who have the Holy Ghost that's why person who doesn't have the Holy Ghost doesn't know what the joy of the Lord is they think we're you're you're off in your head yeah yeah somebody set me free I'm no longer what I used to be I found real joy amen you bring me joy lord I feel like singing but we're going to preach this is why the Bible says listen to me these are words of life jure jesus said my words that I speak to you they are spirit and life in 1st Corinthians chapter 12 for about verse 13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been made all to drink into one spirit it don't matter what your nationality is Jesus is a segregationist oh you better believe it he's a segregationist yes sir the Bible said when he was here he was separate from sinners in John 17 and while I am in the world but I'm not up this world he expects us to separate from sin he pulls on the heartstrings of our heart to him don't worry when he pulls on the heart and the heart begins to go sin will flee they need not have to give this up no it's just he there's something greater that's got ahold of me in the book of Joshua the Bible says here in verse 1 of Joshua 5 God let it be known to the people of Israel that the inhabitants of the land are melting with fear because the Lord is among you but God said that's not enough I want to confirm my word of promise with you so when you're out there in your section of the inheritance so you have the faith to go and take what belongs to you and when you're out there is a sign there's a token of my presence with you that whether you fill it or not you've got a seal verse 2 at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives can be dull knives you might leave some of the flesh on that's why they get a lot of church members that still have all sorts of habits of sin that's one reason because it's not sharp knives and brother there's only one knife I know that shark and that is Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is sharper than in a two-edged sword and the Bible said Joshua he was told by the Lord make these short knives he was in this time make short knives and circumcise the children of Israel the second time God had spoke to Abraham in Genesis 17 before the oncoming visitation and promised and God made a circumcision now God is standing once again and God is calling for a circumcision there must be a circumcision you must have the seal the token of the Covenant in your life and Joshua yes your Jesus Jehovah Savior come on somebody and Joshua made him sharp knives a man can't make a short knife Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can take that word and brother it's sharp it pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit the bone from the morrow that's the word there's that right the sharp knives who does that the Holy Ghost here he is he is with sharp knife he's not leaving a guess he comes to circumcise to separate his people from the rest of the peoples of the earth and he circumcised the children of Israel at the heel of foreskin this is why it goes on verse 4 this is why Joshua did circumcise he's listened just like Joshua's idea just one said I'm gonna be like Abraham no God who spoke to Abraham where Abraham acted like God Joshua was acting like God who acted through Abraham all the people that came out of Egypt they all came out here they came out of Egypt they were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised for the children walk forty years in the wilderness to all the men of war which came out of Egypt God let every one of them died that doubted his promise is that right thirty years old and upward cut off God cut those who started honoring that play God cut him off right away two souls to speak against the promise of God is to be cut off cuz you're calling God a liar well we're not here to call God a liar this morning here to say he is faithful he is true every word he said is yay and a man they were consumed because they obey not our unison the voice of the Lord they had the written word but they didn't obey the voice the voice they neglected to hear the voice that's why Paul could go on and say and he Bruce throughout Hebrews four Hebrews 12 they who refused to hear his voice were overthrown you see we're not walking in this because of our ability to read we have heard his voice it had been declared hear ye him the Lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that full of the milk and I looked for seven and their children whom he raised up in their stead they had said our children will be consumed in this land our children aren't able to handle this strong diet well who made you able to handle it will you not have been around it these are many years then you ought to have confidence in the God that has fed you and to know that same God is the one who revealed it to you by His grace that God does not look upon man with respect to persons God who are you telling me I'm telling you to hold that word and confidence don't be wishy-washy over your family and try to water it down yet you can't eat this lamb sodden that's the word you can't eat the lamb son you've got to eat it roasted with fire it's gotta be the fire of the Holy Ghost in you and to have that token that seal that confidence you say what God did for me he will do for my children and I'm going to be diligent to make sure that their lives are like the stones that's gathered the wood that's on it and their lives are so brought in a place of willingness I know I know listen to me now sometimes you know you get to looking at something and let me just say to you like this God will not leave one of his own behind you understand when I'm addressing here this morning I'm addressing a careless attitude I'm addressing the carelessness also I've just went pro destinated they'll make it shame on you my question is do you even know what the predestination of God is predestination isn't God picking us up by the neck and carrying us along neither is it us making all the right decisions but it's us heeding to his voice following diligently after him even when he corrects us we believe him because he said it hallelujah when that happens righteousness is there in the bank account God raised him up Satan came the Bible said King was of that wicked one first John 5 you know what I'm talking about Cain was not a seed of God because even when he was confronted with the word he spit it back in God's face this is how I'm gonna worship you you take it or you leave it and he got so jealous at God coming down and vindicating Abel sacrifice Abel didn't vindicate Abel sacrifice God vindicated it and he got upset with the vindication of God that vindication that witness was a seal Abel's righteous became slew Abel but God raised up a seed instead of Abel Abel went down but here came a Seth death burial resurrection hallelujah you cannot remove the promise of God God is not a man that he should lie you know the son of man that he should repent God would take them on in verse 8 it came to pass when they had done circumcised and all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto Joshua pinch yourself right here I'm trying to get you to somewhere here and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from of--they that condemnation that's been upon you because there was a tie to Egypt though they were in the wilderness by their nature they were still in Egypt right they were in process of coming in the van there's two parts of Redemption come out and go into they still had that about their life but when they come in sharp knives are present in this land this is a land that God has promised in this hour amen I understand by the books this is the hour Amen this is the hour this is a time in this day notice Joshua was the one who made sharp knives they removed the foreskin of the male's is that right circumcise them and God was removing that identification that still tied them into Egypt Egypt is a type of the world and God said I have come down I have rolled away the reproach you know I you can't stand the victory with reproach over your life you can't stand the victory with condemnation over your life romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk not according to the law of the flesh but they walk according to the law the spirit of life he hath made me free I said he had made me free he had made you free what did he do he rolled away the reproach Satan can come and try to tell but you can say I got a seal he's already been here and sealed alone there's no doubt for the world or the things of the world you know and love not means the word love not means enough to be content with well my daddy had this problem and this has been a family problem so your uplifting your natural family and yet claiming you're united with an Almighty God when you've been united that may be true there can be all sorts of things that run in your strength but there's one thing about it with a believer we don't have to make no excuses there's a bad that's able to take care of let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it remove the reproach roll it away it's God's distinction god made a difference in Egypt remember in Egypt he said I'll show you how the Lord doesn't make a difference is to be under the blood not just believe on the blood but to be under it and their lower to be under that blood is to have the life that was in that blood sale come and bring you in to that blood to where then he no longer sees you but he sees the blood when Abel came with his sacrifice God did not see Abel he saw his sacrifice when Cain came with his sacrifice God saw King so right but under the blood he's looking he's looking at the blood it brings us into fellowship with God and he look at this from Colossians 1:12 I'm getting somewhere let me tell you this this food right here is more important than any food that you could eat naturally you could eat a good meal right now and die tomorrow or die within the next hour but he that eateth they eat it on this shall never die and I ask you believe us about this Colossians 1:12 giving thanks all I think that's what we ought to do give thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet qualified oh if I can get good enough what you want if you can get good enough why do we need Calvary Calvary is where God become he god shed his blood and then he rose up on the Easter morning and said go tell my people but I have meat away well I'm not good enough it ain't you that qualifies you I qualified you right now know your qualities it comes from before the foundation of the world you are chosen and me and that's why there's a time on your life and you can't be satisfied in the world you tried this you tried that you tried this but you can't be satisfied why he is your qualifier am I qualified to receive the Holy Ghost he is our qualifier which have made us qualified to be partakers of the inheritance you see that it was already your inheritance you just not recognize what belongs to you it might have said on the coffee table for a long time you might have heard him being preached for a long time but all of a sudden the Covenant it starts coming forth it's not just a Bible this is a covenant it's coming forth these are not just words a men who remove no it was the Holy Ghost that moved upon men of old that were separated to be vessels that God could speak through and that same cloth comes down and he draws on that heart and he says come unto me all you are heavy laden and I will give you rest verse 10 of the Colossians 2 well I'm gonna say may not be real spiritual but it'll help you if you'll just get focused on what's coming next instead of focusing on whether I'm going to say let's stand you have a whole lot better time because I'm already standing and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power in whom ye are circumcised you mean that's not an Old Covenant thing that was a type a type in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh you that old man I said old man somebody say with me old man mm-hmm in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in Baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God you catch that the operation of God the operation of God the circumcision of God God doesn't trust circumcising his children and nobody else does that I've been circumcised and all my children down through the years I'm really in every age to perform the circumcision Alleluia I present to bring a separation between my children and the rest of the world in an incredible not ironic he knows right where his children are he don't have to say now what hospital is that let me see if my GPS got this right note he knows right where you're at and he circumcised was in every local hospital every place where believers gather where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst and I'll be there to circumcise my children to separate them from the things of the world and you verse thirteen being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses you see what the Holy Ghost is it's the seal your past is past you hear me your past is past and you're no longer tied to your past because the reproach of Egypt has been rolled off of you you're no longer walking under something with a monkey on your back but you're in the army of the Lord you got a helmet of salvation you know I've been saved you got the breastplate of righteousness the seal of God right there I do only that which pleases him hey man you got your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel you're ready to take the promises that were made to be taken in this hour your lines are good about with truth amen you made tight make sure established by the truth of the word hallelujah and you got the shield of faith for every fiery dart where the enemy wants to fire his darts of temptation and everything else you've got that shield of faith he can fire the fiery darts you can feel the fire in your spirit feel the fire there upon the flesh trying to pull but there's a shield of faith it says nope I got a seal and it puts it out submit thyself unto the Lord and then resist the devil and he will flee from you don't leave out the first part of the varus try to resist him without submission to the Lord he is the strength of my life glory he blotted out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross or brother salmon Jesus did away with the law no he simply came and fulfilled it by the spirit of the law giver himself and now Paul said Romans 5 now he said do we make the law void nay but we establish it where is it established it is established in the heart God said that's the ark that I've been after all along amen the reproach of Egypt has been rolled off of you the original seed word water has been poured upon you and has removed the affiliation of your first birth out here they can look at you and say are you saying brownie are you the same browning I used to know that used to do this and used to do that and used to do that yeah now let's just say I'm a little different than what I am now yeah but I can't do it no more because you know I've got a family and I got to be more responsible and you know I made promises and not you know I just changed really really is that what did it no God knew that cleaning up a pig you could clean up a pig but if you didn't get rid of the pig nature first chance that pig got he'd be right back in the mud hole but even if that pig could say I ain't going back on that muddle but if a pig steel could stay inside he can stay clean but if he still longs to go in the mud hole he's still guilty you with me still guilty because he still has the desire for evil are you with me now but it's got to roll away the reproach he's got to roll away the reproach of Egypt that old nature but there's been a resurrection on the inside the Bible would say you're a new creation in Christ Jesus and you act like a Christian ought to act you live like a Christian ought to live you know why because there's a life on the inside of you that makes you do it you fussing and screaming no it's now it's a life if you take out the life that was on the inside and you put that life of a lamb nature on the inside you could have a pig walking all around still looks like a pig I said still looks like a pig I do in more ways than one but still look like a pig but on the inside there's a sheep nature the smell of the mat no I don't bother me it just reminds me of where he brought me from yeah I used to walk around out there but but he changed me you mean you don't want to do it no more I know I look like that I should want to but all if you ever get changed in there you no longer want the world or the things of the world if you ever get really circumcised not with your not with your little scriptures not with your little quotes it could still leave things dull it's got to be sharp sharp that separates from the world an approach is gone now you're dwelling in the land of promise by the circumcision of the Holy Ghost it's a confirmation of your faith that every promise belongs to you you look at and you say that promise is mine you see what the seal does it brings the reality you're walking with the seal to declare the promises that belong to you as a believer listen to me carefully now you can look at those promises and say every promise when that is come the spirit of truth he will lead and guide you into all truth it guides you into the fullness of what God has promised and made real for that generation and rather for this generation it is the indwelling of the person of Jesus Christ the Son of man revealed in a bride's body and the promise of the rapture we're given authority to obtain these promises you're different when it comes on you until the mind of this world don't act like you they're against you and they don't want nothing to do with you at all you're born of another world you are just as much listen to this you are just as much an alien ten times more an alien than if they picked you up and put you in a remote section of Africa or in South America or wherever were there people you know like the people that and some of them places where they sit down they sit down a white man they'd never seen a white man never knew there was any other different color they looked at him when you'd been born of the Spirit of God you are more of an alien to this world than if they put you there you've been born of another world and that's what the Holy Ghost is it's a sign it's a circumcision you're different when it comes it's a sign your thinking is different not just your thinking up here but the mind you've been sealed the Bible say sealed in their forehead it's not some sign up here that talks about the receiving the mind of Christ come on somebody the mind of Christ they meant to be aware this is what God promised and I am a part of that promise you're sealed in your forehead amen you have the mind of Christ amen on the inside of you and you become a pilgrim and a stranger you don't just got the passport rather you've got the seal of the visa guaranteed entry if I had a passport and went to Ghana the first time I came and I didn't have a visa until like five days before how would I got to Ghana and the flight that I would have made to Ghana I could have got off the plane I'm getting my bags and I'm ready to go see brother why wouldn't I got my bags yet but I could took my Lou my you know my backpacker and my Bible of stuff in it man I can't wait to see brother Sam sent a see all the saints or glory this is gonna be a good time man I'm so glad to be here and I got there to the port of entry and they were too opened up my passport and said where's your visa oh no but I got the passport I show that I'm a citizen of the United States uh-huh but in order to gain entry here in Ghana into this other country you've got to receive the seal from our embassy and we've got officers I didn't have to send to Ghana to get the visa for Ghana I sent there was local representatives in the nation I'm living and they were able to minister to me the seal on my passport that way I could look at that and say I've got all that's required I got my yellow fever shot I've been inoculated by the Holy Ghost I could go ahead on the plane and say blessed be the name of the Lord I've already got a guaranteed entry how can you be so sure I've received the earnest the visa has come if I go prepare a place for you I will come again and I will put my visa up on your passport which shows you've got the wedding room you've already got the guarantee I'm gonna pause right here and I know I preached a little longer I know sometimes I preach a little long as it is but I want you to understand right here I'm dragging my feet through these things because that's what God told me to do I've tried my best to hold it so that it's not things where I'm out here ministering out on different parts I want it to be drove down like a nail how many services how long it takes he knows I didn't I wasn't even looking at this going this direction but he knows I was in one way but he kind of directed a little bit and said we'll save this for later after all I'm just the one who serves I don't cook it I don't order it he does he but I'll set to you like this let me just say to you if you don't have the Holy Ghost the first thing you need to do is just evaluate have you done all that God's asked you to do have you repented and if you've repented and you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bible says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's some keywords sometimes that we overlook the gift in case you don't know him my birthday's coming up birthdays used to mean a whole lot more to me before now it's just another passing the one thing I do look forward to Billy do I get the dessert I want in there right honey in the presence of all these witnesses but let's see here's a box and it's a gift now let's say that you came to my birthday party when you came to my birthday party you will make sure you bring a gift now you know I'm just using this as an example right I'm not trying to drop hints but that gift when you walk in the door with it brother Brian if you walked in my door with a box and head rapping on it or maybe you have one of them little bags coffee beans in and or something like that by the way if you walked in with that box you know what I wouldn't be wondering I mean I may have a little bit of a question like I wonder if that's for me but then if you take that gift this box and you see where my wife has the table it's decorated by the joint it's got the cake on it and I'll see you will look over it and you set it down right there I know that's my gift I didn't ask you for it I didn't earn it matter of fact maybe I had offended you or maybe I said something or didn't say something so you didn't bring it because I earned it but a real gift for the joy when somebody gives a gift it's not out of the wrong motive with strings attached to it it comes from the heart and the heart of God is Christ God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son God came down and said these promises I'm gonna let you know it's for you I'm gonna come down and walk among you I'm gonna show you what's in here it's for you because I'm gonna wrap it on the outside in a body that can age can be tempted we have to turn its head and walk away I'll wrap it in humanity and I will so set it down that you will recognize they will minister to you this is the promise when that gift comes in and is set down by my cake the greatest thing that I could do is say thank you thank you because I know you've got something in you you got something and you thought of me you see what that is the gift shows you were in somebody's thinking before they ever showed up with a gift you were in his mind before the foundation of the world he sets down the gift elster listen to me look at somebody and say listen the worst thing I can do is leave this set but the greatest thing I can do is to take it and to open it up he was bruised from my iniquities chastisement of my peace was upon him God opened his side that he might release what I needed I didn't even catch this before I wasn't able to see without this except a man be born again he cannot even enter the kingdom it's to receive that gift because it's got your name on it when I when y'all open that box or to receive that of the Holy Ghost brother Trevor to make it mind to say Lord I want that gift that's for me that's to open that box with faith and say Lord you've given it for me and you opened that up by faith faith said he made it available for me and you open that up and you just receive it that's the greatest honor and compliment that we could ever give the Lord Jesus Christ Almighty God to receive the gift that he has sent and to take that well things but different now I see ministries I'm seeing things differently now things look different why there's a different site that's coming I never forget as a young man when I said in the back of the class and I had to ask people I thought it was normal to ask them that can't see your notes you won't because while mom and daddy didn't take me you know back in the days when I was growing up in 3rd 13 and 42 cooler classes man but ago I didn't know what was going on with me I was asking people hey he's here notes we had teachers back then that wrote a lot of notes then one day brother rich me somebody told my mom and daddy said I think Sam needs glasses they took me where I needed to go they didn't take me to a medical doctor brother Scott I love you but they didn't take me to a podiatrist you know I love you they took me to an optometrist I think I got that right they took me to an optometrist because they knew he knew how to specialize in getting write down he was checking certain things he was checking things and brother Trevor he put this on and I'd look at I'd say they'd say read that line I just it was hard for me to read them letters I was trying I'm trying my all to read them then he flipped it again how about now it's a little bit more cleaner he's this better one or two to expose this one off he's trying to work it on this house this one I have the hardest time trying to see myself as a Christian that couldn't be me am I the Lord that he sent the Holy Ghost for then he died for me they started doing this and then a venture Oh Drake I looked and I started being able to read the first thought I could read was repent be baptized in the name of she said it was real big letters listen can you read on down it took me a little bit Nizar here here let me give you a little bit more power let me give you some st. to find power well it's better one or two and then I could read the next line I'm sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ he is my sanctification then he asked me said can you read that next line boy can you read it says the gift it was to the prophets no no no you're not reading it right let me give them a bit more power we'll see the promise yeah yeah yeah is to them oh no no I give you a bit more power the promise is to you the promise is to me now you're getting it now you're getting it sufficient power that's present for you to see yourself as a believer and to recognize the Holy Ghost is for me then he says I exam good inspection over with here's the seal here's your prescription the prescription has a lot of chapters and verses that pertain to this hour hey man it cannot be impersonated but brother that prescription became limbs on my heart to wear are recognized God is my father I am his son you are his daughter what did that the lens of the word the Holy Ghost and now I see [Music] myself like my father does brother doesn't know like I know like I like my father does I'm a citizen of the future home I'm a citizen of the kingdom of God and being a citizen of the kingdom of God I've got all the rights that a citizen has when they want to try to take rights from Paul he was a Roman citizen he said I'm a Roman citizen I got rights as a Roman and we are sons and daughters of God we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved so I say to you this morning as I pause I that Paul's took a little bit theirs but I said that don't want you to understand if you haven't received the Holy Ghost but now this morning you know it's a sign it's a seal that God puts on you you don't earn it you can't merit it you can't be good enough but you must receive it and you as he tugs on your heart you surrender to him and you let him do his work he tells you did the Holy Spirit conviction and they'll lay aside this laid aside and walk on with him I say this morning if you don't have the Holy Ghost and you want to receive maybe you have the Holy Ghost and I'll saying I'm gonna say maybe I say you have the Holy Ghost but you want another refilling maybe you find you've got a little careless about things and you said Lord I want a refill of the Holy Ghost now I don't know what your need is but he knows what it is he's the physician on call this morning and he's here he answers his pagers he answers his texts he knew you were going to be here this morning so he's made sure that he's got the right equipment remember don't look at yourself look at him he can roll away the reproach of Egypt right now right off of your life and then when you get out of here what he's already rolled away here will show out here don't you love him whether you want the filling of the Holy Ghost or you want the refilling of the Holy Ghost why don't you stand to your feet right now you make your declaration in the presence of God the first thing we've dealt with here this morning a little bit it's a sign it's a seal in your life now I've stood here under his inspiration and I'm under his inspiration right now it could be said as it were as somebody from Ghana who's down there at the Embassy in Washington DC they've got a seal with an authority to notarize when everything is accepted here this morning this is God's promise and the ceiling angel of the Holy Ghost he's here this morning maybe you haven't repented of your sins and you need to start right there but I want you to know that the Holy Ghost is for you now I'm going to ask you to do something that's one little little fella in this army I'm gonna ask you to do something I'm going to ask you not to look for any feeling or any sensation you might have a feeling you might have a sensation what I'm asking you to do is to look to him and to believe he is the god of his word and believe me when he circumcised 'as one who's been circumcised you know you've been circumcised you just leave it at that is that all right now let's pray or Jesus Lord your word has went forth here this morning Lord I believe that here this morning I feel more inspired and more anointed than I ever had so direct you here this morning Lord you set the course for this service so Lord what we're asking for it is your will you said in your word if you were to ask your heavenly father or your father for a piece of bread would he give you a stone no he would give bread how much more your heavenly father if you're asking for the Holy Ghost will he not give it to you right now this morning will you just agree with me if you have an uplifted hand mostly with the heart that's open say lord I want the Holy Ghost Lord I want the seal of promise Lord I want to I want to refilling of the Holy Ghost that comes with the seal I have a right to that Lord and that's my desire I love I love the Holy Ghost lord I love you it's you I want more of you to take over more of me Lord Lord Jesus in this Lord in the presence Lord God of the Living God Lord every hand Lord that's uplifted Lord and the hearts that's behind that hand Heavenly Father I ask right now dear God that Lord that you would move upon that heart Lord some that might be here Lord in repentance Lord but even in their heart they're moving right now in repentance Lord and where the Holy Ghost Lord can go right to work in their life Lord and bring a complete sanctifying Lord in their life Lord God a complete feeling lord I pray Heavenly Father the Lord has you have brought Lord God your word to our hearts this morning their hungry hearts Lord God then Lord are gathered here Lord that are asking you Lord for the promise Lord that you have made of the Holy Ghost in their life Lord that they would be Lord a circumcised people Lord that are cut out Lord God from all the rest Lord God bearing that seal and that sign of the Living God father I ask right now Lord God that you would fill him Lord God with your holy spirit of promise Lord God according to their faith Lord in the word according to the righteousness and the merits of Jesus Christ our faith rests Lord God in you Lord God in dinosaur God upon the merits of the shed blood of the Lamb we rest Lord God in that merit Lord and we ask Lord God that father you would pour out Lord of the Holy Ghost Lord God we stand Lord God as
