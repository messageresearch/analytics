God for your anointing and your guidance as we open the scripture tonight we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I want said [Music] I want to read verses 14- 18 as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he ha not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God you may be seated what I'd like to speak on tonight I uh I know it's would probably be just review for many of you here tonight and hopefully that uh it will be a help to the young people and that it maybe be a help to you maybe even in your witnessing what I want to speak on tonight and I'll just probably just get an introduction of this and we have to finish it up on Sunday but is the importance of understanding serpent seed the importance of understanding serpent seed turn with me if you would to Numbers chapter 21 now what we read from John that was the Fulfillment of him bruising the Serpent's head but now I want to read something here from numbers ch 21: 4-9 and they journeyed from Mount or by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people were much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have he brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul Loth this light bread and and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much of the people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses said we have sinned for we have spoke against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery serpent set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived now it's strange brother B said you might wonder as children of the Gospel how could the serpent represent Christ in this particular part of the scriptures but on the on this journey they had spoken against Moses and they were brother B said they were chatting against Moses and they sinned and God sent these fiery serpents in and and if you notice they asked Moses to pray that God remove him but God didn't remove the serpents but instead he commanded Moses to make a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole that all that got bitten could look at that and when they looked they live why would a snake represent Christ brother Bram said well because the snake the serpent itself represented sin already judged God judged the snake in the Garden of Eden he give him his judgment there took his legs off him made him down from a human form and put him on a level see the snake the serpent to begin with was was not a reptile the Bible said he was a beast the most subtle of all the beasts of the field he walked like a man in everything the most subtle but the curse cursed him and taken away his subtleness or his Beauty and throwed him on the ground and put him on his belly to crawl so the serpent that was on the brass pole represented sin already judged the pole represented the cross so it represented sin already judged by the cross questions and answers brother bam said the woman's seed which was Christ Mary brought forth Christ and the serpent seed which was Cain come down to Judas es scariot there was both Jesus and Judas incarnated right there God and the devil on the cross of Calvary there was four people diing there was a thief on each side of Jesus and Judas hung himself on a sycamore tree which is a cross curse is he that hangeth on a tree there was one Thief that said if thou be the Son of God take us down the other said Lord we do justly we we getting punished but you done nothing remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus said today shalt thou be with me in Paradise there was Jesus the the gospel preacher preaching on the cross there was Satan going back to Hell taking with him the seed of the serpent the unbeliever there was God going back to Heaven taking with him the repented sinner the seed of the woman it was not the seed of the devil it was the seed of the serpent the serpent had a seed the Bible said it had a seed and it still exists today the seed of the serpent so much now I'm not going to go so much into uh explaining serpent seed but just for a moment we know that in the garden it wasn't apples we know that we know that the serpent was the closest thing to man and we know that uh that the Bible says that Adam knew his wife and she bear son and called his name Cain then she bear another son and called his name Abel and we know that Adam called her Eve after this because he said she was the mother of all living but it never did say that Adam was the father of all living there's no scripture that ever says that and so I believe it's in uh the 3r chapter 20th verse something like that it's where it says she was the mother mother of all living and if there if there is a significance to that scripture being said that way God doesn't make any mistakes right and there's no mistakes in the Bible and there's no contradictions in the Bible so why would he express it in that way and say Eve was the mother of all living if it wasn't to say Adam was not right right and we know that the serpent had a relationship with Eve and then that morning and later brother R said that evening then Adam was with her and then she had two sons brother mam says all life comes from God the the very Miracle of Life comes from God but Eve broke the word that wasn't the way that God meant for it to come he meant for it to come by Spoken Word but he put man on free moral agency to make a choice God couldn't make man and cause man to fall but we know he had attributes in him to be a savior and in order to be a savior there had there was a need something had to need to be saved and so God put man on free moral agent agency and it was man that made the choice that he made Adam actually was a typ in Christ in that he went to save his bride had not Adam done what he did then Eve would have lost her life but Adam went to save his bride and so then Adam was not cursed Eve was not curse but God cursed The Serpent and said upon thy belly shalt thou go the scripture itself testifies that prior to this he didn't go about on his belly because if he had have then why would God have said I'm going to curse you and make you go on your belly if he was already that way he wasn't walked upright like a man he was a beast not a not a reptile and and so Satan Satan could not come and have a child by Eve but Satan could come and enter animal life which was the Beast The Serpent and then by that the serpent then would have a son and that son was influenc Ed of the devil the serpent didn't have a soul but when Cain was born because it mixed the Serpent's Seed with the blood of the woman then Cain came forth having a soul if Cain didn't have a soul then God wouldn't have said to him if thou doest well wilt thou not also be accepted brother Ram said in other words he said if you worship like your brother I'll accept you God didn't just put that out there and not really mean it God meant it now by for knowledge he knew what Cain would choose but he gave Cain opportunity Cain had just as much opportunity as Abel had right but see the Bible says by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain what was missing with Cain brother brandom said that God slew a lamb he took animal life because it was animal life that brought about the fault and so God slew animal life to cover up his children but Cain brought fruit the original belief that it was an apple or some type of fruit brother Bram says in one place it was because Adam and Eve told the boys that but by Revelation Abel it was revealed to Abel what it was Hallelujah and you say but it doesn't seem like it's fair if it wasn't revealed to Cain it was revealed to Cain after Abel did what he did and God said if you do it that way I'll accept [Applause] you but Cain being beast like he reviled against God in such a way even more than Satan had yeah and turned around and slew his brother thinking well I'll tell you what you're going to accept it my way because I'm going to do away with Abel the only one you'll have left is me in my way and then when God came and you know told him your brother's blood crith from the ground and he questioned Cain about what he had done right and then when God put forth a sentence on him remember Cain said this punishment is too hard I find that quite outstanding to think on that that after he killed his brother and now he's to become an outcast and be marked then him to say oh that's just too much punishment I mean after all all I did was kill my brother that spirit's still alive today future home brother Venom said see they can't find the species between chimpanzee and man each one of them is evolved up from the birth and up to the monkeys and so forth up to the chimpanzee then there's a loss it was the serpent not a snake every form is lost from him because he was cursed God didn't curse Adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the Earth the thorns and the thistles he didn't curse Eve but said to Adam would be her ruler and from now on she ain't to try any preaching or anything Adam is a ruler all the days of your life and sorrow you'll bring forth life into the Earth but he said I'll put enmity between your seed now she didn't have a seed she never did have so she had to receive a seed from some way God gave her a seed but not by sexual intercourse but by creation Now what what is he speaking of here when God gave the woman seed was when he came to Mary and said you'll be overshadowed of the Holy Ghost and you'll conceive and bring forth a son and you'll call his name Jesus that's when she received the seed he said can't you blind people see that the serpent seed Satan got there before Adam that was the seed but she received the seed what was it God himself he was the beginning of the creation now remember when Moses when God was giving him a sign when he was at the burning bush and he's getting ready to go back God sending him back to Egypt and he has a a Shepherd staff in his hand and God gives him a sign tells him to throw the staff down when he does it becomes a serpent and then when he told him reach down and pick it up again when he picked it up again it became a staff again right Moses I guess would have said I've seen strange sights today so when he seen the stick turn to a snake now what was the stick it wasn't an ordinary stick anymore it was the Judgment Rod of almighty God what did it symbolize the cross how would it symbolize the cross because it was on the natural it was wood on the spiritual it was a serpent and how could the serpent represent Jesus the serpent as it was a rep was not a reptile it represented sin already judged as as it was a snake for Satan had sin in the serpent in the Garden of even which was not a reptile he was a missing link but between men and animal he stood there as walked upright was the most subtle of all the beasts not reptiles of the beast of the field and when he had was cursed his legs went off him and on his belly he went and that showed he was already judged when he became a reptile and then Christ was the their sin and the serpent already judged the lamb slain from the foundation of the world you see it now he picks up the stick and the Supernatural on the stick was a serpent Supernatural it was a serpent in his hand natural it was a stick in his hand the cross plus Christ the Judgment here he goes down to Egypt as I've said many times a Onan Invasion so here the staff represented the cross and when it turned into to a snake it represented judgment that sin had already been judged and so when they got down to Egypt and Moses put had Aon put the stick down and he did and became a serpent then Janes and jambre came out they said well uh Pharaoh cist just no more than a parlor chck and so janny's and jam came out and they throw down their staffs and it they became serpents but notice the serpent from Moses staff swallowed the other two serpents and when he picked it up again it become a staff and it wasn't any bigger than it was when it started out it was judgment the staff represented judgment to pharaoh now we know the Bible says that Jes that God said let the Earth bring forth grass and let every seed bring forth of its kind and said the cattle let it bring forth of its kind let the foul the air bring forth of its kind let the Beast of the field bring forth of their kind so every seed was to bring forth of its kind and then once that God spoke that then he said let us create man and he created and said let us create man in our image and he created man in the image of God and the Bible says male and female created he them now the seed that was swn in the garden by the serpent fathered children and from there came a line or a lineage from The Serpent and notice in the lineage of Adam Cain's never mentioned he's not mentioned in the Old Testament he's not mentioned in the New Testament in the lineage it says that Seth was the son of Adam who was the son of God and and it it shows that Enoch was the seventh from Adam and when you count that up it doesn't leave any room for Cain so Cain was never counted in the lineage of Adam or in the lineage of God so it mean that he was in the lineage of The Serpent and so then he could father more children that would be Children of the serpent and these children of the serpent never had in them the love of God that's right religious yes amen build religions make religions build churches do all these things but to actually have the true love of God the Bible says how can you say you love me and keep not my Commandments [Applause] if you love me keep my Commandments Now read with me if you would in Matthew chap 23 verse 27-35 Jesus speaking here says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like unto Whited sers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all uncleanliness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity wo unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the suppliers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourself that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers ye serpents ye Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of Hell Jesus didn't pull any punches this is many times I say this and I don't really mean to make light but this is sweet Jesus you would say I just want to hear about sweet Jesus this is sweet Jesus wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall you scorge in your synagogues and persecute them from City to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of the righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of bakus whom you slew between the temple and the altar now he's speaking of something that happened in 2 Chronicles if you if you want to write it down if you want to see it later 2 chonicles 24: 20 through 22 here was a man of God and he was speaking to the people and the King commanded them to kill him and they stoned him right there by the temple and that's what Jesus is speaking of that very act and he's saying you are the children of them that did that now Cain was the first murderer why because his father was Satan through the serpent and so he fulfilled up the measure of his father who was a liar the Bible says from the [Music] beginning and these that Jesus was talking to here he's saying you're of your father fathers and he even right out called him serpents and to show they already judged then he called them viers and he told them there's nothing going to save you from hell that's right why because of their own works and they were the children of their fathers who were not the children of Adam but were the children of the serpent the children of Kain now the seeds got inter mixed the seed of God and the seed of the serpent got intermixed in Men in mankind and he asked how did the serpent seed get across the flood came across in the wife of one of the bo the boys there is a name in can's lineage I looked up the meanings uh there's about seven names I read down through the meanings of the descendants of Cain and it finally comes down to one that says and his name means who is of God who is of God by then it have become to a place because people asked brother Ram said who did Cain marry he said he married one of his sisters now to marry one of his sisters it would actually been his half sister who would have been the daughter of Adam who was a Son of God so she would have been a daughter of God see and it became to were then that didn't know who was who and Satan not being like God Satan doesn't know who belongs to him but as he sees you accepting the word hallelujah and he begin to take affecting you he begins to recognize that you are of God but that doesn't stop him that makes him want to pour it on all the more he hates you I'll show you this further Stephen when he was being stoned remember Stephen he he called him stiff necked and uncircumcised of heart you you always resist the Holy Ghost and then he said which of the F of the prophets did not your fathers persecute Jesus says then in Luke I love this scripture blessed are ye when men shall hate you I love this scripture blessed are ye when men shall hate you when ye shall when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast your name out as evil for the son of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day leap for Joy for behold your word is reward is great in heaven for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets what is this showing you your identification when men Hate You cast your name out as evil when they persecute you when they set you from their company when they reproach you what is it it's showing you are of the prophets it's showing your lineage he said you should Rejoice jump with joy hallah why because it shows who you are look every scripture must be fulfilled and if he said there was going to be some that would hate the Believers would hate his children and would bring reproach to him then somebody's got to fulfill that somebody's got to be the one that's hating you some somebody's got to fulfill that part I don't want to fulfill that part that's why I jump for joy when I see the part that I am fulfilling I'm the one that's being hated I'm the one that's being reproached I'm the one they're separating Company from there's some folks in Dixon it wouldn't darken the doors of the church where I'm at I would never s under that man praise God now I want to touch a little bit into predestination but uh like I said we'll prob to finish this up on Sunday and believest thou this brother bam said now Jesus when he was born I believe all gifts are for ordained the forn knowledge of God I believe there's nothing that you work yourself up to or anything that one person can give to another and therefore I believe that all gifts were for ordained of God to come into the world for instance Jesus himself he was for ordained of God to come into the world do you believe that he was the woman's seed that was to bruise the Serpent's head his head was Bru his head was to bruise the heel I believe that Moses was for ordained of God do you believe that when he was born he was a proper child he was raised up in Pharaoh's palace with his foot on the throne to become heir of even Pharaoh's son to fall heir to the throne but he was ordained of God if he'd have been an ordinary man he'd have went ahead and took those great honors but he was ordained of God for another purpose the Bible says by faith that Moses refused to be called the son of pharaoh Hallelujah why there was something in Moses it was right there available and if he have been an ordinary man brother random said he would have took it but he wasn't an ordinary man he was a man called of God when you're called of God and I'm not in this I'm not talking about a calling for a gift every one of you God called [Music] you when you're called of God you can't escape that call you can't do nothing but there's something in you that just brings you to it now Satan will come along and he'll try to confuse your mind to make you think that's right that you're not one of them yeah so folks I've talked to who left the message then came back they never they felt like they never really left the message they just went they came back slid but they never questioned whether the message was right or not but Satan got him to question whether they were right or not whether they was one of them or not what seed were they of but to show you were not of the seed of the serpent watch what brought you back what brought you back was that seat of God that was inside that Soul Satan thought he had you but he couldn't hold you why there was something within you that was screaming out it wouldn't let you rest why you were a child of God not a child of the serpent praise the Lord authority of the word he says how many beliefs gifts and callings are without repentance the Bible said so Jesus Christ was a Son of God from the very beginning from the Garden of Eden he was the woman's seed is that right that was to bruise the Serpent's head Moses when he was born he was a proper child God had him brought there Moses had nothing to do with it is that right God told Jeremiah said before you ever formed in your mother's womb I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet over the Nations how could he help it what are he saying here Jeremiah couldn't help but fulfill up what God had called him to why because God ordained for him to be that and he goes on to say gifts and callings are repentance you're the way that you are because God made you that way Hallelujah you're the way you are because God made you that way what makes you hunger and thirst after the truth why are you not satisfied with joining the church putting your name on a book and saying well I'm a church member why doesn't it satisfy you why are you not satisfied with just having uh a a form of godliness why because God didn't make you for that you were made to serve him in the truth of the hour what caused you to believe cuz God made you that way you're his children that's why [Applause] [Music] in the natural that's the way all of us are in the spiritual we do what we do because of who our father is [Applause] before Jeremiah come to Earth the great Prophet Jeremiah God said before you were even formed your mother's womb I knew you and called you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet over the Nations it ain't just what somebody does it's what God does hallelujah it's not what we do or what we can do it's what he's already done he overcame for his children it's all together by Grace it's not by desire it's by Grace God called Abraham out of the whole world of people why because Abraham was better no sir it's Grace God's chosen election and call you are what you are because the grace of God has made you what you are Hallelujah who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature is that right it's by Grace here he says in my angel I go before thee he says you can't help because you have blue eyes who taking the thought could add one cubit to his stature if God wants you to be a certain thing he brings you to this earth to be that and you will be that hallelujah hallelujah take that devil Hallelujah God wants you to be a certain way he brings you on this Earth and you're going to be what he made you to be he made me to worship Him He made me to serve him he made me to believe the truth he made me to become one with him Hallelujah Israel and the church he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed he'll bruise the head and his head will bruise your heel now I will when God says he'll do anything you can look for it to be done when man says he'll do anything I don't know about that but God told Abraham I will save you and your seed after you not only Abraham but all of Abraham's seed unconditional I'll save you unconditional oh I'm so glad I'm so glad that it doesn't it doesn't depend on your natural heritage that has nothing to do with it the Bible tells us that I believe in the Book of Romans where it speaks about Esau and Jacob it didn't matter what your natural heritage is what matters is what your spiritual Heritage is that's what causes you to serve God says if you excuse me I believe I'll shout a little oh look you just don't know realize people what it means maybe some of you has never thought deep enough to get into it God has already glorified his church those who he justified he also glorified in the church in Christ if you're justified in Christ you're glorified in Christ already as far as God's concern Glory Hallelujah listen to this Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ tonight every born again Christian is perfect I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was [Music] Hallelujah you are to every other believer for it's not my Holiness it's his holiness God can't accept mine I have none but I come in Christ by faith and by Christ I'm in him and perfect in the sight of God by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and become members of this body Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but the spirit and a man that's in Christ Christ Jesus walks after spiritual things to the world its carnal mind its foolishness but to them that believe it's everlasting life there you are how marvelous then what can harm you you're in Christ and just as sure as God raised Jesus from the dead will come in Christ amen yes we've got to God's done promised it for just as sure as the body goes up I'm in that body I have to go up with it Hallelujah you say you believe in eternal security then brother randam in one way I do I believe the church is eternally secure the church is cuz God already said it would appear before him without spot or wrinkle now the next thing if you're in the church then you're secure if you're in the church now he's not talking about an organization he's not talking about some building he's not talking about if you go to brother Donnie's or if you go to brother Samuel's or if you go to brother bisc because there's three kinds of Believers everywhere you go he's not talking about if you go go there but he's talking if you're in the church the Bride of Jesus Christ in the body that spiritual body he that comes to me I will in know Wise cast out and listen here's the man's word about it Jesus Christ St John chapter 5 verse 24 whosoever he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath pre present tense everlasting life that's not just from one meeting to another everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment or the condemnation never be cast away but hath passed tense passed from Death unto life St John 5:24 Jesus said so I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven your father man in the wilderness and are dead but he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood hath everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last days that's what he said Hallelujah Bible says Moses was a proper child brother Braham said it wasn't because he was Moses but it was not because of something he had done but it was because God chose him before he was ever even born I like how brother brandom says he says talking about the bells and how they will bring him to make him to have a certain ring to them and then brother Brandon begins to speak about you and he says God put this man with this woman and then this man with this woman this man with this woman this man with this woman he said to get all the way down to you so that you would be a certain way here on Earth so what you are here on Earth you are that because because that's what God meant for you to be not this Fallen State condition where we grow older but God meant even for the personality that you have he wanted it to be that way brother brandham when he went squirrel hunting he didn't just shoot the squirrel he had to hit it in the eye every time why he had to be exact every time he was that way in the spiritual sometimes you come across people you say Well they're stubborn let God get a hold of that when God gets a hold of that you'll see they won't move off of God's word for no man or not no one God wanted you to be a certain way spiritually and he had you as brother Bram said in the back part of his mind an attribute that was going to come forth but he also had that he wanted you to have blue eyes or brown eyes or green eyes or hazel eyes or he wanted you to have a certain color hair he wanted you to be a certain way why because these were all representations of his thoughts you were in the mind of God and God chose you before your great great grandfather and great great grandmother ever came together God chose you just like he chose Jeremiah before he was ever formed in his mother's belly he I love how he says that he didn't say once you were conceived and formed in the belly then I chose you he said before that before even that I chose you and I called you and I Sanctified you and I ordained you to be a prophet before that God called you before that he ordained you I hope I hope I'm getting my point across to why it's so important to have a revelation of serpent seed because it's important for you to know who you are now there's many that pretend to be in there there's many that's Waring themselves and trying to live right and trying to press in I don't know about that but if they are in there it's just as easy to live a Christian Life as it is to live any life because you're in Christ nothing else but just so full of the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and direct you and why sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down because no more than you could make a stock of corn a sycamore tree what's he saying you might fall he says make mistakes but you won't that you won't stay down why because you are what you are he said you won't stay down no more and you can make a stock of corn and sycamore tree you can't do it Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them you have everlasting life one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear Everybody's scared to death what's going to happen who what why Jesus said even when the fearful sights come lift up your heads and rejoice for your Redemption draweth nigh when these things happen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord let's stand brother Samuel here to come brother amen God bless you amen thank the Lord for the Still Waters amen we're looking in Still Waters amen so thankful to God Amen for his Mercy it shows that no matter no matter what his word cannot be defeated amen because he is the word we are we part of that word a part of that life a lot of obstacles a lot of things but that's where that prevailing power of his life that's raising that seed and even when he's drawing that seed there's a lot of things that can be over that seed you think of how the prophet said with he said you take the cement and he said they plant it over top and he said you watch he said that weed that's beneath it he said it'll come out and find that light you can't do away with it it doesn't matter how dark everything is yet when God has spoken his word is light and that light when it goes forth it raises and calls every one of his children that's our identity that's what gives meaning and purpose to our lives we're just here we we work we do all those other things everything that we do is temporary but our purpose here is to serve him that's our purpose God has ordained we are co-workers within this message that God has called you believe that brother Bram took a group of ministers and he sets them around in 1962 and and Brethren he said and he speaks to the minister he said look he said you are in this message with me he said you are co-workers in this message that's for every one of us it wasn't just Noah building the ark ham Shem and japheth were there as well it was a household and God has commissioned us we are born by the grace of God ordained in this house to labor to reflect Jesus Christ moving to the coming of the Lord greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world aren't you grateful for that amen if it was by our if it was by ourself he for if it was by our strength hey we give up a long time ago just like when they asked brother brandham brother Bram said no he said it's not me holding on he's holding to me Hallelujah that's an absolute when that absolute is taken hold is a seal from the inside out and we have an anchor like Paul said that blessed anchor from the soul that enter into the veil oh my you love the Lord my I'm just bubbling over he he he let left me enough time to turn loose here but we want to Worship the Lord we want to just allow the Holy Spirit just to water that word in taking in the word that God is is has spoken and as we as we're taking in that word you know we're worshiping as the word even is coming forth but even a as From This Moment On even as we go from this place even in prayer our worship is is Lord make that more of a substance within my life I I I just don't want it to be something that I consider but I want it to be that which regulates all other things because remember brother Jerry I don't know if it wasn't last week or it might have been the week before I don't know when he was preaching on that Thursday but we he read that statement all of our thoughts are to be based on thus sayeth the Lord that's the truth so you know what reject our thoughts we take God's thoughts amen and God's thoughts letting them have preeminence in our life than it brings forth amen I believe God has equipped us to pray over these things amen and ask God for these things to be made even more real in our lives amen that's that's our prayer amen you love him tonight amen amen let's sing that song now I see myself as my father does and now I see myself like my father does I'm not of the darkness thank you Lord like I was for he changed me came in no longer in the night I'm a child of the life I've been born again oh stumbling Al alone in the darkness I was looking for a light to
