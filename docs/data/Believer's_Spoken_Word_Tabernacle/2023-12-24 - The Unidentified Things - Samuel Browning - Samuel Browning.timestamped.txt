[33:22] gathered together here on this Christmas
[33:24] Eve and um just so thankful to be in the
[33:28] house of the Lord and amen be gathered
[33:31] together I know we had um we do have
[33:33] many that uh are traveling and certainly
[33:37] just ask the Lord just be merciful with
[33:39] them to them and others that maybe are
[33:42] not feeling well
[33:44] and we want to continue to remember
[33:48] Sister Ruth Hoyer in prayer the Lord
[33:51] will just continue to move for our
[33:52] sister in a special way and uh just like
[33:57] we hear we heard here with um the
[34:00] testimony there of sister Judith that
[34:02] she gave Lord um you know I remember
[34:07] there's been times and there's Witnesses
[34:09] standing in the congregation where
[34:10] there's things that you could look at by
[34:13] a report and say well you know the
[34:15] doctors were just guessing on that and
[34:17] they got that wrong right I mean you can
[34:20] chw you can choose that but doctors have
[34:24] seen things many times
[34:27] oh yes and they're trained to Go by
[34:29] sight and what you tell them that's
[34:31] right that's that's how their training
[34:34] is and so when they make that that
[34:41] declaration and then to see how God has
[34:44] moved on the scene for that to
[34:48] dismiss that there's any cancer
[34:51] there there's another situation sitting
[34:54] right here in this congregation sister
[34:56] Amanda one time went in for they had
[34:59] called her they G they gave a scan and
[35:02] you remember this where I had to I
[35:03] called and I went over there and met you
[35:05] and brother Aaron over there in in
[35:06] Lakewood from here we met over there now
[35:11] the difference here it showed on one
[35:13] scan this one
[35:15] thing it showed it right but after they
[35:19] did another test when we got over there
[35:23] nothing that's right yes sir so to me
[35:28] it's
[35:30] [Applause]
[35:35] God I'm a witness I've seen him do you
[35:38] have to You' seen him do the
[35:40] miraculous and in every every part of
[35:43] healing no matter what aspect it comes
[35:44] it's miraculous but I think just in
[35:46] times like that that even in reports we
[35:50] can say oh that was just maybe the
[35:51] mistake or no no that was just the
[35:55] Lord his Mercy amen that's what it was
[35:58] and I i' always want to be found giving
[36:01] him glory for that cuz he's worthy yes
[36:04] sir amen amen certainly we are so
[36:08] grateful for that so I I say that in
[36:10] Remembering sister Ruth hoer in prayer I
[36:13] I know there's others around the world
[36:16] that are dealing with cancer I didn't uh
[36:19] get a chance a few weeks
[36:22] back brother Paul Le Fontaine had had
[36:25] text me uh right after after they had
[36:27] got the the news with sister Sharon Van
[36:29] wink and she's completely cancer free
[36:33] wow
[36:37] so and uh that was that was from a few
[36:41] weeks back when they came out of the
[36:43] doctor so we we thank the Lord for his
[36:47] Mercy I I text Brother Paul back I said
[36:50] I feel a song
[36:53] coming I said every Psalm and every song
[36:57] comes from experience oh yes it does I
[37:00] told him I said I just can't wait to
[37:01] hear the one that comes out of this one
[37:03] y I said cuz she's already been singing
[37:05] it all these
[37:08] months amen so we just thank the Lord
[37:10] for thaten so glad to have uh I think is
[37:15] sister Michelle is it Denise am I am I

[37:36] service thank
[37:41] you real quick couple announcements here
[37:44] before we jump right into the the word
[37:46] of the Lord this morning just remember
[37:49] um the email we sent out in the
[37:51] announcement on Thursday of the event on
[37:53] December 30th that brother joshu is
[37:56] hosting uh it's there just to kind of
[38:00] have a time to be able to kind of
[38:03] informally um you know meet and I sister
[38:06] Sharon I I want to say I just so
[38:08] appreciate as I've watched U different
[38:10] ones even my brother-in-law he he took a
[38:13] stab at it he he he came and greeted her
[38:15] in
[38:18] French now you know sometimes when you
[38:21] you all know how it is I'm speaking to
[38:23] Spanish people or they're Puerto Rican
[38:25] or Mexican sometimes you you get
[38:26] individuals that they come and greet you
[38:29] and you're like this is a this is an
[38:32] English tur trying to speak
[38:36] Spanish you know it's like it's like
[38:39] trying
[38:40] to give me uh generic inside of the
[38:44] actual Mountain Dew
[38:46] can but we appreciate that those things
[38:48] me mean so much uh I think of even when
[38:53] uh when John F Kennedy stood there when
[38:56] he greeted at the Germans when he stood
[38:57] on that wall his first words were in
[39:00] German y that's an icebreaker there

[39:07] just kind of carnal well the scripture
[39:10] calls our name and the prophet tells us
[39:12] from Revelations 1 he said there's
[39:14] nothing more precious than someone to
[39:17] hear their name being called oh yeah so

[49:51] Lord I I just give myself to you that
[49:54] may you take full control control in
[49:56] this service in Jesus
[49:59] name amen and
[50:01] amen amen I want to go to
[50:04] Micah
[50:06] um I believe it's
[50:08] chapter
[50:12] five and
[50:20] um Micah CH 5 and verse 2 just one verse
[50:23] of scripture from here and
[50:31] uh I actually was going to thought I was
[50:34] going to go to a different way is what I
[50:36] had projected is to go and take a
[50:39] different portion out of the scripture
[50:41] but the Holy Spirit just seemed to
[50:43] continue to press on just another part
[50:46] in it so maybe we'll get the next part
[50:49] next
[50:50] year you can preach at any time of the
[50:52] year that's right uh it does doesn't
[50:55] matter any time of the
[50:57] year Micah 5 verse two but thou
[51:02] Bethlehem
[51:04] ephata though thou be little among the
[51:08] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[51:13] he come forth unto me that is to be
[51:17] ruler in Israel Lord whose goings forth
[51:22] have been from old and from Everlasting
[51:25] so good amen may God bless you and bless
[51:28] the reading of the word as you're being
[51:30] seated I apologize to you that
[51:33] we even though I have all the slides and
[51:36] everything prepared but uh there was a
[51:38] little breakdown there with um you know
[51:41] how with technology it wasn't so much
[51:43] the technology but it's with uh when
[51:45] things um are to be come do and things
[51:48] like that and brother Brian just I was
[51:50] texting him today I said hey I I'm not
[51:52] able to shoot my notes over there and he
[51:54] said ah he went in and looked at it ah
[51:57] we got to update the the the the the
[51:59] credit card
[52:01] information
[52:03] so maybe that's just uh maybe that's
[52:06] just sparing
[52:08] us but um I pray that God will just help
[52:11] me I always pray this as Lord will help
[52:13] me just communicate and get out of the
[52:15] way the thought that he wants to say and
[52:17] that he'll just have Liberty to take it
[52:19] to our hearts just how it needs to be
[52:22] amen so um I just thinking of this from
[52:27] the portion here and I couldn't get away
[52:29] from that thought from the little things
[52:32] and I want to just speak here on a title
[52:35] on the
[52:38] unidentified things the
[52:42] unidentified
[52:43] things I want you to listen how brother
[52:45] Bram takes this and why little
[52:48] Bethlehem he says when we think of how
[52:51] God does things in unusual ways because
[52:55] he is
[52:56] unusual
[52:58] himself God is unusual he's the
[53:02] supernatural the finite unto we who are
[53:05] finite so anything he does is in its
[53:09] scope unusual and God is so great till
[53:13] he takes the
[53:14] unidentified things of the earth to
[53:18] identify himself by it so God takes the
[53:23] unidentified things right of the earth
[53:27] to identify himself by it now think
[53:31] about this in the scriptures in 1
[53:33] Corinthians chap 1 verse
[53:37] 25 it says because the foolishness of
[53:40] God is wiser than man and the weakness
[53:44] of God is stronger than men for you see
[53:49] your calling Brethren how that not many
[53:52] wise men after the flesh not many
[53:55] Mighty not many noble are called now
[53:59] Paul didn't say there wasn't any that
[54:02] was mighty that he just said there were
[54:05] very
[54:06] few this is why even when Jesus would
[54:09] say it it's easier for the camel to go
[54:12] through the eye of the needle than for a
[54:14] rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
[54:16] Heaven that's good he didn't say it was
[54:18] impossible but he's liking it to where
[54:21] that eye of a needle is where one
[54:24] packing Goods with a camel they would
[54:26] have to unpack that Camel all the goods
[54:29] off of it and that Camel would have to
[54:31] get down on its knees and they would
[54:33] have to guide it through that little
[54:36] place in the wall that's good so it's
[54:40] very very few that will humble
[54:43] themselves because they're trusting in
[54:45] their riches now I just say it like this
[54:47] you you know a person might be the
[54:49] poorest person there could be maybe
[54:52] they're not poor maybe they're mediocre
[54:55] or whatever it would be but you know
[54:57] whatever it comes down to that if we can
[55:00] really see God for who he is and what
[55:03] he's done for us and when we think of
[55:05] this in the time of a Christmas season
[55:08] Paul mentioned it already we recognize
[55:10] he he wasn't a lamb wasn't Lambs are not
[55:13] born in this time but yet we take the
[55:16] opportunity the world does all of their
[55:18] things but we take the opportunity to
[55:21] announce what this is really all about
[55:24] that we who were born in sin shaped in
[55:28] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[55:32] but God himself knowing knowing we there
[55:35] was a way back we needed a way back
[55:38] that's right we needed saving amen we
[55:42] needed delivering and no man was able to
[55:46] save himself no man was able to deliver
[55:49] himself but God the only way it could
[55:52] come is by God himself self becoming one
[55:57] of
[55:59] us and I want you to think of this and
[56:02] just even in these simplest
[56:04] terms God came and he made himself known
[56:08] down through the scriptures he would
[56:10] come to
[56:12] Abraham and he would make himself known
[56:14] to Abraham there reveal himself as
[56:17] mdic the great king and priest of the
[56:22] most high God yeah then he would make
[56:25] him then he would once again come before
[56:28] Abraham in Genesis 18 and he would
[56:31] reveal himself knowing it was it was
[56:34] more than a man that was standing before
[56:37] the tent door of Abraham because then
[56:40] even where when Sarah would laugh in her
[56:43] heart the Bible said that he could stand
[56:47] there and say why did Sarah laugh in her
[56:50] heart and he would call her Sarah he
[56:53] didn't have to ask Abraham what's her
[56:55] name so here God had come down and had
[57:01] shown and actually in that part of it
[57:04] God was making known even a type of how
[57:08] that God himself would come in
[57:11] visitation in the last days as he
[57:15] promised before the Gentiles days are
[57:18] finished is that right when Jesus said
[57:22] Abraham saw my day Jesus here standing
[57:26] here Abraham saw my day and he rejoiced
[57:29] to see it what did Abraham saw what did
[57:33] he see he saw God in flesh before him
[57:38] that's that's God's day that's light
[57:42] that's this is where when we understand
[57:45] this of how that when we come back to a
[57:47] place of a question I'd like to just
[57:49] pose and to and to drop to you and maybe
[57:52] we'll pick it up here in a moment but to
[57:55] understand why was it so emphatic in the
[57:57] scripture where it says Behold a virgin
[58:00] shall conceive and shall bear a child
[58:05] bear a son and shall call his name
[58:08] Emmanuel this being interpreted God With
[58:12] Us why would it have to be a
[58:16] virgin why would it have to be a babe
[58:19] that was
[58:20] born why couldn't God step down as he
[58:24] had at other times and just made himself
[58:27] known as he did to Abraham and on
[58:29] through the scriptures in many different
[58:32] ways the purpose of this was for
[58:36] Redemption hallu because there had been
[58:39] a fall take place in
[58:42] Eden but now God notied not taking
[58:46] anything of the woman but God created
[58:50] not only that of the egg but sperm also
[58:53] it was God who created his own body to
[58:57] come and dwell in true it could not be
[59:00] blood that was already here it had to be
[59:03] innocent blood yeah it had to be one who
[59:06] would come and live as you and I live
[59:09] live under all the Temptations live
[59:13] under all of those things in order to be
[59:16] able to stand there and be
[59:18] declared as pilot and as Herod Herod
[59:21] could say I find no fault in him he was
[59:24] the perfect Lamb of God all testified of
[59:29] it right the Bible said tempted in all
[59:32] points yet without
[59:34] sin and he went and he paid the price
[59:37] for you and I shed his blood that then
[59:41] through that price that Ransom being
[59:44] paid that then he calls to us come a
[59:49] liberty that you and I might come to a
[59:51] full reality in him to a to a real to
[59:55] what what an longing that would be
[59:57] within the heart of an individual a
[1:00:00] longing that would satisfy all that they
[1:00:03] have been searching for see God made man
[1:00:06] to
[1:00:08] thirst many times how the enemy will try
[1:00:10] to satisfy that thirst with many things
[1:00:13] even thirst of things that are are
[1:00:16] permissible but yet how Satan wants to
[1:00:19] get in and pervert them in so many
[1:00:21] different ways but God is the satisfier
[1:00:25] when when a man or woman when a person
[1:00:28] meets God and they really meet God in
[1:00:32] the in that reality of who he is what he
[1:00:34] has done for them it brings a
[1:00:37] satisfaction to their
[1:00:39] life there is a there is a
[1:00:43] satisfaction Oh I thought something was
[1:00:45] going off here I usually don't have my
[1:00:48] phone up here anymore but sometimes you
[1:00:49] know you get those weather
[1:00:51] alerts that's not what it was
[1:00:55] uh the enemy just want to distract
[1:00:58] me I'll mill on a different pathway
[1:01:01] we'll get
[1:01:02] there but the ultimate is what God
[1:01:05] desired to do for you and I and I want
[1:01:09] you to think of this in verse 27 but God
[1:01:12] hath
[1:01:13] chosen the foolish things of the world
[1:01:17] to confound the wise and God hath chosen
[1:01:22] the weak things of the world to confound
[1:01:25] the things which are
[1:01:28] Mighty and base things of the world and
[1:01:31] things which are despised hath God
[1:01:34] Chosen and the things which are
[1:01:37] not
[1:01:39] unidentified to bring to not those
[1:01:41] things that are that no flesh should
[1:01:45] glory in his
[1:01:47] presence you know something that's
[1:01:50] identified it it simply means it's not
[1:01:53] recognized
[1:01:54] or it's not
[1:01:56] identified it's not
[1:01:58] known very interesting even as I hear
[1:02:02] the prophet take this and then I begin
[1:02:04] to go back and just looking over this
[1:02:07] when God divided think of this for a
[1:02:09] moment when God divided the inheritance
[1:02:12] among the children of Israel remember
[1:02:15] that every one of those 12 Patriarchs
[1:02:18] when they were being born the
[1:02:20] inspiration of the Holy Spirit would
[1:02:22] move upon them and they would utter out
[1:02:25] the name of that child that was being
[1:02:28] born and within that name held the
[1:02:31] mystery of their position in the
[1:02:34] promised
[1:02:36] land now God God remember when Israel
[1:02:40] went into bondage now God came to bring
[1:02:43] them out of Egypt and to bring them back
[1:02:47] into their promised land and when they
[1:02:50] came there he lets Joshua know you are
[1:02:54] called called to divide to the children
[1:02:56] of Israel their
[1:02:58] inheritance but Joshua was going to have
[1:03:01] to come under the same
[1:03:03] inspiration let me say it like this the
[1:03:06] inspiration of the Original Seed it
[1:03:10] would have to be the original
[1:03:13] inspiration he would have to enter into
[1:03:16] that channel that moved down upon those
[1:03:19] mothers and when Joshua would speak then
[1:03:22] here you find that this tribe would
[1:03:25] receive all the villages towns cities
[1:03:29] provinces that pertain to them that's so
[1:03:33] but in Joshua chapter 15 where it speaks
[1:03:37] of the inheritance of the tribe of
[1:03:40] Judah Bethlehem is of Judah but there's
[1:03:45] not one mention of Bethlehem in that
[1:03:49] chapter that's right now you say why
[1:03:52] would God do that why would God
[1:03:55] purposely do that because at that time
[1:03:58] it was not a significant a significant
[1:04:01] place but God chooses listen to me now
[1:04:05] that's God's
[1:04:06] ways God chooses to hide himself in the
[1:04:10] things right right in the midst under
[1:04:14] the nose and right there even in his own
[1:04:17] word hallelu think about it what has
[1:04:20] been stumbled at and staggered at for
[1:04:22] years it was lost the mystery of the
[1:04:27] baptism Hallelujah of water baptism in
[1:04:30] the name of Jesus Christ men could look
[1:04:33] at it sure we had those that broke into
[1:04:36] the Trinity which is titles that's title
[1:04:39] is not a
[1:04:40] name then we had those that broke over
[1:04:43] into the Oneness and that's not correct
[1:04:45] either it's not it's not if it's not
[1:04:48] even correct just to say just Jesus
[1:04:51] because there's many many of you know
[1:04:53] that here especially from different
[1:04:55] cultures and things like that there
[1:04:56] would be many of name Jesus or
[1:04:58] Jesus right it's very common outside of
[1:05:01] a lot of times our our culture and
[1:05:02] everything else but you see this is
[1:05:05] where that Peter said he hath made the
[1:05:07] same Jesus both Lord and Christ and
[1:05:10] other words this is almighty God come
[1:05:13] down in Redemption that's so good and
[1:05:16] Jesus said I have power to may lay my
[1:05:19] life down and power to take it up again
[1:05:21] no man had ever been able to declare
[1:05:24] that before that's right but he had
[1:05:26] within him that same power that was
[1:05:29] residing in there who was it it was none
[1:05:31] other than almighty God walking right
[1:05:35] here among us
[1:05:41] Emmanuel a place this this to me just so
[1:05:44] struck me it it really just really sent
[1:05:47] me in a and just um just I I don't know
[1:05:50] I would really just went off in those
[1:05:51] trajectories with that cuz we could
[1:05:53] really preach this but I want to just
[1:05:55] stay within that confines of how if
[1:05:57] you'll notice many of us have heard this
[1:06:00] statement before you know you drive into
[1:06:03] a town or a city and uh I remember when
[1:06:06] we would when we lived in sanduski you
[1:06:08] would enter in there when you come into
[1:06:10] the city limits they would say
[1:06:11] Corporation limits and they would have a
[1:06:13] sign and that sign many times some of
[1:06:16] those different signs would say uh so
[1:06:18] and so won the State title I remember
[1:06:20] for sanduski so and so won the State
[1:06:21] title in a wrestling way back win and so
[1:06:23] forth and there was always certain
[1:06:25] things about it now you know they've got
[1:06:26] it from when and sanduski it's uh uh you
[1:06:29] know they a lot of things you know
[1:06:31] Orlando oace played here and they've got
[1:06:33] streets named after and everything else
[1:06:35] you know so what I'm just trying to say
[1:06:38] we've heard the phrase uh boy they put
[1:06:40] that place on the
[1:06:42] map now nobody listen to me nobody and I
[1:06:46] don't know who you would who draws out
[1:06:48] of Lorraine or Sheffield or what I'm
[1:06:50] sorry I haven't maybe maybe they don't
[1:06:51] have maybe there's no I know there's
[1:06:53] people that's come out out of here but
[1:06:55] you no understand what I'm saying that
[1:06:56] sometimes when there there's a part of
[1:06:58] it that you know many times when people
[1:06:59] want to know where are you at where uh
[1:07:02] the church where is Sheffield exactly at
[1:07:04] and I'll say
[1:07:07] Cleveland no I'll say
[1:07:10] Cleveland I do that's an easy checkpoint
[1:07:13] cuz if I say lorine many people don't
[1:07:15] know they don't they don't they can't
[1:07:16] relate to that if I don't say Cleveland
[1:07:18] if I say Cleveland they say well you
[1:07:20] know
[1:07:21] Cleveland I don't have to many to do
[1:07:23] that but sometimes you know I'll say Hey
[1:07:25] you know especially if young people I
[1:07:26] say you know where sanduski at you know
[1:07:28] you ever heard of Cedar Point you ever
[1:07:28] heard of Cedar Point they'll say yeah
[1:07:30] yeah I heard of that well okay so here's
[1:07:31] where we're at in proximity you see it's
[1:07:33] something that gives you a point of
[1:07:34] reference and so you've heard that
[1:07:36] phrase we've heard that phrase man that
[1:07:38] put that city on the map or that put
[1:07:40] that town on the map or that put that
[1:07:41] place on the map I want to just say it
[1:07:44] like this when we notice that within
[1:07:46] this how that Bethlehem was not even
[1:07:50] mentioned in the inheritance of Judah
[1:07:54] but it was there the whole
[1:07:57] time and here think of this think of it
[1:08:00] of even how that Micah under
[1:08:03] inspiration as a prophet of God would
[1:08:07] utter these things and announc this in
[1:08:11] that time of where the Messiah was to be
[1:08:16] born even even when they came there
[1:08:20] remember the Wise Men followed that star
[1:08:22] for a period of
[1:08:24] years we understand it's not like the
[1:08:27] nativity scenes we see with wise men
[1:08:29] here and Shepherds those are two
[1:08:30] different
[1:08:32] events you recognize when the when the
[1:08:34] wise men arrived there finally as they
[1:08:37] made their way the Bible said there was
[1:08:39] the child with his mother not
[1:08:42] baby and furthermore when they returned
[1:08:46] knowing that Herod intended evil Herod
[1:08:50] had already asked them when did you
[1:08:53] first see this
[1:08:55] star he would know the time frame this
[1:08:59] is why the Bible said after that that
[1:09:01] Herod when he seen he was mocked of the
[1:09:03] wise men sent and he gave orders
[1:09:07] Slaughter all of those from two years
[1:09:09] old and
[1:09:11] down wow see these these things in the
[1:09:14] scriptures are unidentified things but
[1:09:17] once the Holy Spirit identifies them we
[1:09:22] we see the repacement of them oh now I
[1:09:26] see that it's the same thing as we were
[1:09:28] saying with water baptism in the name of
[1:09:31] the Lord Jesus Christ once that has been
[1:09:34] revealed and we know the prophet said
[1:09:36] you really don't need a revelation for
[1:09:38] that cuz it's written in the word and we
[1:09:40] know in this age of great oh
[1:09:42] intelligence and intellect and wisdom
[1:09:44] and and wisdom and all but you know the
[1:09:46] Bible says that God he Delights in
[1:09:49] bringing the wisdom of man to
[1:09:52] not and it's what man calls great God
[1:09:56] calls
[1:09:59] foolish man at one time made a ship and
[1:10:02] they announced it's
[1:10:06] Unsinkable and no doubt it was a very
[1:10:08] well-made
[1:10:11] ship but God let us let it be known
[1:10:14] there is nothing that is certain outside
[1:10:18] of the word of God once again nothing
[1:10:21] there is no place of safety outside of
[1:10:25] Jesus Christ there's no bomb shelter
[1:10:27] there's nothing that is more safe than
[1:10:30] abiding under the shadow of the almighty
[1:10:36] God and at one time this nation Abode
[1:10:39] under it but it's rejected
[1:10:43] it true it rejected her day of
[1:10:45] visitation but I want you to think of it
[1:10:47] in this way this
[1:10:51] place here if it became
[1:10:55] founded by a man named
[1:10:58] salmone salmone marries you could look
[1:11:01] in Ruth you can look in the beginning of
[1:11:02] Matthew chapter 1 salmone marries
[1:11:07] Rahab now I want you to remember who
[1:11:09] Rahab is the Bible tells us it'll it'll
[1:11:13] even include it in Hebrews 11 Rahab the
[1:11:16] Harlot why would it also include that in
[1:11:19] there in Hebrews 11 if she had already
[1:11:22] been forgiven given been delivered of
[1:11:25] that kind of a lifestyle God would
[1:11:27] include that in there for you and I that
[1:11:29] you and I could see the depth of God's
[1:11:31] grace and to know there's no situation
[1:11:34] Beyond Redemption Hallelujah and here
[1:11:38] was Rahab in a city called Jericho in
[1:11:43] line of
[1:11:47] judgment but she
[1:11:49] heard she began to hear the acts of God
[1:11:53] right she was an
[1:11:55] unidentified daughter of
[1:11:58] God but the word of God begin to come
[1:12:01] and begin to stir up that which was
[1:12:05] unidentified hallah a word where God was
[1:12:08] identifying himself that he's the same
[1:12:11] God he's the Living God he's the god
[1:12:13] that keeps his word it begin to move in
[1:12:15] her heart to where when she Reed these
[1:12:18] two spies into her dwelling place and
[1:12:21] she received a word right of Deliverance
[1:12:25] she received a
[1:12:27] word that brought an identification to
[1:12:30] her
[1:12:31] life she was
[1:12:33] unidentified perhaps you and I can
[1:12:36] relate to that wandering about through
[1:12:39] this world bumping into this bumping
[1:12:41] into that trying to fit in here trying
[1:12:43] to satisfy there trying you see there's
[1:12:45] a
[1:12:46] longing there's a part unidentified but
[1:12:49] only God can identify the unidentified
[1:12:53] ifed
[1:12:54] part it takes qu to bring that forth
[1:12:58] something that seems so small and so
[1:13:01] insignificant but yet God himself would
[1:13:04] bring that together I'm not going to be
[1:13:06] much
[1:13:07] longer but to think of how that I like
[1:13:10] how brother Brandon place he says when
[1:13:12] Salmon moved in there he said no doubt
[1:13:15] it might have just been maybe couple
[1:13:18] houses couple places this is what I'm
[1:13:21] this is what to me it just draws upon my
[1:13:23] heart of how that Simone and Rahab come
[1:13:27] into this place of Bethlehem a place
[1:13:30] that is not even known but when there
[1:13:33] has come a uniting between salmone and
[1:13:37] Rahab then everything right in there it
[1:13:41] starts to prosper as they come into
[1:13:43] their position let me say this to you
[1:13:45] there's only one way for the word to
[1:13:48] become in power there's only one way for
[1:13:52] the word to move move and to grow and to
[1:13:55] become what God intended for it to be
[1:13:57] and that's to be United with Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ in a born again experience and
[1:14:03] come into
[1:14:06] Bethlehem Hallelujah a place that might
[1:14:09] seem so
[1:14:11] insignificant
[1:14:12] unidentified but yet it's God's ordained
[1:14:16] place for your life to flourish yes it
[1:14:22] is
[1:14:24] prise the Lord though thou be little
[1:14:28] that scripture we read in the opening
[1:14:30] though thou be
[1:14:32] little in the New Testament it says the
[1:14:35] least among the princes same meaning
[1:14:38] little the word little here means
[1:14:40] insignificant young small in other words
[1:14:44] something that can be
[1:14:47] overlooked I want to remind you when
[1:14:49] Samuel was ordained by God to go and to
[1:14:55] choose a king for the
[1:14:58] Lord now listen to my words when he was
[1:15:01] ordained by God to choose a king for the
[1:15:07] Lord you
[1:15:09] see some years prior to that the people
[1:15:12] wanted a
[1:15:14] king they wanted a king that would fit
[1:15:17] their
[1:15:19] stature and they chose a man who was
[1:15:22] Head and Shoulder Above the Rest that's
[1:15:25] good and when they first chose Saul this
[1:15:28] was Saul's response who am
[1:15:31] I I'm the least my family is the least
[1:15:35] even Among The Tribe of Benjamin not
[1:15:37] only am I the least in my family but my
[1:15:39] family's the least if he would have only
[1:15:42] kept that
[1:15:45] attitude if he only would have kept that
[1:15:48] he'd have been all right but when Saul
[1:15:49] be to feel
[1:15:51] like he had authority to to do this he
[1:15:54] could do this well if this one working
[1:15:56] right God understands I'll just offer
[1:15:58] this up for Samuel he had you see what
[1:16:00] happened he failed to respect simple
[1:16:04] obedience to the word amen and you and I
[1:16:08] will get off track shes the world when
[1:16:10] you begin to make excuses or reasoning
[1:16:13] for simple obedience to the word that's
[1:16:16] already been written that's you see that
[1:16:19] word is already written it's not
[1:16:22] unidentified there is identified
[1:16:24] scriptures right before
[1:16:26] us we know we're living in a time in an
[1:16:29] hour where there's things that have been
[1:16:32] unidentified reserved to this
[1:16:35] hour is that right in Revelations 10
[1:16:39] when it said the mighty Angel descend he
[1:16:42] began to cry out and when he cried out
[1:16:44] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:16:46] seven being completion Thunders being
[1:16:49] the voice of God the authority that's
[1:16:51] what it's speaking of right and then
[1:16:53] John began to write he wanted to write
[1:16:55] what was being
[1:16:58] said but the spirit said if forbid him
[1:17:01] not to write it right why because as the
[1:17:06] prophet would direct us back it's
[1:17:08] already
[1:17:09] there now that's what caused some to go
[1:17:13] off and take the seven Thunders and put
[1:17:15] it as the Seven Virtues but that's a
[1:17:18] misunderstanding because he said write
[1:17:20] it not it would be the revelation of
[1:17:23] what is already
[1:17:28] wrote is that
[1:17:30] right so here it would be taking things
[1:17:34] that were unidentified let me give you
[1:17:35] an
[1:17:36] example when before this time do you
[1:17:40] find an identification brought for when
[1:17:43] Sarah and Abraham made their
[1:17:47] Journey after the meeting in Genesis 18
[1:17:50] and the King takes Sarah for
[1:17:55] wife when do you find an identification
[1:17:58] being spoken because the Bible says Not
[1:18:01] only was Sarah's womb Barren but the
[1:18:04] Bible tells us that Abraham's stream of
[1:18:07] life in other words no more no more
[1:18:09] coming to any other beding ground his
[1:18:11] stream of life was dried
[1:18:14] up that's good right and God sees this
[1:18:18] this is
[1:18:19] unidentified but in this hour in an hour
[1:18:22] where requires rapturing Grace and
[1:18:25] rapturing Faith God can reach back in
[1:18:28] the things that's unidentified and show
[1:18:30] you and I in order for them to have a
[1:18:33] child there had to come a change to
[1:18:36] receive the promised son and God reached
[1:18:39] to the unidentified things and he
[1:18:41] identified them in this hour and said
[1:18:44] that's what took place there and this is
[1:18:47] your message and your
[1:18:51] day pulling the identified things and
[1:18:54] identifying them in other words making
[1:18:56] them plain making them clear because
[1:18:59] this is the
[1:19:01] day where Zachariah caught and spoke
[1:19:06] of where small things are
[1:19:10] despised ah that don't matter to God
[1:19:12] anymore let me every word matters to God
[1:19:16] every word matters to God and let me
[1:19:18] just say this exactly as the prophet
[1:19:20] said you're not any stronger
[1:19:24] than your knowledge and adherence to the
[1:19:27] pure word of
[1:19:28] God so if there's one word of God that
[1:19:31] you choose not to
[1:19:34] obey your strength is
[1:19:38] broken right you understand me that's
[1:19:41] true this is these are this this is
[1:19:44] God's desire to help you and I to
[1:19:47] minister to you and yet it's Satan's
[1:19:49] desire to try to take and disqualify and
[1:19:53] water down and pull down well God didn't
[1:19:55] mean that and this really don't matter
[1:19:56] and this let me just tell you the
[1:19:58] greatest greatest deception is the voice
[1:20:00] of
[1:20:01] reasoning right if there's anything
[1:20:05] listen your reasoning if it reasons
[1:20:08] outside of the word of God forsake it
[1:20:11] amen if there's any reason let me just
[1:20:13] give you a simple one that's wrote right
[1:20:15] here the Bible said not for not to
[1:20:17] forsake to assemble ourselves together
[1:20:19] that's in the word of
[1:20:21] God there's a lot goes with that a lot
[1:20:23] of sacrifice that goes with that to be a
[1:20:26] part of the local body it's a lot of
[1:20:28] sacrifice cuz we got to sacrifice deal
[1:20:30] with opinions of one another being
[1:20:33] rubbed by one it requires sacrifice
[1:20:35] that's why many people say I don't want
[1:20:36] to be a part of a local body I to stay
[1:20:39] at home because it requires a sacrifice
[1:20:42] a marriage requires a
[1:20:44] sacrifice is that right but see even in
[1:20:48] the things like that well you know it's
[1:20:50] not really it's not that important that
[1:20:51] really doesn't matter but it's you see
[1:20:53] it does matter the ABCs of things matter
[1:20:58] where the things that were even
[1:21:00] identified in this hour have been laid
[1:21:03] in the scripture of clothing of dress of
[1:21:06] how we're to wear it's laid in the
[1:21:07] scripture it's not a mystery it's not
[1:21:10] something that was
[1:21:12] unidentified but yet you see what
[1:21:14] happens when Satan comes along he takes
[1:21:17] things that are already laying here
[1:21:19] identified and he wants to put a veil
[1:21:21] over it to make it obscure but God comes
[1:21:25] along and shows us that he's still the
[1:21:28] same and he is the word and that every
[1:21:32] word is just as effectual and in and
[1:21:36] significant as it always have been is
[1:21:39] that right oh my see God has a way of
[1:21:43] bringing significance to things remember
[1:21:45] the little story of the
[1:21:48] violin nobody wanted to bid on it in the
[1:21:50] auction it was laying up there who give
[1:21:53] me a dollar chirp chirp chirp ch ch ch
[1:22:01] ch you know the
[1:22:03] story very simple but this is how God
[1:22:08] identifies the
[1:22:10] unidentified when he took a hold of that
[1:22:13] violin a master walked up and that
[1:22:16] auction and he took that violin and he
[1:22:19] began to play it and as he begin to play
[1:22:22] it
[1:22:24] Amazing
[1:22:25] Grace wasn't a dry eye
[1:22:28] in the place the value was immediately
[1:22:34] raised what raised the value what was
[1:22:38] once
[1:22:39] unidentified has now become
[1:22:42] identified what was once seen to be that
[1:22:46] doesn't really matter that's of no value
[1:22:48] but when God comes on the scene we begin
[1:22:51] to see the value you of these things you
[1:22:53] see friend this is where even with
[1:22:56] things that God asked of you and I to do
[1:22:58] and listen sometimes the things that God
[1:23:00] is requiring is not so much a matter of
[1:23:03] salvation but if you can see you and I
[1:23:06] can see the value that's
[1:23:09] pre God let me see the value that's good
[1:23:13] preacher the value yes because remember
[1:23:17] what you might say is only
[1:23:20] $5 somebody else can come by and say
[1:23:23] that's a Victorian piece of furniture
[1:23:26] yeah that's right that's
[1:23:28] original that's worth more than $5
[1:23:31] absolutely remember the little boy right
[1:23:33] you see his desires I just want an ice
[1:23:36] cream cone right he found a stamp in a
[1:23:39] collection man if I can just take this
[1:23:42] stamp I can get me a probably get me an
[1:23:43] ice cream cone that's the only s thing
[1:23:47] he saw on that stamp yeah and when he
[1:23:51] took it to the dealer goes down the
[1:23:54] street takes it out there and the dealer
[1:23:56] looks at it and knows this is worth a
[1:23:59] lot of money so to a little boy little
[1:24:03] understanding I give you $5 for it the
[1:24:06] little boy
[1:24:08] sayso how many ice cream cones not at
[1:24:10] the ice cream truck cuz them rip off how
[1:24:12] many ice cream
[1:24:14] cones at a real ice cream place not the
[1:24:17] you know the what they call the jingle
[1:24:19] jip you know come to rob you little
[1:24:22] trucks that drive through the
[1:24:24] neighborhood no no man $5 I can get a
[1:24:27] lot you see somebody was there who knew
[1:24:31] what the value was but they did not
[1:24:34] reveal to him what the value was and let
[1:24:37] me say this to you this of the word of
[1:24:40] God this word oh there's been things
[1:24:42] that can be look at God's A Healer
[1:24:44] praise God God's a deliverer praise God
[1:24:47] but it took God coming to reveal the
[1:24:50] value of what you
[1:24:54] have it's more than just
[1:24:57] religion it's more than just salvation
[1:25:01] it's more than just healing it's more
[1:25:04] than just to make you a better person
[1:25:07] the Holy Spirit comes to make you a new
[1:25:10] creation and release the value that God
[1:25:15] has always saw in your life you're worth
[1:25:17] more than an ice cream
[1:25:20] cone Hallelujah you're worth more than
[1:25:23] any pleasure of the world that the enemy
[1:25:25] would want to try to snatch you up
[1:25:27] there's so much more of God Amen listen
[1:25:31] to me there's more so much more than
[1:25:36] just knowing him as your savior I think
[1:25:38] that's a wonderful place to start if you
[1:25:40] don't know him as your savior start
[1:25:42] there am right you got to start
[1:25:44] somewhere we all started there it starts
[1:25:47] with repentance to recognize the god
[1:25:49] who's speaking to your heart dealing
[1:25:50] with your life that it's not man it's
[1:25:52] God but then from that place recognize
[1:25:56] that that that God who's brought that
[1:25:58] conviction in my life that which I've
[1:25:59] been loging
[1:26:02] for I want to know
[1:26:06] him I want to meet that God who
[1:26:10] brings the real peace yes that passes
[1:26:14] all understanding that's
[1:26:17] right see God has a way of bringing
[1:26:20] value yes
[1:26:23] as he identifies the unidentified
[1:26:26] things it's like a lot of times the
[1:26:28] Precious Minerals are ore that's in the
[1:26:32] ground you know a lot of times they
[1:26:35] don't know what's
[1:26:38] there in this day and age it's not that
[1:26:41] they don't know what's
[1:26:43] there he said no we don't want to do it
[1:26:45] here let's let China send it to
[1:26:48] us I'm I'm not going to get political
[1:26:51] you can see the Insanity of
[1:26:55] things that's right but the things that
[1:26:58] have laid here you know the Bible said
[1:26:59] the Earth is the Lords and the fullness
[1:27:02] thereof that's it already belongs to
[1:27:05] God God has provided even in the
[1:27:10] creation of the
[1:27:12] Earth the gold was laid
[1:27:15] in all the different precious ores and
[1:27:19] minerals what was needed to eat even
[1:27:22] come together to
[1:27:25] make even those things where we look at
[1:27:28] with coal and all all those Precious
[1:27:30] Minerals and or but notice how many men
[1:27:35] how many people walked over some of
[1:27:38] those
[1:27:39] places like in Kentucky where there's
[1:27:41] oil like in Texas how many times listen
[1:27:45] even over there in Saudi Arabia they're
[1:27:47] not the ones who developed that in those
[1:27:50] Arab countries that was us that's right
[1:27:54] that was us who developed that that's
[1:27:56] right that's us who did that that's
[1:27:58] right and to understand listen this is
[1:28:00] what I'm trying to say to you let's stay
[1:28:02] in the spiritual realm here I'm just
[1:28:04] using natural examples to stay in the
[1:28:06] spiritual realm it took certain
[1:28:08] instruments and it took people trained
[1:28:11] to be catch what's beneath the
[1:28:14] surface because it's not altogether what
[1:28:17] you see that's a value it's what's
[1:28:20] beneath the surface that that's
[1:28:23] unidentified that holds the great things
[1:28:25] of value that's right it takes a special
[1:28:29] instrument a special trained
[1:28:32] eye to catch and say there's something
[1:28:35] deeper there that's why the word speaks
[1:28:38] to our life your life my life and says
[1:28:41] there's something deeper there's
[1:28:43] something deeper in you there's
[1:28:44] something deeper in your life there's a
[1:28:46] deeper walk what is it it's the eye of
[1:28:49] God he promised he would guide us with
[1:28:51] his own
[1:28:53] I and he sees the potentials that lay
[1:28:56] Within You and I the unidentified things
[1:28:58] the things that you or me are not even
[1:29:01] aware that even are laying there within
[1:29:07] us think about we could go on through
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:11] scriptures here was Noah Noah was not a
[1:29:13] builder Noah was not a
[1:29:18] builder if Noah would have had to submit
[1:29:20] his resume
[1:29:22] right job Hunter would not have accepted
[1:29:26] it Head Hunter would not have accepted
[1:29:29] these are all
[1:29:30] agencies you're a
[1:29:34] farmer he looks unqualified right but
[1:29:38] he's perfectly
[1:29:39] qualified in the eyes of God Amen
[1:29:43] right
[1:29:46] unidentified as a messenger before
[1:29:50] judgment even the ark here he receives
[1:29:54] this Revelation from God about preparing
[1:29:56] an ark before
[1:29:59] judgment I wonder how many walked by it
[1:30:02] which they did they scoffed the Bible
[1:30:04] tells us there was scoffers in that
[1:30:07] day they looked upon the ark and
[1:30:09] said there's other boats right and there
[1:30:14] were but the difference was there was
[1:30:18] only one that was god-given and God
[1:30:22] constructed oh yeah and that was what
[1:30:24] was given Noah that's right all the rest
[1:30:27] of them could not rise in the
[1:30:33] Judgment are you with me that Mark to
[1:30:36] where you even know this and and and and
[1:30:38] here Sierra setting here even maybe she
[1:30:41] know it maybe she don't know it but even
[1:30:42] how the the Navy in the in the yards
[1:30:45] when I've watched years ago in their
[1:30:47] testing years ago 2ome years ago
[1:30:49] watching even looking at a documentary
[1:30:51] they will take the specifics of that Ark
[1:30:54] and every one of our aircraft carriers
[1:30:57] every one of our ships are built as far
[1:31:00] as in those
[1:31:01] relations right why because it was made
[1:31:04] they showed it in the naval tanks over
[1:31:07] there in New Jersey it could roll over
[1:31:09] at 90° and come right back up wow that's
[1:31:13] amazing god listen science isn't against
[1:31:16] God God will take science and make it
[1:31:19] testify of his word
[1:31:22] it's when man gets in it are you hearing
[1:31:25] me it's when man gets in it but God
[1:31:28] allowed that just like he'll allow the
[1:31:30] snow to to erode a little bit to melt
[1:31:33] and they'll catch that on the top of
[1:31:35] Mount erat God don't have to do that
[1:31:40] amen how many people has that changed I
[1:31:42] don't know but I would dare to say it
[1:31:45] hasn't been maybe too many
[1:31:50] people because you see Faith cometh by
[1:31:54] hearing sometimes individuals with the
[1:31:56] day and age we're living in things can
[1:31:59] become so skeptic that's good yes that's
[1:32:03] true we're living in a day of reality
[1:32:06] that's when it's nothing but
[1:32:10] pretend so
[1:32:12] true on media
[1:32:15] pretending true and then somebody else
[1:32:18] follows this oh look what they're doing
[1:32:21] look how happy they are honey we need to
[1:32:23] go in debt so we can be as happy as
[1:32:27] them try that and see how it works for
[1:32:30] you that's right it's a day of deception
[1:32:34] that's right it's a day of
[1:32:38] falsehood I don't watch them but I know
[1:32:41] enough about it you see read a little
[1:32:43] bit here and there but I always thought
[1:32:45] H what are they talking about reality TV
[1:32:48] shows who in the world's going to have
[1:32:51] let a c camera follow them all around
[1:32:54] and they're going to act just right on
[1:32:56] the Bell that's right that's
[1:33:00] true I mean you know as the old saying
[1:33:03] goes I might not have been born today
[1:33:06] but I weren't born last
[1:33:12] night I mean but you understand listen
[1:33:15] friends those little things you know
[1:33:17] what that's all to do is to take
[1:33:20] away it's like sometimes even on the
[1:33:23] simplest innocent little things and they
[1:33:26] want to subject a little bit of a a
[1:33:28] little bit of a movie a little bit of
[1:33:30] things here of oh this guy's a mind
[1:33:32] reader what's he trying to do trying to
[1:33:34] take away from the supernatural let me
[1:33:36] tell you something no prophet of God was
[1:33:39] ever a mind
[1:33:42] reader it has to be God to reveal his
[1:33:46] secrets to His
[1:33:48] prophets that's not something and I I
[1:33:51] know I'm speak speaking to you as
[1:33:52] Believers that's not something that I'm
[1:33:53] convinced of as far as just by the word
[1:33:56] that's by an
[1:33:59] experience that's right are you hearing
[1:34:00] me that's by an
[1:34:02] experience that God confirms that to our
[1:34:07] hearts oh I thank God for that I'm glad
[1:34:09] that it goes so much deeper than
[1:34:10] reasoning reasoning if it stays within
[1:34:13] the word of God but when it goes against
[1:34:15] God's word forget
[1:34:17] it here's Noah here's Moses on on Jesus
[1:34:20] disciples I who would have chose Jesus
[1:34:23] disciples right that's true matter of
[1:34:25] fact who would have chose David's Mighty
[1:34:27] Men
[1:34:29] right David's mighty men were a bunch of
[1:34:33] routs that's that's the truth nobody
[1:34:36] wanted them very
[1:34:39] true the
[1:34:42] disciples couldn't even read their
[1:34:44] name some were Tax Collectors yeah these
[1:34:48] were not altogether men of a founding
[1:34:53] reputation neither were they of
[1:34:56] Education once again God takes
[1:34:59] unidentified things and identifies
[1:35:02] himself by why didn't he take the
[1:35:04] theologians the Pharisees the Sadducees
[1:35:07] this is why the Bible said if the
[1:35:09] princes of this
[1:35:11] world do you realize what the religious
[1:35:14] sector was Paul identifies them they're
[1:35:16] princes of this world if they had known
[1:35:20] it they would not have crucified our
[1:35:23] Lord but they couldn't
[1:35:26] recognize God was identifying himself
[1:35:29] according to the word they read they
[1:35:32] quoted they said they walked around with
[1:35:35] fringes on their garment but they
[1:35:37] couldn't
[1:35:39] recognize the identified word of
[1:35:42] almighty
[1:35:46] God that's why the prophet said God
[1:35:48] takes the simple things to identify
[1:35:50] himself through h just his word think
[1:35:52] about Hebrews 11:1 he made the world out
[1:35:56] of the things that does not appear the
[1:35:59] invisible things Romans 1:20 says the
[1:36:01] invisible things of him from the
[1:36:03] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:36:05] being understood by the things that are
[1:36:08] made even his eternal power and
[1:36:12] godhead David goes on with this
[1:36:15] I we look when you
[1:36:17] look it's God the
[1:36:19] handiwork God has set the heavens and
[1:36:22] the Earth it's God that had done
[1:36:26] that and God takes the simple things he
[1:36:30] took
[1:36:31] Gideon I mentioned Saul a moment
[1:36:34] ago after mentioning
[1:36:37] David remember when God came to
[1:36:40] Gideon insignificant Gideon even looked
[1:36:43] at himself he says my family is the
[1:36:46] poorest in
[1:36:48] manasse and I'm the least in my own
[1:36:54] family yes in other words I'm
[1:36:57] insignificant if you're wanting someone
[1:36:59] significant Lord you got the wrong
[1:37:02] guy I was sure when you said thy Mighty
[1:37:06] Man of Valor that you were talking of a
[1:37:08] significant one who was here but see God
[1:37:12] knew what was unidentified in Gideon's
[1:37:16] life in the presence of God as Gideon
[1:37:20] would continue to yield himself to God
[1:37:24] it would become
[1:37:28] identified Samuel the prophet after
[1:37:31] Saul's rejected comes into the house
[1:37:34] opens up the flask and here he is he's
[1:37:36] ready the horn he's ready to anoint and
[1:37:38] in Samuel I love that the scripture
[1:37:40] records it that Samuel walked up to the
[1:37:42] eldest son Jesse had seven sons in the
[1:37:45] house David was the eighth son true he
[1:37:49] wasn't even there that would be be like
[1:37:51] your parents having Christmas dinner and
[1:37:53] not even calling
[1:37:56] you that's right to me that's called
[1:37:59] fighting
[1:38:03] words look look even when he's asked
[1:38:07] when Samuel says in his heart Samuel
[1:38:10] looks on the eldest the stature surely
[1:38:13] this is the Lord's anointed showing
[1:38:16] listen all of us and our Humanity
[1:38:20] there's a lot of things that we have
[1:38:21] thought is the Lord's anointed surely
[1:38:24] this job is the Lord's anointed surely
[1:38:28] this thing is God's anointed but if you
[1:38:31] just keep listening he lets you know
[1:38:34] what he wants you to bless because
[1:38:37] whatever you bless what you what you
[1:38:40] yield to and you yield in his leading
[1:38:43] God will bless you and you'll be a
[1:38:45] blessing right that's the principle of
[1:38:48] God so true is that right clear for me
[1:38:51] Abraham oh he's surely the Lord's
[1:38:53] anointing went right down the line 1 2 3
[1:38:56] 4 5 6
[1:38:58] 7 now if Samuel had been like some of us
[1:39:01] Samuel said Lord I don't see anybody
[1:39:04] else in my age group surely I have to
[1:39:07] marry that
[1:39:09] one I don't see no more
[1:39:15] available these are
[1:39:17] pressures these are pressures absolutely
[1:39:20] I know what I'm talking about
[1:39:22] but he wasn't even invited David was out
[1:39:24] there tending the Sheep you know what
[1:39:26] they you know what that signified it
[1:39:28] wasn't important he's
[1:39:30] insignificant they're going to anoint a
[1:39:32] King David won't be needed for this
[1:39:35] one that's right leave him out there
[1:39:37] tending sheep that's right Samuel said
[1:39:39] you got another one yeah he's out there
[1:39:41] in the
[1:39:43] field you mean you didn't even prepare a
[1:39:45] place at the table nah he's on the field
[1:39:48] he's Ruddy insignificant he's just youth
[1:39:52] go call him we ain't sit him down till
[1:39:54] he comes
[1:39:56] inallah we will not sit down until he
[1:39:59] comes on the
[1:40:01] scene and when David entered then
[1:40:04] quickly the Lord said anoint him right
[1:40:08] yeah he was
[1:40:10] unidentified yes sir but by the word of
[1:40:13] God Amen that God delivered to a prophet
[1:40:16] and a prophet took a message to anoint
[1:40:19] David as the king
[1:40:22] David was identified David could not see
[1:40:25] his name in the
[1:40:27] book but when there like Bethlehem it
[1:40:30] wasn't wrote in the chapter of
[1:40:32] inheritance your name my name we cannot
[1:40:35] read our name in there Brian Dave Samuel
[1:40:39] uh on Aaron we don't read our name like
[1:40:42] that but it is God manifesting his word
[1:40:47] and as he manifests the mystery of
[1:40:50] himself his own life that's what calls
[1:40:53] our name am that's good
[1:40:56] Hallelujah though they could look in the
[1:40:58] book and say well I don't see your name
[1:41:00] in there I don't see your I don't see
[1:41:02] Bethlehem in Joshua chapter 15 I I don't
[1:41:05] see but see when God reveals it you see
[1:41:08] your name written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:41:12] Life
[1:41:16] Hallelujah unidentified but identified
[1:41:18] in his presence
[1:41:28] H let me just close on
[1:41:31] this there's absolutely no
[1:41:34] other no other
[1:41:38] place our Lord could have been born but
[1:41:41] Bethlehem and you see how the Lord has
[1:41:44] taken us to be able to see this that
[1:41:46] it's more than just us if Satan can get
[1:41:49] us just he can get you just to look look
[1:41:50] at something that has happened oh yeah
[1:41:53] he was born in a
[1:41:55] manger oh yeah he he went went to
[1:41:59] Calvary went to the Cross
[1:42:01] but what God wants you to
[1:42:04] see is why he came the way he did why he
[1:42:09] did what he did and paid the price is so
[1:42:12] that
[1:42:12] you could be a
[1:42:14] partaker this morning of his
[1:42:19] life and the reason there wasn't any
[1:42:22] room for him in the end think how God so
[1:42:24] fit this think here he is born in
[1:42:27] Bethlehem in
[1:42:29] Bethlehem least among it all
[1:42:33] little and God chooses Bethlehem not
[1:42:38] Shiloh not
[1:42:40] Jerusalem not any of these other
[1:42:43] seemingly more important and they have
[1:42:46] their place bigger cities but God
[1:42:49] chose that that it would come out of a
[1:42:52] little place something that was
[1:42:56] unidentified something that was well if
[1:42:58] we could say it like we would understand
[1:43:00] it today you would say Sho did I pass
[1:43:03] through that place there wasn't even a
[1:43:05] traffic light sometimes we'll say oh
[1:43:07] that's a one trffic light Town meaning
[1:43:09] very very
[1:43:10] small it wasn't even that until after
[1:43:14] seon salmone had come there but even
[1:43:17] then it was very small and
[1:43:19] insignificant but God had chosen by his
[1:43:23] word Before Time what I read in m in
[1:43:26] Micah chapter 5 but think about what it
[1:43:29] took to get
[1:43:32] there think about what it took to get
[1:43:35] there think about in your life and my
[1:43:37] life what it what it what God what has
[1:43:40] taken for us to get in position that's
[1:43:43] so good think about what it's taken for
[1:43:46] you and I to get in the place and God
[1:43:48] continuing to move us into position in
[1:43:52] our own lives because it don't
[1:43:54] stop it don't
[1:43:56] stop listen once you have list this is
[1:43:59] why friends listen it's very important
[1:44:01] crucial that you are born again but once
[1:44:03] you're born again you're not a fully
[1:44:07] matured son and daughter of God you
[1:44:12] grow and you
[1:44:14] develop see what happens is remember the
[1:44:18] little boy with the stamp he only saw
[1:44:20] ice cream cones this is where as you
[1:44:23] grow in the Lord you begin to see as a
[1:44:26] greater
[1:44:27] value to his word a greater value you
[1:44:31] begin to Value even his desire you begin
[1:44:34] to Dev value see your value Rises
[1:44:37] there's things that you look back wow
[1:44:39] man I didn't realize what so- and so was
[1:44:42] saying there man this is this is really
[1:44:43] important like many of us can look back
[1:44:45] to our parents and the advice they gave
[1:44:47] that's true man
[1:44:52] it took
[1:44:53] pressure taxation but when they while
[1:44:56] they were there I love how the Bible
[1:44:57] says it while they were there she was
[1:45:01] delivered of a
[1:45:03] child and God knows how to get every one
[1:45:06] of us as he as he has and as he is doing
[1:45:12] and will do into
[1:45:14] position God knows how to do it God's
[1:45:17] not asked me to pull you or you to pull
[1:45:19] me it's his word and listen and that
[1:45:22] word is going out and it's a season for
[1:45:24] that word to be fulfilled remember every
[1:45:27] unidentified part is going to be
[1:45:30] identified by
[1:45:32] him in his ordained place in your life
[1:45:37] so true and this is why that when we
[1:45:40] look at this no room for him in the end
[1:45:42] no place no place at all I think that's
[1:45:46] something where we can just pause with
[1:45:48] that that part of it here and let's just
[1:45:50] let's just stop it brings us to that
[1:45:52] reality of
[1:45:54] the God's
[1:45:56] desire is to be
[1:45:58] identified in every one of our Lives
[1:46:02] amen and I just encourage you here this
[1:46:05] morning if you don't know him in that
[1:46:07] way first of all it starts to know him
[1:46:10] as your savior your lord and savior
[1:46:12] because that's the announcement unto us
[1:46:14] this day in the city of Bethlehem is
[1:46:17] born a savior hallu that's
[1:46:21] good it begins with that there is one to
[1:46:25] save you from your
[1:46:28] sins remember the same one who saves
[1:46:32] you is like the man who picks up the
[1:46:34] Dirty Glass he picks up the dirty glass
[1:46:37] with the intention of cleaning it up and
[1:46:40] with the ultimate purpose filling it and
[1:46:43] drinking from
[1:46:46] it God wants our lives to be an offering
[1:46:51] unto
[1:46:52] him that we no longer live our life to
[1:46:55] our own ways our own self our own
[1:46:58] objectives but we live it according to
[1:47:00] the word of God and I just say let God
[1:47:03] evaluate in your life evaluate in your
[1:47:05] heart Even In This Moment In This
[1:47:08] Day we could say many things but I'd say
[1:47:11] look at it like this sometimes there
[1:47:13] might be things that you can look in
[1:47:14] your own life and areas that you might
[1:47:16] feel like I I I don't know what's going
[1:47:19] on here I don't know what's taking place
[1:47:20] there but if you just really seek God
[1:47:22] and say God at all cost I believe
[1:47:25] there's things that God I don't just
[1:47:27] believe it I know that there's things
[1:47:28] that are unidentified right now that's
[1:47:31] right that God will identify y
[1:47:34] absolutely you know the Bible says God
[1:47:37] said prove me is that right when he came
[1:47:41] with tithes and offerings God said prove
[1:47:43] me only scripture he ever said prove me
[1:47:45] let me say something God himself is a
[1:47:49] provider
[1:47:51] yes I have seen it I have seen it time
[1:47:54] and time again and I'm not talking about
[1:47:58] just out there I'm talking about right
[1:48:00] here in my own life and in my own
[1:48:03] home of things that I would have never
[1:48:06] dreamed never thought but I can tell you
[1:48:08] this right here when you put God first
[1:48:11] this ain't bragging on me I'm talking
[1:48:13] about his word when you put him
[1:48:17] first then you've put his word before
[1:48:20] him
[1:48:21] hallu that's good then what you're doing
[1:48:24] is is making room for him that's if
[1:48:28] there's things in your life that's
[1:48:31] crowding him out make room for him right
[1:48:35] amen if things crowding you out and I
[1:48:37] just say this for those who are
[1:48:38] archiving comeing stream and everything
[1:48:40] if there's things that's crowding you
[1:48:41] out of really serving God it's time to
[1:48:44] evaluate what's really important if
[1:48:47] there's things that's crowding you out
[1:48:48] from being in the house of God it's time
[1:48:50] to
[1:48:52] evaluate what's really
[1:48:56] important listen friends we want to make
[1:48:59] room for
[1:49:01] him and God will take the things that
[1:49:04] you in your reasoning and in your mind
[1:49:06] have looked at it and it looks
[1:49:09] impossible to your reasoning and to your
[1:49:12] natural mind I know that's right been
[1:49:15] there multiple times but how God makes
[1:49:20] himself known that he's still Jehovah
[1:49:24] Gyra what I'm telling you you can't
[1:49:27] outgive God I'm talking about I'm not
[1:49:29] just talking about your finances that is
[1:49:32] important but I'm talking about your
[1:49:34] time I'm talking about your dedication
[1:49:37] to the things of God that's what I'm
[1:49:39] talking about right you can never
[1:49:42] outgive the
[1:49:44] Lord that's his word if you'll steal
[1:49:47] away in secret he said I'll reward
[1:49:50] toward you
[1:49:52] openly oh my don't you love him
[1:49:55] absolutely yes sir
[1:49:58] hallelujah oh
[1:50:01] Hallelujah let's
[1:50:04] stand
[1:50:11] my oh my thank you
[1:50:15] Jesus I think about it here this morning
[1:50:19] is as we just prepare in this moment and
[1:50:22] we we stand on a Christmas Eve Lord
[1:50:26] terries tomorrow be Christmas and then
[1:50:27] we come onto a new
[1:50:30] year I think what a fitting fitting
[1:50:32] moment and a fitting time it always is
[1:50:35] when God comes and visits it's a time to
[1:50:37] really reflect it's a time to where that
[1:50:39] if you don't know the Lord It's a time
[1:50:41] to really it's a time to take that
[1:50:43] opportunity take it's an opportunity
[1:50:46] that is so precious and what God can do
[1:50:50] for you in just a
[1:50:51] moment will have an effect on the rest
[1:50:54] of your
[1:50:56] life it's
[1:50:59] Eternal and I just say this morning if
[1:51:01] you don't know him and you want to know
[1:51:03] him just start with that right there
[1:51:06] start with repenting of your sins start
[1:51:11] right there start right with the golden
[1:51:14] rule for God so loved the world that he
[1:51:17] gave his only begotten son so that
[1:51:20] whosoever would believe in him may not
[1:51:24] perish
[1:51:27] very
[1:51:28] Simplicity and I think even in our lives
[1:51:32] where you start there you look into your
[1:51:34] life and you say I need a deeper walk
[1:51:37] with God now every one of us I trust
[1:51:40] every one of us could really say
[1:51:43] that yes
[1:51:45] sir maybe the Deep deeper walk that you
[1:51:48] need maybe it's a deeper walk where it's
[1:51:51] still the habits and sanctification and
[1:51:54] go letting God just continue to work on
[1:51:56] that work inside your temple you know
[1:51:58] what you do you feed your experience of
[1:52:03] what you've already experienced of
[1:52:06] him and watch what God will do in your
[1:52:10] life that's so
[1:52:14] good maybe you
[1:52:16] need the Holy Ghost which is a further
[1:52:21] more of the same Grace more of the same
[1:52:26] Spirit coming in the depths of your
[1:52:29] life what do I do just continue to feed
[1:52:33] your
[1:52:34] experience continue to give yourself to
[1:52:36] the Lord continue to make room for him
[1:52:40] because when you we as you're making
[1:52:42] room as the word is leading
[1:52:44] you he'll come to that
[1:52:47] place a Manger
[1:52:50] a stable a place that would not be a
[1:52:55] place that we would expect a king to be
[1:52:58] born I love how the prophet took it in
[1:53:00] 63 why little Bethlehem he said in a
[1:53:05] stinking
[1:53:06] stable that's right but he said God was
[1:53:09] showing what he would do when he would
[1:53:11] come into our
[1:53:13] lives lives that were
[1:53:16] filthy lives that surely ACC would not
[1:53:20] be born there surely there won't come a
[1:53:23] king and a priest out of that
[1:53:27] life but God
[1:53:29] says I know what's down
[1:53:32] there yes sir and I'm the one who brings
[1:53:35] out and
[1:53:37] identifies the
[1:53:39] unidentified there's things every one of
[1:53:41] us can testify now in our lives and
[1:53:43] looking at the overcoming grace of God
[1:53:45] and say my Lord you've given me
[1:53:50] strengthen this area of my life I'm
[1:53:54] overcoming amen there's there's distance
[1:53:57] being put between God you're giving me
[1:54:00] Grace Hey listen friends that's
[1:54:01] overcoming
[1:54:03] Grace We're
[1:54:06] overcoming
[1:54:08] oh I say
[1:54:10] God no matter what your need is if you
[1:54:13] don't know him today it's a wonderful
[1:54:15] time to surrender it starts with simply
[1:54:17] recognizing him as your lord and savior
[1:54:19] Lord Lord I need you if you need more of
[1:54:22] him Lord I need more of that same Grace
[1:54:24] I need to go want to go deeper I want it
[1:54:26] going deeper in my life I want to go
[1:54:27] deeper I want to say
[1:54:30] Lord that's where I am I I believe in my
[1:54:34] heart I I have the subtleness I I have
[1:54:36] the Seal of God in my life I I know I I
[1:54:39] see it working I see what he's done in
[1:54:41] my life he's CH what it is he changed my
[1:54:44] nature my desires are not the desires of
[1:54:47] the world that's true well sure Satan
[1:54:50] comes and tempts here and there but I
[1:54:51] don't my desires is not for the things
[1:54:54] of the world
[1:54:56] absolutely but I want more of
[1:55:00] him Lord help me if there's areas cuz no
[1:55:03] doubt there might be areas that stand
[1:55:05] out to you right now maybe there's areas
[1:55:07] that he spoke about maybe he didn't call
[1:55:09] it out by word but just out of the light
[1:55:11] of the word come it showed you you could
[1:55:13] be making some more room right here and
[1:55:15] you know what invite him in because he
[1:55:20] does what you think is
[1:55:23] impossible where these men could have
[1:55:25] looked at Noah and said you're crazy
[1:55:27] you're building an ark a boat not near
[1:55:32] the
[1:55:33] water but he was following God God
[1:55:37] didn't need for Noah to bring the boat
[1:55:39] to the water God was going to bring the
[1:55:41] water to the boat so if you just stay
[1:55:44] that's a principle seek you first the
[1:55:46] kingdom of God and all these other
[1:55:48] things will be at add it to you God
[1:55:50] knows what you have need of no matter
[1:55:53] how strange or how odd it seems just
[1:55:54] just do what he's asking you to do make
[1:55:57] room for
[1:55:58] him and in the areas that are
[1:56:00] unidentified you'll watch him move
[1:56:02] you'll watch grow in your life and'll be
[1:56:05] filled with
[1:56:07] God you love him he's good isn't he yes
[1:56:10] he is amen let's just
[1:56:14] pray Heavenly
[1:56:17] Father well Lord
[1:56:21] I just just stand in awe Lord and
[1:56:24] thankful God that you would take us and
[1:56:27] lead us Lord and direct us through your
[1:56:30] word there's things Lord that we know
[1:56:33] that we can study and look at and
[1:56:35] thoughts that you press Upon Our Hearts
[1:56:37] but there's nothing
[1:56:39] Lord like it is when you come and and
[1:56:42] the inspiration that was given but yet
[1:56:44] Lord there's ways that you take things
[1:56:46] that
[1:56:47] my it's just it's different but it's
[1:56:51] needful Lord and you're so mindful of
[1:56:55] every every part of our
[1:56:58] life Lord I pray here this morning I
[1:57:01] certainly lord always want to ask that
[1:57:03] if there's one that doesn't know you
[1:57:05] that God they would see the Saving Grace
[1:57:09] of Jesus Christ to know that Lord that's
[1:57:12] the reason you came you came in order
[1:57:15] Lord to redeem that your blood would be
[1:57:20] shed an innocent blood to purchase and
[1:57:23] make a way for us Lord that Lord that we
[1:57:27] could become
[1:57:28] partakers of that same divine
[1:57:32] nature Lord the reality to give us the
[1:57:36] life that was before the
[1:57:38] fall that Union with you
[1:57:42] Lord oh God that satisfaction that rest
[1:57:47] that
[1:57:48] peace that reality where you come into
[1:57:51] the control tower in the will in the
[1:57:54] middle of the will the main spring like
[1:57:57] that of a watch where every other gear
[1:58:00] turns by that's your desire Lord that's
[1:58:04] the purpose of your coming the way you
[1:58:07] did is so Lord that you
[1:58:10] might bring to
[1:58:13] us that
[1:58:15] reality that we have thirsted for Lord
[1:58:19] thank you for your
[1:58:21] mercy Lord how we ask Lord that you
[1:58:25] would just continue in these moments
[1:58:29] Lord guide us
[1:58:32] Lord as you guided Lord those wise men
[1:58:36] as they follow that star Supernatural
[1:58:40] Supernatural they're the only ones who
[1:58:42] saw
[1:58:43] it
[1:58:44] supernaturally according to your word as
[1:58:46] you said back in the Book of Numbers a
[1:58:49] star shall arise out of
[1:58:51] Jacob Lord they followed it until they
[1:58:54] come to the place and I think of it God
[1:58:58] that you provided a star in this end
[1:59:01] time
[1:59:02] lord we're so thankful for that
[1:59:06] star but we know what that star was for
[1:59:09] it was to point us and show us the word
[1:59:12] is made
[1:59:14] flesh and the desire and the call of the
[1:59:16] hour is that the word would be made
[1:59:18] flesh
[1:59:19] in our
[1:59:21] lives that we might understand Lord by
[1:59:24] the grace of God and see your desire to
[1:59:28] live in US Lord and live through
[1:59:31] us help us Lord as we are standing here
[1:59:35] in this Christmas season Lord and as we
[1:59:37] would prepare to pass into the new year
[1:59:41] Lord God should you
[1:59:43] T I want to know you
[1:59:46] more help me and the the others Lord my
[1:59:50] brothers and sisters every one of us
[1:59:52] Lord help us guide us Lord the things
[1:59:56] that we know and the things that maybe
[1:59:58] that we don't know show us where Lord
[2:00:02] God that we might be able to make room
[2:00:06] for you
[2:00:07] Lord Lord you don't need great big
[2:00:10] things all you showed us right now
[2:00:14] simple little
[2:00:17] obedience you take Lord sometimes
[2:00:20] there's things that lord it's us and our
[2:00:22] Humanity we can get to saying oh if I
[2:00:24] could if I could just do this for God if
[2:00:27] I could just do that but Lord there's no
[2:00:32] higher calling to any
[2:00:36] believer than to be obedient to the
[2:00:40] voice of
[2:00:41] God there's no greater thing no higher
[2:00:45] calling we see Saul he did not value
[2:00:49] that
[2:00:49] that the further he walked the less
[2:00:52] value he gave to the word and to those
[2:00:57] who were representatives of that word
[2:01:01] but we see David David Lord oh sure
[2:01:04] David had there was some shortcomings
[2:01:06] that David had that's true you could
[2:01:09] have chose to hide that but you didn't
[2:01:12] but you said when you anointed
[2:01:15] him the part that was unidentified you
[2:01:18] said he he a man after my own
[2:01:22] heart David was willing to
[2:01:28] repent that's what Lord how your Prophet
[2:01:30] would show us that in the message of
[2:01:32] Grace well
[2:01:35] Lord I'm thankful I'm grateful because
[2:01:38] that's what the Holy Spirit comes Lord
[2:01:41] as it directs in each of Our Lives I
[2:01:44] hope we never get away from that Lord
[2:01:47] help us to be sensitive help us not to
[2:01:49] reason things away help us not to reason
[2:01:52] away parts of the word of why we can't
[2:01:54] do this or why we can't do that Lord for
[2:01:58] we know that you'll surely Lord you'll
[2:01:59] pull back because your presence
[2:02:02] accompanies your word but help us Lord
[2:02:05] that even when we don't even understand
[2:02:08] because there's many times that we don't
[2:02:11] there's times Lord like right here Among
[2:02:13] Us there's some Lord that you've healed
[2:02:16] in a way that they're standing right
[2:02:18] here with us
[2:02:19] there's others that's been healed but
[2:02:21] they went on to
[2:02:23] Glory our understanding of it I don't
[2:02:26] understand
[2:02:27] it but I believe
[2:02:30] you and I Trust You
[2:02:33] Lord I would rather have that than to
[2:02:36] have the
[2:02:38] understanding because understanding
[2:02:40] would only get me so
[2:02:41] far but
[2:02:43] trust Lord God it'll take me it'll help
[2:02:47] me it'll guide me through times
[2:02:50] Lord of hard hardness and trials and
[2:02:54] test just like it has for my brothers
[2:02:56] and sisters help us Lord help us father
[2:03:00] may we see just the value of how you
[2:03:03] value simple obedience to the word of
[2:03:08] God help us Lord I pray we love you and
[2:03:11] we thank you Lord thank you for your
[2:03:14] mercy once again Lord how we appreciate
[2:03:17] you in this hour Lord
[2:03:19] Lord we look at you we just we're so
[2:03:21] thankful God that you've come in your
[2:03:23] mercy and Grace and open our
[2:03:26] eyes Lord as we read Lord from the
[2:03:28] scriptures we're not reading from a
[2:03:30] closed book we're reading from an open
[2:03:34] book places that we can
[2:03:37] see
[2:03:39] identified I think of how your Prophet
[2:03:41] would take it in God's chosen place of
[2:03:43] worship he would say oh how I love those
[2:03:46] secret passages yes through the word of
[2:03:50] God
[2:03:52] hallelujah oh Lord
[2:03:56] Jesus as I heard your Prophet say that I
[2:03:59] thought of that scripture in Song of
[2:04:00] Solomon
[2:04:02] 21:14 when Solomon would speak to his
[2:04:04] bride oh my
[2:04:07] Dove my lovely
[2:04:10] one thou who dwellest in The Secret of
[2:04:14] the
[2:04:15] stairs
[2:04:17] come let me see your
[2:04:20] countenance let me hear your
[2:04:23] voice oh
[2:04:26] Lord I'm so thankful for the access that
[2:04:30] we have through the blood of Jesus
[2:04:35] Christ for you would liken us to your
[2:04:39] own nature oh my Dove we love you
[2:04:46] Lord Lord God if there's one Lord who
[2:04:49] doesn't know you in that way may they
[2:04:52] realize what your desire is is to be
[2:04:56] born in the manger of their
[2:05:00] heart not as though you were to be born
[2:05:04] again but they us as individuals Lord by
[2:05:08] you coming
[2:05:09] in that's the new
[2:05:13] birth that's what it means to be born
[2:05:17] again is when our life has been changed
[2:05:21] our
[2:05:22] desires have
[2:05:26] changed and there's a desire within us
[2:05:28] to
[2:05:30] press on press to
[2:05:33] Perfection help us
[2:05:35] Lord may you just continue just sweep
[2:05:38] right Among Us right now
[2:05:40] Lord give strength Lord may this be the
[2:05:44] moment where every besetting sin l
[2:05:49] loses any grip that it would have Lord
[2:05:53] May every weight that is slowed down or
[2:05:57] hindered help us Lord that it would be
[2:06:01] laid
[2:06:03] aside Lord you know even last night just
[2:06:05] studying looking at some things Lord and
[2:06:08] come across that on the study and found
[2:06:10] it so incredible how your Prophet would
[2:06:13] say God help us to lay asound lay aside
[2:06:16] every thought
[2:06:18] [Music]
[2:06:20] that would so easily beset
[2:06:23] us help us
[2:06:25] Lord because before there can ever be
[2:06:28] any action or anything that's done it
[2:06:30] begins with a thought help us to bring
[2:06:34] every thought into captivity to The
[2:06:40] Obedience of
[2:06:42] Christ help us Lord I pray we love you
[2:06:45] Lord so appreciate you bless your
[2:06:47] children Lord some that are traveling be
[2:06:50] with them Lord Lord God as different

[2:06:55] different things throughout this time

[2:10:45] day God bless you I don't want to take
[2:10:47] too much much time here but there was
[2:10:49] something that I wanted to share and the
[2:10:50] Lord was pressing upon my heart to share
[2:10:52] it so I just want to to follow his his
[2:10:56] leading uh as I was praying here and I I
[2:10:58] shared this with Brother Carlos here
[2:11:01] before the service even started and I
[2:11:02] believe it ties right into what brother
[2:11:05] Samuel was saying here at the end and uh
[2:11:07] you know we just need to stay focused on
[2:11:10] him and get get ourselves out of the way
[2:11:13] and I was
[2:11:14] praying you know Lord just keep me zer
[2:11:18] in I just I just want to be zeroed
[2:11:21] in and
[2:11:23] absolutely he just started flooding me
[2:11:25] in with with a bunch of different
[2:11:27] thoughts and you know brother Samuel has
[2:11:28] preached that in the past no doubt be
[2:11:31] zeroed in brother brandom's talked about
[2:11:33] it and
[2:11:35] um you know the the three wise men we
[2:11:39] don't know
[2:11:41] if if they had a physical
[2:11:44] Compass but we do know that they had an
[2:11:47] internal compass compass and they had
[2:11:49] yes the star to guide them and no matter
[2:11:53] if they were going east or if they were
[2:11:57] going west they were always going True
[2:12:00] North they were always zeroed in and
[2:12:03] that true north is zero on a compass
[2:12:07] it's
[2:12:08] zero
[2:12:10] so I pulled out my phone and I'm sure
[2:12:13] most of you have a compass on your phone
[2:12:16] I pulled out my phone and when you move
[2:12:19] it it's like a regular Compass it's
[2:12:21] supposed to stay on North well mine it
[2:12:24] was locked on
[2:12:25] zero no matter which way I moved it it
[2:12:28] was locked on zero I closed it out I
[2:12:32] thought it was maybe not working right I
[2:12:34] closed it out I opened it again it was
[2:12:36] stuck on zero that's so good yes sir and
[2:12:40] I'm like you know maybe I need maybe it
[2:12:43] needs an update well I don't want an
[2:12:45] update I want it stuck on zero that's
[2:12:48] good yes sir that's where I want to be
[2:12:50] stuck is on
[2:12:52] zero in my I asked I asked Amanda I said
[2:12:55] pull yours out pull your compass out she
[2:12:59] moved it around but it was moving it was
[2:13:02] working like a regular
[2:13:04] Compass mine was stuck on zero let our
[2:13:07] all of our compasses be stuck on zero
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:16] absolutely
[2:13:22] I'm glad God gives us sufficient
[2:13:25] Grace to look and to examine in our own
[2:13:30] lives and that's truly our desire when
[2:13:33] God is moved in your life the only thing
[2:13:36] the one thing that we desire to do is to
[2:13:39] stay in step with him
