[33:27] turning wood to your Bibles to John
[33:29] chapter 12 John chapter 12 and I want to
[33:34] read verses 20 through 28
[33:51] John chapter 12 verse 20 and there were
[33:55] certain Greeks among them which came up
[33:57] to worship at the feast and the same
[34:00] came unto Philip which was a bethesda of
[34:03] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[34:06] would see Jesus Philip cometh and
[34:09] telleth Andrew and again Andrew and
[34:11] Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered
[34:14] them saying the hour is come that the
[34:18] son of man should be glorified verily
[34:21] verily I say unto you except the corn of
[34:23] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[34:25] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[34:27] forth much fruit he that loveth his life
[34:31] shall lose it he that hated his life in
[34:34] this world shall keep it unto life
[34:36] eternal if any man served me let him
[34:40] follow me where I am there shall also my
[34:43] servant be if any man serve me him will
[34:46] my father honor now is my soul troubled
[34:51] and what shall I say father save me from
[34:55] this hour but for this cause came I into
[34:58] this hour
[35:00] father glorify thy name and there came a
[35:03] voice from heaven saying I have
[35:05] glorified it and will glorify it again
[35:08] amen
[35:09] you may be seated I want to speak on the
[35:17] hour has come
[35:22] the Greeks came and they sought Philip
[35:28] and Andrew brought him to Jesus they
[35:30] were sought saying they wanted to see
[35:31] Jesus but the Greeks were somewhat
[35:36] disappointed because the scripture goes
[35:40] on to say in the 37th verse that though
[35:43] he had done so many miracles before them
[35:45] yet they believed not on him they were
[35:49] expecting something different how could
[35:55] someone be expecting more than the Word
[36:01] made flesh them in their mess
[36:04] but the problem was they didn't
[36:06] recognize it they all they seen was a
[36:12] man all they seen was another Jew but
[36:19] the elect could see something beyond the
[36:22] veil of flesh and know that that was the
[36:27] Son of God
[36:31] the elect today can see him beyond the
[36:34] veil it's by faith that we see it if we
[36:43] see with our natural eye or understand
[36:46] with our human intellect then there
[36:51] wouldn't be no need for faith but it's
[36:55] by faith that we see the Word of God
[36:59] today it's by faith that we see God in
[37:03] one another today Jesus answers them the
[37:11] hour has come that the Son of man should
[37:14] be glorified Moses had told them that
[37:22] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[37:25] prophet like unto me and son a man means
[37:29] prophet hours come that the Son of man
[37:33] should be glorified the word glorified
[37:35] there means to to be praised to magnify
[37:40] to show the worth of something to show
[37:45] the worst of something so Jesus was
[37:47] saying the hour has come for me to show
[37:50] my worth dower has come this is our hour
[38:03] this is our our that the son of man be
[38:07] glorified in us this is our our that his
[38:13] name be glorified again Jesus told how
[38:21] that the worth was going to be manifest
[38:24] he said verily verily I say unto you
[38:26] except the corn if we'd fall in the
[38:29] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[38:30] it die it bringeth forth much fruit and
[38:33] if I be lifted up verse 32 from the
[38:36] earth I will draw all men unto me this
[38:41] he said signifying the death that he
[38:42] would die if we're ever going to see the
[38:50] worth come out of ourselves then we're
[38:54] gonna have to die to self accept the
[38:57] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[38:59] die it abideth it alone if we died
[39:03] itself then there'll be much fruit come
[39:05] forth Jesus trying hours affected
[39:12] greatly the disciples that were with him
[39:17] Jesus said to him in Matthew 26 verse 31
[39:22] then say it Jesus unto them all ye shall
[39:26] be offended because of me this night for
[39:28] it is written I will smite the Shepherd
[39:30] and the Sheep of the flock shall be
[39:32] scattered abroad but after I am risen
[39:35] again I will go before you into Galilee
[39:38] Peter answered him and said unto him
[39:40] though all men shall be offended by the
[39:43] yet will I never be offended
[39:46] Peter Peter was speaking these words and
[39:50] he meant them he was speaking them
[39:52] sincerely but he was speaking them from
[39:58] a gate of his spirit
[40:02] because Jesus later said that Peter
[40:05] hadn't even been converted yet and he
[40:08] said when you are strengthened the
[40:09] brother but he said verily I said to you
[40:13] this night before the crow thou
[40:15] shalt deny me thrice Peter said to him
[40:19] though I die with thee yet will I not
[40:21] deny thee and we see what happened Paul
[40:30] tells us in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3
[40:33] that the administration of the Spirit
[40:34] was not the engraving of the law on
[40:37] stones but it was the engraving of the
[40:41] Word of God in our hearts James 1 and 18
[40:46] it says of his own will begat he us with
[40:50] the word of truth that we should be a
[40:52] kind of firstfruits of his creatures
[40:55] wherefore my beloved brethren let every
[40:57] man be swift to hear slow to speak slow
[41:00] to wrath for the wrath of man worketh
[41:02] not the righteousness of God wherefore
[41:06] lay apart all filthiness and solidity of
[41:08] naughtiness and receive with meekness
[41:10] the engrafted word which is able to save
[41:13] your souls an exodus 31 in 18 it said he
[41:21] gave unto Moses when he had made an end
[41:24] of communing with him upon the mount
[41:25] sinai two tablets of testimony tablets
[41:28] of stone written with the finger of God
[41:32] and Paul's telling us it's not being
[41:35] wrote on tablets of stone today but it's
[41:39] been wrote in the heart and I say this
[41:44] morning is being wrote in their hearts
[41:46] by the finger of God
[41:51] when when we're born again we don't we
[41:57] don't get a new character we were born
[42:02] with a certain makeup about us and
[42:05] [Music]
[42:07] brother branham said that god he had
[42:10] done this that way so would get to
[42:12] certain team in the belt to make us the
[42:15] way we are then if we take and yield
[42:19] those things to God then he used them
[42:20] for his glory then God's glorified
[42:24] through our lives what you receive when
[42:31] you receive the new birth that's what is
[42:33] needed for your character to be molded
[42:37] and shaped and the things we go through
[42:44] many of them are molding and shaping our
[42:47] character and we make mistakes when
[42:53] we're going through them welcome to the
[42:57] potter's house because the mistakes is
[43:05] what he's looking for in order to make
[43:08] us perfect the Potter reshapes the clay
[43:15] until it reaches the perfect image that
[43:18] he had in his mind of what it should be
[43:31] and the message of the communion the
[43:33] ramen says now if God did not spare his
[43:36] own son from cruel testings then he will
[43:39] not spare you or I from cruel testing
[43:42] and Jesus was confronting the greatest
[43:45] test that he ever had and that was at
[43:49] Gethsemane that was the greatest test
[43:53] that he ever faced it was the greatest
[43:55] victory that he ever won because it was
[44:01] there in Gethsemane where he accepted it
[44:06] it was there in Gethsemane where he took
[44:10] all the sins of the past sins and
[44:12] present sins and future sins upon him no
[44:16] one else could have done it but him
[44:19] because it was God in man it's the
[44:25] greatest victory ever won all the demons
[44:27] of torment were standing around to try
[44:29] to tempt him and try
[44:37] but he proved his great Messiahship when
[44:43] he said not mind will but thine be done
[44:48] there's where the great victory was amen
[44:53] there's where we could say like he put
[44:55] his foot down he meant and he died out
[45:00] to self because you remember he said he
[45:05] come and prayed and said if it be
[45:07] possible let this possible let this cup
[45:09] pass from me but nevertheless not my
[45:15] will but thine be done
[45:19] there's where he died out to self
[45:25] brother Branham says in another place
[45:27] that God left him in the garden and he
[45:33] went to the cross as a man knows God
[45:37] couldn't die but he took on our sins
[45:43] amen and the hour had come the hour and
[45:47] for the cause that he had come to that
[45:50] hour had come to be the hour is come
[45:54] that the son of man be glorified the
[45:58] hours come again that the son of man be
[46:01] glorified through you through the things
[46:04] that you go through how you approach
[46:07] them how you weather the storms that of
[46:12] your lives what you your conduct when
[46:17] you're going through a trial you realize
[46:19] your family sees your conduct and though
[46:25] we would like to think that we never
[46:27] ever get a trial from one of our dear
[46:31] brothers and sisters sometimes it
[46:34] happens sometimes we find out it ain't
[46:40] them at all its us
[46:43] they're not the one that needs
[46:45] straightened out we are it's not what
[46:49] they're doing it's our attitude about it
[46:56] do you realize God will let things come
[47:00] your way that will just twist you and
[47:02] turn you inside out just so he can work
[47:08] in your life and mold you into what he
[47:12] wants you to be Jesus was fully aware of
[47:25] what the things that were taking place
[47:30] the disciples were not aware Jesus says
[47:35] in Matthew 16 if you want to read it
[47:37] with me Matthew 16 verses 21 through 23
[47:44] it was conveying his death and he says
[47:48] from that time began Jesus is showing to
[47:50] the cybers how he must go into Jerusalem
[47:52] and suffer many things of the elders and
[47:55] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[47:56] and be raised again the third day then
[47:59] Peter took him and began to rebuke him
[48:01] saying be it far from the Lord that this
[48:04] shall not be unto thee but he turned
[48:07] unto Peter and said get thee behind me
[48:09] Satan thou art offence unto me for thou
[48:12] savourest not the things that be of God
[48:14] but those things that be of men now
[48:18] Peter was not Satan neither was he of
[48:22] Satan but he was being anointed by Satan
[48:26] in his spirit round Peter
[48:31] filial love Jesus to the greatest
[48:34] capacity that he could and the devil
[48:40] began to play on Peters filio love for
[48:43] Jesus he said this ain't gonna happen to
[48:46] you I'm not gonna let it
[48:52] but it was the will of God and Peter's
[48:56] filial love was against the will of God
[49:03] minute listen friends God's plan doesn't
[49:06] fit with our filial love God's plan for
[49:12] our families does not fit within the
[49:14] confines of our filial love you know
[49:17] what filial love is it's human love
[49:25] later on in the scriptures when after
[49:29] Jesus had rose and you know Peter had
[49:32] denied him and Peter had felt that well
[49:36] everything was lost for him and so he
[49:38] said I'm gonna go fishing and we know
[49:42] when Jesus came on this shores there and
[49:44] bid Peter to come and Peter jumps out of
[49:48] the boat and comes in and Jesus asses
[49:51] him Peter lovest I leave when you look
[49:54] that up in the Greek he says Peter filio
[49:57] thou me Peter says yes Lord and then he
[50:03] asked him another time Peter loved me
[50:06] with your human love can you love me
[50:09] with your human love
[50:10] filial without me and he says yes I do
[50:14] then the third time he asked him in that
[50:16] time he says Peter agape oh thou me
[50:21] lovely with the godly love that's what
[50:27] we've got to do is love God with a
[50:30] perfect love the agape love our love for
[50:37] our family should not be above our love
[50:39] for God
[50:41] if it is I'm telling you you're never
[50:45] going to fully reach your family because
[50:50] if God doesn't mean any more to you than
[50:52] that
[50:52] why should he mean more to them than
[50:56] what they already have Jesus was the
[51:04] greatest thing that had ever happened in
[51:06] Peters life
[51:08] no wonder Peter loved him so greatly
[51:11] with the human love with Peters human
[51:17] love he loved Jesus more than anything
[51:26] but he didn't have that agape love yet
[51:32] he loved the fellowship but it was
[51:36] Jesus's time to show his worth it was
[51:40] time the hour is come the Son of man be
[51:43] glorified and after after he was gone
[51:49] Peter was going to be tested greatly
[51:51] himself he said Satan desires that
[51:56] sift you as wheat I pray thy faith fell
[52:00] denied he was going to be tested greatly
[52:05] himself why because his hour would come
[52:10] that the Son of Man be glorified through
[52:14] Peter you remember when Peters hour come
[52:18] he said I'm not worthy to be hung like
[52:21] my Lord hang me upside down and they
[52:25] hung him on a cross upside down Peter
[52:29] was crucified his hour had come
[52:39] remember when they came for Jesus Peter
[52:43] showed that love you had for Jesus again
[52:46] he cut off the ear of one of the men you
[52:52] know Jesus reached and got the year we
[52:55] know and he put it back upon the fella
[52:57] and healed you know that that healing
[53:00] was never mentioned in the trial never
[53:04] once was that healing mentioned in the
[53:06] trial but Peter witness did you see the
[53:10] things that Peter witnessed how Jesus
[53:15] conducted himself in the midst of these
[53:18] things made a great impression upon
[53:22] Peter that's why when it came Peter's
[53:29] hour but Peter was able to do what he
[53:33] did Peter was able to stand there and
[53:35] say go ahead and kill me just don't do
[53:39] it like you did my lord from not worth
[53:41] Peter was able to withstand every test
[53:45] because he had watched Jesus Christ and
[53:49] how he conducted himself when his our
[53:53] king you don't realize how many around
[54:01] you are watching you and watch how you
[54:04] conduct yourself your other brothers and
[54:06] sisters the Saints they watch how you
[54:08] conduct yourself in your trials
[54:14] sometimes people in the midst of trials
[54:17] that want to look around for sympathy
[54:19] what good is sympathy do you what good
[54:24] does it do for someone to feel sorry for
[54:26] you
[54:26] it don't change the events it doesn't
[54:30] change the situation and how does it
[54:34] really make you feel better it does
[54:40] but we look for symptoms because we're
[54:43] sitting there inwardly in our in our
[54:46] conjure crying why mean why is this
[54:48] happening to me
[54:52] it's happening to you because this is
[54:55] your hour the hour has come that the Son
[55:01] of Man be glorified through you he's
[55:05] glorified through you by how you conduct
[55:08] yourself by how you let him shape you in
[55:13] the midst of your trials that glorifies
[55:16] the Son of God after Simon put his sword
[55:30] up Jesus told him put his sword in
[55:34] achieving he said the cup which my
[55:36] father given me shall I not drink it in
[55:40] other words this this it's what the
[55:43] father has to give me Jesus didn't
[55:47] complain about it
[55:49] he wasn't whining about it and
[55:53] complaining I say that because I know
[55:55] sometimes we as humans we do whine we do
[56:01] complain I've been there isn't this ever
[56:09] going to end
[56:12] I either split times I went through
[56:18] things I look at my wife and said I
[56:19] can't see daylight but God brought me
[56:26] through just the same and when I come
[56:30] through on the other side it was to my
[56:33] good all things he does for your sakes
[56:39] Paul said all things he does for your
[56:44] sake that we'd be better and friends
[56:50] look we're not here just to live this
[56:52] life we're here getting prepared for
[56:56] another life there are men today that
[57:03] and women that just lived this life and
[57:06] that because that's the only life
[57:07] they're gonna have I remember some years
[57:16] ago I was in Sarasota Florida and
[57:21] there's a bay there off of the Gulf of
[57:26] Mexico and the bay there around Sarasota
[57:30] and there's many mansions that are built
[57:36] around that body of water and there's
[57:40] and I was there this has been years ago
[57:44] probably 20 21 years ago and I was there
[57:49] with brother Danny steamin and we were
[57:51] out fishing and he began to point to me
[57:55] and said this is certain certain persons
[57:58] mansion some big celebrity this another
[58:03] celebrity's mansion and he pointed out
[58:06] to me different ones said that's there
[58:08] so-and-so's mansion and I sit there in
[58:12] that boat and I thought this is their
[58:14] millennium
[58:17] because I'd heard the prophets say that
[58:20] some people are living out their
[58:22] millennium now oh but ours is coming how
[58:28] do you hallelujah I don't care about no
[58:35] mansion here
[58:37] my father has built me a house
[58:42] hallelujah jesus said I go away to
[58:45] prepare a place for you that where I am
[58:47] there you may be also
[58:56] Matthew 26 Jesus says verse 52 told
[59:02] Peter to put a getting sword in his
[59:04] place for all that take up the sword
[59:07] shall perish with the sword think of
[59:10] sound not that I cannot pray to my
[59:12] father and he should presently give me
[59:14] more than twelve legions of angels but
[59:21] how then shall the scripture be
[59:23] fulfilled that thus it must be
[59:27] I know it's may be perhaps a little
[59:37] difficult at times for us to see when
[59:39] we're going through certain things that
[59:41] we're facing hardships to see how is it
[59:46] that the word is being fulfilled it's
[59:50] because he said that he was going to
[59:53] present to himself a glorious church
[59:55] without spot or wrinkle or any such that
[59:59] blemish he's working and moving amongst
[1:00:04] us we're preparing to leave here not to
[1:00:07] stay here
[1:00:09] we're preparing for a life to come this
[1:00:13] life is so fleeting
[1:00:18] if the choice could be put before you
[1:00:20] have everything you ever wanted in this
[1:00:23] life even get your youth back and have
[1:00:29] everything every rich choose everything
[1:00:33] every that you could possibly want or
[1:00:37] have eternal life
[1:00:39] I choose eternal life with God what good
[1:00:50] would it do to live eternal without God
[1:01:00] many times when we're going through a
[1:01:06] trial there are times when we'll
[1:01:10] approach it with the carnal mind
[1:01:14] remember the carnal mind is at enmity
[1:01:16] with God don't look at it with your
[1:01:21] carnal mind I've seen families go
[1:01:28] through trials and some member of a
[1:01:31] family and they're going through a
[1:01:36] testing are they going to make God
[1:01:40] number one in their lives are they going
[1:01:43] to give up everything of the world
[1:01:47] because you know as humans many humans
[1:01:52] are tempted to try to hold on to
[1:01:54] everything they can hold on to and try
[1:01:56] to serve God at the same time and that
[1:01:58] won't work and God won't accept that and
[1:02:07] I've seen an individual for that way and
[1:02:10] God was testing them whether they would
[1:02:14] sell out sell out to God give away
[1:02:21] everything I'm not talking about
[1:02:26] material things
[1:02:31] and the family looked at it carnally mom
[1:02:37] and dad were looking at it carnally and
[1:02:39] they were serving God too well how can
[1:02:47] my son get right if he can't come here
[1:02:55] you get right wherever you are
[1:03:08] many of y'all know the testimony I might
[1:03:11] as well just quit dodging around it we
[1:03:14] all know the testimony my son-in-law
[1:03:15] David y'all loved him there was a time I
[1:03:19] kicked him out of the church because he
[1:03:24] was bringing a reproach upon the
[1:03:27] believers living one kind of life out
[1:03:32] there and then acting another life in
[1:03:35] church his family didn't understand it
[1:03:43] you know what God had to take everything
[1:03:46] from him everything the war he was left
[1:03:51] with nothing he told someone one time he
[1:03:58] after some years had passed he was out
[1:04:00] of church he said somebody because he
[1:04:04] David loves to hunt he said somebody is
[1:04:08] praying the deer off of me and he told
[1:04:13] him he says I remember some time when
[1:04:15] there was a man who prayed the deer up
[1:04:17] on my stand they said well that's the
[1:04:21] same one praying the deer off of you I
[1:04:29] wanted God to take everything don't even
[1:04:31] let him get no dear Lord
[1:04:38] he's a wonderful Christian today I loved
[1:04:43] him deeply you ever heard the same blood
[1:04:49] sticker in water and it's used a lot in
[1:04:53] the south
[1:04:56] well the way I interpret that is that
[1:05:00] they'll stand for their family make
[1:05:01] excuses for the wrong ear regardless of
[1:05:05] what they do because you know blood
[1:05:06] stick and water
[1:05:10] you can't come to Jesus with now I look
[1:05:14] Lord my family you know that's my family
[1:05:16] blood sticker in water he's not gonna
[1:05:19] accept that because tell me how family
[1:05:27] Bloods thicker than the blood of Jesus
[1:05:29] Christ that was shed for our sins goes
[1:05:33] that blood that blood shall never lose
[1:05:37] its power the greatest impression you'll
[1:05:50] have on your loved ones on people that
[1:05:56] you have testified to people that are
[1:05:59] watching your life the greatest
[1:06:01] impression you will have on them it's
[1:06:04] what you say in the mists of your
[1:06:06] darkest trials that's when Jesus made
[1:06:13] the greatest impression upon Peter
[1:06:20] Peter says this is in first Peter
[1:06:23] chapter 2 verses 24 what glory is it if
[1:06:30] when we be buffeted for your faults you
[1:06:33] shall take it patiently but if when you
[1:06:36] do well and suffer for it
[1:06:37] you take it patiently this is acceptable
[1:06:40] with God it's one thing he says when
[1:06:44] you're buffeted for your faults and you
[1:06:46] take it and say oh okay but when when
[1:06:54] you do well he said and suffer for it
[1:07:03] for even hereunto we were you called
[1:07:07] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:07:09] leaving us an example that you should
[1:07:12] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[1:07:16] was guile found in his mouth now listen
[1:07:19] what a great impression this made on
[1:07:21] Peter who when he was reviled reviled
[1:07:24] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:07:28] not but committed himself to him that
[1:07:32] judgeth righteously as he's saying Jesus
[1:07:37] didn't say you wait oh boy till I come
[1:07:38] into my kingdom and then you're gonna
[1:07:40] get it
[1:07:41] no he reviled not
[1:07:52] he died to reveal himself to us he died
[1:08:01] to self to reveal himself to us brother
[1:08:09] Branham says an inability of God he said
[1:08:11] now let us dies itself to reveal him to
[1:08:14] others Hebrews 12 and 2 says looking
[1:08:21] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:08:23] our faith who for the joy that was set
[1:08:25] before him endured the cross despising
[1:08:27] the shame he didn't despise the cross he
[1:08:32] embraced the cross the shame of the
[1:08:37] cross was that they were crucified naked
[1:08:39] he despised the shame but he embraced
[1:08:43] the cross he endured the cross and it
[1:08:46] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:08:48] of God for consider him that endured
[1:08:50] such contradiction of sinners against
[1:08:52] himself lest ye be wearied and faint in
[1:08:55] your minds
[1:08:57] you ever been going through a valley
[1:09:01] where you begin to become weary with it
[1:09:08] and you begin to become faint because of
[1:09:12] it it says will consider the
[1:09:15] contradiction of sinners against him
[1:09:17] when that happens James 1:12 says
[1:09:24] blessed is the man that endureth
[1:09:26] temptation for when he is tried that
[1:09:30] means when he's approved when it's his
[1:09:33] time to show the worth when he has tried
[1:09:38] he shall receive a crown of life which
[1:09:40] the LORD hath promised to them that love
[1:09:43] him the hour has come
[1:09:59] Matthew five and ten and said blessed
[1:10:01] are they which are persecuted for
[1:10:03] righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:10:05] kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when
[1:10:08] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:10:11] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:10:13] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:10:17] exceedingly glad boy it's not easy is it
[1:10:22] it's not easy to rejoice in the midst of
[1:10:25] when somebody's doing you wrong when
[1:10:30] you're being persecuted or all manner of
[1:10:34] evil is being spoke against you falsely
[1:10:38] how do you rejoice in the face of that
[1:10:41] it's what you're looking at said for
[1:10:46] your evil for great is your reward in
[1:10:49] heaven that's what you're looking at for
[1:10:54] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:10:56] were before you it's showing what
[1:10:58] company you're in it's showing your
[1:11:03] identification
[1:11:05] you see there's people that are gonna
[1:11:08] have to speak falsely of others there's
[1:11:12] people that's gonna have to persecute
[1:11:14] others they're gonna have to fulfill
[1:11:16] that part of the scripture I don't want
[1:11:20] to be fulfilling that part of the
[1:11:21] scripture I'd rather be fulfilling the
[1:11:24] one that's getting spoke falsely of the
[1:11:26] one that's being persecuted poor shows
[1:11:31] what group you're identifying with
[1:11:39] you're the salt of the earth but if the
[1:11:43] salt of loss is savour
[1:11:45] wherefore shall it be salted is since
[1:11:49] we're good for nothing but to be cast
[1:11:50] out and trodden under the foot of men be
[1:11:54] salty cause others to thirst so how to
[1:11:59] do it think of brother Jack Cole where
[1:12:05] the RAM spoke to him many times and I
[1:12:07] watched some films on his life
[1:12:11] and I also watch some films of him
[1:12:14] speaking and he gave a testimony about
[1:12:20] his mother that you know his mother kind
[1:12:23] of stood against him when he got saved
[1:12:25] and was going to church and so on but
[1:12:29] then he they were having these meetings
[1:12:31] and he invited his mom and dad to come
[1:12:34] to impressed upon him to come and in the
[1:12:40] face of all the opposition she gave him
[1:12:43] he kept on going but she came to this
[1:12:46] service and before they even had an
[1:12:50] altar call she made her way up to the
[1:12:52] front and this is what's stuck in my
[1:12:56] mind what she said she said I want what
[1:12:59] Jack's got she didn't know what it was
[1:13:03] but whatever it was in his life made her
[1:13:06] thirsty for it and she told the preacher
[1:13:09] I want what Jack Scott he are the light
[1:13:16] of the world let's see that's set up on
[1:13:19] a hill that cannot be hid we don't know
[1:13:25] who all is watching us we don't know who
[1:13:29] all is watching our conduct when you're
[1:13:33] in the hospital you don't know the lives
[1:13:35] that you may touch while you're in there
[1:13:38] what nurse or what doctor may see
[1:13:42] something you don't know doctors and
[1:13:49] nurses are not beyond saving
[1:13:54] there are people
[1:14:00] in Smyrna Church age whether ahem said
[1:14:02] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:14:05] no signs of God's disapproval neither
[1:14:12] are bright skies and still waters a sign
[1:14:14] of his love and approval whose approval
[1:14:17] on any of us is only in the beloved to
[1:14:21] the praise of the glory of His grace
[1:14:22] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:14:25] beloved his love is elective which he
[1:14:28] had for us from the foundation of the
[1:14:30] world
[1:14:30] does he love us yes but how shall we
[1:14:34] know we know because he said so and
[1:14:39] manifested he did love us where he
[1:14:41] brought us unto himself and gave us his
[1:14:44] spirit placing us as sons and how shall
[1:14:48] I prove my love to him by believing what
[1:14:50] he said by conducting myself with joy
[1:14:53] and missed the trials that he in his
[1:14:57] wisdom allows to come to pass James says
[1:15:07] my brother encountered all joy when you
[1:15:10] fall into divers temptations knowing
[1:15:13] this that that trying of your faith
[1:15:15] worketh patience but let patience have a
[1:15:19] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:15:21] tire and wanting nothing
[1:15:31] first Peter chapter 4 verse 12 beloved
[1:15:41] think it not strange concerning the
[1:15:42] fiery trials which is to try you as
[1:15:45] though some strange thing happened unto
[1:15:48] you don't think you're the only one
[1:15:52] that's going through it don't think
[1:15:56] you're the only one that's facing trials
[1:15:58] or think that yours is worse than
[1:16:02] anybody else's
[1:16:14] if we were be truthful with ourselves
[1:16:16] sometimes we could look around and see
[1:16:18] some things that others are facing
[1:16:19] that's a and I think man I'm glad that's
[1:16:22] not me facing that I need to pray for
[1:16:26] him rather than what I hear I've heard
[1:16:34] different times why is this happening to
[1:16:38] somebody else who would you wish it on
[1:16:46] we rejoice in so much as ye are
[1:16:48] partakers of Christ's suffering that
[1:16:51] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[1:16:52] be glad also with exceeding joy if you
[1:16:56] be reproached for the name of Christ
[1:16:58] happy are ye for the spirit of glory and
[1:17:02] of God rest upon you on their part he's
[1:17:07] evil spoken of but on your part he is
[1:17:09] glorified and that's something and that
[1:17:12] wonderful on your party is being
[1:17:15] glorified this the hour is come that he
[1:17:20] be glorified in you verse 19 says
[1:17:28] wherefore let them that suffer according
[1:17:31] to the will of God commit to keeping
[1:17:33] into the souls of him in well-doing as
[1:17:36] unto the faithful creator for this cause
[1:17:43] came I unto this hour
[1:17:51] Paul writes in first Corinthians and
[1:17:53] says there is no temptation taken you
[1:17:55] but such as common to man but God is
[1:17:57] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:17:59] tempted above that ye are able but will
[1:18:02] with the temptation also make a way of
[1:18:04] escape that you may be able to bear it
[1:18:07] he's not going to attempt you above what
[1:18:09] you're capable of we might at some time
[1:18:14] looking say boy I think I'm reaching my
[1:18:16] limits but he knows your limit and he's
[1:18:19] not gonna he's not going to tempt you
[1:18:22] above that you're able Paul says and
[1:18:24] he's going to provide a way of escape so
[1:18:27] that you can bear it not you're waiving
[1:18:31] scape but he'll provide a way
[1:18:43] first Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God
[1:18:48] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:51] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:18:53] has begotten us again unto lively hope
[1:18:56] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:18:59] the dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:19:02] and undefiled that fadeth not away
[1:19:05] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[1:19:08] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:19:10] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:19:13] last time we're in ye greatly rejoice
[1:19:17] though now for a season if need be
[1:19:19] you're in heaviness through manifold
[1:19:22] temptations that the trial of your faith
[1:19:24] being much more precious than gold that
[1:19:27] perishes though it be tried with fire
[1:19:30] might be found in to the praise and
[1:19:32] honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:19:34] Jesus Christ whom having not seen he
[1:19:38] loved in whom though now you see him not
[1:19:41] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:19:43] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[1:19:46] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:19:48] of your souls we're being kept by the
[1:19:52] power of God we've got an inheritance
[1:19:56] incorruptible undefiled and fadeth not
[1:19:58] away that is reserved for us in heaven
[1:20:09] often read this scripture here in second
[1:20:12] Corinthians chapter four verse eight we
[1:20:18] are troubled on every side yet not
[1:20:23] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:20:30] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:20:36] down but not destroyed
[1:20:39] hallelujah all these things but he is
[1:20:45] keeping us Paul says again for our light
[1:20:55] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:20:57] worketh in us a far more exceeding and
[1:21:00] eternal weight of glory while we look
[1:21:07] not on the things which are seen but on
[1:21:09] the things which are not seen for the
[1:21:10] things which are seen are temporal the
[1:21:13] things which are not seen are eternal
[1:21:19] ask them to come to the instruments
[1:21:27] the darker the trial the greater the
[1:21:32] test the greater he trusts you the
[1:21:43] things that came on job came not because
[1:21:45] job had disobeyed or felt God in any way

[1:22:03] said he was worth God see God said have
[1:22:09] you not considered my servant job
[1:22:11] there's none like him and all there see
[1:22:17] what God thought of him yeah the test is
[1:22:23] a lit garden you test so that he could
[1:22:26] find out whether you have faith or not
[1:22:28] he knows but many times is to let us see
[1:22:33] that we have the faith so we can put on
[1:22:41] display show our work your hour has come
[1:22:47] that time it was the hour of Jesus
