his mercy here this morning giving us another opportunity to be able to come together amen in the precious name of the lord jesus christ and the lord is so good to us last night amen what a what a wonderful service and a word that god brought to our hearts and you know the things that god does as soon as it resonates in our hearts the scripture says he's the high priest of our confession we begin to confess what god has already done for us it's settled and we we certainly expect just even for god that god is fulfilling his word i think it was so fitting last night i don't know if you caught it or not but i thought it was so fitting you know sometimes you look in a service and you can find in a service sometimes where there is something sometimes we have to press through things and there's things that you you notice other times it seems like things just so flows just so nicely and i looked at it last night i you know the young people here they were they had to start again and again and you say brother sam does that make you nervous no not a bit i was to me i was more proud that they stood there and said we're going to get this right you say why would that be because that's typical of a christian walk not every day goes right right as we have it planned or think about it and things come up and i thought it was so fitting last night with even how god brought the message and the message that was spoke because the things that was spoke to us god announcing that no matter what obstacle that you have in your way that god is greater than every obstacle greater than every situation and see god had that whole service he had it orchestrated it was arranged in everything that god does god doesn't do things by chance and so there's things that god permits to come along and it's it's an arrangement by god right here this morning while we're here we know there'll never be a gathering like this again some of us will be here some of us won't there'll never be a quite a gathering maybe just like this again but god is mindful and he has every bit of this arranged this who's supposed to be here is here and so we're just looking to the lord and i want to just welcome our visitors here this morning may god bless you and we just want you just to feel at home i want to just say before brother daryl comes we are very thankful that brother daryl made the sacrifice to be here with us this weekend and uh so thankful for that each of you as you made the sacrifice and throughout the times to be able to be here in these services and we had these these services that here and that are coming well we've had these planned out uh since uh may april and just to have these times just feeling on our heart and know that god is mindful of our need here this morning so whatever you have on your heart or the need in your life just just put it before god this morning and just invite him to say lord speak to my need because he he will come and he'll speak and minister personally to your need and when he does that just receive it just just receive what he has for you just let him just minister to you in a personal way this week perhaps as many of you know brother rowell soriano went on home to be with the lord and uh so that was when i we think of that that was quite a loss and um brother rowell was just going to be here in october 62 years old and for me to stand here i don't want to take the time away today perhaps there's other things at a different time that i'll share but what a great soldier a great general that has went on home to be with the lord just the things that as i expressed you here just a couple weeks ago when i was just putting things together to show you the pictures that where we had we had sent money as a congregation to raise up a a church there in pakistani and when we that that church that everything has been raised up but they don't have doors and they don't have windows and brother roell had just texted me here at the end of july and said brother samuel would you all be able to help this congregation now get the windows and the doors in because the brothers they worked all the way through you know they've had lockdowns like like it's nobody's business and so they've but they've worked all the way through it and even brother o'ell i had a i even had a an email or brother or well even during the whole time he titled the email i've got it he sent it in july evangelism during the pandemic and where you you see where there were there were lives where they were going out and ministering just as they had always and hearts and souls were coming to the lord and they were baptizing them in the name of the lord jesus christ and i just i remember opening that and looking at it and then of course you visit a lot of things you know as it comes along for me there's no way that i can in these few moments share with you of everything that you'd see that brother rowell is so connected with but the one thing that i do look at it when i begin to just look to the lord and i said lord you know you you never replace anybody you just don't say well this person here they went on and now they just replaced you don't replace anybody because god doesn't make carbon copies that's not god's way brother brown made it clear he said god doesn't run his business like a sears and rose road buck harmony house that's why god has palm trees oak trees and on and on and on but the one thing about it is it was just meditating in the office the one day and it just because this has laid so heavy on me this week and you know grieving within the the whole part of it there uh i just was just looking to the lord and the one thing the lord just spoke to my heart with on it within this is how that with brother o'ell you take a life that was just so yielded to god and what we see all everything that that was that was accomplished it was because of a life that was just yielded to god and what god had called him to do it was god who did everything through brother roell and brother rowell just allowed god to do it a lot of things that even brother oil did was very i would say unconventional in its thinking but god needed that and used that in order to reach and even to start those mystery expos where you had those different ones being worn to the lord that was outside of the box thinking but it was right in the mind of god to be able to reach that thousands and thousands of souls and i just always um you know i just not only appreciate brother rowell's uh his love and his zeal for the word of god but i also appreciated his humility his down to earth and you know you can just you just i always appreciated that that spirit about him uh you know and just we just we're definitely gonna miss him and uh we're missing even though you know he was here only one time out of the year and you know would be with us generally about a week or so but sister cynthia and the girls sister paula sister indy the whole church there the overcomer worship center and all the saints throughout the philippines they're really missing him and uh sister cynthia has just continued to convey that uh you know even texts and things that you know just a lot of the news that you have to get used to and so you just i know you've been praying for them just continue to hold them up in prayer that the lord will just just continue to be merciful to them and give them strength as well during this time amen we certainly we love brother rowell we just just appreciated his ministry and you know one by one we find out nine there's just there's more there on the other side and i believe we're really close i believe we're really close and i believe with all of my heart it's in the time like this may god help us not to lose focus amen we're right we're right at the final stretch we're right here we can see the finishing line it's the time not to lose our focus but to really be focused in and say lord help me be zeroed in with everything evaluate everything that comes across our pathway evaluate it just don't look at it and say well this is a blessing of god evaluate it if it's a blessing of god it'll draw me closer to god but if it's something that comes along that's good but it's not going to draw me closer to god then i can't call it a blessing of god so we we know as believers to discern these things and discern it our desire is to be closer to the lord amen like enoch he got so close one day finally god said you're closer here than you are there just come on home amen so this morning i just wanted to mention a few things to you like that and lord willing we'll be able to kind of talk a little bit with that of brother roell so the lord the lord willing here we have brother daryl to go ahead and come and i want to just we'll just sing a song and i think that would be fitting what paul you were closing out with jesus just draw me close i think that's a real that's that's a song to to think about here this morning and just to really have on our hearts jesus just draw us close and then draw us closer lord no matter what the need is just draw us closer no matter what the situation is draw me closer god said it so personally last night the answer is the lord jesus whatever whatever the situation is the lord jesus he's the answer you don't just have the answer he is the answer and you know god loves honesty god loves honesty [Music] when we can say in our hearts lord i'm feeling this way or this is how this is but lord i place it in your hands and i need you he'll come [Music] god is not ashamed he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he's a merciful and faithful high priest he can come right in this building today right where he's here he'll change your life for eternity come right to your life right now sickness you can change it from sickness unto life he's god he changes not amen any good brother william he's good amen let's just stand as we sing this song invite brother daryl to come just to have take his liberty here this morning how many want brother daryl just to take his liberty just take his liberty let god just have this have his way into service oh jesus [Music] [Music] made away [Music] this morning [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] to you [Music] away is [Music] foreign [Music] beautiful the bible says he knows every star god [Music] [Music] amen all right [Music] um [Music] he didn't have a house to go to but he never asked the father for a new change of clothes he never asked the father for a home or a chair to make the journey easier as he traveled to minister but the only thing he ever asked um [Music] but yet in the midst of all of it this has not took him by surprise [Music] this don't change his plans you know i didn't see this coming now i'm gonna have to read no no no no amen according to romans 8 28 it's all working for our good amen hallelujah can't you can't you serve a god like that french don't let the trials of life don't don't let the pressure that we're under don't let it discourage you amen don't lay your weapon down don't turn around and walk away we're too close now yeah right now just surrender to the mighty hand of god amen he'll carry us through it amen and sometimes when you need him the most he'll just do something so wonderful when my daughter was hurt in the accident and two of my family was killed and jessica suffered such a brain injury she couldn't swallow and the saliva would run out of her mouth and it made my wife so nervous her pillow and everything just stayed wet because she she her brain was so damaged she couldn't swallow and one night my wife was real down i said honey i said just why don't you go home and rest tonight i said i'll i'll stay here with her we've been staying at the hospital day and night i said just go home have some time to yourself she said well maybe i will i said sure honey just just go home i said if if anything happens i'll i'll call you so she went home and right around midnight they came in because jessica had also pneumonia she had aspirated when the train struck the car and set up pneumonia and so they was doing treatments breathing treatments and so they came in at midnight to give her a treatment just just just before midnight and jessica she goes [Music] and she started swallowing so the next morning i called my wife she said how she how's she doing i said oh she's doing better i said she started swallowing last night and cheryl started crying and she said i i guess you could tell i was down i said yes i saw that she said i had asked the lord to let jessica swallow before midnight and she said it was getting late and it looked like it wasn't going to happen but god rich in his mercy answered the prayer of the mother he's an all-time god yes he is may the lord bless you this morning if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of isaiah we want to read from isaiah 55 and verse 11 and become such an honor to be here we certainly appreciate brother samuel we just love fellowship and with him and he's the lord's blessed you with a great pastor i'll tell you that now he didn't tell me to say that i just that's just that's for me i certainly appreciate brother samuel he's a wonderful brother and his family and may the lord richly bless you and we trust he'll be some testimonies from the lord and what he's done for you and amen amen may the lord bless you isaiah 55 and we want to read from verse 11. thank you lord for your goodness isaiah 55 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i send it amen let's bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on no turning back amen heavenly father lord we just love you today we want to thank you for your mercy and your goodness to us lord and father i wouldn't trade 10 million dollars for what i feel in my heart right now knowing lord that that what you have done for us will last throughout eternity lord i pray that they would be some here this morning maybe nervous lord slaughter as we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of 9 11 and lord it's been on the news and everywhere people begin to remember that day and lord maybe summer may be down or a little weary or nervous of the things that's happening lord but oh god may we not look to none of that lord but may we just look to you and i pray today that your word would speak to their hearts lord father god realizing that heavens and earth will pass away yet thy word shall never fail lord you are our healer and you are our deliverer lord the symptoms has nothing to do with it thy word is true lord and i pray father god that great signs and wonders would be wrought here at the hands of the believers for this is our our lord of the manifestation of the sons of god that once more lord this world will know that thou art the same yesterday today and forever lord we commit the service into your hands this morning for your glory for we ask it in jesus name and the bride says god bless you saying she may be seated i want to share a quote with you brother bryan says now job was a man that carried out god's commandments to the letter exactly and satan knew that but he said if you'll just let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face so god told him he said now he's in your hands but don't you take his life and satan even stretched that as far as he could on that but no matter how far satan stretched that he could not take his life because god said so he said do with him what she will but do not take his life and the father said the prophet said that satan stretched that as far as he could stretch that yet he could not take his life he took every friend and everything that he had almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life but job still helped right on see there was no turning back you see when a man or a person has once really come into contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that god is well that's what we need this morning is to have an understanding of god is amen not god was not god will be but what god is right now hallelujah there is nothing no time nowhere that could ever separate that man from his god i believe it was paul said there's no strife no hunger no pearls neither living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus you are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life [Music] we are here because god placed us here for such a time as this amen and god never placed us here to fail but he put us here that we would overcome amen and i want the devil to know this morning we've got the answer to every question amen we are not an organization we are not a denomination but we are his body on the earth in this hour amen hallelujah you're anchored in him because you are ordained to that life oh hallelujah you can't fail no more than god can fail job stayed with the word because he knew the word would not fail amen and no amen nothing can keep god's word from accomplishing that which it's set to do the prophet said god's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing that can defeat it so how happy we are to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there's neither things that the present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate god's immortal eternal plan hallelujah it must be as god said [Applause] hallelujah the things the prophet of god told us back in the 60s and the 50s and the 40s the things he prophesied of listen for us we're not reading the quotes no more we're living them can you understand you're in the vision [Applause] you are what he saw amen he saw a bribe with a spotted blemish brother dale what do you reckon he saw he saw me he saw you amen amen we know there's going to be a bride there's going to be a bride i said there's not going to be i say there's one here right now and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky it's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word amen we know that those things are going to make up we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church they're going to appear before him with that spot or wrinkle listen to the rest of this quote and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready it's not something that's going to come one day what we need for this rapture hallelujah what we need for the changing of our bodies it's not something that's going to come one day it's here now among us the material to make this bride the material to fulfill what god had in his mind before the foundation of the world concerning his church hallelujah it's here the word is here the anointing is here to manifest the word oh hallelujah that'll make a baptist shelter amen [Applause] oh thank you lord hallelujah they have the material on the earth now to make themselves ready no turning back no going down listen friends we're not going down we're going up oh well they're going to tighten it up they're going to mandate this and they're going to mandate that let them do what they will they'll never shut us up amen we have the material to bring that into manifestation sister years ago down south carolina she wrote a song called a stronger wind than this she says strong winds are blowing with an unrelented force people are running to and fro they don't know what's going on men's hearts are failing there is turmoil in the land church doors are closing preachers just can't take a stand but then she said but it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promise it's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around it's going to take a stronger wind than this hallelujah to keep this eagle down hallelujah i was born for the heavens i was predestinated to fly there is no wind that'll hold me down amen [Applause] jesus constantly said fear not fear not fear not what do you reckon he's trying to get us to do fear not i am he that was dead and in my life forever nor fear not i am with thee always even to the end of the world fear not don't fear i'm here that's dead but i'm alive forevermore the prophet of god said he loved his disciples he loved sunsets he loved to sit around the campfire said peter tell me a good fishing story who don't like a good fishing story tell me a good fishing story he loves life but sitting there around the campfire loving his brothers he realized samuel the only way they can live is for me to die i have to pay the price if i don't they'll die there'll be an end to them oh my when i saw that quote and i saw that picture in my mind i tell you i got so happy because i remember on that resurrection morning he rose he said hallelujah because i live ye shall live also [Applause] amen everybody said christians keep sitting back i just wonder my turn loose he says get all the things away from you say mr satan you are defeated jesus christ stripped you of every power you had when he died at calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and you can't bluff me amen i am made out of stuff that don't bluff [Applause] [Music] amen just step aside i'm moving on for christ god will take care of his own all things work together to the good to them that love him he moves on nothing that can happen in this world can stop god's word from being fulfilled what he's imagined in his mind what he has purposed in his heart he will bring the past well i don't know what we're going to do trump didn't get elected listen to me for his trump body don't make no difference that's not the one that we need to look to trump is not the savior biden is not the savior but jesus christ amen is the answer glory to god [Applause] people all get caught up in politics and divide and fuss and fight don't you understand that's exactly what satan wants to do if he can't divide us over skin color he'll divide us over politics if he can divide us over politics he'll divide us over vaccination come on somebody but we are one in the lord we are a body on the earth do not let them separate us stay with his word [Applause] amen no turning back well they say he might shut her church down shut it down we'll have it out in the yard this ain't the church anyway you're the church i was down to tucson a few years ago brother baker's meeting the very day the meeting started some young boys broke the window threw something into the church and set it on fire the very day the meetings were to start the church caught on fire and burnt so brother baker quickly found a place down in town at a theater we went down there that night had the folk tonight i had to preach people were there their church had been birthed that morning and i told them i said you know i heard that love divine tabernacle was on fire and i said they told me they got it put out but i'd like the devil to know that the church of love divine is still burning tonight amen hallelujah the building may be put out but the fire that burns in our soul there is no devil there is no demon there is no organization that can stop that hallelujah that could stop that fire from burning burn burn holy spirit burn in me y'all pray for me i'm getting old paul and silas was preaching the gospel they were wrecking havoc on the devil and the devil got so mad that he had him through in jail oh my you know i got to thinking about that that's what we need to be doing what we need to be doing is make the devil mad [Music] you've seen people get so mad they go insane we are to drive the devil out of his mind we ought to make him so mad oh my you need to get you a t-shirt or a coffee cup say i was born to make the devil mad they made the devil so mad amen he had them beaten he had them thrown into the inner part of the prison shackled to the floor fed bread and water [Music] satan saute right now that'll cool them off yeah that'll shut them up that'll cool them down they'll turn back now i thought this gospel is going to be easy thought it's going to be a picnic huh i'll have you beat within an inch of your life you preach that stuff around here paul and silas in the internet they wasn't on the outer court of the prison there's on the inner court back here where the rats are big real big i hear silas you know they beat them almost unconscious their backs swollen and bruised and shirts stuck to the bloody wounds and silas might have come to himself you know just groaned a little bit maybe it's time to realize where he was at and then paul over the next cell this name kind of stirred him and he raised up a little bit shackles on his hands and his feet and his back bloody and beaten he send them over here silas i'm here what are we going to do paul what we're going to do i'm some sore i'm bloody paul who's going to get us out what's going to happen to us paul looked around and said i'll tell you what it's going to take a stronger wind than this [Applause] give me a seed for christ [Music] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them hallelujah i'm one of them a few doors down you know some of the prisoners hey quieting down up there this is sunday morning we're supposed to be relaxed silas said my goodness i guess we made him upset what are we going to do paul you want to you want to do sign language paul said no sing louder hallelujah and there they were paul you know being the church age messenger no doubt he's saying lead silas may be whining a little bit he might have sunk dinner but god was looking down in the banister of time and god said that's my boys down there and god came down and he said i'm going to sing bass there's something about family harmony oh hallelujah and god came down and began to shake that prison house and the chains began to come off [Music] [Applause] shut the walls down to the prison house so i've come to receive your praise your backs against the wall praise his name you feel you can't go out just raise your hands and say greater is he that is in me [Applause] we live in a nation of freedom thank god we got freedom of speech we certainly have but probably said the first thing you know is they'll try to stop all this you know they asked the holocaust survivor he said how did you allow this to happen to your people you know what he said it was so subtle right they came in and just began to change a few laws and we thought oh well you know that's not so bad it'll blow over in a year or so he said then there's a few others and done something else something else and he said it was only when we had to wear the star out on the street to go to the mark to show our star that we was different than the other people only then that we realized we were in trouble friends we enjoy freedom thank god we live in a great country we've got our problems but it's still the greatest country on this earth amen but the prophecy the first thing you know is they'll try to stop all this they'll take our freedom from us so subtle they'll try to quit praying they'll try to quit praying for the sick and put a band on it and just remember when the persecution rises the church comes to its very height then it's always at its best oh brother all this is happening what's going to happen to the church i'll tell you what's going to happen it'll be our finest hour hallelujah amen no matter what they do remember god is working it all together for our good according to romans 8 28 all things work to the good amen all things then no matter what they try to do god will turn it around and make it for your good somehow [Applause] god working it all together jesus said my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my head my father which gave them me is greater than all you need to put that on your refrigerator no you need to take soap and write it on your mirror when you get up in the morning to wash your face right there on your mirror you need to see it my father is greater than them and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand there's not a wind strong enough there's not a devil big enough there's not a situation great enough that's able to shut this bride down we are god's covenant people you are the covenant people of god god tore christ apart at calvary making the covenant swearing by himself and he took the body up into heaven which will return someday but the spirit he gave back to lead the church the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church tonight by the holy ghost doing and acting and performing the same things he did when he was here on earth you've received that you have got the covenant we are a covenant people god swore by himself he swore by himself that nobody no government no pandemic nothing can take you out of my hand [Applause] here a few years ago up in north carolina there's a place called ruff ridge you get up there you can see all over north carolina it's beautiful you ever get up that way y'all take it it's called rough ridge uh we was up there a few years ago when my youngest daughter ali she's just a little girl at that time and we were coming back down in the it's so high up that the clouds are always up on the mountain it's always wet so it's kind of slippery i was leaning away you know because i'm the daddy i was leading the way ali's right behind me i got two girls one talks one don't so when one talks you know who it is it's allie she must get that after her mama i'm not sure about that no that's not true that's not true [Laughter] make you laugh a little bit we was coming down the trail and i stepped off of this rock down onto the ground and ali was right behind me i knew it was hurt i could hear her and i don't know why but i just reached around and took her by the hand cause she's up above me i stepped off that rock and she's about right and i just reached up into and i no sooner put my hand in hers than her feet when i from under her from that wet rock and the look of horror on her face oh my it would have went viral on youtube the look of her on her face but i just swung her probably what's wrong with my back i just swung her around and set her right down and that horror turned to the biggest smile you ever see in your life and i said to her i said ain't you glad daddy had a hold of your hand she goes down through the trails you hit listen to me for his it's a slippery time oh my it's a dark time it's a time of uncertainty but ain't you glad this morning that daddy's got a hold of my hand amen [Applause] i worked the surgery when jessica got hurt when i went back to work i worked in surgery and i went back to work i was out of scrub seat scrubbing in for a case and dr gould he was an anesthesiologist and he came up to me i worked for the government so let's call you by your last name and he said ward i said hey buddy he said i want to ask you something he said i've seen you come in so tired from preaching couldn't hardly put one foot in front of the other work all day said you went through all that and you've done all that traveling and all that preaching and stuff and then god allowed this to happen to your family he said i want to ask you did you keep your religion i thought thank god for quotes [Applause] and i said no sir i didn't i said my religion kept me [Applause] he said i thought you would say that oh aren't you glad friends that sometimes we get weary we get even preachers they get tired they get down sometimes is that true brother said we get weary but in our lowest moments guess what he's still got a hold of our hand amen it's written to you it's sworn by god you can't fail and that makes the devil mad it sure does when you realize who you are realizing who you are makes the devil mad then you need to remind him every morning i'm the blood-bought son of the living god his blood flows through my veins my genetics come from god amen there is no turning back if you get down if you get weary look in the back of the book guess what we win amen amen well brother i've been don't look at the battle right listen we may lose a battle now and then but we've already won the war and when you win the war the battles don't matter amen so if you get tired you get weary look in the back of the book we win don't come through those doors like losers we are not losers we are winners satan is the loser he's the one that's cast into the lake of fire not us he's going down we're going up don't focus on the battle focus on the war amen years ago my father-in-law he worked for eastman chemical company and had a little intramural softball league inside the company so he had a little team he asked me to play on it because when i was younger i was on a state championship softball team pitch for him so he wanted me to play of course i was playing outfield at that at that time with with him and so down at eastman there was a big water tank and there's a guy working on it and this certain team was playing and these guys were standing out in the outfield and the guy on the tank he could see the ball team he could see the ball game so he was up there supposed to be working on the tank but he's watching the game and those guys out there in the outfield the pitcher would pitch the ball and crack they just and it got so bad that the outfielder you know i guess it's getting hot out there he had his glove on top of his head and every time he hit the ball just and the guy up on the tank he yelled down he said hey buddy what's the score and the guy said it's seven to nothing he said y'all losing ain't you he said i don't know we ain't batted yet oh hallelujah i want the devil to know we've not even stepped up to the plate yet we're just warming it up amen because i want the devil to know we are the home run queen [Applause] hallelujah we see home just ahead and we're running right towards you we're a little bride we're running our last smile home don't get weary don't give up when i was in the army i ran cross country now i can't run across the street but that's a different story i ran cross country with a i was on the 18th airborne corps cross country team and i had a friend of mine he was the coach of the team his name was ernest hemingway iii that's what i thought oh my what a name my name's daryl you know he was earnest even the third but this guy could run so i was running this 10 mile 10 6.2 mile 10k run and it was about the last stretch of the run and i was so tired i was starting to fall back and all of a sudden out in the woods which he really wasn't supposed to do that but he was he was out there and all of a sudden i heard this voice begin to say run ward run the finish line is just ahead it's just over the next hill don't quit now kick it in kick it in run run and oh my it just inspired me and i began i started beginning passing people and i said to you little bride don't give up now there's just one more hill on the home and we have a cloud of witnesses that's telling us you can do it you can make it amen don't turn back don't give up don't quit now [Applause] amen run with everything that's in you isaiah said no weapon that's formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and the righteousness is of me saith the lord satan gets to howling gets to blow in his poison breath the winds get to blowing stronger just remember this eagles were built to take strong winds the harder the wind the higher they fly the harder the trial the stronger the wind the greater we fly eagles are a special built bird amen hallelujah he can go where hawks can't go oh they can go up so far but the wind turns them back the out at the altitude turns them back but not the eagle he can fly higher and higher because his genetics says he can do it you see the strong wind actually vindicates who he really is you know they used to take the wheat and the chaff you know how they separated it how they used to do it in the days of ethiopia they would throw it up into the wind and the wind would separate the child from the wheat so the strong wind blowing does two things it separates the chaff but it gathers the wheat together oh god amen a prophet said that the eagle's a special bird to take this food he has to be made up to go into those atmospheres there's another thing about him in order to get up there he has to have strong wings his feathers won't fly out of him because he can't see other birds of their feathers that fly out of them they can't stand when they get up there but the old eagle can soar with another bird kate 100 yards off the ground without flopping himself to death he thought they said you know that's right they'll just beat the air and punch an old crane or something bumping up and down trying to ride the waves and stagger over where an eagle just sets his wings and rides on the wind his feathers are strong they don't move they don't give he just maneuvers his body and he sells away and that's the way of every believer he doesn't run from pillar to post from place to place methodist this week baptist next one this week another the next he just sets his faith in god's eternal word and he sails away riding on the waves of the air oh just look at those great big wings that god has given us take your stand amen stand there upon the rock when you really realize that god has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it you're absolutely undefeatable you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you jesus the body but the word that was in him not mary but the word that was born from her it's not this flesh that's undefeatable but it's what's on the inside of me that deposit that my father placed in me there's not a wind strong enough i think of the three hebrew children shadrach meshach bendigo and it was mandated by the government everyone would bow before this image or be burned in the fire king said whenever you hear a harp a horn a guitar what piano whatever any kind of instrument you hear when you hear that sound you are to bow your knee to this image and the prophet said it was actually an image of daniel the prophet i said now what are you boys going to do is it old king you blow all the horns you want to blow you pass all the mandates you want to pass we will not bow to the image some trust in chariots some trust in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god my trust is not in my ability my trust is in the one who gave me the promise the name of the lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into and they are safe he said well we'll see what happens here you boys want to mess with us we'll show you who we are we'll test out this holy ghost religion you've got we'll see what it does i'll tell you what we're going to do we're going to burn it out of them i got news for the devil it's been tried many times amen you can't burn the holy ghost out of somebody you can't take fire and burn the holy ghost out of somebody it's fire itself [Applause] hallelujah hebrews 12 29 says our god is a consuming fire and the fire of god will consume anything that the devil tries to bring against his people [Applause] yes sir that's right they tried to pull it out of john couldn't boil it out of him in hot grease you can't boil it out you can't scare it out you can't run it out you can't stomp it out you can't put it out you can't blow it out it's here to stay there is no turning back so they heated up this furnace seven times hotter than ever before no king nebuchadnezzar you know this priestly robes and said we're gonna watch them now boys we're going to watch them scream and they're going to recant now or they're going to bow now hey boys give you one more chance before i put you in there you want to bow you want to come under this mandate that we're mandating to you no turning back i don't know what my god will do but there's one thing i do know he is able to do it think of this in their haste to burn god's people they killed their own people throwing them in the fire think of that satan oh god satan will destroy his old kingdom trying to destroy this bride but he will never do it all the fire did they threw them in the fire it killed the people that threw him in there and the only thing the fire did was loosen their bands so they could shake hands with the fourth man all it did was open up the bill oh all it did was open up an opportunity for fellowship and many times god will allow things to come into your life to open up an opportunity to show you how big he is [Applause] thank you lord i like that i think of the disciples out on the sea that night they were having a testimony service you know it'd be it'd be a lot better off if we testified about the goodness of god instead of complained about our problems that's right you get too many amens out of there but and satan thought that they were on their own because he didn't see jesus around but just remember just because you can't see him doesn't mean he ain't there put that right underneath that other one i told you to put on your fridge just because satan couldn't see him didn't mean he wasn't watching and satan said i'll drown the whole bunch i've got them right where i want them now i'll drown a whole bunch of them and he began to breathe and blow out of his nostrils the prophet said a great powerful wind of his poison breath and it hit the sea and the sea became a nervous prostration and he said and sin from satan will make anything have a nervous prostration and that's the reason we got so many nervous breakdowns and so much the insane institution that's filled up they're not in the institution no more they're running the government the world has gone insane i was in atlanta airport the other day and a guy come walking through the airport like this he had a robe from here to his to to the shoes was dragging the ground looked like count dracula wow i sent that to my wife look at this but the funny thing was the guy that was sitting over there with the ball cap people's going insane amen and so he probably said sin from satan don't make anything have a nervous prostration that's the reason so many nervous breakdowns institutions filled up when people get to running through a 30 mile an hour zone 90 miles an hour squealing their tires and burning the rubber off of their tires turning corners and go 15 foot and turn off in front of you is that not the truth it happens all the time you think where in the world are you going right right like mcdonald's gonna run out of a cheeseburger or something it's insane people you can't even look at somebody in a red light you're afraid they're gonna shoot you over road rage insanity they're in a nervous neurotic state they don't know what to do and all the world is nervous and upset they don't know where they're standing they join one church and then they run to another church and let a little every little thing run in here and run in there running to and fro it's because that satan has begun to push out his poison breath he's beginning to blow his wind of strife breaking churches apart separating brotherhood making people think they're a little bit better than somebody else they belong to a better bracket they belong to a better church all tactics of satan to break our fellowship it didn't happen out there it's happening among our own ranks people are pulling come on friends they're dividing their self they're pulling themselves against preachers or tapes only and preachers and oh my what is it it's satan's poison breath trying to break up the brotherhood but he'll never stop this bride amen the prophet said there's only one church and that's the church of jesus christ she stands on the unveiling word of god and the winds got so contrary and the boat was all waterlogged full of water and the cells were torn and the oars were breaking and the great white caps the prophet of god said one place 20 foot high just rose up and swept the little boat from one way to the other and all hope was gone and when all hope was gone after they was pressed from one wave to the other but jesus was sitting high up on the mountain and the prophet of god said he was watching them the whole time he watched satan begin to blow he lets the waves begin to rise he watched the cells tear and the oars broke and you know what he said no doubt he stood up and said i'll tell you right now it's going to take stronger wind than this and right in the midst of that great storm yes yes jesus come walking on the water amen maybe you're in a great storm right now friends i don't know maybe you're going through the hardest time of your life right now but listen to me do not focus on the storm focus on the one who walks on the waters he walks on the waters of our storms remember what peter said peter said lord if it's you bid me to come he said come and peter stepped out of the boat and started walking on the water himself as long as he looked at jesus as long as he looked at jesus as long as his focus was upon jesus the storm had no power over him but when he began to look at the wind and the waves when he got his eyes off the promise he began to sink listen to me friends no matter how strong the wind is no matter how much it blows keep your focus on christ stay with let me say this things are happening in this hour the sin of this age i want the devil to know it'll take a stronger wind than this because you see jesus said we're going to the other side yes did he not say that get in the boat we're going to go to the other then where are they going do the other side why he said so there ain't no way big enough they ain't nowhere strong enough to stop god's word from coming to pass no turning back satan ain't got to win he ain't got a plague he ain't got a storm he ain't got a fire he ain't got a trial that'll stop this bride oh hell cannot stop it it's ordained of jesus christ to be so and it will be so upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her but she will prevail over them amen amen balak tried to get balaam to curse god's people but he couldn't turn them back israel had come this way there was no need to try to stop them because god doesn't promise them the land they were going over there's no need to try to stop defense i want the devil to know he will fail all his tactics will fail amen we are moving just the same we are going on just the same no turning back because i want you to know i want you to hurry i want you to know we are moving on but we are not alone we are never alone the bible says for he saith i will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen no matter what we go through we do not go through it alone jesus christ god's son who's the architect of the church he come to this earth and laid down the foundation when he met the devil he was tested by the word and he said it's written men shall not live by bread alone when he took him to the pinnacle of the temple he said it's written see the material look at the material he was putting in his church not emotion not sensation but thus saith the word of god the bride doesn't stand on emotion she doesn't stand on sensation she stands on the word of god the promise that he's given us will not fail us took him to the mountain and showed him all the great programs he could have he said it's written all the word of god was time tested he's the great captain that's going before us with his own bloody coat waving but to the redeemed brought by the blood of jesus christ he has bought a church by the holy spirit that's tested every boat and every person that's ever anchored in this great church of the living god it's a time-tested material amen david said whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence for thou earth to her if i ascend up into heaven the heart there if i make my bed in hell thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell into the other most parts of the sea thou art there even thou shalt thou hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me ain't you glad daddy's got to hold him with him on the mountain the heart there when i'm in a valley that worked there in the good times thou art there in the hard times thou art there in my joy thou art there in my sorrow thou art there in my despair thou art there when i'm shouting the church down thou art there when i feel lonely like there's no one else within a thousand miles of me thou art there yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me [Music] the architect that made jesus what he was has made you what you are satan is defeated he knows he's on the earth he's going like a roaring lion he's going like he's not a roaring lion but he acts like a roaring lion it isn't long till he's finished let me read that again listen devil it isn't long until he's finished and he knows his time he knows his time you just need to remind him of it he's going like a roaring lion but remember the prince of peace stands by the great divine one the architect of my being the architect who built me what i am who built you what you are is here if the architect knows how to put the building together it's right place who knows better than the architect he's here to prove himself he's here now it's based upon your faith it's based upon your faith what do you believe what did he say over and over again when they come to jairus and said you're too late your little girl's dead trouble not the master anymore jesus gave us the antidote to such negative words he touched jairus on the shoulder and he said only believe that's all he ever said to do was belief amen the stabilizers has been put on the ship the great fearful waves are out there before us but we know just beyond the wave yonder we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word no turning back you see all the clouds and the storms around us and brothers it's flu they'll tell you i've got on a plane before and it'd be dark clouds and rain and the wind blowing and that plane will rattle and shake but all of a sudden it'll break through the clouds and when it breaks through guess what's up there the sun it's shining just as bright as it and remember friends no matter how great the storm is just on the other side of the clouds is the sun the s-o-n hallelujah hallelujah our stabilizer is right in the word god said it would be here we'll crash every wave we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in a grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling on the other side we're anchored in jesus the storms of life i'll brave i've anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave no turning back let the storms come let the fire come let the plagues come let fear come let death come let persecution come there's no turning back we are pressing on he's here with us friends we will crest every wave this old ship of zion will not go down satan says we're going down satan says he's going to sink us satan says the pressure's too great there's too much division there's too much happening you need to turn back you need to quit church you need to you know it's his eating he's going to reign he tries to convince us that's his report it's too hard it's too great there's too much trouble there's so much disappointment this has happened

supposed to put the glasses on the chair the handkerchief on the bed who's supposed to be in the room all those things that were a part of the vision everything must come into its place and what a comfort it is to know that the same god who gave the vision is the same god who does the leading that everything will come right into its position and oh god in the fulfillment of your word lord we thank you father your god how that lord even here in these services how you've spoke to our hearts lord different needs lord and you've spoke so personally you've come down lord to speak to every area
