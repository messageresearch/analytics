[38:07] minister to every need
[38:09] in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:12] amen and amen
[38:16] God bless you musicians thank you
[38:17] tonight
[38:20] amen
[38:22] Job chapter 22 and I'm going to go back
[38:24] to the verse and scriptures that we've
[38:27] read the other night and
[38:30] just want to kind of move forward a
[38:32] little bit more as the Lord will help us
[38:34] on this thought
[38:36] and we begin speaking on this thought
[38:38] last week and
[38:40] just as the Lord would press upon our
[38:41] hearts that is on a useful life a useful
[38:46] life
[38:48] in job 22 verse 1.
[38:52] then he life as the team and I'd
[38:54] answered and said
[38:57] can a man be profitable unto God
[39:02] as he
[39:03] that is wise may be profitable unto
[39:07] himself
[39:08] is that any pleasure to the almighty
[39:10] that thou art righteous
[39:13] or is it gained to him that thou makeest
[39:15] thy ways perfect
[39:17] will he reprove thee for fear of Thee
[39:20] will he enter with thee
[39:22] into judgment may God bless you bless
[39:25] the reading of the word as you're being
[39:27] seated
[39:29] I want to just draw our attention to
[39:33] this word in verse 2.
[39:36] that's a pretty
[39:38] it's a pretty big question
[39:40] can a man be profitable unto God as
[39:44] he that is wise may be profitable
[39:48] unto himself
[39:50] now we all know as we look at it in this
[39:53] scripture as it would speak it's
[39:56] it's actually saying in this way if you
[39:58] allow me to paraphrase it in this in
[40:00] this manner or to just place the words
[40:02] out for us can a man be useful
[40:05] be of a service to God as he that is
[40:08] wise
[40:09] wherein his wisdom would be useful to
[40:11] himself
[40:13] and I think of our wisdom how is our
[40:15] wisdom useful to ourselves how many
[40:17] times that we have talked with
[40:19] someone else and we can just speak of
[40:21] this even in the natural
[40:23] there's a lot of times that even since
[40:25] um my dad has went on home to be with
[40:28] the Lord I've had to call a lot of times
[40:29] different Brothers in the church and ask
[40:32] them how do I do this how do I approach
[40:34] this I know we got YouTube videos but
[40:36] sometimes YouTube Just it doesn't beat
[40:38] the in flesh thing
[40:40] and so when I ask certain things because
[40:43] there's little things that even as
[40:44] they're instructing you and we all know
[40:46] how the YouTube video is we look for the
[40:48] shortest one let's get to the point on
[40:50] this but there's things we like to know
[40:52] because there's things that one might be
[40:54] able to share with us in the midst of
[40:56] that time not only are they instructing
[40:58] or helping us to be able to do a job but
[41:01] also to help us to know these are some
[41:03] things I've learned these are some
[41:05] things that'll make it easier these are
[41:06] some things that can help out and that
[41:08] wisdom that we receive from someone else
[41:10] benefits us it benefits our life
[41:14] and so this is how the question that's
[41:17] being asked can a man be profitable unto
[41:19] God as he that is wise may be profitable
[41:23] unto himself and we remember looking at
[41:26] this last week and I maybe to Define
[41:29] that word profitable just for a moment
[41:32] it means to be of use or to be of a
[41:34] service to be of a prophet to one or a
[41:37] benefit to be used or exhibit you sir
[41:40] show harmony with be familiar with or to
[41:43] know intimately can a man be profitable
[41:46] unto God just like that as he that would
[41:49] have wisdom and be that wisdom would be
[41:51] useful to himself and remember what our
[41:54] what our answer was last week the answer
[41:56] is
[41:57] yes
[41:58] and no
[42:02] because
[42:03] they're like the scripture says from the
[42:05] book of Isaiah Paul would pick it up in
[42:07] the book of Corinthians who hath known
[42:10] the mind of the Lord that he may
[42:12] instruct him
[42:14] job even understood this even as he
[42:16] would express it here in in in in in the
[42:20] Book of Job
[42:21] so we understand it's not us telling God
[42:25] and God doesn't want us to tell him what
[42:27] to do and we looked at certain examples
[42:29] even of that
[42:31] in last week and God doesn't need he
[42:35] doesn't need our help our thoughts about
[42:38] things or about how to run his program
[42:42] and that's that's one of the greatest
[42:44] things in victories
[42:47] that comes into our life and that we
[42:49] must continue to live by that sometimes
[42:52] that's a
[42:53] that's that's easier done in one life
[42:57] maybe than another and it doesn't raise
[42:59] one life or lower one life but within it
[43:01] all the thing that we come to
[43:04] continually daily and Moment by moment
[43:07] is we are continually brought back to
[43:10] dying daily to ourselves that God might
[43:14] have his way
[43:16] and the reality of real of maturity
[43:18] you've heard me say this over and over
[43:20] that real maturity is not something to
[43:23] wear that we become more self-sufficient
[43:27] more independent but real maturity is
[43:30] recognizing the god that's in US
[43:34] and submitting ourselves to him
[43:37] and anytime we get out of that realm is
[43:40] where we get in trouble right those are
[43:42] the things we get out into and we've got
[43:44] to say forgive me right whether it's
[43:47] someone else or to the Lord and this is
[43:49] why real Victory is living from that
[43:52] Victory on the inside
[43:54] and so when we see this God's desire is
[43:59] to use a man for his glory not that the
[44:03] man would get Glory because remember
[44:05] brother says God has a hard time getting
[44:08] a hold of a man using that man and then
[44:11] that in itself keeping him in a place of
[44:15] humility
[44:16] that's why the brother Brandon would
[44:18] admonish us concerning where Paul was in
[44:22] the dust uh on the road to Damascus and
[44:25] he says You must never ever rise above
[44:30] that dust on the road to Damascus in
[44:33] other words we're not walking around
[44:35] with uh uh I'm going to say it in the
[44:38] right way we're not walking around with
[44:40] the thought of I'm nothing I can do
[44:42] nothing because let me just tell you
[44:44] what that is that's false humility
[44:47] that's called Pride
[44:50] we just want to expose the devil is that
[44:52] right sometimes we get in this oh I
[44:54] can't do nothing we really don't believe
[44:55] that I really can't do nothing I can't
[44:57] do but see that's not what what it is
[44:59] this is what that's what brother random
[45:01] tells us that that's where we make
[45:03] excuses for our weaknesses when all God
[45:07] wants us to do is to acknowledge Him in
[45:10] his presence and surrender him
[45:14] Hallelujah and God doesn't come to strip
[45:17] the weaknesses away from our life he
[45:19] says I just want them to be channels
[45:21] that my strength can come through
[45:26] so God desires to use man for his glory
[45:30] and his desires that we would surrender
[45:33] ourselves and yield Our Lives to the
[45:36] working of his program
[45:39] hey go back to these scriptures here
[45:41] that we were looking at last week
[45:43] because this is the same uh individual
[45:46] and I would just lay this down once
[45:49] again just this little bit this is the
[45:51] same individual in life as that is
[45:54] speaking to job and here in the previous
[45:56] chapter he said something very similar
[45:59] behold speaking of God behold he puteth
[46:03] no trust in his Saints
[46:07] yea the heavens are not clean in his
[46:10] sight
[46:11] and there is there's truth in there but
[46:14] remember it's important that truth is
[46:17] applied correctly
[46:20] because if we are his Saints remember we
[46:24] were always his Saints from the mind of
[46:26] God
[46:28] so we we always were a part of God then
[46:31] what is God putting trust in because
[46:34] remember this is only a veil can I say
[46:37] the words of the prophet he said what we
[46:40] do when we fellowship with one another
[46:42] we're not fellowshipping with this we're
[46:45] fellowshipping with the attribute of God
[46:48] in one another
[46:50] that's brothers and sisters it's not
[46:53] this it's that on the inside that's a
[46:56] part of the same family tree
[46:59] it's that part on the inside that God
[47:02] has confidence in
[47:08] behold job 4 18 it's the same same
[47:11] brother he lifes behold he put no trust
[47:15] in his servants well in one way this
[47:18] film take a rocket scientist but it's
[47:21] his Saints his servants God has already
[47:24] laid claim on them
[47:26] they are the Sanctified ones by his
[47:30] presence
[47:31] we are his servants by his working for
[47:36] his glory
[47:38] this is why think of the messages
[47:39] brother random would preach my servant
[47:41] David my servant job him would preach
[47:44] just those messages titled in that way
[47:47] because it is God's servants
[47:50] that's what I want to be
[47:53] now think of this you see neither none
[47:56] of them including job know this
[47:57] conversation
[47:59] and this conversation that actually took
[48:02] place where that the Lord
[48:05] where he called and God began to brag
[48:08] upon job and he said hast thou
[48:11] considered my servant job
[48:15] God was taking claim on job
[48:21] Glory there is none like him in the
[48:24] earth a perfect and an upright man
[48:29] I wish I could preach right now
[48:31] one that feareth God and askeweth Evil
[48:37] now there's no doubt think of them think
[48:39] of how brother Graham says Satan stands
[48:41] there before the throne as an accuser of
[48:43] the Brethren right
[48:45] so Satan can be their accusing but God
[48:50] here is looking at job because job's
[48:53] faith and confession remains in the
[48:56] sacrifice you say you mean to tell me
[48:58] the job didn't do any wrong but if his
[49:00] confession and his repentance is in the
[49:03] sacrifice then God is looking at the
[49:06] sacrifice
[49:07] I'm glad about that aren't you I'm
[49:09] grateful for the grace of God tonight
[49:11] now think about this how brother random
[49:14] would say this and Brian I'll just alert
[49:16] you or she's not is she here praise the
[49:18] Lord I'll alert you Brianna when I when
[49:21] I want you on this but I want to just
[49:22] let me just kind of you just listen to
[49:24] this statement here I want to just read
[49:26] a few things where brother Ram's talking
[49:27] about God's confidence in you and I'm
[49:30] just reading about this and and I don't
[49:33] have this one on the board but here he
[49:34] says said uh have Satan is talking to
[49:37] God and saying oh sure you give him
[49:39] everything he wants and you've got him
[49:41] all edged up and everything no wonder he
[49:43] serves you sure he can serve you making
[49:46] plenty of money got plenty of cattle got
[49:48] everything in life anybody can serve you
[49:51] like that but if you let me have him
[49:53] I'll make him curse you to his face and
[49:55] God said I don't believe it
[49:58] Hallelujah
[50:00] God said I don't believe it he said
[50:03] could he have that confidence in you and
[50:06] I
[50:07] tonight
[50:09] where the accusation that Satan could
[50:11] come and yet God could say I don't
[50:14] believe it
[50:17] amen
[50:18] I just want to read a few of these here
[50:20] notice in Fellowship about Redemption
[50:22] God knowing the heart job had only one
[50:25] way that's through Fellowship through
[50:27] the shedding of the blood he had talked
[50:29] to God he knowed that he was God had
[50:33] confidence in job why because he had had
[50:37] fellowship with job so God's confidence
[50:41] is based on his fellowship with his
[50:45] children
[50:46] my my brother said oh me the Branham
[50:49] Tabernacle see today that the only way
[50:51] God can have confidence in you is not
[50:54] because you do something or with your
[50:57] faith you do something remember if I got
[50:58] faith to move mountains on and on but
[51:00] when you have Fellowship
[51:03] how do we have Fellowship we have
[51:05] Fellowship under the blood
[51:08] is that right now notice if we look at
[51:11] this of how that God we want God to put
[51:15] uh confidence and God to put confidence
[51:17] in us and out of the message here you
[51:19] him how many knows that there is a
[51:22] growth
[51:22] yes amen there is growing now Brothers
[51:26] is speaking here he says the holy
[51:28] spirit's bringing word to Heaven how
[51:29] that you're progressing in your growth
[51:31] if you go back out in the world then God
[51:34] can't put much confidence in you if
[51:36] you're up and down and say this one
[51:38] thing yeah that's it you're following
[51:40] little Clicks in the church you're
[51:42] fussing fighting gambling bat biting how
[51:44] can the church ever go on now think of
[51:47] it brother man would go on to say in one
[51:49] of the same messages of hear ye him and
[51:51] I want to just say this like this in the
[51:54] message hear ye him you will find how
[51:56] the prophet is being led by God to speak
[52:00] to lives that have been drawn and they
[52:02] have come to Christ they have accepted
[52:05] salvation and they're on their way into
[52:08] a full reconciliation and Redemption
[52:11] where the Holy Spirit becomes the Seal
[52:14] of their life because just to accept
[52:16] Christ is not the new birth
[52:18] are you hearing me that's a start the
[52:21] Bible said man believeth with the heart
[52:24] unto salvation right and that the faith
[52:28] of God is revealed from righteousness
[52:31] unto righteousness right this is why
[52:34] brother Adam said if a man he said even
[52:37] if he might be a Catholic Methodist or
[52:38] whatever and brother Brown It's been
[52:40] extended extensive time and laying this
[52:42] out even through the seals if it is a
[52:44] Catholic man and it's trusting in Jesus
[52:46] Christ for its salvation he is saved now
[52:49] he didn't say he's in the bride
[52:51] because remember for the bride it's got
[52:53] to be that of the blood has been fully
[52:56] applied and she is him on display
[53:01] right
[53:02] and I'm glad that ain't up to me to
[53:04] decide who is and who is it but if we
[53:06] just preach a word because the message
[53:08] that God has given me to preach is the
[53:10] call from the other side it is a message
[53:13] that calls to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:15] to make yourself ready and who's going
[53:18] to make themselves ready only the bride
[53:20] will respond to that call nobody else
[53:23] will
[53:24] right I would love for everybody you say
[53:27] how do you preach it I preach it as
[53:29] though it's for everybody because I
[53:32] don't know who he is and who is not
[53:33] years and time and how long it takes for
[53:36] somebody to even come to that place that
[53:39] is not in my hands that is in the hands
[53:42] of God
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:44] this is why brother Randall could say
[53:46] when he's talking about being in the
[53:48] family of God because let me just pause
[53:50] this eyes he brings me back to this
[53:51] point that we there is a growing where
[53:55] the holy spirit is dealing with our
[53:57] lives even in a life that has accepted
[54:01] the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior
[54:03] right now Savior and they might still
[54:06] have all kinds of habits in their life
[54:08] because they're still what made them do
[54:10] it in the beginning is still there
[54:11] that's where sanctification has to come
[54:13] in Sanctified by the blood Jesus
[54:16] suffered without the gate that he might
[54:17] sanctify the church is that right it's
[54:20] the blood that sanctifies cleanses out
[54:23] all the habits all the filth all the
[54:25] desires and the Holy Spirit comes to
[54:28] Crown his work with by feeling filling
[54:31] that life now I want you to think of it
[54:34] like this there's also a growth within
[54:36] our lives lives that have been that have
[54:39] been born again how many knows there
[54:41] still are growing going on
[54:43] right Paul over and over it's how would
[54:45] you with abound in faith I would you
[54:46] would abound more in love because so
[54:48] it's a desire for continuing growth and
[54:50] and this is one of the uh you know one
[54:52] of the greatest statements that when you
[54:54] come to the end of first Corinthians 15
[54:55] we always look at oh that this
[54:58] corruptible shall put on incorruption
[55:00] but the very last scripture there says I
[55:02] would that you be abounding in the work
[55:05] of the Lord
[55:07] Oh Glory so we ain't sitting around
[55:09] drinking sweet tea and waiting on the
[55:10] rapture
[55:11] hello we're abounding in the work of the
[55:14] Lord and really remember it's not us
[55:17] telling God what to do but it's us
[55:19] surrendering and letting God achieve
[55:21] what he has desired to achieve
[55:24] oh glory be to God now think of this
[55:26] it's your character your conduct that
[55:30] gives God confidence in you
[55:34] well how what is our character affected
[55:36] by it's affected by him
[55:40] is to be molded by him so what's God
[55:43] putting confidence in he's putting
[55:45] confidence in that life that is
[55:47] submitting to him and it's it's
[55:49] responding to the word and God is
[55:52] putting confidence think of this God
[55:54] allows tests and trials to come along
[55:55] every one of us we can Fellowship on
[55:58] this I remember when I first got started
[56:00] in serving the lord or when God first
[56:02] got a hold of my life there was some
[56:04] tests there were some things that came
[56:05] my way and you know what Satan's purpose
[56:08] was when I think back on it I've said
[56:10] this over and over was to try to shake
[56:12] me and to see am I really tied to that
[56:16] which is real in genuine is there
[56:19] something that means more to me it can
[56:21] take the very things that's so
[56:22] meaningful the things that we think
[56:24] anybody know what I'm talking about this
[56:27] is why brother random would talk about
[56:28] he said was yes as soon as you give your
[56:30] life to the Lord he said as soon as the
[56:32] holy spirit moves in your life he said
[56:34] you can expect family and everything
[56:36] else to turn against you but it's not
[56:39] them it's not them it's the enemy God's
[56:43] permitting it to do what only prove you
[56:45] that the grounds you're standing on it
[56:48] ain't you holding on but it's God that's
[56:50] got to hold on you
[56:55] oh my mama it's your character your
[56:58] conduct that God that gives God
[57:00] confidence in you now this is why
[57:03] brother Brown would go on and he would
[57:05] make a statement and he would say now
[57:07] that's what God's desire is to have a
[57:09] real confidence in us and he says the
[57:11] real love of God here in the message
[57:13] hear you him the real love of God is
[57:15] waiting for you where God can get into
[57:18] you and have confidence in you
[57:21] so the love of God is God's confidence
[57:24] in you
[57:27] my mama
[57:29] does he speak to you
[57:31] then he's got confidence
[57:34] or by the same I haven't always
[57:35] responded I haven't all but does he
[57:37] speak to you
[57:39] if he speaks to you let me tell you
[57:40] something there is nobody mandating God
[57:44] to talk to you or me if he's talking to
[57:47] you talking to me it ain't because we're
[57:49] worthy it ain't because that we've done
[57:51] something it's because he loves you
[57:56] and no matter how many times you don't
[57:58] let him in
[58:00] Hallelujah surely goodness and mercy
[58:03] shall run after me or can I say it the
[58:06] way it is and the where it will chase
[58:08] after me all the days of my life and let
[58:12] me tell you something you can outrun a
[58:14] lot of things but you can't outrun the
[58:17] choosing of God and the goodness and
[58:20] mercy of almighty God
[58:25] hmm
[58:27] the real love of God is waiting for you
[58:30] where God can get into you and have
[58:31] confidence in you he said like I would
[58:33] my wife or you would your wife I don't
[58:35] care how many men would come up it
[58:37] wouldn't bother me she don't care how
[58:39] many women would be around that don't
[58:40] bother her we got love and confidence
[58:42] and the only way you can have confidence
[58:45] is to have love
[58:46] and the only way you can believe God and
[58:48] take him for your healing whatever
[58:49] you're taking him for is because you
[58:52] love him
[58:53] right
[58:54] if you love me keep my Commandments
[58:58] Hallelujah love is the key for every
[59:01] promise of God
[59:03] well brother's name I can't muster up
[59:05] enough love he ain't expecting you
[59:07] because you your love will never do it
[59:09] but it must be his love he loved us
[59:13] first
[59:15] right it ain't that I got to give my
[59:17] love up to his level it is that really
[59:19] it is my love submitting to the love of
[59:23] God and then it becomes God's love
[59:25] moving me beyond my fears beyond my
[59:28] doubts Beyond unbelief it becomes his
[59:30] love that's motivating me
[59:33] oh my and then you got confidence in him
[59:36] that he won't lie to you he promised
[59:38] he'd do it
[59:40] how many ever prayed for something and
[59:42] you had to wait for it
[59:45] okay about five of you
[59:55] I know we're living in an age of
[59:58] instant instant instant
[1:00:01] dear Lord don't let us see that spinning
[1:00:03] color wheel on our Mac
[1:00:05] don't let us see that spinning thing
[1:00:08] don't let us get outage by Spectrum
[1:00:14] maybe if your healing's ungered a little
[1:00:17] bit
[1:00:18] God's got confidence in you that you
[1:00:20] hold on
[1:00:25] God's got confidence in you you can look
[1:00:27] at you
[1:00:29] I don't even got that kind of confidence
[1:00:30] in me no but he does
[1:00:33] he does
[1:00:34] and he'll keep encouraging you and
[1:00:36] strengthening you and here you are
[1:00:38] standing here praying prayer requests
[1:00:41] after prayer request life do the right
[1:00:43] and said the same prayer request you're
[1:00:45] still praying the same prayer why
[1:00:47] because you know that God answers prayer
[1:00:51] because sometimes what we're looking for
[1:00:54] they may not be answered in my presence
[1:00:56] but God always answers prayer
[1:01:00] I think our brother Branham was
[1:01:01] baptizing brother Billy Paul in the pool
[1:01:04] and brother Branham says oh God let Hope
[1:01:06] look over the banister of time where the
[1:01:09] prayer has been answered right here this
[1:01:12] morning
[1:01:14] Hallelujah
[1:01:17] Glory
[1:01:19] oh my let me go on he said when it looks
[1:01:23] like everything has gone wrong
[1:01:25] anybody ever had that
[1:01:28] you probably say had it got it
[1:01:30] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:01:32] wrong God is giving you a trial
[1:01:36] because he dislikes you
[1:01:40] he thinks little of you
[1:01:43] well that's my own fabricated version
[1:01:46] isn't it
[1:01:48] he's got confidence in you
[1:01:52] he don't have to baby you around you're
[1:01:54] not a hot blood plant a hybrid you're a
[1:01:57] real Christian God is giving you a test
[1:02:00] to see what you'll do about it
[1:02:02] no wonder Peter said these fiery trials
[1:02:04] wow count it as Joy it's more precious
[1:02:06] to you than gold and many times we
[1:02:09] oh Lord here we're going to repent while
[1:02:10] we read it we him and Hall
[1:02:14] or hauling him
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:19] like years and years ago I remember I
[1:02:21] think it wasn't 96 sitting there and you
[1:02:23] know the first time I ever heard brother
[1:02:24] Donnie say it when he said you know he
[1:02:26] said many of us want a testimony he said
[1:02:28] but here's the way we go about it test I
[1:02:31] moaning and complainy and groanie and
[1:02:33] grumbly all the time testimony
[1:02:37] come on now
[1:02:40] oh we just gotta let everybody know on
[1:02:41] Facebook we're having a bad day
[1:02:47] right ain't no wrong wanting a little
[1:02:48] bit of empathy sympathy or whatever more
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:52] but you know that's a part what is it
[1:02:54] that feels that way if you're a real
[1:02:55] child of God that ain't your soul that
[1:02:57] feels that way
[1:02:58] it's our flesh and it's our spirit
[1:03:02] let me tell you what a trial does it
[1:03:04] exposes the weakness that we are
[1:03:06] encompassed with
[1:03:09] God knows how to get our attention that
[1:03:11] hey this ain't about you you ain't
[1:03:13] holding you I'm the one that's holding
[1:03:15] you
[1:03:17] and the trial is all about God's desire
[1:03:19] to use us more
[1:03:24] oh my we him and Hall
[1:03:27] well that's something God give you
[1:03:30] to overcome
[1:03:32] he knows you'll do it
[1:03:36] imagine
[1:03:38] we're surrounded by a host of angels and
[1:03:40] what's more what's most important
[1:03:43] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:03:45] is rooting for us
[1:03:47] Lord I don't feel like I'm going You're
[1:03:49] Gonna Go
[1:03:55] I don't feel like that you're gonna do
[1:03:57] it he knows you'll do it
[1:04:01] does he know that because you're a part
[1:04:03] of him and he never gave up he never
[1:04:06] quit
[1:04:07] when it looked Bleak and dark
[1:04:09] come on now when he was building his
[1:04:12] Masterpiece and you had Noah that died
[1:04:14] there like that but God didn't give up
[1:04:16] at all God didn't throw up his hands and
[1:04:19] say what in the world am I going to do
[1:04:20] but God said before I build this
[1:04:23] masterpiece I'm gonna take four
[1:04:25] pedestals and I am going to build it
[1:04:28] upon Faith love Mercy Perfection or
[1:04:32] faith love Grace and Perfection I'm
[1:04:34] gonna build it on that because my church
[1:04:37] will be built upon my faith my love my
[1:04:40] grace and my perfection
[1:04:44] whoa
[1:04:47] now job was useful
[1:04:49] like this right here this is useful to
[1:04:51] me
[1:04:54] sure don't make them like they used to
[1:04:55] but it's useful to me
[1:04:57] seemed like they used to be thicker
[1:05:06] now if you want better examples you pray
[1:05:08] and ask God say God's smarten him up
[1:05:09] some so I can get some better examples
[1:05:10] but there's things that's useful right
[1:05:14] I mean I've had to use a screwdriver but
[1:05:16] you know the thing for a screwdriver if
[1:05:18] I walked over that screwdriver and it
[1:05:19] stood up and told me you don't need me
[1:05:21] you can't use me
[1:05:24] right
[1:05:28] but screwdriver don't do that does it
[1:05:30] it's an instrument that can be used
[1:05:33] when it's needed
[1:05:35] and that's how God wants us to be
[1:05:38] when he needs a screwdriver he can get
[1:05:40] it
[1:05:41] the hammer he can get it the wrench he
[1:05:43] can get it
[1:05:45] so God doesn't God doesn't look at a
[1:05:47] bunch of a toolbox if we're all tools in
[1:05:49] the box and God's not looking at like
[1:05:50] we're a bunch of you know little kids in
[1:05:52] the classroom me me me me me me me me me
[1:05:54] me me me me me me me me you know that's
[1:05:57] always funny you know when I would ask
[1:05:58] those questions in class me me everybody
[1:06:00] wanted to do it on certain things but
[1:06:02] when you asked him about other things
[1:06:04] no hands will go up
[1:06:07] it's kind of like us isn't it there are
[1:06:09] certain things that God said okay here's
[1:06:11] the deal who wants to walk on water
[1:06:13] tomorrow Lord Jesus I humbly accept your
[1:06:16] requests Lord I'll do it Lord God in
[1:06:19] place of all the rest of these people
[1:06:20] here but what if he says who would like
[1:06:23] to go through a hard trial Lord I prefer
[1:06:25] my brother Lord I prefer my sister Lord
[1:06:28] is that right come on Friends your flesh
[1:06:31] is no different than mine
[1:06:32] right my flesh is not looking around
[1:06:35] saying Lord where's the next test or
[1:06:37] next trial coming from
[1:06:39] so let's look at how that job was useful
[1:06:41] let's just take a few moments on this
[1:06:42] job was useful
[1:06:44] but how was he useful
[1:06:46] through the sacrifice now let's just
[1:06:49] let's look at a few scriptures here
[1:06:50] tonight job 4 verse 3. here's a
[1:06:53] testimony that is witnessed by his
[1:06:56] friends they're the ones talking like
[1:06:57] this behold thou job Hast instructed
[1:07:01] many and thou Hast strengthened the weak
[1:07:05] hands
[1:07:06] wonder where he got that kind of
[1:07:08] character
[1:07:09] for who you're spending time with
[1:07:11] who he was fellowshipping with
[1:07:14] are you hearing me
[1:07:15] that's what's really important in our
[1:07:17] life
[1:07:18] is about who we spend the time with
[1:07:20] spending it with the Lord
[1:07:23] is that right you know brother man tells
[1:07:25] us that in our lives he said we'll have
[1:07:27] that sticky carnal nature that'll bother
[1:07:29] us until we're out here is that right
[1:07:30] now I realize that I can pray all day
[1:07:32] long I can pray all night and we should
[1:07:34] pray without ceasing but I realize it's
[1:07:36] not going to remove the stickiness but I
[1:07:39] just pray it makes it like wax on the
[1:07:41] stickers to where when something comes
[1:07:43] off it's just like water on my car where
[1:07:46] that hot waxes went over it beads up and
[1:07:48] runs right off I trust that God Lord let
[1:07:51] me get in your presence where my life
[1:07:53] can be so waxed up with the anointing
[1:07:56] oil of the spirit of God to where when
[1:07:59] things want to stick there ain't nothing
[1:08:01] to stick to in my move down here and
[1:08:04] move down there but oh there is an
[1:08:06] anointing oil
[1:08:07] over the Samuel then in scripture oh but
[1:08:09] yes it is scripture when Jesus prayed he
[1:08:13] said our father that are in heaven
[1:08:14] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:08:16] thy will be done on Earth even as it is
[1:08:19] in heaven give us this day our daily
[1:08:21] bread lead us not into temptation but
[1:08:23] Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the
[1:08:25] kingdom the power and the glory forever
[1:08:27] and ever amen and brother by Adam will
[1:08:29] take that portion of scripture that can
[1:08:31] deliver us and keep us from evil and he
[1:08:34] will tie it back into Noah he said when
[1:08:37] Noah was on the ark and if any little
[1:08:39] bit of water started to come in he would
[1:08:41] grab the tar and begin to pitch it right
[1:08:44] there to prevent that water from coming
[1:08:46] in and he said that's what prayer does
[1:08:49] it's pitch on your life against the
[1:08:52] enemy
[1:08:54] whoa
[1:08:58] Hallelujah that was free
[1:09:01] thank you Lord
[1:09:03] job 4 4 another testimony witnessed by
[1:09:06] surrender this ain't even Joe Joe ain't
[1:09:08] bragging on himself this is a testimony
[1:09:10] they've all seen
[1:09:11] okay
[1:09:13] bad words have uphold in him
[1:09:17] that was falling
[1:09:19] and thou has strengthened the feeble
[1:09:22] needs
[1:09:24] that's kind of testimony I want
[1:09:27] it's been a man who's strengthened a
[1:09:30] life a useful life one who has
[1:09:36] one that would strengthen the feeble
[1:09:39] knees
[1:09:41] job 16 5. now this is Job's own
[1:09:43] confession
[1:09:44] I would strengthen you this is what he
[1:09:47] job was confessing that he would do now
[1:09:48] we know from previous verses he means it
[1:09:50] I would strengthen you talking to those
[1:09:52] friends that were coming against him I
[1:09:54] would strengthen you with my mouth and
[1:09:55] the moving on my lips should assuage
[1:09:58] your grief
[1:10:02] that's what I would do
[1:10:04] job where is all this with great acts
[1:10:07] and mighty power that is mighty power
[1:10:10] to be able to look at a situation and be
[1:10:13] able to minister Health to be able to
[1:10:15] minister strength to be able to minister
[1:10:17] a Word of Deliverance how could he do
[1:10:19] that by his fellowship with God
[1:10:23] because you see this confidence that God
[1:10:26] had in job was not a foreign strange
[1:10:28] thing job though he didn't hear that
[1:10:31] conversation but that confidence was in
[1:10:34] his heart and he walked as a man with a
[1:10:37] perfect Faith with confidence in God and
[1:10:40] that's why he could be so yielded the
[1:10:43] way that he was
[1:10:44] Joe 29 25 this is another confession
[1:10:47] from his heart I chose out their way and
[1:10:49] said it Chief speaking when others would
[1:10:51] come and dwelt as a king in the Army as
[1:10:54] one that
[1:10:55] comforteth
[1:10:57] the mourners
[1:11:00] I know there's things sometimes that we
[1:11:01] look at and we want maybe God and we
[1:11:03] feel like well if I can't do this you
[1:11:05] know if I can't preach if I can't sing
[1:11:06] if I can't do this then God can't use me
[1:11:09] that's a lie
[1:11:10] that's not true at all you can be used
[1:11:13] as much as you will surrender your life
[1:11:15] to God
[1:11:16] I'll tell you what why don't we do this
[1:11:18] stop waiting on somebody else to do a
[1:11:20] burden that God's put on your heart to
[1:11:21] do if God's put it on your heart you
[1:11:24] pray for it and you ask God to equip you
[1:11:26] and direct you instead of well you know
[1:11:28] I've been praying about this and I've
[1:11:29] been how about putting some feet on your
[1:11:31] prayers and on the burden
[1:11:33] hello somebody maybe I need to preach
[1:11:36] this on Sunday
[1:11:39] maybe we just do we'll just do replay
[1:11:42] but it's true we need looking at these
[1:11:45] parts here that even with Comfort now
[1:11:48] let me just move on here in this in this
[1:11:50] brother Brown makes a statement I read
[1:11:52] this to you last week if I won't be the
[1:11:54] last time you hear it but then Jesus
[1:11:55] came and called out of the message he
[1:11:57] said job knowed he had influenced people
[1:12:02] his life had been useful
[1:12:06] God never gave us our lives just to hang
[1:12:09] around this
[1:12:10] or that
[1:12:12] he give it to be useful for him I don't
[1:12:14] want to be
[1:12:16] one who just hangs around the message
[1:12:18] I don't want to be one who hangs around
[1:12:20] bsw2
[1:12:22] you know you got like these signs no
[1:12:24] no you're no loitering I
[1:12:27] lliter on the grounds of the message
[1:12:30] now either and neither neither listen to
[1:12:32] me now neither is God continuing to push
[1:12:36] us out into something that we're not
[1:12:38] called to do but I think when God has
[1:12:41] touched our heart it ought to be
[1:12:42] something rise from without within us
[1:12:45] like it did Paul what would you have me
[1:12:48] do
[1:12:51] now God may not have you seen may not
[1:12:53] have you preach but God might choose you
[1:12:55] to be a witness to your family
[1:12:58] he might choose you to be a witness on
[1:13:01] the job you we don't have a choice but I
[1:13:04] just want to say Lord what you've
[1:13:05] ordained to use me I'm here I don't want
[1:13:08] to be a shiny screwdriver I don't want
[1:13:10] to just be a shiny wrench I want to be
[1:13:12] one that your hands is being on just
[1:13:14] like a wrench that's got oil on it I
[1:13:17] know that man's been using it it's been
[1:13:19] changing oil filters I want my life
[1:13:21] covered over with the Fingerprints of
[1:13:24] the Holy Ghost where God said I've got
[1:13:27] an instrument I've got somebody that
[1:13:29] will let me use them
[1:13:32] but I'm a screwdriver Lord I'm only to
[1:13:35] put in screws but Lord if you need to
[1:13:37] use me to pop out a nail on the wall I'm
[1:13:40] here
[1:13:42] I may not be a four-way I may be a
[1:13:45] flathead but I'm here Lord God to be
[1:13:46] used
[1:13:49] he give it to be useful for him
[1:13:54] do something
[1:13:55] tell somebody else because that's really
[1:13:57] what it is everything that we do for the
[1:13:59] kingdom of God it's actually an
[1:14:00] expression and a telling of somebody
[1:14:02] else you can talk you can't talk
[1:14:05] whistle A Hymn or something
[1:14:07] give some impression somewhere
[1:14:10] and job was the type of man that was
[1:14:13] useful
[1:14:15] that's the type of man I want to be
[1:14:17] I want to be useful
[1:14:19] how many want to be useful
[1:14:21] okay this man was useful this is why
[1:14:24] those trials came the way they did
[1:14:27] because you know why he was useful
[1:14:30] well brother Samuel that don't make
[1:14:32] sense or it does remember because these
[1:14:34] trials were not God was against him God
[1:14:36] was only as the prophet would say
[1:14:38] approving his servant he would say in
[1:14:40] another place he's only trying to draw
[1:14:42] out the qualities that are in The
[1:14:44] Believer in another place it's only God
[1:14:46] pruning off the branch
[1:14:49] so that it will bear more fruit
[1:14:52] it don't feel it's not it's not joyous
[1:14:55] is it the trial is not joyous
[1:14:58] useful so it's to be used for practical
[1:15:01] purpose in several ways now let's just
[1:15:04] try to get to this this this little
[1:15:06] question here tonight how do I become
[1:15:08] into that place of being useful
[1:15:11] how do I become into that place just for
[1:15:13] sake of time if you don't mind I was
[1:15:14] going to read Matthew 27 that really
[1:15:16] deals with the crucifixion of where they
[1:15:18] crucified our Lord but maybe just for
[1:15:20] sake of time if you allow me just to
[1:15:22] kind of move through here just a little
[1:15:24] bit in verse 33 it says when they were
[1:15:26] coming to the place called Golgotha that
[1:15:28] is to say a place of a skull they gave
[1:15:31] him vinegar to drink mingled with gall
[1:15:33] and when he had tasted thereof he would
[1:15:35] not drink and they crucified him and
[1:15:37] parted his garments casting lots that it
[1:15:40] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:15:42] the prophet they pardoned my garments
[1:15:44] among them and upon my vesture did they
[1:15:46] cast lots and sitting down they watched
[1:15:49] him there and they sent over his head
[1:15:51] his accusation written this is Jesus the
[1:15:54] king of the Jews then there were two
[1:15:56] thieves crucified with him one on the
[1:15:58] right hand and another on the left and
[1:16:01] they that passed by reviled him wagging
[1:16:05] their heads saying thou that destroys
[1:16:08] the temple built a in three days
[1:16:10] save thyself if thou be the Son of God
[1:16:12] come down from the cross likewise also
[1:16:14] the chief priest mocking him with the
[1:16:16] scribes and Elders said he saved himself
[1:16:20] he saved others pardon me himself he
[1:16:24] cannot save
[1:16:26] may I be found to Echo those same words
[1:16:28] as the prophet would say I'm glad he
[1:16:30] didn't save himself
[1:16:33] because if he would have saved himself I
[1:16:35] could have never been saved
[1:16:38] Hallelujah
[1:16:40] oh my God
[1:16:42] glory be to God he trusted in God let
[1:16:45] him deliver him now if he will have him
[1:16:47] for he said I am the Son of God the
[1:16:49] thieves also which were crucified with
[1:16:51] him cast the same in his teeth now from
[1:16:54] the sixth hour there was Darkness over
[1:16:56] all the land unto the ninth hour and
[1:16:58] about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
[1:17:01] loud voice saying
[1:17:03] that is to say my God my God why has
[1:17:07] Thou forsaken me notice not my father my
[1:17:10] father
[1:17:11] what did he do he forsook his sonship in
[1:17:16] order to make Sinners Sons
[1:17:18] for he could not remain a son and make
[1:17:22] sinner Sons but he gave up he gave up he
[1:17:27] surrendered he did not become sinful he
[1:17:30] who knew no sin became my sin
[1:17:35] a man in order for Fellowship to be
[1:17:38] restored he who was the worthy one he
[1:17:42] who was the one that was not guilty he
[1:17:45] surrendered himself
[1:17:48] in order
[1:17:50] to take away my guilt
[1:17:55] oh God no one only let me receive it but
[1:17:57] let me live that Lord
[1:17:59] let me live that Lord
[1:18:04] you know we asked that question what
[1:18:05] must I do to become useful
[1:18:10] and really it's the same as job
[1:18:13] it's through the revelation of God
[1:18:14] working through
[1:18:16] the sacrifice in our life
[1:18:19] but Abraham would say it in this simple
[1:18:20] way
[1:18:22] that job actually had more to do
[1:18:25] than what we do
[1:18:26] because job had to offer up the burn
[1:18:28] offering
[1:18:30] we don't have to offer it up
[1:18:32] he's been offered up once and for all
[1:18:35] all that we have to do is accept it
[1:18:39] not reason with it you can't barter with
[1:18:41] it God don't want you to barter he paid
[1:18:44] your debt
[1:18:45] and my debt
[1:18:47] he paid what was against us let me tell
[1:18:49] you something brother Wayne depicted it
[1:18:51] so clearly when he was up here even when
[1:18:53] he was preaching that last time there in
[1:18:55] December that he born this was not what
[1:18:58] we see on the pictures of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:00] or the crucifix that that's done to keep
[1:19:02] and hold the modesty but he was stripped
[1:19:05] of his garments
[1:19:07] shame he bore our shame
[1:19:11] it was shameful enough to look at it as
[1:19:14] he was but he bore our shame you know
[1:19:16] what he was saying there'll never be one
[1:19:18] that could ever say my shame is worse or
[1:19:22] I've got such shame in my life he bore
[1:19:25] our shame
[1:19:27] he bore the offless worse whatever you
[1:19:30] could imagine is the worst shame he bore
[1:19:33] it all
[1:19:35] glory be to God in the highest
[1:19:38] Hallelujah all we have to do is accept
[1:19:40] that sacrifice that's been provided for
[1:19:43] us and it releases to us a liberty
[1:19:46] to become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:19:48] Brethren makes a statement he says first
[1:19:51] this is out of that day on Calvary that
[1:19:53] message I asked you to listen to at some
[1:19:54] point
[1:19:55] brother Perham speaking he says first
[1:19:57] we should seek what that day meant we're
[1:20:00] talking about how to become useful right
[1:20:02] second we should see what that day has
[1:20:05] done for us
[1:20:07] what it did for us and third
[1:20:09] let's look at what we ought to do
[1:20:12] for that day
[1:20:14] so he paid
[1:20:15] I'll let you know on the next one Briana
[1:20:17] he paid the price when he died at
[1:20:19] Calvary he made a way for every son and
[1:20:24] daughter of God
[1:20:26] to come back home
[1:20:28] he made a way
[1:20:31] he gave up the spirit
[1:20:33] and he poured out his Spirit when he
[1:20:36] ascended up there he poured it out on
[1:20:38] the day of Pentecost that's what Calvary
[1:20:41] means to us it allowed us to follow him
[1:20:45] because before that time no man could
[1:20:49] die as far as died to himself
[1:20:52] the prophets remember God would move on
[1:20:55] them and they would speak now think of
[1:20:57] this David would speak my God my God why
[1:21:01] is Thou forsaken me it was David The
[1:21:03] Vessel but it was the spirit of God the
[1:21:07] spirit of Christ speaking through him
[1:21:10] right so they were able to yield that
[1:21:14] the spirit of God could speak through
[1:21:16] their lives but Calvary made a way that
[1:21:20] a man could come and die to himself to
[1:21:24] where there was a remedy that was made
[1:21:26] for the sin question in his life that he
[1:21:29] could surrender his life and come back
[1:21:31] across the chasm under the shed Blood by
[1:21:35] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and
[1:21:37] stand in the presence of God as a
[1:21:40] redeemed son and daughter of God Calvary
[1:21:43] made a way for that aren't you glad for
[1:21:44] that
[1:21:47] not one of us was worthy of that
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:54] sometimes we're still looking at our
[1:21:56] unworthiness but remember it's not us
[1:21:57] that made ourselves Worthy
[1:21:59] oh to think of that but the man said we
[1:22:01] got to accept it and to accept it is to
[1:22:03] accept his person Christ in our heart
[1:22:06] then we're free from sin there's no more
[1:22:09] sin shackles hanging on us at all and
[1:22:11] God just it's like we never sinned the
[1:22:13] perfect sacrifice made us perfect for
[1:22:15] being therefore perfect even as your
[1:22:17] father in Heaven is perfect there's no
[1:22:19] more to be done but we are made perfect
[1:22:21] in the presence of almighty God
[1:22:23] that's the powerful thing is to
[1:22:25] recognize the sufficiency of the grace
[1:22:28] of God
[1:22:29] and accept it
[1:22:31] sometimes that word it sounds so simple
[1:22:33] to us and it really is
[1:22:35] it's not you know what complicates it is
[1:22:38] we get it
[1:22:39] King in our mind
[1:22:42] trying to figure it out you can't figure
[1:22:44] out the pardoning grace of God
[1:22:47] because let me tell you something it
[1:22:49] don't make sense
[1:22:50] you don't deserve it
[1:22:52] I don't deserve it
[1:22:54] thank you
[1:22:55] well I've been a good boy I've been a
[1:22:57] good girl I've been you don't deserve it
[1:22:59] it's not anything that we could Merit
[1:23:03] it's the grace of almighty God
[1:23:06] but this is where it would sometimes
[1:23:08] like Brother Brad said we'll lose our
[1:23:09] position we go to looking back and
[1:23:11] trying to find out what we have done
[1:23:13] what we have done but listen God he
[1:23:15] wants to use us but he don't need our
[1:23:17] help he just needs our surrender
[1:23:20] right it's not what what we can do or
[1:23:22] what I have done and this is why go
[1:23:24] ahead bran on paragraph 83 look what
[1:23:27] that day on Calvary did to you it paid
[1:23:29] your price it settled the question your
[1:23:32] sins be a Scarlet they're as white as
[1:23:34] snow red like Crimson white like snow
[1:23:36] then you have no sin you are perfectly
[1:23:38] sinless no matter what you've done or
[1:23:41] what you do you're still sinless as long
[1:23:44] as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:23:46] savior your sins are forgiven Anything
[1:23:49] Is Forgiven is remitting and forgot
[1:23:51] about let me just just drive this down
[1:23:53] right now when you have repented of your
[1:23:57] sins God is not holding your sins over
[1:24:00] you
[1:24:02] because you can never walk on
[1:24:06] the Bible said repent and be baptized in
[1:24:10] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:24:12] remission of your sins
[1:24:15] you don't remember remit means past sins
[1:24:18] are cut off
[1:24:20] because you can't go nowhere if those
[1:24:23] sins are still hanging on you but
[1:24:25] there's got to come Grace that ministers
[1:24:28] to your heart to let you know Jesus Paid
[1:24:31] It All
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:34] and I can rise up and go right toward
[1:24:37] the promise of God
[1:24:40] boo devil
[1:24:45] devil then what does it do
[1:24:48] it gives you after that condition
[1:24:51] his Spirit that's what it does it gives
[1:24:53] you his Spirit after that condition
[1:24:55] to follow on
[1:24:57] read this next part with me and to do as
[1:25:01] he did for others who is following on ah
[1:25:06] so how do I become useful by dying to
[1:25:11] myself
[1:25:12] because the grace of God leads us to
[1:25:14] that what what does what does Calvary do
[1:25:17] it causes you when we get a real glimpse
[1:25:19] of Calvary it causes you to take your
[1:25:22] focus off of your unworthiness it causes
[1:25:24] you to take the focus off of habits it
[1:25:27] causes you to take the focus off
[1:25:28] everything that's been around in your
[1:25:30] life that's tormented you plagued you
[1:25:31] and everything the devil is trapped you
[1:25:33] into and wanted to make you say you'll
[1:25:34] never be this you'll never be that you
[1:25:36] know what Calvary does it overwhelms you
[1:25:38] with the love of God to do what to where
[1:25:40] you look away to Jesus where you need to
[1:25:43] be looking to in the first place
[1:25:47] laughs
[1:25:48] to do as he did for others who was
[1:25:51] following on let's try to hit that
[1:25:52] tonight he was just one man the perfect
[1:25:54] man he gave his life and he made an
[1:25:57] example for you
[1:25:59] wow so he was
[1:26:01] the example of what God intended a Son
[1:26:03] of God to be daughter of God you believe
[1:26:05] that
[1:26:06] he's the first among many Brethren let
[1:26:08] me just read this first part of this
[1:26:09] quote the first thing I want to say is
[1:26:11] Jesus never lived
[1:26:15] for himself
[1:26:16] he didn't die for himself he didn't take
[1:26:19] a beating for himself
[1:26:20] he didn't bear the crown of thorns for
[1:26:22] himself he wasn't mocked for himself he
[1:26:25] wasn't spit on for himself he wasn't
[1:26:27] reviled for himself he wasn't made fun
[1:26:30] of for himself he lived his whole life
[1:26:33] or you think he wasn't tempted to to
[1:26:35] live it you think he wasn't tempted he
[1:26:37] was tempted remember the devil would say
[1:26:40] to him if thou be the Son of God he was
[1:26:42] tempted to act out in the flesh he was
[1:26:45] tempted to take the kingdom without
[1:26:47] suffering he was tempted in all points
[1:26:51] such as we are what was it it was
[1:26:54] proving Not only was he the perfect
[1:26:56] sacrifice but when this sacrifices
[1:26:59] offered up and this same life that's in
[1:27:01] me it comes back in you it will give you
[1:27:04] the strength to withstand Temptation
[1:27:07] it'll give you the strength to get back
[1:27:10] up again it'll give you the strength to
[1:27:12] walk on in my perfection
[1:27:16] glory be to God he never lived for
[1:27:20] himself
[1:27:22] remember even Brethren after the
[1:27:24] Temptation Brethren came around surely
[1:27:26] John 7. surely
[1:27:28] any man that has a gift like this does
[1:27:30] not keep it to himself he would go out
[1:27:32] and make it known to others tempted same
[1:27:35] devil different form
[1:27:37] same devil different form right he was
[1:27:40] tempted in all points such as we are
[1:27:44] yet without sin right
[1:27:47] he was tempted
[1:27:48] now let's look at this here just for a
[1:27:50] moment can can we take just a few
[1:27:52] moments to look at this
[1:27:54] notice here
[1:27:57] in Matthew chapter 9 verse 9 this is
[1:28:00] just a few verses of scripture we'll
[1:28:01] look at here before we close let's look
[1:28:03] at our example just for a minute here
[1:28:04] just one of those things Jesus passed
[1:28:06] forth from thence he saw a man named
[1:28:08] Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom
[1:28:10] and he said to him follow me and he
[1:28:13] arose and followed him and it came to
[1:28:15] pass as Jesus said at meat in the house
[1:28:17] behold many public uh
[1:28:20] many publicans and sinners came and sat
[1:28:23] down with him and his disciples oh Lord
[1:28:24] don't let anybody post this on Instagram
[1:28:26] that Jesus is sitting in Matthew's house
[1:28:30] dear Lord his reputation will be ruined
[1:28:32] Oh no you're mistaken his reputation is
[1:28:35] made there
[1:28:40] aren't you listen to me aren't you glad
[1:28:42] that he overcame that that you and I get
[1:28:44] bothered by
[1:28:46] help me
[1:28:48] come on what if somebody sees me talking
[1:28:49] to this guy that's got about a million
[1:28:51] rings and a million tattoos and whatever
[1:28:53] more well if they're a real believer
[1:28:54] they'll be praying for you
[1:28:56] they won't be thinking wonder if he's
[1:28:58] thinking about getting a ring I wonder
[1:29:00] if he's thinking about getting a tattoo
[1:29:01] no I've already been tattooed on my soul
[1:29:02] I've got the Seal of the Living God
[1:29:05] Hallelujah
[1:29:07] all right
[1:29:08] I wonder what brother Samuel is talking
[1:29:11] to them for trying to win a soul for the
[1:29:13] kingdom of God
[1:29:14] trying to see if there's a seed there we
[1:29:17] don't get to pick and choose whether
[1:29:18] they got Rings tattoos whether they're
[1:29:20] bald got hair whether they got hair down
[1:29:22] to their waist we don't got we don't get
[1:29:23] to choose that because that's not what
[1:29:25] we're choosing based on anyhow we're
[1:29:27] choosing and letting God lead us because
[1:29:29] if there is a son and daughter of God on
[1:29:31] the inside just get him in the presence
[1:29:33] of the light and God will go to work and
[1:29:34] God will do it
[1:29:36] is that right and when the Pharisees saw
[1:29:39] it
[1:29:40] they said unto his disciples why eateth
[1:29:44] your master you can almost imagine with
[1:29:46] public
[1:29:48] and sinners
[1:29:50] but when Jesus heard it he said to them
[1:29:53] they that be whole
[1:29:55] need not a physician
[1:29:57] but they are sick
[1:29:59] oh wait a minute so you mean Jesus that
[1:30:00] I you mean you mean that that it's not
[1:30:03] oh eyewitness to people when everybody
[1:30:04] is just in the right condition they're
[1:30:06] here at church and they're this that's
[1:30:07] what I witness no that's Pharisees
[1:30:10] yeah hello somebody
[1:30:12] but here is the thing that Jesus was
[1:30:15] looking at is you know what there's a
[1:30:17] need right here there's a need in this
[1:30:19] life there's a need in this situation
[1:30:21] Jesus if I can say it like this Jesus
[1:30:24] was not going around looking for a party
[1:30:27] he was looking for his children
[1:30:31] aren't you glad that he came where you
[1:30:33] and I were at
[1:30:35] probably a lot of people wouldn't have
[1:30:36] come there
[1:30:37] a lot of pastors priests and whatever
[1:30:39] more would never come but Jesus came
[1:30:42] Lord be to God in highest but go you
[1:30:45] learn notice he said they that beholding
[1:30:48] him not a physician but they that are
[1:30:49] sick verse 13. but go you and learn what
[1:30:51] that meaneth I will have mercy and not
[1:30:55] sacrifice for I am not come to call the
[1:30:59] righteous but sinners
[1:31:02] to repentance he's still calling
[1:31:04] Apostolic age is still in session but
[1:31:07] guess what the Corporal body's not here
[1:31:09] but his body is
[1:31:11] Because by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:14] we have been baptized into one body we
[1:31:16] has no hands but our hands no feet but
[1:31:21] our feet
[1:31:22] is that right
[1:31:23] and what you think of this now Matthew
[1:31:25] 11 19 because we're talking about what
[1:31:27] an example he was what Calvary did for
[1:31:29] us that he never lived his life for
[1:31:31] himself if he would have lived his life
[1:31:32] for himself he'd have made sure he never
[1:31:34] went to these kind of places was never
[1:31:36] being been called and identified with
[1:31:37] Matthew and luxem he also made sure he
[1:31:40] wouldn't have been at the well of
[1:31:40] Samaria especially him and that woman
[1:31:43] standing there by the well he'd made
[1:31:45] sure of it but Jesus never lived his
[1:31:46] life for himself like I don't want them
[1:31:48] to dirty my reputation no his reputation
[1:31:50] is made with Taking Lives that look like
[1:31:52] as Misfits these will never be turned
[1:31:55] around Jesus said that's where my
[1:31:56] reputation is made that's where I make
[1:31:59] my name is taken lives that people say
[1:32:01] wrote off Outcast but he gets a hold of
[1:32:04] that life and out of that life he raises
[1:32:07] a son and daughter of God
[1:32:10] Matthew 11 19 the son of man came eating
[1:32:14] and drinking and they say Behold a man
[1:32:17] gluttonous and a wine bibber see
[1:32:20] misinterpreting
[1:32:22] right
[1:32:24] so what are you going to do Jesus what
[1:32:26] are you going to do
[1:32:27] I'm telling you what are you going to do
[1:32:28] Jesus
[1:32:30] are you going to turn around oh I don't
[1:32:31] want to be labeled that
[1:32:33] if I go if I go and sit down with that
[1:32:34] brother I mean I might get late oh so
[1:32:37] it's still Pride that we deal with isn't
[1:32:39] it
[1:32:40] help me somebody
[1:32:41] it'll just cause me to go in first gear
[1:32:43] and preach a little bit more right here
[1:32:44] sometimes we get that old pride thing
[1:32:47] that rises up in this you know what that
[1:32:48] is it's a spirit that wants to try to
[1:32:50] come around our lives is that right oh I
[1:32:53] don't I don't know if I can be but
[1:32:54] remember we're not there fellowshipping
[1:32:56] with sin we're there to try to reach a
[1:32:59] soul for the kingdom of God
[1:33:01] is that right
[1:33:03] a friend of publicans and sinners but
[1:33:05] wisdom is Justified of her children I
[1:33:07] always remember the testimony it's just
[1:33:09] one but you know even when brother Jerry
[1:33:11] tells this the testimony he's told about
[1:33:12] brother brother Tim uh brother Tim
[1:33:14] Horner and how that brother Tim Horner
[1:33:16] had had so many different experiences
[1:33:18] with preachers and different ones and
[1:33:19] and you know just and I I'll just say
[1:33:21] like this Maybe Maybe I'm Wrong maybe
[1:33:23] I'm off with this right here I believe a
[1:33:24] lot of times people have good intentions
[1:33:25] but the thing of it is they're trying to
[1:33:27] take the product they've got and Shove
[1:33:28] It Down somebody's throat
[1:33:30] yeah are you hearing me now brother
[1:33:32] that's why brother Brian said ain't
[1:33:33] nothing wrong with the product of the
[1:33:34] Holy Ghost we got it sometimes it's our
[1:33:35] presentation of it that's wrong is that
[1:33:38] right I got a quote on I'm going to read
[1:33:40] it tonight but to notice how the here
[1:33:42] brother Tim comes to that this Church
[1:33:43] Fellowship it was a miracle he came to
[1:33:45] the Church Fellowship but here that
[1:33:46] brother Jerry comes in and you know my
[1:33:48] brother he don't have no Rottweilers
[1:33:49] right now as he's wanted some but he
[1:33:51] don't have none but you know he had them
[1:33:53] then and you know my brother when he
[1:33:54] gets in a dog gets an outlet for him
[1:33:56] it's just it's just an outlet to be able
[1:33:58] to research it study it and things like
[1:33:59] that and the Lord knows you've got to
[1:34:01] have Outlets like that as a pastor and a
[1:34:02] minister you got to have something you
[1:34:03] can look at and but you know here he is
[1:34:05] he's doing this and he comes and sits
[1:34:07] down he don't mention one scripture he
[1:34:09] don't mention one quote to brother Tim I
[1:34:11] wonder what some of us would have said
[1:34:12] if we'd have been there I wonder if we'd
[1:34:14] have been itching and his brother Jerry
[1:34:15] getting worldly his brother Jerry
[1:34:17] getting careless I believe I think we
[1:34:18] ought to need to get on the boxing
[1:34:19] gloves we need to put it out and brother
[1:34:21] Tim glory to God you God you need to be
[1:34:23] born again and you need to be you need
[1:34:26] to re I wonder what we would have done
[1:34:29] you see the problem is where the
[1:34:31] screwdriver telling telling God how to
[1:34:33] use us
[1:34:34] instead of letting God use us the way he
[1:34:36] wants to use us and sometimes pride gets
[1:34:38] built up come on friends it's that part
[1:34:40] we get that fleshness over us like oh my
[1:34:42] goodness I don't want to be a
[1:34:43] compromiser I don't want to be in this I
[1:34:45] don't until we respond on a wrong basis
[1:34:48] instead of the love of God and what
[1:34:50] happens that right there drives away
[1:34:54] but I'm talking about an example how to
[1:34:56] be useful
[1:34:57] right he gave his life on Calvary that
[1:34:59] you and I could become useful
[1:35:01] but how brother Jerry stood there that
[1:35:03] that or sat there that day that whole
[1:35:04] day of that picnic talked about
[1:35:06] Rottweilers the whole time and brother
[1:35:08] Tim's testimony was you've heard about
[1:35:10] the Jerry tell this and I just use it
[1:35:11] for this example as it comes to me
[1:35:12] brother Tim when he left that picnic
[1:35:15] he said I'll be in church tomorrow
[1:35:17] he told his parents he said I never met
[1:35:19] a preacher like that
[1:35:23] you know sometimes
[1:35:25] we walk around like we have to be a
[1:35:27] bunch of spiritual monks
[1:35:30] where we don't have an ounce of
[1:35:31] compassion about us think of the
[1:35:34] scriptures I referred to with job think
[1:35:37] of the scriptures he was a useful man I
[1:35:39] read four scriptures to you where he
[1:35:41] strengthened the knees of the feeble
[1:35:45] you have to gain favor before you could
[1:35:47] ever talk to somebody
[1:35:49] is that right but here Jesus is regarded
[1:35:52] as a friend in the long story short you
[1:35:53] know what happened brother 10 that very
[1:35:55] service he walked in on that Sunday
[1:35:56] morning and here there God moved there
[1:35:58] ended up being an older call and here
[1:35:59] come brother Tim walking stepping right
[1:36:00] over top people and my brother walked
[1:36:02] down and stepping over top people and he
[1:36:03] was led to the Lord I say glory be to
[1:36:05] God
[1:36:07] might have had to use Rottweilers he
[1:36:09] wouldn't put Rottweilers over any other
[1:36:10] breed
[1:36:11] hello somebody
[1:36:14] but God used it to do what reaching
[1:36:17] God might use your background with tools
[1:36:19] or knowledge or the cars whatever it
[1:36:21] could be God can use that to strike up a
[1:36:25] conversation with somebody
[1:36:27] you know how this is the only this is
[1:36:29] the only time I got who told you that's
[1:36:31] the only time you got don't try to cram
[1:36:33] rush or push just yield
[1:36:36] notice Hebrews 4 18 the spirit of the
[1:36:39] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[1:36:41] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:36:43] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:36:45] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[1:36:47] recovering of sight to the blind
[1:36:49] and to set at Liberty
[1:36:51] them that are bruised
[1:36:54] Luke 15 1. I am I'm closing
[1:36:57] here's Jesus
[1:36:59] then he drew near unto him they then
[1:37:01] Drew near unto him all the publicans and
[1:37:04] sinners for to hear him
[1:37:07] he must have a problem
[1:37:09] publicans and sinners this is his this
[1:37:12] is the people that he's fellowshipping
[1:37:14] with
[1:37:15] oh but he's on a mission
[1:37:18] for the son of man
[1:37:20] came not to be ministered to but to
[1:37:23] minister
[1:37:25] he came to give his life a ransom for
[1:37:27] many let me tell you something he gave
[1:37:29] his life over and over Calvary was only
[1:37:33] a manifestation of what took place daily
[1:37:37] to the will of God giving himself
[1:37:40] daily
[1:37:43] whole mind and the Pharisees and scribes
[1:37:46] murmured saying this man receiveth
[1:37:47] Sinners and eat it with eateth with them
[1:37:50] and he spake this Parable saying what
[1:37:52] man of you have a hundred sheep if you
[1:37:54] lose one does not leave the 99 in
[1:37:56] Wilderness and go after the one which is
[1:37:58] lost until he finds it and when he had
[1:38:01] found it he layeth it on his shoulders
[1:38:04] rejoicing
[1:38:06] and when he cometh home he calleth
[1:38:08] together his friends and neighbors
[1:38:09] saying unto them Rejoice with me
[1:38:12] for I have found my sheep which was lost
[1:38:15] I say unto you I'll just close here that
[1:38:19] likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one
[1:38:23] sinner
[1:38:24] that repenteth
[1:38:28] what was the whole goal was after one
[1:38:32] after one you mean Jesus you mean for
[1:38:35] one person hey he crossed the sea for
[1:38:38] one
[1:38:39] is that right he kept an appointment in
[1:38:42] his appointment book at The Well of
[1:38:45] Samaria
[1:38:46] that appointment had been arranged
[1:38:48] before the foundation of the world and
[1:38:50] it just came up on his notification
[1:38:54] I must need to go by
[1:38:56] Samaria
[1:38:58] why one of his children was coming
[1:39:01] I could go on and on we've had that
[1:39:03] point we'd understand that for one
[1:39:05] sinner that repenteth God
[1:39:08] like job job was useful
[1:39:10] how was he useful because he allowed the
[1:39:13] life of the sacrifice
[1:39:16] not only it's it gave him it was a conf
[1:39:19] God's confidence in him
[1:39:21] but it gave him a place where he could
[1:39:22] stand it's like if you're trying to get
[1:39:24] somebody out of the water who's drowning
[1:39:26] you better make sure that you're
[1:39:28] standing on Solid Ground first
[1:39:30] are you with me
[1:39:32] and then when you're on Solid Ground
[1:39:33] then you can reach your hand to somebody
[1:39:35] else and say here take a hold of this
[1:39:37] because you got ground to stand on that
[1:39:40] you won't be pulled off of that ground
[1:39:41] but you're pulling to the ground you're
[1:39:44] standing on
[1:39:45] I believe that's that's the grace that
[1:39:47] we need or sometimes it might be things
[1:39:50] that we're looking at or it might be
[1:39:51] long in my town well brother Sammy I'm
[1:39:53] pulling up well don't make sure you're
[1:39:54] not yanking
[1:39:56] just make sure you keep pulling
[1:40:02] because he made us
[1:40:03] Fishers
[1:40:05] of men
[1:40:07] right
[1:40:08] just a little bit
[1:40:10] it's a little bit
[1:40:12] just a little bit and that little bit
[1:40:14] that we're like that
[1:40:16] that might be our response
[1:40:19] to a trial
[1:40:21] it might be a reaction to a situation at
[1:40:24] work
[1:40:26] and it's getting the attention
[1:40:28] wow there's something there's something
[1:40:30] deeper here
[1:40:32] something deeper
[1:40:34] oh God I want to be useful
[1:40:37] not useful for my glory
[1:40:39] but like I said I don't care if it's
[1:40:41] just to flip the light switch on I just
[1:40:43] want I want to be a part of this program
[1:40:46] I don't matter you don't have to it's
[1:40:48] not a certain part that I have to have
[1:40:49] or you have to have I just want to be
[1:40:51] useful
[1:40:52] like the little guy who stands at the
[1:40:54] end of the symphony and this little guy
[1:40:55] he's waiting this Symphony goes on and
[1:40:57] on and on the song is playing and all of
[1:40:59] a sudden we're at the end he's the one
[1:41:00] that goes
[1:41:01] that's all he does
[1:41:03] I don't care
[1:41:04] I don't care if my job in the symphony
[1:41:06] is to set the chairs up for those who
[1:41:09] complain to play
[1:41:11] it's an honor that he has allowed me to
[1:41:14] be a part
[1:41:16] of his body
[1:41:19] if I'm the guy who has to unload the
[1:41:21] truck of the violin cases and somebody
[1:41:22] else plays them I'm just glad to do it
[1:41:26] I'm glad to do it Lord whatever that I
[1:41:28] can do Lord
[1:41:29] if it's hey hey said hey go fetch me
[1:41:32] some rosin for my boat sure sure
[1:41:34] whatever I can do but Sam you don't I do
[1:41:37] mean that
[1:41:38] I just want to be used by him because
[1:41:40] whatever he asked me to do
[1:41:42] if I do it
[1:41:44] he'll be glorified and it'll work with
[1:41:47] another part of the body and that part
[1:41:48] of the body work at this part of the
[1:41:50] body it'll just work together
[1:41:55] that's about our heads
[1:41:58] Lord Jesus
[1:42:01] I believe across this building tonight
[1:42:03] Lord and those that Lord would be or
[1:42:06] will
[1:42:07] archive Lord even the service some
[1:42:09] streaming it now
[1:42:12] help us Lord
[1:42:15] like we looked at last week Lord certain
[1:42:17] things that you don't need the things
[1:42:21] you can't use
[1:42:22] what you don't need from us Lord
[1:42:25] help us the Lord
[1:42:27] help us father that we can stay
[1:42:31] in a place Lord
[1:42:33] in your presence
[1:42:35] and fellowshipping Lord
[1:42:37] with you father
[1:42:39] lord it's not something that we have to
[1:42:42] where it's drawn out and we have to make
[1:42:45] something Lord out of our imagination
[1:42:48] know when Paul said pray without ceasing
[1:42:51] I believe God that that's staying in
[1:42:53] contact with you
[1:42:55] you've given the example sometimes in
[1:42:57] Services Lord where it's been
[1:42:59] sometimes the Lord for my wife and I
[1:43:01] will set down
[1:43:03] and we'll have a little time together
[1:43:04] with coffee and it might be just a few
[1:43:07] moments there
[1:43:09] whether it's at the start of that day or
[1:43:10] it's at the close of it or maybe I'll
[1:43:12] take a break in the middle of the day
[1:43:13] just to have coffee
[1:43:15] and those those are some longer times of
[1:43:18] chatting and just a few moments that we
[1:43:20] have there and then there's other times
[1:43:21] through the day or something that I may
[1:43:23] send a text or I'll walk out of the
[1:43:25] office or walk from another room in the
[1:43:27] house and and come out of there and I'll
[1:43:29] say honey how you doing how's this doing
[1:43:31] not a long conversation
[1:43:33] but just
[1:43:34] just expressing things like honey I love
[1:43:37] you or how you doing you're feeling
[1:43:38] better how's your how's your pain how's
[1:43:40] this
[1:43:41] Lord
[1:43:43] that's how you
[1:43:46] want it to be with us
[1:43:48] there's times sure that we have Lord in
[1:43:51] our prayer closing
[1:43:54] times Lord in prayer and that's true
[1:43:55] maybe sometimes Lord we've got to get
[1:43:57] out and just go park Lord in front of
[1:44:00] the of the lake and just to talk to you
[1:44:02] sometimes we've got to break away from
[1:44:03] just certain things Lord but you know
[1:44:05] how you deal with each of us but then
[1:44:07] even through the day in our busyness
[1:44:09] Lord
[1:44:10] of the work and everything else through
[1:44:12] the day we can say Lord
[1:44:15] I love you
[1:44:17] you just begin to think about the grace
[1:44:19] of God that has come down our way
[1:44:21] how you found us how you picked this up
[1:44:26] how you turned our lives around
[1:44:29] lord it's something I've never got over
[1:44:32] I can say thank you Lord
[1:44:35] things that we can notice throughout the
[1:44:37] day
[1:44:37] and there's times Lord where you'll
[1:44:39] you're you'll drop little things to us
[1:44:41] Lord a little something Lord maybe
[1:44:43] you'll say or something will come to us
[1:44:46] that we've heard or something we've read
[1:44:48] or sometimes we might even be driving
[1:44:50] down the road and we'll see a sign
[1:44:52] and something you can he can say
[1:44:55] God loves you
[1:44:57] and Lord everybody else driving back and
[1:44:59] reading that it might help different
[1:45:00] ones in a different way but we're
[1:45:02] reminded yes you do Lord
[1:45:05] oh Lord God
[1:45:08] we love you father
[1:45:11] Lord as we think of job
[1:45:14] it was the life of the sacrifice
[1:45:18] that was being expressed
[1:45:21] when he would visit those
[1:45:23] who were Mourning
[1:45:25] when he would strengthen the knees
[1:45:28] that were people
[1:45:30] when he would Express words that would
[1:45:33] assuage the grief to dismiss or lighten
[1:45:37] that
[1:45:38] it was the life of the sacrifice
[1:45:42] Lord help us
[1:45:45] help us Lord my hands are up Lord
[1:45:49] Dear God
[1:45:52] that Lord is the privilege we have not
[1:45:54] only to live an overcoming life but
[1:45:57] daily Lord Jesus
[1:45:59] father to live so close to you
[1:46:04] to where the life of that sacrifice
[1:46:07] is projected
[1:46:10] through our lips
[1:46:11] projected through our actions
[1:46:15] projected through our empathy our
[1:46:18] sympathy our comfort
[1:46:21] or there's no doubt every one of us Lord
[1:46:24] our flesh would still rise up and say
[1:46:26] Lord I'll walk on water tomorrow for you
[1:46:29] but Lord I wonder how many of us would
[1:46:32] raise our hands and say Lord I'll be a
[1:46:35] comforter to one that's in trial
[1:46:37] I'll comfort them Lord by the same
[1:46:39] comfort that you've comforted me
[1:46:42] I'll be willing to minister Lord be
[1:46:44] willing to send a text to card
[1:46:46] phone call encouragement I'll be willing
[1:46:49] to pray for somebody Lord I'd be willing
[1:46:52] I'd be willing Lord
[1:46:55] to just listen
[1:46:57] not even have to say a word because Lord
[1:46:59] some of the greatest words we can ever
[1:47:01] say is when we say absolutely nothing
[1:47:05] and just listen
[1:47:08] help us Lord for that's what that day on
[1:47:11] Calvary
[1:47:12] did for us
[1:47:15] how that Lord
[1:47:16] you were in the presence of Sinners and
[1:47:19] publicans but I think about it Lord
[1:47:22] you were there
[1:47:24] on a mission
[1:47:26] you were there that that life Lord could
[1:47:28] be expressed and it would touch the
[1:47:30] lives of others we read here in this of
[1:47:33] Luke 15 or it was misunderstood the
[1:47:35] public or the those Lord God of the
[1:47:37] Pharisees the religious of that day they
[1:47:39] could not understand it as a matter of
[1:47:41] fact they wanted nothing to do
[1:47:45] with people who were not as righteous as
[1:47:48] they were
[1:47:50] God help us
[1:47:53] I don't ever I don't want to be that way
[1:47:55] Lord
[1:47:57] because I sure can't be useful for you
[1:47:58] to you
[1:48:00] if I'm better than somebody else I can
[1:48:03] never be useful to you Lord
[1:48:05] any goodness
[1:48:07] that is in our life
[1:48:09] it's because of the grace of God
[1:48:14] help us Lord
[1:48:16] as we look not at our own selves we look
[1:48:19] away to Calvary
[1:48:21] help us Lord to stand on that ground
[1:48:24] that confidence and like job be able to
[1:48:26] reach out a helping hand to the others
[1:48:29] and that hand that we might be reaching
[1:48:31] out to that life oh it might be a life
[1:48:33] that has been wrote off a life that is
[1:48:36] all this will never be this but Lord
[1:48:38] there's something within us that reaches
[1:48:40] out to him
[1:48:43] that's the Redeemer in his redeemed
[1:48:46] creation reaching out to redeem
[1:48:50] it's you Lord
[1:48:52] that's when the Holy Spirit has come and
[1:48:55] as your Prophet tells us we have now
[1:48:57] been made
[1:48:59] co-partners with you
[1:49:01] in Redemption
[1:49:04] Lord Jesus
[1:49:06] help us the Lord to live to walk that
[1:49:09] way help us to be sensitive in what
[1:49:10] we'll say and what we don't say
[1:49:13] help us Lord not to get pulled out into
[1:49:16] the flesh as though we got to say
[1:49:17] something right now or I got to do this
[1:49:19] help us Lord to realize that the only
[1:49:22] time and only way you'll use this is
[1:49:24] when we're yielded to you
[1:49:27] not leading you not pushing you not
[1:49:31] shoving but being yielded in the
[1:49:34] Master's Hand
[1:49:37] Lord
[1:49:39] help me Lord I pray
[1:49:41] Heal Me Lord
[1:49:43] that's the kind of life I want to live
[1:49:46] a useful life
[1:49:47] I might just be a little flathead
[1:49:49] screwdriver but Lord whenever you've got
[1:49:52] need let me be in a position that you
[1:49:54] can reach down and say I need this right
[1:49:57] now
[1:49:58] help us Lord
[1:50:00] help us I pray
[1:50:02] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:04] amen
[1:50:07] hallelujah amen let's stand if you would
[1:50:09] you got a song on your heart
[1:50:15] dear Lord
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:27] I know
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:39] my eyes of faith I see thee
[1:50:45] upon
[1:50:46] the cross
[1:50:53] let me even
[1:50:57] to me all the singing now
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:04] Jesus Use
[1:51:07] Me O Lord
[1:51:10] don't refuse me
[1:51:14] for surely there's
[1:51:17] a word
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:22] no matter Lord what size no matter what
[1:51:24] it would be
[1:51:26] even though
[1:51:29] it's humble
[1:51:31] Lord
[1:51:37] and though the cost me great power for
