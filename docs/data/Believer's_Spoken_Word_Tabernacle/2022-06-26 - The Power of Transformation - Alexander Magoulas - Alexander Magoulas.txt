the lord in the land of the living i believe we've got some witnesses here today god put that song in your heart we're so grateful for the worship service today how it just ministered to me even in the back and so i i love when god brings a plan together you know sometimes you don't see it you're sitting there scratching your head like at the red sea well what's god going to do he's fixing to destroy your enemy the same day [Music] you're looking at the sea seeing the problems and god's saying that's the solution that's the thing i'm going to bury that enemy in and you'll never see him again praise the lord maybe you've got one of those seas in front of you today i believe god's fixing to move amen amen god bless you we're so happy to be with you today i want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ it's so good to see each one once again i'll just apologize ahead of time we have a wedding today back home afterwards and uh you know how weddings are there they i've never seen one of these things go off smooth it's always something that comes up but i told the i told him i said well listen by the end of the day you'll be married either way so don't worry about it i gotta sign it myself whatever so but we need to get going back so if i don't see afterwards i apologize we do love each one of you we thank you we uh as john said i i wish that above all things you prosper and be in health even as your souls prosper and earn health so let's just look to him in a word of prayer as we bow our heads our gracious father truly you've been so good to us lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves that we've been to each other lord i pray today as you extend such an abundant grace and mercy and peace to us that we we could be partakers of the same that we could afford the same toward one another and lord as we've gathered together in the name above every other name your mighty matchless name we just asked that you would come and perform and do that which only you can do lord it it doesn't seem meat to us that you the master should serve us but lord time and time again in our lives we just find lord we need you more and more and you set the example for us lord you set the example for us that the greatest should serve so we come to you the greatest one although we ask you humbly now as we approach your throne you would come and give grace and mercy once more to your children lord there are needs here present today that i don't know about perhaps the person themselves is not even aware today what will go on in their life maybe even this afternoon but father you see each need before we asked you saw each situation before the world began and you made a way for us i thank you for this word of god today for you bless the ministering of the word of god may just strengthen establish and settle each one and father as always we're careful to give you all the praise and glory and on we thank you for these these are your children these are your children today that you've purchased with a great prize lord i'm keenly aware today of what they mean to you and lord i just i ask for your help now as i endeavor to to see them blessed may you give utterance i pray and father we give you the praise in jesus christ's name amen god bless you once again as you turn you're in your bibles today we're going to look into romans the 12th chapter the first three verses here and as you're turning there we just i say we me and the lord anyway but uh i just find this word of god it's always so rich amen it's it's it's so past our finding out and you know sometimes sometimes we we look at situations and we we wonder why things are the way they are but you know i believe god always has an answer if there's a bible question there's a bible answer you know the secret of the lord is with them that fear him he said and he will show them his covenant and so i thank god we we we are partakers of the secret things of god there's lots of churches getting together today lots of people getting together today lots of people that aren't even religious they got together in halls of congress or you know some secret place or whatever we've been gathered into this pavilion in the time of trouble he's hid us in the secret of civilians so we're just so glad to be feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man romans the 12th chapter we'll read the first three verses here and i'll have you be seated the scripture says this it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith may the lord bless you as you be seated today the brother random uses this text preaches out several places and i'd like to speak on it again today or on the same kind of a thought today speak on the power of transformation brother makes a statement in 1953 and the sermon israel in the church is like the first part he says this he says now we've got to come to full doctrine he says i like good old shouting meetings where we just clap our hands or shout and have a good time have great powerful services and things dance on the bubbles as it were he says but wait then when the showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing so then he makes this uh i guess we call it an injunction or maybe a commandment but he says let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that and so i want us to just take a few moments this morning and this afternoon and examine this idea why we are doing the things we do because as he said we can have powerful meetings and shout and clap and dance and yet not know where we're standing so we want to go back and find out why why are we excited about the things of god why do we shout and dance why is it if we here in that condition we come to showdown why is our attitude the way it is where people don't know where they're standing now we of course we appreciate great powerful services as the prophet said amen uh but to show you what i'm talking i want you to consider this you know i'll say it this way when i was a young man i come in the message and i first i'm listening to the tapes and i listened to brother and make a statement on tape he said that jesus christ in this day he said jesus christ had more success in my meetings in my ministry than he did back in galilee he said jesus christ had more he had more success in nazareth than he did back i'm sorry in jeffersonville than he did in nazareth and i'll just be honest with you as a young man i you know i come out of the world i barely knew anything and as a as a young man i hear this and it sounds almost sacrilegious to for a man to stand there and say well he's had more success here but i want to show it was jesus christ that had more success it wasn't the man william branham but he said jesus christ had more success here than he did in nazareth and i want you to understand today that's not sacrilegious that's absolutely the plan of god not only did it happen that's how god wanted it to be we're looking in our humanity and we think while a man is taking glory on himself no god wanted it that way jesus said the works that i do you will do them also and greater than these you'll do because i'm going to the father it was always god's plan that's why jesus said it's expedient for me to go so we look at that a carnal person or person that's maybe just religious and they're thinking they're looking at this the wrong way because that's actually what god wants to do amen and so we see this many times you know we we talk about powerful services i want you to understand some of the most powerful services that have ever been on the face of their took place in jeffersonville indiana they took place in bakersfield that took place in california there was a prophet of god he was anointed by god to bring forth this message and in those meetings the devil was defeated time after time after time we could talk about powerful meanings but here's some of the most powerful meetings probably ever been on the face of the earth amen blinded eyes were open the sick were healed thoughts that people didn't even know about themselves a prophet of god by inspiration through a prophetic gift he would open the secrets of the hearts he would reveal the might of god to the people but i want you to understand despite everything supernatural despite being the greatest meetings that were ever on the face of the earth many people that came for miracles many people came to see what was taking place maybe they came to criticize maybe they came for loaves and fishes whatever it is the the magnitude and the inspiration and the power of those meetings as great as it was many people come because they love fellowship or whatever else and they miss the purpose of god and by and large most of the people that sat in those meetings completely missed it they walked away or they criticized they went after something else so we thank god for these meetings we thank god they're on tape we thank god that they're recorded but as long as it stays on a recording if it's just a man in the pulpit speaking it'll never bring transforming power but when you recognize it's the voice of the son of man speaking through a prophet there's transforming power in that for your life because the same god that spoke back there he's speaking today not just to you but he wants to speak through you by the same inspiration amen by and large most people they heard they saw the sign but they disbelieved the voice that followed the sign amen and like i said they did the same thing with jesus they came for loaves and fishes they came for miracles and many people they go to church even today because they love the feeling of the anointing they love the worship service they love the fellowship amen and all those things are good and fine but unless they come into this place it'll never change their lives so there's lots of people i say this way many people worship god and a lot of people worship worship amen they worship the idea of worship they love the anointing and the service and the music and they love the atmosphere but when they walk out there's no there's nothing to follow it and if there's nothing to follow their lives their obedience their service to god it looks no different so the bible says for us to be transformed how not by an exciting worship service not by formal theology or a bunch of excitement you're transformed by the renewing of the mind as a christian amen now this is a greek word metamorpho it means to be changed from one form to another form and brother brandon uses the example i love the example he uses of a tadpole and you look at a tadpole and it's in its early state it's a little got a little wiggly tail and this and that the final end of that that frog it looks very dissimilar from what it started out as and in your own life you can look at where you started out at not just in this life but hopefully even as a christian you can look at what you started as and you can look at where you're at now and say you know what i'm not what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be god has done something in my life that tadpole had no power to live in two atmospheres at the same time but when transformation come and he began to sprout a leg here and he began to that tail would fall off he he gained some things and he lost some things but what did it put him in a condition where he could live above the water he could come and live in another atmosphere that he was unable to live in before that right and so god is metamorphic he's transformed it's like a like a butterfly you think about it has no power it's a caterpillar you know if you if you see a butterfly going around unless you get real close you're like oh it's so pretty it looks so great but you get close to that caterpillar man you just want to squash it out now you shouldn't do that that's one of god's creatures you feel bad about that it looks so hideous in its form and when it begins to shroud itself in a cocoon a person that didn't know would wonder what was going on but god is transforming it by the nature which it catches now the nature that was already inside of it was going to produce a change on the outside and give it the ability to do things it could not do before god is transforming us to producing us the ability to do things we could not do in our humanity amen praise the lord it's changing and that's why i use the example i love the example of the frog because like i said the change is so drastic this word metamorpho it's actually the same word that's used in the bible when jesus is transfigured his outward form is so changed that his face it shines like the sun and i believe that this transformation i'm talking about today i believe it's transforming us not just in an instant but it's already transforming us here a little and there little you and i are already being changed from glory to glory and the same transformation that's in you that has caused you to overcome the situations in your life that you couldn't deal with that you couldn't overcome on your own that same transforming power is what's going to change this body one day this corruption it shall put on incorruption this mortal it shall put on immortality it can't be bound by its first birth it's not bound by circumstances it's transformed by the word of god hallelujah i believe that same theophy that you've heard from one day it's going to come right down here and pick up the uh it's going to pick you up and take you to that glorified body amen it's the power of transformation notice when you're transformed you act different you look different you walk different you talk different amen the power of transformation and this is why i'm saying this and i believe this is paul's point here in romans the 12th chapter he says i beseech you to present your bodies a living sacrifice it's holy it's acceptable to god it's your reasonable service i want you to present your whole life not not just your uh your just your sunday morning and remember to present your body as a living sacrifice listen if transformation just stays on the inside of us and that's all the further it goes we've missed the plan of god because god wants to present your entire spirit and your soul and your body blameless and his coming amen so i will you remember i want you to remember the literal life of jesus christ the token for this day it's of none of fact if it's not on display amen so it's got to be displayed in our lives amen now i want to look at this for a moment because when we read the book of jeremiah the 17th chapter and you don't have to turn there but we we look at the book of jeremiah the 17th chapter and there's a familiar scripture i use it quite a bit but the bible uh jeremiah says that the the heart is it's desperately wicked above all things i mean the the human heart is desperately wicked i can take a whole another thought on that but your human heart and your humanity it will fight its way through any obstacle to avoid the will of god if possible it does not want to serve god it does not want to submit to god your heart will find every excuse to serve god halfway or not serve god at all but one a man is changed not a mate believer now not an unbeliever when a man has really changed brother branham he talks about in the future home that that serpent nature that's in there there's a big eraser coming down from heaven amen praise god not what brother brain had on the blackboard but the hand of god come down and he took that serpent nature out of your heart and he transformed you he put the nature of a dove in there and you're not being led by a serpent anymore that's not who you are now your flesh doesn't want to recognize that maybe your friends don't want to recognize it maybe family doesn't recognize it but inside of you transformation has already taken place amen now if you're just a make-believer if you're just an unbeliever their heart is still desperately wicked that was israel's problem in the wilderness that paul talks about in the book of rome uh i'm sorry it's uh first corinthians the first corinthians the 10th chapter he talks about how they all led they left it they left the will uh egypt to go into the wilderness amen and they all left there this and they were all under the pillar of fire they all were under the pillar of the cloud they all drink from the rock in the wilderness they all ain't manna but with them all god was not pleased because their hearts the bible said their hearts had never been changed their hearts lusted after evil things can i put it this way to you today listen many people follow the prophet back there and they'll follow the prophet today they'll follow the prophet they've got the pillar of fire hanging up in their house they can believe in signs and wonders they've got all these things they drink from the same waters they listen to the same message but their hearts until their hearts are changed it doesn't do them any good and many people have settled to have another experience and say well listen we believe that god sent a prophet so do the pharisees that was their excuse with jesus well listen we're moses his disciple but if you believe what the prophet has said you recognize the word made flesh because the word made flesh tonight is not in a grave in jeffersonville this right here this bride right now in 2022 she is now the word made flesh you're the word made flesh today and if you can't recognize that and walk it it will never do you any good amen praise the lord so you have to understand that the change has already begun somewhere and that's what paul talks about romans the second chapter he said that you've received a circumcision amen not a circumcision made with hands in your flesh but you've received a circumcision of the heart which is made by god god changed that in you amen so what is the circumcision it's a separation from the flesh god separated your heart from the nature of your old birth of this flesh that's not who you are anymore you say why are you saying all this brother because what i want you to understand is many people they wrestle with condemnation they wrestle with insecurity they wrestle with a wrong attitude towards themselves because they recognize that they've got problems in their life like we're the only ones we come to church we hang our heads man i got problems today well praise god you're the only one at church we can get you fine we'll all be great we look at problems in our life we look at hang-ups we look at complexes and we disqualify ourselves because we think well there got to be something wrong with me well there's something wrong with your flesh that's why it needs to be changed we're trying to fix this flesh and if you could fix it it wouldn't have to be changed to go in the rapture listen god's not even taking this past house he's given you a new one he's going to rearrange these atoms to where there's never another doubt there's never another insecurity there's never another heartache but we look at these things in our own lives to say well there must be something wrong with me well it's not necessarily something wrong with you there's something wrong in your flesh but listen if you've received the nature of christ i want you to catch this amen if you receive the nature of christ if he's changed your heart listen he's not going to do that if you're a believer he's already done that that was the very covenant that he made what is the new covenant that jeremiah prophesied of paul talks about it in the book of hebrews he says i will put my law in their inward parts i will write it in their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people amen so the whole promise is i'm going to put it in them it's there already by the baptism of the holy ghost that's why again romans 2 says you have been made a law unto yourselves it's amazing to me you look even at this country and i i probably use this example before but we we tried to do what israel did sometimes we tried to legislate righteousness well if i could if we can make a certain law if we could change the laws in this country but as long as evil is in the heart of a people as long as their heart is fixed on evil they'll do whatever evil thing they want whether there's a law or not but paul says the law is not made for a righteous man it's made for the unrighteous you and i don't need one if the law of god is in our heart see the carnal mind would say well listen we need more rules and regulations and ideas and creeds but listen this is a better way just to put it in your heart that the nature of god in you wants to follow the will of god it's better it's not worse listen this is not worse than stoning tables from a mountain you've got something better than moses had you've got the power of transformation the power of transformation lies in you it can do for you what what moses couldn't do with his own temper where is the love of god shed about the scriptures in your heart amen paul says in romans 7 i delight to do the law of god after the inward man it's the law of sin in my members see it's another law it's not you and that's paul's whole point listen that's not you that's sin in you doing it god doesn't impute it to you anymore because that's not your desire that's not who you really are who you are is what god put in your heart which is him that's why the same word that speaks to the bridegroom speaks to this bride it's his righteousness his power his authority his faith say well listen brother what if my heart condemns me well the scripture says god is greater than your oh heart i just wrestled with condemnation i feel so bad i did all these things and it's i i i talked to a brother a while back he it was a brother i just want he's just a real sweet guy he's just he's one of them guys that give you the shirt off his back he's he's way nicer than i'll ever be just want to you know you know one of them guys he's just he's the nicest guy he's always he's just always there he's always so giving he's always so sweet just the sweetest dearest person in the world and i'm talking about this this this brother just he just wrestles with condemnation he make one mistake and he just stayed out of church and he wouldn't talk to people look him in the eye just condemned all the time by his own life and i spoke to him when i said brother you realize something i said the way you feel the world doesn't feel that way i said you realize the fact i'll praise the lord that'll help somebody out the fact that you're convicted when you're wrong about something and you recognize it and you feel bad you realize not everybody feels that way amen god gives you a conscience that works it's not been seared it's not it's not affected by the world god gives you a conscience and that conscience lets you know when you do the wrong thing because god loves you not because he hates you if we're not careful like this man we allow this this conscience god give it to you to bless you we'll let the devil condemn us with him that's not why god give it to you god give it because he loves you the fact that you've got unconscious the fact that you feel bad would you do something wrong that's the evidence that god loves you because the law is written in your heart and if we're not careful we allow what god ordained to be a blessing to us to become a place the adversary will defeat us because we look at it the wrong way amen i thank god god by his by the blood of christ the scripture says in hebrews chapter 9 he has purified our conscience from dead works to serve the living god listen if your conscience works because god purified it that's a good thing it's not a bad thing amen praise the lord god has put that there and that's why again in hebrews chapter 5 god is teaching us to distinguish between good and evil right milk belongs to them that are not of age strong me i believe that's what we're feeding on today strong meat belongs to them that are of age who even by reason of use of their senses know how to discern between good and evil you're not sitting here looking at murder and abomination stuff saying well i wonder if that's right or bad i wonder how god feels about that you know how god feels about it because you're not a bunch of babies you're not a bunch of infants you know the will of god you're wise understanding the will of the lord i tell my children this often i didn't realize this i got i guess i got it from charles spurgeon but discernment is not just being able to tell between evil and good it's being able to tell between what is right and what is almost right amen what what looks right and what actually is right they're so close sometimes amen listen this is the most deceiving age it's ever been you're facing things paul didn't have to face you're facing things peter didn't have to pace in her face in iranians and columba they dealt with many things but this is the most deceiving wicked age there's ever been because what looks like it's right is wrong it could be 99 right and still be wrong but praise god he sent us a message he's given us his spirit you can tell the difference transforming power in your life let you see it quickening power reveal it to you oh hallelujah i believe this bride we know she has to be at a full maturity that's how she can discern and withstand between the antichrist spirit and the spirit of god now you read that in the church book he's not just talking about a preacher somewhere he's talking about you and i today you and i have to be able to discern amen that belongs to those that are full age amen i read this here again in hebrews chapter 10 i want to read it for just a moment he says this is the covenant that i will make with him after those days saith the lord i will put my law into their hearts and in their minds will i write it amen now i'm bringing this back to being renewed in the spirit of your mind but i want you to catch this real quick i will put my law into their hearts and in their minds i will write it and then he says this i love this part and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more did you catch that amen if god has put his law in your heart your sins your iniquities he doesn't remember them anymore they say how can i know if i've been forgiven because he said it and you received it and his law is in you as in evidence your sins and iniquities he will remember them no more amen if you ever recognize that that you've been forgiven you're not just forgiven you're justified like you never did it in the first place listen we don't need a catholic priest today to intercede for us we don't need some man to stand the gap we've got one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus he's come in our hearts he dwells there he's places blood on the altar and you and i are justified today like we never did the first place and that's why i tell people all the time listen if you're a believer today if you receive that today you're just as righteous today as you'll ever be when you get a new body and the new heavens and earth and you don't have one temptation you don't have one problem you don't have one sickness you'll be just as righteous than as you already are right now because it's his righteousness in you oh my blessed is the man that's what david said blessed is the man now listen if you've got the right spirit in you you won't go the wrong way with that you won't turn grace into disgrace because the law of god is in your heart to stop that it's not your desire to do that your desires let's see how far away i can get from god your desire is i want to stay just as close to god as possible why would i want to go anywhere else i'd rather live one day in the courts of the lord in the house of the lord i'd rather be there one day than to live a thousand in attempts of wickedness i'd rather be a door keeper i'd rather be the lowest i'd rather be a full wash flunky than to live without the lord some people make their whole life they find a way to live without god well i'll do this without god i'll do that i don't want to go one minute i'd rather be the lowest to the level for one minute with god than to have a thousand years without god listen i've been in the tents of the wicked i don't want to go back i'd give it all up for just one moment with god oh my i like this here when paul writes about this in the in the greek here in the book of hebrews and i won't get into all the different words but he says i'll put my law in their hearts and this word in the greek it means that he's going to bestow it as a gift it's the gift of god to you you didn't earn the spirit of god you didn't work your way up to it he gives it as a gift that's what peter said in acts 2 38 you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's your gift to you he bestows it as a gift but then he says and i will write it and it's a it's a greek word epigraphio like an epigraph i will inscribe or write it in their minds in other words god's going to gift you with his nature by the spirit amen i believe that's what malachi 4 is about what did he say i will restore what the hearts of the children the heart's not the problem today then if you've got the the revelation that was given according to the prophet malachi 4. if you receive this message the heart's not the problem the problem is it needs to be inscribed he doesn't just bestow that it's got to take there's something that has to take place in other words god has to rewrite the way you think god has it because listen brother bran tells us in the greatest battle ever fought what satan chose as his battlefield he chose this that's why the battles the battle is not here for the believer it's here for the unbeliever it's here for the make believer but this is not your problem as a believer your problem is right here about two feet away you've got this big blockage up here that says you're no good and you'll never overcome and you're not as good as so and so and you can't believe god and you can't do this and i want to tell you today this is a lie the nature of god inside you is the truth and the nature of god says that you all things are possible to them that believe so we must allow god to rewrite our way of thinking i'll give you a good example here well i think it's a good example but john speaks about this in first john the second chapter in verse 20 he says you have an unction it's the same word anointing you have an unction or an anointing from the holy one and you know all things and i've met a lot of people i think they know all things they let me know they know all things especially when they're a teenager or something i better not get into that that's all i know some older ones too but you know it all they got to know all spirit brother bran said watch it when you get to know all spirit god can't even deal with that person when they got to know all spirit so that talk about somebody knows it all up here like some people it says you know all things it's not here it's the unction the spirit in you knows all things he tells you go down to verse 27 he says the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you now you can go to the carnal direction with that but if you spiritually understand god is giving you the discernment of his word amen there's a pulsation that identifies with the word that's how it teaches you amen the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him so the anointing in you knows and when you don't know that's where you go i mean you're not praying to a god that's a stone idol or a god that's a million miles away the god in you knows the answer if you'll turn there and not rely on your own thinking don't lie or don't rely on your understanding or lean in your own ways but trust in the lord acknowledge him in all your ways he shall direct your paths amen praise the lord so it's the spirit of the mind that needs renewed that's why the prophet of god said to the right mental attitude is that what he said the right mental attitude toward any promise of god will bring it to pass you know i talk some people say well that almost sounds like psychology well it would be if it wasn't god doing it amen and listen that's not just regard to psychology i thank god for for licensed people that know what they're doing but we're talking about the gospel now amen this isn't a man's psychology but the brahman says i'll tell you what the prophet said about it brother-in-law says this in 1963. he said psychology is all right as long as psychology don't deny the word but when psychology denies the word then psychology is wrong it gives an uncertain sound you know i was reading like i said i was reading through the church's book here and it's funny i found that brother branham endorsed a psychology book i thought well is it the dsm-4 well they wouldn't have that back then five or whatever brother actually endorses one this is great he said there is a textbook on psychology one we all need it is the bible i tell you what it's on a best-seller list and everything you can go buy it for a dollar dollar 25 now at the dollar tree if you want amen there is a book on psychology we all need it's the bible amen it's written by god and contains god's psychology well i feel pretty good about that we don't need a psychoanalyst we've got the holy spirit here to discern what's going on in your life amen no disregard to psychologists now but we've got something that when we get out as far up as we can get on the tree of knowledge of good and evil we can reach over to the tree of life we don't have to be stuck on that one tree we've got something that can not just help you deal with the problem it can change the situation altogether because you can learn to cope you can learn to deal with things in your past your history but god can put something in you that'll remove the problem completely so we thank god for whatever god wants to do amen so transformation comes by the renewing of the mind in other words we must reconcile the divine facts about what god has said about us in our christian walk brother man makes a statement i'm going to take just a few moments to read it it's a longer quote here it's in 1955. it's in the sermon the fundamental foundation for faith it's one of my one of my favorites actually brother bam says this and what you really catch is that man was made as a secondary god on earth praise the lord that was man in the beginning in other words that's man in the end as well because god's not gonna halfway redeem it amen man was made a secondary as a secondary god on the earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers is it the power that he was given to make himself is it's where he fell so notice in other words the power that he has actually the way that he fell you catch that listen satan didn't just the the bible tells us is that right and i believe it's the first timothy 3 the woman was deceived but the man wasn't deceived in other words he had to have the authority to give it up in the first place he had to do it willingness so he had the power and he chose by that same authority to forfeit it he forfeited it wasn't wrestled from him he forfeited his right to life to his inheritance to his fellowship he forces the book of redemption amen adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed adam he says now this is the beginning of man that's what god gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and fellowship fellowship with the father he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now brother ben calls it flues in other places talk about your channels your conscience your reasons affections memories imaginations they get clogged up through the unconscious and he forgets what he is he forgot what he was brother man says this now what adam was in god christ has not going to not in the process of christ has redeemed us back to that a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again adam never had to be sick he never had to die never had to worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was god's child and the child is heir of all things now he's not just talking about adam now i hope you catch he's talking about you and i today amen he says now when man fell he lost us and when he lost the fall christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the eternal fellowship and relationship to god to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all the adam lost in the fall we say what doesn't look like that well that's what hebrews the second chapter says we don't see all things under his feet why he says now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to his place man in the fall has lost his conscience of what the father put him on the earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the faith has been become clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things it's also clogged up until god can operate through those channels he made a man for praise the lord now i want to really just labor on that for a second amen because the channel is being clogged up the engine is not the problem amen i use this example i i i always have to qualify this i heard one time that you know you take an engine and you stuff a potato or something there in the exhaust or something blocks like blood you know you block the exhaust up i've heard it'll affect how the engine runs i do not necessarily need saying i know that by experience but it affects how the engine runs amen the engine is not the problem the outlet is the problem amen and so it's the same with the man god made men with these human outlets and he made them for the man to operate through amen so then the problem is not the heart it's the outlet it's not letting it through it's clogged up with business affair and domestic things troubles at work and home life or entertainment or whatever we let it get so clogged up god can't move through it anymore but i think it's really important to notice because god made those channels to use them amen i'm saying that for a reason because many times in the message even we take our mind we take our conscience our reasons our affections our memories our imaginations and we treat it like it's the enemy but it's only the enemy if it's carnal minded to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded his life in peace amen this doesn't have to be your enemy if you'll let god work through it and i use an example a lot of times but you take a young man you take a young woman they they get to be a you know a teenager and stuff and and a young man he begins to notice certain people he didn't notice before young girl she because of those people in her life that maybe she's played with her whole life stuff and she begins to notice them maybe they look a little bit different all of a sudden because they you know they become an adolescent and if we're not careful as a parent we we we either won't instruct that child or help them or we give them bad advice we just won't talk to them at all and this is why i'm saying this a lot of times that young person they they don't know how to handle a situation and they feel condemned or maybe we condemn them well you shouldn't feel that way about so-and-so and this and that but i want you to understand that young person has a natural affection and we live in an age where people have lost natural affection and people that lose their natural affection it's worse than when they had it the bible tells you what kind of reprobates they are so their affection is not the problem the problem is they don't know how to submit it to god listen son listen daughter listen person what you're feeling is normal but there's a right way and there's a wrong way to handle it and our job as christians as leaders as parents is to show them the right way not pretend it doesn't exist listen if they're becoming adults they have to deal with an adult situation so let's teach them like they're adults and when you when you when you when you you give them the brush off or you don't give them instruction where else are they going to go but the wrong way so we don't want to deny that listen uh your memory is a a great example i think of of the memory the human memory most many people live and defeat because of their memory they think about the things in their life they used to do they they look at other people's failures they look at other churches they look at all these things and it holds them back but david said i will not forget all his benefits amen his memory was surrendered to god god could use his memory to speak about the testimony of what god has done in his life now once you remember for you and i the only way we're going to overcome in this age is by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony you've got to have a testimony god wants to use your memory not as a place of defeat not as a place of condemnation but to bless you to make you an overcomer so your memory is not the problem if it's submitted to god amen so we can allow this to be our enemy or we can be renewed in the spirit of the mind and god can use your memory god can use your affections god can use your imagination thank god for all the different songs we get to sing we got to sing all these great songs this morning and i just i thank god god inspired somebody's imagination to do that yeah we understand the days and all their imaginations we're continually evil but that doesn't have to be you and i god can transform god can redeem that god can use it for his glory so let's not just throw out the baby with the bath water so to speak we don't want those things that are bad no we want god to use them that's god's psychology that's what god thinks about it amen i like this scripture at the beginning we're the first two verses but the verse the third verse that i read paul says this he says i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you to think of himself not to think of himself rather more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith now brother bram talks about this in the pregaming church age it's not different measures it's not a measure it's the measure amen in other words there is a measure that's given to the believer it's actually christ's faith in you so why you say what's this guy with the mind we many times think well i don't have faith for this well i wish i had faith for that i don't have faith that's the enemy lying to you because this message has a rapturing faith in it so you've got faith whether you recognize it you might be unconscious of it that doesn't change the fact that it's there it just changes the fact of how you're going to use it you say i wish i had more faith listen jesus own disciples said that one day they said increase our faith he said listen if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you can move a mountain hope you catch what i'm getting at today what you have in you today is enough to move a mountain it's enough to change your body it's enough to change the circumstances in your life if you just accept it don't fight it don't wrestle against it believe that god and you believe his word of course he believes his word he believed his own word at the beginning and he spoke everything into existence by it praise the lord i want you to notice this if you want you can turn there ephesians chapter one i'm gonna read verses 15 to 19 ephesians chapter one i just want to take a moment to lay this out here because paul is praying for the ephesian church now brother branham has made the point this is the most uh orderly church in the new testament and when he writes this their church is in order they understand mysteries they have doctrine they've got all these things lined up they're they're they're the church that we are to approximate ourselves to amen and paulie begins to pray for the ephesian church and i want you to notice how he prays because he does not pray the way lots of people pray about their church about their ministry about whatever it is paul does not pray for them to have a greater more gifts or a greater revival or some special anointing to come but watch what paul prays for the ephesian church he says this in verse 15 says wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints i cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you what the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what the hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power that is his wimpy defeated weak blown away power his mighty power so let me just summarize this for you in other words paul is praying for the ephesian church to recognize by revelation what they already have they don't need something new they don't need something greater they need to see what god's already given them you know not today we don't need another message we don't need another messenger we don't need a greater something or whatever god is given us by the message by his spirit everything we need all things that pertain to life and godliness it's yours now everything you need for your earthly journey you just have to recognize that god i pray today would give us eyes to see that's why the prophet said there's nothing of such prevailing power as revelation revelation in your life not in another man's life in your life revelation is prevailing power they say i need a greater prevailing power today get a greater revelation of what he's already done for you because what he's done for you it's enough listen it's not just enough it's more than enough he has done more than enough for you to overcome every adversary to over to surround any obstacle he has done more than enough for you if you can recognize it and that's what paul prays for them god made the spirit of wisdom and revelation open the eyes of their understanding to see what the greatness of his power it's in you the same power that spoke the worlds the same power that raised up christ it's in you right now and you think you need more power you think you need something else you've got the greatest thing that ever happened he's in you we are in our easter right now by the holy ghost god help us to see what he's already done in our lives because many times we miss it from domestic affair and business affair and the day-to-day of our life and we despise the days of small things and we forget that god is in us doing something and listen god's purpose in you it's not a little thing it's not an obscure thing god's purpose in you is greater than anything you could ask or think on your own god in you is capable of so much more than you let him do [Music] paul says in colossians chapter 2 you are complete this word in the the the greek it actually means you are filled or you are full you are filled in him or full in him who is the head of all principality and power that's why hallelujah that's why satan hates revelation because there's nothing that has such prevailing power in it that's why the prophet said he knows satan knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is can i take my liberty for just a moment i believe he's saying the same thing paul said watch this what she is the hope of his calling that's who she is it's the hope of his calling what she stands for the riches of the glory of his and your inheritance in the saints that's what we're standing for today that's why we preach the mysteries of god before we preach his promises that's our stand we're standing on it just like they did beyond the curtain of time you preach the same thing paul preached real this shouldn't surprise you and that she we all believe christ can do it she let me say this way you she can do the greater works the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe that's what paul said she can do why his power is in her to do it she will be an invincible army praise god we're not having to dig up a bunker and store three and a half years of canned goods i don't got to get a bigger flak jacket and buy more bullets i wish i could but they're expensive silver and gold i ain't gotten huh i praise the lord well listen i've got something that they don't have with all their bunker busters and their bunker buster bomb bunk proof bunker buster whatever they've got bigger bunkers and bigger bombs they've got bigger plans and plans within plans but i have something they don't have i've got a way of escape you've got something the most protected the most wealthy people in the world don't have the power of transformation you don't need an f-15 you don't need a space shuttle you don't have to get something from some mega millionaire somewhere you've got power in you to fly you've got power unit rise up it's in you now if you let it transform you you can rise above anything you can rise to any occasion you can do all things through christ jesus that strengthens [Applause] you should finish this quote if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless so i don't know why people make such a big deal out of him well the devil this the devil that well he's powerless before a believer that discerns his spirit vote you've recognized satan and overcoming him is recognizing him in his tricks if you can recognize that you've already defeated it as a christian because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world i'm gonna get up listen i i remember one of the first times i ever i dealt with somebody that had a spirit on him and stuff and and i won't get to the whole story but you know different people trying to do different things they were confused and i went and i spoke and i recognized it was an evil spirit and when i addressed that spirit that spirit spoke back i said you're going to come out in the name of jesus and that spirit said i will not come out that was his mistake [Music] well if you're really an evil spirit then i'm really greater than you by identifying yourself that you're in somebody you just made an easier target now i know i'm not gonna give up you know if you just sat there and and not said anything i had a question well maybe maybe i misread the situation maybe that was my imagination but as soon as that spirit identified itself it identified there was one greater there as well listen the devil's not afraid of me he's not afraid of you he's afraid of the one we represent and no wonder the devils tremble when a real son of god when a real daughter god walks in the room they recognize listen they know who paul was they knew who jesus was satan you might wonder who you are but satan knows exactly who a believer is and as soon as the devil begins to speak you've got him right where you want him you can't do nothing but lie anyway i said you will come out in the name of jesus christ he would deliver that same night i see all this for a reason amen he's powerless before you when you recognize who he is and what you've got how powerless is he was he kind of powerless i don't know how that would work it's powerless not sort of powerless but just in case you missed it he clarifies he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert how defeated is he he's that defeated he couldn't find one inch to get in there and he actually departed oh my praise the lord will the devil bother me here and the devil's chasing me here listen you can run him off that's what jesus did with us saith the lord [Applause] not some great gift not some great anointing and it is written and it is written today will defeat the adversary just as definitely today as it ever has oh my he says yes satan hates revelation but we love it [Applause] now you know why i love it so much i tell you what when you dip you around that honey and you taste it it tastes pretty good it's pretty good to get some victory ending amen i tell you when you've got victory over the enemy in your life there ain't nothing like it i can smell the scent of victory i can taste it on my left tell you what you get a taste for victory you won't want nothing else glory to god my my mind god is good oh he's good all the time there's honey in the rock today man there's something for you to dip your rod in here man ooh glory to god i'm not gonna get through this right now let's let's go here let's move brother all right real quick i want to touch on this word there's a word here it occurs multiple times in the new testament when paul's praying for the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him this is not the normal greek word uh gnosis for knowledge it's not a head knowledge this is not oh i went to seminary i studied it enough it's a different word epignosis amen it's the same root word as our as the greek word epiphaneo where we're getting epiphany from it's a full or a revealed thing it's something that god gives and it's perfect unto itself in other words god doesn't have to qualify it it doesn't have to he doesn't have to it has its own authority because it's given by revelation it's an epiphany you ever had an epiphany you know you wake up you're like whoa oh you know something come here that that perfect realization that's how brother brahma explains in the philadelphia church age there's a partial realization but there's a perfect realization listen when israel ate the bread in the wilderness and they ate that bread jesus said i'm the true bread he wasn't saying that wasn't bread that's not what he's saying he said that's the partial that's the type he says but i'm the anti-type i'm the true bread i'm the perfect realization i am what that was trying to declare unto you epinosis this is what it's about this is the full or the true or the faithful witness of it amen so in other words epinosis god is going to display his perfect realization about what he's spoken about this bride amen colossians chapter 3 verse 9 now paul says you put off the old man's stuff here verse verse 9 says you've put on the new man which is renewed we're talking about renewing today the renewing of the mind it is renewed in knowledge or epinosis after the image of him that created him in other words whatever that image of him looks like that's what you're gonna look like so the more you see what this is the more you're gonna be like it because this testifies of you listen the whole word is actually testifying of christ and his bride his plan of redemption from cover to cover from chapter one to the last chapter is speaking about his great love affair his purpose in redeeming a bride again ephesians chapter 4 be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you've put on the new man which is after god created in righteousness and true holiness it's his holiness amen i mentioned this earlier but i want you to remember the token of today it's only effective if it's on display it's not just enough to have a new man you must put on a new man what does that even mean it means to take upon you the identity of christ you have his potentials you have his not you're not the person of jesus christ but you are identified in his nature you're identified as his bride amen brother man talks about this in the supreme church change in the chapter i don't quote from the church's book a lot is that all right you know i go someplace to start throwing rocks at me praise the lord he said something about his book he's got a book somewhere amen brother man talks about he said pentecost believe that when you receive the new birth he said that they believe subsequently later you get the baptism of the holy ghost and the problem was that their idea of a new birth it was an intellectual conception well we got a new birth we acknowledge god but then later we're going to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and then we'll have power but brother brown makes the point life and power come together in other words if you have his life you have his power you don't have one and not the other amen to have his power is to have his life to have his life is to have his power that's why they're one and the same praise the lord so the problem is our worldly thinking amen but the man makes this statement humble thyself 63 he says just get away from all your worldly thinking humble yourself before god and you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself [Music] what's stopping me from realizing who i'm supposed to be in christ is it the pastor the deacon brother so-and-so my wife my husband i hope you don't feel that way but if you do that's not who it is your biggest obstacle is you when you can conquer you you've got more power than a man that can run around you've got more power than a man that's been elected you've got more power than a dictator you've got power to conquer yourself and he that rules his spirit he's greater than them that can rule a city he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty real powers power over your own flesh he says that's really power you show me a church you got to show it to him now gotta be on display now amen you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god in it i pray god let it be here today if the world don't see it may that be god's testimony that god sees a church here today with the humility and the character and the power of christ on display people that praise for revelation because like i said the image you're looking at is the image you're going to reflect familiar scripture here ii corinthians the third chapter paul says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty get ready to go to liberty here hey man get ready for july 4th listen you've got a greater listen we got liberty from the british 200 and i'm not going to count it right now i should have counted for the sermon it used to be a little bit faster this lesson in in just under 300 years look at the direction of this country look at the things that have happened the liberty they they bled for and they suffered for and they died for it's not what it was back then but you've got a liberty where they put you in the darkest cell they can put you in jail like paul and silas but you're the freest people that's ever lived on the face of the earth because you're free in christ where the spirit of the lord is i ask you is he here today if he's here today where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty [Music] don't be entangled again stand fast in this liberty we all with open face beholdings in a glass or a mirror the glory of the lord were changed in the same image from glory to glory even it's by the spirit of the lord now some people stop there and they say well you know i i see the tapes i read the bible i do all these things but james talks about the same thing i want you to notice how he qualifies this here in james chapter two i'm sorry chapter 1 verse 22. he says but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving who your own selves who's deceiving you your own self your own self's the problem deceiving your own selves if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man be holding his natural face in a glass or a mirror again same thing paul was talking about for he beholdeth himself and he goes his way and straightway forgetteth he forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so in other words if your knowledge of the word of god exceeds your obedience to the word of god you're backslidden it doesn't matter how much you can shout or jump or dance amen you you must conform yourself not to the world but to this word of god this is a second handed robe you you don't cut it to fit you you've got to grow into it amen we've we've got a capstone ministry listen the whole world's looking for this you say why why does it seem like things are getting worse and worse all the time because the world's getting worse and worse but why it's groaning it's travailing because it's trying to produce something and the same thing's in you it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it's waiting for something to come on display it's waiting for transforming power that's in the sons of god now amen praise the lord peter says this if he talks about the statue of a perfect man he says if these things be in you and abound they make you you shall neither be buried nor unfruitful in the knowledge epignosis of our lord jesus christ but he that lacks these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten he does it again forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore brother give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall i believe that's why there's a bride predestined not to fall in this age she's predestined because the word says if these things are in you and they are by the message you say how do you know because the capstone of it came down if it's in you ye shall never fall you're not talking about your naturality he's talking about the power of transformation you can fall seven times and get right back up because the power is in you to do it praise the lord i want to read this here a quick token message 63 brother ram says not only was jesus just a human life to come back on us it was god himself manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now amen now we are the sons and daughters of god that is the token what are you saying brother the life of christ on display that we are now somebody say now now we are now the sons and daughters of god that's the token so let me say it this way if there's no adoption there is no token because they come together it's for the same purpose the manifestation of the sons of god see other seeds have had an anointing but they didn't have sonship amen that's why there's no token outside of adoption because there's no life to bear witness according to galatians 4 his spirit in you bears witness it is a representation or a token that we are the sons of god whereby we cry abba father i'll give you this i want to talk about this for a second here when abram when he goes by the ward of the lord and decaying and he leaves the land of ur and he comes the land of canaan he found that when he was in that promised land though god told him to be there he lacked the ability to produce the promised son and and years go by and he realizes that as the years go by he gets weaker all the time here's abram he knows he's called there and god comes and speaks to him and he lets him know listen i'm going to put myself into your name you're no longer to be called abram i'm going to call you abraham a father of nations now this is a man that's almost 100 years old i call you a father of nations i'm changing your name i'm giving you a different identification and abram's looking himself abraham how am i going to do this i think i go charles this eleazar he's the air my house god says i'm going to do it i'm going to perform it according to the time of life at the appointed hour i will produce it listen abram and abraham in his own strength he tries to do it and he fails and listen abraham doesn't even want to go along with it he's oh god that ishmael might live before you forever no you're going to have a son it's not going to be according to your ability but in your weakness and your inability i will produce a promise you and sarah she shall conceive and you shall have a child how was he going to do it by the power of transformation their bodies were unable to produce the promise but god had a transformation and when they were transformed they would find the ability to overcome they would find the power to produce the promise that was not there before a father of nations brother represent a type of the adoption he said abraham h a m god added his that the the letter in there we put it in our our modern english h.a.m brother said never throw out all the church history have you ever had one h.a.m seven letters we've had a gram but when this one comes h.a.m seven letters i believe we've had it in this age william marion branham b-r-a-h p-r-a-n-h-a-m i should really put this stuff down well they were ignorant unlearned too i guess listen this prophet this messenger this is unlike any other ministry we've ever had it's a representation of the same thing that abraham received will kill it come and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart this prophet this prophet is different than other men he received an everlasting sign when brother brown was running on the truck one day brother baby said look at that mountain range over there look at them seven peaks that represents your life your ministry i'm gonna give you an everlasting sign i do believe i don't believe god just gave that sign for the man william branham i believe he give it for us who under this ministry are caught in the adoption of sons what makes us different than any other group of people on the face of the earth or even other groups that just claim to believe the message well the church the churches go into the tribulation for their purification but we don't why because we've been identified by a prophet look we didn't identify ourselves that way we've been identified by a messenger h.a.m as the bride of jesus christ that's what makes it the same melchizedek that spoke back there has taken a veil in this day and spoken to us and performed the same works to call you under the fullness of adoption he's visited us again according to the time of life amen notice abraham's overcoming was found in transformation he could not overcome he could not produce the promise till he had been transformed amen listen god couldn't give abraham he said well yeah ishmael good job man that's totally i i think of that god doesn't need your thought god has it all thought out already amen his thought was before the foundation of the world abraham didn't need to produce a promise in his own strength he needed to try to help god he needed transformed according to the word of god transformation brought the ability to produce the promise amen god waits till they're in their feebleness to transform them back to their youth amen i submit to you as i'm closing here this afternoon i submit to you that many of the things in our life that we wrestle with we wrestle with it because god is wanting transformation in our lives we look at problems we look at fires we look at things say we need to pray about this and fix this and fix that many times we miss the biggest obstacle is our own will about it our own attitude about it because god's not just wanting to fix a problem he's willing to transform you to where you can overcome the problem like he did with abraham you know i think of peter when he was there in the garden with jesus and they they come to take our lord as a robber you know peter sees a problem he does what most pulls out of the sword and chops the ear off that'll show him we'll run him out of here jesus like no put that away you're missing the bigger picture listen jesus if jesus wanted to now remember this he's quite capable it's not outside of his ability he is able to change the situation in a moment he can call for 12 legions of angels and change the whole scene he could wipe out the whole earth the problem is not as a lack of ability but peter was missing the bigger picture it's not about how big the sword is it's not about if i can wipe these guys out jesus has to go there he's missing the bigger picture listen the biggest problem that night the the only thing that stood between us redemption that night was not peter it wasn't judas it wasn't the guards there was one thing that stood between redemption for us or damnation it was jesus christ's own will his own will there was this i'm talking about the savior and i'm not talking about a man born in sin his will was the only thing that would have stood in the way but he prayed and he said father nevertheless not my will thine be done and when he prayed that and he made that his stand there was enough powers in hell to stop him that night [Applause] oh my how many times in our own life we look at the problem maybe your will your own idea because i want you to remember what we read at the beginning be transformed that you might prove what is that good acceptable perfect will of god not your will his will in other words you cannot prove the will of god until your mind is transformed and must be transformed so you can prove the good acceptable and perfect will of god many times in our own will we go about trying to remedy whatever problems in our way we we say circumstances and and we know how we want it resolved and we miss what god's trying to do amen but i believe that the more god lives in you and the more god sees through you the more you'll see him at work amen may god help us i pray today to transform our way of thinking about that person that persecutes us man about our attitude uh may god transform our attitudes towards our circumstances at home or at work or whatever it is amen listen we might face a lot of criticism in our life but i want you to understand god sees something in you that he can transcend that god's not looking to take away the critics he's looking for you to live in a place where it doesn't affect you can i tell a story here real quick i was just talking to brother yesterday about this we're talking about people with complexes and how they get an attitude and you know some people they some people just won't like you no matter what you do and when you get to a place in your life you stop trying to please everybody you're a lot further up the road but i was talking about a certain person i didn't tell him who and i'm not going to tell you don't ask this this person's got like nothing nice to say about me well i don't have a whole lot to say either i guess so not me not them no they they said this about me and they've called me this name they've they've said to other people all these things about me i was talking to this brother about i said you know what that person realized they were blessing me the whole time say really brother how's that i said the bible says blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you he didn't know he was blessing me the whole time every time he opens his mouth and calls me another filthy name i said he's just blessing me he don't even realize it blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say oh man interview about you falsely for my name sake don't get upset don't cry about us oh god i wish i wouldn't say those things rejoice you're missing the point god's blessing you rejoice and be exceeding glad for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you god is allowing you to be identified with the same reproach that the prophets and men of old word identified with yes you know brook i'm about you but praise god praise god they had something to say about me today now don't give them something mean to say about you listen if they say it about you and there's no reason to say it you are a partaker of the same thing that christ was a partaker of the reproaches from them that fell on thee they fell on me see you you don't have to you don't have to stop what they're saying you just transcend trent you don't you know what praise god they're blessed listen if they say something nice about you they're blessing you they say something mean about you they're blessing you either way you're just blessed all the time if you can see it well that helps somebody today amen next time somebody calls you something like praise god thank you for blessing me just look around the i tell you what that'll probably make him more mad than anything actually it usually does well you're just such a such thank you so much god sure loves me god i sure used you to bless me it's all right take a break for a minute praise the lord listen if you can't transcend criticism and embrace our attitude you can never be a partaker of that blessing if you can't rejoice and be exceeding glad that persecutions you can't ever partake that blessing there must be a transformation because listen i'll be honest my old man in that situation had a deck the guy that wasn't me there's a new man on the inside doing that that's not you enduring it christ in you he's the one doing it rejoice and be exceeding glad great is your reward oh my listen the power lies in you by the holy it's not about special meaning it's not about special anointing the power of transformation in you will make you a partaker of that blessing amen how many here are witnesses of the power of transformation because you're not what you used to be listen lots of people change in their lives we see people change all the time and lots of times it's not for the better well listen the transformation i'm talking about for you it's for your good amen it's not it's not a replacement it's an upgrade there's no downside to it this isn't like when then microsoft updates you update your computer that crashes for three weeks i thought that's not an upgrade they ruined my computer i had to restart the whole you know praise god so you know what i'm talking about oh here we're going to upgrade your computer takes five minutes that was the worst thing i ever did with my computer and throw that thing out they ask me about once a month you want to upgrade to windows 11. no i don't been there but sure is bad it was my computer whatever listen there's no downside to this upgrade amen amen god's power of transformation it's an upgrade for us we thank god for it amen you're not what you used to be but you're gonna be what he wants you to be listen if you're in the hand of god you're exactly what he wants you to be you might not feel like but you're exactly what he wants you to be right now if you can accept that and thank god for it think about how much how much lighter the burdens get you know the scripture says jesus said that my yoke is easy my burdens light a lot of us we find ourselves encumbered all the time with just loads of care i just don't i'm gonna make it you're carrying a yolk he didn't put on you lay it down you weren't meant to carry that you're some you're transformed you're you're not there to bear those kind of that's the world amen you've got something else to bear his yoke amen the power lies in you the rapture lies in you it's the power of transformation the power to transform it's the power to transcend amen not just overcome a problem but transcend it amen god bless you just stand to your feet oh i believe the seed of abraham is present today like their father abraham this transforming power in them to transcend the situations and the inabilities and the complexes that they're wrestling with today church i believe there's a great liberty here by the spirit it's the greatest liberty you'll ever know it's the freedom from yourself the freedom from your past the freedom from your own misgivings the freedom from pride the freedom from whatever would would trouble you in your lives as you bow your heads maybe today you we're all we're all dealing with something i don't have to ask for a show of hands every one of us is dealing with something if we weren't we we'd probably already been glory i guess as you bow your heads though meditate today what you're going through i want you to realize god put something in you [Music] to transform our attitudes the way we look at things our perspective so many times we're limited by how we look at a situation i pray today we just look to god and say lord show me the bigger picture lord help me to see what you're trying to do in my life lord i've let so many things distract me i want my heart to be fastened after your will i want to be steadfast unmoving always abounding in the work of the lord as we pray i just want you to pray yourselves as well pray with me today for that need in your life god help us as we pray heavenly father what i'm so thankful today when i go through certain situations in my life i recognize there's been a change there's been a change in me but i've made many mistakes i've missed the picture many times but it seems like we're just full of mistakes like your prophet said a prophetess told us that god could even take these mistakes in our life and use them to fulfill his purpose lord i pray for each one today as they're praying the different needs in their lives or their homes and families [Music] many times we go through things and we wonder lord [Music] why am i going through this [Music] why is this come upon me but lord you're you're changing us you're bringing us up a little bit higher you're putting us in a position to have a testimony of overcoming it might be a help to another believer here today it might be help to a wayward loved one whatever it would be lord you're using our lives and it's transforming power to transform others as well lord we may we lay down once again our wills today may we allow the power of transformation to change the way we think about ourselves about others about your will may we not read this bible like a newspaper with our own ideas and trying to find our opinion in these pages but may we allow the word of god to shape and to mold and to fashion us from glory to glory from faith to virtue to knowledge all the way into this capstone i believe perfect love it's the greatest thing we could ever ask for it's the greatest gift we could ever receive it's the only thing that has the transforming the overcoming power to take us into that dimension lord i pray for each one here today may you bless them surely blessing may you bless the seed of abraham may you exceedingly abundantly bless them and cause your face to shine upon them lord we give you the praise and the glory and the honor now we thank you for this beautiful group of people your children in jesus christ's name amen god bless you today brother for a long time i traveled down a long lonely road [Music] my heart was so heavy [Music] then i
