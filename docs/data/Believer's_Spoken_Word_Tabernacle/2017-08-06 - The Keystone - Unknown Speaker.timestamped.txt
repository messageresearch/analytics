[41:39] they want to greet you in the name of
[41:43] the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:46] certain they're good to be with you than
[41:51] with other congregations the meeting but
[41:58] it's certainly good good to be here and
[42:01] good to be home I didn't get any amen on
[42:07] that song you might say oh my Thank You
[42:18] Matthew 27 let's read verse 50
[42:29] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[42:32] loud voice yielded up the ghost and
[42:36] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[42:39] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[42:42] the earth did quake and the rocks rent
[42:45] and the graves were open in many bodies
[42:49] of the saints which slept arose and came
[42:53] out of the graves after his resurrection
[42:56] and went into the holy city and appeared
[43:01] unto many amen we want to look here at
[43:07] thought this morning the key stone the
[43:12] key stone may God bless you bless His
[43:15] Word as you're being seated I don't
[43:22] think that it came through the picture
[43:25] but you'll see it on the notes when they
[43:28] would send those out later but probably
[43:30] every one of you have you've seen an
[43:34] arch and meaning that of a an arch where
[43:39] you have the stones that are assembled
[43:41] and they come from the ground and it it
[43:44] comes together here in in the middle and
[43:49] that's what we're that's what we're
[43:52] looking at because the Keystone itself
[43:55] is the actual stone that sets in the
[44:00] very center that joins that together for
[44:05] the arch and to know that the very the
[44:10] Keystone when we are looking at all of
[44:14] this that the Keystone itself and every
[44:18] arch when an arch is made there's many
[44:22] different arches and one that out
[44:23] particularly referred to a few that have
[44:27] been constructed within the world and
[44:29] every one of those arches that have been
[44:32] constructed have depicted many great
[44:36] victories battles that have been won so
[44:40] they're not just for naught but there is
[44:43] purpose and there's a significance
[44:45] behind their construction it is a
[44:48] memorial it is something that is set
[44:50] forth that others can recognize and
[44:53] visit and and see the those things that
[44:56] have taken place and when we look at
[44:59] this in the the life of the Lord Jesus
[45:03] knowing that in all things that the Lord
[45:07] Jesus himself is the very keystone of
[45:12] all things we recognize that as we look
[45:17] back even and think of the in the
[45:19] beginning when there the fall had come
[45:23] in the beginning but yet God Himself
[45:26] reserved unto himself that I will make a
[45:30] way back he said I will give you a seed
[45:34] and his seed shall bruise the head is
[45:38] his head and his and his seed shall
[45:41] bruise his heel we see we see all of
[45:44] this that is spoken and prophetically
[45:46] and we recognize that as we've looked at
[45:49] this over the the course of months is
[45:51] that it for for God these things are not
[45:54] just things that the Lord is just
[45:56] thinking through and things are just
[45:58] coming up on the spot but all things the
[46:01] whole plan has already been laid out
[46:04] before there was Adam Stotler molecule
[46:08] and the prophet puts it like this and
[46:10] the Hebrew says he says before it was
[46:12] God he said God predestinated you the
[46:17] plan itself was set already so before or
[46:20] anything had come into existence and the
[46:23] whole plan the whole part is that he
[46:25] himself would be the theme and would be
[46:29] what is the central of all things that
[46:33] that it would be him that everything
[46:35] points to we look at this with the with
[46:39] the Keystone in itself and we find that
[46:42] here in D in the resurrection where here
[46:46] the scripture speaks in verse 52 that
[46:48] the graves were open and many bodies of
[46:50] the saints which slept arose and came
[46:54] out of the grace after here
[46:56] resurrection brother branham says it
[46:59] like this and the message at Kadesh
[47:01] Barnea he says all the Old Testament and
[47:04] all its characters and characteristics
[47:07] was only a foreshadow of the wedge or
[47:11] the Keystone the New Testament that
[47:14] joins law and this dispensation together
[47:19] so when we look at that that Keystone I
[47:23] want to just look at here just for some
[47:26] moments is to see that within that of
[47:28] the arch that there are the stones that
[47:31] are placed within that arch and then the
[47:35] very Keystone itself being the focus
[47:38] being that of the wedge and the the
[47:41] great stone that comes to reside and
[47:43] join that together and make that an
[47:46] indeed an arc of triumph we see that how
[47:51] that when we're looking down through the
[47:53] ages that it's all of those where the
[47:57] scripture says many of the saints which
[47:59] slept it didn't say all of them not all
[48:02] of the Old Testament Saints arose and
[48:04] his resurrection but there was a select
[48:07] few that arose when he arose they were
[48:12] they were privileged in their generation
[48:16] to recognize Christ and his visitation
[48:20] in their generation it wasn't their
[48:23] merits it wasn't that they were better
[48:26] than anybody else
[48:27] it was the sovereignty of Almighty God
[48:29] and we look at that even you think of
[48:33] even in Abraham's life Abraham would
[48:35] have continued doing what he was doing
[48:38] but it was the plan that God had for
[48:41] Abraham's life in interrupted Abraham's
[48:44] life of what he thought his life was
[48:47] going to go but God had other plans and
[48:50] they were plans that was before Abraham
[48:53] was ever walking upon this earth and God
[48:56] moved to speak to Abram and spoke to his
[49:00] heart and Abraham walked after the Lord
[49:03] he left where he was that and begin to
[49:06] walk after the Lord and we find that
[49:08] when we look at the
[49:09] that many of the saints which slept they
[49:12] arose we recognized and we see that if
[49:16] there were in in the in the Old
[49:18] Testament there were over comers because
[49:21] when we're looking at it that each one
[49:23] of those over comers when you think of
[49:25] how that Abraham himself he is led by
[49:29] God and inspired to by that cave of
[49:32] machpelah that that would be a place of
[49:35] burial remember they were going to give
[49:36] it to him but he would not take it it
[49:39] was a cost to it and you know there's a
[49:41] cost to serving the Lord there's a cost
[49:44] to everything you do nothing comes easy
[49:47] there's nothing that's given to us
[49:49] there's a cost for it there's a cost
[49:51] when you desire your healing there's a
[49:53] cost and deliverance there's a cost to
[49:55] walk as a Christian there is a cost and
[49:58] that cost is yes that cost is yielding
[50:01] that cost is surrendering it there's
[50:04] there's a price that must be paid and
[50:06] then we we find that how that all of
[50:09] them all of those prophets and those
[50:11] move down through the time that even how
[50:14] they were inspired by God to be buried
[50:18] there in Palestine it was revealed to
[50:21] them that that's the place of the
[50:23] resurrection that's the place where the
[50:26] Messiah was going to come and they were
[50:28] moved by God even in those times and you
[50:31] know friends Allah said they didn't have
[50:33] the Canon of Scripture that you and I
[50:35] have they didn't have that they there
[50:37] wasn't a scriptures that they could just
[50:39] go back on in a Canon of scriptures but
[50:41] now in this hour here the entire book of
[50:45] Redemption the HAI entire scriptures all
[50:48] of these things are laid out for you and
[50:50] I and the Spirit of God quickening that
[50:52] why because it's needful for you and I
[50:55] in this hour that the faith that is
[50:58] greater than all that's been down
[51:00] through this earth and that is a
[51:01] rapturing faith that will literally
[51:04] change your little bodies it's and
[51:08] there's a greater need and only that no
[51:10] only one who can supply that greater
[51:12] need is a greater one they're gathered
[51:17] to their people Jacob himself standing
[51:19] there and Egypt before solid and he said
[51:23] don't when you when God visits you don't
[51:26] leave my bones here but take her with
[51:30] you and bury me in the land of my
[51:34] father's
[51:35] they knew there was a promise that was
[51:38] there that promise was pulsating in
[51:40] their lives
[51:42] that's why the scripture could say in
[51:45] Hebrews 11 these all died in faith not
[51:49] having received the promises but having
[51:52] seen them afar off and were persuaded of
[51:55] them and embraced them and confessed
[51:56] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[51:59] the earth for they that say such things
[52:02] declare plainly that they seek a country
[52:05] and truly if they had been mindful of
[52:07] that country from whence they came out
[52:09] they matter that opportunity to have
[52:11] returned but now they desire a better
[52:14] country
[52:15] then as a heavenly wherefore God is not
[52:18] ashamed to be called their God for he
[52:20] hath prepared for them a city they all
[52:24] died in the faith this scripture this
[52:27] did what we're looking at even in
[52:29] Hebrews 11 we know that this is God's
[52:31] Hall of Fame
[52:33] there's many other we could look down in
[52:36] the Old Testament you'll find many
[52:38] wonderful men and women down to the
[52:42] scripture but there is an elect and let
[52:45] me say it like this
[52:46] there's many wonderful people in this
[52:48] world there's many wonderful people that
[52:51] that they walk according to all they
[52:53] know they're looking to the Lord Jesus
[52:55] as their Savior but they don't know him
[52:57] as Redeemer now I know a lot of times
[53:00] it's said that he is Redeemer and they
[53:03] but the way that they look at redemption
[53:05] as though that it's something I'm coming
[53:08] to instead of recognizing it's God
[53:10] that's bringing you to what you always
[53:13] were redemption is not merit able
[53:17] redemption is sovereignly given by God
[53:21] it was God Himself that determined
[53:24] before anything that he would bring you
[53:27] and I back to himself Redemption is not
[53:30] by self effort
[53:31] redemption is not my self merit
[53:34] not by whoops let's we should vote it is
[53:37] sovereignly by the grace of God it's
[53:40] caught dealing on your heart it's God
[53:42] drawing you to himself it's God
[53:44] reconciling you and I that's a true
[53:48] gathering that's a true reconciling and
[53:51] all of these having died in the faith
[53:55] they were waiting with anticipation they
[54:00] didn't see everything I know a lot of
[54:03] this is familiar territory but they did
[54:05] not see everything but what they did see
[54:08] is what God had made known to them and
[54:11] they walked faithful to what God had
[54:14] revealed let me just put this very
[54:16] clearly what God reveals is not
[54:18] something from the past God takes that
[54:22] which has been spoken and he reveals it
[54:26] and it's not something from the past but
[54:29] it is prescient when he revealed himself
[54:31] to Moses he said I am that I am is he
[54:35] reveals himself as the prescient God
[54:38] because you can't work toward a goal if
[54:40] the goals back there is all right Paul
[54:44] said I press toward the mark of the high
[54:46] calling in Christ Jesus our Lord we're
[54:49] not looking back with we're looking
[54:51] forward they meant we're looking unto
[54:54] Jesus who's the author and the finisher
[54:56] of our faith they meant not looking back
[54:59] but we're looking we're walking just as
[55:02] faithful as Abraham walk just as
[55:04] faithful as Noah walk just as faithful
[55:06] as each one of them walked in the faith
[55:11] they didn't receive the promises but yet
[55:16] they themselves embraced what God had
[55:20] given to them look at Noah Noah here by
[55:25] God God reveals himself to Noah and he
[55:30] makes himself known to Noah and Noah's
[55:32] life becomes so occupied with what God's
[55:36] revealed you see when your life is not
[55:40] occupied by what God's revealed then
[55:43] there's a problem either he's not
[55:46] revealed it
[55:47] or there's distractions that's come
[55:52] there were all kinds of tests and trials
[55:55] and everything that tried to come
[55:57] between Noah and the message that God
[55:59] had given him there was frustrations we
[56:02] don't read it in the scripture but we
[56:04] recognize that this was not I can say it
[56:08] like this a superhero's comic book where
[56:11] everything goes right in place and if it
[56:12] isn't going my way I just speak it out
[56:14] of existence it don't work that way
[56:17] there by faith where they had none
[56:20] sometimes where Noah had to persevere
[56:22] beyond what he knew himself to be that's
[56:27] why the Prophet said he was an ordinary
[56:29] farmer oh my love how that's placed in
[56:33] this hour he was not he said he was not
[56:36] any type of an architect it wouldn't
[56:39] make sense to have an architect if you
[56:41] were going to call somebody to your
[56:42] house to do plumbing it would make sense
[56:44] that they at least knew something about
[56:45] it is that right don't call me no I do
[56:51] know some about plumbing but you
[56:54] understand but God does not call people
[56:58] who know something Paul said that minute
[57:02] you see said how the minute my hind
[57:04] wives are called that God causes the
[57:06] weak and the base things of this world
[57:09] why does he do that to prove his glory
[57:12] through because it's not something that
[57:16] you or I are able to do but God himself
[57:20] through a yielded life surrendered to
[57:22] him God performs his word here they were
[57:26] surrendered we know that how they came
[57:29] into this place here they arm died they
[57:33] died in the faith they died expecting
[57:37] and no we find that here here they are
[57:39] in the bosom of Abraham as the
[57:42] Scriptures speak to us they were in
[57:44] paradise there was a place that was
[57:46] being held it wasn't hell but it was a
[57:48] place that was being held and and
[57:50] reserved in waiting for the fullness of
[57:53] the atonement to come so here we find
[57:57] that how the Lord Jesus himself the
[57:59] Scriptures speak in
[58:01] the book of Hebrews chapter 2 that just
[58:03] as the children were partakers of flesh
[58:05] and blood he also himself likewise took
[58:07] part of the same that through death he
[58:09] might destroy him that had the power of
[58:11] death that is the devil and deliver them
[58:14] who through fear of death were all their
[58:15] lifetime subject to bondage they walk
[58:20] they walked they walked free the
[58:23] Scriptures they declare that to us and
[58:25] we recognize that when God has done a
[58:28] work in our own life we walk not of this
[58:31] world that's what Jesus said is a dime
[58:35] in this world I'm not off this world you
[58:39] and me might look and say well you know
[58:41] our natural birth but the spiritual
[58:43] birth we are not of this world there has
[58:48] got to come a reality there there's got
[58:51] to come a call there must come a
[58:52] presence there must come one from that
[58:55] other land that makes contact with you
[58:58] that you can recognize there is a
[59:00] greater land they meant there's a
[59:03] greater life there's a greater wall
[59:05] there's a real substance there's a real
[59:07] reality that must come Melchizedek and
[59:11] pass by your way that you might know
[59:15] there is a land Amen that's why Paul
[59:21] could say the gospel of your salvation
[59:23] it takes a living word by the Living God
[59:26] setting down in that word and making
[59:30] that word live in a real and unless the
[59:33] people know they're not called to
[59:35] theology but they are called into the
[59:37] very presence of the Living God the
[59:40] life-changer the Redeemer hallelujah
[59:45] they made it takes the gospel of our
[59:47] salvation to break all things around us
[59:52] amen that's why it takes the Word of God
[59:54] if not it's a continuing on but if all
[59:58] you do is build a wall that's all you've
[1:00:00] got
[1:00:00] but God ain't building walls that's what
[1:00:04] man do God don't build walls God dwells
[1:00:08] in a house
[1:00:12] here's a water they were subject of
[1:00:16] their lifetime remember Jojo crying out
[1:00:20] what happens to a man if he dies I see
[1:00:22] what happens with the tree right now
[1:00:26] these things begin to look how God went
[1:00:28] in spot to where job was looking at the
[1:00:31] simplicity bringing these things up
[1:00:33] meditating on the deal don't you see
[1:00:35] friends God Himself if we'll give our
[1:00:38] lives just like what was preached here
[1:00:39] on Thursday night God will move by his
[1:00:42] word to cause you and I to dwell on that
[1:00:45] which his life and God will come right
[1:00:47] down through that word and make himself
[1:00:49] known to us hey man Joe was witnessing
[1:00:53] and seeing God that there is a
[1:00:55] resurrection and God from there inspires
[1:00:59] Joe to her Joe could say though the skin
[1:01:01] worms destroy this body my skin worms
[1:01:05] yet in my flesh shall I see God I know
[1:01:10] my Redeemer liveth here they were in
[1:01:18] paradise
[1:01:20] they were overcomers in their day you
[1:01:27] know when you look at this Arch of
[1:01:31] Triumph it's in Paris
[1:01:36] there is there's a couple different ones
[1:01:39] but the one that's the arc of triumph
[1:01:45] it's one of those that where it depicts
[1:01:48] upon it those who fought and died for
[1:01:52] friends in the French revolutionary and
[1:01:55] and the Napoleonic Wars with the names
[1:02:00] of all French victories and Generals
[1:02:02] inscribed on its inner and outer
[1:02:05] surfaces then you know it has the below
[1:02:09] it lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
[1:02:11] from World War one then we find that it
[1:02:16] goes on to tell us that the arc of track
[1:02:18] was designed and has in its design there
[1:02:22] were even where it depicted many of the
[1:02:25] French youths that were going against
[1:02:27] German warriors in another time and this
[1:02:32] is what it this is what they had said
[1:02:34] and what I was reading about it said it
[1:02:37] set the tone for public monuments with
[1:02:42] triumphant patriotic messages I want to
[1:02:46] read that again yeah they're talking
[1:02:48] about this arc of triumph it set the
[1:02:51] tone for public monuments with
[1:02:54] triumphant patriotic messages you're not
[1:02:59] find one message of defeat in the arc of
[1:03:04] triumph that's why in the arc of triumph
[1:03:08] Christ Jesus every word every promise is
[1:03:14] yay and amen there is no defeat in him
[1:03:21] there's been a lot of battles and you
[1:03:23] can look back and say well they've done
[1:03:25] some things that's been lost here and
[1:03:27] there you can look in Abraham's life
[1:03:28] look in Noah's life
[1:03:29] look at all that God allowed that
[1:03:31] humanity to be displaced but what you
[1:03:34] need to focus on is the end result is
[1:03:37] that in spite of all humanity that the
[1:03:40] very purpose and sovereignty of God
[1:03:42] prevailed in their life when they felt
[1:03:47] like giving up their
[1:03:49] strength from within that propelled them
[1:03:52] onward radar is he that is in you than
[1:03:56] he that's in the world when Abraham
[1:03:59] could not figure out how in the world is
[1:04:02] this child gonna come and he laughs
[1:04:04] right there in Genesis 17 but yet God
[1:04:07] Himself takes that look that laughter
[1:04:10] and he doesn't smite Abraham down but
[1:04:13] what does not do God provides strength
[1:04:15] we know God provides strength there is a
[1:04:18] transition that even happened between
[1:04:20] seventeen and eighteen because you don't
[1:04:23] find Abraham laughing but yet his wife
[1:04:26] is laughing but in the midst of that
[1:04:29] path after that visitation her laughter
[1:04:31] is dissolved also who did it Christ in
[1:04:40] Abraham's life he was the key stone in
[1:04:43] Sarah's life he was the key stone what
[1:04:48] seemed to be impossible and it was
[1:04:51] impossible with them but with God
[1:04:54] nothing shall be thought to be
[1:04:57] impossible
[1:04:59] hallelujah oh my the Bible says I look
[1:05:05] at this of how these over comers in
[1:05:07] their lifetime how that they lived if I
[1:05:12] can just read this here Justin referring
[1:05:14] to it it speaks in the book of Hebrews
[1:05:17] 11 verse 32 it says concerning the time
[1:05:21] would fail me to tell of gideon barak
[1:05:24] samson of and of jeff of david also and
[1:05:29] samuel of the prophets who through faith
[1:05:33] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[1:05:35] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[1:05:38] lions who through faith it was through
[1:05:42] faith that did that that faith that
[1:05:45] which god had revealed faith you realize
[1:05:47] faith we can't work ourselves up in
[1:05:48] faith when God prepared Daniel to go in
[1:05:52] the lion's den it was exactly that God
[1:05:55] prepared him to stand there when it came
[1:05:58] time for the Hebrew furnace God prepared
[1:06:01] them to stand
[1:06:02] you say what didn't they prepare all the
[1:06:04] time they were they were prepared to be
[1:06:06] prepared for that moment amen that's
[1:06:11] like God himself working in our life if
[1:06:13] the Bible said that the righteousness of
[1:06:15] God is revealed from faith unto faith is
[1:06:19] that right
[1:06:20] it's God sovereignly revealing himself
[1:06:22] and faith is not something we work
[1:06:24] ourselves up into but faith is
[1:06:26] sovereignly given by Almighty God
[1:06:29] hey man it's where we submit our lives
[1:06:32] to the Lord it's where we embrace the
[1:06:35] Lord it's where we embrace what God has
[1:06:38] made known to us it's where we walk
[1:06:39] faithful to him in all things oh my the
[1:06:44] Bible says he quenched they quenched the
[1:06:46] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[1:06:49] sword out of weakness were made strong
[1:06:51] waxed Vallon and fight turned to flight
[1:06:53] the armies of the aliens and these are
[1:06:56] stones that are part of that arc these
[1:06:59] are stones that are part of the arch
[1:07:02] they meant guiding putting weak crumbly
[1:07:05] stones in there how could how could you
[1:07:09] put weak crumbly stones and then put a
[1:07:11] key stone up there he won't make it but
[1:07:15] better Samuel they one week I know they
[1:07:18] were weak but he was strong in them you
[1:07:23] can be strong and be weak then again you
[1:07:28] can be weak and he can be strong it just
[1:07:32] depends remember we can't have two waves
[1:07:34] at one time it's either his way or our
[1:07:36] way is that right but when we can get
[1:07:40] our stuff out of the way then God can
[1:07:42] have the right away women received their
[1:07:46] dead raised and life again huh I love
[1:07:49] how that's mentioned here let's say know
[1:07:52] that there were sisters of old who were
[1:07:55] faithful to stand upon God's Word
[1:07:59] amen there was widows in the day a day
[1:08:02] of Elijah right first the son the boy
[1:08:07] had passed but where did she take him
[1:08:09] she took him in the prophets chamber
[1:08:12] come on somebody took him into a place
[1:08:14] of life then we found in the time of
[1:08:17] Elijah here was another Widow and and
[1:08:20] and her son that had been given to her
[1:08:22] here he passes away in the heat of the
[1:08:24] day but what does she do she puts him in
[1:08:27] the prophet's chamber she doesn't know
[1:08:30] what to do but she knows I'm gonna let
[1:08:33] him rest there you know what the
[1:08:37] prophets chamber is it's called the
[1:08:39] Upper Room because it was a room that
[1:08:43] was raised up are you with me
[1:08:46] it's placing that right there and saying
[1:08:49] god I don't know how this situation is
[1:08:51] going to come out but I'm gonna place it
[1:08:54] in your hands Lord I'm gonna place it in
[1:08:58] the bed of your presence you with me
[1:09:04] rod already told in the Book of
[1:09:06] Revelations that I'm gonna cast all
[1:09:09] their children in her bed the bed of
[1:09:12] that unclean woman is all right she's
[1:09:15] got a bed but God has a bed God has a
[1:09:19] place of rest a place where you and I
[1:09:24] rest and that arrest is in him is that
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:32] others were tortured not accepting
[1:09:35] deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:09:37] better resurrection they were living
[1:09:41] beyond what this life could offer them
[1:09:48] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:09:50] scourgings yeah moreover of bonds and
[1:09:52] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:09:54] sawn asunder were tempted were slain
[1:09:56] with the sword they wandered about in
[1:09:58] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[1:10:00] afflicted and tormented if I asked right
[1:10:07] now how many want to be destitute
[1:10:09] afflicted or tormented you say want to
[1:10:12] be been there i RM there but you see it
[1:10:18] wasn't something of a comfortable walk
[1:10:24] it wasn't a comfortable life it wasn't
[1:10:28] where everything is just coming the way
[1:10:30] that we want it you know brother-sister
[1:10:33] we're we're honest we don't want
[1:10:35] suffering we don't want suffering
[1:10:40] sometimes I even wonder when we're
[1:10:42] asking God for healing are we asking him
[1:10:45] for healing because we don't want
[1:10:46] suffering come on friends I'm talking
[1:10:54] about the humanity we all desire when
[1:11:00] we're sick and we're buying our body we
[1:11:01] want to be healed I don't look forward
[1:11:04] to going to the doctor do you I don't
[1:11:07] look forward if there has to be surgery
[1:11:09] or I don't look forward to that but even
[1:11:12] in our prayers what we recognize is we
[1:11:14] are submitting our hearts and our lives
[1:11:16] to the Lord
[1:11:17] recognize that god when our hearts are
[1:11:20] in tune with him God will have his way
[1:11:24] the Lord let all my motives be aligned
[1:11:28] with what your desire is Lord of whom
[1:11:34] the world was not worthy they wandered
[1:11:40] in deserts and in mountains and in dens
[1:11:41] and caves of the earth all these all
[1:11:44] having obtained a good report through
[1:11:47] faith received not the promise God
[1:11:50] having provided some better thing for us
[1:11:52] that they without us should not be made
[1:11:54] perfect one thing that we see that
[1:11:57] within their lives
[1:11:59] it was cries moving in their lives
[1:12:04] he was the keystone of their life he
[1:12:09] it's him that when you look in each of
[1:12:12] their lives of how that there were God
[1:12:14] calling them God dealing with them and
[1:12:17] then bringing them to that we can say it
[1:12:19] like this the very apex of their walk
[1:12:21] with God to where God Himself was had
[1:12:26] such a preeminence within their lives
[1:12:29] that when we look back either even
[1:12:32] through the scriptures to think of how
[1:12:33] think of how that the Prophet tells us
[1:12:36] in Christ as the mystery he says when we
[1:12:38] back through the word we see that he was
[1:12:41] in the profits he was in the Psalms he
[1:12:43] was he was in everything it was Christ
[1:12:47] in it all in each of their lives of
[1:12:52] Christ and David Christ in Moses it was
[1:12:54] that Keystone it was all of Christ
[1:12:57] Himself assembling together
[1:12:59] the stones of the arc of triumph
[1:13:04] gathering it all together oh my look at
[1:13:11] how in the scriptures it in this
[1:13:12] assembling of the of the stones think
[1:13:15] about it you know in the mass of of
[1:13:17] humanity
[1:13:18] the mass of that that was here even upon
[1:13:22] the earth and is here upon the earth but
[1:13:25] yet God he knows where each and every
[1:13:29] one of his children are God knows and
[1:13:33] it's God that does the assembling
[1:13:36] together sometimes in you know you can
[1:13:41] look at a person but you don't know God
[1:13:44] is able to look beyond what you are I
[1:13:46] see because remember the stone is not
[1:13:50] the outside of appearance Jesus told the
[1:13:54] Pharisees that their judgment was not a
[1:13:57] righteous judgment it was judgment based
[1:14:00] solely upon what they could see there
[1:14:04] under their knowledge their
[1:14:05] understanding but how that God here is
[1:14:09] the Prophet when he reads those portions
[1:14:11] of Scripture that I read in Hebrews 11
[1:14:14] the Prophet takes out of the message
[1:14:16] perfect strength and perfect weakness he
[1:14:18] said when we stand there on that day we
[1:14:21] will stand in the presence of many
[1:14:24] people that have been weak yet when we
[1:14:33] look at their lives what we see is the
[1:14:36] greatness of Christ how did God and in
[1:14:42] the scriptures where it says in Hebrews
[1:14:44] 1 that God who in sundry times and in
[1:14:46] divers manners spake in times past unto
[1:14:49] the father's by the prophets
[1:14:52] it was God through the prophets
[1:14:55] assembling these stones oh and look at
[1:15:01] this huh
[1:15:02] the prophets having the word of the Lord
[1:15:06] God revealing himself to his prophets
[1:15:10] look at how that even God would bring
[1:15:13] this out even in the book of Hosea now I
[1:15:16] love how it's how its alluded to here in
[1:15:19] the scriptures of how that God said in
[1:15:21] verse 5 of house Isaiah 6 therefore have
[1:15:24] I hid them by the prophets I have slain
[1:15:28] them by the words of my mouth and that
[1:15:30] judgments are as the light that goeth
[1:15:32] forth to think of how that the people
[1:15:37] just you know it's like one big
[1:15:39] conglomeration even upon this earth
[1:15:42] friends there's only one thing that
[1:15:45] could bring a separation and bring God's
[1:15:48] people unto himself and that would be
[1:15:51] him and he is the word a man who's not
[1:15:55] assembling to a church but he assembles
[1:15:58] unto himself and then worth as it goes
[1:16:02] out is the you know the Prophet would
[1:16:04] pick this up and recognising your day in
[1:16:06] its message and he says of how that that
[1:16:08] word going out that God he said it agree
[1:16:10] said let's use a different word instead
[1:16:12] of hewed let's use the word chopped out
[1:16:15] it was God chopping out his people when
[1:16:19] you chop something out it isn't
[1:16:21] necessarily something that is easy but
[1:16:25] God by his word he used his people out
[1:16:28] he separates you from Woodrum the
[1:16:31] generation and the rest of the world and
[1:16:34] the people that you're walking with it's
[1:16:36] his word that brings a separation if it
[1:16:40] was not for his word going forth listen
[1:16:42] it is not us that we would figure it out
[1:16:44] it must be God himself move on our
[1:16:47] hearts on our lives
[1:16:49] or we would be just like the rest the
[1:16:53] Prophet tells us that Noah before God
[1:16:56] ever spoke to Noah that Noah's seen the
[1:16:59] conditions of the day he was praying
[1:17:02] about the conditions of the day he said
[1:17:04] Noah was praying with
[1:17:05] his family about the conditions of the
[1:17:07] day you know what is causing NOAA to do
[1:17:10] that because he was of God and the
[1:17:13] presence of God was ready to give a
[1:17:16] message and Noah was tied to that
[1:17:19] message that's why the Prophet said that
[1:17:21] when God gets ready to send a where
[1:17:24] there's a people on earth that are
[1:17:26] desiring to line up with truth yes
[1:17:32] there's just like what we see in the
[1:17:35] coming months
[1:17:36] they're big geese that me even there'll
[1:17:38] be all sorts of life that is going to do
[1:17:40] what make its annual migration who tells
[1:17:46] them to go migrate is it a scientific
[1:17:51] book is it something good on and all of
[1:17:56] a sudden on the billboard
[1:17:58] it's a instinct given by God they know
[1:18:06] it's time and they move they start
[1:18:11] uniting together they start getting
[1:18:13] together what's telling them it's
[1:18:16] something bad that's breaking forward
[1:18:18] with the conditions and nature and God
[1:18:21] that's put it in them that they're able
[1:18:23] to pick up the change and because
[1:18:27] they're able to pick it up they start
[1:18:29] uniting together I believe with all my
[1:18:31] heart that just as God would let that be
[1:18:33] a testimony in the nature and animal
[1:18:36] life I believe that there is a greater
[1:18:38] witness inside of the elect of Almighty
[1:18:41] God that it resonates in our heart there
[1:18:44] is a change that's coming it resonated
[1:18:46] in Moses in Noah's life there's a change
[1:18:49] that's coming and what did it invited
[1:18:53] the presence of God to reveal to know
[1:18:56] what was needed to save him in his
[1:18:58] household glory be to God hallelujah he
[1:19:06] rallied Noah you know how the Bible says
[1:19:13] in the book of Timothy it says
[1:19:17] in a great house there's many different
[1:19:19] types of vessels wooden silver gold and
[1:19:23] it says whosoever will purge himself of
[1:19:27] these shall be a vessel that's meat
[1:19:32] sanctified unto the Masters use and unto
[1:19:35] every good work how can we purge
[1:19:39] ourselves
[1:19:40] there must be strength there must be a
[1:19:43] cleansing source that is able to move
[1:19:46] our lives where we walk and surrender to
[1:19:50] Him and begin to apply that in our life
[1:19:53] what is it it's him calling us into his
[1:19:56] service
[1:19:57] it's him calling us into position
[1:20:01] God is chopping his people out a word
[1:20:04] that's bringing separation it wasn't
[1:20:07] easy for Abraham to leave where he was
[1:20:09] at I'll tell your friends listen serving
[1:20:11] God inconvenient I hope that don't
[1:20:16] stumble you but it ain't convenient
[1:20:19] anyone meant to be easy anything about
[1:20:23] what's easy that ain't Christianity when
[1:20:26] you've been born in the Spirit of God
[1:20:28] it's easy to live for him but there's
[1:20:30] all kinds of obstacles there's all kinds
[1:20:33] of hindrances there's tests there's
[1:20:35] trials there's everything that is placed
[1:20:37] away why would that be bet him he might
[1:20:42] declare himself as the great Keystone in
[1:20:45] your life God allows test he allows
[1:20:50] trials he permits all those things to
[1:20:52] come about that he might display himself
[1:20:56] to you personally because I can't go in
[1:20:59] on your testimony and you can't go in on
[1:21:00] mine you got to have your own testimony
[1:21:03] you have to have your own walk with God
[1:21:05] you can you need your experiences
[1:21:07] experiences are important in your walk
[1:21:10] with God it's God making known to you of
[1:21:12] the real faith that's been sewn on the
[1:21:15] inside that there is an acre that's
[1:21:18] there sometimes you feel like you're
[1:21:20] ready to break and and give over but
[1:21:23] there is an acre on the inside
[1:21:25] no wonder Peter could say the trying
[1:21:28] of your faith is more precious than gold
[1:21:32] why it shows that it's not a faith
[1:21:36] that's here it's a faith that's here
[1:21:39] something that holds you and you can't
[1:21:41] explain when you don't have a verbal
[1:21:43] explanation but the answer is as I'm
[1:21:47] gonna look to him the Hebrew children
[1:21:50] when they were standing there
[1:21:52] they told him and said we don't have an
[1:21:54] answer as far as a direct answer that
[1:21:57] God's gonna come and deliver us but we
[1:21:59] do know this one thing that we're not
[1:22:02] going to bow down amen you may not know
[1:22:08] and have everything laid out before you
[1:22:10] but you can say this I am NOT bowing
[1:22:12] down God was silent he wanted to hear
[1:22:18] them testify you know they couldn't even
[1:22:26] raise their hands at that time they were
[1:22:28] bound but though their hands were bound
[1:22:31] their souls had been liberated how
[1:22:35] because their soul had been liberated
[1:22:37] the trial could only liberate their
[1:22:40] hands growing pains of God's Amazing
[1:22:47] Grace the trying of our faith is more
[1:22:53] precious than gold what's God doing he's
[1:22:56] trying every little part that goes into
[1:22:59] that great arc of triumph he's testing
[1:23:03] it just like they did that bridge when
[1:23:05] they spanned that bridge across
[1:23:06] Australia when there was a man that said
[1:23:08] it can't be done many others but there
[1:23:10] was a man that says I can do it
[1:23:12] but what he did he went down to the rock
[1:23:16] until I had to have this bridge has got
[1:23:20] to get set on the rock you know when he
[1:23:21] went to he went to something that was
[1:23:24] below that of the surface of even what
[1:23:26] they could see he went down
[1:23:28] the rock and a fix those post on the
[1:23:32] rock then he began to test every boat
[1:23:36] all of those beans
[1:23:39] why is he testing them because he's got
[1:23:42] to make sure cuz that bridge is gonna
[1:23:43] bear his name hallelujah and the testing
[1:23:50] of our faith here is it's trying its
[1:23:52] testing it's not God looking to see are
[1:23:54] they gonna hold on or they're gonna
[1:23:56] remain steadfast God knows God allows
[1:24:00] all of those things to move upon our
[1:24:03] lives to what his glory might be shown
[1:24:11] chopping chopping out the people queuing
[1:24:14] them out by his word think of how that
[1:24:18] the Lord Jesus here he is he's standing
[1:24:19] here and I'm just referring to many of
[1:24:23] these places here that that you know of
[1:24:25] but all through the Scriptures and the
[1:24:28] Lord Jesus refers the Pharisees the
[1:24:30] people the religious people in that day
[1:24:32] he refers them back to what was spoken
[1:24:36] is now happening when he says in Matthew
[1:24:39] 21 42 did you never read in the
[1:24:43] scriptures the stone which the builders
[1:24:44] rejected the same is become the head of
[1:24:47] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[1:24:50] it is marvelous in our eyes they had
[1:24:57] went along and remember even how that
[1:24:59] the Lord Jesus is referring back they
[1:25:01] had went along and building they looked
[1:25:04] at this stone and it was odd looking it
[1:25:06] was different looking but they didn't
[1:25:09] realize they didn't they didn't catch
[1:25:10] that this stone is very important this
[1:25:15] stone is not an optional stone it is
[1:25:17] important it's what brings the rest of
[1:25:21] the building together it's what gives
[1:25:24] meaning to the building it's a
[1:25:27] cornerstone you risk me hey man it's
[1:25:31] that's why when the scriptures were Paul
[1:25:33] could say I haven't laid the foundation
[1:25:35] where there no man can lay in that's
[1:25:36] Christ Jesus there's got to be a
[1:25:39] foundation that is laid
[1:25:42] it's gotta be a cornerstone in look
[1:25:44] friends and everyone of our life has got
[1:25:46] to be the cornerstone it's gotta be
[1:25:49] Christ amen
[1:25:51] by the new birth placing himself his
[1:25:55] life in us and then from that foundation
[1:25:59] grow up into him who is the head of all
[1:26:01] things is that right amen
[1:26:05] we don't grab overnight we grow we
[1:26:08] mature in his presence but that
[1:26:11] cornerstone must be laid in our life in
[1:26:14] every part all things in our life in our
[1:26:17] marriages in our homes in all things the
[1:26:20] cornerstone must be present amen he's
[1:26:25] the foundation stone amen so when we
[1:26:29] look at how that in the midst of it you
[1:26:31] know they were looking for him to come
[1:26:34] but the thing that they were not
[1:26:38] understanding is all of a sudden here
[1:26:40] comes a man on the scene by the name of
[1:26:43] John John begins to preach a message of
[1:26:48] repentance they don't know who John is
[1:26:52] they recognize there's something
[1:26:55] different about this man but they don't
[1:26:58] catch the significance and they don't
[1:27:01] know who he is
[1:27:01] so they ask him who are you now they
[1:27:05] weren't asking him as far as what's your
[1:27:07] name who they want to know who are you
[1:27:12] identify yourself by what by the word
[1:27:17] who are you that's why and then people
[1:27:23] don't want to know when they say who are
[1:27:24] you what church you go to what they're
[1:27:27] trying to figure out and you pray that
[1:27:29] it's a life that they see within you
[1:27:32] it's not another cause of a church that
[1:27:35] you belong to it's because when you have
[1:27:38] been baptized into Christ your life is
[1:27:41] different there's a change in your life
[1:27:44] it's a separated walk with God that
[1:27:47] causes others to be thirsty what is it
[1:27:53] about you what's what's different about
[1:27:54] you where do you go to church
[1:27:56] what do you all believe it listen and I
[1:27:59] hope this doesn't mean it isn't what I
[1:28:00] believe as far as doctrines the Spirit
[1:28:06] of Truth leads me to the true doctrine
[1:28:09] are you with me
[1:28:11] it bashed me into the truth because the
[1:28:13] doctrine is the bots on my tree are you
[1:28:17] is me the truth itself drawing that life
[1:28:21] that's down there that's hidden beneath
[1:28:23] draws that up here into the branches
[1:28:25] branches of righteousness branches of
[1:28:28] holiness you can know a lot of doctrine
[1:28:34] and it's all it is here it's a doctrine
[1:28:38] it's to know him are you with me
[1:28:42] it's a know him that's life I tell your
[1:28:46] friends doctrine just alone in itself is
[1:28:48] dangerous
[1:28:51] who brother salmon where you going
[1:28:53] Genesis chapter 6 the Bible said
[1:28:56] knowledge was increasing in the earth
[1:28:58] and the Bible said wickedness increased
[1:29:01] when it's just knowledge men will rely
[1:29:05] on their knowledge instead of a heart
[1:29:07] that beats for God we don't rely on our
[1:29:11] knowledge sure we want God to reveal we
[1:29:15] want to dwell in that holy knowledge is
[1:29:17] given by Almighty God but we want to
[1:29:20] walk with a heart and a life that beats
[1:29:22] out holiness unto the Lord amen I'll
[1:29:28] just I know this and I know that and I
[1:29:30] know this and I know that then they did
[1:29:33] that in the sardian age they heard the
[1:29:34] word that Luther was preaching but they
[1:29:36] heard it in a manner so that they might
[1:29:39] be able to dispute and argue but there
[1:29:44] were some who heard it for practical
[1:29:47] outworking they wanted that word to
[1:29:51] energize their lives they wanted him to
[1:29:56] become the be the very theme and be the
[1:29:59] very source of life pulsating through
[1:30:01] their lives amen
[1:30:05] look at how that God is making this
[1:30:08] known
[1:30:10] here in the ministry in Matthew 11 Jesus
[1:30:14] you know he's after John's disciples
[1:30:16] have departed it begins to ask them what
[1:30:19] what did you go out to see a reed that's
[1:30:23] shaken with the wind one that's closed
[1:30:25] in soft raiment but he says in verse
[1:30:28] nine of Matthew 11 yea I say unto you
[1:30:31] more than a prophet John was a prophet
[1:30:36] but yet he was more than a prophet he
[1:30:39] was speaking of the hour that had
[1:30:42] arrived where all the other prophets had
[1:30:45] testified of this hour that was coming
[1:30:48] it was Christ in them testifying of his
[1:30:51] own Advent glory be to God amen it's
[1:30:56] Christ moving within them and here more
[1:31:00] than a prophet and it goes on to say for
[1:31:02] this is he of whom it is written behold
[1:31:03] I send my messenger before thy face
[1:31:06] which shall prepare thy way before thee
[1:31:09] John had already testified to this and
[1:31:13] the world on the scene is also
[1:31:16] testifying for what John has said they
[1:31:22] matter so what what we find is a union
[1:31:25] we find this in the message and the
[1:31:28] Ministry of John where Christ Himself
[1:31:31] bring you even a further testimony this
[1:31:35] is the one that was spoken of it goes on
[1:31:39] to say among them that are born of women
[1:31:41] there have not risen a greater than John
[1:31:44] the Baptist
[1:31:45] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:31:47] kingdom of heaven is greater than he
[1:31:50] there's not rose a greater one than John
[1:31:53] yet you have a Moses think of this there
[1:31:58] were signs and wonders miracles done in
[1:32:01] Moses ministry is that right that yet
[1:32:06] John's position puts it to be greater
[1:32:11] and the Scriptures tell us he did no
[1:32:14] miracles
[1:32:20] what was it that was greater it was the
[1:32:26] position of the hour had arrived for
[1:32:31] redemption there were some in that age
[1:32:40] who were sufficiently impressed with the
[1:32:42] word that Ministry of John it caught
[1:32:47] them there they walk into being baptized
[1:32:52] unto repentance what is that the word
[1:32:54] was calling them into a place of
[1:32:57] surrendered and positioned as vessels
[1:32:59] ready for God's own life to move in them
[1:33:05] that's what the call of the message it
[1:33:09] calls you it called me into what into a
[1:33:13] place to be used of God it calls you and
[1:33:20] I there is a blood that sanctifies us
[1:33:23] that the very purpose of God might move
[1:33:27] in our lives that's why it's just a call
[1:33:31] to the message is not enough I hope you
[1:33:34] with me now just to sanctifies not
[1:33:36] enough it's got to be united with him to
[1:33:42] where the scripture said Christ who is
[1:33:44] our life
[1:33:48] notice how this greater he's to
[1:33:50] introduce the Messiah look at how that
[1:33:53] when we see that John the Baptist the
[1:33:55] Prophet would put it like this and just
[1:33:57] let me refer to this in in in two places
[1:34:00] but the brown refer to it like this he
[1:34:02] says why was he more than a prophet I
[1:34:05] don't think I have it in there
[1:34:06] why is he more than it was it was he
[1:34:08] more than a prophet he was a messenger
[1:34:10] of the Covenant that bridged the way
[1:34:13] between law and grace he was the
[1:34:15] Keystone in there that had been spoke up
[1:34:21] so John was the Keystone because he had
[1:34:24] a keystone message
[1:34:26] the Keystone message is that right what
[1:34:31] was the Keystone message to introduce
[1:34:33] the Keystone are you with me it couldn't
[1:34:37] be John standing there come on friends
[1:34:40] couldn't be John but it was cries but
[1:34:43] John's ministry was needful because it
[1:34:47] was the ministry where the Keystone
[1:34:49] revelation would come through them to
[1:34:53] introduce what the Messiah the Keystone
[1:34:57] here is John's ministry here as as John
[1:35:01] goes forth then we find that here in the
[1:35:03] ministry of of of john where john calls
[1:35:06] out behold the lamb of God which taketh
[1:35:08] away the sin of the world this is he of
[1:35:10] whom I said after me cometh a man which
[1:35:13] is preferred before me for he was before
[1:35:15] me John's ministry was announcing the
[1:35:20] Keystone the Lamb of God which taketh
[1:35:23] away the sin of the world one who is the
[1:35:27] answer to sin question one who is the
[1:35:32] answer where all of them who died in
[1:35:35] good faith they were looking and they
[1:35:38] were walking by the Lamb walking by that
[1:35:42] offering uh think of this many of the
[1:35:45] Old Testament Saints many of them
[1:35:47] offered lambs are you with me the many
[1:35:55] of them offered the lamb many of them
[1:35:57] offered the sacrifice what separated
[1:35:59] them why was it that not all when all
[1:36:02] were offering up the land why was it not
[1:36:04] all because not all offered it in the
[1:36:07] gate where he chose to place his name
[1:36:11] God said after his habitation you shall
[1:36:14] seek after where God has chosen to place
[1:36:17] his name but not all seeing the
[1:36:20] significance of that many czars just the
[1:36:23] lamb all I have to do is offer the lamb
[1:36:25] it wasn't that they said that per se but
[1:36:28] that's how they lived but there were
[1:36:30] others that the that the pulsation of
[1:36:33] the lamb the prophecy was taken hold on
[1:36:36] their lives
[1:36:37] to where that actions were coming out of
[1:36:40] their life that they didn't know what
[1:36:42] was going on but God was prophesying
[1:36:44] through their actions
[1:36:45] where was it stones that are part of the
[1:36:48] arc of triumph then you find here that
[1:36:52] the Lord Jesus walking in his earthly
[1:36:54] ministry we know he's taken in judgment
[1:36:58] he submitted himself into the hands he
[1:37:03] didn't fight against it he he was a lamb
[1:37:05] the Bible said lamb a lamb that was led
[1:37:07] as dumb before her shears
[1:37:09] led to the slaughter he wasn't deceived
[1:37:13] to the slaughter he was led he wasn't
[1:37:16] pulled he was led willingly he went but
[1:37:25] this was not on a deception like what
[1:37:27] took place in the garden this was
[1:37:28] willingness brew obediently and it goes
[1:37:34] to count Calvary here shed the blood out
[1:37:42] of his body goes the water and the blood
[1:37:47] those very elements that he is going to
[1:37:50] take to make up his bride his body
[1:37:53] gather the rest of his stones that are
[1:37:57] part of the arc of triumph that come
[1:38:01] down through the Gentile ages assembling
[1:38:04] stones together the Bible says when he
[1:38:10] yielded up the gold
[1:38:17] that's powerful yielded his whole time
[1:38:23] was yielding in the very closing moment
[1:38:28] upon his earthly journey with a beauty
[1:38:37] the scriptures say if I may read that
[1:38:41] and Isaiah 53 you made his soul an
[1:38:46] offering for sin I know we've been
[1:38:50] through this months ago but he went for
[1:38:54] the lowest hell bearing our sins he had
[1:39:01] to he was he was the answer and then
[1:39:08] after however met him however long that
[1:39:12] he's there he begins to ascend up sin
[1:39:20] had no power on his life he begins to
[1:39:26] send up after his unloaded the sin of
[1:39:30] the world
[1:39:34] leaves it down there inhale on him who
[1:39:38] brought it in the first place he's not
[1:39:43] coming back laden with sin he is
[1:39:47] relieved of that how did he get relief
[1:39:51] he walked in obedience to the word of
[1:39:53] what the word required for him that's
[1:39:56] how sin is lifted from a life walking
[1:39:59] obedience to what God is asking his sins
[1:40:04] and here there's some that are held
[1:40:07] captive he knocks on the door and when
[1:40:13] he comes to that door each one of them
[1:40:16] as they recognized him in their
[1:40:18] generation they recognize him as he
[1:40:23] stands right there the same how did they
[1:40:28] recognize him because he is the same
[1:40:32] yesterday today and forever he's known
[1:40:36] by his characteristics you with me he's
[1:40:43] known by his characteristics of who he
[1:40:46] is
[1:40:49] Ezequiel that's that will in the middle
[1:40:51] of the wheel they're all excited what
[1:40:54] were they excited about he's that stoned
[1:40:56] and they say he's the one I saw hewn out
[1:40:58] of him out without ass what were they
[1:41:00] excited about they saw what the message
[1:41:03] and their day had called them to they
[1:41:05] were seeing him who is the fulfillment
[1:41:08] of it and the fulfillment of that was
[1:41:12] bringing deliverance to them they had
[1:41:15] already walked free of the world now
[1:41:20] came a Liberty that will loosen them
[1:41:24] from the very hold where they were in
[1:41:27] paradise and when there was a hold that
[1:41:29] says you can't ascend into the presence
[1:41:32] of God because the payment has not been
[1:41:35] made but Jesus said my blood has been
[1:41:42] shed for them I hope you understand he
[1:41:46] came there to paradise he let's say to
[1:41:50] know that my blood is still hot on the
[1:41:53] ground I've paid for their sin I
[1:41:57] overcame he's standing there in
[1:42:01] authority in the midst of darkness in
[1:42:04] the midst of hell he's standing with
[1:42:06] authority and Satan can't do nothing
[1:42:10] about it
[1:42:13] why because it was a life that was lived
[1:42:17] in obedience to the Word of God a life
[1:42:20] that was surrender he was the supreme
[1:42:22] sacrifice that would call the rest of
[1:42:25] the lambs that are in the Lamb's Book of
[1:42:27] Life
[1:42:31] were the graves they were held the Bible
[1:42:37] didn't say they were dead it said they
[1:42:38] slept they slept they were waiting but
[1:42:44] when he arose then they arose with him
[1:42:50] he died but then he rose they came out
[1:42:55] of the graves with him
[1:42:58] and as the opening scripture we read
[1:43:00] they appeared unto many here it was the
[1:43:06] first rapture of the New Testament how
[1:43:10] did that rapture happen there had to be
[1:43:12] a death first
[1:43:14] then there comes forth life out of death
[1:43:18] and here he stands as the keystone to it
[1:43:22] all the Bible said that he that ascended
[1:43:29] but that he first decent and he led
[1:43:33] captivity captive and he gave gifts unto
[1:43:38] men what was he doing
[1:43:41] he was giving of his life giving
[1:43:44] witnesses of his life you recognize the
[1:43:47] scripture said that here in the Book of
[1:43:49] Isaiah it says therefore we'll add
[1:43:51] divided verse 12 I will divide him a
[1:43:54] portion with the great who's the great
[1:43:57] God there is no one greater and he shall
[1:44:03] divide the spoil with the strong who
[1:44:07] that's wrong
[1:44:08] the children because he had poured out
[1:44:12] his soul unto death and he was numbered
[1:44:13] with the transgressors and he bare the
[1:44:15] sin of many and made intercession for
[1:44:17] the transgressors he divided the spoil
[1:44:21] what's the spoil the life that you were
[1:44:26] intended to have he made a way through
[1:44:33] the purchase that you and I could come
[1:44:35] back to our inheritance what did Jesus
[1:44:43] do his death his burial death and his
[1:44:46] resurrection brings me to my inheritance
[1:44:50] that was left me and through his life he
[1:44:57] has he rose from the grave where you had
[1:45:00] all of those Old Testament Saints who
[1:45:04] were worshipping under the blood of the
[1:45:05] Lamb those that had worshiped in Shiloh
[1:45:08] those that have worship therein
[1:45:11] Jerusalem those that had worshipped in
[1:45:13] those places given by God here they are
[1:45:16] they're a symbol and now the Keystone
[1:45:20] rises into its position and they walk
[1:45:25] out after him as he walks through the
[1:45:32] prophecy of the Scriptures it is the
[1:45:38] fulfillment of the word is that right
[1:45:42] Jesus never went to the grave and and
[1:45:46] and hollered for them to come out the
[1:45:50] prophecy being fulfilled in his life
[1:45:52] emanated a voice that's why and our
[1:45:58] lives is not just saying here our lives
[1:46:01] are to speak speak it was him coming up
[1:46:07] out of the great was spoken that word
[1:46:09] that voice went forth and the rest they
[1:46:11] rose with him here's the Keystone the
[1:46:15] Scriptures I love how it says in the
[1:46:16] scripture I'm closing it says in
[1:46:20] Colossians 2 verse 13 and you being dead
[1:46:22] in your sins in the uncircumcision of
[1:46:24] your flesh have to be quickened together
[1:46:26] with him having forgiven you all
[1:46:28] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[1:46:32] of Ordinances that was against us which
[1:46:34] was contrary to us and took it out of
[1:46:36] the way nailing it to the cross and
[1:46:38] having spoiled principalities and powers
[1:46:40] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:46:44] over them in it he arose the mammal of I
[1:46:53] says if brother Ram says they had
[1:46:55] glorified body they appeared back on
[1:46:58] earth for firstfruits of the proof of
[1:47:00] God's power and the resurrection there
[1:47:03] they was robbed and stripped
[1:47:05] principalities and took death and hell
[1:47:08] smothered it up and rolls up on Easter
[1:47:11] morning and entered into the kingdom
[1:47:12] with him they rose and here they were
[1:47:19] walking for forty day
[1:47:22] upon this earth and Satan couldn't do
[1:47:28] one thing about not one thing about it
[1:47:35] he it was a witnessing of prophecy that
[1:47:40] had come to pass they walk testifying of
[1:47:47] his victory forty days and the Lord
[1:47:51] Jesus has been looking at speaking to
[1:47:53] the disciples forty days showing
[1:47:55] infallible proof and giving them
[1:47:57] instruction and you know what
[1:48:03] that's a type of the Holy Ghost in you
[1:48:05] and in me when that seal has been put
[1:48:09] upon the soul Satan can't touch he can
[1:48:16] afflict your body he can try to flicked
[1:48:18] you in your spirit but he can't touch
[1:48:21] that soul because the soul is sealed
[1:48:23] unto the day of redemption
[1:48:25] what's it sealed by the gospel of your
[1:48:28] salvation what is the gospel of your
[1:48:30] salvation the one in the hour what is
[1:48:32] the one in the hour that which is
[1:48:34] prophesied but it's now fulfilled in you
[1:48:37] and you who are once dead in sin and
[1:48:42] trespasses house hearing and here you
[1:48:48] now walk in a newness of life well at
[1:48:54] one time in your life you were searching
[1:48:57] but then Christ begins to make himself
[1:49:01] known to you
[1:49:02] I'm the Keystone I am the piece that
[1:49:07] brings the picture together
[1:49:09] I am the necessary part of your life
[1:49:13] that brings all I am that life piece I
[1:49:19] am that masterpiece I am that Keystone
[1:49:23] that were all things in your life when
[1:49:27] you're walking through the rector all of
[1:49:29] the parts of that arc of triumph as I
[1:49:31] read to you before they have all of
[1:49:33] these battles that are law all these
[1:49:35] great battles that's been
[1:49:36] through time and I say to you by the
[1:49:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul

[1:50:19] part for fulfillment in Jenna's life
[1:50:23] Gideon's life what Gideon could not see
[1:50:26] he couldn't see what God was seeing in
[1:50:28] his life but what do I say

[1:57:01] themselves
[1:57:04] Lord surrendering all things the Lord in
[1:57:08] their life you would be the Keystone all
[1:57:15] of the prophets those who live down
[1:57:17] through the time Lord they they were
[1:57:19] moved by you
[1:57:20] they sought after they were looking as
[1:57:25] pilgrims and strangers they sought a
[1:57:28] better country they were not mindful of
[1:57:32] that country they came out of the Lord
[1:57:36] you you caused them to seek there was a
[1:57:40] longing in them for that other country
[1:57:44] from which they had been touched
[1:57:48] Lord Jesus just as you moved to assemble
[1:57:51] those stones to Lord that moves upon
[1:57:54] lives and once you move in our life for
[1:57:57] God to draw us into yourself which you
[1:57:59] that moves Lord sanctify it's you that

[1:59:00] you're that part Lord God in our lives
[1:59:04] to think of it Lord without the Keystone
[1:59:06] here in this church but it's like your
[1:59:10] prophet said it is nothing but a
[1:59:12] bejeweled corpse without the leading of
[1:59:16] the Holy Ghost
[1:59:17] without the Keystone Oh God
[1:59:21] same in any life Lord any heart Lord we
[1:59:26] we recognize the Lord that is you showed
[1:59:28] us here in your word you're you're very

[1:59:37] pick it up in the midst of talking about
[1:59:41] a fervent man
[1:59:46] at the prayer the fervent prayer of a
[1:59:48] righteous man availeth lunch a righteous
[1:59:51] man and with him that passage law he
[1:59:56] would make known that Elijah was a man
[2:00:00] subject to like passions such as well
[2:00:03] that wasn't taking away Lord the Lord
[2:00:07] shows that in all of that you you allow
[2:00:11] the humanity to be shown their Lord

[2:02:13] in the name of Jesus Christ you love him
[2:02:23] are you witnesses at Keystone
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] Keystone
[2:02:32] many times of the Prophet went through
[2:02:35] so many different situations he talked
[2:02:37] about in his own ministry lives
[2:02:44] situations where God took what was
[2:02:47] seemed like it was destined in a certain
[2:02:50] way but yet the Lord Jesus came on the
[2:02:57] scene
[2:02:58] the Keystone you know you think about
[2:03:05] all of them all of the prophets those
[2:03:09] who were worshipping under the lamb
[2:03:13] they were praying for what God had
[2:03:18] revealed to them they were praying for
[2:03:21] that that's what their life was about if
[2:03:26] we could say like this when they sit
[2:03:27] down for breakfast and dinner and
[2:03:29] different that's what their life was
[2:03:30] about that's how they made their
[2:03:32] decisions in their life it was about
[2:03:34] what God had revealed to them they
[2:03:37] prayed for what God revealed that it
[2:03:39] would become real in their lives
[2:03:46] that's the same thing to see that what
[2:03:49] God makes known in the things that the
[2:03:51] Lord has spoken when we seek after it
[2:03:56] when we give ourselves and say Lord feel
[2:04:00] that place there's a place that is voice
[2:04:03] and Lord feel that place more fill that
[2:04:08] area if there's a door that he hasn't
[2:04:10] went into yet wouldn't you let him in
[2:04:12] that let him move into that area let him
[2:04:17] make himself known and what you thought
[2:04:21] to be impossible but let me let him make
[2:04:24] himself known that I am the mighty
[2:04:26] Conqueror that I am over at all
[2:04:31] [Music]

[2:18:05] yes
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:34] bless you all this morning it's a
[2:18:38] privilege that Ethan here has made a
[2:18:44] stand for the Lord and he's asked the
[2:18:47] Lord to come into his heart he's
[2:18:51] repented of his sins and it's so a
[2:18:54] wonderful thing as a as a parent you
[2:18:58] know it's you know as a parent you have
[2:19:03] you know you like your kids to do
[2:19:05] certain things right usually it's the
[2:19:07] stuff you like to do so you know that's
[2:19:11] all right that's all just kind of a
[2:19:12] parents love but I think what goes
[2:19:14] beyond that you know is your desire to
[2:19:17] see them serve the Lord and it goes
[2:19:21] beyond just your human fatherly and
[2:19:23] motherly desires it's the it's God and
[2:19:27] in our hearts and that's our our deepest
[2:19:29] desires our children would follow follow
[2:19:31] the Lord and Ethan over the years
[2:19:34] definitely has the Lord's moved in his
[2:19:37] life and in the past couple weeks
[2:19:39] especially he's felt real like he's
[2:19:43] really made a commitment to the Lord and
[2:19:45] he'd liked to take the next step as we
[2:19:48] talked about the stones and may this be
[2:19:52] a stone in his life that he can nail
[2:19:55] that down and you know it's it's a thing
[2:20:00] just thinking the other day there was an
[2:20:01] instance came up with with him that I
[2:20:05] guess it had happened several months ago
[2:20:06] but he was still in school but there
[2:20:11] were some things that happened at school
[2:20:12] that that he didn't know what he had
[2:20:14] done was bad but yet he had done them
[2:20:16] and then when he recognized that what he
[2:20:19] had done was wrong he really you know it
[2:20:22] really touched his heart and for me just
[2:20:25] to see a real true repentance like that
[2:20:29] you know it's it really touches your
[2:20:32] heart and you can really understand that
[2:20:35] you know there may be a lot of things
[2:20:38] people do or whatever that may look big
[2:20:41] but really the repentant heart like that
[2:20:44] will move God it's just you know so we
[2:20:50] appreciate that anythin that real
[2:20:52] repentance and as we will baptize him
[2:20:55] and you know even even this morning just
[2:20:59] of course remember him in prayer going
[2:21:02] forward is even this morning he kind of
[2:21:04] the devil was kind of playing with his
[2:21:07] mind a little bit right but you know we
[2:21:11] understand that's just the enemy and you
[2:21:13] know that's what he said I promise God
[2:21:15] I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna do it so I
[2:21:19] believe you keep your promise to God and
[2:21:22] he'll keep his promise to you too to
[2:21:24] give you his Holy Spirit so that's
[2:21:25] that's our that's our desire so pray
[2:21:32] dear dear God we are we are thankful
[2:21:35] Lord as as a as a parent and as a family
[2:21:39] of believers here Oh God that that you
[2:21:43] have moved again Lord Jesus and pricked
[2:21:45] a little one's heart and Oh God that the
[2:21:48] little ones would come to you Lord and
[2:21:50] how that touched your hearts
[2:21:52] so many years ago Lord and we just
[2:21:56] just remember here the the little Ethan
[2:21:59] Lord as he takes this as moving forward
[2:22:03] in his life Lord another step towards
[2:22:05] you and we just asked that it would be a
[2:22:07] step that he would always remember and
[2:22:09] be able to look back on as the years
[2:22:11] would come and the trials and the tests
[2:22:13] and the things that he may go through
[2:22:16] school Lord and the years ahead and as
[2:22:18] teenage years would come might this be a
[2:22:20] real anchor in his heart that he can go
[2:22:23] back to and Lord and that would hold him
[2:22:25] Lord and those times that he would
[2:22:27] struggle dear God and that's our prayer
[2:22:29] for him this morning that you would be
[2:22:31] with him and fill him with your spirit
[2:22:33] might he be a witness for the O God and
[2:22:35] however you would want to use him Lord
[2:22:38] and in that we look forward to Lord and
[2:22:40] we trust and we believe and all your
[2:22:42] promises are our yay and amen and they
[2:22:44] have been done Lord and Jesus name we
[2:22:47] pray
