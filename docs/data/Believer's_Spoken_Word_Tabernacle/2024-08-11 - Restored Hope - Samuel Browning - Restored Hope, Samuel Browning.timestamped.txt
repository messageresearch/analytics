[42:24] amen amen I'm going to ask you to turn

[42:29] to uh The Book of Ruth and I want to at
[42:35] least begin there
[42:37] and many things upon my
[42:40] heart
[42:42] um we'd like to just look in some of
[42:46] these points
[42:55] and and I want to
[42:59] I want to go here
[43:01] to beginning with verse 16 and that's
[43:03] just or verse
[43:05] 15 in order to refer back and bring us
[43:08] up to where I want to actually start
[43:10] with here
[43:19] today Ruth chapter two sorry Ruth
[43:23] chapter 2
[43:27] Ru chapter 2 verse
[43:31] 15 and when she was risen up to glean
[43:34] Boaz commanded his young men saying let
[43:37] her glean even among the sheaths and
[43:40] reproach her not and let fall also some
[43:44] of the handfuls of purpose for her and
[43:47] leave them that she may glean them and
[43:50] rebuke her not so she gleaned in the
[43:53] field until even and beat out that she
[43:56] had gleaned
[43:57] and it was about an epha of barley and
[44:01] she took it up and went into the City
[44:04] and her mother-in-law saw what she had
[44:06] gleaned and she brought forth and gave
[44:09] to her that she had reserved after she
[44:13] was
[44:15] sufficed and notice in verse 19 and her
[44:18] mother-in-law said unto her where hast
[44:22] thou gleaned
[44:24] today Lord and where roughest out now
[44:27] what she's looking at is
[44:31] evidence the evidence is causing her to
[44:34] ask a question where have you been today
[44:38] it wasn't because Ruth herself looked
[44:41] different it's what she is in possession
[44:45] of that's what caused Naomi to ask this
[44:48] question and notice Blessed Be he that
[44:51] did take knowledge of thee she knows but
[44:54] this evidence someone has taken
[44:57] knowledge of you because you would not
[44:59] have come back here with this
[45:04] much see the awareness of of Naomi
[45:07] making her aware of this and she showed
[45:10] her mother-in-law with whom she had
[45:12] rought and said the man's name with whom
[45:16] I wrot today is Boaz prise the Lord and
[45:20] Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law
[45:22] Blessed Be he of the Lord who hath not
[45:25] left off his kindness to the living and
[45:29] to the dead and Naomi said unto her the
[45:33] man is near of kin unto us one of our
[45:38] next Kinsmen that is so good amen may
[45:41] God bless you and bless the reading of
[45:43] the word as you're being
[45:49] seated I want to
[45:51] just draw your attention there just for
[45:54] a moment when we look at how that God
[45:59] through Boaz and this type we know that
[46:01] Boaz himself it's a type of Christ our
[46:05] Our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer and
[46:10] when we look at that term of kinsman in
[46:12] the Scripture it is it is one who has to
[46:16] be of a near relative and there's
[46:20] qualifications that not only must they
[46:22] be of a of a near relative but they also
[46:25] must be be willing to do the work of the
[46:29] Kinsman what's needed to pay the debt to
[46:31] release what has come into under the uh
[46:35] property of somebody else they've got to
[46:38] be willing to release it and they also
[46:40] have to be willing or able financially
[46:44] to be able to do that and I'm telling
[46:46] you there's no one else that could
[46:48] release you and I from the debt of sin
[46:52] but God himself come down and become one
[46:56] of us if you look back in the scripture
[46:58] of Ruth chap 2 and verse 1 the Bible
[47:01] says and Naomi had a Kinsman of her
[47:04] husbands a mighty man of wealth of the
[47:08] family of ELC and his name was
[47:12] Boaz so notice the description of of
[47:15] Boaz that he he's a mighty man of wealth
[47:19] now I want you to notice in the
[47:21] scripture here I want to just begin to
[47:23] lay this in Naomi is not planting Ruth
[47:28] in the field Naomi was not somehow you
[47:31] know trying to bring na Ruth into a
[47:34] place to you know try to find Boaz you
[47:37] find no mention of the instruction of
[47:40] Naomi saying try to find Boaz but she
[47:44] knows Naomi has returned back to her
[47:48] Homeland she also knows that these
[47:51] fields that are to glean in are a part
[47:54] of the tribe it's connected with the
[47:56] family and here she is sending Ruth in
[47:59] to glean as Ruth would glean as other
[48:03] other uh uh those that would pour and
[48:06] would come in there but yet she received
[48:08] a special privilege to be able to glean
[48:11] with boaz's
[48:13] handmaids Boaz when he descends he
[48:17] speaks to the chief Reaper remember
[48:19] there's a chief Reaper who's over the
[48:21] rest of the Reapers God sends he has
[48:24] seven stars in his right hand is that
[48:27] right God sends a message to a
[48:29] generation it's God coming as the
[48:31] scripture said he that hath an ear let
[48:34] him hear what the scri what the spirit
[48:36] sayth to the churches that's not only
[48:38] speaking to us coming down as an
[48:40] individual but first it God speaks to
[48:44] the messenger of that age and God
[48:47] delivers a word that will actually sweep
[48:50] down and it takes a hold of the
[48:52] predestinated seed who are in that age
[48:55] and so here Boaz he comes to the Reapers
[48:58] and says who is this damsel who is she
[49:01] we we've looked at this in the scripture
[49:03] and the chief Reaper is the one that
[49:06] begins to disclose who she is this is
[49:10] this is Ruth uh uh the moitas the morit
[49:12] is that came back with Naomi and he says
[49:15] unto her when he finally comes to talk
[49:18] to her it has been fully showed to me
[49:22] all that thou Hast done leaving thy land
[49:26] of Nativity leaving the country and
[49:29] coming here to sojurn you know she had
[49:31] to make a
[49:33] decision she had a choice that was
[49:35] before her that's good is that right
[49:38] yeah now I want you to turn back in
[49:40] Roman in Ruth chapter one and I want you
[49:42] to look in Ruth chapter 1 with me here
[49:44] for just a moment and in Ruth chapter 1
[49:48] when when n when Ruth and Ora are at
[49:52] this place and they're you know they
[49:54] their their husbands had passed away
[49:56] away uh Naomi's husband had passed away
[49:59] and they hear that there's the Gathering
[50:01] of of God has blessed the country of
[50:05] Israel the Homeland with bread now
[50:07] remember when all of this has happened
[50:10] God's trying to get Naomi and trying to
[50:13] get all of them back in position think
[50:15] of this here is a Jew here's a gentile
[50:19] the same event is putting both back in
[50:22] position that's why the prophet could
[50:24] stand there in the early part of the
[50:26] message and he says the angel of the
[50:28] Lord is on Earth tonight the same one
[50:32] that's running Israel back to the
[50:33] Homeland is the same one that met me
[50:37] that night and delivered this message to
[50:39] me and is right here Among Us it's God
[50:42] getting all of these parts together
[50:45] right where they need to be but notice
[50:48] how this was mentioned here with Naomi
[50:51] and with Ruth in in verse uh8 when the
[50:55] scripture says or verse 7 let me go
[50:58] there when when she went forth out of
[51:00] the place where she was and her two
[51:02] daughters-in-law with her they went on
[51:04] the way to return unto the land of Judah
[51:07] and Naomi said unto her two
[51:09] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[51:13] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[51:16] you as you have dealt with the dead and
[51:20] with me now watch this the Lord grant
[51:23] you that you might find rest each of you
[51:26] in the house of her husband then she
[51:29] kissed them and they left lifted up
[51:32] their voice and wept now notice here
[51:35] because even of where their care at that
[51:38] point here is where Naomi could say may
[51:41] you find rest in the house of your
[51:44] husband because why you see this word
[51:47] rest here we know that there we know
[51:49] that we're coming to that place as we're
[51:51] looking in the scripture where Naomi
[51:53] will say in the beginning of Ruth
[51:55] chapter 3
[51:57] I I that I may find rest for you or a
[52:01] security for you but right back here in
[52:04] chapter one she said because of your
[52:06] kindness may you find rest in the house
[52:09] of your husband now Ruth's husband's
[52:11] dead Orphus husband's dead but remember
[52:14] they were free they were they were uh of
[52:17] even of time to even be remarried they
[52:20] had a choice to go back and marry right
[52:22] back among the systems that they were a
[52:25] part of is that right you see listen
[52:28] friends this is why that when we
[52:30] consider the message of the hour that
[52:32] we've received it's a calling to a
[52:35] higher standard and the standard that
[52:37] we're being called to is Christ in you
[52:41] the hope of glory not just a good person
[52:45] not just good works yeah listen for a
[52:48] real child of God those works are
[52:51] already packed in you when you come here
[52:54] they're in the seed but it takes the
[52:57] Holy Spirit to come upon you to begin to
[53:00] release that that's a scripture for
[53:03] ordained that we would walk in
[53:05] them but listen that's is why that you
[53:07] can look at it and you can talk to maybe
[53:10] some that are in denominations don't try
[53:12] to run them out of where they are if
[53:14] they don't have a burden to walk on with
[53:17] God leave them alone they have found
[53:19] their rest there but that's not the rest
[53:23] of the Holy
[53:24] Ghost are you with they're happy where
[53:27] they're at there'll be there'll be
[53:29] tribulation they're not going to go in
[53:31] the Rapture because to go in the Rapture
[53:33] you must come into the rest of God which
[53:36] is the Holy Ghost upon your soul that
[53:40] changes your nature and lines you with
[53:42] the word of
[53:44] God if there's attributes you can say
[53:47] well I believe the word of God if
[53:48] there's attributes coming out against
[53:51] the word of God then it hasn't went down
[53:53] to where it needs to be
[53:56] are you hearing me now you haven't found
[53:58] a place of
[53:59] rest because to find rest when he comes
[54:03] in fully to your life the desires of sin
[54:08] are
[54:09] gone it's a love for God this is where
[54:13] the Fulfillment of what God did after
[54:16] six days on the seventh day the Bible
[54:19] said God rested from all his
[54:23] labors and when the Holy Spirit has come
[54:25] into a life it's not you laboring
[54:28] against sin but there is a rest that has
[54:31] come into your life and you have ceased
[54:34] from your worldly
[54:36] Ways by the power of the holy spirit
[54:39] that separates you from the desire they
[54:42] could line everything up in from you but
[54:44] you say I have no desire for it why Who
[54:47] removed that desire God
[54:49] Amen thank you Lord that's so good no
[54:53] she said that you know that you might
[54:55] find rest there but you know there's a
[54:57] call you can't I'll tell you how blessed
[55:00] it is if you can't be just satisfied
[55:02] just in looking and saying well I thank
[55:05] God for salvation but there's there's
[55:08] deeper
[55:09] walk there's a deeper walk listen
[55:11] friends we're living in the hour of the
[55:13] sealing
[55:14] Angel we're living in the time where the
[55:17] seal is
[55:19] required the time where the Seal of the
[55:23] token is given to the Church of the
[55:25] Living God and you know what that seal
[55:27] is listen even before the seal itself
[55:30] comes upon a life when he comes Among Us
[55:34] it brings AR rest to realize first of
[55:38] all I did not bring myself to this I
[55:42] didn't bring myself here I'm not the one
[55:45] that stirred this up in my life there
[55:47] was something already there on the
[55:51] inside you see the ministring because
[55:53] listen I'm telling you who this is his
[55:57] one of the characteristics of Christ's
[55:59] own word and his name is a man of rest
[56:03] that's who Noah was Noah his name means
[56:05] a man of rest Solomon a man of
[56:09] rest I'm to bring a rest and this is why
[56:12] when the word when we can stop and just
[56:15] just listen this is why he passes among
[56:17] us the way he does and let me just tell
[56:20] you something rest doesn't mean like me
[56:22] laying down here on this
[56:24] bench that's not what rest means rest
[56:28] means me you yielding to his leading
[56:32] that is so good that's that's what it is
[56:34] it's with the rest to know he's here
[56:37] he's right Among Us he's the one that's
[56:39] leading the Church of the Living God
[56:41] he's the one that's that's moving in a
[56:43] way like I said there on Thursday night
[56:46] the winds that swept through here the
[56:48] other the I think it was Wednesday or
[56:50] Tuesday when they swept through here and
[56:52] some of you I don't know if you've seen
[56:53] the how some of those trees and things
[56:55] had' Fallen back back there but you know
[56:57] when you see it I never seen the wind
[57:00] you didn't see the wind either am but
[57:02] you saw evidence that the wind was
[57:05] moving trees were swaying leaves were
[57:08] blowing limbs were falling you were
[57:11] seeing the evidence of things being
[57:14] affected by the
[57:17] wind is that right and that's the same
[57:20] thing that as he comes Among Us he's
[57:23] identifying himself that he's the same
[57:25] yes yesterday today and forever how does
[57:28] he do that how do you and I know him we
[57:31] know him as he comes according to his
[57:34] word and reveals himself by his word and
[57:37] opens our
[57:42] understanding God I hope you understand
[57:45] this I I I think we've we've we've even
[57:47] laid upon this listen friends we
[57:49] recognize and and we need healing
[57:52] there's times where God will do Miracles
[57:54] just like this and other times the
[57:56] miracle will come later on but let me
[57:58] just tell you something around the bride
[58:00] is not the only place where there's
[58:03] healing are you hearing me this is why
[58:06] the part of it listen to me this is why
[58:08] the part of it that that many they can
[58:11] get caught in a thing and say well they
[58:13] have healings over there or or there so
[58:15] and so was healed here sure you can walk
[58:17] even maybe among other churches today
[58:19] there's testimonies I I have loved ones
[58:22] there's testimonies that they have but
[58:24] listen friends God not coming back for
[58:27] simply testimonies of healing to the
[58:30] body there's a deeper work than that and
[58:33] that's the soul that's what the Holy
[58:36] Ghost came to do it came to
[58:40] redeem thank you this body will
[58:43] eventually come under the Redemption but
[58:46] Redeemer means something that belongs to
[58:51] him this is why you battle with this
[58:53] constantly because this the way it came
[58:56] he did not come this is not what he came
[59:00] to redeem he came to redeem the
[59:04] soul and it will lead us back to a place
[59:08] to where the very atoms of our body will
[59:10] be changed we won't be coming through a
[59:13] woman come on he's not going to have to
[59:16] go to the graveyard and open up the
[59:18] graves I know we sing that song it's all
[59:21] right I don't mind the song Ain't No
[59:22] Grave going to hold my body down but it
[59:24] ain't
[59:24] scriptural I'm I mean I'll still sing it
[59:27] but it's not because you know why it
[59:29] doesn't matter where it's at it could be
[59:30] a spoonful of Ashes here or there buried
[59:32] in the sea or whatever more consumed by
[59:34] fire but God will speak and we will come
[59:39] [Applause]
[59:42] forth Hallelujah this is why the whole
[59:45] ministering of the word it brings us
[59:47] here into a place of rest and I want you
[59:50] to notice this how that even when Naomi
[59:54] comes to Ruth here and she asked her the
[59:57] question she says where have you been
[1:00:01] today where have you been
[1:00:04] hallu you know what church where you
[1:00:06] going where have you
[1:00:09] been where because she what she's
[1:00:11] looking at is the evidence right you see
[1:00:14] that's what ought to be that's what must
[1:00:16] be in our lives you know what a seal is
[1:00:19] a seal is an
[1:00:21] Evidence yes that's what the Seal of the
[1:00:24] holy spirit is when God dealing with
[1:00:26] your life that's an Evidence it's an
[1:00:28] Evidence of the holy spirit that takes a
[1:00:30] life through justification
[1:00:32] sanctification and then into the baptism
[1:00:35] of the Holy Ghost where you and I are
[1:00:38] recognized as
[1:00:41] Believers Hallelujah the seal it's an
[1:00:44] evidence that shows coming and going
[1:00:46] it's an Evidence in our life that will
[1:00:48] cause others to ask a question listen
[1:00:51] friends it's not about listen what she
[1:00:53] was looking at was the evidence right
[1:00:57] we can be ever so smart God's not coming
[1:00:59] back for scripture
[1:01:01] memorization God's not coming back to
[1:01:03] see how many quotes we can
[1:01:05] quote I believe in getting in the word
[1:01:07] that's no excuse for not being in the
[1:01:09] word because let me tell you something
[1:01:12] if there's something in you listen your
[1:01:14] flesh will always want to kick against
[1:01:16] it but I'm going to tell you if you
[1:01:17] don't have something on the inside to
[1:01:19] pull that outer man in line it's time
[1:01:22] you get what you need to pull that outer
[1:01:24] man into line there should be a love of
[1:01:27] God in your soul for the things of God
[1:01:31] it ought to be the things of God that
[1:01:33] matter more than anything of this world
[1:01:35] I'm not talking about smoking and
[1:01:37] drinking and anything else that's on
[1:01:39] very much an elementary level I'm
[1:01:41] talking about if there's anything that
[1:01:44] has a priority above the word of God and
[1:01:48] the simple things even with that it
[1:01:50] comes with the forsaking not to assemble
[1:01:52] ourselves
[1:01:53] together come on Friends when we're not
[1:01:56] making excuses and reasoning against the
[1:01:59] word of God let me tell you something
[1:02:01] don't you try to compare yourself with
[1:02:03] somebody else you compare yourself with
[1:02:06] the word that's what'll bring you rest
[1:02:09] that's what'll bring you
[1:02:11] stability because you can look at
[1:02:13] somebody else and say I should be doing
[1:02:15] this I should be doing that then you
[1:02:16] only become an impersonator you must
[1:02:20] have a direct connection with God you
[1:02:22] are an individual and God intends for
[1:02:25] you to have an individual experience and
[1:02:27] for him to work with you in an
[1:02:29] individual level
[1:02:31] amen this is why Boaz came to
[1:02:34] Ruth
[1:02:37] individually he came to you on an
[1:02:39] individual
[1:02:40] level somebody might have spoke to you
[1:02:43] might have been a human Veil but it was
[1:02:45] God clothed in that Veil that spoke to
[1:02:47] you
[1:02:48] absolutely yes it's God dealing and
[1:02:51] moving and working in your life that's
[1:02:53] is that right so notice here where where
[1:02:57] she's at where where have you been you
[1:02:59] know she's seeing an Evidence in her
[1:03:03] life I'm sure many can fellowship with
[1:03:06] me on this there were evidences when God
[1:03:08] begin to get a hold of a life there's
[1:03:11] evidences that started to come in my
[1:03:13] life even though it wasn't all at once
[1:03:16] but there were evidences there were
[1:03:18] things that begin to move and go and
[1:03:20] flee out of my life desires begin to go
[1:03:23] there were evidences that that you know
[1:03:25] other could see that this these are
[1:03:27] things that I'm no longer bothered by
[1:03:29] but you know what the things that even
[1:03:32] that were still seeming to tug on my
[1:03:34] life brother Samuel what did you do I
[1:03:36] laid it down by God's grace and said
[1:03:40] Lord I don't want this in my
[1:03:43] life you got to be willing to lay it
[1:03:47] down well I need God to take it from me
[1:03:49] the prophet said in marriage of the Lamb
[1:03:52] he said me people are saying oh if God
[1:03:54] only take this evil spirit from me I'll
[1:03:57] serve him he said you have something to
[1:04:00] do am it's where we stand on that place
[1:04:03] and say I'm not going to tolerate the
[1:04:06] enemy taking this in my life the
[1:04:08] intimidation and and the things that he
[1:04:11] wants to try to hold me with I want to
[1:04:14] be a fully evidenced
[1:04:18] Christian come on friends we got to take
[1:04:20] the
[1:04:21] initiative the spirit of this age is a
[1:04:25] spirit of soft Easy
[1:04:28] Living it's like everything needs to be
[1:04:31] handed to us and done for us listen he's
[1:04:34] already went to Calvary he rose from the
[1:04:36] grave he ascended on high and he sent
[1:04:39] back the Holy Ghost he sent a message to
[1:04:41] you and I now it is up to you and I do
[1:04:44] you now believe
[1:04:47] am hallu that's where it comes down to
[1:04:52] now when we look at this here with Ruth
[1:04:56] where have where have you been
[1:04:59] today because you're seeing the evidence
[1:05:02] praise the Lord and Naomi after Ruth
[1:05:06] says this is the man's name Boaz now
[1:05:08] it's evident Naomi has not talked with
[1:05:12] Ruth about Boaz right
[1:05:16] right but this is the man's name who
[1:05:18] took knowledge of me and Naomi said unto
[1:05:22] her daughter Blessed Be he of the Lord
[1:05:24] who hath not left left off his kindness
[1:05:27] to the living and to the dead right and
[1:05:31] Naomi said unto her the man is near of
[1:05:34] kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen now
[1:05:38] I want you to notice what's happened
[1:05:40] when Naomi came back into the land she
[1:05:44] said call me
[1:05:47] Mara call me
[1:05:49] bitter because God hath dealt with me
[1:05:52] bitterly let me just say this to you God
[1:05:55] we was not going to lose
[1:05:58] one when Naomi went out decisions that
[1:06:01] were made no doubt it wasn't Naomi's
[1:06:04] decision but she being a faithful
[1:06:06] companion has she walked with immc and
[1:06:10] went out there but notice anytime
[1:06:14] brother br will say it over and over he
[1:06:15] takes Abraham's life brings it all the
[1:06:17] way down anytime we get out of the
[1:06:20] god-given land that God has given us
[1:06:24] there's always going to be trouble
[1:06:26] let me just say this to you it's a good
[1:06:28] litmus test that when you see trouble
[1:06:30] coming around don't always be quick to
[1:06:33] call trouble
[1:06:36] trials are you hearing me friends
[1:06:39] because sometimes that can be very
[1:06:40] deceiving and sometime the troubles are
[1:06:43] not trials it's God trying to bring us
[1:06:46] to awareness you've got outside of the
[1:06:49] boundaries of the land that I have given
[1:06:52] you to abide in that's right yeah
[1:06:55] friends it's of the Lord's mercies that
[1:06:57] we're not
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:06:59] consumed it's of the God's mercies
[1:07:01] because let me just tell you something
[1:07:03] like this there's times when every one
[1:07:05] of us have gotten out of the bounds of
[1:07:07] this land sometimes we got out of the
[1:07:09] bounds of this land with our
[1:07:12] attitudes come on now because remember
[1:07:14] it's not all black and white this is the
[1:07:17] word of God but remember what was
[1:07:19] revealed in this hour God did not come
[1:07:21] and reveal a Doctrine it was the person
[1:07:24] of Jesus Christ the character of
[1:07:27] almighty God has been brought on display
[1:07:30] to the Church of the Living God so
[1:07:33] there's sometimes where you don't find
[1:07:35] things as far as saying where is this at
[1:07:37] in the scripture how do I approach this
[1:07:39] situation you have to look at the
[1:07:41] character of
[1:07:43] Christ how do I approach this as a
[1:07:46] Christian as a Believer remember the
[1:07:49] prophet said even when tests and Trials
[1:07:51] Come not to be complaining and moping
[1:07:54] but let us conduct ourselves as Sons and
[1:07:57] Daughters of god notice not not the Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit conduct for us but us being
[1:08:02] empowered some you know when when the
[1:08:04] Holy Spirit is come it is quickened you
[1:08:06] and I as Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:08:08] it is not you and I sitting around like
[1:08:10] the Pinocchio puppet and God doing
[1:08:12] everything it's up to us to yield and
[1:08:15] surrender to the word of God it's up to
[1:08:18] you and I the Bible said if you through
[1:08:20] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[1:08:23] body the Bible said that the weapons of
[1:08:25] our Warfare are are not carnal But
[1:08:27] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:08:30] of strongholds we just in our own
[1:08:32] reasoning in our own thought process we
[1:08:34] are a failure but if we will submit to
[1:08:37] the Holy Spirit which is the word of God
[1:08:40] which is the character of God then we
[1:08:43] receive a strength to pull down
[1:08:45] strongholds Hall oh brother you might
[1:08:49] say brother Samuel when I look at this
[1:08:52] with Naomi and I look at it too like
[1:08:54] this here you have a situation that
[1:08:57] Naomi I'm just going to tell you she
[1:09:00] didn't see any
[1:09:03] hope she knew the Bible lets us know in
[1:09:07] Roman in Chapter 2 that there was a man
[1:09:10] a mighty man of wealth of Boaz but
[1:09:12] remember she had been out of the
[1:09:14] land it ain't like how you and I
[1:09:16] communicate today even across the
[1:09:20] seas you know like I have to turn my
[1:09:23] ringer off cuz I have brothers in Uganda
[1:09:25] and other places you know right you know
[1:09:28] texting in the middle of the night and
[1:09:29] so so it ain't like that they they
[1:09:31] didn't have that but you know what God
[1:09:33] is leading everything right just where
[1:09:36] it needs to be but as soon as Naomi
[1:09:39] catches a glimpse of what is in Ruth's
[1:09:44] possession Ruth does not even fully
[1:09:48] aware of what she has are you hearing me
[1:09:52] friends when God sent this message in
[1:09:55] this adal see and day the church was not
[1:09:58] fully aware of what was among
[1:10:02] them the birthright had come among
[1:10:06] them the Seal of the Living God had come
[1:10:10] among them the son of man was visiting
[1:10:13] the church in his fullness and his
[1:10:17] power but how many said oh the gifts in
[1:10:19] operation that's a prophet but don't he
[1:10:22] to his Doctrine oh no don't follow that
[1:10:26] don't go along with that listen you can
[1:10:28] even find the different ones today
[1:10:30] that'll talk of it there's there's men
[1:10:32] that have actually went and they meet up
[1:10:35] in Arizona in a hotel room and here they
[1:10:38] are they have connections with different
[1:10:40] ones that are you know in the message
[1:10:42] and things and they get out there and
[1:10:44] they're talking yes this is a special
[1:10:46] place this is where the Angels Came and
[1:10:48] they're in the hotel and we believe that
[1:10:50] what God did there it was only just a
[1:10:52] little tip of what God is going to be
[1:10:55] doing through a group of people and I
[1:10:58] looked at that in the video and I'm
[1:10:59] saying you got women sitting there in
[1:11:02] pants they got earrings in that you can
[1:11:05] put a saddle on and put your feet in
[1:11:08] come on Friends the Holy Ghost cleans us
[1:11:10] up you know an earrings AR it's a sign
[1:11:13] of slavery it is that right the Bible
[1:11:16] said when they refused to go away they
[1:11:18] were bored in the
[1:11:20] ear right is that right this is why that
[1:11:23] even when we look at that even with
[1:11:25] paint paint's not even real there's only
[1:11:27] one person in the Bible that ever
[1:11:29] painted her face and that was
[1:11:31] Jezebel are you hearing me follow me now
[1:11:34] you're not going to find one scripture
[1:11:35] it says Thou shalt not paint thy face I
[1:11:37] know where I'm at brother Brown quotes
[1:11:39] are writing forsaking it all in the
[1:11:41] message but what you look at is the
[1:11:42] characteristic why was it being
[1:11:45] done look even science tells you it's
[1:11:48] not even natural the carcinogens that
[1:11:51] are in
[1:11:52] it come on friends that's so good it's
[1:11:55] not natural you know what it is it's
[1:11:59] Spirits this is where Ruth was at here
[1:12:03] she was and and the situations that was
[1:12:06] moving around and Naomi is working and
[1:12:09] and wanting to minister to Ruth but so
[1:12:12] many have looked at just the message and
[1:12:15] did not catch it for what the message
[1:12:17] really is now let me tell you something
[1:12:20] we can sit here all day and throw off on
[1:12:22] that but I'm asking you have you caught
[1:12:26] what this message is all
[1:12:27] about this message is about a
[1:12:31] relationship between Christ and his
[1:12:34] bride that's right it's about Christ
[1:12:37] coming in you the hope of glory amen are
[1:12:41] you hearing me right oh my when he comes
[1:12:43] in man oh has he he's the love of your
[1:12:46] life it's all that
[1:12:48] matters it's all that matters that
[1:12:50] forsaking and laying aside of everything
[1:12:53] now notice this
[1:12:55] if Naomi had not been
[1:12:57] there Ruth would if Naomi hadn't said
[1:13:00] anything Ruth would have never known
[1:13:02] she'd had just continued on with
[1:13:03] handfuls of purpose thank God for
[1:13:06] handfuls of purpose but what are they
[1:13:09] about because you realize that the
[1:13:12] church and when I say the church even
[1:13:15] sometimes it can come right Among Us
[1:13:18] well God's blessing me I you know I feel
[1:13:21] good I feel but you see friends that can
[1:13:23] be so deceptive it's got to come where
[1:13:26] is your life with the word that takes a
[1:13:28] courageous stand amen cuz you could
[1:13:31] rehearse all the doctrines of the
[1:13:33] message you can be anointed to speak in
[1:13:35] tongues you can have all kinds of
[1:13:37] emotions and I believe in emotions I'm
[1:13:40] not against emotions but at the end of
[1:13:42] the day there's only one thing that
[1:13:45] declares we are an overcomer and that's
[1:13:47] the word of
[1:13:49] God are you hearing
[1:13:53] me this is why when the holy spirit
[1:13:55] being poured out it can be poured out
[1:13:57] upon All Flesh it can come there upon
[1:13:59] the Flesh and anoint the flesh anoint
[1:14:02] even in the spirit but it's got to come
[1:14:04] down to the soul the purpose of this
[1:14:06] message was to bring a
[1:14:08] relationship between God and man is that
[1:14:11] not what the prophet said at the end and
[1:14:13] the closing of the church age book right
[1:14:15] even on the leaflets in the tape box
[1:14:17] that they put on there not for one
[1:14:19] moment do I bring a message to start an
[1:14:21] organization or that people might follow
[1:14:23] me but I have one purpose and one goal
[1:14:27] that I am for and that's to see a real
[1:14:30] relationship and Union to be brought
[1:14:33] between God and his
[1:14:36] people the only way that Union could be
[1:14:39] is because veils have been torn down
[1:14:42] veils of
[1:14:46] tradition Where Have You Been
[1:14:49] Ruth and Ruth
[1:14:51] said well the man's name
[1:14:55] is he's Boaz it's Boaz can you imagine
[1:15:01] Naomi Boaz because you know why she
[1:15:04] knows who Boaz
[1:15:07] is you see Jesus of the new is Jehovah
[1:15:12] of the
[1:15:14] old what he came to fulfill he came to
[1:15:17] fulfill that of the Old Testament all of
[1:15:20] what spoke of him in his messiahship is
[1:15:24] that right
[1:15:25] also was hidden in there about the
[1:15:27] calling of a gentile bride but that was
[1:15:29] all hidden in there and laid in there
[1:15:32] naomy now ministering to Ruth about what
[1:15:37] is at hand I want you just to just to
[1:15:40] think of this of how that where it's at
[1:15:43] and you know brother BR says it like
[1:15:45] this let me let me find it here as he
[1:15:47] says it in this manner he says
[1:15:50] concerning who it is right here that
[1:15:52] that is Among Us and I want you to watch
[1:15:54] how he's got it heard it here in the
[1:15:56] message the Easter seal I don't have it
[1:15:57] up there he said I want you to think of
[1:15:59] it he's he's talking to the people at
[1:16:01] the end he said how can you leave
[1:16:03] something like this uh don't you believe
[1:16:05] him H how can you do it h you you just
[1:16:08] it looks like you just you have to pull
[1:16:10] yourself away do you feel that he said
[1:16:13] maybe it's just me but but I had a
[1:16:15] feeling just a strange feeling when I
[1:16:17] come among the people where you set
[1:16:19] together like this I know somewhere
[1:16:22] invisible here just like radio
[1:16:25] television whatever it is passing
[1:16:27] through this room Christ is in this room
[1:16:31] just think Our Redeemer is
[1:16:36] here notice he's seeing the evidences I
[1:16:40] I feel his
[1:16:41] presence come on friends oh brother
[1:16:44] Samuel we're not to go according to
[1:16:46] feelings the brother brandom said it
[1:16:47] like this he said for those that want to
[1:16:49] tear down upon emotions he said let me
[1:16:52] ask you what is it that comes Upon a
[1:16:54] person he said that would cause them to
[1:16:57] begin to praise the Lord and Shout cuz I
[1:16:59] know a lot of these things have taken a
[1:17:01] hit because it's really unbalance the
[1:17:03] way things have been presented but let
[1:17:04] me just say it to you like this brother
[1:17:06] R said what it is that could not be a
[1:17:08] response like that if the Holy Spirit
[1:17:11] not coming upon a nerve somewhere and
[1:17:14] there's a response to the word of
[1:17:16] God hallelujah come on friends sometimes
[1:17:20] they realize you got a lot of dry hides
[1:17:22] that's try to take away the real moving
[1:17:24] of the Holy Spirit reduce it down to
[1:17:26] just a a believism and a and just what
[1:17:29] we just accept it and we just believe it
[1:17:31] the holy spirit let me just go ahead and
[1:17:33] tell you the day that the holy spirit is
[1:17:36] no longer welcome here I will
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:40] resign how resigning you can have it all
[1:17:43] because without him this church is
[1:17:46] nothing you can have all the books you
[1:17:48] can have all the tapes you can have all
[1:17:50] the quotes but if you don't have him let
[1:17:52] me just say what a prophet said it's
[1:17:55] nothing but a Beed dead
[1:18:00] corpse hallu we don't want to legislate
[1:18:03] worship out of the church we don't want
[1:18:06] to legislate a moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:09] Come on
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:13] friends and I think it's clear enough
[1:18:16] you know exactly where I stand according
[1:18:17] to the word you you be how God has made
[1:18:20] you to be if not then you just simply be
[1:18:23] impersonating somebody else that's are
[1:18:25] you hearing me right amen amen well I
[1:18:29] might as well say it while I'm at it
[1:18:31] that's why I don't believe we come here
[1:18:32] to work and try to evaluate I wonder if
[1:18:35] so and so's doing this because of so and
[1:18:37] so you need your mind in the right place
[1:18:40] God never sent you or anybody here to
[1:18:43] sit here and be a judge of somebody else
[1:18:45] you need to come and get focused on God
[1:18:48] who knows God might get a hold of
[1:18:51] you come on Friends
[1:18:55] I tell you better be careful the voices
[1:18:57] you listen
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:02] to
[1:19:05] abely a lot of times I've had
[1:19:07] individuals well I see this quote I said
[1:19:09] yeah but there's another quote
[1:19:11] too I'm not just a one quote man you if
[1:19:14] you take that quote and then it's going
[1:19:16] against this one right here something's
[1:19:17] wrong not with the quotes with your
[1:19:20] interpretation nothing wrong with the
[1:19:23] message nothing wrong with the
[1:19:26] message is that
[1:19:28] right now notice this just think Our
[1:19:31] Redeemer he's here who could be any
[1:19:35] happier than people who possess with
[1:19:37] Bible evidence of every word of God
[1:19:40] being made manifest to see even to
[1:19:42] angels and his being as they have
[1:19:45] Through the Ages
[1:19:48] Hallelujah think of it what we're seeing
[1:19:52] and moving Among Us
[1:19:54] now let me just let me just turn the
[1:19:56] corner here to try to try to tie this
[1:19:58] here just a
[1:20:02] moment
[1:20:04] Naomi she didn't see any
[1:20:09] hope but as soon as this
[1:20:12] evidence was seen in Ruth's possession
[1:20:16] right she had a restored hope hallelujah
[1:20:21] amen is that right she had faith in God
[1:20:25] but now she now she begins to talk about
[1:20:27] a he's a near Kinsman notice she's not
[1:20:30] just focused on those handfuls of meal
[1:20:31] like glory to God thank God hey look
[1:20:34] they were happy they weren't starving
[1:20:35] they were well fed but but the purpose
[1:20:38] of this who is it it's it's him it's him
[1:20:41] it's he's a he's he's a Kinsman he's a
[1:20:44] next of
[1:20:46] kin is that right I want you to think
[1:20:49] about there no doubt has been we can see
[1:20:51] down through the scriptures there's been
[1:20:52] many times no doubt times in your life
[1:20:54] my life and will be where it looks like
[1:20:58] there's no
[1:20:59] hope for a situation oh yes for a thing
[1:21:03] maybe a marriage maybe a home maybe you
[1:21:05] look at a loved one it seemed like
[1:21:06] they're going the completely opposite
[1:21:08] way remember when the fall took place in
[1:21:11] the
[1:21:13] garden there was no hope in
[1:21:16] sight but then God stepped down amen and
[1:21:20] when God stepped down he said
[1:21:23] behold I make a way back
[1:21:27] amen amen I will put enmity between thy
[1:21:30] seed and the serpent seed what did he do
[1:21:34] he gave them a real hope an expectation
[1:21:40] where there wasn't any it looked like it
[1:21:43] was defeated and that's what looked like
[1:21:45] to be defeat but God came on the scene
[1:21:49] yes amen every time when it looks like
[1:21:52] where where as the prophet said where
[1:21:54] the message and the messenger are in a
[1:21:57] place of defeat that's when God steps on
[1:22:00] the scene that's the same way that it is
[1:22:04] in your life same way in my
[1:22:07] life I want you to think of it here even
[1:22:10] as where we stand in this hour John
[1:22:14] being a type of the Bride John there in
[1:22:17] Revelations 5 John he he looked and and
[1:22:21] the Bible said I I saw there was no one
[1:22:23] Worthy in in in heaven or in Earth there
[1:22:26] was there was great notable men Elijah
[1:22:29] Jeremiah many of the rest of them but
[1:22:31] none of them was worthy to take the
[1:22:34] book it looked like all hope was
[1:22:38] lost are you hearing me it spoke of the
[1:22:41] bleakness of condition of where it would
[1:22:44] be in the end time where it looks like
[1:22:47] there's no hope but at that moment there
[1:22:49] was a Voice
[1:22:51] Hallelujah that came and said John weep
[1:22:55] not for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:22:59] hath
[1:23:01] prevailed to take the book and to loose
[1:23:05] the seals
[1:23:07] thereof hallelujah what was it the
[1:23:10] opening of the word it was a restoring
[1:23:14] of the church to the original hope and
[1:23:18] that hope is the coming of the Lord the
[1:23:21] changing of these bodies the rapture
[1:23:24] all will be redeemed the Earth coming
[1:23:28] into full Redemption a millennium a
[1:23:31] future home a wedding
[1:23:34] supper no wonder it's the most Sublime
[1:23:37] act in the scriptures when he has taken
[1:23:40] the book amen now let me tell you this
[1:23:43] that same God through that right there
[1:23:48] of taking the book and he he stood there
[1:23:51] night after night revealing yes what was
[1:23:56] in the contents of those seals amen is
[1:24:00] that right that's why the prophet could
[1:24:02] point back to he said remember he said
[1:24:05] here he is standing the lamb he said we
[1:24:08] know that God is not three separate
[1:24:11] persons but it's the same almighty God
[1:24:15] is that right it was the angel of the
[1:24:17] Lord among the Church of the Living God
[1:24:21] as a matter of fact the prophet could
[1:24:22] say it in another place he said he he
[1:24:24] took the seals off
[1:24:28] himself off of
[1:24:31] himself and through that and through
[1:24:33] that it breathed a hope into the Church
[1:24:38] of the Living God it because you know
[1:24:40] why it breathe life anywhere where
[1:24:43] there's life when that comes in you can
[1:24:46] look at a situation and they can say
[1:24:49] there's no hope here no hope here no
[1:24:51] hope here as far as what you see
[1:24:55] as far as what you know but God's
[1:24:59] word has been raised back up as an
[1:25:04] absolute that God's word cannot fail
[1:25:07] because God can
[1:25:10] fail it's
[1:25:12] impossible
[1:25:14] Hallelujah he swore by himself he not
[1:25:18] only gave the promise but he swore by
[1:25:20] himself I will fulfill and keep the word
[1:25:25] he's made it certain as he's come Among
[1:25:28] Us Ruth what is that it's the certainty
[1:25:32] of God that he keeps his
[1:25:36] promises
[1:25:38] Hallelujah so what are you look at him
[1:25:40] don't look at yourself there ain't
[1:25:42] nothing certain about you or me look at
[1:25:44] the word the word is the evidence she
[1:25:46] wasn't looking at Ruth she was partner
[1:25:48] to the evidence the evidence the
[1:25:51] evidence why do I know that he's taking
[1:25:54] kindness in me look at the
[1:25:57] evidence look at how he's dealt with
[1:25:59] your life look at how he spoke to your
[1:26:01] heart even when you tried to get away he
[1:26:04] drew you
[1:26:06] back hall it's evidence Hall hallah
[1:26:12] blessed be the Lord who not left off
[1:26:16] kindness
[1:26:18] Mercy loving Mercy Mercy
[1:26:30] he breathed right back into the Church
[1:26:33] of the Living God a living reality where
[1:26:36] Paul Paul could even take it and say you
[1:26:38] and I in Ephesians 2 we we didn't even
[1:26:41] have brother Joy there was nothing of a
[1:26:43] promise of adoption of covenants there
[1:26:46] was no hope Paul said no Hope We Were
[1:26:48] Strangers of the Commonwealth of Israel
[1:26:51] but Christ himself oh my but now now in
[1:26:54] Christ Jesus ye who were far off are
[1:26:58] made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:01] that shows it's not of our works our
[1:27:03] righteousness our
[1:27:05] goodness do you realize even a character
[1:27:08] in your life to raise
[1:27:10] up and say it's nothing but the truth
[1:27:14] let me just say this to you this
[1:27:16] shouldn't stumble you it might be a
[1:27:18] person maybe their hair would be bobbed
[1:27:20] off and painted up and maybe it' be a
[1:27:22] man wearing short britches and all of a
[1:27:24] the word comes across his pathway and
[1:27:26] say that ain't nothing but the truth and
[1:27:29] God began to deal with that life you
[1:27:30] know what that is that's a character
[1:27:32] that God can begin to work on and bring
[1:27:35] to a full complete
[1:27:40] expression listen God knows what's
[1:27:42] buried beneath this dirt come on friends
[1:27:45] he's the one he knows yes
[1:27:48] Hees hallu we didn't have any hope no
[1:27:52] but God came amen are you with me God
[1:27:57] came that's why it's important to
[1:27:59] recognize him in his appearing as he's
[1:28:01] appearing among us this is why even as
[1:28:05] you look at everything where it looks
[1:28:07] like brother BR says a a thumbs down
[1:28:09] time even when they went into the fa
[1:28:11] fiery furnace they did not have any hope
[1:28:15] that they were going to be
[1:28:17] delivered but they knew one thing we are
[1:28:20] we know in whom we have believed we know
[1:28:23] we're going to be delivered from your
[1:28:24] hands right we ain't bowing I don't know
[1:28:27] what's going to happen in there but I
[1:28:29] sure ain't bwing I'm not caving to this
[1:28:32] world are you with me they went in there
[1:28:35] but when they got in
[1:28:38] there that's where God made himself
[1:28:41] known to them in a way like they never
[1:28:44] knew him
[1:28:46] before God even made the king that threw
[1:28:48] him in there testify there's a one among
[1:28:51] them he looked like the son of man
[1:28:55] it looks like the one I've heard them
[1:28:57] talk about it looks like it how do you
[1:29:00] know I see the evidence the fire is
[1:29:03] bending out from them it's not consuming
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:09] them he met him in the
[1:29:13] fire it was hope that was breathed in
[1:29:16] them then think about it they were
[1:29:17] walking brother Joey and fellowshipping
[1:29:19] in the midst of the
[1:29:21] fire you know what that means Brother
[1:29:23] Ray right in the the midst of a test or
[1:29:25] trial that we can have fellowship with
[1:29:27] God just as great if not greater that's
[1:29:30] what Paul said that I might know him in
[1:29:32] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:29:33] fellowship of his sufferings is that
[1:29:37] right sometimes it takes those little
[1:29:39] things because of this flesh that we're
[1:29:41] still in it takes those things to get us
[1:29:43] tendered up a little bit and back
[1:29:45] tendered up into his presence and right
[1:29:48] there that communion is so sweet anytime
[1:29:50] you ever invite him into the test or
[1:29:53] trial or where you're at he is still the
[1:29:56] same tree of life and when you place him
[1:29:58] in Troubled Waters he'll sweeten the
[1:30:00] Waters of Mara for
[1:30:02] you hallelujah how many know that's the
[1:30:07] truth hallelujah Witnesses all
[1:30:10] throughout this building oh my when it
[1:30:13] looked like the message was about
[1:30:14] defeated that's when God stepped in oh
[1:30:18] my when it looked like here the Lord
[1:30:20] Jesus they took him captive and remember
[1:30:23] it shook the the the disciples the Sheep
[1:30:26] take Smite the shepherd it'll scatter
[1:30:28] the Sheep when it looked like it was all
[1:30:31] defeated we thought he was the
[1:30:35] one here they took him in Pilot's Hall
[1:30:38] and he stood there he looked defeated
[1:30:42] but he wasn't
[1:30:44] defeated he knew exactly where he was
[1:30:47] standing and he said you could have no
[1:30:49] power over me right except it was given
[1:30:52] you see that's how you need to recognize
[1:30:54] your trials there's not a trial could
[1:30:56] come my way except God permitted
[1:31:00] it sometimes the boss does this or that
[1:31:02] and I know sometimes we have to go
[1:31:04] according to proper channels but
[1:31:06] sometimes even with when we go to proper
[1:31:08] channels are you hearing me now
[1:31:10] sometimes it's also to recognize that
[1:31:11] you know what God can be and is
[1:31:14] permitting that if everything is being
[1:31:17] steadfast in your walk with God God's
[1:31:18] permitting that also to temper
[1:31:21] you temper me to see how we're going to
[1:31:23] respond respond how we're going to react
[1:31:26] come on are we going to take out the
[1:31:27] picket line of a bad
[1:31:29] attitude come on Friends listen we're
[1:31:32] still flesh I'm preaching to I'm I'm
[1:31:34] including myself I can't hop down there
[1:31:36] and hop back up here at the same time
[1:31:38] but what are we going to do right is
[1:31:40] that
[1:31:41] right but notice when it was in that
[1:31:44] time of real weakness that's the time
[1:31:47] when the greatest Victory came he rose
[1:31:51] on that Easter morning
[1:31:54] when it looked like there was no hope
[1:31:55] for the Church of the Living God here he
[1:31:58] came and he came how does he bring hope
[1:32:02] he don't bring Hope by just some
[1:32:04] inflated thing he brings hope through
[1:32:07] the fulfilling of his word am because
[1:32:10] when his word is be and I know you say
[1:32:13] well that was Job chapter 19 but you got
[1:32:15] to remember there's a there's a
[1:32:17] revealing as he comes in the middle of
[1:32:19] the book and then as he comes at the end
[1:32:21] of the book and when it got to the end
[1:32:23] of it job was standing there and when
[1:32:28] remember job spoke where it looked like
[1:32:31] there was no hope for anything to be
[1:32:35] restored are you hearing me now he
[1:32:38] talked about a tree being uprooted I
[1:32:39] think it's job 17 where it's not just
[1:32:42] where the sap has went down and The
[1:32:43] Roots and it's going to come back up
[1:32:44] again he talked about that in job 20 job
[1:32:47] 19 but in job 17 he said I'm like a tree
[1:32:49] that's been uprooted where there ain't
[1:32:52] no hope there ain't going to be no
[1:32:53] blossoms coming on on this tree it's
[1:32:54] been uprooted and see there there
[1:32:57] there's things and
[1:32:59] situations that like that that can come
[1:33:01] into our life even
[1:33:04] now but job as he stood
[1:33:06] there and he all throughout his trial
[1:33:10] but then it broke and job said I know my
[1:33:15] redeemer
[1:33:18] liveth what did God do he revealed
[1:33:21] himself to job that I'm your
[1:33:25] Redeemer your Redeemer
[1:33:28] liveth he's alive what a glorious
[1:33:32] Revelation that's a revelation you
[1:33:34] realize the prophet ties it in that's a
[1:33:36] revelation that broke all of the holes
[1:33:40] and the Gloom around job's
[1:33:42] life because why when you realize that's
[1:33:45] a redeemer I belong to him amen it
[1:33:49] becomes such an great and Assurance of
[1:33:51] whose property I am amen
[1:33:54] oh my oh my brother Bram says you know
[1:33:57] you think about it he said sometimes he
[1:33:59] said in those great dark hours we're
[1:34:01] living in when all hope seemingly is
[1:34:03] gone it's Christ the solid rock we stand
[1:34:06] when all other grounds are sinking
[1:34:09] sand Lazarus had passed looked like no
[1:34:13] hope
[1:34:15] right but then he came
[1:34:18] amen and once again when they looked and
[1:34:20] said well I know in the last days he'll
[1:34:23] rise but but he announced right there
[1:34:24] who he was you see the evidence is right
[1:34:27] here among you I am the resurrection and
[1:34:30] Life The God Who promised the
[1:34:32] Resurrection The God Who will bring that
[1:34:34] forth I am the resurrection and life
[1:34:38] right then and there what was it there
[1:34:40] was a hope that was breathed into their
[1:34:47] heart and God went and told two women
[1:34:51] two women right to roll away the stone
[1:34:55] mhm these two I don't know how tall they
[1:34:57] were maybe they were This Tall maybe I
[1:34:59] don't know how tall they were I don't
[1:35:00] believe that they had shoulders like
[1:35:01] barn doors
[1:35:03] either they might have had to step
[1:35:05] around some big guys some big
[1:35:08] Pharisees excuse me excuse me what are
[1:35:11] you doing we're going to go rolling away
[1:35:12] the stone oh Lord we knew we knew they
[1:35:16] were Fanatics we knew ever since that
[1:35:19] they started following him and we kicked
[1:35:21] them out of our church oh we
[1:35:24] Lord even in a situation like this you
[1:35:26] think you all would have some
[1:35:32] sense but they walked over and they
[1:35:35] did their part showing their
[1:35:40] faith see God might be asking you to
[1:35:43] roll away the stone in your
[1:35:47] life some that stone might be repent be
[1:35:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:52] Christ and you shall received the gift
[1:35:54] of the Holy Ghost that stone to be
[1:35:56] rolled away maybe might be to make
[1:35:57] something right that you need to make
[1:36:00] right are you with me roll away that
[1:36:02] stone because if you roll away that
[1:36:05] stone how do I roll it away not by your
[1:36:07] natural strength but faith in the word
[1:36:10] of God what the word is asking you to do
[1:36:13] will move that stone away and what
[1:36:15] seemed hopeless will be standing right
[1:36:18] before you Hallelujah your Victory your
[1:36:22] deliverance your healing
[1:36:24] the Holy
[1:36:26] Ghost roll away the
[1:36:30] stone you if they would have caught a
[1:36:32] peak of
[1:36:33] Lazarus cuz I'm sure when they rolled
[1:36:35] away the stone their breath probably was
[1:36:38] taken
[1:36:40] away brother Bram tells us his nose had
[1:36:43] already fallen
[1:36:44] in yeah corruption had already set in
[1:36:47] are you hearing me now and I I know just
[1:36:50] give me a few more minutes here if you
[1:36:52] you and I would have looked at the
[1:36:54] situation we would have said not just
[1:36:55] because oh you know he's been he's dead
[1:36:58] we could have said well I've seen God
[1:36:59] rais the dead before but when just to
[1:37:01] look at that situation and his nose has
[1:37:03] already fallen in corruption's already
[1:37:05] set in but God let you and I know that
[1:37:08] even though the corruption can set in
[1:37:10] but the word of God is still above
[1:37:13] corruption let me tell you that's the
[1:37:15] same way it is maybe in your life your
[1:37:17] family's life or a loved one's life it
[1:37:19] might looked as corrupt as corrupt could
[1:37:21] be but there's nothing beyond the hope
[1:37:24] of almighty God it's a God who breathes
[1:37:28] hope into your life Why by breathing his
[1:37:32] word in fulfillment and we see the
[1:37:35] evidence hey there's
[1:37:37] hope there's hope for
[1:37:40] me when the devil say oh you've tried
[1:37:42] you've done this you've done that but
[1:37:44] here he comes with his evidence and what
[1:37:46] do you do don't look at all of your
[1:37:47] failures you look at the evidence of God
[1:37:50] still speaking to your heart God dealing
[1:37:52] with your life and your heart raising up
[1:37:54] and saying yes Lord Lord more than
[1:37:56] anything look at that evidence because
[1:37:59] that evidence is God's sign it's God's
[1:38:03] seal of what God intends and desires to
[1:38:06] do in your
[1:38:09] life it's that
[1:38:13] evidence I don't know about you but
[1:38:15] there's been there's been I've had needs
[1:38:18] I've had
[1:38:19] situations sometimes of things that I'm
[1:38:21] praying about and man I don't see no
[1:38:23] movement on
[1:38:25] it maybe I just maybe if four or five of
[1:38:28] you come up here we'll just Fellowship
[1:38:29] maybe not everybody's been there but I
[1:38:31] think everybody has been sometimes we're
[1:38:33] praying for things and it don't seem
[1:38:35] like anything's going the right way as a
[1:38:37] matter of fact it seems things like it's
[1:38:39] going contrary but then all of a sudden
[1:38:42] God will come in through a service God
[1:38:43] will come in in a way maybe it's why
[1:38:45] you're driving to work maybe it's why
[1:38:46] you're listening to a message and all of
[1:38:48] a sudden just one little something will
[1:38:51] drop your way it's not even a something
[1:38:53] that says it's finished it's over or are
[1:38:56] this and this and this it might just be
[1:38:58] a little something of a l of secret
[1:39:01] whispered from him you know what that is
[1:39:04] that's an
[1:39:05] Evidence that's an Evidence what seems
[1:39:09] like there's no
[1:39:11] hope he restores
[1:39:15] hope hallelujah how does he do it by the
[1:39:18] breath of his
[1:39:20] word hallu
[1:39:26] brother brandham or the banks brother L
[1:39:30] we out there
[1:39:32] fishing I love this
[1:39:34] story I know we know it
[1:39:39] but R caught that
[1:39:41] fish little
[1:39:43] Sunfish Sometimes some of you know what
[1:39:45] fishermen know it as pan fish they're
[1:39:47] real flat and maybe they're maybe like
[1:39:49] about like that but they're not real big
[1:39:51] in body right
[1:39:56] but he caught
[1:39:57] that and he pulls out the hook trying to
[1:40:00] get it out you know how it is sometimes
[1:40:02] trying to get out a hook sometimes you
[1:40:03] get more than just loosening from the
[1:40:06] fish everything came out of that little
[1:40:10] fish all brother Brandon describes it
[1:40:13] its inance its insides had been ripped
[1:40:20] out and brother L said looks like you
[1:40:24] shot your last wad little fishy you see
[1:40:27] that's what it looked
[1:40:29] like he's only saying what he sees if
[1:40:33] you or I would have been there look
[1:40:34] brother Bram didn't keep watching that
[1:40:36] little fishy as a matter of fact when
[1:40:37] you read the account right right brother
[1:40:41] brandom and then would be like they're
[1:40:43] right here on this corner of the
[1:40:44] building and the way that that that is
[1:40:45] set up that little fishy it actually
[1:40:47] just kept on floating along and it went
[1:40:50] back into what looked like a little Cove
[1:40:52] it just kept on floating along let me
[1:40:55] tell you something right now it was out
[1:40:57] of the sight of the Prophet it was out
[1:40:59] of the sight of the of the other men in
[1:41:02] the boat but it wasn't out of God's
[1:41:06] sight it didn't matter if it was a
[1:41:08] little fish brother BR said there were
[1:41:11] cases on the list at home to be prayed
[1:41:15] for of children other things
[1:41:18] that were big
[1:41:20] cases Hallelujah and God moved down for
[1:41:26] that little fish when that was said and
[1:41:29] spoken that way and God said little
[1:41:32] fishy I give you back your life you know
[1:41:35] what it was here was a Son of God that
[1:41:38] was under the control of the mind of
[1:41:41] Christ let me tell you the mind of
[1:41:43] Christ has come back into the Church of
[1:41:46] the Living God it's God speaking over
[1:41:49] your life of things that you may not
[1:41:51] even see but God's word brings hope in
[1:41:54] your
[1:41:56] life the very insides was ripped
[1:42:00] out you tell me how that happened I'll
[1:42:03] tell you God God put it back together
[1:42:05] again brother brandom never told us that
[1:42:07] all of a sudden the insides just went
[1:42:09] right back in the fish he didn't even
[1:42:10] describe it in that way he said as soon
[1:42:12] as that was said that little fishy be
[1:42:15] the flap turned up and went off
[1:42:18] fishing you know what happened it looked
[1:42:20] like something Beyond Redemption
[1:42:24] it looked like it was beyond hope it was
[1:42:27] rote off it can never it can never
[1:42:30] happen but God moved down by his word
[1:42:33] and showed you and I there's nothing
[1:42:38] impossible nothing is impossible to them
[1:42:41] that
[1:42:43] believe when he's here he's in the
[1:42:46] building he's Among Us he's in your life
[1:42:49] he's the restorer of Hope in his word he
[1:42:53] the one that brought Naomi back to see
[1:42:56] hey wait a minute these handfuls of
[1:42:58] purpose and you you say it was Boaz
[1:43:01] blessed be the Lord that have not left
[1:43:04] off kindness to the living and to the
[1:43:09] dead it's God that restores
[1:43:16] hope it was gyrus he finally broke down
[1:43:20] and went to go get the master
[1:43:24] his daughter passed
[1:43:26] away and as he got back with Jesus he's
[1:43:30] almost there to his house I mean can you
[1:43:33] imagine he's seen he's not only heard
[1:43:36] Miracles but he's seen Miracles along
[1:43:37] the way back to his
[1:43:39] house remember the woman with the issue
[1:43:41] of blood she's healed on the
[1:43:45] way and he gets maybe to about I don't
[1:43:48] know maybe where the driveway's at out
[1:43:49] here I don't know maybe the door the
[1:43:51] Bible don't really give us a a certain
[1:43:53] measurement but he was n to his house
[1:43:57] enough to where one of his servants
[1:43:58] brother Jos could run out there and say
[1:44:00] hey don't don't trouble the master no
[1:44:03] more your daughter's
[1:44:10] dead he went to get the
[1:44:13] master when life was still in her body
[1:44:16] right right that there would be a turn
[1:44:19] of events and she would rise up be
[1:44:23] healed but this situation she's
[1:44:28] dead life is gone from the
[1:44:31] body but look what Jesus said the very
[1:44:33] next
[1:44:35] verse after that said gyrus don't even
[1:44:38] get a word out and the Lord Jesus turns
[1:44:40] to him and said fear
[1:44:42] not did I not say amen I would come to
[1:44:46] their house and thy daughter shall live
[1:44:48] again notice he referred him back to the
[1:44:50] word that he gave before the situ
[1:44:53] situation occurred and that's what God
[1:44:55] has done in this hour he didn't give us
[1:44:57] a new book he didn't give us a new Bible
[1:45:01] he took the seals off the
[1:45:03] word He restored the original promise
[1:45:07] he's given let me tell you if God's
[1:45:09] given you a promise in his word that
[1:45:11] promise might have seemed like it's
[1:45:13] drifted back into a Cove and your heart
[1:45:16] and things might have been ripped out
[1:45:19] but it is not Beyond Redemption
[1:45:22] [Applause]
[1:45:25] Hallelujah I looked in heaven saw no one
[1:45:28] I looked on Earth beneath the Earth saw
[1:45:30] no one I was looking for somebody is
[1:45:33] there somebody that can take the book is
[1:45:36] there somebody that can tie me back
[1:45:40] in behold John the lion of the tribe of
[1:45:45] Judah hallu hasth
[1:45:47] prevailed to take the
[1:45:50] book to loose the seals thereof
[1:45:56] Hall God's not giving you a new word
[1:46:00] he's restored the hope that belonged to
[1:46:03] the church in the original promise that
[1:46:07] he gave remember Paul Paul being the
[1:46:09] first church agent messenger he said be
[1:46:12] not moved away from the
[1:46:15] hope the church got moved away from the
[1:46:18] hope but God has restored us back to the
[1:46:22] hope and that is the rapture the change
[1:46:25] of these
[1:46:27] bodies who's done it by him by his by
[1:46:29] his appearing his appearing right here
[1:46:31] among us we love his appearing is that
[1:46:34] right we love his appearing it's not
[1:46:36] just here in church he's in the body
[1:46:39] he's in his bright body this is what he
[1:46:41] went to Calvary for this is what he paid
[1:46:44] the price for this is why the blood was
[1:46:46] shed that he might pay the price that he
[1:46:48] might come and live inside of his
[1:46:52] children
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:46:55] that's why the message come that's why
[1:46:57] the evidences this is why God night
[1:47:00] after night healings took place so that
[1:47:03] you and I could see situations that
[1:47:06] looked so far gone there's nothing
[1:47:09] beyond God I tell you right now I trust
[1:47:13] there's been May there be such a breath
[1:47:15] of the holy spirit that would Breathe
[1:47:17] Right into hope right into lives an
[1:47:20] expectation that no matter how much
[1:47:22] you've might have felt like and looked
[1:47:24] like defeat where it seemed like there
[1:47:26] was no hope but may the breath of
[1:47:28] almighty God breathe right down into
[1:47:31] your life and receive that evidence that
[1:47:35] there is indeed a hope for Revival there
[1:47:38] is indeed a real a real Living
[1:47:45] Hope how do I know look what you look
[1:47:48] look at the evidence look at the
[1:47:50] evidence look at the evidence
[1:47:53] H do you love him this
[1:47:56] morning I tell you don't turn loose to
[1:47:58] that evidence but let the evidence fully
[1:48:01] take a hold of
[1:48:02] you let the evidence let it let the
[1:48:05] evidence lead you to the person who has
[1:48:07] given the
[1:48:09] evidence right Rebecca and Rebecca's
[1:48:12] brother and mother they were fine with
[1:48:13] the gifts that elaser
[1:48:15] left good we're fine we're fine with the
[1:48:18] gifts but Rebecca said I'm going with
[1:48:20] you
[1:48:22] I know I don't I appreciate the gifts
[1:48:26] but I know there's more because the
[1:48:28] giver I want the
[1:48:30] giver I want to give her that that's
[1:48:32] what I want Rebecca got on the
[1:48:35] camel that she
[1:48:38] watered right and she rode all the way
[1:48:42] to her bridegroom
[1:48:45] amen I'm telling you he's still God you
[1:48:48] might feel your life is like a little
[1:48:50] fishy I love that story yeah yeah
[1:48:54] yeah squirrels came into existence where
[1:48:57] squirrels shouldn't even
[1:49:00] be you catch it the prophet it wasn't
[1:49:02] just squirrels being spoken to existence
[1:49:05] it didn't make any sense for squirrels
[1:49:07] coming out of a certain type of tree the
[1:49:10] prophet you and I may not know that if
[1:49:11] you don't hunt squirrels but the prophet
[1:49:13] put that out he said I'm going to make
[1:49:14] this real ridiculous right come on speak
[1:49:17] to the mountain 1959 Los Angeles he said
[1:49:20] I'm going to make this ridiculous
[1:49:21] there'll be a squirrel come out of there
[1:49:24] you know what anybody that would have
[1:49:25] been an avid squirrel Hunter said That's
[1:49:27] crazy cuz you know why the prophet said
[1:49:28] squirrels won't come out of there now I
[1:49:30] know this right now but you see what it
[1:49:32] was showing that even in lives and
[1:49:34] situations where it seemed like there
[1:49:37] was nothing that godliness that could
[1:49:39] come out but the spoken word of God it
[1:49:42] has been spoken over your life spoken
[1:49:45] over this generation and what does it do
[1:49:47] it brings forth a real son and daughter
[1:49:50] of God it delivers you from your first
[1:49:54] birth Hallelujah it delivers to you and
[1:49:57] I the real New Birth of the Holy
[1:50:02] Spirit
[1:50:06] Hallelujah you love
[1:50:08] him hallelujah oh my there is a restored
[1:50:13] hope and one of these days this is why
[1:50:15] then when we're looking look this is why
[1:50:17] you ought to be looking for the coming
[1:50:18] of the
[1:50:19] Lord this is why look you say well well
[1:50:22] here I am in church when you come to
[1:50:23] church you ought to be looking for him
[1:50:24] to come you ought to expect him to come
[1:50:27] right where you're
[1:50:28] at when you get up in the morning you
[1:50:30] ought to be expecting his coming it may
[1:50:32] not be the Corporal coming but you're
[1:50:34] expecting his coming you see if you're
[1:50:36] in living in expectation for his coming
[1:50:38] then you're looking for his coming and
[1:50:40] you'll recognize his coming when he'll
[1:50:42] come and say hey don't go that way turn
[1:50:43] this way hey look at this hey you know
[1:50:45] what it is it's his
[1:50:47] coming we're a part of his
[1:50:50] coming it has restored a hope where
[1:50:54] Satan has wanted to take things and just
[1:50:56] literally rip it right out of the Church
[1:50:58] of the Living God could float right back
[1:51:00] in a Cove but let me tell you something
[1:51:02] you might have got buried beneath a
[1:51:04] complex you might have gotten buried
[1:51:06] beneath all of those things but God
[1:51:08] didn't forget about the Cove you're in
[1:51:11] God knows right where you're at you've
[1:51:13] always been a part of his word and God
[1:51:17] himself has sent his word to find you
[1:51:20] and seek you out he sent his word to
[1:51:23] heal them this word has come to bring
[1:51:26] healing to our
[1:51:30] lives what is it it's the Breath of
[1:51:35] God gyrus fear not right remember what I
[1:51:40] said to you I'm come your daughter shall
[1:51:45] live right he's I keep my word I keep my
[1:51:50] appointments I keep my my word you see
[1:51:53] you see what it's about you you see what
[1:51:55] the Lord Jesus was doing he took his
[1:51:58] Focus off of his fear and put it on the
[1:52:01] word because if you focus on yourself
[1:52:04] there's
[1:52:06] fear are you hearing me this birth this
[1:52:09] first birth what does it do it produce
[1:52:11] fear it produce
[1:52:17] unsettlers you and I back to the promise
[1:52:19] of the Living God is that right It
[1:52:21] Centers us right back that's why brother
[1:52:24] Ram says I learned he said as a young
[1:52:26] Christian he said as a young Christian
[1:52:27] he said there were times he said the
[1:52:29] devil could beat me all around the stump
[1:52:31] on my feelings he said finally he said I
[1:52:33] come to a place to recognize I have met
[1:52:35] God's requirements by his word and I'm
[1:52:38] standing right there
[1:52:42] am and he goes into the
[1:52:45] house and when he goes into the
[1:52:47] house there's
[1:52:49] laughter he said se's not dead she
[1:52:56] sleepeth the Bible said those who were
[1:52:58] in the house they turn from
[1:53:01] mourning I don't know I've been to a
[1:53:04] funeral here in the states of course I
[1:53:05] ain't been everywhere but I ain't never
[1:53:07] heard mourning like I did when I that
[1:53:09] man got shot in front of us in Honduras
[1:53:11] and people started Gathering and wailing
[1:53:12] and the mour and I've never experienced
[1:53:14] that maybe they do some of that in
[1:53:16] Puerto Rico and Costa Rica and other
[1:53:17] countries maybe in Africa I but I've
[1:53:20] never experienced it here
[1:53:22] but that morning then when he said
[1:53:26] that she's only sleeping they laughed
[1:53:29] him to
[1:53:31] scorn that's so good so you know what
[1:53:33] Jesus did Jesus didn't sit down and say
[1:53:36] here I'm going to convince you
[1:53:40] nope he just simply said get
[1:53:45] out sir get out yes sir what was he
[1:53:49] doing he was putting anything out that
[1:53:53] was Rising its head against the word
[1:53:55] coming in
[1:53:56] fulfillment that's what you've got to do
[1:53:58] in your life you've got to go right over
[1:54:00] to the door and the good man of the
[1:54:03] house faith will open the door and say
[1:54:05] get
[1:54:07] out get out you're not welcome here hope
[1:54:10] nobody's
[1:54:14] outside be me news anchor out
[1:54:18] there but you understand what I'm saying
[1:54:21] sometimes we let too many laughters stay
[1:54:24] in our mind we let too many scorners
[1:54:26] stay in our
[1:54:28] mind we receive the promise of God and
[1:54:30] then we walk out of here with a promise
[1:54:32] of God in our heart we begin to water
[1:54:34] and then all of a sudden the enemy wants
[1:54:36] to raise up and mockery and laughter and
[1:54:39] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:54:41] knock the confidence out of your life
[1:54:43] that God has put in your life in a
[1:54:47] service put them out that's what you got
[1:54:49] to do you got to put them out right how
[1:54:52] do I put them out sometimes you got to
[1:54:54] break the associations you're
[1:54:56] around you can't expect you can't expect
[1:54:59] Faith to build and accumulate if you're
[1:55:01] fellowshipping with people who don't
[1:55:03] believe it that's how sicknesses return
[1:55:07] come on friends God can deliver you of
[1:55:09] bitterness and grudges and resentment
[1:55:12] and all sorts of things in this service
[1:55:14] physical conditions but you get around a
[1:55:16] bunch of unbelievers that don't believe
[1:55:18] it it'll come right back
[1:55:22] come on you saying I should quit my job
[1:55:24] that's not what I said at all I'm
[1:55:26] telling you don't be a partaker of them
[1:55:28] you don't got to fit in with them you
[1:55:30] weren't meant to be a part of this world
[1:55:32] you are a part of God before the
[1:55:34] foundation of the world you can try to
[1:55:37] fit into the world now as soon as the
[1:55:39] next another person comes along they'll
[1:55:41] dump you and kick you to the curve cuz
[1:55:43] they don't care about you but there's
[1:55:45] one who cared so much for you that he
[1:55:48] left the portals of glory and he shed
[1:55:50] his blood and he sent back the Holy
[1:55:52] Ghost and is knocked Faithfully on your
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:55:57] heart that's right he Peter James and
[1:56:02] John Glory faith hope charity
[1:56:10] yeah Jesus you think we need a crowd
[1:56:13] nope all I need is faith hope
[1:56:16] charity wherever two or three AG greed
[1:56:23] Jesus don't need a crowd to do
[1:56:25] anything he only needs to surrender
[1:56:28] there's only a surrender he took a
[1:56:29] little lad's lunch and multiplied it am
[1:56:33] he can take what little faith you have
[1:56:34] the brother the prophet said the little
[1:56:35] faith you had to bring you to the house
[1:56:37] of God he said you put her in his hands
[1:56:38] and watch what he'll do with
[1:56:43] it and he spoke to
[1:56:48] her Tabitha he spoke to her
[1:56:54] Arise My Daughter
[1:56:57] arise and he took the maiden by the hand
[1:57:02] and she
[1:57:04] arose and you know the prophet he would
[1:57:07] preach that same text many times but
[1:57:10] when he preached the first time proving
[1:57:12] his word in
[1:57:14] 1964 he said this text has a spiritual
[1:57:18] application of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:57:21] in this last
[1:57:23] days when he was on his way it looked
[1:57:27] like all hope was gone but when he comes
[1:57:30] in the room
