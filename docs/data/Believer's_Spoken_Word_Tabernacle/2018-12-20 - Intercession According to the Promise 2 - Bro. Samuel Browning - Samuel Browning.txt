servants Lord that you would speak Lord and hear through us Lord we pray O God we ask in Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen you're loving tonight amen let's turn in the Book of Numbers chapter 14 and we want to read verse of scripture their beginning verse 11 numbers 14 verse 11 and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be err they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make a V a greater nation and mightier than they and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people and I might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before him by daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar fire by night now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou has spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation pardon I beseech the the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now they god bless the reading of his word bless you as you're being seated I'd like to continue to speak here to you tonight and see if we get finished with this thought of it or not but intercession according to the promise and when we look at how that God has always he's made a promise in his word and you think of how each of the the promises that God has made it all with within it as brother Branham would express it that the Bible itself holds within it one one great goal that God is desiring to achieve and when we look at this and we see how that all of this many of these promises were were in type that would speak of the spiritual journey and when we look at this you know I look at how that God would speak to Israel in this time and here you find Moses sees he's interceding on behalf of of the promise that God has made and I look at this in terms of when we go to the book of Deuteronomy and I'm not going to read from there tonight but you remember in Deuteronomy 9 where we read from last week where Moses rehearses this and recalls this in the very presence of the new generation those who are going to God is going to take them into the land and he finds this necessary to rehearse to them that you're standing here because of the mercy of God you're not standing here because that you are some great people or that you are worthy but you're here tonight because of God's mercy and that's exactly the reason that we're here tonight we're here because of God's mercy if it wasn't for the mercy of the Lord we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for God's mercy that would even move across our pathway and would bring conviction to our hearts and draw to him we wouldn't be here because it never has been man seeking God but God has sought you and I out and so when Moses would let this be known in Deuteronomy 9 that I've prayed for you and I went up and I prayed again and to think about it that Moses continued there time and time again through the scriptures where he would move and pray for the people of Israel according to the promise that God had made and we think of this when you look at this promise here as we read from it tonight the promise was declared already in the mind of God it was already then when it was uttered to Abraham then after a hearing is uttered to Abraham it's revealed personally to Moses his part in it it's vindicated and when God the whole time when God had this in his mind as a great display of redemptive work of his of his mercy in of his love God already knew there would be a mixed multitude he already knew that but that was not what God was focused on was the mixed multitude but you know God already knew that there was gonna be those that would disbelief he knew that there would be those that you know would would not believe but the promise was not made with unbelievers or make believers in mind the promise was made with the believer in mind it was made in with the believers to whom that would be the vessels that God would actually prove the faithfulness of his word that he keeps his promise to think of it of how that even you know Moses would bring this to their attention that this journey that you have been on in the wilderness here when he would speak of it in Deuteronomy 8 that God has brought you through this time to Humble thee to let you know that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he went on to say that this whole time has been to declare what has really been in the heart all along and I just would like this that it wouldn't have mattered with all the circumstances that arose within this whole journey it would not matter how many circumstances would rise it would not matter how many would disbelieve it wouldn't matter one bit when it come to that well the elect who are ordained to take that land and to take that promise there wasn't enough Devils of unbelief there was not enough that could hinder that promise come to from coming to pass me just say it like this God is going to and he is fulfilling his word you see when we look at this of how that Moses himself here he is you remember as we looked at this last week a very important point that Moses when the first discouragement came up when there in Egypt when he slew the Egyptian and there his brethren begin to question him and said you know what what are you going to do are you going to do to us what you did through the Egyptian he ran and he fled he did not have the courage that was needed and let me tell you this right here courage is not about just what we can recite and what we know but it courage to be able to stand on God's Word even when you don't know what comes next and even when everything looks so bleak and even when things are not turning out like you thought they would because when Moses was down in Egypt when he went back after he met God and God had revealed himself and vindicated the promise to him remember when he went down there the people themselves began to look at the situation and remember they were told you're going to have to gather the towel for bricks you're gonna have to and you're gonna have to maintain an exact amount of bricks you're making remember the people at that time I want you to watch this the people at that time rose up and they made complain against Moses and said why in the world did you come back down here look what kind of a trouble that you brought up on our lives but Moses did not run in that time instead what Moses did he went to the Lord God that he had met personally there the one who had made the promise known to him and even though in Moses comes to God and he says Lord he said what you have told me concerning this promise and concerning these people Lord God you said that you would deliver them that's why you sent me down here you see what Moses was looking at it wasn't happening maybe exactly how Moses thought it would happen but it did not deter him from going back to the Lord God and saying Lord you sent me down here you see Moses knew this was not mama that sent him there it was not just something he read he wasn't just there with a quote but he was there with the Lord God and he knew that he had met God and though that things were not happening the way that he thought they should and listen now even when the people themselves rolled up against him and said have you come back down here to make life hard have you come back down here to make it this way look at it if it would have been natural man Moses he would have just fled and run out of there but there was a greater absolute that was moving in his life and that absolute was what God had confirmed to him I have come down I'm sending you that the people themselves might come out of Egypt and be brought into the land of promise no questions you see what God promised he will fulfill it buh-bam tells us like this in the patriarch abraham he said when you have prayed concerning a promise of god he said you may not see one saying regarding that prayer being answered he said but what you don't see is that there's a grain of sand in that mountain that's already being moved and that grain of sand think of it a grain of sand is a testimony that the rest of that mountain is on the way I know tonight I'm preaching to people who feel like that sometimes where you feel like your prayers are not being answered you feel like you're praying and it don't seem like it's getting anywhere but remember in there in that realm and in that land that's unseen the Prophet called it like this he said there is a land called prayer and he said in that land called prayer is where the prayers themselves are gone before the throne of God and how times were the Prophet himself would stand there in the midst of that time and say I see you you were praying beside the bed and this is what you were praying let me tell you something that was more than a man that picked that up that was a living God who heard that prayer and when make it known to that person I heard what you were praying about your prayer itself you might have felt like it didn't touch the throne of God but I want you to know your prayer got through Daniel I want you to know I heard your prayer and those examples are brought to you and I that we can even be right now living in this time and how many times of things that you prayed in your prayer clothes that i prayed in my prayer clothes and had on my heart and the Spirit of God come right across this desk and call those things a house and minister to us just exactly what we have Nita and you know a man doesn't know that but you know that's God letting you know I heard your prayer I know what it is you're desiring I believe I'm preaching to people that still are needy aren't you I don't want the spirit of this a just said I got it all together that's the spirit that defies God that's a spirit that defies a trust and a reliance on him but you know there's a heart of a believer that says lord I need you Lord God I've got needs in my life and even when I feel like I'm on top of the mountain I still needs your Lord because there's a valley that's coming up because it's not the mountain that reduces the fruit it's the valley where the fruit is made known so we stand within this time and to think of how that in the midst of everything when Moses he entered in on behalf of these people and he began to pray that didn't start now this did not start just now it did not start there in the first part of Exodus when they made a golden calf it started even when Moses himself was brought back into contact with God and when it came back into contact with God remember he had lost the vision for the people he had forgot all about deliverance it was something he became occupied with the things that was all around him but once he met God who made the promised there was no way that Moses could get that promise off his heart he could not get it off his mind you will know why because he himself was identified with that promise and that same God who made the promise was now dwelling there and pulsating within the heart of Moses to where Moses had a heart for the promise of God promised to the people of God now once you think of me if somebody would have came and put their finger in your face and said you what in the world are you doing down here you're making things so hard on me look at what you're doing would you have had the Spirit of Christ within you to say you know what I'm gonna pray for you I'm gonna pray that God will help you or would you have just looked at the person and said an old unbeliever old make believer I'll tell you but you know what Moses didn't approach it that way if Moses would approach it that way you wouldn't be reading their Exodus you would not be reading numbers as a matter of fact Moses would not have been God's man for that hour because when God has a man that God would actually call and reserve to himself God will actually project his heart he will project his love his mercy he'll also project within that love and mercy is correction because when you love your children you don't just love them and look at and close your eyes and pretend everything they do is all right but you also correct them but nonetheless they're your children is that right you don't take your children and tear them down when they've done wrong but you look at them and you realize they need help I need to pray for him and I need to minister to what they have need of it maybe it's some Ministry of Correction maybe it's a ministering of mercy at that time but yet the Spirit of God will always give us what is needed in that moment and I look at this here with how that Moses himself has moved in to intercede according to the promise and I want to draw your attention right back here as we looked at it where in verse 17 where Moses asks God he's beseeching him in humility let the power of my Lord be great according his now has spoken saying now here Moses when he rehearses this back to God this is not just Moses rehearsing or citing something but it is something in that moment that the Spirit of Christ within him of what has been revealed remember this is the name of the Lord that's been revealed to Moses and so what Moses is putting back before God is his name his character his person his nature who has been revealed to him and so something that has just taken place here a situation arises and Moses is able to bring it before the throne of God and he says remember according to my word as you have said he's putting God's Word right before him the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy how many glad for that tonight you're glad for God's long-suffering of his great mercy and forgiving iniquity and transgression you're grateful for that and there's also another part of it and by no means clearing the guilty now probably none of us within us a boy I'm so glad with with that part right there but you see God himself within his word there is the part within it that when you look at this for at this scripture that set right here it is the very nature of God now many times it can only be certain attributes that people will look at take many of for example many of the church's denominational and what-have-you they will only look at a God of grace and the grace that they look at is really what Jude spoke up they've turned the grace of God into lasciviousness because when God's grace is really given forth His grace will actually bring about the necessary conditions in order for God to step in and fulfill his word grace is not letting you and I get by with sin grace is not that at all but grace is even where God's favor would come to you and I and tell us your own and help us to see where we're wrong and to call out sin because within the midst of that time he is also interceding for us according to the promise aren't you glad he is a faithful heavenly father he knows exactly how to move within our lives and how to bring correction when it's time to bring correction now watch how that when Moses himself he brings this unto the Lord and how that Moses goes on and says pardon I seach the the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now and notice in verse 20 and the Lord said I have pardoned according to thy word now look how this sustained adhere I have pardoned according to thy word but this wasn't Moses word this was God's Word but once God listened just like with everything else when God reveals his word and he makes that were known to the individual it now becomes your word it becomes what God has delivered to you in the book of Genesis chapter 3 where it speaks that the woman I'll give her a seed but the RAM tells us in the message oneness he said when God made that promise he said the woman has no seed he said but when God gave that seed to Mary it now is her seed you see when God has done something for you God moves for you then when you look within this right here this is not words that's been made up by Moses Moses is not altering listen to me now Moses is not altering the program of God he's not altering the plan of God this is perfectly in line with the plan and wisdom and will of God true intercession by the Spirit of God will never go according or not according to the Word of God true intercession will always work according to God's will you with me no matter how much we pray it's always got to be cording to God's will remember Abraham prayed let ishmael live before you that was not God's will God's Will was I'll establish my covenant with Isaac it wouldn't matter Abraham could have took a forty day fifty day 120 365 day fast and praying it would not have changed God's mind you see it's always of the Spirit of God will always come according to the Word of God so there is an assent session that's according to the promise so here is Moses he is interceding according to the word that God has previously revealed verse 21 but as true as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord now here is God's promises I mentioned to you last week this promise carries clear over into the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and their earthly bride God is letting it be known that my word will not be defeated what I have spoken it shall perform that word it's going to be fulfilled the earth shall truly as truly as I live I say does he live tonight he ever liveth to make intercession this was not a priest who entered and who dies and then another High Priest comes in this high priests he died once and he's alive tonight he's there on the throne of God he's there to make good on every single promise that God has made you realize he's there even interceding on our behalf tonight to think of it you and I standing here in a steadfastness and faithfulness and even if there's something that's wrong he's standing there to intercede even where you feel like you're lacking strength he's there to intercede you let me tell you something he's just not a hot breeze interceding for all of our faults and our failures and our mistakes let me tell you something he's interceding that that word might come to pass in our life that the word as it strikes our heart we say Lord be it unto me according to my word he's there to intercede on his behalf of his word I'm glad for that tonight you see there's a word of discernment I want you to think of this here for a moment there's a word of discernment you believe God's words a discerner yes God's word it's precise so it's an intercession that's according to the promise it's a Living Word that sent forth to discern and separate and to think of this to be able to look into the midst of the people and see those whom the Lord has chosen do you realize when all of the Maltz and the mixed multitude and even with all that was down in Egypt before the mixed multitude came out you realize that God was able to look down there and then with within all of that right there and able to know who was really the chosen God was able to do that but yet we find how that here the word was given they all walk out as Paul records on first Corinthians chapter 10 all all did this all drink of the water in Iraq all all he goes in through all of that but yet within the midst of it the promise is made with that of the seed in mind now to think of this of how that God would say this in verse 22 notice because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness you see there was nothing that these men could say and say well you know God did that back in Egypt but he ain't done nothing now no there was no excuse not to believe that God was able to fulfill his word God had brought them through different pathways through different circumstances where it had to be the power of God it had to be miraculous it would be the same God what he did in Egypt would make himself known in the wilderness you know that's a good thing that no matter where it is that God is still God you know God is able to be just as much God in your home he's able to be just as much God in in your life he's able to be just as much God when you're standing there in the workplace as he is right here tonight it's cording to how our faith will either allow him to be or it'll limit him to be I'm telling you to a believer when our hearts are in tune with God God will show up anywhere anytime when there's a believer that is there you believe that I'll tell you I'm grateful for that tonight because it doesn't matter that we're but it matters that Blair we're looking to the Lord now look at this here and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice surely what's this they shall not see the land which I swear to their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit in him what's this discernment now what God is looking and the discernment is where the rest of them did not hearken to his voice he's looking at the discernment that they tempted him 10 times but at the same time he's able to look and see within Caleb's life and he identifies Kayla with one of the highest compliments my servant Caleb he hath another spirit in him you see God is looking beyond the flesh this is what an intercessory word does a word of intercession is that what it's able to look to the depth of the heart and of the life aren't you glad tonight for a word that can look right down into the depth in the heart of your life aren't you glad tonight but the Spirit of God can look down into your heart where you yourself is looked at something in it smokes your heart and said Lord how did I fall into this trap or how did this come about Lord forgive me I should have said that like that aren't you glad that he looks upon the heart aren't you glad that he looks on the desire of your heart come on somebody because once the worshiper has once purged he had no more desire for sin no more conscience for sin remember when when sister Bruce was sitting there in the interview she was asking these great questions of the prophet and the Prophet told her he said it's the desire of your heart sister Bruce you see that's what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost this is exactly what the word sets forth it's what the prophet kept bringing us back to if any man love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him but when the love of God is in your heart and for my the love of God you love him you desire him it will absolutely smite your heart when there's something that's went wrong even when it comes to something you've looked at wrong maybe believed wrong but the Spirit of God on the inside we're bringing out you say thank your Lord forgive me Lord Jesus why because there is one who's able to discern and look to the depths of your heart aren't you glad I'm glad for a word of intercession that's able to look to the depths of our lives oma because he had another spirit in him and have followed me fully Caleb wasn't even in the land yet he didn't just go over into the land he went over and brought back a report but you see what God already looked at was he's obeyed me fully this is where the profit would bring it very clear to us that full obedience to the word guarantees us the token it's not a checklist I did this I did that I did that it's God looking into the very depth it's not me it's not the Prophet it's nobody it's no man that seals you and I it is the Holy Ghost himself it is that one that is clothed with the inkhorn that comes by and brings the ceiling upon our life is that right they covered in there in the book of ezekiel chapter 9 when it would seem like you know look in the sanctuary how that even that God would even mention there with that of that judgment angel passing through and he said I want you to begin with my house with my sanctuary so wasn't God just passing over sin but God comes and he deals with sin but you see there's those who actually are crying inside for the abomination but that's data that's on the wickedness that's done in the city now what I hope you understand this I'm not going to dwell on this too much tonight but it wasn't that they were crying out to God and saying Lord brother so-and-so such a sinner Lord I'll tell you Lord God so it's on such a world there's such a terrible person that was not that we made themselves would have been part of the smiting but you see there was a part within them that within their lives it was something about it thus wickedness the sin the abomination there was something where they were so separated from that by the desire of the love of God any type in their life right there that God could witness these people are the ones that are sealed and the rest of them go ahead and remove serious time in it you see it's a very serious thing regarding the sealing of the Holy Ghost so when we look at this God is able to bring the discernment that is needed and I want to reiterate this point the Lord will not forfeit his word he will not God will not walk away from his word there's things that God has put on hold when he put on hold when Sam took place in the garden now watch this now God did not look at it and say oh my goodness what's going to happen what's going to take place but you see within what has happened now it actually is permitted by God to wear that now the attributes of God better within God will actually display themselves but there actually will be a resuming of that seventh day God will not forfeit it but how that God is working his word working everything right along to bring it right back to the promise of his word it's the same way what God had promised with regarding to the house of Israel David sitting on the throne even though all the unbelief all the sin that had mounted over all the idolatry that had come about him but remember what God said I've not forgot my promise David will set my servant David will set upon the throne didn't mean they didn't get corrected they got corrected didn't mean judgment didn't come it did come but nonetheless God's not gonna forfeit his word listen to me now he will not step over his word remember the Prophet as we looked at this last week when brother Bram takes this regarding Moses and Moses throwing himself down in the breech on behalf of the people and how that God would look there he wasn't looking at a natural man but he's seen the love that Moses had for those people and what he saw as the prophet puts it in another place he saw the cross he saw Christ there displayed in Moses life he saw the heart for those people and so when you look within this of how that God will not step over his word remember Moses in there in Deuteronomy 9 he calls God's attention he said remember the servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he says look not to their stubbornness to their rebellion you see Moses didn't say nothing stubborn they in rebellion he acknowledged it they've got stubbornness they've got rebellion this is seen right here but Lord don't focus on that you see if God would have made that his focus there would have been no going forward but there's got to be someone there's got to be something that's able to turn their focus of God from the Burness and from the rebellion to the promise there's nothing that can do that but God's own heart within the life of Moses there that would actually turn the side let me tell you something the very spirit of God in you and I tonight when you're born of the Spirit of God you might make mistakes and you do you might have faults and you do y'all have failures but let me tell you something if it was not for the Holy Ghost on the inside that identifies you and I under the blood cell every one of us would be killed tonight if it wasn't for the mercy of God let me tell you when you look at it concerning this earth and to think of it that even has the Prophet himself would stand there and look on that little lady in the condition that she was in remember in that time that woman needed a lot of help she didn't need criticism she was already beat down but what had to happen was the Spirit of the Prophet had to change on the inside was he right for standing there as far as looking at sin sin is sin sin should never be blessed God never blessed us in God will always judge sin but the very heart and spirit of the Prophet actually had to be changed to that of intercession and how did God do that by showing him that of this earth and the blood and the bumper of blood and every time that you went to do wrong you would have been killed but the bumper of blood was still there you know he's speaking to his prophet and his prophet once he can get his spirit right and into the spirit of the intercessory then he can actually go and minister to the woman in the right way with the heart of love see the spirit of intercession didn't say forgive me you know you know you were dressed so sleazy and you know just go ahead God loves you know that one the spirit of intercession so you see the spirit of intercession it's not criticism that's all you want that won't allow the Spirit of God to move criticism actually what was criticism causing it to do bring judgment down how can you stand to look at this world I've got a little girl I what about me and mine she the Prophet right now look at that spirit of criticism it had already drew his family that his family was the only one righteous who but the Spirit of God showed up faithful to his word aren't you glad that he shows up faithful to his word when you and I've been in the wrong humor we've looked at things wrong but the Spirit of God said come here let's have a little conference here and you know instead of me just flat-out telling you you're wrong I'm just gonna show you a little something in my word I'm gonna show you and what does they do God you miss has confidence in his word that his word will actually bring discernment into the very heart of the believer because the word is sharper than any two-edged sword it piercing dividing asunder the bone from the morrow it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that word itself will move down there in the depths of our life and put it into perspective and say lord help me forgive me Lord my attitude won right Lord my thought about this wasn't right what's he doing he's projecting his heart of mercy not that it would allow that individuals to stay in the condition but it's got to be as heart of intercession come for the people in order to minister even better judgment God will not step over his word he won't step over his word and I I want to say like this is like a two-fold part of that when you see God won't step over his word he couldn't step over Moses you take me Lord my name out of the book don't you block theirs you block mine out he put himself in the way of God's wrath and there's a two-fold meaning I look at this where God will not step over his word God himself he's not going to cross it neither is he going to alter it if God has to alter his word then he's not able to fulfill what he spoke he's not going to step over it he's not all of a sudden looking at the conditions and saying no mercy look where the people are at how do you know what let's just forfeit this word let's just abort mission but you see what God has promised remember body is like you and I we are watching the word become material in our lives you and I have never remember we bypassed off the often e we bypassed that and came down into this body of time to be tested and tempted in here are we being formed to the image of the word you and I do not know everything as far as knowing it's by faith we believe in what God has revealed and done with in our life and we walk not by side we walk by faith and you and I sometimes we can not see all of these things but yet within it God Himself already sees the end from the beginning let me tell you something God never brought you and I alone because all of a sudden he decided to come down and save us that's not the predestinated plan of Almighty God but God already foresaw us he foreknew us he predestinated us our destiny is a sure thing in Christ now you and I are coming there's enough folding it continues to be unfolded in our life God's not going to alter his word but and what God does he provides the needed grace in order for the condition to be right to fulfill it so that it all comes back then no flesh control in his presence Lord you know I took your word and I brought myself in the condition that's you you got glory but it is not all listen its grace that is released from God to bring about the necessary condition no wonder the headstone coming in this hour it's crying under the Church of the Living God grace grace unto it you realize it's a voice the word coming with correction the word coming interceding on our behalf you recognize what it brings about it brings about a lady and elect lady it brings about miss grace it brings about that lady who desiring to line up with the word and that her life would be tailored to that word that's what grace does if not for grace you and I would be swept along with the rest of it but grace itself has stepped in for you and I why did grace step in because that we were a good people I don't think so grace stepped in because God made a promise he made a promise to himself and that's exactly what God told Israel in Deuteronomy 7 God has not chosen you because you were some people you know a great people but God chose you because he loves you and he swore by an oath to your fathers of what he himself was going to do you see this bring us pretty good straight God is obligated to his word hey man that's where you and I have to know am I in that word and that word in me if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done oh my you see prayer changes things I mean just I'm just gonna skip some things here prayer really changes things when you look at how you know brother Branham refer to this over and over you talked about Moses you know being pastor Moses and he talked about how you know brother brand will take that attribute within there of how that Moses was able to put up with all the fusses of the people was able to put up with all of those things and the times of them questioning and the complaining along the journey and you look at how that within it here if Moses was able to intercede according to promise I hope you understand that we're not lifting Moses up we're lifting God up because Moses himself the Scriptures are recorded he crumbled before it one natural man standing in right here this is God that's got ahold of his heart Moses could not get away from this promise if he wanted to because this is God's heart this was not a burden that Moses drummed up it's not something that Moses went instead heed but it was a burden that dropped in Moses heart for those people to see that word fulfilled I want you to think of this for a moment I want you to think of this I've thought about this for months now you think of how that after everything has taken place where you were here all the chatting all the times that they've come to him and then even when it comes to that place to where they reject going over into the land and then even when they start out the next day and start to go up and say well we're going to go on up to the land we realize we sinned and disobeyed against God and they're in greater if they're even and further disobedience you look at how within this time Moses did not know it was not revealed to him that we're gonna be in that land for forty years it was not revealed to Caleb we're gonna be here for forty years but I want to drop a little something to you you think they weren't disappointed a little bit you know with me tonight I guarantee you they were disappointed I guarantee you they were disappointed but there's had to be listen to me there had to be that of where they nurtured on the very promise by the Spirit of God through where they wouldn't allow bitterness to come up in against the people who they saw every day in the camp and even those who had went along with others who had actually spoke outright and those who had actually assimilated with that and said well yeah we can't go up and they had tried as well they had to actually go out and get manna with them same people they had to get water with them same people no doubt they might have said across the same table but they had to be able to look at those people listen to me now and not sit there with bitterness in their heart and say I'll tell you what if you hadn't done this look what we would have been if you they would have never ever went any further but if I can actually do a little quantum leap here tonight when they actually came in the land showing that Caleb himself had actually been so occupied with the promise of God sure what's he disappointed in what was happening absolutely sure he was discouraged that they themselves did not move into the promise but Caleb could say God made the promise and whether it's 20 30 40 50 God is going to fulfill his word and I don't care what I'm on what kind of shape I'm in God said I would be there in that land it didn't matter do you realize how much that Caleb occupied himself in the midst of all that unbelief that was in the camp he was able to instruct his children his daughters to wear his daughter's knew the law of inheritance he could not have had bitterness you talking about the grace of God they did not even have the Holy Ghost like we have it but he did have another spirit in him you think about Zola Fayette and all the rest of them that stood true to the word and the different ones Joshua how they would stand there this is why I'm trying to say to you tonight that Moses you think they weren't tempted to be bitter to be against Mohammed man here we are out in the winters do you think they weren't tempted you think listen friends it's a lot easier to look at every negativity around you and look at all that and say I'll tell you if this one that way and if this church is better here and if this was here and if this was here you're not drawing the Friends of God to your life but in this and friends many times God will allow things to happen he'll allow circumstances to come up to test you to see what is really in your heart he'll allow it to be exposed he'll allow greenness to come out he'll allow that testing time it's not taking God by surprise it takes you and I by surprise but it's in this time but we live a life of intercession on behalf of our children if Caleb would not have lived on the intercessory life think of what his home would have been like I'll tell you them people lord have mercy why couldn't they have taken the land couldn't they have done you see what kind of hold me to have him for no more they would have been the righteous but you see God already seen what kind of spirit was in him it was an intercession according to the promise so intercession isn't just what we pray but an intercession is even how that we live our lives in faith according to the promise no doubt setting right here brother kress I think of different ones that you know you you you you live during the time when they've people were writing off the rapture is gonna be in 1977 and all these other like that and truly you know what you know no doubt many would have been happy for that but you know what I want in yet and he can't come off that intercessory seat until every name's been splashed he can't come off of there you say why did the Prophet bring that out there but the days of intercessory is over that is looking at the at hand friends we're living in the time right now that this word that's been spoken it's identified what's been down through time and it's time for you and I had to recognize we're at the end time and know tonight that once that last name has been expressed on earth and that name has been manifested splash underneath that Clorox bleach that intercessory seat becomes a judgement seat and when he himself changes the road of a priestly robe when he changes his robe you and I get our Road change as well our change will match the change that's went on in heaven but right now he's a faithful intercessor aren't you glad for them so it looks so bleak no doubt to the eye of Moses my momma now look how the here Moses Moses when he prayed that prayer we read there in numbers 14 Moses prayed but even that God not only would show the greatness of his mercy but also how that God would actually bring correction separation that God would forgive iniquity and transgression long-suffering sonja's mercy and by no means clearing the guilty to see how that God Himself can look down to the depths and his word be able to separate who is guilty and who's not I'm glad that he is the one who's in charge of that tonight I'm glad that's not left up to me I'm glad it's not left up to you because no doubt you were to wrote me off maybe I were to wrote you off we could have wrote off a lot of other people but let me tell you something what matters is it's where our name is in God's book it matters where that God himself and how that he is working in dealing in our life let me tell you something friends don't you write nobody off I don't care how bad it looks I don't care how bleak it looks it might look like they're going completely plumb the opposite way but remember there is a promise that you're able to hold up before the throne of God you don't have to worry about you're not the one who can make them see or the one who can make them this or make them that or make them that that's already been determined but what you can do is pray for them and lift their name before the throne of Almighty God here's Moses now let's look at this and numbers 21 let me just try to come down here here's Moses the people now in verse 5 here they journey verse you know from first few verses of this chapter one a great battle then here they come across the way that then during journeying and they're discouraged verse five says the people speak against God and against Moses sure not their man we'd have been cutting them out right wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loveth this like bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee now what's this they're acknowledging their sin you see the fiery serpents set loose who look and say oh my goodness this serpents that were sent loose but if them serpents hadn't been set loose and bitten them and there were some of them that died there had never been this response of repentance we have sinned they're brought to a place Omaha we've sinned because we've spoke against the Lord and against thee notice what they asked pray unto the Lord that he'd take away the Serpent's from us and Moses said you're the one that's done it you're the one to phrase how many times has Moses prayed for him even when they've asked for other things quail and other things Moses went and prayed for him oh god I hope we can really see this in the depth tonight Moses never washed his hands he couldn't it was a promise that was there he couldn't get focused on the mixed multitude there's a seed in there they meant there's a bride that's coming forth and Moses prayed that word prayed means to intervene interpose pray to meditate and mediate to intercede Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said to Moses watch this now this intercessory prayer and the Lord said unto Moses make me a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that of a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived here God showing the very offering up of the true atonement of the Lord Jesus I want to watch this brother Ram takes this in the message in sign and he asked he poses a question he says how he says when Moses he's interceding for the people he said why did Moses intercede and brother Ram jumps immediately to Genesis 22 how there was a ram that was provided for Abraham and he goes into this there's a crucial moment he says to where even though Moses was learned in all the wisdom of all of Egypt you you think he didn't know about snakebites he knew about snake bites come on now sand snakes were not toys in Egypt then when they were symbols they were prescient there but you see it wasn't wisdom of Egypt it wasn't natural wisdom that could take it away but that pillar of fire that angel of covenant that had brought him out he was that one that was there that cloud by day that killer fire by night he was the one who Moses would look to and Moses would receive what was needed for the people at that moment and here in the midst of the time when the people were dying when their poison itself was moving in and lives were being taken at that time here Moses steps in and begins to pray on behalf of the people let me tell you something this was not a people who deserved prayer they didn't deserve intercessory prayer you and I don't deserve intercessory prayer they didn't deserve it but nonetheless here the heart of God moving forward it prayed and it brings to hoga genre on the scene what is needed in that moment to provide for them one who's able when they can look to him look and live in their faith lunes what they would have to do they would actually have to believe that what God had told that prophet but when you look for her to that brace and serpent not just look on it but by faith you look at that and you realize that sin is already judged they had to be able by faith to look at that let me tell you something that's exactly the what God calls to the heart of each and every one of us tonight it's represented that sin was judged and it was met in the Lord Jesus Christ for whatever the need is in our life he already provided for you and I when you and I did not married it did not deserve that but God Himself interceded for you and me on our behalf and watch this here this is in the camp of Israel you with me now this is in God's camp here comes a man by the name of Balak and he calls up Balaam and he takes Balaam to a place as the Bible says in numbers 22 41 and he took Balaam you know this is all positional it was where he wanted to take Balaam Balak knew where to take him he knew what pewter said in and how to point it out to him you with me he knew how to look things out this was position it wasn't no one you just stay wherever you want to stay he took him up so that he would look at the uttermost parts of Israel better you know Balaam himself said I can't say nothing but what God puts in my mouth because God already told him I'm gonna put it in your mouth and you're gonna say even though you're here by your own self-will and permissive will but you're gonna say what I put in your mouth to say do you realize even though that Balak was determined to curse Israel it might look like they deserved a good old cursing come on somebody it looked like they deserved a good old cursing you think Bailey would have brought Balaam up there and said curse them if it didn't look like that man for sure they'll be cursed but you see when you get to looking at it there that there was a shout of the king in the camp there was that where that brazen serpent was raised within the camp and when the God began to move and he spoke there through Balaam you find there that in verse 8 of Numbers 23 here he goes how shall I curse whom God hath not cursed how shall I defy whom the LORD hath not defined for from the tops of the rocks I see him and from the hills I behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nation there are separated people are you with me this is what God is seeing I hope you're with me now just just a few chapters before now just a few chapters move out of the way Moses I'm gonna take them all I'm gonna diss Herot every one of them I'm gonna send a pestilence among I'm gonna slay every one of them that was just a few chapters ago uh-huh who can count all of this who can count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like this god it's not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent I find this so intriguing that this is mentioned right here don't you I find it so intriguing has he said and shall he not do it see he's not going to alter his word he will fulfill his word oh my shall not make a good behold I have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it it didn't matter what Balak wanted to be done Balak could have sucked and said you see this you see that this is wrong and that is wrong and this is wrong and that is wrong but do you realize here that when they're looking down this is not how Balaam sees them it's not how Balak Caesar it's how God sees them the Lord Jesus OMA hath he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob remember just two chapters ago what we just read he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob you see God's Word what God measures out for the time it ain't just the covering he means business there were people who walked in obedience who had repented and when they looked at that serpent that brazen serpent and they lived by faith right there they were identified with in that word and therefore when God would look down notice he hath not beheld iniquity and Jacob neither hath II seen perverseness and Israel the Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them God brought them out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel what hath God wrought behold the people shall rise up as a great line and lift up himself as a young line he shall not lie down until they eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain but we could go on and on because the prophecy keeps coming clear into the 24th chapter over into the Masonic Kingdom maybe these were people that had come out of Moses loins maybe God had just wiped all of them out and now he had a group of perfect people maybe he just perfect people all of those that in previous chapters they were all gone how could it be that God could say I've not even beheld iniquity in Jacob how could it be because God is looking at the atonement in the camp God's looking at the atonement in the camp I'll tell you what you can take a great lesson from this right here when you begin to look at this and realize that though our state Israel state it required discipline you with me it required discipline but you know what against all the enemies God is for us if God be for us who can be against us it didn't matter of all the curstyn they wanted to do God was four it doesn't matter if all the shortcomings this and that God is for us amen if God be for us then who can be against us now let me close on this plane God's faithfulness his intercession Balaam comes along and he realizes he's not gonna be able to curse them you can't curse them God's already blessed them I don't care how hard you try you ain't go to cursing but he realized gods look at this he is bringing them to a place God will be forced to deal with them according to his word you see Satan's deceptiveness to invite them into this feast here in numbers 25 numbers 24 25 of how that when the feast came of Bal peor and inviting them in and realized what had taken place there of how that when they should have never mixed up there the sons of God Israel should have never went up there into the camp but when they got up there in the camp all the dancing and everything that had taken place and was going on that lusts rose in their heart and then you find of how that when God spoke to Moses here's intercession now he speaks to Moses at that time and he says I want you he said to take the numbers 25 for I want you to take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the Sun that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel you say that don't sound like intercession it is every time every time when Israel had disobeyed there was always blood that was shed there was those that was that was slew at the base of the mountain there who's on the Lord's side let him come over here there was blood that was shed each time it was to do away with those who had actually sinned against God see God won't clear the guilty God's able to see to the depth and see the separation that's a word of discernment notice this he goes on to say to the judges in verse 5 slay you every one of his men that were joined unto Baal peor and then verse six and one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianite us woman in the side of Moses and the side of all the congregation of the children of Israel what disrespect you see what sin did it came so disrespectful he got to such a place to where they felt like they could bring it right in the camp that was disrespect come on friends you know there's a time when we look at things and for the mercy of Almighty God I can have mercy on somebody that's the first time coming to the house of God second time third time and what-have-you I can have mercy until God and seeing how God will move and bring it well how God will direct it in my heart and in your heart as well but to see that we're that we would actually allow the congregation of the Lord to be disrespected and called that the love of God that ain't the love of God that's compromise that's compromise they brought it right in the sight let me tell you something we're tested you'll be tested are you gonna allow sin to come in your midst will you allow sin to come around your life or will you just sit back and say well we're just so full of love let me tell you something the love of God is not powdered sugar the love of God is not easy queasy the love of God will stand him on God's Word he intercedes with great faithfulness if you don't tell him who will no glory in the sight of Moses in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and when Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stay from the children of Israel and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand and the Lord spake unto Moses saying phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priests have turned away my wrath from the children of Israel while he was Arius for my sake among them that I consume not the children of Israel in my Zaius my jealousy we're for say behold I give unto Him my covenant of peace and he shall have it his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel every disobedient through the exodus through numbers there was blood that was shed God let him know that I have bought you I have laid nations in order to bring you to myself I spoiled all of Egypt and purchased you to myself blood makes a purchase an atonement he made an atonement for the children of Israel let me read it out of Psalms 106 I'm closing they joined themselves and also in the Belfiore and they the sacrifices of the dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague break in upon them then stood up Phineas and executed judgment you know what this word judgment is it's the same word Moses prayed unto the people unto God for the people it's one who intervenes one who mediates one who intercedes on their behalf if this had not been purged out of the camp they all would have died but you see sin cannot be in the camp God will not permit sin to be left in the camp he'll bring it right across if you don't take care of it Iran will bring that javelin right down to where you're sitting he'll bring it across what brother Samuel you are not be sparing people let me tell you something we ought to value his presence more than we value our feelings we ought to value the promise of God more than we value well I'm afraid I'll hurt my son I'm afraid I'll hurt my daughter I'm trained I'll hurt this we ought to be mindful and say Lord I don't want to hurt you this is intercession friends intercession that goes along and Pat's people on the back is not intercession it's like providing tour guides to hell intercession stands up according to the promise even when you look at situation sometimes brother Branham would tell us all through the message and not just brother Branham it's right there in the scriptures this is where he's drawing it from and Titus and Timothy and he would speak about godly sisters helping the other younger ones he would speak about the older brothers helping the other ones remember you can't do it with criticism brother you can't do it with criticism sister you've got to have the right heart Phineas did not have a heart of criticism here it was none of them I'm gonna run it down that's not what this was God would not have accepted it his zeal was for the Lord God and that's what our seal has to be is for the Lord God when our seal that's what Moses seal was for this is what intercession was according to the promise it was according to the Word of God this is the kind of life I believe is worthy of the gospel I believe that don't you this is the kind of life that God would have us to live I believe that interceding according to the promise God ain't gonna let nobody no enemy is gonna put down his children you seen that that God said they're mine I know what they need I know what discipline they need and I'll correct him aren't you glad God don't leave correction up to everybody else but God Himself faithfully corrects us remember as many as I love Jason and I rebuke be zealous therefore and repent this is intercession according to the promise of Almighty God you love him tonight let's pray Lord Jesus oh my what your word is truly a Lord a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we see here Lord in your word intercession intercession it's not something Lord God where you close your eyes and you look at us like a grandparent that's not you you don't look at everything that we do oh it's perfect they can do no wrong no the Lord intercession according to the promise father to think Lord God the burden Lord that you placed upon Moses life it was a tight your prophet would place it two different places in the message and he would call it not the power of a prophet he called it in the message presuming watched the power of a believer Moses would throw himself in the way in other place he said what's the power of a saint before God or deceive a need had to be such a love in his heart we know Lord God but even how that Paul would write to us by the Spirit of
