bless you I prayed sorry to read a quote first that goes along with this song just really spoke to my heart what if they were that was in the token message 1963 what if you were had committed a crime and you were going to be tried in a federal court and you know that if they found you guilty that you were going to die you were going to be going to electric chair or the gas chamber whatever public execution they were going to have for you maybe hung or something lynched whatever the penalty was and you know that you were guilty and you know you were guilty and you must die if you don't get something some attorney to represent you that you can get out of the out of that thing and now you would want to have the best attorney that you could have and getting an attorney that was a good shrewd attorney you would feel that your case was a little could relax you could relax a little bit because you had an attorney but still there would be a question whether this attorney could change the judges idea or change the jury if this attorney which his shrewd speaking and the knowing of the laws could change that and could plead your case and prove that you should live but yet in all his great Authority in his great speech that he could make and the impression he could put upon the jury or have the judge you'd maybe you might get relaxed for a few minutes but still there could be a question in your mind can he do it but in this case the judge himself became our attorney God became man there was no attorney could do it but could we couldn't find one Moses and the law of the prophets nothing could do it so the judge both so the judge became both the jury attorney judge himself and took the Justice of his law in his own hands and paid the price for it himself how much more secure can we be and sent his own life back upon us as witness that he has accepted it how say I stood in the corner the judge turned my way it looks like you're guilty now what do you say I spoke up Your Honor I have no defense but that's when mercy walking oh mercy walked in and pleaded my case I call to the stand of God's saving grace the blood was presented that covered my sins Oh forgiven when mercy Walton I stood there in wonders how could this beat that someone so guilty had just been set free [Music] my chains they were broken I fell fall again the moments when mercy merci and pleaded my case called to the stance of God's saving grace the blood was presented that covered my Oh or given when mercy Walden I stood there and wondered how could this be that someone so guilty had just been set free all my chains they were broken I fell for again the very moments when mercy working merci one day he in my case and called to the stand of God's saving grace the blood one presented that covered my forgiven when mercy Walden the blood presented that covered my Oh forgiven when mercy walking [Music] [Applause] wonderful amen amen amen let's give it a hand and praise for its luck where's mercy and His grace well let us stand together as we it's the worst coming forth for us this [Music] and that's me way and as we pray not speak your word into our hearts and have your way one more time now we'll just have your way and your way holy spirit feel our heart and add your way and a sweet way [Music] and as we pray we pray speak your word in true love and you [Music] let's just

committed to you now for every need Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you if you would turn with me to Genesis 18 I want to just go right into this portion Scripture say it's good to be good to be back home and even though I'm only was only gone a service but I feel like I was gone an eternity and so we but I do want to say we certainly appreciated your prayers we had three services there and the Lord just really moved in a real special way I just had a wonderful just a wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit and we just thank God for that and so they asked me to greet you it's first time I ever been there was up in the eastern part of Canada and it seems like within the past a year and so I've been in Canada there quite a bit I was thinking about what brother Harold Hildebrandt said he said do not come to Canada and say you're going to the mission field he said because you're not Canada is not the mission field so those of you know brother Harold Hildebrand you know he would say things like that but you know it was I tell you it was a real real honor brother Ivan Carr is the pastor there brother Ivan's 89 years old but you wouldn't know it you met him you wouldn't know it sharpest and I'll tell you what he's got so much life and he preaches he keeps on he preaches at least you know they have during the week they have four services a week and and it's not just a few people show up though they every service the whole congregation is there it's tremendous and so you know they they let me know when we're gathering here you just preach the people love the word everybody comes and they expect to hear the word so you just preached so we I just wanted to bring greetings back to you from them maybe you might never get the chance to meet them on this side but we will on the other side amen there's a group of believers that are really pressing on there and my just and brother Carmen Mills for some of you that know him maybe some of you don't brother Carmen stands there as an associate so we just had a just a wonderful time there with the saints of God we want to look right into the word tonight and I'm just gonna read a few verses scripture out of Genesis 18 let's begin in verse 1 and the land the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre and he said in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw him he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground it said my lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you'd come to your servant and they said so do as thou ascend and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the heart and Abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he said Behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in a tent door which was behind him may God bless you bless the reading of his word you may be seated I want to just take this just for a few moments and and the part that I'd like to do without trying to cover so much ground very familiar ground but yet in in many of this here I just feel pressed to take it in this way as we look in the hour and the time of which we're standing I believe it's I believe it's always important we see down through the Scriptures where the people of God have always been a made aware of where they are standing in time and what God is preparing to do in that hour and you think of just that right there that in itself to know what God is doing in this hour and what is prepared in this hour and to be a part of that that's all the grace of God because for many to recognize and to see even to have come in contact with the ministry and the message that we have received yet to many it's not a message to many it's just a supernatural moving of God and they don't they didn't have not recognized of what God has done within this hour and to see that that is that is the grace of God that has come that has come to you and I and when you look at this within Abraham and to see the responsibility that where we stand in this time and we've been looking at the scriptures of where that how God taking out that of a Gentile bride and where that we stand in this hour in the very closing moments of time of God finishing up with the Gentiles and to see that all of this is rolled out within the Scriptures it's not just it's not just scriptures that are within the New Testament but it reaches back what is wrote in the new is only written from the prophecy there that even went forth from the Old Testament and yet many of the prophecies that we even look at and what we're reading here are things that are events that happened then but yet were prophetic of the hour and the time in which we're living in and it takes to open this for you and I within this hour and this time you know God could have opened these things and made it known to any generation in in a very special way that God reserved it in for this time because this time that you and I are living in is a time when the book itself has been taken by the Lamb and when the Lamb has taken the book remember he is he is claiming all that he has redeemed and through the taking of this book when the Holy Spirit now in its fullness comes in and takes a hold of that book he is revealing the very plan of redemption that has been all the way down through the scriptures even from that as we looked at in the life of Adam whether it was the mystery that was inside of Adam and yet here was Adam but yet within Adam was his bride and there had to come the the separation there had to come to sleep and the rest to where God could bring forth the bride and then present that to Adam and then we we look at this here within Abraham's life and we find that in Abraham being on a being on a journey and we find that where this would be in this moment I want to draw your attention here when we look in in the scriptures you notice that within all the times that God has spoke to Abraham the Bible has said many times that God appeared to Abraham he came to Abraham in lights and dreams and God also would come you know and make himself known there and as that in the in in the office of Melchizedek he would let him know that I am Melchizedek and then here in this time we we find that how that the Bible says in the opening verse that the Lord and capital L capital L capital R capital D this is the Lord Himself appearing and coming down to make himself known to Abraham and notice the scripture comes in and I I believe it's there within the third verse and it says and Abraham said my lord capital L lowercase old lowercase R lowercase D he is recognizing that here here is the Lord himself up hearing in flesh an Abraham when we you look at this within the scriptures here it's something that I believe that we can identify because Abraham in the previous chapter Abraham has just taken a hold of the promise of God and he's believing that promise of God remember God has just revealed himself to Abraham as El Shaddai I and Abraham you know as has taken that promise and and brother branham would say it like this he says when a real Christian can get a hold of a promise of God and believe it's for them that is the key right there when the believer can get a hold of the promise of God and believe it's for them you see this is think this is the thing to recognize that when God made the promise it's God made the promise with you as the believer in mind and so here how that he goes on to say and then that believer he's satisfied while he's nursing the strength all he said what a satisfaction of just knowing that God said so so here is Abraham sitting in his in his tent and you know to think of how that Abraham would be would be looking within his tent and brother branham would dramatize it in a manner you know that he said Abraham you know it must have been something that he lifted up his head and when Abraham lifted up his head he jumped up quickly and the Bible says here as we read in verse 3 that Abraham or verse 2 it said when Abraham saw those 3 men coming the Bible says he ran to meet them from the tent door it was something that that was within Abraham that arose that Abraham knew that there was something spiritual about these men it was something that caused Abraham to rise and Abraham to stand up and brother branham would say it like this he said it was the spirit in Abraham that told him go to them and to see says there's something about spirit-filled people that recognizes the presence of God and he goes on to say you know he's it's something about a spirit-filled believer that they must be he says magnetized to the Spirit of God because when you look at it it was not that they in the flesh looked any different from anybody any other stranger that had passed by the tent it wasn't by the way that they looked but it was that on the inside something that registered with Abraham that he ran to meet them and that was because the Spirit of God had alerted him that go and meet him he was magnetized to that and brother branham you know we would go on to say of how that you know Abraham sitting in that door he said he knew that there was something real and the spirit had declared it but you know he goes on to speak to us and let us know that he says how did he know that it's because he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time that's a real key to our lives is staying in a spiritual atmosphere that's the warfare that we face as a believer do you realize whatever the promise is that God has made Satan's objective is to try to trouble the atmosphere to hinder you from receiving the promise that God has for you and and you know you think when you you look at that brother Andrew Glover won't even see remember he preached on the overcoming opposition he opened up with the quote where you know different ones were praying for the Holy Ghost and about the time like Lois sister Lois Branham about the time she was getting ready to receive it you know her knees would start hurting or other things will start happening and brother brems says that is just satan they're trying to get your mind off of the promise even when brother Branham was going to go pray for a little Georgie Carter remember he couldn't find a place to kneel down he was being stuck with thorns here and there and finally brother BAM just said you know what I don't care no more I am just going to pray and seek God for this need so - racking naj that for us that staying prayed up it's something that not only are we to have a prayer life where we and our lives are off but a prayer life is not just something that's confined to this of a of a room or just being in our bedroom or or having a place yet I believe that that's important that we need to have prayer with God because in prayer that's where the secret of the mysteries are in prayer is where its submission comes in listen if you can really be honest tonight that's exactly what the devil wants to try to take he wants to try to take prayer because it's through prayer as it says in the book of Jude that we are built up our most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost not a--not if every one of us if every time that we prayed there was always you know the guarantee that we were going to enter in to the Spirit of God and my we were gonna free you know since the Spirit of God and be carried away you know it wouldn't probably be so much of a hard thing but many times or times when we do pray there's times when we don't feel anything there's times when we don't seem to have a very great spiritual connection but we realize that even in the midst of prayer when we are praying that he himself even though we don't feel him but we do have an audience with the king and that's where faith itself can stand there and we know that we're not just saying words out here but our heart is being poured out to the Lord and his word prayer you find that how that not just in that closed-off moment but even throughout the day the Bible says I would that men were praying everywhere lifting up holy hands is that right now when you look at that part of the scripture lifting up holy hands that refers to the banner of the word that God has given within this hour it's to lift up the hands like the hands of Moses were exalted when we are praying we are praying in the Holy Spirit we are lifting up the banner of the word the word that God has revealed to you and I we are to take that word pray over that word applying that word to our life meditate upon those things don't allow a service just to be something that we into and it's dismissed from your life if there's going to be things within this service as it is in every service you won't remember everything but there will be something that God will say personally to you that God desires that you would take pray over that water that and expect that to come to pass you see this is exactly what God made known to Abraham when you look in Genesis 17 the Bible here within this 17th chapter how much takes place so quickly in Genesis 17 Genesis 12 God calls Abraham he calls him a cause Abram in justification there are chapters that go by prior to Genesis 15 to where Abraham himself becomes sanctified gets all cleansed up from habits and everything else but you see listen now look from Genesis 12 to Genesis 15 what was it that brought Abraham to a place of sanctification it wasn't Abraham's work it was Abraham abiding in the grace of God under the love of God and God was working in Abraham's life to bring about what he had already spoken hey let's just be real God when God spoke to Abram the Bible's clear it's God that called him out of the ur account deeds it was God who said when Abram was in a condition still making idols still making other gods he had all sorts of habits and everything else about his life but God said I called you to be a father of many nations God already made the promise it had nothing to do with Abraham's works it had everything to do with God's grace so what we want to abide under is the grace of God not our works we want to let grace you see when there's grace that is fourth unit isn't it just trying to balance us out here you realize what grace is grace is not something where it is a demanding but grace is where you are relenting and submitting to what God is moving upon your heart and your life to do there might be things that you've got to pray about and you stand there upon god's word and there's times where god will bring your life to showdowns like he did with Abram and lot God brought a showdown to where the separation could take place but in all things it is God's grace moving in your life for him to perform his word through you and I because after it came out you know think about this now let me just preach for a few moments you think about it in Genesis 15 after the chapter of of sanctification where the blood has been shed now you look what takes place right after Genesis 15 in this journey here the very next chapter is Genesis 16 we're sorry I herself now think of this she operating there under that of sanctification she goes forth to try to bring forth the promise on her own works and it won't work it began with grace it's going to take grace you see when when Sarah I was working it looked like she's working in conjunction with the promise but in actuality she's becoming more stronger against the promise of God instead of resting and said I don't know I don't understand that but God said you're going to be the father of many nations I don't know how it's going to be but I'll join in with you and crazy but she took the works of the flesh and it produced an Ishmael there's still trouble with Ishmael today yeah well you see God he takes this now in Genesis 17 and the opening of this chapter now where they have come to a place of complete deadness and God speaks to Abraham in Genesis 17 and he lets him know here he says I'm the Almighty God he lets Abraham know they're in one of the opening verses and verse 4 my covenant is with thee is that right you see this is the return of the Holy Ghost in and the restoration of the gifts my covenant is with thee but then the very next verse verse five now here it comes no longer shall thy name be called Abram but thy name shall be called Abraham so now you have the return of the holy spirit now write quickly here one verse later you have the positionally placing in the adoption in the body of Jesus Christ as we said last week God Himself came down and that fifth letter there in the Hebrew alphabet that that that of the that of the age that fat five numerical value speaking of grace God spread Abraham's life apart and he inserted himself in the midst of Abraham's life because God did not want Abraham's he wanted Abraham you see it is not us reproducing ourselves but it is God's own life that is being reproduced through us and that's why brother Branham could say that had that Abraham when God gave Abram that name his own name because Abram was to reproduce the faith of Elohim through his life and that's what a real believer is it's not our faith it's God's faith you're not here tonight by your own faith you're here because he made a promise by his presence real to you and faith has rose in your heart to stand on that promise and as a believer the same God then moved on you for that promise is the same God that will move on you for every promise and you just be as obedient and the simple as it was when he moved on your heart that's exactly how the rapture is [Applause] Abraham was in a place where he was spiritually prayed up and the promise had already been made when God brought it to a place to where he lets it be known to Abraham that Sarah you're gonna have a son by Sarah thy wife and by the way he lets him know don't you call her Sarah I know more see there was a hidden character down there you see what God speaking to is the depth because the Bible is clear I believe it's in second Chronicles and when it's given the genealogy and it given the genealogy says and there is an abram out the same is Abraham let me tell you something there is that of Carlos and metal Samuel and that of power and that of Richard in that of day but the same is also a son of God amen we know your house had the same as Aaron and the same as a son of God it's the same thing it's God letting us know that he's speaking to the character down on the inside amen God did not call Abram because he was worthy he called Abraham because Abram was a part of God hallelujah and the same was called Abraham hallelujah Oh beloved what love is this that we should be called the sons of God the world did not know him no more than it knows us Abraham was in a place I want you just to this is a very simple but it's something I believe then it's a part and to be a part of our lives God has just spoken to him he's letting know there's got to be a seal in your flesh Abraham remember makes the petition oh that Ishmael would live before you why would Abram ask that it was because he loved Ishmael it's because Abraham is staring and seeing the deadness of himself he's dead and he's right in the place God wants him sometimes God not just sometimes let me correct that God lets us come to the end death that life can come life can't come as long as you're still alive but when it's death and you know what God let him go now Abraham in his body fake in his body he's completely dead he can't father any more children right now Sarah's been bearing the whole time but God lets him know Sarah is gonna bear a son and I'm gonna tell you what his name is it's Isaac I'm gonna establish my covenant with him and furthermore God lets it be known yeah I heard what you said about Ishmael yeah I'll bless him he'll have you I'm megachurches and we'll do this and we'll do that and you'll have programs and everything else but my covenant is with Isaac and God clarifies it in Genesis 17 21 and he says my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year this word right here this is no messing around with an address it's as punctual this isn't well someday you'll get well this is affirmative in the next year you know what that means there's got to be nine months so between Ronettes spoken and the three months that leads to the nine months there it's gonna have to come a transformation Lord in order for this to happen you're gonna have to do something because the way I see myself and the way that I see the promise of the world you know what you're asking for you're asking for one to feel the preach you're asking for one that can put his hand on where you are and the handle where God has called you to be don't you realize that's what the Holy Ghost is the breach in your life that yelps you to the word where you are prisoner of jesus christ you are united in the word by the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost himself that standing in the gap Alleluia will repeat of God and your need he knew your need knew my need knew he would be here and God has provided for himself how can we be united outside of him so Abraham knew that this was coming now you think about it brother Brian within the set time next year Abraham Abraham was setting in the tent door brother Graham tells us he said Abraham was in the door lot was in the gate he said I'd rather be in the door than being the gate because the door is in the house Abraham was in the house lot was on the gate come on thank God for gate for those who are gated for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish are you with me but to be in the house it's ordained to be in the house and Abraham is sitting in the door he's looking because there's been a promise made that Sarah is going to have a son and now here Abraham looks up and he sees these three men coming and he runs to meet them the Spirit of God Abraham you think Abraham one meditatin in the word Abraham no that was meditating in the word he was thinking about the name change he's you know recovering there from the seal in his flesh he's bearing the seal of God's covenant there in his flesh here he is you know he's receiving strength from God he's nursing why standing there in the tent door and about that time remember as we read in the scripture he went and told some young men go get onion young calf otherwise known as the fatted calf kept up for special / special occasions go get that fat and captain prepared he told Sara quickly me get three cakes of flour and need him quickly he's telling her and brother random wouldn't bring it like this he said Abraham was telling Sara Sara this I believe is our day of visitation you see the Spirit of God was connecting him with the promise that was made in the other chapter but now the God who made that promise was appearing there before him in human flesh the same God that it dealt with him in portions down through that the the ages had given him strength to walk out of the earth Saudis had given him a little more strength to live a sanctified life and now comes and releases his strength in him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost changes his name brings the seal of the circumcision in his flesh and says you are going to receive the promised son very no ands ifs buts maybes with God every promise that God has made you will have to fight for it you will have to fight for it and you're fighting for says this is my promise idiots worth it it is mine oh my this is why you know brother dad said I want to be so acquainted with him he said I want to I want to see him I want to recognize him when when I when I see him I want to be so acquainted with him I'll know him on the very first sight I recognize that it's god that's my heart's desire as to be as Abraham was now let's let's bring this in this manner here God is showing and laying out through this visitation God is laying out in this time where it is a capping and bringing to manifestation the coming of the son that has been promised they started out walking in that promise now God there is coming a time where now the very fullness of the God whom self the Lord who made the promise now to come on the scene and now to perform that promise that he himself has made now when we look at it here you see all of this it pertains that's why that that this in the scriptures it's not just it's not stories its prophecy for this same thing remember the Bible says in the book of Galatians that how that the blessing of Abraham through the cross has passed upon the Gentiles and God had already preached to Abraham that that Envy shall you know shall you know shouts out dominations be blessed that shall be a father of many nations and those so then if we as Paul would bring this in if we be in Christ by that of the Holy Ghost we are Abram Abraham's seed because we are identified in Jesus Christ now to think here at the closing out before the coming son here with Abraham what we're reading before the promised son could be received God comes down and reveals himself through human flesh there's a reason that he does this because the revealing of himself in human flesh is to raise the faith and to bring a uniting for the oncoming son and then to receive the oncoming son it's also to announce there is judgment and destruction that is coming that's the same way it was when the Lord Jesus came at the end of the Jewish dispensation let me just slow down look when he come now at the Jewish dispensation he reveals himself in Matthew 8:20 and he call he refers to where he is standing as that the son of man foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man nowhere to lay his head in Matthew 16 13 through 16 Jesus remember he's asked them who do men say that I the Son of Man am and some said you're John the Baptist and some said Elijah and some said Jeremiah or one of the prophets see all of them were portions of him they were all portions of him they were all pointing to him they were all reflections but he is the true light and so he's asking them who are men saying that I am and to see their referring back to will your John the Baptist's or it's Elijah or it's Jeremiah but he turns to them and he says who do you say that I am because what's important is you got to know who he is to you is it just a historical figure is it just something that happened 2,000 years ago or is he real tonight to where you recognize what was done 2,000 years ago was a manifestation of what was in God's mind and I was included in the vicarious suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ and I that was me that He shed his blood for me he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him you understand you come to the place that Calvary is not a wholesale affair but Calvary is a personal revelation what was sung about tonight where there comes a living reality there that the Living God our judge became our attorney and he shed his blood and he sent back the Holy Ghost as a token there that you can say there has been a pass from death unto life who do you say that I am now watch this Peter answers thou art the Christ the Messiah the son of the Living God remember how he made himself known to Abraham the Lord appeared right the fullness of God appeared and Abram went running and said my lord capital L Laura Cates all lowercase R lowercase D agonize that which is one that in relation to that a flesh God become flesh hallelujah Abraham knew who Dorsett so when they're asking who do who do men say that had the Son of Man am who was standing there the Virgin born son of God that right virgin born body made in the likeness of sinful flesh right he had to come and through that way the Bible says in Galatians 4 that he had to be made of a woman made under the law to redeem them who were under the curse of the law when he appeared to Abraham you see that could not be a shedding of blood and a Redemption and of putting away of sin but there was a uniting with the promise that would speak of what he would do at the end of the Jewish dispensation and he would also point to the time that we are living in in the ending of the Gentile dispensation let me just for sake of time when Jesus stood before the Jews in John 8 and he began to talk about the same and they said well you know are you greater than Abraham who are you he's dead are you are you greater than the prophets they're dead who make us thou thyself who are you Jesus let him know I'm not packing around my own honor the Father honoureth me in other words I'm going around toot my own horn the seal of the Father is impressed upon my life that's the ministry of the son of man the fullness of the Holy Spirit the seal of God has come right there has to be a sealing of God's people before destruction can come it's all of this place all of this lays in here and he goes on to tell them he says Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it now what did Abraham see Abraham saw what we just read right here and he saw what they were seeing God was manifested in flesh he was standing there and then notice when he stood there before Sarah he was he desert the word discerned the secrets and intents of the heart this was not this ministry was not something that was to glory in the outward appearance come on somebody this ministry takes the cover off of sin it takes all of this self-made righteousness and takes it right down to the core where you could have men that you couldn't put a finger on their lives come on now they had everything just so right and they did this so right and this and but Jesus looked at him and said you're full of dead men's bones you know what a disgrace it was to touch a dead person you weren't even allowed in the camp they were full spiritually of dead men's poles it was things of the past but they couldn't recognize the God that they read about they couldn't recognize him standing in their midst this is what the promises were all about the promises weren't about that you can recite the ten commandments that you knew what Moses said here you know what Elijah said there that he what it was all about it's that you recognize the one who sent Moses the one who said Elijah the one who spoke surger mind that you recognize that Living God that was there living in every portion and every reflection of the rainbow that is gathered up into the supreme light of all life and it's shining in a light of redemption hallelujah that's what was important and men that were so astute let me just tell you right now you need to turn around and just black the devil's eye right now you might look at and say I don't understand this I don't understand this I don't understand this but I'm asking you can you recognize him because if you can recognize him he'll see to it that you understand what you need to understand when you need to understand that I would rather be here tonight in that condition than to know this message in and out and not be able to recognize him alone I'd rather know him because not to know his water his life but to know him this life if you know his word and you don't know him then his word don't have no life and power in it and you don't have a living vindication in your life but when you know him you know the life giver that raised up Jesus from the grave you know that same God that raised that body up that was cold that was stiff and he raised it up out of the tomb whether he can raise promise after promise after promise in your life he can raise you higher and higher and higher by what that same quickening power he took the woman at the whale and quickening power raised her from a prostitute to a saint it only did it raised her took what God's thought was all the time that word came had redeemed her it scattered all the darkness like Genesis one it broke back the clouds here who was at the ending and this Jewish dispensation who are you Jesus looked at him and said Abraham rejoiced what we read today Abraham ran to meet him Abraham said go get the fatted calf go get make cakes Sarah this is our moment of visitation the Lord Himself has descended him with a shaft come on somebody Amen the Lord not a part but the Lord Himself this is the mystery of the coming of the Lord the Lord Himself descending in that of a shout what is that the Living bread of life the outpouring of the Holy Ghost that pokken life bearing a man that can they connect all these promises together here takes the Holy Ghost and it takes the Holy Ghost to make it live in our life here was a closing out of that Jewish dispensation and Jesus let him know before Abraham was I am hope they didn't have a piece of bread in their mouth they probably choked because they're thinking year before Abraham you ain't a man more than 50 years old he wasn't talking about this he was talking about who he was he said I am the resurrection and the life God came down and created a body to dwell in to pay the price of redemption to bring you and I'll back to himself and that same God that came and paid the price of redemption and ascended up on high sent back the Holy Ghost and has been bringing a Gentile bride down through the ages down through the seven ages and now here we are standing in this time for finishing up of that time two ways not coming in a term as far as to redeem her he's already done there but the coming of the Lord now is to claim what he's already redeemed you see you and I just recognize that we were included in Redemption but you already redeemed he already paid the price on Calvin and before Calvary in the mind of God your name and my name was wrote on the lamb section when it wrote his name down because we are not identified in our own name in the day that God made them male and female he called their name Adam we are identified in the name of the world and his name is called the Word of God the Lord Jesus Christ in the closing out of the Jewish dispensation he makes himself known as the Son of Man the fullness of the Godhead bodily it's the fullness not a portion the fullness but you know what that's making ready for the upper room Genesis 18 is making ready for Sarah's womb come on somebody you see here it is where he has made known to them like you did in Abraham the sign of the Messiah brother Dan will say like this let me read it out as straight as the gate he said you know you say he was standing Jesus before these righteous Jews that could not believe him to be the son of God and they called Abraham their father he was letting them know what he was that he was doing the same things in his flesh that God did in another flesh when he met their father Abraham Jesus also said I'm just moving here Jesus also said in Matthew 24 for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even unto the West so also shall also the coming of the Son of man be this is not the coming of the Son of Man whether it were the earth were those inhabitants of the earth who remain in the tribulation and even after it's been revealed to Israel this is not what the scripture pertaining to this scripture is pertaining to the evening light that comes in this hour it's pertaining to the angel of the Lord that same angel in Revelations 18 one that says that great angel who the earth was lightened with his glory they manage the fullness of the Holy Ghost that come to the Church of the Living God the same angel of God that led him out in a first Exodus but same angel of God that came in the second Exodus and is the same angel of God in the third Exodus that's leading us as a letter from a natural land to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now leading you and I to the baptism of the Holy Ghost into in my father's house are many mansions the same angel of the Lord this was why I want to read these quotes to you here brother Branham says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man Elohim the strong one would come down in human flesh hello him the strong one would come down in human flesh and would manifest himself by knowing the secret of the heart of the one he was talking to just exactly what his son did when he was here on earth dwelling in human flesh what flesh your flesh my flesh the Holy Spirit Himself coming down in human flesh and dwelling showing signs in another part he said here it is it's the same angel that met Abraham you think about that brother here the previous chapter he's already made the name change and here shows up strangers how many of you ever had a stranger show up to you and call you your name you'd want to know how does this person know my name the first thing going through your mind they might give you a list and tell you where a million dollars are but you ain't even thinking about what they're saying you're thinking about who told him my name you see what God did he made himself known Abraham recognized who it was come on somebody it was Abraham that caught the visitation that was coming it was Abraham that told Sarah the Lord is come here this is our visitation Sarah get ready what a faithful husband Abraham was he let Sarah know this is our day a visitation probably to God and here here it was that same angel he came there and her name has just been changed and Abraham's name had just been changed in the previous chapter he one lakh they'd went down to the post office and said you know we don't have no it's not a change of address I know don't even ask questions I go on it is our names been changed and so when you see that of Abram there will be certain things coming to Abram but just scratch that out because our names been changed No God changed their name God knew what their name was and God has called your name God knows what your name is how does he speak to you he speaks to you through the word he speaks to you by his Spirit come on somebody hey manners were in tune with him he is speaking there is a communion that takes place brother Graham says look at this the same angel that met Abraham this is very important not me this is just a vessel he can use you're a vessel he can use you see the ministry here it was not a ministry of where this is done and now God goes away we're not living back in Genesis 18 what i preaching to you tonight is history I've got to lay this for what for what we're coming into this present this is history to live back in Genesis 18 and in that time when here it's come down in human flesh to live back then that time is back in history it's now to be filled with the mystery of God in your womb not just for guts and a prophet and they're wonderful all these testimonies and all those things honor listen we we thank God for the Ministry of Malachi for if it had not been for the Ministry of Malachi for revelations 10 7 you and I would have never known who was in our midst it took an eagle for the Eagle to declare himself come on somebody it took a sheaf for the wave sheaf to make himself real to you and I it wouldn't take Eagle theology it took the living flying eagle the power of God to move down that you and I might recognize but once we've recognized Malachi for revelations saying they have served their purpose and the message that has come it comes now to reproduce Jesus Christ in bride form not another message but the Holy Ghost producing and reproducing producing and reproducing the world in our life it's growing and multiplying not me this is just a vessel he can use sometimes I think people glorifying the vessel too much you're a vessel he can use you see if the devil get your eyes just on that you feel the recognize you're a vessel he can use well I ain't like brother branham God don't want you to be like brother branham he wants you to be you he manifest his glory through you now say I'm not a preacher I'm not of this I'm not that you don't have to be that you just be a believer and let him manifest his power through your life oh brother man says you let him know that the very God that talked to Abraham that dwell in human flesh some kind of flesh he created we are flesh look at this that he created and promised through the righteousness of his son that we'd be sanctified and given gifts that his spirit would move in us like it did before the destruction of Sadr your flesh and my flesh consecrated to his purpose you're not the prophet of the hour I'm not the prophet of the hour but a prophet has come and the prophet used him a prophet went off the scene but the prophet still stays here the Prophet is the Spirit of Truth that's what brother Brown called the prophet of the hour is the holy ghost that's why that we are to recognize who it is that has spoke to us behind the flesh veil because who else that has spoke to us is the one that performs the word in our midst and in our lives and is the very one that will translate us into the rapture program said just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom it's there ain't it it's there see how God leaves these things out like a map in the mall you're here the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form three men two angels and God himself the Bible said he came down and manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham and Sarah what they were thinking in the tent he said now Jesus said at the day when the Son of Man is being revealed in other words the Son of Man the Ministry of Jesus Christ his self is talking about the fullness not just a portion of the Holy Ghost but the fullness of the person himself this is why you had a question where a person turns around and they you know they ask brother branham you know oh the question a brother branham some say could brother branham could Jesus look like brother man brother BAM said it's the same spirit anointing me that was there and he said if you that have the Holy Ghost it's the same spirit anointing you come on somebody you see as we said here even the other day that when we look at it and recognize that the eyes themselves are not outside the body dies are in the body and the eyes are what let's light in the body come on now the random himself is a part of the many membered body it is the message that you and I the message and the messenger and we recognize we are under the authority of that word that God has vindicated in this hour this is our message I don't know you we've not been given a message to talk about historical things but this is a time for that which was spoken to come to pass a man not just to rehearse things of the past but that this word he comes to pass in our life I want you to think of this brother M says the church and went from justification through Luther through sanctification through wrestling through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals he's dealing with the church remember Jesus was given a pure undefiled bride at the day of Pentecost mature it was a bride aged he came he came in bride form the son of man was here what was he doing the son of man in the closing out of the Jewish dispensation what was next to come there in the womb of that Church of the Living God the church from Pentecost did not start out as an infant girl it was a fully matured woman when God laid Adam to sleep took out of his side he what did he do he brought after he had brought her forth he brought her and she says she shall be called woman she was taken out of man and he said that that how man shall leave his father mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one they will want when they walked out of the upper room hallelujah he that had come in the flesh and now come in their flesh are you with me that is why in x19 for others who were preaching about the coming of the Lord and what God had done in John's ministry and my and their wonderful in John's ministry and they were talking about Jesus ministry and Paul said hold on a moment have you received the coming of the Lord I mean the Holy Ghost I see come in your flesh yet are you talking about what he did in that flesh what he did in that flesh now the atonement has come and you're to be filled with the Holy Ghost it was the ending of the Jewish dispensation the manifestation of the Son of man and that led them to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost then we see the Fallen woman takes place here in the fusion Age after that Bride age of about 20 years what happens the seed goes in the ground and the Dark Ages right you put a seed in dirt is that right then the seed starts to come forth it'll shoot then it comes up to a tassel then it comes up from a tassel you've got there you've got to shuck and the shuck looks like the seed but the seed is inside right so there has to come a time where the seed that's in the shut that the seed comes out of the shot right so you have all of these parts and where it is speaking in this hour at the ending of the Gentile dispensation that so shall the coming of the Son of man be has the lightning shyness right from the east and to the west this is speaking of this time we're living in I'm closing your okay I'm closing you okay we just cross here but the church will go through all of this and go right on in let me finish this quote and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons who's taking us there he has what's done it grace grace grace grace grace God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one the token of his life to where we are identified by his life in his life we're living in the day of the seal of the Living God the seal of the Living God remember grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption Martin Luther did not have the seal Wesley did not have the seal Pentecost did not have the seal but here at the end time the seal comes because it's God listen it's God testifying to his workmanship I have brought the bride to perfection and he puts his seal upon it and remember he who the father has sealed the son of man it is Christ himself in bride form same life same reflection same manifestation same Jesus and with that he's just like when they came and said no I will return unto the according to the time of life now who was the I brother Brian that's talking is the I the flesh or is the I the I am behind the flesh it was the I am behind the flesh and it caught what was in Sarah's heart she left in her heart me how pleasure with my lord this has been and he's an old man too but he caught you wasn't reading her eyes or reading her mind like I catch her facial motions she was in the tact behind him but he revealed the sign of the Messiah he revealed the secrets and intents of the heart you know what that was to do that was liberating Sarah it was God taking the sails off of Sarah the sails up down that had ever sailed up but the word forced the issue and here he stands she laughed in her heart and Sarah said no no no I didn't know Graham said you see our stupidity y'all with me I say amen to that every time I've heard it ever read it amen he said our failures our mistakes he said in preaching revival none of us would be here including the preachers to preach it but he said what it is he said you say I make failures he said Abraham made failures but what it is he said it's that word in you and you are a part of your husband the Lord Jesus Christ and it's the word working in you the female could not be circumcised but her circumcision was in that of the male so the seal that we bear upon our life is the seal of the Living God the Lord Jesus Christ come on it ain't a church seal it's the seal of the Living God hallelujah and more identified in his life God would have slew her but she was identified in Abraham remember when he came he said where is Sarah thy wife God knew they were Bible sweethearts they were identified in a oneness a union and God if he did touch Sarah he too had to kill Abraham and in order for God to take us he had to kill Christ but he can't do it alone even of all the times that even in our hearts where we've sent her now I don't know I don't know if I could be with me on I don't know me and I don't know you're looking at yourself how can I do this how can i it ain't what you can do it's what he already did [Music] so they didn't just break the seals off your life but stand you let him break the seals off your life and you watch that transforming power it moves down it changes it transforms it releases it breaks holes I'm so glad about that I trust it's a little bit clearer to you not though these things are new to us new to some but I believe it's good as all Spirit of God would give unction to go back into this and to think about where we're living within this time and the question was asked and I think it bears asking tonight is there anything too hard for the Lord capital L capital o capital R capital D nothing you might say brother Samuel I don't feel like I got much faith don't confess that don't you even confess that faith itself is what says God has promised it God will fulfill it what do i do get yourself in the tent door and start praying and start expecting you pray and you take a hold of that promise and you expect God to come because what God said in the previous chapter he didn't scatter something this was not something was just well some years to come he said within the set time this next year I'm coming I'm coming and I think I'm gonna come I'm gonna come in Sarah - you see that's why in the hour that we're living in when the rest of the church world is looking for when the Son of Man would come in great power and glory and that they're looking for all of that they're looking for a part there that's in Matthew 24 and revelations 1 and all of those little parts that are there looking for it in that way but the coming of this the coming of the Lord in this hour is actually a going he has come in his bride come on now and you know what that means here the bride the marriage of the lamb has come and his in his bride she has made herself ready we are going to the wedding supper we are going to see our bridegroom there is a literal Jesus there is a literal Jesus that's heavy [Applause] [Music] and his spirit have been pulled out to make the church ready what we do stay in your tent door just keep staying in your tent door and when it comes to that moment you'll know when to run you'll know you're magnetized to the promise let's pray your lord I pray Heavenly Father tonight your God when we look at where we're at in this hour nor do we don't take it lightly we're hard to be sober to be serious I pray father if there's one among us one that would be listening or one that would hear this service that God if they're not ready may they make their preparations and tonight may they Lord I pray your God just giving to you letting the grace of God work in their life Lord to see Abraham's life from Genesis 12 all the way he kept walking all he he had failures he made mistakes but the grace of God it kept moving in Abraham's life Lord the same way you're moving in our life your God I pray right now tonight may every heart God just be so set every one of our hearts just be so set dear caught in the promise it's you fulfilling your word or God I think tonight there's not one of us that are here that's been called by man we've been called by you you might have used an agency a man but it was not man that called us it's you so father you are faithful to your word he that begun the good work in us shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ lord I pray tonight Oh God may Lord your word as Lord we take hold of it and that it would take hold on us and we take hold on it and it takes hold on us oh god I pray father may Lord as believers taking hold of that promise and believe that that promise is for us granite Lord whatever it is tonight this deliverance granite right now Lord I pray healing in the body granite Lord all of this is in the atonement right for the Holy Ghost granite tonight Lord father we love you and we thank you lord I pray God [Music] may faith just grow faith just growing Lord in the promises of this our Lord as we give ourselves may oh goddess children of God we just take hold of that word quit worrying and just feed on the word don't worry don't entertain thoughts of doubt cast that down entertain what he is saying to you how do I entertain it like Abraham did go make some cakes for him prepare a fatted calf for him inviting men Oh God when you showed me today Lord when I read today Lord this that was spoken Lord Oh father I thank you lord I thank you Lord for speaking to my heart lord I thank you for making your word reel to my heart Lord I thank you Lord for the promises Lord you've given to me Lord I thank you Lord for telling me I'm a son of God thank you Lord for telling me I'm a daughter of God Lord I believe that god those rights are for me Lord God that the land is for me Lord the promises are for me or granite Lord God like Abraham believing he that made the promise is able to perform what he posed or Granite Lord tonight Granite Lord thank you Father for your mercy well thank you for your grace Lord oh Lord if not for grace where would we be thank you Lord that you look to the depths of the seal in our life or how real it is how real it is we love you bless your people Lord bless your people father nor has we been blessed to set in the presence of the Holy Ghost the word as it's coming forth it's changing us it's cleansing us it's washing us it's filling us we are being changed from glory unto glory oh how we love you Lord it's by your spirit [Music] hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord glory be to God you love him tonight amen all glory be to God how many good singer song

rose on that Easter morning he was there walking on the road to Emmaus they didn't know him but he revealed himself in the word and what did that do it let him and pointed him to the upper room because you see that raising in the resurrection was the testimony of a great on coming revival to where that now the Messiah has come sacrifice has been offering now it's time for the Holy Ghost to be poured out God to come and live in his people they walked out of the upper room staggering and as they came out there for room he said Peter head he said wait wait wait they're not drunk as you suppose they got full of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what when you get full of the Holy Ghost you're on a drunk from the time you're filled to the time you leave come on now isn't that the truth if you don't feel that way it's time do you start drinking a little more start drinking in on the Holy Ghost and stop taking little cat fools in and well I'll just have a little bit of the Holy Ghost tonight no take the bottle take the bottle God didn't pour out a cap in this hour hallelujah he sent the contents that was in the vas home he poured out his fullness in this hour so we don't want to be walking around with spiritual shot glasses we want to take the bottle come on somebody they man just keep drinking keep feasting on that word you say I've got a need in my life quit looking at yourself and look at the word and just keep on drinking keep drinking keep drinking and watch the transformation we are transformed by the Word of God you believe that tonight hallelu glory be to God
