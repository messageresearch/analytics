just Lord want to set aside all of our thoughts and that everything would be centered upon you Lord just that you would come just take control of speaker and hearer minister to every need for the glory of God we ask we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this morning so good to be in the house of the Lord together amen if you'll turn with me to Ephesians 3 and I want to read a few verses of scripture as let you be seated here in just a moment in Ephesians 3 and verse 14 and Paul would write like this for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith notice dwell in our hearts by faith the inner man strengthened what is that inner man that's that seed Gene of God Amen and that Christ May dwell in your hearts by fath faith that ye being rooted and grounded in Love Now think of it anytime you have ever I think many many people in here you plant different things uh some of you plant tomatoes some of you plant you know your flowers and things and you realize that in order for that plant to actually come forth whether it's certain colors you want to see in it or fruit or vegetables whatever it is that plant itself must actually become established it must become rooted and it must become grounded is that right in order for it to bring forth so here is here is Paul under the inspiration of God that how the inner man would be strengthened by his might that Christ would dwell in our hearts by faith that we would be rooted and grounded in love so when you're rooted in everything you know you could sprinkle all the you know all the water you know a lot of times you could water a plant and you water up up here the leaves don't take in the water they don't take in the water what actually supplies the nutrients for the plant roots right when it's rooted it draws from beneath the ground that you and I it draws from a source we don't see we don't see all the different nitrogen and things like that going in but it's there in the soil is that right and then you also know that there's times when you plant certain types of plants you got to check the acidity of the level of the soil what's the pH level you know certain ones you some of you that raises zelas and roses and dogwoods and things like that you know there's certain acidity that is needed in the soil well you know what in our lives we need checkups amen yes amen we need a certain acidity a certain saltiness of the holy spirit amen amen aren't you glad that there's a faithful Gardener that's been placed in the garden amen may be able now notice may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us oh that's beautiful ain't it amen unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen may the Lord bless you as you're being seated I'd like to continue to speak to you here this morning on the thought we were looking on Thursday Discerning the love of God we recognize that God's desire from the very beginning that love itself we know love as the scripture would tell us love is God and we looked at a little bit on Thursday I'm not going to review that but to see how that it's so contrary to even how the world and much even of religion or christom of how that they would view or experience love many experience or view love as something that is sappy let you get by with anything and you know it doesn't you know judge you it doesn't correct you it doesn't and and that's not real love because as a reality is real love will bring correction to our life where it's needed to think about it you know that that's what actually comes about where love is ministered to our life it comes to correct or drive away or as the Bible would say that the rod driveth the foolishness out of the heart of the child so the love of God will actually do that and so we're thankful that we see that how that love in the very beginning was love that was governing right there in the Garden of Eden they were not under a law they was it was a love affair God had given them that word as a matter of fact brother Brown would tell us that they had perfect understanding of the love of God and you might you know we would look at that and think well perfect understanding but it was an atmosphere it was a condition you could ask them let's just look at it in this way because this is where brother Bram is going if we look at it in this way if you would have asked Adam or you asked Eve does God love you no question no doubt they had perfect understanding the perfect understanding was not that they understood all that was God had given them by commandment as a matter of fact brother Bram tells us that Adam did not understand that and God would await to an appointed season to open up his word and this is then where in the time of that Waiting for God to make it known to where the enemy slipped in and wanted to interpret the promise but we know that every time that God gives his word God does not leave it nor entrust it to the hands of a man to interpret it but that word is actually going to be interpreted by God himself fulfilling that word and so when we we see it in this measure that the perfect understanding of the love of God is where there was a love there was a confidence that they operated with an atmosphere and there was a complete understanding there was no fear that was there whatsoever and now to think how that God has brought us back into that place where the first Adam where the fall took place the second adom the quickening spirit now brings us back into that place again to where that love is to be the so governing Authority and Power in our life which is the Holy Ghost and so when we look at the family of God the family of God as we read here in these scriptures is that which is born of the spirit of God it's the love of God as Paul would write that is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost to think of what God was in Christ all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into church into the church this is why that when we look at as we're reading on Thursday night and how that John here uh you know a great Paradox here when he writes about the love of God and the love among the Brethren this is why that when that has so struck our hearts inity this is why that hatred has no part in or among Believers at all and that's why because the love of God is a our hearts is to display that same life that was displayed in Jesus Christ it's deeper than just loyalty right I want to just drop that you can be loyal to something and yet not in love you could be loyal to your mate and yet you're not in love you could be loyal to a church and yet you're not in love with God this is why brother brand he brings it down and and how the spirit of God will point it out because look we're living living in a time you can find people even in even in the times we live that are very loyal dedicated church members is that right but there's something that goes so far beyond this is like when brother B says the difference between a Christian and a holy ghost filed Christian it's deeper than loyalty to a church it's much greater than that it actually comes it's a love affair right it's a love affair not just a loyalty But A Love Affair and if it's a real love affair it will make us Loy not just loyal to a church but it brings the loyalty to him no matter where we are no matter where he's at it's like the young man who was over there studying at to be an artist in Rome all the rest of the Americans would go out they would party they would do everything else and this guy who was a caretaker he asked this young man he said I noticed something about you he said you're different he said why don't you go out and run around with the rest of these Americans now they were all Americans but he said now he said let me tell you why he said there's a young lady he said back over home in a certain State and he said in that certain State there's a certain city and in that certain city there's a certain Street on that certain Street there's a certain house and he said in that house is a certain young lady he said I have promised myself he said to her he said so why I am here he said I am living according to that promise even though that he couldn't see her but his the love itself is what held him and that's exactly what the love of God does in the heart of a real believer and to think that the love of God I want you to capture this now the love of God does not work contrary to the word of God or to the body of Jesus Christ because it's a spirit of Truth in 1 John 4:12 no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us now remember a person can say well I I I love the Brethren but if if you're not walking in harmony with the Holy Spirit and your life is tallying up with the word then it's not a fulfillment of what's being C being called out here because when you really love the Brethren the only way you can really love the Brethren the way you ought to is to have the love of God in your heart which is comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when that operates in that channel it puts you in the body of Christ which is the word of God the revealed promise of the day and you're walking in harmony with Jesus Christ and then as you walk in harmony with Jesus Christ you'll be walking in harmony with one another who are of that same body because you're under a true vision of the word so if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us remember it was man who fell so God would come down to redeem man what brought him down love brought him down and so his love is perfected not our love remember as we looked at on on Thursday night it does not say in the scripture wives love your husbands but it says husbands love your wives because we could never you and I could never be able to produce this kind of a love we fell from this love we fell from that agape love and fell down into into a place that was beneath that so it required God himself to come down and Manifest this love to you and I walking here in this life and that would capture our hearts and our lives in order to bring us back into this place that we were intended to live and to dwell in we were intended that our lives would be under the influence regulated under the control of Agape Love Now one thing you see about agape love it's different than all as you take love and you go right on down the strain brother Ram would describe it in the Hebrew series and many other places if you look that agape love is not a love that's self-seeking nor selfs serving Agape Love Is that which actually it's looking at out it's looking out for the other person it's looking out for other interests isn't it a paradox that God here you and I come by a birth now think about what our birth was our birth was based as as David would say we were born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies we entered this we entered this as brother bam said without a fighting chance we entered it and here about that this body this creation even though there was a love between father and mother and so forth but yet here we are born under a fallen condition a fallen nature and God doesn't come to try to change our flesh he doesn't come to try to change our spirit but what he wants to do is get to the inside the control part because when he gets to that inside part where that son and daughter of God is laying dormant and the quickening power comes upon it it will raise up what was dead and bring it to life and it will be an expression of his love that will emanate and move throughout all the other courts of our life does that of the new birth on the soul does it change the spirit and the body no it just simply gives us the control we're in contact with God in tune with him our desire is to follow him and so this is why when things come our way evil thoughts and everything else that comes our way we have a power on the inside a ruling power there's another King on the inside there's another Administration on the inside that's able and stands there to rule thanks be to God for the Holy Ghost so this is where the love of God is perfected in us or it comes to its completion when you and I have been born again now when we look at that the love of God coming into Perfection is much like when you think of the Tabernacle in the wilderness of how that they were to prepare that Tabernacle in the wilderness they were to build it there was a certain pattern that it must be followed and when following that pattern that was given by the spirit then when the when the Tabernacle itself was complete or reared up and it would speak there in Exodus their time in Solomon's time it would speak in that time of when it was perfected it'll actually use those words in the book of chonicles when it is finished and when the finishing time had come it was not man who could say oh this is work is finished oh this work is perfect it wasn't that it was the very presence of the shic glory that came down and it filled the temple and that in itself was the capping the finishing the Perfection of that work it was that which had been given by vision is now come forth and God says Ah this is what I had in my mind and he comes and he sets down in the midst of that Temple that's what he's done for you and I this is where the love of God is perfected in us now when we look at it the Bible says 1 John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect our love made perfect now this was not our love originally this is his love right herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment that's confidence because as he is so are we in this world because it is that same life that he came down the same God who came down and lived that life it's the righteousness of the law is the spirit of Jesus Christ and that same holy spirit that same life God's Own Life coming back inside of us it is that which which brings about a real pardon it generates Purity in our life it brings forth the real Perfection of God driving out all the the love of the world and it sets down in our heart to where the desire that we have is to please him our love is to him our devotion is to him that's his working in our life as he is is he holy yes amen you're holy Hallelujah is he innocent amen you're innocent come on now amen brother bam dedicating the baby and is standing right there you know in the message look and he's dedicating the baby he says oh to think of these little babies how innocent he said but do you realize if you've been born again of the spirit of God you are more innocent than one of these little babies why this is why being born again it's not just a church membership it's just not recognition of something it's an actual Sovereign Supernatural work of almighty God where God brings forth his child and you and I we're not we don't have an old and past no there's a new beginning there is a new creation in Christ Jesus when they walked out of Egypt one of the very first announcements with that Exodus when the Lamb's blood was to be applied this day shall be a new beginning unto you amen so it's our love it's it's the love that is fully brought forth the son or daughter of God and to recognize how that it's so it's just some to me when we look at it it's just so overwhelming of how that the god of Glory would come down and he would so descend in such a measure with his love to where now he would take up residency in the lives of his sons and daughters of God that part that he put on the inside do you realize it was not our flesh that welcomed him it was not our spirit that welcomed him but he was welcomed in that place that he himself had brought forth what was that that was that soul that was there that seed Gene of God that was a place that he could say that always belonged to me that was always me that's who you really are and he could say this belongs to me it was lost it went astray but I've come to redeem it I've paid the price thank you Lord oh glory be to God that now that same Glory could be reflected through our life this is where that in our lives now think of this in the Tabernacle in the wilderness in Solomon's Temple remember then coming in the glory of God that would come forth there was that Mana that originally fell they put that in there that Mana never got old and never got stale it never got stagnant this is why there's got to be a genuine birth of the Holy Ghost you'll go through tests you'll go through trials there'll be times of failure and everything else but when the genuine Holy Ghost gets to the inside on that seed it never goes stale it never gets moth eaten it never gets eaten away with anything else it stays constant the whole time but if it's just on the flesh look out it can actually develop worms if it just comes upon the spirit it can get moldy and stale but when it goes into that place that om that seed that life that son and daughter of God that God intends for it it will bring forth and there is not a staleness oh you know sure you might get cold half times where you're down but you have got a hidden power on the inside and as a son and daughter of God you've got a father that loves you enough that he'll correct you when you're wrong and let you know pick it up step up a little bit glory be to God you got one who's not worried about oh I don't know maybe I shouldn't say this I want him to love me so much he realizes our love is based on confidence and Trust I can't trust nobody if they don't tell me the truth amen sometimes the truth hurts you right is that right what if you told her what if you had a doctor oh my everything's all right you're doing good you keep I tell you what keep on eating all them pizzas keep on doing all this man you're all right that guy's only wanting your money right but sometimes they got to tell you the truth and say you know what you need to stop doing this well I'm glad that Dr Jesus is like that aren't you oh my there is no fear in love but perfect love notice this perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us notice this he first loved us this is a divine revelation this is not Sunday school quotations we love him because he first loved us we love him the person we're in contact with him we recognize that he has come he came for you and me and he comes in the form of his word to make it known to you and I in a personal way so much so to the degree but you recognize if you were the only person upon this Earth he would have done it because he did it for you glory be to God you're not just a bystander and got caught up and a little bit of the love of God splashed out you're not a bystander it was intentional that the word has come across your pathway it is intentional and purposeful that God has moved and got a hold of your heart you might look can sa my brother Samuel I've got a long way to go well let me tell you something he came from Glory he paid the way that you can come into Divine expression oh what love is this that kind of love could stand there and say The God Who started this in me is the same God that will finish it Discerning the love of God hallelujah Romans 58 God commendeth his love toward Us in that while we were yet sinners yes amen worthy of being loved no Christ died for us verse 10 let me skip for if when we [Applause] were oh it don't say best buddies when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life John 3:16 for God so loved the world Hallelujah he didn't love sin no didn't love the condition but remember what was in there amen amen what was in there why did he purchase this whole field right why did bohas purchase all of Naomi's estate to get Ruth now there's many that will benefit from that purchase that are not elect but he came for the elect yes he did it's like I'm swimming I help help help help help brother Brian's in there with me brother Brian help me help me and my daddy comes and my daddy lifts me out he's always my daddy I was always his son right he comes and he helps brother Brian out that helping brother Brian out don't make brother Brian his son but he's saved for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen now when you think of it you know brother Bron will continue to lay this out and just to capture it how that you know there's nothing so stronger than the love of God love will make you trust Hallelujah love it has no fear It cast out fear right and you know it's when you lack confidence that's when fear wants to step in but if you love it'll cast The Fear away it it it's that which God projects God projects his love and it's his love that makes you and I what we are that's right you see there's an atmosphere in confidences we would even move forward here in the service I want you to think of these two words atmosphere and confidence in the Bible in Galatians 5: 6 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor our uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen so here we H the desire that God would have is how his intention his purpose is that we in ourselves would be operating in the confidence of the love of God of what God where he has ra raised us from amen where he took us from hallelujah what what he has done in our lives Amen to know what he took out of our life and what he placed in something that you just feel like and Brother Sam there's just I could start to tell you but it just don't seem like there's enough ink to be able to write it all out of what it means to me of what he's done for me my my life it it revolves around him hallu my desire is to please him amen what is that it's that that part that you look at you recognize in your life it's just something that you can't even put into words but you operate by that love of God hallelujah now brother bam would take you know in Ministry many services on that of love I I I don't know how many times I've went through them over and over and you know you just how the holy spirit will continue to Quicken many things to your heart but brother BR will'll talk about some some events that have taken place in his life he'll talk about that of the bull talk about that of the bees talk about the maniac in Oregon and just to just to speak or to express some of those things and brother R talks about how that that bull that was out there in that pasture now I want you just to catch this of how that when we look at it brother bam tail talks about that boy said a big gsy bull he said that bull he forgot that that bull had been had had been you know moved over to this other farm and brother Brandon walking you know and having to collect bills and things like that and walking up you know coming over the pastures and things but brother BR said what it was that time as a warden he needed to release some fish into a certain Stream So brother R you know he says I was even thinking about it I unbuckled my belt or you know the the the gun and I left the gun on the seat of the truck and he said I went over I just went on him into that pasture I was going over there to put those fish in the Stream and he said about that time after I got to a certain spot in there he said all of a sudden this big old bull stood up now brother R tells us that bull had just killed a man the caretaker of the bull had been killed by that same Bull and brother BR says immediately at that time now notice what he did he said the very first thing that he did he reached for his gun well what was that gun that was his security MH are you with me now he wed for that gun but he realized oh my I left it back there on the seat now brother B told us if he said if i' had that gun at that time think of this now if I had that gun he said I'd have shot that bull wow if I'd had that but see God seemed to it that he didn't have that gun and brother brandom now coming into this place he realizes there's nothing I can do there's no trees to run to there's no way in the world I'll be able to run this bull where I'm at so in that time he begins to look to the Lord notice Lord if this has come my time to go I don't want to go as a coward I want to go and I want to stand here with a real bravery and strength in my life and brother B says how that he begin to say that he said I found myself this is something that's just an absolute Paradox I'm a witness of it I know I'm speaking to others as well brother BR said somehow or another I did not despise that bull Hallelujah somehow or another this was not Christian Science Mind Over Matter this is not what that was but it was a Son of God walking in fellowship with God he was not walking listen to me he wasn't walking in that pasture to try to prove and say my let me prove myself as a Son of God that is not how the storm went back that's not how the bees went back it was not a self-seeking adventure it was something that was on the behalf another purpose and a situation arose that would challenge to try to stop or hinder that purpose and then we find brother Bram said I find myself beginning to think different thoughts right oh that that bull I shouldn't have Disturbed that I didn't even think about that poor Bull and brother BR begins to think notice begins to think those thoughts he begins to think those thoughts he begins to uh speak and express you know to that bull now when you look at this you know many would say well that's crazy in the very beginning Adam could speak to the animals amen we didn't have it we didn't have it you know the lions and tigers they didn't have all those teeth like it was then they were not meat eaters the fall brought a change yes amen is that right right when that of the Millennium sets in it'll bring about another change Hallelujah you won't be looking at at cats with great big canines on them glory be to God this is what the peace of God does aren't you glad aren't you glad that it took out your teeth and gave you some good teeth Hallelujah woo Jesus notice is something that that happened here and brother R goes on to talk about he says now he says you know something took place and he says you know he says there's where the church is at because he talks about he said I wasn't no more afraid of that bull than nothing I wasn't afraid of that bull now listen he said I wasn't afraid of him he says you're always scared talking about the church that it's not going to happen that's the reason it don't happen when fear he said love cast out fear when you got love fear is gone but as long as you got fear love cannot operate he talks about how that that bull it be to charge at him it come within 10 feet stop through his front feet out and he looked so depleted he looked this way and that way and he turned and went back around and laid down over there where he got up and I walked across the field and went out of the pasture he just laid down there and looked at me look it was love that took the fear away and God seen me through does Fear come fear comes but love is there to take it away situations come up situations that can try to grip our hearts and our lives but thanks be to God perfect love cast out fear amen what perfect love that love of God that fills our heart amen it's not our strength it's God's strength his love that cast it out doctor says you only got so much so much time to live but now what was it fear will try to set in fear will try oh you know you'll lose this you'll never be able to do this again you'll never and fear will try to set in oh my yes is that right like it's grip the nation right now right fear will try to set in but what is it that cast out fear love yes amen and God sees me through I love that hallelujah how many's a witness to that Hallelujah now watch this now after I got out of the pasture and that left me then I just shook like a leaf but while I was in the presence of him Hallelujah the fear had left amen sovereignty brother R didn't work this up it what was there already within him as a Son of God to create an atmosphere amen this is why when brother Brandon would stand there even on the platforms and many people would say aren't you afraid when this comes or that come that you know that that the that the angel of the Lord you know he won't be there are you afraid that you know he won't he won't come and brother BR said no he says he promised me amen right hey he promised me right this is why this is a a big big statement brother BR said I've been challenged by muhammadans I've been challenged by Buddha I've been challenged by all the rest of it but he says it like this he says I believe him I love him and the fear of failure has gone from me Hallelujah have you ever been around people you almost got to walk walk walk on the you know uh needles around do I say it just like this or do I say it just like that or what I say come on now there's some people that absolutely they could just make you feel uncomfortable they got every te Dot and every eye except that which is in humility right and it makes you uncomfortable right I mean it makes you uncomfortable because you realize everything that could be coming out how you say this and that and and everything else but you see when what what what relieves the fear of failure God told Joshua as I was with Moses amen Joshua had an example that he could look to in Moses and know that Moses would tell Joshua let my mistakes be stepping stones of God's grace for you he could see God's faithfulness that even when Moses made mistakes because there in his Humanity that God did not forsake Moses god did not forsake his promise but God was there operating through Moses life it was confidence that God was instilling into Joshua's life the fear of failure has gone from me right well what would bring fear of failure law this has got to be just right and this has got to be we believe that the word everything is to hit just right but we do not believe in creating an atmosph sphere of law or legal cuz you can hit you can hit everything the Pharisees hit everything and yet they miss the love of God they they failed to hit what was necessary is that right so the fear of failure has gone from me because I love him I trust him I believe him and I know he will oh my you know this this right here the fear of failure you know what it does it dismantles complexes right amen are you with me right it dismantles complexes let's just be fac it there ain't not one person here screaming one more oh I don't got no complexes yeah you do that right there is one of them it's not saying that we're sitting around you know holding hands in a big great group group steady and singing Kumbaya we all got complexes that's not what we're saying we're saying that there are things sometimes through experiences of life through things that have been said to us events that have happened that inadvertently we did not intend to develop a complex are you hearing me brother brandham did not intend to develop a complex amen but he did but God helped him helped him to overcome that complex that was a witness for you and I I said that was a witness for you and I that God just doesn't put us up on the Shelf events situations things happen in in life but notice it uncovers lies lies that we've been told come on now think about that woman in deep call to deep she's there standing on nervous some guy brother said professing to be a Divine healer that's right he you know what he's toal lie on you and it's got your whole church right amen you mean the power of the love of God can dismantle a lie that will affect my home life M he'll affect the rest of the church amen you see just as much as lies have power remember this world is under the power of a lie right now but you see when the Power of Love Has Come it breaks that whole it breaks fear it casts fear out and it establishes in the place that says I cannot fail because he can't fail you see this is why it behooves us in a time that's like this brother ramwood raise it it's time for us to pick up the weapon of love that our hero God's Great Hero left us it's timeing to dash out yonder fight against ignorance superstitions and formality and Break Down The Walls of the enemy and display the real Gallant love that we believe in God and His word till sickness is healed devils are routed blind see death hear God help me to to do it as long as I got breath in my body yes Amen in 2 Corinthians 5:14 the Bible says For the Love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead right we were dead right walking but we were dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves right see the love of God comes to Deliver Us from selfishness yes amen it's quite a paradox isn't it right that agape love comes and sets down in something that was brought forth contrary to Agape Love and God performs a paradox in our life that they which should not that they which live should not live henceforth unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again so it's a coming under the creative power of the word of God the atmosphere of the word are you hear me yes the atmosphere of the word just like inside of the Tabernacle there was there that shoe breed Mana that was the bread of his presence the bread of his face and it's the partaking of the bread of his face of his person it's partaking of him that's the shoe bread that belongs to us as Believers right amen you see it's what you're feeding on what you're looking at what you're being absorbed with will affect you yes amen are you with me now so now it comes to a place that then if we're feeding we're looking we're tuned into the right the right reality then coming under the anointing of that word then we're under the atmosphere of the person of Jesus Christ where Paul could say it's not I who liveth but Christ who lives in me this why brother R could talk about he said you've seen nice people now just go through all all throughout the message he said you've seen nice people he said but they're the kind of people he says that once you get around them they're nice nice people but you get around them he said you can't hardly stand to be around them right is your life worthy of the Gospel he said you shun them I mean you don't want to you here they come again why are they going to say this time and why are they going to do this time and and you recognize these are things and brother Brown tells us think about it how what a contrast they're a nice person but yet there's an atmosphere that is beneath that niceness that it generates an atmosphere that you just think man I I don't I don't even enjoy being around them and yet it's something that could move in you know moving in your heart you're think but yeah but you know I'm supposed to love everybody I'm supposed to love everybody loving everybody does not mean you having to try to prove something to the devil woo we could preach right here right now bless it's where you love it this is why you can tell a person say Well if you really love brother Joshua you go over and shake his hand you'll hug him around the neck that's real love that's emotion that is outward Expressions but if that's not from here it's not in truth amen the Bible said let us love indeed and in truth so it must be here truth right here now when you look at that this is why that when the love of God comes it really it brings a real experience within a person's life it changes you it changes your life brother BR says it makes the atmosphere around you different he said I've tried it I know it's the truth that man create in himself the atmosphere he lives in did you hear that man creates in himself the atmosph sphere he lives in amen as a man thinketh right in his heart so is he right but same I can't help them thoughts from coming that's true but you can cast them mountain right right give no place Amen to the devil amen is that right and if somehow something's got in there and start to Fester then let's pull down some strongholds hallelujah amen yes woo Lord now y'all didn't lose your amens did you I've tried it it's the truth that man created himself the atmosphere that he lives in Oh Brother Samuel if so and so no no that man creates in himself L tell me you just don't understand my boss my husband my wife that man creates in himself Satan's objective do you see why he wants to fight at you and me to get us out of that atmosphere do you see why tries to bombard our lives with all sorts of things situations come up even with the menial tasks of life that he'll try to bombard our minds and and drawing us out into that place why his objective if he knows if he can try to draw us out from under the presence of that shakana under the main influence where that Fellowship that Union with God if he can get us to where we're living beneath our privileges then in other situations and things that are going on around us begin to influence us and control us but let me tell you as a son and daughter of God you need to recognize God gave me this Authority he gave me this position I was not made to be subservient I was once a slave but I always was a son I've been delivered from slavery I refuse I refuse to be a slave again amen thank you Lord Amen brother BR said here come that maniac right gray suit on brother Bron listen he said run to the platform he said I thought he had a message I thought he had something good found out when he got around him when I the coffee with I mean you understand what I'm saying right found out this guy had a different agenda in mind you know how it is sometimes family they'll sweeten you up the only thing they're wanting to sweeten you up to see how much change you got preach brother Samuel they're sweeten you up you know why oh oh TT you're the sweetest oh you're the sweetest you know what it is they're trying to get you they know you're weak spot you'll do anything hang in the world for they're trying to get you what must I do use discernment and there's a great big word powerful two letters no hello somebody glory be to God but the say I thought you were talking about the love of God I am anything that comes between me and him first no amen but I can help you where it keeps him first and everything else then comes in line yes but if I've got to go around him to express love to you that's not a gape love amen that's called love that is selfish amen woo amen my my my oh love of God how rich and pure I'm glad sweet Jesus here this morning aren't you that man can create in himself the atmosphere that he lives in and around him he's Anointed with the spirit but says they live he said you've seen people you just couldn't get away from you just love them how many you met people like that am there's something drawing about them it's be it's because they live in that atmosphere they live under the power of the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh glory be to God brother R goes on to talk about the diet the diet is the difference between the dough the Dove and the crow their diet is different he said that's the way it is when when a man becomes born again there's something takes place within him that he's sick and tired of the world and there's a Godly Spirit around him brother B says if you'll learn to this is powerful powerful if you'll learn to how many say Lord learn me learn me Lord teach me if you'll learn to love and to be kind to everybody and to be gentle have patience it'll even make your home life different it'll make your associations different you know I don't know why it is I don't have no friends H I don't think it's the people well who might it be come here here's a mirror right there I don't know why it is that everybody all of a sudden after times that you know I just don't have no friends look in the mirror he that showeth himself to be friendly right that ain't just walking around with a big old Texas toothy smile sometimes the showing of teeth is letting you know you get too close brother hello somebody amen you see this is this is where it has an effect what has the effect oh you don't understand that brother that sister no no no it brings it back to Supreme control of the Holy Ghost Inside of You am deity tabernacling inside of your life that's what the real Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost is all about love and kind to everybody and be gentle have patience it'll even make your home life different it'll make your associations different God will honor you amen yes the Bible says when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him amen but I'm praying I'm reading and those things you you keep doing that that's wonderful right but what about here is there hostility in here is there animosity in here is there grievances in here here if there is listen this is not condemnation it's showing you where the enemy the enemy would like to try to pack that in to try to hinder the channel that you've been brought into amen that's Satan's desire to try to hand hinder that channel between you and God as a son and daughter of God this is where the Lord Jesus he said Upon This Rock I will build my church now you remember I I'm not going to try to read this all but you you can read it when you get home I just want to move move on Beyond it but in 2 Chronicles chapter 9 if you read that he deals with the Queen of Sheba she when she heard of the fame of Solomon she traveled right she came she risked her life she risked everything she came with a purpose if this is indeed what they have said that God has visited his people and put a gift among his people then if that is so I'm going to give everything I've got to for that the Bible said she came there and she saw not only the wisdom that God had given to Solomon but the Bible goes on to say the effect and remember real wisdom James said that comes from above is first pure right full of Mercy on and on and on and on and on she saw the wisdom of Solomon not just in discernment it wasn't just in discernment watch she could sit in a service and she saw the different discernment that was taking place she knew that was more than a man but then how that God would have it so recorded that she would actually turn and notice how the Servants of the house conducted themselves the Bible said she even noticed of how that they put the meat on the table right that's right she noticed little small details right you see what the wisdom of God did God's promise gift coming in it would be that of a man of rest it would come in what did it do it affected so much that of the Kingdom of Israel till they did not despise small things they took everything for granted they just didn't look and say my we've got Solomon here my what a great big wisdom no they recognized they came under their position it affected their life how they weren't the king they weren't the priest or this or that but maybe they were the ones that prepared the meat they were the ones that set the table they were the ones that set the meat on the table they took that respons possibility that was not about them it was about the Revelation that God had given them they did what they did as unto the Lord and it showed amen amen what was that the love of God when she saw how Solomon even ascended up the stairs she said there was no more Spirit left in me Hallelujah you see the actions that word displayed in had an effect upon the house of Israel this is why the Bible I love this scripture 2 Chronicles 9:23 all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart sought to come into His presence why because they knew the presence of God was with him and they knew the words that was put in his heart God put him there what a trust oh my now think of this brother Bram talks about in his home you know he talks about how things had taken place in his home when he came in you know people showing up and you know and you know brother Bram talks about people showing up and saying brother brandom I got a word from the Lord for you brother Bram said he talks to me I'm on speaking terms with you right amen amen that's true hello amen and then he had all this you know everything going on people you know showing up and you know praying for the sick and all that you know it it it would it created an atmosphere and sister meia didn't mean to be nervous the children didn't mean to be fussing over blocks on the floor it didn't mean to do that I mean they didn't get up that morning say you know what I'm ready for a good fight Tom morning I'm ready boy I'm telling you I'm just looking for the first thing to no it happened like crossing the pasture with a bull like maybe you walked AC Ross the floor at the factory didn't realize that gery bull would stand up oh hello somebody but notice brother Bram came into that place and notice now brother Bram didn't grab sister mey by the hand and say mey come over here in the name of Jesus Satan turn her loose but that oppressiveness needed to be cast out right discerning the love of God yes so brother Bram said I asked her he said honey won't you let me help you do the dishes let's I'm going help you get dinner on the table and and then you know we'll uh I'll help you with dishes you you you give give me an apron I can put on and you know and put that on there and and go and help you and he said as I begin to you know to help her he said I was praying in my heart now Lord you help me Lord you help me Lord you help me listen to these words he says he said I said Lord you help me now now to get upon me the holy spirit in such a way that will change this situation help me to get the Holy Spirit upon me in such a way that'll change this situation amen so I was praying to myself and I put my arm around my little wife and I said oh sweetheart I really feel sorry for you B says the only thing you have to change the situation right somebody say you you you said you I said you the only thing you have to change the situation oh my brother Samuel praise God we're Sons and Daughters of God you're right right you're right and a son of God is given Authority right Amen to change every situation yes sometimes the patience itself is us having the confidence in the word that's going to work not just I I went and washed the dishes and she's still matter the rattlesnake it might take a good night's rest to get her calmed down well what what is it it's changing it the projection of love right that's right glory amen I said Oh Glory you I may have to just stop on this one watch what brother Ram says if that can be done in the home it can be done in a church right it can be done in a nation it could be done in the whole world it's the atmosphere that counts God 1 John 3 behold what manner that means consider the quality from what country the race the Kindred what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us has given this is the word bestowed given to one what already belong to him right appointing him to an office I know the real reality if somebody comes back and says Father Here I am your son I'm coming back but the real prodal says I'm not worthy to be called Hallelujah your son amen if you say you'll be my servant I'll be your servant before I go back out there it's not us demanding of him but love moves down yes oh I love how brother Ram says he said the angel of the Lord went to the pig pin that night where that boy was at Hallelujah he stunk like a pig eating corn and everything the husk he would have ate the husk if they would have gave it to him he was hungry you let some might get hungry enough you let it come to a place to where where all the world and all these other Ambitions where you recognize it's nothing it's empty right that's right and the angel of the Lord it wasn't that boy that he could remember this from Sunday school or remember that it was the angel of the Lord that dealt with his heart amen and turned his heart around yes has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not right it didn't recognize him remember they they had the princes of this world recognized him they would not have crucified him right they didn't know who he was but yet it was the very manifestation of the word right amen they weren't able to discern that but here that little that little that little woman by the well there was something spiritual on the inside beneath all the darkness there was a spiritual part on the inside that could be awakened when the light of the promise Came Upon her amen it would scatter the darkness she didn't have to go you know and have you know find a church let me find a church a church on says 10 steps to be a good lady uh five steps on how to be you know a right kind of a lady no no she didn't have to do that no right right she just met Jesus amen amen she met one of her kind right beloved can I have just a few more moments I know you're a little lery about that Brother Sam you're a few moments just a few moments beloved now are we the sons of God it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we've seen his appearing in our day am we've recognized and received the visitation of the Holy Ghost the love of our father bestowed upon us to be recognized as Sons and Daughters of God with the life of the Covenant flowing through US amen we shall see him are you with me amen why because we're looking for him amen we came to this service this morning looking for him am amen we get up in the morning we're looking for him oh he disappointed no he didn't disappoint me amen he comes we're looking for his coming amen hallelujah we're expecting him to come he comes in the form of his word he comes and ministers to our need we're looking and living for his coming amen we're not just waiting for the Corporal and all of a sudden a switch gets flipped no no we're looking amen for his coming this verse and every man that hath this hope in him do you have that expectation in you Hallelujah this is what it is every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure this is why as God will speak to us guide us direct US minister to our heart because that Hope on the inside that expectation is for him we want to please him we want to walk in step with him and so he will come he'll correct us when we need correcting right and many of the times listen the correction itself this is where discernment comes in there's things where sometimes with discernment or correction it isn't altogether things coming out by word but it is actually sometimes that will be displayed through the lives of others God will display it the Bible Paul said these things were written for our amples discernment sometimes God might ask to you know borrow you and you might say if I was asking right here this morning hey anybody want to go out here on the lake today walk on the lake and manifest the glory of God by walking on a lake probably some people will say well long as I have a good windbreaker on today yeah man that that'd be wonderful but how many raise your hand and say when God said I want to display my my glory I'm going to have people spit on you talk bad about you I'm going to have sickness strike your body right goes goes on for months H how how how how many would want that no no no say Lord I I I take the first one walk walk on water Count Me In Jesus is that right that's where we would be right that's a truth for every one of us what is it the flesh the flesh part right but you see now when we look at this of how that the life would be displayed this is why that brother Bram just moving beyond this here and coming into a closing part this is why when he says when he expresses this in the message token he talks about even how we talk to our loved ones how we approach our homes he said apply it what's he talking about it the Holy Ghost the love of God he said apply it with such love remember what the Holy Ghost is it's the word of God right amen don't Sher Cod it right apply it with what such love well what does that mean does that mean it to have goop running off of it no love means the condition the confidence you have that what this word has done for me it'll do the same for them amen that's what's happened in our life all that God was he poured into Christ am all that Christ was he poured into the church this is the confidence that we have and this is why he said apply it when you talk to that loved one apply it apply it apply it apply it this word in verse three purifieth himself this word means to make pure cleanse to offer as a burnt sacrifice even as he is pure so what degree of purifying even as he is pure right which is that which is chased modest Immaculate there pure from carnality it shows it shows there would arise a need to purify even though when you've been born again that's why Jesus said he that is was washed save not need wash yet his feet only right he that is clean is clean indeed but there's times we still need washing purifying amen right once my soul has been sealed remember that's the Perfection of God in his love has been perfected the desire to please him that's been perfected in us but there's still the part that can be sticky the part about us that can have certain Tendencies although we've been delivered from that nature but we have a source a source of purifying and you know that source of cleansing and you make yourself available as a Living Sacrifice you know what a Living Sacrifice because if something's dead right you know brother Brian you got to carry it around and just put it up there it's just dead weight God says I don't want you to be a dead and we have to die to ourselves but now once that life is inside of us I want you as a Living Sacrifice right where there's things that you're having to sacrifice Hallelujah your will sacrifice your feelings yes Lord hello amen even Grievances and offenses oh those things are terrible I said they're terrible every one of us there's been grievances come our way offenses and whatever more it's terrible right this is where we need the purifying amen this is where we need the purifying we need cleansing from our lives this is a real process where in evil thoughts are dismissed listen now like the prophet chose to think different thoughts in each of these situations coming back to the foundation remember when the maniac came on the stage brother brandham remember he was he's a pretty good boxer he said I sized him him up are you with me right but he said something happened Hallelujah brother BR just he goes on and tells in another place he said that's not something I did he did that right but how did God do it remember he's a gentleman right he won't Force his way in you know what that tells me there's a place that we can live Hallelujah so surrendered and in tune with God to where God's able to step on the scene because brother Brian sometimes I don't know if there's a bull going to step up right I don't know if a bull will stand up in this assembly true I don't know what I don't know what we will come along but if we can live in such a place in our homes and other places live in such a place where we are feasting on his word what will that word do it cleanses us amen sanctify them Father through Thy word Thy word is truth sometimes that's sanctifying here it comes that purifying says you you you're leaning a little bit too much this way you need to let that go are you with me right it's purifying evil thoughts will come thoughts could be thoughts of hatred thoughts of detest thoughts of the things can come right hello somebody amen this is why there's got to be a purifying because this God didn't get the Holy Ghost your spirit didn't get the Holy Ghost but you see when that comes that's why there's a governing power on the inside that says I don't want to feel that way I don't want that rainning there I don't want that raining there it's not down in your soul but in your soul is the love of God yield to that and allow God to step on the scene and he is there to govern that sure it might be something you've got to pray over maybe it be something months you've got to pray over but you know why God said I've got a child on Earth they'll pray months over this or this you know why because they value my presence Hallelujah they value you're not just going to accept it like well I just seem like I can't get this or when I see this one or when I see this or when I see that oh when I no God brings us to a place of purifying amen why so that that channel remains open what channel the channel so the sovereignty of God Amen can be reflected through a son and daughter of God Lord amen Jesus said I sanctify myself for their sakes what love amen he did what he did for us Lord if I have this feeling as the prophet said your attitude toward a brother can determine his destination Lord I sanctify myself amen if that is not is that's not going to be over there perfect love is what's going to be over there right that's right so if that's not going to be over there and we've received the spirit of that life in here then why would we allow the enemy to somehow tell us you've got to suffer with this and pack this around the rest of your life he's a liar that's right I said he's a liar what should I do lay aside every weight amen yes and every sin that does so easily beset us and let us run hallelujah amen lot of people a lot of things came in the way of the Lord Jesus they called him El above they did everything else brother br said even while he was going to the Cross he packed the cross and he said there was the devil saying can't be the Son of God it can't be the Son of God man look there ain't no way that's a Son of God look at him the blood spots them growing together a Son of God would never stand for that brother Bram says oh no he's saying a Son of God will put up when he knows he's in the purpose and the will of God you love him amen this is why Peter would say sanctify the lord always in your hearts amen evil thoughts brother ra tells us this in a token he said evil thoughts come he said but show your token and put them out hallelujah amen I'm sorry you used to deliver that kind of male here that guy no longer lives here he don't feed on that kind of stuff no more hatred bitterness gossip all that other stuff oh yeah that that's who used to live here but you know what what he's been put out amen here's a Son of God with the Assurance of the Covenant it lives here now and that's not in the Covenant sorry RTS return to Satan right I don't want it amen so love of God purifying purifying ourselves even as he is pure aren't you glad that the word comes and corrects us amen aren't you glad the word searches us out so that our lives would be a peer offering unto him amen so that that channel might be open between us and him that's Discerning the love of God in situations whether it's a bull no matter what it is let us discern the love of God we're here for a purpose he redeemed you and me for a purpose that we are co-workers with him in Redemption you know what a day takes in order to redeem somebody let's say what all of a sudden to redeem maybe it's you know me and brother Gabriel and and Paul Paul and here we are and man we're just right there just just us two but then I look out there and I see brother Joey now I've got a decision do I say he's not in this that's not Redemption No Redemption says I'll go where you're at I'm going come over to you but I'll go where you at and I'll bring you in to where we are that's what Redemption does yes come on now amen that's how even Redemption works and an eternal life it works that way even in assembly right thank you Lord where we no longer live our lives just about us amen amen what's convenient for us what's best for us that's not Redemption Redemption could take into account and say maybe that brother needs a card maybe that you know what may maybe they need reached out to maybe they hello right I said hello right that's true Redemption oh my this is why brother Brandon would say I I'm closing I know I asked you give me a little bit of time brother Bon says when Jesus came that day on Calvary he said he did not live for himself his life was spent for others remember that order because you could do everything in the world for oh I did all this for the job I did all this for the family I did all this oh I do all this for the church but if God's not first none of it matters hello somebody none of it matters it's God first amen and when God's first everything else will be ordered even nose come out of your mouth brother Brian you think you can do this like I got a lot going on right now brother Samuel not going to be able to do that right now no now it ain't no knew you understand right why everything revolves around my time with him right that's true when you say you go to church and do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the L Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others amen someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become Sons right that's the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you are Sons you're taking Christ CHR place your sons don't live for yourself live for others brother renom I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it no live for that man who hates you I many to say Jesus help me live for that man who hates you live for the person who'd kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them oh my that's true wonder how many times brother banam had to die Hur hunting with birp just a thought right or when he stood there and the man who was a professed atheist said the problem I got with you preachers you're just barking up the wrong tree mhm now what if brother brandwood took offense to that right right hello amen you understand this was not what God demonstrated in this hour was not that we all would become Broms it wasn't brandom DNA that did this am this is the DNA of God this is the deity of God God sat down and took the form of a little Kyan amen God manifest his promise in this hour through that Veil called William Bram what did it do it got the attention of other Sons and Daughters of God to recognize that's part of the family tree that I'm a part of that same DNA is inside of me and you Hallelujah that's eternal life when you get that that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then you sacrifice your own things you give them up like the sheep gives its wool and you look towards [Music] Calvary say Lord Jesus help us Lord amen help us to discern the love of God Amen Lord theist same how how do I discerned by the Holy Spirit remember the first messages as we started in and I had no idea God was going to take us on this pathway strong meat belongeth to them that are full age right who have their senses exercised to discern Good and Evil evil what brings discernment the word of God you see how it easy this is why the enemy wants to try to draw us out like he wanted to try to draw brother brandom out go ahead and stand with me that's why the maniac came the way he did that's why the bull that's why the bees when they came the way they did now think of what brother BR said listen what he said if I have known that Hornet was there ahead of time I'd have took care of it but he said I didn't even know it was there I've been in and out so much gone and preaching say Brother Sam what are you saying I'm telling you that you don't go and try to impersonate anything like that when the fellow that comes here and does all the treatments at the church to make sure pests don't get in here and he showed up the one day and said um Pastor um what door are you plan on going out I said well I'm going to go out that door right there when I leave he said well you might want to choose a different door I said why he said because he said there is a big old yellow jacket Nest that's under there then he proceeded to tell me he said they they're different from paper wasp he said they look a lot but the antenna and all this stuff like that that's different he said now I'm going to spray that thing I'm going to dust it when he got out and I said well I'll tell you what I said I'll leave when you're leaving so when you get done you let me know he comes here monthly I said so I walked out it was right underneath that steps now what if I have told him you know what we don't need that here we're Believers you know we had a prophet that you know there was a hornet nest man he told them Hornets to go back in he didn't know they were there he said if I had known they were there I would have already removed them but s what are you saying I'm saying that the the expression of this comes out not because we're out there to prove it it's because a need arises oh my I want to Brother s I just want to manifest that part as a son and daughter of God that love then God says the love between you and I yeah yeah then God lets tests and Trials come he's not worried about you and me but he lets that be displayed you see the test of trial the test of trial doesn't prove anything to God it molds and shapes us helps us to realize it's him that's in control and to recognize there's a greater hold on us than we even we could even fathom and then situ ations arise in our life and say Lord I Want More Love I want more patience he says okay then this is what has to come remember the virtues that are so sealed in our life by the spirit of God the virtues do not come out in times of peace they come out in times of adversity that's when Sons and Daughters of God Shine the brightest is is in the midst of these times say Lord help me you see if we keep the purpose brother Joe if we keep the purpose we keep our eyes set we're here till everyone comes in I got a quote right here this morning where brother brandham was talking about the president that's coming on and he says Lord he said we might be at a place that we were getting ready to change presidents he said may you he said as you anointed kings in the past may you anoint the man for the hour and here's the thing that it goes on to say with the objective that if you would give us that Grace for a little longer it's so that we might win all of the souls that are to be won for the kingdom of God if there ever was a time we could say that we see the two different Pathways is that right but you see what's the objective until the last one comes in that's the objective am see if we've got one purpose then sure when bowls rise up things stand up and offenses come things come in our life but if we've got it lined up and say Lord you help me Lord I don't know how I'm going to cross this pasture I don't know how to do this Lord I don't know how to get through this and you go to back to that it's not there I'm I'm used to acting this way in this time I'm used to and you're I left it no no no God seen to it you let it down hallelujah what was happening as you're feeding on the word you didn't realize brother Brian he's causing you to lay that gun right down on this seat things that maybe you normally brother Crest normally would have and you realized wait a minute wait a minute what's been happening the word has been molding you shaping you amen and let me tell you something he's prepared us brother William he's prepared us brother Shane he's prepared us for this moment that's right we've been placed here for such a time as this let's pray Heavenly Father help us Lord all throughout this assembly those streaming Lord you know every single need in the hearts of your children dear God I pray if there's one here that does not have has not received that love of God in the place of perfection where it comes down into their soul may they recognize that that's for them Lord may I pray this morning their faith have grown a little bit more Lord Jesus we know it's a sovereign work and Lord God may they just just simply just say Lord I Give Myself Lord I I I want I want all of me to be in the hands of you Lord I think of Lord how brother Bram talked about when he came back home Rebecca was a little taller than Sarah and he said Rebecca she came running in there she got a hold of her daddy she grabbed him around the neck and he said little Sarah she was so short she really couldn't run that fast but she was standing off there and he said Rebecca turned around and said Sarah I got all of daddy there's none for you and he said about that time he said I saw her little lip quiver and I motioned to her said come here honey Oh Glory little Sarah ran over there brother brandham reached down his arm like a father would pick up that child put him on the knee he had his arm complet complely around little Sarah and Sarah recognizing that she looked over at Rebecca he said Rebeca my sister you might have all of daddy but I want you to know that Daddy's got all of me Lord Jesus if there's one here this morning Lord God in their soul would be trembling like lips quivering Lord may they Lord heed to the beckoning call of the love of God and say Lord Jesus take all of me I want you to have all of me there's nothing that compares to you Lord I want the love of God to Soul fill every area of my [Music] life Lord Jesus I look across this assembly I see different ones lord they're my elders I look at them Lord with such great respect and admiration I know the tests and trials just a little bit of test and trials that I've come through is in no comparison to the amount nor the magnitude that they've come through but I know the same grace that brought them through the same love of God that has burned in their hearts at times that they didn't know what to do when the bull might stand up different things would arise no no doubt I know they've had to purify themselves by having an access to a washing of Water by the word wash away grievances wash away offenses oh don't take it out of the memory but it's so puts it back into place because it takes the sting out of it Lord Jesus I pray right here or over on the internet this morning as hearts Lord are lifted up to you say Lord as a son and daughter of God I don't want the channel to be closed off I don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit I don't want to be shut off to where the life of the Covenant is not flowing in my life the way it ought to be I don't want to be cut off from fellowship but Lord help me I want to walk realizing offenses realizing situations realizing things that will come but Lord renew my vision let my focus be upon you let me think different thoughts let me give my brother and my sister the benefit of the doubt Grant it Lord we love you Lord Jesus help us to discern the love of God we need your help Lord we're not standing here this morning because we are perfect in the sense that my we've done everything just right no Lord we stand here we have failed there's been many times Lord we have fallen short sometimes Lord of feelings Lord that have arose in our life we've allowed them to linger forgive us Lord Jesus help us I pray Lord Lord hallelu oh great Holy Spirit Lord maybe somebody's on the road this morning they're wounded will you just pick them up take them to the end Minister the oil to their life help them Lord God not to suppress that wound no no no no no but to allow the spirit of God to deal with that wound to deal with that hurt clean out the debris that God has been affecting their life granted Lord Jesus May the Holy Spirit just move down may we just open Lord God ourselves and say holy spirit brood brood Over Me Lord Wash Me Lord cleanse me if I've got a wound debris me Lord God pour the oil in Lord God take to that in my life I give myself to you I don't want to go on any longer with that wound I don't want to walk any longer with that bitterness I don't want that Lord in my life cuz it keeps you out of my life it affects my brothers and sisters it affect my home and affect everybody around me Lord I want to walk in fellowship and Union and harmony with you Lord that that atmosphere that Creator on the inside of me Lord God creates that atmosphere fear as your Prophet would tell us apply that token that'll create an atmosphere that they will fall into it Grant it Lord I pray is that your desire this
