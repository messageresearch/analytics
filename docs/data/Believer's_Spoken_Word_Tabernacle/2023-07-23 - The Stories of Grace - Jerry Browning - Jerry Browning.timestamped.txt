[42:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ and to the
[42:47] glory of God
[42:49] well I understand if you return me in
[42:51] your Bibles to Matthew chapter 1.
[42:56] and
[42:57] what I would title this this morning is
[43:00] stories of Grace
[43:03] stories of Grace
[43:07] Matthew chapter one begin reading at
[43:10] verse 1.
[43:13] the book of the generation of Jesus
[43:15] Christ the son of David the son of
[43:17] Abraham
[43:18] Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac beget
[43:21] Jacob and Jacob Judas and his brother
[43:24] and Judas beget Ferris and Zara of Tamar
[43:29] and Ferris baguette SRAM and estrom
[43:32] baguette amram and amram
[43:37] baguette salmon
[43:39] and Samoan beget Boaz of Rahab
[43:42] and Boaz beget Obed of Ruth
[43:46] and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse beget
[43:49] David the king and David the king beget
[43:52] Solomon of her who had been the wife of
[43:55] your eyes now just drop down to verse 16
[43:58] and Jacob beget Joseph the husband of
[44:02] Mary whom was born Jesus who is called
[44:05] Christ
[44:06] you may be seated
[44:10] now there's many verses we just kind of
[44:12] passed over because it's it we wanted to
[44:16] focus on these particular verses
[44:18] but out of this being the genealogy
[44:22] of Jesus Christ in that genealogy
[44:26] there's only mentioned five women
[44:29] and we know there was more women
[44:30] involved than that
[44:32] everywhere you see somebody begets
[44:34] somebody it was through somebody
[44:37] and uh but uh you know Sarah wasn't
[44:42] mentioned
[44:43] you know and she was the mother of Isaac
[44:46] and uh
[44:48] uh then Rebecca wasn't mentioned and she
[44:52] was the mother of Jacob
[44:55] and these different ones that were would
[44:58] have seemed to have been uh very pure
[45:01] people very pure women they weren't
[45:04] mentioned
[45:05] but there were only five women's names
[45:07] that were mentioned in the genealogy of
[45:10] Jesus Christ and four of those women
[45:13] that were mentioned were Gentiles they
[45:16] weren't even Jews
[45:18] and of these of four of the five that
[45:20] were mentioned were very far less than
[45:24] virtuous
[45:25] they were there was there was something
[45:28] about each of their backgrounds that
[45:31] actually when you consider their stories
[45:34] you can say nothing but the grace of God
[45:39] and when we look at the first one where
[45:43] it says Judas beget Ferris of Tamar uh
[45:47] Tamar was actually the daughter-in-law
[45:50] of Judas and she had been married to
[45:54] judah's uh oldest son who was ER and the
[46:00] Bible says the Earth did evil in the
[46:03] eyes of the Lord and and the Lord took
[46:07] his life he killed him
[46:09] and so then according to how things were
[46:13] to be in the law then Judah was then in
[46:16] turn to give Tamar because ER had there
[46:21] were no uh children and so it was to
[46:24] give her to his next uh son uh the
[46:29] brother of UR who was Onan and he was to
[46:33] braise up seed to his brother
[46:35] and so Judah did this and Onan knowing
[46:40] that it was going to raise up seed to
[46:42] his brother spilled his seed on the
[46:44] ground
[46:45] and that was evil in the eyes of the
[46:48] Lord and so he killed Onan
[46:50] and so here there was one son laughed
[46:53] named Sheila and he was too young
[46:57] to take uh uh Tamar to be his wife and
[47:02] to have children so Judah told Tamar
[47:05] said go back to your father's house and
[47:07] wait till Sheila comes of age and when
[47:09] he comes of age then I'll give you to
[47:12] Sheila and he'll raise up seed to his
[47:14] brother and so Tamar did as she was told
[47:18] went back to her father's house and and
[47:21] while she was abiding there well then
[47:23] Sheila came of age but after Sheila came
[47:25] of age Judah for whatever reason didn't
[47:29] didn't uh keep his promise perhaps Judah
[47:33] thought I've already lost two sons to
[47:35] this woman something must be wrong with
[47:36] her I don't want to lose my only son I
[47:39] got left and so he refused to keep his
[47:42] promise and so then time passed and
[47:46] judah's wife had died and the Bible says
[47:50] and Judah then went to sheer sheep and
[47:54] while he was going to share sheep why uh
[47:58] Tamar was told behold your father-in-law
[48:00] goes to share the sheep in teneth and so
[48:04] she goes and she disguised herself and
[48:08] covers her face and sets by the way and
[48:11] and and actually Judah thinks she's a
[48:15] harlot
[48:16] so Judah goes in unto her and lays with
[48:20] her and then uh he he says while I she's
[48:25] a wife got to pay you and so he says
[48:29] I'll send you a kid from my flock and
[48:32] she says but uh uh you know you've got
[48:36] to give me some kind of a a token or
[48:40] something that you until you send the
[48:42] kid he said well what can I give you and
[48:46] she said well give me your Signet what
[48:48] your Signet was like a ring that would
[48:51] they would Mark and that was as good as
[48:53] their name
[48:54] and she said give me your Signet give me
[48:56] your bracelets and give me your staff
[48:58] and all these things were peculiar to
[49:02] each man and she says give me those
[49:05] things and then when you send the kid
[49:07] off give them back and so he gives them
[49:10] to her and then when he returns home he
[49:13] sends his sermon his servant to uh back
[49:17] down with the the little kid to the from
[49:20] his flock to give to her when he gets
[49:23] there he can't find her anywhere
[49:25] and you know she had went back and took
[49:27] the veil off and put back on her
[49:29] garments of widowhood and they couldn't
[49:31] find this supposed Harlot anywhere and
[49:36] so his servant returns to him and and
[49:38] tells Judah says she can't be found and
[49:41] Judah says why you know that's going to
[49:43] be a bad Mark against me he said uh uh
[49:47] I've got to make sure she gets his skin
[49:49] and I've got to get my my possessions
[49:51] back
[49:52] and so they can't find her and then as
[49:56] time passes you know and and perhaps
[49:59] Tamar becomes uh in her uh pregnancy to
[50:04] where you know there's telltale signs
[50:06] something's going on here and so uh word
[50:09] gets back to Judah and says your
[50:12] daughter-in-laws played the Harlot and
[50:14] she's with child from her Hortons and so
[50:17] Judah says well you bring her here said
[50:21] she's going to die for this
[50:23] and so they bring uh Tamar up to Judah
[50:27] and when she gets there she presents him
[50:30] with his own Signet his own bracelets
[50:32] and his own staff and says the whoever
[50:35] the man is that these belong to that's
[50:37] who I'm with child with and Judah
[50:40] recognized them of course to be his own
[50:42] and he says she was more righteous than
[50:45] I am he said because I refuse to give
[50:48] her to Sheila my son
[50:51] and so uh she puts off her garments of
[50:54] widowhood and the Bible says Judah never
[50:57] knew her again and uh but uh that then
[51:02] she has this child
[51:05] and you realize
[51:07] that it was God she didn't go to have
[51:11] this affair with Judah because of some
[51:13] fleshly desire but there was something
[51:16] inside of of Tamar that was driving her
[51:20] and you know what it was it was God
[51:23] because he couldn't let the lion of
[51:26] Judah fall off
[51:28] and so he had to something had to take
[51:32] place so that the line from Judah
[51:35] because remember friends that was where
[51:38] the Christ was supposed to come from
[51:41] remember he was supposed to be the lion
[51:44] of the tribe of Judah and so it was God
[51:48] that had moved on Tamar to do what she
[51:50] did and also remember Tamar was a
[51:54] Canaanite and the Canaanites were cursed
[51:57] people because of the the the the the
[51:59] the son of Noah that ham who had went in
[52:05] and saw his father's nakedness and come
[52:08] back and told his brothers and his
[52:10] brothers uh turned with the uh cloth and
[52:14] walked backwards into the cave where
[52:17] their father was and covered him up and
[52:19] the Bible says they saw not his
[52:21] nakedness but when Noah came back to
[52:24] himself he realized what his son Hammond
[52:27] did and he cursed not ham but he cursed
[52:31] Ham's son Canaan and he said curse will
[52:35] be Canaan for what you've done
[52:38] and so Tamar came from a cursed people
[52:45] right ma the grace of God
[52:50] why would God allow someone to have been
[52:53] from a cursed people to be part of the
[52:57] lineage of of the Messiah
[53:00] but he did why because he's a God full
[53:04] of Mercy
[53:07] and Tamar being a Canaanite she was a
[53:12] gentile
[53:14] and so when Tamar uh she was pregnant
[53:18] with twins and when the boys went to be
[53:22] born why one of them stuck forth its
[53:25] hand and when it did the the the Midwife
[53:29] that was there took and tied a Scarlet
[53:31] thread around his hand
[53:33] and but then he pulls the hand back and
[53:37] his brother comes out and so the Midwife
[53:40] says this breach be upon you and
[53:43] therefore his name was called Ferris
[53:45] which means the breach
[53:47] and so you realize something here
[53:50] something was going on within the womb
[53:53] of Tamar that Ferris it was supposed to
[53:57] be through Ferris where Judah as
[54:00] offspring would come where that would be
[54:04] in the lineage of Christ and so there's
[54:06] a struggle that happened within her womb
[54:08] who was going to be born first
[54:12] because everything went to the firstborn
[54:19] so we see even the hand of God working
[54:21] there
[54:22] in this birth
[54:27] then the next woman we find that's
[54:30] mentioned in the genealogy of Christ is
[54:33] Rahab
[54:35] now Rahab was a harlot in Jericho
[54:41] brother Branham said there was some
[54:43] Misfortune in life that had then she was
[54:47] a pagan there was some Misfortune in
[54:50] life that had forced her into that way
[54:53] of life
[54:56] but she didn't have to stay there
[54:58] she chose not to stay into what life had
[55:02] seemingly forced upon her
[55:05] and she uh when the Joshua had sent out
[55:10] the spies to come and spy out uh the the
[55:14] city of Jericho where there was two
[55:16] young men that came and when they came
[55:19] then the king of Jericho heard about it
[55:22] and so he wanted despise to be brought
[55:25] before him no doubt to kill them
[55:28] so they couldn't take any word back from
[55:30] of the city back to their leader and so
[55:34] she Rahab the Harlot took the two spies
[55:38] and she hid them on a roof under Flats
[55:42] and when they came to inquire said
[55:45] someone saw these two men come into your
[55:49] house and she said they've left and
[55:51] they've left the city
[55:53] and so when the men that were seeking
[55:57] him left she told the young men she says
[55:59] now you you need to leave she says but
[56:03] look she said I've saved your life and
[56:06] she says and I hope that you will in
[56:08] kindness then look upon me and my family
[56:11] and when you come to take over the city
[56:15] that you'll save us she said because we
[56:19] have heard of Israel and we have heard
[56:22] of all of the Conquering of Israel and
[56:26] we have heard that truly there is a God
[56:29] that is alive in Israel and she said and
[56:33] I want to I want to me and my family to
[56:36] be saved and so she let them down from
[56:39] her window because her her dwelling was
[56:43] actually on the wall of Jericho and she
[56:46] let them down by a car a scarlet cord
[56:50] and they said are your Our Lives for
[56:54] yours you've saved us so said you put
[56:57] this card hang it from your window and
[57:01] when you do when it's Saul anyone sees
[57:04] it then they'll spare you and all that
[57:07] are under this scarlet cord
[57:10] and so Rahab takes and she publicly
[57:13] displays this scarlet cord from her
[57:17] window a public display not something
[57:20] done in secret but it was out to the
[57:24] public I have a token here
[57:26] [Music]
[57:28] and that's the same way with the
[57:29] believer today friends you've come under
[57:32] the blood of Jesus Christ and the blood
[57:35] is your token
[57:36] the blood of Jesus Christ then is on
[57:40] public display
[57:42] Hallelujah then you and your life are on
[57:46] public display and it shall see the
[57:49] scarlet cord showed that something had
[57:52] happened on the inside of that house and
[57:56] you with your token displayed the Holy
[57:59] Spirit it shows that something has
[58:02] happened on the inside of your house
[58:05] all right
[58:07] the Bible says by faith the Harley Rahab
[58:11] perished not with them that believe not
[58:13] when she had received the spies with
[58:16] peace
[58:22] brother Adam said
[58:24] talking about rehab and why little
[58:26] Bethlehem said when she got the first
[58:29] message
[58:30] from two preachers that went over there
[58:32] quickly she accepted with all her heart
[58:34] and there was a scarlet cord bound to
[58:37] her window for a protection of her house
[58:38] because she had received the message
[58:43] he said she was the type of the Gentile
[58:46] Church she was a gentile
[58:48] and when we heard the message we were
[58:52] all out in spiritual prostitution
[58:54] committing spiritual fornications
[58:55] against the god of Heaven in all kinds
[58:58] of stuff and all kinds of denominations
[59:00] and religions but when we heard that
[59:02] there was a God that still lived that
[59:04] could perform Miracles quickly we
[59:07] received the message
[59:08] [Music]
[59:12] Hallelujah
[59:15] and you know the the walls of Jericho
[59:19] were very thick
[59:21] and Jericho depended on their walls that
[59:26] were built around them to to protect
[59:28] them against any Siege or any uh hostile
[59:33] takeover
[59:34] and so they came and remembered you
[59:38] remember the story I won't take a lot of
[59:39] time on it how they came and according
[59:42] to the words of of the angel for the
[59:44] Lord they marched around the city for
[59:47] seven days and each day they marched
[59:50] around it once and on the seventh day
[59:51] they marched around it seven times and
[59:53] after they had marched around at seven
[59:55] times they let out a a a a holler and a
[59:59] screaming and a rejoicing and the sounds
[1:00:03] of the trumpets and so forth and when
[1:00:06] they did the walls came down and I want
[1:00:09] you to know something friends Rahab
[1:00:11] lived her house was in the walls of
[1:00:14] Jericho and when God's power shook the
[1:00:18] walls of Jericho every part of the Wall
[1:00:21] came down except the part that Rahab
[1:00:25] lived in because she had come under the
[1:00:28] message of the hour and accepted the
[1:00:31] message of the hour and by accepting it
[1:00:33] it's saved her
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:39] that wasn't the end of her story
[1:00:43] there was a captain a prince from the
[1:00:48] house of Judah that was in Israel and
[1:00:51] his name was Salman
[1:00:53] and Solomon you know brother Adam said
[1:00:56] there started a great romance between
[1:00:59] Rahab and salmon
[1:01:02] and then salmon took Rahab to be his
[1:01:06] wife
[1:01:07] now think about this friends a prince of
[1:01:10] Judah taking a woman who had been a
[1:01:13] harlot to be his wife
[1:01:16] it shows the grace of God because
[1:01:19] friends shall moan was a representation
[1:01:23] of Christ
[1:01:26] and Rahab being a gentile was a
[1:01:29] representation of the Bride
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:35] there was nothing clean about us
[1:01:39] but God took us and cleaned us up
[1:01:44] Hallelujah
[1:01:47] and then you know when they begin to
[1:01:50] just settle the estate uh once they had
[1:01:54] come into the land and begin to settle
[1:01:56] the Estates of of Israel why uh salmon
[1:02:01] was given a land that was very fertile
[1:02:06] and the lamb was so fertile that It
[1:02:09] produced wheat uh abundance of wheat
[1:02:13] and salmon founded a city there in this
[1:02:18] uh land that was so fertile and called
[1:02:22] the city Bethlehem
[1:02:25] and Bethlehem meaning the house of God's
[1:02:28] bread
[1:02:29] and then it's so fitting that Christ
[1:02:32] himself would be born then in Bethlehem
[1:02:41] what a great romance they had
[1:02:43] and a great Obedience of faith
[1:02:46] that Rahab
[1:02:51] did
[1:02:52] in Boaz was born
[1:02:58] then we come to the story of Ruth
[1:03:01] now Ruth was a mobite
[1:03:05] and she was the daughter-in-law of Naomi
[1:03:11] and uh you know
[1:03:14] Naomi and her husband of course were
[1:03:17] Israelites but their sons took wives of
[1:03:22] the moabites
[1:03:23] now you've got to go way back in time
[1:03:26] back to the destruction of Sodom to find
[1:03:29] where the moabites came from
[1:03:31] and where the mobots came from you
[1:03:33] remember when the Angels come down to
[1:03:35] take lot out of Sodom and they took lot
[1:03:38] and his and his wife and his two
[1:03:40] daughters remember Lot's wife looked
[1:03:42] back and she turned to a pillar of salt
[1:03:44] and so then there was just lot and his
[1:03:47] two daughters and his two daughters got
[1:03:50] to talking and said our father's seed
[1:03:52] line is going to fail right here because
[1:03:56] remember friends they had been married
[1:03:59] but were still virgins and and and if
[1:04:02] you follow the story through the
[1:04:05] destruction of Sodom and so on you can
[1:04:08] see why they were still virgins being
[1:04:10] married because the city was plumbed
[1:04:13] full of homosexuality
[1:04:17] right I know that's not a popular thing
[1:04:20] to say today in this climate in this
[1:04:22] world but it's the word of God
[1:04:25] and God still feels the same way about
[1:04:28] it as he did back then
[1:04:31] and so these Daughters of block they may
[1:04:35] they devised a plan each of them would
[1:04:38] take a turn and go in and lay with their
[1:04:40] father and would have a child by their
[1:04:43] father and so the oldest daughter goes
[1:04:45] in and she has a child a son is born to
[1:04:50] her by her father and his name was Moe
[1:04:53] and that's where the mobites came from
[1:04:55] the mobites came from incest
[1:04:59] and Ruth was a mobite
[1:05:03] why would God want somebody of roots
[1:05:07] caliber to be in his genealogy it's
[1:05:11] because brother Branham said a person
[1:05:14] can be born from the two worst parents
[1:05:18] in the in the city but that has nothing
[1:05:21] to do with their predestination and soul
[1:05:29] Bruce lineage coming from the moabites
[1:05:32] had nothing to do with her selection by
[1:05:35] God God chose her friends because there
[1:05:38] was something inside her it was a CG of
[1:05:42] God
[1:05:43] good time
[1:05:46] notice the faith of Ruth
[1:05:50] she's told by mother-in-law you know
[1:05:52] their husbands died the two girls the
[1:05:55] the Ruth and her and her sister-in-law
[1:05:58] their husbands died and her mother said
[1:06:00] I'm too old to have any more uh Sons for
[1:06:03] you and said even if I did and had him
[1:06:06] today you know you know would you wait
[1:06:09] around for him until they become of age
[1:06:11] she said just go back home to your
[1:06:13] fathers go back to your father's house
[1:06:15] go back to the denomination of moabites
[1:06:19] you came from
[1:06:20] and the the sister-in-law did she turned
[1:06:23] and went back
[1:06:25] but Ruth said I'll not go back
[1:06:29] she said
[1:06:31] wherever thou goest I will go
[1:06:35] God people shall be my people and thy
[1:06:39] God shall be my God
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:45] now that's not just wrote in this
[1:06:48] scripture because it was a beautiful
[1:06:50] phrase it was wrote in the scripture to
[1:06:52] show you the faith of this woman she had
[1:06:56] faith and she knew who was the real God
[1:06:59] and she said thy God shall be my God
[1:07:03] foreign
[1:07:07] so then Naomi says
[1:07:10] there is a Kinsman
[1:07:12] a near Kinsman of my husband
[1:07:15] that might redeem you
[1:07:17] and so she sends her to go glean in in
[1:07:22] the field of uh Boaz
[1:07:26] and Boaz coming along sees this young
[1:07:30] mobitis woman
[1:07:32] uh I'll glean you know what gleaning in
[1:07:34] the fields meant they would send out the
[1:07:36] young men and they would actually
[1:07:38] harvest the grain
[1:07:40] and then whatever got fell on the ground
[1:07:43] and got left uh there why women would
[1:07:47] come out into the field and they would
[1:07:50] pick up what had fallen They Were
[1:07:52] Gleaming
[1:07:53] and so and and and they were allowed to
[1:07:56] glean because of under the law they
[1:08:00] could glean that and that was to be
[1:08:01] taken to be theirs so that they can make
[1:08:04] bread and eat
[1:08:05] and so Boaz saw her so he instructed the
[1:08:09] young men let a little bit more of the
[1:08:11] grain fall
[1:08:14] touch not this young woman thank you
[1:08:19] and so Ruth returns and tells her
[1:08:22] mother-in-law about what had happened
[1:08:24] about this man Boaz that owned this this
[1:08:28] this land where she was gleaning
[1:08:30] and she said he's in near Kinsman to my
[1:08:33] husband and so she gave Ruth instruction
[1:08:37] how to go and says and when he lays down
[1:08:40] at night and you lay down at his feet
[1:08:43] and take his skirt and pull it over you
[1:08:45] and she did as she was instructed and
[1:08:48] when she did then Boaz awoke and
[1:08:50] realized there was a woman there at his
[1:08:52] feet he asked her who are you
[1:08:58] and she tells him I I need
[1:09:02] you know and so she says I need a
[1:09:06] Kinsman
[1:09:07] and she tells about Naomi's property
[1:09:11] needing to be redeemed that was owned by
[1:09:14] Naomi's husband and about herself you
[1:09:17] know and and and that and so Boaz says
[1:09:20] well there is one Kinsman that's nearer
[1:09:23] than I but I'll inquire of him and see
[1:09:25] if he's willing to redeem you if not
[1:09:27] I'll stand him redeem you
[1:09:31] ah
[1:09:32] and so Boaz comes down and makes a
[1:09:36] public display before the Gate of the
[1:09:38] city and takes off his shoe and throws
[1:09:41] his shoe down and declares that he is
[1:09:44] redeeming all that it had belonged to
[1:09:47] Naomi and Naomi's husband and thereby
[1:09:50] friends look he redeemed the land in
[1:09:54] order to get to this ride
[1:09:59] Hallelujah
[1:10:00] and so
[1:10:02] Christ was our near Kinsmen
[1:10:07] we had to have someone that was a near
[1:10:10] kin to us
[1:10:12] and God was our nearest kin because we
[1:10:15] came from God
[1:10:16] but it couldn't stop there to become a
[1:10:20] near Kinsman to us God had to come down
[1:10:23] and take upon himself the same flesh
[1:10:26] that man blood that we walk around in so
[1:10:30] that he can become us
[1:10:34] and being near Kinsmen to us and to
[1:10:37] redeem us
[1:10:38] and he not only redeemed us he redeemed
[1:10:41] the whole world
[1:10:43] he redeemed the Earth
[1:10:47] he redeemed heaven
[1:10:49] he redeemed all the names that had been
[1:10:52] and all the names that would be
[1:10:54] all the names that were written on the
[1:10:57] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:11:03] Ruth was a perfect type
[1:11:05] of the Gentile bride
[1:11:09] Hallelujah
[1:11:12] then we come down to the story of
[1:11:15] Bathsheba
[1:11:17] now
[1:11:18] David being King
[1:11:22] there was a time that David sent his
[1:11:25] armies of Israel down to destroy the
[1:11:28] children of Ammon
[1:11:30] and they were also to besiege the city
[1:11:33] of rabba
[1:11:35] and then he sent them down there and
[1:11:38] while they were down there David went up
[1:11:40] and he walked on the roof you know like
[1:11:42] he always did in the evenings and while
[1:11:44] he was walking on the roof he looked
[1:11:46] over down on another roof and he sees a
[1:11:49] beautiful woman coming out to bathe and
[1:11:54] David looks on her friends and David
[1:11:55] lusted after her
[1:11:58] and so David sins for her to come to the
[1:12:02] Palace you know and you obey what the
[1:12:06] king says so she comes and you know I
[1:12:10] don't know the Bible doesn't tell you
[1:12:12] exactly what took place you know but uh
[1:12:15] uh how it came to be but anyway David
[1:12:18] ended up laying with Bathsheba
[1:12:21] another man's wife
[1:12:24] that was adultery
[1:12:28] and adultery
[1:12:30] was an adulterer or an adulterous words
[1:12:33] to be killed they were to be stoned if
[1:12:36] they were found according to the law
[1:12:38] and so then he sends her back to her
[1:12:41] house and then word comes back to him
[1:12:43] from her I'm with child
[1:12:48] what's David going to do
[1:12:50] somehow he's got to cover up his sin
[1:12:52] he's human
[1:12:55] well humans are like that we're all like
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:58] we always tried to cover up our sin
[1:13:02] so David tries to cover it up and what
[1:13:04] he does is he says um boy uh you need to
[1:13:08] send for Uriah and make him come back
[1:13:10] from the battle and come back here to to
[1:13:13] Jerusalem and so Uriah who was a hittite
[1:13:17] he comes back and when he comes back
[1:13:20] David says you know go in and see your
[1:13:23] wife
[1:13:24] and so but then word comes to David that
[1:13:28] Uriah refuse to go home but instead he'd
[1:13:31] laid down in in the door with the
[1:13:34] servants
[1:13:35] and so he brings Uriah in and he feeds
[1:13:38] him and gives him something to drink and
[1:13:40] says go home and be with your wife
[1:13:42] and Uriah walks out and lays down to
[1:13:45] give the search and refuses to go home
[1:13:48] to be with his wife he said I'll not do
[1:13:50] it while the men of Israel are out in
[1:13:53] battle I'll not go into my wife
[1:13:57] so David says well my plan didn't work
[1:14:01] so he has to devise another plan to try
[1:14:03] to cover this up
[1:14:05] and so quickly now he has to do this
[1:14:07] quickly
[1:14:08] you know because it it don't take very
[1:14:12] many months before a pregnancy begins to
[1:14:14] show so he's got to do something quickly
[1:14:17] you know people can get to counting up
[1:14:20] on their calendar
[1:14:22] and so he's he sends word out to his
[1:14:26] captain and says send Uriah up to the
[1:14:30] front of the battle
[1:14:31] where they're besieging this city send
[1:14:35] him up to the front where the arrows are
[1:14:38] the thickest
[1:14:41] and so he sends Uriah up there and Uriah
[1:14:45] of course dies he gets killed
[1:14:49] in this Siege of the city
[1:14:52] and David's Captain you know says uh
[1:14:56] send a servant back uh to him a
[1:14:58] messenger to tell David that Uriah has
[1:15:02] died
[1:15:04] he says now if the King asks you why did
[1:15:07] we send him up there to the front where
[1:15:09] the arrows was the thickest you were
[1:15:11] mine the king that we did it on his
[1:15:12] order
[1:15:14] and so he goes back and he tells King
[1:15:17] David he says uh Uriah is dead
[1:15:20] so David wipes his brown and says hey
[1:15:23] you all sin for Bathsheba I'm bringing
[1:15:25] her up here to be my wife
[1:15:27] that way nobody can count on the
[1:15:29] calendar and figure out my sin
[1:15:31] and so he brings her up there to be his
[1:15:34] wife
[1:15:35] and nobody in Israel is the wiser
[1:15:39] but there's an All-Seeing Eye
[1:15:42] that's always watching and knows
[1:15:44] everything
[1:15:45] we might think we've got our sin here
[1:15:47] but there's always one that knows all
[1:15:49] about it
[1:15:52] and so the prophet Nathan is sent by the
[1:15:55] Lord up to talk to David
[1:15:57] and he comes up to David and he says
[1:15:59] I've got a story to tell you
[1:16:01] he said there was a traveler that come
[1:16:03] through
[1:16:04] and said there was a rich man who had
[1:16:07] many flocks and much cattle
[1:16:10] and there was a poor man that only had
[1:16:12] one lamb and he said the rich man was
[1:16:15] going to entertain this traveler and so
[1:16:17] he goes down and takes the one lamb from
[1:16:20] the poor man and slays that one lamb to
[1:16:23] feed him
[1:16:25] and the Bible says David's anger was
[1:16:28] kindled against this man
[1:16:30] and he said you bring that man up here
[1:16:33] surely he's going to die and he's going
[1:16:35] to pay back what he did
[1:16:38] Nathan looks at him and says you're the
[1:16:41] man
[1:16:46] he said God gave you the kingdom
[1:16:50] and God give you wives
[1:16:53] and said and here you went down and you
[1:16:57] took one man's wife and lay with her
[1:17:01] he said you have done evil in the eyes
[1:17:05] of the Lord
[1:17:07] now friends
[1:17:08] David didn't say wait a minute now
[1:17:11] Bathsheba knows I walked there up there
[1:17:13] on the roof she knew I was going to be
[1:17:15] up there it's her fault nope
[1:17:18] David didn't say that David took the
[1:17:20] blame
[1:17:22] he said I have sinned he didn't say we
[1:17:25] have sinned he said I have sinned
[1:17:29] and he repented
[1:17:31] and Nathan gets the word from the Lord
[1:17:33] and he says the Lord hath removed your
[1:17:37] sin
[1:17:38] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:42] and he said surely you will not die
[1:17:47] he said but the child that was conceived
[1:17:49] in this act that child will die
[1:17:54] and so David goes before the Lord and He
[1:17:57] pleads for the child you know and though
[1:18:00] he stays and they tried to get him to
[1:18:02] eat they tried to get him to drink but
[1:18:04] David won't get up he's prospered
[1:18:06] himself on his face and he won't get up
[1:18:09] and then word comes to him says the
[1:18:11] child has died and so David gets up and
[1:18:15] he goes and turns and says well now I'll
[1:18:17] eat and they said while the child was
[1:18:20] living said you stayed there praying but
[1:18:23] now that he's gone you get up and you
[1:18:25] eat like you're rejoicing David says
[1:18:27] there's nothing I can do for him now and
[1:18:29] he says I can't bring him back where I
[1:18:31] am but I can go to where he is
[1:18:35] Hallelujah why because of the grace of
[1:18:37] God
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:42] I want to tell you a little bit more
[1:18:45] about David
[1:18:47] David was the youngest of eight Sons
[1:18:55] but God chose David
[1:18:58] remember he brings he he sends Samuel
[1:19:01] God sends Samuel up there to the house
[1:19:04] of Jesse and says from the house because
[1:19:05] remember what happened was Saul was
[1:19:08] supposed to go and kill the all of the
[1:19:11] malachites and kill their King agag and
[1:19:14] Saul doesn't kill the king he brings him
[1:19:17] back he was supposed to kill all the
[1:19:19] animals he doesn't he brings back the
[1:19:21] best
[1:19:22] and Samuel comes up there and Saul says
[1:19:25] I have kept all the word of the Lord he
[1:19:27] said if you have what's that loading of
[1:19:29] the ox I hear
[1:19:31] and he says oh well the people you know
[1:19:35] they saved the best to sacrifice
[1:19:39] see saw a man he could never take
[1:19:42] responsibility for his own actions and
[1:19:45] his own sin
[1:19:47] it sounds a whole lot like a lot of
[1:19:49] people out there today
[1:19:51] they can't people today don't want to
[1:19:53] take responsibility for their actions
[1:19:55] it's always somebody else's fault
[1:19:59] and then because of what he'd done
[1:20:03] the Lord speaks through Samuel and says
[1:20:06] this day hap the Lord rent The Kingdom
[1:20:09] from thy hands and is given to Thy
[1:20:12] Neighbor
[1:20:13] and it says the Lord has sought him a
[1:20:16] man after his own heart to be captained
[1:20:20] over his people
[1:20:22] now
[1:20:23] the Bible in the book of Acts
[1:20:26] where is speaking it says uh
[1:20:30] that David that he raised up David to be
[1:20:33] their King to whom also he gave
[1:20:35] testimony and said I have found David
[1:20:36] the young the son of Jesse a man after
[1:20:39] my own heart would shoutful fill all my
[1:20:42] will in other words he's going to do
[1:20:44] everything I tell him to do
[1:20:45] of this man's seed hath the Lord
[1:20:48] according to his promise raised unto
[1:20:50] Israel a savior Jesus now
[1:20:54] a man after God's Own Heart
[1:20:57] friends when God chooses a man
[1:20:59] and places that man he will not accept
[1:21:02] another
[1:21:03] there's there's no one that can take
[1:21:06] that man's place
[1:21:08] there is no one that can take your place
[1:21:13] we were born in thin and shaped in
[1:21:16] iniquity we may have committed all kinds
[1:21:19] of sin but but we were always children
[1:21:23] of God
[1:21:25] we just had to come to the realization
[1:21:28] that that's who we belong to
[1:21:31] we might have been born naturally in
[1:21:34] this life to some other seed to some
[1:21:36] other lineage but spiritually where of
[1:21:39] the lineage of Christ
[1:21:41] [Applause]
[1:21:48] admitting our sin and asking for
[1:21:50] forgiveness is only half the equation
[1:21:54] the other is to repent
[1:21:56] and there's and and there's two parts to
[1:21:59] that asking for forgiveness and then
[1:22:01] turning from your sin
[1:22:04] turns me to Psalms 51. I'd like to read
[1:22:08] this together
[1:22:12] this is David's repentance after Nathan
[1:22:15] the prophet it came to him after he had
[1:22:18] been with Bathsheba
[1:22:20] and he says this in Psalms 51 have mercy
[1:22:25] upon me o God according to thy loving
[1:22:27] kindness according to that multitude of
[1:22:29] thy Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:22:31] transgressions watch me thoroughly from
[1:22:34] my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[1:22:37] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[1:22:39] is ever before me going down to verse 7.
[1:22:41] Purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[1:22:45] clean wash me I shall be whiter than
[1:22:48] snow make me to hear the joy and
[1:22:50] gladness that the bones which thou Hast
[1:22:52] broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my
[1:22:56] sins and blot out all of my iniquities
[1:22:58] created me a clean heart o God and renew
[1:23:02] a right Spirit Within Me
[1:23:04] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:23:07] take not thine Holy Spirit from me
[1:23:09] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:23:12] and behold me with thy free spirit then
[1:23:16] will I teach transgressors thy ways and
[1:23:18] sinners shall be converted unto thee
[1:23:20] deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God
[1:23:24] thou God of my salvation and my tongue
[1:23:27] shall sing aloud thy righteousness O
[1:23:29] Lord open thou my lips and my mouth
[1:23:32] shall shoot forth thy praise for thou
[1:23:35] desirest not sacrifice else would I give
[1:23:38] it thou delightest snot and burn
[1:23:40] offerings the sacrifices of God are a
[1:23:43] broken Spirit a broken and contrite
[1:23:46] heart oh God thou will not despise
[1:23:50] now
[1:23:52] there are eight wives of David that are
[1:23:56] named in the Bible
[1:23:59] and uh I I won't go through all their
[1:24:02] names but you can find six of them in
[1:24:05] second Samuel chapter 3 and then of
[1:24:07] course there's the two Michelle who was
[1:24:10] his first the daughter of Saul and then
[1:24:13] there was Bathsheba now of eight wives
[1:24:17] why would God choose from this woman to
[1:24:22] be
[1:24:24] for carrying on the genealogy coming to
[1:24:28] Christ
[1:24:30] she was a gentile
[1:24:35] she obeyed the king
[1:24:39] and Friends evidently she repented as
[1:24:43] well
[1:24:50] the Bible names 19 sons of David
[1:24:54] there was two others that died in
[1:24:57] infancy that are not named but 19 of
[1:25:00] Sons of David are named
[1:25:04] why didn't God choose one of these
[1:25:05] others once
[1:25:10] but remember this child that was to be
[1:25:13] born from this act of adultery died
[1:25:17] and then the Bible says David went into
[1:25:19] Comfort Bathsheba and then she bore a
[1:25:24] son and he called his name Solomon
[1:25:28] and the Bible says and the Lord loved
[1:25:31] him
[1:25:34] why didn't he pick any of the other sons
[1:25:36] of David why did he have to pick this
[1:25:39] one
[1:25:40] only God knows
[1:25:43] why did God have to pick me
[1:25:45] why did God have to pick you because you
[1:25:48] belonged to him
[1:25:50] Hallelujah
[1:25:52] Hallelujah
[1:25:56] when Nathan the prophet came up to
[1:26:00] dedicate
[1:26:01] Solomon he called his name Jedediah
[1:26:05] which means beloved of Jehovah
[1:26:10] the ram says Sovereign Grace is from a
[1:26:13] sovereign one a Sovereign Grace from a
[1:26:15] sovereign One Sovereign
[1:26:17] what can it do Sovereign can do whatever
[1:26:20] it wants to
[1:26:22] Sovereign Grace can can only be given
[1:26:25] from the one that's Sovereign and God is
[1:26:27] sovereign
[1:26:28] so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore
[1:26:31] be in Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[1:26:33] anybody it does what it wants to isn't
[1:26:37] that wonderful it don't have it don't
[1:26:41] have to ask can I do this or shall I do
[1:26:44] this or can I must I will I it doesn't
[1:26:47] do it it does itself Grace is Sovereign
[1:26:50] therefore he can save the viles he can
[1:26:53] save the worst he can save the imperest
[1:26:56] he can save the immortalist
[1:27:00] he can heal the sickest
[1:27:02] Hallelujah he can save a Wretch like Me
[1:27:06] and he did what is it Grace
[1:27:10] William Branham a drunkard son that
[1:27:14] don't make any difference the grace of
[1:27:16] God save me you say me a woman's
[1:27:20] daughter that was no good that don't
[1:27:22] make no difference the grace of God
[1:27:24] saved you it's sovereign
[1:27:27] doesn't have to ask anybody nothing
[1:27:30] I'm so glad of that
[1:27:32] can take the violent Sinner and make him
[1:27:36] white as snow
[1:27:37] don't have to ask anybody about it it
[1:27:40] can do it because it's sovereign
[1:27:43] well I'm so glad that Grace didn't have
[1:27:45] to come down and ask somebody is it be
[1:27:48] okay if I saved Jerry Browning
[1:27:53] you know
[1:27:54] if it did there would have been some
[1:27:56] people no doubt they would have said no
[1:27:59] he ain't no good
[1:28:01] he ain't no count
[1:28:04] say well his daddy was a preacher it
[1:28:06] don't mean nothing he wasn't no good
[1:28:09] he was one that took advantage of people
[1:28:12] knowing his dad was a preacher he took
[1:28:14] advantage of it to gain people's trust
[1:28:18] and then did what he wanted to do that's
[1:28:20] the truth
[1:28:23] the grace saved me
[1:28:27] brother Branham said talking about these
[1:28:29] different ones he said no matter what
[1:28:31] they'd done it didn't matter they were
[1:28:35] predestinated
[1:28:43] now we come down
[1:28:45] to the last woman that's mentioned in
[1:28:47] the genealogy of Christ
[1:28:49] and seemingly you wonder then why if we
[1:28:52] mentioned four Gentiles that were vile
[1:28:54] people from cursed races and and so on
[1:28:57] why then would they mention this
[1:28:59] Israelite woman who seemed to be
[1:29:01] virtuous why would she then be mentioned
[1:29:04] other than the fact that she's mentioned
[1:29:06] as the mother of Jesus well there's more
[1:29:09] reason that she's mentioned to that
[1:29:12] it could have just said Joseph
[1:29:15] beget Jesus
[1:29:18] but friends
[1:29:20] Joseph didn't beget Jesus
[1:29:23] he was conceived of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:27] and God needed an incubator somewhere to
[1:29:31] bring this seed forth
[1:29:34] but not only that friends but Mary
[1:29:38] had a horrible reputation
[1:29:41] because she was pregnant about with
[1:29:45] child and had not been with her husband
[1:29:47] yet
[1:29:49] and so it sent out a rumor
[1:29:53] perhaps she had been with some Soldier
[1:29:56] perhaps she had been with someone before
[1:29:58] she came to Joseph or perhaps her and
[1:30:01] Joseph indeed had this son and had him
[1:30:04] out of wedlock
[1:30:08] only Joseph and Mary
[1:30:11] did the angel come to
[1:30:13] only Joseph and Mary had been pointed by
[1:30:17] the angel back to the scriptures that a
[1:30:19] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[1:30:22] child and his name shall be Emmanuel
[1:30:27] only Joseph and Mary knew this the
[1:30:29] people didn't know it
[1:30:31] and so Mary had to Bear a great reproach
[1:30:34] for Christ
[1:30:43] remember when Jesus was talking to to
[1:30:48] the to the priest he says he said they
[1:30:50] said we have Abraham as our Father and
[1:30:53] Jesus said if ye were Abraham's children
[1:30:54] you'd do the works of Abraham but now
[1:30:57] you seek to kill me a man that have told
[1:30:59] you the truth which I have heard of God
[1:31:01] this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of
[1:31:03] your father back then
[1:31:07] yeah Joseph fear not to take unto thee
[1:31:10] marry thy wife
[1:31:11] for that which he conceived in her is of
[1:31:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:20] we bear the reproach of Christ
[1:31:23] brother Branham said I'll gladly bear
[1:31:26] called a whole roller
[1:31:30] I'll gladly bear the reproach of being
[1:31:33] called crazy
[1:31:38] a fanatic
[1:31:42] I say I'll gladly bear the reproach
[1:31:45] of saying that I follow a man
[1:31:48] of saying that I'm in a cult
[1:31:55] scornful fingers were pointed at Mary
[1:31:58] same thing today
[1:32:00] scornful fingers are pointing at you
[1:32:06] scornful fingers were pointed at Jesus
[1:32:09] he was despised and rejected of men
[1:32:13] people hated him why because he did
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] people hate you
[1:32:19] because you do right
[1:32:21] people hate you because God blesses you
[1:32:28] remember Saul when God had rejected Saul
[1:32:32] and turned to David
[1:32:34] Saul was troubled by an evil spirit
[1:32:38] and Saul said they sent for a Minstrel
[1:32:41] to come and play for him that it would
[1:32:43] soothe him during these times and they
[1:32:45] brought up David who was skilled on the
[1:32:47] harp and David would play now looks
[1:32:50] friends Saul was actually angry at God
[1:32:53] because God had took the Kingdom from
[1:32:55] him right but he couldn't hurl a javelin
[1:32:59] at God so what does he do he finds
[1:33:01] somebody that God's blessing and hurls
[1:33:03] to Javelin at them
[1:33:07] David
[1:33:09] that's the same way those Spirits are
[1:33:11] today
[1:33:13] these evil spirits
[1:33:16] Jesus said blessed are they when which
[1:33:19] are persecuted for righteous and sake
[1:33:22] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:33:24] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:33:26] persecute you and shall see all manner
[1:33:28] of evil against you falsely for my sake
[1:33:30] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[1:33:33] great is your reward in heaven for so
[1:33:36] persecuted they the prophets were which
[1:33:38] were before you
[1:33:40] the reproach you bear for Christ just
[1:33:43] proves who you are amen
[1:33:47] amen that's what Jesus is saying he said
[1:33:49] because so persecuted they the prophets
[1:33:53] Jesus says in another place he says
[1:33:56] rejoicing that day leap for joy
[1:34:01] what have a Hallelujah breakdown
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:07] start shouting when you're persecuted it
[1:34:11] shows Who You Are gladly bear his
[1:34:14] reproach gladly be made fun of gladly be
[1:34:18] laughed at they ridiculed Jesus they
[1:34:21] laughed at him they did it publicly they
[1:34:25] beat him they spit on him
[1:34:31] uh gladly
[1:34:33] bear my cross
[1:34:35] Hallelujah y'all gladly take up my cry
[1:34:38] my cross and bear it
[1:34:41] Hallelujah
[1:34:44] Paul says
[1:34:47] for therefore we both labor and suffer
[1:34:49] reproach because we trust in the Living
[1:34:51] God who is the savior of all men
[1:34:54] especially those that believe
[1:34:58] in Hebrews it says by faith Moses when
[1:35:01] he had come to years refused to be
[1:35:03] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:35:05] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:35:07] with the people of God than to Rejoice
[1:35:10] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[1:35:13] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:35:16] riches than the treasures of Egypt for
[1:35:19] he had respect unto the recompense of
[1:35:22] the reward
[1:35:25] Jesus the Bible says suffered without
[1:35:28] the gate
[1:35:32] they took him without the Gate of the
[1:35:34] city
[1:35:35] and he suffered
[1:35:37] and he bore his cross
[1:35:40] up Calvary up the hill of Golgotha
[1:35:46] Hallelujah
[1:35:48] he went beyond the camp
[1:35:50] brother Brown said
[1:35:52] raise your hands and say I want to go
[1:35:55] without the camp no matter what it cost
[1:35:57] me I'll take my cross and bear it I'll
[1:36:00] go beyond the camp no matter what people
[1:36:02] says about me I want to follow him
[1:36:03] outside the camp I'm ready to go
[1:36:10] in Access Jesus says
[1:36:13] it says after this the Holy Ghost has
[1:36:16] come upon you then ye shall be Witnesses
[1:36:19] of me in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and
[1:36:22] to the uttermost parts of the Earth
[1:36:25] a holy ghost baptism was the last until
[1:36:28] Jesus returns again
[1:36:30] a little while in the world sees me no
[1:36:32] more but ye shall see me for I'll be
[1:36:34] with you even in you into the end of the
[1:36:35] world doing the things that I do you do
[1:36:39] also
[1:36:40] through his Spirit working through the
[1:36:42] church he said you'll be made fun of
[1:36:45] they called me the Master of the House
[1:36:47] Bells above the chief of fortune tellers
[1:36:49] how much more will they call them of his
[1:36:52] household now blessed are ye when men
[1:36:54] shall say all manner of things about you
[1:36:56] rejoice amuse seed and glad because
[1:36:58] great is your reward in heaven for so
[1:37:00] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:37:02] before you that scripture see there it
[1:37:04] is so you see you just got to have it
[1:37:06] friend
[1:37:07] now you've got to make your choice
[1:37:14] so Mary
[1:37:15] it's mentioned because of the great
[1:37:17] reproach that she bore
[1:37:20] which is again so fitting of the Gentile
[1:37:23] Church
