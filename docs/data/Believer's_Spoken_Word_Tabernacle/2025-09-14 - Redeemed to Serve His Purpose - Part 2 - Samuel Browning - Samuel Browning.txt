Let's all stand this morning. Amen. For I could search for all eternity, Lord, and I find there is none like you. Oh, there's none like my Lord. Let's sing it once again.

I search for all eternity Lord and find there is none like you. [Music] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the truth, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's nobody like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody like the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That scripture I just um keeps resonating in my heart for some time is where it speaks of the chief cornerstone and um says he is precious. We read it in our text last week, but it's just a lot of things just meditating. And you know, when you you see what God has done for you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what he's done in your life truly, that's where you could say he's precious. &gt;&gt; He's precious. Where where he brought me from, where he what what he what he did in my life. He's precious. &gt;&gt; He is precious. He is &gt;&gt; so precious. So wonderful. Amen. Don't you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So good to be gathered together. Um I'm just going to uh ask you if you would like to just have your seats just for a few moments. I want to we didn't get to actually do it at a time that we normally would uh and that was actually to have prayer with those of the the students and kids and different ones that are going back to school, college and so forth. And so we would certainly like to to do that and we certainly know that um even in the time and the day and age that we live in um it's always been where we trusted the Lord and each time when they uh walk out of our our homes and it's not just for um the the craziness of the world that we see and it's when you see all of that you see things just things that's taken place this week and you know you you see situations and you realize that it's spirits. &gt;&gt; It's not people, it's spirits. &gt;&gt; And that's the things that within this within this this time that we are living in, it's a a time where the lid has been taken off of hell. And remember we sometimes when we step back from this this is also in the midst of the glorious revelation that is to catch our hearts away change our lives yet at the same times it brings um clarity to where we're standing like in Psalms 27 where David David speaks in the midst of that time that everything is all around him to try to consume him. See, these are things, events and things happen that would like to even to swallow us up and things that take place, things that would like to get in your mind and where fear could set in and nervousness and everything else. And you know, and I think this is where we just have to just continue within this time to know this. God has placed us here in this hour and his word is more than enough. It's sufficient to see us through. That doesn't mean that we don't, you know, use wisdom within things. But I know that I know this one thing for sure that God has not left us here helpless. And to put also in the in the perspective, the prophet would tell us and he would take us in scripture to show us and we we see this more and more and more. The prophet saw it in seed form. He saw these things in seed form that you and I are seeing in harvest time. And where he could say just as it was in the days of Noah that the people had to get in the spirit of destruction in order for destruction to come. Likewise must the people of God get in the spirit of God for rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a there's there's there's two forces. There's two powers as the prophet brought it, you know, at work. And so within all of this, even as we are children, they go to school. And I'm not just talking about with evil and things like that of violence. I'm going to tell you some of the greatest evil is some of the uh seeds that are sown &gt;&gt; um within, if I can say it this way, these petri dishes called colleges. There's so much things that are and so and I say that because you you know I I I have a license to say that I I went clear to have a masters and there's a lot of things that it just had to throw out the window. There was a lot of things there was things that I looked at and I felt at the time I thought if I made statements like you're making here I don't know if I'd be allowed to walk the streets but you just so you you you see certain things that are happening within this time and I'm not we have to go into those places you have to go in or in order to get your certificate but I always want to just say it to you like this that your certificate your degree the way that I always looked at it is that that was printed on there as far as from a knowledge, but when I looked at it, that was already in me. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Because whatever God has called you to do, it's already in you. &gt;&gt; That's how God spoke when he spoke concerning the tabernacle in the wilderness when God had Moses up there in that cloud. And he says, I filled Bezel with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and skill. So, I believe this. He's Jehovah Gyra. How many believe that? So God doesn't place us in this earth without the skills that he already placed within us &gt;&gt; that then is God just lead us into the right places that that that can I can start to realize what you have for me because really even what he has for you the career and all those things God will work through all of that but yet our main purpose is to serve God if we serve God as a as a builder we serve God as a nurse we serve what however we serve God but that's just part of the occupation that God gave us that we could be able to stand here and provide for ourselves and actually it's not us providing for ourselves it's Jehovah Gyra &gt;&gt; God placed those skills within us and then those things begin to be harvested and then we find because everything in our life I always told the boys I said you we are with our priorities and things a lot of times your school and your times get taken up right now writing papers and all of that but you got that kind of stamina right now when you get older, some of the things start slaying down. But just remember, everything you're doing is with the priority is that I want to be in the house of God. I want to be free. I want to serve God. And that's the whole thing within this life. We want to just keep this life so that this life is not it's always trying to encroach on us anyhow, right? The best that we can do. It's always wanting to encroach and get on our minds and get in our spirits and all those things. So, we always have to to to to push back on it where we say, "God, help me to at least be in the right place and the channel of what you've had have for me." And uh I believe that God's mindful of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you believe that? &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um uh please don't think that I'm throwing off on any universities or anything like that at all. I'm not at all. But I just simply say it. There was a when I was a young man and God had got a hold of my life and when I came home and I remember uh I was just watching a message and it was a VC it was on a VCR tape. Um, some of you have to know remember what that is, but uh, it was a message that Brother Biscll was preaching and the message title was taking the battle to the enemy's camp. And I never forget, I was sitting there in the living room and brother Biscll just stopped and he says, "You young people," he said, "let me admonish you, go in there, get what you need, leave the other stuff, and get out." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly how we feel. There's a lot of that. We we do what we need to do and get out. It's like when you go for training, right, on your job. You go for training on your job, you'll hear a lot of stuff. You hear a lot of different things. Say, "Lord, help me to get what I need and leave the filler behind." Amen. And God is so mindful, Amen. for all of our needs. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in the house of the Lord. And it's so good to have uh Sister Joy Keith here with us, Sister Gloria's mom. And so we appreciate that. I want to say we so enjoyed that time together on uh Friday evening. And uh my it was a good time of good time of fellowship and uh the the finally the fire felt right. Amen. So um but we just thank the Lord for that and we'll try to plan one here for October as well. and um because I think there's some good snacks that we could eat in October. We're getting close to apple picking time. So, it's a it's a good time to excuse to have a an apple crisp, you know. Amen. I want to say it's good to have brother Roco back with us here. Amen. And uh Sister Suzanne, praise the Lord. Sister Suzanne Keenir, how God just moved down for her. Amen. And there and if I forgot somebody else, listen, it's not because you're not important. We've had so many things in and out, but I want to say uh it's so good to be together. And I see different faces, different ones back. I see Sister Ogre, Sister Brun, different ones. And it's so good to be back together. Amen. In the presence of the Lord. But if we could, let's just have uh if the young people would would come at this time, if parents, if you'd like to come as well. And um we just we want to have prayer with them in this time and just certainly ask for God's mercy and ask for God's guidance and his hand upon their lives. Amen. You know, I I look across them with the young people and things and you know, God had there was skilled men that was down in Babylon, young people. The Bible tells us in the opening chapter, many times we read about Daniel and with Daniel in the lion's den and Daniel under the leading of God interpreting, you know, the vision as God would give them. But some of the opening scripture says these young men were skilled &gt;&gt; in science. That's what it says. Math, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were skilled. So, I'm just going to say it like this. God God has all of that in his kingdom. And God entrusts you with what he's placed in your life. And everything you want to do is is Lord, with all of my life, I want to give you glory. I want to I want to bring glory to you, Lord. I want you to have your way in my life. Amen. Let's just let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, how we thank you, dear God, for these young people, Lord, as they are, Lord. real testaments and testimonies, Lord, of your grace, Lord, how that Lord, you're working in their lives. And Lord, no matter where they might be in their journey with you, but the desire is, Lord, that you would not only watch over them, give them wisdom, give them the grace that they need. Lord, I pray that you would just keep your hand upon them. I see as parents standing here Lord in for others Lord that they have on their heart Lord as teachers and other things oh God may you just watch over each one I pray Lord God let it be just a hedge of protection Lord and I'm asking God that Lord that you would give them favor Lord that Father as their lives even being a witness where they go because there's others out there Lord that are longing that are thirsting for life oh God, I pray that Lord, may you just, Lord, make yourself known through their lives, Lord. Lord, give them strength, Lord, and and just, Lord, the understanding that's needed as they go into a class. Give them favor with their professors, with their teachers, Lord, with their peers, oh God. I pray, Lord. And may you just, Lord, keep them, Lord, and in their minds, oh God. May the discernment of the Holy Spirit, Lord, just be there with them, Lord, to discern, Lord, that which is needed, that which to study and take notes on and prepare for a test, Lord. And that you know that will be, Lord, resources they'll draw from later in Lord, in their journey should you tar. We ask God for your protection, your hand of protection Lord upon their lives Lord God day in and day out Lord I pray God and upon these schools and these facilities Lord these places Lord where even they would go Lord we pray God for your mercy Lord. Oh God may their lives just be a real beacon of hope Lord I pray we love you and we thank you Father in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless each of you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's go ahead and stand. Amen. Want to I want to begin here um in Revelations chapter 1. just a um a real burden. I actually thought I was I was ready to go. And um then I got home on Friday evening and just some things I just couldn't uh just couldn't uh turn loose from. And so I began to write notes before I would go to bed and so I could get up and begin to bring a little bit of a different direction with it. And so let's read here and for in Revelations chapter 1 and verse one, the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne. In verse five, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Amen. God bless you. As you're being seated, would you um would you turn with me to second Corinthians? Just turn in your Bibles with me to second Corinthians. And in verse verse 14, Paul writes, "Be you not unequally yolked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteous with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord, or what agreement hath Christ with Belia? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? Verse 16. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. And I want to just draw just a little further here this morning from that thought of being redeemed to serve his purpose. And brother Brandham would would say it like this in regarding the scriptures we read in Revelations chapter 1. And he would take that that part from where that the declaration is is that he hath made us kings and priests unto God and in his father. And I want to just say this that that in everything that God um has done, God wants to make that such a reality by a revelation in our heart that just settles us and brings an authority in our life that goes beyond all of our reasoning capacity, all of our imagination, everything to where that should anything we become troubled in our spirit, there is an author authority on the inside that we are living by an anchor that holds within the veil wherein that we are not able to be moved away but rather we have the strength to pull all of those other areas into subjection to what God has declared and said in our lives. And so when we look at this to be of a king and notice how that in both of these places it would say uh in this place that he hath made us kings and priests and to see that how that with a king itself a king is one who is a ruler and the prophet would bring that out very clearly to us of what that would speak to us that we have been placed into a position of authority over sin. over the world, over the devil, and over the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not a trotten down something. And and this is where we have to now we rely on the revelation from God that actually holds the real identity of who we always were. &gt;&gt; The darkness that was over our life, the how things were described, that's not who we were. But where we were was that seed, that son of God, son or daughter of God that was hidden beneath that darkness. All it took is for the grace of God to come along our pathway and for God to lead us into that place to where through his blood, there is a sanctifying, a cleansing, and then God moves in to raise up that part of himself as a son and daughter of God. And then that son and daughter of God begins to reflect that revelation that God has placed in their hearts. And then that's where that through our lives there's a pressing through uh beyond sin, beyond the world, all of the pressures of beyond that of the flesh. I mean, you're sitting here this morning. No doubt. Maybe some of you are, some of you are not, but some perhaps you had to actually put yourself in a place and say, "I'm going this morning." Amen. &gt;&gt; You had You're sat here and you've had to say, "You know what? Uh, these hands don't belong to you, but these hands are mine." &gt;&gt; So, I I need I need I need to borrow. I need to use these hands to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. God looks on our heart, but you know, it's just like this. How can you know when you when you see within our heart, how much greater it is when God can see what is in your heart being actually expressed out through the members of our body. What a what a glory. You talking about a victory and how he just he stands back and he looks at that and says, "I know what they're going through. I know what they're dealing with. I know what opposition. I know what they face. And I'm seeing the sacrifice." And God's just taking in that sacrifice that's being presented through our lives. Why? Not because we feel like it, but because he's worthy. &gt;&gt; Every moment. He is worthy. Yes. &gt;&gt; And with that, here you are as a king, as a ruler, putting your flesh in subjection. When thoughts come in your mind with situations, as a king, putting your your mind in subjection, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, you are a you are a you are a king, a ruler. You're let me just say this to you. You're not a pusharound. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say it in this way. Even even as God when God would begin to deal with your life, it's not all of a sudden as though that you don't have any disc uh no I Lord I don't have any authority. But you do. When God begins to deal with your life, you've got an authority to make decisions and say I'm not going to stay here no longer. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stay here no longer. That that's the presence of God drawing that from our life. And so then this other aspect that I want to deal with in here this morning is that of a priest and how that within the priest the prophet said he has made us priest and priest unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings unto our God. No wonder the world does not appeal to us. We are a peculiar people. Uh maybe odd and strange acting to the world, but this word peculiar means we we uh we are under ownership. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seal of God has come upon our life. And you know what? I'm not a prisoner as far as oh, I'm in prison. No, I'm a prisoner of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is not I I'm free. You're free. You're free. You can do whatever you want. It's just the change of the desire on the inside has come upon your life. I don't want to do anything that's of the world or against the word. So it's you're not being held under a law. You're walking by grace. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; So we are peculiar people that's zealous unto good works. When God makes something known, when God reveals something, we want to move. We want to act upon it because our desire is we want to please him. We have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father. &gt;&gt; Recreated, &gt;&gt; not something made and made over. We've been re recreated. There's a new creation on the inside &gt;&gt; by God himself coming down and becoming one of us. &gt;&gt; The blood being shed and the life coming to our lives. And I want to just kind of just work with that here a little bit here this morning because you understand that everything that you face and you deal with in life, even when you come through oppositions, when you come through heartaches, when you come through situations, there is a ground that you must not leave. It's a ground you must bring every thought to. It's a ground you must bring every uh uh every situation and come back on. come back into those grounds. And the grounds I'm talking about is the sacred sands of God's grace. &gt;&gt; What God has done in your life, how he has revealed himself to you. Don't don't get trapped by trying to get out in your reasoning. Bring make sure the enemy, he's can't step foot on those sacred sands. Are you hearing me? He can't step foot there. But if you will bring every situation there, God is the one that will uncover and unfold, even the snares, even the traps, even everything that the enemy has sought. Every weapon that he has sought to try to use against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the presence of God, in the shikina light, it unravels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Untangles all those things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that comes where you're taking in prayer, &gt;&gt; waiting on God, not moving and acting hastily, &gt;&gt; not making rash judgments, not drawing conclusions without coming into his presence. &gt;&gt; Right? That's being a king and a priest and ruler within the temple. I'm not going to let anything reside in this temple &gt;&gt; that's unlike him. Now I want to come into this place here for what he's done for us because God would tell to would tell Israel in Deuteronomy to remember where God brought you from. &gt;&gt; It's it's very important you you never let me tell you friends you never get beyond that memory. You realize where God has brought you from. And it's not just where he took you out of the world and he filled you with the Holy Spirit, but even after he's filled you with the Holy Spirit, how he's brought you a mighty long way. &gt;&gt; Must never remember. And sometimes you you know you can look back and consider and say my where he's brought me from. And it's truly you are saying it's him that has brought me to where I'm at. He didn't pull me. He didn't push me. But his grace came and melted my will to surrender more to him. and it's him that's brought me here. And so when you're standing there, all the glory is going to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Now, God is a leader. &gt;&gt; God doesn't entrust things and just ask you and I to do something that he wouldn't do himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. God himself is the one when he uh makes requirements and in in his word. Remember when he God came, he took his own laws, his own word upon himself. God did that because he is the word. Every law that he gave, there was not one law escape but he himself, he came down. He is the lawgiver. Remember the spirit of God is the same. It's the same spirit of God that wrote with a finger the ten commandments and men man could not his nature was not aligned with what was wrote there. But God said I will make a new covenant. And that new covenant that God would make would come through and by the atonement. It would require the atonement. It would require an innocent one because you and I were standing guilty. We were helpless. There's no way that we can get to God. But God came down and became one of us. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said he is our peace. &gt;&gt; Peace, yes, is an attribute, but it's a real expression of who he is. That he has brought and ministered peace to you and I. He is one that claims peace over our life. that you don't have to war and struggle and fight and wrestle against sin. He is our peace. He's the satisfier of the need. He's the satisfier of that situation. He is our peace. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. When he comes to proclaim peace, it stirs up war. &gt;&gt; That's good. Because every time when the gospel trumpet sounds, every message that God ever dropped, every all the way through the ages, every one of those ages when a gospel trumpet sounded, it it it was noting war was on. And what was the war? The war was against the kingdom of Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand? It's God. You and I, even down through those ages, they didn't know where to turn to. But God knew who his children were in every age. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet could stand there in the message the rapture and say, "You hear these men making statements about the promise of the hour, the message of the hour." He said, "What that is is God has made a promise in his word concerning this day." And he goes on to say, "We wouldn't even know where to look if not for the Holy Spirit that has guided us to these principles." You see, it's the Holy Spirit that has even guided you here this morning. It's the Holy Spirit. Listen, friends, you didn't come in contact with this message by chance. And it wasn't you coming in contact with the message. It was the message coming in contact with your life. And the message is not an idea. The message is the revealing of the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why that opening text, the revelation of Jesus Christ, it's not lost through those seven stars. But those seven stars are shining in the darkness of night. They have no light of their own, but they are in his right hand of authority and power. And it is God that is illuminating the pathway for you and I to come back into fellowship with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the seven stars never take away from his glory. But the true seven stars are there to reveal, reflect the light from the ho from the holiest of holies. Reflected onto the labor, a place where there's cleansing. Reflect it back to Calvary to show there is a way. And this is that way to get back into fellowship. It's a way that's calling us, get back under the blood. &gt;&gt; God would not ask you and I to do something the prophet says it over and over that he himself &gt;&gt; was unwilling to do. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that thought here this morning. It's key. God as he asked us and through Paul, Paul announcing this to the Corinthian church in that hour and to all believers down through time of calling them to the place that their their vessels, their lives are not to be given to to idolatry or or fellowship with darkness, but how God begins to deal with our lives and where you know there's sometimes listen friends where there's associations that need to be cut off. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something about the workplace. There was good people I worked with, but it got to a spot that I'll tell you right now. I stopped going in that break room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz I kept cuz I got tired of feeling dirty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because of the insinuations that would be made. &gt;&gt; All the cracks and that that's their normal language. I'm not I'm not I'm not downing them. That's their normal language. &gt;&gt; That's normal for them. Just like I'd put butter on my bread. But it's up to me that I can continue to go before God and say, "Lord, cleanse me, Lord. Oh, I just feel so terrible." Or as a son and daughter, begin to realize, "Wait a minute here. I can avoid that whole thing alto together." &gt;&gt; You say, "What is that?" That's being a king. &gt;&gt; It's being a king. &gt;&gt; So good. Because you know why? You you exert that as a king because you're a priest &gt;&gt; and you're meant to give spiritual sacrifice to God. And as a king, you are meant to hold it like Nehemiah that nothing encroaches upon worship for that is what you were created for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's there's a discernment. God, give me the discernment that I need &gt;&gt; in these times. Give me the discernment, Lord, that we need. So God speaking to them that you know that what what what agreement at the temple of God and he's calling them out come out be you separate from the unclean thing I will be your father uh you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty now God as I said he's a leader &gt;&gt; and let me just say this with redemption he showed it all the way down through the scriptures Right? &gt;&gt; He wanted to show that it was in bits and pieces all the way down. It was Christ all the way through. It was a scarlet cord all the way through. &gt;&gt; And so God himself, he comes down and becomes one of us. &gt;&gt; I want to just say, let me just read this this scripture here and trusting all this, it'll come together. I got a few more places that I want to read from here, but notice in in Titus 2 11, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly, righteously, godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God in our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself down for us. Now, I want you to notice this. When Paul's writing this, he's not putting them as though this is two separate people. These are two separate personalities. A great God and our savior Jesus Christ and is a conjunction. Jesus Christ, our savior, is the flesh is the embodiment of God becoming our savior, our redeemer. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the fall took place in Eden, he never sent another. &gt;&gt; He came himself. &gt;&gt; There were others who said, "I'll take the T." Nope. &gt;&gt; I've had an appointment with them evening after evening, and I'm going down. But father, &gt;&gt; there is a fall that has taken place, but they are still my children. No matter if they're in a fallen condition, I'm going down. &gt;&gt; Nothing could keep him back from his children. Why? Cuz his children are a part of him. &gt;&gt; Nothing could stop that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you as a parent, you ought to put that on your fifth ribbon and say, "I claim them right now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Wherever they're at, I claim them. &gt;&gt; I claim them, Lord." &gt;&gt; But, you don't know where they're at. They're not off limits for the presence of God. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us the angel of the Lord went to the pig pin and dealt with the heart of that prodal son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam, you're making some wine. No, I'm not making wide out claims. I'm claiming what belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm claiming each one. I'm claiming those that have bachelin. I'm claiming those. I'm holding on because why? God is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God never came down to run his children down. He came down to not only investigate. He wasn't snooping around. He came down &gt;&gt; because there was a need &gt;&gt; and that need demanded the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; in your life in my life. The need in our life demanded the need demanded the coming of the Lord in our life. &gt;&gt; We needed more than a church. &gt;&gt; We needed more than a knowledge. We needed more than good principles. We needed the coming of the Lord in our lives. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And God didn't short change it. He didn't send somebody else. &gt;&gt; He came himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He became one of us. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, let me just say it." What's very important because when you recognize that the Holy Ghost in your life in my life is nothing less than God himself moving into another form &gt;&gt; but the very life of the sacrifice now tabernacling and flowing and a creative work in our life to do the same works that Jesus did. What are those same works? A life that's lived by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; A life that is now come in contact with God &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God. And when God listen when you have come in contact with God, you now have become a candidate. &gt;&gt; These are the words of the prophet of association with an unseen realm in the supernatural. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, if there's people on earth, which they are, being motivated by the supernatural, and they're being drawn to give themselves to images, and this earth is being filled with violence through them, then God's got to have some people like Noah whose hearts are given to God, and God is projecting and revealing the right vision of his word. And that vision of his word is that he would be preeminent the first place the Lord in your life. And there is a vision you're walking by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not walking wondering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it is God revealing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's waiting on God, &gt;&gt; Lord, for the next step. While I'm in this step, Lord, let me let me if this is where I'm at right now, let let me let me let me draw from you everything and loosen myself from everything &gt;&gt; that's unlike you so that there more of God might come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this how God would make himself known to us in this time. This is why brother Brandham would take this of how God becoming one of us and his love that he's had for us and he says now I want you to think you are sons and daughters of God. This is out of the kinsman redeemer messages. You are sons and daughters of God. And he says regarding and he says who has received the Holy Ghost. He said, "Now, if you're an orpha bunch and you've turned away, but you know, if you've went on through to the Holy Spirit, you become sons and daughters of God." And he says, "Now, sons and daughters, who has the most power before God?" What is it? Is it an angel? An angel's a servant. They're his servants. What are you, his son and daughter? Who has the most power in heaven? A sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side. The sinner the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin cuz he's a son and a son has more authority than a servant of course. &gt;&gt; Amen. This next part, oh my. Oh, we forget what we are. We forget many times what made us what we are. After we become what we are, then we forgot how we got here. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I say God, send a fresh remembrance, Lord, &gt;&gt; over this congregation into every one of our hearts. Lord, you say, why? when we can remember that and just consider that it was the supernatural. It was God who came. It was God who moved across our life. And so now now look at your situations. Look at what you're asking God for. Look at your prayer request. And when you look at your prayer request, you'll not be looking at it through the eyes of your reasoning, through the eyes of imagination, through the eyes of conscience, but you're looking at it through the eyes of the supernatural God by a faith that looks to the unseen and close those things that are not as though they are. Now there was there was sacrifices that were made. God gave those sacrifices. In Hebrews chapter 10, it speaks of how the law having a good having a shadow of good things to come. not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there into perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered. In other words, if they met what was due, those sacrifices, well, that would have been perfect. But they weren't perfect. But you say, well, why did God give them? God gave them because of his desire to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And through those things, through every one of those examples of the bulock of the turtle duck, all of those, God made gave an example of his desire and his longing for fellowship. You know, God would even make it so clear. If you can't afford this, if you can't afford this, then this is what you can bring. You know why? Because God said, I'm not going to let anything of what you're able to provide stand between us and fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it had really had nothing to do with how much means we had. It's how willing we were to surrender what we did have. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "What is that?" That's God. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna get to that in a minute. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; It's God leading us out. It's God through through through through types and and shadows. It's God relaying. It's God saying to you and I that I love you. You're my son. You're my daughter. Don't let anything stand between us. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there's no reason for you to let anything stand between you and God. Well, I've failed and I've went astray. I failed God this many times. Don't let that stand there. Satan's trying to make that roadblock into a mountain. But I say, who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubabel, whose hands have laid the foundation? And welcome back the chief cornerstone. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? As sons and daughters of God that have a firm foundation, sealed with the spirit of God, you're standing as sons and daughters of God to speak to the opposition of darkness. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Not what. Not what. Not what. Who? &gt;&gt; Paul never said, "What shall say?" He said, "Who shall separate us?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spirits that want to get in there. It's a spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is where we come as kings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let me &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As kings, we've been seated. We're riding in authority. The Holy Spirit has lifted us. We're we're we're riding under the in the authority of the Holy Spirit. And yet, as a priest in our lives, we are walking, &gt;&gt; holy cha holy, holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Who did this? He did it. &gt;&gt; Let's remember how we got here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice with all this when God came down he he took the innocent one in Genesis he threw in the clothing the garments so they could come and stand in his presence. God would would make this known of the shedding of the blood of an innocent one all the way through the scriptures. Job Job offered up a burnt offering every morning he did this per adventure. My children they have gone astray. They have they have sinned. Maybe they're, you know, whatever I what's maybe something that's come in their life. But he offered up the burnt offering continually. You know why? He had confidence &gt;&gt; in God. God made a way that Job could approach him through. And Job could stand there on that burnt offering and know this is what God has revealed to me. And I'm standing here upon this burnt offering. Job was tied by revelation to God. [Applause] You think daily the enemy didn't try to pound to Job and say you're just going through the act. Job said it might feel like that, but there is an action of faith that's coming from my soul. &gt;&gt; And that king on the inside is said, I need to borrow the hands for the priest within me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I need to borrow your lips so I can tell him how much I love him. Excuse me. I need to borrow your feet so I can dance how I feel in my soul. &gt;&gt; Kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For them would they not have ceased to been offered but in those sacrifices because the worshipper would have remembrance conscience. The desire would still be there. He would go in and offer it up. But he left with the same desire. But he was able to have fellowship. He had made confession. He had laid his hands upon that sacrifice. Listen friends, you've got to fully become identified with the word. You've got to apply the blood. Listen, if you want the spirit to come, you must apply the blood. &gt;&gt; And when you apply the blood by faith, then the spirit will come to as a witness. The blood has been applied. You say, "What do you mean?" Take the word into your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's things you know that's not right. Ask God to cleanse you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, take that desire away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lay it down, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Samuel, I've laid it down a number of times, but lay it down. Quit taking it back up. and lay it down in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That personal revelation though, God gave him a revelation &gt;&gt; of this type. And listen, there was some who went through the motions. Yeah. Remember you you can read in in Isaiah. Isaiah said, "Your feast and your sacrifices have become a stink in my nostril." &gt;&gt; Right? Even Saul got caught up with, "We got to have a sacrifice. We got to have a sacrifice." Man, what? Where's Samuel at? Where's Samuel at? Oh, he's running so late. Where's he at? &gt;&gt; He was so focused &gt;&gt; on the sacrifice that he failed to see what was greater, obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is where that man got to. They begin to offer sacrifices without sincerity. That's why God just doesn't want our form. He doesn't want a ritual. Remember the Bible said in this day it would be forms of godliness but in the know then lacking the power, lacking the strength, lacking the Holy Ghost, lacking the seal, but have a form. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't want to be conformed. We don't want a form. We want the living reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want Christ. dwelling in our lives. &gt;&gt; And those it was revealed to when Abraham offered, when Job offered, when all of those elect down through the ages, you say elect. The prophet takes us to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; When Jesus rose, the Bible said, "And the graves were open and many." &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Notice, not all, many." Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was that elect that laid down there &gt;&gt; when they offered that lamb. Let me tell you something. They were looking for the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; because that revelation told them. That's why Job all the way through the book of Job. Job himself, you can't get him to relinguish &gt;&gt; the perfectness of his sacrifice and what the sacrifice has done for him. &gt;&gt; You You can't tell. You know what? You can't separate Job from his sacrifice. It'd be easier to stop the sun. &gt;&gt; That's the power of divine revelation. &gt;&gt; You have become a part by revelation. It's the spirit of God coming into your life and you become one. You become merged. It's united together. &gt;&gt; So what you're speaking is not something different than who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were looking for it by revelation. That's why when he went down to the lowest parts of hell with your sins and my sins, Ezekiel looking out the window said, "That's him. The wheel in the middle of the wheel." Abraham said, "Sarah, Sarah, I I I know. I know Abraham. I'm looking over your shoulder. That's the one that came to our 10 door." Yeah. Yeah. And not only did he come to our 10 door, remember I told you he met me on the plains after the battle was over. &gt;&gt; Daniel said, "Hey, hey, wait, wait." Yep. That's him. That's the one who came in the lion's den. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. &gt;&gt; You see, they were offering the lamb with an expectation. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, that's what revelation does to your life. It transforms you from dead carnal works. The blood of Jesus Christ has purchased, opened up for you and I a new living way into the holiest of holies to purge us &gt;&gt; from dead works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To a to a life to this there's an expectation. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him to come on this need that I'm praying about. I'm looking for him to come in our church. I'm looking for him to come in my home. I'm living for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm expecting God. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting him to fulfill his needs. I don't care what the devil wants to whisper in your mind and say, "Oh, you know that that's a little way out there and you've been praying about that a long time." It matters not how long you've been praying about it. &gt;&gt; Don't ever stop praying about your loved ones. &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that. &gt;&gt; You keep holding on. You keep calling out to God. &gt;&gt; Different ones that we see even right here maybe around the church or backslid don't keep don't stop from calling out. &gt;&gt; Be as a priest intercede for them. &gt;&gt; They might be under some of the greatest bitterness and the enemy may have tried to sour them and and tried to come against them. But I'll tell you what will defeat that is you entering in in prayer and your life, my life becoming more sweetened with the rose of Sharon, the dew of Herman, the lily of the valley, the shakina of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; brother Samuel. They just need a lecture. They don't need a lecture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to stop thinking in earthly terms. You'll only get earthly results. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Pray. Pray and pray and pray. When I don't see him here, keep praying. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this revelation he taketh away my my lord. My lord. Notice this. It said, "But in those sacrifices there's remembrance again made of sins every year. For it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he said, "A sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body &gt;&gt; hast thou prepared me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God prepared his own temple. &gt;&gt; His dwelling place, &gt;&gt; God, as the prophet could say, let me just read you a few statements. He says regarding the word becoming, he says the word was made human being became our kinsman. He became what I was so that I might through his grace become what he is. &gt;&gt; God became man. He became kin folks. And he couldn't be God and us sinners. So we were separated him, God, us sinners, creations of his creation, created beings of his creation because we couldn't be kin folks there. If God just remaining there within that form, God and here, you and I sinners, but somebody had to span the breach &gt;&gt; and you and I couldn't get here. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But God himself came down to where we were. &gt;&gt; He was made, the Bible said, in the likeness of sinful flesh. &gt;&gt; You want to know what God thinks about you? He was willing to come and be made like you &gt;&gt; and me. &gt;&gt; Want to know if he loves you? Well, I don't know if God loves you. God came all the way down and took on a body of humiliation. &gt;&gt; And he didn't stop there. He went to Calvary. And in the middle, in the midst of this time of spanning the breach, he manifested the victory through the temple that God had created. &gt;&gt; Stay with me now. &gt;&gt; He was manifesting the purpose that God intended for man to walk in. What had been examples and types and shadows now the antitype is standing &gt;&gt; here as Jesus could stand in the temple and say if you could know it when they were debating about oh you've healed one on the Sabbath day oh the gold on the altar all the and Jesus said you've got it all wrong &gt;&gt; you've got it all wrong what did he say what was it that was clouding their judgment &gt;&gt; they left out mercy Yes, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; How many know that as a Bible reader? Jesus pointed out, he said, &gt;&gt; "You've forsaken the most omitted in one place." He says, "The most important me matter me measures love and mercy, right? &gt;&gt; On which all the law and the prophets hang." Because listen, if everything that was wrote here, if there wasn't mercy and grace, which there was, God expressed his mercy to Israel down through the time and then when God came, he was full of mercy. This was God's expression of mercy. &gt;&gt; Are y'all right? We're just going to go ahead and preach. &gt;&gt; When Israel had failed and then and and the and and the golden calf and then there came a cleansing. Remember who's on the Lord's side? come stand by me. And there they came. Every one of them came over there and they stood by on the side of the of the word that was vindicated. God opened up the earth and he swallowed that of the earth. Now listen, he didn't swallow up every bit of Chorus household cuz there were still some of his boys left over in the book of Psalms. And let me tell let me just preach a little bit on that and then I'll get back over here. When you look at that, when it said how that these boys would write some songs, let me tell you something. And when you read that song that says it's the from the sons of Kora, I want to tell you that those young men, they had to battle through every accusation where the devil would say, "You're just like your daddy. You're just like this." But they themselves had a revelation that pierced beyond their family genealogy. Let me tell you what it was. It was God who laid hold on their life. All they could say is what God said. And it brought out a new song. &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy. &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy. I'm not the son of Kora. I'm not the son of this. I'm a son of God. Lord, &gt;&gt; there was a song sealed in their lives [Music] &gt;&gt; that no matter of muck and gum and everything else through the family tree could silence that voice &gt;&gt; that was meant to be sounded through their lives &gt;&gt; as a testimony. No matter what your background is, God is greater than your background. &gt;&gt; Cuz your background, your real background goes farther than your background. &gt;&gt; Chew on that one. We'll talk later. It go I'm talking it goes back before time. I'm talking back in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's where you and I came from. &gt;&gt; And so in order to redeem you and I, God himself stepped from glory and became one of us. &gt;&gt; That's why when God made made himself known to Abraham, consider this. Then here was Melzdc, king &gt;&gt; of Salem and priest of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he who was king and priest would become one of us &gt;&gt; to release and make us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; That's why the really with that of Melzdc is not so much a priesthood, a new order, yet it is a priesthood, but it's actually life, eternal life. We have been brought into the person of eternal life by one spirit. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; We are baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; We have been brought in here. He sought you and I out. &gt;&gt; We didn't know our names was in the ledger. &gt;&gt; We didn't know our names was in this. &gt;&gt; We didn't even know even when it came to message of the hour. We didn't even know that. We didn't even know about that. You might have sat here for years message of the hour. maybe repeated it and God finally he breaks the seals off of your life cuz he's already broken the seals off the book and he takes the seals off of your life. How does he do that? By anointing your eyes with the eyes of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to look beyond yourself, &gt;&gt; beyond what you see in the mirror every morning and to look with eyes of faith. I believe what God said. The Bible said, "Let the redeemed of the Lord say so." &gt;&gt; They that he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy. &gt;&gt; I am his son. &gt;&gt; I am his daughter. &gt;&gt; He has redeemed me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has brought me back to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when the Holy Spirit through the word of the hour begins to lay claim on your on your life, you can never be satisfied until it's a full surrender and God has filled you fully. You know why? That's God's desire. That's redemption claims. If there's something that belongs to you, you're you're willing to fight for it. You'll stand right there and God himself is standing faithfully right there and saying, "You're mine. &gt;&gt; You might have gone away, but he says you're mine. You get back in the presence of this light and the light said this is home. This is where you belong. I am that I am. You belong to me. &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; Let's give him a praise offering. You're worthy, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shake somebody's hand beside you and say, "I am redeemed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed, buddy. I'm redeemed. I'm redeemed. Y'all come over here. I'm not coming down there. I'm redeemed. I'm redeemed. [Applause] Now &gt;&gt; here stands the mighty God veiled in a temple of humiliation &gt;&gt; where Greeks would say we want to see Jesus. Philillip knew where to take him. They got there and all they saw was a human temple. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; All they saw was the veil that &gt;&gt; had a Kentucky vernacular. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; Well, no. I'm not making him Jesus. Don't you dare think that. What I'm trying to tell you is is that's the glory of the redemption through the blood. That God was able to so procure or to bring to himself a people that he could reflect himself through &gt;&gt; unhindered. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the revealing of the son of man &gt;&gt; through a son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has always chose to hide it be behind badger skins. &gt;&gt; But but not while they were alive. You know, you you can't have a live badger and God step behind there. &gt;&gt; But God knows how &gt;&gt; to bring death to that badger nature &gt;&gt; that's ruling over one of his children. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? The word is a discerner. &gt;&gt; The word separates you from you. It separates that badger nature from a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And that's why that badger nature wants to run, wants to pull away, but that son of God begins to get a little warm underneath the presence of the Lord. And and then in the rain, hold on a minute. We ain't going nowhere here. And that badger, oh my, he's he's getting nervous. He's get he's getting nervous. Why? The light is exposing him. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He's getting nervous. I got to get out of here. I got to He's trying to move away, trying to put thoughts through your mind and trying to get you. But notice as a son of God just standing right there in the presence of the sen. Oh, it's just something about it. As he begins to warm in that presence, what's happening? There is an authority that is rising in that sun that will lead him to a place of full surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, here was the Lord Jesus. I could have read this to you, but you you've read in your Bible. Here stands the Lord of glory in a temple of humiliation. He is declaring the purpose. He's restoring that of what he meant man to be, &gt;&gt; a dwelling place, God's place of rest, God's place of habitation. And so here he lays aside his splendor. He comes down and he becomes one of us. Sure, he goes through all of the pressures. Tempted like we like we're tempted. Pressures why? That he might understand us. &gt;&gt; So he's gone through all of that. As he stands there in the temple, the Bible says he came into the temple in John 2. It also speaks of it in Mark. Speaks of it in Matthew. And he came into the temple, the earthly temple that was there that had been patterned all the way back from heaven to Moses there. Solomon now here with Herod's temple all of this the pattern it had been in heavenly pattern but it had got away from the heavenly purpose. They were going through the sacrifices going through the motions. But when Jesus came, the Bible says when he came there in John chapter 2, let me just I want to refer to this here so I don't miss a word in there. In John chapter 2, when he reads this, he comes into the temple. You're like me. I'm always running my mind. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. John chapter 2. Yeah. Yeah. Here. Verse 13. And the Jews Passover was at hand. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen, sheep, and doves and chargers of money. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money, and overthrew the tables. And he said unto them that sold doves, take these things hence, and make not my father's house and house of merchandise. And his disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." Jesus and the Jews answered him and said, "What what sign showest thou, seeing that thou doest these things?" Jesus answered and said, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up." And you know, they they didn't understand that. But I I want to I want to draw your attention to this because when you consider all of the doves, all of the animals that were there, it was made possible by the priests permitting in the court of the Gentiles them to come and to sell these sacrifices. so man could take his money and go purchase a sacrifice. And the reasoning was Jehovah requires blood. &gt;&gt; He wants worship. And in order for us to worship, there's got to be blood. There's got to be a sacrifice. So the priests were providing that opportunity that way for the people. Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Now, just stay with me here. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the message paradox, I just want you to listen to this. He said they had some, you know, Jehovah, Jehovah requires a lamb for your sins, and now you didn't have to raise lambs. They had sellers go up there in the courts, make little cages, put lambs in there that you could take your income that you've made and made not of lambs, but you made something else to keep our economy going. So he says, "But God didn't want your money. He said a lamb and you went and bought a lamb." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He goes on in 64 when their eyes were open. He said, "See, they were marketing." You said they didn't have to raise lambs. The priests made a way that they could clear their soul according to the word of God. And they built little cages out there in the courts. Now, I want to say this. These priests could argue and say, "What are you doing? You are robbing these people from worship. &gt;&gt; You've loosened all these sacrifices. We know for sure you're a false prophet because Jehovah required these sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Looks like controversy. &gt;&gt; Looks like confusion. &gt;&gt; But little did they know here was the Lord of glory &gt;&gt; standing &gt;&gt; in this human temple. absolutely &gt;&gt; restoring &gt;&gt; and was to reclaim not just the purpose of that temple &gt;&gt; but through that would show how he would reclaim every one of his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. God himself. Religion. Religion is not a convenience &gt;&gt; where there's no sacrifice required, no no labor, no toiling of their own, but simply purchasing a lamb. Meaning had been lost. But God's desire for man to have fellowship was through the shedding of the blood by revelation. Like God entrusted your possession. In other words, remember Blind Barnameus? When Blind Barnameus was going to offer that lamb and the priest said, "Not that lamb. &gt;&gt; We've got a substitute for you." He said, "I never promised God a substitute. &gt;&gt; I promise God this lamb." &gt;&gt; You know what that was in in in Barnameus's heart? That wasn't just a story. That was an expression of God's heart. &gt;&gt; God didn't send a substitute. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't send somebody else to take your place. &gt;&gt; God himself came down and took our place. &gt;&gt; He came among religion. He came among the denominations. He came among the churches. He found substitutes. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you're good enough, if you can do good enough, if you can say say enough rosaries or whatever they're called or Hail Marys or or whatever they're novenas, whatever they are they're called. If you can do this, you're going to put your name on a book. You're not saved by putting your name under a book. &gt;&gt; You're not saved by an association with a group of people. There's only one place of safety and that is under the blood. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why denominations judgments on them cuz they've rejected the blood. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" Look at the lives that are projected out of there. &gt;&gt; It's not the life of the word. &gt;&gt; I'm not Listen, there's good people in there. They've been led astray. I'm not speaking against the people. I'm talking about the system. &gt;&gt; It's a walled up system. &gt;&gt; And here God steps down. even in the end time. And what he finds, what did he find in some of our lives? Rituals &gt;&gt; tied by religions, becoming ceremonious on Easter, becoming religious on Christmas. Where did he find in our lives? I trust he still doesn't find us just living out ceremonial lives &gt;&gt; just to just, oh, it's Sunday again. No, every day should be a Sunday. &gt;&gt; But it's not an SU day. It's an S day. &gt;&gt; And what do you mean by that, brother Samuel? I mean that the life there's a life that you live no matter whether you're inside of these four walls or not. It's not just that you're under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. You have the anointing of the Holy Spirit in your life that is anointing that word in your life to live out Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He found in the temple. He found them. You don't have to raise a lamb. Just buy one. &gt;&gt; You You don't have to. There's There's one for you to buy. But God never came or sent a substitute. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God came himself. &gt;&gt; He's a leader. Remember what I said in the beginning? He's a leader. &gt;&gt; He never asked you to do something that he has not willing to do himself. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; He did not send second best. He did not send something else. &gt;&gt; He didn't even take of what was already here. &gt;&gt; The search was made and no man was found worthy. &gt;&gt; He didn't take of what was here because all of that blood was polluted. Every man stood in need of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You and I stood in need of redemption. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy man as the Holy Ghost in the man. Right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So notice within this contaminated they made that they made the tradition the commandments of God tradition. &gt;&gt; It was like when you can read this when you get home in 2 Samuel chapter 24 and verse 18. Don't worry I'm coming down but don't don't close me out yet. This is this is important. &gt;&gt; Remember God's a leader. That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; You can read this when you get home in 2 Samuel chapter 24 and verse 18-2. The ark was down in the house of Aroni. Orana of Onan I believe it was. And there's a plague that's come upon the land of Israel. And David is moved to offer a sacrifice. And he's to go to by the threshing floor of this man. &gt;&gt; And he comes into that threshing floor. Listen to me. I want you just follow this here just a moment. The man shows up and says, "Take it, my king. &gt;&gt; Take all of these take all of these offerings &gt;&gt; and stay the plague." David said, "Nay, &gt;&gt; I will not offer unto my God &gt;&gt; that which cost me nothing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, to be a worshipper, there's a cost. &gt;&gt; To come back into fellowship with God, there's a cost. &gt;&gt; And that cost was made by God himself coming down and paying the price so that you and I, you and I, you and I might pay the price. by surrendering our own lives. &gt;&gt; This is why Jesus before he ever went to his cross said, "If any man will take up his cross and come after me and follow me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If he wants to hang on to his life, he'll lose it. &gt;&gt; But if he's willing to lose it, surrender it, then he shall have life." &gt;&gt; See the here it is. It's it's presented the the the here with with with where it was at the threshing floor of Arana, the Jebusite. offered him and David said, "No, I'm going to buy it of you." &gt;&gt; This was this was an example. What we just read in John chapter 2, what we're reading here is an example of what God has done for you and I. &gt;&gt; God doesn't do anything that he had asked us to do something that he hasn't already done and made a way you and I couldn't even die to ourselves. We could not be born again until the blood was shed and the Holy Spirit has come back. There was no way made into the Holiest of Holies. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get back in fellowship with God. I'm not talking about religion. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a relationship. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; You said, "I'll buy this threshing floor." &gt;&gt; Well, here you can take the offerings. No, I'll buy the offerings. &gt;&gt; And God made purchase. God laid down his own life. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He thought more of you, &gt;&gt; your fellowship. Let me tell you his last request in John 17, the last request that he made of the father, grant that where I am, &gt;&gt; they may be also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was that? That was the heart's cry of the father all along. I want them to be where I am. &gt;&gt; Do you understand where he is? He wants you to be under the blood. He wants you to be in fellowship. He wants to so change your life and be in fellowship and communion with you. He wants to deliver you from the bondage of religion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To where that you're a living expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherefore come out from among them. Separate. &gt;&gt; Separate. that the prophet said he's calling Abraham's seed to separate from seed, taste, feel, smell, hear, separate from reasoning, conscience, imagination, affections. Come out Abraham and live with me. &gt;&gt; That's what God did. &gt;&gt; See the way that God is required. He didn't want just any lamb. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He don't want any other sacrifice. Well, Lord, I've done this. I Lord, you don't know what I do for my community. That's wonderful. I'm not making light of that. But you don't merit your way into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know what I've done for this one? You know what I've done? All those things are wonderful. That's wonderful. But what does that have to do with salvation? &gt;&gt; If that's what was required, if that's what was required, then surely God would never had to become one of us. &gt;&gt; Calvary then would have been, what was Calvary? Just a show? Was Calvary just something that we sing a few songs about, something that we get emotional about? Or did Calvary have a meaning? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, church? &gt;&gt; Is the grace of God just something that we're enamored with and and we've been painted a picture as though that oh, the grace of God, it allows me to get by with my sin. That's not the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's a wrong picture. What the grace of God comes to do is give you and I what we did not deserve. &gt;&gt; We didn't have what was necessary to make the sacrifice. But God himself came down and became the sacrifice that you and I might willingly offer &gt;&gt; our lives &gt;&gt; to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our all &gt;&gt; the way we talk, the way we act, the way we dress. I'm not just talking about something out here, but I'm talking about what's in here comes out through here. &gt;&gt; You can't you that that's called confusion. If you say you're something here and something else is out here, that's called uncertainty. That's called confusion. That's called Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because there's two there's there's two different voices. &gt;&gt; But that voice has got to be clear. And the voice of the blood is a clear voice. When the voice of the blood has struck your soul, it cries out, "Redeemed." And through your life, it is declared, "You are redeemed. You are a Christian. You are a believer. You're a son of God." And the seal of the living God upon your life. A seal like a notary seal on a document. You can fill it on the front and on the back. In the coming and the going, you are a son of God, &gt;&gt; a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember, he didn't ask you to do something he has not done himself. He the son of man whom the father has sealed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Gave his stamp of approval, his vindication. This is my &gt;&gt; son. &gt;&gt; Hear you him. &gt;&gt; Just say it in this way. God himself restored that. It's got to be the lamb of your life. &gt;&gt; You're all that you're willing to lay down. Lord, I do this and do. Remember, God told Saul, &gt;&gt; obedience is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Listen, friend, I'm just going to tell you, I don't want to stand there on that day and I don't want to trust in my works. &gt;&gt; You understand what you trust in your works? You got a lamb that you're offering instead of taking the lamb. Right. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said there will be books open. If you miss the rapture, books are open at the white throne judgment with no blood present. &gt;&gt; And judgment is based on what you have done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What you have heard? &gt;&gt; How have you how have you how have you responded? Because listen, do you realize when when when when for a person to stand there on that day, it's already they've already had a grueling reality of missing the rapture and missing it all the way through. &gt;&gt; But then to stand there again in that time, I want you to I want you to understand this here, friends, that if you even if you I wouldn't want to stand there on my works. &gt;&gt; Your works will never merit it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, I I I I've had this felt this anointing that'll never merit it. It's got to come all the way down to the soul to where you accept God's provided way. &gt;&gt; You accept it. Don't Don't try to wrestle whether you're worthy. I'll just go ahead and tell you, you're not worthy. Neither am I worthy. You couldn't be worthy enough. You can't make yourself worthy enough. God's not asking you to make yourself worthy. He's asking you, will you accept my provided way? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And not another lamb, not a different lamb. This is the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's why this revealing of this message is not a revealing of another lamb. It's not another Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's the revealing of the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God who hath already taken away the sin of the world. It's the lamb of God being revealed. His life being revealed and tabernacled inside of a group of people. his victory pulsating through their lives. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Remember, God didn't require you to do something &gt;&gt; that he's not willing to do &gt;&gt; and has done himself. &gt;&gt; He didn't send the substitute. &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't want you to give him a substitute. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'll give you my strength. Samson gave him his strength. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll give you my mind. That's wonderful. But God wants more than your mind. &gt;&gt; He paid the price of redemption for your soul. &gt;&gt; Because if God carries long enough, this body will corrupt and go by the way of the grave. And that human spirit will break up. And the soul, which is what's been the real value the whole time, &gt;&gt; that's good. That is what's going to matter. &gt;&gt; Coming to that of the rapture. What is the rapture? The rapture is the harvesting of the treasure that's within the earth. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God already knows. Just like a person said, "Oh, I know there's oil here. I know there's gold here." What do they do? They mark out that whole place, don't they? They know there's oil here. Oh, there's precious ore. There's precious mine. God knows in his word there's precious gold. There's a people that's to come out under my name's sake. There's to be a people without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. And what has God? God has already marked the boundaries of his word through predestination. And no wonder, like David, you can say, "The lines have fallen concerning me in pleasant places." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I find myself within this gold mine of God's word, of revealed word. What's he going to do? He's going to harvest &gt;&gt; harvest &gt;&gt; his seed &gt;&gt; back home. Yes. &gt;&gt; A people that where were the purpose has been restored back in their lives. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. God entrusted you and I with this message to even be able to see this this deep call to him. Let me just drop this when I say this right here. I I want to encourage you. If you're not listening to the message, &gt;&gt; you need to get into it. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Oh, I listen to a lot of singing. Singing is wonderful. But get into the message. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. Let me let me tell you the power of this message. If you get into this message and say, "God, make yourself known to me. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know what I have need of." And he does. And he has just what we need, the bread and wine. That's right. &gt;&gt; I said he has just what we need, the bread and wine. &gt;&gt; You just you to give yourself to him. Oh, brother Sam, I don't understand everything. Just turn away that scarecrow of the enemy &gt;&gt; because it's not about your natural mind. &gt;&gt; But it's get yourself get into this message. Listen, friends, that's what we're ministering. We're preaching when we're talking about the message. We're talking about the revealed scripture of the hour. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. God's here to lead you instead of going around the same mountain over and over and over and over and over. Get into the message. &gt;&gt; Open it up on your phone. &gt;&gt; If you want to know, brother Samuel, what are some messages? Text me. &gt;&gt; Text somebody else. Text some of these others who came in years and years ahead of me. Text text different ones. You don't even have to just text me. But here's what I'm going to tell you. Just put it on. &gt;&gt; And you put it on, you start listening to it. You watch. It's not the voice of a Kuckian that's changing your life. It'll drive away that gloom, that darkness, that confusion. You know why? Because it is the light of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a voice. Though you might hear a Kentucky vernacular, but that voice that you're hearing is the thoughts of God. The Bible says in in the book of Revelations, "Come out from among her, my people." &gt;&gt; Right? And be not partaker. Brother Brandham said that voice as it sounded in heaven, he said what it was is the messenger on earth that was proclaiming that same message was so inclined with heaven that it was echoing back through heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I can't wait to get to heaven. Heaven has come down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, sure. I'm expecting to go to heaven, but heaven has come down. Heavenly places are right here among us this morning. &gt;&gt; If all of hell has been emptied out, &gt;&gt; then all of heaven has come down. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Because now there's a battle that's raging. &gt;&gt; Forces of darkness &gt;&gt; against that of light. the pressures you feel, &gt;&gt; the battles you go through, things that would like to silence that voice in your life, tests, trials. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you something. That voice inside of your life is a voice that's been sealed there. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; and God himself has anointed and released you like he did Isaiah. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; You've come into the temple of God. And in God's presence, you begin to see your weakness. You begin to see &gt;&gt; your need. &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Brandham says in that message, he said, "Will you take a journey with me to the temple this morning?" He said, "I'm not talking about over to Jerusalem. I'm talking about your heart." &gt;&gt; Go to that place. And then you say, "Whoa, Lord, woe is me. I'm a man of unclean lips." And God knows how to take care of that. &gt;&gt; He sends a He send what does he do? He didn't He didn't He didn't chastise Isaiah. He went and got what the need called for. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, your situation in your life is an opportunity for God to make his glory known. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I got this habit. But that don't look at that habit any longer as though that this is, oh, this is what I've carried all this time. This is what I have. But now, go ahead and start confessing it. This is an opportunity for the glory of God to come down in my life. &gt;&gt; It's an opportunity. Somebody else might have dealt with this, might have dealt with this way, but God, I'm going to be your witness as an overcomer that the grace of God is greater than this habit. It's greater than this besetting sin. It's greater than this weight. He's inspiring you. He's not leading you out on some goose chase. &gt;&gt; Come on. And he's not leading you out into the wilderness to a big bowl of Kool-Aid. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't a cult. &gt;&gt; This is the gathering of eagles. &gt;&gt; We've been gathered to the fresh carcass of the word. It's this word that's changing us. And all we see is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's him that's changing our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll be your witness. &gt;&gt; I'll submit that. Whatever that is in my I'll submit it to you, Lord. You're greater than this. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and say it as a son and daughter of God. You're greater than this situation in my life. &gt;&gt; You're greater than this need. And I'm going to go ahead and say I'm free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel say I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free because he has said I am free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't mind over matter. It's saying what the word is saying. &gt;&gt; I'm free. I'm a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I'm purchased. I'm bought with the blood of Jesus Christ. And I'm not going to give him a substitute. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The days of substitutes are over. &gt;&gt; I want to give him my all. &gt;&gt; I want to give him my all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gave his all &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; He gave his all for me. &gt;&gt; They offered him. They offered him. &gt;&gt; Hey, worship me. I'll give you all the kingdoms of this world. &gt;&gt; He was tempted. The prophet said he was tempted. He was tempted because he knew what to lay wait for him. He was tempted. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He drew back. Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt worship the Lord God only. Let me tell you, if the Bible says he endured for seeing the joy that was set before him, you know what that joy was? That joy was that you might have joy. &gt;&gt; That I might have joy. &gt;&gt; Where I was bound, I was covered over with darkness that I might have joy. That you might have joy. You know why he stood? You know why he did that? When he was offered to take the easier way. You know why he did that? &gt;&gt; Yes. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why he did it. &gt;&gt; He didn't do it for himself cuz it wasn't the easy way. It was the harder way that he chose. &gt;&gt; Thou has chosen the harder way. &gt;&gt; And that way is my way. &gt;&gt; And because of this choice, a huge portion of heaven &gt;&gt; awaits thee. He could have given an easy a substitute, but he gave himself. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; he doesn't want substitutes. He wants you. &gt;&gt; He shed his blood that he might bring you back to himself. And the spirit, the life that was within that blood would go and begin to sound. The priest would ride the land. The Holy Spirit moving throughout the land has been sounding that trumpet and saying, "You're free. &gt;&gt; You're free." But but Lord, I got this I got this habit. I got this situation in my head. You're free. &gt;&gt; You're free. What do you mean? Just drop it. Just drop it. &gt;&gt; When you hear the trumpet, the trumpet is the authority to drop it. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? This isn't a good message. It's God letting you know what belongs to you. &gt;&gt; It's been broke up all over the board. It's not about a good message. It's God speaking to our needs. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want just half. He'll take what you're giving. But he wants all of you. &gt;&gt; If you'll give your all, he gave his all for you. And he will pour himself into your life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I say what he did for you, what he did for me, he's deserving of it all. &gt;&gt; He made a way &gt;&gt; for you and I. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, this is a moment this morning. &gt;&gt; If you need if you need God, you need the spirit of God. You need a touch in your life this morning. I'm not pulling on you. I'm just telling you right here. God has come down. &gt;&gt; And I could tell you he totally when I came back home Friday, I got home. You all know we got home late on Friday. Those you know we were there. We got home late on Friday and I could not I got off to myself. Things begin to turn. The outline was already together. Things I was already moving under that inspiration, but God began to turn it. And all of these things I couldn't hardly sleep Friday to Saturday. I was upset. I couldn't wait to get it all being bringing these parts in together because I'm telling you why this was not this is not just a message. I don't want to just preach messages. I'm interested in souls. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, you may not be a good speaker. I'm not trying to be a good speaker. I'm trying to win souls. I'm trying to lives that lives would give their all for him who gave his all for us. &gt;&gt; God, look what God did in this hour. He brought a man that didn't even have a seventh grade education and stood before great doctors. &gt;&gt; You think he didn't have to overcome the humiliation in his flesh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And stand there when he couldn't even pronounce certain words &gt;&gt; and these men behind him could pronounce those words. They could go right through them. &gt;&gt; But you know why? Let me tell you why God chose to do it that way. so that you and I could look at that and say, "God, if you took it to where we cannot even pronounce words, we may not even know those words, but if I can recognize God, if I can recognize who's in my midst, if I can recognize him, then I can re have whatever that I have need of in him, there's a longing I can have that &gt;&gt; God took a man that didn't have a seventh grade education to show his glory. &gt;&gt; To show you and I it doesn't take your intellect. God never wanted your intellect. &gt;&gt; Denominations are harvesting intellect, reasoning. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not throwing them down, but they can only operate what they're under. &gt;&gt; But God never came to harvest that. The Lamb's book of life came to call lambs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The names of the lambs &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life. Remember predestination before he came to the river Jordan, &gt;&gt; he was already a lamb. &gt;&gt; John said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Spirit laying claim on your life. You're mine. You've always belonged to me. You're my lamb. My sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say this morning, Lord, I want to give my all. I want to give my all. &gt;&gt; I want to give everything that I am, Lord. Hallelujah. Wherever you might be within your walk with God. Hallelujah. If you listen, if you want prayer here this morning, I'm here to pray with you. We're here to We're here to pray. There's other Listen, and it's not just me standing here, but all through this building, this is priest of God, &gt;&gt; and we're here to pray. We're here that that same that same breakthrough that took place in our life that it might take place in your life. Hallelujah. What What are you going to do? I'm going to give my all. I'm going to lay aside my pride. I'm going to lay aside everything else. I'm going to lay everything down because giving my all to him, he gave his all for me. &gt;&gt; I want him to have all of me. &gt;&gt; I want him to have everything that I am. I want to rededicate my life to him. &gt;&gt; I want him to have all of my life. I want him to be the preeminent and one in my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, I lay aside everything. I lay down all all of my failures. I lay aside everything, all that I am, Lord. I lay it all down at your feet. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's it. If you want to come, come on. Hallelujah. You need prayer right around here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're here to offer prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, friends. This place, this building that God gave us, these bricks could have been used for anything. They could have been used for a dance hall. They could have been used for a courthouse. But God chose that these bricks came here and God would call a group of people inside of here. Oh, I know somebody else built this, another organization, but God gave it to us as a place that he would come down and meet with you and I and draw us back to himself in a complete relationship. God gave us these grounds. God gave us this building that our lives that we might come in fellowship with God and be living testimonies of the living God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil has fought me so hard here this morning. Not here. Not here. Not in here. No wonder. All the way through. But I appreciate your prayers. God has breakthrough. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh friends, you know I'm not working anything up. I'm put I'm just want to draw you to him. I want to draw you to him. May maybe you need to make a fresh consecration. Maybe you've got some things built up in your temple. Maybe there's some things that there. It may not be oxen. It may not be other things. But maybe there's some things that you got in your temple that the Lord is just revealing and saying, "Hey, wait a minute here. I want complete perfect worship. You've allowed business. You've allowed this. You've allowed this. You've allowed so many different things to get in there." But what is he doing? He's giving you the strength. &gt;&gt; It's not him coming through with the scourge. &gt;&gt; True. But as a king, &gt;&gt; a ruler, you're stepping forth like Nehemiah and saying, "Not going to go inside these walls." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not going to go in here. This is made for worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Devil, my mind might be a no man's land, but it ain't meant for you. &gt;&gt; Them mind battles and everything else, it was meant for you. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, if it's a no man's land, then you know what that means? You got an opportunity to fill it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God, &gt;&gt; brother Sam. I have to keep filling and keep filling it. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; It's like when you get things and all of a sudden you make a Goodwill run. What do you do? You bring more stuff in your house. Then you make another Goodwill run. Bring more stuff. I'm going tell you, that's what you got to do with your mind. &gt;&gt; Let your mind be filled with the things of God. Don't let the devil fill it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You fill it with the things of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just walk out of a good service and just walk out under a good anointing, but go walk out of there and say, "Lord, as a king, I have been instructed to keep this temple &gt;&gt; in working condition." &gt;&gt; As a priest under Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That I'm not living for this life. I'm living &gt;&gt; for that life which is to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we just sing that and sing that song? I love him because he first loved me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him because he first love me and purchase my salvation [Music] on tree. One more time.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I know I probably asked you that 50 times today. &gt;&gt; But you know what? &gt;&gt; You love him more, don't you? Now, &gt;&gt; but you know, he's never he's never increased his love for you. He's loved you the same all the time. &gt;&gt; We're just finding more and more about the love &gt;&gt; that he's had for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say just in this moment, you know, you you know, you know how quick you know how quick it is to get back into fellowship with God. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You hear brother Bam say &gt;&gt; they're in the prayer line. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if there's something in your life that's not right," he said, "be before you get up here," he said, "because the angel of the Lord will call that out." Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know why the angel of the Lord would call that out? &gt;&gt; Not to embarrass. &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord, the reason he would call out sin or anything is because what he's what he's announcing is that you don't have no right on my son or daughter. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's not a shame. It's not shaming. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't shame. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Conviction. You know what conviction is? Is where you realize as a son and daughter of God, I don't have to live beneath this any longer. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't have to I'm I'm living beneath my privileges. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Here's what you do." He said, "Before you get up there, this is how much. Step out of line. Make it right from your heart and then get back in line." [Music] &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; You hear a voice that said, "Get back in step. You were out of step. &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Get back in step. &gt;&gt; That's how quick &gt;&gt; fellowship &gt;&gt; is restored. &gt;&gt; That's how quick it's restored. &gt;&gt; And once it's repented of, &gt;&gt; it's gone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The enemy would want to bring it up, it's gone. Right? &gt;&gt; How many times, brother Ram, stand there in a meeting and you have individuals and they were wanting in their mind they wanted to come back. They wanted to come back and they were there were things in their life they were they were ashamed of, they were sorry for the Holy Spirit called him out and said, "By the way, you got sinus condition and the Lord just healed you. And by the way, brother, your sins are forgiven you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram stopped multiple times. He stopped. He said, "Wait a minute. That wasn't what I said. But the same one who said that that sinus condition and you're healed is the same one who said your sins are forgiven you. &gt;&gt; Said to that person you've wanted to get to a place where you could put your foot back on. You've wanted to get to a place where you could come back home. &gt;&gt; How many times brother Brandham stood right there to that person and says, "You want to come back to God?" Yeah. He said, "You're back." [Music] &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; It's your heart. &gt;&gt; The heart of God came down to be able to rescue our heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you are a people after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; You came from him. You're going back to him. All right. &gt;&gt; How many can say right now, I'm giving him my all. &gt;&gt; I'm giving him my all. &gt;&gt; You know what? This week, give him your confession. &gt;&gt; Just take just take those lips and say, you know what? These lips were not meant to speak negative things. &gt;&gt; I can't live this. I can't do this. But you go forward from here and saying, I am a daughter of God. I am a child of God. The Holy Ghost is mine. This is under my feet. Whatever it is, don't let that confession stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, what what are you talking about?" I'm talking about you taking the word of what God has spoken and you watch the word transform your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This isn't mind over matter. &gt;&gt; This isn't positive thinking. It's a positive word from a positive God made positive by his presence that is coming to a people that says, "Amen. That's my promise. &gt;&gt; Did you want to try to take it away? Nope. I'm not going to take it away. You get up tomorrow morning and it feels like a Monday morning. &gt;&gt; Still mine anyhow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know why? You're a king in that moment. &gt;&gt; And as a king, you're not going to infringe in this temple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I'm a priest and I'm going to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're kings and priests. &gt;&gt; The enemy said, "Well, you ain't much of a daughter of God." You know what a ruler says? Shut up. &gt;&gt; Shut up. I am what I am by the grace of God. I am what he said I am. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; And as a ruler, you're standing there over that temple. You know the you know the they had guards in the temple. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; and you know what them guards were for in the temple is to keep that temple from others coming in there and infringing in it. &gt;&gt; Why? So that the priest could do what they were called to do. &gt;&gt; And you are a king and a priest. You've been authorized as a son and daughter of God to tell the devil. If the devil is anywhere in your life out from under your foot, he's out of his place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm through preaching. I'm just exhorting. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, pin the devil right in and just wedge him in. Don't let go. Your victory. Listen, your victory. Don't let don't release it. But let that victory take it into your bosom. &gt;&gt; Take it into your life. No matter what the need might be here this morning, take it in. Just surrender it all. Surrender all your thoughts. Surrender all the negativity and let the Holy Spirit come in and do what he desires to do in your life. &gt;&gt; And then watch his transforming power in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; We stand on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll say right now, amen. &gt;&gt; And we're right in his presence. And the prophet said, there's no higher court of appeal than the presence of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When God has said, when God has spoken, let every other voice keep silent. &gt;&gt; God is in his holy temple. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; That's 51 times. &gt;&gt; Jubilee plus one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He said, "Preach." Here we go now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. It's all because of the lamb of God. This liberty we have, not just in here, but that liberty. Why? Your worship, your worship is based on the liberty that he's brought in your life. &gt;&gt; Nobody can worship him like you can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To whom much has been forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he forgave me of much. &gt;&gt; Hey, he forgave you of much, too. I don't care if you were a Sunday school person. He forgave you of a lot, too. He forgave you of your old nature. &gt;&gt; Being proud that you had more stars than everybody else in Sunday school. He forgave you of that. He came down and touched our lives. &gt;&gt; My my my I said, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; I say, "Worthy is the lamb." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's worthy. He's above every demon. He's above every habit. He's above every situation. He is the Lord of glory. His name is above every other name. I don't care what disease it is. His name's above it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what family stream it is. His name's above it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. My past is clear. My future's clear. Sister Dalton, I was going to display this today. I could send it out on our thread and in the email. Sister Dalton had a question. Brother Brandham, I was born illegitimately. So, they brought the question in the den room. I've got the handwritten letter right here. Brother Brandham, he went through it. You heard him say it in the message, too. He said, 'W what it is is not one of them could enter into the congregation of God for how many generations? He said what it was? It was the blood of bulls and goats. There wasn't a blood strong enough &gt;&gt; that could take care of that. &gt;&gt; And in this letter, I'll send it out to you here this week. In this letter, Brother Brandon writes on the bottom of it, he says, "Sister Dalton, don't let this trouble you no more." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The new birth &gt;&gt; corrects it all. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's a blood. &gt;&gt; It's strong enough. &gt;&gt; It's strong enough to break every hold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you apply the blood to your life, it's strong enough to break every hold. There might be stains that Clorox can't get out of your clothes, but the blood of Jesus Christ, it can loosen every hold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It sends it right back on the accuser &gt;&gt; who's responsible for it in the first place. He's got a lot to answer for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm free. &gt;&gt; We're free. &gt;&gt; Are you free today? &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; I I don't know what I I don't know. I feel like running or cartwheeling. I I'm just so happy right now. You say, "Brother Samuel, why?" Because of what he's done in my life. I know where I'm standing. You know where you're standing. There's a flag that's strong enough. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your loved one, lift them right now before God. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you know right where they're at." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I walk up and down here praying for different ones, loved ones, young people sitting right here. I call their name out. &gt;&gt; You know what? I know the enemy can hear it in another dimension. And I let him know, you got to take your hands off of them. &gt;&gt; They're coming home. I don't care what kind of condition they're in. &gt;&gt; God, give the parents strength. Let them give them fortitude. I know the enemy try to trouble their mind. Give them strength, Lord. And Satan, take your dirty hands off of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my sister. That's my brother. They're God's children. They're his daughter. They're his son. &gt;&gt; I believe that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; We're witnesses of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're expecting. &gt;&gt; We're expecting it. &gt;&gt; My my my Turn around. Just shake hands with somebody. Say, just let him know how much you love him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to pass this off. God bless you. [Music] Well, once like a bird in prison I dwell. No freedom from my sorrow I fell.
