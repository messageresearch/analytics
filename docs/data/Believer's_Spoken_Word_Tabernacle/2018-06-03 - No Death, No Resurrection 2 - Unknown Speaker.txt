the Lord will just how God will show up like that many times to let us know when even when we would say we haven't merited your favor Lord but God lets us know this is not about you working to earn my favor my favor has already been granted and that's a rest that's a that's a rest that we have in him aren't you thankful for that man this is not this is our desire our lay our real labor in our lives

into the word if we could to Ephesians chapter 2 Thank You musicians which one we're gonna begin reading it verse 14 and maybe right before we start reading let's just have a word of Prayer let's just pray together our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we we come Lord to this moment of the service father we're just asking Lord that you would have your way we pray that father as you have given us Lord

need of you Lord different needs but yet we need you and you're the only one that can meet these needs Lord may we take those desires that we have on our heart Lord and know that God that that desire is not something we place there Lord but father there is a promise Lord that is ordained of God for that desire Lord that it might be fulfilled Lord we hold our hearts and our desires before you we give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 for he is our peace who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us that was a separation and we realized that we were separated from God the separation was by deception is that right Eve was not forced to do neither was Adam forced to do we understand that Eve was deceived and then Adam in the transgression but yet there was a wall between us anybody like walls I mean I like walls for the roundest building right here but y'all like walls in your home you like walls in the church everybody didn't quite you don't know what I'm going just asking questions I mean there are certain places I like walls to be and then there's other places we don't want walls to me is that right and this right here was a wall though not a physical wall but it was a spiritual wall that was hindering and keeping two from coming together there's only one that could take care of this it took one who was the greater aren't you glad for that he became one of us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace so this is not the old creation made over this is a new creation not the old man it's a new man and that he might reconcile this word reconciled is a little different word than what's used in some of the other places this means fully that he might fully reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were not a man you love him this morning may God bless you bless his word that your being seated look at this thought on reconciliation and when I look at this and just poring over it as we've been looking at these scriptures and they've been on my heart for months and months but you know it's kind of like when we we think of the term when we look at Redemption we know how that the Prophet brought it to light for you and I'm bringing examples from the Old Testament and he would give us the example of that of a pawnshop and I know there's pawnshops that we have around in our city and a lot of places have pawnshops and when we we think of that a pawnshop itself is things that where when someone would have a debt that arises and they need they need the money or they need something to pay off that debt so then they'll take whatever it is a possession and they will pawn that in order to get money from that but yet what was pawned when we look at it in terms bringing into the spiritual and redemption it's what has always belonged to God it was not God who pawned you and I off but we realized that our parents in the beginning not your parents that you and I would have or were born out but it was by an act that was done in the beginning that was not according to the divine will of God it was permissive will of God but not the divine and perfect will of God and and you and I today here we are we we still even with being born again of the Spirit of God you still battle the effects of that decision that was made back there we still we thank God for healing in our body and God knows we need healing but yet if we're healed here in our physical body we live long enough we're going to get sick again and we also think that for there is there is a real strength that can move within our lives to wear that even in our spirit realm because when you're depressed or you're down it's not your body that is down or depressed but it's your spirit man your emotions and then we're thankful to God that there can actually be a ministering within that spirit to actually help you and I come into a place to where that God can use us remember Elisha think of this for a moment Elisha was always God's prophet Elisha was always a true man of God but after he came off of Mount Carmel and his brother Brandon tells us like this he said the mind of Christ pulls back from him and Herald that Elisha goes into that cave when you look at where Elisha was that Elisha was in a place in a situation brother bran will say at many different places he was overworked he said he was overtired he goes into all of this regarding Elijah's life now even though Elisha was as predestinated as he was even though that he was divinely used by God he still did not take away that Elisha walked in a flesh body it still didn't take it away that he walked in a body but where in that flesh or that emotions could get down and we see that with Elisha where Elisha himself even speaking in that time perhaps like many of us have felt or maybe you feel that way this morning that Elisha said I'm the only one then we know that wasn't in God's speaking that was not even the prophetic gift within Elijah's life that was speaking but that was that man part in that part that you and I have to pack around but notice how God dealt with it God didn't say to him with this is foolishness what are you doing you're a prophet here but God worked with him to bring him in back to a place little by little he's calling him out of the cave and he works to bring him to a place to where that his spirit now is R is refreshed to where that now he's ready to listen God is helping him to come out of his depression if we could call it that way and you realized that within it this is such a time I could labor more on this here within this service but it just goes to show you and I and I trust we can take a glimpse of this that how that within our lives though our soul being redeemed but at all it puts us in a place of things that you and I or go through and things that come about in our life that it creates even more so in our life of Hungary for the redemption of our body because we realize that this body that we have now this is not my inheritance it's my possession and so it's there we're longing to come into that place to where that there will be no more times of or where you're down and no times where you need to take a time of rest to get off but yet there is a it so completely where everything sickness and everything else is gone and done away with and that what God has done in our soul is a witness of what we're going to we are waiting on the redemption of the body so reconciliation begins within and the final part and final stage for us is there even in the change of our body so we recognize this is it's an ongoing it's moving but when I think of this when one who stands in the pawnshop and how that God himself coming down he showed all of this many in many different places and redemptive types but he had there had to be a paying of the price and God himself as we looked at it God came down and he United with with his creation this creation was not a creation of Mary although it looked like creation that was already here he looked like any other man that had been here upon the earth or was there was nothing the Bible says no beauty that we should desire him but yet God came down and the reconciling began there at the River Jordan that's what makes that place where the Holy Spirit coming down to where now here is the Lamb of God and the Dove of God the nature's are lined up in order for there to be a uniting or reconciling and then from that we see as we're reading in the scripture and many of the places then there has to be a payment there's a need of a payment to be paid in order for us to be fully reconciled back to God or make a way for that full reconciliation so when he went pays it it's like when you would look at it when you have you know in a pawn shop there are things you know I haven't been to a lot of pawn shops but some places where I've been that there would be of like that where you can stand there and you can actually have the payment and when you make the payment on something and let's just say it's this handkerchief you can pretend whatever it is but here it is then it might be sitting right there on that bench like a counter but yet I must make a payment for that when I make a payment for it then I can move to thoroughly claim or redeem what it is that I have redeemed through payment when I make the transaction and I give them whether this five dollars or whatever when I give them that five dollars that is better I have redeemed it or reconciled it by payment but I must thoroughly redeem it or thoroughly fully reconcile it by bringing to me what it is that I've paid for it now let's look at this in the scripture in Romans chapter 5 verse 6 for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die and right but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us there was nothing about us in the condition we were in that was welcoming but remember what he did the Bible listen this is not just words when the scripture says he endured the cross for the joy that was set before him the joy was not our n'gou leanness the joy was not that we were sinners are you in for me the joy was not that the joy was what it was that would actually through this death be able to release what he knew was there the whole time so you see it's got to have faith it's got to have confidence that's the same way it is even within your marriage it's the same way it is within the church it's the same way it is when you're working among people there has to be something that you're looking beyond and you can see all of this out here that's on this but yet within you're looking and saying God is there something helped me to see what is beyond because if we never see what it is that we are looking at what we hear or what we have seen or what we have heard we're never able to move beyond and actually come to this place how many of you believe this is the kind of life were to live I believe this with all my heart it wasn't just something to wear that he gave his self for us and then we would live such selfish lives about our emotions and our feelings and yet our emotions and our feelings are real but this is where the strength of God on the inside gives you an eye ability by the access of that divine nature to be able to bring our lives in subjection to say this is how I feel but this is what God's Word says and this is what my desire is and you start with that and you watch the Holy Spirit as you submit to that you watch the cleansing flow of the Spirit of God it's just like cleaning out an old wound if you don't clean out the wound the wound will eventually canker and you'll have to remove that part of the body but once it's cleaned there's got to be a flow of the water no wonder that the Lord Jesus would direct Moses there in the book of Exodus when he's talked about a Laver whereby met them priests in order to worship were to come in by that Laver and it must be filled with running water and the Laver was not something you dipped out of but it had a spigot at the bottom so that the running water source that was put in the Laver could actually come out so that the hands and the feet could be washed because our doings and our goings we constantly need to be washed by the water of the word one washing of the soul but continual washing while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him now watch this verse for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life so you and our already reconciled as suarez payment the payment was rendered through the offering up of a perfect Lamb of God we were reconciled unto God in other words so that God Himself could begin to move and work within us bringing us into that redemptive work that was already done for us here's the word reconciled in this scripture it's to change or exchange as coins for others of equivalent value could you look at your life or me look at my life and say yes my life was was of equivalent to that of the Lord Jesus could you do that no you couldn't say that but yet down on the inside come on now he became one of us the Bible says it very clear over and over Hebrews chapter 2 for he is one with that of his brethren health which he is not ashamed to call them brother hallelujah so here he is he's coming to release by by Battle of the offering up of his life he's come to release in order that you and I might be dealt with and brought unto Him in full reconciliation Hinch to reconcile those who are at variance ah you know a person could read their Bible they could be ever so faithful at churches and everything else but yet if it's not been born again it's works and that's still emiti that still variance Paul says in enrollment that the carnal mind is enmity against God it cannot be subject and yet you could take of a carnal mind and the carnal mind says I do this I do this I do this we understand we believe it's something within your heart when you have been born of the Spirit of God you desire to please God you desire even when when God is he deals with your life a correction comes you desire to move within that but yet the carnal mind the carnal mind itself Paul said is enmity it can't be subject how can it not be subject and when it's doing this doing this doing this that's not the subjection God is looking for God does not want the subjection where ever I'm doing everything Lord on my life is every dot every gentle but God says what about your heart I don't want a wife who's afraid of me I don't want somebody who's doing something because out of fear it cannot be subject that word subject is the same one that Paul would use in relations of husband and wife that the wives be subject unto their husbands and all thing a voluntary attitude aren't you glad that he made a way for that but you know you don't have to walk and where it's enmity no matter what was done it was still enmity no matter how the Pharisees they were right on but yet it was still enmity Oh glory be to God so notice it must be his death in verse 11 it goes on to say and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement or the word there is fully reconciled so the payment was made but yet the Holy Spirit now because payment has been made the Holy Spirit comes down to actually claim or thoroughly redeem what he's already redeemed what shall abandon brings this in souls that are in prison now he speaks and he says you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all that he died for was written in that book and he could not leave his mediatorial seat until he had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross he couldn't redeem it at the cross no he did redeem it at the cross but he couldn't redeem it at the cross you see he paid the price but for redemption is where the Holy Spirit the doubt that led the lamb that same God now comes to bring you into complete fellowship with him that's thoroughly redeemed oh my until he had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay there look at this smile we could just preach so much on this he had to stay on there to make intercessions until that last person was finished glory he had to stay there he's still there this morning if I'm here I'll trust he's still there coz you and I would not survive a nanosecond without him but when he changes the garment it isn't that we willfully desire to do wrong but it's speaking that we must constantly have a mediator there the Spirit of God in our life ties us into the sacrifice and he's there on our behalf but when he changes the garment that day and he moves from lamb to lion there will come a change in our vesture we shall be changed as I write a man thoroughly redeemed I think of this ransoming work you and I were in need of redemption we were sold into slavery we didn't ask to come the way that we come there's a lot of scars and marks no doubt upon our lives we didn't ask for all but all of that here all of these things accumulate from that even of the fall but there was a need for a ransom there's a need for a ransom and how that God Himself coming down becomes the ransom because you and I were trapped and we couldn't get out we needed someone to trap to undo the trap that we were in but send you it sounds like you're saying that there was almost like two people in one sense absolutely there was a man a woman who was trapped down there on the inside and that's the one that he came to redeem he never came to highlight the fallen character but he came to break the clouds back so that the redeemable attribute of God could be displayed think about this in our life of how that our life was lived but yet he himself would move down by his death his death made a way if there was no death they were bidden been no uniting the sign of this is simple we we understand that we know that well evidently God wants us to hear it and I believe it replies much deeper than us just looking back at something of a story because it's over and over a matter of fact it's the theme of the whole scripture it is the book of redemption what we find in the end time is the Lamb himself coming forth not in part but in the very fullness to take the book and here he is revealing himself and making knowing himself to his attributes in the last age yet at the same time he's fixing to make the final transition because this is the finishing up of the mystery of God there will be no other age to the Gentiles there'll be no other message there'll be no other time this is the final time this is that moment think of this and the message the first seal he said the lamb in the time of intercessory was back here he knew that there were names in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world and as long as them names had never been manifested on earth as you now watch this had never been manifested on earth as yet he had to stay there as an intercessor so until that name you mean you mean when I was actually born and my mom and dad no no that's not that's not the name we're talking about that's not the manifestation that he was waiting on he had to stay there because he came to die for those that God had ordained to eternal life by his foreknowledge he saw them not by his own will now this is big his will was that none should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew who would and who would not remember there are many that will have look at this this book this is the book of redemption it's also the book of life you with me there's things that you can look at scriptures right here in this book and God by His grace you are illuminated not just to know it not just to quote it but it's illuminated in your life but yet there's others that can look at those same scriptures and it doesn't have the same meaning to them it doesn't have the same depth what is it it's the same book but it shows there's two sections within the same book are you with me there is depth levels of depth amen therefore he said as long as there was one name had never been declared in earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name aren't you glad I'll tell you one reason the rapture couldn't go before cuz that name for me had not been declared well what about you what about saying if the rapture would have come you know God would just come down no no no no no no it can't work that way he's God he made a way so that you could be drawn to him not forced not forced he's not driving you he's calling you hallelujah he's not pushing he's leading the sons of God are pushed by the Spirit of God no they're led by the Spirit of God amen oh my Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name but as soon as that final name had been splashed in that Clorox or bleach then his intercessory days was over now the Bloods already been shed they're right the price has already been paid but the splashing of the name in that Clorox bleach is when the Holy Spirit has drugged you through every stage and every process to where the name that characteristic of the word that's a corresponding part in this hour when that has been raised up and been quickened then it's been splashed thoroughly redeemed and when it's been thoroughly redeemed you're sealed unto the day of the redemption there's no going back there's no desire to go back the only place you want to go back is where you come from well glory let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's holy be holy still and he leaves the sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment seat woe unto those outside of Christ in so we're led here here is the Lamb of God he's led the Bible says he's led as a lamb to the slaughter he became the way it's very familiar Scripture it's quoted it's in our Christian bookstores if you still got one around where you live I am the way the truth and the life but as we said you know we look at it before if that door is the way out of here that is the way now they're right out of here out of this building there are multiple ways you can go out but there's not multiple ways into the kingdom of God there is one way and he said I am V wave remember man could not get back in where man had been exiled from the very presence of God God man could not get back in but God come down and he removed the middle wall of partition by becoming one of us Oh glory be to God you see when we look at it the real you and the real me was dead the real me was not alive the real you was not alive you see this is not a dead and then racing up the old man again no no no no we don't want that old man raised up there's got to be a new man not the old man and when the new man comes in the new man has authority over the old man hallelujah you know 1 we don't want the old man we want that new man we want that new man to be the one who's on display glory be to God now think of this here he made a way by our own free will because as the Lamb and we look back and they've at the beginning we mentioned moments ago Eve herself was not forced into it it was deception but yet by her own free will she gave up himself and the same when you look now with Adam Adam was not deceived but Adam by his own free will a desire in order to redeem her but yet when we look at this and we bring it down we know that it must be a willingness on our part you know that's the whole that's the whole of the Christian life is willingness I mean know that's the truth God's desire is all willingness when the prophet will preach the message token you'll find that he'll mention in inner and interject points throughout the message coming around clear at the end he'll speak of the token also been medicine that you need to take let me tell you something you not only need to take that medicine when you yourself have that of a soul problem but you also need to take that medicine continuing to live of that tokin life and apply it to every situation in your life it isn't this medicine well it took care of my soul I'll go find something else now to help me take care of my spirit help me take care of my body but we realized God can work for many other ways but yet it's the medicine that God has provided for you and I this age you'd know it as well as I do it's an unfit late age for Humanity to live in there's things where you are sometimes here you're up here you're down I'm not talking about being in and out of church I'm talking about even in your emotional makeup that has nothing to do with you being a weak Christian or being a one who's not in victory did you speaks of the humanity of where you're at in this age and especially with all the complexities of this time it is all mounted up but yet God made a way that you and I Winnie ministers to us and if there's things that we see within our life he will come and deal and move in our life if there's a willingness I want you think of this if you've got something against somebody else you know God won't move that out of your heart you got to be willing you've got to be willing you have to no matter how much it's preached on you've got to be willing but you see the preaching and the ministering of the word is to bringing you and I into that place where it's placing that giving authority to the new man to put that old man in subjection not just here on these grounds but everywhere you go and in your home mama he is that way notice Jesus would even speak in his word many many places coming to me all you that are heavy laden and I will give the arrest the Reverend did the work of redemption was already paid think of it even those who were ones who were true followers of John's message and they were there in acts 19 and they were waiting on the fulfilment of the atonement and when Paul came and began to minister concerning that he realized they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet payment had already been made so that they couldn't receive it well why didn't they just receive it if God already made a payment why didn't he just give it to him because it's comes by willingness willingness he wants to bring our will in line with his will he will not he's a gentleman he will not override he must bring it in line God knows how to kill that old man he knows how to kill him he knows how to lure and bring him into a place to where he can move down and really put the death hold on him but it is it's where the man himself where you and I come to that place where we no longer want to live that life we no longer we're tired it's not just that life but we're tired of the life our desire is I want to serve Him you see serving God it's not about what will help you and be a better person out in society lord I need to be saved because this drinking problem I think that's wonderful for somebody to be free from drinking but that's not what Redemption is all about Redemption is about completely free you into the very service of Almighty God God's design listen Redemption is not that you become some great moral person I believe that Redemption when it moves into your life it will produce that but it's not just about having good morality I heard of saying one time so true good morality will keep you out of jail but it takes the blood of Jesus Christ to keep you out of hell it's more this message did not come to produce good people it came to transform lies now the Prophet warns us in Christ the mystery he said many people they take Christianity and say we will make converts by it's governments Muslims do the same thing Muslims do the same thing Muslims got a profit they can claim that but you see this isn't about making converts by governments the word must be preached and the word will have an effect in it will draw upon the heart and the life of the believer hallelujah so the Lamb of God Himself made a way that the lambs could come forth I always think of how that God told Paul when Paul was getting ready to run out of Corinth you know Paul wanted out of there I mean it was a bad bad place but God told him and said you stay here I ain't gonna let no man touch you I got much people in this city well Lord if you got much people I mean didn't you just die for them didn't get me can't the Holy Ghost just come no it's got to be willingly they've got to respond to the gospel of their salvation you see it's a jubilee call whereby the atonement has been made but as the atonement was made there within the tabernacle there was a priest who was a free man that would ride through the land sounding the trumpet but there is an offering that has been made and you can go free so the sounding of that trumpet was actually the throw and release of the blood life to let the people know you can stop right now what you're doing and go free that's a real Jubilee Oh glory spoke a words original seed he said there he was he was God's Word made manifest he died in order to pay the debt of your high breeding there it is he said what it is that you could die to yourself until you're no more yourself and be filled with his word believing his word and then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow so his death made a way for us to die Munro's I read it to you some weeks ago out of the message north or not Villa Ram tells us you know how is over and over we realized when he died we were there in him and we died also we died to our pride we dived and died and all all of these different things and the Prophet picks it up and says right there what took place at Calvary it was broadcasting of what was going to take place with all the seed but there was going to be a death of dying out but there would be a resurrection of that life that was hidden there the whole time to be to God oma think of this what is it he said God is manifesting continuing the work of his first son his only begotten see that died for our high breeding life that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of God that through the church might flow the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in Christ I think of this God's purpose and his desire remember how Paul would pray in Ephesians he spoke of it in the first part of Colossians spoke of it in inter and Thessalonians the desire was that the full purpose itself would be expressed through the lives of believers as sons and daughters of God all all of the land every one of those parts of the land remember when they were born those patriarchs that hear their mother's utter doubt and their name gave them position in the land although they're down there in bondage and they're down there they were brought into that bondage but there had to be one ransom and get them out is that right and then as they come out not here there's been a price that's been paid but yet God does not just you know move back everything and God remove it there are tests and there are trials along the way there are things that comes up that God remembered what it says in the book of Deuteronomy he desired to prove them and humble them to what was in my heart did God not know what was in the heart God did but God desired because God's not going to falsely accuse come on somebody hallelujah God once let's see what manifests within the heart so God allows conditions itself to manifest what is there and even when it came down to God sending all having Moses send the spies over into the land now remember God could have just brought them right on in they could have just kept on walking the waters would have parted right open they could have walked right in but God let it be known that this is a greater decision you see they made a decision even all the mixed multitude that came out of Egypt they made an initial decision is that right they heard a call they made an initial decision they came out into the wilderness and then even after God moving there in the wilderness we realized that there were things that were cut away and removed from them their ornaments they removed their ornaments we see how God is dealing with them sanctifying them but yet there comes to that place before the crossing over there at the River Jordan where there is a need for a greater consecration and a greater sanctification because now notice this willingness it must be complete willingness that the people of God will come into their inheritance even though that inheritance all of those who live there in that time they could say that that's my inheritance right there that's my inheritance right there but yet you've got to come the provided way there's already been a price paid but notice God cannot manifest and reveal what's in your life really in the wilderness he can only reveal when it gets in position in the land because then his life can flow over that potential and bring it to reality how many say Lord flow help me Lord let it flow because that flow in the land is not just automatic it's not just the Ruby company or puppets and we're just you know moved around by strings and know we've got decisions to make as Paul could say yield your members yield I thought it was automatic no no you yield your members as instruments unto righteousness oh mama now notice this oh ma we come to this place the ramen goes on and talking about it and he says this is in paragraph 207 if you know you got it back there he said the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long as it's laying here it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit the works of God then visions come power comes humility comes all your know-it-all is gone that's right amen all your know-it-all might know it all is gone well by the Samuel there's a lot of sir still some know-it-alls that I've got as everybody else does here in the room but yet once you've got that new man on the inside you've got authority to catch them know-it-alls because everything that comes out of you and I is not just boys just flowing like the roses everything every thought I tell you if I thought this it must be the Holy Ghost they don't mean that at all all you are know at all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives there it is because he died I live when I die he lives again and when I die he promised me life and I die out to myself so in order I can have his life how do I do it look at these great big astounding words by taking his word his seed put his seed in here by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said now think of how that when the Lord Jesus here when he comes here on the earth and you know think of it here on the very first the doctrine and really the heart and soul of redemption him making a way so that you and I can be born again and he's speaking to a learning man my by the name of Nicodemus and he tells him except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you know it's like looking at something and it can be right here in your face and you don't see it unless a man is born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God he has to go upon different things that he can make it or what is made to him you know he can look and say well they say it's this or they say it's that but it must be by a personal experience of the king of this kingdom to where now an understanding it moves into that life not that you understand every single thing but it's where there is there is a sight that goes beyond this world and there's an understanding where God himself he's opening his self to you and there is a communication a channel that is divinely opened between you and God and how that God will speak to your heart and you look into your life and in the very depths of your soul there has been a real experience now listen for me now there has been a real experience remember this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation there's a lot of sensations but listen friends it must translate in to a real experience and when you've got an experience you've come from somewhere to where you are now there has been a passing from death unto life nothing wrong with sensations but it's got to produce a live battle tally up with the word that is an experience that you are no longer the same no no it wasn't that it was done away with emotion that's not what the Prophet was preaching that's not what he was laying out he was having us so that look where is that right now here we find in this hour it's the time for the headstone to come and the Bible said that Zerubbabel have laid the foundation and Zerubbabel will bring forth the capstone remember zerubabbel is the one who holds the plummet in his hand he holds the plumb line and remember what was being measured out was the very City of Jerusalem which the city of Jerusalem is that type of Zion the Brian is that right and we see that even from the Book of Revelations but notice the plumb line everything itself must be right in line and God would have a ministry in this hour the finishing out of what he himself started and he himself threw the ball who said I will build my church he is the capping of this church he has inspired his messengers he has inspired the ministry he has inspired the lively stones that are part of this habitation all the way down through the ages and now he stands in this hour it cannot be crooked in one place but it must be the plumb line it must be dovetail with the word in order for the dog to come down it's got to be a lamb nature and that's why here the very fullness of the person of Jesus Christ once again here in Brad form it is the son of man in the bride's body he's been building this whole time except a man be born again and Nicodemus this guy was a smart guy a smart fella he said how in the world can somebody enter into his mother's wombs a second time you wouldn't do no good anyhow you could look back to listen to me you can look back on your life and say man I'm five I'll tell you what there's things back there I wish I had never done sure everybody right across this building say how I wish there's things here I wish there's things there because even though after God has done such a work in your life you still have that memory yes sir but notice even within that even if you could go back and everything that you ever done wrong you actually had the opportunity to say hey go back and this you can correct this and correct this and correct this that steal would not be acceptable because whether you did anything or not you still had to be born again no matter except the man look at Jesus given the formula except a man be born of water and of the Spirit the word and the spirit come together he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so even though we are called to enter our inter is by willingness but remember he himself must be the one to bring us into that place of complete submission because if you did it or I did it there's glory on our part but he himself looked that's the same way with the rapture it's not us in our own cells of mine I'm really bringing myself in submission no no it's him it's his power it's his working that's bringing us into submission to believe things that you can look at and say I don't know if that's true about me or not but he's seeing deeper and my only preaching the five today or what I know I'm preaching angels but it's him working by his word to bring you and I into submission so that we think it not robbery to be equal with God ma not which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto you you must be born again now look at this program says it like this and it wasn't so for in the beginning I love this he said every man's got to be born again and this sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus the Son of God then you surrender yourself completely to Christ and Christ comes in and writes a book of Acts through you Lord don't you want me co-author no oh maybe you want me to be the editor no I just want you to be the vessel I want you to simply be the cover the cover but bad your skin come on somebody that I can write my book of Acts through you now remember the book of Acts every day one the miracle day there was times the trials then there was times where the Bible says and the churches had rest then there was times of trials and then there was times where a great man of God Apostle Paul where people were healed mightily in his ministry where that there was even that demons were cast out mighty men of God and then there times that God will have you let down in a basket why less this guy gets exalted well every time I pray I'd see we're going to be praying for you pretty shortly Lord given patience help them be long-suffering lord help him stand faithful Lord while they're waiting on an answer how about just say every time I pray I believe he hears me when he answers that's up to him notice the Lord Jesus says it like this I'm trying to come down here the Lord Jesus says it like this in Matthew 9 16 no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for bad which is put into it fill up to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse anybody have to wear patches on their jeans man I use mom my mom used to make me wear patches I got a brand new pair of jeans and she put patches on before I could ever get holes in them you know I'm talking about why they last longer here I was walking around with their patches you know them double knee things you could crawl around on rocks and them patches were harder than the rocks I probably still have a pair of them jeans today it might only be the patches left 4s them it's already disintegrated but you look at their patches it takes away I like a good patchwork quilt ones nice and warm I don't like a real quilt I know about them fake imitation ones I'm talking with a nice quilt but you know if you had a nice here you had maybe let's just say on this wall this white wall and then you just put like some type of blue and you looked at you thought what in the world brother rich are you all gonna paint that or you gonna take care of that that looks horrible don't want a blemish you see God doesn't want to just do patchwork he don't want to just do patchwork he wants to release his victory in you and that that victory might be made manifest in your life this not putting down it's calling you up neither do men look at this neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved the new line where does the new one come the new one comes with a new man it's got to be a new man and then that wine on the inside of the Holy Ghost oh my it's producing it's growing it's moving within our life what's they're doing it's bringing forth what is potential to reality look at this in Costas chapter one verse 20 having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies sometime sometime at one time alienated and enemies in your mind where were your enemies and alienated in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight who this word present I love this word this word present means to bring one and place him by his side no wonder he told Moses there is a place to present you who's you the real you the real you the new man not the old man but to present you the new man holy unblameable Unruh provable but see you look at and you think but this is what I did and I did this and I did this and I prayed and asked y'all to forgive me you did ask God to forgive you that's exactly right there had to be repentance but remember it wasn't the real you that did it the real you was still dead the real you was still dead but remember listen to me now God is not an adulterer he cannot marry you if you've got a living husband there right so he has to kill or there has to be a death to that God in Haran will hit man Ngati Hine go hit man God didn't say let me get a life insurance policy for how hitman holder live good know everything is is so designed to bring you into that place to where you die to that first husband it's not just divorced divorcing good enough divorced thing good enough but there has to be a death and when there's a death then you can be married David could not take Abigail until May ball nay bell was dead was right but Nabal died in his heart when it was whispered to him David and his men he died within his heart she herself was announcing David's coming David is present and a Bible says immediately in his heart hallelujah oh my how we can stand there like a real Abigail this morning and saying the king is coming he's already come here but he's coming oh my and you holding unblameable Unruh provable in his sight oh my look at this here this for a moment in the message communion man I love this levin talks about these two books he says like this book here the two books being worn the book of life the first book of life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life as I was explaining to some young sisters at the house this afternoon there's a little grain of life laying there that you wonder where did it come from what these strange things I was saying this taking for myself like II was going to say William Branham well forty years ago the william branham it isn't the same one tonight you see that's the testimony that Christ brings in the life he's not the same one tonight that he was before if someone back there would say William Branham he was a rank rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Brennan in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me you remember the RAM was talking about one of his nephews you don't know it to be his nephew but that's exactly who it was the one of them the young man who was actually within it that he himself you know brother Ram begins to tell us and the message paradox he has this strain coming from that of the father and this of the mother all these natural attributes that are coming down and brother Ram begins to talk to the mom and Daddy and brother man tells tells him and said that boy needs to be born again and the daddy said but brother branham he's come to the tabernacle he's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with REM says that may be all well and good he said but that Myung Man still needs to be born again you see what it was there were things that were the Prophet now look at this there are things that the Holy Spirit was able to pick up and point out that there was something that still wasn't dead I'm telling you friends he might have seen while he was this he was that it might have seemed like this guy he was a humble guy or this but there was still something there about that first nature that was prevailing to where the Prophet could say he needs to be born again I thank God for honesty like that don't you this young man he was riding the tabernacle he'd been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but he had not been converted with REMSA dough and his mental ex he's trying his best to overcome it but he'll never be able to overcome it he must be born again but aren't you glad aren't you glad that though you can look down to your family tree and see all these different streams but greater is He that is in you or you still have the war you strength to battle but in the differences this is the difference this was the difference this young man was not willing to get right are you with me he was not willing to get right he was not willing to go apologize to the young lady he was not willing and the Prophet said ah something's wrong you're negative and leave did you you see listen friends it's where when the Word of God touches our heart we can ever set we can set in ourselves and every one of us can set here I'm right I'm right I'm right I'm right this but when the Holy Spirit begins to touch on the inside and deal with your heart if your hearts already been turned you can't stay in that condition because why the middle wall has already been torn down and there is no desire to have a wall between you and Jesus as a matter of fact the desire within your heart I said Lord I don't want any separation between me and you sometimes it's not about the things that you do sometimes it's the things that are neglected to be done yeah and you realize that that can begin to become a wall you can live and dwell and walk in the same house and yet be total strangers you with me you can go your separate ways show up the dinner together and everything else and yet be strangers to one another God doesn't want you to be strangers to one another God don't want you to be strangers in his presence God don't want you just to show up here to church on Thursday and Sunday and you show up but God wants to fellowship with you every single day he wants to fellowship with you when you're on the job he wants to fellowship with you when you're making the pie crust or when you're out in the garden or when you're down in the grocery store or you're out there washing clothes or you're out there God wants to fellowship with you we are not traditionalized people to where it has to be inside of a church our fellowship and worship with him it can be just as inviting as much as we will invite him he'll come but down in there too was another nature present predestinated was in there by God in this same body see two natures in there well I only catered to one as I grow to good as a baby down down first thing you know I become a liar I've become everything else that's a sinner because I was raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time all the time another nature was down in there all the time but remember it was just laying there's a seed there's got to be a death in order for this to come forth this is the new this is the new man when he reunites with that part of himself that seed what was it he said there was another William Brennan read be to God a little spot of eternal life down there it didn't have to be big it was little but it grows it growls yeah it grows into a mountain hallelujah from the genes of God the Word of God that was placed in there oh he says each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then I look up to the trees and I the leaf and I see you fall off last year why are you back again again where did you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now one day as I walked on that little voice and said don't never smoke drinker so forth and the young fellows and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and ellebra know there's something calling like my little eagle I'm not a chicken there's something under somewhere oh great - over whoever you are open up I want to come home willingness not forced drawn into it oh great Jehovah I want to come home there's something in me calling Ben I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more now we stand justified as though we had never sinned in the presence of God he made Elaine let me read one scripture in closing we're just going to close I can't go no further Titus 3:3 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another that's where we were living because that was our first birth that was that enmity that's where we lived but after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done so it's not but working remember even working working is not surrender work is trying to obtain by merit surrender is to submit to what he already has done now by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration rebirth new birth and renewing of the Holy Ghost he made you and I knew we're a new creation that which lay in there the whole time that you say where did you come from I was there the whole time that that was always you I think of our brother Ram says invisible Union he said that eternal that gene it found you that's a you know there's just certain things you know that you you just ponder on you look at he just and God just continues to illuminate more and more I don't know if I told you here or not but there was some about a couple years ago and there's a story of a young lady who she was taken from a hospital when she was a newborn there was a woman who came in and the woman who came in was dressed in nursing scrubs she came into the room where after the birth had taken place in the child the little baby was laying right there and she came in like maybe so many hours later and she was asking the mother as they would ask upon those wardens would you like us to take the baby down you know to whatever it's called and we'll watch over the baby and the mother thought it was a nurse but it wasn't it was a woman that lived in South Carolina that had went down into Florida and she came in there and she took that little baby that little baby was just hours old she raised that little baby and it was about two years ago that little baby now is a grown young lady she's 18 years old and then all of a sudden begin to be something happen about her life that she started she loved the person that she knew as her mother but yet she started to notice when she started to apply for grants for college that her social security number was a fraud it was not actually of a woman it was of a man that had passed away up in New Jersey or something there was a fraud so she thought I wonder what's going on so she went to go apply for a job same thing she couldn't get nowhere cuz her social security number was a fraud her didn't realize I don't think I am who I think I am I think I've been stolen now what they did was if all of a sudden they ran they ran a test then and how when they ran that test they matched up her DNA because the DNA July the DNA tied her right back into her mother taught her right back into her father and the authorities came and liberated her from that situation what was it that DNA found her what was it that found you and I that gene on the inside the Holy Spirit the water of life moving down on the inside we tried to fit here trying to fit there trying to fit in here but we'd realized hey I'm not fitting anywhere but the water of life the water of life moving over and you begin to say hey you know what I'm not of this world I will walk this way no more I believe there's a greater call on my life I believe that I believe I'm to be a server a child of God I believe that's what I am what was that the Holy Spirit moving knowing he's got a little eagle there he knows the DNA that he's sold there he knows that gene that's way down there and he moves down and he raises it up by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost now you know what I've looked at this I followed this every once in a while try to check up on and look into him on the young lady and this young lady when you look at it on her life it's a hard thing because for her they said don't use you know how do you feel about your this woman who took you she said woman who took me that's my mama she said she raised me she was good to me she wasn't ever bad to me now you and I could never say that about the devil that God was bad to us I don't care how many good things supposedly he gave to us it all I did was wreck and scar lives but you know what man that sounds good doing it thank the Lord for that on the plants but notice of all of this right here they you find within her she is dealing with so many things emotionally I thought about that young lady I thought how it must be in her mind to have to try to come to a place of acquainting with some people that you've not been around for 18 or 19 years old you've not been raised by him you might have features and look you look like him but you know for her she's having to learn that and forget her past that's in the natural but how much greater in the spiritual you see you can remember your past that God don't remember it the only past that God remembers is where you were and what you have been all the time you see you always were saved but you've just come to recognize it and he has drawn you to himself you see how God does this he brings it right down for you and I to where that in this part of our life that of the new birth and that of the continual working in our lives it's he himself drawing us even what God wants from our life he doesn't demand it he draws it out of our life he corrects us when we're wrong don't he he sure does he corrects us but remember remember correction were still admonished within correction at Hebrews 12 proverbs 3 it is as well through what was to say make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let us be exercised by the peaceable fruits thereof so God he will correct us because he's faithful to raise us in the right way he won't let his children get by remember he is your father not your grandfather grandfather's will let you get away with a lot of things man oh man grandfather's will let you get away with a lot but father's father's told the line fathers know there's a vision for you to be fulfilled but he himself said this the Bible says on us abundantly shed it on us abundantly he is working a moisture that we you and I could die to ourselves the brem said it like that he said when we think of it think of Ephesians 2 we were dead we were dead but he quickened us so the part that was dead he quickened the part that was alive he killed but he killed it when we were willing for it to die but then he raises up what he already had sown there and now were raised up we're no longer living in were raised up into heavenly places with Christ Jesus and this is where we are raised may God help us and by the moisture of the Holy Spirit our lives being in such a place to where that his victory is being made manifest through you and I listen this does not stop here when our soul has been reconciled there is a moment coming where our body there'll be a full reconciling spirit as human spirit we've done away with us the Alpha it takes place and then the glorified body a full reconciling but in the meantime right here while we walk in this life this is why we do what we do this is why we dressed the way we dress is because his desire for us as a covenant people is different we're a peculiar people oh my what a privilege friends what a privilege that he made a way that we can die to herself all throughout this building that we're just closing there's things that maybe you look in your life personally and there needs to be a real death in your life they're there in the soul but then all around this building there is also lives and every one of us that need to die daily and the only way that we can die in order for that to happen there had to be moisture that was supplied the moisture the water of life in order to bring about a death which is a rotting away of all of our own ideas and our own thoughts I'll tell you this morning I'm a witness that no matter what it is that God is more than able to give you the strength to release within you what's needed no matter what it is in your life there's a lot of listen friends there's things where there's wounds there's things where there's indifference what but whatever it is don't just well I don't have that no put it before God allow God to cleanse it if you've got you got an attitude that's not right if you got something that's out of line a feeling about something that's just not right listen to me you don't have to live with that but remember there's a flowing cleansing stream you know when you look at forgiveness forgiveness and trust are similar yet their difference trust is faith is that right faith is based on forgiveness is that right there's got to be forgiveness first in order for trust to come out of it trust comes out of forgiveness it grows out of there it's just look how God look how God deals with our lives look how he deals with it when God the way God will deal with our life is there's things the word the Bible says there's chastening there's trying where God begins to guide and direct you and I and if you and I say I don't want to do that I'm not gonna do this I'm not gonna do that and God cannot put trust in us so forgiveness it's based on trust you see the little little by little by little of what God Himself is entrusting to us and what he's asking for you and I you know what's doing he already has listen friends he knows what's within you and I but he wants to see it come he wants to see obedience come forth but the water of life is so much greater than any wound anything that could be within a life you know I did a little studying and presented some things with ministers and you didn't you look at how that there's wounds that can happen sometimes and wounds themselves if you don't get them cleaned they can become very deadly they're doing things now where they're taking a part of the placentas that normally the placenta is thrown away that you and I were wrapped in there in that water sac and they're taking that human amniotic tore apart and they're putting those things a membrane there upon those wounds because there is regenerative power within themselves that are there now you know what I looked at that I might be very simple but when I started thinking about that and looking at it I thought here is a little piece of a placenta it might be ever so small they've guarded it but that placenta was one time what a baby was housed in the water was in there and it kept that baby to where that baby could grow and develop how much more in our lives when we can apply that all we've got something greater we've got that same life that has brought life to us we have that access to allow that to flow down and give strength where there's weakness to bring healing where there's pain you believe that amen let's pray Lord Jesus Lord you're the greatest similar of your word father you're the one Lord that everything and all that it would be spoken Lord in a service Lord you know all of the parts you know every you know Lord Lord when things that would would be spoken Lord father what would be Lord for every life for every heart I pray that all God the Lord as we we look across your word this morning Lord and father is you knowing the needs upon our lives and in our lives Lord here this morning we are in needy people Lord we are in needy people Lord Jesus there's lives Lord God that throughout the building Lord hearts Lord Jesus the Lord as you spoke Lord to our lives and our hearts Lord I pray right now this morning father may we not just allow this Lord or not just let it be just another another service but I asked Lord and father from the very willingness of our heart may we reach out to you Lord your God even as was mentioned there Lord I'm coming Lord you draw us Lord if if it wasn't for you drawing us Oh My Lord God you you bring us you draw us to your self would father beyond the conditions beyond the situation's Lord may it may it burn Lord so deep within every life every one of our hearts may there not be one Lord not one in any way that would leave from here this morning with any wall still up Lord I pray God may Lord God you move Lord upon hearts that are holding that promise Lord in their life that this morning Lord is we just moved by your word and they could say Lord that's for me that's mine that's mine Lord I pray God that you'll grant to him Lord as they would hold that promise of the Holy Ghost granted to him Lord and their hearts Lord I pray Lord God needs Lord Jesus other needs throughout this building Lord you see father sometimes the Lord God not just sometimes Lord but the sky that we pack around he is the biggest enemy with God Lord Jesus how think phul we are we're aware there's a newness of life that is moved on the inside and I pray and I ask Lord and for each of these requests that's here but you'll grant Lord God what it is Lord that is the desire of their heart something Lord that maybe is troubling the Lord maybe it's wearing this Lord in their spirit their mind maybe the Lord they're weary in their body sickness Lord may be weary Lord in their mind Lord but I pray Heavenly Father this morning Lord by the Holy Ghost I pray Lord Jesus that you'll move for them right now Lord God made in Lord Jesus just take hold of that and Lord not looking at that situation maybe it's a feeling in their life maybe it's a lack of forgiveness Lord maybe it's bitterness lord malice one time they live there but they realize this is not where I'm to live I don't want to live here I don't want this to be a part of my life or God but they battle against it thoughts coming back sometimes feelings right but lord I pray right now Lord Jesus may they look and focus rat upon you Lord and let that flow that cleansing flow of the Holy Spirit that renewing of the Holy Ghost you takes more lore than us trying to change our mind change our thoughts I believe that Paul spoke to us Lord about how that were to order our thoughts but Lord we need the renewing of the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Spirit Lord God moving down Lord cleansing in our life Lord giving a strength Lord the Holy Spirit moving down Lord in homes and lives Lord in renewing Lord father missus this is who you are this is who you are the Lord God we have a right we have a right to say Lord you who regenerated and renewed me Lord God Lord God renew my life Lord renew my spirit Lord God or Jesus me real high so Lord that in many many times sometimes Lord it's just it may not be something right at this moment but we're laying underneath that stream of life with a faith to believe in that same renewing power of the Holy Ghost a cleansing Lord to whereby were washed with the washing of water by the word Oh Lord goddess you told Peter he that is washed he's every bit clean and whole need not wash only his feet the feet gets dirty it needs to be washed the Lord God wants our soul has been washed it's washed it's been washed with the waters of regeneration but we need a washing we need washing Lord that we might worship Lloyd granite Lloyd it's not a steel wall to water a broken cistern will never ever wash it away but we need that fresh washing of water by the word Lord Jesus no doubt throughout this building many different ones have looked at there's such a difference when we water with tap water versus the rain water what God tap water as they say it deals with some of the fluoride there's a lot of different chemicals and things within and it never gets to the depth it many times will rob the plants and take from them the nutrients that they need but that rainwater has a certain pH within it it has nitrogen within it that's already in the air and when it begins to come dance in that water it picks up that nitrogen and bringing it right down into the soil and that rain though it might be a light rain it's able to soak it so deep into the soil to where that the nutrients that are needed in that plant you can actually it'll thrive Lord Jesus we don't mean man-made tap water we don't need tap water that can be turned on and off we need Lord God that fresh rainwater Lord we need a fresh rain water Lord God that's not something Lord God that we can physically turn on and turn off but that rain water that comes from above Lord Jesus Oh God granite this morning Lord for our lives in our hearts Lord God rain on us Lord Jesus rain on the solut God washing us Lord i-35 washing every soul washing every spirit washing our minds for God granting Lord we pray father nor do we love you Oh God our desire Lord we want to please you know what father for
