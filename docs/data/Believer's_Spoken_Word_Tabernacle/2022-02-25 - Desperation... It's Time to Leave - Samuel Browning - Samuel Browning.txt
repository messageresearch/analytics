you amen god bless you this evening let's turn if we could in the scripture thank the musicians all this evening i want to go straight to daniel chapter nine and i just have to turn there with me i just have so many different parts ahead of me here and daniel chapter 9 and i want to read here just um a few verses let's begin at verse 1. we read from this here a few weeks back and to start out when we just were drawn to that that thought of the honest reflection and i want to just start here tonight in reading just to deal with the thought in verse 1 it says in the first year of darius the son of hezrus of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans in the first year of this reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem i want you to notice what what understanding did for daniel daniel's daniel's a prophet he is one who is set aside by god that the understanding what is to be alerted that that moment would come forth to the people of god you see it's one thing to read read the scriptures read the bible but it takes god to come on the scene to interpret it and the way god interprets it is by manifesting it and his presence remember part of that manifestation was god would begin to deal with the hearts of the people and cause the people's hearts to turn back to whole so in verse 3 look look how daniel approaches this and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and i prayed unto the lord my god and made confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments you may the lord bless you you're being seated i'd like to continue on here and i'd like to go to verse verse 16 in that same chapter it says oh lord here's daniel remember daniel as we said he began to he began to see the hour and begin to go ahead and make confession see when understanding of the word has come you put him in a place to really begin to confess not only that of his own sins but that of the nation and begin to confess because god was coming here and visiting going to come to visit israel in that time for deliverance now what i what i want you to to glean from this here in this scriptures we'll read in verse 16 here when we read from verse 16 in through i think i'm going to read through verse 20 at least i want you to notice how where daniel and what the objective is of his prayer when daniel here in verse 16 he says oh lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord's sake o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great mercies notice how when daniel is praying it has nothing to do with him or what they could present but when the word itself has come it immediately it leads to a place of repentance because when the word is unfolded even in the age that we are living in in that lady ocean age when the cry goes out be zealous therefore and repent and brother branham would speak to us in that age and he says it's not only there is very there are many that are true that have to repent there were many many of us and i'll say even more uh that when the word itself come to bring correction there are things that had to be repented of even of people that were walking in line and in step with all of the light that they saw in that hour but when the light comes to show up it also shows the areas that are are not in line with god's word and that requires repentance so you find one thing god is always moved by repentance and that and that it will move the heart of god even as it moved even though it moved the heart of god even when it came to ahab ahab would never ever change he would never become a true believer through and through but when he put on sackcloth and ashes god said i will not do it in his time but i'll bring it upon his household god respects repentance and we know that from the scripture so here with repentance precedes the opening unfolding daniel knows this is a time that god promised that he would visit and that understanding begins to come that this is the time of the fulfillment of that 70 years and to see even as he goes on to say in verse 19 oh lord hear oh lord forgive oh lord hearken and do do fear not defer not for thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name so if when you look at the whole of those verses daniel's face when he said i set my face here he is he's facing he is his person he's presenting his life it's it's so if we can say it in this manner daniel was a man that was upright before god you could not put a finger on his life the scripture was recorded and found no spot in thee his life because he lived a life that was pleasing to the lord yet daniel did not have the holy spirit as you and i would be blessed to be partakers of it by the new birth because we're living on this side of calvary on this side of the atonement but daniel was able to live a victorious life an overcoming life right in the midst of babylon and when this begins to unfold daniel it's it's as though things just turn it up a notch in daniel's life you know it's one thing it wasn't daniel was living softly but when daniel begin to understand these things this is time it's like daniel said i'm going to turn up my praise i'm gonna turn it up just a little bit i'm gonna zero in just a little bit more he's just gonna i'm tuning right in and notice how it tunes in he's focused on that this is not about us lord this is you coming to fulfill your word it's not our righteousness we have none it's your righteousness it's not our mercies it's your mercies so daniel had first things first he was really god was putting god first in everything and i'll say it in this moment that you and i are living in and i want to just speak here for a moment on desperation and an announcement it's time to leave that's right amen i want to just speak just a few moments desperation it's time to leave you see we've heard when we we look at all of this that it comes into a place that there's all sorts of things that will come even when a promise as it's coming to pass to try to distract to try to take away even in the days of the lord jesus there was all sorts of things that rose up before the coming of the messiah men who led them out into the wilderness and said they were this and said they were that just like when god sent the message in this hour all sorts of elijah's robes and everything else but all of that is to detract or try to take away from the original but it doesn't matter how many phony things the enemy sends he cannot deceive the elect it doesn't matter how many disappointments because i i can say this right now i no doubt i'm speaking to individuals that seen a lot of things i know i spoke even when i think of even you know from my dad my dad seen different things even back in the realm where he was at in the church seeing things that wasn't right others could see things that weren't wholesome and you know seeing this taking place and this taking place that was ungodly but you recognize that seed on the inside though it cannot explain things but when god's light flashes across your pathway let me tell you it's a communication between god and his children personally it's not something that has to be explained it's not even something that you even realize what's taking place but you recognize god is present there's something taking place here that's more real that's more precious and what happens in your life you start to tune in onto that voice and as you tune in on that voice you're tuning out other voices there's a lot of voices that are all around us but if there ever ever was a time that we need to turn it down and really turn down and really focus upon the things that that we see even things that we see taking place this this is an hour where we need to be very focused upon the things of god amen and i i just just just from my heart just looking at these times that we're living in you know we're not i'm not going to say we're living in the end time we're in the end of the end time that's where we're at now let me just say this no man knoweth the day nor the hour but the prophet could announce to us here in the feast of the trumpets he says we know we're living in the season of his coming because the signs that were that were ordained to be here in that time we see those signs around us we see as it was in the days of noah we see where people are taken up with eating drinking building and all those other things and and as brother ram place and flashing red lights is coming it's nothing wrong with those things as long as they're in the right perspective and the right order is that right but they became so occupied with those things that was where their worship was yes and and those people brother adam would say it like this they had faith but he says remember faith in the wrong thing is unbelief because they were taking things that here the noah was ministering under inspiration from god there was a message of judgment that was upon the earth but god in the midst of that judgment provided a message that could warn judgment is coming but to those that could hear that message they could hear the call of mercy they could hear the same grace that was revealed to noah and god had a man by the name of noah who found grace in the eyes of the lord and because that man was set aside grace could utter into the earth and call out the subjects that were ordained for the ark yes what grace in that hour amen that for many that could come around the ark all they heard was doomsday but not the elect the election heard mercy amen the electorate mercy amen the message that you and i are under in this hour let me just say it the bible that you and i hold in our hand was written for this hour amen the tanks the shadows all of us all of that was written for this hour everything that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride we see the types we see the day we see the time that we're living in the seals have been taken off of the book that's just not a saying that's a reality and when the seals are taken off that means it's time for understanding to be released what are you saying understanding understanding for preparation of departure amen we're living in a we're living in an awesome time we're living in a great time not for the world it's a scary time for the world let me just say it it's a scary time for anyone outside from under the blood of jesus christ i'm saying to you tonight it's a time to where if you're outside from the blood of jesus christ don't take for granted that you'll have the next moment or the next service you don't have that promise to you amen but it's right now at this moment and i would say don't even wait till the ministering is over get your heart right with god right now you see we're living in a time as a i think you know we've been just looking at things and i was just fellowshipping yesterday in the car with uh paul we were writing and i told him i said i'm ready to go preach right now i wasn't going to preach this but just so stirred with the things we begin to fellowship and he said daddy says if you notice he says there's things he said that even in the past he said year and past few years he said notice he said there's been changes he said in the messages coming forth there's been changes that's been taking place in the urgency that is upon us and among us you know why that is god's trying to get his elect ready to go god's objective isn't that we would become more comfortable in this world that we're living let's just face the facts our flesh loves things to be comfortable and easy right right and we had a choice to sit on a wooden chair or go send a lazy boy we'll go send a lazy boy i mean i may beat you there to it we we want the things of comfort but you recognize that in this time that we we are living in feathers are taken out of the nest the message that we have believed we have preached this time is upon us i realize i'm not i don't know the day nor the hour but i know in this reason i know this result right now is when god's presence moves upon a life you we live as though he can come in the next moment that it's a joy i thought of this here just yesterday and you know pardon me here just for just taking on my quote for a few moments i was just i was just just praying just yesterday evening and i was laying there and i began to just just just talking to the lord and looking at and just just meditating on different things and just praying and i said oh god just begin to just just strike my heart i said lord what joy because if you tarry i'm going to have joy because my joy is in you but lord if you come in the next moment well i know i have to wait to see him but i'm going to see my daddy oh i tell you i begin to pray that began to come it was such a sweet that came into the room at that time such a charge that came into the room you see it's like that woman she was on the ship and she knew at that moment she knew they said the ship looks like it's going down she began to worship and she began to praise and they say what are you doing she says i got a daughter in new york if this makes it there i'll see her but if this goes down right here i've already got a daughter in glory i'll see that one she was living in a state of joy amen oh glory the time is certainly upon us you know when i i want to just just draw your attention here when we look at even the preparations that was made for departure you see in this hour god wrote it i i don't have time to read all these scriptures but in the book of habitual it's wrote write the vision make it plain that him that readeth it might run hallelujah god wrote it but in this hour it's moved from writing to flesh amen amen the taking of the book is where the book becomes flesh men not just in a prophet's life but in the life of the bride of jesus christ amen where the life is the display of this bible the lamb's book of life a character identified within the word we're living in this hour we're not living in the hour of bible stories we're living in the hour where those stories we see that was a type of me rebecca spoke of me ruth spoke of me are you hearing me now you see the same one who stepped out on the road to the of emmaus is the same holy spirit that has come down and not only to identify himself in the word in this hour but to come and identify us within the word and he inside of us it's a time of preparation it's a time of preparation you see let me refer here to a scripture in first peter chapter four verse seven it says but the end of all things is at hand be there for sober and watch unto prayer over and over you find the parallel watch and pray be sober you'll find that throughout the scripture even jesus admonishing that the way that we watch is through prayer all right and prayer is the result of being in tune with the will of god that's why brother braham says if you want to know where the church is headed listen to how they're praying he said that's the sign of what the church is headed for because of what they're praying so when god begins to drop and move upon her heart for promises in this hour and you would say well i don't see that promise before me and it can be a very personal promise in your life but god begins to drop it upon your heart like he dealt with daniel right here and you begin to pray concerning that that shows the direction the church is headed in because we don't fly by sight jets don't fly by sight up there they fly by radar and radar detects oncoming things and moves accordingly to oncoming things so the end of all things is at hand we understand that in the hour the time that we're living in that in the opening of the seventh seal that's the coming of the lord and the coming of the lord brother branham brings it down to us and souls in prison now that brings him back down to earth what earth this earth this earth right here the coming of the lord a secret coming a bride coming it brings him down to earth brings him to his habitation brings him to his temple because in this hour it was promised the mystery of god should be finished is that right yes so within that coming there is also all of the folds of not only the preparation of the bride being made ready christ veiling himself in bright form but also within that coming is the going is the rapture of the church inside of that coming is also the tribulation coming upon the earth the sixth seal being opened inside of that coming this is why when the scripture says he cometh with clouds of glory and brother brown says that what that is it's waves his coming upon the earth it's just waves of his coming that's coming upon the earth waves and that waves these are not the waves these are waves of the holy spirit moving upon the church of the living god inspiring you and i in this hour and inside of that you see with that seal being opened in this hour the coming of the lord what does it do all of that within there making a bride ready and within that it unfolds to that here calling to the wedding supper of the lamb the tribulation all of the parts that are within that the millennium you know hear all the parts that before millennium armageddon all these parts are within that and that's why the scripture could say in the book of matthew it is the beginning of sorrows because this is an end this is what all of the prophets and those have looked for as a matter of fact it it is where the gentiles are to be taken off the scene in order that israel might receive her promised visitation and they're only waiting on us to get off the scene everything has been working in preparation for this moment i can say this this whole unfolding in our lives and our myth has been a vision of god hallelujah you know sometimes when we look at things and i i mean just say this is this is it comes to me we look at we look at the statement brother branham speaks in 1977 and he speaks under that of inspiration and it was under inspiration it was prophesied and it's to look at it clearly a terminating of world systems and what he was speaking to in that time i think of how many times we've heard this we see it even as brother george smith he's just one one of the many but i've heard it throughout my life what it came down to when brother branham was standing there he says the reason i said 1977 is because when he saw 1977 he could not see beyond it it was pitch black think about where we're at right now darkness is upon the earth gross darkness is upon the people amen are you with me we're not tampering with what a prophet said this is of what god has spoken through his prophet amen we're living in an hour right now that we see the fulfillment of the visions taking place and i know i'm just kind of moving and just jumping along and moving just to just to look at some points but to understand here we stand in this hour the visions brother branham had seven visions that god gave him is that right amen let me tell you something we're living the sixth is in fulfillment i know you know sometimes people get so caught up with this and that and what and more and they fail to recognize and go back and really uncover certain things oh brother samuel you know women aren't naked yet really really where you been if you're talking about exposure of skin you've missed it there's nothing more uh of nudity than yoga pants i'm gonna preach it amen all right that's true brother would say it like this the understanding of the prophetic eye he said satan knows just how much to take off and how much to leave on to cause the mind to wonder he said he knows he can't completely strip it all right is that right but you're seeing this out think about when they would say to brother branham oh brother you know i don't wear shorts i wear slack brother brandon said that's worse yet because it's an abomination it shows the very the very figure you see oh my i don't want to go this route but you see god has even hold that of the woman because the woman is a type of the church and if the woman is there in an abomination she's under the wrath and the judgment of god but god intended that the woman would be veiled in the clothing of the word she would be under the blood of jesus christ and to find her and see her you have to look and see christ first because christ is her all in all christ is her adornment he is that right you see i i don't you know to me i hate debating i don't like debating because debating ain't nothing about there ain't nothing about the word that's debating is that right either believe it or not i don't care how you can debate it you'll never turn nobody people are not turned by debates amen is that right this is why over and over if they're ordained to see it they'll see it if they're not ordained to see it i don't care if they know it by memory they'll never see it yes amen brother braham said here here we are even when he speaks in daniel 70 weeks and he rehearses that sixth vision my goodness we see the things already it's been out with the cars for years not just recently just speaking with a pastor that had called me and he said you know he says speaking of some things he said man i got copies of stuff and all this was coming out back there with these cars and all this back there you know way back i mean when it was all put out national geographic and all this stuff it's been out all right are you hearing me say brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying you need to be tuned in to the right voice yes that's what i'm saying beloved try every spirit amen amen come on somebody amen you see when brother branham would say that in the sixth vision we understand it's speaking not only the catholic church but then we've seen kamala harris standing right there dressed right there in purple is that right the detractors around wanted to say blue oh how god had put the designer raffle in put it on there and ralph lauren identifies it's purple seeing the woman wearing the purple dress it's twofold now that's not the bad that i mean you either believe it or you don't but you see where that's at in this hour those six visions fulfilled the seventh vision is the united states laying in craters and ashes but before that one comes to pass the pride will be gone and taken out of here amen she has given rapturing grace amen this is a rapturing message that raptures you and your soul right now raptures you from the things of this earth from an old sinful nature from sinful habits it's a rapturing message brother that catches you up into heavenly places and ties you back in to your inheritance what an awesome hour we're living in [Music] now brother brian referred to this when he was praying and i'm going to read it because right now what we see going on even within russia and i could say this right now there's a lot of different events here or there that we could see and some things some things as it's laid out we didn't even with the things that was taken place within this past two years right right now i realized when we stood here on that opening night and i i told you when we had that perming i said this isn't a it isn't a persecution we're just gonna we're trying to go along and just to go along with things just to be good neighbors i felt led of the lord to do that but you see where you and i had privileges that we could come back together right there were other states even within our united states where there was the governors and everything else that said don't go to church and if you do don't sing because if you sing you might get saliva drops on everybody else now i'm going to tell you something there was men who stood in those states they don't even know the light of this hour are you hearing me they weren't being obstinate daniel wasn't being obstinate when he stood in an unaltered way but they began to recognize wait a minute here this is an attack now amen i tell you friend this is an hour to have discernment in these things amen amen so suddenly the bible said it will come upon the earth as a snare yes true it's a time to have exercise in discernment in this hour as we even see things that goes on in my i mean you look at the hour that here we're living in i mean just a couple years ago you could think in your mind my goodness the way the economy and the stuff is going it's totally opposite right right it was totally opposite right but look how just in one little bit the crippling of economies came you're saying who who watched over that god watched over that right none of this could have happened or been released if god didn't permit it god permitted it god's not the cause of it he permits it daniel and daniel 9 said lord thou hast watched over these things yes but in the midst of it as it's getting god moving down i think of it look in this hour i tell you in this and even in these past two years i tell you what god has become more precious more real until you see more of the supernatural the pillar of fire coming down seeing more of those things in the very first service that we were here you've seen it i got called afterwards the very first streaming service that we had here and it asked me did you see that in the building glory it's very real the living god moving among us and in testimonies of his presence god reaching lives and lives not only walking into the waters of baptism but really consecrating their lives unto almighty god i'm telling you thanks be to god in this hour for his marvelous grace hey man it's time to leave see with russia and everything that we see taking place let me just let me read the quote brother branham i have the message the angel of the lord 1951 1951 you do the math on that at 71 years ago he said you remember church you're living in the best that you ever live in right now until jesus comes right you know it'll gradually no no he said not gradually it'll rapidly get worse and worse yes when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's what this whole thing is about in ukraine it's oil you also realize even years ago remember when israel or now israel russia positioned themselves on the black sea in crimea they can't be cut off just as much as rome had her revival brother branham announces it an end time seed sign rome having her revival to reclaim her original borders see if there's battles there's there's that the tensions that's taking place and that's going on in this hour these are all signs of things that we see around us but in the midst of all these times there's the greatest sign that is among us and the greatest sign that's among us is the lord jesus christ and him uniting in the hearts and lives of his people in a way of readiness [Music] when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then let me just come back and come back to me because i i've come to this point and i've got moved this way and i'm on this trail it's just like let me tell you something just like when things like this have come along if it's only something that kind of just prompts for a little bit it'll fade that's right it's just like when 9 11 happened it prompted for a little bit faded you know why because it's not national forces that bring us into the promise but you can look at events taking place and realize i'm not where i should be or i need to really get dialed in a little bit more and with that oh my to recognize what joy that is present in this house we already have joy but what joy that is present because in the next moment hallelujah we can see our loved ones hallelujah i thought oh god i see brother and sister car probably i just walking around here today i said oh god i'm going to see brother louie hallelujah what are you doing i'm saying i'm looking amen i'm looking you see even after things could take place you can have things where you know people say oh you're trying to put a prediction it's not a prediction we're living in the time of departure amen it's time to leave for the rapture itself is promised it will come as a thief in the night right it's not an announcement when a thief comes to your house except you're in nigeria if a thief comes to your house he doesn't announce itself right you know what i'm talking about right they don't announce themselves they show up that's right unannounced there's no preparation but if you know hey there's something coming and there's a prep there's something coming you make preparation and you're waiting you're vigilant you're watching you're looking for it and that's how when we're looking for the coming of the lord there's all sorts of things to try to take our focus this way focus this way focus that way but this is where like daniel we must set our face yes amen to seek the lord our person our lives just like a man that would walk into the congregation into the tabernacle in the wilderness into the three courts when he came through the gate he was facing the right way to go on into the holiest of holies see the door jesus christ is the door it's him that reveals the right direction the path of life amen that we're facing in the right way well he says there he says that that the prophet said it would do it and we're ready for it then now notice he's just announced russia going down there to get that oil and look what it comes and says so church get ready to meet christ yes he's sending great revivals and meetings to me this quote it speaks more of this hour let me tell you something in these past two years there has been more meetings i know not every time you're learning really yeah there's been more meetings more meetings this past year meetings that weren't just small meetings i look at here went on memorial day meetings those that came it's not about numbers but hearts that came and that was a small representation to just weeks before in virginia was like 800 a thousand somewhere around in there came and we're talking all the way through why is it there's a gathering going on amen it's a gathering that's taking place of god's people i'm not saying that you had to travel those other meetings i'm just trying to tell you that there's hearts in life that if anything that covet did covet if there's anything it caused people to say you know what i've taken church for granted i'm taking serving god for granted i need to get my priorities right and my life lined up with god because they realize walking a halfway life when things come like that it'll rivet fear through that life is that right incredible i've often pondered and wondered because you know i shared this with some of your brothers everyone they always talk about covet and natural comorbidities i wonder what effect when things come about upon spiritual comorbidities are you hearing me church tests trial persecution things come around you see if there's any weakness it'll show itself are you hearing me now amen oh it sounds like brother samuel that sounds pretty strong friends were interested in getting out of here we're interested in getting out of here we're interested in walking the right pathway sometimes these things might seem awful strong but on that day when we stand there on that moment we will be faithful for every word of admonition we'll be thankful for the holy spirit coming down and saying get back instead get back in line we will be faithful in that hour and say thank you lord for my less wanted to resist it and argue against it and put a position against it but my soul said amen amen praise the lord so church getting ready to meet christ he's sending great revivals and meetings and stirring the full gospel people not only do the message of the hour do it then the message of the hour is doing it right now signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together and one day he shall come the deliverer brother brown of the very next statement he says just before god began to take the people out of the promised land to the promised land they started to cry out bitterly in anguish yes they're taskmasters god had to bring it to a place to their prayers changed amen are you hearing me daniel's prayers changed daniel's prayers became focused upon that understanding that god was revealed now don't misunderstand me it wasn't that daniel couldn't pray for healing but daniel realized this is the preeminent thought of the hour amen deliverance are you hearing me amen see many out there even in religious they're praying and they're praying for this and praying for that and you know what prayers get answered but to be in tune with the mind of christ for the will of god in this hour and then to pray for that that requires a special designation that's sovereign grace that's given to you and i that we might know the things that we should be praying about amen they begin to cry taskmasters was heavy everything i want you to think of this here just just a few just a few a few more moments here in the scriptures this preparation for departure in exodus chapter 12 remember in order for israel to walk out of egypt god sent him a prophet is that right now they recognized that moses was a prophet but that message also came accompanied with the pillar of fire that was grace the pillar of fire was to vindicate this is my servant amen is that right yes and under that under that message it was expressed in that hour i'm coming to bring deliverance and i'm coming to set my son free that he might serve me now israel was his son collectively as a whole let me just say this to you your god son you're god's daughter and you and i had to be led out of egyptian bondage had to be let out of our first birth we could not think our way out of it we couldn't memorize our way out of it couldn't talk our way out of it there had to be a lamb that was provided and the lamb the way out the way a pathway of deliverance which was god's pathway and program prayer from the mind of god and has been a type all the way through was identified through the message of the hour go take a lamb slay that lamb and take the blood and put it upon the doorpost and that shall be a token between me and you that when i see the blood you mean you won't see me no i'm looking for the blood that's what i'm looking for so the blood had to be applied before they could ever leave egypt and when we applied the blood they didn't have a time that you know what you're going to be exiled out of here at midnight you're going to be thrown out of here in the wee hours of the morning they didn't have that but they knew that this was the final moment this was the final message this was the final time notice how god had them to do it see also they were to eat that lamb and while they ate it they had to have their shoes on their feet they had to have their loins gird about meaning the long palestinian robes it had to be brought up and tucked in that belt why so their movement was not impeded or slowed down or hindered it was tucked up right they had to eat it in that way not like how you and i eat at our house you know with our slippers on and sometimes with you know a sweatshirt on or something we don't know what we look like no they were to eat it ready to go and while they were eating it they were eating it waiting for marching orders waiting for that let me say something god has been sending marching orders yes over and over are you hearing me the same holy spirit that comes that speaks to your heart even tonight it's sending marching orders to your life hey it's time to move on that's right you've been around church it's time to move it's time to move on it's time to move on deeper it's time to move into a deeper walk it's time to get beneath the blood it's time to get serious it's time not to be casual it's time to leave amen this is how you're to eat it many other places in the scripture that we could go to with this part of desperation let me just say it in this way it's the desperation is to be in such a place like it was with peter when peter was bitten to come out of the ship and begin to walk on the water he got his eyes on the waves and he started sinking but in desperation he screamed out save me lord lest i perish this was not something that was casual it was in desperation it's like the woman with had the issue of blood she spent all her living what caused her to spend all her living desperation she was desperate to see that resolved in her life but she made it to the lord jesus and you talk about desperation she pressed through even when the disciples tried to discourage her not you even jesus himself brother brown was standing there in a message perseverance he said jesus himself tried to discourage her but he said what it is she says her faith could not know any discouragement all right because she knew that's what i have need of he's the one i have need of let me tell you something the devil will try to put every sort of discouragement and if you listen to me now if you look at the word through natural eyes you'll never see yourself in the word but if you're like the holy spirit the outside of god to come and anoint your eyes brother it will give you courage and strength to press beyond every discouragement every shortcoming everything that even thoughts come in about yourself there is a power to anoint you to see beyond the veil amen praise the lord like the woman whose daughter was grievously vet sheath in desperation got to him jairus his daughter she was only laying sick at the time right but you see the situation forced him he was a secret believer but the situation forced him to step out right step out i say it like this as paul would write we need to give the more earnest heed to the things that we've heard i say it's a time it's a moment it's an hour there's more we could say but it's a time it's an hour to really be dialed in on the things of god i know we can all you know we can all agree with that but it really has to come down of really putting our lives before that really seeing what's going on these things out here as we see it taking place it's already spoken was already prophesied but the focus that we have is the preparation that god has sent to you and i to be made ready in this hour let me just say it as clear as i know you're not going in a rapture because you know god sent a prophet you're not going in a rapture because you believe this message you're going in a rapture because there is an atonement a token life the baptism of the holy ghost upon your soul you're not going in a rapture because you're affiliated around the message or you have books or you have tapes we're not going in a message for that you're not going in a message because well i see visions and i see this and i see that no we're going in the rapture because there is the token of the holy ghost upon our life when i see the blood not when i see a healing not when i see a vision now when i we believe in all those things but we don't put our stock in those things as evidence of life [Applause] when i see the blood that's why rahab said judgment is upon us i don't just want a token i want a true one i want a true assurance i want a true token because judgment is striking the land the time to get serious a time to clean out all the trash yes oh my desperation you see desperation what real desperation is recognizing our need in this hour and the love of god when the love of god the baptism of the holy ghost has come into that life you live a desperate life are you hearing me we don't we aren't desperate for the holy ghost and then we become oh praise god phew i made it they bring me some tea while i'm waiting on it no no no no no no no how many of you ever been probably people been on trains buses and airplanes right now for me a lot of times with you know i just fly one carrier that way i get my stuff gets built up and things like that so a lot of times when i fly with a certain carrier i always have to either go to atlanta or detroit don't matter i could be going to connecticut and they'd fly me to atlanta and then up to detroit over to but i've learned within that time that's a coffee break time the time that i'll start looking where's the nearest coffee place when i like where's it at what terminal is it in now you know there's sometimes when you book your flights they give you just a small window of 50 minutes between flights sometimes it might be a three hour window that kind of gives you a little bit of three hours man that's i got time to traverse and get around other places but remember you've got a connecting flight to catch and sometimes you know you can see people running around the airport and sometimes it isn't because they just got off a flight is because they were at too long at a restaurant too long at this and they're trying now to get to their gate this is why brother branham stands in flashing red lights of his coming and he speaks in terms of a train he said here a train has come in you get off he said just for like one of those little whistle stops you get off and you grab a bag of peanuts oh man i'm gonna get some peanuts he said and yet here you are engulfed with those peanuts and you miss the train that's to take you to your destination and this is why he said if you were living in the time throw down the bag of peanuts throw it down it's a time to be dialed in and to be focused yes is that right i wish i had more time to to go and to speak more on that part of it because let me just let me just let me just wrap it up in this in this place here is that when we're looking at the times that we're in it's a time that brother banham said it like this and i've said this too when i've talked over the years here with our boys and spoke to others but with the boys because i know they also there's things that they're in their college and things they're going through and i said it in this way i said look there's things that we see coming on around us and even talking today of it but i said it's not for us to stand by and do nothing first of all it's to be occupied with the things of god very last scripture in first corinthians 15 said of this of the chapter that speaks of the change of the body it says abound in the work of the lord to me what balance that this message has brought to us in this hour brother brown could make the statement very clear you know the quote about planting potatoes now he didn't say become the local potato expert become dr potato head or dr potato don't don't become that just plant them right right if you're not there to eat them somebody else will but this is what he said he said if i knew he was coming tomorrow morning i'd study to preach the message tomorrow and he said i'd be standing right here at the pulpit he said because when he comes this is his words i want to be found standing at the post of duty so i can be saying lord i stood faithful where you have placed me what you call me to do i'm standing faithful waiting on your coming so when it comes to everything else schooling training other things taking place even in our lives remember we don't become focused or let that become the priority but within all of that we stand in our post of duty and we must plant potatoes yes is that right well i thank god for the hour that we're living in but i say this friends i say this even to all those are on the internet those that are not here tonight those that it's a it's a time if you notice how the transition how the holy spirit has been taking it i've watched it i've watched those things and it's a time i can say it very clearly outside of the token you're under the wrath of god outside of the baptism of the holy ghost wrath wrath is what awaits you branham makes a statement when he says they'll stand there on that day in the time after the rapture and those that are here and he says they will cry for the rocks of the mountains to fall on them to hide them from the wrath of the lamb and brother branham brings and identifies that group that calls for that he said that's those that said in these services and failed to move upon the word of god i'm thankful for god's mercy amen i'm thankful now when he not only opened my eyes but dealt with my heart brought correction to my life and i'm thankful for his grace to where grace was given that my heart could be yielded to him and he could come and do the work that he himself intended and desired to do in my life that would bring a peace that would bring a joy let me say this to you that's god's desire to all that's here to all that'll stream this message to all that's out on the internet don't take anything no substitution amen for the real life of jesus christ amen i've been around her for 40 years don't take no substitution amen know that you know that you know that you know amen don't rest on anything rest only in him amen amen when you can look in your life and say i know i'm not who i used to be i know the desires of my life they're no longer there he changed my life he's opened his word to me i see him in plain view he's the love of my life he's my everything amen hallelujah and desperation will lay everything aside for him in desperation when decisions come if it is going to alter the order of god in my life no thank you the rapture is more important let's bow our heads heavenly father o god tonight lord lord jesus you know i've stood here lord to watch even that lord a timer said even in front of me and just lord of my heart just lord looking upon these things and just with just so many things lord just as it's inspired to my heart it's time to leave it's a time to lay aside everything it's a time to lay aside complexes it's a time to lay aside sin it's a time to lay down [Music] it's a time to lay aside every weight waste that you're carrying that's holding you down unforgiveness lay it aside [Music] bitterness lay it aside malice laid aside it's not worth missing the rapture for [Music] and lay aside every besetting sin don't focus on the weight don't focus on the besetting sin god meets you right there in the altar of your heart but the authority of the word said lay it aside he's given the authority to lay it down and while laying that down why don't you lay down your life why don't you lay it down fully lay it all down at his feet [Music] say lord god i want the token in my life i want the holy ghost in my life i want that assurance lord that's in my life i want that joy that was spoken tonight i want that preparation that it's time to leave there's a real anchor in my life oh god lord we see little we see things lord that's come upon this earth things believe in lord that even in this the past couple of years a minor thing to what's coming lord during that time of the tribulation oh my no wonder your prophet could say cut me open fill me full of sulfur and sow me back up but god don't let me go through that tribulation lord i pray god here this this evening lord i stand as one god as an intercessor to pray god with the word upon my heart oh god lord join together with others lord in that moment of intercession oh god the lord you will move lord throughout this assembly of god lord moving upon lies moving upon hearts oh god to stir lies and stir hearts lord hearts lord god that lord had just just been church it's just been like a playground just playing around just showing up whenever coming whenever it's convenient just doing what lord but god i pray tonight lord god lord we're

among us lord may it be a moment right now where hearts and lives really becoming dialed in on the things of god [Music] lord you've been talking to us in services here on sunday even when we were ending here the past couple sundays on traps traps are not something that's visible or known but father how that the enemy will use traps to catch us to ensnare us and they're sent all around he'll use family to use family life he'll use things that would seem innocent to ensnare us god i pray tonight lord may there be a real a real evaluation take place in every heart in life may there be such

lives i'm glad he speaks to us bloody ministers to you and i we're not in a time of darkness we're not in a time of wondering and listen you know me those of you you've been here under my ministry right here the pastor you know i'm not one i don't go out on limbs i don't go out on things you know me i don't go out on things and try to take puzzle pieces and fit it together i don't do that if god asks me and directs me to go some way i'll go there many things i can look at it and study but it's the things i want god knows it's that we be ready that we're ready to go i thank god for all the mysteries i go through go through those they're dropped but you know all along if you don't have the holy ghost the mysteries will do you no good but if you've had the holy ghost then you have the mystery of god that'll unfold every other mystery and it brings discernment in your life to where they're not just mysteries out here but it's discernment it brings discernment because the word is the spirit of truth it's discernment see even that understanding of the white horse rider for the shane it can even it'll give you discernment for even things that would try to encroach on your job and you're able to stand there under his leaning and what seems to be innocent the holy spirit uncovers it something you might be standing back and say i don't know about this right here but you're able to say eventually it comes out it's the grace of god this this word that we're under is not a letter it's the person of jesus christ it's the true witness of god it's a spirit of truth it brings discernment brother richie in our lives i pray i tell you i ask every one of you every one of you everyone goes on the internet let's really be in prayer even more i'm praying god in the services as we're coming to him god pour out of your spirit more and more god get brother samuel and the minister whatever veil you have standing here get him out of the way and speak lord and bring real personal healing to hearts and lives lord we see him already doing it but that what he's doing it just calls us to pray for more because we know it's god's desire right here it's time to leave [Music] singing
