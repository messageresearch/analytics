[17:43] at God's grace and then and then we'll
[17:44] take the prayer quest for the Lord God
[17:46] still answers prayer amen
[18:00] just a quick testimony I don't want to
[18:03] take too much time from the word last
[18:05] night my mother called me and she said
[18:08] that uh my brother gave his heart to the
[18:12] Lord so mean so for those who does not
[18:23] know the story and I just quickly in a
[18:25] nutshell I was we were I was seven when
[18:29] my father passed away my brother was ten
[18:31] and since then my brother took it really
[18:35] really hard and he never really
[18:37] recovered from it he from moving to
[18:40] having everything we moved to having
[18:42] nothing and that just was hard and my
[18:46] brother so he he went out on the streets
[18:48] on a very early age and he was out there
[18:51] hustling believing that that's the way
[18:53] he had to do things in order to help my
[18:55] mom and but then by doing so he got
[18:58] involved with a lot of bad friends and
[19:00] people and he started abusing alcohol
[19:02] and drugs at a very early age when my
[19:05] brother and I kind of took two separate
[19:07] ways I went to the far extreme of trying
[19:10] to seek the Lord's face and he went the
[19:12] other way and I think the foundation
[19:14] started when I was in a convent and so I
[19:18] then took the approach of I we need the
[19:21] Lord we need the Lord and my brothers
[19:23] like no we need to get out there in the
[19:24] world and do something about our
[19:26] situation so he it was really bad it got
[19:29] really really bad I'm I'm talking about
[19:33] you know you have people that's out
[19:35] there in the world and they abuse
[19:37] alcohol
[19:37] and drugs and they kind of just stick to
[19:39] themselves my brother was the aggressive
[19:41] kind he would come home and he'll you
[19:44] know break down doors and windows and
[19:46] you know threatened to you know set us
[19:48] on fire and you know do stuff to us and
[19:51] you'll just want to beat us all in the
[19:53] house and and I was the one that always
[19:55] used to stand in between him and my mom
[19:57] and take the punches for her so it was
[20:01] hard but it you know so you know I'm
[20:06] talking about a guy that um it got so
[20:09] bad that he he would literally hurt
[20:14] everyone out there I mean I witnessed a
[20:16] time that um I was out with him and they
[20:20] had he attacked they attacked him and
[20:22] his reigns attacked a guy I don't know
[20:24] where he was coming from they attacked
[20:26] him and you know took his shoes and his
[20:29] wallet and there was just something fun
[20:31] you know witness I give it to mama
[20:42] I'm talking about a guy um he got in so
[20:49] many fights and he just wanted to attack
[20:52] everybody he was the strongest man he he
[20:54] was under the influence and I mean you
[20:57] when you're out there and you hurt so
[20:59] many people you make enemies so instead
[21:01] of my brother being the one coming home
[21:03] and fighting us you know we had to be
[21:06] afraid of people out there enemies that
[21:10] wanted to hurt us you know and my
[21:12] brother would take advantage of their
[21:14] sisters and guys we've been trying to
[21:18] hurt his sisters you know me and my two
[21:21] other siblings and we would be so afraid
[21:25] if my brother comes home we would just
[21:26] lock the doors and just stay in there or
[21:29] will flee to friends neighbors and so
[21:31] forth I'm talking about a guy that tried
[21:35] to commit suicide on so many different
[21:36] occasions talking about several
[21:41] overdoses he would drink and use drugs
[21:44] together being beat up so many times I
[21:48] remember one time he was close to death
[21:51] could blow with a baseball bat to his
[21:53] head crack crack the skull and blood on
[21:55] his brain
[21:55] we thought we'd lose him you know it's
[21:58] it's it's bad when you get to a point as
[22:02] a Christian I was at the time
[22:03] Pentecostal it's bad when you get to a
[22:06] point where you ask God to rather take
[22:08] his life it's better to cry once at a
[22:11] funeral and for the rest I had to repent
[22:23] that many times God to forgive me for it
[22:26] and just seem that there was no hope to
[22:31] this day 22 years we've been praying 22
[22:36] years God still answers prayer
[22:40] [Applause]
[22:45] my brother city he sat there and the
[22:49] minister was preaching on enough is
[22:51] enough
[22:52] my brother said he doesn't know what
[22:55] happens to him he just felt someone pick
[22:56] him up and drag him take you to the
[22:58] altar and he raised his hands and he
[23:00] said Lord enough is enough and he said
[23:03] forgive me for everything that I've ever
[23:05] done I know that because I was in the
[23:09] same position I was in the pew when and
[23:12] I felt that same hand lift me up and
[23:14] took me to the altar I believe every
[23:16] word she says so I just want to
[23:18] encourage each and every one I know

[39:43] amen we have so much truly to be
[39:46] thankful for
[39:47] amen it's so wonderful we we think of
[39:50] this what this day it means and truly
[39:53] it's it's more than just a memorial it's
[39:58] a reality and to think of it that there
[40:01] are many many many great men who had
[40:03] lived many great men many great promises
[40:07] that were made and many wonderful things
[40:09] that our Lord and Savior did in his
[40:13] earthly time here upon this earth and
[40:16] the body of flesh but that Easter
[40:19] morning is what's sealed at all
[40:23] that's what proved everything right
[40:27] there everything was proven at that
[40:31] moment because to think about it was all
[40:33] of all of the sick that were healed and
[40:35] how many how many needs that were met
[40:37] but if he had not rose again we would
[40:41] still be in our sins but he rose he rose
[40:49] and because he rose then we can raise
[40:54] also and that wonderful so thankful to
[40:58] God for His mercies just want to greet
[41:00] each and every one of you and they're so
[41:03] good to see you this morning and we want
[41:05] to just look right into the word of the
[41:07] Lord and welcome our visitors here with
[41:10] us in John chapter 11 we're gonna read
[41:13] just a few verses of Scripture
[41:19] it's good to have brother Jean back here
[41:21] with us amen good to have each and every
[41:27] one of you some of you that were away on
[41:28] your vacations or other things I trusted
[41:31] you I rested and ready to go for the
[41:38] days ahead
[41:40] nobody said amen to that I don't know
[41:44] any time that I ever go and have been
[41:46] over the time on vacation I always get I
[41:49] always get a little bit cuz I know it's
[41:51] luck when I go on vacation I don't rest
[41:53] it seems like I actually come back more
[41:55] tired than when I that's why this is
[41:58] kind of like the the routine of things
[42:01] but God knows what we have need of
[42:03] because we all need rest
[42:04] we do need rest that's very very very
[42:07] scriptural and you know and sometimes we
[42:10] get to looking at things and we feel
[42:12] like that my we have to do this and have
[42:14] to do that and have to do this brother
[42:16] Branham was asked a question you know
[42:18] you you're familiar with a many
[42:20] statements rather better made and truly
[42:22] he he labored for the kingdom of God and
[42:25] then brother Branham was asked a
[42:27] question as he was going fishing and one
[42:29] of the individuals asked him so brother
[42:31] Branham with all these all the time
[42:33] being so short and you know with so many
[42:36] lives to be to be redeemed how can you
[42:40] go fishing and brother Branham said I
[42:42] like this now this is a latter part of
[42:43] the ministry he says he says I come to
[42:46] this place he said God knows everyone
[42:48] that's his he said every name that's on
[42:51] the Lamb's Book of Life is gonna be
[42:53] there and he said he must rest in that
[42:56] wonderful you know and that's where he
[42:58] says it God God is going to accomplish
[43:00] every every bit of the of what needs to
[43:03] be done and sometimes we do have to rest
[43:05] in order to get if I can say it
[43:07] recalibrate it a little bit and when you
[43:10] get recalibrated then God can actually
[43:12] use you for what he has intended to use
[43:15] you for so we we certainly need that so
[43:18] I'm not advocating that you all go on
[43:20] vacation I'm glad to have you here this
[43:23] morning and I'm glad to be here with you
[43:25] and gathered on this on this great
[43:28] Easter morning
[43:29] so let's look here in the word in John
[43:32] 11 verse 17 just a few verses of
[43:34] Scripture and then we'll let you have
[43:35] your seats then when Jesus came he found
[43:42] that he had laid in the grave four days
[43:45] already now Bethany was nine to
[43:48] Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many
[43:51] of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to
[43:54] comfort them concerning their brother
[43:56] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[43:59] Jesus was coming went and met him but
[44:02] Mary sat still in the house then said
[44:05] Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou hadst
[44:08] been here my brother had not died but I
[44:13] know that even now whatsoever thou wilt
[44:17] ask of God God will give it me jesus
[44:23] said unto her thy brother shall rise
[44:26] again now watch her response Martha said
[44:32] unto him I know that he shall rise again
[44:34] in the resurrection at the last day so
[44:38] she she believed in the resurrection she
[44:41] believed in the resurrection and so she
[44:44] believes in the resurrection but now her
[44:46] understanding now is to be opened in
[44:49] that not just believing in the
[44:52] resurrection but he who indeed is the
[44:55] very resurrection so verse 25 jesus said
[44:58] unto her I am the resurrection and the
[45:02] life he that believeth in me though he
[45:06] were dead yet shall he live and
[45:09] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[45:11] shall never die believe us now this and
[45:15] she said unto him yeh Lord I believe
[45:17] that thou art the Christ the Son of God
[45:20] which had come into the world let's just
[45:23] pause there Heavenly Father Lord as we
[45:28] are just so so thankful this morning
[45:32] Lord for for the resurrection Lord and
[45:35] it's Lord something that Lord Sutch of
[45:39] the greatest event Lord that's
[45:42] ever taken place upon this earth and to
[45:45] think of it Lord that because you raised
[45:49] you were delivered for our offenses and
[45:51] you were raised for our justification
[45:54] Lord God we're so thankful for that Lord
[45:57] and we're thankful that Lord that you
[45:59] Lord as the life Giver Lord you have
[46:03] come down through every age you have
[46:06] sought out each and every one of your
[46:07] children Lord and father you're still
[46:10] calling Lord God to each and every life
[46:14] and every heart father and Lord we just
[46:16] pray this morning that Lord Jesus as we
[46:19] look upon these things and we reflect
[46:22] upon the goodness of God we ask the Lord
[46:25] that you would pass by our way and move
[46:27] upon our hearts Lord afresh Lord may
[46:30] there just be an outpouring of your
[46:32] presence Lord are refreshing from the
[46:35] presence of the Lord and father to where
[46:37] that by your spirit Lord you'll move
[46:39] upon hearts and lives Lord that perhaps
[46:42] gathered here this morning that don't
[46:44] know you Lord or know you in that real
[46:46] intimate way Lord God I pray that your
[46:49] Lord just move in such a measure this
[46:52] morning Lord father - whoa Lord God
[46:54] every heart Lord and may every one of us
[46:57] Lord truly be able Lord at the end of
[46:59] the service Lord to find ourselves Lord
[47:02] deeper in love with you Lord than when
[47:05] we entered this place this morning
[47:06] father we give ourselves to you a
[47:08] speaker in here and ask that you would
[47:10] just have your way among us Lord say
[47:12] what needs to be said Lord and will you
[47:14] just come and quicken the word to our
[47:16] hearts we pray in the name of Jesus
[47:18] Christ amen
[47:19] and may God bless your being seated if
[47:23] we could keep on reading here just for a
[47:26] few moments and we find in verse 38 here
[47:32] now there come to the sight of where
[47:36] Lazarus is laid and the Bible said Jesus
[47:39] therefore again groaning in himself he
[47:41] he come to the grave and it was a cave
[47:44] and a stone lay upon it
[47:45] and Jesus said take you away the stone
[47:49] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[47:51] said unto Him Lord by this time he
[47:54] stinketh for he had been dead
[47:56] four days jesus said unto her said I not
[48:01] unto thee that if thou wouldest believe
[48:04] thou should have see the glory of God
[48:06] then they took away the stone from the
[48:09] place where the dead was laid and Jesus
[48:12] lifted up his eyes and said father I
[48:14] think that thou has heard me
[48:17] I knew that thou hearest me always but
[48:19] because of the people which stand by us
[48:22] edit that they may believe that thou has
[48:24] sent me and when he had thus spoken he
[48:28] cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[48:30] forth and he that was dead came forth
[48:33] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[48:36] and his face was bound about him with a
[48:39] napkin and Jesus said unto them loose
[48:42] him and let him go
[48:45] when I think of this here of how that we
[48:51] look in the scriptures here and that
[48:54] versa scripture had just been so
[48:56] resonating on my heart here for a few
[48:59] weeks I am the resurrection and the life
[49:03] it's more than just a wonderful
[49:06] statement but here we find that within
[49:10] the midst of it you know this this
[49:12] setting it's a setting to where that the
[49:15] Lord Jesus himself is receives word that
[49:20] Lazarus has passed on he receives that
[49:22] word and yet he delays to come until
[49:26] after four days but yet what we we
[49:30] recognize within this as within every
[49:32] part of God's program there are no
[49:35] coincidences with God there's no nothing
[49:39] there's just all this just no this is
[49:41] what a happenstance there's not it may
[49:44] it may many things sometimes it startles
[49:46] us but the reality is is that God has
[49:49] everything divinely arranged and planned
[49:52] out and when we look at this here the
[49:56] Lord Jesus is speaking to the disciples
[49:59] and he has made known to them that
[50:00] Lazarus is sleeping but yet they look at
[50:03] him and say he's doing well if he's just
[50:06] sleeping you know but what it is they're
[50:09] not they're not
[50:10] catching the understanding of what's
[50:12] being said so he said now for your sakes
[50:15] to bring it down to where you understand
[50:18] he is dead but I'm going to wake him so
[50:22] he's letting them know so now
[50:24] everything's opened up that truly
[50:27] Lazarus has died but the Lord Jesus is
[50:30] going to wake him and I want you to
[50:32] think of this that time itself where
[50:35] Martha said if you had been here this
[50:38] wouldn't have happened and I think that
[50:40] for all of us there are a lot of things
[50:42] if we can bring this parallel of this
[50:44] story right down into our own lives that
[50:46] there's a lot of things that we could
[50:48] say Lord if you had been here this
[50:51] wouldn't have went this way Lord if you
[50:53] had been here this wouldn't have went
[50:54] this way Lord have you there's a lot of
[50:57] things that we could say with that but
[50:58] then let's come to the other part of it
[51:00] that he himself though he were not there
[51:04] per se and and to interrupt or to stop
[51:07] but yet he is still the same Living God
[51:10] who can bring forth even that which
[51:13] seems to have been removed God is able
[51:17] to restore he's a restorer he restores
[51:20] those those things even in a heart and a
[51:23] life that are attributes of himself that
[51:25] reflect the great attributes of his life
[51:27] a father a mother a husband a wife all
[51:30] of those things are attributes that are
[51:31] reflected in God and yet sometimes
[51:34] there's things that can come around our
[51:36] way if Lord if you had been here but
[51:38] God's letting us know that even in the
[51:40] midst of things that when a situation
[51:42] itself would take place that would seem
[51:45] so dire and it would seem so final but
[51:48] let me say this to you there is nothing
[51:50] that is final as far as final with God
[51:53] but in all but in God all things are
[51:56] possible you you might look at the
[51:58] situation I might look at the situation
[52:01] and it looks very bleak
[52:02] it looks very hopeless but yet if we can
[52:05] look to the Lord as Martha did when she
[52:07] said if you had been here he wouldn't
[52:09] have died but she said I know whatsoever
[52:13] thou ask us God he'll give it to you she
[52:18] was confident that he that that what
[52:20] whatever would be asked it would be
[52:22] given so
[52:24] when I think of this I think of where
[52:26] you and I have been placed to where the
[52:28] scriptures would invite us to say if you
[52:31] ask the Father anything on my name that
[52:34] will I do that's the same God it's not
[52:37] us performing that word it's God
[52:39] performing his word and a think of how
[52:42] that near there the the very Almighty
[52:45] God standing here you know in this
[52:48] portion of Scripture here is where many
[52:50] will look at things and say well it was
[52:53] just it was just a man and you make too
[52:56] much of a hurry as a man he wept but yet
[52:58] that shows the greatness of God's
[53:00] condescension so to the place that God
[53:04] Himself condon sending creating a body
[53:06] and taking that body upon himself in
[53:09] order to redeem you and I this is the
[53:12] same Almighty God who stood there before
[53:15] Adam and molecules and time and dust
[53:18] this is the same God who brought forth
[53:20] life here is the very God of all
[53:24] eternity now tabernacled within his son
[53:27] Jesus Christ and he's standing there and
[53:30] he's announcing that I am the
[53:32] resurrection and the life I am the very
[53:35] one who brought forth life in the
[53:37] beginning the very one who took a
[53:39] situation that was dismal with void and
[53:42] darkness and no thorn and the very same
[53:44] God who brought that forth this is the
[53:47] same God now dwelling in their midst and
[53:49] yet when we see it how that within the
[53:52] midst of it that in the humanity part of
[53:55] it he was so moved to where he wept but
[53:58] yet beneath in the midst of all of that
[54:00] beyond the tears and beyond all of that
[54:03] it was God standing behind that veil God
[54:06] was in Christ and there was no way that
[54:09] a man could raise another man to life
[54:11] it's just like when you've ever been
[54:13] touched in your body and maybe it's a
[54:15] husband to a wife or a wife to a husband
[54:17] and you've prayed for one another you've
[54:19] been prayed for or you've prayed for
[54:21] someone else it was not your touch that
[54:23] that moved upon the need in the
[54:25] situation but it was God who moved and
[54:28] God honored faith because by his word it
[54:31] said if they shall lay hands on the sick
[54:33] they shall recover it's God honoring his
[54:36] word
[54:36] so it's God moving on the scene more
[54:39] than what a man could do even though the
[54:42] Lord Jesus loved him but yet it took
[54:44] more than just that of an earthly power
[54:47] to raise him up it took almighty draught
[54:50] this the only one that can raise from
[54:52] the dead back to life again
[54:55] and to think of how that you know
[54:57] brother Branham puts it like this he
[54:59] said in that time he said if he had not
[55:02] a spoke and called out Lazarus at that
[55:05] time he said I believe that everyone
[55:07] within the grave would have come forth
[55:09] let me read that and at that word Lord
[55:12] he said I can hear him scream with a
[55:13] loud voice way out there in spirit land
[55:16] Lazarus and I believe if he hadn't
[55:18] called him by name that have been the
[55:20] general resurrection right there
[55:22] I believe it that's what I think of him
[55:24] he said Lazarus come forth and
[55:26] corruption knew its master the spirit
[55:29] likewise Lazarus had been dead for days
[55:32] his soul was somewhere in eternity I
[55:34] don't know where he was that neither do
[55:35] you we won't argue about it where his
[55:37] soul was but anyhow it heard the voice
[55:40] of the Son of God and a man that had
[55:43] been dead for days stood up on his feet
[55:46] again when it looked like everything was
[55:52] sealed up come on now four days for
[55:57] messengers of death it looked like
[55:58] everything was sealed up but here stood
[56:01] he who is the resurrection and the life
[56:05] and no corruption though all of those
[56:07] things were then think about corruption
[56:09] corruption was the result of the fall at
[56:13] the beginning but here by the voice of
[56:16] the son of God speaking in that moment
[56:18] the authority of the word
[56:21] assembled what had been started in
[56:23] corruption and what was already starting
[56:25] to go in a certain way even as Martha
[56:28] said no doubt he now stinketh but the
[56:30] voice of the son of God
[56:32] went forth and corruption knew its
[56:36] master it had to heed to that voice so
[56:41] here was the glory of God
[56:45] in the very son of God who was reflect
[56:50] ding the glory of God this this all this
[56:53] whole moment and event was for that the
[56:57] glory of God might be made manifest that
[57:01] the Son of God might be glorified you
[57:04] know God's God's interested in that our
[57:07] faith and our confidence would be so
[57:11] built within him and it it takes more
[57:13] than just words compared to words and
[57:16] chapter to chapter and verse to verse
[57:18] and getting all the right words it takes
[57:20] more than that it takes the Living God
[57:23] the author of the word who gave the word
[57:26] to come and make that word alive and
[57:29] real and personal and move upon a heart
[57:32] to wear a heart might be ever so
[57:34] destitute and down and discouraged and
[57:37] it seems like there's no hope for him
[57:39] but it it takes the Living God to come
[57:41] on the scene and move upon that heart
[57:43] and begin to whisper to their life that
[57:45] there is a hope that there is a reason
[57:48] there is a lay out there is a living God
[57:51] there is the presence of God that can
[57:53] change and turn around your life you've
[57:55] got to have something to believe in
[57:57] you're gonna believe in something you're
[58:01] gonna believe in something it might as

[58:36] either for bed girth or tying up a
