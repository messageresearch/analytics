[36:49] I'm grateful to God that we have a
[36:51] certainty in him as David when David
[36:57] would write of that in Psalms 27 I think

[38:28] a prophet no no
[38:29] what God provides we need it all and
[38:34] it's God working through the gifts the
[38:39] ministerial gifts that he's placed in
[38:42] his body
[38:42] he's got a purpose and that's what
[38:45] continues on here in the scripture it
[38:48] continues on in that purpose and I'm not
[38:50] gonna read that for sake of time but
[38:51] there's a purpose that God has in mind
[38:54] an achievement amen let's just bow our

[40:11] been looking here in these ministerial
[40:14] offices of how that God has so given
[40:19] them and set in the body and how that
[40:22] God would work through the

[40:28] offices that he himself is the one who's
[40:31] meeting all of our needs we were looking
[40:34] at that with of an apostle the past
[40:37] couple of times and here tonight when we
[40:41] just begin to look into this I want to
[40:44] deal with it just a little bit on on
[40:46] that second part on how God has given
[40:50] some prophets and we recognize that
[40:52] that's a term and I I i have come to
[40:57] just see that term where it's just
[40:59] seemingly just has been used so loosely
[41:03] i said one of the things that i never
[41:06] seen too much of before until even when
[41:09] i had moved in the area and you can find
[41:11] it even among certain groups and things
[41:14] like that where everybody's a prophet
[41:17] and this one's a prophet and this one's
[41:19] a prophet and we we understand that when
[41:22] we we look at these things in the word
[41:25] of god i one scripture that has so stood
[41:28] out to me where it i look at all of this
[41:31] in the Word of God and we find that
[41:34] there is not one man who makes himself
[41:38] anything it's God who has already placed
[41:41] it within the man and God brings forth
[41:44] to vindicate whatever gift that he has
[41:47] placed in that man's life I love the
[41:50] scripture where it says in Hebrews five
[41:53] I believe it's verse 4 where it speaks
[41:55] of the calling unto unto be a high
[41:58] priest and it says no man taketh this
[42:01] honor unto himself even as Aaron and
[42:04] Aaron himself it was not Aaron who was
[42:07] vowing for a position but God in the
[42:11] vision he made known to Moses that see
[42:14] that I have called Aaron
[42:17] and God had already everything was
[42:19] already laid out just like in every one
[42:21] of these gifts and sometimes the gift
[42:24] itself even when it would start out thin
[42:27] let's say and in a life as we're
[42:29] focusing here within that of ministry
[42:31] sometimes it's a gift as it starts out
[42:34] and you know a person could say well I
[42:36] think this one's this or I think this
[42:38] brother maybe he's a teacher I think
[42:40] this brother he's a pastor I think one
[42:42] thing that's for sure whatever God has
[42:45] called him to do he's equipped them and
[42:49] when the scripture says do the work of
[42:51] an evangelist it doesn't necessarily
[42:53] mean that the man himself is an
[42:55] evangelist although a man can have more
[42:57] than one gift in his life Paul had Paul
[43:01] had multiple officers there within his
[43:04] own life so it isn't just that he would
[43:06] be in just one office but sometimes
[43:09] things can operate just for a season but
[43:11] it's always at God's discretion and it's
[43:14] always at God's choosing and I think we
[43:17] can see this oversight that it's God
[43:20] that is watched over and provided for
[43:22] itself and when we think of this here
[43:25] with that of the prophets we look here
[43:28] in the scripture and we know a prophet
[43:31] many times when we think of a prophet
[43:33] and I'm going to just kind of speak to
[43:35] this here tonight we we we sometimes
[43:39] just think in terms of major prophet and
[43:42] there is a one major prophet but there
[43:45] are minor prophets and sometimes where
[43:48] the scripture said and he gave some
[43:50] prophets so we recognize that when God
[43:53] has set forth this administration
[43:55] there's much of it that will parallel
[43:58] how it was in the Old Testament yet
[44:00] there are changes that have come about
[44:03] within that new administration as the
[44:06] Messiah has come and we see you know
[44:09] brother Branham would make make a
[44:10] statement like this and as I just refer
[44:14] to this tonight you say the Prophet he
[44:16] said as you'll take every office you say
[44:18] he's a special man and he says now it
[44:21] doesn't mean that he's a man above
[44:23] anybody else as far as he's a greater
[44:25] man but he's got a special job and a
[44:28] special Commission
[44:30] now what he said
[44:31] that's the prophet of the age and God
[44:35] has set that forth Eve it's identified
[44:38] that ministry that's to come forth of a
[44:42] prophet of God it's laid out in the
[44:45] scripture and God makes that known in
[44:48] his generation God will reveal that and
[44:51] it will be a ministry that is founded in
[44:54] the scriptures and the holy spirit
[44:55] declares it not everybody will hear it
[44:59] but those who are ordained to hear it
[45:01] will hear it
[45:02] and they recognize the office they
[45:06] recognize who is in their midst they
[45:09] recognize that authority of the word
[45:12] that's given and we recognize that when
[45:15] we see this there have always been God
[45:18] has always had prophets and there are
[45:21] major prophets that God would send to
[45:24] his people and we find that many times
[45:28] as the people has look in Israel they
[45:30] would get away from the word and God
[45:33] would send them the prophet and the
[45:35] Prophet would speak to them and begin to
[45:38] call out their ways and revealing the
[45:41] ways where they have drifted yet they
[45:44] were holding as it were the written word
[45:47] brother Bram says it like this in way of
[45:49] a true prophet he says here they were he
[45:52] said to think of Amos coming down into
[45:54] that city he said and they were holding
[45:56] the Word of God like the government he
[45:59] said in their looking at it that were
[46:01] still Christians and we're still
[46:03] believers he said they could not see
[46:05] that they had drifted from the word
[46:07] though they had the written word but
[46:10] they did not have the right
[46:13] interpretation of the word because the
[46:16] right interpretation of the word must
[46:19] come by the word himself and when the
[46:23] world himself interprets that word and
[46:25] makes it alive it draws the people of
[46:28] God in union with that word and then the
[46:31] people that become United with that
[46:33] message become the very reflection of
[46:36] God's own holiness because the word
[46:40] calls us to a separation
[46:43] that's why brother Branham says in the
[46:45] way of a true prophet I find how fitting
[46:47] he says don't blame the government it's
[46:50] not the government's fault he said for
[46:52] the way things are going it's because he
[46:55] said the pulpits have strayed from just
[46:58] saith the Lord they gone away from the
[47:02] Lifeline that happened in Israel it's
[47:04] happened here
[47:08] so God will have major profits then he
[47:12] will send to his people he'll call him
[47:14] back to the word from where they've
[47:17] drifted and yet there are also minor
[47:20] prophets that will better profit they
[47:23] prophesied being used of God like when
[47:26] you look at Micaiah here here stands
[47:29] micaiah he he stands there under the
[47:33] unction of the Holy Spirit and remember
[47:36] he was not loved by a hand he was hated
[47:40] the reason he was hated is because he
[47:44] told him the truth of his own sinful
[47:47] life he didn't like the word bringing
[47:51] conviction to his life but notice macaé
[47:54] could stand there and hear he by the
[47:57] Spirit of God he told him go ahead and
[48:00] go on up but he says I see Israel
[48:03] setting scattered on a hillside without
[48:06] a shepherd
[48:07] now remember Micaiah was standing there
[48:10] and where he was he's prophesying right
[48:13] in line with the prophecy that Elijah
[48:16] had already prophesied and refined that
[48:21] how ill I should follows that of Elijah
[48:23] and so how God has had major the major
[48:27] prophets there's been the minor prophets
[48:29] and now when we come over here into the
[48:32] New Testament I want to open up by
[48:34] looking at a few scriptures because you
[48:36] know how it is many times when you speak
[48:40] to people or as people talk it's in
[48:42] their books and they look at it as
[48:44] though prophets are a thing from the
[48:46] past now I believe you're sitting here
[48:48] tonight
[48:49] you recognize prophets are not a thing
[48:51] of the past
[48:53] because if you can put them in the past
[48:56] you can put God in the past in Matthew
[49:00] chapter 11 verse 13 for all the prophets
[49:03] and the law prophesied until John Luke
[49:08] 16:16 the law and the prophets were unto
[49:11] John since that time the kingdom of God
[49:14] is preached and every man presses into
[49:17] him Jesus is speaking here not as though
[49:21] that the law and the prophets were done
[49:23] away for with they they were prophesying
[49:26] of the Messiah to come and here was the
[49:29] one who was the fulfillment of it he
[49:32] himself said I have not come to do away
[49:34] with the prophets or the law you see
[49:38] when the fulfillment of the word has
[49:40] come and brought on the scene by God it
[49:42] doesn't have to change the word to try
[49:46] to fit in it is ordained of God and God
[49:49] puts that piece right in it's ordained
[49:52] place glory be to God a man doesn't have
[49:56] to alter the word to be able to stand in
[49:59] that office God has called him God's
[50:02] prepared him and God has watched over
[50:05] his life even and how to see it within
[50:09] marriage God has watched over that I
[50:13] believe that was on my heart in Hebrews
[50:17] 1:1 God who at sundry times and in
[50:22] divers manners spake in times past unto
[50:26] the father's in the prophets hath in
[50:29] these last days spoken unto us by his
[50:32] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[50:35] things by whom also he made the world
[50:39] now the same God who spoke through the
[50:42] prophets is the same God who came and
[50:46] revealed himself from word to flesh and
[50:50] that same God here as he spoke there in
[50:54] the Ministry of Jesus Christ is earthly
[50:57] ministry Paul is picking that up and
[50:59] saying that ministry has not ceased
[51:04] a man these 301 the father the word and
[51:11] the Holy Ghost is there what John said
[51:14] here it brings them all together now
[51:17] notice Jesus laying this down for the
[51:20] church in John 15:26 when the comforter
[51:24] has come whom I will send unto you from
[51:27] the father even the Spirit of Truth
[51:29] which proceedeth from the father he
[51:32] shall testify of me
[51:37] he's also bear witness because you have
[51:40] been with me from the beginning so the
[51:43] spirit of truth coming it brings
[51:46] conviction it draws that heart into a
[51:49] place to where not only does that heart
[51:52] land up and say he is my Savior but that
[51:55] heart yields for him
[51:57] to become Lord and when he becomes Lord
[52:00] then it testifies indeed he is the true
[52:04] atonement and add that which was a part
[52:08] now has been atoned for see that life
[52:11] will speak out the life that's within
[52:13] the blood now John 16:12 I have yet many
[52:17] things to say unto you but you cannot
[52:20] bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit
[52:27] of Truth has come he will guide you into
[52:30] all truth for he shall not speak of
[52:33] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[52:35] that shall he speak and he will show you
[52:38] things to come
[52:39] notice how the Lord Jesus he's declaring
[52:42] that Spirit of Truth here is the god of
[52:45] glory reflecting himself in the glory of
[52:49] God through the Son of God and he's
[52:52] declaring that when the Spirit of Truth
[52:55] has come there are things I want to tell
[52:57] you right now but you can't bear them
[53:01] God waits for an ordained season
[53:04] although he wants to say it he waits to
[53:07] the appropriate time just like when he
[53:11] said except you eat the flesh of the Son
[53:13] of Man and drink his blood he didn't
[53:15] explain it many walked away brother
[53:19] Aaron even the elect said if you ask
[53:21] them what does that mean I don't know
[53:23] but like Peter thou alone has the words
[53:26] of eternal life angle nowhere else I may
[53:30] have questions but I know I'm in the
[53:32] presence of one who dissolves all doubts
[53:35] and he is the answer to every question I
[53:38] have
[53:41] hallelujah
[53:44] when the Spirit of Truth has come he
[53:47] will guide you into all truth verse 14
[53:51] for he shall glorify me he shall receive
[53:56] of mine and shall shew it unto you all
[54:00] things that the father has are mine
[54:03] therefore said I then he shall take of
[54:06] mine and shall show it on to you he's
[54:11] establishing the Lord Jesus is
[54:13] establishing here the work of the Spirit
[54:16] of Truth in the church will be the
[54:20] testimony of Jesus Christ it'll be the
[54:23] spirit of prophecy in the Church of the
[54:27] Living God
[54:28] the church will be under his leadership
[54:32] listen it will be even closer than what
[54:35] it was when they came out of Egypt when
[54:37] they came out of Egypt the pillar of
[54:39] fire was before him the cloud was before
[54:42] but now this same one who was there to
[54:45] lead him said I'll be with you even in
[54:48] you to the end of the age I'll take the
[54:53] word and reveal it to you hallelujah Oh
[55:00] glory be to God
[55:02] blessed are your eyes to see and your
[55:05] ears that hear I remember what it was
[55:11] like as a boy to hear the message to
[55:14] hear it me preach but it was like going
[55:16] over my head
[55:18] you see this is where it comes even for
[55:20] your young people you don't have to go
[55:22] out in the world to know God's grace you
[55:24] don't have to smoke drink or anything
[55:26] else but in one one thing that happens
[55:28] is is how God moves in and this word it
[55:32] takes a hold in your life and Jesus
[55:34] Christ is revealed to be the same
[55:37] yesterday today and forever
[55:39] brother the love of God enters your
[55:41] heart and there's nothing else than
[55:44] matters hallelujah
[55:49] paul goes on and first Timothy 2:5 for
[55:52] there is one God and one mediator
[55:54] between God and men the man Christ Jesus
[55:58] who gave himself a ransom for all to be
[56:01] testified in due time are you a witness
[56:07] the ransoms been paid how do you know
[56:11] because I'm free I'm not just believing
[56:15] on to freedom I'm free I'm free right
[56:19] here I'm free we're in - I am ordained a
[56:24] preacher and an apostle I speak the
[56:28] truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of
[56:30] the Gentiles in faith and Verity brother
[56:34] Ram picks this up and I perceived out a
[56:36] prophet he says now to bring up this
[56:38] faith in Christ there's minister that's
[56:42] the most important thing of the day is a
[56:44] good god sent preacher not just a
[56:48] preacher anything enough how shall they
[56:54] preach except they be sent not by man
[56:58] but sent by God yeah not just running
[57:04] but running with a message hallelujah
[57:09] a good God sent preacher always says I
[57:14] admire them and their gift is far beyond
[57:17] anything that could be done in anything
[57:19] else is a preacher a man who knows how
[57:22] to rightly divide the word of God how
[57:26] does a man know that God is gifted and
[57:29] it's God coming down and using that gift
[57:32] it's not a man's ability it's the most
[57:36] wonderful gift in the world is to be a
[57:38] minister which a New Testament
[57:41] modern-day prophet a preacher prophecy
[57:45] means to foretell or to tell some
[57:48] personal thing he says and in other
[57:51] words the last statement prophesized to
[57:54] testify or foretell and that's the
[57:56] Spirit of Christ is prophecy in
[57:58] revelation 19:10 here were John is made
[58:04] known there of the bride in John in
[58:07] Revelation 19:10 here as he says I fell
[58:11] at his feet to worship Him and he said
[58:14] unto me see thou do I said not now
[58:16] remember there was in in Revelations 1
[58:18] there is an angel that is sent to
[58:21] signify these things to John but that
[58:23] angel is the same angel that was in the
[58:26] wilderness it's the same pillar fire the
[58:29] same age of the Lord not an earthly
[58:32] messenger but this is where that here
[58:35] that same age of the Lord as the age of
[58:38] the Lord came to Paul the angel of the
[58:40] Lord not just even to a prophet the
[58:42] Bible says he came to Philip the
[58:44] Evangelist the angel of the Lord came to
[58:47] Peter you see the angel of the Lord
[58:49] comes to the children of God we're under
[58:56] his direction the angel God encamps
[59:01] around those who fear Him and love him
[59:04] is that right so so as we see here that
[59:09] when we we recognize that here when when
[59:12] John would fall down to worship Him this
[59:15] particular individual here they have
[59:20] received of what God has revealed to
[59:24] them you remember brother Branham saying
[59:27] in
[59:30] false false anointed ones at the end
[59:32] time I think I have it correct brother
[59:34] Ram says in there he stops and he says
[59:36] oh can you get it separated now it's not
[59:40] he says he says he says it's ace on a
[59:43] man revealing ji-sun a man to be able to
[59:48] recognize that the God taking an earthly
[59:52] vessel and reflecting his life through
[59:57] glory you know that goes for me it
[59:59] challenged my god let my life be so
[1:00:03] surrender that you can reflect yourself
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:08] wherever we go see thou do it not see
[1:00:14] our real true ministry does not take
[1:00:17] worship and that fellow-servant and of
[1:00:21] thy brethren that have the testimony of
[1:00:24] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[1:00:28] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy
[1:00:35] the message a great warrior Joshua the
[1:00:39] dream says you know what a prophet is a
[1:00:41] New Testament prophet is a preacher is
[1:00:44] exactly a prophet is a preacher
[1:00:47] the word prophet means to foretell or
[1:00:50] tell forth look at his next statement
[1:00:52] either preach or for town he says now if
[1:00:58] you can't believe the dictionary for it
[1:00:59] here's what the Bible says the testimony
[1:01:02] of Jesus Christ is a spirit of prophecy
[1:01:04] you ready so every one of you are
[1:01:08] prophets to testify of Jesus Christ it's
[1:01:14] the spirit of prophecy the testimony of
[1:01:18] Jesus Christ
[1:01:19] is the spirit of prophecy now as we look
[1:01:25] at this on the day of Pentecost remember
[1:01:28] God had made a promise and a covenant
[1:01:33] then he would come and he would live
[1:01:35] inside of his children he would write
[1:01:38] upon the table of their hearts and their
[1:01:40] minds and he himself would come and live
[1:01:44] in his people this was a restoring of
[1:01:49] what and they have fallen from in Eden
[1:01:52] and on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:01:55] Bible says here when it fully come we
[1:01:57] find out that God subdividing himself
[1:02:01] all the fullness was in Christ Jesus in
[1:02:05] the Lord Jesus Christ but then as he's
[1:02:08] ascended up and here now being seated he
[1:02:12] sends back the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:02:14] Spirit it is poured out God pours
[1:02:18] himself into his believing church
[1:02:21] listen to me now there wasn't one person
[1:02:24] who got the Holy Ghost that was not a
[1:02:27] believer you first have to be a believer
[1:02:32] they were believer in the resurrected
[1:02:35] work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:39] they were distraught but when he stepped
[1:02:42] up there on the road of Emmaus and begin
[1:02:45] to take the scriptures concerning
[1:02:47] himself they did not recognize him
[1:02:50] physically but when he took that word
[1:02:52] and begin to reveal himself in the word
[1:02:55] and the Spirit of God would move down
[1:02:57] brother when they came there in the
[1:03:00] house he did something in their midst
[1:03:02] that he did one time before
[1:03:06] all it takes is God to manifest his
[1:03:09] promise that he's the same God and
[1:03:11] brother to a believer they say that's it
[1:03:14] every promise in the book belongs to me
[1:03:17] the Holy Ghost belongs to me Healing
[1:03:21] belongs to me
[1:03:22] deliverance belongs to me because a
[1:03:24] believer recognized God when he speaks
[1:03:30] if he made a promise one time and kept
[1:03:34] it he's a saint but tonight whoa
[1:03:40] hallelujah he said the works that I do
[1:03:48] shall you do also amen he would prove
[1:03:52] himself among his believing Church this
[1:03:57] was showed even in the Ministry of Moses
[1:04:00] here's Moses he's carrying the burden
[1:04:05] and God says bring to your side some
[1:04:10] elders and I will take of the spirit
[1:04:14] that is upon you and I will divide it on
[1:04:17] from them and God took the same spirit
[1:04:20] no less power
[1:04:21] just more machinery well what happened
[1:04:27] on the day of Pentecost acts 1:1 all
[1:04:29] great Theophilus I ran into you the
[1:04:31] things that Jesus began to do and teach
[1:04:34] he has not ceased he has not stopped
[1:04:38] whoa because when God has called you and
[1:04:41] God has equipped you with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] you have to be a witness the life of
[1:04:47] Jesus Christ in your life it prophesize
[1:04:50] I had just read here the scripture the
[1:04:53] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[1:04:56] of prophecy it's the Holy Ghost in your
[1:04:59] life that you have been made partners
[1:05:02] with him in Redemption to go search out
[1:05:05] for lost shows
[1:05:07] sheep that are out there God has placed
[1:05:09] you where he has for a reason it's so
[1:05:18] simple so simple but that just like what
[1:05:24] I heard the Prophet even say that again
[1:05:25] you the other day just like it just
[1:05:27] reached off there was on the ladder and
[1:05:28] just shipped me witnesses and this is
[1:05:32] where that Moses remember what you think
[1:05:36] of this the Spirit comes upon him they
[1:05:40] begin to prophesy there's two in the
[1:05:42] camp that are prophesying and Joshua
[1:05:46] raised them says hey let's go tell them
[1:05:48] to stop
[1:05:50] juster had to be corrected what did
[1:05:53] Moses say let me read this in here in
[1:05:56] numbers in numbers 11 29 Moses said
[1:05:59] impious down for my sake would God that
[1:06:04] all the Lord's people were prophets and
[1:06:07] that the Lord would put a spirit upon
[1:06:10] them a prophet what is moved by divine
[1:06:15] inspiration rather we're not church
[1:06:18] members amen we are prisoners of Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ we've been bought by a price
[1:06:26] we've been set free and that Christ
[1:06:30] might operate freely through our lives
[1:06:34] remember you may never preach a sermon
[1:06:36] but surely life preacher series it
[1:06:40] preaches sermons your life standing for
[1:06:43] that word
[1:06:43] it's thunder against Satan's Kingdom it
[1:06:47] thunders out purity holiness it's a life
[1:06:52] that's being lived through you it's not
[1:06:54] your voice it's God's voice that's
[1:06:57] living out through your life that's why
[1:07:01] Paul said your faith has sounded out so
[1:07:07] I'm brother Benson you want to win your
[1:07:08] loved ones be loyal to what you believe
[1:07:12] don't compromise stand silent on the
[1:07:16] Word of God they've gotta have somewhere
[1:07:19] to come back to this world is falling
[1:07:22] apart things they felt like they can put
[1:07:25] their feet on it's crumbling there's
[1:07:28] only one sure ground and that is dust
[1:07:31] saith the Lord
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:38] hallelujah
[1:07:39] I'm speaking to a special class of
[1:07:42] people tonight some may are not even
[1:07:48] graduated high school but you're a
[1:07:50] special class cuz it ain't based on your
[1:07:52] intellect there's something with inside
[1:07:56] of you a germ from the foundation of the
[1:07:59] world when the Holy Spirit
[1:08:01] it speaks brother it lifts that up
[1:08:04] there's a communication that's going on
[1:08:06] between you and God but there's
[1:08:11] sometimes things you do you don't even
[1:08:14] feel spiritual God is leading you and
[1:08:18] you have confidence he's leading me
[1:08:24] hallelujah I tell you what when the
[1:08:28] scripture says as Peter Steven oh my
[1:08:34] Paul throughout the book of Acts and on
[1:08:36] they were they declared what the
[1:08:39] prophets have spoken Jesus Christ has
[1:08:42] fulfilled so much so that Peter could
[1:08:45] say to him give all the prophets witness
[1:08:50] can I bring that on down what was hidden
[1:08:54] what was a mystery of Christ being
[1:08:59] reflected in Bride form now that same
[1:09:04] word gives witness of him present in his
[1:09:08] bride our lives are to give witness of
[1:09:12] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:18] my wife and I didn't know it's gonna say
[1:09:22] it but my wife and my mom were sitting
[1:09:23] outside the other day and I just was
[1:09:26] getting out of the car to walk up where
[1:09:27] they were sitting and here was two women
[1:09:30] they stomped and they looked mine and
[1:09:31] they said they just stopped and they
[1:09:33] looked out and they said I just said to
[1:09:36] my friend I know of those from women
[1:09:39] right there that's got contact with God
[1:09:43] let me tell you something the way that
[1:09:45] you dress and you carry yourself and you
[1:09:48] conduct yourself it speaks a lot that
[1:09:53] ain't to lift them up I'm saying it
[1:09:54] speaks a lot and many times you had
[1:09:58] people come over to your table and say
[1:09:59] I've seen a light above your table I
[1:10:04] tell you what my heart's desire is that
[1:10:07] they would surrender their life to God
[1:10:13] you see within this the scripture says
[1:10:16] as we were looking at reading here in
[1:10:20] this scriptures brother Brown with
[1:10:23] jealousy said now he said you know when
[1:10:25] we look at it he said at the change of
[1:10:28] the dispensation from law into grace it
[1:10:31] did not change God's still sending
[1:10:33] prophets for in the New Testament we
[1:10:35] find prophecy went on just the same and
[1:10:38] also prophets went on just the same now
[1:10:42] notice he's separating this here
[1:10:44] prophecy is a gift it's a gift that
[1:10:47] might be on one and then on another in
[1:10:50] any local church and everyone may
[1:10:53] prophesy one by one brother Branham is
[1:10:56] referring here to first Corinthians 14
[1:10:58] and I'm just being very intentional with
[1:11:01] it because the scripture here in 1st
[1:11:04] Corinthians 14 and I don't have it up
[1:11:06] there but you could probably turn to it
[1:11:09] in your in your scriptures you remember
[1:11:11] the Holy Spirit through Paul would
[1:11:14] admonish the mills and Corinthians
[1:11:16] because they were one has a tongue one
[1:11:18] has a solemn one as of this one is it
[1:11:20] this and you see it wasn't that it was
[1:11:23] wrong to want to do something for the
[1:11:26] kingdom of God it's that they had the
[1:11:29] cart before the horse it's not to take
[1:11:32] your gift and try to serve but it's your
[1:11:35] life and let God use it to serve his
[1:11:38] purpose
[1:11:40] and they were so caught up and wanting
[1:11:42] to do this and wanted into that and
[1:11:44] brother bream says when you go to start
[1:11:45] seeking after those things he said
[1:11:47] that's where demons can enter into that
[1:11:49] realm why because the very motive and
[1:11:52] objective at the very foundation is
[1:11:55] wrong that's why we wanna that's why
[1:11:58] Paul could say I'll show you a more
[1:12:00] excellent way he was not saying do away
[1:12:04] with the gifts he's letting it be known
[1:12:05] let love govern it and love itself as he
[1:12:08] lays it out by the Spirit of God it
[1:12:10] thinketh no evil in it you know it does
[1:12:13] not delight in iniquity and well it's
[1:12:16] patient its kind and you know as we go
[1:12:18] through Scripture let that be the
[1:12:20] governing principle of the gifts and
[1:12:24] Paul brings it in that whoever is going
[1:12:29] to just you know to speak he said pray
[1:12:32] rather that you may prophesy
[1:12:36] because prophecy edifies the church God
[1:12:41] uses the gifts sovereignly suffer it's
[1:12:47] about gone as we were looking at last
[1:12:49] week in the book of Acts the
[1:12:50] supernatural it was God using the gifts
[1:12:53] I think how Paul writes it in Hebrews
[1:12:56] four and it speaks of how God working by
[1:12:59] them miracles it was God doing the work
[1:13:03] and so when we look here in first
[1:13:06] Corinthians 14 see when we see this here
[1:13:09] in the scripture I'm just gonna read
[1:13:11] this here in first Corinthians 14 29 let
[1:13:15] the Prophet speak two or three and let
[1:13:17] the other judge those are not those are
[1:13:19] not ministerial gifts he's speaking of
[1:13:22] the gift of prophecy moving in the
[1:13:26] church every individual baptized into
[1:13:31] the body of Jesus Christ is subject to
[1:13:35] any of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:13:40] is that right this is why brother Brown
[1:13:43] would say a person can't say well I've
[1:13:45] got this gift and I've got that gift he
[1:13:47] deals with that on the nine spiritual
[1:13:48] gifts because you now you'll find there
[1:13:51] will be tendencies of where how things
[1:13:53] can be used but here's where it all
[1:13:55] comes down whether whether it has to do
[1:13:58] with the nine spiritual gift and one of
[1:14:00] the five ministerial gifts we want to be
[1:14:03] available we want to be available we
[1:14:07] want to be in a place where God can move
[1:14:09] down and use us Lord whatever you want
[1:14:14] me to do for your kingdom for your glory
[1:14:17] for the furtherance of your work David
[1:14:20] said I'd rather be a doormat at the
[1:14:22] house of god than to dwell in the tents
[1:14:25] of the wicked hey man I'd rather be
[1:14:29] there now notice let the Prophet speak
[1:14:31] two or three and let the other judge and
[1:14:33] now this whole part o my brother Brandon
[1:14:37] goes into this he says see he says you
[1:14:39] know you could keep on going there might
[1:14:41] in there
[1:14:41] it falls on this one and here you know
[1:14:43] the spirit of prophecy falls on this one
[1:14:46] this one speaks in tongues this one
[1:14:47] interprets it he says he could good you
[1:14:49] know keep on going but he says let it be
[1:14:51] by the course of two or three one thing
[1:14:56] one thing as of many things that the
[1:15:00] message brings back to the reality among
[1:15:03] the Church of the Living God is that as
[1:15:05] sons and daughters of God we're not just
[1:15:08] loosey-goosey are you with me it is not
[1:15:12] something well I don't got a little
[1:15:13] control over it or I can't help it but
[1:15:15] man said oh yes you do
[1:15:17] and many times I could come up here and
[1:15:20] maybe when I'm getting ready to
[1:15:21] introduce brothers so and solar lord
[1:15:23] help me if I come up here after they
[1:15:25] preach then you can feel that anointing
[1:15:26] right there that many times I go on a
[1:15:29] brother Brian lead them in song that
[1:15:30] anointing is right here you can just cut
[1:15:32] loose and start preaching the gift is
[1:15:36] there but I know it's not my time
[1:15:40] oh my now don't nobody bring up any
[1:15:46] dates when I did it either and this is
[1:15:51] why Paul would go home to say if
[1:15:53] anything be revealed to another that
[1:15:54] said it's by let the first hold his
[1:15:56] peace for you may all prophesy one by
[1:15:58] one that you all may learn and may be
[1:16:00] comforted and the spirits of the
[1:16:03] prophets are subject to the prophets for
[1:16:05] God is not the author of confusion but
[1:16:08] of peace as in all churches of the
[1:16:10] saints simply put the footnotes on it is
[1:16:14] when the spirit the spirit of the
[1:16:17] prophets out here is subject to the one
[1:16:20] who's standing in the pulpit you don't
[1:16:23] interrupt the ministering of the word so
[1:16:28] you see it's the Spirit of God prophecy
[1:16:30] moving out through there it's the
[1:16:33] testimony of Jesus Christ now listen
[1:16:35] that gift when it's burning on that
[1:16:37] heart I don't know I'm just going this
[1:16:38] way when it's burning on that heart
[1:16:40] remember the Spirit of God through the
[1:16:42] prophets ministry teaches ourselves you
[1:16:45] hang on to that to the end of the
[1:16:47] service and don't tell me you can't do
[1:16:51] it because there are many times there's
[1:16:53] things I've had to hold and not preached
[1:16:55] until a different time
[1:17:00] oh yes oh it's not easy but it but good
[1:17:07] but you see with that of the profits
[1:17:09] I want to just just just felt just to
[1:17:12] move that that piece right there where
[1:17:14] the Spirit of God moving through the
[1:17:16] profits and we see there's the
[1:17:18] difference between a prophesy being a
[1:17:22] gift one of the nine spiritual gifts and
[1:17:24] we need it because it's to bring comfort
[1:17:28] and edification to the church you see
[1:17:32] how the spirit of prophecy will move
[1:17:34] down when there's a decision to be made
[1:17:36] that persons praying about it Lord do I
[1:17:39] go here do I move here do and do this do
[1:17:41] I do this
[1:17:43] now the answer perhaps has been right
[1:17:45] before him all along but God's mercy
[1:17:47] will come right down and speak directly
[1:17:50] to that need I've witnessed it where God
[1:17:54] has spoke things so clearly you have to
[1:17:56] right here in the Assembly minute spoke
[1:17:58] so clearly I've witnessed to where God
[1:18:00] has called people by name and called him
[1:18:02] out to the altar
[1:18:03] I'm witness where the Holy Spirit has
[1:18:06] spoke when there was not a name put to
[1:18:09] it but the whole person who it was
[1:18:12] intended for they knew it was for them
[1:18:14] and they rejoiced and received peace God
[1:18:22] is purposeful aren't you glad for the
[1:18:27] testimony of Jesus Christ the spirit of
[1:18:29] prophecy it's God watching over his
[1:18:32] children so and this is where brother
[1:18:36] Bram says that he says a prophet is an
[1:18:38] office of the church it's not a gift in
[1:18:41] the church but an office of the church
[1:18:43] that's what a prophet is he says
[1:18:45] therefore deign predestinated there born
[1:18:47] of God they're not made they're born
[1:18:49] prophets and I want to just come back to
[1:18:52] that to that place here and just try to
[1:18:54] move in here for the home run stretch as
[1:18:57] it were tonight and taking that part
[1:19:00] where a prophet is a preacher where it
[1:19:03] says and some prophets which is to
[1:19:06] foretell or tell forth either preach or
[1:19:09] for town and G here the Lord Jesus
[1:19:12] speaking through Paul in first
[1:19:14] Corinthians 12 says now ye are the body
[1:19:17] of Christ and members in particular and
[1:19:20] God has set some in the church first
[1:19:23] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[1:19:25] teachers and he goes on down through the
[1:19:28] rest and here let me just do without
[1:19:32] quoting this but just to refer to it
[1:19:35] this will brother Brandon picks this up
[1:19:37] in voice of the sign and he talks of how
[1:19:40] preaching is a gift that's inspired of
[1:19:43] God and how that a man can actually have
[1:19:47] more than one gift in his life and you
[1:19:49] seen the scripture then we just read
[1:19:51] with Paul Paul said the preacher an
[1:19:54] apostle and a teacher
[1:19:56] to the Gentiles Paul had many gifts in
[1:20:00] his life ministerial offices
[1:20:04] that's right sometimes a person says
[1:20:06] well I thought this brother was an
[1:20:07] evangelist and now he's pastoring a
[1:20:09] church
[1:20:09] well if he's if he's entertained a
[1:20:11] pastor then you know what God had that
[1:20:13] any mall go all the time it'll come out
[1:20:17] when it gets into that time there's
[1:20:19] gonna be little things here and there
[1:20:20] but it will come out within that time
[1:20:23] it's the same thing you look at this and
[1:20:26] sometimes let me just pause on this
[1:20:28] sometimes this is where that I think so
[1:20:33] much pressure sometimes can come even
[1:20:35] morale young ministers is because it's
[1:20:38] the feeling of what am i what am i what
[1:20:41] am i a mine apostle and my prophet and
[1:20:43] my pastor am i this are you a minister
[1:20:46] well yeah we'll go and preach because
[1:20:50] you may not be an apostle you may not be
[1:20:53] a pastor you may not be a teacher you
[1:20:56] may you might just be a preacher
[1:21:01] nothing wrong with that nothing wrong
[1:21:06] with praying for the preacher either
[1:21:08] I'll take that
[1:21:12] you see it's not it's not for us to
[1:21:15] decide even how God gives a man then
[1:21:18] I'll God will gift a certain man and God
[1:21:21] the way that the measure of the gift
[1:21:23] will operate within that man's life you
[1:21:26] can't compare other men to him it's how
[1:21:28] it's caught God's the one then as
[1:21:30] determined on that have some are more
[1:21:32] gifted than others
[1:21:34] Oh God knows what he's doing in all of
[1:21:41] that it's to keep us looking to him this
[1:21:45] is where brother Branham makes it in
[1:21:47] this in this quote and and you find him
[1:21:50] dealing with this over and over because
[1:21:54] among the churches and things they have
[1:21:57] God that got to such a place they no
[1:21:59] longer believed in prophets they would
[1:22:01] take scriptures of Daniel Scylla seal up
[1:22:04] the prophecy Daniel till the time of the
[1:22:06] end and men will interpret things and
[1:22:08] you know they're trying to do all they
[1:22:10] all they can do but you see by not
[1:22:13] reading the full scripture you recognize
[1:22:16] that that wasn't the end of prophets
[1:22:19] there's prophets in the New Testament so
[1:22:27] this is why brother brems says you can't
[1:22:30] he says it like this he says as long as
[1:22:32] there's apostles there's got to be a
[1:22:34] prophet as long as there's a prophet
[1:22:36] there's got to be evangelists there's a
[1:22:38] pastor evangelist but there's no prophet
[1:22:40] see that's you picking what you want to
[1:22:42] and making it say something it doesn't
[1:22:45] we don't want to be Pickers we want to
[1:22:48] be believers
[1:22:53] hallelu
[1:22:54] it's a cohesive unit it's the Ministry
[1:22:58] of Jesus Christ perfecting the Saints
[1:23:01] edifying the body of Jesus Christ with a
[1:23:04] growth into manhood into full maturity
[1:23:07] now remember Peter would Peter would
[1:23:10] speak of this word of prophecy that
[1:23:12] we've received and he would say we've
[1:23:15] received a more sure word of prophecy
[1:23:18] this is not cunning devised fables Peter
[1:23:26] said we have witnessed we stood there we
[1:23:30] heard we seen on Mount Transfiguration
[1:23:35] and we have received of the evidence of
[1:23:39] the resurrection in our own life
[1:23:43] we have a more sure word of prophecy
[1:23:47] for the prophecy I love this in verse 21
[1:23:49] came not in old time by the will of man
[1:23:52] but holy men of God spake as they were
[1:23:54] moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:23:57] 1st Peter 4:11 If any man speak let him
[1:24:00] speak as the Oracles of God If any man
[1:24:03] Minister let him do it as of the ability
[1:24:06] which God giveth that God and all things
[1:24:09] may be glorified through Jesus Christ to
[1:24:11] whom be praised and Dominion for ever
[1:24:13] and ever amen
[1:24:16] now that going into this part tonight
[1:24:18] but I think we recognized here in the
[1:24:22] New Testament
[1:24:25] Paul Apostle Paul was indeed the prophet
[1:24:32] of God to that first age and he would
[1:24:36] take that word he was commissioned by
[1:24:39] God to bret baier the name of the lord
[1:24:43] jesus unto the gentiles paul spoke very
[1:24:49] affirmatively and i'm not going to go
[1:24:51] into that aspect of it tonight because
[1:24:54] paul and beed was the major prophet
[1:24:57] after the lord jesus it went off the
[1:24:59] scene here Paul is the one was
[1:25:03] separating law from grace remember Peter
[1:25:08] would even Express and say hey I know
[1:25:12] some of you from our beloved brother
[1:25:14] Paul the wisdom that God has given him
[1:25:19] some he says wrestle those that are
[1:25:24] unlearned they wrestle he said things
[1:25:27] it's hard to be understood look at God's
[1:25:29] grace when it was crossing over the
[1:25:32] overlapping from the Jews to the
[1:25:33] Gentiles remember Paul said I preached
[1:25:36] the Word of God in that the word being
[1:25:38] declared by signs wonders and miracles
[1:25:39] from Jerusalem throughout and then God
[1:25:43] turned fully to the Gentiles right God
[1:25:48] turned fully to the Gentiles because the
[1:25:50] Jews had rejected but yet there were
[1:25:52] Jews in that first age brother and that
[1:25:55] were part of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:57] and the things that they had been under
[1:25:59] or you know not eating this and not
[1:26:02] doing that and keeping this feast
[1:26:03] God in His grace did not look to them
[1:26:07] and say don't do that but he recognized
[1:26:10] you can't bring that over unto the
[1:26:12] Gentiles because Christ is the
[1:26:15] fulfillment of all of those things there
[1:26:19] had to be a word of authority and that's
[1:26:22] why Paul could say the same who wrought
[1:26:26] effectually in me that Apostleship to
[1:26:30] the circumcision the same one wrought
[1:26:34] mightily in Peter to the circumcision
[1:26:38] remember Peter even had a problem right
[1:26:41] Peter was eating a pork chop had the
[1:26:43] juice all over his hands and here the
[1:26:45] Brethren showed up from Jerusalem the
[1:26:49] beggining listen to me see under the
[1:26:53] pressure you see this is why Paul could
[1:26:56] say it is not done in faith it's sin
[1:27:05] who
[1:27:07] so here God in the book of Acts let me
[1:27:12] just look at this just for a moment a
[1:27:13] few places here is Paul he's struck down
[1:27:18] on the road to Damascus now there's
[1:27:21] already prophets in the church here's
[1:27:25] the fears brother branham picks this up
[1:27:27] he picks up the one of the first
[1:27:29] dimensions is right here with Ananias he
[1:27:32] said Ananias and acts 9 I don't have
[1:27:35] that there in the scriptures but acts 9
[1:27:36] God reveals himself to and a nice bad
[1:27:39] vision he says go down and I there is
[1:27:43] one in the street called straight and
[1:27:45] you know he makes it known and what then
[1:27:47] Ananias a lord
[1:27:49] not that guy not that guy but God notice
[1:27:55] Ananias he's yielded to God and God says
[1:27:58] no for I've chosen him he's a chosen
[1:28:01] vessel Oh glory be to God
[1:28:05] what Ananias then you might have been
[1:28:08] Ananias Oh Lord I don't know about them
[1:28:10] I don't know about there remember there
[1:28:12] was somebody that said that about you
[1:28:16] but God said there and chosen vessel oh
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:21] [Laughter]
[1:28:24] he goes down there by vision and he
[1:28:27] prays for him scales fall from eyes
[1:28:31] receives the Holy Ghost as baptized now
[1:28:34] notice the Bible says in acts 11 27 it
[1:28:38] says and in those days Came prophets
[1:28:40] from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there
[1:28:44] stood up one of them named Agabus and
[1:28:46] signified by the spirit that there
[1:28:48] should be a great dearth throughout all
[1:28:50] the world which came to pass in the days
[1:28:53] of Claudius Caesar now here God sends
[1:28:57] Agathis down there with other prophets
[1:29:02] preachers but agamous now listen to me
[1:29:05] now activist he also this is a gift
[1:29:09] that's operating a ministerial gift
[1:29:13] God still has a ministerial gift of
[1:29:17] profits and notice where those profits
[1:29:22] came they weren't off by themselves
[1:29:25] drawing people to themselves they were
[1:29:28] of God they went to the Church of God
[1:29:31] because that's where they were a part of
[1:29:37] this is a postal Accord it's not profit
[1:29:43] setting out here and sending out things
[1:29:45] and doing this and overriding the local
[1:29:47] sovereignty that's not a prophet of God
[1:29:52] prophets were sent from Jerusalem let me
[1:29:54] just drop this in - it's free one thing
[1:29:57] you find in the book of Acts you don't
[1:29:59] find the people evangelist the ministers
[1:30:03] you don't find them just walking around
[1:30:06] loosey-goosey like brother where you
[1:30:09] come from I'm just an evangelist oh yeah
[1:30:13] who's your pastor I'm just an evangelist
[1:30:15] hey they didn't have a whole trench
[1:30:17] you ain't preaching here that's
[1:30:20] apostolic because the Bible says when
[1:30:23] they win you can read this in the
[1:30:25] scriptures they wrote letters of
[1:30:27] commendation have this brother in he'll
[1:30:31] be a blessing to you that's apostolic it
[1:30:39] wasn't just somebody floating out here
[1:30:41] like a whim when there was something
[1:30:43] purposed to be done they got the elders
[1:30:46] together they fasted they pray until the
[1:30:50] Holy Ghost spoke he's the same God hello
[1:30:56] somebody he's the same God I'm talking
[1:30:59] about the testimony of Jesus Christ the
[1:31:01] spirit of prophecy agamous here was a
[1:31:07] New Testament prophet as he comes down
[1:31:09] you're aware
[1:31:11] when activists come I could act 21:8
[1:31:17] here is Paul Paul's coming to the right
[1:31:23] before going to
[1:31:25] appear they're going into Jerusalem in
[1:31:30] verse 10 let me just skip to there as we
[1:31:34] tarry there they come to Caesarea says
[1:31:37] as we tarried there there came down from
[1:31:39] Judea a certain prophet named Agabus
[1:31:42] remember Paul was the major prophet
[1:31:46] that's why brother Branham would say in
[1:31:48] the church age book he says I don't deny
[1:31:50] he says that there's not many other
[1:31:53] prophets he says as it was in the days
[1:31:55] of Paul he said but I will say this with
[1:31:58] the scripture there is but one in that
[1:32:01] day and this day that has the ministry
[1:32:04] of infallibility whoo hallelujah there
[1:32:11] was a standard all glory be to God
[1:32:13] brother that same absolute that was
[1:32:16] within Paul's heart that was the same
[1:32:18] absolute in the lives of the people as
[1:32:21] an anchor as a sure word of prophecy the
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost had made it real to them it
[1:32:28] didn't mean that they understood
[1:32:29] everything or could explain everything
[1:32:31] but brother they knew there was an
[1:32:34] absolute anchor and the end of all
[1:32:37] strife they had commander the testimony
[1:32:43] of Jesus Christ their lives were a
[1:32:45] testimony of redemptions work that I was
[1:32:50] included in Redemption I'm not the same
[1:32:54] person 11 and when he came unto us
[1:33:00] he took Paul's girdle and bound his own
[1:33:04] hands and feet and said thus saith the
[1:33:07] Holy Ghost
[1:33:08] so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the
[1:33:11] man that oneth this girdle it shall
[1:33:14] deliver him into the hands of the
[1:33:15] Gentiles
[1:33:17] and brother Brown picks this up and he
[1:33:19] says Paul should have listened powerful
[1:33:22] statement he said Paul should have
[1:33:24] listened he said but what it was now
[1:33:26] watch this is something here I love what
[1:33:30] you're going through that in the Holy
[1:33:31] Spirit just moving that on down but he
[1:33:33] said what it was is that Paul was tired
[1:33:37] he was tired he said Paul wanted he
[1:33:41] hadn't set in his heart he wanted to die
[1:33:45] for the cause of Jesus Christ Paul
[1:33:50] esteemed Stevens so much that testimony
[1:33:55] for the brandman you know will come off
[1:33:57] then he said C says that's why we need
[1:33:58] to listen to the Holy Spirit Paul wasn't
[1:34:01] out of the will of God are you with me
[1:34:03] but you see the Holy Spirit was dealing
[1:34:07] with him the word was going to get to
[1:34:08] Rome God had a way of getting it there
[1:34:11] ha let's just stop here tonight on in
[1:34:16] the scriptures in acts 13 1 there in the
[1:34:19] church was an ante and was that Antioch
[1:34:21] certain prophets and teachers will be
[1:34:24] talking about preachers remember a New
[1:34:28] Testament prophet is a preacher Herman
[1:34:33] says well this just this brothers a
[1:34:34] prophet well he is does he preach nope
[1:34:38] being he ain't a prophet sorry this is
[1:34:42] all through the message this is the
[1:34:43] scripture
[1:34:45] God doesn't have men sitting around and
[1:34:47] well this man's in the church and he's a
[1:34:49] prophet you know know if he's a prophet
[1:34:51] and ministerial gift then he's a
[1:34:53] preacher are you with me you can't
[1:34:57] confuse a prophet and a gift of prophecy
[1:35:00] and if it's a gift of prophecy that's
[1:35:03] got to be proven by two or three and
[1:35:06] judged before it should ever come out in
[1:35:08] the church that's scriptural is that
[1:35:11] right what's that that's keeping the
[1:35:13] church in order
[1:35:17] all glory be to God can I read one more
[1:35:20] scripture Samuel I'm not one of these
[1:35:27] little prop planes I need a longer
[1:35:30] runway I don't mean anything higher
[1:35:36] lifted up by that I understand I wish I
[1:35:37] could come to like brother Jewell said
[1:35:39] parachute out of here
[1:35:40] mater I can find that gear
[1:35:44] knocks 15 here were epistles that were
[1:35:50] sent to the church that was gathered in
[1:35:54] Antioch with Paul and barn
[1:35:56] remember there have been Judaizers men
[1:35:59] James said we didn't send those men
[1:36:02] those men have come down there to try to
[1:36:04] cause trouble to try to make followers
[1:36:09] after themselves saying you must be
[1:36:11] circumcised you got to do this gene you
[1:36:12] got it remember they came among the
[1:36:13] Galatians and the Galatians one thing
[1:36:16] that's known about the Galatian people
[1:36:18] they're fickle people as you see God in
[1:36:22] His mercy God will take that right there
[1:36:25] in that powerful brother Joshua God
[1:36:27] doesn't say you know what oh man your
[1:36:29] makeup oh no no what am I gonna no no no
[1:36:32] God says I'll take that he already know
[1:36:36] about you and me he knew about our
[1:36:39] makeup mind that alone when I think of
[1:36:43] myself
[1:36:43] that's a mighty God
[1:36:49] let me get to the scripture verse 31 of
[1:36:53] Acts 18 went which when they had read
[1:36:55] they rejoiced for the consolation and
[1:36:57] Judas and Silas being prophets also
[1:37:00] themselves exhorted the Brethren with
[1:37:04] many words and confirmed them so I want
[1:37:07] you to see this they just didn't give
[1:37:08] them
[1:37:10] well I can't find that they just didn't
[1:37:12] give him the the epistles and say hey go
[1:37:16] just read this no no they took the
[1:37:20] epistles and they preached they exhorted
[1:37:26] them in this world
[1:37:37] you know in the Old Testament when you
[1:37:40] read through the Old Testament how many
[1:37:42] times brother Shane we're reading
[1:37:43] through there the Bible would talk about
[1:37:45] in the days of Israel say and here came
[1:37:47] a prophet of the Lord
[1:37:48] you know his name
[1:37:50] you know he's named a prophet of the
[1:37:52] Lord come and stood before the altar and
[1:37:54] probably you know his name the one thing
[1:37:57] you know he was a vessel that was
[1:38:00] surrendered to God importance is not
[1:38:04] about the name
[1:38:05] the importance is the message was
[1:38:07] delivered and there were people that
[1:38:09] received it
[1:38:15] in the changing
[1:38:18] from that white horse rider over into
[1:38:22] the red horse rider you come to that
[1:38:24] place of the niceic Council and here
[1:38:29] were Roman Catholicism where they're
[1:38:32] wanting to draw in the churches and
[1:38:35] they're wanting to make it under the
[1:38:37] control of the government
[1:38:39] one church they're all compromises they
[1:38:43] called the niceic council but Dave we
[1:38:47] don't know the names of these brethren
[1:38:51] brother Carlos the history tells us
[1:38:55] these were men that came out of the
[1:38:58] wilderness eating herbs and wrapped in
[1:39:01] sheepskin and they came there and they
[1:39:04] told the men don't you go to that
[1:39:07] council because we don't need to reason
[1:39:12] about God's Word God's church is a
[1:39:16] separated church brother Aaron they
[1:39:19] walked out there we don't know their
[1:39:21] names
[1:39:22] but they were put out
[1:39:25] but that seed had to go in the ground
[1:39:28] and the seed that went in the ground
[1:39:31] it's come through the stages back now in
[1:39:34] its fullness where the same God prophet
[1:39:39] that manifested himself back there in
[1:39:42] the initiating of redemption has come
[1:39:45] and moving through his body
[1:39:47] he's worked through the ministry in the
[1:39:49] office of a prophet in this last days
[1:39:52] and he is present in his body to finish
[1:39:57] redemptions work prophets
[1:40:03] are they needed yes yes and I say this
[1:40:09] very clearly I believe it with all my
[1:40:11] heart
[1:40:12] God has profit still don't probably
[1:40:16] David they would never I'm not talking
[1:40:17] about these guys that get off on these
[1:40:18] flyers you've got plenty of them that
[1:40:20] around that they're the apostle to the
[1:40:21] bride there that this that when you say
[1:40:24] that that chose me you got a wrong
[1:40:26] spirit because God has sent a voice in
[1:40:30] this hour there's one messenger to an
[1:40:34] age and that messenger had declared that
[1:40:37] the fluence is that age that Jesus
[1:40:39] Christ
[1:40:40] when man begins to purport himself as
[1:40:43] something he's nothing new with me it's
[1:40:48] good no man takes this honor unto
[1:40:50] himself even Jesus Christ did not
[1:40:53] glorify himself to be made high priest
[1:40:58] that's the pattern
[1:40:59] but the BAM tells us the man he says
[1:41:02] that's vying for the office is usually
[1:41:04] he said that's the man that's not called
[1:41:08] he doesn't have the right reverence
[1:41:10] because the same God that calls you and
[1:41:12] you stand there and say god I can't do
[1:41:14] it Lord how can I do it you say oh
[1:41:16] brother salmon that minute in when you
[1:41:17] first started bridging no no I'm more
[1:41:19] nervous now than when I first started I
[1:41:21] find myself walking on here just like
[1:41:23] even here tonight and I'll let you in a
[1:41:24] little something there was something
[1:41:26] human as I walked here and I said Lord
[1:41:27] do I preach this or do I go under this
[1:41:29] other thought that's also burning on my
[1:41:30] heart what do I go where'd I go even as
[1:41:33] I walk where do I go
[1:41:35] I need you Lord you can say I need you
[1:41:39] Lord I need you Lord Jesus I'm so
[1:41:45] grateful for God's mercy different
[1:41:48] testimonies as I said I've witnessed
[1:41:50] that God has normally as a preacher but
[1:41:55] men of God God will come down and
[1:41:58] they'll speak to
[1:42:03] things they'll be called out say praise
[1:42:06] be to God you know why I'm in that body
[1:42:12] my foot may not be rejoicing about the
[1:42:14] doughnut that I ate but my mouth is
[1:42:17] rejoicing pretty soon my foot will be
[1:42:19] happy it'll get the energy don't you
[1:42:22] love the Lord New Testament prophets and
[1:42:27] God declared in his word there would be
[1:42:34] a visitation in the end time
[1:42:41] you love him
[1:42:43] all right
[1:42:46] I hear the door on the on the cockpit I
[1:42:53] want to live the way he wants me to the

[1:42:58] way he wants me to live

[1:43:07] keep reaching no no no he misunderstand
[1:43:11] it's the testimony of Jesus Christ the
[1:43:13] spirit of prophecy is his life living
[1:43:17] out through me

[1:43:27] let's stand if we could you love him
