[34:57] Heavenly Father
[35:00] that is nothing but the truth Lord
[35:04] it's your presence Lord
[35:07] we're thankful
[35:10] that God not only that you would come
[35:12] and you meet with us right here
[35:15] Lord I'm so thankful that your presence
[35:17] is not confined to a building
[35:20] that's what a real relationship is with
[35:23] you Lord
[35:24] it's not confined to a day of the week
[35:26] it's not confined
[35:29] Lord to a building
[35:31] but we are your Tabernacle Lord
[35:34] We Are The Dwelling Place the Lord
[35:37] we are that house of prayer Lord that
[35:40] place oh God where there is communion in
[35:43] you Lord you are dwelling in us and we
[35:46] in you it's a relationship Lord how
[35:50] wonderful Lord that we can testify of
[35:53] your presence
[35:55] coming to us Lord when we're driving
[35:58] coming to us Lord
[36:00] in most peculiar times Lord
[36:04] be the Lord how that you come
[36:07] and your presence it means everything to
[36:10] us Lord
[36:11] as David could say
[36:14] even though Lord
[36:16] that the enemies are all gathered around
[36:18] but yet
[36:19] you've prepared for us a table
[36:23] and it's in your presence that there's a
[36:25] fullness of joy divine
[36:28] it's in your presence Lord
[36:30] that God
[36:32] our identity is revealed
[36:34] where we are strengthened Lord where we
[36:37] are encouraged
[36:39] it's in your presence the Lord
[36:42] father we just Lord openly declare we
[36:45] would rather have your presence
[36:47] than anything else in this life Lord
[36:53] we love you tonight Lord
[36:56] for every need Lord that's gathered
[36:58] invisible
[36:59] and then the invisible audience Lord may
[37:02] you come and minister to our hearts
[37:04] minister to our needs Lord
[37:07] you know just what we have need of Lord
[37:09] May virtue Lord just go forth Lord to
[37:13] minister to our hearts Lord
[37:16] we just give ourselves to you Lord in
[37:18] the remaining part of this service
[37:20] for the glory of God
[37:23] in Jesus precious name
[37:26] Hallelujah
[37:28] blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:31] amen you loving tonight
[37:34] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[37:37] amen
[37:38] we want to look here in the scriptures
[37:40] I'd like to go to job chapter 20.
[37:44] tonight if the Lord will help us
[37:59] and they were just going to just to let
[38:01] you know I just had just a little
[38:04] reference note that I was just going to
[38:06] hit with this chapter we'll look at
[38:08] tonight and just keep rolling to another
[38:10] chapter but I just couldn't get Beyond
[38:13] and the Holy Spirit kept dealing with my
[38:15] heart on on Friday of last week so
[38:19] that's why we're here where we're at
[38:21] because I I certainly believe that in
[38:23] the midst of of a test or a trial it's
[38:26] the things that really matter most
[38:29] is what is declared
[38:31] and that's what I'd like to speak to you
[38:33] about just for a few moments I probably
[38:35] won't get finished with it tonight vote
[38:36] I just want to speak on a little thought
[38:39] what really matters
[38:41] what really matters and that's what the
[38:43] Holy Spirit just pressed on my heart so
[38:45] if we could I want to read in Job
[38:47] chapter 20 and this is so far this is
[38:49] the response that is being given after
[38:52] job has come out of job 19 where that
[38:57] glorious Revelation has been given and I
[38:59] want you to understand this that when
[39:01] that Revelation has been given in job 19
[39:05] and I want you to keep this in mind and
[39:07] the Holy Spirit will see fit later on
[39:09] whatever God reveals he never takes away
[39:12] from it he only adds to it
[39:15] God just makes it more glorious so what
[39:18] God revealed in job 19 by the time you
[39:21] get to job 42 it's more glorious
[39:24] so God continues to unfold his promise
[39:28] to you and I and the Assurance you think
[39:29] of it in this hour we're living in we
[39:32] have even a greater Assurance than what
[39:34] Martin Luther had
[39:36] we have a greater Assurance than what
[39:38] Pentecost had in 1906 we have a greater
[39:41] Assurance see God doesn't take away he
[39:43] only adds he only unfolds more of his
[39:46] grace to you and I so here is Job
[39:49] chapter 20 here is so far that is
[39:51] answering to this
[39:53] and so far as answering in verse two he
[39:56] says therefore do my thoughts cause me
[39:58] to answer and for this I make haste I
[40:02] have heard the check of my reproach and
[40:06] the spirit of my understanding calls
[40:08] with me to answer so he's saying this is
[40:10] why I've been prompted I've heard what
[40:11] you've said but I'm prompted to answer
[40:13] now notice thou not this of old since
[40:17] man was placed upon Earth that the
[40:20] triumphing of the wicked is short and
[40:24] the joy of the hypocrite but for a
[40:27] moment may God bless the reading of the
[40:30] word as you're being seated
[40:32] remember job has he's continued to in
[40:36] the opening part of job 19 where we
[40:38] pulled from job has continued to make it
[40:40] very clear of the surroundings and the
[40:43] circumstance that he's in it's a we know
[40:45] it's a very dire circumstance
[40:48] and the conditions that are around it
[40:50] but I just want to just straw draw from
[40:53] this as we begin to lay for this thought
[40:55] on what really matters you know we think
[40:59] of the song and I know we know it very
[41:01] well I'd rather have Jesus than silver
[41:04] or gold I I'd rather have Jesus than
[41:07] rich as Untold
[41:08] and we know that we're always there's
[41:11] always a test that's out to remember
[41:12] when Daniel stood in Babylon and Daniel
[41:15] made the Declaration along with the
[41:18] other
[41:19] um Hebrew Brethren that they were not
[41:21] going to take of the king's meat and
[41:23] when they did that brother Brown picks
[41:25] that up and he says when you have
[41:27] purposed in your heart to make a stand
[41:29] for God he said Satan is going to make
[41:31] you prove it
[41:32] and so Satan made him prove it and to
[41:34] think they did not have of the king's
[41:37] meat
[41:38] but yet at the end of the time when they
[41:40] had enough when they had nothing but
[41:42] Paulson so forth that you or I would
[41:44] have said is not very there's no way
[41:46] this is going to be sustained them but
[41:48] you see it wasn't the pulse that really
[41:51] was sustaining them it was they were in
[41:53] the will of God
[41:55] and when we're in the will of God God
[41:58] takes the things that is beyond that of
[42:01] the natural mind and God sustains his
[42:04] children with things that are thought to
[42:07] be impossible when they came and looked
[42:09] at the Hebrew children at the end they
[42:11] were more Fuller they were plumper they
[42:15] were you know they they look like boy
[42:17] they've been eating good and yet the
[42:19] rest of the of the people in that
[42:21] particular area they had been eating
[42:23] let's just say the filet mignon they had
[42:25] been you know eating all of the fine
[42:27] Delicacies but they didn't look like
[42:30] Daniel and the rest of them you know
[42:32] what the difference was is because
[42:34] Daniel and them made a stand for God
[42:36] and when you make a stand for God don't
[42:38] be afraid of what the enemy will do
[42:40] because when you make a stand for God
[42:42] Jesus said remember if you're ashamed of
[42:44] me and my words in this generation then
[42:46] I'll be ashamed of you but if we'll
[42:49] stand for him then we've got all Heaven
[42:51] backing us up and God will make his word
[42:54] come to pass and so I say that with that
[42:57] song I'd Rather Have Jesus and I just
[43:00] want to read a few statements here
[43:01] before I proceed on with Job chapter 20.
[43:04] and brother Brown's beginning to talk
[43:06] about how I would rather have favor with
[43:08] God and be called a Holy Roller be
[43:10] called a fanatic whatever they want to
[43:12] call me I would rather have favor with
[43:15] God and to know that he's standing right
[43:17] here this afternoon then all the wealth
[43:20] that's in Chicago he said I'd rather to
[43:22] me this is a powerful statement I'd
[43:24] rather be standing right here now
[43:26] holding this picture he's talking about
[43:28] the picture from the Houston Coliseum
[43:30] with the pillar of fire I'd rather be
[43:32] standing here holding this picture and
[43:34] telling you what this is and knowing
[43:36] that he's standing right here within
[43:38] five feet of where I'm standing now I'd
[43:41] rather have this feeling and consolation
[43:43] that I have right now than to be king
[43:46] over all the Earth for a million years
[43:49] he goes on he talks about how you know
[43:51] he's driving a backslidden Chevy pickup
[43:53] truck that's six years old and a Pontiac
[43:56] that's three years old and you know they
[43:58] have the clothes what they have they
[44:00] have on and they have some back at the
[44:01] home and he said but I'd rather live
[44:03] like that and have favor with God than
[44:06] have the best movie star home there is
[44:08] setting on Hollywood Hill over here I'd
[44:10] rather feel in my heart the presence of
[44:13] Christ that I feel now than to have the
[44:16] riches of this world I love him and it's
[44:19] wonderful how many can testify that I'd
[44:21] rather have his presence in my life I
[44:23] don't care I may not have my even my
[44:26] wants but as long as I've got Jesus
[44:30] then I've got everything
[44:32] I've got something that satisfies me
[44:35] when the flesh isn't satisfied I've got
[44:37] something that gives me joy when there's
[44:41] no me to give me joy I've got something
[44:43] that's greater than the circumstances
[44:46] around me because why I've got Jesus
[44:50] I'd rather have fill in my heart the
[44:52] presence of Christ that I feel now it
[44:55] goes on in another place he says oh he
[44:57] says if I got what I deserved I'd be
[45:00] walking I'd ride a bicycle or something
[45:03] that's I mean it from a heart I'd rather
[45:05] have favor with God than to have the
[45:08] best beautiful home you got in Chicago
[45:09] and be out of commission of God my main
[45:13] thing is to be in favor with God
[45:17] in another place brother bam is just
[45:19] coming up from speaking on a preceding
[45:21] quote where David has been criticized by
[45:24] uh his wife Michael for you know dancing
[45:27] when the ark was returning you know and
[45:30] and the rejoicing into Jerusalem and
[45:32] remember God closed her womb up because
[45:34] she was uh making fun of that and she
[45:37] was so ashamed of David but God has said
[45:40] David was a man after his own heart and
[45:42] brother Brandman goes on he says I'd
[45:44] rather have that than have all the
[45:45] popularity of women men or whoever it
[45:49] was on this Earth I'd rather have favor
[45:51] with God that God could say I got a
[45:55] servant I can put my finger on and he
[45:58] will believe me and he will trust me
[46:01] yeah how about you tonight I'd rather
[46:03] have that the world can have all they
[46:05] want I would rather have that than
[46:07] anything
[46:09] amen so when we look at this with with
[46:12] zofar here's one of you know the friends
[46:15] of Joe that has come and I tell you has
[46:19] these guys as it went on you begin to
[46:21] find that you know from that first seven
[46:24] days when they sat there and could not
[46:26] recognize job you begin to find as they
[46:29] go on it seems like they become more
[46:31] emboldened to speak and to say things
[46:35] and to try to interpret to job what's
[46:38] going on see job's got a question on his
[46:41] heart
[46:42] and job has a question and we want to
[46:45] look just a little bit more at that
[46:47] because remember job has spoke all the
[46:50] way through from earlier chapters old
[46:51] that there is one that could put his
[46:53] hand oh that there's one that could
[46:55] stand there although what's job longing
[46:58] for job's longing for someone to span
[47:01] the breach is there somebody that can
[47:03] bring about that place to where that I
[47:06] can hear from God I I just want to get
[47:08] in his presence that's all I
[47:11] is to get in his presence
[47:13] and here is so far you know this is all
[47:16] testing that's going on you know you
[47:19] would think that the testing itself was
[47:21] just that his children were taken and
[47:23] livestock and all the economy and the
[47:25] but but it's also job is affected in the
[47:28] social realm as well so far notice in
[47:31] verse 23 and I only read this to build a
[47:33] background here and again as you're
[47:35] grasping a hold of what these men are
[47:38] looking at and what these men really
[47:40] value
[47:41] when he is about to fill his belly this
[47:43] so far is talking about the wicked
[47:45] manner who's the hypocrite when he's
[47:47] about to fill his belly God shall pass
[47:49] the fury of his wrath upon him and shall
[47:52] reign in upon him while he's eating he
[47:54] shall flee from the iron weapon and the
[47:57] bow of steel shall strike him through it
[48:00] is drawn and cometh out of the body he
[48:02] ate the glittering sword cometh out of
[48:04] his Gall and Terrors are upon him all
[48:07] Darkness shall be hid in his secret
[48:09] places a fire not blown shall consume
[48:12] him and it shall go ill with him that is
[48:15] left in his Tabernacle the heavens shall
[48:17] reveal his iniquity and the Earth shall
[48:20] rise up against him the increase of his
[48:23] house shall depart and his Goods shall
[48:26] Flow Away in the day of his wrath hmm I
[48:30] wonder who they're trying to apply this
[48:31] to
[48:34] hmm you know they just they're just
[48:36] floating these Colts out there floating
[48:39] these scriptures out there hey they know
[48:41] exactly what they're trying to do with
[48:43] them
[48:45] you see this is something
[48:47] we don't want to be guilty of of
[48:49] listening to the word
[48:51] to debate it
[48:54] are you hearing me
[48:56] brother Brahm takes it up in the
[48:57] sardines I just feel to say it as it
[48:58] comes to me right here brother Branham
[49:00] takes it up in the sardisian age which
[49:02] is the age where we know the restoration
[49:04] uh through justification and brother
[49:06] Brown talks about the amount of truth
[49:08] that was released in that age he said it
[49:11] would it would have just started such a
[49:13] great thing and my what it would have
[49:15] turned into he said but men begin to
[49:18] study it not with the intent that it
[49:22] might become an outworking in their life
[49:25] but they gave themselves to it in order
[49:29] to debate it
[49:31] see the word of God is Not Meant to
[49:33] study that well I tell you when
[49:35] so-and-so comes with me I'm gonna
[49:37] no no no you that's wrong the word of
[49:40] God is what we give ourselves to
[49:43] yeah because the reality is is that
[49:45] God's never called you and I to debate
[49:49] as a matter of fact we've seen that in
[49:50] the prophet's life even he when brother
[49:53] Bosworth said let me go down there
[49:55] brother Brahm said no you're not going
[49:57] to do that and then finally when things
[50:00] were promised and we know what took
[50:01] place and how that brother Bosworth was
[50:03] able to stand there but I want you to
[50:05] understand that when when everything
[50:07] came about it was not within I I I
[50:11] believe this on my heart it was not with
[50:13] an intent to prove anything but I
[50:15] believe it was God in his grace that
[50:17] came and look how God showed up there in
[50:20] that particular meeting
[50:22] so if we want to look at what what's the
[50:24] results of it you know because there's
[50:26] things that I don't know about you but
[50:28] you know if God's God can you know we
[50:31] always want to be in this way that if
[50:33] there's something that we have to offer
[50:35] to somebody we want to be available if
[50:37] God secured it should choose to use us
[50:40] but remember brother Brandon would stand
[50:42] there at different times and remember
[50:43] brother Branham standing there and they
[50:46] were talking about you know the the man
[50:48] was talking about the missing link and
[50:49] brother Brahman 1965 standing outside
[50:51] the store and they looked at brother
[50:53] Branham and the man said well brother
[50:54] Brandon where's it at prove it where's
[50:56] it at where's it at brother Brown said I
[50:58] will stand there I was just thinking you
[50:59] know now think about it here's a man the
[51:02] prophet of God God who's preached the
[51:04] serpency he knows these things by the
[51:07] scripture right but now notice what the
[51:09] inspiration of the Holy Spirit tells him
[51:11] he said tell him it's right here
[51:14] and that's all he said it's right here
[51:16] and the man said oh now I see it so you
[51:19] realize it wasn't brother random sitting
[51:21] down with the Bible study that opened
[51:23] that man's understanding it was the
[51:24] inspiration of the holy spirit that was
[51:26] given by the favor of God that opened
[51:29] that man's understanding and that's what
[51:31] we're after is the favor of God
[51:33] well that was free
[51:37] verse 29 this is the portion of a wicked
[51:42] man from God and the Heritage appointed
[51:44] unto him by God
[51:46] these guys are so uplifting it's just
[51:49] unbearable
[51:52] I want you to notice in all of this we
[51:54] could keep on reading we could read the
[51:55] verses that go between it I want you to
[51:58] notice throughout everything that we
[52:00] have read even thus far from any of his
[52:03] friends nothing in itself focuses on the
[52:07] spiritual relationship between man and
[52:10] God
[52:11] everything that they have focused on is
[52:14] surface relationship
[52:17] everything they have focused on is
[52:20] temporal
[52:21] for the things of this world will pass
[52:24] away
[52:25] now if I can go ahead and make a
[52:26] statement brother Branham would let us
[52:28] know why they were approaching it that
[52:30] way is because they didn't know God any
[52:33] deeper than that
[52:35] they only knew God in a temporal way
[52:38] they didn't know him by that way of the
[52:41] revelation of the sacrifice so their
[52:44] focus everything the only thing they can
[52:46] see and focus upon is job your family's
[52:49] gone job the possessions are gone oh my
[52:53] job you know the signification you know
[52:55] that job you you evidently all of this
[52:57] is happening around you you're a
[52:59] hypocrite you're a wicked man no wonder
[53:02] joke could probably tell him tell me
[53:04] something else that's going to encourage
[53:05] me
[53:07] I mean my goodness with friends like you
[53:10] who needs friends
[53:12] right
[53:14] but job is being tested
[53:16] through these leveling of false
[53:18] accusations
[53:19] it's got right down to the nitty-gritty
[53:22] to his best buddies are accusing him
[53:26] the trial is getting right up very close
[53:30] and job has responded I want you to
[53:33] catch this with every one of these
[53:35] accusations that's been leveled they're
[53:37] they're wrongful applications he's
[53:40] responded yet they are they're
[53:43] undeterred these guys are unrelenting
[53:45] because they are accusing him of being a
[53:48] secret Sinner and God is permitting
[53:52] every accusation
[53:57] now why didn't God show up right now
[54:00] just like he did for Elijah on Mount
[54:03] Carmel
[54:04] Lord come visit Lord Lord come vindicate
[54:07] me God God ain't vindicating me God
[54:10] vindicates his word
[54:13] amen and God had already Vindicated his
[54:15] word now God could have showed up right
[54:17] there
[54:17] God could have spoked him but it's all
[54:19] part
[54:20] of the testing
[54:23] God is permitting all of that you know
[54:26] it it brings it brings this to a reality
[54:28] to every one of our hearts and we see
[54:30] this as we look at this with job it this
[54:33] is why it is important and we hear the
[54:37] Holy Spirit ring out through every
[54:39] service through every message it is
[54:42] important to know where we stand with
[54:45] God
[54:46] because test and trials are going to
[54:49] come
[54:49] but it's important to know before they
[54:52] get here where you stand with God
[54:55] that's where it's very important even in
[54:57] the hour that we are living in it's very
[55:00] important because the trial only
[55:02] declares what is real gold if it was
[55:06] gold before the trial it's gold during
[55:08] the trial and it'll be gold on the out
[55:11] on the after it comes out of it in other
[55:13] words gold does not start out gold and
[55:16] become Fool's Gold
[55:17] neither does fool's Golds turn out
[55:20] fool's gold and become real gold
[55:22] but whatever it is the trial itself only
[55:25] declares what's really there
[55:29] so you think about Abraham and lot
[55:31] brother Ram would give this example you
[55:33] know here was was you know lot with
[55:35] Abraham and knowing that that you know
[55:38] Abraham it should have been a complete
[55:40] separation there were some things that
[55:42] was really difficult for Abraham to
[55:45] separate from Abraham love lot he loved
[55:47] his daddy and no doubt his daddy would
[55:49] have still been there but remember his
[55:50] daddy passed away but God allowed a
[55:54] situation after they came out of Egypt
[55:56] that God allowed something to arise then
[56:00] Abraham knew there's got to be a
[56:03] separation let me just say this to you
[56:05] we recognize and God knows within our
[56:09] life that there are appointed moments
[56:11] that God knows that we must be brought
[56:15] to and he knows the choice that we will
[56:18] make he knows that choice and he brings
[56:21] us to that place like he brought Abraham
[56:24] where Abraham gave to lot and lot said
[56:27] I'm going to go down this way and
[56:30] Abraham said well you go that way I'll
[56:33] just go this way
[56:34] whichever way you want to go I'll go the
[56:36] opposite way why this is a Barren ground
[56:39] it wasn't a plenteous place as far as
[56:42] for their flocks remember there was
[56:44] contention among those who were keeping
[56:46] the herds and the flocks and that
[56:49] contention it brought about a time it's
[56:52] a time of decision because God could no
[56:55] longer deal any further with Abraham if
[56:58] he was still holding on to lot
[57:01] and see God God knows what he's doing
[57:04] and you know I think our brother Branham
[57:05] says that as you study it through the
[57:07] message that wasn't something that was
[57:10] easy upon
[57:11] Abraham that was his nephew
[57:15] that burdened him that he had to make
[57:17] the decision to go on without him
[57:21] but you see there was something within
[57:23] Abraham's life that he didn't put there
[57:26] there was a call in Abraham's life he
[57:30] didn't put there it was a God calling
[57:33] upon his life and God drawing upon his
[57:35] heart and Abraham stayed in the will of
[57:38] God and Abraham took the poor of the
[57:41] land while lot went down to where it was
[57:44] more Lush the Bible says that when he
[57:46] looked towards Sodom it said it looked
[57:50] as the Garden of Eden
[57:54] you know it just seemed like it's got to
[57:56] be right I mean it looks like Eden looks
[58:00] like and is is two different things
[58:04] and we understand what happened with the
[58:06] lot but I want to just read how brother
[58:08] Branham would say it in this manner
[58:10] brother Brian was talking about how that
[58:12] we want we want to be true to the word
[58:15] of God because when we think about of
[58:19] everything that so far and the others
[58:21] are saying they're putting it out as
[58:23] though that man I tell you if these
[58:25] things get taken from you know the
[58:27] Wickers only for a little bit and why
[58:28] they got their spoon in their mouth
[58:29] they're taking and everything else and
[58:31] job is looking at it and job is
[58:34] recognizing that ain't true
[58:37] that ain't true
[58:39] being America serving God isn't that
[58:42] everything's going to go my way
[58:45] serving God we've not been invited to a
[58:48] picnic
[58:49] that's not why we serve God we don't
[58:51] serve God because well if I serve God
[58:54] he's going to give me a good husband
[58:55] he's going to give me a good wife he's
[58:57] going to give me a good job he's going
[58:59] to give me your serving God for the
[59:01] wrong reason we don't serve God for what
[59:04] he can do for us we serve God because I
[59:07] want to surrender my life that what you
[59:10] might do through me oh God I don't want
[59:12] my way I don't want my will I don't want
[59:15] my own reasonings I don't want my own
[59:17] self any longer because it's me that has
[59:20] got me in the mess that I'm in right now
[59:24] come on Friends
[59:26] it'd been nobody else it's our own
[59:28] thinking our own doing and our own
[59:30] choices
[59:33] but God doesn't promise
[59:35] a flower bed of Eden
[59:38] don't falsify a Christian don't falsify
[59:41] the message by telling them everything's
[59:44] going to be all right there's going
[59:45] nothing's going to harm you there ain't
[59:47] gonna be no trials or nothing that's
[59:49] wrong a poet said must I be carried home
[59:53] to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While
[59:55] others fought to win the prize and sail
[59:58] through bloody Seas no sir God don't
[1:00:01] promise ease and prosperity but he
[1:00:03] promises Grace to endure in every trial
[1:00:07] it's the grace that we look to
[1:00:12] glory be to God
[1:00:15] that's what over think about what
[1:00:17] overwhelmed our hearts in the beginning
[1:00:21] was him
[1:00:23] it was him
[1:00:25] you don't look at home if I if you know
[1:00:28] am I first when you used to when God
[1:00:30] begins to deal with the heart and you
[1:00:32] think about oh what's my friends going
[1:00:33] to say
[1:00:34] maybe what's my husband or what's my
[1:00:36] wife or what's my associates well you
[1:00:38] might look at that and that and Satan
[1:00:39] can play upon that and bring fear
[1:00:41] towards you but if you just keep looking
[1:00:44] away to Jesus there's a strength that
[1:00:46] comes into your life I'm a witness of
[1:00:48] this I know what I'm talking about
[1:00:49] anybody else will witness you keep on
[1:00:52] looking to Jesus you find a strength
[1:00:54] because it's him that we are attracted
[1:00:58] to and we begin to realize all the rest
[1:01:01] of this stuff that is all around me this
[1:01:04] doesn't mean anything compared to
[1:01:07] serving the lord Jesus I want to give my
[1:01:09] life I want to surrender my all to him
[1:01:12] and we're recognizing he means more than
[1:01:15] everything
[1:01:18] I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:01:21] so what really matters
[1:01:24] what really matters
[1:01:26] I'll tell you what really matters
[1:01:28] it's a spiritual relationship and
[1:01:30] fellowship with the Lord
[1:01:31] that's what matters
[1:01:33] I'd rather have that than than anything
[1:01:35] in this world
[1:01:37] I'd rather have that
[1:01:39] those quotes that I read to you there
[1:01:41] from before brother Branham is
[1:01:43] referencing where he had been now this
[1:01:45] was back in the 1940s a man that is they
[1:01:49] they offered him a check worth a million
[1:01:52] and a half
[1:01:53] and brother Ben said I don't want that
[1:01:56] I don't want that
[1:01:58] he said I don't need that if I he said
[1:02:00] I'll tell you the truth he said God has
[1:02:02] supplied all my needs and when God sees
[1:02:04] that I have another need God Will Supply
[1:02:06] my needs
[1:02:09] you see it's not being tied to anything
[1:02:11] help me now
[1:02:12] help me now the enemy can try to set a
[1:02:15] track
[1:02:16] to try to get us tied to Earthly things
[1:02:20] but Earthly things will fade away just
[1:02:22] as our health Fades away
[1:02:25] just as our you know our youthfulness
[1:02:27] will fade away and we can be found
[1:02:29] giving our lives and spending our lives
[1:02:32] then all of a sudden we realize what in
[1:02:36] the world have I given my life to
[1:02:38] what have I been chasing
[1:02:40] and to think if you'd only Just
[1:02:42] Surrender God's Grace has been chasing
[1:02:45] you all along
[1:02:47] what really matters what really matters
[1:02:50] here
[1:02:51] you know in job 21 let's look here in in
[1:02:54] this first part of job 21. just for a
[1:02:58] few moments now job's going to answer
[1:03:00] this out of job 20 you know of what
[1:03:03] so far is saying and job answers and
[1:03:06] says
[1:03:07] here diligently my speech
[1:03:10] and let this be your consolations or
[1:03:12] your comforts
[1:03:14] suffer me that I may speak and after
[1:03:17] that I have spoken
[1:03:18] mock on
[1:03:20] as for me
[1:03:22] is my complaint to man in other words is
[1:03:24] my my meditations or my troubling is
[1:03:27] that with man if it were so why should
[1:03:31] not my spirit be troubled
[1:03:34] but but my my troubles are not with man
[1:03:38] or my complaint or my mind or my musings
[1:03:40] are not with man who's it with God
[1:03:45] not with man because you can you can
[1:03:48] dialogue with man right job remember job
[1:03:52] is Desiring to speak to God
[1:03:55] that's what he's been longing for hey if
[1:03:58] I can just get to him this will all be
[1:04:00] straightened out I understand
[1:04:06] how why doesn't God just give in
[1:04:11] why don't God just give in and say oh my
[1:04:14] goodness
[1:04:16] why why doesn't
[1:04:18] because God
[1:04:20] is bringing forth the qualities
[1:04:23] of a believer
[1:04:26] patience is coming out in the midst of
[1:04:29] this time
[1:04:30] you know the Bible says in James how
[1:04:32] many remember and James just says let
[1:04:34] patience have her
[1:04:37] perfect work
[1:04:39] notice not he is her perfect work so
[1:04:42] what is it it's submitting to the will
[1:04:44] of God just staying submitted to the
[1:04:46] word of Lord I don't know what all is
[1:04:48] going on but just staying submitted to
[1:04:50] him in the midst of all that time and as
[1:04:52] we're submitting to him what's happening
[1:04:53] let patience have her perfect work in
[1:04:57] our life
[1:04:58] God knows what he's doing
[1:05:01] is that right
[1:05:03] I mean
[1:05:04] let's just go on Mark me and be
[1:05:07] astonished and lay your hand upon your
[1:05:10] mouth even when I remember I am afraid
[1:05:13] and trembling taketh hold on my flesh
[1:05:18] now job
[1:05:20] he had heard God's voice
[1:05:22] speak to him
[1:05:25] job did not have
[1:05:27] an imaginary walk with God
[1:05:31] job had heard God's voice
[1:05:35] and so he had a real concern because he
[1:05:39] wasn't hearing from God
[1:05:41] and that that bothered him
[1:05:44] he wasn't hearing from him at all and
[1:05:47] this is why you know when Joe could say
[1:05:49] my complaint is not with man you see
[1:05:52] brother Brown would take us here and I
[1:05:54] have heard but now I see
[1:05:56] and he speaks of how that job was used
[1:05:59] to being a prophet of God he was used to
[1:06:03] receiving
[1:06:04] Divine communication from God
[1:06:07] brother Brian would place that as
[1:06:09] inspiration
[1:06:11] so when there were situations and things
[1:06:13] that would arise job had a contact with
[1:06:16] God and God would speak to him
[1:06:18] and job knew this is very important
[1:06:21] job note he had done all the mechanics
[1:06:26] in other words there was nothing in
[1:06:28] job's life that was out of order he was
[1:06:31] sure of that
[1:06:34] he knowed he knew he had done everything
[1:06:37] that God had called him to do but Samuel
[1:06:41] what are you saying I'm saying job knew
[1:06:43] where he was standing
[1:06:45] so when the accusations came Joe knew
[1:06:49] hey wait a minute I'm not out of God's
[1:06:53] plan
[1:06:54] I've done everything that he's asked me
[1:06:57] to do I have done the mechanics you know
[1:06:59] what the mechanics are That's The
[1:07:01] Written Letter
[1:07:02] if we can't do what's written the
[1:07:04] Dynamics will never come because the
[1:07:06] Dynamics come to make the mechanics
[1:07:08] alive the Dynamics do not come without
[1:07:11] the mechanics
[1:07:13] the Dynamics come to make the world live
[1:07:17] and sometimes when we have received the
[1:07:20] word or the mechanics and we've received
[1:07:22] the promise and said I I know that
[1:07:25] buying Stripes I'm Healed and here we
[1:07:27] are standing there and the report is
[1:07:30] even worse from the doctor what do I do
[1:07:32] keep standing there because the same
[1:07:35] inspiration that dropped in your heart
[1:07:37] that you are saved you are mine God will
[1:07:40] drop that same inspiration through the
[1:07:43] same Divine Channel you're healed
[1:07:47] Hallelujah
[1:07:51] hallelujah hallelujah I tell you that
[1:07:53] just makes me just
[1:07:55] oh it just does something to me
[1:07:57] Joe knew where he was standing
[1:08:00] see job when they came to him job would
[1:08:01] say I don't know
[1:08:03] you're right
[1:08:04] oh my goodness you're right the wicked
[1:08:07] you're right see they couldn't move him
[1:08:09] this isn't glorifying job understand
[1:08:11] this was not glorifying job Joe knew
[1:08:15] where he was standing with God
[1:08:18] that's why it's important we must know
[1:08:21] where we stand with God
[1:08:23] the Bible said we're in an evil day we
[1:08:25] need to stand in an evil day
[1:08:28] it's a time of standing and thank God
[1:08:30] God has provided the Revelation that is
[1:08:33] given to you and I of the baptism of the
[1:08:35] Holy Ghost that we can stand as our
[1:08:38] Christ is standing
[1:08:42] but the RAM talks about how he was such
[1:08:43] an honest Prophet before God the how
[1:08:47] everybody had such a confidence in him
[1:08:49] and we read that in few further chapters
[1:08:51] and but job lacked inspiration of what
[1:08:54] this was all about and God let it happen
[1:08:57] and didn't tell him hi anybody else ever
[1:09:00] been in that you don't know what's going
[1:09:02] on
[1:09:03] I don't know about you but I've been
[1:09:04] there I don't know what's going on the
[1:09:06] first guy I started looking at is this
[1:09:08] guy right here
[1:09:09] now you know even though I can look at
[1:09:11] myself I cannot overthrow the experience
[1:09:13] of God
[1:09:16] you can't overthrow it because listen
[1:09:18] the devil cannot overthrow it he can't
[1:09:21] break that seal
[1:09:23] are you with me you and I can look at
[1:09:25] ourselves and we should evaluate Our
[1:09:28] Lives remember the whole uh uh Bank of
[1:09:32] messages brother random preaches be
[1:09:34] certain of God he's spoken a number of
[1:09:36] times and he speaks to you and I be
[1:09:39] certain and once you're certain you know
[1:09:42] where you're standing then you can be
[1:09:44] certain of God because you know where
[1:09:46] you're standing with him
[1:09:48] oh glory be to God
[1:09:50] Hallelujah I don't know where I'm
[1:09:52] standing well it's a good time to get it
[1:09:54] fixed up
[1:09:55] it's a good time to settle it it ain't
[1:09:58] it ain't something to see how long you
[1:10:00] can make it go on it's God is here to
[1:10:02] bring about a real stand in our life
[1:10:05] notice as everybody think about it in
[1:10:07] this manner so when they want to think
[1:10:10] about it everybody he said as long as
[1:10:12] you can help them well all right then
[1:10:14] but when they want to disagree with you
[1:10:16] that's when trouble comes in you know I
[1:10:19] find it interesting brother Brian's
[1:10:21] preaching this in this series and this
[1:10:23] how I've heard by now see preaches
[1:10:24] invisible Union the bride of Christ on
[1:10:26] the wings of a snow white dove and I've
[1:10:28] heard this over and over had different
[1:10:29] Brothers even from brother brother Tim
[1:10:31] prude will tell it that even standing
[1:10:33] right there in that set of meetings you
[1:10:35] know that after brother Brandon preached
[1:10:37] the first first service there that
[1:10:39] brother Branham in that meeting they
[1:10:41] tried to come to his hotel you'll hear
[1:10:42] Brother am tell about it on tape of how
[1:10:44] that oh they're going to take me out for
[1:10:46] a steak today and you know what brother
[1:10:47] Jack just couldn't he seemed like he
[1:10:49] couldn't find my room and they went to
[1:10:50] the wrong room what it was they they
[1:10:52] were showing up to tell him we don't
[1:10:54] want you preaching no more in these
[1:10:56] meetings
[1:10:57] but God arranged it they could not find
[1:11:00] his hotel room
[1:11:02] and they never met up until brother
[1:11:04] Branham stood on the platform that night
[1:11:06] and the services went out now think
[1:11:08] about it now you have a background when
[1:11:10] you listen to works is Faith Express
[1:11:12] later on after this happens just you
[1:11:15] know a day or so and brother Bradham
[1:11:17] looks around on the platform that night
[1:11:18] he said well brother Brown and he begins
[1:11:20] to ident brother Jack remember them good
[1:11:22] old days old how it's precious to have
[1:11:24] real dear friends remember you're saying
[1:11:28] he knows what's all been going on he
[1:11:30] knows what's taking place you know what
[1:11:32] you said by the same man why do you say
[1:11:33] that I find it so fitty that right here
[1:11:36] in the midst of it that there is
[1:11:38] accusations that's going on they don't
[1:11:40] want to hear the message they don't want
[1:11:43] nothing to do with it it would like to
[1:11:45] shut brother ran him out but God knows
[1:11:47] these messages had to get out to you and
[1:11:50] I
[1:11:51] glory be to God and if God would see fit
[1:11:55] like that how much more right here
[1:11:57] tonight God knows the message that needs
[1:12:00] to get to you and I
[1:12:03] what are you saying nothing can defeat
[1:12:06] the purpose of God
[1:12:08] devil
[1:12:13] oh he said they want to disagree with
[1:12:15] you when trouble comes in
[1:12:17] but he alone knew he was right
[1:12:20] his pulsation of Faith he had heard God
[1:12:23] speak to him he knew it was a truth he
[1:12:26] knew God's voice nobody could fool him
[1:12:29] on it for he knew it
[1:12:30] he didn't know what was taking place
[1:12:32] around him but I know I heard God's
[1:12:33] voice and I know where I'm standing
[1:12:36] and I ain't no secret sinner
[1:12:38] I ain't no hypocrite
[1:12:40] I ain't a wicked man
[1:12:42] I know
[1:12:43] I know where I'm standing with God I
[1:12:45] know I have met God's requirements
[1:12:50] Bram says everything something was wrong
[1:12:54] he said job he couldn't get inspiration
[1:12:57] I wonder if job was probably like us
[1:13:00] he couldn't get inspiration oh John was
[1:13:02] praying he was going on and looking Lord
[1:13:05] I just need inspiration I Lord I need to
[1:13:08] hear from you and maybe you know he'd
[1:13:10] walk out a little bit or walk over here
[1:13:11] I don't know but he was doing whatever
[1:13:13] if I can just get in contact with him
[1:13:16] what your brother Brown says this he
[1:13:18] says he couldn't get inspiration on him
[1:13:20] and it was worrying him
[1:13:22] I think that's a good thing
[1:13:24] I think it's a good thing if we haven't
[1:13:26] heard from God in a while it ought to
[1:13:28] worry us
[1:13:29] right it ought not be all he'll be there
[1:13:31] when I when I feel like picking up his
[1:13:32] call when I feel like going there and
[1:13:34] hearing from him he'll be there
[1:13:36] be careful
[1:13:38] be careful because if it don't mean no
[1:13:40] more to you than that then the Rapture
[1:13:41] itself doesn't mean anything to you the
[1:13:44] Rapture does not change our appetite the
[1:13:47] Rapture is not something
[1:13:53] something to be around no the way you
[1:13:55] are here right now this moment is how
[1:13:58] you would be over there
[1:14:00] are you hearing me death does not change
[1:14:02] us
[1:14:04] and it should worry us it should bother
[1:14:07] us if we haven't heard from God in a
[1:14:10] while
[1:14:14] had a brother when I was ministering
[1:14:16] and said where was that but I was
[1:14:18] ministering and one of the ministers
[1:14:19] pulled me off a side after I'd spread
[1:14:21] them speaking some of the some of the
[1:14:23] messages so I'd like to speak to him
[1:14:25] again to you know speak about some
[1:14:27] things you know and it was kind of like
[1:14:28] in this manner you know in their life
[1:14:30] and begin to talk and I'm just waiting
[1:14:32] on the Lord and looking to it and one of
[1:14:33] the things that brother shared with me
[1:14:35] and I've heard others repeat it to me as
[1:14:37] where before the brother random somebody
[1:14:38] came to brother random and the one time
[1:14:40] and and you know they were talking about
[1:14:42] and brother Graham was asking you know
[1:14:43] when they had been praying and brother
[1:14:45] Branham you know said to him and said
[1:14:46] that's wonderful he says if next time
[1:14:49] you talk to him tell him I love him
[1:14:50] because it's been a month
[1:14:52] it's been a while since I've heard from
[1:14:54] him
[1:14:55] well it got quiet didn't it now I don't
[1:14:58] have that on a quote and I'm not
[1:15:00] preaching an idea that to me is
[1:15:02] something that's so hard for me to even
[1:15:04] fathom
[1:15:06] it's hard to even think of it in that
[1:15:07] way because I know that brother Branham
[1:15:10] heard from God now however long of that
[1:15:13] time it was they're still trying times
[1:15:15] that comes our way and in our life
[1:15:19] sometimes to where God remains silent
[1:15:21] and you realize God was silent when it
[1:15:24] came to the Hebrew children he waited
[1:15:26] until they got in the furnace and then
[1:15:30] God answered the same way he always
[1:15:32] answers and that's by showing up
[1:15:36] sometimes God remains silent
[1:15:39] to just test our reaction to how things
[1:15:42] are going to be
[1:15:44] oh glory be to God
[1:15:47] I just think it's just an example to
[1:15:49] place in with this notice it was
[1:15:51] worrying him and when you get in that
[1:15:52] kind of a fix then every enemy moves
[1:15:56] into every friend nearly that you've got
[1:15:58] and they begin to accuse him oh it must
[1:16:01] have been a miserable thing for him to
[1:16:04] know his friends
[1:16:06] had accused him
[1:16:08] my friends
[1:16:12] his friends were accusing him
[1:16:16] who was that
[1:16:18] Satan
[1:16:19] joined himself with the Enemy
[1:16:22] Satan had come in and said let me have
[1:16:25] him I'll make him curse you to his face
[1:16:26] I'll make him deny his message I'll make
[1:16:30] him curse you I'll make him go back and
[1:16:31] say it was all wrong
[1:16:33] then he tried with everything he could
[1:16:35] to to all the great men and the friends
[1:16:38] that he used to have but I like this but
[1:16:40] job stood flat-footed for he knew he had
[1:16:44] heard God's voice
[1:16:47] glory be to God I know I've heard God's
[1:16:50] voice I may not know what's going on
[1:16:52] right now but I know I heard his voice
[1:16:54] and I know what he's revealed this far
[1:16:56] if I walk in the lattice he's in the
[1:16:58] light then more light will unfold and so
[1:17:00] far I am walking in the light that he
[1:17:03] has opened to me
[1:17:05] job had that confidence like Enoch where
[1:17:08] Enoch could say I am walking in all that
[1:17:11] God has made known to me
[1:17:14] you understand if you're not walking in
[1:17:16] all that God is open then don't expect
[1:17:18] anything more from God
[1:17:20] are you hearing me now oh Lord Jesus I'm
[1:17:23] really one the Holy Ghost you got to
[1:17:25] walk
[1:17:26] you got to walk towards God
[1:17:29] you got to yield to his drawing Lord I
[1:17:31] really want I really want more of you do
[1:17:33] you if you really want more of God yield
[1:17:36] to him
[1:17:37] obey him you don't Bane obeying is the
[1:17:40] simplest and greatest thing that we you
[1:17:43] and I can do and in order for us to obey
[1:17:45] it requires death to ourself
[1:17:49] that's the truth
[1:17:51] oh my we want God to move we've got to
[1:17:55] the Bible says draw nigh unto God and He
[1:17:58] will draw nigh unto you
[1:18:03] look at this in job 21 7. wherefore do
[1:18:07] the wicked Live Now watch how job's
[1:18:09] answering this question because remember
[1:18:11] they're talking about the wicked and how
[1:18:13] they are and everything's wiped and
[1:18:14] wiped off in verse 7 wherefore do the
[1:18:17] wicked live become old yea and are
[1:18:19] Mighty in power
[1:18:21] wow this is blowing away their concept
[1:18:24] whatsoever because if they're Wicked and
[1:18:26] their Mighty God just strips everything
[1:18:28] right away from them right here and job
[1:18:31] says no
[1:18:33] God will let the wicked go ahead and
[1:18:35] continue to increase increase increase
[1:18:37] increase increase
[1:18:43] in contrast to what zofar has said in
[1:18:46] verse 10. here's what zofar says his
[1:18:48] children shall seek to please the poor
[1:18:51] and His Hands shall restore their goods
[1:18:53] in other words what he has done through
[1:18:55] deceit and deception his children will
[1:18:58] be servants to the poor
[1:19:00] his bones are full of the sin of his
[1:19:02] youth which shall lie down with him in
[1:19:06] the dust
[1:19:07] and what did job say to that wherefore
[1:19:10] do the wicked live
[1:19:12] become old yea
[1:19:14] our Mighty in power
[1:19:16] as a matter of fact
[1:19:17] they might have less arthritis than what
[1:19:20] the righteous do
[1:19:22] they might have a better bill of health
[1:19:24] than what the righteous do
[1:19:26] everything is so much better
[1:19:29] than the righteous
[1:19:32] are you with me
[1:19:35] job he's presenting you know a question
[1:19:38] of Truth he's asking them you know when
[1:19:39] God asks the question it's for us to
[1:19:41] think about for a moment like when Jesus
[1:19:43] said who do you say that I am he didn't
[1:19:46] want they didn't need to tell him as
[1:19:47] though he didn't know he's asking a
[1:19:49] question to cause them to think
[1:19:51] this is an important moment of
[1:19:53] reflection
[1:19:55] notice when he goes on to say in verse 8
[1:19:57] and 21 verse 8 this is job their seed is
[1:20:01] established in their sight with them and
[1:20:04] their offspring Before Their Eyes in
[1:20:06] other words their seed line it continues
[1:20:09] to prosper and go on and propagate and
[1:20:12] continue to move forth this is what the
[1:20:14] mighty in power does
[1:20:16] this is what the wicked does but you see
[1:20:19] in the minds of zofar in them they're
[1:20:22] looking at just things in the natural
[1:20:26] that the natural man all he who's Wicked
[1:20:29] and a hypocrite this man that is so rich
[1:20:32] and his Wicked his offspring is just
[1:20:35] killed off God said through job no it's
[1:20:37] quite the contrary matter of fact the
[1:20:39] wicked seed they flourish
[1:20:43] they propagate they're established
[1:20:46] throughout the Earth
[1:20:48] right hello
[1:20:51] but look at this in contrast here's
[1:20:54] contrast to bill down Bill Dad actually
[1:20:56] in job 18 had actually said some things
[1:20:59] as well this is building not so far
[1:21:00] sorry he shall have neither speaking of
[1:21:03] the wicked or the rich man he shall have
[1:21:05] neither son nor nephew among his people
[1:21:08] nor any remaining in his dwellings
[1:21:11] let's say what is this all about if job
[1:21:14] didn't know where he was standing
[1:21:18] but job knew where he was standing
[1:21:21] because job did not live a life even
[1:21:24] though job had wealth job had cattle job
[1:21:27] had that but job stock was not in that
[1:21:31] job was not resting in that job was not
[1:21:34] looking at his cattle and his houses and
[1:21:37] his Retreat and his business and his
[1:21:39] this is praise God glory to God look at
[1:21:42] all this God is blessing me
[1:21:44] job
[1:21:46] never rested
[1:21:48] on temporal things
[1:21:51] because you know why they can flee
[1:21:54] as quick as they come
[1:21:59] job is letting him know what you're
[1:22:01] looking at and the confidence that you
[1:22:05] would have in your own cells the
[1:22:08] confidence you would have well I'm a
[1:22:09] righteous guy I'm doing pretty good
[1:22:11] everything's good with me so man my
[1:22:13] house is going to stay in order and this
[1:22:15] and that and that job's letting them
[1:22:16] know let this be for your consolations
[1:22:19] he's helping them to see that this in
[1:22:22] itself what you are thinking that is a
[1:22:24] wicked man a hypocrite his richest flea
[1:22:28] that's not true
[1:22:33] verse 9.
[1:22:35] job's response
[1:22:37] remember this is about the mighty and
[1:22:39] power their houses
[1:22:41] are safe
[1:22:43] from Fear
[1:22:45] think about it
[1:22:46] they're not they're not
[1:22:48] they're not they're not trembling it's
[1:22:49] amazing David writes of this in his
[1:22:51] homes I can't get to it tonight but
[1:22:53] David writes of this of how that there
[1:22:55] are people not even serving God but are
[1:22:58] not even fearful
[1:23:00] whatsoever
[1:23:02] no trembling whatsoever and there's
[1:23:05] things here and you and I are down on
[1:23:06] our needs Lord in this storm let the
[1:23:08] electric stay on Lord
[1:23:12] right
[1:23:14] I'm not ashamed to admit it
[1:23:17] their houses are safe from Fear neither
[1:23:21] is the rod of God
[1:23:23] upon them
[1:23:26] wow
[1:23:27] so what job is letting us know
[1:23:30] they're without chastisement
[1:23:33] they're without correction he's talking
[1:23:35] about the wicked and Power
[1:23:36] they get no correction
[1:23:38] Mighty and power they they everything's
[1:23:41] at ease there's no fear in their
[1:23:42] household their seeds is propagating
[1:23:45] through the Earth and they're not just
[1:23:47] getting wiped out oh they're Wicked in
[1:23:49] that case they'd have to wipe out all
[1:23:51] Congress all Senate they'd have to wipe
[1:23:52] out Washington DC have to wipe out the
[1:23:54] world is that right yeah
[1:23:56] yeah that's true they'd have to wipe out
[1:23:58] I'll tell you what it'd be pretty scarce
[1:23:59] right it'd be easy to get home tonight
[1:24:01] on the way home you wouldn't have to
[1:24:02] worry about traffic
[1:24:03] but God allows it to go on
[1:24:08] God allows it to go on
[1:24:11] he allows the wicked to go on their seed
[1:24:13] to be established
[1:24:16] oh my
[1:24:18] think about this but neither is the rod
[1:24:21] of God upon them let me just descend on
[1:24:23] this point
[1:24:25] what a blessing it is
[1:24:28] that God would deal with us
[1:24:30] as sons and daughters
[1:24:34] I'm glad that the rod of God is upon us
[1:24:38] I'm glad he corrects us as a faithful
[1:24:40] father I'm glad about that
[1:24:42] I'm grateful for that I'd rather have
[1:24:44] his correcting hand upon my life you
[1:24:47] know why because he loves me
[1:24:49] he chastens me he reproves me he rebukes
[1:24:53] me because he loves me you see God knows
[1:24:57] what he's placed inside of you and I
[1:25:01] can I read this real quick out of
[1:25:02] Hebrews 12. I'm just going to skip it
[1:25:04] but I feel just to read it have you
[1:25:06] forgotten the exhortation with speakers
[1:25:08] to you as unto children my son despise
[1:25:10] now not the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:25:13] faint when thou art rebuked of him now
[1:25:15] remember job's not being chastened
[1:25:18] job's not being rebuked
[1:25:21] job's being approved by God
[1:25:25] who some are proving isn't it
[1:25:30] he's not being chased
[1:25:32] but job is letting him know that the
[1:25:34] wicked they don't have no correction
[1:25:36] coming their way
[1:25:38] I mean unless they belong to God but on
[1:25:40] the contrary it just looks like man
[1:25:42] they're getting by with this getting by
[1:25:43] with that getting by with this man they
[1:25:46] can get by with this they can get by
[1:25:47] with that
[1:25:50] but for me the least little thing I'm
[1:25:53] corrected thank you Lord
[1:25:56] you know the difference they're being
[1:25:58] prepared for fire you're being prepared
[1:26:01] in the fire for Glory
[1:26:05] Hebrews 12 6 for whom the Lord loveth
[1:26:08] chasteneth
[1:26:09] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:26:12] receiveth if ye endure chastening God
[1:26:16] dealing with you as with sons for what
[1:26:18] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:26:20] but if you be without chastisement
[1:26:22] whereof all our partakers then you are
[1:26:25] bastards and not Sons furthermore we've
[1:26:28] had fathers of our flesh which corrected
[1:26:30] us and we gave them reverence shall we
[1:26:32] not much rather be in subjection unto
[1:26:34] the father of spirits and live for they
[1:26:36] verily for a few days chastened us after
[1:26:39] their own pleasure I know sometimes it
[1:26:41] seemed like eternity but anyhow just for
[1:26:43] a few days but he for our Prophet that
[1:26:46] we might be partakers of his holiness
[1:26:49] now no chastening for the present
[1:26:51] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[1:26:54] anybody ever enjoyed getting a weapon
[1:26:57] I I don't enjoy getting whipping I never
[1:26:59] did
[1:27:00] you know I made sure I tell my dad and
[1:27:02] all that I'll never do it again I
[1:27:03] promise Daddy I promise that I know I
[1:27:05] know
[1:27:08] you're gonna make sure that I hold that
[1:27:09] promise I'd have something to help me in
[1:27:11] memory that I'd remember that promise
[1:27:13] that I made
[1:27:15] and then the thing that my daddy made me
[1:27:16] do after he gave me a whipping
[1:27:18] everything I hated the most was more
[1:27:19] than a whip and I hated taking a nap
[1:27:22] oh I was going to miss out on the day I
[1:27:24] hated taking a nap that was probably the
[1:27:26] worst thing nevertheless afterward it
[1:27:29] yielded the peaceful fruit of
[1:27:30] righteousness unto them which are
[1:27:32] exercised thereby
[1:27:34] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[1:27:36] down and the feeble knees
[1:27:38] and make straight paths for your feet
[1:27:40] less which is lame should be turned out
[1:27:42] of the way and let it be healed
[1:27:44] think about how
[1:27:46] brother random places this and I'm
[1:27:48] I'm closing just on this point
[1:27:52] God out of the same lump of humanity
[1:27:54] because all Humanity's taken out of the
[1:27:56] same lump
[1:27:58] but yet out of that lump God has chosen
[1:28:02] vessels unto honor
[1:28:04] vessels that he would show his Mercy
[1:28:09] because God already knows what he's
[1:28:11] placed remember you know I'm referring
[1:28:13] to Romans chapter 9 God already knows
[1:28:17] who is his that's what Redemption is all
[1:28:19] about he's come to get
[1:28:21] what rightfully belongs to him
[1:28:24] and so out of this lump of clay God will
[1:28:28] take and have vessels remember Pharaoh
[1:28:30] is a vessel Of Dishonor Moses was a
[1:28:33] vessel of Honor and God molds him out of
[1:28:36] that lump of clay
[1:28:37] and brother Branham makes this statement
[1:28:39] he said then those chosen ones born of
[1:28:41] his spirit will be trained to conform to
[1:28:44] his image in their walk aren't you glad
[1:28:46] for that training
[1:28:48] I'm glad for that molding I'm glad for
[1:28:50] that shaping
[1:28:51] oh brother Samuel oh the the wicked have
[1:28:54] it so easy but they won't
[1:28:57] they won't right now it's a blessing
[1:29:00] that God would correct me
[1:29:02] it's a blessing that God would speak to
[1:29:05] my heart and remember how correction
[1:29:06] comes correction isn't always with
[1:29:09] you know where there's you know
[1:29:12] blessed contact sometimes correction
[1:29:15] itself is where it stood up and it's
[1:29:17] just spoken
[1:29:18] you know
[1:29:20] next time you approach this don't don't
[1:29:22] do it this way do it like that
[1:29:25] but you know sometimes some of us we
[1:29:27] just had to test it out
[1:29:30] and we didn't remember what we were
[1:29:32] admonished in the correction on what we
[1:29:34] were supposed to do with the sink and so
[1:29:36] forth and so we didn't correct ourselves
[1:29:39] and so Grace came
[1:29:42] yeah to correct us oh yeah Daddy meant
[1:29:46] what he said Mama meant what he said and
[1:29:47] so then the next time we come to the
[1:29:49] sink or whatever it is what do we do we
[1:29:51] make straight paths for our feet
[1:29:54] what do we do we heed to that correction
[1:29:57] that was given
[1:29:59] now think about how we're trained
[1:30:00] brother Brown said he reproves with all
[1:30:03] long-suffering gentleness and mercy he
[1:30:05] chastens with nail scarred hands and
[1:30:07] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:30:09] vessel he's working on and thoroughly
[1:30:11] break it down in order that he may
[1:30:12] rebuild it just exactly as he desires it
[1:30:16] I think about their song I'm so glad He
[1:30:18] Didn't Throw the Clay Away
[1:30:20] I'm glad when there's times that in my
[1:30:22] life that there's had to be some
[1:30:23] remoulding I'm glad that he didn't throw
[1:30:25] it all away
[1:30:26] I'm glad that he just I'm right there on
[1:30:28] the wheel and you know we're on the
[1:30:30] potter's wheel you know what you got to
[1:30:31] have in order when you look at him
[1:30:33] working with that clay and things like
[1:30:34] that they got to keep dipping their hand
[1:30:36] in water the Holy Spirit keeps drawing
[1:30:38] nine in his hands is working in our life
[1:30:40] and what's it doing it's all bringing
[1:30:42] forth a very image of Jesus Christ in
[1:30:45] our life
[1:30:46] we're on the potter's wheel he's molding
[1:30:49] us with male scarred hands what he
[1:30:51] purchased for you and I that that
[1:30:54] purchase that was made that our lives
[1:30:56] might be conformed to his image
[1:30:59] think about this
[1:31:01] think about the grace of God
[1:31:03] that's provided through the word of God
[1:31:05] that the Holy Spirit would come
[1:31:08] and would take upon
[1:31:10] the spirit of man which is a candle of
[1:31:12] the Lord and the Holy Spirit would take
[1:31:14] a hold of that that candle and begin to
[1:31:16] shine it through our lives
[1:31:18] when there's things that we've looked at
[1:31:20] or maybe we've made excuses for things
[1:31:22] that God's dealt with our hearts are but
[1:31:24] how the holy spirit will take that
[1:31:25] candle of our spirit and shine through
[1:31:27] our lives oh
[1:31:30] and what's he doing it's Grace provided
[1:31:33] to you and I
[1:31:34] that we might want that our lives
[1:31:37] would be corrected and lined up with him
[1:31:40] you see God's Got Confidence in his word
[1:31:44] there's things that we might look at and
[1:31:46] say oh I don't think that's really that
[1:31:48] important then God just gets a hold of
[1:31:50] and begins to shine right through our
[1:31:51] life and we say oh that really does
[1:31:54] matter doesn't it
[1:31:56] it really matters
[1:31:58] asparagus
[1:32:01] I believe that's what job is
[1:32:04] letting us know here
[1:32:06] the blessedness of the rod of God
[1:32:08] because it's a scepter of authority
[1:32:10] we're Guided by it and we passed under
[1:32:13] it
[1:32:14] that's why the Bible says for if we
[1:32:15] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:32:17] judged
[1:32:18] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:32:20] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:32:21] condemned
[1:32:23] with the world
[1:32:27] I want you to think of this as our heads
[1:32:29] are bowed thank god brother Brown would
[1:32:30] make this statement
[1:32:32] he said the only thing I want to have
[1:32:34] when I die is favor with God that's all
[1:32:37] I want
[1:32:38] I've brought nothing into the world and
[1:32:39] it's certain we can take nothing out
[1:32:41] so what we get from the line of God
[1:32:45] is the only thing we can take with us
[1:32:47] so if you ever want to pray for me
[1:32:50] it's not to have money not to have big
[1:32:53] homes or to be popular
[1:32:55] but just pray that I can stay in the
[1:32:57] hands of Christ
[1:32:58] that he'll mold the clay that he can
[1:33:00] mold me and use me any way that he sees
[1:33:03] fit to do
[1:33:05] I'm going to say Lord that's my prayer
[1:33:08] I'm not after the things of this Earth
[1:33:10] Lord that decision has been made Lord
[1:33:13] You've drawn my heart I just want to be
[1:33:14] molded more
[1:33:16] and more Lord
[1:33:17] to reflect you let me stay in a place
[1:33:20] Lord that you can use me
[1:33:23] a place Lord that you can speak Lord to
[1:33:25] my heart God bless your hands my hand is
[1:33:27] up Lord that's my prayer let me stay in
[1:33:30] that place Lord
[1:33:32] let me stay there
[1:33:33] what a contrast to what so far
[1:33:37] and those on the surface level have
[1:33:39] looked at just surface level things
[1:33:41] there's not one thing they have brought
[1:33:43] up about the relationship and fellowship
[1:33:47] with God and for job
[1:33:50] all those things it troubled him it hurt
[1:33:53] it hurt that family and everything but
[1:33:55] What mattered most to job
[1:33:58] more than anything was his Fellowship
[1:34:01] with God
[1:34:03] got to hear from him so while they were
[1:34:07] looking at the Natural Things of Life
[1:34:08] job his Focus was on the spiritual
[1:34:15] I want to talk to him
[1:34:17] that's what matters most to me
[1:34:21] let's pray
[1:34:22] Heavenly Father
[1:34:25] Lord Jesus tonight
[1:34:28] we thank you Lord for your grace Lord
[1:34:35] Lord I think of job's life and Lord
[1:34:38] where he's at over and over it continues
[1:34:40] to declare itself
[1:34:44] the Lord Jesus
[1:34:46] job by the grace of God
[1:34:48] he knew where he was standing this was
[1:34:50] not his mind it was not his natural mind
[1:34:52] but Lord it was that Revelation in his
[1:34:54] heart
[1:34:56] it shows and declares just how
[1:34:58] prevailing the power is of divine
[1:35:01] revelation Lord
[1:35:03] father I pray Lord that if there's one
[1:35:06] Lord that doesn't have that Assurance
[1:35:07] tonight Lord may they move to that place
[1:35:10] with you Lord may they yield to your
[1:35:12] drawing your desire to bring a real
[1:35:15] stand a real Joy a real Fellowship a
[1:35:18] real Assurance in their life Lord God
[1:35:21] I pray father Grant it Lord if there's
[1:35:24] things the Lord that have if there's
[1:35:26] things that's God in the way and now
[1:35:28] Lord through father has the word would
[1:35:30] speak to our hearts and we realize this
[1:35:33] is what really matters
[1:35:35] Lord we can give ourselves to all the
[1:35:38] things of this Earth we can expend
[1:35:41] ourselves Lord God so greatly and at the
[1:35:45] end of the day Lord God though we might
[1:35:48] Lord have more but where is our walk
[1:35:52] with you Lord
[1:35:54] Lord when everything comes down to it
[1:35:56] when it comes down to it what really
[1:35:59] matters Lord
[1:36:01] now Lord that's only a question
[1:36:04] that every one of us Lord has to
[1:36:06] personally be able to take and to be
[1:36:09] able to answer and to reflect upon
[1:36:12] Lord we appreciate we enjoy those things
[1:36:15] that God that you have
[1:36:18] allowed us to be able to have
[1:36:21] but by no means
[1:36:22] are those the things Lord God that bring
[1:36:25] us
[1:36:26] Joy we enjoy them but Lord without you
[1:36:31] what good would it be
[1:36:34] what good would it be Lord God for us to
[1:36:36] have a house or a car if we didn't have
[1:36:37] the peace of God
[1:36:39] I wouldn't want it I don't care what it
[1:36:41] is Lord if I don't have the peace of God
[1:36:44] within it Lord I don't want it because
[1:36:46] the whole part that allows me to enjoy
[1:36:48] those things or any of us is because of
[1:36:51] the Peace of almighty God
[1:36:54] Lord Jesus it's your fellowship
[1:36:57] that's what really matters
[1:37:00] that's what matters more to us than
[1:37:02] anything Lord
[1:37:04] I pray tonight Lord God may you just
[1:37:07] Lord Minister Lord and strengthen as you
[1:37:09] have been through the service Lord
[1:37:11] that God is we can think of that I would
[1:37:14] rather have the Divine favor of God I
[1:37:17] would rather have Lord
[1:37:19] the walk with you I would rather have
[1:37:22] that Joy I would rather have that
[1:37:24] Comfort Lord than to have all the
[1:37:27] Comforts of this Earth Lord
[1:37:29] I would rather have that more than
[1:37:32] anything else
[1:37:34] because the Lord all of those things
[1:37:35] like James says they will become moth
[1:37:39] eaten that kind of gold will corrupt all
[1:37:43] of those things like that can flee away
[1:37:45] so quickly
[1:37:48] God help us Lord
[1:37:50] help us Lord that our lives would be
[1:37:52] invested
[1:37:54] in what really matters for it
[1:37:58] what really matters is Lord God you what
[1:38:02] really matters Lord May Our Lives Lord
[1:38:05] be dedicated to you father so fully Lord
[1:38:09] forgive us Lord if the things Lord that
[1:38:11] we've allowed to get in the way Lord
[1:38:13] Jesus
[1:38:14] help us Lord maybe it's an opinion about
[1:38:17] something we've allowed to get in the
[1:38:19] way of a relationship between us and
[1:38:21] somebody else what really matters our
[1:38:24] opinion
[1:38:25] or a relationship
[1:38:27] what really matters
[1:38:29] oh God help us Lord
[1:38:31] search us I pray Lord God
[1:38:34] Lord how we thank you Father for the
[1:38:37] molding and the shaping that you bring
[1:38:39] Lord our way
[1:38:41] Lord we know we have a confidence we are
[1:38:45] not being prepared
[1:38:47] for the Lake of Fire oh no oh no we are
[1:38:51] being prepared we are being shaped we
[1:38:54] are being molded Lord right here in this
[1:38:57] moment
[1:38:58] that Lord God
[1:39:00] for the glory
[1:39:01] that shall be revealed in US Lord
[1:39:05] help us Lord to ever remain true and
[1:39:07] faithful Lord
[1:39:09] help us Lord God to remain in your favor
[1:39:12] Lord I pray
[1:39:14] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:24] and listen if you'd like to stand
[1:39:26] amen don't you love him
[1:39:29] just appreciate him tonight
[1:39:33] oh thank you Lord
[1:39:41] have Jesus
[1:39:44] then silver
[1:39:47] or gold
[1:39:50] I'd rather than
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] to have richest
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:05] am I Jesus
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:14] I'd rather
[1:40:17] be like
[1:40:19] led by his name
[1:40:24] piercing that should be
[1:40:29] the king of the
[1:40:33] vast soul mate
[1:40:37] or to be here
[1:40:40] is
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:51] my Jesus
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:41:00] this world
[1:41:04] affords today
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:19] hands of Love Yes Lord I'd rather
[1:41:25] be faithful to his dear cause
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:43] oh I'd rather I'd rather be true too
[1:41:49] thless
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:42:00] of the best way
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:13] oh
[1:42:15] I'd rather
[1:42:18] am I jesus
[1:42:21] than any thing
[1:42:26] for this world
[1:42:29] can't
[1:42:30] afford to
[1:42:33] death and to be the king than to be
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:42] foreign
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:43:10] can't afford
[1:43:13] today
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:19] aren't you glad that he just don't let
[1:43:20] us get by with anything
[1:43:23] you know for us as as Believers when we
[1:43:26] look at things
[1:43:28] we don't look at God as being nitpicky
[1:43:30] but as for a believer
[1:43:32] I think our brother Brandon would say it
[1:43:34] in another place in the message he said
[1:43:35] I would rather be in favor with God
[1:43:40] that I can be an instrument he said
[1:43:42] that's what I'm trying to be it's an
[1:43:44] instrument that he can use
[1:43:48] I'd rather be in favor with God
[1:43:52] I don't want anything between that
[1:43:54] relationship between he and I it just
[1:43:56] don't it's it's something that don't set
[1:43:58] right how many know what I'm talking
[1:43:59] about there's something that just don't
[1:44:01] set right it might be something that
[1:44:03] maybe
[1:44:03] maybe you said the right words but maybe
[1:44:06] it was just
[1:44:08] the motive behind it or the tenor that
[1:44:10] you know in here and it's just something
[1:44:12] about it how blessed that is
[1:44:15] how blessed that there's that which
[1:44:17] Rises up the wicked can go on the
[1:44:20] hypocrite can go on but there's
[1:44:21] something inside of your heart that
[1:44:24] rises up why is that
[1:44:26] because of the love of God
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:30] the desire I desire him more than
[1:44:34] anything I desire his favor
[1:44:37] well I'll tell you tonight you're
[1:44:38] blessed tonight
[1:44:41] brother Samuel should I not have
[1:44:42] Ambitions for this no that's not what it
[1:44:44] was saying at all but what it's saying
[1:44:46] is you know what sometimes sometimes
[1:44:49] people can become Soul Our Lives can
[1:44:52] become to where we become focused on the
[1:44:54] wrong things
[1:44:56] you realize Israel you know how Israel
[1:44:58] got into a place where they were serving
[1:44:59] the sun god they started doing all that
[1:45:01] brother Brahm tells us in Christianity
[1:45:03] versus idolatry they got away from God
[1:45:05] little by little by little by little by
[1:45:07] little by little and then they couldn't
[1:45:09] figure out why were crops drying up why
[1:45:12] didn't everything turning out like God
[1:45:14] promised in Deuteronomy 28 man
[1:45:16] everything's failing you know what we
[1:45:17] need to do we need to find the god of
[1:45:20] fertility
[1:45:21] and that's why they went and started
[1:45:22] worshiping bowel
[1:45:24] you know what it is
[1:45:26] Satan slowly puts a trap
[1:45:28] and it can drift
[1:45:30] drift drift drift why aren't things
[1:45:33] turning out the way they should
[1:45:36] that's where we have to stop and say
[1:45:37] Lord am I lined up with you
[1:45:40] because if we're lined up with him this
[1:45:42] is what he promised if you'll seek me
[1:45:43] first in my kingdom than all the other
[1:45:46] things shall be added to you what you
[1:45:48] have need of I'll see to it it's in your
[1:45:50] disposal why God knows what he can
[1:45:52] entrust even you and I with and he'll
[1:45:54] entrust it
[1:45:55] in due time
[1:45:58] because you know why that our Focus
[1:46:01] still doesn't change
[1:46:03] our Focus still looks to Lord You're My
[1:46:05] Everything
[1:46:06] you're my everything
[1:46:09] You're My All In All you're the desire
[1:46:10] You're the Reason
[1:46:13] you're the reason I live if you've given
[1:46:15] me life
[1:46:16] you're more than life to me this this
[1:46:19] Joy like Paul I think you were singing
[1:46:21] This Joy that I have
[1:46:23] the world didn't give it to me that Joy
[1:46:25] I'd rather have that joy to know that
[1:46:28] the same question has been answered I'd
[1:46:29] rather have that joy to know that I'll
[1:46:32] pass from Death unto life I would rather
[1:46:33] have that Joy
[1:46:35] then all that of the world I would
[1:46:37] rather have that joy that God working
[1:46:39] and molding and making and molding in my
[1:46:42] life
[1:46:43] has our walk been perfect no has our
[1:46:46] walk been mistake free no but there has
[1:46:48] been sufficient Grace all along
[1:46:51] that when we have failed God does not
[1:46:53] just pick us up and beat us to death but
[1:46:56] God comes and he guides us directs us
[1:46:59] corrects us and you know what God does
[1:47:01] it according to our age in him God
[1:47:05] doesn't take a you know a little a
[1:47:07] little one a little baby that don't know
[1:47:08] nothing about him say I'm gonna whoop no
[1:47:09] God doesn't do that God Waits until
[1:47:11] there's a moment where they can even
[1:47:13] understand where that would correspond
[1:47:14] in the right way
[1:47:16] God does that in our lives
[1:47:19] aren't you glad for that
[1:47:22] oh I love him I love him

[1:47:39] I'm grateful for the times that even God
[1:47:41] has spoke to my heart and maybe that I
