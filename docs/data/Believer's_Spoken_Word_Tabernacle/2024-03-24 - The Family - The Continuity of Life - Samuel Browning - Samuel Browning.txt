forward to What the Lord Has for us throughout the day and uh just so enjoyed the song service here and singing what a what an atmosphere to walk into to amen so we want to just turn our attention here just to the Lord in prayer as we go in prayer this morning uh I know there were different requests that were made known and mentioned and uh yesterday as I was on my way uh to the office here um I got a call and my aunt Linda or sister Linda cavillo she they had to take her by Squad the previous night night on Friday night early Saturday morning so when I went over to just went straight there to University to see her before coming back here and um she had pneumonia there in her lungs and then also an infection in her body and you know sometimes with some of the infections those of you that are in the medical field sometimes it can those infections can um leave someone to where they they have kind of like a blank and uh they you know sometimes they don't everything's pretty short and quick and yes and yes and no and yes and no so we just begin to pray and um as we begin to pray just the presence of the Lord just drawing near and she began to enter in there and then after we were done praying you know it was kind of back to the same responses but um we just let her just rest and I just ask that you'd remember her in prayer there's many needs brother Brian mentioned it and brother Alex when he was praying there are many there's no doubt others that maybe if if that need if someone streaming and your name was not read across let me just say right now we're going to lift it up before the god the Throne of God because every need is certainly there's many needs throughout the body amen needs that we need really a Divine Touch and my my aunt has really battled with that you know of the lung since she had a double lung transplant and she's really battled with that and um and we just uh know that God's in control I don't know how God's going to do everything but I know God's in control and I know that God can take those lungs and make them as though they're her own you know I I look at it and I I was just thinking about it as I was on my way to that hospital yesterday I said Lord you gave brother Ron Spencer a complete new set of lungs after that fire even where some thought well this cancer came from scars on their lungs no there was no scars on those lungs God gave a complete set amen now I look to God to do that you know God does things in his own way but he proves and he shows that he's God and it's all the supernatural it's all Supernatural because it God all healing comes from him so we just want to take not only that request but every other need there's many that are not here sick and I know we even had to cancel an event there on Friday evening where at our home my wife and others were getting together the uh young sisters so I know there's sickness Among Us in the body but let's just go to God In Prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we are are so thankful Lord for your mercies once again Lord father as our brother Alexander stood here Lord and prayer was offered up Lord for needs Lord throughout the congregation Lord needs that were read here Lord that father here and those that are streaming Lord others in situations like that of the hospital Lord where sister Linda is laying right now Lord and father for every requests Lord there are unspoken requests others Among Us Lord Brother Bobby sister Michelle and Chrissy Lord father many different ones Lord among us Lord father our Lord lack of recall means nothing to you Lord oh God we lift each one up Lord God before your throne Lord father those throughout Lord that are dealing Lord with sickness Lord and circumstances Lord that father have seemed to be Lord of a setback but Lord you are still almighty God so Lord above every one of these situations we take every need as that was already prayed over and placed here Lord and above it all we place the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for you're the almighty God the creator of heavens and earth and Lord you are all all that we have need of so we ask that Lord you'll just minister to every one of those needs may you move in that hospital room Lord in a very special way God May the same Angel of the Lord just brood Lord over her body Lord and set every cell Lord God in order Lord You're the restorer of life oh God you're the lifegiver Lord and we ask Lord that you would move Lord and father not only breathing life into her body but Lord that you oh God would move Lord in her spirit and her mind oh God let everything be straightened out oh God and brought Lord into harmony Lord with the promise that you have given us as your children Lord that father if two or three agree as touching any one thing it shall be done Lord we believe that Lord as Believers this morning Lord and father we just Lord take every need and every request Lord unspoken needs upon the hearts of your children Lord answers that are needed Lord Direction and guidance Lord oh Father we just Lord can think of No Greater place that we can be than in your presence Lord that our lives would be submitted for you know the decisions and all that we have before us Lord and we're asking God for your Divine leadership may you bless the service here this morning Lord oh God give us Grace one more time to step out out of the way Lord that you can just speak Lord the things Lord that Lord are necessary that you Lord would would Lord desire to say Lord prepare our hearts Lord Lord I pray oh God have your way may your spirit just move Among Us Lord in a very special way this morning Lord we love you and we thank you once again father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen God bless you amen musicians I want to say it's um it's good to have brother Jesse Potter here he's come up here from Tennessee and was came up and with with h the boys yesterday and be with us here through the services here today we really certainly love brother Jesse and uh he's uh just a real good brother and uh we also I I seen uh brother Josh and sister amariah we were pulling in and uh most of you know where I thought about when I seen uh sister amariah uh here and uh just how the Lord brought her through that uh accident that she had been through and uh that was just about a little bit over a month ago and how that God is so merciful and so I we're so thankful for that and just ask you would just continue to keep her in prayer as well uh some of you that's been through something like that you know sometimes there can be a you know sometimes just things sometimes can kind of linger a little bit but just ask that God will continue to minister Amen to her as well amen and just continue to strengthen her so we're so thankful to have her and uh brother Josh here with us and uh of course I here brother Alexander here and uh and he and sister Marie and the family my well you all are home and we're just so glad to have them here with us and uh my brother Alex has been such a blessing to us hasn't he hasn't assembly amen and sister Marie CU he couldn't be what he is without sister Marie she's what makes the house go round the Lord oh my but uh we certainly love them and so appreciate brother Alex has has just been so gracious to stand in here many times and uh you know he's I know one thing we we've been benefited each time amen we so appreciate the ministry amen of our brother and I know he's just got back from Honduras here he's been back for maybe a little month and a half or so and so um we also want to remind you as we prepare to turn to the word in Deuteronomy chapter 6 I want to remind you of the youth meeting this evening at 5:30 brother Paul uh will be coming in for that brother Paul Le Fontaine so we're certainly looking forward to that amen this this this afternoon and I certainly just ask just really covet your prayers here this morning that the Lord would just help us I want to speak here I want to just take a a moment here I had taken two services in January on the family and I want to I told you then I wanted to just stick with just doing a service a month on the family and so I just had this has been on my heart for some time and I want to speak on this and I believe it will very much will speak even and tie into that of the Resurrection as well in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 6 and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart I want you to notice the the priority the words that I speak shall be in thine heart that's first and thou shalt teach them that's second diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou west by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up so if the Lord will help us I'd like to just speak on that thought on the continuity of Life continuity of life may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated when we think of this in terms and looking at that of um of continuity and probably this morning I can probably safely say that the first part of that where we read for a text is where I'll really be uh dealing with here this morning is in that of the words that I would command you this is what's to be in your heart and um when we think of that of the continuity it's that which is something to to be unbroken and consistent existence or operation of something over a period of time it's also a state of stability and the absence of disruption and uh I think if there's one thing for sure that we could see we look even across in that of the world there is no continuity there in the world at all and I'm going to say this here if you take Christ from our midst there's no continuity Among Us he's the key he's the key that's the key to the door that's the key to everything it's his life he is the continuity to all things this is why that when you think of how that God would set this in even in the book of Exodus of how that when it was to be a new beginning for them and how that God would take of and address them when it came time to be delivered from that of Egypt God made a promise and when God makes a promise it's up to God to keep that promise and God's the one that has to step on the scene he doesn't entrust his word to anyone else to fulfill it but God fulfills his word by himself now he'll use vessels he's always used man but it's not the man that's doing it it's God operating through the man so that it'll always be a continuity God never breaks continuity the scripture says in Malachi I'm God and I change not right he's the same yesterday today and forever yes sir he's immun he's he's immutable in his ways I means unchangeable he's in that and he's immutable in his nature this is why that where Satan himself knows that the real true continuity of of God's own life and the True Church of the Living God is that of Mark 16 which is his church with his life in it carrying out what he began and so when you think of like it's just like your Bible our Bible is separated in Old Testament and New Testament it's groom and bride and that coming together is complete and so been yet the new never took away never did away with the old but the new is the Fulfillment of that of the old is that right it's the continuity so you know as much and sometimes uh you know men and and they can't help it they're inspired and directed that way to and they'll spend their lifetimes to try to disprove and try to you know look at and how this is this doesn't fit here and this doesn't fit here and I think if my memory serves me correctly there was a man that just they wanted to disprove the Bible so bad and with things and there's been many but you know they wanted to just stand upon that of King David and then here after 60 some years of their life they find an artifact that declares that indeed there was a David a King David on Earth I I don't know what really became of that man but I I would trust in my heart that at that time after all those years of trying to disprove something I would trust that it would take the mercy of God and say Lord forgive me I've been wrong I that's what I trust at that that's what took place but I realize that within it all that it's just a privilege to be a believer it's it's a real privilege that God himself because to believe is not something that altogether that we have done on our own but God has given us Grace to believe it's because he's graced us with his presence true there must be something on the inside to respond but if you don't have him pulling on that part of himself then how can you respond so the seed can only respond to to the author and from where it come from so this is why that we must have him the quickening power that life right among us moving and doing and Performing the same as he's always done and so when we think of this in Exodus 12 it's like that of a family where how that God would say it's it's a time of taking the lamb and killing the lamb and you know putting the the lamb over the the the door post they had to put it all over the doorpost and they never put it on the threshold because you're never to walk over the blood you're to walk under the blood and and they inside of that house would take that lamb and they would eat that lamb they would roast it and they would eat it with bitter herbs they would eat and all of those things have a part but you see it was regarded as though there was one lamb that was slain for all of Israel yet for all of the families being that it was a type it would require as God said let every man take a lamb to his house according to the number of his children my I feel like preaching and this is where I'm going anyhow but you see God didn't say just take it for you but he said I want you to count your children and however many children there are I want you to make sure that there's enough lamb to go around for every one of them what are you saying brother Samuel I don't care where they're at right now you have taken this Lamb with them in mind there is enough lamb to go around let me tell you something there's enough Holy Ghost there's enough power there's enough Deliverance to break chains and bondage in lives Hallelujah just because he healed one he's not diminished one iot Hallelujah so there's nothing that'll bring continuity like the Holy Ghost that's the beginning of continuity of our life you know we could all we could sit down uh you know let me just take my buddy here for a minute brother Alex if we sit down I now I'm going to say probably most of the time that we would we will agree I mean uh you know there's a lot of things that we can Fellowship I know where he stands on this message and I love that I I appreciate his stand so I don't worry about it when I the ministry have come in here I'm not having somebody in that I question right if you question the message then I don't I don't want to I I don't have a question about the message I I I I want somebody that that knows that they have met God the God of this word now when we sat down and we Fellowship you know there might be some things you know here or there that maybe brother Alex say well I you know I'm kind of seeing this this way and kind of seeing this this way and maybe I would say this you know like for example H what kind of pie you like I like oh I knew you was going to give me some of that man I knew you was going to say that I like Apple you all right man you all right supposed like Cherry hey man I love Apple I love it all but you see the my my my I'll pick a different example but you see you know know there's differences that that we might have and you know he might you know like uh you know this kind of pie and this one like this kind of pie and there's sometimes there's things that you know maybe this one would see this a little bit and see this a little different and you know maybe some people have the the penny March when it comes in their Church to birthday times like they had in brandom Tabernacle and and maybe some people don't do it you see some of those things we can look at and say well I don't see uh continuity necessarily within that but what's important is is that we have continuity in his life if we have the continuity of his life he will lead us and guide us into all truth you see sometimes we're trying to hammer out all the specifics and we got to get everybody believing the same way and we got listen that they been trying to do that the Crusaders and everybody else there's only one way to get everybody believing the same way and that's for God himself to have a a personal meeting with you Hallelujah because when we're in love with him then even though we might disagree with one another but we've still got love for one another because that's my brother that's my sister is that all right now so it matters first of all it's about individuals being lined up when individual is lined up with God in harmony with God in a continu ity of life then it can come down from Individual then it moves the husband wife and then through the family which brings us back to our text first let these words be in thine heart sir then teach them right is that right and some of the ways remember uh the ways that we teach is not altogether Always by words is the greatest teacher is example amen a lifel lived this is why the prophet would tell us in this manner and say that the message of the hour is not only to be the flame or the light of the hour but it is to be the flame and the light inside of our hearts this is why that through the message of the token and he would preach that message multiple times and when he preached that message I want you to understand now that listen the message of the hour if you just stop and look at the titles of this you might say brother Samuel I think you're making too much well I'm I'm sorry you feel that way but to me the titles are an announcement that when we look at that of the token the prophet had been laboring and moved before God he had had a burden for the Church of the Living God and there there was a need to bring stability in lives and a confidence I mean you can't do nothing when you do it work at your job if you're the least little bit unconfident in what you're doing you better not step behind that machine cuz you're sure the world your fingers might be coming off you've got to be confident in what you're doing this is why sometimes you know that when somebody explains something to you this is just me I want to re I want to refresh it back to you is this is what you're saying I want to State it back to you because I like my fingers I I I like certain things and you see God makes his word so plain before you and I and this is why when it comes down to that of the token let me be very simple with it we're talking about God's own life we're talking about the Holy Spirit we're talking about the reason that God himself stepped down from glory and became one of us because not only that he would understand us but that he might pay the price and as a redeemer I hope you're hearing me this morning as a redeemer it must be somebody number one who's able to do it and second of all that must be willing to do it let me tell you your Kinsman and My Kinsman is not only able to do it he was willing to do it he didn't just do it for one person remember he made the purchase he did it once and for all for everyone of his redeemable children amen glory be to God I tell you there is sufficient power in in the offering of that sacrifice amen amen and the life that came from that back into the worshipper this is why that even the prophet would say in that of the message token when he's talking about applying it you know and he's talking about getting the trash out of your house and other things like that as he's going through that one of the most important things that he says as he says you believe it you apply it and let your loved ones see it in you and it'll take effect amen so it isn't altogether what we say or what we'll do but it is the life inside of us that takes an effect on somebody else I don't know about you but when I come in contact with another individual I I I'll just say it like this that maybe they're not ordained to walk in the light that God has given to you and I but I pray that the light that burns in my heart under the message of the hour would challenge somebody if they're a Baptist if they're a Pentecostal whatever their allotment is that it would challenge them to live to the fullness of the light that God has called them to live in are you hearing me that's the that's the kind of people we want to be is hearts and lives that are challenging and encouraging one another amen hallelujah let it take effect pray about it be in prayer be in consideration and with such love you know what love does when you're in the presence of God and I I will just say this we need a continual refilling of the love of God you know when when you're under his presence I tell you what as you come out of that after refilling it doesn't matter what's been going on it don't matter who said what it doesn't matter what it is that you've heard but there is a strength within you that won't allow things to stick in your life but in other words because you have received another refilling of the pass that you are under then you have the strength to give a pass to one another woo my my and you then operate like a redeemer then when you go and talk to that loved one you talk to that one that Lord I'm going to get them for you I'm claiming them for you you see this is why when Rahab she was told to apply to when remember she asked I want to be I want to be sure cuz I know destruction's coming so I want something that's sure she said I want a true token I don't just want a token but I want something that's positive I want something that's sure that when I'm standing in here and everything else is shaking I want something that's solid I want a true token now I want you to take this I want you to look at this that The Messengers when they came to her they did not altogether bring something different into her house but she already had something there but she just didn't know how to apply it this is why God did not need to send a new Bible the message never came to replace the Bible but the message came to show you and I what was laying here the whole time that belonged to you and I and say hey that carlet Scarlet thread you are always a part of God you are always in God's mind it has showed us how to apply the word and live as Believers that's what this message has done for you and I it's raised the word of God to a living reality in our lives and this is why it is very important that you that me as individuals getting under it first then going after others are you hearing me we want to have a place where we are we are we are tied to and and bringing back bringing one back to this is why the prophet would say believe for your safety first then for your loved ones is that all right now Psalms 133 verse one I want you to look at this just for a moment the Bible said behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Discord in unity how pleasant that is I think Unity is a wonderful thing if you don't like Unity I'll pause the service and I'll pray for you right now cast That Old contous Devil away from you because a real child of God loves peace the Bible said follow peace with all men without no man shall see God is that right that's why we are Children of Peace I love peace don't you and I'm not just talking about a piece of pie I'm talking about Peace p e a c e peace Shalom tranquility and you know what let me just tell you something peace is not come through compromise my peace don't come through compromise look where Israel s that right now look at the pressure they're trying to bring upon Israel right now you know the Bible said whoo when all nations would turn against her that's right these people let me just tell you something these men that are up there in Washington right now they are anointed with Devils you say brother Samuel how can you say that hey when the devil took the Lord Jesus up to the mountain he showed him all the kingdoms of this world and said if you'll Bow Down and Worship me I'll give him to you but Satan has a way of splicing things he only showed the good parts of those kingdoms he didn't show all the Brokenness and all the homes and ruined lives he don't show all of that he won't show you young man and young lady he won't show you all of the things that decisions you make right now where it'll be later in your life he won't show you all of that right you ain't never seen a Marbell man on on a on a billboard lugging around and proclaiming he's an empyema patient and when GL you know with a tank of oxygen what do you see you see them smiling the big old Smiles like they're having a good time but the Bible said that the pleasure of sin is but for a season let me tell you something on my worst day I'm better than I was on my best day when I was serving the devil Hallelujah that's what his life has done for me it changed my life it picked me up from a life in the gutters of sin and it raised me up in the newness of life oh my want the church makeover amen it's got to be his life how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments so notice it don't it don't it don't start in the feet and move up but but the anointing is coming from the head down brother let me tell you we're living in the hour right now where the head has United with the body amen and that same anointing that same anointing of the Messiah is working through the body of Jesus Christ it's working through the littlest pinky toe member it's working there because even if you are a part of his feet you might be the skin in the bottom of his feet but let me remind you so you can remind the devil of his position he's still under your [Applause] feet Oh Glory verse three as the D Now watch how this is described this ointment as the Dew not as a sudden rainfall but as the D of Herman if you look at what the promise was to the firstborn the firstborn promise to those when Jacob received that blessing it was the do what does do do is something that comes down in the coolness of the night and the early morning you don't hear it it's a silent coming but you will see the effect of its coming is that right you'll see it when you wake up of a morning my the Dew that's upon that of the grass it's come you never heard one d drop descend sometimes we hear the rain we hear the snow know but the Dew itself it is the moisture that's in the air and everything itself around the conditions and temperature it changes and it allows what was there in an invisible form of water vapor to now become visible and let me tell you something God's presence in our lives right now has taken and revealed the invisible God and made him visible in our midst that he not a figment of my imagination this is not a pipe dream this is a living reality that he is proving himself he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah it's the DW that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more so that that continuity of his Spirit it flows down to reach every part of the body the family the local body of believers that that's a precious ointment and that is the great great unifier or what brings the unity that God is looking for so the continuity nothing brings that continuity like God's life inside of a redeemed subject is that right that that's that's nothing that that brings that in that way now this is why that when we begin to see this I want I want to go to job 1 and verse4 and I I wanted just just just to uh uh speak a little bit upon this on this on the continuity of life because I realized that when even that as we said God God mentioned in his text he said these words that I command you this day let them be in thine heart and then teach them to thy children and he says diligently now there's all I'm not going to deal with that here this morning but to really to to to instruct them to to minister to them ministering to their needs and and and those things of teaching and you know that don't mean that we got to get a pull pit and stand in our our uh uh living room or family room or whatever more no it's God give us the grace to break down the word and to break it down and be able to minister it even to their lives to be able to teach things that should be taught go brother I I'm very tempted to go about I'm not going to I want to lay this in here today on the life I want to lay it today on the life you see when we look at it like this in job 1:4 the Bible says concerning job his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all once again just like it was in Exodus where you take a lamb for your household according to the number of your children right and job offered for every one of his children job offered up a burnt offering first for himself right are you with me first for himself then he offered a burnt offering for each one of his children for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually now brother brah says it this way in the way to have Fellowship he said job was a righteous man a man who feared God and troubles came to him but I want you to notice that just before the troubles come job made preparation for this trouble he said listen sinner friend there's trouble right ahead of you tonight and that's The Valleys of the Shadows of death you better make preparations for the only friend who can walk with you through that make preparations for it let me just say this to you I've been in I've been in situations where I'm thankful to God that you know sometimes the somebody's hearing is the last thing that'll go and where I was you know I got called in and different ones that hey will you come and you know it might have been 1 two in the morning or whatever and I went went over there to the hospice unit and there be to speak to to someone and would just say to him if if you can hear me and your answer is yes squeeze my hand and begin to tell them and begin to speak to them of Salvation now I I'm thankful for the Salvation of the Lord that God made way but you know not everybody has that opportunity at those last moments I walked into a room brother Bill called me we walked into a room and he was called by one of the neighbors and we walked in a few some years back and he we came over and and uh we went in and went in to pray for him and I'll tell you what we saw in that room we didn't have to really ask where was that man at we heard what was going on in there there was some real torment taking place in that room that man was walyed and looking at us and you know moving around all over the bed and when brother Bill and I begin to gather around of course he couldn't understand English we begin to gather around and just pray and ask for the mercy of almighty God and brother Bill be to speak to him you say what became of that I I don't know but I know what I saw in that time and I would encourage you right now don't count on the last minute amen make every moment count if you're here today and you don't know where your destiny lies and you know that you're not ready to meet the Lord don't leave out of this place until you're ready you can't go in on your mama's coattails you can't go in on your daddy's coattails you've got to have your own experience with God my my oh notice he said make preparations for it now I want you to watch how brother br will bring this down and he says I feel sorry for fathers and mothers today being a parent myself and knowing one reason I'm trying to get my children away from our city we don't have any Christian schools there and I want them to get somewhere where they'll be brought up in school in a real Fundamental School where they'll where they'll they'll learn to love the Lord now watch brother BR wasn't just sending them and saying well I hope somebody else could teach them no you see church is not to take the place of your time of devotion at home this should not be the first place that your children hear somebody praying and I'll just say it PL it should not be the first place that they feel the presence of God I trust they feel God's presence here I know he's here but God didn't intend that you just have to come here to the to the church to fill his presence he wants to live in your home and live in your life that through you it's a personal contact not drop him off at youth meeting and say brother Samuel fix them up no oh my no listen I'm not a miracle worker I'm just got to speak plain I'm not a miracle worker right you know I've had that where everything else is done and brother Samuel come and fix this well you know my heart is burdened I want to help anybody I can help but sometimes there's things that you realize that you know what God if your mercy don't come on the scene not only to straighten this out but help me also to speak to the other one and say hey you got to stop aiming it this way you got to start lining up with God's word that it'll have an effect in your home come on Friends amen notice so I'm not just brother BR wasn't just looking for a Christian School to send them to to say I need somebody just to you know somebody's got to teach in the ways of the Lord you got to be careful where you're even sending your kids to yes amen you got to be careful you might even send them listen I remember there was a time here my wife and I we were looking that you know with Zachary being the last one we're about out of breath with homeschooling right now but God's given us Grace to make it you know bless her heart she's the one that's really been doing the labor and I'm just the principal and the and the math guy you know but uh you know the enforcer but anyhow you know we we we we get in that place and Ma you know uh you come to that we we got to looking at another you know another school that's you know out in a Southern place here from from us I'm not going to call their name and so we went out there and they said oh you're a pastor we we we we'll give you so many uh you know so much money you know that your your kids can come here and and make you know your child and and you know probably somebody will you know be a sponsor for and everything else and I got to I was looking around that school and my mind went back and I thought I remember to associating with some people from this school now I know everybody don't associated with don't represent that school but I remember that it it wasn't nothing like you know Angels flying around there you go and then I went in when they were going to have their you know morning devotion and I went in what a what a beautiful Chapel that they had and they've made that thing look like a concert hall black stage and black background and every I thought dear Lord am I am I back out in the world wow you know they got these rock bands and everything else up there and you know they're ministering to the young people there ain't ministering to the young people listen friends I'm not here to try to criticize people I believe that there is something that maybe they want to try to do good but let me tell you God's not interested in you just getting to a church cuz you can set in a church all your life and die and go to hell just getting to a church you ain't made it you've got to get to Calvary you've got to meet the Lord Jesus Christ in a personal way that's right that's where my heart burns when I look at that there's young people in needs that are there well you know I just couldn't find peace about it so you know you know what we didn't go that way I said you know what we'll just we're going to ask God and you know the Lord will just help us and guide us you know God knows what we have need of and God certainly made way with that and I I'm thankful uh for where where we're at now but I I'm just saying it in this manner that you've got we have to be mindful that's TR brother R says this he goes on that same quote he says because the teaching that I can give them around home yet when they get out around that worldly crowd the Devil is a R fellow and he pushes that into him now watch this he says but if you'll keep them under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost brother Samuel how old is that is that 12 you're missing the quote it's not for you to push them it's for you to keep them under it God has reserved every experience the prophet tells us Satan's Eden your experiences are predestinated from the hand of God are you with me if you keep them under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost and know what it's all about then God will take care of the rest of I like that if you do your part what are you doing I'm preparing for a miracle hey little woman woman of cabus what are you doing by making that cake I'm preparing for a miracle that's right hey those of you that are filling up those those empty uh uh uh uh uh barrels or jugs what what are you doing you ran out of wine what are you doing I'm preparing for a miracle amen amen you see you got to do according to the word you do that first then the miracle follows the word because the miracle is to come and make manifest the word that you're walking in obedience to so here keep them under the spirit until they get on all that's the same manner that even has been from the Old Testament with Abraham on down on down on down it was the same manner when the Lord Jesus when he raised even before he raised from the dead remember he called the disciples to him and he had them around him they could see they could watch him he even would correct them remember when John was all upset because you know they wouldn't receive the Lord Jesus and he said should we call Fire Out of Heaven now John knew that story he you know no doubt he had had stars on that in Sunday school on his chart he was a Firebrand but you know when the Lord Jesus took that that scripture and begin to apply that he said wait a minute you don't know what Spirit you're of so he was showing him even how to apply the word and yet after the after the crucifixion they all went their separate ways sheep that were scattered that was the promise of that was God would fulfill or would come to pass but after he was raised from the grave what did he do he gathered his disciples together and pointed them to the upper room right so he gathered them under there's nothing that can unite outside of God himself coming around his children is that right now there'll be others remember there are many that were that are attracted many that even when he came back in for the feast that were attracted but yet not all of them were Eagles right some of them just looked at it a little bit and fin that h h no no no they they went away but you couldn't get rid of the elect of God but it was necessary that they were held underneath the spirit of God As a matter of fact the comforter himself that was dwelling Spirit of Truth dwelling behind that body of Flesh told them that you that I will be in you even with you to the end of the age so they were held under the reality of God but now when the spirit of God has come on the day of Pentecost now is the same life that was in there the same Jesus that was there the same one that lived in that body was now living in their bodies it was the continuity of Life there was a continuity so that's the same way with this message when you think about it God takes a message like like when you look at that of Exodus where Moses was to go down to Egypt you will find a little portion of scripture where God made a promise that I will bring them out with a mighty hand but all that God will do when he takes a hold and begins to fulfill that word then he begins to unfold himself in the midst of his people and this is the same way with the message of the hour God just did not send and drop to you an i and say hey this is the message of the hour but God labored with you and I he labored with this generation can I just repeat the words of the Prophet The Prophet would stand there in perfect Faith he would say it in other places and he said you know what I'm going to do he said I'm going to put my faith on top of your faith and I'm going to call out to God on your behalf let me tell you in this generation it wasn't a man's idea that has been placed over the Bride of Jesus Christ it has been the hand of almighty God and brotherr we're not raiding on a latter rain we have saw the cloud as a man's hand amen the cloud himself Christ himself right here among you and I we are under the message of adoption we are under a word that will mature you my I'm trying not to get over in Ruth oh my we are under a message that will supply and satisfy all that you have need of he is your goel he will perfect all that's lacking he's got your [Applause] [Music] back notice in Acts chapter 16 same Principle as this was with job when they came Piers Peter or Paul and Silas man here they are locked up for actually helping somebody right and then they didn't help the Commerce of the world they didn't help that guy that you know he lost that person that was walking around with divination and speaking you know on behalf of those gods and things they lost Commerce let me tell you something right now when God got a hold of your life and a hold of my life there's places of business that lost our [Applause] business they lost our business amen that's good come on now some of you were some Heavy Hitters they lost your business and some of you just W Heavy Hitters I know there's people sitting in right here there was some of you that was Kingpin in this County woo you know what I'm talking about but notice what happened when God's grace got a hold of your life it interrupted the commerse everything that was going on in your life Hallelujah oh God has a way of interrupting what needs to be interrupted there's things from that come down from my family tree I'm so glad that he interrupted aren't you sir oh we need them kind of interruptions when the Holy Ghost has come it interrupts any claim that was there in that family tree that's what the continuity of this life does it puts us right back in position as a son and daughter of God uh acts 16:30 here they come in now notice this man had no doubt took into account what what Paul and Silas that they were Believers heard him singing heard him praising God the Bible says how he came and he fell down before their feet and in verse 30 said sir what must I do to be saved and they said you got to stop this that and this and that nope he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house oh I love it the prophet will take this verse he said when you really believe there is a measure of faith that is released to you and you begin to lift above cheating lift above lying lift above living immoral lift above immoral dress what is it it's a measure of faith that is released to you as you believe so it isn't you quitting it it's the faith of God coming in and your will is lined up with God's Will and the the will of God is being done through your life believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved amen now you know brother brand will pick this up when the in the message approach to God and uh Brana it's the approach to God and paragraph 33 there bless her heart she has such a job to keep up here oh you say now brother brandham now wait a minute I don't believe that the influence of the father now he's talking about offering the burnt offering I don't believe that the influence of the father I believe it's an individual Affair but we are commissioned to pray for one another and to offer up our loved ones to God that he will save them so brother br's not contradicting that it's not an individual Affair but he's saying as job offered up the burnt offering continually for that of his not only hisself or his children you know you and I actually have it easier than job we don't have to offer it up we just have to accept what's been offered up job actually had to offer it up he had to take it out there separate it out on the altar he had to do that you and I have it easier all we have to do is accept what the sacri rice has already done for [Music] us so he's not taking away that it's not an individual Affair it is an individual affair with every one of our children and every one of our loved ones it is an individual Affair now as we're looking at this brother R would say he says now in the midst of all this job kept his mind on God in the offering of the sin offerings he says now maybe the approach and you say was it in the New Testament too certainly it was if I get saved in my house should I leave my house not unless you have to I'd stay right there for Paul told the Philippian Jailer believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy household shall be saved the Sanctified wife sanctifies the husband live like a Christian now this is how it happens live like a Christian be like a Christian pray all the time believe that God is there and is God going to answer your prayer and offer it through the provided approach let me just tell you like this when instead of getting frustrated offer the lamb instead of getting upset offer the lamb why because you're to offer it with prayer consideration and in such love I mean if you ask your wife for something and you say hey come on now where's this at and she says here here's your eggs and I hope you enjoy wow that's good you would sayoo that was with love right you would say my that was no no but but look look how this is live like a Christian see friends this is the secret it's not our knowledge it's not even our frustration let me just share something with you I hope this all right if you if you you disagree with me fine you can disagree with me but you know what I I've got such a place and such a part I realize you know where I miss you miss seeing different and people maybe that's gone astray and you miss seeing them in the house of God listen they know they're not in the house of God and instead of walking up and saying hey you need to get back to church hey you need to get back to church I just say you know what what I want I what I look at is I want to be friendly to them I want to encourage them because let me just say this to you you might think I'm wrong but I don't want somebody to think that it's just coming here to church that you set under this roof it's got to be more than that because that's what they have that's all they had or they wouldn't be where they're at you can say we miss you and if you ain't seen somebody in a while in church don't chastise them and say hey how you doing stranger oh my wonder when the last time God asked you that when you gave him only those five minute prayers that's good come on friends will you say what are we doing brother Brandon PRS this same scripture and he preaches the message thy house and he says I am believing not only for my children but I'm believing for every brother for every sister I'm holding them up before the Throne of God are you hearing me job was not offering an offering with my I see him changing my I see this is going good my I see no he said per Adventure they sin as a matter of fact I'll read you a quote here in a minute brother said job seen worldliness wow but sometimes when we see worldliness we want to pout on God or we want to somehow chastise as reprimand as though and sometimes listen friends I realize sometimes when we deal with are all of our makeups this is where the part that's not in continuity I realize some of these parts about us is not going to ever be changed until the change of the body and there's certain things about us that we have to recognize hey that's still in me but I got to rule over that and God has allowed that to be in your life so he could dig it out of your life and manifest his glory through that air in your life amen he's there teaching you and I remember the prophet said when you go to talk to that loved one you're praying in Your Heart Lord I'm going to claim them for you now that don't mean you're spit and powdered sugar all over them it doesn't mean you're going along with their sin but it's just exactly like the prophet told Brother Billy Paul just read it here this morning in brother Billy Paul's testimony of how brother Bram told him said look I want you to remember that Daddy is your buddy when you go out you're going out in sin and the way you're going I want you to remember that Daddy is still your buddy but Daddy is not going to go along and condone your sin but when the rest of the world and your so-called buddies they let you go I want you to remember that Daddy is your buddy brother random just didn't tell him that every Tuesday morning he went fishing with Billy [Music] Paul hallelujah oh brother Samuel I'd say he preached to him he did not as a matter of fact in the M well I I need to just keep on going here in the message the prodal 1950 brother brother Billy Paul I've got it at home the the testimony he slips into church finally cuz he had been sitting across the street on Doc's porch and would not come back into the church because of the way he was living but he was sitting on the porch across from the church yeah I'm talking about look at you know what I I am I'm glad in the way that God gave this example here is the prophet of God his oldest son you know what it shows you and I that just because he saw the angel of the Lord at age 11 but that didn't hold [Applause] him are you hearing me it didn't hold him it didn't keep him from smoking didn't keep him from playing cards amen right just so just because we're raised and got a knowledge of the message and you got books on the shelf and pictures on the wall it's got to be more than that it's got to be a display in your life it's got to be a reality where Jesus Christ is present in your home he's present in your life right and I ain't talking about it Christmas time or Easter time either bring Jesus out of the Tomb and don't just point to an empty you be a fi place for him my my my my my my my notice this cuz in that message the prodical son brother B brother Billy sat on the back the back room he fin came into church 1950 I'm giving these dates CU I'm going to read you some dates here in just a minute showing an example how this cuz when we look at the scripture job did it continually I love how the message of the hour you know what it is it's showing the application how that we apply these things that's right the deacons had a burden on their heart for Billy Paul so brother brandham come out and he's preaching the message the prodical son brother Bram said brother Billy said I know he didn't do it cuz I was there because he said Daddy wouldn't do things like that but the deacons came around to him and begin to work on him brother Billy Paul got up and walked out of the out of the church brother Billy says God was dealing with my heart he said I was fighting it back the whole service now brother Bram called them deacons in the back office and this is what he told him he said I see that you all have a burden for my son for Billy and I so appreciate that but don't ever do that again to him or nobody else it's got to be between God and that person what are you saying if you persuade them then listen friends the devil can come back back around and say you don't have nothing you were only persuaded into it but God knows how to get your attention God knows how to get your children God knows how to work on lives God don't shame his people to the altar he calls them in love and mercy and Grace and lets them know you are a value in my eyes I shed my blood for you you are always in my [Applause] mind hallelujah hallelujah my my brother Braham talked about sending his boy he says it like this he says in the message approached to God he said I thought about sending my boy to school knowing that everything Billy Paul that I drilled into him unless he becomes really converted really come to Christ all of his nature be changed he'd be swept out from under my hands oh Lord you mean he's been taught drilled the right teaching yeah he set under the right thing he saw the miraculous but unless his Nature's been changed that's right he'll be swept out am why because he is in with that old nature you are still in continuity With the Enemy this is why the new birth is important it brings you in continuity with God and God begins to work on your life even by new heart and a new spirit he gives that to you because before that you couldn't even get along with yourself then he said I'll put my spirit in you is that right because the very nature in him no matter being a good boy you he was a good boy having a minister father a religious home where we don't approve of any of the worldly things in our home we try to live by the grace of God like Christians ought to live the influence set before him he'd certainly walk over a righteous home look how this is worded he'd walk over a righteous home to be lost by if he's going to be lost he's going to have to walk over a lot right anybody like speed bumps I'm going to say put your hands down you're lying in one way back in the neighborhood where I live I wish they'd put some up where now because all that new development that they've done and you get people whipping around there and and everything else but you know what I hate speed bumps you know why you got to slow down if you don't slow down it just you know the bouncing all around so I don't like speed bumps but this is what the prophet is saying he's going to have to walk over speed bumps things that will slow him down to cause him to think that's good pre that's good preach and I want him to have to walk over my life he'd have to walk over the Bible he'd have to walk over the blood of Christ because I'll certainly by God's grace present it in front of him amen amen but if his nature isn't change he'll go right on just the same Billy entered high school and I thought oh my knowing that he he'd been baptized certainly but he never made a full surrender consecration to Christ so brother Braham is not he's not ignorant he's he's been baptized he surrendered his heart to God but he's able to see he's not been fully consecrated yet right and he knows how important that is he's that that that initial part that decision that step how wonderful that that is brother is able to see that he hasn't made a full consecration now knowing the nature of a child yet was in him how my heart yearned for him and how I'd pray I'd go out in my car and ride around and say this is how the offering up of that burnt offering and say God don't let my boy get wrapped up in that kind of stuff out there how that I said God I hope I pray his his mother's dead and I've been both Daddy and mother to him so please don't let him get wrapped up out there and get in trouble some way will you just protect him Hallelujah now remember when brother Billy Paul I don't know if y'all knew this or not it's in the message but it was one of those things that for me it wasn't until a few years back and then as I'm studying this is's going through that you realize remember brother ramam saw a vision of him smoking 13 years old 13-y old boy smoking and brother brandham just waited and then he mentioned it to brother Billy Paul what it was he'd got out there in school and got around some of the rest of the people you see you'll never find brother brandom in these quotes saying but I'm the prophet of God for this age they of the Lord visits our home he comes right in that Den office and that is enough no he knew he knew he's got to have his nature changed if not no matter how much that I have put in him unless that nature is changed it'll be swept right out of him that's right now this is 1955 brother brandom is dealing now what what he said this is what I want you to take into account I know I'm I'm taking a few moments here but I want you to I want I want you to catch this this is this is how we apply the token this is why I want you to catch this we're applying it by the life the life that's lived and you and I cannot speed anything up in our children but for goodness sakes I don't want to put the wrong kind of roadblocks in the way there you go brother you understand I don't want to put the wrong if look if they've made a decision and look it's not just when they made a decision I I want to see them serve God I want to I want to get them in every place that I can get them with the presence of God I want them to be in meetings I want them to be in fellowship with good brothers and good sisters maybe I shouldn't have said that good sisters but but we do want good sisters because I want good daughter-in-laws you go interviews not I'm just but watch this in 1955 that I'm reading out of 1955 in these prior messages right watch how brother brandham approaches this brother Billy Paul is not converted Yet brother brother brandham wanted to take him out of the school the reason I'm reading this is because he's seen the influences that was on his child right now this is I want you to take this tonight this morning don't take this as pressure you pray and seek God don't take it as pressure well I can't do that or I I can't homeschool that's not what I'm saying here that's not what brother brandham is saying what I'm saying is when we take from this here is to pray over it and you pray and talk to God what's amazing to me is sometimes when you hear things where people talk about their kids like they're dogs well I want my kids to be socialized they're not dogs who do you want them to be socialized with the world come on friends I'm reading quotes and there's a whole Bounty more we want them to be I I want them to be so under the presence of God I know what's out there I see the influences that's out there listen where I've Got Confidence for is that when their life is sealed away hey I God they're in God's hands God takes care of the rest of the way and that the greatest achievement has been done notice brother Billy Paul brother B talks about taking him with him in the meetings brother Ram said last night Billy Paul in the presence of the Lord Jesus he taken me a little early me he took him out of the pull pit than what I thought he should have done but he said Daddy you turned completely white brother BR said if that boy would give himself over to God he sees Visions but he's just in the Adolescent age and you pray for him see brother Brown believed his own message his son saw Visions but he never made that an Evidence hello somebody he believed his own message hallu see he's never given himself over to God Amen but he's just in the Adolescent age he's 20 years old right now and you pray for him I keep him in the meetings because I know what Young Life is and I was young once myself brother brandom how can you have him pass on out prayer cards because I know what Young Life is and brother brandom took him out of the school to keep him with him because he knew the influences that was there he saw the direction that brother Billy was going let me tell you in this day and age and hour we living in listen this is why there's got to be such a contact and such a relationship and that's where Satan hates that in the homes he wants to keep us busy going here going there going here going there going here going there what what's he trying to do he wants to keep that relationship in Array or disarray and broken but that is some of the most important times right amen I hate to say it that almost anymore the dinner tables almost out of the house I think it ought to be a priority amen I'm not talking about eating cuz I believe in that but I'm talking about getting around the table so what I'm saying here atmosphere is important atmosphere brings Faith amen my my I'm just going to have to quit there keep going thank you I will you're allowable to get killed after this service it'll be one less Tennessee and [Laughter] Volunteer State oh I love [Applause] it but you know friends let me just say it like this you want your children to fellowship and see that's important you be an example you want to see him fellowship with other people you be an example how can you tell them and lead them and tell them the importance of Fellowship well brother Samuel all I need is a word I can't get to that this morning but it's also Fellowship that's right fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith amen is that right Fellowship is important and brother BR would tell sister Becky you know his his little daughter he would tell her in the message remembering the Lord there's a youth rally that's going on brother Bram said I told my daughter you make it your business to get in there she said I don't know nobody in there I said you'll know somebody or everybody will know you just go on anyhow I'm praying she receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost during this rally right now you know what brother bram's talking about here because at this time even months after this in the message desperation sometimes these are parts of the message that we can miss at first but brother Ram talks about how she's in a teeny bopper stage right she'll sat in the back of the church and want a chew gum while church is going on said she's in a Carefree the beginning of message desperation 1963 in September she just sat in the back and kind of don't want want anything to do with God that's the beginning of 63 or or in September but you know what happened there in March of 1963 she met George now here's some months later she's still not filled with the Holy Ghost remember she's just had her episode of running around and as far as running around going you know playing that rock and roll music she said but I was really bad brother Bram said yeah as bad as we wanted to get but notice this is what brother Bram says I can't read you the quote today I got in front of me he says now he says we had that going on he said but of course he said then she met George and that settled all that he said he's a good Christian boy did that mean she was born again no no it went until later as a matter of fact brother Bram allowed him to get engaged but said don't you you're not allowed to get married until you get the Holy Ghost wow wow are you hearing me now that my words that's brother George's words what brother Bram had told him right you see he brother Bram he saw the goodness of that company and that that encouragement and that company listen friends oh my I I could go on and on I I just we we we need to quit we need to quit but we want to keep our children in the right kind of company that's right want to keep them in the right kind of place and we want that continuity of life that atmosphere is what is so important amen when it says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I want to drop this in because sometimes I know that as I told you before and I I think about different ones I know that some of you you don't have your children setting here with you and I always praying I'm asking the Lord and looking to the Lord because you know when God comes along and speaks to our hearts these are things that the Lord burdens my heart to speak even for young families and young ones coming on even for us as examples here in the church as older ones of God gave their's a position in there for you and I and a responsibility but when I I look here in this in this portion of scripture believe and thine and thy house shall be saved there's things that you know anybody could go along and let me just say this to you you every as I said before everyone's experience is predestinated from the hand of God it that's why a person might sit in church for 10 years before finally it comes it's God dealing personally with an individual life I don't want to get in the way do you I don't I just want to be in the right way I don't want to I I just want to Lord you work with that life Lord you deal with that life let my life be an encouragement Lord don't let my life be a demeaning to somebody else let it be an encouraging aware that somebody else as they get around me and they get around others that there's just such a sweetness of the spirit of God you you know sometimes we we confuse sweetness with compromise and we have that in our mind of well bless God we've got to stand Rock Solid on the gospel listen Sinners love to come around Jesus that's right but they hated the fair Pharisees that's good that's good is that right they hated him Pharisees look down on themen but they came around the Lord Jesus they wanted to come and be where he was at not because he would be a good old boy with him but because there was something real there was something that was real that would pulsate from his life that they wanted to be around the prophet called that atmosphere atmosphere beautiful Hallelujah so let me just leave this with you those of us you that's praying for your loved ones maybe they're not setting here the prophet would take this up you ain't listen to that message thy house in a while my what a what a masterpiece brother R preaches there in 1962 thy house am and he takes that up and he says in that message he says when you're praying he says you believe for your teenage son your older son your older daughter you say how do I believe you believe he said in the same way for what God has done for you that he will do the same thing for their life he said let me and this is how he this is how he links this together he said let me give you a little insight into my life brother bam how do you stand there on the platform night after night and here you are praying for people Visions coming brother BR says you understand he says that is because when he came to me he spoke to me told me he'd be with me and I believe him wow and so brother br takes that same experience that says now I've said that cuz that's how you're to apply it to your children but God has said to you he has spoke to your heart he has confirmed his word in your life he's confirmed his word in my life but brother Samuel I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do that brother Samuel How Will I Know The Prophet takes it up in the message desperation How will I know when the token has come he said I feel that in your minds he said look at what what your life was and look at what it is now the desires that was in your life before are no longer there and he said that's how you know when the token has come you're not doing something out of a legal mandate it's because I love the Lord and the desires has been changed Hallelujah we can stand with an assurance and when I'm praying for my loved ones praying for my children praying for other brothers praying for other sisters brother Bram says you may not live to see him come in but brother brandham says I've seen a many come to the Altar and said I hope my mama's looking down tonight and brother Bram said what it was he said it was a Mama's Prayer that was prayed over and over and over and over he said God knows how to get them God knows how to run them down God knows how to get a hold of their life what is it believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved it's the continuity of that life that took a hold of you cleaned you up did a work in your life and you know what it works through you you become a member of the body a coworker in Redemption it's the continuity of life because life travels through the body do you love him I just encourage you here this morning let him have all musicians would you come let him have it all let him have all of your life if you've never really fully surrendered maybe you're here this morning and you've never surrendered your life to the Lord look it all it all begins with a start friends there was a start point for me it wasn't just brother Samuel jumped up here Mo most a lot of you the older ones you know that it all began with a start it began with a point matter of fact right there in brother Bill's basement right next to a dog cage been out complete been out the night before and my daddy had had to they dropped me off at the doorsteps of our house and my daddy had to carry me in a come home from college had to carry me in and put me to bed last thing I remember is being out on the causeway last thing I remember that God who is rich in mercy God who is Rich of Mercy brother Samuel I'm ashamed of you hey I'm not the same guy but there's a there there is an example standing before you right now when I can preach of the grace and the mercy of God I'm not saying you had to be where I was at but I'm telling you right now where I was he reached down where I was I know what I'm talking about I know what it was to try to fight things of addictions and everything else I know what that was about I know what the promises was I'm not going to do this again I'm not going to do this again and find myself right back in it Hallelujah I know what that's about but I also know that there's a God who cares and he cared enough to come down Hallelujah when I was willing to get real desperate and say Lord I'll tell you what I prayed right there right there next to that dog cage and brother Bill's basement I said I'm sick of this life I'm tired of living this kind of life I'm tired of it I never forget my brother turned around to me we weren't in a church he said you want somebody to pray with you I said I do I do you think the enemy you think fears weren't coming around me at that time and said what are you going to do with your buddies you know your buddies you're supposed to meet them tonight y'all supposed to be out over there in the flats tonight you know you're supposed to meet them all those thoughts going through you know you've tried this before but that wasn't me trying something it was God moving on my heart I'm telling you the same God he moved in that moment in my life my life was committed to him I didn't worry about can I do this can I do this can I stop this it was a committal to him at that moment he Lifted Me Above the drinking he Lifted Me Above the immorals he lifted me in that moment what did that his grace and if God did that for me he'll do that for you he's no respector person if thou can't believe all things are possible Lord you believe that for your life he's more it's more than a church it's to know him in the power of his resurrection abolutely it's more than just well if I can try to understand all this if if I can try to make sense out of this if I can read myself and tell look look look look look you're you're trying you know what you're trying to do you're trying to figure out everything underneath the hood of the car but let the Chief mechanic come by let him come by who knows how to put everything together stop trying to read your way into it stop trying to study your way into it just say Lord I'm laying down all of my efforts I Want You Lord I'll tell you this morning maybe you need a real filling of the Holy Ghost I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost I want more of his presence I want more of his life I want a fresh refilling I want a refilling that wash es out all the trash everything of Samuel I want more of him to displace more of Samuel is that what you want it's a continuity of life we're a family church this is not only to a family within a home we are a family as a body of Believers this is our desire hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord could we just bow our heads hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah maybe you're here and say where do I start brother Samuel preacher where do I start it starts with accepting him as your savior just repent of your sins Lord in your presence I realize I'm a sinner I'm undone Lord I need you I heard what that man said up there of what you did for him the life that you took him from what he said that he didn't it wasn't him turning over new leaves and trying to do better he expressed it Lord how much he failed trying to do it on his own but when he accepted it that's when the things of the world begin to flee [Music] music man that couldn't even talk [Music] right I wonder this morning as our heads are bowed and eyes are closed you may not just be somebody who's visiting here it might be somebody that's sat here for years but in the presence of God you'd be want to be honest in his presence and say Lord that's what I want I want a full surrender right now would there be one I want a full surrender amen God bless your hands God bless you God bless you hallelujah wonderers we're gathered here Lord this continuity of life I want more Lord I want more of your life I need a I need a fresh filling of your spirit Lord not just on my spirit not on my flesh but Lord let it go down deep Lord I I need more of the love of God maybe you can maybe there's things that you can see in your life where you've gotten a little bit prickly a little bit careless or a little bit towards the things of God but right here in his presence you might say brother Samuel what good will that do why don't you just test the waters and see believe it say Lord I Need need it don't dispute with the life raft that's being thrown to you just take it this morning Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord Jesus for needs Lord throughout this building I'm standing here Lord with others Lord God I'm asking you Lord Jesus that you would move for every single need
