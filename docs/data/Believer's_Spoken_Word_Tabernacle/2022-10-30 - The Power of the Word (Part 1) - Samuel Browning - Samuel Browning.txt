Hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for that you know in the natural there's a lot of things that goes up and down there's a lot of the um everybody you know people look at the stock market and a lot of other things and where does the Dollar rank up and where does this rank up but I'm just grateful to God Amanda that the Precious Blood of the Lamb that we've been redeemed by you know it's never lost its power no it doesn't matter what goes on it doesn't matter the age and the time that we're standing in is just as powerful just as certain as it was when it was shed amen and the word already announced that Authority amen coming to us I'm grateful for that aren't you I'm grateful that the blood of Jesus Christ it still takes a life cleanses a life that that light that was within that blood cell can move down and bring forth a new creation I'm grateful to have that testimony that we we're not stepping back and saying well you know God used to do this and God used to do that but the Blood speaks better things it is the voice within that blood and that voice is still speaking it announces there is freedom there is Liberty there is Deliverance there is forgiveness there is salvation that word still holds within it the same power and authority we're living in a wicked day but we're living in a glorious day not for the world we're living in a glorious day because we're living in the very Eve of the coming of the Lord amen we we recognize in this moment of where we are standing hear the scriptures that have spoke to us in this hour that the Bible itself coming alive and coming open and all of it prophesying of this very hour that we are speaking in we're living in aren't you grateful my what a precious promise that we have Amen in the Lord I just want to welcome each and every one of you want to welcome our visitors God bless you and then good to have you here with us and just trust that the Lord will just just have his way amen that's what we want this morning isn't it amen and we just want to um turn our attention here in just a moment just to the word of God could let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer if you have a need or on your heart just make it known to the Lord and let's just invite him we we've we've not come here to be seen we've not come here just to just to fulfill a duty come here to have a meeting with him that's the purpose we're here we want to have a meeting with him we need to hear from him every one of us we need to hear from him let's just invite him Heavenly Father Lord as we just look to you this morning Lord father as we see God that even Lord as you would Lord admonish us Lord in your word look unto me all you ends of the world father we recognize we are here as Paul could say upon whom the ends of the world have come we are standing here Lord in this moment and Lord there is no other place for us to look Lord there's no other place oh God that Lord that we're able to look and to receive the strength and deliverance Lord and the help that we need like David Lord could say I will lift mine eyes and I will look unto the hills from which cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord a father behind every hand or God that is lifted up behind every heart Lord every life or God that has been gathered here this morning Lord we just ask that God that you'll just come in a very personal way Lord I pray that God that you would Lord help me Lord that I can step aside and get out of the way that you can just speak Lord so personally Lord the very things Lord that you've inspired upon our hearts Lord for this moment Lord yet Lord we know that God that he will take that same one God that gives the inspiration that you would come and Lord minister to our hearts come Lord oh God not just Lord as you hear Lord gathered with us but Lord we invite you to our heart Lord we invite you God to our Pew Lord that you administer Lord father as I invite you God to this platform Lord that you would be the speaker here Lord this morning God for the Lord the words of man will fail but the words of God can never fail Lord Heaven's on Earth will pass away but thy words shall never fail Lord we pray that God that you'll save to the other most Lord break Lord every hold oh God and Father fill with your spirit Lord bring Deliverance oh God we pray Lord in Salvation Lord and healing oh God May the anointing of the Holy Ghost just strike this place Lord this morning we pray as we give ourselves to you Lord for it's only with you Lord are we able to operate and to move Lord and we just want to be his surrendered vessels Lord now in this moment we surrender every thought Lord God we surrender our hearts surrender Our Lives oh God that you might come Lord in a special way Lord among us this morning Lord in the name of Jesus Christ For Your Glory we ask it Lord in Jesus name amen and amen I want to as as preparing to turn in the word I want to go into the scriptures into Ecclesiastes chapter 8. and uh I want to just also mention um our sister Charlene she's going to be leaving here right after the service and heading back to South Africa so we just want to say God bless you we miss you men and we look for your return [Applause] things at times do not go maybe as we have planned but we know that if we can just say God what my plans are but you have plans and I give myself to your plans amen because God's plans we we might be disappointed in our own selves and this is for every one of us but we can when it all is said and done we can look back and say God how I'm so thankful that your plans were at work amen aren't you glad amen I also want to remind her this is uh brother George Smith will be here this coming Thursday to minister to us and we want to just remember that I also wanted to kind of clarify a point about um with the meetings next weekend with brother Wayne Lawson coming in um I really don't think I we should have to clarify this by now but let me just try to settle it so it'll be done for the future anytime there is a youth meeting let me just say it like this even if I'm not the pastor I'm going to be here I can walk down through here and say that you say brother Sammy but you're not a young person but I'm here pulling for him I'm here pulling for him and I understand if you've got a job or you've got something but I when I'm I'm coming here I'm coming here pulling for them and I also know God is here to meet all of our needs but I look at it like this to me you say Where's that in the scripture well David when he came up next to the battle before he ever put the slingshot in his hand the Bible said he shouted for the battle that's what the Bible said he shouted for the battle because David what David was looking at David did not even see the fear that was in the camp of Israel people who were ordained to be Covenant people that God himself in the midst of Israel that there wasn't a devil that could stand in their way because of God and that's what David was looking at when he shouted for the battle then as David got in there and he got to recognize these people are paralyzed with fear but David was a channel that welcomed God back in the camp David became a channel in that moment that when there was fear and there was doubt he became a channel that the supernatural could drop down and take that big giant that all the rest of them are looking at and trembling and and they didn't have the armor and David went out there and David said I'm not coming to you in my name all right I am coming against you in the name of the Lord God of Israel that's how I'm meeting you and this is how we meet every devil in the name of Jesus Christ for at the name of Jesus Christ every devil has to bow amen and remember the Bible says his name is called the word of God so when his word is being preached that's his name being magnified glory be to God so is that clear yes yes we want to pull on the gift of God there are needs that are here Among Us all of us and with with the young people this is I said to you you may not understand it but you know it's a burden that God had put on my heart for a few years because I see a need not just here I see a need in this area and God put that on my heart and that's why that's why that I'm doing it the pastor's around that I've contacted we've already I've already let that be communicated and they're here to support it and so with their young people as well so we just want to get behind what God's doing is that right that's what I want to do I want to get behind what God's doing this
