he's so wonderful isn't he amen it's a wonderful wonderful time to be a christian a wonderful time to serve the lord it's a terrible time for the world but it's a wonderful time to be serving the lord it's a wonderful time to know we have a sure foundation amen there's a clear direction amen of where we're going know who we are know who it is that's in our midst amen and to know that he's the god of his word he fulfills his word right to the letter he doesn't ask us to in ourselves to fulfill it he just asked us believe it and when we believe it we we act in faith and we know that god he will do what only he can do amen we're just so so grateful for the grace of god this morning thankful to have brother carmen mills here with with us and he'll be ministering the word of the lord to us this morning in just a few moments and uh he had quite an ordeal getting here he was supposed to come in yesterday to be here and as i told you before he wanted to come by just to fellowship and i told him months ago i said well you're not just going to come and fellowship with me if you're coming you're going to speak for me because that's what a real friend would do and it'd be a blessing to the to the body of jesus christ so needless to say all of those things sometimes with um customs and there's certain things they change here or there needless to say he didn't get into his hotel last night till one in the morning so we were able to get him there from the airport after 12 after midnight and so i just i look at it like this with everything that's taken place i just seen it yesterday and we prayed for each time maybe he'd make this connecting this bag would go through and so forth but i told him on the phone i said i'll tell you what's happening satan's fighting this satan's fighting it because god knows god there's things that god's arranged this there's things that god has in store for us this morning and i believe that with all my heart i don't believe meetings or services are just in a coincidence i i don't believe that at all i i watch even as a pastor here i watch how god will change a direction to where as i told you last week i stood here on sunday morning with two outlines which way do i go god knows what he's doing and if how much more god will direct and bring everything around and god will take a gift in a man's life that well for many of you you don't know brother carmen first time you'll meet him but you watch god come down and use that gift he's the same god that came down and stood before abraham's tent door he's the same god who stood there when the pharisees couldn't recognize who he was the greeks couldn't recognize who he was but the believers that were ordained to life could recognize though they couldn't explain it that there is one behind the veil that's doing the speaking and let me just say that that same lord jesus the son of man is right here with us this morning he's the same almighty god he's the same god that dissolves the doubts in sarah's heart the same god who moved to a place to where sarah could look at the word and judge him faithful and receive the strength that was needed in order to bring forth he's the same god this morning and if we can just say god let my eyes be so keen on that let my eyes of our heart be so open to recognize lord you and the needs that i have in my life are right in you and they can be released to me this morning just invite him even as the words come and just invite him because god will take the man of god and direct that gift and god will he's going to speak to us this morning i have the utmost confidence in that brother carmen he and i had met one another uh been over about four years ago there at byc and uh just just really connected just really had a good friendship and things around the word of god to where just such a openness here i you know i've i've got i've got quite a bit of friends like that that you don't have to worry about am i going to step here they believe this or you know i just first of all you just like just let's just be ourselves and we can just lay it all out and i love that and brother carmen he's just that kind of a of a brother and i believe you're really going to be blessed this morning also right after brother carmen ministers we're going to have the baptismal service with sister judith is here to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and so any of the other visitors we have here god bless you even my brother back there god bless you this morning amen good to have you back with us amen then this evening or this afternoon i i don't know we'll see where the service will go i'm thinking four o'clock right now but uh for the communion and foot washing but we'll just have to see the way the morning service goes in the time and the reason i've done that instead of always setting a time is because we have even people traveling in and i don't i don't want to create a long lag between the services so we'll just um would that be okay you look and say what other choice do we have but really we try to do is there's not a lag so you don't have to find somewhere to go you can get a bite to eat and then we can come back and have the communion and foot washing and i'm looking at tentatively if possibly that that could probably work at 4 pm but we will set that in stone here right at the end of the of the morning service and so i think that's that's it uh also the prayer requests different ones we've been offering up prayer um for you know continue to keep brother ron spencer in your prayers god will just continue to move for our brother in a special way as well as for sister erica parker for the donny's daughter that we just continued to remember her in prayer both of them dealing with with cancer and um just asking brother donnie was just asking that uh we'd pray that her body would respond to the treatment that she's that she's been going through so we just want to remember them in prayer continue to remember them upon your heart sister linda cavillo as well i just continue to remember them upon your heart and our sister as well she's in very good spirits she's strong everything that she's come through and we just and i just say it like this as he as these needs come to you throughout the day just pray for him you might be at work you might be walking through the supermarket wherever it's at even at that point in time and even outside of your prayer closet just pray for them just bring them up in prayer say god just just move lord for sister linda move lord for those different needs and um god is mindful we want to lift the special offering this morning for the building project as well and i almost forgot that i'm glad the brothers stood up back there and so if they'll come this morning we'll just ask prayer and then right after we ask prayer and they're taking that up we'll ask and invite brother carmen to come and just minister the word of the lord amen this morning how many just desired god to have his way he said god just have your way this morning amen i'm just gonna i'm just gonna say amen to the word i'm gonna let the word just speak to my heart this morning heavenly father how we thank you lord for this precious opportunity we have this morning to come together lord as believers of light precious faith dear god where when we come into these moments lord it's such an anticipation and an expectation of what that you are going to do and lord we have an expectation according to your word that god that you will come and are here to move lord upon lives and hearts to bring transformation god to bring healing to bring deliverance lord salvation and father we just invite you that you'll just continue to move in your presence even as the word is being spoken god may our brother lord is just the gift in his life that god it'll just be a settling in just the lord just sensing lord that that kindredness of the holy ghost lord among us lord that you'll just take that gift and speak to our hearts lord god lord we ask that you bless lord the offering lord that is being raised here lord for this project lord that's taking place lord we pray that god you'll just lord bless the worshipers lord as they sacrifice lord and their giving lord i pray that god you'll take it and multiply it oh god and just continue to lead and guide and direct us lord we love you this morning father may you bless this entire day o god we pray father the baptismal service lord the communion and foot washing oh god may you just lord move among us lord throughout the day we pray in a special way we ask you in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you as you give us unto the lord amen we just want to invite brother carmen brian just said what's on your heart [Music] words according to your promises i can stand secure [Music] the truth that sets me free [Music] according to me [Music] according to your lord to your promises [Music] [Music] upon my heart the truth that sets me [Music] [Applause] according to your word oh [Music] lord well it's good to be with you this morning good to be in the house of the lord this morning how many of you come looking for the lord to speak that's good because i don't have anything to offer but he certainly does man and so if we can just get ourselves as often as said we can get ourselves out of the way and just let him use us just like this microphone allows you to hear me then maybe he can say something to you one nice thing and i like about going to a new place is is you know i don't know yet i know brother sanchez i know our brother and his family i don't know you but he does and i'll speak very direct and things like that but you know if the pastor says it you can say well he was preaching right at me but if i do it you can say god was preaching right at me so because i don't know you and i and i'll tell you in advance i'm not here to to bring anything new i'm not here to try to make an impression i don't do that but if the lord could use me to help somebody for the derral ward you all know him he preaches a message he calls it his icebreaker message called for the sake of one and i i really like to operate that way so sometimes even how the lord leads me i may speak on the subject i'm speaking on this morning might only resonate with one or two i'm not concerned about if everybody gets something out of it i want to i want to be able to be used for that one that may be in a particular spot maybe there can be something said for that one because jesus you know would would go long journey sometimes for the sake of one and so if i can just be yielded to the lord maybe he can speak to one amen so just just a short background before we pray we're from uh eastern canada into brunswick just east of maine been there for well i've been there all my life the church was established in the late 60s or maybe in 1970 we built a church a message come our way in the mid latter 60s my father was in pentecost at the time when he received the message and then brother carr who's currently the pastor still the pastor there and preaching at 92 years old and preaching the message ever since he came in just shortly after my father my father was not called to the ministry but he was we've always supported the work there and i married one of his his daughters and so he's my father and i assist there in the ministry i minister every week there and the lord has done some amazing things over the years we certainly have seen the hand of god move our church is called works of faith assembling we certainly have seen god work when we've been able to acquire faith god has some miraculous things at times and healings and supernatural things but we've also seen the devil work as you have too you know he certainly makes his presence known but but we still serve a living god and is able to do anything that he ever did he can do today i believe that so uh so i was raised a little bit in the pentecostal church but i was young when we came out of it into the message so i'm one of those message kids as you might say but been serving the lord for over 50 years in the message and i've been preaching for about 40 maybe a little over 40 years preaching this message so uh i still believe it's true i still believe it's enough to get us through i don't believe there's any other message we need i believe it's enough we can just apply ourselves to it amen so this morning i'll get you to stand as we would pray and that and as was already mentioned i want to remember sister eric brother donnie reached out to me this morning to say that sister eric is going for treatments again tomorrow and asked if we would pray and i told him i was here visiting that i would mention it to you folks so just remember her as as my brother mentioned in your prayers not just now but later i got i have daughters and i i know if it was my daughter i'd want everybody i could get a hold of to pray and so that's why i really would not like us to reach out for her today but also down the road because many times these trials are not just a day or two you know they drag on and you need faith for those rough times and so i just believe the lord can minister to her need and and everybody's need today let's just let's just come speak to the lord this morning lord we come to you lord recognizing that in ourselves we have no value at all lord our efforts are worth nothing lord if it isn't for your grace and mercy to work in us and through us and so this morning we come to you lord we come and appeal to your grace to reach out to those that are in need today we think of sister erica that's going for these cancer treatments brother spencer also with dealing with cancer for a number of years now and and others lord we ask that your hand of mercy would reach down upon them once again lord and touch their bodies and bring them healing and if it it be that you're taking them through this route to their healing lord we we're fine but lord just give them strength and give them faith as they go through this trial lord bless this part of the service this morning again we offer ourselves to you that you would take complete and utter control of this vessel that lord i would not have any of my own thoughts or words to to say but it may be yours lord and for those that are here that are in need and maybe they don't even know they have a need but you do lord and may you speak to them we pray through your word this morning we ask in jesus name amen let us read from exodus chapter 15 two verses of scripture verses 22 and 23. exodus 15 verses 22 23 so moses brought israel from the red sea they went out into the wilderness of shore and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water when they came tomorrow they could not drink of the waters of mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara it may be seated i want to speak this morning on the thought of bitterness and in a little while i want to speak on the root appearance and as i said you know this this migrate over the top of people's heads because it's not relevant you're not in that situation but uh there might be one here there might be somebody you know i've spoken this a number of places and i was quite surprised in myself of the people that connected with it and the people that were struggling with this thing sometimes we think well we're so far along that these things shouldn't even be an issue anymore but you know we're not all in the same place in our walk every church you know you have people that are so far along you have people that are just starting out and and so we have these struggles and of course all of us no matter how far we are along the devil is is after us so he walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour you're not immune from his attacks the prophet said there's there's never a day that goes by that the devil is not punching at you and i think if you serve the lord you know that to be true he doesn't give you much of a break the bible says you know to resist the devil and he will flee from you but he doesn't flee for very long not very long and he's back you're in a service you're in a youth camp you know how many times i've spoke to the youth and they get so excited at these youth camps and and they have an experience i remember a young man that we brought from home he hadn't been going to church him and his brother hadn't been going to church but they wanted to go to youth camp and sir come to youth camp and and they come to the youth camp and the older brother the younger brother nothing happened he went back the same but the older brother seemed to really get a hold of something we thought you know we were thinking maybe he did he was a bit more social he got in with the youth and he really seemed to like something was happening and he got caught up in the atmosphere of the meeting and even at one point when they had testimonies he he stood up and talked about how the lord had met him and had freed him from from things you know and so we were very happy to hear that but once you get out of that atmosphere and we drove back home he never actually came back to church again he went immediately back to the same place he left and so the devil never leaves you alone but when you're in these environments of of camp and even in service this morning as the spirit of the lord might begin to work you're going to start to feel something maybe and the lord begins to and you feel confident but but sometimes we don't press all the way through and get that real deliverance we need so then you walk out and as soon as you're out that door the devil won't bother you in here but when you go at that door when you're alone away from the people he comes in but if god really comes down and doesn't work in your life then you've got somebody that's there with you the bible says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me but if you don't have that then you're like the sons of skiva you try to rebuke the devil and he says who are you who are you but you know if god comes in a lot can be done and you can overcome anything the devil throws your way as we look at the scripture here israel had come out of egypt went through the red sea and you remember they were rejoicing three days before the scripture they were rejoicing thanking the lord they saw a miracle take place of god and yet three days after they encounter a trial in the wilderness and all of a sudden they're murmuring and they're complaining how quickly the sound of the timbrel timbrel changed to the sound of murmuring how easily it is and all of a sudden they're murmuring what's going on what are we going to do you brought us out into the wilderness and all of these things how quickly how quickly after a great meeting you know when the power of god comes and all of a sudden the devil comes right after and you think and he tries to undo everything that you've you've thought you've gained in those services in those meetings and in those times we'll say sometimes you know make great statements when the lord's presence is among us i shall not be moved i'll stand and yet tomorrow we're tossed about on the stormy seas how easily it is you know with humanity we're changeable there's so much about this world that is changeable with god we know he's the unchangeable god but with us things change a lot and so the only thing that we can really have confidence in are the things not so much the things we see but the things that we don't see and so they they come to this place these bitter waters of mara and they had been used to the waters of the nile in egypt great waters good waters to drink now they're coming to these bitter waters of mara and what were they going to do what was going to happen they began to get bitter it was a bitter experience in a very literal sense and so as we as we introduce this thought of bitterness i wanted to define it firstly bitterness is a is a is a chronic and a pervasive state of smoldering resentment that's how it's defined sometimes it's it's described as as holding on to or showing feelings of resentment animosity or vindictiveness other words we use to describe bitterness sometimes are are are people who are merciless who are unforgiving or hold a grudge and often with bitterness a person who's bitter has a perception that some injustice has been done to them the bible says in the proverbs that a brother offended is harder harder to be won than a strong city we have to be careful in our testimony i i've known people that have been so zealous for god that they're careless in some ways and very vending to people in the world that may be living not such good lives and instead of being a testimony for the lord the prophet said there needs to be an attractiveness to the gospel but sometimes we are so vindictive that the world looks at us and said why would i want to have what you have you preach at them and then you say i want you to be like me well they don't want to be like you brother branham said we need to project love that's the only thing that's going to save the sinner is the love of god not the vindictiveness and not that kind of approach but this bitterness as we take this example in the scripture where did it come from well in the case of mara it came you know the waters and the earth are really generally pure but they come up through these desert sands and they type the earth and that earth in fact the desert sands was what tainted the water and made it bitter and we know that earth is a type of sin when god supplied water you remember came out of the rock didn't come from the earth and so a lot of times the experiences with the lord that should be sweet to us sometimes because of our own sins and our own failings cause those experiences to be bitter when otherwise they should be sweet and so but what's interesting about this this situation that god put them in he knew they were going to be facing this trial and so we have better trials too and he knows every trial that comes before it arrives so yesterday when i come here i had all plans to be here in the middle of the afternoon i had a delayed flight but i had a big layover i thought i had lots of time and then it was just chaos as i missed the flight and all these things that i they had to go through and it would have been very easy and very tempting to get bitter and angry and frustrated but i've learned a long time ago that doesn't really help a whole lot and in this day and age if you're in an airport and you get frustrated very much it could cause you lots of grief as you know so but god knows how and god wasn't i was surprised that all this happened in some ways but god knew it was going to happen before i did and he knew what the solution would be before i did and how it was going to be and how it would work out and so you know god never gets frustrated he never gets upset he's never shocked we get shocked we get surprised but he never is because he knows everything he knows everything that's going to take place he knows the end from the beginning well god knows how to sweeten the bitter waters of any trial that we face he knows how to do that and when there is a problem that you face when there is a trial that you face there's always a remedy spurgeon once said that as as soon as we have a prayer god has a remedy but that's the thing when we have the trial do we pray about it do we go to the lord and say i have this thing i don't know what to do about it or do we just charge in and try to solve it ourselves often we just make things worse when we do that prayer is always the answer that we should start with not end with and say lord what is this about i don't know what it's about i don't know where it's going but but i need some help and we could criticize israel for their unbelief and say well they should have knew better they look what god just did for them but but how often have we done the same thing as that how often have we done the same thing and so god you know always has a remedy for every problem for every trial for every test he has a remedy and and often the remedy is in place there before the trial is even there that's the interesting part about it and the interesting thing here in the scripture if you notice in this scripture we're still in exodus 15. i want to i want to draw your attention to exodus 15 and verse 25. so moses did as in a good example to us the bible says he cried unto the lord that's what he should have did we have a problem here lord what are we going to do but notice what happens here the lord showed him a tree where did that tree come from you know that tree was always there a tree grew sometime dozens of years ago maybe hundreds of years ago sea germinated up a sitting there lived its entire life for this moment that was its purpose it was born as jesus was born to die that was his purpose it was ignored how many people would have walked out there walked by those waters walked in the desert perhaps and saw this tree and never gave it no heed but it had a great purpose it just hadn't fulfilled it yet but it was there it was the remedy the problem just hadn't arrived yet but the remedy was already there the tree was there and of course he cuts down the tree the tree had to give its life in this case to answer the problem it cast the tree into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made them a statue in an ordinance and he proved them and so you know for every bitter well there is a healing tree for every door that's locked there's a key for every trouble in your life in my life there's a remedy god has a remedy and often that remedy is there on hand before the trial is there but we sometimes can't see it the tree was there they were all there they saw the tree but they didn't know that was their answer they didn't know that's what that was going to get them out of their problem but it was there and we know the cross jesus came to die on a cruel tree as it were we know that in that lies the answer and in there lies the power to make any bitter trial sweet any bitter waters sweet when a believer suffers an important thing to understand is sometimes we equate suffering with punishment but there is no wrath of god in a believer's suffering there is no wrath of god when when when suffering comes to a believer it's not coming so much from god's hand like we would discipline our children but it's really coming from his heart you remember the scripture in the new testament that talks about how fathers raised their children and said you know they chastise us for their benefit for their profit how many fathers and mothers sometimes you know they get angry and they discipline their children because they're frustrated but the bible says when he chastises us it's always for us our benefit always for us every test every trial every suffering you go through it's for us it's for our good it's for some purpose that god has everything god does to a believer is with intention it's not arbitrary it's with intention and it's for your benefit therefore trials are not to make us bitter but better they're to make us better not bitter and so the other thing to notice about this scripture before we move on is that god did not say okay these waters are no good i'm going to take you over here and give you good water he took the same waters that were bitter and made them sweet you've heard that song probably you know sometimes the lord calms the storm but sometimes he calms me he doesn't always take you out of the trial he doesn't always remove the trial sometimes he just allows you to get through it and makes that bitter trial sweet it's not always about sometimes we pray lord deliver me deliver me take me out of this no that there may be a purpose for that but he can make that trial something manageable something tolerable something that's not a bitter experience because the prophet has said that god doesn't want us to be unhappy he made us human beings were made to be happy we were designed that way and god wants that but that doesn't mean we're not going to have trial there's a story uh i'll relate it i have a lot here so i don't want to do it if everyone knows it's about the carrots the eggs and the coffee beans have you heard that okay a young woman went to her mother complaining about her life and how things were so hard for her she didn't know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up and it's surprising this was a young woman going to remind it's a story but there's a lot of truth to it and i can tell you that in the real world there are a lot of young not just young women but young people even children my my my wife works in the art as a nurse there and there i hear stories many times of young children sometimes 9 10 years old to come in that want to commit suicide that feel they have no purpose in life they don't see anything they don't see any future well a child that age that should not even be a thought that enters their mind but that's the kind of age that we live in and so she was like that this woman she was just didn't know how she was going to make it so tired of fighting well the mother brought her into the kitchen and she took three pots and put them on the stove and put water in them and set them to boil she put raw carrots in one eggs in the other and beans in the third one coffee beans and she let them go for about 20 minutes she turned off the burners brought them out put the carrots on in a bowl and the egg and then the coffee was there and she said what do you see and of course she didn't see a whole lot more than what started carrots eggs and coffee and she said what's the point well the mother started to explain to her that each of these these objects faced the same adversity which was the boiling water but each of them reacted in a different way so you had the raw carrots they they went in hard unrelenting you know people like that tough but the bitterness of trials and experiences and you may all know people like that i know people like that that had an answer for everything but over the years those trials beat them down i had a brother tell me one time his children went to the world one became homosexual and things and he just said he said i i don't have any fight left in me and so that's what trials can do now the egg's very different it was soft and malleable you see people like that too just very fragile with the bitterness of trials and the adversity of the hot water they become hard-boiled become hard very opposite to what it started but the coffee beans was very different the coffee beans transformed the water the very thing that should have destroyed it was the thing that actually brought out what good is what's the coffee and so which one are you that's what she asked her i asked you i asked me which one am i when trials come that adversity comes how do you respond what does it do to you does it change you or do you change it you change the circumstance if you are like the coffee bean then when things are at their worst you get better and you change the situation around you how do you handle adversity how do you handle trials paul said in romans you know that we glory the tribulations knowing the tribulations worketh patience remember these things are always with intent god wants to bring there's some good things in you and then me and so these trials are not designed to make us bitter or or the the way the carrots and the eggs are no it's designed to bring out these attributes of god that he puts in your life and it takes the trial to do that so we shouldn't reject that we shouldn't say i don't want that no it's and not that we embrace them either nobody wants a trial but understanding that when it comes it must be that god has something he wants to do with me trials as i said are to make us better not bitter in fact the bible says in psalms you know the scripture when david talked about search me oh god know me and try me try me david actually prayed that the lord would try me and know my thoughts now you know if we meet these trials head on and god delivers us take us through then the bitter experiences that we have don't have to be something that develops into a much more serious problem that we want to go to look at in hebrews and that is something called the root of bitterness i want to go to hebrews 12 and verse begin at verse 14 and 15 and we're going to kind of tear these scriptures apart a little bit and and see what we can learn of it hebrews 12 14 and 15. it says to follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord notice the verse 15 that we're going to focus on looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god so notice the advice and then where he goes with it lest any men fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so we are warned in the scripture not to fail not to be left behind not to miss the grace of god and what is the issue it's this root of bitterness springing up well let's talk about that this root of bitterness we know what a root is it's something that germinates underground it stays underground as long as it's rooted and the roots are generally always underground they're not visible to the naked eye we can't see the roots conditioned from above the ground generally it can lie dormant sometimes for months it can even lie dormant for years in some cases and such is the case with the root of bitterness there's a tree i read about called the chinese bamboo and the chinese bamboo has a root that forms in it for something like four years and in the fifth year so it grows underground undetected you could walk over it don't even know it's there and then in the fifth year it springs forth and it says about the chinese bamboo that it can grow to 90 feet in six weeks growing as much as three feet in a single day so that's how powerful this springing for because we want to take this analogy to the scripture here in a moment something else another example i want to just highlight as we go minister one time tells a story that in the springtime he went out and found something on the ground that looked like a the way he described it looked like the lid off of a of an indian basket that's how we described it it was like a woven perfectly flat he took it he brought it into the house and when it get in the house where it was warm the thing suddenly uncoiled and he realized that it was a snake so there was a trigger there the heat and just like with root of bitterness as we'll talk about sometimes the heat of trials at that root that's there that is what causes it to spring forth but before we talk about how about the springing forth we need to talk about how does this thing form in the first place of where so that we can watch out because we don't want any bitter experience and trial that we face has the potential to become one of these roots of bitterness but you know a root this is very simple stuff but it's very true and so for anyone who knows anything about gardening you know what does it take for a root to form well it takes two things it takes a seed and it takes soil you just need seed and salt that's all you need but you got to have both the seed of bitterness is something we all have experienced and that is a hurt some kind of a hurt something's happened to hurt you and every one of us have been hurt in our lifetime you can't live in this world and not be hurt sometimes it's intentional sometimes you know there's just people in the world that are just that are just nasty they're just do things to hurt and they do it deliberately but i want to make the point that it doesn't matter how the hurt comes that's not the point it's still a seed of hurt and it still has that potential it's what you do with it whether or not it becomes a root of bitterness it could be intentional it could be unintentional and there's a lot of those that happen i had a sister come to me one time apologizing for something that i she thought or and i couldn't even relate to it i didn't know what it was i didn't have any animosity i didn't have you know but sometimes people get offended over something that there was never any intention but it's still a hurt to them it's still real to them when they have that experience and and we shouldn't be dismissive of it i've known people to get upset you know over just small things sometimes but it's real to them it's a real problem to them and then they get hurt sometimes it's real sometimes it's intentional sometimes it's unintentional sometimes it's just imagined there wasn't nothing at all nothing even happened somebody you know you walk by somebody they don't shake your hand you've all heard that you know the preacher didn't shake your hand well it you know sometimes i've walked by people many times their minds on something you walk right by them maybe they had their hands i didn't see it you know but people know me enough now to know i would never do that you know there's a saying and it's not even from any religious person that it says you know that when men speak ill of you it's actually from plato which is not that i follow philosophy but i i like if it's true it's true when men speak ill of you live so that nobody believes them and that's always been my principle i've had people say things you know but when i look at that someone who says something about me that's untrue i look at it sometimes and i say well they they clearly don't know me the people that know me which are the ones i care about the person out in the world that doesn't like me if there is somebody like that or has this idea that's false i'm not going to waste my time especially if they're a critic trying to answer it the people that i care about the people that know me they know how i live they'll they know whether that statement is accurate or not because of the way i've lived i believe you can live down a lie you can live down these things and so so it's a hurt that's how it starts it's a seed but then the seed needs soil and that soil is is the heart that will harbor the hurt that will nourish that will dwell upon it that will basically feed it and that's kind of what happens so that hurt comes and you you you begin to take it personal and you maybe you don't you don't deal with it the way you should and rooted out before it has a chance but you you dwell on and then something else happens and it just keeps it keeps growing and none of those things individually that contribute to the growth of that by themselves are are worth even the attention that you're giving it but it nevertheless has that effect and so the root begins to form and it begins to grow but most of us you know we we we have these bitter experience we have something somebody hurts us we deal with it we move on but some people don't deal with it and move on and sometimes it's very hard there are things that have happened to people in this world that when i look at it i think i don't know how i would deal with that sometimes and i'm going to talk about some of that but but still the grace of god is greater than anything that you can experience i believe that god is able to heal any hurt that happens there are people that have done some very terrible things and we look at them out there in the world but they could be people that come to the lord and all of a sudden they have this baggage in their life something happened they were abused or whatever all kinds of things they have to be able to move on from that god is able to free them from that now as this root's forming it's as i said it's hidden from you but sometimes there's some little things that leak out in a person's personality and their character because you know there are these things are inside but they do affect you to a certain extent even before they spring forth if i was to ask today if anyone here felt they were bitter probably nobody would admit it that's one of the things one of the problems with it too because if you have a root of bitterness you know you can't even begin to be free of it until you acknowledge that it's there god has to reveal to you that it's actually a problem and i've had people i've spoken this i've had people come up i couldn't even believe that had roots of bitterness in their lives that you know sometimes from years and so so you have to know it has to be revealed that it's that it's there but these little traits you can kind of see kind of exaggerated emotions sometimes now this doesn't mean that everybody that has these traits i mentioned is bitter i'm not saying that but though people that are bitter you'll notice certain things that are common for example they can often be very sensitive they can be touchy easily offended people that are bitter now some people are they may not be bitter but this is certainly a trait sometimes of people who are harboring these bitter roots they're often judgmental critical moody and can be withdrawn they're not very good at expressing gratitude when they do express things it's either that they're harshly critical or vainly flattering but it's not really genuine it's it's with that criticalness in it they're ones that are known to hold grudges sometimes for a long time they're and they have a very hard time to forgive it's one of the big things is this difficulty to forgive the bible says you can't be forgiven unless you forgive as far as their personality well it can vary they can be like a porcupine they have a lot of good points but they're not very nice to be around they can be like an iceberg very cold solid indifferent sour or they could be whiny over with self-pity over every little thing and clearly exaggerated emotions over things that really most people wouldn't even be bothered by and you know those little symptoms leak out but when it becomes a problem of course is that at some point it it it springs forth and that's what we want to we come we want to come to but it in it infiltrates the lives of pretty much everyone there's people that are bitter in all walks of life it's not just the poor or uneducated but it's everyone that experiences and it's certainly christians are not immune or people that come to church are certainly not immune to getting these bitter roots the bible speaks about how that is and it's in families a lot too now that husbands should love their wives there's a scripture that says love your wives and be not bitter against them but sometimes instead of being the bitter half or better half we are the bitter half we can be and so even in churches you can have and of course every there's nobody here like that i'm sure you can have bitter brothers and sour sisters in the church but it's the thing about it is when it's when it springs forth and i've seen it spring forth it's not pleasant to see but if you notice the scripture if you if you go back to hebrews uh the scripture we read because i said we want to take it apart a little bit i want you to notice the first symptom in hebrews 12 and 15 where it says lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you the first symptom the first issue with this root of bitterness when it springs up and even before it springs up to be quite honest it's going to give you trouble even though the bitterness that's in your heart if you have it often is directed to someone else perhaps maybe even to god and but it's your the one that's going to suffer for having it the very fact that it's there this bitterness will trouble you it bitterness is like an acid that destroys its own container it is it blows out the candle of joy it affects your mood and everything but it can also affect you physically and i'm going to read a quote of brother branham's but before i do that i'm going to talk about just some basic medical things here it can affect you physically something i learned when i looked at this well even maybe before is is our brains the way our brains are made we have a part of our brain which is known as the limbic system and it's where our emotional center resides and we know that you know there's parts of our brain that control our mobility and allow us to move our limbs but what many people don't realize and i didn't at one time is that the emotional center of our brain has nerve connections that connect to every organ of our body which means that your emotional state can have an effect on literally almost every bodily function that you have that means that turmoil in the emotional center of the brain can actually cause impulses to be sent that can result from anything from a headache to itching in the bottom of your feet and sometimes even more severe things it does it in three primary ways it changes the blood flow to the organs your emotional state can change the blood photo organs it changes the secretion of certain glands and it changes the tension of your muscles that's how it primarily does it one of the most common examples we all know of is embarrassment when you're embarrassed and there's a lady i just hired to be an assistant manager and she is one of these ones that gets that gets red in the face easily and i told her i said no we've hired you but we haven't talked to the other candidate who happened to work in the same office so don't tell nobody and every office has a busy body and so her her friend you know wanted to know if she got the job because it was a little while if you got the job i think you got the job and she kept coming in and pressing her well after we told her she was pressing her some more and she said i was trying to avoid it but she said i kept getting red in the face so she never actually told her anything but she basically gave it away and she had no control of that but it was because of her emotional condition she was very happy that she got the job and all of that and all of a sudden her face is getting red she didn't want it to get red she didn't have any control of it and so but that was just the emotions at work when people are nervous and they stand up in front of a crowd and they're not ones used to speaking in public their mouth will dry get dry they'll stop secreting saliva you don't want to do that but it happens you almost can't speak sometimes and i've had it happen you know where you that's why you have water sometimes you do get that and you just you don't want that to happen but it does emotional stress can affect the tone of your muscles people's muscles will tighten up when they're angry or when they're frightened to produce pain it's why people with chronic anxiety often suffer severe headaches because of the anxiety and so it's it it's there's an area of medicine they call psychosomatic medicine cycle of the mind it's home of the body and uh so that's kind of where some of this comes from but even back in time in wartime just to give you some examples there were men in world war ii one time that a bunch of them were parachuting over uh near germany i believe it was or in a particular area and they began to get fired at by the germans and of course that fear another strong emotion actually was so powerful that it affected their intestines which are used to move foods through and and without getting too graphic about it you know some things happen that they didn't intend to happen again because of that emotion of fear when they bombed the english cities in world war one i believe it was there was thousands of civilians after they bombed the cities the next day that complained of chest pain of heart pain they didn't have any issues with their heart but they complained of it and i actually experienced this myself in 2016 i was building the house that i live in now i was built in the house working full-time preaching every week and for about a year and a half and then one weekend i got a break a chance for a break wasn't really a break but i was i flew to montreal to preach a couple of services and for some reason that change of pace when i and it's first time it happened to me i've had it happen a few times since i i flew to montreal and the brother picked me up at the airport and as we're driving the hotel i began to experience severe chest pain that radiated through my back i got weak and clammy and all a lot of the symptoms that go with the heart i called my wife i i know from my history i knew i wasn't having a heart attack i wasn't concerned about it because i've had many tests and different things before but i still was concerned enough that you know i was having a hard time to function i was getting sick so called my wife and she thought yeah probably should get a check she didn't think it was either but we should you know so i went in i was in the hospital for 10 hours they ran all kinds of tests on me couldn't find anything no reason for it and i went home did a bunch of other tests stress tests all kinds of things no issues with my heart whatsoever but i have noticed in the last five years i've had it maybe once or twice a year there would be certain times certain stressful times maybe physical maybe uh mental due to things that were going on that would trigger these things sometimes i can stop them and sometimes it can't they last for 20 minutes sometimes half an hour i had it happen most recently when i was in virginia after preaching for brother mike walsh i never told him about it uh maybe a day or so we went driving to visit brother lloyd went to have some lunch and as soon as i stepped out of the car i had it and it lasted about 20 minutes extremely painful somehow it's stress related never been able to find anything they thought they would check some gastro but it it's been very rare very intermittent now i don't don't ever take this as as your solution if you have this problem you should always get things checked out but in my case they ran every test they could they don't have an answer for it but i do believe that so there was a there was a british physician in the 18th century by the name of john hunter and he was a pioneer in in in the in the field of surgery and he had angina an angina is caused by you know an inadequate blood supply to the heart and he he noticed that his angina attacks would be triggered by because he had a temper when he would get angry it would trigger these things so he made a statement one time which turned out to be quite prophetic for him he said the first scoundrel that gets me angry is going to kill me and so it happened to be that sometime after that he was in a meeting with a bunch of with a board of directors uh it was at st george's hospital in london and they were meeting and he got in a heated argument with some of the board members and he and he walked out of the room into the next room but when he did he felt dead of a heart attack so it comes back to this you know psycho cement not that not everything can be explained away by that but it's here's what i want you to read to you from the message brother brown said in the infallibility of god's spoken word 1956 i'll say this i'll preface it this quote with this statement that it is most certain that you can be sick and not be bitter that's for sure but it's just a certain that if you harbor a bitter root for a long period of time it will affect you somehow physically you will have an effect from it it will affect you it will scripture says trouble you brother brown says this he said i was telling the boys a while ago i said about how we must be happy all the time god doesn't want you to be sad do you know what ill temper does he say that old temper is one of the awfulest old things he said it's about sixty percent of the cause of all sickness is temper 60 of the cause of all sickness he said his temper yes he said them tantrums you fly loose which often is how the bitter uh root it springs forth is usually in some sort of an emotional he said them tantrums you fly loose he said remember you're just developing a cancer an ulcer or something like that when you do it when you get all stewed up about somebody i won't go back there anymore wait till i give them a piece of my mind he said remember you're the one that's going to pay for it you're the one that's going to pay for it but the person that's bitter doesn't think that right they think it's it's the other person but you know i read one time bitterness is like drinking poison and then waiting for the other person to die that's what it's like they don't they don't many times they don't even know i've heard people that have a critical attitude about somebody they just have they feel that they've this person's done stuff to them and i said well why don't you go and straighten it once you go talk to them oh no i can't do that meanwhile they harbor this resentment they harbor this bitterness against them and that person doesn't even know doesn't even know they have it they're not bothered by it but this person's frustrated there's a there's a doctor a medical doctor he's a christian man he wrote a book back in the 60s i actually haven't his name is dr essai macmillan he he wrote a book called none of these diseases and and and part of this he has a chapter in there called the high cost of getting even and and he talked about how that uh physical maladies like ulcers and high blood pressure kind of like what brother brown said in strokes are often connected to harboring resentment and hatred toward he others a link like that and he said it might well be written on thousands of death certificates that the victim died of grudgitis that's what he said and he made this statement i thought was really quite interesting he said that the moment speaking about this resentment and hatred to others he said the moment that i start hating a man i become his slave i become a slave he said i can't enjoy my work anymore because he even controls my thoughts my resentments produce too many stress hormones in my body i become fatigued after just a few hours of work the man i hate may be miles from my bedroom but more cruel than any slave driver he whips my thoughts into such a frenzy that my inner spring mattress becomes a rack of torture he said i really must acknowledge that i am a slave to every man and who might pour out my wrath but we don't think of that we think the other person but you know they never they never many of them never know that you have this resentment you don't deal with it right you're the one that suffers it troubles you it affects you but it doesn't just affect you if you don't deal with it you don't fix it if you go on in hebrews 12 and 15 and read the next part hebrews 12 and 15 lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled we talk about covet being infectious and up home we have this norovirus that's really bad as well extremely infectious well bitterness is one of those infectious diseases spiritually infectious diseases and just as you you know need to get inoculated and vaccinated for to not catch certain things well you've got to be really careful when you're dealing with a better person because those spirits i've dealt with bitter people and and i've set one time with a man he he had things against the church and the pastor and things and i talked to him for for hours and i didn't have the issues he had but after spending those hours working with him and listening to might come out of there and it was i i had to do everything not to take on a little bit of that there's a there's an infectious nature with these spirits and so that's why the bible says if someone's in trouble you know you that are the weak person is not the one that should be helping the person in trouble you need to be strong the bible speaks about that need to help those that are weak because there's a there's an infectious nature to these things and that bitterness is on that person if you don't if you're not careful it can jump on you criticizing the pastor next time thing you know you're criticizing the pastor brother mentions this in christ the mystery of god revealed 1963's he said love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say he said you're all he was preaching you're all one big group now sweet group but remember my warning satan won't let us stay that way and again i come here i don't know any situations here you're all one sweet that's how i see it that's how i always want to approach it but the devil doesn't want it to be that way he said he'll shoot everything if if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic in he said unbeliever and set him down cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things so they get in you get used to them all there's a good brother good sister and then he said he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and then he said he'll start through the church with it now if you aren't careful it's going to be a problem but brother branham said don't take sides with it don't have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for the man that he'll be saved to or the woman whoever who it is pray for them and stick with one another and he said stay with your pastor because he's a shepherd you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of god to do so so we always have to be watching for the enemy to be trying to slip in another message enticing spirits 1955. amongst a lot of people he said we find where emotions and so forth there becomes tattlings and backbitings and all kinds of ungodly things brother brown said brother that's sulfuric acid in the church sulfuric acid in the church it's demon power spirit of men and women who get among one another try to push off and say this one's not right that one's not right and he said you chase it down nine times out of ten it's the person making the stir that's not right god hates discord among the brethren we have enough trouble with the devil at us we don't need to be at each other we need one another and it's like i said about brother rankin's daughter you know if i have a need i want everyone to pray i don't think well that person i don't like that person i don't want them to pray for me i want everybody to pray we shouldn't we shouldn't be looking for enemies we have enough of them out there now the way that this kind of root develops and comes to the place of springing forth i want to i want to jump over to a scripture in ephesians chapter four because there's a progression i said to you that it can sometimes go for a long time but there's a progression to it in ephesians 4 we're going to read verses begin at verse 26 and we're going to skip a couple and read verse 26 ephesians 4 26 be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath really good advice the enemy comes in tries to hurt and cause should be don't let the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so that's something kind of good advice to try to even stop that seed from being able to germinate but for those that it has let us look at let us look first at verse 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption it's interesting that the scripture that follows this one that we quote so often grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed well if it's saying grieve not that means it's possible to do it without you know going into any detail but let's look at verse 31 i'm going to read it through and then we're going to break it down let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender harder forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you i won't dwell a lot on it but if you look at this you'll see a progression so the bitterness it starts off let all bitterness bitterness is that harboring of the hurt that you got and you're holding it there that bitterness but it doesn't stop like that you're harboring it there and then it begins to come to the next point which is wrath and that word is derived from a word that refers to to heat it's like an internal heat like a like a smoldering like a slow burn take oily rags and and light them and then stick them in a confined space like a closet where there's not much oxygen and they will smolder and they will smolder there for a long time and then when you open the door of course it burst forth so this raft this internal heat the smoldering goes on so sometimes it can be there and they just people are just smoldering inside over things and they just hold that there and then as it begins to manifest it turns to anger and angers that outward expression of what's going on inside that bitterness that's there that smoldering it begins to express itself through this anger and then clamor which is uncontrolled and loud speech most people when this bitter roots brings forth they're not quiet they're very loud they're very angry and they express it in very strong terms and then it turns into evil speaking where people say things that if they were stopping and thinking about it even after it's all settled they would regret it saying very very bad things parents sometimes do it to their children sometimes husbands and wives do it i wish i never married you or telling kids that they're stupid or you know that's bad stuff evil speaking be put away from you and then it says with all malice malice is the desire to hurt or to injure someone and people that are bitter when they lash out that is their purpose they want to hurt wherever they're directing it they want to cause some injury like a man hitting his wife or child you know a disgruntled employee you you know of those things but it can be raped down into our ranks too where we we're saying things evil things with the intent of hurting that's what it's for it's not for you're not trying to help them it's not constructive criticism you're trying to hurt that's what this does that's what it does the bible says you need to put it away from you but that's not always an easy thing to do we'll talk about that but before i do that i want to i want to talk about a character in the bible by the name of a hitherfield i want to talk about the bitterness of a hitherfield now you probably know about him he's he was david's counselor an absolute counselor as well and if you go to ii samuel as we try to put this together ii samuel 16 and verse 23 he wasn't just like any counselor he was a counselor that had such wisdom and such respect the people there's a scripture that really highlights the the the value that was placed upon his council in second samuel 16 and 23 it says in the council of a hitherfield which he counseled in those days was as as if a man had inquired at the oracle of god now that's that's pretty powerful so that tells me if i'm trying to understand a hitherfield because i want to understand his bitterness i need to understand something about him this is a man that's not uh shallow i mean people come to him for council the king come to him for counsel and it says it's as if a man inquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of a hitherfield both with david and it wasn't just with david notice and with absalom he didn't lose his gift when he turned on david he didn't lose his gift he still had that but why did he turn on david is what we want to dig into what caused a hitherfield to turn on david in the book of psalms you can read where david talks about it's in psalms 41 and 9. david talks about mine own familiar friend he wasn't just a counselor to david scholars will tell you that psalms 41 and 9 is referring to a hypothetic that he was not just a counselor he was david's friend he said my own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me well what caused that what caused david's friend and a counselor of such wisdom and such respect to turn away from david and conspire with absalom we know there's people that are shallow and that will go wherever politically makes sense you might say well absalom was in charge so it made sense for him to do that but a hitherfield you know from the scriptures would suggest that he was a much deeper thinker than that he wouldn't have just ran away because you know my opportunity for for growth is better with absalom but he definitely we know that he conspired with absalom against david and we know that the lord dealt with david and and encountered that uh council of a hitherfield but what i want you to and and when his counsel just for time's sake i won't go through that but when his counsel was defeated we know that that he was so discouraged he went out and hung himself but i want to i want us to try to understand what happened to hitherfield and what caused him to change the name of his fell means brother of folly or brother of ruin and such was his life even though he had all this wisdom in this great council to understand what happened to a hitherfield we need to go back nine years nine years from when this happened back to the time when that seed was first planted and the root began to form and you can read this in second samuel 11-1 uh well ii samuel 11 we will we will just i'm just going to draw your attention to the third verse but this is the time when david saw bathsheba on the roof and he took her and you know the whole story how that through deceit and and he had her husband killed all these things that he did terrible things and but i want you to notice verse three so you can draw see where we're coming from with this in verse three davidson inquired after the woman and one said is this not bashiba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite so eliam was uh bashiba's father and in second samuel 23 and 34 i'm just drawing this together you'll read that eliam was the son of a hitherfield the gillian which would make a hitherfell her grandfather now i'm a grandfather and if i think about that i think about david who had all his wives if i imagine king coming and taking my granddaughter or my daughter and doing what he did and causing her husband to be killed and my human self i wouldn't be very happy about that and he was he was he there was some depth to this man and so he looked at that and thinking how could david do that with all that he had how could he how could he do this and it would have seemed like david got off with it yes the child you know the lord took the child's life that was conceived and all that but i'm sure hithaphel was looking at that thinking that doesn't seem like much you know with all that he's got he got off pretty easy and you might say i don't know if i believe that and some scholars might say well that might not have been the same hithaphel but there's got to be a reason why and and to show the vengefulness of it we'll go to a scripture in a few moments but the point of all of this is when you're looking at your circumstance and the trials that you face in the things and the injustices that might have been done to you it's the same thing the bible tells us that that we should not avenge ourselves sure david did wrong and he paid for it he may not have paid for it the way his phil thought he should or even his father the bible doesn't speak about what his father thought but but but he did pay for it and it and it's not up to us to exact vengeance upon those who might hurt us it's not our job the bible says vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord that's not our it's not our job now but just to just to kind of to make this point in second samuel 17 when he's he's conspiring with absalom second samuel 17 1-2 this is the scripture that i think kind of helps help me when i looked at it to reinforce the sinking because if isabelle was just conspiring with with absalom and he had no real vested interest in it he was just there doing his job when you look at the scripture it kind of doesn't go along with that so when it says in in second samuel 17 1 and 2 moreover hitherville said to absolutely let me choose 12 000 men i will arise and pursue after david this night imagine the counselor going out to pursue after david why did he want to pursue after david why did he do that and notice the second verse and he said and i and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed and will make him afraid because isn't that what bitterness you want to do you want to make them afraid you want to hurt them but watch what he says and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only i will smite the king only why would it why would he do that if it was not there was some really serious bitterness going on in his heart that's how powerful that bitterness can be that's how powerful it was for a hisophile i want to talk about corey can boom for a moment well no before we do that we'll start to address the solution to this problem a little bit a root bitter root how do we get rid of it well the types and shadows are good a root you really have to get rid of the root so i've had you know in my home there and planted grass you get these weeds that come in and sometimes you go to pull them up and you just snap the top off and you think oh it's gone no it's not gone the root's still there come back a little while later and it's right back where it was to get rid of the root you've got to get rid of the root you just can't get rid of the fruit of it there's the root and the fruit you can't just get rid of the symptoms you can't deal just treat the symptoms you have to get rid of the root itself it must be uprooted and it takes the grace of god to uproot it that's why the bible said when it talks in the hebrews there it said let us not fail of the grace of god you can't get rid of it on your own it's the grace of god but god is able to take out the root now let me i want to talk to you about corey ten boom you're familiar with her she's the one who wrote the book the hiding place but she's the dutch watchmaker uh that their her and her family they they were hiding the jews uh in wartime and got caught got caught actually by a german soldier who impersonated you know as if he was someone who needed help and they they caught them and then they put them into prison and corey and her and her sister betsy was put in a woman's concentration camp in ravensbruck and they you know they held little worship services together she managed to sneak in a bible one of the testimonies amazing uh what the lord can do they searched them when they brought them in and they weren't allowed to have bibles or anything but she had a bible i think pinned to her back or something and she said when she come up to the line and they were looking at people one at a time she said when they come to her the guard didn't see her he said he literally didn't see her and she just walked by so that's how she got the bible in and so they met together and so on well her sister died there she was weak and uh frail and over a period of time she just got sicker and finally she died and then 15 days later she was released but her sister was one that really exemplified even more than corey ten boom did maybe for a while she was the positive one among them and a great inspiration to her and you know she told corey before she she died that she said there is no pit so deep that god is not deep or still and so after her her sister died corey was released about 15 days later and then a week after that all the women of her age were sent to the gas chambers if you're probably familiar with that this story that i hadn't read before was that she after the war time she used to go around and speak to some of the survivors and she actually had a home for survivors of the holocaust she went to germany went to munich one time and she was speaking there uh talking about the love of god and how they needed to you know be able to move on and forgive and so on and she was actually in germany giving this talk and at the end of it there was a and i'm going to read her account of it the best i can i always i always find this very moving because putting myself and what she would have gone through and what she had to be facing with here and it relates to our thought with bitterness i think how powerful the love of god is she said i i was a church in munich that i saw him a balding heavyset man in a gray overcoat and a brown felt hat clutched between his hands and the people were filing out she had finished speaking talking to them and they were filing out but he was coming towards her and it was in 1947 and she was had come speaking about the forgiveness of god and she said it was a truth they needed to hear she was talking she said she had this mental picture in her mind that was her favorite mental picture talking about the sea and how she said the sea is never far from a hollander's mind and she liked to think in her mind about how our sins were cast into this sea when we confess our sins god cast them into the deepest ocean they're gone forever and so as they left this this man begins to walk up and she said at one moment i saw the brown overcoat in the brow or the overcoat and the brown hat and then the next moment i saw a blue uniform and a visor cap with its skull and crossbones because this man was one of the guards at the concentration camp where she was so then all of that experience come back in a rush the huge room she said with his harsh overhead lights pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center the shame of walking naked past this man he said i could see my sister's frail form all of those images were there in her mind and so he comes up to her and he put his hand out said you know how he was appreciating what she said he said it's how good it is to know uh as you say that our sins are at the bottom of the sea well she's now confronting her own she didn't think she know she's trolling people how they had to now she was being confronted never really realized there was an issue there you put a sand out she said now she said an eye who had spoken so glibly of forgiveness fumbled in my pocketbook rather than take the hand she said he wouldn't remember me of course how could he remember one prisoner and he didn't remember but she said i remembered him and the leather crop swinging from his belt was the first time since my release i had been face to face with one of my captors and she said my blood seemed to freeze not hard to understand and so he said you mentioned ravensbruck in your talk he said i was a guard there and you know but he said since that time i become a christian i know that god has forgiven me for the cruel things i did there but i would like to hear it from your lips as well and he put his hand out again the second time will you forgive me what would you do what would i would i have done it seems too simple it shouldn't be that easy she said this is what she went through i want to read in her words she said i stood there i who sins every day had to be forgiven and could not betsy had died in that place could he erase her slow terrible death simply for the asking that's what she was dealing with she said it couldn't have been many seconds he stood there but it seemed like hours as i wrestled with the most difficult thing i ever had to do for i had to do it i knew that the message that god forgives has a prior condition that we forgive those who have injured us if you do not forgive men their trespasses jesus says neither will your father in heaven forgive your trespasses she said i knew it not only as a commandment of god but as a daily experience since the end of the war she said i had a home in holland for victims of nazi brutality and here's her own statement as she's reflecting she said those were able to forgive their former enemies were able also to return to the outside world and rebuild their lives no matter what the physical scars those who nursed their bitterness remained invalids it was as simple and as horrible as that that was what she witnessed but you know we're called upon to do the same thing brother branham says before i go on with this i want to read a quote in the 10 virgins and 144 000. brother brown said if you have the holy spirit you're part of god because you're his he sealed you and he's in you working in you the signs that he does you do also we think about signs i want you to see what he says now does everybody understand that it takes the holy spirit to be gods holy spirit if you are of the holy spirit you do the works that jesus did and then what does he say he said when they spit in your face and beat you around like that he said there was no root of bitterness when they spit in your face and beat you around he said there was no root of bitterness that's the real test you know i speak a thought on about trial of your faith brother branham said anyone can have faith when the mountains are moving but when it turns backwards he said that shows if you have real faith or not oh he said no root of bitterness he looked down at them and said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and jesus counsels us in the in the scriptures that when we stand to pray when you stand praying he said forgive and if you have ought against any and you're i understand you're gonna have communion later it's always important we always do this i'm sure he does our brother does too but if you've got you're gonna take communion you need to do a little searching is there anything there and of course you should do that every day anyways you know it shouldn't be something you have to wait to communion but but if you do if you got something there if you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any your father which is in heaven may forgive your trespasses but if you do not forgive and it's as simple as this in the scripture if you do not this is mark 11 if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses if you can't forgive one another you're not going to get forgiveness it's as simple as that and she knew all of these things so she says she stood she said i stood there with the coldness clutching my heart but she said forgiveness is not an act of an emotion i knew that too forgiveness is an act of the will and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart so as she's getting ready to respond she silently prays she said jesus help me i can lift my hand i can do that much but you supply the feeling she didn't have the feeling she had a coldness and bitterness in her heart but she said i can lift my hand you supply so she said woodenly mechanically i thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me and as i did she said an incredible thing took place this is her words she said the current started in my shoulder and raced down to my arm and sprang into our joined hands and this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being bringing tears to my eyes and then she said i forgive you brother with all my heart and she makes a statement she said for a long moment we grasped each other's hands the former guard and the former prisoner and she said i had never known god's love so intensely as i did then that's that's the power of forgiveness i was in israel in 2018 and we went to a glass art museum just as a part of the many things we visited there and there was a lady there that was running it and touring around we come to this memorial of the holocaust and it was this sculpture was a really darkly lit room and kind of a face kind of faces there and blood it was just a really really dark image and she's speaking about it there and she said you know the reason we have this here is so that we will never forget and never forgive and i remember we're all standing there 24 of us ministers and their wives and the different ones and there's like literally an audible gasp in the room because that's not the way a christian is but what if you what if you were in their shoes i just read an incident in ukraine of a lady who's in a car and there was a strike close by and the car got damaged and they were trying to get out there was a fire and she had a young child and a daughter maybe around 12 and her daughter got injured from some shrapnel she was trying to help her and then all of a sudden the shell struck close by and literally blew her daughter's head off and she made a statement she said if i had the opportunity to shoot putin she said i would do it right now and wouldn't hesitate but you know what that's not that's not what a christian would do there's that human side of us that gets very angry when we hear about these kind of injustices done but it's not the right response for us it's still god's job to do that if we were in the middle of holocaust and all these things and we were in ukraine right now dealing with some of the stuff they're dealing with there would be those that human side that would be incredibly hard not to gravitate to not to hate not to get bitter and a lot of them are going to have that struggle when this is over but they're only going to hurt themselves in the end we must forgive we have to forgive here's what brother branham said about the root and getting rid of the root hebrews chapter 2 and 1957 brother branham said after all it is the experience of passing from death to life when the old things die and all things become new christ becomes real old things drop away old roots of carnality you know how to dig a root out brother brown said he said we used to take the grubbing hole and get down at it and dig it until there wasn't a speck left and that's what has to be done with the root of bitterness until there's not a speck left and they said if there be any root of bitterness spring up into you grub her out he said that's right that's what the holy spirit does root out all the roots dig them out pile them up and burn them get rid of them then he said you'll get a good crop then you get a good crop then cory ten boom said forgiveness is the key that unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of hatred it is a power that breaks the chains of bitterness in the shackles of self selfishness am i okay for time i want to talk about naomi in her bitterness let's go to ruth chapter one ruth chapter one beginning at verse 1. now this story starts off you know what not on a very a good note the bible says here in ruth one and one it comes to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons the name of that man was elimelech the name of his wife naomi which means my delight the name of his two sons maelon chilean ephrathites of bethlehem judah came to the country moab continued there well it goes on to say like naomi's husband died she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the one of the name was orphan one was ruth and they were there for about ten years and then the two sons died in verse five and the woman was left over two sons and her husband well i don't think that was the plan she had when they went there i expect they plan to go there for a little while and come back she loses her husband loses her children your children are supposed to die before you do you know that's the way we feel and we think about it it's very hard to lose a child i haven't experienced it but i know many have lost children sometimes tragically and it's very difficult to move on from it and so she's feeling this emptiness she's there with her daughters in law they're not you know they're not israelites or jews any you know so she just she's discouraged all of these experiences that happened to her not part of the plan and a lot of things happen in our lives i can tell you a lot of things i've experienced over the years i wish i didn't experience doesn't have any control over there's a lot of things happening in our lives we don't have control over but we do have control over how we respond to those things it's up to you whether those things are going to destroy you or you're going to be made better by them somehow i have to believe that everything that happens good or bad is god has some good purpose for it so israel you know the reason they had the famine israel had fallen into idolatry might not have been her problem but that was israel and so israel dealt with it has always been dealt with by god as a nation so they all suffered but they were still the people of god we know that and he leads he led them just as he leads us sometimes through the still water sometimes as it says in the psalms though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death you know i will feel no evil thou art with me god is with us whether we're on the mountains or whether we are in the valley eliminate made a choice though he didn't have to make that choice he went to moab maybe he was a bad choice we make bad choices too sometimes doesn't mean god rejects us we may suffer a little bit more for it when we make those wrong choices but doesn't mean god's you know writing us off there's been many men and women in the bible made bad choices and god still stuck with them think of jonah running away from god different ones god could have just said jonah you didn't even start it's one thing if you start and you need some help to finish jono didn't even want to start you know if it was you or i we just say well forget him let's get somebody else that's actually willing to do it but you know we serve a god of second chances and third chances and four chances in fact he gives us probably more chances than we ever deserve but that's the kind of god we serve and so they go and they take moabite wives and all of that now i'm sure that's not what naomi wanted but it happened they take these mob wives all of this experience so at the end of these 10 years you know she's she feels empty and naomi begins to develop a bitter root grief you know doesn't have to become bitterness but it did for naomi because of her response to it the way she responded to it and so she makes a decision to go back and so we're still in the book of ruth we'll just pick another verse there in the book of ruth and the daughters say well you know we want to we want to go back with you we'll go back with you and notice that her response is a reflection of what's going on inside in ruth 1 and 13. when they say you know we'll come with you she said would you tarry for them you know speaking of if if they had you know other children would you wait until they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me that word grieveth comes directly from the word morar which means to be bitter i'm bitter i'm basically bitter it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against them so she feels they got a raw deal too you know when she's feeling bad for them she's feeling bad for her she's bitter and you know job the great man joe perfect the one that god allowed to go through such a deep trial he he went through some of that too he says in one place why why is light given to him that's in misery and life to the bitter and soul you know he he he went through those load times we go through those low times but that's god didn't want job to stay that way he had no intention for job to stay in that neither did he want naomi to stay in that condition well we know that ruth stays with naomi and they travel back so now if we jump down to the 19th verse of chapter one they return to bethlehem it says the two of them went until they come to bethlehem to come to pass when they were come it says all the city was moved because that family was well known and in the city and and they were all stirred and they said is this naomi remember we said it meant my delight that name and she was so bitter in her soul that she says don't don't call me naomi call me mara which means bitter i don't even why because the meaning didn't reflect the way she felt she said now god didn't call her that but she called herself that it was it was her call me mara bitterness for the almighty had dealt very bitterly with me watch what it was verse 21 i went out full and the lord has brought me again empty i wonder how many has had that even in your lives and my how many of us have started out i know when i started out with children and family you know you look for certain things to happen then all of a sudden here we are fast forward 30 years later and there's some empty spots there things that you didn't plan on i've had things that i didn't plan on happen and so you feel that way but it doesn't have to take you down into this pit of despair like it was for naomi she said i went out full and the lord had brought me home again empty why would you call me naomi seem the lord had testified against me and the almighty has afflicted me it's easy it's easy to allow yourself to go down that road and feel like you know this i guess it's my lot i'm not just going to always be this way and then just be bitter in spirit and just kind of try to survive well that's not the way god wants us to live she lost a lot and that was 10 years she lost her husband her children she lost her security in the bible days they relied on the men for support for financial not like today where everybody's working you know the husband wife and the kids and the dog are all out working to make things to make ends meet back in those days you didn't have a man someone to support you it was very difficult she lost her security her possession she lost her status she lost her reputation more importantly most importantly she lost her close relationship she would have had with god so she was in a very low place but you know it doesn't matter as i said before where the hurt comes from whether it's real or imagined whether it's from an enemy or a friend or in this case god it's all about your response god did not plant the bitter root in her she allowed it to be planted the enemy sowed the seed and she allowed it to take root she allowed it to germinate in that heart and nourished it and fed on it by dwelling every time i heard come it was just that's just a little bit more just kept feeding it and she developed this bitter root because she couldn't let go of the burden in her case it was she needed to let go of that bird and not carry it i read a story one time about two monks that were walking and they come to this uh river and they saw a woman that wanted to cross this river but there was no bridge and one of the monks she'd always wanted to help and said well we'll we'll help you across and so he they join their hands the two monks and they carry this woman across the other side and and she goes on her way and thanks them and then they get going and walking down the road that these two fellas and the the second monk the one who didn't volunteer said you know i'm i'm uh my back is bothering me and i'm just i'm having so much pain and all of that and i can't go on a diet and he returned to the first guy and said well aren't you aren't you uh aren't your back while they knew he was near backward and he said no he said the problem with you is you're still carrying the woman but i set her down a long time ago sometimes we bear the weight of these losses and these troubles you don't need to carry those things you don't need to carry them god has his own timetable as far as fixing things up and he did come around for naomi as well and she she got some of that joy back but god has his own way in his own time whether it be for a loved one that's gone out to the world and it's just sometimes like almost destroys i've seen it i was in costa rica and a man his daughter kind of didn't want to serve the lord and went out and he was he was about ready to give up serving the lord because his daughter wouldn't serve the lord and i said that's that's not the right response how do you ever expect to get her back if you're going to go out and join her this is the time you need to stand strong as you know when the rains break is when you need to hold on to the lord not just give up but sometimes we carry those things but god has a time you know he always had a time with israel and you know until that time arrives we don't know what it is for us and our own personal lives until it arrives and nothing else is going to happen too much israel one time you know was told that they were going to go down into babylon because of their sins again for 70 years and you know what nothing was going to happen until that 70 years went by they could have prayed they could have did whatever they wanted they had a lot of time now they knew what it was we just don't know in our case god still hasn't allotted time for you to go through whatever it is and for there to be something come out of that he knows when it is but when he told them about that you know he told them that that i will perform you know after the 70 years he said i will perform my good word to you i believe that he has a good word for us too that he has plans for us you know there's a scripture i think has been quoted a lot by ministers i know the thoughts that i have towards you say the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end i believe god has those thoughts for every one of us if you're a child of god that he has he wants you to succeed he doesn't want you to fail he's not allowing these trials to come to destroy you but to build you up to strengthen you as i said to make you better not to make you bitter and so god had plans for naomi too well it's kind of odd the way it goes sometimes we god answers and does things in a way that we don't expect or anticipate in ruth chapter four we all know the story of ruth and boaz and all of that will finally ruth and boys get together and she conceives and bear a son but what's really interesting is how the bible talks about that ruth 4 and verse 14 because naomi felt she was empty watch this and the woman said to naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee naomi this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel verse 15 and he shall be a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age she was old by this time but god still come back around and answered her for thy daughter-in-law which loveth he is better to thee than seven sons is hath born him and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became a nurse unto it watch verse 17 and the woman her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi she couldn't even have a son but that's the way they looked at it there was a son born to naomi they called his name but he is the father of jesse the father david amazing how god come around and restored some of that loss that she had what about us what about you has anyone here allowed such a root bitterness to form from loss or from anything else god is able to free and i want to close with one more story i guess you would call it maybe the instrument players could come as i relate the story and play the song just as i am without one plea and i want to relate this story about a woman by the name of charlotte elliot she was born in 1789 in england she was an embittered woman daughter of christian parents raised to serve the lord but she had a disability that caused her weakness and pain and like anyone with an infirmity you desire if you're a christian you're praying you're asking god to heal to deliver but it caused her to become bitter because god didn't seem to want to heal her at least in her mind she said if god loved me he would not have treated me this way so she became very bitter and her parents brought a minister in may of 1822 she would have been 33 years old at the time he brought a minister to have lunch with him hoping maybe he might might be able to say some words or do something and so they're sitting at the table having supper and she loses her temper and begins to rail against god and against her family and a real violent outburst her parents were so embarrassed they they got up and left the room leaving her there with the minister he just looked at her across the table and began to talk to her and he said you know you must be tired of yourself aren't you you're holding on to this hate and anger because you have nothing else in the world to hold on to so you have become sour you become bitter and resentful and he began to speak to her and she began to respond a little bit she said well what is your cure and he said the very faith that you're trying to despise he just kept talking to her and finally her heart softened a little bit and she said well if i wanted to become a christian and share the peace and joy that you possess what would i do he said you would give yourself to god just as you are now with your fightings and your fears and your hates in your life you might be here today with struggling with something you think well i'm not in you know sometimes people come to church and have a bad attitude you think well god can't do nothing let me tell you god's not afraid of your bad attitude if you want if you have an inkling of of wanting to get help from god it doesn't matter what your attitude is he's not afraid of it he'll help you and so he said come just as you are and so she said i would come to god just as i am is that right and so she did she come to god just as she was and her heart was changed that day and you know sometimes we think and we know the prophet said this too that sometimes the reason we can't get healing is because of unconfessed sin and different things like that but in charlotte's case god did not heal her she had the infirmity her entire life she dealt with it her entire life but he healed her in a more important way he could have healed her body but she had this bitterness the bitterness was the real problem he healed her bitterness but you know even people with infirmities are or various things you know we all have a purpose we all have something that god wants us to do every one of you in this building have a purpose to serve it might not be what somebody else is sometimes you're like well i can't preach i can't do this no you still have a purpose you have a purpose and you need to find it it's important to find your purpose and so she couldn't do a lot physically but she had a gift of being able to write poetry and her brother who was a minister by the name of henry elliot he was raising funds for a school for children of poor clergymen and so she wrote a poem and they sold it printed it and they sold it across england to raise money for this uh school and that poem since has become the most famous invitational hymn ever written it's one billy graham would use a lot it's the one they're playing right now just as i am it was this woman that wrote that because she experienced it she came to god in the middle of her bitterness and was delivered completely from it not getting her healing but delivered from the most important thing that was hindering her walk with god do i want us to sing it today and i don't know if there's anyone here dealing with with any of this if it's resonated with anyone but if you're here with any kind of bitterness in your heart any kind of root like that you do not have to leave here the way you come you might be angry right now you might be upset right now it doesn't matter god is here to root that out if you want it rooted out but you have to be willing to admit it's there and let god do it but he can he can deliver let's sing this song together just as i am just as i am without one please but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou peace [Applause] of god i come i come let us stand oh just as i am and [Music] my soul of one dark lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] of god i come i come he's here today oh just [Music] oh [Music] i come [Music] i am [Music] is there another one that wants to come for prayer this morning he's here [Music] in the [Music] final lamb of god [Music] and cleanse relief of god [Music] i am [Music] come to [Music] of god [Music] claim the blood jesus shed [Music] those precious blood stains were made there just for me [Applause] for all my sins my sickness [Music] i just claim those precious [Music] those precious blood stains were made there just for me [Music] for all my sins my sickness [Music] those precious [Music] before even time began my life was in his head [Music] he sees each tear that falls and he hears i have a farm he calls me his own he'll never leave no matter where i go he knows my name [Music] he sees [Music] i [Music] he bore all my sins [Music] he came to set me free [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knows [Music] and he hears me oh he knows my name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and he hears through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus [Music] through trust all [Music] through it all [Music] i've learned to depend upon his words through it all through it all [Music] i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned trust in god [Music] i've learned to depend upon this world i've had many tears and sorrows i've had questions for tomorrow heaven times but in every situation god gave blessed consolation then my trials only make me [Applause] [Music] strong through it all [Music] i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust through it all [Music] and i've seen so many faces but there have been times but in that lonely hour in that precious lonely hour jesus let me know i was his own through it [Music] it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust [Music] upon his word [Music] so i thank god for the mountains and i'll thank him for the valleys i thank him for the storms cause if i never had a problem i would know that he could solve them i wouldn't know what faith in his work [Music] [Applause] through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust [Music] oh [Music] i can just make another statement i don't i'm sorry i kept you so long but a lot of times the things that causes bitterness and just from the folks that are up here is the things that we sometimes we deal with in in our families in our lives things that we we can't fix and and our brother might remember when we spoke about worry at the youth camp i told him i said there's two things you should never worry about and that is things that you can change things that you can't change which is basically everything and so those things that you're dealing with some of these with families that are just not doing what they're supposed to do you've got to cast that burden upon the lord he said cast your burdens on and he he'll carry them you can't carry those you can't take those you can't fix those things but but the bible says the heart of the king is in the hand of the lord and he can turn it however he wants to and so if it's something you have control of sometimes there's things we do need to do we got to go here we got to talk to this one but then there's sometimes it's out of your hands all together and when it is you need to get your hands off it because you just cause more trouble for them and for you so if i can encourage you to try it's hard i deal with the same thing sometimes you you want to fix it especially as brothers we're fixers you know we got a problem we got to fix it sometimes there's problems we can't fix but we serve a god who can fix them and we can't be worrying about them we can't be bitter about them it's hard you see people doing things you think you shake their head why are they doing that but you can only do your part you can sow some seeds and a word here and a word there but then after you've done your part let god do his part amen god bless you i really appreciate it being here amen i'll pray for her sister [Music] when i look into your home [Music] shadows shadows when i found the joy of reaching your heart [Music] when all things that surround become shadows of you i worship you [Music] the reason i live is to worship you [Music] you [Music] is [Music] for the reason i live is to worship you [Applause] [Music] i worship oh yes lord jesus i worship you [Music] for the reason [Music] [Music] save me and i will be saved [Music] heal me oh lord [Music] and i will be here [Music] for you are the one i praise [Music] oh me oh lord and i will be save me and i will be saved heal me o lord and i will be here for you are the one i praise [Music] oh you are the one i praise [Music] can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] what can make me hold against nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] and oh precious years is the flow that makes me whine as snowy [Music] that i know nothing [Music] this this i see nothing but the blood of jesus for for my part in this oh nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] and oh my sing it from the experience of your heart oh precious is

but the blood of jesus and all my praises for this i bring nothing but the blood of trees [Music] is the flow that makes me white as snow [Music] i know [Music] [Music] but then jesus came and he listened to me and glory to god oh he set me free [Music] he broke the box a prison for me i'm glory bound by jesus oh glory to god he set me free and now i am climbing higher each day the darkness of night has drifted away my feet are planted on higher ground and glory oh he set me free [Music] foreign [Music] now this right here this is part of the practice goodbye to sin goodbye [Music] do what we do god does what he does goodbye we said before adios not dwelling with you no longer not going to entertain you not going to fellowship with you not i'm not talking about another brother or sister i'm talking about bitterness goodbye can we sing this now with a real testimony goodbye amen oh goodbye daily i'm working and i'm praying to add glory to god [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] my jesus received oh glory to god he set me free oh yes i'm glory bound by jesus [Music] we're here to baptize sister judith her brothers they come to this church but they're a lot of times they're not here because they have to work and they're going to school the sister judith been coming here on and off for about a year yes but if you get a chance read her and get to know her she's she's gone through quite a bit and here about two weeks ago or a week three weeks ago when brother sammy was uh away she asked me about baptism because she's been baptized before as a child your father is a minister right so i told her i said well that's up to you you don't have to get baptized again but if you feel that you want to just let brother sam you know so she let she let us know here recently that she wanted to get baptized again so that's a good sign she's been through a lot and the lord i believe she knows it too that the lord brought her here so we just always keep her in prayer for him that the lord just continue to bless her and be with her so brother carla's gonna have a word of prayer and we're gonna baptize the lord jesus christ let's pray heavenly father as we come before the father this afternoon father we're just so thankful father that our brother from canada was able to come our way on the lord god we thank you very much for it father lord god right now father we're ready to take our sister and baptize your father in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of our sin father we ask you to bless her and be with her and her family father lord god and lord when she comes up father may you meet her father in the name of jesus christ we come before the lord jesus christ to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins [Applause] you set me free yes he set me free oh keep me broke the bonds a prison for me i'm glory bound by jesus to god he set me free he set me free yes he said for he broke the bonds of prison for me i'm glory bound by jesus to see glory to god he set me free hallelujah how many can say amen to that amen i tell you well there's a lot you could be sad i think i have i don't know how many pages of notes that are there you know no matter how many times i've even had situations where people had logged onto the internet here from services years ago and would write me different ones and some of the things that i dealt with in family services they would write and you sometimes we look at the needs and we all have needs in our life and begin to think about these things because you know medical science some of the things that brother carmen was referring to medical science is finding out things but that god through his prophet there is a litany of quotes that i've read to you and this is from back in 16 17 years ago when i taught on some of those things in the beginning yet you know what it's always gotta it's always continual practice you know one of the first things they'll do to a cancer patient some of you remember this when we just took some services on forgiveness before they give that treatment to that cancer patient they first of all i know maybe some people have had it and they haven't experienced this but what they have found is that if that person has a grudge in their life at all it will do no good to take that medicine now this is what medical sciences found out now think of this the token the life of the word the prophet called it the medicine and that word is continually we want the word and we want the word to be effective in our life and the times where we're looking at it and it's not just bitterness but sometimes there's other things and this is why we need the word of god where it comes down where the rubber meets the road because god has ordained you and i just as much as this this this little clock up here that sometimes i overlook it's meant to tell time but you know what if there's something wrong with it if the battery's bad in it i don't care what it's intended to do if it doesn't have the battery or if there's something out of line in it it cannot do what it's intended to do and that's how it is with our lives we are ordained to be channels that god would come and fulfill his word through and to think to me this is how i look at it the love of god that god comes down not just in a service like this but in a service like this and then through services and then in our everyday life to come to that place because seeds are going to come they're going to come the bible says offenses will come [Music] and i always thought it was very good i heard you know i've used it but one of the first times i heard it put this way brother wayne used it in this sense out of spoke out of spiritual food and diseases brother braham says we need to be accumulating the faith the things that god is doing in this hour let it be accumulated in our life but i like how the contrast is too if we can accumulate faith in all the experiences what god's doing what he's revealing what he's doing in our life then it also shows there it can be an accumulation of hurts offenses that just get built up over time but i'm glad that we got a god who's not too big that he'll come down and say that's my daughter that's my son they were not ordained for that and i come to lusa i'm so glad about that it makes me so proud of my god how loving how kind that he is i've seen him change lives i know what it is for a soul for a life to be changed i've had that experience but how wonderful it is that after we've experienced that that he'll come to us when we don't deserve it and he'll let us know my son my daughter this is a hindrance let's deal with this i love that scripture in the song of solomon i'm going to let you go but i want you to notice what solomon would say take us the foxes not you us what i see the father doing that i do likewise the father worketh and i worketh hitherto take us the little foxes that destroy the vine i'm glad i'm glad that he is an ever-present god i'm glad that he's not ashamed to come down and take my hand i'm glad that he's ashamed to not and take our hands oh god don't ever let me be ashamed let me stand and say you're right lord let me stand and confess it and say that's true lord not just in a service but you realize how the word of god comes to us even in this hour that there are things that you and i can have responses to this has happened to me but then after i'm removed from it a little bit you might have your frustration and you get along with god and you begin to realize wait a minute your approach is wrong your attitude is wrong i'm talking about me now god begins to deal and you begin to realize wait a minute this is you this is me me trying to deal with it i'm glad he comes that way he said brother samuel what does that happen well sometimes i just have teary eyes and i keep things right there i can pull up in the truck or in the car and i can wipe my eyes and say god forgive me lord for getting in the way help me lord to get out of the way [Music] i'm so glad i'm so glad i'll tell you what a communion service communions later today but [Music] what a service because what we are coming here in a few hours to do this is really not communion communion is our daily walk with god brother branham tells us he said you can have communion with someone as long as there's no edge there between you you get that edge out of the way whatever it is then you can it's free i'm glad aren't you glad i'm glad just so many things i know god has spoke to our hearts this morning my cup is full but my cup is not just full my heart is healed my life is touched you see i don't just look at a service like this and say oh god my congregation oh god my congregation i want this word to search my life that's how i when i listen to the message of the hour i want it to search my life [Music] we want to reflect take it in it's been good to be here so thankful for our sister judith and the courage and the stand and the step that she's made like brother richard had mention you continue to as a body of believers we reach right out so i may be having shaken sister judah's hand well this would be a good day to do it good day to introduce yourself and to get acquainted because we're expecting to be in the same place amen thank god for his mercy it's a little bit after two right now i'm thinking that four o'clock is going to be too soon somebody said yeah real loud over here i can pick with my mother-in-law that's all right um i don't know 4 30 or 5. what do you think 435 five who said five can we get a over okay all right five we'll do that it'll give my wife time also to make the bread as well and but i want to say this brother carmen thank you thank you for yielding thank you brother [Applause] amen what the holy spirit has done today he picked up the jawbone the spoken word has went forth to discern and dismantle the philistines once again i say to god be the glory amen lord willing five o'clock we'll come back together father as we lord leave the presence of one another for a few moments lord we're gonna ask that you would just watch over each one bring us back together safely lord i pray for brother carmen god how we thank you lord lord i just knew that lord there was something god that you had in store
