amen we just let you have your seats here and I just want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus I want to just just to speak of a few things before I get into the message here this morning I want to say that it's just really really good to be able to be here and how God has allowed us to be able to make this possible and I just want to say it I wish I had the video to play here but a brother fellow pastor sent me this video this week and you can just imagine the things that that we receive during this time that the situations that we are presently in and maybe you've seen it somebody just put a mean to it and what it shows is over in some country there's a it's a little hill like this almost a little bit that a roadway has moved upon and it said this is pastoring during the pandemic it showed this guy with a big Greyhound bus driving on it and he had to turn it around and it was rockin on that and they had to get it turned around you knowing and I think not just for pastoring because a lot of times we're giving things then they want us to you know the little things here and there to try to do try to ensure a part but I think each and every one of us and there's certainly a lot of things that I say that we have are asked to do and a lot of things are very they're not comfortable for us and not what we are are used to or even maybe would like and but I want to say - there's a congregation I want to thank you for your cooperation throughout these unusual times because one thing that we the part that would be very easy for us and sometimes and I'm just gonna be very I'm not gonna preach on this but sometimes we can call ignoring things or pretending like it's not there sometimes we want to call that faith and that's not faith faith says you know what this is this is something as present that God will see me through that's faith think that just as brother Branham addressed it and how can overcome and these are statements within the message where brother Brown as a person says he said you might say I don't have cancer and he says no your doctor said you have cancer you have cancer but the years now where we balance it but remember the God in you is greater see we're not we're not ignoring we're not standing there like Joshua and Caleb saying you know Joshua and Caleb didn't say the 10 spies and say or you guys are faithless there ain't no Giants over there no no they said it's true there's giant but that's not the focus of our conversation we're not even gonna let that be the focus of our mind our focus is in God's promise a lot of things around us here in either way that could try to steal our focus and our emotions and our thoughts and a lot of things and things could try to pull us this way try to pull us this way this is why in this hour it is so necessary for spiritual discernment and I'm not gonna preach on that this morning but I just and I know every moment that I take up here to speak of these things somehow it gets counted against me I often Eve's brother Paul lefante and God bless your brother Josh and sister and Mariah I teased brother Paul because sometimes when we've ministered together of places and I maybe had the second service and someone lets me know say hey you only have about 45 minutes you know you can go as long as you want the 45 minutes of people be with you and this and that and I told him I said well listen I said if I was as gifted his brother Paul I said I could preach and then go write a song and finish the sermon and it don't get counted against me you know so I would just tease and you know brother Paul on that part of it but maybe God will let me sing my sermon today but there's there's just a few points that we I want to address and reaffirm some things one thing that I want to mention I want to say that I really just appreciate the way that the Deacons and the ushers this has been very unusual and uncomfortable for them but I want to say that I appreciate the ways that they've taken things and and I know sometimes that they might get a little flak but I want to understand right here they they're here to serve and to help us that's what they're here for and their extensions they take the direction and many times with the brothers one thing I just so appreciate a lot of times they're already on things and God has helped us just to work with just a like mindedness and they'll take things that that I've mentioned and they have to go through and try to you know apply them and try to remind us so just I want you to please during this time and and if anything at all during all of this don't stop free not that you have but let's pray because I tell you you you know I look at this and I I certainly I don't want to continue on in the ways that we've had to do things you know I'm having my feelings but I'm not gonna eject my feelings hi I just wanted I don't want to do and direct my feelings and my thoughts or my opinions and we all have I said we all have them and that's the truth I mean you know we I just don't want to do that I think that would be really counterintuitive it would not be productive for what we really need to be focused on when we come here when one thing we're focused on and that is we want to hear from God we want to serve the Lord who want to worship Him so I want to remember that reminds you of this here there's a couple things right now first of all on that social distancing I'm gonna look around right now and I don't see that it you know well I'm not gonna say that out there but I just want you to be mindful of this because the Deacons right now we have already had together a complete seating chart and I know sometimes a person I don't sit here I usually sit here and I said here and I but during this time this is where we all have to be flexible I'm sure you get hungry enough you go to a restaurant you don't care if they I don't want a four I don't want a four top there's five of us I don't want to set on the end my knees will bump into that talking for me but if you're hungry enough you eat it you sit down let your knees bump in you know but what I wanted to say is we want you to be very mindful as a congregation of the maintaining of that social distance because one thing that I don't want to happen here we've worked there's been a lot of hours that's went into this from the beginning to make this possible to come back together I want to say that there's been different ones that they've been exposed to this throughout the time different ones God is healed raised up from a different other ones that God is healed and others that when they've come in contact with it they right away I appreciate their responsibility even though they want to be in the house of God they said you know what I'm gonna self quarantine and I appreciate that because that's even for all even for all of us and I appreciate them doing that and you might say brother Samuel is that fear no that's just being sensible it's just being sensible and you know I want you to I want to ask you to monitor these things let's not get relaxed you know within it I want us to rest I want us to have we have faith but not to just get we don't want to be careless during this also you know right now the masks they're mandatory in the county where we're at if you go out to eat after after service here you'll have to wear one I guess in the place you go I don't know you know I don't understand all of that part how you eat with the mask on where you take it - I don't understand that so once again I'm not putting I just we know that that Matt the mask that's mandatory for our County right now and it's just a reminder these things are temporary here in County I was looking at this last on Thursday here we I got some text here right as a few hours before before service and I'm writing the train of thought on things and I didn't know what had happened where we had to mask and this coming in and that coming in and like I said once again I'm not here to try to reason things out and is this a right and is this a bit I I'm not let's let's put that outside to talk because I can stand here with that and in any in any side as well I just the part of it is is that within it I just we want to follow the best the best that we can and I understand some people with the masks you're not able to do it with that that's all explained in the guidelines that we sent out I also understand if you're sitting here you know it might come a time those things you know it just you you get sold I don't know how you described it you know it just you're walking around with them and I see the people in the store the employees in the store pulling them down and and everything else you know and I understand there's debates on all of that and I'm not I'm not here to talk about the debates on those things with the masks and believe me I've watched a lot of different things on that but I'm sure probably you have to and so the thing is is I asked what I would ask you is is that even in this right here don't let your spirit become vexed one way or the other let your spirit just say Lord I just my focus is I just want to stay open before you and that's the thing that we don't want we don't want to do so as I was saying temporary you know the here in county they were on it when the governor first announced it then they came off of it within just within the weeks time so all these things a lot of it is temporary I'm asking that when we come back in I didn't want to send an email out there already we've typed a lot of those things throughout the times and I'll just be honest and I would like to see some of you become more aware and reading your email if you don't have an email and it's not submitted to us get it to us because I realize sometimes people have come and I can tell you having read your email I can tell by the questions I get now that's your responsibility don't worry my belt is still on I'm not I'm not swinging but that's your responsibility to read your emails keep up with what's going on the other part so with the mast part of it I'm asking that we would comply with that during this time and just the whole part of it the only one who doesn't have to wear it is he who's officiating the service so maybe I won't let nobody else preach no but we we try to keep your breast that you stay if you stay aware of it and if it happens during you come in here and you're wearing the mask and it gets too much for you look I'm not gonna sit here and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna walk around and say put your mask on pick it up the Deacons aren't gonna do that either we're just not we're not doing that I appreciate I want to say and around all the brothers and sisters that's been here that I haven't if you've had a question I appreciate you go go to the Richard go to brother Gomez you know I appreciate it we haven't got the people are frantic and hysterical about things I really appreciate that being not in that manner that's that's very appreciate when not being that way the other thing is so with the social distancing part just try to make sure you're not right now so we had the Deacons and the ushers they could go back to seating people I really don't want to have we were we don't want to have to do that but if we have to do it we'll do it so you just try to make sure it's like for example if I knew you know like we're brother Joey I come in and I see where he's setting well I know not to sit right behind me I love you but I know not to sit right behind him I know not to sit right in front of him I know to space out a little bit so even we have to we'll have to do that as best we can if you find it difficult then asked one of the Deacons say can you help me during this time because there's already been I know there's one one particular assembly that I know of and they had to go back to streaming for a few weeks because of some things and it just had kind of broke out through the church and there was a number of it and they've been able to resume so we want to try to be precautious during this time the other part is after the service we want you to exit the building I was in here even on Thursday night and trying to I don't want to say shoe but trying to get people out of out of the building and that kids and and everything else when we dismissed I understand if you have to go to the restroom go to the restroom and then go on out to the parking lot the church library the office back there off limits if you during this time just go on out because let me tell you what happens and that includes let me just go and make the announcement for everybody with the songs and things like that with probably the practicing of the songs you may need to kind of have to rearrange that at a different time because a number of these sisters many times we're out there standing and fellowshipping you've got a whole group of individuals that they're going through and they're wiping down every single speck of this sanctuary they're doing it they've put together where you couldn't get wipes they went ahead and made the wipes with where you how you make your own they did all of that and they so they're in here wiping all that down I appreciate that and so we you know I've there's nothing wrong with that at all you know it's just like you know you appreciate it you trust the people to restaurants making your food that they wash their hands right you care about that so we we want to be mindful of that so I just just ask that you please bear with us during that brother Richard is there anything else that you feel I need to everything was good yeah yeah yeah yeah right and yeah not to be out there congregate near the protocol let me just say this to you this is probably something maybe a little bit of a coming for a long time if I ask all of you when we come to the house of God why do we come here we come here to hear the word of God if we come here for any other purpose we're here for the wrong reason I want to see my brothers and sisters I want to fellowship with you but the first part is fellowship comes after the word so that means when we come here whether we're in pandemic or not that that out there we should not be sitting seated out there and having conversations out there everybody with me you say be friendly smile smile shows you're friendly if you frown you know just just smile you might you mind to practice it you might have to practice it like one country I was in and I told the one brother I said I was going through this security check and I you know I'm trying to lighten it up I said there wasn't nobody smiling I was gonna say something you know lighten it up but I know if they'd understand me but when I got to that country the brother said oh no no no he said they actually have billboards out I'm not gonna call the nationality but he said they actually have billboards out trying to show them how to smile it's a mind you know it's a very oppressive country that they're in you know and and I thought my goodness men you'd actually have to have a billboard to to do that but you know let's whether we're pandemic or not let me just say this when we come to the house of God we ought to be coming in here reading this is exactly the instructions of the Prophet gave us reading our Bible and pray you can't you you can't just all of a sudden switch gears and that's whether it's musicians or who it is you can't just put on a gear I can't just put on a gear and start preaching we all all of this here it's an investment how we invest within these services and I want to invest in it when we come to stand here there's an investment I want to invest everything I have for the moments that God has given us so just remember that whether we're in pandemic or not you know the bench that's out there if somebody has a need during a service in either time I know some have one out there and set because something you know physically during that time and that's that's been okay but otherwise I one thing that I don't think is it good is if we're sitting out there on that bench before service and we're fellowshiping wrong order I said the wrong order we hear the word come here to hear the word first we greet we can greet one another they god bless you and smile at one another and then let's get ourselves ready for service after service you said well brother Samuel I've got to go after service then maybe you need to make preparations and stick around after service so you can fellowship with people man I've got a preach after this well the dream will need help god is so good god is so good you don't want to I just want to encourage you because the things that God has tried to speak to our hearts here in these services we've been looking at God has taken us it's that we might have a balanced walk even during the midst of this time don't let your spirit get vexed with things there's a lot of things that convex you and get and what happens when it starts to vex you and you get into your beliefs what happens which you don't realize is you can look and say my that's so wrong and you get pulled to this side you also closed yourself off from visitation you want to be available be available know you know so ah nine well let's look in the word maybe we need to sing a song [Laughter] Alleluia maybe we need to sing a song let's sing that song amazing grace shall always be my song well I'm not gonna ask you if you love me I'll ask you at the end of service oh let's sing it with all of our hearts just allow the holy spirit Lord just come in just water water our spirits set our hearts are right oh my let's see amazing if you like to stand [Music] my soul [Music] my [Music] Virgie [Music] No [Music] just why he came to now Oh beyond beyond and he saw hallelujah oh let's just welcoming now I shall [Applause] [Music] yes my lord the [Music] Jesus died for me [Music] [Applause] the grace that my falling through [Music] my pencil oh [Music] let's just go to him in a word of Prayer now Heavenly Father how mindful we are Oh God that we need you Lord I thank you for your direction lord thank you for your leadership oh god we you're the focus you're the desire of our hearts and our lives Lord it's you then we just desire that our hearts would just be inclined to your voice lord help us lord I pray may you come and minister to the needs of your children Lord direct me O God this morning Lord may you speak very personal Lord to our hearts and our lives we just give ourselves to you now Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord psalms 118 let's go there if we could and I want to just begin reading at verse one all night all give thinks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever let Israel now say that His mercy endureth forever let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever let them now that fear the Lord say that his mercy endureth forever could we just say that his mercy endureth forever verse five I called upon the Lord in distress the Lord answered me and set me in a large place the Lord is on my side I will not fear what can man do unto me the Lord taketh my part with them that helped me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes notice those two verses it's better to put trust in the Lord and to put confidence in man it just has mankind and all in one level then the very next scripture says even if he's of a higher rank we don't put our confidence in flesh our confidence is in the Lord simply put if the doctor prescribes you medicine our confidence you've got to have confidence and what being sad in the medicine but our confidence is in the Lord God I take this in the name of the Lord Jesus you're my healer Lord is that right so this is where this is where we reside so may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated this scripture and this thoughts that we've been addressing of being under his care having stability in the midst of instability the scripture in verse five is where I want to just draw attention to for a few moments and we'll just see how far we get this morning but here is David I called upon the Lord in distress and that word distress it means to be like in a straight in a confined place in a difficult place and notice as he called unto the Lord in distress the Lord answered me and sent me in a large place he removed me from a place of a strait of difficulties he lifted me into a place that David says has great expanse it's broad it's wide now notice he lifted me he transported me he caught me up from where I was at into this place it says in the amplified bible dialect reading in the scripture here the same verse out of the amplified bible says out of my distress I called upon the Lord I may know that that's exactly what we need to do when we're in the midst of a time of distress we've only getting there's one Avenue call upon the Lord and we don't have to have good nuba calling upon God doesn't mean we have to have flowery words it just simply means I said lord I need help don't I need strength right now he hears beneath all of the vibration of our words he knows what we need out of our distress I called unto the Lord and the Lord answered me and set me free and in a large place I look at this term as we've been dealing with pressure worry anxiety all these things this term of distress it deals with extreme anxiety sorrow or pain and at the scripture as it comes to mind because within our being were we we live in a three-room house flesh spirit soul god brother brems says it like this and the message life is the healer he said God came down and took the full form of man that he might redeem the full form of man we recognize that in the redemption that God starts with the principal part in our life yes his word God comes and gets our attention our mind has to go towards that word and it begins to think it begins to entertain remember the the the Lord could not do anything with Mary until he first got her saddled from the troubling in her mind is that right brother Bram tells us he is we're taught in the message how that God he says you first of all he says you've got to open your mind and let the word in so you Lisa because that's what has life and he separates the difference between how Christian Science take it and the rest of him but he says we must open up our mind and let the word in because the word is that which has life in it so a person as you this is this is where it leads into a birth many times a person is looking and saying well I've been praying I I really need the Holy Ghost I I need this I need this deliverance you've got to let the word in because it's the word that's going to perform the promise of the word and the word is the person of Jesus Christ is that right jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life so you first must let the word in and the scripture said that the word is a seed so we take that word into our life into a bedding ground and we water it water that promise knowing that when God when God speaks personally to your heart and there's a longing do you realize it's a longing in your heart when something strikes your heart and says that's what I want Lord that's what I have need of whether it's healing deliverance the baptism of the Holy goes whatever whatever the need is the promise of God I want you to understand it's God spiritually stirring your heart and you God's letting you know you've got a right to ask for that but in asking for it you've got to have your mind it's got to be open to now within within this it's got to be set in the proper in the proper place and so all of these parts that we are a three room house when God contents ended he came down to deal and to bring Redemption to our soul and then from that redemption in our soul when that life has been changed then we walk in this life and we know that awaiting as Peter would say in the heavens is a body undefiled reserved we know we have representation in the heavenlies Paul would write and said if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one in the heavens already waiting what's he dealing with he's dealing not with this he's dealing with the spiritual part which is that theophany which our human spirit we trade that human spirit and we take on that theophany so her soul clothed in that theophany that spirit body not that come from this world and then we receive a glorified body which is a human body with eternal life not you know it wouldn't do us good enough just to go back and be young again why we still got the same problems we've got the same in situations there's good to come a change that goes beyond just the atoms of our bodies but it comes according to God's Way not according to how we came after the fall through sex it must come by the word the same way that the change comes in your soul it comes by the word of the Lord Jesus said when he breathed on him in John 20 he said receive you the Holy Ghost showing that man would be born of the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that comes through the word is that right jesus said the father will send the Holy Ghost in my name what is his name it is the word of revealed that reveals Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever so then the same God that moves and Express and he speaks and our soul our life has changed as we yield ourselves to the Lord just listen to me now be patient and look to God don't get all in a hurry and well I don't see this or I don't feel this just the Bible says wait on the Lord be of a good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart listen to me seed of Abraham if you don't see it today be looking for tomorrow if you don't see it at breakfast be looking for it at lunch if you don't see it at lunch say I'm waiting on it I'm gonna look for it they buy dinner dinner don't show up I'm gonna look up before before bedtime what is it we are people of a promise hallelujah that have a sure expectation so every promise is that way so the same God who would speak by his word and the life is changed soul is quicken it's the same God we're jug said he will come and I will answer job knew it would be the voice of God that would bring him from though joke the the skin worms devoured this body though it's long gone but God's voice what hell he brought me to himself he will bring me out of the grave so what is it if the the direction God bringing us to a completion to where our lives become word through and through soul the spirit that's theophany and then the body that's why brother Bram says this body he said just as your soul was born again this body's got to get born again but I'm grateful the same God who brought the new birth to my soul ties me back into my representation in the heavenlies Amen is the same one will change the atoms of this body so with that being said when we look at how that we are made up of soul spirit and body here we are many times you find brother Branham when they come on the prowl or up to the pulpit but the branch says oh it says I see you're a Christian he said I catch that he said that vibration in your spirit brother and I just heard him just just just yes and they were just yesterday and he's going through that he says look he says I catch that by their spirit what's the vibration of their spirit and the Bible says in proverbs 20:27 the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord I'm not going to ask you how many like can't I like candles the joy of my wife my wife says when she sends me to get candles you know what can I get I don't get kind of smell like flowers I get the kind of smell like cinnamon rolls [Music] baked apple pie man that smells good but you know what the candle sometimes there could come a strong gust and could put that candle on it don't mean that it's not a candle it just means it got to get real it and see when brother Branham says I can tell by your spirit you're a Christian now the person in their spirit somehow that you know it doesn't change them from being a Christian they're not you know out there in the world it doesn't they they love the Lord but they need help in their spirit and I'm I can say this here as God came down to take upon the full form of man to redeem the full form of man he manifests himself his mercy endureth forever 2nd Timothy this these are things that I find how Paul would write let me just read a few places of this Paul would write the Lord Jesus Christ be with vice spirit grace be unto you a man and Philemon 1:25 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Galatians 6:18 brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit amen he's writing to brethren normal is he with yeah he's with us he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us but here is just an admonition I want him to be with my spirit you know there's transitions of life we're in transition right now and there's transitions that's beyond things that we've had to make changes this or that or there's unexpected happenings there's things that's happened this year within the congregation and besides the pandemic that we never expected to happen let me just say this if this isn't we're not ignorant as believers that the things that are taking place have been laid out scripturally and God has sent to us a message not just to identify those things but first of all be able to come and direct us to a place of safety calling us out to himself that we might take shelter under the wings of Jehovah then as we're here in him we look and we see all those fearful sights that are coming but we have a rest I can face tomorrow not dread tomorrow face tomorrow why because he live and he said because I live you shall live also [Applause] just as surely God bless you my it's good to see you forgive me I just get so caught up it's really good to see you but a Dave it's good to see you too really really love brother really love them so even in even in the conditions of life you know there are certain things that are conditions of life that happened there's changes that take place in our bodies and our emotions we need the oversight of the holy spirit one thing I'm grateful when you read Psalms through 139 David said how precious and wonderful are thy thoughts concerning me they're too high for me he said thou knowest my uprising and my down City thou knowest my coming in and my going out and I I want my heart just to be our prayer to be like Solomon when Solomon what was placed before him of your going here you are coming to the throne and he sees all the responsibility look at the humility he doesn't say well I can do this I'm of the Kings lineage no he goes to God in prayer and under the sacrifice he said will you direct my coming in and my going out will you direct would be the all between be him who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks be the Alpha and Omega and the in-between in my life mold has shaped my character for your glory that's a seal coming and going he's asking for that what a comfort that is and to know this he's a faithful and merciful high priest who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities rule Branham here in the beginning of the message indictment he's talking about sister Hattie sister Edith you know how she was born I want you just to follow this here he says now Edith had his sister we know as a little girl that's been crippled up since she was a baby she's a woman now she's and she's in very bad shape about a year ago I went down there when she had her first spell and immediately I found what her trouble was by the help and grace of God now really what the trouble with the child she says she's setting her limbs are hit together she can't even move them apart it's because of the tremendous pressure on the nerve system but what it is there's nothing physically wrong with the child outside of the affliction of infantile paralysis when she was about six months old he said she screamed and cried all of her life and we prayed for for many years and she's been happy ever since until about a year ago and now it's really menopause in other words the changing of her life and her nerves are in such a tremendous condition and the little lady has got on her mind that she's dying she's just not going to live just from one hour to the other you know he says healthy strong women have terrible times sometimes have to take shots of hormone and go into the institution and take shock treatments and everything during that time look at this the human being has two changes of life I'm grateful than revealed word come to lead us through this the human being has two changes of life he said the change from a boy to a man from a girl to a woman about sixteen seventeen years old they get like a bunch of just fly-by-nights and if you can just suffer with them during that age notice suffer with them but it makes you want to just tell your mom and dad thank you thank you for suffering with me how do you suffer it comes by understanding in understanding doesn't mean you understand all the components and all the parts it's just like for young people brother Bram says right now he said if you went and spoke to your parents or grandparents about the temptations and tests you're going through he said or they told you their temptations from back then he said you would laugh because the temptations are so much more before us and present that's there but there's one thing that doesn't change no matter if it's lion bear or Goliath he's the same God it doesn't matter what form he come the Lord Jesus is the same so during that age he says now I got a daughter in that age right now Rebecca pray for and billy-oh every one of us we come through that little frantic age we must suffer with them realizing it's something that they have to go through Wow so look at this he never said well we'll just pray and get him out of it no no they've got to go through it there's certain things we've got to go through we can't just say we're going to escape this know some things we got to go through but I'm glad the Lord is on my side I'm glad I'm not I'm not alone I'm glad he's there with me he said now either this changing he says of the seven years every seven years your life changes now don't strive trying to do math in your mind figure with seven of my own every seven years your life changes so the seven times seven you see it makes it kind of hard and that's a complete change it bothers the women men usually get a kind of funny and carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are unfertile after that and we go through that notice and we all go through that and we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things bearing with one another doesn't mean that it's easy for us it simply means that we're looking at the one they're going through it and no look many times in our being we want to just say this is not so this we're not gonna make this so this is not so in the name of Jesus Christ that doesn't make it go away there's certain parts and things in your life you must go through but he said I will be with you is that right it's just like how the enemy would want to come and try to bring fear for a woman going into childbirth barring God does not remove childbirth but he says I'll be with you got a promise of his word and these changes that come about understand what I'm saying now this is not we're not walking around here like well I guess this is gonna happen I gotta go through it that's not at all the way the Prophet is putting it he's letting us know do not look at it in an anticipation that brings anxiousness neither during the time tried to become anxious because this person's like this or this person's like this and what is he saying let's direct our focus to God and little Edith has gotten this condition she's lost much weight she looks bad I tell you some night listen this some night not all of you together but just a little trip down they set up with her all day and night a little trip down there from this Tabernacle and with the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here some of you people go down there and see the Wright family I'm sure they would appreciate it just go down set with them a little while talk to him shake their hand and if no more than a little friendly visit brother Samuel we're on social distancing isn't it funny how we use things to our leverage preach brother Samuel I will we're on quarantine no this is part of the body when one member suffer we all suffer so you know there's other things we can do we call text we forget look what he says we include himself we forget that so easy you know and when it comes to our own home then we appreciate it we must remember others appreciated too and the Wright family I'm sure would appreciate that I know you would have done it if you hadn't knowed this condition existed but you didn't know it so therefore I was telling you this morning for it go and visit the Wright family and tried to cheer Edith up now don't tell her she looks bad tell her she looks good brother Samuel but you know how terrible Edith looks she looks bad but look at her in the promise you look good you look good don't worry sisters when your husband tells you you're beautiful he's not easy means it so don't try to guilty let your mind get on he means amazing huh oh my gotta straighten that one out now don't tell her she looks bad tell her she looks good she she's going to be fine which she'll be alright if we just keep holding on for her that's what we're here for she is our sister and we're here to hold on in these times for that child just like I want somebody to hold for me and pray while I was going through my trials and you want somebody for yours one of the things that bring some of the greatest distress and pressures and intentions like we've been looking at letting off the pressure one of the things that brings that so much is when we don't have a certainty of an ending point doctor how much longer it's getting better you're doing good he's getting better you're getting there well how far along on my getting there am I getting there how close am I getting there am I getting there right that's us that's us now I realize some there's some times when I look at things you know that years ago I could look at those things I think my you know I had it you know had no experience with those things but sometimes there's things that comes your way and you as you know you don't have any definitive of well right now it's over with and many times let me preach now many times this is where we lose the victory that God gives us this is why for the RAM would say over and over all that I could come and set up a tent and teach on divine healing because so many people after their prayed for they lose it because after a time they start looking at their symptoms when it's the very time you need to hold to the promise of God and say we have found the word I know I'm standing the promises man and we stand on that word devil you're not taking that from me this is why to hold the promises that God has already made real you know sometimes sometimes there's things that you run into that you come into sometimes the casting out sometimes as Paul deals with the casting down we as brother branham we were reading that last week at a great speller fought and he was dealing with how this is God's method God's Way cast him out when that when when an imagination comes against God's Word cast him out when Satan tries to stick up his head cast him out you know as he keeps on bringing that down in Scripture casting him out sometimes the casting of an hour can truly be is God can come through your husband your wife can sit there and pray for you hey they're anointed with the Holy Ghost it can be a gifted man that can pray and cast that away sometimes the casting of it away it comes by the truth jesus said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free think about last week David said in all those in the multitude of my thoughts in the disquieting thought so I think and get off on all these branches and these limbs and these things get all under twine that comforts didn't like my soul why you have to come you come back to the truth and when the clouds and the enemy wants to try to swirl and this and that when you come back to the truth it takes the radar screen and says oh these were stormy skies that a the man it's changed it's clear it's sunny now Brabham talks about this and I don't I'm a just refer to certain parts of this here we'll see here comes another a little sister into a situation just like what we read about in the message indictment but I'm say here come a little lady not long ago and saying that someone told her she had seven devils another person said she had only five that's that's confusion and she wanted to know where it where the four went poor woman plum gone nearly sat in the room taking off her stockings pulling her hair up in the chair said I haven't eaten for several days and I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those Devils and said what are they names I don't know I I never know nothing about it said well one minister told me I had seven the other lady minister said I had five and there's two of them gone somewhere and she come and she stayed there for about two hours in the house until God began to speak and said lady listen you come from st. Louis huh aren't you glad no God knows you [Music] she said yes how did you know I said your husband's on the police force that's right I said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right I said recently your house looks like a hog pen said that's right I want you to catch this here something has happened that's disturbed her life something has come that's disturbed her life I said your daughter's over there right now taking care of your husband that that's right who told you that I just kept talking because I was in a vision I said you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor yes he give you shots yes those shots was called hormone yes I said you went down to a place and they told you at Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes see this she said I have a real funny feeling oh you've got Devils look where it's put this look where it's put this lady hold on I'm so grateful for the discernment of the spirit that comes by the word no brother joy it just comes through sometimes we look at it situations it I don't know right now because it isn't about us if God gives an unction right then then God gives it if not we know one thing I'm gonna wait on the Lord yes they sent you to California yeah some man told you at Seven Devils yes you went to a woman she said you had find out yes and they told you to come to me yes that's right how did you know that I said the Holy Spirit said so you haven't got any Devils to begin with that's right she said I haven't I said no lady surely you know you're a minute your mother went through the menopause it's the menopause something natural and I said what do you think then hormone shots are for I don't know for the change of life that's what it is no Devils and all it's just absolutely it's just your condition of life she began to relax my wife was cooking some bacon and eggs out there she began to look around the house and I said kind of hungry she refused to eat it first then she said yes she went out and ate 38 mm-hmm a big bunch of toes two cups of coffee a lot of jelly and she was just as happy as she could be remember she hadn't ate in a long time she said brother branham are you going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast wood away she said that you know the thing there's nothing to cast away she said well I never felt so good in my life what must I do you ready I said go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie I like that about that thick that's open to interpretation when he comes in tonight throw both arms around him kiss him sit down get on his lap and telling you love him and live like a lady ought to that's all there is woo I said he cares for you [Applause] here she was thinking miss this situation I've got Devils on me because I feel funny this way but God in His mercy his mercy endureth forever they came down and set this little woman free brother Graham said see all the pouring on of oil all the stomping kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good it's the truth that makes you free that's true how many's a witness of that it's a truth that makes you free [Music] when perplexing Trucks another thing comes around but thanks be to God there's a truth that comes forth and truth sets you free this word has power in it [Applause] the devil can take this word and try to bring fear but when a God gets ahold of the Holy [Applause] Prophet said doom Devils are on the run true exposes him they come mighty God the same God that descended in this hour the angel of the Lord and took a little profit and he failed himself and spoke through that prophet and spoke this message to you and I in this hour God knew we would come through conditions in our life he knew sorrows he knew there and he said I'm not gonna keep him from you but I'll tell you what and your shepherd [Applause] my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth me thank God for the green pastures and thank God for the steel waters troubled waters it's hard to see your reflection but he brings you two skill waters still waters run deep and where there's stillness God speaks and you can see yourself who know repeated God whoo hallelujah pardon me I'm just trying to determine where I want to go here next they're gonna help me the Bible says in Philippians 4:6 be careful for nothing that phrase means don't be anxious for nothing I realize we can say we could say to one another don't be anxious that don't do it it really just wait don't worry they don't do it but if I said brother just lay when you walk into that hospital and you walk into those room it's normal the Son of God has walked into that hospital and he said to you lo I am with thee always that's different his focus is not honest don't worry he's already focused on his worry he has to focus on the one who said I'll never leave you nor forsake you [Applause] hallelujah glory be to God be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely but but on the first part of it we just eliminated the news whatsoever things of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things I want to get deeper in the love of God but the Branham asks a question how do we get deeper in the love of God he said pray and read your Bible we've got Bibles we've got apps we've got on and on and don't make prayer and anxious thing either I'm just preaching as he's delivering don't become anxious about I've got to get home I got why wait till you get home pray while you're in your way prayer isn't about a list you've got a complete sometimes with with with with praying sometimes the needs mount up a night you know have needs come from here is this comes in on a text it isn't even from the assembly and this comes pray for this brother this situation it is and this and I'm thinking there's enough needs right here I honestly I feel like God I need to just have a notebook just wrote down sometimes brother really I just grabbed the the phone directory if it went up to date others got blessings as well but sometimes grammars say God but there's other times you know it comes to you but the thing of it is brother Carlos you don't have to wait till I'm in prayer it's even when it comes to your heart don't let it be a tradition just as it comes to your heart you might say oh no I forgot to pray for songs or if it just come to your mind well I'm just getting ready to step out the door to walk in the Bursar's door just by your hand saying Lord be with brother sister so-and-so and go on don't let prayer become anxious the Bible said pray without ceasing this is what a key inviting the peace of God that will keep our hearts and our minds it affects even the things that we're thinking because many times the things some of you medical people you understand this and a lot of the things that I've studied and had to take different things on that then when you look at anxiety and things with teaching and so forth many of the things that that they wanted they want to deal with they want to hand people and I'm gonna to understand me I'm not against this somebody taking this prescription or that but really when you get down to it there's certain nutrients that a person's lacking one of the key and this is not a health class but one of the keys is potassium and salt people aren't taking in certain things so there's no transport that actually helps even the firing in the brain and what happens the enemy gets on it gets them in that and then they're they'll run to certain things oh my goodness I I feel bad huh I need you know what I need right now I need a Big Mac a Big Mac Oh help me right now and what is it doing it just doesn't more harm what does that see ants how the enemy wants to work he wants to try to work let me just tell you when God redeemed you he redeems you to work through you he said be ye witnesses of me all of us come into the suite you come in two times sometimes some of you maybe deal with it a little bit more than others let me just say to you like this don't add an addition on to your home for anxiety is that okay don't say well you know what we were maybe we'll just give anxiety the master bedroom and we'll move over to here whatever you call it now we'll just move on over here we don't want to make admissions the Bible said give no place to the devil [Applause] and I think in the time that we're living in I don't know if you just read the article here this week one of the said CEOs at the Cleveland Clinic one of the things that they've been dealing with is that from cardiomyopathy broken heart syndrome people dealing with pressures and stresses from this time I understand we've got the scripture men's hearts are failing for fear we understand that part of it you and I are not exempt from feeling the stresses and the pressures we have loved ones different ones that's went through it even here in the assembly that's why we need a God with skin on it we need his help in his direction in this time let me just say this very there's things that there's things sometimes you deal with you might get fluttering or you might seem like mine why don't I saw intenser why don't worry my sayings that exactly sometimes you feel like you know why or let's go to bed I'll just get out on the other side and get up to know something what should I do I call on the Lord out of the stress help me help me and he answered me and he set me free and in a large place you're in the place of refuge a strong town a place where the pressure you can release it you get pressured but you've got a place where you can sometimes it sounds stronger than other time but you got a place you can release remember it was what Adam listen we understand the spiritual part that Adam and Eve but it's the part when they fed on the wrong thing they realized they were naked you with me now they begin to feed on the wrong thing and it brought fear if you go to feeding on the wrong things listen to me there is no Marvel we are still in this humanity it's brother branham would sell us over and over you hear him in the prayer line Satan I know you're more than a match for me but you're not more than a match for the one I represent see it's where the focus is at but if we're feeding feeding on the wrong things entertaining the wrong things what happens it's removing us from focusing on our garment our clothing it's under the blood greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world we're living in an hour so how to be here even have a greater focus and setting aside your time getting into the word doesn't mean you have to study like a minister so we're talking about it's a sister you can play you can play the message while you're when you're going through the house cleaning well that would be a reverent nor didn't you you pick up what you need to hear then I'd love to listen to the message when I'm walking or I'm working out or I'm planting flowers my mind feels like it's just it's just opening now that's me that's me maybe you like to set it and sit in the pool of your room and you've got your nice glass of cold water or lemonade or whatever it is and what's important me to tell you something you're feeding the inner man you're feeding the inner man even when you're blowing through and reading and say oh my you know I can't understand all that in the book of numbers and you know Jeremiah's here in Ezekiel's here don't you're trying to use this to understand it just read it and say lord give me my daily bread so you don't even being anxious about the things that belong to us bran would tell us be simple be natural vennett the young man was bound with that homosexual spirit come with the brother branham well what would have been visiting us oh man yeah I go to eat today I know brother Branson just wait till we finish our soup what if he'd had steak let us finish our steak understand that wasn't telling us to ignore things it was just saying God's right on time just rest let me just I don't want to lose all this let me just let me let me just read this here a situation that has happened in life a sister says brother branham something has settled over me that I cannot breakthrough last fall I dreamed I was lost in whites and it was getting dark and I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now I am as one grouping in darkness Irvin and wife were included in a dream they also are in darkness we are in desperation I believe God will show you what is in our hearts now if we are wrong or sinning places tell us we want to be right I don't know lady but I just feel if you're here lady that here is your trouble you have let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in White Sands represents purity and righteousness and you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights now notice I balancing it stop doing it claim you've got given rights there's not just saying well don't worry don't be anxious no clean you've got given rights your dream proved by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything's all right it's you you're south you're nervous you let one member of the family getting nervous it goes to the next member the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family's upset here's the diagnosis it's safe then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them rejoice with it so every one of the family try to do that did you catch what he's saying here he identified it's Satan doing it but he's letting them know you've got to claim your god-given rights you're not coming in this house that way you can walk right over there devil get out it was like you know the guy was driving in the and the car the devil is over his shoulder he stopped open the door get out I don't advise that on the on the freeway but you understand it's balancing these things I did you say oh don't worry don't be anxious but it's claim your god-given rights if nervousness breeds nervousness preach nervousness then what about joy and rejoicing Alleluia hallelujah the angel of the Lord is with his word here we go I'm gonna close we're just up here try it's one of you watch try each one of you children to help your Papa mama I like that try each one of you you're

down of strongholds who would have thought the jawbone of an ass hood would have wiped out an entire Philistine army it wasn't the Ox code or the job of an ass it was a man yielded to God and that's what the message from the throw from the lamb come to let us know in this hour yield yourselves unto God as the prophet said it wasn't I who saw the visions it was an I who did these things I just happened to be standing present when he did it oh I love that let stamina try each one of you children to help Papa and Mama out Papa you try to help the children we need one another in the truth out of the mouths of babes you have perfected praise hey don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you you are Christian brother Branson when that gloomy spirit would get around Abraham whatever brother I'm saying good as never he say you take out your sword and you chop at that thing if you watch the words he says and greatest battle ever fought chop that it chop that it chop then he keeps on coming through the message why because sometimes one doesn't fall the first time you chop at it don't you ever disbelieve your weapon shop that then fall chop at it again why cuz the word has never no I said the word has never lost [Applause] when somebody let it go they lost but the word never lost gotta raise somebody up else up and say here take this word and they have confidence in the Living God then when they swing that it's not them swinging it's God directing their little errand this trying to help out right from the rest them hey I don't mean to call you out but you don't understand oh the rest of it was just saying is children Zachary you trying to help out as young people that's for one another and you know what God is faithful let me mama God's been good to us ain't

set me free in a large place Oh God let's pray and you want to be remembered in prayer this morning god bless you god bless your hands we're here as soldiers Satan's army remembers your prophet our prophet told us Satan's Kingdom is worried frustration all of those things sickness but God's kingdom is life peace and joy you remember as a son and daughter of God we're not coming before the throne
