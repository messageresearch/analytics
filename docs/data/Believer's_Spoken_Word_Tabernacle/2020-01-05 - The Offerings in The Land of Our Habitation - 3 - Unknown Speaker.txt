be a Christian this morning hey man we're so thankful for the mercy of God just to really say I certainly appreciated the specials and neither the sunday-school those kids my goodness the instruments and Silas wasn't even playing his violin today so we've got to just really appreciate that he's I got to hear it a little bit the a couple weeks ago I think it was I got a chance to come in here and sit down after the services were over and hear them playing and I think even Breanna plays the saxophone and things now as well and Jonathan just a tremendous job amen all the young people those singing those songs and I tell you some of those songs are a challenging songs I just have to listen to them but you know a lot of those those songs right there have such a meaning to it it's so tremendous when you if you ever have never even ever taken the opportunity to read the history behind those songs and I know they're they're sung we we hear a lot of it at Christmas time but it wasn't based around that much of the inspiration of just as some tremendous things that are wrote there and what it has a meaning to our hearts and so we just we thank God for that and I just want to say you you you kids did a wonderful job and of course they wouldn't have been there but sister Roseanne and somebody had to bring that all in line and that was a lot of work but to do that so thank you for that that's a lot of a lot of sacrifice there so well we want to turn our attention to the word and I'm just gonna see how the Lord will take us I don't know if I really have my preaching gear right now so we just we're just gonna look into the word and just see how the Lord will take us I'm not contagious or anything just so you know when I did get back and everything they did say I had bronchitis but so you just pray for me because even today I just had the boys pray for me before I came the church I just feel just you know how it is you're still just trying to gain strength you know back in your body but and that that tickling of the sometimes years from the coffin things I'm not complaining about myself I'm asking for your prayers because I it's it's so hard for me I don't like feeling this way of course nobody likes feeling that way you know but so let's just look to the word of the Lord this morning so good to see each and every one of you some of you haven't seen you in a little bit I know I've been out here with the when our youth retreat but we just want to turn here to number 15 and I want to look just a few verses of Scripture go back into our thought this morning on the offerings in the land of our habitation and just ask the Lord to help us this morning as we look into his word in verse 1 of numbers 15 says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them ye be come into the land of your habitations which I give unto you and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a free will offering or in solemn feast to make a sweet savour unto the Lord of the herd or of the flock then shall he that offered his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal flour mingled with a fourth part of the in Avoyelles the fourth part of the hint of wine for a drink offering shall prepare with the burnt offering for sacrifice for one Ram let's just bow our heads as the ward it's to come Lord Jesus we thank you father for what you have made away you have given us Lord an opportunity to be able to come together once again Lord to a symbol of God around this revealed word in this hour both Lord where you have you have made oh God the Bible has become a new book to us Lord Lord it's not been the inspiration of seminary or minds of man but God this is an inspiration that has come straight from the throne of God and Lord with the preparation the very the very focus the very goal is that Lord Dara would be a people Oh God that are made ready for the coming of the Lord so father we receive this Lord to know that this inspiration that has come in this our Lord is for our lives God it's been poured out for the seed that is here in this our Lord so that our lives Oh God we're not just living ordinary lives we're living inspired lines where we've been inspired Oh God by the Living God the Word of God has come down all gone into our hearts and Lord I asked this morning may you just come and break the bread of life to our hearts you know every single need that's gathered here Lord you know every heart you know it Lord what questions there would be Lord you're the answer you're the dissolver of every doubt so I just ask that you'll come lord help me to step aside Lord just give me the strength in my voice Lord in my body as I stand here Lord and I pray for the congregation Lord may you have your way we pray and all things be glorified my lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you as you're being seated [Music] this this of which Moses as we've been looking at it as given to the children of Israel this is something that even right after there's been a great failure that would be there in the midst of the camp but yet after all of those things are there was restitution there's atonement God comes right along in the beginning of this chapter and is this is what has stood out to me for some time now is God comes right back around and says when you become into the land that I shall bring you into the one thing that we we see it's a theme throughout God's Word is that what God what God has spoken he is going to fulfill it sometimes it looks like things can be so bleak or so dark but the Brennan would say it like this in the message of endtime evangelism he would say when it looks like he said the message is in question and everything is around he said that's when God steps in and that's the very thing because within at all yet God Himself is the one that has vindicated it and he've indicates that working in our life that this is not this is not the words of a man it is God's Word and when we we'd see that this call into the land here when we are come into the land and a life would offer up these offerings and every one of these offerings are to be of freewill offering and we have laid that in that it is something that is not mandated or required but it is from the heart of the believer and that's exactly where God's achievement was is to bring his life into the very life of the believer so it is no longer you or me that liveth but it's Christ that liveth in us it's no longer you it's not me trying to bring forth the word but it is Christ in us bringing forth his own word and this this when we take just for a moment here upon the burn offering and to see that this burnt offering as God would even make mention to Aaron and his sons and let it be known that there should not be an offering offered to the Lord that would have any blindness and he may many halt anything that would lack of the quality and that of which God had laid down in his word for that to be offered up which that in itself were an offering that would be free from blemish and fault it would speak of one thing and that's the perfection of Christ's own life it would it would also in the burnt offering it would display the the devotion this devotion as the son of God to the will of God we see that throughout Scriptures without taking time to go through that all the way from where we see clear in Psalms where they were David prophetically is under the spirit and begins to express our sacrifice and offerings now what is not but a body hast thou prepared for me God provided all of these means sacrifice and offerings so that his people so that he could have fellowship with em but they were all speaking of one all-sufficient sacrifice and that is his own life through and by the blood of the Lamb whereby we as his children would be gathered there under that blood and his life inside of us then here we are in that perfection in Christ and that was all that is God's achievement through that that his own life would be present in our life we see the life of Christ where he would say and declare I came not down from heaven to do my own will but I came to do the will of my father and he would say over and over that I had that I do not seek to please it was not pleasing himself but he sought to please the father his his desire everything was given to the will of the Father and so when we see that it was such a and we look at this within the burnt offering it it speaks of the devotion of Christ's own life he was devoted to where Paul could capture this by the Spirit of God and Paul would would write and say in Philippians 2:8 that being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death remember there was a battle in Gethsemane there was a battle and and not guess M&E was not the only battle but even throughout his whole journey when he was here brother Branham would use the terms in the church age book when he was constantly badgered by the religious of that day and they would what they are the very ones that they should have been receiving him they said that they were waiting on him but yet they withstood him and they badgered against him but yet within it all he would apply the word think of the pressures that he was under those pressures came in that manner to try to break the devotion that he would have to the will of the father when he was tempted after he pulled up out of the River Jordan he's what goes through three of successions of temptation what was every temptation about to try to break the devotion to the will of God and then we find the even from those temptations here he has brethren in John 7 no man has a gift like this keepeth this to himself but he shows it out openly it was the same devil that was on the mountain that now was using the voice of his brethren he recognized that what was it to do to try to break the devotion from the Word of God and so when we see that that's what happened back in Eden that's been always the battle throughout every all the way down through the Scriptures his Satan comes to try to break that devotion between that of between that of God and man he cannot break God's devotion yet you can't break God's devotion man's devotion can alter but God's devotion remains solid this is why it's important that we have that life of Christ within us that in the center in the midst of our life by the new birth then it is the devotion of his own life even when we lack there is perfect devotion see this is why the perfection Paul would call let us go on to perfection Paul would write about by one offering you are perfected forever what's involved dealing with Paul's dealing with a perfection where it comes down into the very depths of the soul where a person enters in to that relationship with God where they are walking by the perfection of Christ on life so it is a devotedness to the word think of this even when you and I have fallen short and made we've made a mistake what happens devotion in our life to the word Lord forgive me see it's devotion its devoted it devan that deverson that devotion doesn't lessened with our walk when we look at the life of Jesus Christ and every other will look at a few characters this morning and to see their lives the devotion does not lessen but the devotion becomes more greater and greater and greater as it comes to the achievement of the purpose that God has for their life it never lessened but every time the Spirit of God is present to move us from one Junction from one point to another in our life you know we don't have to wonder or just rest or rely upon ourselves Oh am i in the right spot or am I in the right place brother Branham would say it like this he says when the Spirit of God it moved there upon the Virgin and here here come forth the the you know the the the child and he said then and he then preparing here he is you know and and John is baptizing the Spirit of God moves upon him to go to the river Jordan and then he says he may just taking a quantum leap clear true true to the time of Calvary the Spirit of God moves upon his life to go to Calvary you see it's alway it's being led by the Holy Spirit it's it's not URI that holds the Junction's of time and Andy the transitions in the music sheet but it is Christ and he alerts us to those changes and through those temples in our life that's why our life Okin score what the world looks at as weakness the world looks at it as ah you weak but we recognize it's not by my strength not by power not by my but by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed like David our testimony is the Lord is the strength of my life amen he is our strenght it is it is our strength is in the Lord so we find that all along in his life we've and seeing the very life of the Lord Jesus he was the sacrifice all along his life was a sacrificial life to think of even when he would want to go and and to minister to Lazarus before Lazarus was passing but yet he was held held in check by the will of God to wait it would speak of what God this right here what God did in Christ in and how that that was displayed that was the example that's the example of what every son and daughter of God is called to be now remember he said the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing he also said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me that doeth the works so today he brings it back to what that is bringing back to what was left in Eden where when the fall took place that holy image of God there was a separation now in Christ now comes the restoration of that holy image of Christ coming to where now it comes back into the life of the believer through where Paul could say it's Christ in you the hope of glory and Paul would call us and say you have borne the image of the earthly but now it is time that you bear the image of the heavenly Paul would come on to say into the Galatian Church with his labouring he says I travail together until now until Christ be formed in you is that right he would say in the book of Romans of how that of God's choosing and God desire for our life is that we would be conformed to the image of his dear son not that we would wear and we believe we understand this it's not about wearing a long robe or having the hair or having it's not about that it's not in his physical image but it's that our souls match the spiritual image of Jesus Christ and that's a sovereign work of Almighty God amen we that's is why the Bible can clearly say as Paul would tell us in Ephesians 2:10 that we have been created in Christ Jesus we are his workmanship we've been created unto good works ordained for that so here there's a devotion and through this devotion of his life it's to bring us in harmony with the Word of God there's one thing that has just soul I want you to ket I want you to catch this it's not just the Hutt's not just having the Holy Spirit here in our midst it's to have the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's what the message of the hour was sent to bring into our midst many churches then you'll find where they're the Holy Spirit falling but there's a difference the leadership of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth that has come to direct us into the word to where that our lives our lives that are founded solidly on the Word of God our experience like Paul when Paul meant that pillar of fire he went and he evaluated where is his life at what he met Paul never jumped up and started running he went for three years and studied and seeing what happened does it match the scripture that's why I say our life and a real experience of God it doesn't take us out of the word it puts us in the word because it is the word inside of us so it's a devotion of his life working through us God is devoted to his word we can look clear from the beginning we could spend much time with that even when the fell the fall had taken place God is devoted to his word no matter of all of the failures that have been when we see things down through of the Scriptures you can see God's determination look Jacob look in Jacobs life brother Ben would say it like this he said anybody that reads Jacobs life you cannot read Jacobs life and not see and believe in the grace of God Jacobs had his ups and downs and things and even after Jacob was changed and that mystery of Israel and his life becomes expressed you'll find times in his life where it'll say and Jacob said and then you'll find times where it says and then Israel why because Israel has to bring in subjection Jacob but when it came time for the rapture it never said that Joseph sent down the wagons for Jacob has said has sent their wagons down for Israel and Israel got on it's character that God is coming to rapture that's the mystery that within this listen this this is a product of a lack of devotion but this in here this new birth comes by the devotion of Almighty God that's why this right here is a constant reigning over and bringing it in subjection because the flesh is weak the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak but thanks be to God that there's a there's a greater devotion on the inside a devoted at the greater devotion and the Spirit of God dealing with our heart will stir even the devotion up in a life listen they take you know it takes a devotion before God comes and fully sets down on the throne of your heart it takes a devotion little by little by little but that's all him the Lord that's working in your life all along you know what he's doing he is preparing his own temple when he said a body has not prepared me you realize it's not asking you he gives you what's needed so he's preparing his own way the devotion of his life I think God for that the Bible would say it like this it would say if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory is that your testimony he's my life the dis every decision that is to be made it's made with him in the center if there's a decision to be made and it doesn't retain Christ in the center of all things then that very thing if it's seeking to take him out of the centre then it's not of God and it may listen to me now it may not be necessarily that that it in itself is wrong it's just when it comes down personally in our life in our walk with the Lord because our desire is is that we that everything in our life is a desire is to reflect Jesus Christ set our affections our hearts our minds and this is why Paul would would come in in in Romans 12:1 and he would say I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice notice giving over your bodies holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God what Paul is dealing with notice this is your reasonable service this is all you can do this is all I can do is do what is to give of ourselves to give of ourselves to the Lord when God has spoken is to present ourselves to him this like itll as and Paul would use this this term in the scripture your reasonable service it would be that of like like a sacrifice that is being offered it's being presented it's it's being given to be offered up this is our reasonable service it's a surrendering of our own life a surrendering of our own will and how many of you know that surrendering of our own will it's ongoing it's not just something that just it just it just begins at an altar or begins when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior note that that's surrendering it continues it's six or enduring and it's it's seeking after his will it's keeping - it's staying and surrender to him and this is where Paul just to kind of direct this here Paul is actually right here what he's Paul would be tying together Paul is reaching back into the Old Testament into Leviticus eight we're in that when the priests themselves were to enter into service they had to present themselves before at the door before Moses and Moses being the Prophet would wash them and anoint them and they would then come into service the only way a life can come fully into this place of service is to be washed by the revealed word of the hour amen you can't bypass it and say well I'm gonna bypass it you can't there's get on the ark when the person said well do you have to know Noah to get on the ark you're not gonna get on the ark without walking by Noah you can't get on the ark without walking by Noah because first of all hock achieve how could there even be anything about an ark that one that itself was a manifestation of the message God gave Noah what God spoke to Noah was invisible the word was invisible but then that word in Noah's heart it became visible it became what it became from word to a dwelling place it became from word to a place of safety a place where we could abide and dwell a man to be free from judgment hallelujah it's it's the grace of God so you hear coming into service you're coming into service and the word washes you the word anoint you for service and this is why that John could say in first John to 20 year from the Holy One and you know all things that unction is it speaks of that that anointing that is put upon you as a priest of God you realize that God has dealt with your life our life there's almost there's a two-fold part of our life we are kings and priests kings in that there is a reigning over sin over flesh over the world over the devil we are spiritual kings right now reigning with Christ right and we are also priests unto God we are were priests we're in that our lives are not our own our lives are not to be lived or not lived to ourselves but our lives are a sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord how could it be how could it be a sweet smelling savor remember the scripture said you must offer by fire but it cannot be by just any fire it must be by the original fire and that life that's offered up the life that's surrendered you know think of this this life as we said it continues to unfold decisions that we have to make you know you know what I'm saying decisions we have to make sometimes decisions that listen you're tested to go to your reasoning your tenured our devotion is tested by reasoning that's where Satan came to Eve in the beginning is by reasoning this is why Paul would come on speaking of the devotion and say cast down imaginations and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Christ with holding that devotion how how can we do that let's just be let's just be real here are we are we are trusting in that devotion of his life inside of us is that right but remember we've got to stay in contact with that life inside of us and what I mean is is that we're as feeding on the word praying and it brings us to a place to where we be we are more sensitive and giving the inner man the right-of-way instead of taking it away from him we want to give the inner man the right away because we know when we make decisions based on our reasonings and listen God's given us a reasoning is reasoning wrong know when it's with the Word of God but when reasoning is against the Word of God it's error is that right so here so we need we need that of the grace of God and say the Lord in decisions and things that are all around us remember even when brother Branham was going to make the decision to go up and become a trapper and and you know you always want to do that and so forth and and and and most of you know this here God put the decision before him if you go your wife's gonna leave you this is what you're gonna be you'll be a bum but if you want to do it go do it see God didn't say no please don't do it no see what God is showing God's showing sonship that's what God showing maturity does not you know what I think of it as we mike remember you know when I was you know younger and I know I'm pretty young but you know you were wanting to the man you wanted certain decisions you wanted to make man I can't wait to make this decision now there's things that I wish I could say here you take the decision here you take the decision you know you know what I'm saying because the decisions they come there is great responsibility with maturity comes greater responsibility comes greater decisions this is why the this is why this is why the greater the maturity in our life is shown by us recognizing our weakness and our need so much more for him that's maturing that's maturing this is part of that unction that's upon our lives that anointing go verse 27 it says the anointing what you've received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and there's no lie even as it had taught you ye shall abide in this the Spirit of Truth this is what is being spoken this is what John is talking about the Spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost it upon our life will direct our lives to bear the fruit of God in the season that we are in it brings its God bringing it all around it's the Spirit of Truth listen to me it's the Spirit of Truth that reveals the Word of God to our hearts this scripture here brother Branham would take this scripture and he says now if you read this scripture and you say oh I don't need it a preacher the other branch that see you just got the wrong idea about the scripture he said because why would the same God say this here and say that they're not needed and then played a play some in the church over here see it's a misunderstanding not by God but by a person because the one thing about it is is that the reality of the God when the spirit of truth comes in our life it does not make us independent it makes us reliant upon him because the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God that is that is the direction of a of a son of God when they asked Jesus why are you here this person on the Sabbath day you know he got confronted with that many times I mean these people are have been rejoicing but instead they're badgering him and in John 5 jesus said the father workers and I work as hitherto what what do you mean he says the son can do nothing but what he see the father doing Jesus was walking in this land of our habitation he was living in this place because what we read in numbers 15 is of a natural land but Jesus here came and lived within this spiritual land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the word to bring that evidence to show to you and I that this is a real land that you and I then could come and we could dwell within this land it was it was a place he was they were looking at they knew the word by letter jesus knew the word of my vision they could read it but there that they didn't have any connection with the author they knew it but no connection with life so to them what should have been life became death the very word that that's net that held within it the promise of life became death to them why because here in the midst of that they they were not in a place to receive from God I tell you it's a blessed thing to have your eyes open it's a blessed thing because it's the Spirit of Truth that reveals the Word of God to our hearts it changes it changes it from letter to spirit it changes it from letter to spirit from word to vision to manifestation it's the Spirit of God that moves that wants you to listen to this brother branham would put this in in the message look and there's a lot that is being said within this part here but he begins to express to us he says of how when Jesus came he wasn't just a man he wasn't just the third person of the Trinity he was God he was God himself he was Emmanuel and were taught in the Bible that were saved by the blood of God when God Himself became one of us he he changed his tent he came down condon sending from glory and became a man therefore born without sex he created himself a body that he lived in himself Emmanuel God represented with us the Word made flesh among us and lived with us the Word made flesh among us and lived with us to redeem many sons back to God through the shedding of this blood the body sure was Christ it was the Anointed One and if Christ means The Anointed One and he's the same yesterday today and forever he is the word then the word is the anointing if ye abide in me and my word abide in you then say what you will it's the word of god the anointed word that's what does it the word made flesh hear God coming down and it's that same word that was veiled that took upon that veil it created that veil and it lived behind that veil God's own life here the Holy Ghost and that same word now coming in your life in my life the anointing upon our life is the word it's the word anointing upon our life hallelujah the same anointing that was upon the life of the Lord Jesus for remember he asked a question can you be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with yes Lord he said surely you shall be we have received that we've not received a different garment when Elijah went off the scene he threw back his mantle when the Lord Jesus was sended on high he sent back the Holy Ghost is that right when the prodigal came home the servants went to get the best robe which is the father's role he was or doing adorned in the father's robe his life that word anointing upon our life so then that word anointing upon our life how is that becoming in our life it is the manifestation in our life that we have been brought under the blood cell we are safe in him I want you to think of this brother Branham would take a great deal of time laying this in and the message look and he's directing the focus of the people because what has been projected as what they need to be looking at it is not producing what needs to be produced in the lives of the people but God listen a prophet is a seer its eyes that's provided to the body to be able to take things that are out of line and blurry and be able to line it up so the church that was off target and off mark now it hits the mark who's working is this it's God who has devoted to his word for he said behold I will send unto you Elijah the Prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers it was God devoted to his word God sent the message to you and I because God is devoted to the promise of his word amen this message this message is an evidence of God's undying devotion and this message inside of you and I it is Christ that undying devotion is devoted to the will of God what was in the groom is now present in the bride that same devotion of life hallelujah who's done it he has is the anointing of the word upon our life a prophet has come in this generation and there is a word that has been given to this generation and the people of God have come under that word like Peter said humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God it was out of the right hand seven stars humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he shall exalt you in due time hallelujah I almost forget that I'm a little we've been brought under the revealed Word of the hour here listen like Samuel came and anointed David you remember Saul was rejected and God told Samuel go fill your horn with oil and I'll tell you where to go where do I go you go up to you go up to Jesse well if I go up there you know Saul's gonna kill me but he says here hide it in the sacrifice call him to call him to the sacrifice hide it in the sacrifice and they would come to this place what was it what was what was Samuel going to David with he was going to David with the word and the word was going to be poured out upon the head of David so David would be anointed with the word let me tell you something that word anointing it came from Almighty God God was anointing David as king let me tell you something inside of the anointing of this word it packs within it royal DNA yet box within it great-great transforming power you let the word just be poured upon your life and has the power to transform your life hallelujah in men in God through His Prophet in this generation has poured that anointing of the word upon our lives will not been anointed for another age were anointed for rapture hallelujah we're not anointed for defeat were anointed in victory we're one rejected and disobedience and counted things lightly like Saul but here David David Rises one who had not have been chosen passed over even the Prophet was gonna pass him over showing that this choice was not of man hallelujah the Prophet is off that he has either already given his message but God has seen fit to it when that message was given in this generation to be brought to you and I he knew who would be here and that word would find its mark because the anointing of the word has been poured out and where there are seeds of God to absorb that water they change it brings a new creation it brings forth a son and daughter of God hallelujah it's that revelation that's been placed in our hearts by the love of God breaks my heart to see people walk away just turn their back upon it and they re reason it out but that's if that's where if that's where they want to go they can go ahead and go we can disagree I'm not going to be disagreeable I'll disagree with you but it but when it comes to standing on this word this word is Jesus Christ [Applause] you can't debate this and to say that this is Error and this is that you come too late too late too late too late you see this is why this is why listen I hope you hear it you see and maybe the ponder this talk this is why it has been laid in soul I think before I was ever pastor here it was laid in and not just here not not drawing lines to that but what the Prophet would tell us in 65 even in the message of rapture he's drawing the focus of what this message is all about it is the revelation of Jesus Christ that has come to get a people ready for rapture without this message there is no rapture that is the promise of God's Word outside of its tribulation bound are you with me this is the Living bread of life that has come down to you and I of a perishing people we were perishing might have been going to church but perishing [Applause] sought for life but perishing but God who is rich in mercy hallelujah God who is rich in mercy he broke the bread of life to you and I you might have been sitting around it for years like me but then he comes back your way and it's not no longer just truth to you but you see I'm a part of this I'm a part of this it's a part of me what is that the bread of life it's the bread of life the anointing of the word has been poured upon your life that's why you see things differently you don't read the Bible just as words anymore the message isn't just words anymore you're not just listening to a prophets voice but you're hearing directly from the throne of God well done that the anointing of the word you'll never be the same the veil has been lifted from our hearts glory be to God how did that come about God devoted to his word and he said I have a bride without spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing what is bringing that about Christ's own devotion he's devoted to his word and in the midst of our life when we may be brother Carlos we we would say oh I don't know I I don't know but here in our life it's that rises up and says be in the house of God beyond our discouragement it don't feel like prama to say I need to talk to the Lord what is it it's the greater devotion of his life on the inside it's prevailing use one does realize that's why the Prophet said there is such prevailing power with revelation it's not this it's prevailing power it would be easier to stop the Sun than to stop the revelation in your heart it's prevailing power it can't be stopped that's why as I come back to this place this is why the message it doesn't mean I'm gonna be long it's more than just signs and wonders God vindicated this message the sign of the Messiah it's not just well this was just like this man's amiss no sir there's been a lot of other men that had a lot of other gifts and things like that thank God for that we don't despise that at all that's all part of the body but there's only one messenger to an age are you with me there's only one that has that sign and the word after the sign what is the voice of the sign that was free it's by faith can you say Amen the anointing of the word in our hearts our lives it brings us into John 5:19 this harmony it brings us into John 14:12 the works that I do shall you do also even where Jesus remember he would say if you're doubting me believe me for the very works sake he went what was he doing brother Branham would tell us like this he said in this I tyrant Age he said what Jesus was pointing them to is that the works that were made manifest through his life should inspire faith in him because the works tell what's on the inside is that right a sheep does not manufacture wool it bears right so the Bible tells us here let's hone this in on faith in our life and faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear for we walk by faith and not by sight hallelujah now James I want to go to James chapter 2 verse 14 and looking at this of faith because we we understand that faith faith is a divine revelation you a person you can't get anything listen to me now no matter where you're at maybe you're just in the beginnings of your journey maybe you haven't even started but the Bible is is very clear that who whosoever cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you must believe the greatest thing the greatest thing is to get your eyes off of yourself and a full surrendering of your heart he's the one to remedy that I I think I just read a statement here just yes just yeah yesterday and brother Branham was dealing in the service with with the people and he says that same spirit of God that has brought the repentance or the Pittman's penton's in your heart and conviction of where you have confessed your sins now he said may that same spirit of God direct your life for you in your life to bring a complete sanctifying see the same working now the Holy Spirit now it move is working within that life but it requires faith just simple what does what does faith mean faith doesn't mean you can explain it matter of fact that is not faith at all you and I have had like we talked about on Thursday night and ministering on that of patience if we got it figured out it's no longer faith but faith is just it is it is so here at James to verse 14 what does it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and hath not works can faith save him what is a good question in it can't faith save him please you say well you know immediately I go to the scripture in Ephesians 2 you know it's by grace through faith and not of works lest any man should boast and you know it's by faith well that we are saved by faith is that right but remember salvation when faith itself starts within a work salvation starts there's got to be works that follow the testify of what has been done in your life is that right a person is not going to surrender their life and then then then you keep quiet if you keep quiet it's because you don't believe but the very thing is when you give your heart in your life to God then you're to testify oh brother Sammy you don't know I still have so many different things in my life that's you're testifying about I am saved and you watch that confession it worketh righteousness are you with me and you confess that can faith save him now here James brings along if a brother-sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be you warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so watch out James just this continues to unfold even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yay a man may say thou has faith and I have works show me thy faith without thy words show me your faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works hmm now believe us look at this vow believe is that there is one God I'll do as well The Devil's also believe and tremble but will vow to are in other words put some action to your believing put some legs on your believing put some hands on your believing not just saying well I believe I mean there's a lot of people say well I don't understand I mean I believe listen belief we translate itself into action if you went to the doctor and they said you've got this and this and this and you're gonna die unless you get this taken care of and they have to you know you've got to sew your mouth shut or you have to do this stop eating this or do this or do that do you know what it you could walk out of the office you say yeah yeah I think it's got a good shot and you keep on doing the same things you've always done you would say you don't believe it but if the person believes it that's what they start making changes is that right do does everything change overnight some of you had to go through some of those things with certain dietary changes does everything change overnight no but a little by little by little by little change comes because why you believe and to believe and and listen to believe on what on what the doctor has said then look it begins to work out in your life what do people begin to see when you're at the restaurant they say what are you gonna have let me see here I'm gonna have no no red meat I'm gonna have the chicken I'm gonna have the vegetables and and this over here you know what people are seeing they're seeing a manifestation of a visit that you had privately with the doctor are you with me they don't add what they're what they're witnessing is the changes in the choices you're making it because you had a meeting with the doctor how much greater a meeting was god what comes out of that life there are things that change in that life based on that meeting verse 20 but wilt thou o vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect rock complete and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God so he says you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only skip down to verse 26 for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also I've got these in their sister Tabitha but just let me refer to these next quotes I'm not going to read him for sake of time okay thank you this is where when we're reading here in the book of James we read over in the book of Romans and recognizing of how that Paul would write I believe it's in Rome Romans 4 he would write of how Paul he was not justified by Abraham was not justified by it was not in works but it was in faith it would seem like James and Paul are contradicting but they're not Paul is writing what God sees James is writing what man sees James is a real pastor he can only go about what he sees come on now because because when we when we where we're looking at it here you know here's Paul he's seeing this and this is this is the beauty this is the beauty of it then even in our life when our life has as when there's been some faltering listen to me God's faithfulness does not waver our faithfulness can waver are you with me God's faithfulness does not waver so in the midst of that what God is looking at in the midst of it God sees that faith in our life but everyone else and but see God's desire is how that that that would work out in our life this is why that a person that without faith say if the faith doesn't produce works works a life becomes well I'm not talking about it just to say I'm not talking about giving fruit baskets to the poor that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about righteousness I'm talking about in continuity with a word right if if the testimony does not follow that then it then there is a right to question that faith it's like a person says well I believe the message and they don't go to church I got a right to question that you don't want you don't walk within the truth I got to write the question that all that you don't see my heart no but I see your for I see the feet on the ground I see what you're doing are you with me I've been we can look and see that's why prison well you know you you can't judge my heart nobody's judging your heart but what we see is works are you with me we see his works or I love the Lord what if you love to remember what is in your heart will come out whatever's in here will come out so is it all God looks on the heart thank God for that he does look on the heart but remember be not deceived what is in the heart will come out through your life be sure you've got good seed on the inside and if there's been something that's been taking away and hindering that say Lord forgive me restore to me the joy of that salvation bring me Lord back in line because remember Abraham even in his journey was Abraham's life always if I could say it was Abraham's life perfect no no but the word of the Lord which Abraham took into his heart was perfect it was perfect and God would unfold that word in his time this is why it would require see wasn't Abraham's works works alone but it took the holy faith of God brother Ram would sit like this the holy faith of God to unite with the holy works of Abraham it was God's holy faith that was revealed to Abraham you catch this God's holy faith revealed to Abraham God's faith for the hour do you realize that here Abram his name was Abram but it was changed at Abraham God put his last name he put his name his life his upon Abraham's life he didn't just come to the end of it he came and came in the middle of Abraham's life you with me why because as brother madam would tell us he said Abraham was called of God to reproduce the faith of Elohim God's faith that God had in his word you believe God has faith in his word God's faith in his word has never changed and that same God now coming in the heart of Abraham and putting that in Abraham's life so who was it it was God in Abraham believing what God had said hallelujah that's a real child of Abraham Amen walking under the anointing of that word he received it and there are the holy works they they come forth from his life I made it pause on Abraham a moment I don't have much longer I just just want to drop these two points and we'll we'll close but don't be focused on the close he focused on this now the Bible talks about Enoch and in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 it says by faith Enoch was translated then he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him you know how powerful that is even in listen that is what's going to take place with our bodies but what stay gonna take place with our bodies is what's already taking place with our soul we have been translated from death unto life the devil couldn't find us if he tried to to get where we are he'd have to come through the blood then he would be our brother we have been brought here at a new creation by the sovereignty of Almighty God the quickening power of God has translated us he delivered us as Paul said from the darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son Enochs life Enoch lived this life this kind of a life that we lived the Bible says Enoch walked with God the last part of that right there says before his translation don't wait till you get down before your translation don't wait so one of these days I'm gonna get serious it's time to get serious now knowing say when I retire that's what I'm gonna get more dedicated you may not have time it's time to be dedicated right now and let me just tell you something you don't need to be retired to be dedicated come on somebody this word right here the word Enoch his name means dedicated and dedicated is a type of the seventh from Adam this seventh church age it's this this group of people the overcomers the true lady Wilson's that are the true over comers out of Lady ousia that are caught away it's a capping it's a Enoch dedicated lives you know that speaks of you'll be everything and there is everything that is turned loose against us in this hour every demon out of hell is turned loose the lid has been ripped off revelations 9 all the demon powers that are streaming out in this hour but Enoch he walked with God there wasn't a word that God asked from Enoch and Enoch was an obedient - you know why Enoch was dwelling dwelling in the quickening power of God he was dwelling in that place walking with God when the Bible said he walked with God see this is the evaluation that has to move into our life this is the call into this land is a life of complete devotion let me just stop there because I let's just stop there this is the call and I would say from our hearts here this morning this would be thank you this would be what madness this would be of the desire and I trusted the desire and every one of your hearts Lord I want to be devoted they really let in our life remember that devotion it comes by his own life but I wanted but and if that life if you are not a possessor of that life why not be devoted to that promise that belongs to you be devoted to that and if that life is there was in your life then it's like his brother banner would make a statement I think it's in 65 it just was reading in here the other day he says you turn loose of everything turn loose of earthing brother brems his job and everything else you say you saying to quit my job what brother bran was saying and that whole statement is turn loose of everything that would be hindering you or holding you back let the Holy Spirit let me make an evaluation because listen we can either press down that inner man or we can allow the inner man to have his way we want to let that inner man have his way because it will always be directed into the word of the Lord let's bow his I mean I'd like to be remembered in prayer this morning god bless your hands amen Lord Jesus you certainly see Lord you know your God the depths of our hearts Lord as Enoch walked he had a he had a testimony before he was translated that he pleased you dear God if there's one here this morning that doesn't have and has not received of that life Lord may they receive that this morning may they not rest until Lord God that they've received that life may be one who hasn't made a start Lord that God may they faith or may they make that start this morning Lord give themselves to the word 'lord friend lives Lord the rest of the lives Lord it would be here lives that God that you you've placed Lord your life within and here we are but dwelling within you Lord Oh God help us like Paul would admonish us to seek those things that are above God may there be such an evaluation that comes across our life because walking through this land as you spoke to us here in numbers 15 walking through this land it's a land of devotion because we are born into this land by the devotion of God Lord a devoted life self-sacrificing life lord help us our our hands are up Oh God help us Lord sacrificing our own will Lord sacrificing our own thoughts Lord sacrificing our own leadings sacrificing reasonings Lord imaginations Oh God devotedness Lord single as Paul would saying as the Lord Jesus you had expressed to us in the gospel to be single let thine eye be single Oh God a clarity of devotion let everything be searched out Lord for truly in our life we don't want any hindrances Lord we want to please you Lord we want to please you Lord we've made mistakes there's decisions and things that have been done and through those things Lord we've learned sometimes Lord it's things right in the natural but we've learned and father within that learning lord is lord help us to be sensitive that learning is not always to take what just well it just think it just makes sense it's not what makes sense because Lord when it comes down to it crossing the Red Sea did not make sense it the way that you led your people the way you lead us to the carnal mind it doesn't make sense through tests and trials it would seem like to the carnal mind things should go easy lord help us not to live by earthly reasoning but help us to walk devoting our lives and give the inner man place the Bible Lord as it says to us acknowledge the Lord in all their ways and he shall direct thy paths father granite Lord for every Lord request behind those hands we ask this Lord for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen say Amen if you want to stand mister rather have Jesus and silver or gold I'd rather be his than average [Music] have Jesus then houses Oh I'd rather be late [Music] Stan's letter B [Music] so me or be head pensee [Music] I'd

just appreciate the Lord he's brought about in our life what the desire was and the desire is to think about you know the desire when the Lord would first take a hold of our hearts it's that in itself is a mystery beginning to unfold but there begins to awaken a desire and I want to serve you Lord there's an awakening of that desire that it's a dawning of his life upon our hearts as we surrender and a life that surrender to that then it becomes a reality of serving the Lord to where our lives are in service to him we're not just ready for service but we're in service and when we're in service we're also making ourselves ready as Paul would say in Timothy so that we are vessels that are meat for the Masters use available I would say there's not probably a heart in here that wouldn't say Lord I want to be more available just want to be more available more of an amen we're gonna let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord Communion and I think we could start here at 3:30 it should
