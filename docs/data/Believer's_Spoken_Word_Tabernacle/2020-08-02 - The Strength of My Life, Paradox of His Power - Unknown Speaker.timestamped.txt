[37:51] i want to say thank you we
[37:55] or my wife and i the the card and the
[37:59] different greetings that were
[38:01] love and greetings and love that were
[38:03] expressed and
[38:05] for that of our anniversary there
[38:08] yesterday and
[38:09] and i'm just so thankful to the lord
[38:14] 22 short years and
[38:18] it just seems just like yesterday and i
[38:21] just thank god
[38:23] because the lord the lord certainly has
[38:26] been so good to us
[38:28] he's so mindful of all of our needs so
[38:31] we just
[38:32] we want to thank god for that and thank
[38:34] god for each and every one of you
[38:38] we want to look here in the scriptures
[38:41] this morning
[38:43] and i'm just going to
[38:46] give a little precursor before i even
[38:48] start and we'll see where we get to
[38:50] uh this morning but
[38:53] i want you to look at this and we're
[38:55] just going to trust
[38:56] in in the spirit of god the spirit of
[39:00] truth
[39:01] to show and to bring that parallel
[39:04] of how that god is
[39:07] preparing to deal with israel and what
[39:10] the same god
[39:11] is doing in our midst right now we
[39:15] recognize
[39:15] that god cannot move back to israel
[39:20] until the bride has gone in rapture
[39:23] but all things are working
[39:26] it's all being set in order as a matter
[39:29] of fact brother branham
[39:30] you recall back in um um
[39:34] the mid 50s brother brahman says the
[39:36] angel of the lord
[39:38] is on earth tonight getting the 144
[39:42] 000 back there so the same god who was
[39:46] moving in those times and putting things
[39:48] in motion see
[39:50] god's working on all fronts
[39:53] at the same time and so
[39:57] i want to just look here in the
[39:58] scriptures and maybe just a little bit
[40:01] of a reading here
[40:03] but let's look here in verse 1.
[40:06] the burden of the word of the lord for
[40:08] israel
[40:09] saith the lord which stretcheth forth
[40:12] the heavens
[40:13] and layeth the foundation of the earth
[40:16] and
[40:17] formeth the spirit of man within him
[40:20] who is greater nobody
[40:25] you catch that no one is greater than
[40:28] him
[40:30] behold i will make jerusalem a cup
[40:34] of trembling unto all the people round
[40:37] about
[40:38] when they shall be in the siege both
[40:41] against
[40:41] judah and against jerusalem
[40:44] and in that day will i make jerusalem a
[40:48] burdensome stone for all people
[40:52] and all that burden themselves with it
[40:55] shall be cut to pieces though all the
[40:58] people of the earth
[40:59] be gathered together against it and
[41:02] that's what's going on
[41:04] there's a gathering i want you to think
[41:08] of this for a moment now
[41:10] all that was being gathered in the time
[41:15] of the lord jesus you had powers that
[41:18] were
[41:19] enemies with one another
[41:22] herod and and and and even
[41:26] uh my name the name slips my mind right
[41:29] now but the other
[41:30] ruling power that was there they hated
[41:33] one another
[41:34] but they were gathered together how were
[41:37] they gathered
[41:38] they were gathered in rejection of the
[41:41] word
[41:44] there's a uniting that's been going on
[41:47] are uniting
[41:48] against the word of god in this hour
[41:52] and who is it uniting yet holding
[41:55] scripture but it's uniting
[41:57] against christ and his bride the message
[42:00] that god has sent and remember the
[42:03] message is not a book
[42:05] it's not a tape the message is get under
[42:07] the blood
[42:09] christ in you that's the message
[42:13] did the message come not to blur our
[42:16] sight so we can't find the door
[42:18] but the message come to unfold the way.
[42:23] it comes so that was not blurred but we
[42:25] find we find a way
[42:27] so finding with sight we find clarity we
[42:30] find direction
[42:31] we find strength we find courage we find
[42:34] our position
[42:36] so this whole part here is working under
[42:39] that
[42:40] uh pale horse anointing it's gathering
[42:43] together there
[42:44] out of that fourth seal verse 4
[42:48] in that day saith the lord
[42:51] i will smite every horse that's his
[42:53] power
[42:54] with astonishment and his rider with
[42:57] madness
[42:58] and i will open mine eyes
[43:01] upon the house of judah aren't you glad
[43:04] he's opened his eyes upon you
[43:08] amen we're not seeing through our own
[43:10] eyes we're not seeing through the eyes
[43:11] of
[43:12] of a church we're seeing through god's
[43:14] eyes
[43:16] amen we are looking at ourself through
[43:18] god's eyes
[43:20] and will smite every horse every power
[43:23] of the people with blindness
[43:25] and the governors of judah shall say in
[43:27] their heart
[43:29] the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my
[43:31] strength
[43:32] in the lord of hosts their god in that
[43:35] day will i make the governors of judah
[43:37] like a hearth of fire among the wood and
[43:40] like a torch of fire
[43:42] in a sheaf and they shall devour all the
[43:45] people round about on the right hand and
[43:47] on the left
[43:48] and jerusalem shall be inhabited again
[43:51] in her own place even in jerusalem
[43:56] and the lord also shall save the tents
[43:59] of judah first
[44:00] that the glory of the house of david and
[44:03] the glory of the inhabitants of
[44:05] jerusalem do not magnify themselves
[44:07] against judah
[44:10] verse 8 in that day shall the lord
[44:14] defend the inhabitants of jerusalem this
[44:17] is the scripture i just realized
[44:19] i want to just minister forth here this
[44:21] morning
[44:22] in that day shall the lord defend
[44:26] the inhabitants of jerusalem it's not
[44:28] you defending yourself
[44:31] it's god defending you
[44:35] as he will defend them it's god
[44:37] defending his word
[44:39] we want to be in his word
[44:42] we want to be in him
[44:47] i don't mean to keep you standing but i
[44:48] think of how when the six day war was
[44:51] going on
[44:52] and you had these syrian tanks that were
[44:54] bearing down upon israel
[44:56] and they were coming in against israel
[44:58] and here you had just a group
[45:01] just a few men soldiers were out there
[45:04] in the wilderness
[45:06] and all of a sudden these in the tanks
[45:08] begin to get out of the tanks they stop
[45:09] the tanks get out of the takes and they
[45:11] begin to take off and run
[45:12] you know why because what they saw
[45:16] backing up these little few soldiers
[45:20] it was the pillar of fire
[45:24] said this is the father of abraham
[45:29] and they ran not big from those men they
[45:31] ran
[45:32] because the supernatural god was there
[45:36] to back up his word
[45:40] they weren't even in position yet let me
[45:43] preach a little bit i got you standing
[45:45] you and i were not in position in our
[45:47] life but god said
[45:49] you can't touch them right now
[45:52] we weren't ready that's why a bullet
[45:54] couldn't take you you weren't ready
[45:57] god said it can't right there he was
[45:59] right there
[46:00] protecting our lives
[46:09] and this this this this partial portion
[46:12] of scripture so strikes my heart right
[46:14] here
[46:14] and he that is feeble
[46:18] among them at that day shall be
[46:21] as david and the house of david shall be
[46:25] as
[46:25] god as the angel of the lord before them
[46:29] and it shall come to pass in that day
[46:32] now notice how it breaks back in come to
[46:34] pass in that day in that time see all of
[46:37] this is working
[46:38] that i will seek to destroy all the
[46:41] nations
[46:42] that come against jerusalem
[46:46] remember the israel was dispersed
[46:50] that was all the way prophesied through
[46:52] the old testament
[46:54] they would be dispersed because of their
[46:57] rejection
[46:58] of the messiah but satan
[47:02] has wanted to try to snuff out
[47:05] the lives of israel
[47:09] satan's wanting to try to snuff out your
[47:11] life
[47:15] but god says because you've vaulted
[47:18] yourself above my people
[47:20] i'll gather you together
[47:24] satan doesn't even the the nations don't
[47:27] even recognize what's going on
[47:29] but god's getting it all together
[47:34] that's why god allows that white horse
[47:36] that that gathering together this is why
[47:39] that it's the conquering and god allows
[47:42] the
[47:42] conquering to take place through their
[47:44] religion that's why all of these
[47:46] movements
[47:46] feed in to that conquering spirit
[47:50] it all feeds into it every movement even
[47:52] the present moments all feed in
[47:54] to that same spirit it's moving together
[47:57] to bring them into that place and it's
[48:00] moving through the nations
[48:03] but while they're moving and uniting
[48:05] there's a people on earth
[48:07] that are uniting with our promise
[48:10] we are uniting with our promise we are
[48:12] headed to the rapture
[48:15] we are headed to the wedding supper we
[48:17] are headed to the millennium
[48:18] we are headed to the future home
[48:21] hallelujah
[48:23] glory be to god and i will
[48:26] pour notice this in verse 10 and i will
[48:28] pour upon the house of david
[48:31] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[48:34] the spirit of grace and supplications
[48:40] and they shall look upon me whom they
[48:43] appear
[48:43] notice the visitation the outpouring
[48:46] of the holy ghost first makes them ready
[48:50] for his physical appearing
[48:54] the same parallel now the the token the
[48:57] holy ghost
[48:58] makes us ready for the rapture
[49:04] glory be to god hallelujah
[49:08] oh my we never started preaching yet
[49:14] and they shall look upon me whom they
[49:16] have pierced
[49:17] and they and they shall mourn for him as
[49:19] one mourneth for his only son
[49:21] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[49:23] one that is in bitterness for his
[49:25] firstborn
[49:26] in that day verse 13 verse zechariah 13
[49:29] 1
[49:30] in that day there shall be a fountain
[49:33] opened to the house of david and to the
[49:36] inhabitants of jerusalem
[49:38] for sin and foreign cleanliness that
[49:41] fountain is open this morning to you
[49:46] and to me aren't you glad it's been
[49:48] opened
[49:50] men have tried to close it up but god
[49:52] says i opened this fountain
[49:56] he is our life glory
[49:59] where men wanted to seal it up he takes
[50:01] the seals off of himself
[50:04] and it shall come to pass in that day
[50:06] saith the lord of hosts
[50:08] that i will cut off the names
[50:11] of the idols out of the land
[50:15] and they shall no more be remembered and
[50:18] also i will
[50:19] cause the prophets and the unclean
[50:21] spirit
[50:22] to pass out of the land how many
[50:26] know the word it cast out
[50:30] amen god bless you bless the reading of
[50:32] the word this morning you may be seated
[50:36] now i kept you standing now that time
[50:38] doesn't count against me
[50:43] oh don't you love the lord
[50:47] oh i just so appreciate the lord so
[50:49] appreciate his mercy
[50:52] amen i want to look here
[50:55] at a thought this morning if the lord
[50:57] will
[50:58] help us it just uh so inspired to my
[51:01] heart here
[51:04] the strength of my life
[51:07] paradox of his power
[51:10] the strength of my life paradox of his
[51:12] power
[51:15] we're living
[51:18] in a very unsettling
[51:21] time for the world
[51:25] all things is made known
[51:30] of those things of man and systems and
[51:34] institutions all those things and we
[51:37] understand it must pass away
[51:41] there's got to come forth a new
[51:43] administration
[51:46] because when man fell it brought
[51:50] death all of this had entered in
[51:54] sickness and on and on sin
[51:57] so we recognize that there everything
[52:01] that
[52:01] god has been unfolding in his great
[52:04] drama
[52:06] and we look at the time that we are
[52:08] living in right now to think
[52:10] of the scriptures of everything that god
[52:14] has laid in the scriptures
[52:16] the promise that god has made that only
[52:18] he alone can fulfill
[52:20] and that he himself is the way
[52:24] into the fulfillment of that word that
[52:27] god
[52:28] in this hour what all the prophets what
[52:30] all
[52:31] have waited upon we are standing
[52:35] on the threshold right now
[52:38] we are standing in a time it's a very
[52:42] uh a shaking time for the world but it's
[52:46] a very glorious hour
[52:48] to be a christian to be a believer
[52:53] to be posted as to what
[52:56] is actually taking place to have the
[53:00] discernment of the holy spirit in our
[53:02] lives to
[53:03] catch and to be able to look behind and
[53:06] see
[53:07] there are spirits trying to press and
[53:10] make their advancement
[53:12] but thanks be to god that god in the
[53:14] midst of that time
[53:16] god makes himself even more
[53:20] real
[53:23] now when we look at this in the
[53:25] gathering of heroes we're reading of how
[53:28] god will bring israel back because
[53:31] remember as they were as they rejected
[53:35] they rejected him but god
[53:39] in through the rejection remember now he
[53:41] comes to take unto him
[53:43] a gentile bride remember the scriptures
[53:47] the the the bible it is it is a complete
[53:50] book of redemption and to recognize that
[53:53] many that what god has spoken it's not
[53:56] it's not a historical book yet it bears
[54:00] history
[54:01] it bears the history of the same god
[54:04] working in the same way as he as he
[54:07] works even now and we recognize
[54:09] that it is a book of prophecy that of
[54:12] that in itself
[54:13] is something that it takes the holy
[54:15] spirit to come upon the word
[54:17] and make that a real to us as we look
[54:19] back into that
[54:21] of the life of joseph and to recognize
[54:25] that how joseph was rejected of his
[54:28] brethren
[54:29] but while he was there in egypt
[54:32] he arose in power and he took unto
[54:36] himself
[54:37] a gentile bride and was given
[54:41] the name zephaniah panea which is the
[54:44] revealer
[54:45] of the secret things and to find to
[54:49] recognize that there were
[54:51] conditions that god allowed to rise
[54:55] there throughout all of the world
[54:58] known world in that time god allowed it
[55:01] to rise
[55:02] so that israel the bible says the sons
[55:05] of israel
[55:06] so that they would come and they would
[55:09] hear
[55:10] that there's corn grain down in egypt
[55:14] because there was there's a hunger
[55:16] there's a desire
[55:17] to be satisfied let me just say this to
[55:19] you very clearly
[55:21] there's a longing in a heart that
[55:23] there's nothing of this
[55:25] world can satisfy
[55:28] you can try this you can try that you
[55:31] can try this
[55:33] you can try that it'll only leave you
[55:36] empty and in many cases
[55:39] scarred and in debt
[55:43] but there's only one thing that can
[55:45] really
[55:46] satisfy that fears that god has put on
[55:50] the inside of you
[55:51] and that is him alone
[55:55] coming to a church won't do it
[56:00] but getting to jesus that's what will
[56:04] satisfy
[56:04] that thirst it'll
[56:08] satisfy that hunger
[56:15] so here we find
[56:18] within this you know the prophet as he
[56:21] picks this up
[56:23] in looking at that of little benjamin
[56:25] because
[56:26] remember it was little benjamin that
[56:30] where
[56:30] joseph he said i want to see little
[56:32] benjamin but he didn't call it out
[56:34] remember he's speaking to them through
[56:36] an interpreter
[56:38] is that right what was that it's a sign
[56:41] of where we're at
[56:42] not only is a prophet a sign of
[56:45] impending judgment
[56:46] but remember the sign of the closure of
[56:49] god dealing
[56:50] with tongues going forth in the time of
[56:55] daniel it was tongues that were going
[56:57] forth it is a sign
[56:59] of a closure of the end of god dealing
[57:02] with the gentiles we are living
[57:06] in the in these last days in the message
[57:09] under that message that god premier
[57:12] promised there would be a
[57:13] finishing up of the mystery of god
[57:16] what is the mystery of god it's the
[57:19] baptism of the holy ghost
[57:21] inside of you
[57:23] [Applause]
[57:25] inducts us into the body of jesus christ
[57:29] it's god that has made up his body
[57:35] now how that remember they come into
[57:38] that place
[57:39] and how that this arrangement
[57:42] is made for little benjamin which little
[57:45] benjamin
[57:46] is a type of the 144 000 and this is
[57:49] where we recognize
[57:52] that the 144 000 they are elect but
[57:55] they're not the bride
[57:57] that's where jehovah witness got off
[57:59] that's not the bribe
[58:00] israel remember israel is saved as a
[58:03] nation
[58:05] god's dealing with the bride as an
[58:07] individual
[58:08] [Music]
[58:09] is that right to be baptized into the
[58:11] body of jesus christ but out of every
[58:13] tribe
[58:15] and how that god is assembling bringing
[58:18] them together
[58:19] there's been an assembling that's been
[58:21] going on god's been
[58:23] gathering them there in that place
[58:27] and making ready for this time
[58:30] and i want to just read this here to you
[58:33] where brother branham he picks this up
[58:34] and he's now
[58:35] speaking to to us he says where will the
[58:38] gentile church
[58:39] be while jesus is making himself
[58:42] known to his brethren remember that the
[58:45] bride of joseph
[58:46] with the two children were in the palace
[58:50] for joseph had commanded let everyone
[58:52] leave me
[58:53] put them all out from before me so the
[58:56] gentile bride
[58:57] was hidden in the palace of joseph
[59:00] where will the gentile church go in the
[59:03] rapture
[59:04] into the palace the bride will be taken
[59:08] off the earth
[59:09] she will be caught up before the great
[59:12] tribulation
[59:13] to meet her lord in the air
[59:17] i'd say glory be to god for three
[59:20] and one half years while the retributive
[59:22] wrath of god
[59:24] is poured out she will be in the great
[59:27] marriage supper of the lamb
[59:29] [Applause]
[59:30] the contrast thin is the same contrast
[59:34] now
[59:35] while the world is going insane
[59:40] we have found a place of safety
[59:44] we have found the place of peace
[59:47] while the world is trying to solve
[59:50] issues
[59:51] that can only be solved by the word
[59:54] yet this word has come and brought
[59:56] resolution
[59:57] in our hearts
[1:00:01] hallelujah well the world is going
[1:00:04] insane
[1:00:05] come on it's not just out there blah
[1:00:07] blah says insanity
[1:00:09] marching right down the church pew
[1:00:12] insanity glory be to god
[1:00:16] you have to thank god to have your right
[1:00:18] mind
[1:00:22] then will he return
[1:00:26] leaving his bride in his father's house
[1:00:28] so he slips away from the marriage
[1:00:30] supper of the lamb
[1:00:32] while he makes himself known to his
[1:00:35] brethren
[1:00:36] at this very moment the antichrist
[1:00:39] covenant that the jews have made
[1:00:41] with rome will be broken
[1:00:44] rome and her allies look how this is
[1:00:47] stated
[1:00:47] rome and her allies then send their
[1:00:50] troops rome doesn't even have an army
[1:00:52] so you think she has control of all of
[1:00:55] the armies
[1:00:59] who can make war with the beast is that
[1:01:01] the scripture
[1:01:03] who can make war
[1:01:06] notice roman her allies didn't send
[1:01:08] their troops to destroy
[1:01:10] all the god-fearing word abiding jews
[1:01:13] keep this parallel in mind
[1:01:15] when they are coming against the jews to
[1:01:18] destroy them the bible says
[1:01:20] i'm not going to read that this morning
[1:01:21] in revelation 11 when the two witnesses
[1:01:24] arise their ministry
[1:01:28] and the working of the holy ghost among
[1:01:30] the 144 000
[1:01:32] will torment the world
[1:01:36] why because the world is not going to
[1:01:38] receive
[1:01:39] what god is doing sometimes you wonder
[1:01:43] why people rise up against you on the
[1:01:45] job
[1:01:45] it's not this it's spirits
[1:01:50] it's spirits recognizing who's behind
[1:01:52] you
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:56] see the parallel is is so is
[1:01:59] so clear behind notice think of this
[1:02:02] right now psalm 27
[1:02:04] go host shouldn't come around about me
[1:02:08] yet i will not fear it's the same
[1:02:11] parallel
[1:02:12] god providing for you and i in this hour
[1:02:16] when there's all sorts of things death
[1:02:19] hunger pestilence come on now
[1:02:21] all of this is around but there's a
[1:02:24] place of
[1:02:24] safety in jesus christ
[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:30] i could be in my mom and dad's house and
[1:02:32] i'm not going to be safe from that
[1:02:33] you've got to get in the father's house
[1:02:36] you've got to get under the blood you
[1:02:38] must be
[1:02:39] born again
[1:02:41] [Applause]
[1:02:44] but as they come against the city to
[1:02:46] destroy it
[1:02:47] there will appear in the heavens the
[1:02:49] sign of the coming of the son of man
[1:02:52] with his mighty armies to destroy them
[1:02:54] who have been destroying the earth
[1:02:57] so with the enemy repulsed
[1:03:01] jesus then comes and presents himself to
[1:03:04] the 144
[1:03:05] 000. look at this statement having seen
[1:03:09] his mighty acts of salvation
[1:03:12] they have come to know his power have
[1:03:15] you come to know his power
[1:03:18] then you're a candidate for the rapture
[1:03:21] you come to know his power you've seen
[1:03:24] his mighty acts of salvation in your
[1:03:27] life
[1:03:29] but also seeing his wounds and knowing
[1:03:31] that they had rejected him
[1:03:33] even to that moment causes them to cry
[1:03:35] out in the agony of terror and fear
[1:03:37] even as dear even as did their brethren
[1:03:39] of old when they stood before joseph
[1:03:41] being sore afraid
[1:03:42] that they should be killed but as joseph
[1:03:44] said don't be angry with yourselves it's
[1:03:47] all right
[1:03:47] god was in it all he did it to preserve
[1:03:51] life that sealed to them now
[1:03:55] that is open to you and i
[1:03:58] listen theologians men of history they
[1:04:01] understood these things
[1:04:03] are you with me the message of the hour
[1:04:06] did not just
[1:04:06] uncover this to where all of a sudden
[1:04:08] we're looking in the scriptures
[1:04:09] but the message of the hour is it is the
[1:04:12] holy spirit
[1:04:13] on earth to interpret that word and say
[1:04:16] this which was spoken for this hour for
[1:04:19] this time
[1:04:19] it is coming to pass and i am bringing
[1:04:22] it to past
[1:04:24] it makes us aware of the time the day
[1:04:27] the season we're living in
[1:04:28] that we might recognize our day and our
[1:04:31] message
[1:04:35] oh glory be to god even so will jesus
[1:04:38] speak peace and love to them
[1:04:41] now zechariah 12 8 where we were reading
[1:04:45] from
[1:04:46] in that day shall the lord defend
[1:04:51] the inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:04:54] and he that is feeble
[1:04:58] among them at that day shall be
[1:05:01] as david and the house of david shall be
[1:05:04] as god
[1:05:05] as the angel of the lord before them i
[1:05:07] want to draw your attention to this
[1:05:09] portion in the scripture
[1:05:11] he that is feeble shall be
[1:05:15] as david
[1:05:19] remember david was not
[1:05:22] seemingly the first choice
[1:05:26] even the flesh and the eyes of the
[1:05:29] prophet
[1:05:29] it went it went to even
[1:05:33] eli i think it was the the oldest son of
[1:05:35] jesse
[1:05:36] but god said see it wasn't that
[1:05:40] oh why did samuel go that way hey your
[1:05:42] eyes and my eyes and our thinking
[1:05:44] sometimes
[1:05:45] goes in the wrong direction but what's
[1:05:47] important is do you have the holy ghost
[1:05:49] and are you sensitive
[1:05:50] when he says uh-uh you keep going until
[1:05:52] he says uh-huh
[1:05:54] that's what's important the sons of god
[1:05:56] are led by the spirit of god
[1:05:59] it isn't sometimes that we don't get
[1:06:00] things wrong but we are led by the
[1:06:02] spirit of god
[1:06:04] we obey when he says we keep walking
[1:06:07] until he says uh-huh
[1:06:09] [Applause]
[1:06:12] oh glory be to god so
[1:06:15] remember israel they received their own
[1:06:19] king
[1:06:21] when they rejected not samuel
[1:06:25] the lord but they did reject samuel
[1:06:29] they rejected the lord because samuel
[1:06:32] had the word of the lord
[1:06:34] god gave them a king of their own
[1:06:38] choosing
[1:06:41] you see look god even here was saul
[1:06:44] and god here was a man that would fit
[1:06:47] what they were wanting and god gave them
[1:06:50] what they were wanting
[1:06:52] the carnal mind will always seek after
[1:06:54] carnal things
[1:06:56] that's why the carnal mind is enmity
[1:06:58] against god
[1:07:01] but remember is remember what saul did
[1:07:05] saul was self-willed saul
[1:07:08] when the pressure got great saul wanted
[1:07:11] to move over
[1:07:12] and take other positions he wanted to
[1:07:16] try to do and try to bring peace and try
[1:07:18] to bring
[1:07:18] all of that but saul wouldn't wait on
[1:07:20] god and remember
[1:07:22] that god rent the kingdom from saul
[1:07:26] he was still holding the title king
[1:07:29] but his power had already been removed
[1:07:32] from him
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:38] but the bible says when he go and saw
[1:07:40] samuel went to anoint
[1:07:42] david it said the strength of israel
[1:07:46] it was not david that was the strength
[1:07:48] of israel
[1:07:49] it is god who is the strength of israel
[1:07:54] it is not i or you who is strong it is
[1:07:57] god who is the strength of our lives
[1:08:05] this is why in psalms 27
[1:08:09] the lord is my light my salvation
[1:08:12] whom shall i fear the lord
[1:08:16] is the strength of my life whom shall
[1:08:19] i be afraid
[1:08:22] even when david in psalm in second
[1:08:25] samuel 21
[1:08:26] 17 abishai the son of zaria
[1:08:29] secured him and smote the philistine and
[1:08:31] killed him then the men of david
[1:08:33] swearing to him saying
[1:08:34] thou shalt go no more out with us to
[1:08:36] battle that thou quench not the light of
[1:08:38] israel
[1:08:40] what was it god's light david was
[1:08:44] yielded
[1:08:44] god was manifesting himself
[1:08:48] as light to israel
[1:08:51] what does light do it gives leadership
[1:08:54] it shows paths oh my
[1:08:58] then the paths to victory was the
[1:09:00] strength of israel in their midst
[1:09:05] david relied
[1:09:08] upon what god had made him when david
[1:09:12] faced
[1:09:13] i know these are very very familiar
[1:09:15] places for us in the scripture
[1:09:17] but how fitting it is even for this hour
[1:09:22] when david faced each of his foes
[1:09:24] remember
[1:09:25] when it came to goliath who was
[1:09:28] uh the pinnacle or that of where he had
[1:09:31] had the bear and the land now here stood
[1:09:34] goliath that giant was there
[1:09:37] in the pathway but david said the same
[1:09:41] god
[1:09:44] he was not looking at lion bear giant
[1:09:48] no he said the same god amen
[1:09:53] oh brother and sister the enemy can come
[1:09:56] in many different forms but remember
[1:09:58] the same god
[1:10:02] sure the pressures the things that you
[1:10:05] and i
[1:10:05] go through now are greater than what it
[1:10:08] was
[1:10:08] when god first got a hold of our life
[1:10:11] but god has become greater
[1:10:13] those testimonies those experiences have
[1:10:16] prepared us
[1:10:17] for this moment
[1:10:23] that's why just sitting around in a
[1:10:24] messy church does not prepare you
[1:10:27] for this moment it doesn't prepare us
[1:10:31] for where we're at it's setting it's
[1:10:33] being seated
[1:10:34] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:10:37] it prepares us for this moment
[1:10:44] notice the bible in isaiah 40
[1:10:47] 29 he giveth power
[1:10:51] to the faint and to them that have
[1:10:54] no might he increaseth strength who does
[1:10:58] this
[1:10:58] he does it look even the youths
[1:11:03] shall faint and be weary and the young
[1:11:07] man shall utterly fall
[1:11:09] remember young men are strong
[1:11:12] in the book of ecclesiastes lamentations
[1:11:15] and over in first charm
[1:11:17] young men you are strong there is a
[1:11:19] natural
[1:11:20] strength in your youth a stamina that
[1:11:23] you have
[1:11:24] but the scripture is letting it be known
[1:11:26] that even
[1:11:27] youthful stamina even strength i'm not
[1:11:31] gonna do this and i'm gonna abstain from
[1:11:33] this and i'm not gonna do that
[1:11:35] that in itself will fail you
[1:11:38] need a greater strength and you can't
[1:11:42] give yourself that strength
[1:11:44] that strength comes from the lord
[1:11:47] that's why jesus said you must be endued
[1:11:51] with power from on high
[1:11:54] you can't face the spirits and the
[1:11:57] devils
[1:11:58] that are around about this day you can't
[1:12:01] live a victorious life you can't walk
[1:12:03] pleasing to god
[1:12:04] without the power of the holy ghost in
[1:12:06] your life
[1:12:10] this ain't about being good message
[1:12:12] young people and good man i thank god
[1:12:14] for
[1:12:14] things where morality and things were
[1:12:16] there would keep themselves but i'm
[1:12:17] telling you right now
[1:12:19] it takes more than good clean morality
[1:12:21] it takes more than just acknowledging
[1:12:23] that the word is true
[1:12:24] you must be filled with the power
[1:12:28] of almighty god that gives strength to
[1:12:31] your life
[1:12:34] stop trying to figure it out and just
[1:12:35] give yourself to it
[1:12:38] god is not known by the intellect
[1:12:42] well when i figure it out it's not an
[1:12:43] honest set your mind to the word
[1:12:45] that's coming forth and say god i give
[1:12:47] myself to you
[1:12:52] but they that wait upon the lord
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:58] shall renew their strength
[1:13:02] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:13:05] you you have something to catch you away
[1:13:11] you give yourself to something that's
[1:13:12] able to pick you up
[1:13:14] from darkness and put you into the
[1:13:16] kingdom of light
[1:13:19] glory be to god hallelujah
[1:13:23] amen they shall run and not be weary
[1:13:25] they shall walk and not
[1:13:27] faint in daniel chapter 12 verse 1
[1:13:33] the scripture is speaking of the
[1:13:36] gathering there of israel
[1:13:39] other places in the scripture jacob's
[1:13:41] trouble
[1:13:42] and at that time shall michael stand up
[1:13:46] the great prince christ in angelic form
[1:13:50] which standeth for the children of thy
[1:13:53] people
[1:13:54] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:13:56] talking about the tribulation
[1:13:58] such as never was since there was a
[1:14:01] nation
[1:14:01] even to that same time so the
[1:14:04] heightenedness the pressure
[1:14:06] everything that comes to a gathering
[1:14:08] around
[1:14:09] jerusalem and at that time
[1:14:14] thy people shall be delivered every one
[1:14:17] that shall be
[1:14:18] found written in the book
[1:14:23] oh there is power and glory
[1:14:26] to see your name in the book
[1:14:30] that's how you fight this greatest ball
[1:14:31] ever fought
[1:14:36] hallelujah inspiration being poured out
[1:14:39] see for for israel
[1:14:42] and if some of these terms you know
[1:14:46] don't don't get lost in the terms but
[1:14:47] i'm going to mention these things
[1:14:49] here when the bride how the bride has
[1:14:53] been caught away in rapture
[1:14:55] you have the two witnesses of
[1:14:56] revelations 11
[1:14:58] they come and they have power to open
[1:15:01] that sixth seal
[1:15:03] they open up that sixth seal very
[1:15:05] interesting
[1:15:06] the heading listen the heading of the
[1:15:09] sixth seal
[1:15:10] in the scofield bible says anarchy
[1:15:13] incredible huh because you'll find
[1:15:18] the the insanity and the chaos that'll
[1:15:21] be going on
[1:15:22] on earth but yet among the 144 000
[1:15:26] they'll be getting their right mind
[1:15:29] while the pressure is going on and
[1:15:32] remember
[1:15:33] it does not make men soft in that hour
[1:15:35] the bible says they become angry
[1:15:39] they are angered at what's going on
[1:15:42] because remember when the bride goes up
[1:15:46] the devil comes down whoa
[1:15:49] unto the inhabitants of the earth then
[1:15:52] is not just a demon holding the place
[1:15:54] for it
[1:15:55] in the man of sin but the devil himself
[1:15:57] comes down and then it becomes the beast
[1:16:00] whoa unto the inhabitants of the earth
[1:16:04] then
[1:16:06] my i'm glad that there's already a place
[1:16:08] of safety
[1:16:09] right now i i'm glad we found
[1:16:12] we found that place of safety in the ark
[1:16:15] that god has provided
[1:16:16] in this hour aren't you thankful
[1:16:20] oh my you see that inspiration that will
[1:16:23] be poured out
[1:16:24] that anointing of the word remember as
[1:16:27] we read here
[1:16:28] in a in that part of our text where god
[1:16:31] himself will pour upon the house of
[1:16:34] david the spirit of grace
[1:16:38] and supplication the spirit of grace
[1:16:42] through the preaching of those two
[1:16:44] witnesses
[1:16:45] what will they be preaching the same
[1:16:47] message that i'm preaching now
[1:16:50] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:54] they will be calling them to that
[1:16:56] fountain
[1:16:57] that is opened in the house of david
[1:17:03] think about this brother branham was
[1:17:06] getting ready to go to israel
[1:17:09] is that right
[1:17:12] but the spirit of the lord stopped him
[1:17:14] and says don't go
[1:17:16] because why if the jews had saw that
[1:17:18] sign
[1:17:19] of the messiah
[1:17:23] it would have turned them right there
[1:17:25] but god's got a timing and everything
[1:17:27] has to be in order
[1:17:29] sometimes our look at it's not our
[1:17:31] thoughts his thoughts are higher than
[1:17:33] ours
[1:17:33] his ways are higher than ours
[1:17:37] god's getting everything in position
[1:17:39] with your loved ones come on now
[1:17:41] he's getting everything in position god
[1:17:44] is at work
[1:17:48] he's getting everything in position in
[1:17:51] his pride
[1:17:52] he's getting israel in position the
[1:17:54] nations are coming together
[1:17:58] even those that don't even agree
[1:18:02] the darkness is joining them together
[1:18:11] you think
[1:18:12] you thought you'd never see certain
[1:18:14] things in churches
[1:18:15] you thought you'd never see certain
[1:18:17] things where they would condone
[1:18:19] and or and and go what is it it's
[1:18:21] darkness
[1:18:23] darkness that is pushing in
[1:18:26] causing them to unite together but
[1:18:30] shalom
[1:18:33] shalom to the bride of jesus christ
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:38] hallelujah you see
[1:18:43] what god is doing remember
[1:18:47] what god is doing in the heaven there is
[1:18:49] there is a word
[1:18:50] as we read here in daniel 12 there is a
[1:18:53] word
[1:18:54] that god is revealing through that word
[1:18:58] israel's names will be called
[1:19:02] those that are found written in the book
[1:19:04] their names will be called what god
[1:19:06] is doing in the heavens is reflected on
[1:19:09] the earth
[1:19:11] if the hand moves this way it's
[1:19:12] reflected on earth
[1:19:14] because the shadow is the reflection of
[1:19:16] that hand moving
[1:19:21] this is why i think this should be a
[1:19:24] very
[1:19:26] uh uh
[1:19:29] point here when michael
[1:19:33] the great prince here is christ standing
[1:19:36] let me just say this to you there had to
[1:19:39] be a word
[1:19:40] that would stand for who we were
[1:19:43] that would call us from where we were to
[1:19:45] where we need to be
[1:19:48] there was a voice there was a life that
[1:19:50] god called
[1:19:51] him was it was directed in the scripture
[1:19:54] that then
[1:19:54] god himself could make known in his work
[1:19:57] you and i would have never had the
[1:19:58] confidence we would not even have the
[1:20:00] faith but god himself
[1:20:02] standing in his word he has stood for us
[1:20:05] and he made known to you and i
[1:20:06] before the foundation of the world you
[1:20:08] were in my mind
[1:20:11] he stood for us and now that he has
[1:20:15] stood for us
[1:20:16] we are standing for him
[1:20:19] in him
[1:20:23] standing fast in the liberty
[1:20:27] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:20:31] quit you like men stand
[1:20:35] the time to stand this is an
[1:20:39] hour that says if you stand on what you
[1:20:40] believe will cancel you
[1:20:45] that is the spirit of the beast
[1:20:48] if you don't go along with our ways you
[1:20:50] don't go along with us thinking you
[1:20:52] don't go along we're not going along
[1:20:54] with the world's thinking
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:57] we've received the mind of christ
[1:21:03] oh brother the old life has been
[1:21:06] cancelled
[1:21:08] and the new life the new life
[1:21:11] has arose
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:17] we're not under the march in the
[1:21:19] leadership of this sorcery
[1:21:22] come on friends we're not bewitched we
[1:21:25] know
[1:21:25] in whom we have believed and we are
[1:21:28] persuaded
[1:21:28] that he is able to keep that which i've
[1:21:31] committed against that day
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] it's a spirits that's at work spirits to
[1:21:37] do what besieged
[1:21:38] and wanting to close up church doors
[1:21:42] spirits congealing that's one to shut
[1:21:45] you up
[1:21:47] if you don't stand for us we'll remove
[1:21:49] you from your job that's a spirit
[1:21:51] of death that if you're near you if you
[1:21:53] don't stand with it then you cannot buy
[1:21:54] or sell.
[1:21:57] you understand your spirits at work the
[1:22:00] spirits have been released
[1:22:02] from the river euphrates i'm speaking to
[1:22:05] you this morning
[1:22:06] under the spirit of almighty god it's
[1:22:09] imperative
[1:22:10] it's important in your life that you be
[1:22:13] filled with the holy ghost
[1:22:14] it's important in your life that you
[1:22:16] have spiritual discernment
[1:22:28] jacob jacob was called back
[1:22:32] to the homeland how did he how did he
[1:22:34] get back to the homeland
[1:22:36] god calls the countenance of his
[1:22:37] father-in-law to turn against him
[1:22:41] is that right his countenance turned
[1:22:43] against him and jacob said
[1:22:45] to his to that of his wife it's time to
[1:22:48] get back
[1:22:49] but you see there was a promise that
[1:22:50] jacob had to get back to
[1:22:53] lord if you bless me in the land whether
[1:22:54] i go i will come back and give you the
[1:22:56] tithe
[1:23:01] god wants the tithe of our life our soul
[1:23:05] that belongs to him you give him the
[1:23:08] tithe
[1:23:09] oh he says and i will run your cup over
[1:23:13] sorry ain't talking about mansions and
[1:23:15] mercedes benz he's talking about real
[1:23:17] life
[1:23:18] and real peace and real joy
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:25] jacob wrestled with the angel where
[1:23:29] he had to get back to bethel first he
[1:23:31] didn't wrestle with the angel
[1:23:32] where he was at in the other countries
[1:23:35] come on he had to get back to the
[1:23:36] appointed place
[1:23:38] and god was bringing jacob back that's
[1:23:41] why the tender hand of jehovah
[1:23:42] has brought back the jews to this place
[1:23:45] this is why sometimes
[1:23:47] we can look and you can say oh my loved
[1:23:49] ones oh i don't want to see this and i
[1:23:50] don't want to see that but perhaps it's
[1:23:52] the tender hand of jehovah
[1:23:53] for god knows how our makeup is and how
[1:23:55] each and every one of us
[1:23:56] and god says i know what i have to bring
[1:23:58] them to until they themselves
[1:24:00] will surrender their own will what is it
[1:24:04] the tender hand of jehovah
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:10] hallelujah i say how great is our god
[1:24:17] jacob had to come face something that he
[1:24:20] had ran from
[1:24:23] he couldn't go back there he was running
[1:24:25] from it but god in order to prepare him
[1:24:28] to face esau he had to first meet god
[1:24:33] before israel can stand against the
[1:24:35] besiegement of all the armies they first
[1:24:37] have to meet
[1:24:38] god face to face in the power of his
[1:24:41] spirit
[1:24:42] amen are you with me before you and i
[1:24:45] can stand against the wiles of the devil
[1:24:47] we must meet god face to face when you
[1:24:50] meet god face to face
[1:24:52] then you're able to stand there when
[1:24:54] friends face
[1:24:56] esau and you're not fearful you're not
[1:24:58] scared
[1:24:59] but you receive the courage that has
[1:25:01] called out
[1:25:02] the very israel that's on the inside of
[1:25:05] you
[1:25:07] that's what god spoke of in his word
[1:25:09] that's who he made the covenant with
[1:25:12] not this this
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:23] no wonder in the prophecy the call
[1:25:28] will be that it's a calling
[1:25:32] going in the word going through israel
[1:25:35] like it is in isaiah 51
[1:25:38] awake awake oh
[1:25:41] arm of the lord in thy strength
[1:25:45] has window parted the red sea
[1:25:49] the same power
[1:25:53] you see israel
[1:25:57] how did they get to this place they left
[1:26:01] him
[1:26:04] at the pentecostal feast
[1:26:07] god had the feast of the lord leviticus
[1:26:09] 23
[1:26:10] the feast of the lord those feasts were
[1:26:13] to be completed
[1:26:14] in one year which speaks of the
[1:26:17] unfolding
[1:26:18] of redemption through the work of one
[1:26:21] sacrificial offering
[1:26:23] the lord jesus christ he is
[1:26:26] our passover he is our unleavened bread
[1:26:30] he is our pentecost
[1:26:34] he is our atonement he is
[1:26:37] our feast of tabernacles
[1:26:41] all of those speaks of the messiah
[1:26:44] himself but they left him at the
[1:26:47] pentecostal feast
[1:26:50] so how do you get what is pentecost
[1:26:53] what is pentecost it's jubilee what's
[1:26:56] jubilee
[1:26:56] it's to return back to your rightful
[1:27:00] inheritance
[1:27:03] if land has been sold and taken from you
[1:27:07] you'll go as a slave but the land
[1:27:08] belongs to you
[1:27:10] that's why you've got to write when the
[1:27:12] holy ghost he makes you aware of your
[1:27:15] rights
[1:27:15] don't you let the devil try to put it
[1:27:17] down like well you'll never do this
[1:27:19] you'll never do all you've got to do is
[1:27:21] let go
[1:27:21] and say i come lord take me to the holy
[1:27:24] ghost
[1:27:25] take me to my healing take me to my
[1:27:27] deliverance cause you've heard
[1:27:29] the call of what belongs to you
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:35] this land belongs to me
[1:27:39] hallelujah but in order to get to that
[1:27:44] of the pentecostal feast they've got to
[1:27:47] come to the passover
[1:27:50] the passover the offering on the cross
[1:27:53] but you see what has what has already
[1:27:56] been
[1:27:57] and god has been pouring out his spirit
[1:28:00] among the gentiles
[1:28:02] then comes the feast of atonement to
[1:28:04] where
[1:28:05] in the atonement it's not the killing of
[1:28:07] the lamb
[1:28:08] that is emphasized it points back to
[1:28:11] what was done
[1:28:12] as the passover lamb and that's what the
[1:28:15] ministry of moses and elijah does
[1:28:17] it points back to what was already done
[1:28:22] brother and sister that's why the
[1:28:24] message that god has sent in this hour
[1:28:26] what does it do it points us back to
[1:28:29] what god
[1:28:30] has done it doesn't point us back
[1:28:33] to a church doctrine that leaves people
[1:28:36] in sin
[1:28:37] and bound and hoping but it brings a
[1:28:40] real
[1:28:40] faith this is what the revealing of the
[1:28:45] true atonement
[1:28:46] does to the believer
[1:28:53] then you come to recognize
[1:28:56] he was bruised from my iniquity the
[1:28:58] chastisement of
[1:29:00] my peace was upon him and by his stripes
[1:29:03] i am healed
[1:29:05] everyone says one thing what does it do
[1:29:07] it leads you here
[1:29:08] the word as the word is becoming open
[1:29:12] and you're seeing it takes you in to the
[1:29:14] feast of pentecost
[1:29:16] takes them into a place where they unite
[1:29:18] with his life takes them back
[1:29:20] israel comes back into a place of the
[1:29:22] prophecy where clark said
[1:29:24] i will bring her back home this word
[1:29:27] reunites you and i to our homeland
[1:29:31] our homeland of the holy ghost
[1:29:34] that's why listen to me now don't
[1:29:36] despise where you say well i started in
[1:29:39] this church i started in a lutheran
[1:29:40] church or i started don't despise that
[1:29:42] you had to start somewhere but the thing
[1:29:45] of it is is that that couldn't satisfy
[1:29:47] because you want to know why that was
[1:29:49] not your home
[1:29:51] and they're talking about a building i'm
[1:29:53] talking about the world
[1:29:56] you received a call and you can't even
[1:29:58] figure out why these are good people
[1:29:59] here this is good this is fine my they
[1:30:01] have everything around they're good
[1:30:02] people
[1:30:03] but yet there was a call there was
[1:30:05] something more
[1:30:06] that you were longing for and you
[1:30:08] couldn't even explain it
[1:30:09] what was that it was god drawing you
[1:30:12] to himself
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] i'm telling you it's a paradox of god's
[1:30:18] power
[1:30:19] [Applause]
[1:30:22] hallelujah
[1:30:30] zechariah 10 verse 1.
[1:30:34] ask you of the lord rain in the time of
[1:30:38] the latter rain
[1:30:41] so the lord shall make bright clouds and
[1:30:43] give showers of rain to everyone
[1:30:46] grass life
[1:30:50] in the field for the idols look at this
[1:30:52] in verse two
[1:30:54] for the idols have spoken vanity
[1:30:58] and the diviners have seen a lie and
[1:31:01] have told false dreams
[1:31:04] that's why the spirits that even arise
[1:31:06] right in this hour false prophets
[1:31:08] peace peace this is gonna turn around
[1:31:11] this is gonna turn around
[1:31:14] that's the bible when they begin to say
[1:31:16] peace
[1:31:17] and safety then cometh sudden
[1:31:21] destruction there's only one voice
[1:31:24] that can really speak safety and peace
[1:31:28] and that is the voice of god
[1:31:31] the blood speaks and says i am your
[1:31:34] safety
[1:31:35] i am your peace lord that a heavy laden
[1:31:39] come unto me and i will give you
[1:31:41] sadly oath for your souls
[1:31:45] look at this they comfort in vain
[1:31:47] therefore they went their way as a flock
[1:31:50] they were troubled because there was no
[1:31:52] shepherd
[1:31:53] you see what the revealed word by the
[1:31:55] spirit does it brings you under
[1:31:57] leadership
[1:31:59] we are without a shepherd but he gives
[1:32:01] us himself
[1:32:03] the spirit of truth to lead and guide us
[1:32:06] we're not walking by the fables and
[1:32:07] cunning eyes
[1:32:08] of man's uh um ideas this is not vain
[1:32:11] this is not vain comfort
[1:32:14] that pats you on the back and never
[1:32:16] deals with your heart
[1:32:18] you can be a good moral person and your
[1:32:21] soul
[1:32:22] filled with envy strife filled with sin
[1:32:27] brother let me tell you something this
[1:32:29] is why with many people
[1:32:30] you know you talk to them sometime and
[1:32:32] they'll say well brother samuel i bought
[1:32:34] a bible i started reading or i prayed
[1:32:36] with so and so
[1:32:37] stop the religious acts and say god
[1:32:41] i want to give you my heart
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:45] the religious acts only appease for a
[1:32:48] certain time
[1:32:49] god wants your heart
[1:32:53] you can't worship him any other way it
[1:32:56] must be in spirit
[1:32:57] and in truth that's why you struggle
[1:33:01] with your dress you go for so long and
[1:33:03] then you're back to putting pants on
[1:33:04] you're back to cutting your hair you're
[1:33:06] batman you're back to looking at things
[1:33:08] that you'll not be looking at
[1:33:09] all these other things like you know it
[1:33:11] is you need to get your heart clean
[1:33:17] you say what is this in order to stand
[1:33:19] the beseechment
[1:33:21] you've got to come to the fountain
[1:33:25] the fountain that's open to take care of
[1:33:28] your sin the fountain that's open the
[1:33:31] spirit of grace
[1:33:32] poured out that then causes you
[1:33:35] supplications
[1:33:36] to ask for what the spirit is telling
[1:33:38] you to ask for
[1:33:44] it's a serious hour it's a serious hour
[1:33:50] i'm not here to scare you but this might
[1:33:52] be your last time
[1:33:54] but this is a serious hour but it's an
[1:33:56] hour to have great delight and joy
[1:33:58] as a believer
[1:34:02] mine anger verse 3 was kindled against
[1:34:05] the shepherds
[1:34:06] and i punished the goats what do the
[1:34:08] goats do
[1:34:09] they prepare for the slaughter goats
[1:34:12] lead the people to the slaughter
[1:34:14] just like men leading their
[1:34:15] congregations into the tribulation
[1:34:20] come on and leading them to to the
[1:34:22] slaughter even to places of oh god don't
[1:34:25] care as long as you love the lord
[1:34:26] as long as you love god god don't care
[1:34:29] if god's love is that
[1:34:30] weak but i know better
[1:34:34] because where his love found me it took
[1:34:36] the love of the world out of man
[1:34:40] the desires and the appetite of that
[1:34:42] beast nature
[1:34:43] it could never extinguish but the love
[1:34:46] of god
[1:34:48] came and overthrew satan's kingdom here
[1:34:54] aren't you glad we're serving the living
[1:34:56] god
[1:34:58] and if you're not i pray that it will
[1:35:00] draw you to such a place to say
[1:35:02] i want to walk in that victory
[1:35:07] i hope it's not making you angry like it
[1:35:09] will be
[1:35:11] when the 144 000 are getting their
[1:35:13] visitation and the
[1:35:14] the people of the earth they're being
[1:35:16] angered
[1:35:18] they're being further made angry
[1:35:23] for the lord of hosts have visited his
[1:35:24] flock the house of judah
[1:35:26] judah and hath made them as his goodly
[1:35:29] horse
[1:35:30] in the battle see there's got to be a
[1:35:32] purging
[1:35:35] a purging the fountain opened in the
[1:35:37] house of david
[1:35:39] a cleansing it means
[1:35:46] you look at the jews they've been going
[1:35:48] back they've been going back into their
[1:35:54] land
[1:35:56] they um
[1:36:00] where they send them a ticket they want
[1:36:02] to come back
[1:36:04] you get a ticket all your family and you
[1:36:06] can move there
[1:36:07] but the way that that's paid for is
[1:36:10] because you already had
[1:36:12] ancestors you're tied into genealogy
[1:36:16] and you can go there on what they call
[1:36:18] uh
[1:36:19] aliyah you it's what it is it's a
[1:36:22] one-way voyage
[1:36:24] aren't you glad when the holy ghost got
[1:36:25] a hold of you it's not a two-way it's a
[1:36:27] one-way
[1:36:29] pop-up not going back no more no more
[1:36:33] i'm going on
[1:36:36] i been caught on the wings of an eagle
[1:36:41] but as they come in there no i don't
[1:36:44] know i
[1:36:44] these things i love as we study when
[1:36:48] looking at this
[1:36:49] you see them coming in there they're all
[1:36:51] painted up
[1:36:53] shorts on the women wearing pants and
[1:36:56] they do
[1:36:57] all these things that you look at but
[1:37:00] listen let me just say this let me be
[1:37:02] very clear
[1:37:03] it's more than just even the clothing on
[1:37:05] the outside
[1:37:06] it's their heart that needs to be turned
[1:37:09] you can have all the right attire on
[1:37:12] according to the word
[1:37:14] but if you don't get the wedding garment
[1:37:16] on your soul
[1:37:18] you missed it
[1:37:21] you have got to get the clothing of that
[1:37:24] garment of humility on your soul
[1:37:27] and then you're willing to have whatever
[1:37:29] the word has said god i want to please
[1:37:30] you
[1:37:31] but you see why there has to be a
[1:37:33] cleansing god cannot come and make
[1:37:35] himself known to israel they can say
[1:37:37] well my grandfather no they got to prove
[1:37:39] that they even have to learn they learn
[1:37:41] the language when they come in
[1:37:43] they're provided housing provided money
[1:37:45] they can go stay there
[1:37:47] and they begin to learn the hebrew
[1:37:48] language if they need to know it
[1:37:50] and all those things but you recognize
[1:37:52] there will be many of them
[1:37:55] that know all of that but miss
[1:37:58] their day of visitation
[1:38:01] but yet some of them have to be there
[1:38:04] because who knows it might be their
[1:38:06] children their son their daughter
[1:38:08] that's part of the elect 144 000.
[1:38:12] sometimes you can't understand why
[1:38:14] so-and-so witnessed to me
[1:38:15] they're no longer around but god only
[1:38:17] allowed that to be a carrier to get to
[1:38:19] you
[1:38:21] preach brother samuel why because the
[1:38:24] word will find its mark
[1:38:26] that's why brother random told us in
[1:38:27] power transformation he said you might
[1:38:29] look and say
[1:38:30] my this preacher i sat under they went
[1:38:32] off he said it wasn't a preacher
[1:38:34] that transformed you it's the word that
[1:38:37] transforms you
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:40] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[1:38:43] highest
[1:38:45] there's got to be a purging in order for
[1:38:48] him to come
[1:38:49] and reveal himself
[1:38:58] zechariah 10 4
[1:39:01] out of him came forth the corner
[1:39:06] out of him comes forth the cornerstone
[1:39:11] the foundation stone out of him
[1:39:15] comes forth the corner
[1:39:18] out of him the nail out of him the
[1:39:20] battle bow out of him every oppressor
[1:39:22] together
[1:39:24] listen to this the message the contest
[1:39:27] this great contest has been going on for
[1:39:30] many years
[1:39:31] it started in heaven and satan was
[1:39:33] kicked out into the earth
[1:39:35] and then he became an enemy to god's
[1:39:38] people
[1:39:39] and since then he's used all his
[1:39:42] strength and his strategy
[1:39:43] to try to pull god's people across the
[1:39:45] fires or into his fires
[1:39:48] and we know that who has the most power
[1:39:52] god does and god when he gave his people
[1:39:55] the best thing
[1:39:56] that he could to combat satan with was
[1:39:59] his word
[1:40:01] now because the word is god and who's
[1:40:03] stronger than god
[1:40:05] so the word is god and the word becomes
[1:40:08] our strength
[1:40:09] god in the church becomes its strength
[1:40:13] to pull satan to his own fires that he
[1:40:16] has made
[1:40:19] the word in the church gathers satan
[1:40:22] pulls him to his own fires
[1:40:30] it makes you look at testing trials a
[1:40:33] little different
[1:40:36] to recognize it's god is ordering all of
[1:40:40] these parts
[1:40:42] and through the tester trial god is
[1:40:44] molding and making
[1:40:45] and shaping our lives
[1:40:48] and the word is having preeminence
[1:40:53] we're in a place and sometimes the lord
[1:40:55] i don't lord i i don't know i don't
[1:40:57] i don't know what to do lord i lord god
[1:40:59] i'm just lord
[1:41:01] how are you so helpless
[1:41:04] and he that is feeble shall be as david
[1:41:09] he that is weak out of weakness made
[1:41:12] strong
[1:41:15] as paul said when i am weak then
[1:41:18] am i strong
[1:41:26] are you okay
[1:41:30] and they shall be as a mighty men
[1:41:34] verse 5 which tread down their enemies
[1:41:37] notice as they shall be as mighty men
[1:41:40] what makes a mighty man
[1:41:42] you and god you and god are in the
[1:41:45] majority
[1:41:46] oh think of israel all the nations
[1:41:50] around about even now
[1:41:53] even now israel as a nation
[1:41:56] they are surrounded
[1:42:00] people constantly they are they are
[1:42:03] always the source
[1:42:04] of diplomacy
[1:42:08] and men want them to make peace packs
[1:42:11] we'll give them this much land give him
[1:42:13] this much land when have you ever made
[1:42:15] peace with the devil
[1:42:16] and he let you alone
[1:42:19] you give him this much of your life he
[1:42:21] wants more
[1:42:23] come on now you give him sunday and say
[1:42:25] well you know i just i do this on sunday
[1:42:28] he wants thursday then he wants this day
[1:42:31] then he wants that day then he wants
[1:42:32] this way satan wants the land
[1:42:37] you can't make peace packs with the
[1:42:40] devil
[1:42:44] but god says i want it all
[1:42:48] but when god as god takes it all that's
[1:42:51] real peace
[1:42:54] then he gives us real might and real
[1:42:56] strength notice what he does
[1:42:58] they shall be as mighty men which tread
[1:43:00] down their enemies in the mire of the
[1:43:02] streets in the battle
[1:43:03] and they shall fight because the lord is
[1:43:06] with them
[1:43:06] and the riders on horses shall be
[1:43:09] confounded
[1:43:10] and i will strengthen the house of judah
[1:43:13] and i will
[1:43:14] save the house of joseph and i will
[1:43:16] bring them again to place them
[1:43:18] for i have mercy upon them and they
[1:43:21] shall
[1:43:21] be as though i had not cast them out
[1:43:24] for i am the lord their god and will
[1:43:27] hear them
[1:43:31] i said that's a paradox right there
[1:43:35] that's a paradox to where you're no
[1:43:36] longer living tied to your past
[1:43:41] to where you're no longer allowing the
[1:43:42] enemy to bring your past over your head
[1:43:44] yeah but you did this and you did that
[1:43:46] there had to come a loosening
[1:43:48] that you recognized that was not that's
[1:43:50] not who i am
[1:43:52] who i am is who he has revealed
[1:43:55] and made me to be by his quickening
[1:43:58] power
[1:44:01] that causes you to rise in the power of
[1:44:03] his might
[1:44:05] as a mighty man and the devil says you
[1:44:09] are you already fellow you're a you're a
[1:44:11] small little guy
[1:44:12] oh it's not the size of the
[1:44:16] dog in the fight it's the size
[1:44:19] of the fight in the dog
[1:44:22] glory be to god in the highest don't you
[1:44:26] love him
[1:44:27] and they of ephraim shall be like a
[1:44:29] mighty man and their heart shall rejoice
[1:44:31] as through wine yea their children shall
[1:44:34] see it
[1:44:35] and be glad and their heart shall
[1:44:37] rejoice in
[1:44:38] the lord
[1:44:43] i'm just going to stop there
[1:44:47] i don't want to i don't want to lose
[1:44:48] this it's very hard
[1:44:51] but i won't let me just let me just tie
[1:44:54] this part up here
[1:44:58] verse seven let me read that again and
[1:45:00] day of ephraim shall be like a mighty
[1:45:02] man
[1:45:04] and their heart shall rejoice
[1:45:07] as through wine what does wine do
[1:45:15] wine stimulate
[1:45:18] oh you get people that are on the job
[1:45:22] around about you and
[1:45:25] they're drinking water at the cooler
[1:45:28] but they're talking about what they're
[1:45:30] going to drink that night
[1:45:32] i can't wait you know why because that
[1:45:35] drink has a way of dulling their senses
[1:45:40] and you know what they start acting in
[1:45:43] ways
[1:45:44] that they normally wouldn't act
[1:45:47] somebody who's real quiet like a mouth
[1:45:49] they become real
[1:45:51] vocal it starts affecting the way that
[1:45:56] they walk
[1:45:57] you know everybody they love everybody
[1:46:02] what does that wine
[1:46:05] strong drink listen to me now their
[1:46:08] strong
[1:46:08] drink that's poured out even upon the
[1:46:11] world
[1:46:14] where that strong drink upon the world
[1:46:16] is causing them to unite
[1:46:20] and to sanction things they don't even
[1:46:22] themselves perhaps believe in
[1:46:26] what is it strong drink this is why the
[1:46:29] scripture said the
[1:46:30] the devil is like is like he's like a
[1:46:33] roaring lion
[1:46:35] seems like he got a voice yeah
[1:46:38] he's as a roaring lion but look real
[1:46:41] close
[1:46:41] he has no teeth
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:48] hallelujah seeking whom he may
[1:46:52] devour but the scripture says
[1:46:55] be sober be
[1:46:58] sober be sober do not be caught up with
[1:47:02] the
[1:47:03] drunkenness of the world do not let them
[1:47:06] pass around their drink to you and you
[1:47:08] now start drinking it and start
[1:47:10] posting on everything else in the world
[1:47:12] going on
[1:47:13] preach brother samuel i will don't take
[1:47:16] their drink
[1:47:18] you know what that drink does it incites
[1:47:20] the passions of
[1:47:22] man you read in the scripture in the
[1:47:25] book of proverbs
[1:47:26] the those who were of the the the
[1:47:29] harlots
[1:47:30] and the woman they gave a
[1:47:33] mixture of drink
[1:47:34] to the man before he came to them you
[1:47:37] know why
[1:47:38] because it was not so much the woman
[1:47:40] that they remember but it was the drink
[1:47:42] that was given them
[1:47:44] that would separate them from all the
[1:47:46] women this is why
[1:47:47] the devil has poured out his concoction
[1:47:50] his drink
[1:47:51] his religion it's a religion of you can
[1:47:54] do
[1:47:54] so much this or so much that and you can
[1:47:56] still be all right
[1:47:57] that's the devil's religion but when you
[1:47:59] get ahold of the wine of god brother
[1:48:02] it inoculates you this is not something
[1:48:05] you need to take tylenol for
[1:48:07] in the morning it inoculates you it
[1:48:10] changes your walk
[1:48:11] not just for the night but it changes
[1:48:14] your walk
[1:48:15] from there forth because you recognize
[1:48:22] why is that guy acting different
[1:48:25] you must make him sleep in a different
[1:48:26] house than the rest of them
[1:48:28] nope you must feed him a little better
[1:48:32] no what makes this guy
[1:48:35] different aha
[1:48:38] he knows his father is a king
[1:48:42] in another land and so if his father is
[1:48:45] a king
[1:48:46] that means he's the son of a king
[1:48:50] though a king in a distant land he
[1:48:53] reflects the kingdom
[1:48:55] that his genealogy is tied to
[1:48:59] he reflects the bloodline that he is
[1:49:02] offered
[1:49:02] he reflects that of the kingdom that he
[1:49:05] is born from
[1:49:11] this wine it causes you to rejoice
[1:49:18] while the rest of the world is you know
[1:49:20] if they got fingernails left they
[1:49:21] biting them off and maybe the toenails
[1:49:23] too and everything oh man what am i
[1:49:24] going to do
[1:49:25] oh my goodness oh my goodness are we
[1:49:27] going to go back oh my goodness are they
[1:49:28] going to send us back to school oh my
[1:49:29] goodness
[1:49:30] are they going to send it back to job oh
[1:49:31] my goodness oh my goodness oh my
[1:49:32] goodness
[1:49:36] woman of shima what do you say oh
[1:49:39] is well
[1:49:45] and her son is still laying dead
[1:49:49] but she got to her absolute
[1:49:52] the absolute of the word in that hour
[1:49:55] and she said
[1:49:56] all is well
[1:50:00] as the bride of jesus christ that has
[1:50:02] thus saith the lord
[1:50:04] the wine of god salvation
[1:50:08] the wine of the holy ghost we can say
[1:50:12] all is well
[1:50:17] the devil can say you don't know what
[1:50:18] you're facing you got this problem
[1:50:20] this sickness and this but we can say
[1:50:22] i've arrived
[1:50:24] i've arrived to everything that i have
[1:50:27] need of
[1:50:30] he is my old sufficiency he is my holy
[1:50:34] ghost
[1:50:34] he is my deliverer he is my healer
[1:50:38] he is my rapture
[1:50:41] he is my all in all
[1:50:46] and they that are feeble shall be as
[1:50:50] david

[1:51:26] potassium
[1:51:27] back in your life amen
[1:51:31] when you've been when the devil been
[1:51:32] trying to pour it on what does drinking
[1:51:34] this wine do
[1:51:35] it makes you forget who you think you
[1:51:38] are
[1:51:39] and makes you realize who you are
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:44] man i'm telling you what it's like that
[1:51:47] guy his faith
[1:51:48] is rising you know why check what he's
[1:51:50] been drinking
[1:51:52] because faith causes you to walk up to a
[1:51:53] complete stranger
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:56] hi how you doing the day's good isn't it
[1:52:03] what does that mean what you've been
[1:52:05] drinking
[1:52:08] make sure you're not drinking kool-aid
[1:52:12] make sure you're not drinking worldly
[1:52:14] kool-aid and got a stain on your mouth
[1:52:17] make sure you're drinking the wine of
[1:52:19] revelation
[1:52:20] in this hour
[1:52:24] are you with me because you drink what
[1:52:25] they have it makes you act like they
[1:52:27] have
[1:52:27] it stirs up vexation in your life what
[1:52:30] is motivating them
[1:52:32] but when you drink the wine of divine
[1:52:34] revelation brother it puts peace in your
[1:52:36] life
[1:52:37] it causes somebody would spit in your
[1:52:38] face and say i don't want nothing to do
[1:52:40] with you and this and that you can say
[1:52:42] you know what
[1:52:43] like brother jerry said don't feel it
[1:52:44] with you but i got for you
[1:52:47] but you'll pray for that man's soul
[1:52:48] won't you because why
[1:52:50] it's that love that's on the inside
[1:52:54] brother that's what the stimulation of
[1:52:56] the word is why
[1:52:57] because the meat shall inherit
[1:53:00] the earth that's the promise in the word
[1:53:04] the meek shall inherit the earth i'm
[1:53:07] telling you this morning
[1:53:08] in the name of jesus christ
[1:53:11] him if you haven't drank that wine this
[1:53:15] morning
[1:53:15] you say god inoculate my soul
[1:53:19] inoculate my life pack me away
[1:53:23] lord into your presence so
[1:53:26] was the enemy's advancement his
[1:53:28] encroachment
[1:53:29] wants to come they that are feeble
[1:53:33] shall be as david
[1:53:36] david maybe about this high i don't know
[1:53:39] how high how high he was
[1:53:41] but i know how big god was in him
[1:53:45] god was so big in him he had the
[1:53:47] preeminence in his life
[1:53:50] he that is feeble shall be as david
[1:53:56] this is the power of the revealed word
[1:54:00] by the spirit
[1:54:01] in our lives what do you say i say drink
[1:54:05] up
[1:54:07] i'm telling you drink up drink
[1:54:11] drink drink
[1:54:16] you love him hallelujah
[1:54:20] musicians come please
[1:54:26] oh blessed be the name of the lord it's
[1:54:29] a paradox of god's power
[1:54:33] the paradox is not something you can
[1:54:34] explain
[1:54:38] you can't explain it but what you know
[1:54:43] is when you pass from death unto life
[1:54:46] when you've been born again
[1:54:49] there's a change of nature on the inside
[1:54:52] this is what david listen to me this is
[1:54:54] what david said
[1:54:56] though a host should
[1:55:00] encamp round about me but in this will i
[1:55:03] be
[1:55:04] confident one thing have i
[1:55:09] desired that i may dwell
[1:55:13] in the house of the lord forever where
[1:55:15] was his victory
[1:55:16] in his desire
[1:55:21] look what your desire is look what your
[1:55:24] desire is within your life i'm talking
[1:55:25] about the desire
[1:55:26] that has rose up within your life if
[1:55:28] there's a desire in right now
[1:55:31] you say lord i want to climb into that
[1:55:33] place i want to move this god put that
[1:55:35] desire there
[1:55:36] let him take that desire i can't do it
[1:55:39] nobody else here can do it but he's the
[1:55:43] one who put it in you
[1:55:45] let him lift that desire
[1:55:48] to where it becomes a desire that's
[1:55:50] expressed
[1:55:52] through your life in a daily walk
[1:56:01] oh glory be to god isn't he wonderful
[1:56:06] just such a sweet sweet sweet spirit
[1:56:10] oh this fountain that's open
[1:56:13] oh what a what a glorious glorious day
[1:56:17] we're living in
[1:56:19] i say don't fear little flock it's the
[1:56:22] father's good will to give you the
[1:56:24] kingdom
[1:56:26] that doesn't mean we go out we act
[1:56:28] arrogantly no no
[1:56:30] no no no the spirit of christ won't do
[1:56:31] that
[1:56:33] in my heart these things i feel sorry
[1:56:36] for the way i see
[1:56:39] individuals acting there's hearts that
[1:56:42] are crying out you know what they're
[1:56:43] crying out for they're crying out for
[1:56:44] liberty
[1:56:46] they're crying out for freedom but
[1:56:49] there's only one place of liberty
[1:56:52] one place of freedom that's the spirit
[1:56:55] of the lord
[1:56:56] where the spirit of the lord is there is
[1:56:59] liberty
[1:57:02] that's real freedom it loosens you
[1:57:06] from your desire and brings that desire
[1:57:10] to serve god into a reality
[1:57:14] and then you walk you walk in liberty
[1:57:16] you're not worried about
[1:57:17] what's going on around you they look at
[1:57:19] you and say hey what's wrong you're not
[1:57:21] trouble
[1:57:22] hey how come you're not doing and you
[1:57:23] recognize i'm out of this world
[1:57:26] i'm not of this world what are what are
[1:57:29] you living for
[1:57:30] what are you doing well i'm living for
[1:57:33] that world that is to come
[1:57:35] i've already been touched
[1:57:39] by his life
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:45] glory be to god
[1:57:48] maybe this morning you're sitting here
[1:57:50] you feel a little weak
[1:57:53] he said well samuel i'm just i tell you
[1:57:57] i just feel the pressures i feel it i
[1:58:00] feel pressure all around me
[1:58:04] let me i know i had to stop but let me
[1:58:07] encourage you
[1:58:10] they that be feeble shall be as david
[1:58:15] what must i do go down to the water
[1:58:18] brook david
[1:58:20] go pick up some stones that you know
[1:58:24] see what do you mean with stones i know
[1:58:26] but the holy spirit spoke two weeks ago
[1:58:28] brother jerry standing right here
[1:58:30] knowing who you are
[1:58:31] and the spirit of god would speak right
[1:58:33] and says you can't reason
[1:58:36] go back to what you know
[1:58:39] you know what god did for you and in
[1:58:42] your life
[1:58:44] go back down to the water book pick up
[1:58:47] those stones that
[1:58:48] god has laid out for you god knew that
[1:58:50] giant god knew that pressure
[1:58:52] he knew these things would be around but
[1:58:54] remember they that be
[1:58:55] feeble shall be as david
[1:59:01] fighting like mighty men because why the
[1:59:03] lord is with me
[1:59:08] rejoicing yeah why
[1:59:12] because we are taking in
[1:59:16] of his word that revelation just
[1:59:17] something about it but david it just
[1:59:20] it has a way it packs us above the
[1:59:23] clouds
[1:59:24] of gloom it packs us
[1:59:27] not me not you
[1:59:31] if brother joy was to call me he didn't
[1:59:33] brother joy
[1:59:34] but it might be something god places
[1:59:36] upon his heart maybe a text or something
[1:59:38] it isn't it isn't the man but how that
[1:59:41] god will come through
[1:59:42] and lift us it's god
[1:59:46] lifting us so i say this morning
[1:59:51] you feel weak don't despise that
[1:59:55] this is when he's made strong
[1:59:58] he's prepared the work in your life
[2:00:01] for this moment the test the trial that
[2:00:05] you're going through
[2:00:08] as far as the mind it's beyond there's
[2:00:10] no way
[2:00:13] but these are the places that god brings
[2:00:16] us to
[2:00:17] this is why the scripture says
[2:00:21] let the weak say
[2:00:25] i am strong
[2:00:32] i will be strong no no no no he's the
[2:00:35] high priest
[2:00:37] of your confession i
[2:00:40] am strong
