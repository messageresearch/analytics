name of Jesus Christ amen amen well we want to just greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and maybe before I turn to the word here just a few moments I'm not going to take much time here tonight but I just our hearts you have already known as an assembly with brother herb Keithley and certainly our hearts are very heavy and yet we are sad but yet we are joyful because we know that our brother he's no longer suffering he has really been those of you that know very keenly aware where the herb is certainly battled especially the last two years of his in his journey here and which it's nothing new for brother herb to to battle Ian's sister Jo there's so much that I would like to say here tonight but I will reserve that here for perhaps to share some things on Sunday just a true pillar of the church you know there's many times there's pillars of different ones that can come in over the years and they're a pillar is one that is one who has established as strong in the Lord there with the vision for the Word of God their hearts desire is to see the work of God the Living Word flourish in the hearts and lives of the people and to stand faithful in all things and I would say that brother herb has done that and been that from the very beginning here and we just want to say that we so love and appreciate well everything that he has meant to us throughout the years and we are certainly going to to miss him but we know that soon and very soon we're gonna see him I would say that that day that that final at the final moment and whenever as that final moment and that final crossing over there in that dividing of time I would say there was a great reunion on the on the shores that on that evening or that morning we should say when he would meet his sweetheart sister Joe when they stood hand-in-hand and very much for the gospel of Jesus Christ and so very much they mean to this assembly some that may not know and and some of that of the background perhaps we'll be able Lord willing to share a little bit of those things a little bit of it on Sunday but I want you just to keep keep them in prayer the Keithley family and during this time also to remind you that the funeral itself is one that it is it's private we understand that because of the situation that's going on health-wise it will be streamed we will send the link to you in the email so that you can stream it the brothers and sisters if you would so if you would like to do that you'd be able to stream the service that we will have there we'll send all the information to you via email here hopefully as soon as we would have the things possibly by tomorrow I would expect if not already by this evening so without that it without for any further ado I want to say I just appreciate the testimony that I heard and I'm sure there's other testimonies and just to remind you as we said in prayer the Word of God is not bound these are not circumstances that we delight in but we know nonetheless the Word of God is not bound and to think of it you know we see that we see that that reality even where we witnessed it on the platform of where even here the prophet standing here and we know that as he would yield himself and the ange of the Lord would begin to unfold things that people had been praying about or even the doctor they had seen and go through the whole visit of the doctor's visit and you realize that though here the the prophet and the rest of the audience was there in time but the ange of the Lord would pick up the prophet and he would be able to see not in the dimension of time but here it is standing in eternity and be able to look over and say I see you were here and this is this and that and that was only to build the faith so that they could walk on and receive what was being spoken and that's why brother Branham would tell us over and over he says there's not a vision that heals you you must have faith in what he told you in the vision and that same way spiritually as well yet there is a vision the Prophet told us in Daniel 70 weeks there's a vision and a power behind this message that sent from God to get the people in order for the rapture he told us in that same message and then in the message the Ange of the Lord he spoke even in the the getting together of Israel and the 144,000 how God was moving in the earth he said the angel of the Lord is on earth tonight getting he said that of the hundred forty-four thousand in position and so we recognize we might look at it and say my that was said clear back in the late 40s or early 50s but remember God is in no hurry you can't hurry him up and you can't slow him down nothing can hinder God from fulfilling his word his word is going to be brought to pass is that right sometimes we understand God has to move in certain ways to get our attention and get us into the place so that the word itself the vision can break forth but everything is one one thing for sure is that the vision though it Terry you cannot fail so we thank God for that so we want to just also remember as we would turn in the word of the Lord tonight we also want to remember brother Joel Forney in prayer we've you know heard some good reports and I've been getting the reports appreciate different brothers I had brothers calling me from different places and and different texts and things and so not just here in the assembly but also from other places allowed me to know that about with brother Jewel and I just had spoke with brother jewel on the phone just two weeks ago and we were just talking about some different things there in the work of the Lord and you know brother Jew we just want to lift him up in prayer that God will just give our brother strength and just completely restore him and that is certainly what we're looking to so tonight I have a couple places in the scripture I'd like to go to and begin on a little thought that a few weeks ago as we're just getting ready to speak on a Thursday night here the Spirit of the Lord just came right there in the office and just moving upon these things and so we want to just bring that by the help of the Lord tonight as he would give it and has given it them in Philemon it's only one chapter but verse 1 of Philemon and we know that this is a letter it's a personal letter if you could say it it would be like maybe in our database an audio letter it was not an epistle it was a personal letter to Philemon and it was written on behalf of Onesimus but we want to focus just on the first part of that verse Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother unto Philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and I just want to focus on that part Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I like to speak on a thought or begin to hear tonight on a prisoner of Jesus Christ and sometimes when we we just think of that or that thought would be thrown out and placed out there one in their mind you know that would not be converted they have within them a warring or wrestling within and they really are still imprisoned to that of the first nature in that of the world and there can be a desire to serve God and that's what God put within them and only God can quenched that in fulfilling but once God has come and quenched that desire and God has brought it into a living reality and the old nature is dead then were no longer connected to that of that old nature of that first Adam but the second Adam has come into our heart as Peter would write the hidden man of the heart and remember just as Christ Himself just as God came down and become flesh and remember here this is where heaven and earth embrace this is where here the unfolding of redemption where God had made a body that he and through that body him coming and redeeming that body unto himself that he had made he stepped into that body that Tabernacle and He fulfilled the Word of God the law of redemption the working of the kinsmen that then the life that was with inside that blood cell once the blood cell was shed then that life can be imparted to us as believers and then we come under that blood we have been delivered from darkness and have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son then we have the testimony I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ and it is not the testimony or something within our heart that we desire to get out of on the contrary we desire more and more of him once you have tasted of the Lord and God has moved within the heart you want more and more of him you are a prisoner meaning that we desire that it would be the will of God to be fulfilled in our life because that's exactly the way it was in the life of the Lord Jesus when he was here he said I've not come to do my own will but I come to do the will of my father when sent me and so we see that from Psalms it's expressed in Psalms that sacrifice and burnt offerings that would it's not but a body has stopped prepared for me sacrifice and offerings were given that him that a man might come and have and have fellowship with God but those sacrifice and offerings could never do away with what really separated man from God and that was sin nature but God coming down and now living in that body of flesh here was the fulfillment or the restoring of what Adam the first Adam lost or forfeited now is restored by the second Adam and now that is imparted to the sons and daughters of God because in order as we were sons and daughters of God always in order to bring forth a son and daughter of God you must have the life the original life of the father that can be imparted to actually bring transformation and release the son and daughter that's beneath the darkness that cover in our life so it took God coming and now is he paid the price then that life it comes to you and then our testimony is like Paul I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ so as you know we're looking here in the scripture and I might my my my attention in my heart was drawn to in acts 28 verse 16 and when we were you remember the tops we were ministering on be of good cheer the Lord is in full control and we were dealing with that journey and we we came to a certain spot but how the Lord during that time begin to quicken some things to me I just waited just to see cuz you never know when's the timing is it now is it for a year from now when is it for and so these are some things that we just want to share from our hearts that that would relate to our walk with God and we find this is dealing with Paul they come up on the island in the shipwrecked and remember Paul is in route to Rome he has appealed unto Caesar here he is you know he is a prisoner he's being carried and transported all the way there to Rome and when they comes here in verse 16 this is after they've been on the island and so forth for three months and the Bible says in verse 16 and when we came to Rome the Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him now I want you just to think of this for a moment Paul was not regarded as anybody who had done anything wrong he was not regarded as a male factor and as someone who was a criminal but what it was they recognized there was a case that was to be heard and there was that of a request the way then it would be stated that has the other prisoners were delivered to the common prison they were sent to go there but yet here you find Paul is given an opportunity or he is rather the the allotment for him is that he would be with a soldier or a soldier would keep him he would not be in the prison but as the scripture would go on if we could read in acts 28 30 it goes on to unfold and say Paul dwelt two years in his own hired house now this was aware where there was a place a lodging it was not a jail this was a house that was there Paul that was renting now the think of it why is he here for this longevity of time when the Bible says he's there for two years in his own hired house because remember he's waiting to stand before Caesar you see he has appealed to stand before Caesar in that of a Roman citizen but it was not remember Paul is not as we read in Philemon he's not allotting hid that his imprisonment as a prisoner of Rome he said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ because it was God's will that this gospel would be carried to the Gentiles and so to think it would be the last place that God would allow Paul to be carried to would be that in Rome and how that the word itself even rise in Rome and we we won't get to that tonight now the Word of God even in the midst of his bonds the word was being manifest the word was growing now to think of it there's things that you and I have wanted and we've waited for a much shorter time Paul was there waiting for 2 years he did not know when the quarantine I mean he did not know when he was going to peel before Caesar all he knew is I'm here and this is God's will this is life that I am here so I'm going to occupy myself with the gospel so Paul is delivered and he is there while the rest of the prisoners are in the common prison but just to give you a little bit of a background within this here Paul was placed in a manner so that the soldier as the Scriptures we read there before that there was a soldier where Paul's right hand was actually in a chain and it was chained to that of a soldiers left hand it was constantly this is where the soldier kept him it was not a soldier just sitting in the house but there was a chain upon Paul's hand so wherever Paul went this soldier had to go where and when Paul sat down the soldier he could get close by kid stander Achatz sat down wherever wherever whatever Paul did this soldier had to do and to think of it the soldier itself just sold that the soldier didn't get so overtired the soldier was relieved of its duties according to that of history every four hours there was a fresh soldier that was put on duty so when we think of this this to me it just seems very parallel when we look at this of even our walk as believers you know Paul would write it like this in Romans 8:21 and he would say the creature itself now what's a ball what he's speaking of the creature itself talking about the real son and daughter of God on the inside shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God you see Liberty has already come to our soul and once that Liberty has come to our soul which is the earnest of the Spirit it becomes aware to you and I this this veil this body is the bondage of corruption it will its weaknesses within this body but when Christ is moved on the inside there is no weakness in him and we are in him so this is where we can say greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me so this this bondage that you and I this bondage of corruption is that of the pest house brother branham would refer to it in that way in many places it's a pest house Paul would pick it up and write in Romans 7 verse 14 and say for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate do I if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now venting is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing remember Paul would expressly over and over a says it in the book of Philippians he says that that for If any man think is to have confidence in the flesh he said I more he said for Here I am a Pharisee of the Pharisees born of the stock of Benjamin he lay what's he letting it be known the flesh no matter what kind of pedigree is behind this flesh it's death it's to have no confidence in this flesh let me just say it clearly it doesn't matter if this flesh has been in a message church it's still corruption it's gotta come a change on the inside hey man there's got to be a Liberty come on the inside cuz this man is the Ishmael he can never be tamed by word alone come on somebody he can only the only way Ishmael can ever be brought in subjection is when Isaac rises from the inside and Isaac is what Isaac is that gene that is written in the Lamb's Book of Life and when the Holy Ghost has come it stands there it seals the breach between that soul and that representation there on the Lamb's Book of Life and what happens there you begin the reflection of the life that is written in the word the character of this hour is being made manifest through your life you are no longer in bondage and slavery to that of the old man but now you are you to Christ the word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my because Ishmael Hien there's got to be an Isaac that's who God said my covenant shall be with him for know for to me for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man that's what's important who's your delight Psalms one one come on now blessed is the man is that right that man is planted not freshly planted brother bran tells us that planting it was by predestination in the word for this hour and the Spirit of God moves upon you to reveal you are already ordained in Christ but the Spirit of God has made you aware of those rights redemptive rights that belong to you that you can claim as a son and daughter of God where the enemy has tried to rob you and keep you back you can say I've got a right these are my redemptive rights there was a sacrifice my sacrifice on Calvary and these are my redemptive rights I've got a right to healing I've got a right to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've got a right to deliverance I have redemptive rights that Jesus Christ has come and he has restored back to me I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see notice I see another law in my members whose members are they they belong to me this body is given to me is that right it's your body is given to you that's why brother Branham will tell us he said you've never seen the real William Branham all you've seen is the thorn right you've only seen the form which that of the expression or as it would be spoken of there in the book of Philippians being morphe of God wherein that which is invisible would strike the visible form so what we have seen and brother man said you come up and say god bless you brother man three your brother branham but really who is it the real brother branham is the one who's down on the inside that's why when a saint or child of God when God would summons them home remember he is graduating taking with him precious and the side of the Lord is the death of his Saints what's he doing he is calling out the jewels that have already been brought forth in that life it is character the very character that life who they really are what do we go to the funeral home and see we see the shell but the real one lived in and that shell was just a temporary home here but all we go to one that is not made with hands it is reserved in the heavens and while we're here in this life we are reflecting that we are from another world Oh glory be to God yeah I see this law in my members you're blessed to see this warring against the law of my mind you're blessed to see it that way and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members all wretched man that i let me just stop then let me back up on verse 23 you might look at that and say it brings me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members do not get your mind just on drinking smoking adultery fornication remember sin is unbelief and to think about it if you allow something to dwell it might be a grudge a hard feeling how many of us and I'm gonna ask you to raise your hands you've had to repent for something you've said it may not have been what you said was wrong it might have been the motive and objective of which you had behind it and you realize that was wrong it wasn't so much what was said it was the motive or ejected or the way it was said what was that the law of sin in our members is that right oh but we realize we don't just let that alone say oh you know that wasn't me no Sarah we say forgive me Lord Jesus or if it's something I've done to brother Richard or brother bill say brothers forgive me I shouldn't have said that what is that patty is not allowing that law to reign in that life I will not give no place to the devil Oh Gloria now sometimes when that has to be done this soldier don't want to go do it you win we win you know we take the right hand and we sit come on we're going well we've got to go make something right sir and soldier says no no no the flesh says no no no no no no if I do that then it'll embarrass me I mean look what they'll make me fight look what they'll feel about me but the inside man says come on we're going and I need to borrow your lips Oh wretched man that I am my wood we've been delivered of the pride in our soul oh my then we've got victory right there all wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin no brother branham answers this in many different places in the message but I'm just going to pick up the one in question as an answer 64 when brother Brandon would go to answer this particular question about I can't understand Romans seven and brother Bram says let me just kind of polish it up so you can he said this is what Paul is saying in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do you know that what the right one wants me to do and wrong the other one wants me to do and every time I start to do right then wrong hinders me now we can ask you in your living rooms how many of felt led to do something before and instead of doing it you know they get so lets it gets all reasoned out and you don't go to do it what was the reasoning part the reasoning part did not come from with him that of the soul but the reasoning part came from that other pool than other part that's out there now notice he says you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses or five senses rather you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and this faith disagrees with all five senses if the five senses doesn't agree with faith oh my so we don't remember God doesn't need a majority he is us and God are in the majority when he called when he called and spoke to Gideon he said thou mighty man of Valor remember Gideon was only one but remember it does not take a whole company or a whole multitude of people we see that in Gideon's day we see it in other wars that his real fought it was not about the multitude of numbers you and God the Prophet would say it like this you and God are in the majority when you are united together I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me now notice this so faith itself faith will stand alone when the rest of the senses are trying to pull it this way or trying to say this but faith will make it stand upon God's Word now he says now one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with the faith wonderful but when the five senses disagrees with faith then leave the five senses alone but how many times that we have not and then we have to come around and say Lord forgive me right forgive me what happened well that God that were chained to is the one that's pulled us in that way is that right but the end the end were God the real Paul the real you the real son and daughter of God on the inside remember this is where the struggle this is where then here as we war even when the word would come forth let me just keep reading here brother Graham said for example Jesus made a statement and the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore oh my then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man it doesn't mean that the outside man is going to shut up but you've got to ignore him you know God listen we'll just look at it for example through the scripture you found that when God well when Abraham was praying to God in the book of Genesis and he said O God that Ishmael might live before you you find when he was praying that way God just runs right over top of that he acts like it didn't even hear it he ignores what Abraham is praying about and about two verses later he after Abraham gets done God just picks it up as though they both had been talking about Isaac and then after God gets done saying what he wants to say then God says oh yeah by the way yeah I've heard you what you said about Ishmael he said my covenant is not with him but but I'll bless him and this and that you see what is it God's Word if God values his word first this is what God is speaking to is the inside man then if God would so value that to bring you and have the redemption battle by the new birth then how much more should you and I value that of the inside of really the real true you and me that is down on the inside not valuing our own plots out here our own opinions out here our own feelings out here those are the things that under us and they hinder the working of the Lord in our lives now notice this is why brother Branham would go on to say in that same quote he said we are carnal and that part must perish now what he's talking about right there and just that little abbreviated statement there's got to come a perishing of that nature on the inside we cannot perfect this body that's not the perfection that is entrusted to you and I but without to receive the perfection that comes from the Lord where he said in Matthew 5:48 be you therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect is that right and then we find where Paul would write and he would say let us go on to perfection Paul was not writing that for you and I to try to perfect this body but the real perfection comes when our nature is changed and there comes the perfection of that life on the inside that the Indrid man delights to do the law of the Lord where the desire on the inside of all of our life is to please the Lord Jesus Christ so that carnal part that's on the inside has to die well if that inside part dies what do you have you have the shell the temple that is only a temple a house where one guy used to live but now when the new man steps on the inside when Jesus Christ comes down and brother he brings about the new birth others can look at you and say well I remember Richard Sanchez or I remember Tony Gomez and they can go down that but you know there's something different about them now they see the same house out here but they know there's something different they can't put their hand on it what is that there has been a transformation that is taking place on the inside there's been the new man Christ Jesus that has brought a son and daughter of God into expression it's the same old temple but brother we are a new creation in Christ Jesus all things have passed away and behold all things have become new Oh glory be to God and then inside we are a spirit man soul inside that's faith in God's Word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what God said now he goes on he says how can I take a a burrow and make a grain of wheat out of it the son of this statement no it's not very deep but it's very important it's impossible for me to do it it doesn't matter how much how much sweet life is preached and the cockerel says well you know I'm gonna try to do this and I'm going to try to do that it's impossible for you to do it it's impossible it takes a sovereign work of Almighty God because you're not gonna face flakes of flesh and blood you are going to come face to face with demon powers you've got to have assurance in your heart that passes beyond the five senses you've got to have an anchor that I know that I know that I know that I know that I am his and he is mine it's impossible for you to do it the only way is because inside that kokuboro has been transmitted from a kookaburra a cook a burl to a germ called wheat life wheat life so if we take it you could take this seat here you take the or LCD cut it open on the inside is a germ of kokuboro if you take the germ out of kokuboro put the germ of wheat on the inside close it back up and you plant it when you plant it what's going to come out of it once that seed ross wheat life that's where the mystery and the unfolding of great is the mystery of godliness the baptism of the holy ghost it's God's sovereign work that takes out the old Cocker burrow jerem and he puts in that wheat germ from the inside Oh glory be to God oh my then you bury that Taco Bell it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in that Tucker burrow and the life of the kokuboro has been taken out but the nature of the kokuboro is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again until we the body that matches what has taken place in our soul we're still gonna deal with this sticky kokuboro part o glory when it comes forth then it's no more cooker bro I'm looking forward to that aren't you you see it we don't want to just be I want to be young cockerels no that's not what the body change is the body changes and come on coming back to a young KOCO bro no kokuboro is that nature that's sex birth but there is to come that will the birth of a life of a body that will not come through him by sex but it will be a body that will come forth by the spoken word of god as joe said he will call and I will answer a man just as that soul of yours has responded and answered the call of the world in this hour there were our bodies will answer the call of the word because the real you and me on the inside are actually leading our bodies to a change so come on Roman alright oh man a cockerel notice while it's here on earth a cockle barrel it's still sticky but it's got the nature on side inside of a wheat as long as you're in this life you're gonna be sticky and have a carnal nature you know it's sticky means a Oboro is something you can be walking by it and you don't even have to brush you in hard against it and it sticks to your pants or it stick to your sleeve I've had them when I went out hunting and especially at different times with brother herb we'd be clown and Wellington walking through woods and fields and I'd come out of there after leaving out a certain way to meet him back out there man I'd come forth in my hunting gear I'd have cooker bras all over me then boogers to hurt when you go to try to grab them and pull them off they want a stick they don't want to go really easily I hope you're hearing me tonight there's certain things certain feelings we have but you don't know how they looked at me you don't know what they said to me you don't know what they did to my family there are certain sticky parts about us that sometimes that stickiness just don't want to let things go it wants to hold onto things and keep building walls around it keep propping it up making excuses for it but let the wheat life on the inside let it help you pluck away all of those cockle burrs that might still be sticking on your life and hanging around your life come on church there are things that you and I may have even from our early life of things that was of no fault of our own certain things that would surround us and it was little hurts or wounds or scars or whatever and the enemy will always exploit those things like he exploits a bruise hell and cancer will thorn that's the way that the enemy will try to come and exploit those areas but you've been given wheat life on the inside a greater is he that is within you you've got power there to be able to pull those sticky parts away I like this that's a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live how about you out there streaming does it bother you if it don't bother you then you got problems if you make excuses for it you got problems it ought to be things that bother you there's one guy that bothers me more than anybody that's me but you see the real me is able to make the difference between me and me are you with me how are you able to do that the word is a discerner it separates hallelujah but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing no brother man you know you've heard me speak of this in different ways and different times than a lot of other ministers and brother man he alludes to this part about that Indian chief in the same Bank or or quote or question remember the Indian chief when they asked him after he received the Holy Ghost he said they asked him how do you do he said sometimes good sometimes bad and they asked him what in the world do you mean and he said since me got the Holy Ghost he said it's like two dogs in me warring is that right now notice he goes on and brother BAM says see remember they asked the chief which one of them wins you know the black dog and went oh he said it depends on which one chief feeds the most you catch what he said it's not about which one of those dogs gets in there and bullies out the other one no the chief is the one who determines which one gets fed the most let me tell you something when the Holy Ghost just come to you he is the chief Shepherd and Bishop of your soul he has entrusted you and I God will not pray for us he will not read our Bibles for us he will not listen to the message for us he will not do the personal walk for us it is something that you are I must make a decision on a daily basis and even moment-to-moment it is not something that you can even go and say well man yesterday I had a good day remember the guards were changed every four hours sometimes we get weary but the devil is just changing them out here he comes in with fresh from bombed bombardments are you with me here is this soldier that is there that Paul has chained to now I want you to think of this he said it just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to God has never made anybody stumble in their walk God has never made any of us become cooled off or cold none God has never done that that's us God entrust us with this responsibility which Nader it all depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God and we just be honest with you right now when the scripture goes on to say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against capital s PIR t the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law now in order for us to be led of the Spirit we've got to be surrendered and submissive to his will is that right we never and we never you know the Roman the Roman soldier he was never looking at Paul and as we'll look at it here Paul wrote many epistles during this time I don't know if Paul was right-handed or left-handed I don't know what she was I guess it really didn't matter because Paul would write many different epistles during this time that would express the life of Christ he would also deal with the falling away and the apostasy when he would right there within Timothy but much of it is dealing with the expression of Christian life manifestation of sons and daughters about our position in Christ Jesus not to think of it have all that would be wrote all of these letters there would be one soldier then maybe another one than another one here they were coming at different times there's not one of those soldiers are you listening to me there's not one of those soldiers got inspiration from God to write the book of Philippians there's not one of them that got inspiration to write the book of Ephesians but they were so close to the one who was receiving the direct inspiration from God that would express and make known the revelation of Jesus Christ our position in Christ Jesus can't you see that this part right here the flesh profiteth nothing but the spirit it deals with the inner man there's a part of you and me that is made to receive inspiration from the throne of God there's another part of you and I it can stay right under the inspiration all night law but it will never ever be able to receive it harness it to where it could become expressed but the inside man on the inside can see I received a direct revelation from God that comes rolling from an unseen rail it moves down there from that inside man and inspiration strikes it brother though we are here in a bondage of corruption but we are receiving messages from home the Word of God is not bound Oh glory be to God notice here the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh now watch how brother Ram will break this down in the message thirst 1965 he said there's two different kinds of thirst there is a thirst physically and there is a thirst also spiritually and he speaks he write reads that of a belief Psalms 42 my soul thirsts for God for the Living God he said now son historic or something that happened some years ago or some tale that someone told not not that but for the Living God a god that's ever-present and his soul thirsted for that God not for some historical something you see the first the first is a great blessing blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled now we find God gives the control tower in you to give you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and you see that just as much as I do just in the natural part there are certain things you get a hankering or hunger for we say hankerin if you get something you're wanting one to eat man and you know you go to get it out refrigerator you get this I don't hit the spot did your going to get that or hit the spot then you go over it and you want this now I want that know about that now know about that and it's something you're longing for there's some sort of a craving there's some sort of a thirst that we are searching for now in the spiritual part of it God has given that controlled power that first that to give us the things that we have needed now that control tower in you is what directs you he says this thirst runs in on this control tower and tells you what you have meet how spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and in the soul also there is a control tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body you don't have to tell yourself you're hungry you've got a signal on the inside you let you know I'm hungry is that right certain things that are built within certain appetites and whatever more it'll kick in and it it'll it'll pull upon that now notice that tells you that you've got need in your body it's brought to you by thirst also there is a control power in your soul that tells you the spiritual things you have need of something in your spirit so even when we're looking listen to me now even when we're looking let me Paul's here on the natural things do you realize even on the natural things we want to pass that through the filter of God's Word table does not strip all of the different desires and appetites and other things that are here job doesn't want that but remember when there goes to be a calling remember were to run that through the word so what it'll come out in a godly way are you with me now notice this here he says now he says there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things you have need of or something in your spirit and you listen by this and tell what kind of a life is controlling you but what what are your desires on the inside when you can see what your desires are then you can tell by that what kind of a something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have so there is a certain thing you thirst for and it can tell you in your soul what your desire is by the nature of the first that you have so when a person wants to know have a pass from death unto life now remember you can say well I had an experience but let me remind you in a prisoner of Jesus class that's not the only message well brother Branham would spend a great deal of time in there in Hebrews matter-of-fact throughout all the message he would let us know that the experience is the passing from death unto life Paul listen I really don't know if anybody else maybe there's been some others brother branham different ones that would have some sort of a supernatural experience as far as they're as they see that pillar fire we know he's appeared right here we know also that he has made himself known to different ones but notice Paul Paul even in has it spoke out and said I'm Jesus whom now persecutors Paul never put his foot on that right then he went in the desert and he proved it out because any experience must match the Word of God it was more than just God revealing himself in the pillar fire but Paul had to see that that same God the reality the supernatural God that promised that he had promised Israel that it had taken place in his life when Paul walked out that supernatural experience that he had brother it was not just something that he was a part of around a meeting but it had moved into his life his desires his nature was changed Paul didn't have to wrestle and say well I still want to be a Pharisee and you know I still want to go around and do this no he was tied to that but remember when the new birth has come there's a different absolute now on the inside there you're a prayin and out of Paul's hands and well you got to turn this loose well you got to let this go Paul you got a no sir Paul was tied to a different absolute so then whatever God desired for his life Paul said thank you lord I yield myself to it a change had come on the inside he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so you can tell by the nature that's on the inside of you what are your desires notice the control tower of the soul one for the body each tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for it sends out a wave of warning so for example for instance he said the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul many times these war one against another and he said that's where we find the great trouble today too many people try to live between those two desires from one of them desires the thing of the earth and the other desires a thing of heaven God don't want us live in between two desires and they just say to you right now maybe and you guys are blessed thing if you're in a place where you have not experienced that victory on the inside you know that the love the love of the world is still there the desires for the things of the world you know that that is still there then you know right now if there is something beneath that that says but yet I want to serve God I want to serve God don't try to live between the desires of the flesh and the desire that's down there in your soul ask God to come and quick in that desire you say what do I do you that desire is quickened by our surrendering God will never override our own human will he did not drag his son to Calvary against his own will are you with me the only way that the lamb went was by a surrendered will the only way death can come and the new birth come is by a surrendered will is that wrapped but there's a warning collar that goes out so let's say here that the body you know here are the soul the soul begins to say you know what I want to I want to go pray that begins to move forth it sends out there a call but the body says no you're too tired your knees hurt well what do my knees have to do with praying I can pray on my knees pray standing Paul said standing I can pray on my face I can pray Paul says always that means if I'm walking in the middle of Walmart I can pray is that right so prayer is not a condition of the body it's a condition of the heart is that right so it relieves us a tradition to know that prayer itself you know prayer it's not just the words coming out of our mouth prayer is even the meditation of our heart when you begin to meditate get quiet because in prayer many times prayer is just it's just pray words afterwards afterwards afterwards but that's not real prayer the prayer always starts with worship then notice the Bible will always bring together prayer and supplications prayer is the worship prayer is the praise that goes up to him for who he is and then the supplication our requests that are to follow the worship for who he is but you notice here this this outside God will say you're too tired you're too weak uh you know what it's time to go to church or it's time to log in Oh we'll just catch it tomorrow you know oh you know God is so good he understands but you remember you've got to remember here if you're really if you if you're a real prisoner of Jesus Christ God is not going to bring that room and in subjection for you you've got to bring that room in in subjection and let me just tell you something it isn't just something on church days if you feel or we feel our life with a lot of carnal stuff of the world I'm not talking about watching awful movies and this and that I'm not even talking about that I'm talking about where you actually starve that white dog on the inside by feeling your life with so many other things and this is going on and this is going on I'll tell you it ought to be a heart's desire but not just when I walk back through those doors when they allow us to come back in here but while I'm at home right now in my life I want that white dog to be a big fat dog I want that black dog to be smaller skinner skinnier than a chihuahua brother I want his bones to be showing where I have starved him to death and had that white dog and that's what it is with you and I hi it requires who you and I will cater to cuz this let me just tell you the Roman when Paul would have the room and say come over here Paul what are you gonna do the inspiration for me to write right here Paul come on you just man you just wasn't writing how long you wrote how many chapters you wrote and then you had that nut pencil on your thing and you look like you was out somewhere in la-la land down there and then all sudden you'd come back in and write oh come on man why do I gotta come over there right now II can't you just write at any time but you see you can't turn inspiration on and all to a child of God a mind so Paul he would say no this is right here you got to come over here remember Paul did not have to obey that Roman that Roman was given there with a chain and that Roman had to call where Paul wins and I'll tell you Paul had to get to a place he wasn't ashamed where he went he packed that Roman with him when it came time to raise his hands he raised his hands and when he did the hands of the Roman went up in the air why they were chained together they were chained together the Roman had to do what Paul did and I'll tell you if the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the grave if it well in you it shall also quicken your mortal body it brings that outside man subject to the word this is why that inside man there's got to be a change because the worshiper once he's purged has no more desire for sin it's not know if I can keep myself from this oh if I can keep myself I better not look at this and I better not do this know what you need to do is get real Liberty you need to get real Liberty where it takes the very desire out of you and puts a good a better one a stronger one on the inside the Bible goes on to say first John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world men love the world the love of the father is not in him notice how he dealt with this you cannot have the love of the world and the love of the Father they won't cohabitate it's either one love or the other Jesus taught it no man can serve two masters it's all right brother Burleigh preached it right here in January you can't serve two masters you can't do that you can't be bitter and sweet water coming out is that right it's cotton when it's the love of the Father on the inside that right there is a desire that you know on the inside the love of the world's gone this is why Paul would go on to write in Romans 8:1 I'm trying to come down there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh let me just tell you like this right here not only was the law weak but even listen to me now the message that God has sent us if it doesn't ever grow go any deeper than the flesh the learning of the doctrines come on now I'm quoting come follow thou mean 1963 preached to a group of graduates out there in Phoenix brother Graham says oh he says I think we've studied the message and it's become like theology to us he said that that won't do you've got to meet the person of Jesus Christ this message has got to be more than doctrines it's got to be more than truth you've got to meet the person of Jesus Christ himself to where it becomes the message of life to you where it has breathed life into your soul but all the liberty that comes with this message if you're just yield because when the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty brother this message calls you to Liberty if you just let go it'll take you to what God is calling you to to what the desire you have in your life in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh aren't you glad he paid that price that you and I could walk free he paid the necessary judgement that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they they they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace oh but he says ye verse 9 are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be but the Spirit of God dwell in you and if Christ verse 10 be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness you know the scripture goes on to tell us we've got an anchor within the veil there's a forerunner that's went Jesus Christ the righteous the life has come back upon our lives the brother man will take this scripture right here and to bring it right around to our lives and says do you realize what's behind your veil is an anchor he said because remember he said it's this veil that keeps us from seeing God who's in this place he said it's this veil who keeps us from seeing the angels but it goes on to declare it to us he says now remember you're always in the prints of God and he quotes the scriptures lo I'm with the always I'll never leave you no forsake you on and on through the Scriptures he quotes but you know what happens this veil remember the veil is by feelings the veil itself sometimes you don't feel is that right sometimes when we don't feel but you see God trains us even in the times where we don't feel remember feeling itself it's not what our faith is based on there's not one of us that don't love to feel God and feel the presence of God but remember there are times where we've got to stand upon God's Word when there ain't no feeling all around this is where trust and perfect faith comes into play when we don't have any feeling when there's no feeling like the Hebrew children that's one example but we've got to stand on thus saith the LORD why because his presence is abiding in us and we are in him so it's this veil that keeps us from seeing God but RAM said it's this veil that keeps us here from actually living the way we should it's the veil that keeps it from doing the things that we really want to do is that right I want to ask you how many of you sitting out there in front of your computer tablet phone or whatever now how many of you said you know what man I were I really wish I'd have done that this day or this week or or this or that and what is it the Veil the veil gets in the way we're not making excuses for it but we realize hey wait a minute here I cannot let that veil have the right away there's times I've got to bring it over there when that Roman soldier when he says no no no I don't want I don't want no more inspiration I don't want you to get over there and write them letters I don't want to do that right now why because that that soldier that Roman soldier still has that carnal sticky nature that Roman soldier is the one that says remember so-and-so I mean what so-and-so says I'll tell you right now he's preaching on you I'll tell you right now you know what they said you know how your wife you know she said that nah she looked at you boy you ought to just straighten her out right now you remember how your husband said this night what gets on that that ain't the son and daughter of God on the inside because the son and daughter of God on the inside is one that's a lover of peace come on somebody it's a love for a peace but that outside man gets sticky and it wants to keep bringing things up and you did this and you did that you know what the sticky guy wants to do it gets stuck on something ooh and it keeps on bringing it up and you think could you get over it come on somebody now but we gotta I've gotta have this hammered out right here I've got it but remember what is that sticky part of our life but remember God gives us grace on the inside of we can recognize it it's that sticky part that actually if we allow it to go on it hinders the love of God from propagating out into our spirit and moving over to bring our body in subjection but what do we want to do let the inward man have the right away it's kind of like when you're out there on a construction site you're driving down the road all of a sudden you see the guys standing there with the sign right and he has on he can put it once they're slow flips it elves are stopped is that right and remember there's only one lane of traffic open only one can proceed you can't get both ways of traffic not both ways are open right now so there's only one way that holds somebody there's only one way so what has to happen well hell you can show up there and say I think I got here man I've got here first I'm going faster I've got it that it becomes our way and here here here here here the towers going out on the inside stop stop will say that stop stop don't do that stop what the Spirit of God but bless our on the inside it's clear now hey hey hey don't do that hey hey don't do that hey that way before you even say anything it's picking up the vibrations that are there like a lie detector can pick it up the inside man picks it up and says you're not in a condition this is not right don't go that way it's vibrating on the inside but the Roman says come on let's go come on let's go but the inward man is buzzing there on the outside don't go that way don't go that way don't go that way what should we do see what the sign says do science says stop stop stop lord help me temper my spirit temper my heart it's not right Lord it's not writing right now a temperate father and then it turns slowly and you're able to ease on out in there and slowly going around the obstacle there's obstacles that we come in contact with over and over Paul said in Romans 6 neither yield ye yourselves instruments to unrighteousness they yield your instruments to righteousness as those that are alive unto God from the dead instruments our spirit my body yielded to righteousness yield it is the key captivity can do a great thing we see it here and constantly his brother Brandon would put it like this in perfect strength he says that many times in the message but Allah Kylie says it and the message perfect strength remember how God would come to Paul and Paul would write about this where he had asked God three times take this away from me it was that where his eyes are brother Ram would tell us it wasn't a besetting sin Paul's eyes brother brems said they would come and go certain things God would touch his body his eyes you'd be able to see real good then you find like when he wrote in the book of Galatians he said you see how I've wrote him with written with large letters his eyesight mother bream said his eyesight was never the same since he's seen a pillar of fire and how that the enemy a messenger of Satan would come and buffeting blow after blow not on not all the time not every day but there would be times where it would come to buffeting why by God knew that Paul needed help to keep this Roman in subjection because this Roman can get in just a moment's I won't even say a snap just real quick he can go right into the channel of pride and with all that God had showed to Paul God said I've got to keep him in a place so he can reflect this so it can be reflected through himself God to remind him and help him it wasn't that palme the inside did not didn't know that he needed he needed the help with the Lord he did he said we got this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency may be of the power of God and not us he knew that but you see just knowing it even though he was the prophet of God full of the Holy Ghost he needed help this is what Paul would say when I'm weak then I'm strong the RAM says from the riches from the riches of us to the poorest of us from the lowest to the highest he said it's us that keeps God out of our lives us beginning god it's us it's us and then he makes the familiar statement that you and I've heard many times notice how he words it if I can get William Brennan out of the way I can get my wheel out of the way if I can get my direction my way my thoughts my opinions my abyss but then goes through a whole litany of things in that particular quote he says then when that can happen notice not God get him out of the way Lord Jesus you come get my faults other way no you have to get him out of the way what brothers saying I might buy those thoughts that seems so hard right now what dog you been feeding it's Paul the little skinny guy and the Romans a big chunk you need to fatten up the paul on the inside hallelujah brother harun if you're listening that's the reality he prepared me a table in the presence of mine enemies this guy on the inside is feasting on the Word of God and this kind the outside sometimes this guy could get around say don't you feel like you need to go the bathroom don't you feel like you need not not that's it so it's okay to go to the bathroom but you know sometimes they didn't get the moving on this outer guy sometimes we have to learn you know what I shouldn't have drunk that an extra cup of coffee before I come here because it's causing me to leave when the preaching is going on what happens you're learning not to allow that soldier that's chained to you to control you but you see you take even the natural appetites of it and you funnel it right through and say women I know you'd like another cup but we're going to the house of God and I ain't leaving when the song service is over matter of fact today I'm changing my routine when song service is over I'm sitting right here in the pew and I'm waiting on the Word of God come on somebody you see it's where we start telling the Roman son rob somebody this is how things are going to be I'm not tied to you you're tied to me as long as I'm here in this slot you're gonna do what I tell you to do if I say we're going to church we're going to church if I say we're reading we're reading we're praying even if you fuss and complain and hold my knees are hurting oh this is certain hold my back you know what I'll lay in the bed and pray then but I'm still gonna have contact with God [Applause] when I can get he says william branham out of the way he said then Jesus can come and have a good and do things far beyond that of William Branham aren't you glad for this deliverance aren't you glad that you can look and say that's what I used to have on the inside of me I used to have an old Roman nature on the inside of me I don't have a Roman nature in the water I'm a child of God on the inside aren't you glad there's a war aren't you glad that that old carnal sticky nature bothers you and aren't you glad for the Spirit of God on the inside that says no peace pact no compromise let's pray father we thank you tonight for your mercy Lord Oh God Lord - look at this when you just spoke to my heart I begin to look at these things have been studying or for weeks looking at these parts with Paul or he would write in these prison epistles we see the part Lord that here he is in Rome he was there I would say when Paul would speak and even write in Romans chapter 1 it's for sure he desired to go there but many times he said when I got when I wanted to go there the way was hindered everything is always in your timing the Lord I would say just like many of us this was a circumstance that Paul found himself in that was not because of his doing he was clear in these scriptures between the one that we open with tonight and those last two verses and acts he lay he let those jews that he gathered their first even the father's among the Jews and would speak of to them of the hope of Israel the redemption that which is made known through Isaiah fulfilled through Jesus Christ as he would make known of those things Lord God Paul himself no doubt he never thought about there would be the circumstances he never thought Lord God that here he would be in a house hired house though he had more Liberty as far as not being in a prison but he had a Roman soldier chained to him every four hours there would be a relieving of that Roman soldier of fresh life a new one would come Lord what it shows me which we know as believers but what it makes us know very clearly this is why the inward and then man needs to be removed this is why we need as Paul would write in Romans 12 a renewing of our mind we need renewed he would write Lord in the book of Titus we need a renewing by the Holy Ghost we need renewing we need Lord God truly if there's anybody listening tonight Lord that has not been born of the Spirit of God and they find themselves Lord God's steel with the love of the world in their life I pray tonight Lord God may they realize the simplicity of it it's simply yielding to you it's simply giving over and say Lord I'm tired of this I want to serve you food I'm tired of acting tired of going through the drills I don't want I want to serve you I want you to be the Lord of my life father when a sincere heart will call out in that way that they are ready to die you come you'll step forward and Lord Jesus from where that you have stepped may be Lord right into the very edge of their life as their Savior but you want to be lord you want to have control over every door of their life of our lives or these circumstances that we are in oh god I never thought it would be this way that Here I am i preaching lord god to a church that's intended my lord god just right here in front of me Lord

streaming on the Internet I never thought I never imagined it this way annoyed this circumstance is not going to hinder the Word of God it didn't hinder the Word of God when Paul was there Oh Lord God
