[39:04] Amen. If God be for us,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; who could be against us?
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:12] Should have been a more hearty amen on
[39:14] that one. Amen. God is for us.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; And you know,
[39:20] &gt;&gt; God is he's interested in his word. And
[39:22] that's the safest place that we can
[39:24] stand
[39:25] &gt;&gt; because God is obligated to his word.
[39:27] Amen. I believe we're a part of the word
[39:29] and
[39:30] &gt;&gt; we're standing on that word and God's
[39:32] obligated to that word.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he takes us to where
[39:35] Moses um
[39:38] &gt;&gt; called out to God and he said, "Lord,
[39:39] take me blot my name out of the book
[39:41] first." And uh Brother Bram said, "You
[39:44] see, you put you put God's word before
[39:49] him." He said, "God can't go over his
[39:51] own word."
[39:52] &gt;&gt; God God came right there. As a matter of
[39:55] fact, brother Rem goes on to say, he
[39:57] said, "What God saw in Moses' heart was
[40:02] the cross."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sacrifice.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, take me first.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; We want to be standing on his word. I
[40:10] believe God has given us the grace to do
[40:12] that. Amen. And so, we're so thankful
[40:15] for that this morning. And we I know the
[40:17] requests that were made um uh from Marco
[40:20] and then I just sent out that I just
[40:22] received from Sister Anna just moments
[40:25] before service uh where Marco had had
[40:28] that pacemaker put in this morning and
[40:30] uh just needing just to a real rest and
[40:34] and uh just a real calming there for him
[40:38] as well and with breathing and all of
[40:40] that. And you know, even when things
[40:43] have um taken place, many times we
[40:45] you've you've experienced this enough to
[40:48] see that many times when we're praying
[40:51] for needs,
[40:53] when you begin to see victory, that's
[40:55] not the time to let up,
[40:57] &gt;&gt; but pursue.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Like when Gideon, the Midianites were
[41:02] routed, but Gideon went and he chased
[41:06] those other two down. And that's what we
[41:09] want to do. We want to just hold uh
[41:11] Marco up in prayer. Uh also the request
[41:15] was made and that came out earlier this
[41:17] morning as well for Sister
[41:20] Irma Cruz uh that the Lord will just uh
[41:23] moving there uh for that need as well.
[41:25] And we certainly believe that God's more
[41:27] than enough.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; God's more than able and he's willing.
[41:30] How many believe that?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said if two or three
[41:33] agree is touching any one thing, it it
[41:35] shall be done. And we're standing here
[41:38] as believers. We haven't made ourselves
[41:40] believers. We're standing here by the
[41:42] grace of God. So, we just want to draw
[41:45] amen upon the Lord here. Let's just go
[41:48] to him in a word of prayer. Heavenly
[41:50] Father,
[41:52] Lord, as you see each and every request,
[41:56] you see every need.
[41:59] Lord, you know the things that we Lord
[42:02] have need of even before we would ask.
[42:05] But father, we ask you Lord because we
[42:09] believe that Father, as you have said,
[42:12] ask the Father, anything in my name and
[42:14] I'll do it. We believe, Lord, that
[42:18] you're more than enough, Lord. You're
[42:20] more than able. And to believe that God,
[42:23] you have satisfied, you have made a way,
[42:27] Father, for every need, Lord, to be met
[42:30] already.
[42:32] Lord, we just Lord want to unite
[42:35] our faith and our hearts together Lord
[42:38] on behalf of these requests Lord I know
[42:41] that they have already been offered up
[42:43] in prayer even before the service Lord
[42:46] ever even started Lord but Father we
[42:50] know one thing we can never do too much
[42:52] and that's pray Lord we're just Lord
[42:55] looking oh God and asking for your favor
[42:58] Lord upon these needs Lord for for Marco
[43:01] Lord that you would move, Lord. I pray
[43:04] on his behalf, Lord, just a complete
[43:08] deliverance, Lord. We pray, Father.
[43:10] Lord, you're merciful, Lord. And we
[43:13] also, Lord, ask, oh God, that you would
[43:16] just, Lord, visit the hospital room
[43:19] there as well, Lord, for Sister Irma.
[43:22] May you just touch her, Lord. I pray may
[43:24] the angel of the Lord, I pray, God, just
[43:28] sweep through that room, Lord. May you
[43:31] just move, Lord, I pray as only you can
[43:34] do, Lord. For Lord, we're standing here,
[43:36] Lord, holding to your promise that
[43:38] you're the Lord that healeth all our
[43:40] diseases. Father, you by your stripes we
[43:45] are made whole, Lord. We're standing, oh
[43:48] God, upon your word. There's no greater
[43:52] place that you have that we could stand,
[43:54] Lord. And oh God, we just, Lord, look to
[43:58] you this morning. I pray that Lord that
[44:01] you would just give us grace as we've
[44:03] gathered here that we Lord all together
[44:06] could just step away for a few moments
[44:09] Lord and knowing that the cares of life
[44:12] that Lord that we we face things that
[44:16] are before us Lord even in this coming
[44:18] week and things that you know that lays
[44:21] before us but Lord we just our request
[44:24] is just to lay it down before you Lord
[44:28] and Father Father, within this moment,
[44:30] Lord, I believe God that you can just so
[44:34] move down for us in such a way that'll
[44:37] give us, Lord, just a real
[44:39] a real strength even to face the cares
[44:43] of this life to where Lord our lives are
[44:46] not overwhelmed by the cares of this
[44:49] world. But Father, we receive sufficient
[44:53] grace, Lord, to face, Lord, those
[44:56] things, Lord, that you see that await
[44:59] us. Even things that, Lord, that we have
[45:02] questions about and we need direction,
[45:05] Lord, in our lives, Father, we're asking
[45:08] for your mercy. And we ask that God,
[45:11] you'll just come in a special way.
[45:14] May you just, Lord, so anoint our hearts
[45:16] and our ears. Anoint me, Lord, I pray.
[45:20] Give me the grace that Lord, not only
[45:21] myself but this entire congregation
[45:24] might just be able to step aside and may
[45:27] you have the right away this morning. We
[45:29] pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:35] Amen.
[45:37] God bless you. Thank you musicians.
[45:39] Amen. Let's look here in Ruth chapter 3.
[45:43] And uh
[45:50] I want to read if we could before seated
[45:53] just try to read down through verses 1
[45:55] through verse 9.
[45:59] And uh
[46:01] Lord willing we posted on there about
[46:03] the fireside fellowship. Um, so that'll
[46:07] be this evening at 6:30, Lord willing,
[46:10] if it doesn't rain. And, uh, I so
[46:13] appreciate the fellowship.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Um,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[46:17] One thing, one comment that was shared
[46:18] with me, a text from an individual is
[46:21] saying, you know, it's just
[46:23] it's just something that's very very
[46:25] precious where you you get to know
[46:27] people and you get to know that
[46:29] sometimes the things that you didn't
[46:31] know about them. And I'm not talking
[46:33] about bad, but I'm just certain things
[46:34] that it just encourages us encourages us
[46:38] along the way because we're not in this
[46:39] on our own,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; right? you know, when we get to heaven,
[46:42] we're not going to have, you know, well,
[46:44] you know, I I don't I'm just going to
[46:47] have my place way way way way way way
[46:50] out there. I'm going to be an offgrid
[46:53] living believer. That's good.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; No, but um we're going to be together
[47:00] &gt;&gt; and uh you know, even on there we we we
[47:04] will be rejoicing of God's grace that
[47:06] has brought us through. And to think
[47:08] even brother Bramman says we'll have the
[47:10] times to set around and the special
[47:12] singing that'll be done. My I mean we
[47:14] won't ever have to worry about work and
[47:16] all those other things right now. But
[47:18] I'll tell you what gives you and I the
[47:20] real strength to be able to face
[47:22] tomorrow to be able to face the things
[47:24] of life because life itself is there but
[47:27] God gives us grace and God will even
[47:29] move even through the times of
[47:31] fellowship. I I know for myself when I
[47:33] have I have felt really encouraged in my
[47:36] heart even at times and you know
[47:38] sometimes there's been situations where
[47:40] man I just didn't and I know we always
[47:43] have to take into account where we are
[47:44] with um you know our body and things
[47:47] like that and sometimes I've had to say
[47:49] no I can't do this as far as go to a a
[47:52] meeting I always try to do certain
[47:54] things to at least support it and but
[47:56] you know what I found is uh many times
[47:58] as I walk away not many times each times
[48:00] I walk away. I'm always saying, "God,
[48:02] I'm so glad that I went."
[48:04] &gt;&gt; And I know I know we have different
[48:05] ones, you know, um with uh traveling in
[48:08] and sometimes it makes it harder. And
[48:10] I'm I'm trying to look at that to make
[48:12] these times as far as the fireside
[48:15] fellowship more if we can even more
[48:17] accessible and maybe moving it to a
[48:19] different day and a different time. And
[48:22] uh I'm not doing things to load your
[48:24] schedule. I I want I want to encourage
[48:27] fellowship.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need fellowship.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] Re Ruth chapter 3
[48:37] verse one. Then Naomi her mother-in-law
[48:39] said unto her, "My daughter shall I not
[48:43] seek rest for thee, that it may be well
[48:46] with thee?"
[48:48] And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with
[48:52] whose maidens thou was? Behold, he went
[48:55] with barley tonight in the threshing
[48:57] floor. Wash thyself
[49:01] therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy
[49:03] raignment upon thee, and get thee down
[49:06] to the floor, but make not thyself known
[49:09] unto the man until he shall have done
[49:12] eating, eating, and drinking.
[49:15] And it shall be when he lith down, but
[49:18] thou shalt mark the place where he shall
[49:20] lie. and thou shalt go in and uncover
[49:23] his feet, and lay thee down, and he will
[49:26] tell thee what thou shalt do." And she
[49:30] said unto her, "All that thou sayest
[49:32] unto me, I will do." And she went down
[49:36] unto the floor, and did according to all
[49:39] that her mother-in-law bade her. Verse
[49:43] 7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk,
[49:47] and his heart was merry, he went to lie
[49:50] down at the end of the heap of corn. And
[49:52] she came softly and uncovered his feet
[49:55] and laid her down. And it came to pass
[49:58] at midnight that the man was afraid and
[50:01] turned himself. And behold, a woman lay
[50:04] at his feet. And he said, "Who art
[50:07] thou?" And she answered, "I am Ruth,
[50:10] thine handmmaid.
[50:11] Spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[50:14] handmmaid, for thou art a near kinsman.
[50:19] Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; I'd like to speak on the appeal to our
[50:23] kinsmen. Amen. Amen. God bless you as
[50:26] you're being seated.
[50:32] I pray that God would just give me grace
[50:34] to be able to deliver as he's
[50:38] pressed it upon my heart. But we see how
[50:41] that within this aspect in looking at
[50:44] Ruth being such a not just a a beautiful
[50:49] love story, but it's a much deeper
[50:51] meaning of of redemption. And all the
[50:55] way through the scriptures,
[50:57] the prophet would admonish us, if you've
[51:00] read through the Bible and you don't see
[51:02] Christ in every verse, then go back and
[51:05] read it again. and to understand that
[51:08] that that it's the book of redemption
[51:11] that all the way through the scriptures
[51:14] it's God showing through shadows and
[51:16] types and all that has been laid down of
[51:20] that his heart of redemption and we
[51:22] understand that that redemption is to
[51:26] bring back
[51:27] &gt;&gt; and I want to just look at this here
[51:30] this morning because this word appeal I
[51:32] know sometimes we hear this used in
[51:34] terms of a court case but that's not
[51:36] what
[51:37] is here this morning. This word appeal,
[51:39] it means it's a serious and urgent
[51:43] request.
[51:44] So there is in the appeal to our
[51:46] kinsmen. And I want you to think of this
[51:49] that this goal, the goal all along where
[51:52] Ruth herself, she is moved, I believe,
[51:56] by the spirit of God under an uncction
[51:58] to make the decision she makes there
[52:01] even in Ruth chapter 1. And then we see
[52:04] her laboring in Ruth chapter 2. I
[52:06] believe the Holy Spirit is right there
[52:08] working upon her life. And yet with all
[52:12] of the labors and things that she has
[52:14] done, the goal itself when Ruth comes to
[52:18] this place to appeal to Boaz as her as
[52:23] as her kinsman, as the kinsman there to
[52:26] the household and she makes the request
[52:29] that he would take her within marriage
[52:32] because of all that pertains to that.
[52:34] But the goal itself that Ruth had wasn't
[52:38] just to be married.
[52:41] No more than it was for tomorrow just to
[52:45] have an act.
[52:47] That was not the goal.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; But tomorrow was moved by the spirit of
[52:51] God. That there would be that of a of of
[52:54] life of that of of seed that would be
[52:57] raised up to the name of her husband. So
[53:00] the goal itself wasn't just to be
[53:02] married. This is this is redemption that
[53:05] was working upon Ruth's heart. And she's
[53:08] moved to ask Boaz to fulfill his right
[53:12] as a kinsman to IMC, Naomi's deceased
[53:15] husband, and calls his name and
[53:18] inheritance of that land that belonged
[53:20] to him to go on. And here we were, you
[53:24] and I, we were in the pawn shop of sin
[53:26] and sold into it by unbelief from the
[53:28] first couple, Adam and Eve. But God
[53:31] himself came down in order to redeem
[53:35] back to our lost estate of sons and
[53:38] daughters of God. We're potentially sons
[53:41] and daughters of God. But through the
[53:43] shedding of the blood and the Holy
[53:45] Spirit coming down to make that real and
[53:49] quicken that in our life, that's where
[53:51] it becomes a realization. And then
[53:53] that's where as sons and daughters of
[53:55] God, we begin to express that or is
[53:58] expressed through our lives. So the
[54:01] kinsman, it had to be one that was of a
[54:04] nearest kin. He had to be worthy. Had to
[54:07] be a worthy man, a man of honor, had to
[54:09] be financially able. And most
[54:12] importantly, he had to be willing to
[54:14] redeem the estate.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; She was near here. Ruth was moved. there
[54:20] was a a real love for that of of Naomi.
[54:24] And I want to just say it in this way
[54:26] when I start through this. There's some
[54:28] parts that when looking at this appeal,
[54:30] there's some parts that I want to just
[54:32] look at here this morning. And that is
[54:34] the right request. It starts here and
[54:37] looking at the right request being made.
[54:40] And that request that is made is where
[54:42] that Ruth herself, she presents herself
[54:46] to Boaz under the leadership and
[54:50] direction of Naomi. Naomi being that of
[54:53] a type of the word. She is given because
[54:57] the Holy Spirit is not going to lead us
[54:59] outside of the word. He always lead us
[55:02] in his word because the Holy Spirit is
[55:04] given to fulfill and confirm his word.
[55:08] And so the right request that is that is
[55:11] made in that time where she draws near
[55:15] to to to Boaz and she ask of him to uh
[55:19] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[55:22] handmmaid for thou art a near kinsman. I
[55:26] want to just say this to you that this
[55:28] itself must be the very desire. The
[55:32] request had to come from Ruth's heart.
[55:35] Hallelujah.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Boaz was a worthy, honorable, able man
[55:41] who was able to fulfill the work of the
[55:44] kinsman.
[55:46] But he could not and he would not force
[55:49] himself upon Ruth.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; It had to be her request, her leading.
[55:56] Yet like brother Brandon will tell us in
[55:58] one place in the message he says as and
[56:00] he'll take from that scripture where
[56:02] Boaz saw Ruth and oh he he wanted to
[56:04] marry her and and I want you to see it
[56:06] in this light that it's it's Christ
[56:08] himself his desire is to be united with
[56:13] us. That's what that's what the new
[56:15] birth is. It's where there is a real
[56:18] relationship, a a a uniting where all
[56:22] that has been lost is restored to where
[56:27] that it is it is no longer under our
[56:30] name, but it is the name of the Lord
[56:32] Jesus Christ that is on display and
[56:35] living throughout our lives. And so
[56:38] Boaz, he's not going to he's not los.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Right. We are from God's
[56:43] own loins. The prophet said, "We were in
[56:45] the loins
