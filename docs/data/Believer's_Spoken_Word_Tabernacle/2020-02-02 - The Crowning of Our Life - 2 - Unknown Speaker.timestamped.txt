[50:00] on into the word this morning so good to
[50:03] be here in it amen
[50:05] let's go to revelations chapter 1 and
[50:08] we're just gonna start reading right
[50:09] there and just ask the Lord that he
[50:11] would just help us and I heard some of
[50:14] the requests I know that we have been
[50:16] praying for different ones that have not
[50:19] been feeling well and we're battling
[50:20] those parts of sickness and things but
[50:24] just want to just say we want to just
[50:27] continue to hold each and every one of
[50:29] them up in prayer that are not that are
[50:31] not here that are not feeling well and
[50:34] we just so thankful to God for His mercy
[50:37] you know every time as we've been
[50:39] looking at a midweek service every time
[50:41] is God
[50:43] you know God will permit sickness to
[50:45] come but then through that right there
[50:47] he just makes known the earnest of the
[50:48] Resurrection as it moves over our life
[50:51] and he brings healing because there's no
[50:54] one that can reverse that you know
[50:56] medicine itself does not heal medicine
[51:01] only aids in the healing process
[51:06] revelations chapter 1 verse 4 and verse
[51:09] it through verse 6 John to the seven
[51:12] churches which are in Asia grace be unto
[51:15] you and peace from him which is and
[51:18] which was and which is to come and from
[51:21] the seven spirits which are before his
[51:24] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[51:27] faithful witness and the first begotten
[51:30] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[51:35] of the earth unto him that loved us
[51:41] in that just wonderful and this is what
[51:45] he his love was so great that he came
[51:47] down and washed us from our sins in his
[51:52] own blood
[51:52] he didn't just forgive us but he
[51:55] actually loosened us from that identity
[51:59] of that first nature that we were under
[52:01] he meant by the by the change aren't you
[52:05] grateful the Holy Ghost has made a way
[52:07] it loosens us from that old past and it
[52:11] ties us in to the word amen where there
[52:15] was a chasm in our life now there is one
[52:17] who has come to do away with the chasm
[52:19] in our life no longer a separation
[52:21] between us and God and washed us from
[52:24] our sins in his own blood and hath made
[52:28] us kings and priests unto God and his
[52:33] father to him be glory and Dominion
[52:36] forever and ever amen let's just bow our
[52:41] heads an order prayer if you have a need
[52:42] on your heart you want to be remembered
[52:44] just lift it up before the Lord right
[52:46] now and let's just go as a congregation
[52:50] of believers this morning
[52:51] let's go before the end the presence of
[52:54] God before the throne of God Heavenly
[52:57] Father Lord we come this morning Lord o
[53:01] God with the assurance of the blood that
[53:04] has went before his Lord and all God
[53:07] through the way that has been open to us
[53:10] Lord that was closed out from man and
[53:13] the only one that could make that way
[53:15] back into the holiest of Holies back to
[53:17] the Tree of Life oh God
[53:19] it had to be you to become one of us
[53:22] Lord and to lead and open up that way
[53:24] and father this morning there are needs
[53:27] upon hearts behind these hands this
[53:29] morning and father we realize oh god
[53:33] that Lord you're the answer you're the
[53:36] dissolver of every doubt and Lord for
[53:38] every question Lord and father for every
[53:41] need
[53:42] Lord we just commit that Lord into your
[53:45] hands this morning and we ask that God
[53:47] you'll take as a speaker and hear and
[53:49] God that you would move Lord soul
[53:52] upon every need Oh God and father in all
[53:56] things that you would receive glory to
[53:58] yourself Lord or father may you just
[54:00] continue to move among us now Lord in
[54:03] the service we pray God and just
[54:05] reconciling lo hearts Lord unto yourself
[54:09] o God we love you and thank you now
[54:12] father in the precious name of Jesus
[54:14] Christ amen
[54:15] and may God bless you being seated you
[54:20] know there's things that when we look at
[54:22] in the scripture we begin last week and
[54:25] looking at the crowning of our lives and
[54:27] I want to continue that thought but I
[54:30] want to look at that just a little bit
[54:33] more this morning in a fault of it
[54:36] because we've been coming out of that in
[54:38] numbers 15 we're still in there but just
[54:40] looking in some of the parts to realize
[54:43] that where we are at and what God has
[54:46] called us to and we see within the
[54:49] scriptures here such a beautiful reality
[54:52] where it says he hath made us he hath
[54:55] made us not we have made ourselves the
[54:58] gospel is not a self-help program the
[55:01] gospel is not a Reformation but the
[55:03] gospel brings transformation and he the
[55:07] Bible as it says he hath made us it is
[55:10] salvation is completely the doing of the
[55:12] Lord the Bible says salvation is of the
[55:15] Lord it's all of grace he has redeemed
[55:17] us for his purpose and here is the
[55:20] aspect that I want to deal with here
[55:22] this morning is in that first part he
[55:25] hath made us kings because we are kings
[55:28] spiritual kings right now we're going to
[55:32] be Kings upon the earth in that of the
[55:35] Millennium after here the rapture and
[55:37] after the tribulation after Armageddon
[55:39] and after all that is set forth there we
[55:42] are going to rule and reign with him
[55:45] here upon this earth for a thousand
[55:47] years and then we know that leads in the
[55:49] future home but yet here is the promise
[55:52] right now that in itself is the is the
[55:55] very key right now we are kings and
[55:59] spiritual kings and we're going to be
[56:01] Kings upon the earth
[56:02] him when he sets on his throne but now
[56:06] we are spiritual kings and we are
[56:08] reigning over a spiritual Kingdom
[56:11] right now we are reigning with Christ we
[56:15] have dominion over sin over the world
[56:19] over the devil over the flesh amen its
[56:23] Christ himself and through that reigning
[56:26] in our life it declares to him it shows
[56:29] forth his praise and glory it is
[56:32] actually Almighty God showing forth his
[56:36] own glory his own victory through our
[56:38] life to think of it in this respect that
[56:40] the sin that once ruled you you now rule
[56:45] it this is what the power that is within
[56:50] the blood of Jesus Christ where the holy
[56:53] spirit can move into alive and become
[56:56] seated in the in throne in the throne of
[56:59] our heart in power it's no longer it's
[57:02] no longer our strength our might but now
[57:06] it is his strenght working through us
[57:08] you know the Bible would say it over
[57:11] even in the revelations chapter 15 it
[57:14] would speak of even those who overcome
[57:16] there at the end of the tribulation and
[57:19] throughout they would say and they sing
[57:21] the song of Moses the servant of God and
[57:24] the song of the lamb saying great and
[57:26] marvellous are thy works Lord God
[57:29] Almighty just and true are thy way are
[57:32] thy ways thou king of saints he is the
[57:37] coming king of this earth remember the
[57:40] world itself think of it now as we've
[57:43] looked at this many times the earth is
[57:46] not the world the world is the system
[57:49] that's upon the earth the Bible would
[57:52] say the kingdoms of this world to think
[57:56] of it that is just like with in your
[57:58] life and in my life that once the Spirit
[58:01] of God as it moves into alive it
[58:04] overthrows that administration that swea
[58:07] that hold that was upon our life we were
[58:11] under that influence the Bible says in
[58:13] Ephesians 2
[58:14] we walked according to the prints and
[58:16] power of the air we were dead in sin and
[58:19] trespasses you understand what I'm
[58:21] saying
[58:21] but now the Spirit of God has come to
[58:24] quicken it raises up that seed of that
[58:27] life on the inside we are no longer
[58:29] under the Dominion of the darkness of
[58:32] this world but by the Spirit of God we
[58:35] have been delivered and translated into
[58:38] the kingdom of his dear son so he is the
[58:42] king the coming king of this earth and
[58:44] he is our king he is the king of saints
[58:47] right now it's a spiritual Kingdom and
[58:50] how Dominion right now is the Dominion
[58:53] over sin and it is in force through the
[58:57] power that is in the Spirit of Christ
[58:59] that indwells us one thing that I want
[59:02] you just just to notice as we look at
[59:04] here very briefly I want you to notice
[59:07] how the scripture is wrote there he hath
[59:09] made us kings and priests it does not
[59:13] say he had made us priests and kings
[59:15] because you first of all must come under
[59:18] the blood and in the authority by the
[59:22] Holy Spirit to wear that in your life
[59:24] there comes the ruling authority of the
[59:27] Holy Ghost that empowers you and I as a
[59:30] son and daughter of God and then through
[59:32] that life within us we can truly operate
[59:35] as priests of God so to think of it we
[59:39] are we are already a son and daughter of
[59:42] God but what the Holy Ghost does it
[59:44] comes to release the authority of
[59:46] sonship in our life so it's no longer
[59:49] your word but it's God's Word it's God
[59:53] speaking the word through you it's God
[59:56] backing up that word behind what is
[59:59] being spoken amen so it is the authority
[1:00:03] of his life living in us now as Kings we
[1:00:07] are reigning with our King in his domain
[1:00:09] over the devil over sin over the world
[1:00:12] and over the flesh we are living in him
[1:00:15] above sin through the consecration of
[1:00:17] his life in us we are ministering unto
[1:00:21] him as his chosen bride like those
[1:00:24] faithful Gentile lawyers that reckon
[1:00:28] David as the king who was coming into
[1:00:30] power there's something about it that
[1:00:33] they began to recognize that David was
[1:00:36] anointed king and they recognized David
[1:00:40] is coming into power I want you to think
[1:00:43] of this here he had already been
[1:00:44] anointed by the word of the Lord has the
[1:00:47] anointing oil was poured out upon his
[1:00:50] head from the Horn of the RAM that was
[1:00:52] held in the hand of the prophet that
[1:00:54] brought the word of the Lord to him
[1:00:56] personally Amen you recall in the
[1:00:59] scriptures where it speaks of David and
[1:01:01] his member with that of Saul when saw
[1:01:04] himself he you know many times Saul
[1:01:07] would come under situations and they
[1:01:10] would be pressure that was around him
[1:01:12] and so would act out according to his
[1:01:15] own self will saw had never received the
[1:01:19] overcoming of his own self will reign
[1:01:24] with me now we've all made mistakes but
[1:01:26] the reality is is that when there is
[1:01:28] that overcoming power within you and I
[1:01:31] there is the reality that as we yield to
[1:01:33] that the greater is He that is in you
[1:01:36] and I then is greater than he that's in
[1:01:38] the world there isn't over coming to our
[1:01:41] life Oh glory be to God you recall that
[1:01:44] what God spoke to Saul he said he has
[1:01:47] ripped the kingdom from you and given it
[1:01:51] to a neighbor one that was very close
[1:01:55] but it was in that of the closeness I
[1:01:58] want you to think of this that Saul
[1:02:00] himself was still holding the title of
[1:02:03] King listen to me now he was still
[1:02:06] holding the title of King he was still
[1:02:09] you know holding that a position he
[1:02:12] could operate and say go here go there
[1:02:14] he could send that word and this would
[1:02:16] this was taking place and that was
[1:02:18] taking place but the reality is that the
[1:02:21] kingdom had already departed from Saul's
[1:02:25] life now the kingdom and it departed
[1:02:29] even though he can say I'm still over
[1:02:31] all Israel but the kingdom is not that
[1:02:34] of an earthly domain it's not of houses
[1:02:36] it's not of people but the kingdom is
[1:02:39] the person of Jesus Christ for has he
[1:02:43] stood up and said the strength of Israel
[1:02:45] will not lie the strength of Israel was
[1:02:49] not in a man who was head and shoulders
[1:02:51] above all the rest
[1:02:53] and who looked like other kings and
[1:02:55] maybe he could handle a sword that was
[1:02:57] not the strength but the strength of
[1:02:59] Israel was in the Living God that was
[1:03:02] there to back up his word as his
[1:03:04] children would stand there upon the
[1:03:06] ladder fortified that's the real kingdom
[1:03:08] of God so we see that it is the anointed
[1:03:12] where the person of Jesus Christ is the
[1:03:15] kingdom in John 18:36 jesus answered and
[1:03:19] he said My Kingdom is not of this world
[1:03:22] here he is standing in pilots Jasmine
[1:03:24] Hall My Kingdom is not of this world if
[1:03:27] my kingdom were of this world then would
[1:03:31] my servants fight what do you think
[1:03:34] about this Jesus is letting it be known
[1:03:37] that if this was my kingdom then my
[1:03:39] servants my subjects would fight for
[1:03:42] this in order for it to be maintained
[1:03:45] but his kingdom was not of this world
[1:03:48] there had to be a price that was paid in
[1:03:52] order to purchase back and to bring what
[1:03:56] was lost through it at homei from the
[1:03:58] very beginning remember when the fall
[1:04:01] took place in Eden in the fall that took
[1:04:04] place remember here was man and now
[1:04:06] after the fall has taken place but title
[1:04:09] deed it goes back into the hand of the
[1:04:11] original one the only way that that
[1:04:14] title deed can come back where in that
[1:04:16] the earth itself is there is established
[1:04:19] or restored under its rightful position
[1:04:21] under that of sons and daughters of God
[1:04:24] there must come the Son of God that is
[1:04:27] able to pay the price and restore it
[1:04:30] back to its original position but before
[1:04:32] the earth can never come back to its
[1:04:34] original glory and its original position
[1:04:37] there's got to be sentence and daughters
[1:04:39] of God that are anointed to rule and
[1:04:42] reign on this of the earth they've got
[1:04:45] to come back to that position I say the
[1:04:47] earth is groaning and travailing for the
[1:04:50] matter
[1:04:51] station of the sons and daughters of God
[1:04:54] they met my kingdom it's not of this
[1:04:57] world we give the world their police
[1:05:03] they've got their position not in here
[1:05:06] but as you know they've got their place
[1:05:08] they've got their position they've only
[1:05:10] there's only a short amount of time you
[1:05:14] understand what I'm saying
[1:05:16] why lives are not occupied with walking
[1:05:19] around with picket signs and we're going
[1:05:21] to make this world a better place you
[1:05:23] are not going to make this world a
[1:05:24] better place
[1:05:25] this world already has a sentence of
[1:05:28] judgment upon it are you with me even
[1:05:32] when you read in the Book of Jeremiah
[1:05:34] and through the prophets God never
[1:05:36] spelled it's from it spared Israel even
[1:05:38] though Israel was his chosen people but
[1:05:41] God let him know I will pour out my
[1:05:44] wrath and my theory because they have
[1:05:46] rejected me and God Himself I'm telling
[1:05:50] you it's coming here very shortly we're
[1:05:52] already seeing the outpouring of the
[1:05:55] wrath of God look in this hour the Bible
[1:05:58] says in the times of Noah that the
[1:06:00] people themselves it was a spirit of
[1:06:03] destruction that was upon the land we
[1:06:06] see the spirit of destruction not out
[1:06:08] just out there but you see it even in
[1:06:10] people that walk away from this revealed
[1:06:12] truth the spirit of destruction is upon
[1:06:15] them it's a satanic anointing to try and
[1:06:19] destroy but let me tell you something
[1:06:21] you're fighting against God you'll never
[1:06:23] overthrow the kingdom of Almighty God
[1:06:29] glory be to God that I should not be
[1:06:32] delivered to the Jews but now is my
[1:06:36] kingdom not from his plan are therefore
[1:06:38] said unto Him art our kingdom jesus
[1:06:42] answered thou sayest that I'm a king to
[1:06:46] this end was I born and for this cause
[1:06:48] came I into the world that I should bear
[1:06:50] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[1:06:52] of the truth heareth my voice now Pilate
[1:06:55] could say he was a king but did it have
[1:06:57] any effect on his life no it's just like
[1:07:00] many can say that he's their king they
[1:07:03] can say well Jesus is Mike
[1:07:05] is it is it just saying it that makes
[1:07:07] him your king or is it that there must
[1:07:10] come the enthronement that will reflect
[1:07:12] the Kingdom that you are a part of it
[1:07:16] must be the king himself you and I
[1:07:19] cannot join this kingdom we cannot come
[1:07:21] into this kingdom of our own accord
[1:07:23] we must be pawn first Corinthians 12 we
[1:07:26] are baptized by one spirit into one
[1:07:29] Kingdom one body that of the word the
[1:07:32] Living God and mana to where the king
[1:07:35] itself is reflected through our life
[1:07:37] because the Bible says no man call his
[1:07:40] him lord but by the holy ghost amen the
[1:07:44] witness of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:07:45] person's life said indeed I have been
[1:07:48] loosed from sin I know I know I have
[1:07:51] been set free are you with me because
[1:07:55] from within you know that there is a
[1:07:57] loosening the desires of the things of
[1:08:01] the world have thread from your life and
[1:08:04] Christ is everything to you
[1:08:08] Oh mommy I think you're a little bit
[1:08:12] radnik radical it's just because you're
[1:08:14] not in this kingdom
[1:08:15] if you is in this kingdom and you've
[1:08:17] seen there what the reality of it but
[1:08:19] you see nobody can see the kingdom of
[1:08:20] God understand it unless they are born
[1:08:23] again you've got to have a new birth or
[1:08:26] else you'll place it out here that the
[1:08:28] kingdom of God is the socialization of
[1:08:30] people you'll put it out here that the
[1:08:32] kingdom of God is a group of people
[1:08:34] you'll put it out there that the team of
[1:08:35] God is programs Creed's dogmas and
[1:08:38] everything else but the kingdom of God
[1:08:39] is none of those things the kingdom of
[1:08:42] God is the person of Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] Almighty God the deity of Almighty God
[1:08:47] setting forth within our lives him and
[1:08:51] that's the kingdom notice in John 17:20
[1:08:54] and when he was demanded of the
[1:08:56] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[1:08:59] come he answered them and said the
[1:09:01] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:09:05] observation
[1:09:06] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[1:09:09] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[1:09:12] within you
[1:09:13] now remember the kingdom of heaven is to
[1:09:16] be set up here upon the earth but that
[1:09:19] part of the kingdom of heaven is goes
[1:09:20] first by that of the kingdom of God
[1:09:22] which is the Holy Spirit the Word made
[1:09:25] flesh in you it cometh not with
[1:09:29] observation oh my to think about it
[1:09:32] through the preaching of the word and it
[1:09:34] can happen while the words being
[1:09:35] preached it doesn't have to be in some
[1:09:37] certain location it deals with the
[1:09:39] condition of the heart where the Holy
[1:09:41] Spirit Himself is able to draw a life to
[1:09:44] complete surrender to say I no longer
[1:09:47] want my own way I matter of fact if I
[1:09:50] could say it like this I'm tired of
[1:09:52] being Samuel I really want to be changed
[1:09:54] you come to a place like Jacob came to
[1:09:57] Jacob said I'm sick of me and Jacob and
[1:10:00] you know it was that was exactly what
[1:10:02] God's desire was for his life because
[1:10:05] God wanted to release that mystery of
[1:10:07] the Israel that was tucked down in there
[1:10:10] in seed form Oh glory now notice how
[1:10:14] Paul would go on to express this in
[1:10:15] first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 for
[1:10:18] the kingdom of God is not in word but in
[1:10:24] power remember what Paul is dealing with
[1:10:26] here he's got opposition that's coming
[1:10:28] along and different ones are puffed up
[1:10:30] and they're saying all these words and
[1:10:31] Paul lets a know that your words mean
[1:10:34] nothing it's what is behind it the words
[1:10:37] themselves that in itself is not the
[1:10:39] kingdom of God but the kingdom of God is
[1:10:41] the power that makes the word alive Oh
[1:10:46] glory be to God for our authority our
[1:10:49] authority in this hour is under the
[1:10:52] message and the messenger that's where
[1:10:55] our authority comes from it comes from
[1:10:56] the word by the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:00] Ghost in Hebrews 12 27 and this word yet
[1:11:04] once more signifying the removing of
[1:11:07] those things which are shaken as of
[1:11:09] things that are made that those things
[1:11:11] which cannot be shaken may remain
[1:11:14] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[1:11:18] cannot be moved
[1:11:21] certainly not a kingdom of this world
[1:11:23] this is not a kingdom that has within it
[1:11:27] the strengths or efforts of a man this
[1:11:30] kingdom is not set up nor established by
[1:11:32] that of a man this is the kingdom of
[1:11:35] Almighty God this is the kingdom that
[1:11:37] God has set forth that he had within his
[1:11:40] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:11:42] and he would unfold this kingdom to you
[1:11:45] and I in our hearts notice wherefore we
[1:11:47] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:11:50] moved let us have grace whereby we may
[1:11:54] serve God except ibly with reverence and
[1:11:56] godly fear is that not our desire when
[1:11:59] the kingdom of God this is really in
[1:12:00] another part of that of priesthood that
[1:12:02] moves into our lives but the first part
[1:12:05] is that a kingship of where it moves
[1:12:07] into our life in a ruling and reigning
[1:12:08] or over that of sin the world Dominion
[1:12:11] of flesh and so forth but now our desire
[1:12:14] is Lord I want to please you this is
[1:12:16] where the last part of that verse comes
[1:12:18] in once we have been birthed into that
[1:12:20] Kingdom the full desire of our hearts is
[1:12:23] to please him as a matter of fact
[1:12:24] through every day of our life every
[1:12:26] moment there is a tension that is about
[1:12:28] our life and that tension is a great
[1:12:30] blessing and the tension is is my life
[1:12:33] pleasing to you lord
[1:12:37] how could we ask that because by the
[1:12:40] birth of the Holy Spirit through the
[1:12:42] revealing of the word it brings us back
[1:12:44] into the place we no longer want our own
[1:12:46] choice we do not trust our senses we do
[1:12:49] not trust our mind we do not trust our
[1:12:51] flesh we only trust thus saith the Lord
[1:12:54] because we have the witness in our life
[1:12:57] what it has done in us and is doing
[1:13:00] through us this is our only trust glory
[1:13:05] be to God for our God is a consuming
[1:13:08] fire not to think of it that their
[1:13:11] various if there is the contest or
[1:13:14] contests that its own it will always
[1:13:16] this kingdom moving into alive this
[1:13:18] kingdom has been contested it will
[1:13:20] continue to be contested
[1:13:22] remember what Jesus said when he spoke
[1:13:24] there in Matthew 16:18 he said upon this
[1:13:28] rock I will build my church he did not
[1:13:31] build it upon a man
[1:13:35] he didn't build it there upon the church
[1:13:37] upon a creed upon a doctrine he builded
[1:13:41] upon the revelation of who he is
[1:13:47] no repeater God and he said the gates of
[1:13:50] Hell shall not prevail against you it
[1:14:01] shows hell would be and hell is still
[1:14:05] against this revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:11] it's that which is contested that's why
[1:14:16] we must have the Word of God may power
[1:14:19] in our lives
[1:14:21] because when the word has made power in
[1:14:23] our life it's like a tug-of-war
[1:14:26] are you with me it's like a tug of war
[1:14:29] when the word has made power in our life
[1:14:32] it is the strength of that word in our
[1:14:36] life to wear when the enemy comes to
[1:14:38] contest that revelation this guy feels
[1:14:41] it our spirit feels it but what's he
[1:14:43] contesting he's contesting to see where
[1:14:46] is that word position in your life
[1:14:49] that's why he came to the Lord Jesus he
[1:14:52] came to contest and see where is that
[1:14:55] word position in his life you don't have
[1:14:57] to be a great big strong muscular person
[1:14:59] and let me just put it this way you
[1:15:01] don't have to be a great big strong
[1:15:03] muscular person you can quote this and
[1:15:05] finish this and finish that remember
[1:15:07] that's not what it was when Jesus said
[1:15:09] it is written it was at that moment that
[1:15:11] the Spirit of God that had quickened a
[1:15:13] word to his life it was in those moments
[1:15:16] of temptation that the word come to
[1:15:19] address the situation that was present
[1:15:22] in his life it was not by his
[1:15:24] supernatural power that he defeated the
[1:15:26] enemy remember it was the power dwelling
[1:15:29] within that could take the word and
[1:15:31] Jesus in his weakest moment maybe you
[1:15:34] know it took him a minute to get out
[1:15:36] that statement he wasn't standing there
[1:15:38] saying glory to God in the name of you
[1:15:41] know and going through him know he won
[1:15:42] doing that maybe it was just it is it is
[1:15:46] written his weakness within his flesh
[1:15:50] from being hunger had nothing to do with
[1:15:53] casting out the devil it is the
[1:15:57] authority of the word in your life that
[1:16:00] backs the devil up lets you and I know
[1:16:03] that the weakest Christian when the
[1:16:06] weakest Christian goes to his knees
[1:16:08] when the weakest Christian will stand on
[1:16:10] that saith the Lord and everything
[1:16:13] surrounding is against it Satan must
[1:16:16] recognize the authority the badge of
[1:16:19] believer our day that is coming into
[1:16:25] power in Psalms 18 verse 29 notice this
[1:16:30] this particular Psalm it breaks over
[1:16:32] many of the Psalms
[1:16:34] you'll recognize how they will break
[1:16:35] over into that of even the Messianic
[1:16:38] Empire even a
[1:16:39] that of the Advent the first coming of
[1:16:40] the Lord Jesus and carry Claire on over
[1:16:43] into that of the millennium in future
[1:16:44] hope in Psalms 1829 here is David's
[1:16:48] testimony for baazi I have run through a
[1:16:52] troop and by my god have I lived over a
[1:16:56] wall did David have all positions sure
[1:17:00] he did was everybody for David no matter
[1:17:04] of fact saul was trying to kill him but
[1:17:08] it wasn't saul david recognized it was a
[1:17:10] spirit what character David was able to
[1:17:16] stand there this was not David's DNA
[1:17:18] this was the spiritual revealed truth
[1:17:22] there was some molded David's character
[1:17:24] - David though they would tried to pull
[1:17:27] him in realms of the flesh in order to
[1:17:30] try to fight this battle remember Joe
[1:17:32] have when they caught Saul in a cage he
[1:17:35] said hey buddy here's your chance man
[1:17:36] you can do him in right here but David
[1:17:39] remember David is one a character that
[1:17:41] will honor the word even in situations
[1:17:44] where things are all David would not
[1:17:47] allow there to be license for him glory
[1:17:50] to God license for him to act outside of
[1:17:54] the character of the word why it is a
[1:17:56] character that is coming into power who
[1:18:01] may god help us but our characters can
[1:18:05] be so molded and shaped by his spirit
[1:18:10] verse 30 asks for God his way is perfect
[1:18:14] the word of the Lord has tried he is a
[1:18:17] buckler to all those that trust in him
[1:18:20] for who is God save the Lord or who is a
[1:18:24] rock save our God is it is God that
[1:18:28] girded me with strength and maketh my
[1:18:32] way perfect over there and it sounds
[1:18:34] like he's bragging on God a lot this guy
[1:18:36] you sure this is the king this sounds
[1:18:38] like a weakling no it'll sound like a
[1:18:40] weak knee you're just looking at it
[1:18:41] through the eyes of the world what David
[1:18:43] is recognized I am King by the authority
[1:18:46] of the kingdom of the strength of Israel
[1:18:48] that is backing up the word
[1:18:50] you will hold my when Samuel was there
[1:18:53] with the horn of the RAM you realize
[1:18:54] when Samuel was pouring out the
[1:18:56] anointing oil you realize what that
[1:18:58] anointing oil oil represented it was the
[1:19:00] world that God had spoke and released a
[1:19:03] Samuel that I have chosen me a king this
[1:19:07] is not a man-made choice the people
[1:19:10] chose Saul but my choice I want you to
[1:19:13] go and anoint them the anointing of the
[1:19:16] humble oil was that of the word breaking
[1:19:20] upon David's life it was bringing David
[1:19:23] into position of what God was anointing
[1:19:27] and what God had intended for his life
[1:19:30] that's why the real anointing of the
[1:19:32] Holy Ghost when it moves down upon the
[1:19:35] soul in the life it brings you and I in
[1:19:38] line with the word because it is the
[1:19:40] Spirit of Truth that positions us in
[1:19:43] Jesus Christ that's why the bride is not
[1:19:47] just under an anointing hallelujah we're
[1:19:55] not being taken back to feelings nothing
[1:19:58] against the feelings but it's what does
[1:20:01] the life do after that there might be
[1:20:05] feelings but remember God has already
[1:20:08] come in this hour
[1:20:09] the Holy Spirit Saru Bible has brought
[1:20:12] the plumb line of the word so that
[1:20:14] Jerusalem come on now we are to be
[1:20:17] inhabited as the temple of Almighty God
[1:20:19] the plumb line itself had to be laid out
[1:20:22] in order that God might inhabit our
[1:20:25] lives or glory be to God it is God that
[1:20:29] Gerdes me with strength and maketh my
[1:20:34] way perfect
[1:20:35] they just said his ways perfect but then
[1:20:38] he lets us know he makes my way
[1:20:40] perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds
[1:20:46] feet like a deer
[1:20:52] like a deer there's times you need to
[1:20:55] escape and there's times you also you
[1:20:57] need to move come on now you need to
[1:20:59] have Liberty to move glory and setteth
[1:21:04] me upon high places heavenly places in
[1:21:07] Christ this is what he does he says he
[1:21:10] teaches my hands to war so that a bow of
[1:21:14] steel is broken by mine arms now this
[1:21:19] very thing right here would seem like
[1:21:20] you know he's not out there - strongman
[1:21:22] competition and you know trying to you
[1:21:23] know do all these things know the bowl
[1:21:25] of Steel this was all representative of
[1:21:27] when there would be an opposing army
[1:21:29] getting ready to come against another
[1:21:31] one when this very thing was sent in it
[1:21:33] was bent it was sent in there to the
[1:21:37] city they were getting ready to come
[1:21:38] against what they sent in was a
[1:21:40] representation of the strength and force
[1:21:42] that's coming your way
[1:21:45] amen who is behind us God is behind us
[1:21:50] glory thou has also given me the shield
[1:21:54] of thy salvation and thy right hand have
[1:21:58] holding me up and that gentleness hath
[1:22:01] made me great thou has enlarged my steps
[1:22:04] under me that my feet did not slip look
[1:22:08] at this in verse 37 I have pursued mine
[1:22:11] enemies this will not only pertain to
[1:22:13] David but it also breaks over
[1:22:15] in pertaining to our Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:22:17] have pursued my enemies and overtaken
[1:22:20] them neither did I turn again till they
[1:22:23] were consumed I have wounded them that
[1:22:26] they were not able to rise they are
[1:22:28] fallen under my feet has he not put
[1:22:32] everything under his feet for thou hast
[1:22:35] hurted me with strength unto the battle
[1:22:39] thou hath subdued under me those that
[1:22:42] rise up against me how David is coming
[1:22:46] into power the Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:22:49] 2 he says for it became him for whom are
[1:22:52] all things and by whom are all things in
[1:22:55] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:22:59] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:23:01] through sufferings and this is one thing
[1:23:04] that I love we could just
[1:23:06] preach on this a while but you know when
[1:23:07] you read through the Book of Psalms you
[1:23:09] find something about David you never
[1:23:11] find about Saul so never proclaims that
[1:23:15] God is his king you never find Saul
[1:23:18] worshiping that way but you find David
[1:23:20] over and over in the Psalms well David's
[1:23:23] a God is my king he is the king of this
[1:23:27] king he is the ruler of this ruler David
[1:23:31] knew his position his authority terrain
[1:23:34] was under the world you never find that
[1:23:39] we saw but with David you find one who
[1:23:42] is in position he realized brother Doug
[1:23:45] that his authority his power it came
[1:23:48] from the king himself glory be to God I
[1:23:52] want you to think about it the Bible
[1:23:55] says when they were leading away our
[1:23:57] Lord Jesus to Calvary he says and they
[1:24:00] made they made man made a crown of
[1:24:05] thorns there's a lot of a group you type
[1:24:09] here when you go back into the
[1:24:10] tabernacle and you think of the mercy
[1:24:12] seat and things but let me just move
[1:24:13] ahead with this they man made gave him a
[1:24:16] crown of thorns and as that right they
[1:24:19] put that crown of thorns upon his head
[1:24:22] blood was coming down and as he walked
[1:24:25] to Calvary but for every son and
[1:24:27] daughter of God where he's already
[1:24:29] opened up the way and he brings you an
[1:24:31] eye unto glory
[1:24:33] brother Joey the prophet said it like
[1:24:34] this he said we we as sons and daughters
[1:24:37] of God when we've been reconciled
[1:24:39] through him by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:41] born of the Spirit of God he said we are
[1:24:44] taking off the crown of thorns from off
[1:24:46] of his head and he said he is crowned as
[1:24:50] king in our lives and our lives give him
[1:24:54] his rightful position of praise of glory
[1:24:58] of honor of adoration Oh hallelujah
[1:25:05] revelations 3 verse 11 behold here's to
[1:25:11] the Philadelphian age behold I come
[1:25:15] quickly
[1:25:16] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[1:25:23] man take thy crown now we realize that
[1:25:28] for this admonition remembered the
[1:25:31] admonition given by the Spirit of God it
[1:25:33] would admonish the aged both groups
[1:25:36] would hear it true and false and God
[1:25:38] remember he would speak but it would be
[1:25:40] that of the true that they themselves
[1:25:41] will never ever come to see how close
[1:25:44] they can get to the world but their
[1:25:46] desire is to please the Lord if there
[1:25:48] happens to be something they would get a
[1:25:50] little cold the Spirit of God in that of
[1:25:52] holding true to his word is there to
[1:25:54] bring back that person back in line
[1:25:56] now I don't believe let me just say it
[1:25:58] very quickly I do not believe as a child
[1:26:00] of God as an elect seed of God that our
[1:26:02] lives are to be up and down up and down
[1:26:05] up and down I don't believe that at all
[1:26:07] I believe that our lives it isn't that
[1:26:09] everything is all the way up here and we
[1:26:11] never have any down times but what I am
[1:26:13] trying to say is I believe that there is
[1:26:15] victory that we have access to in our
[1:26:18] lives that we can actually live out in
[1:26:21] victory every day of our life even when
[1:26:25] there's discouragement even when there's
[1:26:27] disappointment even when there's
[1:26:28] sickness even when there's trouble I
[1:26:31] believe with all of my heart that this
[1:26:33] is the victory that the Lord Jesus has
[1:26:36] provided for us because he said my peace
[1:26:38] I leave with you sometimes we just need
[1:26:43] our eyes renewed in order to be able to
[1:26:45] look at things in the right way and the
[1:26:47] Lord helps us is that right now notice
[1:26:50] this brethren would pick this up here
[1:26:52] and he would say we don't need to
[1:26:53] comment on the thought that he is coming
[1:26:55] quickly we know that he is because we
[1:26:57] are in the end of the last days he says
[1:27:01] but he goes on to say hold fast what you
[1:27:03] have that no man take your crown it is
[1:27:06] in the midst of the time of great
[1:27:08] trouble we we see that's prophesied all
[1:27:10] the way through it's in the midst of the
[1:27:12] time of great trouble that Jesus comes
[1:27:14] and with his coming there is a
[1:27:16] resurrection many are to come forth out
[1:27:19] of the dust and rise with those who are
[1:27:21] alive but waiting for his return and the
[1:27:25] we'll be given crowns why because they
[1:27:30] are sons of God they are kings with him
[1:27:35] they are reigning with him that is what
[1:27:38] the crown signifies reigning and ruling
[1:27:41] with the great king himself so right now
[1:27:44] we are ruling and reigning with the
[1:27:47] crown of the Holy Ghost upon our life
[1:27:49] and that crown of the Holy Ghost upon a
[1:27:51] live moving within our life it's moving
[1:27:54] us for the awaiting of that crown what
[1:27:56] is that crown we're talking about that
[1:27:58] of a new body
[1:27:59] that's a crowning of it it's God's
[1:28:02] crowning achievement now notice this he
[1:28:04] says this is the promise for all those
[1:28:06] who suffer with him here on earth all
[1:28:09] those who endured patiently knowing that
[1:28:12] God the just judge would reward them
[1:28:14] they look at the qualities they who gave
[1:28:17] up all for him and committed all to him
[1:28:21] will sit down in his throne and share in
[1:28:25] his glorious Kingdom what you and I have
[1:28:30] had to give up you know what I don't
[1:28:32] miss it wonder what he did for me I
[1:28:37] don't miss it at all I'm not looking
[1:28:41] that hole he had to take this not you
[1:28:43] know why why are you not because the
[1:28:44] love of it's going I don't love it no
[1:28:48] more I'm not fighting oh my oh I don't
[1:28:50] want it listening no longer the fight
[1:28:52] the fight you see this is why you've got
[1:28:55] to get the battle on the inside you've
[1:28:57] got to get the soldier down they're not
[1:29:01] just here but down there that's the
[1:29:04] kingdom behind glory be to God it's a no
[1:29:08] comparison well you and I have had to
[1:29:09] give up no comparison to what awaits you
[1:29:12] and I and not just what awaits you and I
[1:29:14] it's joy right now it's wonderful right
[1:29:19] now they serve the Lord I only wish I
[1:29:23] only wish he'd got a hold of my life
[1:29:24] sooner find the reason he didn't because
[1:29:27] my old stubborn rock head and my old
[1:29:29] stubborn will while I could do it and I
[1:29:31] would try to do with this and I'll try
[1:29:33] to do with that but eventually God let
[1:29:34] it run to the end of its course and say
[1:29:36] are you fear are you tired of trying
[1:29:39] are you trying to tired of trying to do
[1:29:40] it finally you know God let you do that
[1:29:42] you say what's that lock it's like you
[1:29:44] right now if I tried to sign you up
[1:29:46] to swim from Lake Erie and swim out
[1:29:48] there to the lighthouse
[1:29:50] there might be something said man I'm
[1:29:52] feeling pretty good in mana I've got
[1:29:53] pretty good lungs and I got pretty good
[1:29:55] at this and you get out there in the
[1:29:56] middle of Lake your look comes with me
[1:30:00] you know what eventually and what
[1:30:01] happens there's somebody that can help
[1:30:03] you already but you've got to get out
[1:30:05] there too you finally get tired and when
[1:30:08] you finally get tired and say Lord I'm
[1:30:10] tired of trying I need help and God says
[1:30:17] that's just why waiting long that's a
[1:30:27] little bit on that one
[1:30:31] hallelujah now watch this and we have a
[1:30:35] word for us all at this time see we
[1:30:39] realize that these writings when it says
[1:30:42] to the churches in Asia we realize that
[1:30:44] these churches were have held
[1:30:47] characteristic of a actual ages they
[1:30:50] were churches but they held
[1:30:51] characteristics that would be distinct
[1:30:54] to a time of where Christ would be
[1:30:57] calling out a Gentile bride is that
[1:31:00] right now notice there is a word so all
[1:31:02] of this would pertain even to our lives
[1:31:05] right now not just to the Philadelphian
[1:31:07] age we have a word for us in this time
[1:31:09] look at this admonition here this
[1:31:10] morning then he says it is hold fast
[1:31:15] persevere woo we've got a persevere that
[1:31:20] means there's going to be opposition
[1:31:24] means you're going to have to fight but
[1:31:28] it's just how you're looking at the
[1:31:29] fight are you with notice don't give up
[1:31:36] put on the whole armor of God use every
[1:31:42] weapon he has given you use every gift
[1:31:46] at our disposal and look ahead with joy
[1:31:51] because we are going to be crowned by
[1:31:53] him who is the king of kings and the
[1:31:56] Lord of lords now you realize that here
[1:31:59] we are in this time the Bible it's rare
[1:32:00] out of it in in Daniel chapter 12 the
[1:32:03] Prophet would take it as a text and when
[1:32:05] he preaches the greatest valour fought
[1:32:06] because we realize that we are at the
[1:32:08] ending of time the blending in of
[1:32:10] eternity we know that very soon very
[1:32:12] very quickly that the gospel itself will
[1:32:14] turn to that of the Jews the Gentile
[1:32:16] bride will be called away in rapture we
[1:32:19] realize that within our lives right now
[1:32:21] there is a heading up there is a battle
[1:32:23] that is taking place the battle that God
[1:32:26] already knew that would come down in
[1:32:28] this hour the battle that you and I are
[1:32:30] facing in this hour is a battle that's
[1:32:32] very similar to what will take place
[1:32:33] with Israel where all nations and
[1:32:36] everything is going to come against
[1:32:37] Israel and Israel themselves will stand
[1:32:40] in that time and God will be their
[1:32:42] strength to stand with 144,000 now
[1:32:45] within the midst of this time an hour
[1:32:47] right here remember when the word itself
[1:32:49] has been opened up the Prophet picks it
[1:32:51] up in uniting time and sign he said by
[1:32:53] this revelation going forth it has now
[1:32:56] calls the churches to unite together
[1:32:58] against this revealed truth of this hour
[1:33:01] you see what it is it has it has brought
[1:33:04] that of a congealing of yeld even
[1:33:06] denominations that don't even agree they
[1:33:10] can't even agree on the tenets and
[1:33:12] creeds and dogmas but you know what it
[1:33:14] is it is a spiritual power at work in
[1:33:18] this earth that is bringing them in
[1:33:21] unity against the revealed word but
[1:33:24] let's look at it on the other side the
[1:33:26] Spirit of God is here it is loosed among
[1:33:29] the people of God it is loosening sin
[1:33:32] holds it's loosening Dominion it is
[1:33:35] uniting people of God with the promise
[1:33:38] in this hour this is the dispensation of
[1:33:41] the fullness of time where the Spirit of
[1:33:44] God is calling sons and daughters come
[1:33:47] home is
[1:33:48] time for rats huh it's time to go it's
[1:33:51] time to take our flights so this is
[1:33:58] where we are so thankful for a certain
[1:34:02] sound something that holds clarity and
[1:34:08] this is where the Prophet would pick it
[1:34:11] up
[1:34:11] he said prepare for the battle he said
[1:34:16] you say what battle the coming of
[1:34:21] prepare yourself not for the battle to
[1:34:25] battle against evil when evil is
[1:34:28] besetting the people on every hand
[1:34:31] everything's going on wrong home life
[1:34:34] you said D UN's failing nations are
[1:34:37] breaking up a you have to look very far
[1:34:41] this nation itself democracy's gone are
[1:34:47] you with me lord have mercy
[1:34:50] it's the truth yep well you know there's
[1:34:53] there's individuals and people that are
[1:34:55] all within there there's so much things
[1:34:57] has been shown with hypocrisy and
[1:34:58] whatever more not just this nation but
[1:35:00] every other nation because you want to
[1:35:02] know why the kingdoms of this world are
[1:35:04] under Satan's control he took the Lord
[1:35:07] Jesus up on the mountain in temptation
[1:35:09] and he showed him the kingdoms of this
[1:35:12] world
[1:35:12] he said if you only fall down and
[1:35:14] worship me I'll give you this kingdom
[1:35:16] but he said thou shalt worship the Lord
[1:35:18] God and him alone he was not going to
[1:35:21] bow down why cuz the promise is that the
[1:35:25] kingdoms belong to him and he would be
[1:35:27] able to lay claim and bring the kingdoms
[1:35:30] of this world these nations win that of
[1:35:34] after the rapture
[1:35:35] after that the visitation with Israel
[1:35:37] and Armageddon remember the nations of
[1:35:41] this world will come under the rule and
[1:35:44] domain of the king of kings
[1:35:47] is that right the Scriptures tell us
[1:35:50] that in Michael Zephaniah Zechariah
[1:35:52] there will be left over rim nets that
[1:35:56] will be brought forth
[1:35:59] oh that's a whole separate message in
[1:36:01] itself oh my what a battle he says now
[1:36:05] thinking of this atomic bombs are all
[1:36:07] around homes are splitting up
[1:36:09] motherhood's going low in morals among
[1:36:11] the people and distrust among one
[1:36:14] another all the denominations fussing
[1:36:17] and soon what should we do be certain
[1:36:19] and prepare yourself for the battle so
[1:36:25] prayer persevere
[1:36:25] hold fast put on the harm of God
[1:36:29] use every weapon that's giving you use
[1:36:34] every gift that's at your disposal and
[1:36:40] look up with joy
[1:36:46] let's move just a little bit more
[1:36:48] ephesians 16 finally my brethren be
[1:36:54] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:36:59] his might put on the whole armour of God
[1:37:04] that you might be able to stand against
[1:37:08] the wiles of the devil for we wrestle
[1:37:13] not against flesh and blood and we need
[1:37:20] to be reminded of that every once in a
[1:37:22] while
[1:37:24] we're not fighting against flesh and
[1:37:26] blood the battle is there to try to pull
[1:37:29] us out into those realms is that right
[1:37:32] try to pull us out but it's not the
[1:37:34] flesh and blood affair but against
[1:37:37] principalities against powers against
[1:37:40] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:37:43] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:37:46] places
[1:37:48] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:37:52] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:37:54] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:37:57] stand our armor is Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:04] when they when those when Devils see
[1:38:07] that full armour of God which is the
[1:38:09] true baptism of the Holy Ghost and they
[1:38:12] can see that it's coming straight from
[1:38:14] the throne of God from he who has risen
[1:38:18] and been raised up they are a witness
[1:38:21] they see not you it's the life that's
[1:38:24] backing you up
[1:38:25] [Applause]
[1:38:27] that's the armor of God amen because now
[1:38:31] God has sent the armor and here you and
[1:38:34] I are we're like the policeman the
[1:38:37] policeman can go out here and put his
[1:38:39] hand up why is that policeman standing
[1:38:42] at the intersection every once in a
[1:38:43] while the lights go out and you've got a
[1:38:45] policeman standing there they've got on
[1:38:46] you know the reflective vests and
[1:38:48] everything else and they're they're too
[1:38:49] cold hold off and they're to say hold
[1:38:51] their you can come this way of you you
[1:38:53] can go around this way and this this
[1:38:55] individual he's no match for the
[1:38:57] horse-powered you got our Neath your car
[1:38:58] I don't care if you've got one of them
[1:39:00] little smart cars that you can pick up
[1:39:01] and put in your back pocket he is no
[1:39:03] match for that car but you know what it
[1:39:06] is he's got a 40 because he has paid the
[1:39:10] price
[1:39:11] he's owned the fleet the police force he
[1:39:14] has been given a uniform he'd been given
[1:39:18] a badge he got a gun with more than one
[1:39:22] bullet not in his pocket it's loaded
[1:39:24] some of y'all get that one come on now
[1:39:28] and he has authority when he puts his
[1:39:33] hand up the cars got to stop you see
[1:39:37] when you put your hands up I want you to
[1:39:39] understand this this morning when you
[1:39:41] put your hands up when you say in your
[1:39:43] house devil this is enough I ain't going
[1:39:48] no further you know what it is the
[1:39:51] Prophet said with the whole armour of
[1:39:53] God you're on the police force and you
[1:39:55] are anointed to control with law and
[1:39:58] order these Devils it's not you and I it
[1:40:03] is Christ in us he recognizes the badge
[1:40:08] of believer where you can stand there
[1:40:11] and say it's enough sometimes we're to
[1:40:17] mess with the devil there's been some
[1:40:23] there have been times I'll tell you what
[1:40:24] seemed like again more frequently I just
[1:40:26] get right out mad at him this is it
[1:40:30] you ain't going no further it ain't my
[1:40:32] madness but you understand what I'm
[1:40:34] saying
[1:40:34] hide past so fine with it I've gotta
[1:40:37] make no peace back with you you ain't
[1:40:39] going no further
[1:40:43] you've got that authority that just
[1:40:46] ain't for a pastor I said you've got
[1:40:49] that authority then authority has been
[1:40:54] given to you on the day of Pentecost God
[1:40:58] sent down himself he sent back the
[1:41:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost his word and
[1:41:04] he wrapped himself in his army as the
[1:41:08] mighty Conqueror Oh blessed be the name
[1:41:13] of the Lord glory be to God I want you
[1:41:17] to think of it here in Isaiah 28 verse 5
[1:41:20] it says in that day shall the Lord of
[1:41:24] hosts be for a crown of glory and for a
[1:41:27] diadem of beauty unto the residue of
[1:41:30] people what is our crown of glory the
[1:41:32] Holy Ghost
[1:41:33] this was speaking of the outpouring of
[1:41:36] the true witness the testimony of Jesus
[1:41:39] Christ the Holy Ghost amen it is the
[1:41:42] crown upon our life and notice and for a
[1:41:46] spirit of judgment to him that sitteth
[1:41:49] in the gate that's what takes place at
[1:41:51] the altar it is the spirit the Holy
[1:41:53] Spirit when you yourself said I let go
[1:41:56] Lord then the Holy Spirit goes and says
[1:41:59] judgment has already been rendered on
[1:42:02] that sand on that old nature and you
[1:42:05] moved out of the way and the Spirit of
[1:42:07] God releases the authority and you walk
[1:42:10] out free why judgment he's already the
[1:42:15] prince of this world has already been
[1:42:19] judged
[1:42:21] [Applause]
[1:42:23] that's why judgment must begin at the
[1:42:27] house of God hallelujah there's an
[1:42:31] authority to lift that I love this next
[1:42:34] part and for strength to them that
[1:42:39] turned the battle to the gate
[1:42:43] he is our strength we're standing in the
[1:42:48] gate what gate are you standing in the
[1:42:52] same gate where the transaction was made
[1:42:53] by my kinsman redeemer you got to bring
[1:42:57] them to the gate the gate is where
[1:42:59] transactions are made the gates of Hell
[1:43:03] cannot prevail over this gate right here
[1:43:05] David said open unto me the gate of
[1:43:08] righteousness you with me go has went
[1:43:12] and stood in the gate we are in the gate
[1:43:14] the entranceway he said I am the way the
[1:43:16] truth and the life I am the door into
[1:43:19] the sheepfold he is our strip that turns
[1:43:22] the battle to the gate you know that
[1:43:24] says is where we're not trying to take
[1:43:26] it in our own hands but we recognize not
[1:43:29] by power not by my not by theology not
[1:43:33] by memorization of Scripture but by my
[1:43:36] spirit saith the Lord it's the crown of
[1:43:40] glory
[1:43:41] that's upon your head that diadem of
[1:43:43] beauty Oh hallelujah
[1:43:48] so when the enemy comes and wants to
[1:43:50] knock at your door you take the battle
[1:43:52] to the gate
[1:43:52] you turn it right to the gate he wants
[1:43:55] to come with you a sickness you take it
[1:43:56] right to the gate
[1:43:57] he took my sickness he took mine Furman
[1:44:01] ease by his stripes I'm healed he was to
[1:44:04] come and battle at you and say the Holy
[1:44:05] Ghost is not for you you can say but he
[1:44:08] is my Redeemer he has called and dealt
[1:44:11] with my life I have access to that of
[1:44:13] the Holy Ghost you need strength for
[1:44:17] overcoming in your life here he is you
[1:44:19] can stand there and turn the battle to
[1:44:21] the gate to him who triumphed over it
[1:44:23] all hmm kind of sounds like the big
[1:44:30] brother on the playground noise kind of
[1:44:35] go just a little bit further thank you I
[1:44:38] had to get that in quick Ephesians 6
[1:44:43] verse 14
[1:44:46] stand there for now here once the armor
[1:44:49] you've got the armor on we're not just
[1:44:52] walking around and you know everything's
[1:44:55] polished in matter of fact in this army
[1:44:59] right now we'll eventually get our dress
[1:45:00] blues dress greens or whatever more we
[1:45:02] get that new body but in the meantime
[1:45:04] wearing our fatigues for those you don't
[1:45:07] know what that is that's the stuff you
[1:45:08] can get on the ground and you can you
[1:45:10] got to fight in and you may have blood
[1:45:12] on it and you may have dirt on it and
[1:45:14] you're walking around don't look real
[1:45:16] pretty but there are things for you to
[1:45:17] equip you to fight with on the other
[1:45:19] side the road there's only the
[1:45:21] signification your dress blues your
[1:45:23] dress greens and whatever more because
[1:45:25] you are going to a ceremony stand
[1:45:33] therefore having your loins Girt about
[1:45:36] with truth
[1:45:38] how many would agree there's a lot of
[1:45:40] truth that's not even fit there's a lot
[1:45:45] of things that's truth that's not even
[1:45:47] fit to be talked about that's not what
[1:45:49] you want to gird yourself with because
[1:45:51] it actually doesn't allow you to move
[1:45:53] easily it actually impedes your movement
[1:45:56] this thought of girding up your loins as
[1:45:58] we're as they would wear those long
[1:46:00] robes they would actually be able to
[1:46:02] take the road there from the back and
[1:46:03] they would tuck it up here in the belt
[1:46:05] and that they themselves could actually
[1:46:07] be able to move freely but it were not
[1:46:10] hindered they were unimpeded in their
[1:46:12] movement remember here when we look at
[1:46:14] it in the scripture he was down in
[1:46:16] Exodus I believe Exodus 12 28 or
[1:46:18] something when they were eating the lamb
[1:46:20] the Bible says their loins were girded
[1:46:23] their staff was in their hand you know
[1:46:27] they were ready to go at a moment's
[1:46:30] notice this is what blowings being
[1:46:33] girded about with truth it's being ready
[1:46:35] to go at a moment's notice
[1:46:37] Oh Lord I'm ready to go Lord we want to
[1:46:40] be ready to go the Bible says in the
[1:46:42] Book of Luke chapter 12 let your loins
[1:46:44] be girded about and your lights burning
[1:46:46] that you are watching as one who is
[1:46:49] watching for the bridegroom to return
[1:46:51] that when he returns you might being
[1:46:53] able to open unto him immediately you
[1:46:57] are ready to go now being ready to
[1:46:59] Oh means you're ready to go and being
[1:47:02] ready to go means you're ready to go and
[1:47:04] being ready to go means you're ready to
[1:47:06] go what do you mean it means if there is
[1:47:08] something that comes up and brother
[1:47:09] Brian maybe you get sick something comes
[1:47:11] around and hold the sudden home ah you
[1:47:13] know the pain I can hardly get out the
[1:47:15] chair but sister Bob she's right there
[1:47:17] with a staff in her hand
[1:47:17] Lauren skirted she's ready to go she
[1:47:19] reaches over and she lays hands and
[1:47:21] begins to pray and said Lord Jesus this
[1:47:23] is my husband he's a provider of this
[1:47:25] whole and Lord Jesus you've said in your
[1:47:27] word that they shall lay hands on the
[1:47:29] sick and they shall recover
[1:47:31] so I'm yielding my hands to you under
[1:47:33] the authority of your word that you'll
[1:47:35] release virtue that will move into his
[1:47:37] back and release him that he will be
[1:47:40] able to move out of this chair Lauren's
[1:47:43] are girded you understand what I'm
[1:47:45] saying
[1:47:45] we're we're not walking around oh
[1:47:46] brother Brian I'd love to pray for you
[1:47:48] but I got to go pray through man I've
[1:47:50] been through so much stuff I've been
[1:47:52] doing this and man I had him prayed I
[1:47:54] had Neiman read I hadn't even done that
[1:47:55] you realize staying ready is staying in
[1:47:58] tune with God praying it's not just
[1:48:00] about being on these knees prayer is
[1:48:03] always from your heart are you with me
[1:48:08] this is not an excuse for anything but
[1:48:11] there were going to be some weeks where
[1:48:12] maybe that you have and you are more
[1:48:14] pleased with your walk as far as your
[1:48:16] time of Prayer your time in the word
[1:48:17] there's going to be certain things that
[1:48:19] you will be more pleased in one week
[1:48:21] than the other but remember your
[1:48:23] authority is not based on your routine
[1:48:31] here with me it's just it puts us in
[1:48:34] that place to say I want to be ready if
[1:48:37] I'm called upon somebody calls me and
[1:48:39] said hey there's just an emergency
[1:48:40] so-and-so was hitting an accident and
[1:48:42] they're at the point of death will you
[1:48:44] help me pray see that's being ready to
[1:48:47] go I said it's being ready to go Oh
[1:48:51] glory be to God oh my so having on the
[1:48:55] breastplate of righteousness that's our
[1:48:57] heart
[1:48:58] God is so drilling in a heart Lord and
[1:49:01] let everything let every motive and
[1:49:03] objective
[1:49:05] be right the bran would put it this
[1:49:09] simple he said it's having the word in
[1:49:11] you and doing what's right not out of
[1:49:14] fear it's our desire to please him
[1:49:17] that's the breastplate of righteousness
[1:49:19] isn't it incredible this whole thing
[1:49:22] brother Aaron this whole armament it's
[1:49:23] not like somebody just standing around
[1:49:24] you know like you walk in a museum but
[1:49:27] this whole armament it deals with the
[1:49:28] word inaction in our lives to where even
[1:49:33] the breastplate of righteousness is
[1:49:35] allowing the word to come and discern
[1:49:38] the very secrets and intents of the
[1:49:40] heart
[1:49:41] because there sometimes we can have the
[1:49:43] wrong motive and objective I say a man
[1:49:45] for all of them Lord I'm their pastor I
[1:49:49] I'll say man for all of them because we
[1:49:51] all fall under that that's why we need
[1:49:53] the word to come and discern our motives
[1:49:56] and our objectives sometimes when we
[1:49:59] think men this is the right thing to do
[1:50:01] and then we realize that words are done
[1:50:03] there right and then what happens if it
[1:50:07] if we really allow the Spirit of God
[1:50:09] after you know we come through all of
[1:50:11] our time before allow the Spirit of God
[1:50:12] to really help us say lord help me to be
[1:50:15] more sensitive help me to be more
[1:50:17] sensitive and more yielded to you what
[1:50:19] are you doing you're opening that of
[1:50:21] your heart yet you would say how can
[1:50:22] that be a guarding because you are
[1:50:24] opening it to him and it being open to
[1:50:26] him you are shutting out the other Oh
[1:50:30] glory now can I have just a little bit
[1:50:39] here in verse 15
[1:50:42] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:50:47] of the gospel of peace now think about
[1:50:52] this our feet shod with the preparation
[1:50:56] of the gospel of peace he himself our
[1:51:00] bridegroom our Redeemer our Lord our
[1:51:02] Savior
[1:51:03] he has already as it says in Revelations
[1:51:06] 1 he has already when John looked upon
[1:51:09] him he saw feet like unto a brass as if
[1:51:11] they burned in the furnace he already
[1:51:13] tread the fierceness of the wrath of God
[1:51:19] he bore our judgment he opened to us
[1:51:26] away he came down here and the Word was
[1:51:30] made flesh
[1:51:32] he left us bloody footprints that we
[1:51:36] could walk in
[1:51:37] he opened to us the way so much to where
[1:51:42] it would be recorded even in the book of
[1:51:44] Hebrews and it would speak in verse 7 he
[1:51:47] was made a little lower than the Angels
[1:51:48] now crowns him with glory and honor and
[1:51:51] did set him over the works of the hands
[1:51:53] thou has put all things in subjection
[1:51:55] under his feet for him that he put all
[1:52:00] in subjection under him he left nothing
[1:52:04] look at somebody and say nothing he left
[1:52:09] nothing that is not put under him but
[1:52:16] now we see not yet all things put under
[1:52:21] him
[1:52:24] we still see within these bodies we get
[1:52:27] sick
[1:52:27] death setting in but we've already had
[1:52:31] the mean immunization we've already had
[1:52:33] the curve the cure for the SIF or the
[1:52:36] snakebite
[1:52:37] we've already in our soul we've already
[1:52:39] received healing or one from a z-pack
[1:52:41] this came from God himself
[1:52:44] hey man hey mentor do away with that old
[1:52:48] sin nature amen and bring about a change
[1:52:51] within our life a transformation and we
[1:52:54] have that reality that has he raised we
[1:52:58] have raised with him and notice this in
[1:53:03] Hebrews 1:14 are they not all
[1:53:06] ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:53:10] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1:53:14] salvation ministering spirits
[1:53:19] to minister to you to me who are heirs
[1:53:24] of salvation
[1:53:26] these ministering spirits as a prophet
[1:53:29] will put it these ministering spirits
[1:53:31] are coming straight from the throne of
[1:53:33] God they come to minister not just the
[1:53:38] word but they come to minister the
[1:53:40] spirit of the word they come to minister
[1:53:44] that spirit now think of it like this
[1:53:46] when you look at how Micah remember
[1:53:49] Michael might I however you want to say
[1:53:51] it when you look at how Michael was
[1:53:53] standing down there and there was over
[1:53:55] 400 some prophets and man they and they
[1:54:00] were anointed but it wasn't ministering
[1:54:05] spirits from the throne of God how did
[1:54:08] he discern it he discerned it by the
[1:54:11] word I don't have no doubts man they
[1:54:14] might have felt a great in Norton I mean
[1:54:18] him might have felt all-powerful in
[1:54:19] there when you know you know SantaCon
[1:54:22] them were moving around with the horns
[1:54:24] and everything else but Michael stood
[1:54:26] there and he knew one thing that the
[1:54:29] vision of the word that was spoken
[1:54:32] through Elijah of that judgment God's
[1:54:35] Word cannot fail and all the rest of a
[1:54:39] midden paid heed to the Word of God this
[1:54:42] had gone up gone up but Michael was
[1:54:45] standing there and remember Michael was
[1:54:47] brought there because there was a
[1:54:49] believer by the name of Jehoshaphat that
[1:54:52] said don't you got one more and here God
[1:54:58] brought Micah and Michael was anointed
[1:55:01] with the ministering spirit from the
[1:55:03] throne of God hallelujah in the face of
[1:55:10] all that opposition he was standing true
[1:55:13] to the word and let me tell you
[1:55:15] something that any spirit that wants to
[1:55:17] minister and refer back to days gone by
[1:55:20] and the old traditions and old ideas
[1:55:23] remember this hour is not an hour of old
[1:55:27] ideas these are not the thoughts of man
[1:55:30] this is the inspir
[1:55:32] duration of the holy ghost that has been
[1:55:35] poured out in this hour to get a bride
[1:55:37] ready and in order for rapture amen the
[1:55:42] opening of this seventh seal the coming
[1:55:45] of the Lord is the pouring out of the
[1:55:48] anointing oil upon the head of the bride
[1:55:51] we have been anointed for a higher we've
[1:55:58] not been anointed with a vial a vial in
[1:56:01] ninety is like that of the frogs that
[1:56:03] look backwards come on somebody
[1:56:06] but the RAM anointing only looks to the
[1:56:08] throne hallelujah glory be to God in the
[1:56:14] highest think about these ministering
[1:56:17] spirits that are sent forth these are
[1:56:20] gifts for as you and I to use every gift
[1:56:23] that God has said in the body the
[1:56:25] ministering spirits coming through to
[1:56:28] edify you and I what you've had for the
[1:56:31] ministering spirit that reaches out and
[1:56:33] we're conviction struck your heart it
[1:56:35] wasn't a man
[1:56:36] it was ministering spirit from the
[1:56:37] throne of God that dealt with your heart
[1:56:39] the Holy Spirit dealing with the word
[1:56:41] and said come home come home and the men
[1:56:45] the Spirit of God begins to move upon
[1:56:47] your heart and something rises up and
[1:56:49] said I'm no longer gonna stay here in
[1:56:52] this condition I'm going back home this
[1:56:57] is what David could say the Lord take us
[1:56:59] my part with them that helped me that's
[1:57:02] God taking your part the ministering
[1:57:05] spirits coming along and encouraging you
[1:57:07] and I the ministering spirit that comes
[1:57:09] and says you can be born again the
[1:57:11] ministering spirit says there is healing
[1:57:13] for you there is deliverance for you
[1:57:16] that is the ministering spirit set from
[1:57:18] the throne of God and the Lord is on my
[1:57:21] side he is with them that helped me
[1:57:25] that's why brother Ron said we stay
[1:57:27] right with the word
[1:57:30] that's why we stay with the word because
[1:57:32] then there's nothing anointing of Samuel
[1:57:34] browning upon you come on now but it's
[1:57:39] now staying under the anointing of the
[1:57:41] word staying with the word then it is
[1:57:44] the inspiration
[1:57:45] I'm the Holy Ghost upon the people where
[1:57:48] Paul could say that your faith is not
[1:57:50] established in the enticing words of
[1:57:52] man's wisdom but your faith is founded
[1:57:55] in the power of God so that Paul would
[1:57:58] go on to say in 2nd Corinthians 4:5 we
[1:58:01] preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:58:03] the Lord and ourselves your sir your
[1:58:06] servants for Jesus sake see a lot of
[1:58:08] these verses I'm reading right now it
[1:58:10] also has to do with the feet being shot
[1:58:12] with the preparation of the gospel you
[1:58:14] realize that being shod with the
[1:58:16] preparation of the gospel of peace and
[1:58:18] as we'll get in here in just a moment
[1:58:19] here that the word itself the Living
[1:58:22] Word of God being carried how that the
[1:58:24] Hallett's are being carried it's being
[1:58:26] carried by Christ himself the Holy Ghost
[1:58:28] he's carrying it in the vessels of his
[1:58:32] chosen believers by the Holy Ghost
[1:58:34] notice we're not preaching ourselves but
[1:58:37] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:58:40] servants for Jesus sake no doubt Paul
[1:58:45] like any other Minister Paul was the
[1:58:48] messenger of the age but there might
[1:58:49] have been things he wanted to minister
[1:58:50] certain little things that was just so
[1:58:52] inspiring to him but he had to stay
[1:58:54] within the line according to what God
[1:58:56] was dealing for that particular service
[1:58:59] this is where Paul would go on to say
[1:59:01] 1st Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for
[1:59:04] this calls also thank we God without
[1:59:07] ceasing because when ye received the
[1:59:10] Word of God which you heard of us you
[1:59:13] received it not as the word of men but
[1:59:15] as it is in truth the Word of God which
[1:59:19] effectually worketh also in you that
[1:59:23] believe so our faith it's resting in the
[1:59:29] power of God now there's no doubt about
[1:59:32] it I speak to all of us here
[1:59:33] maybe there's decisions before your
[1:59:35] decisions you have had to make decisions
[1:59:37] you will situations that are coming in
[1:59:39] better in your life or will come in your
[1:59:40] life and we need the leadership of the
[1:59:42] Holy Spirit because we have the promise
[1:59:44] that the sons of God are led by the
[1:59:46] Spirit of God and what we want to do it
[1:59:49] is to say Lord I don't want it that it
[1:59:50] has to come a certain way maybe it has
[1:59:52] to be a light in you nor this no I just
[1:59:54] Lord I know that you'll let me know that
[1:59:55] this is you leading me there will be
[1:59:58] always in
[1:59:59] the leadership piece accompanies the
[2:00:02] leadership of the Lord so here let's
[2:00:06] just look at an example here right here
[2:00:08] in the scripture that would be very
[2:00:10] fitting to our lives here you have a
[2:00:11] group of people in second chronicles
[2:00:13] chapter 20 here they are as a group of
[2:00:16] people Israel those in Judah they are
[2:00:18] assembled together and you have the
[2:00:20] different armies that are going they're
[2:00:22] actually coming against Jerusalem now
[2:00:24] you remember when you look at Israel
[2:00:25] Israel himself as far as with it being
[2:00:27] Judah there was that split in the
[2:00:29] kingdom remember Judah itself was always
[2:00:31] the more spiritual one one that was
[2:00:34] inclined with God they were their
[2:00:35] dwelling within Jerusalem wow that that
[2:00:37] which is of the Israel or the rest of it
[2:00:39] would be dwelling in Samaria
[2:00:41] now notice they had assembled themselves
[2:00:43] together I don't have time to read it
[2:00:44] all but Israel had assembled themselves
[2:00:47] together they did the absolutely right
[2:00:48] thing that they should have done the
[2:00:50] Bible says if you look at this when you
[2:00:52] get home they got their families
[2:00:54] together husbands wives children all the
[2:00:56] rest of them they got together and they
[2:00:58] begin to pray they begin to remind the
[2:01:00] Lord of the promise that he had made
[2:01:02] concerning of that through through him
[2:01:04] by the house of God the temple that if
[2:01:06] we be in trouble in any way things
[2:01:08] armies are come against us if we look
[2:01:10] unto the house Lord
[2:01:12] if we look Lord unto that then you will
[2:01:15] save us you will hear us now they were
[2:01:18] not in a condition where they were in
[2:01:20] sin but here the enemy had just tried to
[2:01:23] advance and encroach upon their lives
[2:01:25] they needed an answer from God and
[2:01:27] they've approached God by his word his
[2:01:30] promises so their prayers was according
[2:01:33] to the word and so now look what takes
[2:01:36] place in verse 14 the Bible says then
[2:01:38] upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah the
[2:01:42] son have been and I the son of jail the
[2:01:44] son of meth and I and Levite of the sons
[2:01:46] of Asaph came the Spirit of the Lord in
[2:01:50] the midst of the congregation and he
[2:01:52] said hearken ye all Judah he inhabitants
[2:01:55] of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat
[2:01:56] thus saith the Lord
[2:01:58] unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by
[2:02:03] the reason of the great multitude for
[2:02:05] the battle is not yours but gods this
[2:02:09] was not a new word but it was the same
[2:02:11] holy ghost that gave it through Moses
[2:02:14] the same Holy Ghost that called Joshua's
[2:02:17] attention to it what did he do the
[2:02:20] Spirit of God raises a standard against
[2:02:23] the enemy he brings it down and says
[2:02:25] this is for you
[2:02:28] be not afraid nor dismayed for the
[2:02:33] battle is not yours the lords they were
[2:02:35] praying they were ready for an answer
[2:02:37] and the Spirit of God came in the
[2:02:39] channel to minister to him a ministering
[2:02:42] spirit notice tomorrow go you down
[2:02:46] against them so you're going to go out
[2:02:49] against him you know they're coming now
[2:02:52] once the Spirit of God has moved down
[2:02:54] and here's what it says you go out
[2:02:57] against them tomorrow behold they're
[2:02:59] going to come up by the Clift of Zins
[2:03:04] god knows their battle plans this is the
[2:03:08] cliff they're gonna try to come around
[2:03:09] on hallelujah you shall find them at the
[2:03:15] end of the brook before the wilderness
[2:03:18] of juruá
[2:03:25] you shall not need to fight in this
[2:03:28] battle set yourselves stand ye still and
[2:03:35] see the salvation of the Lord with you
[2:03:39] oma with you who is the salvation of the
[2:03:44] Lord with with you Oh Judah and
[2:03:49] Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed
[2:03:52] tomorrow go out against them for the
[2:03:56] Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat
[2:04:00] bowed his head with his face to the
[2:04:03] ground and all Judah and the inhabitants
[2:04:05] of Jerusalem fell before the Lord
[2:04:08] worshiping the Lord and the Levites are
[2:04:11] the children of the co fights and of the
[2:04:13] children of a chloride stood up to
[2:04:15] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[2:04:18] loud voice on high
[2:04:21] wait a minute tomorrow hadn't even come
[2:04:25] the victory hadn't even count Oh No
[2:04:28] but the word that they were under the
[2:04:30] word had anointed their eyes they
[2:04:33] already saw the victory
[2:04:36] so lately now they knew they were coming
[2:04:39] by this way they're coming by this way
[2:04:40] they bowed and worship Almighty God and
[2:04:43] then they stood up and they said thank
[2:04:45] you Lord and the devil tried to put
[2:04:47] something could try to fire but you
[2:04:49] don't know about this you don't know
[2:04:51] about that they were worshiping they
[2:04:53] already seen it conquer they already
[2:04:56] seen it defeated they saw the victory
[2:04:59] already what did that a ministering
[2:05:02] spirit what were they doing

[2:05:13] statement at verse 20 and verse 21 and
[2:05:16] they rose up early in the morning I
[2:05:20] don't know but I just got a feeling
[2:05:22] there was no snooze buttons pressed that
[2:05:24] day but Brian I got a feeling they was
[2:05:27] ready maybe they might have woke up a
[2:05:30] couple times then I said good Lord it's
[2:05:32] God it's got to be ready to go 1 o'clock
[2:05:34] in the morning lord help me get back to

[2:05:47] preach it all in my dream you wake up
[2:05:48] here it's gotta be late at 4:30 in the
[2:05:50] morning but this is how it is with a
[2:05:54] promise of victory you're able to get up
[2:05:59] and face the day you put your foot on
[2:06:02] the ground
[2:06:05] here comes a conqueror here comes an
[2:06:08] overcomer here comes one that's ready to
[2:06:11] claim the victory it's already been
[2:06:12] given it gives you strength to give it
[2:06:17] to get up even when you're facing the
[2:06:19] trials and adversity is coming your way
[2:06:20] and it seems like things are spinning
[2:06:22] around you go ahead and you put your
[2:06:24] foot on the ground you see the kingdoms
[2:06:26] of this world they'd fallen heir to the
[2:06:30] kingdoms of our Christ and His anointed
[2:06:33] come on now we know it's coming into
[2:06:36] power we know we have a word of promise
[2:06:40] and not just for something that is in
[2:06:41] the future but we know we have a word of
[2:06:44] promise I would say Lord let the Spirit
[2:06:47] of God the ministering spirit let my
[2:06:50] eyes be so anointed to wear I'm able to
[2:06:53] look past my frailties my failures I'm
[2:06:56] able to go beyond the sound barrier
[2:06:58] where I see nothing but Jesus Christ
[2:07:01] standing as the mighty Conqueror they
[2:07:07] rose up early in the morning and they
[2:07:09] went forth into the wilderness of t-cog
[2:07:12] and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood
[2:07:16] and said hear me o Judah and he
[2:07:20] inhabitants of Jerusalem I love this
[2:07:22] belief in the Lord your God so shall you
[2:07:27] be established believe his prophets so
[2:07:30] shall ye prosper and when he had
[2:07:35] consulted with the people remember this
[2:07:38] vision unfolds by their hand but it's
[2:07:39] got to have water to it I said it's got
[2:07:42] to have order to it when this vision
[2:07:45] unfolds notice we don't read this up
[2:07:49] above but when the vision unfolds and it
[2:07:52] is made personal now the people have
[2:07:54] taken received of the ministering Spirit
[2:07:56] the Spirit of God ministering the word
[2:07:58] they've taken it and rather William now
[2:08:00] begins to unfold of the plan for the
[2:08:02] battle when he had consulted with the
[2:08:04] people they already know you're not
[2:08:06] gonna have to fight it but now dude here
[2:08:07] comes that here comes a battle plan when
[2:08:09] he had consulted with the people he
[2:08:11] appointed singers unto the Lord
[2:08:14] Wow they're gonna fight a battle with
[2:08:16] singers and that should praise the
[2:08:22] beauty of his holiness and they went out
[2:08:26] before the army and to say pains the
[2:08:30] Lord for His mercy endureth forever
[2:08:40] they were anointed to see and this
[2:08:44] anointed singing it brought confusion
[2:08:46] among the camps
[2:08:47] one army slew the other arm in this one
[2:08:49] slew the other army the Israel didn't
[2:08:51] have to lift the battle Israel was able
[2:08:52] to sit right there on that of the high
[2:08:54] point and be able to look and see the
[2:08:57] enemy in that of a disarray the Bible
[2:08:59] goes on to tell us that when they
[2:09:01] finally had seized that Jehoshaphat they
[2:09:04] led the army of Israel and it took him
[2:09:06] three days to gather the spoils that was
[2:09:09] left of that battle glory be to God
[2:09:12] to sing praises to the beauty of his
[2:09:15] holiness aren't you glad that it is him
