so so thankful thank you for coming out on a Thursday night I know you're tired so I'll do my best not to be lengthy if you want to open your Bibles to Esther chapter four I'm just going to read one verse of scripture and then we'll just jump right in this is a little I guess I can call it a series it was over a number of services back home and I just I love the story of Esther I I think it's just a beautiful love story and it got to the point where every time I'd opened and I'd start reading that something was just jumping out and jumping out and there was one day that I I was reading and I and I just shut the book real fast and I thought oh Lord this is I I don't know what to do with all this so it I'm thankful to them and so just pray we could bring some of that tonight encourage you or and strengthen you and give you a push a push forward put our shoulder to the wheel Esther 4 verse 14 and this is mordecai speaking for if thou all together Hold Us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this pray father come before you Lord and I was just thinking Lord we say things Lord like I have on my heart God has kind of just settle our own nerves father but I just I feel like my notes have been a mess and trying to put them together and so I just ask you Lord to come and take over now and speak to this people father lead my heart God I just want to I just want to get out of the way completely and let you speak father so Lord when I stepped down and walk out the back the people will say that it's been good to be in the house of the Lord and they'll know that you pass by their way tonight father granted Lord bless bless the pastor if Lord I don't know if he's speaking tonight I know they're at the camp bless them bless the services there let the young people come back with great testimonies father if they haven't been filled yet fill them tonight we pray in Jesus name amen amen you can have your seats as you're being seated I greet you from Brother Paul our pastor and littler Life Church back home my wife said to give you her love she she couldn't make it with me tonight and was disappointed she said she always feels real welcome and and free here so just thank you for that so I just want to look at the story of Esther and and I'll try you know I guess we'll just start uh you know verse one it talks about gives you a good uh impression a good view into what the medes and Persian Empire was like and you could jump over into Daniel and Daniel for seeing it and and seeing the the elaborates of the kingdom and then you read an Esther and and it's just it's talking about the king and he was the richest king uh if from my understanding from history King Xerxes here um he was he was one of the richest kings and it was the the the kingdom had become to be one of the most illustrious portions of the medes and Persian Empire and and it actually just kind of struck my heart because I thought my goodness you know when you look at Christ he's the richest of all the kings he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords and and so that just kind of set the stage of the story for me and and looking at it and then you have you have a bride vashti and and the King sends his word to her and she rejects his word and because she rejected his word she gets rejected and she gets cast out of the kingdom and and so then he says you know this this virgin didn't accept me he she didn't accept my word he said go find me another one go find me another one and so so the word goes forward to draw a bride to himself somebody somebody who would who would know the king's heart who would live the king's heart you could just draw many types of even even husband and wife in there and I and I think we've done it before here the Lord just you know following rabbit trails and things as you preach but you know but you just have vashti as a wife and she's just the way she treated her husband and the way that she she kind of became the head of the home but then you have Esther coming under that headship of the king and and wanting to to not not know you see the whole process of Esther as she's getting going through the the um purification process and even to her night with the King and and all these women you know the the the the the the the the prophet tells her you can have whatever you want and you can take it with you when you're done you get you get one night with the King if he doesn't Choose You you keep whatever you chose and they're just just this wonderful Jubilee of taking all the gold and all the blessings but nobody wanted to know what the king's heart was except for Esther and so Esther comes and she she goes and I'm just calling him a prophet and she says a prophet I want to know what's the king's heart and so I imagine he just starts telling her what the king enjoys what he likes what he finds pretty what he finds pretty in a woman what he finds what he finds handsome in a man what a true man is what a true woman is and he starts portraying the king's heart to this little this little Queen this little bride this little virgin and so he's he's so you just see the perfect picture of God start to unfold even in the story of Esther and and so then in in this this uh kind of turn of events in chapter 3 and verse one it says after these things did King ahazarus promote Haman the son of hamedatha the agagite and I just thought it was interesting I thought why why does the scripture just just happen to throw in oh this is this isn't just his name this isn't just he's the son of this lengthy name he says he says he's an agagite and so I thought well why in the world would the scripture just give you that that little detail in there but if you start following the agagite the agagite lineage goes back into Genesis and we actually find Esau had a son and named him emalek then you can look and you could start tracing amalek in the scripture and over in Exodus 17 8-14 we won't read it for time's sake but amalek is found and he's going against the children of Israel they're coming out of they're coming out of Egypt they're going into the promised land and on this journey into the promised land emulet comes and he starts fighting the children of Israel I don't know why he started fighting them I don't think the scripture says it just says they met him and he started fighting him and so you have this battle set in a ray on their Journey to the promised land Schofield writes this note about amalek and I just thought it was noteworthy says amalek was born after the Flesh and and he's the progenerator of the amalekites Israel's persistent enemy it wasn't just the one time they came it was just as you find Israel fighting it's always against the amalekites the amalekites are always involved and so they become a persistent enemy Schofield says it's a type of the Flesh of the believer we know that the prophet said that your greatest enemy is yourself it's your own flesh it's my flesh it's your flesh and so this flesh becomes a persistent enemy against us he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now and you'll find that even in in uh Romans and Galatians it says that the the Flesh and the spirit war after one another it's this continual Battle of of right going on inside of you there's a continual battle in your mind it's it's a battle of of Paul Paul said and I think it's Romans 7 he said when I want to do good I I can't seem to do good I don't want to do evil yet I seem to find myself doing evil and but but then in there is another thread of Grace that God gives and he says there's a law of of sin and death but then you enter into a law of of spirit and life and that law is greater than the law of sin and death so even though we will war against amalek uh let me just continue reading the conflict with emalek in chapter 17 sets forth the resources of the man under law rather than those of the believer under grace the man under law could fight and pray under grace the Holy Spirit gains the victory over the Flesh and the believer's behalf and so but this Victory is only as the believer walks in the spirit acting in independency or Disobedience Emma let the flesh gains an easy Victory so we have to continually walk in the spirit so that the flesh can't have that preeminence over you so that you're constantly your mindset needs to constantly be on the word and constantly on the things of God because if you just let yourself go for just a minute then Satan can come in and he gets an easy victory but I'm so thankful and I'm so thankful you know we could be a discouraged people knowing that my goodness and we know the prophet said that you know you're you and and I'm sure I've said these things I know you know them but you know you two parts of you is unsaved only one part of you is converted only one part of you is sealed and so you know brother Branham said Satan has a punch it a Punch coming to you and he will he'll continually punch at us until we get out of here you have to keep that part covered you have to keep it you have to you have to learn yourself you can't this is it this isn't just it's a spiritual battle but you have to know yourself you have to know your enemy you have to you have to watch you have to pray you have to say man Lord I keep I keep failing in this area what is this that might be your one punch you need to shore it up you need to start blocking Satan's punches but it'll always shape of the flesh over in Deuteronomy 25 God is talking and he says I will blot out the remembrance of amalek forever so there's coming A Day friends that that though though we get weary in these bodies we get weary in this flesh there's coming a day when this flesh will be blotted out the remembrance will be blotted out and we'll Rejoice with the king forever so Esther 3 in in verse 1 so just continuing there for a moment says talking of of the king and promoting uh Haman he Advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence and you'll watch a little bit further down I just I forgot it worded this way verse 5. there was one who who wasn't bowing down to him there was a seed of God there that wasn't going to bow to Haman and and it says because he wouldn't bow nor did him reverence then was Haman full of Wrath and there's been uh Stephen carrussell came through our way recently and and preached about Warfare and and our pastors been taken breaking down Satan's wrath and and and you can look at multiple scriptures um there was a king over in Nehemiah and he just the the Wrath it doesn't say just wrath it's it's not just wrath anymore it's exceeding wrath it's it's it's there's there's an exponential growth to Satan's wrath and we're feeling the effects of that I'm sure if you're a Believer tonight you feel the effects that Satan is getting more and more Angry the attack is getting greater and greater but but we got to look at this because even though Haman becomes angry even though he's promoted we know that that Satan was God's right-hand man right all right we know our scripture right he was he was the right hand of God he was God's right-hand man and then when he fell he took a third of the angels with him right amen so so we can start seeing this type and and Haman getting angry and and then he's gonna bring it down and but it's just it's so interesting to me verse 8 and Haman said unto the king ahazarus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people and all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's Prophet to suffer them he just told a lie on God's people that's right he just accused he just accused God's people he went before the king and he accused God's people you have an accuser that stands before God and accuses you day and night amen and and you know it just reminded me comes to mind where where you know David goes and he goes into the battlefield and he's taking his his brother some bread or some sandwiches and and I I'm not sure what part but you remember his brother say David you're naughty David you just you got naughtiness in your heart and it's just this accusation when you have a purity and a desire for the Lord and you're you're trying to live the life of Christ and you make a mistake and you get back up and you make a mistake you might get back up and make the same mistake and you get back up and and there was a brother he said it's it's uh um I forget where what exactly the way it's worded but it was a wash pot and he said you know it's just that's where all the feet come to be washed it's just the filth it's this cycle that that you get stuck in it and it's not saying you don't have the Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost and you can still get in cycles of the wash pot where you're constantly up and down in the same thing I'm not saying you have to live there there's power to overcome through the Holy Ghost amen but you go through that enough and and my goodness you can get so discouraged in your mind you can get so so beat down and so to me to where Esther becomes but we'll find in a minute that Queen Esther and and and you the bride you have the power Haman thought he had the power he thought he had the preeminence in the king's in the King's Castle he thought he had power over the queen but will find that he didn't if it pleased the king Let It Be written that they may be destroyed do you remember Satan came to came to God and he was going to and fro it says and and the the the sons of God came before God and and do you know brother Stephen Caruso I love this so much it wasn't Satan that came and said hey your servant job Stephen brother Stephen he actually worded it this way he said he said God actually picked the fight and I thought I have never I've never thought of that before but that's exactly that's exactly what he did God picked a fight so why why excuse me why is it I'm going through this Lord why is this so hard why is this trial why why is this one sick why is this one and you you question God but it's because God had confidence in you so much that he picked a fight with the Devil and he said hey what about them have you thought about them my goodness Lord I did maybe don't have that confidence but God knows and this is this is I I wanna I didn't feel like I did this when I preached it at home I want to drive it tonight as we get to it that you have what you need within you you have what you need God has placed what you need inside of you and so it doesn't matter what the what Satan does it doesn't matter the attack it doesn't matter what you feel about yourself you are a son and daughter of God and you will make it amen so Esther comes and and and it becomes a a proving time it becomes a time where the the the the battle's been wrought it's been laid out before Esther and to make matters worse in Esther chapter five to make matters worse the scripture said that it had been 30 days since the king had called on Esther 30 days so you can imagine how she felt in the Kingdom 30 days since the king had called on her 30 days since she felt the presence of God 30 days since she since she had a real heart-to-heart communion with God where she knew that her prayer went past the ceiling and she's she comes to this time and and there's there's certain death for for the people of God there's certain death for her people and and the weight of it is resting on Esther the salvation of this world it's it's it's resting on on the bride it's there's there they have no if you were lifted off the Earth it would be complete judgment right now so you are you are holding back the judgments and the wrath of God on this generation on this Earth and so Esther has to she's got to go before the king feeling this way wondering what what have I done he's lost interest in me I I don't I don't have power I don't I am the weakest Christian right now but she forgot what the prophet said that when the weakest Christian gets on their knees that all of Hell trembles amen so Esther has to has to fight within herself and and and to go before the king she knew that there were laws in place that this this God this King was so holy she couldn't approach him if she approached him then she'd be put to death even being Queen there were laws and and it's it's amazing to me again like I said just the story of Esther just lays out the the the the the story of God because the medes and Persians they relied so much on their laws that when they when they wrote a law and that got stamped and acted in the place it could not be changed that that lock it can't be canceled it can't be changed they had to write another law in place in order for for I don't want to say I know that law but but just like an Esther the king they have to write another law to save the people because Haman comes he presents this his case before the king the king says do it you got the authority all the authority you do it put it in place Haman had it he had it in the bag so we thought and so well let's just continue on so there's this law in place and and God's law um just finishing my thought there God's law was was God was so holy that he told Moses he said Moses I'm going to come down and visit the children of Israel I'm going to come on this mountain but he said do not let nobody no animal no human being touch that mountain because I am too holy they cannot approach me unless I bid come and so it's it's just a perfect type here in Esther because when God comes down he descends on with Fire on the Mountain the mountain starts shaking and then he says now Moses come and so Moses could approach but it was only after God said you can come but I'm so thankful tonight that Christ Made A Way Christ made a way that through his Holiness through his death on the cross he rent the the the the veil was written too so now it wasn't just one man that could be bid come into the presence of God it was whosoever will let them come whosoever will let them come now he says come boldly to the throne of grace yeah how does brother see him do it come boldly to the throne of grace uh make sure I don't lose track of time here so whatever Esther thought about herself had to be laid down in that moment she had to hold on to a threat of Grace because you'll find that as she's talking to Mordecai she says you you know the the king everybody knows in this Kingdom that whoever approaches the king they'll be put to death but then she says but but there's one hope of Grace and that's a it's if the king holds a scepter out too so she was she was regardless of how she felt about herself regardless how you feel about yourself you have a threat of Grace that you have to hold on to tonight you have a threat of Grace that when you make a mistake you can reach out and say but your blood is still there your blood is still there you still said come boldly to the throne of grace you still said whosoever you said Lord that blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness because if they hunger and thirst there's just a hunger there they shall be filled so that's our threat of Grace tonight history lays out this beautiful and let me just let me just get this part because I while we're here there's this thread of Grace the scepter and I just I thought this was beautiful I looked up that word scepter and it started taking me down and I found in Genesis 49 10 it says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver from between his feet until Shiloh which is Christ come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be numbers 24 17 there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel so look at look at how beautiful and how perfect this is Psalms 45 verse 6 thy Throne o God is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter Hebrews 1 8 but under the sun he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom amen it's so good I just I I just fell in love with that I just fell in love with that there's a scepter tonight for you you can come to God anytime whatever you have need of whatever you're going through in your life right now Financial it doesn't matter something one of those Cycles you Lord I just want more of you it doesn't matter you have free access there's a scepter that's been placed out of Jacob that's a forever scepter amen now we'll find that we're in chapter five here let's just pick it up real quick are are you doing okay now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house I tried my hardest to find what this would look like and why this was so important and I couldn't but it's just it's just so detailed of of the way it is and and they they there was historic accounts that say the way that it sat in the way the King was that he the where Esther was that this described as the king she had to be in the king's view when she when she came out and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight now I just want to stop there just a moment because when you read when you read history there's there's accounts of this particular moment and it's not they say that Esther it wasn't just her coming up and walking approaching the throne she erased herself she she dresses herself not in her righteousness this was the apparel that came from the King Esther didn't own these clothes these were Esther's clothes these were the king's garments this was the king's righteousness his glory and Esther had to put it on she had to put on the Garment of Praise put on the Garment of Praise for your heaviness whatever you're going through tonight put on the Garment of Praise and come before the king amen because I'll show you I'm going to tell you right now when you do that watch God's response so history says that Esther she dresses herself and she comes and she's standing over there and and she she comes into view closer than what she should have remember she could be put to death now in this moment she could be put to death and I don't know if I don't know if the King was casting out judgment over something I don't know if there was there was but it says he he was just he had a stern look on his face he was sternly maybe maybe Haman was complaining about the queen maybe Haman was accusing the people again maybe he was he was accusing but when the king catches Esther catches his eye and the King looks and he's got a stern look on his face business here he looks over and it says Esther saw the sterness and she got so afraid that she fainted and so it wasn't Hallelujah it wasn't just the King sitting on his throne there sitting at did I lose it no okay just sitting at his throne and holding out a scepter he looks over he's sternly he looks over and there's Esther she sees a stern look on his face she faints it actually says the king left up from his throne and he ran to Esther the king oh come on now somebody he didn't just sit there when he saw Esther faint he jumped he leaped from his throne and he ran to her and he takes her in his arms so you imagine this this beautiful picture now she could be put to death but the King rushes to her and Scoops her in his arms and it says he starts talking he's Whispering sweetly to her so just Whispering love Esther my queen my queen do you got that and and let's see five two Esther the golden scepter go to the next verse there yeah and he's whispering to her and he's Esther my queen it's been so long why why have you fainted Esther my love why have you fainted then said the king unto her What wilt thou now I just this was something that the Lord showed me even while I was preaching this back home what will thou the king doesn't just say Esther What wilt thou Esther no he establishes her position still what What wilt thou Queen Esther what Queen Esther why why have you fainted what have you come you know you know the law obviously what did you what is so important what what is thy request it shall be given thee look at he just it's just non-stop what is it what are you coming to God for what do you have need of What wilt thou o Queen what will thou o bride of Jesus Christ I'll give you half of my kingdom and and you know with with what we know this day what we're blessed with in in the message of the hour we know that God isn't saying I'll give you half my kingdom God says I've given you my kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven is within you What wilt thou Queen amen I just I just fell deeper in love amen so let's just you know really what happened was Haman had put Esther in a tight spot Haman had become a powerful adversary and and Esther felt that in every way she knew Haman Haman had hath done this thing she tells the king we'll get to it in a minute but she says amen hath done this he knew right well what he was doing he'd become a powerful adversary she she felt she couldn't go to the king because Haman Haman put death between her and the King Haman put that there but Esther had to be reminded she was Queen no one no one in this proved it right here nobody was between the king and Esther she had Direct access and the devil he tries to get between us and our King sometimes through emotional discouragements through disappointments through complexes through the busyness of life through sin he himself presented to us Satan presents the sin to you and then when you fall he says hey but What wilt thou Queen Esther and what is thy request oh my his biggest block is the LIE he places between you it's not it's not what you think it's not your complex it's not your sin it's it's it's it's not those things that that separate us it's it's the lie that Satan puts in your mind we can go through such dry times this is this is what I got out of this because Esther you know just feeling 30 days she says it's been 30 days we can go through such dry times in our spiritual journey we we don't feel his presence we don't feel his inspiration we don't we don't and and you could just keep going we don't feel we don't feel we don't feel it doesn't matter what you feel it doesn't matter what you feel it's what the word says about you the King was available the King was available the entire time am I okay or did I do okay I'll let you work it out I'll keep preaching the King was available the entire time our King knows our voice there's that song He Knows Your Voice lift your hands it's time to Rejoice your cry has awoken the master he knows our voice he hears our prayers the moment we speak them you know in David or in in Daniel he says Daniel I heard you the first day you prayed I heard you the first time you uttered your voice but and you can you can find in Daniel the description on the spiritual side the there's a Prince of Persia and it says the angel says I had to fight against the Prince of Persia to get to you I heard you the first day but there's a spirit on your nation that I had to fight through in order to get to you Daniel there's a spirit in this nation brother Branham said every every nation has a spirit I imagine that we're just a whole heap of spirits in America and and you imagine so when you pray and you feel like your prayer isn't being answered you imagine what what the angels are going through you you've been heard but they have to fight through the spiritual warfare in order to get to you but they're on their way your your prayer the answer to your prayer is on its way amen he sees you all the time Esther was chosen to be his Queen in 30 days didn't change that amen Haman Haman this this this brings us to another another Point Haman had the law but Esther had the king's heart Satan can remind you of the law but you have God's heart tonight Romans says nothing shall separate us from the love of God there is no great span that can ever stay between you and Christ Jesus died on the cross to to breach that span or he died in vain amen Esther then becomes God's grace to his people she she you know the story of Esther so so uh let me let me just see what direction to go here Esther Esther became a voice crying out standing in the gap the heart of the Bride size and cries for the Abominations done in the city over in Revelations one of the final scriptures in the book of in the whole Bible but in the Book of Revelation says the spirit and the bride say come so you understand that that today God God God can speak in an honorable voice but that's not his program he's not here in the flesh he's here in your flesh he's here in the bride so he's saying come through the bride and and let me just drop this in now I haven't preached this at home so you're getting a little nugget that I haven't spoke yet there but over in chapter 8 it says she comes again Queen Esther she comes again to the king and now this is where my notes have gotten messy okay so we're all over the place she comes again before the king and she she falls down and she's in tears you know so so just real quick haman's hung we'll get to it in a minute and and so haman's haman's no longer in the picture there's there's an absolute the queen is just she is set up at the king with the king I mean she has direct access it's been established she comes again the king that that scepter is there he's holding it out every time Esther comes every time she gets the scepter and so she comes and she says but oh King you know this this is still going on and the King says wait a minute Queen Esther he says I've given you the house of Haman I've I've given you everything you have you have everything you need to write whatever you whatever you say shall be done whatever you ask for when you pray it shall be given to you whatever you ask in my name this has been established he says you say it Queen Esther you speak it now I've given you I've set this up perfectly now you do it whatever you say that is law that is Grace amen amen so goodness gracious I got I got two points I want to make here how long does Brother Sam usually preach on a Thursday night even if I'm one minute sooner then we're good a long time well cut can you cut that out of the huh amen uh Esther oh my okay let me let me just I'm gonna I wanna this quote was just so amazing the super sign and and brother Branham speaking of Moses and he says Moses he stayed just exactly with God's word because he sought God first and he knew his position Moses knew his position he knowed he was born for that age to manifest the word of God at that time to manifest the word of God at that time Esther we find in in a lot of history believes I think it's in the book I think it's Nehemiah you'll find Nehemiah or Ezra I can't remember offhand now I think it's Nehemiah there's a scripture there in there and it says it says the king but it just happens to throw in the queen in the scripture the king but then there's this queen with him and that Queen is believed to be Esther and they said they believed that that that is Esther Nehemiah comes and and there's a oh my there's a fulfilling there's a it's coming to the fullness of the word it's coming to the fullness the completion of time it's coming to the completion of the temple the only thing left is the walls have been undone they're not built yet so Nehemiah comes and he says King I I just I I think he's the cup bear maybe I just off the top of my head it's been a little while since I read it and he and the King notices Nehemiah why is your account why are you sad and he says oh King it's just the the walls of Jerusalem are still undone the king says whatever you need you got it go get it done and they believe in history that that was Queen Esther sitting there and she was probably influential in giving Nehemiah everything he needed through the king what he needed to complete the word of God remember over in Hebrews they without us are not completed you have the word of God within you you have everything you need everything we need friends here on this earth right now that we need to make it from today into the Rapture is here the fullness of the word has been opened and it's not just laying there in a book for us to read the the kingdom of God is within you the word of God the word of eternal life it's within you we have the answer to the devil's question we know we we might not feel like it but the prophet said it so that's what I'm taking we know what to do with the word the bride the queen she knows what to do you were born for this age to manifest the word of God at this time you were born you you weren't an accident you were predestinated for today not not not not not something external from yourself you are the word of God for this generation the spirit of God is that's why the spirit of God is so important the spirit of God in you so we can go to God like Esther did we can go to God when we when we in in prayer when you feel unworthy when you when you feel filthy you don't even have to do anything wrong you you can read a news article in it and just feel completely filthy and that's it's not you it's the atmosphere that we're in it's it's Satan's Eden but it makes you feel dirty you you you you you might have made a bad decision and you feel you can't go to God but you were born to go through this age through everything that Satan has in his Eden through through the the greatest generation of of pornography of of sexual sin of whatever you can but your desires whatever you want it's at your fingertips it's you you have you can divulge in anything you can be distracted that's the word I'm looking for you can become distracted so easily but you've been called for this generation through this time to go through that and to stand next to God one day amen and him say this is my bride Esther's purpose went far beyond just saving her people from Annihilation at that time it was to complete the work of God for her day you you Esther are the culmination the summing up of the ages you are what God was trying to say through Jesus Christ the work of God is not completed without you you are the final and full manifestation of God's word you question that a little bit you're not saying amen go go read or listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed he's talking and he says you know what God was trying to do through the scripture was Jesus Jesus was the Revelation but then he turns around same paragraph and says but you're the revelation of it all you are the Revelation you are the revelation of God's word amen oh my God I'd have to count how many services that this is all taken up here so uh let me read you a couple of things you're still with me we're doing okay on time now the only thing the little tree you stick it in the ground plant it and it has to grow it has to draw moisture from the ground and it has to draw more than what its allotted portion is you have to give it plenty of water and when you give it water it just drinks and drinks and drinks till it can't hardly drink no more and it just starts pushing out it pushes out limbs pushes out leaves pushes out blossoms pushes out apples the apples was on the inside of it at the beginning and it just has to drink now I know you've heard that probably a thousand times but I I don't want you to let it just go and say yeah that's cliche he's just saying what we've always heard you you have what's in you get my point you Esther had what was in her everything she needed to go before the king you have what you need to go before the king you have what you need to make it through and every man that's born again in Jesus in Christ Jesus everything you you have need of your healing Satan will afflict you sure he will but everything you have need of in the whole life's journey is right is in you right then and you are planted in Christ Jesus you see what I mean when you are born again in the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart you have everything that you have need of for the journey now I don't I don't believe he's saying you have you you have the full stature of the perfect man right then you have every you have it in you but you notice when the trees planted it still has to grow so you can't get lacks just because you have the Holy Ghost he's saying you have to drink and drink and drink and drink and drink and you have to drink the right things you have to feed the right things you have to get the right fertilizer for the tree you gotta you gotta come to church and let yourself be pruned by the word of God because no matter how long the preacher takes on Thursday nights now the only thing you have to do is start drinking drinking pushing out drinking and pushing out I believe he hears my analysis of Christ Jesus he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and every man that's planted in him can drink and drink and push out and push out to every Redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you and it's your personal property you don't just get half the kingdom you get every Redemptive right and the devil hasn't got any tied to it at all Hallelujah if he hasn't got any tied to it he can't tell you whether you do or not he hasn't got any legal rights his rights has been spoiled at Calvary now this I just read this real quick I tell you what's the matter with Christians tonight you're not drawing dividends on your baptism of the Holy Ghost drawn and drink and drink and drink and drink till you push out salvation push out Divine Healing push out the baptism of the Holy Ghost just drink and drink and you're planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life he that's thirsty let him drink him that heareth say come whosoever will come and drink from The Fountains of the Water of Life freely amen amen Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this I just got one more point I want to make Stay With Me today when Satan is Raging his anger at all-time high you can have what you need right inside of you when you receive the spirit of Christ into your life you become a new creature in Christ the word just isn't something we read so we said this my just looking up a couple things brother Branham said deity is within you resurrection power is within you the kingdom of God is within you the power of angels backing you lies within you if you've if you've been given a diagnosis of death how can you die with the spirit of life in you healing power is within you amen the God within you will believe his own word don't fear falling from it just let his faith flow through you if that genuine Holy Ghost brother Branham says is in you which is the word manifested you'll see the message of the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it amen he's wooing you all the time goodness so just just real brief as we come to a close Esther chapter 7. Esther as you know she she calls for a feast she calls for another feast and then I think it's three feasts and and I just kind of to me it was interesting because it was the Feast of wine and we know that wine is stimulation of Revelation and even the king at the beginning he says give them as much wine as they want according to the king's portion well the King was uh drunk so when he just kept going so he said give out give out as much as they can take in you have access to Revelation as much as you want amen amen so it gets down and and it finally comes to our to to the culmination of these feasts and the King he just keeps asking her Esther what what is your what do you want Esther please tell me I don't know if he was getting tired or not you know just just say it Esther I'm giving you half my kingdom I'm I'm you know what I bet it is I bet it's like God just speak it just speak it just tell me I you know why why did he pray for them to go to send out laborers because he just needed somebody to speak it God just just speak it please honey just tell me all right you know husbands they'll they'll you know the wives of well what's wrong honey nothing haha come on now please tell me no I'm good honey tell me what's the matter yeah I imagine it's God sometimes just just ask me all I need you to do is ask why Lord why don't I have this you just ask for it just ask for it amen and the king and so Esther she she gives her if I found favor in your side oh King I'm gonna I think this is in the Amplified and if it pleased the king let me let life my life be granted me for my wish and my people from my request for we have been sold and I am my people to be destroyed to be killed and to be annihilated if we had been sold merely as slaves as men and women I would I would have been silent for our Affliction is not to be compared with the loss to The King The King Azara said to The Queen Esther who is he who is he and where is he said God I'm just I'm so bothered right now God says who is he where is he where is he who has dared to do this or I can just hear God saying it who asked dared to do this thing to my Queen and Esther said a foe and an enemy this wicked Haman then Haman was terrified before the king and the Queen [Applause] and the King arose listen Haman knew in that moment that his life was in the Queen's hand it wasn't even in the king's hand it was the Queen's hand and the King arose in his wrath from the wine drinking and went into the palace Garden he just gets so angry he just leaves he just leaves and and Haman but Heyman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king and the King returned from the palace Garden to the to the place where they were drinking wine as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was oh my and the King said will he even assault the queen in my presence in my own house oh you can imagine tonight what what God is just gets Furious there there's it's it's just boiling up friends there's gonna come a day when When God says enough you dare do this to my queen in my presence [Applause] amen as the word left the mouth of the king they covered haman's face so they hanged Haman on The Gallows that was prepared for Mordecai the very trap he set for God's people turned around and Satan was issued the same decree Satan will be cast into the Lake of Fire God will get so angry he says enough is enough and then Haman your Haman the Haman Satan who has accused you day and night who is torment in your mind who is tormented your body who's tormented your children who who has taken our our loved ones God says that's enough and then Satan gets what's coming to him and it wasn't until Satan got what was coming to him that the Wrath of the King was pacified now you can stand to your feet I just want to give you one more thing so you'll find an Esther that they create the celebration and it and it's it's actually pronounced from what I could best I could find in the pronunciation at Purim one of the biggest celebrations the Jews have is Purim to celebrate the saving of the Jews in Esther's time the importance of this story just keeps keeps on and keeps on Deuteronomy says that that God will blot out the remembrance of amalek you remember we said that from under heaven so the the story of Esther is read during this during the celebration and while the story is read while the while the priest is reading the people can't speak but he pauses at certain moments and so he's reading the story of Esther and whenever the word Haman is mentioned he stops and the Jews all start booing amen and and I and I think it's it's booing and they make loud noises after haman's name is red they actually used to in in times before they would write Haman on rocks and on boards and when haman's name was read they would pause and they would start clapping these rocks and these boards together they would just start beating whatever had haman's name on it I mean you can imagine you know they're just they're just beating they're just the priest says you know and Haman and then he pauses and they just start beating it boo Heyman boo Heyman and they do that until at the end of the story when the last time haman's name is read and the last clapping is done his his name is erased off of whatever they wrote it on [Applause] they stomped their feet amalek is compared to the heel the the least sensitive area of the body represents the lowest of the low and is compared to being cooled off for becoming lukewarm so stomping their feet is trampling and weakening the inner flesh the inner amalek of their flesh so they stomped their feet as a symbol that the flesh is going out and the spirit is taking life amen so what I did at home I didn't bring Sharpies but if when you get home if you want to write what is bothering you on the bottom of your shoe write it because what happens to the bottom of your shoe is you walk on it it gets worn and eventually that's going to disappear amen amen come on brother thou art come I leave you with ascendance Thou Art come to the kingdom thou have been born you've come into existence you're in laodicea at this time and July 6 2023 for such a time as this amen amen I'll leave you with that to Rejoice God bless you God encourage you go on with God go on with God
