to stand you're more than welcome to [Music] what [Applause] Your Majesty [Music] Word of God speak raise the name of the Lord Amen if you would like to turn with me to First Samuel chapter 13 I want to say it's good to be here this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord and it's good to have brother Steven and his family here god bless you brother Steven verse verse 8 of 1st Samuel 13 well when that good Thursday night too bad we couldn't have just cancelled his ticket and had him here today so good to be in the Friends of the Lord let's read these few verses of Scripture then we'll let you have your seats here the Bible says and he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed the Samuel came not to Gilgo and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered of the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering of the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camus not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at mcNeish therefore said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gilga and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering and Samuel said to Saul thou hast done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which he commanded thee for now with the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart and the LORD hath commanded him to be Hampton over his people because thou has not kept that which the LORD commanded thee amen may God bless you and bless the reading of his word as you're being seated the Word of God is truly we received the forest it is up as David would say it's a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path way it's always there and when the Holy Spirit comes by and he brings illumination to his word he brings himself there and begins to make himself known through his word it it gives direction it gives opens up a pathway a channel for you and I to be able to walk and to serve Him according to his will and we find that as we're looking at here within Saul within Saul's life and just looking at where it has come to Saul has been raining as three years as king we find something here and I just asked you just to stay with me here just a few moments and just see how which the pathway God's will take us this morning but we recognize that even though Saul knows the commandment of the Lord but yet he's not kept it I think that we could we could agree firmly on this that it was nothing that was wrong per se with the burnt offering it wouldn't have been that he didn't have the wood in order it wouldn't have been that he didn't have the sacrifice in order it was nothing wrong as far as with we could say the order but then what was missing within it all was the leadership of the Holy Spirit and this is where as fundamental it saw was within this within this time it was a failure to wait on the Lord to bring his word to pass I want to just deal with this this morning just a little bit just on how that gone so press of my heart has throughout the week it it's to have we we you you and I as believers this this is what separates us and may believers is the presence of the Lord and in that the presence of the Lord we know that that's just not a feeling something that we feel when we come to the house of God his presence should be here but remember he says lo when you when you have been born of the Spirit of God he said lo I am with thee even to the end of the world whether you feel him or you don't feel him he is present and I would say that every one of us if we'll be honest we like to feel his presence when there's things that I am supposed or laid before me to do I like to feel his presence I'll just be honest with you I like to feel his presence say brother Sammy of you you ought to walk by faith I am walking by faith but then there's other times sometimes where things you know situations come that I don't feel his presence but I know that this is his word and we can see as we looked at our hearts desire is to walk in obedience to his word to please him this is what this is where we come to so we realized that it's more than just an offering you know this was an offering that's all made but you see God requires more than just an offering he requires an offering through his provided way and then they wonderful that God makes known to you and I his provided way that's that's the grace of God right there if not you and I would be guessing what is the provided way but God opens to our hearts when our desire is really to offer to him and to please him and to serve him and Anna think of this that that through the offering through the offering and I want you just to look at this for a moment through the offering itself the sacrifice is how the way is actually open to you and I the greatest the greatest offering up the greatest offering is that of self-will a surrendering of self-will and that is the greatest challenge in our lives in the garden of gethsemane is where the battle the victory as I brother prayed this morning that is where the lamb prevailed Calvary was only a manifestation of a victory that was won in the Garden of Gethsemane there was a battle lost in a garden and in this garden a battle was won and in this garden the battle the victory is made manifest in this garden it was a victory over self-will three times he prayed not my will vine will be done before the body was ever crucified his own will was crucified not my will vine will be done how many know he prayed let this cup pass from me he knew what awaited him he prayed let it pass from me rather better put it simply like this and souls in prison now Jesus prayed to dodge the cross I like things put that simple it gets down into layman's terms but you see there was a battle that was going on the battle that many times were Lila the battle is not out here the battle is right in here the first is to get the battle stopped there down in that soul that that nature would be changed and transformed to do the perfect will of God and after that then you received power then within your life you received a power through submission that his life can be on display you received an access that you can go to him in the midst of the battle you realize that the battle itself when Saul gives words here about I said the Philistines are around us I said this is going on do you realize he's looking with these eyes he's seeing the enemy with these eyes he's feeling the pressure of the enemy with that spirit and he goes to try to defeat the enemy with his own spirit based on his own eyes but the only way you ever have eyes there's got to be a sacrifice and that sacrifice must be according to God's Way let me say like this there's no way that you and I could be able to see without that of the Holy Ghost the new birth and there's no way we could ever be born again unless there was a sacrifice under the leadership oh oh mighty God he was the Lamb that was led to the slaughter he didn't just go there he was led to the slaughter and because he was willing to go his light was poured out that now through him by the new birth you and I might be able to see to understand the kingdom of God without that there is no seeing constantly within our our being it's a continual battle we know we're not to be pressured or move by time yet we are creatures of time but when we've been born again of the Spirit of God we're no longer just confined to time we're a creation of eternity a new creation in the same old temple amen eternity a part of eternity where in your soul you've passed into that eighth day but yet here you are still standing in this time and it's a battle continually to bring this creature of time subject to that creation of eternity if God has spoken he will not fail he will surely perform his word in his season he will perform his word in his season he will perform his word in his season notice he he he he he will I don't mean to be yelling at you but I wish I had a stronger voice look here in the scripture I'm just going to read a few places here in 1st Samuel 10 8 thou shall go down before me to Gilgal and the whole I will come down unto thee to burn to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings 7 days thou shalt tarry till I come to thee joy he said I'm gonna come to you tearing out be there well what time on the seventh day out eat that when I'm supposed to be there the important thing is be where you're supposed to be waiting and looking for the promise don't allow other things to pressure Rahab brother Brandon with the brown bear he got pressured to go feeling like how to go with the older if I go with the younger what were the older men say right now think what brother Brown makes a statement like this and he stands before his church in the message prayer in his presence and he asked the church and God forgive me for being dilatory you know what dilatory means it means lazy now how would we interpret that is being lazy because it looks like he's moving but what it is it was lazy to that of what God had shown no matter all that we can do we must do oh that he tells you to do of all the other efforts and everything else you know workers you know the scripture speaks up workers and workers and workers even leaving that of Satan's deceitful workers workers workers workers workers those little stand before the Lord Jesus did not cast out Devils did not heal the sick didn't I do this didn't I do this hey they were workers but what was wrong they didn't come through the sacrifice seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee o my hallelujah you know no doubt Saul could have said this is what Samuel said hold on a moment Samuel might have been the man the agency but that one Sam you're talking that was the Holy Ghost talkin come on somebody just like he told Sarah that day at there at the tent he said I will return unto thee at the appointed time of season I will return and Sarah shall have a son it was not that flesh man that was gonna be recovery it was going to be the Living God on the inside behind that skin that would actually move down in the coming into Sarah here's what he said I'll come to thee when I'll come to thee one hour you just watch I will come to thee if he said that that settles it hid no matter if it's a several-day and all of a sudden here we are we're standing and let's just use our time for sake of terms let's just say it's 11:50 p.m. what's ten minutes he said he'd be here well it's 11:59 he said he'd be here now here's what happens once he comes this is the pro MoMA or Jesus help me this is the promise when he comes when he comes I will show thee what thou shalt do so with his coming eyesight comes your eyes are anointed to be able to see you're looking at the battle saw and the battle looks too great how can I do this how can I overcome this how can I get my son this but wait till I come and when I come I will show thee your eyes will not be seen trembling in what you see around you but you'll be resting in me like when Jacob came back there into the land Jacob called the place maja near the camp of the two hosts there was a heavenly host and there was an earthly hosts Jacob was aware there's something greater here the Lord of Hosts is present in this place so vision true sight it only comes through the true sacrifice that's how we receive sight is through the new birth this is where it moves from just church are you with me it moves from just church it moves from just a message or the message it moves to a personal meaning in our life this is what makes the difference him when I come I will show thee Abraham spoken to by God the Lord told him in verse 1 get thee out of that country from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee I know this was simple but I'm just saying it as he's giving it to me you can't it be expecting God to show you I'll and if you're not willing to get out of your country get out of your country get away from your Kendra and get thee out to a land I will show thee Abraham had to be willing for this but let me tell you something God's patience is greater than any our patients could ever be because the opening part of this scripture said the Lord had said unto Abraham I wonder how many times that God has said to us over and over and over again forgive me Lord now what's this in 1st Samuel chapter 9 verse 26 here is where that Saul is coming to where Samuel is that God has already told Samuel that Saul is coming this way this is the man that I will send and I want you to anoint him verse 26 and they rose up early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house saying up then I'm a Sindhi away and Saul arose and they went out both of them he and Samuel abroad and as they were going down to the end of the city Samuel said to Saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand I'll steal a while but I may show thee the Word of God notice what he said stand still so notice that thy servants pass on bid them pass on other words separate yourself unto this moment sanctify yourself for this moment bid them to pass on separation and stand still how many times God used this in the scripture over and over and over told job's stand still right and he tells us to stand still sometimes takes the driver and bolts our feet in the ground and you know cuz you know it's just wonder sometimes it isn't right here but it's if us in our spirit we start getting anxious you must say Amen that's the truth well brother saying I got the Holy Ghost that's true your salt if you've been born again that part has been better by the Holy Ghost but you still got two realms in your life that is a part of time that if you pass if you pass in this moment those that have been redeemed there is a theophany waiting to receive that soul no longer that human spirit there then it's waiting on that of the glorified body that flesh body that is made according to God's plan now watch this stand still awhile and I will show thee the Word of God now watch watch how this unfolds here and I want you just to look at these at these things that are mentioned here in 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse 1 Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and Senators is it not because the Lord hath anointed me to be captain over his inheritance when thou art departed from me today then thou shalt find two men by Rachel Sepulcher in the border of Benjamin as Elsa and they will say unto thee the asses which that win us to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and SAR with for you saying what shall I do for my son then shalt thou go on forward from thence notice what's happening he is showing him the Word of God this is what he's doing showing him the Word of God before it ever comes to pass he's letting him know you're gonna go here this will be here you'll go here they will say this to you this is the Word of God not what's in this right here that we're reading it's not going to be quoted but 10 commandments it's not being quoted leviticus numbers none of that is being quoted but the Word of God is being made manifest and it's it crucial this is like we will say boot camp it's training saw to catch the will of God the Word of God as it's coming to pass been shopped out go on forward from there so once this happens then thou shalt go on forward from thence got to keep moving and thou shalt come to the plain of - boy and there shall meet the three men going up to God to Bethel one carrying three kids another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine notice the details the details and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands after that thou shalt come to the hill of God don't you see every bit of this there are stages where the Word of God is being unfolded here - Saul himself that he might receive confidence confidence that what God says it will be there at the right time at the right moment - the heel of God were the garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come hither to the city thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with the psaltery and a tablet and a platf and a heart before them and they shall prophesy and the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man and let it be notice this let it be these signs are coming to thee that thou do has occasion serve thee for God is with thee and let it be every time you find in the scriptures let it be let the word dwell in you richly let let let means that it is up to you and I to let it so all of these things that Saul would see yes this was spoken and this is what's happening well there they are you know what those bottles of wine oh here are those prophets well here's the hill of God on all those things all of these were junctures all of these were that of the Word of God that was being shown to Saul and what was spoken he would see it it was not just going to be a word out here it would be something that would be made manifest to him all glory to God don't you see this is to build confidence in the Word of God but when God has said it he will bring it to pass let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou doest occasion survey this word occasion it's a wonderful word it means do for thee as thy hands shall find or in other words acquire that which has been found receive it unto thyself so here's one thing forgot to make known his word it's one thing it's another thing for us to receive it well is this just me or is this God's Word come on now you know the battle we go through it's a battle I mean we could lay lay those to continue to lay them out but notice with within this here when all of this is taking place here is the word of God and folding when this you and you begin to see this happen you are to take it it wasn't that he was walking up and taking things from people but what God is making now receive it take it in to your bosom and say Lord I see what you are showing me just like when God makes known his will for different things in our life hey it isn't that scriptures get quoted it isn't that quotes get quoted it isn't that the boss shows up and all of a sudden he shows up he's downloaded the table app on his phone and he has something to express to you but there's something about it that God lets it be no this is my word for you and you say Lord I receive it I take it to my bosom for God is with thee this this is the this is the point God is with thee you mean God why couldn't God what could have just been said hey God is with you he wants to make it so no he'll take this angle this angle that angle this angle and he'll confirm it you know why he knows we need that I said he knows we need that if we're honest we need that I thank God for every confirmation I thank God for every confirmation he's ever given why because it wasn't just something for the past it's things I can reach back and the spirit of paw will illuminate to my heart when I get to feeling down we're not kidding whoa hello my Moses without bring us the people out you shall serve me of this mountain it will be a token unto thee then the scripture we read in verse 8 here right in the midst of don't notice where this is placed right in the midst after ten seven who thank you Jesus first samuel 10 8 come on now by time thou shalt go down before me to gilga and behold I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings had to sacrifice a sacrifices of peace offering seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee and shall be what thou shalt do Saul didn't fulfill this but the bride by His grace she knows it must be him it must be him perform his word in her life she does nothing until she has thus saith the Lord and it was so verson high and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day see it's God building this is child training he's building our faith this is where that Paul would mention here in the scriptures Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise you can't receive the promise until you've done the will of God but when God makes known his will and you from your heart will obey that in your obedience your obedience to that word is that he will perform his word in my life you see this is one lesson that a man after God's own heart will obey God to the uttermost he'll wait to the last moment as a matter of fact by the people of the world and carnal minds he might be regarded as a one who procrastinates not a child of God a child of God is not procrastinating they're waiting on him the world can look at it how many times brother Ram will tell us speech the trumpets then he'll tell us in earlier parts of the message he said I know he said you might think and find this to be juvenile he said but he changed what I was gonna preach he said we just I just want to follow his leading something that stopped to be juvenile old god help us help us to truly be mature men and women and women charity has come were able to stand with simplicity like children man thinks God slow he's behind times where he's forgetful let me tell you something he ain't forgot you he ain't behind times he's right on time [Music] you take that promise in your heart and you nourish that promise you take that promise that's a seed and you water that with praise and worship but the second I'm waiting on it to come to pass that's your worship you'll continue to worship but in the meantime when that promise has been made and you can take it in your heart and if it's not there in the right place right now say Lord let it so down into my heart that I can go ahead and begin to call those things that are as though they be not and those things that are not as though they are let me go ahead I will Lord shut well I'm waiting [Applause] let me just read just a few a few scriptures here Isaiah 30 verse 15 for thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength verse 18 of that same chapter and therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you you just ought to take that foot and kick that devil right out right now that for will the Lord wait the Lord will wait so that last moment Pharaoh's army has already come down let's just say standing between that the pillar fire here let's say there was a horse right there God showed himself gracious gracious the Lord will wait that he might show himself gracious and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the Lord is a God of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him I could go on to another to some other scriptures but I want to read one here in lamentations 3 the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seek of him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord did you catch that in that opening verse wait for him and seek him that seems contrary it's not it's not remember as God is showing his world you're receiving of what he is making known things that you're praying about even in your life you're waiting but you're receiving you're taking in every little thing as he's showing you're taking it in what's happening you're being drawn drawn closer drawn deeper what is it it's you waiting for him you're waiting for him while receiving from your being made strong that you might wait and you're waiting that you might be further strengthened and you're further strengthened that you might wait and you ain't bet you might be further strengthened it is a cycle that's how the word comes forth it is a cycle hey man it's a word it showed underneath the Spirit of God he comes forth in the harvest and then we Bri grow we benefit of that word and then it's sowed back again and then there's a harvest and then it's sowed back again there's a harvest then it's sold back again there's a harvest now let me take just not so much maybe a little turn here but the word when you look Scofield will use this word above that passage it's a scriptural word that's used even over in the book of Colossians it's a word intrusion intrusion means to intrude probably could ask the school child here this morning what does it mean to intrude but they could probably tell you and to intrude means you're not been invited you've not been welcomed intrude means to put oneself deliberately you can't just put oneself deliberately into a place or situation where one is unwelcome or uninvited yep if you know you're really not gonna be welcome you know what I'm battling with my spirit already huh yeah you know what I I just stay I want to go let me qualify that don't you dare use that to miss coming the house of God then all right come to the house of God no God we have a confidence he's going to speak to my heart he knows me I'm the apple of his eye I'm not saying that proudly I'm saying that to know that he is mindful of every little detail whether a right walk wrong he is faithful yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me hallelujah he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble mine eyes to the hills from whence cometh my help a messenger a rather coming to me who's engaged in battle there is a messenger that will engage with me to put oneself deliberately into a place or situation where one is unwelcome or invited so many places that we can venture into that here this morning but I just want to move forward here in Matthew 22 verse eight here's a wedding supper that's been planned the Lord Jesus gives this parable first seven verses remember here it was first it was extended to Israel they were blinded they rejected it that we might receive mercy but if I could shout it and smile and say don't worry Israel your times coming Caribbean God we love her but this intrusion well the joy this is totally contrary to the kingdom of God it's contrary it's contrary to even how God deals with our life remember intrusion is for one to put oneself deliberately into one place they might know it's the right place but they're putting themselves there you understand what that means that means your strength your effort this is what intrusion your effort yourself whatever do you do or I do in South we will have to maintain it whatsoever the Lord do us no man as no man taketh away you go on and on in Ecclesiastes but what's this Ben he said to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go you therefore into the highways and as many as ye find bid to the marriage this is a welcoming this is an invitation not intrusion so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found both bad and good he didn't matter bad or good come he can take care of your badness and he'll take care of your goodness hallelujah His goodness overshadows your badness and his awesomeness overshadows your goodness welcome an or good bring them Lord you don't know about on their life no but there is a history but it's not this history an earthly time but it is that which was written in my mind in my book I know that him tell him to come can you imagine here we were do we feel worthy we don't feel worthy Lord not me for me yeah he comes over he drops a little note by your way it's like a handful of meal [Applause] sent an invitation to me he sent one to you this this message of the wedding supper is preached to all but it has personal meaning we're not intruding we've just received of His grace and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not an on a wedding garment and he said unto Him friend see Jesus knew this man but he didn't know this man he was a church member friend he was around the cause of the wedding feast he was a friend listen if I was known to you as an enemy you tell your family watch out for that guy you can't trust him you watch everything around him because why you wouldn't know me and your family would be labeled to me an enemy this man was called by Jesus a friend he knew Jesus as a friend let me tell you something he wants to be more than your friend he wants to be your lover he wants to be your husband he wants to be your everything [Applause] friends is okay friends are alright but there's a deeper relationship than just friends Jesus himself the progression with the disciples servants friends brethren after the resurrection friends are privileged to hear certain things but brethren are there in the house sons daughters born in the house of God having the wedding garment on that wedding garment the baptism of the Holy Ghost not a church garment not something you can put on Sunday morning and take off no religion Calvary never gave us religion Calvary came the sacrifice was made the land was led by the spirit to the slaughter why that through the sacrifice where the enemy had besieged God's people all we were under besiegement but there was a dove member rose and send that up to glory and the devil of the Holy Ghost came back into the camp of the Living God and that dad was screaming with blood on its wings Oh is forgiven the sin debt is paid barley grass you can walk free [Applause] we're not intruders this man look what happened to him he asked him a simple question where's your wedding garment well Lord you know you don't believe the message Lord well you don't read the Bible you know I believe your word Lord he didn't ask him whether he read the Bible he didn't ask him whether he believed the message the wedding garment will speak on behalf if he's a believer understand his life speaks here's what happened to him then said the King to the servants bind him hand and foot oh no this cannot be the loving sweet Lord Jesus that would look upon this man and say bind him hand and feet there were those in that wedding supper that had an invitation and they accepted this man had an invitation but he refused it and he wanted his way and so because she chose his way he's identified as an intruder then if they leave on the Lord Jesus Christ he did did he believe that the Bible is true he did what's getting tight but the difference was he didn't have the wedding garment on the wedding garment was a display that you have received my way to the believersí this is contrary to the nature of the Holy Ghost our our outside behavior see this is where the battle comes the creation of time to wait on the Lord the outer man look I gotta had this remember the simplicity we were looking at with salt all those verses of Scripture that I read thereof saw find me one of those verses except one where it says the Spirit of the Lord came on it show me one of those verses where it had anything to do with feeling and had everything to do with him seeing the word come to pass what would have been discarded that's the word it was for saw it was for saw I think of this here look at this for a moment think of what the Lord Jesus says come unto me all you men are heavy late and I will give you rest for your souls I will take away your self-righteousness and I will give you a peace that passes all understanding he made known to us as we come under his leadership in 1st Peter chapter 2 as we move under his leadership and grace and the attributes moving in our life an entrance will be ministered unto you Eve intruded into a place she was uninvited it was a promise but she had not received the invitation into that promise yet as far as the way being opened you agree with me but what happened is she intruded sorry i intruded but sara submitted sorry i intruded but sara once she was changed she submitted she submitted no longer intruding she's receiving what she has now been invited into a stir was not an intruder Esther was invited Rebecca was not an intruder she was invited I'll tell you right now there's a greater invitation offered right here this morning then if the President or any of the heads of state would offer you to come set at breakfast lunch or dinner with them because their kingdoms will fade and pass away they can make all sorts of promises they might be able to write them in with their pen wait till the next one gets in he'll open up folders and write things his own way or her way or what have you but this one we're talking about here this morning you want this wedding garment it don't matter how good you are it don't matter how bad you are you must come his way or he regards you as an intruder notice what the Lord Jesus said just a few more moments notice what the Lord Jesus said here kassir stands this the woman at the well we we know her the woman at the well she stands and as far as in her outer garments of herself she came to the well at a different time than all the rest of the women did but that day he had wrote her into his appointment book before the foundation of the world he made that appointment and Jesus keeps all his appointments [Applause] maybe headaches or reminder no I said I must need to go by Samaria I must needs go by Lorraine I must needs go by over here I must need go by down here down 21st Street I must need scope back here is he speaking to her she looks at this this is just any other man and he begins to speak to her he begins to uncover seyton phony had her packed away he thought he had her so packed away was such condemnation such sad and sets unbelief but we're talking to the one right here who broke the easter scene we're talking to the one right here who hates seals off of lives we're talking about the one right here that breaks the linkage of your first birth and I'll take you by the new birth and identify you back into the title deed by the abstract of the holy ghost and he's talking to her he said if thou knewest the gift of God he weren't talking about a ministerial gift he's talking about eternal life if thou knewest the gift of God you can't earn a gift you can't earn this you can't be good enough to have this call whether they're good or bad or good and Bad's how it says you can't earn the gift of God but here's what he said to her give me a drink it's calling for her to submit their presence he's calling her to submit and divine grace is present to bring her in life I gotta go ahead and say this brother branham is here talking to a woman on the platform and he stand there talking to his sister now he said what it is he said I'm just talking he said and I'm catching your spirit he said the angel the Lord is here and what's happening is your spirit is lining up with the angel of the Lord and he said as your spirit is lining up with the angel the Lord thus saith the Lord he's healed you of your gallbladder troubles all she had to do was come in line with the age Lord who was present her need was met God and His grace would work to bring us in line in harmony you know who was talking to you they know the gift of God you would say you would say to me give me water give me drink you would lay down your bucket of all your efforts all your doings and you would do what I am unfolding to you that you might have everlasting life everlasting life is not just a confession from your mouth it is a reality by the person of eternal life himself coming in and making his personal self known to you that you were included in this Paul said like this in visions to hate for by grace are you saved through faith and then not of yourselves it is the gift of God it's given you're not intruding you're invited Acts chapter 2 verse 37 when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do they couldn't have asked what shall we do unless their heart had been pricked first what's what Peter says Peter said go and join a church let it be one where people are friendly that's nice we welcome that let it be where people are happy that's nice we welcome that that's not what he said because there has to come the whole emphasis of Calvary is that through the sacrifice where the lamb was led by the devil that we might receive our sight repent I've always believed on God but have you repented well I've been a good boy a good girl but have you repented because I don't care how good you've been you first must repent we were born in sin shape and iniquity you and I didn't ask to come that way that is a product of intruding into the will of God but God came down he didn't intrude he made himself a body that he might come into and then through that life invite you and I invite you and I back into his divine will repent I know that's a foreign word nowadays but it's the gospel if you don't repent you're not getting the first-base repent means that you recognize you are a sinner what I've been raised in church all my life I never said a bad word never did this and never did that I never did that your first birth condemns you I don't care if you were known as teacher's pet and goody two-shoes you must repent I don't care if you kept all the commandments you must repent I don't care if you know every doctrine the message you must repent this is the way of imitation repent means Lord I am a rich sinner we're saying I know about God I think this guy here we talked about with the wedding lack of wedding garment he not had you beat he was a friend he didn't just know about God he was a friend I'm not mad at you I'm trying to bother hunch and the Holy Ghost set forth the way repent and and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins I was baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost that's not what he said well that's what the church taught that's intrusion not invitation the Trinity doctrine is not the divine invitation set forth by the divine Commission of the Lord Jesus Christ it's an intrusion but the revelation of the name of Jesus Christ is an invitation no other name under heaven given whereby men might be saved [Music] whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved invitation don't have to fight pearl in true chewing notes an invitation repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it goes together I said it goes together if you say I've repented and you haven't walked into the waters of baptism you have not followed the Scriptures repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the understand you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost once you've done what he said dude and he moved on your heart to ask what must I do if you're coming here and you don't feel that way you better pray you better say lord help me and move on my heart coming to church friends only lasts so long if you don't have a real solid experience with God this becomes no more to you than a mere social club but I'm telling you this ain't no social club I'm coming here to get myself ready to leave this world I want to be ready I want to be in every moment for him to move well you're just a nut you're you're crazy no I'm a believer I hear that invitation of what it is for me to be set free and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you at the set time I will come and when I come I will show thee you receive eyesight when I am come no wonder David could say in the coming of the Lord in Psalms 27 the chapter of the rapture now has hidden me in the secret of his tabernacle it is pavilion now hath he have he he set me up on a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above my enemies the first scriptures in that chapter David's aware of what's all around him he's surrounded he's encompassed just like at this hour all the demon powers surrounding the bride just like all men will be gathered against Jerusalem surrounded but I am in the midst of thee [Applause] and now shaaban head be lifted up above thine enemies for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body scripture read before this and acts to you repent you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let me just qualify this there's people sometimes that I've stopped that's come here I want to talk to him you want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why you say why would you do that because I want them to understand this is not Roman Catholicism I want you to understand what this means that you recognize yourself as a sinner and I recognize him that he is my atonement he is my lamb I want to be identified with his death and be identified in his resurrection I want to lose my identity and be identified with him now when the brothers whether myself or other brothers are helped doing the baptism you come up here and you step down into this tank you're standing there you can't baptize yourself you come there and the brothers will tell you times ii maybe they want take a handkerchief and just try to cover your nose so the water i'm not going to be your nose but they'll kind of tell you how to what they're trying to do is make sure that they've got you in a position that they don't drop you but they're going to bury you and when you're standing there in that tank you completely when you feel their hands come up and you hear the prayer that's been requested feel them Lord with the Holy Ghost and then you hear that we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have their hands here you are your weight is in their hands they take you and submerge you and they bring you back up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just as it takes what we're able to do in following the word where we can take and bury you in the water but he himself is the one who baptizes you into himself and it's the same way where you let go of yourself and say I'm completely in your hands and he takes you down in him and you come up still in him your life isn't shrouded in the invitation well he has bid you to come and you realize like Esther I'm not an intruder this is my husband's house Heyman's made some awful accusations but I've received encouragement through the word of the Lord that reminds me of my position and who I am and where I'm standing where I've been divinely placed not because I was worthy but where I am placed by him to come before his presence boldly with confidence as Paul would say by the new and living way into the holiest of holies he made a way through his blood cell wouldn't it be a shame if you come to church and you would come to church but you never came in here all you did you came and maybe you set back there in the conference room maybe you came in you set right there and right there in that foyer said ma I went to church what what part of church well I I didn't go in the sanctuary but I went to the building the church but what would you stay out why would you stay out well listen I can hear it just as good out there but all what it means to be in here you can hear it out there but you hearing it out there is to invite you in here you see this is God's Way not intrusion but invitation he doesn't want nobody to intrude he makes known his way let me just encourage you this morning encourage you take his invitation you might be here this morning well on your way take your invitation Esther take your invitation you've got a need go before you stone this morning you've seen the example that God put out with Saul don't just look at that say all that was so no no that was the word of the Lord that was sown shown to saw you you have an invitation the invitation was walk this way so when you see this happen going up here when you see this happen go on up here when you see this happen go on up there these were all signposts along the way to encourage him if you're going to Cleveland or you're going to Toledo you don't go blindly most of us hope our phones get it right but you look for signs even with your phone and your GPS you look for signs that say Toledo such-and-such and miles or west on to you look for those things what are they they are biomarkers encouragement you're headed the right way keep going and by eyes of faith you see the end and here this morning if you haven't traded your robe for this wedding garment why don't you trade it this morning why don't you let God take this word and make it a life to you I mean where it's something that it's a life to you he's alive in your life it's a sacrifice to make if we can go back to this altar right here and I am closing your stand saw it's waiting oh no that's an orange car they do have a blue car I'm certain my pullet that's it the neighbor's house Sol's pacing he's pacing looks like he's waiting doesn't it he's pacing he's getting more nervous more anxious every moment the Simon he's waiting no no remember when you wait for him you seek after him what if Saul would have been there saying Lord I know Sam is gonna be here because he's your mouthpiece he's the one that is ordained to offer up this sacrifice for the RAM tells us samuel was a type of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the one who takes the word and shows it to you and I I know he's going to show up and Lord you know I remember one day right there after I was anointed you know Lord I remember when Samuel told me that I would run into a couple men he told me what they'd be carrying told me what they would dress like told me even what they'd say to me Lord it'd happened right on the dot Lord I didn't even have to try to make them stand in a place the handkerchief was there the glasses were there they were sitting in the rocking chair it was right there just like you said every detail was in place boy he too got on that one whose glory to God I feel his presence right now Saul and Lord I remember after that you told me to go up to the hill of God when I'd be going up to the hill of God there'd be some prophets come down one became this one be carrying that glory to God it happened just like you said but Samuel what in the world would he do the same thing I do and the same thing you do encourage myself in the word of the Lord sure there's times we quote promises that come to our hearts but there's other times the rehearsal is the word of God coming to pass in our life and we rehearse his faithfulness in the midst of that time about that time what's happening what's happening at that time what's kind of like Samson their muscles start to grow them LOX is starting to grow out that covenant starting to grow out and how you until you're starting to get energized right there while you're waiting on the sacrifice while the whole time you're doing that waiting on him you're the one becoming the sacrifice you're sacrificing your own will by choosing to focus on him who provides for himself you see God we're coming to a time of the year you all know this we're coming to a time of the year where there will be flowers Easter flowers behind on the altars when I used to work for a greenhouse and we would deliver Easter lilies I would have to ride in a panel van then things shoved back in there only so high and you get that pollen on your nose pollen on your jacket pollen all over your self and you're carrying them into these big old churches and sometimes in churches scared me to death when I walk in them they were dark and kind of spooky looking I'm not saying that to be mean I'm just I'm just telling the truth I don't know who's gonna pop out of that you know and I'm carrying those things up there but God don't want flowers he don't want all the beautiful things that you can do he wants you the altar was made for you through his altar he made way that we could come to the altar of self-sacrifice self-denial let me read this to you he said warm up to God come back to him throw your heart out to him he said I was reading a sermon the other night my sister brown down here at the conference center and how she preached Calvary Road a road of sacrifice I hope that's all right to say that what a masterpiece of a sermon that was what people need today is get back on that self-sacrifice lay your all lay your all on the altar and forget who you are but the son of God or the daughter of God walk forward claim every promise God's got for you there'll be a revival let me just put it in here that'll shake Laureen like it never shook it before your neighborhood your home and men and women come back to God come back to that place listen I don't mean come back to church I mean come back to God let every home start a revival what an opportunity this morning what an opportunity an invitation that's given and that invitation that's given this morning you know the greatest compliment you could pay to the Lord Jesus is to receive it is to receive that invitation the greatest compliment is to take him at his word it's to believe what he said to believe as he is unfolding his word to our hearts mr. Hanson or Jesus hello my lord father we are not standing here today because of our merits the Lord you have invited us or there's some invitations that my wife and I have received sometimes just like some of my brothers and sisters sometimes the Lord there's been invitations that I've received to go through a wedding whether it was in Canada whether it's a different state sometimes the Lord I've had to turn it down because of different trips and things that's been made and I just felt to be at home no doubt Lord God some setting here they've had to turn down invitations a little card that comes in there inviting them to a ceremony has in there a little a little card if it's maybe a catered wedding and it has a little blank number of people attending that's something Lord that we have to put down on there who's gonna be attending how many or Jesus we're claiming our households Lloyd we're claiming our children we're claiming our loved ones like Rahab we express we express this judgment that is impending by that of the true token that we've received we've received mercy when we were new judgment lord I pray this morning or this service I know its head meaning your hearts this has not just been Lord just another service you're calling this morning you're calling Lord God to that man or to that woman yes you're calling Lord God to that young man or that young lady you're calling this morning would you're letting them know I've invited you won't you come to me won't you lay down your way why don't you come my way my invitation take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly ye shall find rest for your souls granted this morning Lord may you Lord who has directed this service as you spoke and plucked Lord God the strings of the heart may Lord God your grace Lord may it flow to those hearts or that heart there might be just one Lord it might be just one here this morning the Lord Jesus say Lord I want that wedding garment Lord to come you are provided Ward has ever had his bow let me just speak to you moment believing is a wonderful thing and the scripture said whosoever cometh to God must believe that he is you see the Living God will make himself known as the Living God that he's not the god of history that is the I am and his speak directly to your heart he'll deal with your life letting you know things that that you know that it took more than natural measures this is God and in his mercy he will move in that manner to stir up faith to believe that he is believing is a wonderful thing you must believe but let me encourage you this morning you've got to go further to believe and walk in his word of what he would ask of you to believe that he is my sacrifice he is my Savior you must believe but in your believing you must repent you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's your promise you see the first two you repent that's willingness that's surrender and then you being baptized it's you surrendering hands come and take hold of you and they bury you or place you submerse you in this water representative of a grave and they raise you back up identified with your sacrifice in his death to be identified in his resurrection and then he the Holy Ghost comes and he baptizes you in to the body not not a church not a building not a gathering but in himself I wonder as every head is bowed here this morning I wonder if there be one you'd be willing to stand to your feet you'd be willing to say Lord I want to do what you are asking me to do you'd be willing to make that stand for the Lord Jesus Christ as he stood for you I'm willing to lay my life on the altar I'm willing to become sacrifice [Music] oh ma friends I'm not going to scare you and I don't mean to scare you but his mercy his spirit won't strive always with men the same Lord God that it had me to speak this this morning it's the same Lord God that's been dealing with your heart I'll tell you he can do for you what you never imagined possible he'll take you beyond the church life they'll take you into a living reality of his presence of who he is he'll give you our sight what you never had before oh god be merciful would there be one god bless you hallelujah god bless you dear Jesus I wonder this morning we're all here we stand we stand many times even in Our Lives maybe youth you've repented you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ let me tell you something if you've walked in that in faith I want you to know he made that promise with you in mind you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he made that with you in mind he knew you'd want it and the reason you want it because it's a desire a longing for him nothing else in this world can satisfy god bless your hand any man he sees your heart you stand just like that on the scripture you know about living God that touched your heart you stand right there on that word you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God that you shall receive the promise I know I'm also speaking men and women sons and daughters lives that have already come into this new birth where I eyes have been opened her lives have been quickened maybe today you can you got needs in your life you got things that are sitting before you you got decisions to make you just say like if I just say it like this Lord help me to see the simplicity as you made yourself known to saw help me just to see the simplicity Lord Lord you know I love the supernatural and it was supernaturally how things were arranged how Samuel spoke it and how it was set how it was arranged the Lord God I realized even a greater supernatural part is for me to recognize you working in simplicity how many would say lord help me to be sensitive [Music] forgive me for my times of impatience and help me Lord luck the example was given of Saul if Saul would have just encouraged himself in the word of the Lord while he was waiting his pacing his pacing would have turned into footsteps of dancing he would have had joy because he would have been rehearsing what you are as you made yourself known to him Lord I ask Lord God for every heart Lord Jesus every hand that's been lifted the hearts behind it ask God that you would grant to him that petition that requests Lord that they've had on their heart Saul needed to find some animals Lord and you not only showed him and let him know where the animals would be and how that they were found but you pointed out along the way the different points of your word Lord Jesus I asked this morning may our eyes be open Lord in the simplicity Lord to see you in action to witness you working that this is you what God unlike saul we're gonna wait on you and seek for you we're gonna talk Lord of all your doings and what you've done Lord I asked this morning and for every one of these requests now for every heart Lord that's been lifted every hand Lord that's been lifted to say Lord consume me Lord as a sacrifice Lord consume me Lord God I pray this morning Lord as they themselves Lord maybe they've already walked in the waters of baptism but Lord may this morning may they Lord God just surrender their life like they did into the hands of those that baptized them that day Lord God may they just surrender Lord completely and say Lord completely baptize me in you Lord Jesus Granite Lord we've acted on your word you're bidding Lord you've ìletís as you led the sacrifice granted this morning father in the name of Jesus noise [Music] fear Mike [Music]

Laura Vita God we're not intruders we've been invited invited attending attending bidden to come and he's opened up the way that we could come well we know the scripture says that we must press but that pressing to enter isn't pressing against God that pressing is against our own self it's going beyond the sound barrier of our own selves because of him because of him to be identified with him oh what a privilege to be invited in the presence of the king and to think of this this invitation here he is just like you come to my house or I come to yours if I come to your house I go up and I ring your doorbell right knock on your door that lets you know that I'm there that's what that does it let you know somebody's there so you go to the door you look out maybe the peephole or you look out the side lights for you look out the window up there you want to see who it is because you don't want to just let just anybody in but if you're expecting somebody you've invited him you're expecting and from your heart if your heart has been touched by his invitation or he is knocking at your heart and you're expecting he said whosoever heareth my voice and openeth open the door I will come into him same way he came in Sarah he promised he would come I will come unto Him and he will sup with me and I with him what could I serve him what could you serve Him it's his word coming to maturity submission in our lives and he is partaking of what his life is bringing forth in us what an invitation what an invitation we're not intruders we've been invited you see how God leaves this pattern down because he knows you and I are tempted and will be tempted to intrude not into that of what we've already been invited into and have already been received into but where things will come about in our lives who will be tempted to intrude but remember God invites us by making his word know he makes his will known every time we could go throughout this building here this morning if we said over there at the depot and fellowship there's things that you could testify in your own life where God has showed you and met with you from time to time and it's never been the same way each time yes that's God why why would he do it that way he wants us to depend on him [Music] I know this is simple but my prayer for my heart help me just to be sensitive and waiting but Simon how do i make myself sensitive just stay in him take the promises of what God has been doing in your life and rehearse that maybe or maybe you were one who is you're wanting the Holy Ghost you take the promises Lord you touched my word you're the one who's drawn my life you're the one who's watched over me Lord you want that preacher that yet with my heart it was you Lord nobody could know my life like that it's you that's answered prayers in my life Lord you see that's him personally making himself known to you he's given you ground that you can stand there and in the midst of that while you're waiting on the Holy Ghost to come you can stand there and encourage yourself in the word of the Lord [Music] God is faithful friends he's faithful many times we get impatient and because things don't happen the way we think they ought to happen we get impatient and we'll say he didn't answer prayer let me tell you something when you've stood on God's Word what takes place right here things can take place and bring a drop right down in your life right here the manifestation of it will take place you believe that he will he will declare his own works [Music] you love him I trust that he's brought it all
