[42:19] contexts and things of more or less here
[42:23] where we would have like the looking at
[42:27] it in the the spiritual part of how that
[42:30] God would deal with us because really
[42:32] those are the things that really open it
[42:36] opens to us and we are able to
[42:39] understand it because there's things
[42:40] that we can look at here in the Word of
[42:42] God and you know it's always it's always
[42:45] fitting to look to the Lord to find the
[42:49] season
[42:50] we're in so that we'll know exactly what
[42:53] what he wants and what he desires at
[42:55] that time and we need to find that
[42:58] because sometimes there's seasons that
[43:00] where God has it and things can be
[43:02] spoken just like when the Lord Jesus
[43:05] when he stood there in John 6 and he
[43:08] said except you eat the flesh of the Son
[43:09] of Man and drink his blood you know
[43:12] there were many that walked away in that
[43:14] time they said this is too hard of an
[43:16] under of something to be understood and
[43:18] so their offense came because they
[43:22] couldn't understand it but yet there
[43:25] were those of the disciples that they
[43:28] remain yet they couldn't understand it
[43:30] they couldn't explain it but recognizing
[43:33] that it wasn't that season that their
[43:36] understanding would be open to them as a
[43:39] matter of fact it wouldn't be until the
[43:41] inspiration God dealing with Paul's life
[43:45] even after they themselves had come into
[43:47] this place yet Paul would begin to be
[43:50] moved by the Spirit of God and how that
[43:52] Paul could say I have received of the
[43:54] Lord and Paul would go in and begin to
[43:57] open that season to them of the word and
[44:01] then we know that that is not Paul but
[44:03] it's God that makes our understanding
[44:05] fruitful in the season when we have need
[44:08] of it everything that you can look at
[44:10] within the Word of God the whole sum of
[44:14] the Christian walk is arrest and it's
[44:17] looking to the Lord to know that God has
[44:20] the seasons within his hand it's the
[44:23] same thing in the raising of a children
[44:25] same thing with the church same thing in
[44:26] each one of our lives there's seasons
[44:28] within our lives there's chapters in our
[44:31] lives there's certain times where
[44:34] there's chapters maybe that we don't
[44:35] want to end and then there's other
[44:36] chapters we want to end there's chapters
[44:39] we like to revisit and there's other
[44:41] chapters we're glad they're in the past
[44:43] but nonetheless we look in all of these
[44:47] things to desire that God would have the
[44:49] complete oversight and direction of our
[44:52] lives because when you when you look at
[44:54] this passage of Scripture it is not
[44:57] something that is rote or confined to
[45:00] that of just looking at a family and the
[45:03] natural but
[45:04] to recognize that God himself has arrows
[45:08] in this our God has had arrows in every
[45:12] hour because God is not one with a bow
[45:16] without arrows but God has arrows for
[45:20] his bow God has a target that he desires
[45:23] to hit in every age he's got a purpose
[45:26] for everything he does he's got children
[45:28] in every age that are born of his genes
[45:32] children that he molds and he shapes
[45:34] children he has a relationship with
[45:36] children he has to such a refined point
[45:40] to wear that when the transfer of fur of
[45:42] power moves upon their life it's able to
[45:45] bear that and actually hit the mark that
[45:48] God has called for I'm glad that we are
[45:51] in the hand of that mighty man we are in
[45:55] his quiver and you know God does not
[45:57] shape and fashion our lives to have us
[46:00] as arrows that would just remain there
[46:03] as arrows and we could look and say mile
[46:05] what a what a nice arrow that is and the
[46:07] fletching and you know the nock and boy
[46:10] the spine on that arrow oh my the tip no
[46:13] God has a purpose for every one of our
[46:16] lives every one of our lives there's not
[46:19] one of our lives that are gonna remain
[46:21] just in the quiver but God has for every
[46:24] one of our life is strung on his bone
[46:27] it's been fitted to the measure of his
[46:30] life within this hour and so when we
[46:34] look at it in that in that in that part
[46:36] of it and to see that within this of the
[46:39] arrow itself and as we've been looking
[46:41] at then at that identity you look and
[46:44] you bring it down in even as we here to
[46:46] here this morning would be gathered here
[46:49] our inheritance and when we look at our
[46:51] inheritance here you know each and every
[46:54] one of us you've made up me to 23
[46:56] chromosomes a father 23 chromosomes of
[46:59] mother Yeah right we've got certain
[47:03] things within our body that way that
[47:05] even that certain chemicals would be
[47:07] arranged in our body you know some of
[47:09] you I think I heard a prayer request
[47:10] about somebody with kidney stones or
[47:12] whatever more I know my wife she deals
[47:14] with kidney stones I don't deal with kid
[47:16] stones we've been we've had doctors that
[47:19] have told us drink this do this and do
[47:21] that don't do this and don't do that let
[47:24] me tell you something I drink all sorts
[47:26] of things I do all sorts of things and
[47:28] yet for her she has to watch everything
[47:30] she does why is that chemicals in her
[47:33] body but why wouldn't with what's
[47:35] different within me it's an arrangement
[47:37] in me but you know regardless of what it
[47:40] is there might be certain things in my
[47:41] physical being or in your physical being
[47:43] that you deal with that someone else
[47:45] doesn't deal with but yet within it all
[47:47] God is receiving glory to himself
[47:50] because God has ways we know God can
[47:53] heal us of situations and conditions but
[47:56] what is it if God would allow something
[47:58] to linger see sometimes we look at
[48:00] things like that and we don't term that
[48:02] to be glorious but remember your
[48:04] testimony is not that you are completely
[48:06] and no longer have it but your testimony
[48:09] is actually reflected in the midst of
[48:11] the tests and of the trial where you're
[48:13] able by the grace of God to conduct
[48:16] yourself with joy and that takes
[48:18] something greater than our abilities
[48:21] because our natural abilities we get
[48:24] frustrated we'd be ready to give up but
[48:26] I'm so thankful for the joy of the Lord
[48:29] not the happiness the joy of the Lord is
[48:32] our strength so I'm grateful to God for
[48:35] that so we look at this this 23
[48:38] chromosomes from each and then you look
[48:40] at an even the way that we are natured
[48:42] within within our ourselves our outer
[48:45] nature and then you put on top of that
[48:48] and inherited nature inherited traits
[48:51] inherited things even in our nature our
[48:53] emotional makeup and all of these things
[48:55] here we did not ask for but yet these
[48:59] are things that gets compiled and then
[49:01] you put on top of that the experiences
[49:04] that we've had in life positive and
[49:06] negative and all of this comes together
[49:09] and this is who we are but you know what
[49:12] God doesn't look at that and say there
[49:15] ain't no way in the world I can do with
[49:16] that
[49:17] but God says I can make a trophy of
[49:19] grace out of that I can take that and
[49:23] make a trophy of grace because he
[49:26] already by his choosing already knows
[49:28] what part
[49:30] and that of himself that lays there so
[49:31] God doesn't get caught up with all of
[49:34] these things that I just spoke of but if
[49:37] you look at it on the spiritual side of
[49:39] it we are also we are of our heavenly
[49:42] father is that right our mother the Holy
[49:46] Spirit come on now that New Jerusalem we
[49:50] are born our DNA is of God
[49:53] it's nothing tied into this of the
[49:55] natural so to be able to see that if
[49:58] that is that is so in the natural then
[50:00] as we look in the spiritual then what
[50:02] about that strain of predestination as
[50:05] that would travel on down the line we
[50:07] can go back and though that we and our
[50:10] outer nature might be different from
[50:13] Joshua we might be different from Moses
[50:16] we might be different from Peter but yet
[50:18] that inner nature that strain of
[50:21] predestination we are of that same
[50:23] family tree the tree of life so then to
[50:28] look at this we we are we were just kind
[50:31] of looking over these parts to just to
[50:34] rest within the fact that the Lord
[50:36] indeed is our maker and we look at it in
[50:40] the scripture you know to think of how
[50:42] you know unique and how that God is so
[50:45] laid everything out you know there's
[50:47] times where no doubt that you or me
[50:49] we've been places and I think we were on
[50:51] vacation and we were actually I thought
[50:53] one of my aunt's was at this place every
[50:56] one of us people start saying hey you go
[50:57] over that way and you look this way and
[50:59] we thought one of my one of our aunts
[51:01] from Maryland was actually at the place
[51:03] back in July we were on vacation I mean
[51:06] it was just an uncanny resemblance now
[51:10] when we got around we started looking
[51:11] and then there were certain things that
[51:13] we started noticing certain little
[51:15] details but I'm telling you the way she
[51:16] wore her hair everything about it I was
[51:19] like oh my goodness this looks like my
[51:22] aunt and for a moment I got happy
[51:23] brother joy I thought my there here -
[51:25] that's so wonderful and you know as we
[51:27] got closer and you know my mom and my
[51:30] wife started going around where she was
[51:32] at around the corner and looking at the
[51:34] corn and think they wanted a bit more
[51:35] interested in buying corn than nothing
[51:37] they were actually trying to find out is
[51:39] this really her or not but you know what
[51:42] if there
[51:43] then something that you would have found
[51:45] somebody no doubt all of us have you see
[51:47] somebody sometimes it looks like
[51:49] somebody else and and you know you've
[51:51] maybe had somebody come up to you and
[51:52] mistake you for somebody else but
[51:54] there's one thing about it there are
[51:56] certain unique things about us that
[51:58] nobody else would have when it comes
[52:00] down to even thumb prints fingerprints
[52:03] and all those there's many different
[52:04] things we can go through and to see how
[52:06] God has such a uniqueness of how then he
[52:09] has set us apart and made us and that's
[52:12] all been according to his choosing he
[52:14] and for his reason now look at this in
[52:16] Psalms 95 6 let's just pick this up as
[52:19] we work with it this morning here david
[52:22] says o come let us worship and bow down
[52:25] let us kneel before the Lord our maker
[52:31] verse 7 for he is our God and we are the
[52:37] people of his pasture and the Sheep of
[52:41] his hand then we look in Psalms 103 know
[52:46] ye that the Lord he is God
[52:48] it is he that hath made us and not we
[52:51] ourselves in that the truth it comes
[52:56] down to what the Lord Jesus you know the
[52:58] Lord Jesus makes the statement in the
[53:00] book in the book of Matthew then he's
[53:02] actually addressing sometimes the
[53:04] anxiousness that can be a part of our
[53:06] life where he says who by taking thought
[53:09] can add one cubit to his stature by
[53:14] taking a purpose to try to change and
[53:17] try to either add to or try to be
[53:20] something else and you know there's a
[53:21] lot of things that I won't deal with
[53:23] that this morning but there's a lot of
[53:25] inspiration that can come around our
[53:28] lives but we always want to make sure
[53:31] that what we're being inspired by is
[53:33] that of the Lord is that right we can
[53:36] the weekend you know really appreciating
[53:38] one another there's things when you say
[53:40] my I wish I could be a little bit more
[53:42] like this brother a little bit more like
[53:44] that sister the real part about it is
[53:46] that we enjoy within that is Christ and
[53:49] yet God has made every one of us
[53:52] different they're unique even in the
[53:54] blend
[53:55] it all comes down with this it's all
[53:57] about us surrendering to God's will for
[54:01] our lives only if it was easier said
[54:05] he's you're done than it is said we are
[54:11] his people the Sheep of his pasture and
[54:14] they know God has a plan God has a plan
[54:19] he is not the author of confusion his
[54:26] plan doesn't always it never unfolds
[54:31] quickly but his plan is sure and his
[54:36] plan unfolds and as it's unfolding it
[54:41] requires a patience to look to him as
[54:44] it's unfolding just as you look and how
[54:46] things begin to take place through that
[54:49] through the days of creation we find
[54:51] that that's exactly where Eve she got in
[54:54] trouble there was inspiration that came
[54:56] her way and brought a confusion to her
[55:01] regarding the plan she ought to just
[55:04] been waiting for God to unfold for her
[55:06] life you know one thing about it this is
[55:08] one thing you can I'll tell you what
[55:10] I'll just say it is short like this you
[55:12] can take it to the bank and cash it and
[55:13] that is God's plan for your life his
[55:16] will it will always be peace it will
[55:21] always be peace you know there's always
[55:23] things that you can find in your life
[55:25] experiences that you have either been
[55:28] through things where God has made known
[55:30] as will that there are principles that
[55:32] will always come and they will always
[55:35] move right in unison with them and you
[55:37] think of that we could go into Noah's
[55:39] Ark and just looking at that and the
[55:41] will of God but it just comes to this
[55:43] here when God reveals his will it does
[55:47] not increase our anxiety but it brings a
[55:52] rest so that's one of the ways to always
[55:55] test those things when something is made
[55:58] known because when God reveals his will
[56:01] he reveals that this is what his desire
[56:05] is for your life and when he
[56:08] does that then you realize that Lord as
[56:11] you've revealed it then it's you that's
[56:13] orchestrating it then let me yield
[56:15] myself to you that you can get me in
[56:17] position where I need to be in order for
[56:20] your will that you've revealed to come
[56:23] to pass and that brings a rest within
[56:26] our life so to understand that God has a
[56:29] plan we look in the scriptures here and
[56:31] I've let me just refer to this and then
[56:34] I'm going to go to Psalms 139 but in
[56:36] Jeremiah 29:11 here Jeremiah's moving by
[56:40] the unction of the Holy Spirit and he
[56:43] says for I know the thoughts that I
[56:45] think toward you now in this setting of
[56:48] Scripture without dealing with it a lot
[56:49] this morning God's actually letting them
[56:52] know that in the midst of correction the
[56:54] correction itself is not confusion but
[56:57] correction has your amendment in mind
[57:01] correction has in it because what God
[57:04] has already predetermined the destiny of
[57:07] our lives that destiny cannot be changed
[57:09] but along the way you and I need
[57:12] correction we need the tutorship of the
[57:15] Holy Spirit and God will work and direct
[57:17] our lives and he's letting us know right
[57:19] here as he did to Israel that I know the
[57:23] thoughts the aim the purpose the plan
[57:25] that I have that I think toward you says
[57:28] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[57:32] evil to give you and expected in it just
[57:35] puts at arrest correction is not evil
[57:37] corrections are blessing but it's only a
[57:40] blessing if it's received is that right
[57:44] it actually can become a blessing and
[57:46] minister to our lives peaceable fruit so
[57:50] as we look here in Psalms 139 going on
[57:53] to verse 1 here we find in the opening
[57:57] part of this chapter here David says O
[57:59] Lord thou hast searched me and known me
[58:04] thou knowest my down sitting and mine up
[58:09] rising thou understandest my thought
[58:13] afar off
[58:15] ma thou compass thou compasseth my path
[58:20] and my lying down and aren't acquainted
[58:23] with all my ways for there is not a word
[58:27] in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest
[58:30] it all together
[58:32] thou hast beset me behind and before and
[58:36] laid on hand upon me such knowledge is
[58:40] too wonderful for me it is high I cannot
[58:45] attain unto it and we knows we looked at
[58:49] the latter part of this this chapter
[58:52] here it's part of the chapter where but
[58:55] the random will lay it in within this
[58:57] time and we can see very clearly the
[58:59] where that we were already as the
[59:02] redeemed elect of God were already wrote
[59:06] in God's photo album even before our
[59:09] members were ever formed yet they were
[59:12] perfect yet God even as David would go
[59:16] through it right here even in these
[59:18] opening parts God knows you realize God
[59:21] has let it know right here that I know
[59:23] you're down times and I know you're up
[59:26] times you know you and I we pray and
[59:29] we'll come before God we let him know
[59:31] how we're feeling we'll will say Lord
[59:33] Jesus I need help or you know sometimes
[59:36] you know when we're feeling really good
[59:37] a lot of times we maybe don't let him
[59:39] like let him know like we ought to but
[59:41] let me tell you he already knew about
[59:44] all of those things he knew about our
[59:47] down sitting our uprising everything
[59:50] about our life and you know when we look
[59:52] at this and all when it can so strike
[59:55] our hearts to know that God has known
[59:57] the end from the beginning he knows
[59:59] every aspect about our life he knows us
[1:00:02] you and I might think that we're coming
[1:00:04] to a place of really getting to know
[1:00:05] ourselves but remember he knows us
[1:00:08] better he knows us in and out
[1:00:13] I mean God is one then you know he he
[1:00:15] knows exactly and here's the wonderful
[1:00:17] thing about it even in knowing that he
[1:00:20] doesn't despise us of our down settings
[1:00:23] even
[1:00:24] knowing things about us he doesn't look
[1:00:26] down on it because one thing about it
[1:00:28] all of this is opportunities of His
[1:00:32] grace to be made known and be reflected
[1:00:35] through our lives so he knows all
[1:00:38] everything and I I look at it like this
[1:00:40] if he already knows all these things
[1:00:43] about our life then why in the world do
[1:00:45] we have to pry and try to find out why
[1:00:48] do we become so anxious about things
[1:00:50] sometimes it's because that we're still
[1:00:52] here in this sticky carnal nature it's a
[1:00:57] battle that that we have and so within
[1:01:00] and I'm grateful to God that God would
[1:01:02] would help us to be really focused and
[1:01:05] very direct within the battle that we're
[1:01:08] in because you got to know who you're
[1:01:10] fighting you got to know what you're
[1:01:11] fighting you got to know who your enemy
[1:01:13] is you're not just going into a battle
[1:01:15] just haphazardly and we're not talking
[1:01:17] about just general terms here but it's
[1:01:20] really coming to find out what is the
[1:01:23] problem as brother van will say it in
[1:01:24] the message he cares do you know dad
[1:01:26] said here's a man he said that maybe
[1:01:28] he's a drunkard in his life and he's you
[1:01:31] know come to drink brother man says we
[1:01:32] know what the answer is but he says what
[1:01:36] we want to find out is what's the
[1:01:39] problem how many times were brother
[1:01:42] branham if then just think about this
[1:01:44] let's just pause for a moment how many
[1:01:45] times think about the messages from that
[1:01:47] time how many times within that time
[1:01:50] that brother am go into situations where
[1:01:53] people had come into such great
[1:01:55] devastation and heartbreak whether it
[1:01:57] was the you know a CEO of the bank that
[1:02:00] the Prophet spoke about or whether it
[1:02:01] was that young girl or that young boy
[1:02:03] and brother Brad would deal with those
[1:02:05] things that what had taken place in
[1:02:07] their life did they need the Lord
[1:02:09] absolutely they needed the lord did they
[1:02:11] need a change in their life yes they
[1:02:13] needed a change in their life but he had
[1:02:15] to be able to go and find out what the
[1:02:18] trouble is I'm glad that God just does
[1:02:21] not give a simple tylenol aspirin answer
[1:02:24] but the Word of God is so direct to be
[1:02:28] able to deal with the problem in our
[1:02:30] lives aren't you grateful for that and
[1:02:32] this is the promise that you and I are
[1:02:34] under in this hour this is not
[1:02:36] a message of just generalities but this
[1:02:39] is very the very precision of Almighty
[1:02:42] God let me tell you this shaft has been
[1:02:45] down through the ages of the genes of
[1:02:47] his loins these fletchings of his
[1:02:50] character is being reflected in his
[1:02:52] children the very knock of relationship
[1:02:55] is on this arrow and the very point and
[1:02:58] sharpening of a people who are made
[1:03:01] ready for the coming of the Lord already
[1:03:03] and have been in every age to speak with
[1:03:07] the enemy at the gate and in this hour I
[1:03:10] believe I'm one other and I believe I'm
[1:03:12] looking at people right here that lives
[1:03:14] are speaking with the enemy right at the
[1:03:17] gate it's knocked up in his bowl in the
[1:03:20] fullness of his power where the token
[1:03:22] itself is being applied and the transfer
[1:03:25] of God's power and it's moving through
[1:03:27] our lives I believe that with all my
[1:03:32] heart
[1:03:34] he is our maker as we said you know
[1:03:38] looking at God's plan you know we look
[1:03:41] at it as far as with children you know
[1:03:45] we don't know what God's plan is not all
[1:03:49] of us have a visitation like Samson's
[1:03:52] parents did
[1:03:54] brother Bram told us you know in regards
[1:03:57] to his birth he said this day said that
[1:03:58] Nazarite birth was pertaining just for
[1:04:02] me and to see that how that you know
[1:04:04] brother brems parents didn't didn't know
[1:04:06] but when you look at it the plan itself
[1:04:09] and I believe this is a real walk of
[1:04:12] faith because to think of it that how
[1:04:14] that God would send in a message to each
[1:04:17] generation or and you know God he God
[1:04:21] has faith that his word is gonna produce
[1:04:26] God's not wondering he's not if God you
[1:04:29] know then remember he doesn't look at
[1:04:31] your ups he doesn't look at your downs
[1:04:33] God knows his word is going to produce
[1:04:37] within our lives think back to the
[1:04:40] service brother Stephen a Bali was
[1:04:42] dealing with remember on the sowing of
[1:04:44] the word think back to the service we're
[1:04:46] dealing with in the family sowing for
[1:04:47] the supernatural we're live
[1:04:49] upon that word and noticing drawing
[1:04:52] strength from that God's Word will not
[1:04:55] return to Him void it's true every one
[1:04:59] of us the reality of it is we are not
[1:05:02] where we want to be we're not because
[1:05:07] the reality there's a life within us
[1:05:09] that there is a desire to be closer to
[1:05:12] the Lord a desire that to see more of
[1:05:15] him in us and less of us it's a desire
[1:05:19] and we're yet at the same time we we
[1:05:22] have to look and rejoice that were not
[1:05:24] where we used to be it's very important
[1:05:31] for that recognizing he that brought you
[1:05:33] from there brought you to where you are
[1:05:36] is the same God that will continue to
[1:05:39] perform his word until it has fulfilled
[1:05:43] what he has determined it's just like in
[1:05:47] every one of our lives as believers the
[1:05:50] plan that's unfolded for our lives
[1:05:52] there's things no doubt maybe you know
[1:05:55] where you're at or where I'm at and you
[1:05:56] know today we would never have thought
[1:05:58] we would have been here some years ago
[1:06:00] whatever vocation or whatever you're
[1:06:02] doing where you live and whatever more
[1:06:04] but you know this is something that is
[1:06:06] Gretz marvelous is how God's plan
[1:06:09] unfolds for us as believers it's to
[1:06:13] trust him and say Lord I don't know the
[1:06:15] next step I don't know the next fold but
[1:06:18] one thing that I do know is I want to be
[1:06:20] in the center of your will I just want
[1:06:24] to serve you Lord in whatever the next
[1:06:26] chapter is and has the plan unfolds I
[1:06:29] want to serve you in a greater measuring
[1:06:32] and the serving and a greater measure is
[1:06:34] us actually surrendering more to him
[1:06:37] aren't you glad that he provides that
[1:06:41] you see the scripture it goes on and it
[1:06:43] says it like this you know in in John 14
[1:06:46] it says let not your heart be troubled
[1:06:49] you believe in God believe also in me
[1:06:52] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:06:55] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:06:58] and I go to prepare a place for you and
[1:07:01] if I go
[1:07:02] place for you I will come again and
[1:07:05] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:07:07] there ye may be also now watch out
[1:07:11] brother branham picking this up in my
[1:07:13] father's house are many mansions and
[1:07:15] things that are to be he says in my
[1:07:17] father's house is many kinds of mansions
[1:07:20] I don't believe that when we get to
[1:07:22] heaven that we will be just everybody
[1:07:25] look exactly alike I don't believe we'll
[1:07:28] all be blondes or brunettes or little or
[1:07:30] all big or all giants
[1:07:32] I'll take comfort there's gonna be some
[1:07:34] big people there but once brother I'm
[1:07:39] saying now listen listen to me now
[1:07:40] remember all wrongs will be made right
[1:07:43] there's no doubt about it sometimes we
[1:07:46] have maybe birth defects or whatever
[1:07:48] more but let me tell you something there
[1:07:49] is a birth that takes place that there
[1:07:52] is no defect it's an effect that birth
[1:07:55] effect upon our soul will lead to this
[1:07:58] body actually being changed and brought
[1:08:01] in to match that birth that's been on
[1:08:03] the inside it's not a defect it's an
[1:08:06] effect so here all things will be made
[1:08:10] right in that time they'll send it well
[1:08:11] I know brother so-and-so well I know
[1:08:13] sister so-and-so absolutely you'll know
[1:08:15] me you'll recognize them I believe that
[1:08:18] God look what look I brings this out I
[1:08:20] believe that God is a God of variety the
[1:08:23] world proves that he's got big mountains
[1:08:26] little mountains got plains he's got
[1:08:28] deserts he's got different things
[1:08:30] because he made it the way he wanted it
[1:08:33] he made the season summer winter spring
[1:08:36] and autumn
[1:08:37] he made the seasons it shows he's a God
[1:08:39] a variety he made you in a variety now
[1:08:46] watch our brother man says this some men
[1:08:48] are real blusterous and some are real
[1:08:53] dogmatic others are fine others are kind
[1:08:58] and you just find all different kinds of
[1:09:01] people
[1:09:02] and in his kingdom Oh Lord there's
[1:09:08] blusterous people in his kingdom
[1:09:10] yeah there's dogmatic people in his
[1:09:13] kingdom you know
[1:09:14] there's kind people yeah there's fine
[1:09:17] people yeah all kinds are in his kingdom
[1:09:22] but say no why would it be that way well
[1:09:25] my goodness friends that's not even a
[1:09:28] question for us to ask it's simply to
[1:09:30] rest in the part that God has made a
[1:09:33] variety you know God can take different
[1:09:35] people you know sometimes you can know
[1:09:37] people and if you don't really come to
[1:09:39] understand the people I'm talking about
[1:09:41] understand a person's heart you might
[1:09:44] come into and you talk with somebody you
[1:09:45] think man there are rough character but
[1:09:48] you know what sometimes what it is you
[1:09:50] just don't know their heart I've come to
[1:09:52] find out of places that I've traveled
[1:09:53] here over the past few years I've met
[1:09:55] some individuals that probably you know
[1:09:57] that maybe some of us would say my
[1:09:59] there's some rough characters but their
[1:10:00] heart their heart is huge they have such
[1:10:03] a big heart I mean it's full of love and
[1:10:06] yet you know just looking on the outer
[1:10:08] the exterior and those things you would
[1:10:11] just want to classify them this way but
[1:10:13] notice brother branham never put him out
[1:10:15] of the kingdom of God
[1:10:16] he's showing how things can be divinely
[1:10:19] placed he's not one that's going to lead
[1:10:21] us into false evidences but there is a
[1:10:24] true evidence glory be to God now watch
[1:10:29] this this is such a learning point for
[1:10:31] us he says look at st. Peter and judge
[1:10:34] him by Andrew Andrew is that prayer
[1:10:41] warrior just stayed on his knees all the
[1:10:44] time an Apostle Peter was one of those
[1:10:47] firebrands that preached Paul was more
[1:10:50] scholarly like luck the Prophet or
[1:10:53] something had set back see this all
[1:10:55] three were different and yet they were
[1:10:59] all in the kingdom and they were all
[1:11:01] necessary all of the scholarly life the
[1:11:05] firebrand and the rare lawyer all of
[1:11:09] that was necessary and a part of the
[1:11:11] body remember this is God's doing this
[1:11:17] is God's doing but notice if he says if
[1:11:21] you try to judge st. Peter by Andrew you
[1:11:25] see this is where Paul told us and he
[1:11:26] told the Corinthians he said
[1:11:28] that judged themselves by themselves are
[1:11:31] fools we are never to judge ourselves
[1:11:34] and compare ourselves among one another
[1:11:36] we are never to judge ourselves and
[1:11:39] compare ourselves with another Church no
[1:11:41] it is a sovereign work in a local body
[1:11:44] it's what is God's mind and will for our
[1:11:48] lives I told you you know I know I
[1:11:50] haven't traveled as much as maybe some
[1:11:52] brothers and that's fine with me it
[1:11:54] wouldn't bother me if I didn't travel at
[1:11:55] all but you know just a little bit that
[1:11:57] I've went with in the past three years
[1:11:59] I'll tell you what I'll find such
[1:12:01] differences I find you know what I as I
[1:12:04] stand and I talk you know with the
[1:12:06] different pastors and things like that
[1:12:08] and ministers I find that each one of
[1:12:10] them although we're here aiming for the
[1:12:12] same purpose but each one has a unique
[1:12:14] approach to the Word of God and how that
[1:12:17] God is so gifted him I'll tell you what
[1:12:19] I think God for such a wonderful bouquet
[1:12:21] I thank God for that God knows what you
[1:12:24] and I needed in there right God knows I
[1:12:27] love red flowers but I like pink ones
[1:12:29] too I like pink ones I like red ones but
[1:12:31] I like white ones too God has a great
[1:12:34] bouquet and he knows what he's doing and
[1:12:36] all of those things coming together they
[1:12:39] show the differences but yet it
[1:12:41] complements one another and just as much
[1:12:44] as this is here where you cannot judge
[1:12:46] one by the other it's the same way
[1:12:48] within our homes
[1:12:50] you know you can't judge one child
[1:12:51] against another I could not tell Paul or
[1:12:54] Benjamin or Zachary I cannot say to them
[1:12:57] and say hey Ben why don't you be like
[1:12:58] Paul immediately I'm sowing division
[1:13:01] between them immediately I am placing
[1:13:04] that this is a higher standard and you
[1:13:06] need to be like him but really what it
[1:13:08] comes to is that within them and you
[1:13:11] know within your own children every one
[1:13:12] of them are different now they get some
[1:13:15] of those differences all of the the
[1:13:17] mixing and everything that comes
[1:13:18] together it comes right from the
[1:13:21] homemade pot you're right it depends on
[1:13:25] how much they got of this and how much
[1:13:27] they got of that and they may have got
[1:13:28] 1/4 a teaspoon of this half a teaspoon
[1:13:30] of this they might have got a cup of
[1:13:32] this but whatever it is the mixture
[1:13:34] listen God knows what he's doing and
[1:13:37] within it though you and I maybe if
[1:13:40] you've got real little kids
[1:13:41] now you know you don't really maybe see
[1:13:43] the things maybe with the makeup and the
[1:13:45] temperament and these things here right
[1:13:46] now but you can start seeing little
[1:13:48] things but I'll tell you what when they
[1:13:50] get older you're able to look at things
[1:13:52] that you're working with and trying to
[1:13:53] help them to understand and you look
[1:13:55] back at baby pictures and say aha there
[1:13:57] it was right there
[1:13:58] uh-huh there was a three years old ah
[1:14:00] there it was at four years old you see
[1:14:02] what it is it's something that's come it
[1:14:04] was always there but now it's a season
[1:14:09] for us to be alerted to it to help guide
[1:14:12] it so that this shaft of this arrow this
[1:14:15] shaft does not end up wobbly and bent
[1:14:19] and crooked because this shaft of an
[1:14:22] arrow it's got to be on this end and
[1:14:24] this end it's got to be firm but right
[1:14:26] here it's got to be flexible and that's
[1:14:29] the same way it is with each of our
[1:14:31] lives there's a part of our life that's
[1:14:33] got to be so firm with knowing who we
[1:14:36] are in the Lord Jesus Christ and yet
[1:14:39] there has to be such a part about us of
[1:14:42] recognizing that we must be flexible to
[1:14:45] his working which means dying to
[1:14:48] ourselves oh so how could we judge Peter
[1:14:54] by Andrew
[1:14:56] well we need to put end-around put Peter
[1:14:58] in or pit feeder out and put Andrew in
[1:15:00] so we don't judge by that right there
[1:15:04] little rabito God brother BAM you know
[1:15:07] he picks this up and keeps working with
[1:15:09] this thought and I'm not gonna read the
[1:15:11] whole thing here but Road I'm will keep
[1:15:13] coming back and said notice many kinds
[1:15:16] of mentions he goes into in the quote 49
[1:15:19] there he says he talks about many kinds
[1:15:21] of Hills many kinds of River Springs and
[1:15:24] lakes he says you know will you come
[1:15:26] here first because the kindness of your
[1:15:28] heavenly father placed them here because
[1:15:30] some men like mountains some likes
[1:15:32] waters some likes deserts my now watch
[1:15:37] he placed him here because if you like
[1:15:40] deserts he put the desert for you if you
[1:15:43] like mountains he did it for you if you
[1:15:46] like waters he did it for you did he
[1:15:50] have to do that no you see what brother
[1:15:53] branham yield and listen to me now
[1:15:55] brother Bellamy yielded to the Lord and
[1:15:58] God is letting you and I know of his
[1:16:01] care for our lives
[1:16:03] these things that might seem so menial
[1:16:06] and it would seem like it doesn't matter
[1:16:08] at all but listen friends in order for
[1:16:10] doctrine and for the word to work and
[1:16:12] move within our life there must be a
[1:16:14] relationship and the Lord Jesus himself
[1:16:17] shows even in this right here little
[1:16:20] simple things that sometimes we pass
[1:16:23] over but they are keys to unlocking the
[1:16:26] channel for us to surrender more to him
[1:16:29] and that is that he's showing by these
[1:16:31] things that you and I can look at it and
[1:16:33] say wow I really like those mountains
[1:16:35] men are in luck that rivers mile really
[1:16:37] like those things I really like that
[1:16:39] that's God trying to show I care I know
[1:16:41] that it's in your nature to lock those
[1:16:44] things and I want you to see I've
[1:16:46] already provided that here in this than
[1:16:50] to realize if he did that in the natural
[1:16:52] landscape how much more is he provided
[1:16:54] in the spiritual landscape how much more
[1:16:57] has he provided for you and I all along
[1:17:00] this journey for what you and I have
[1:17:02] need of aren't you glad for that
[1:17:04] Braham says now he says you're coming
[1:17:08] knew your nature and what you would be
[1:17:11] so he made it just the way that you
[1:17:14] could enjoy it
[1:17:17] so this wasn't this is what's for dinner
[1:17:20] eat it or refuse it no he knew think of
[1:17:25] this he knew things that would minister
[1:17:28] to you things that you would look at and
[1:17:31] say that's not even spiritual but yet
[1:17:33] God knew you and I here we are friends
[1:17:36] though every part of us is not spiritual
[1:17:39] there's a part about us and this part
[1:17:41] that I'm dealing with here this morning
[1:17:43] it's not a spiritual part but it needs
[1:17:46] ministry
[1:17:47] it needs ministry and God has so said it
[1:17:53] that it might be ministered to our lives
[1:17:56] I say Lord let me hear the voice let me
[1:18:01] hear your voice Lord as you speak to my
[1:18:04] heart upon your providential care for my
[1:18:08] life you believe God wants you to be
[1:18:11] happy you believe that I believe it I
[1:18:16] just there were the some of the things
[1:18:18] I've looked at for weeks and things now
[1:18:19] however what is it 47 muscles it takes
[1:18:22] in your face to frown now I know we look
[1:18:25] at that how I know that brother Simon
[1:18:27] but think about it it takes more work to
[1:18:29] frown and it only takes 17 to smile it's
[1:18:39] something in it we were made and
[1:18:41] ordained to be happy I could read you a
[1:18:46] litany of quotes on those things right
[1:18:48] there where brother BAM could go through
[1:18:49] it we ought to be the happiest people in
[1:18:52] the world now listen that part right
[1:18:54] there it's not something that can be
[1:18:56] demanded it isn't something that I say
[1:18:58] in automatic you say right away I'm
[1:19:00] gonna be happy I'm gonna turn this frown
[1:19:02] upside down no no this is not mind over
[1:19:04] matter but in order remember if that's
[1:19:06] how we're supposed to be then we need to
[1:19:09] make sure we get all the knobs and
[1:19:10] everything and looking at it and look to
[1:19:13] see is my enemy working upon my enemy
[1:19:17] and I need to really look
[1:19:20] that and discern it and withstand it hmm
[1:19:25] so God knows all these things about as a
[1:19:28] matter of fact brother Ram will say like
[1:19:29] this in the unveiling of God I don't
[1:19:31] time to read it but every Bell he likens
[1:19:34] God's molding and bringing our life
[1:19:36] every Bell had so much silver so much
[1:19:39] bronze so much copper because they had
[1:19:40] to get a certain team absolutely now
[1:19:46] watch our brother Bram says this here I
[1:19:48] love this quotes questions and answers
[1:19:51] 1959 he refers out of their the book of
[1:19:54] Ephesians in love he's chosen us in in
[1:19:57] love before the foundation of the world
[1:19:59] predestiny so watch that word having
[1:20:01] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:20:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:20:06] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:20:08] will what about that brother Mike isn't
[1:20:10] that wonderful
[1:20:11] uh every time over the years I've read
[1:20:13] this quote I read my name in there isn't
[1:20:16] that wonderful brother Samuel I'm in
[1:20:20] here he loved you he loves you before
[1:20:25] there was a world he knowed your nature
[1:20:29] he knowed your weaknesses he knowed your
[1:20:34] habits aren't you glad I'm not God and
[1:20:37] you're not God we'd have been having
[1:20:41] them running 40-yard dash and see if
[1:20:43] they can what kind of time you got it
[1:20:44] what kind of can you do this again o
[1:20:46] weaknesses no and yet we and ourselves
[1:20:50] are filled with weaknesses glory be to
[1:20:57] God habits but you see God look God
[1:21:01] didn't choose based on weaknesses he did
[1:21:03] not choose based on habits because if it
[1:21:05] had been that way we would have never
[1:21:07] been chosen but he knew about all of
[1:21:10] this
[1:21:11] but his choosing is based on that of
[1:21:14] himself
[1:21:18] he knowed all about you what you was
[1:21:22] going to be and then when he looked all
[1:21:25] over the great universe as it was he
[1:21:27] said I choose you and when he did that
[1:21:29] before there was ever a speck of life
[1:21:31] than your eternal with God when you
[1:21:34] receive the Holy Ghost then you become
[1:21:36] eternal because you're with God you're a
[1:21:38] part of god you're as eternal as God is
[1:21:41] now throughout the Scriptures you're
[1:21:44] aware of you're aware in the scriptures
[1:21:46] of how that when God would set the stars
[1:21:50] there in the heavens and you notice of
[1:21:54] how that things that are even wrote even
[1:21:57] throughout the Old Testament of many of
[1:21:59] the things where it would describe many
[1:22:02] of the constellations you know our
[1:22:04] Taurus Orion please he would go into
[1:22:07] that of even seek Him who make it for
[1:22:10] seven stars and Orion those statements
[1:22:14] would be made regarding the
[1:22:15] constellations which the stars
[1:22:17] themselves would be rays of light or
[1:22:19] that of light and to think of how that
[1:22:21] the Prophet now wants you to watch on he
[1:22:23] goes into this here that brother Brandon
[1:22:25] will actually move into a place here and
[1:22:27] he's letting us know that what the Lord
[1:22:30] Jesus did before that what God did in
[1:22:33] Christ
[1:22:34] it's Christ who still comes and he moves
[1:22:38] and he works within our life and brother
[1:22:40] webb says he uses our tabernacle and
[1:22:44] right after he makes that statement
[1:22:46] about how that he uses our tabernacle
[1:22:48] now in truth be known he does not use
[1:22:51] your tabernacle or my tabernacle because
[1:22:54] it is somewhat fitted better because it
[1:22:56] has certain things that are better than
[1:22:58] somebody else or whatever more that's
[1:22:59] not how God chooses to use us as a
[1:23:02] matter of fact God has a real sense of
[1:23:04] humor he will call you and ask you to do
[1:23:07] things that are entirely against your
[1:23:10] nature and it's God will do things in
[1:23:12] that manner so that he himself alone can
[1:23:16] receive the glory and mold and shape and
[1:23:18] my we can go for examples down through
[1:23:20] the scripture it is by no means because
[1:23:23] that we and ourselves are able to do it
[1:23:26] we've seen the failures of that Moses
[1:23:28] failed though having knowledge of the
[1:23:30] word
[1:23:31] but it was not about Moses performing it
[1:23:33] it's about Moses surrendering to God and
[1:23:36] allowing God to perform it right it
[1:23:41] would have made sense for God to call
[1:23:42] somebody who could be a great orator
[1:23:44] he's got a message to bring after all
[1:23:47] why would God call a stutterer
[1:23:52] he said he was of a slow tone but you
[1:23:57] see God received glory think of that
[1:24:01] Moses had to surrender it wasn't just
[1:24:04] his mouth Moses had to surrender his
[1:24:07] pride to think to stand in the council
[1:24:11] he knew what it was to stand in the
[1:24:13] counsel of Pharaoh's court where all the
[1:24:16] great dignitaries would be and to be
[1:24:18] able to call to stand there and make
[1:24:20] statements like this when you're already
[1:24:22] the outcast of Egypt when they already
[1:24:24] think you're not but yet God would call
[1:24:27] him and has ordained him to stand there
[1:24:29] and God is not looking about his ability
[1:24:32] that's why God says Moses stop all the
[1:24:35] excuses it's not changing my plan I'm
[1:24:38] still gonna use you so when we get
[1:24:42] through all these excuses here because
[1:24:44] you're trying to make your weaknesses
[1:24:46] excuses or reasons you know sometimes we
[1:24:50] think humility is looking down on
[1:24:51] ourselves
[1:24:52] that's not humility humility is not
[1:24:55] thinking less of yourself it's thinking
[1:24:59] of yourself less not thinking more
[1:25:03] highly than we ought to think so God
[1:25:05] brings Moses to this place to rest and
[1:25:07] to trust in Him now what's wrong brother
[1:25:09] Ram uses this right after this point in
[1:25:12] questions that answer 64
[1:25:13] he said now notice this person that's in
[1:25:16] you you are John Doe you were born in a
[1:25:19] certain month you were born under a
[1:25:22] certain star you were born under a
[1:25:25] certain thing and that has something to
[1:25:27] do with you the program's not telling us
[1:25:30] to go seek out astrologers
[1:25:33] star gazers that's not what he's
[1:25:35] pointing out here but he is letting us
[1:25:37] know that all of the things with the
[1:25:39] stars themselves all of the birth paths
[1:25:41] and all of this has an effect upon our
[1:25:44] life hoga brother Samuel would somebody
[1:25:47] gets born of the Holy Ghost that don't
[1:25:50] make that statement yet because there's
[1:25:51] more to come brother Branham goes into
[1:25:56] it when you know reading this statement
[1:25:58] you know his daddy told him about
[1:26:01] planting potatoes planted at a certain
[1:26:03] time when the moon's at a certain phase
[1:26:04] and brother Brad said I ain't planting
[1:26:07] potatoes on the moon daddy and his daddy
[1:26:09] said go ahead smart aleck program goes
[1:26:13] into how that the moon the light the
[1:26:15] reflection it has an effect on the
[1:26:18] growth but I'm spends two paragraphs
[1:26:21] within that and then he comes right back
[1:26:23] around and says sure it's got something
[1:26:25] to do then it goes into why did Aaron
[1:26:28] have on his breast plate the birthstone
[1:26:31] of each one of those patriarchs the
[1:26:33] burnt stones did not drop out of heaven
[1:26:36] they were already here on earth but for
[1:26:38] choosing the positioning was already set
[1:26:42] in God's mind but God had things on
[1:26:44] earth that would reflect the positioning
[1:26:47] of where his children would be so those
[1:26:50] birth stones were carried into the
[1:26:52] presence of God not on the back of Haran
[1:26:56] but they were carried across his hearts
[1:26:58] let me tell you something you and I we
[1:27:00] have been there in the presence of God
[1:27:03] our names on the Lamb's Book of Life it
[1:27:06] has been there before there was a speck
[1:27:08] of eons of time we were always there and
[1:27:11] represented in him and in his choosing
[1:27:14] he knew exactly what bit of time that we
[1:27:18] would come forth the birth stone that
[1:27:20] you and I would be born under just as
[1:27:22] much as you and I were born under a
[1:27:24] natural star in a certain month we have
[1:27:27] been born under a spiritual star under a
[1:27:30] certain time under a certain season a
[1:27:33] certain age for a certain work glory be
[1:27:38] to God
[1:27:41] well he says look at those mothers when
[1:27:43] they gave the utterance when them
[1:27:45] mothers and them Hebrew women in labor
[1:27:47] giving utterance to bring those them
[1:27:49] children being born it placed their name
[1:27:52] he had told their birth yet put him in
[1:27:54] the homeland it sent him over into
[1:27:56] eternity but Adam goes on to it he says
[1:27:58] now sometime I want to take that he said
[1:28:01] what's Jacob when he was dying here when
[1:28:03] he laid his hands upon the patriarchs
[1:28:05] and blessed them he was telling them
[1:28:07] exactly where they would be
[1:28:09] that's according to their name exactly
[1:28:11] according to their birth and sure it has
[1:28:14] something to do with you now watch how
[1:28:17] he goes into this now that's your birth
[1:28:19] path that's what you are a natural man
[1:28:23] or natural woman but when you're reborn
[1:28:26] again that's not the outside conscience
[1:28:29] the outside is what you see taste feel
[1:28:32] smell and hear but the inside of that is
[1:28:36] what you really hard now this out here
[1:28:39] he's talking about this out here this
[1:28:40] birth path out here this out here Satan
[1:28:43] just tempts you and knocks you around
[1:28:46] everywhere here but down here you can't
[1:28:48] do it unless you let him do it but see
[1:28:52] you're able to stand your ground firmly
[1:28:54] here when you're also able to discern
[1:28:56] this out here glory be to God birth
[1:29:01] passes birth path is important in it
[1:29:04] well let's just watch here just for a
[1:29:06] little bit
[1:29:07] brother Graham says now notice for in
[1:29:09] here you've got faith and faith don't
[1:29:11] come from the outer conscience it
[1:29:12] reasons but in faith
[1:29:14] there's no reason you've got it from God
[1:29:16] and you know it's there I don't care how
[1:29:18] much it looks wrong you still know it's
[1:29:20] right
[1:29:20] it's thus saith the Lord and there's
[1:29:22] nothing going to bother that nothing can
[1:29:24] bother it it's moving right straight on
[1:29:27] difficult means nothing to it it raids
[1:29:30] right through it for its steward so the
[1:29:35] outer conscience under that birth path
[1:29:37] can stand in opposition but the inside
[1:29:41] man omaha standing on this says the lord
[1:29:45] it'll go completely against that outer
[1:29:47] conscience as a matter of fact the outer
[1:29:50] conscience will say you can't do this
[1:29:51] you shouldn't do this
[1:29:53] this isn't for you but that inside man
[1:29:55] will stand there and said I can't
[1:29:57] explain it there isn't even anything but
[1:30:00] I could put together as far as factual
[1:30:02] but it's just something that I know and
[1:30:05] you stand there by that inner birth path
[1:30:12] glory be to God now watch this
[1:30:15] questions and answers part 3 1964 now
[1:30:19] here's brother Branham dealing with the
[1:30:21] sister that she's had a question on
[1:30:24] whether or not she's had the Holy Ghost
[1:30:26] and brother bamas talking about talking
[1:30:28] to the sister here and he talks about
[1:30:30] how that he says you know I've talked to
[1:30:33] a medicine buddy this morning in an
[1:30:34] interview and he said I guess that
[1:30:36] person is still here and the person is a
[1:30:39] genuine person a real person they've
[1:30:41] lived right and they've heard me say the
[1:30:43] evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:30:45] speaking in tongues and it isn't but
[1:30:51] what's that say go ahead say I oh it's
[1:30:56] not even up there why what happened
[1:31:02] it's on the email you look at this I
[1:31:06] advised I advised that person oh my lord
[1:31:13] well this would make great things for
[1:31:15] school for the scoffers right but it's
[1:31:17] because they don't understand the wisdom
[1:31:18] of God I advise that person to ask God
[1:31:25] to let them either speak in tongues or
[1:31:26] prophesy
[1:31:27] because it's the nature you mean God
[1:31:33] cares about that outer birth path yeah
[1:31:36] yeah because he's the one to sing to it
[1:31:39] the certain month the certain star and
[1:31:41] the certain sign so he understands that
[1:31:45] and he cares about that
[1:31:50] aren't you glad that God finds the
[1:31:53] problem aren't you grateful for that
[1:31:55] notice what brother Brennan goes in here
[1:31:57] saying I love this the first thing I
[1:32:00] went to that person and found their
[1:32:04] birthplace so before he's talked to him
[1:32:06] he said the very first thing I did I
[1:32:08] went to that person and found their
[1:32:11] birthplace and what sign that they were
[1:32:14] born under and could tell what their
[1:32:17] birth was which way it set in their
[1:32:20] natural nature sets them in a certain
[1:32:23] line oh my goodness
[1:32:27] Miss Emma don't that weak in your faith
[1:32:29] it raises my faith because remember
[1:32:34] faith worketh by love he's expressing
[1:32:39] his care for our lives sometimes friends
[1:32:42] and listen I think sometimes this is not
[1:32:45] a product of the message the message
[1:32:46] does not blow us up with pride that's
[1:32:49] not a product of the message that's
[1:32:52] where it gets in that outer intellectual
[1:32:54] realm and we think we know something but
[1:32:57] when it really really look at these
[1:32:59] parts within here
[1:33:00] God is not bypassing this woman and
[1:33:02] saying I'll tell you what you just need
[1:33:04] to have faith in the word you just got
[1:33:06] to believe the word what if she had been
[1:33:09] something that somebody would have just
[1:33:11] been preaching that to a preaching that
[1:33:12] to her it had never helped her although
[1:33:14] that was the truth but you see the
[1:33:19] Prophet here leading under the
[1:33:21] leadership of the Lord you see the
[1:33:23] Prophet was not a nut whew he was not an
[1:33:28] oddball as far as making himself odd he
[1:33:33] was a submitted channel of God and you
[1:33:37] know what God manifests right through
[1:33:40] this ministry in this hour that he cares
[1:33:44] he cares aren't you glad notice he said
[1:33:49] then when they're reborn again they're
[1:33:52] over here in another nature so when
[1:33:54] we're reborn again were then in another
[1:33:56] nature now he says that's you find this
[1:33:59] nature that's the inside the inside
[1:34:01] conscience the outside conscience moves
[1:34:04] you in one way that's your natural birth
[1:34:06] then they'll make up something and it
[1:34:09] put some what under a for whatever
[1:34:12] something like that numerology birth
[1:34:15] Path birth number under a for and it
[1:34:17] puts them in a split condition they
[1:34:20] don't know what to do they'll say the
[1:34:23] Lord wants me to do this and the inside
[1:34:25] says I just know it lines up with the
[1:34:27] scripture and they'll start to do it and
[1:34:30] the first thing you know Satan on this
[1:34:32] outside will show them all kinds of
[1:34:34] defects in it anybody ever been there
[1:34:38] I've been there I've been there
[1:34:42] matter of fact I've been there in this
[1:34:44] very next statement as well but if you
[1:34:46] haven't been there you will be because
[1:34:50] remember it's by experience it's by
[1:34:54] experience notice this and then they'll
[1:34:57] say well I guess I and they listen to
[1:35:00] sing you've got to take that inside
[1:35:03] something and that's what the inside of
[1:35:06] you that's scriptural and don't let
[1:35:09] Staton stand anywhere that's his duty to
[1:35:13] stand there and pound at you like that
[1:35:16] but don't you listen to him that person
[1:35:18] I told him they said well I know if I
[1:35:20] could just be sure of having the Holy
[1:35:22] Ghost a dandy person real loyal person
[1:35:26] with the Holy Ghost but it would be good
[1:35:30] for her to say father just to give me
[1:35:34] this for something to stand on Bill
[1:35:38] Graham goes on to tell us I can't preach
[1:35:39] this as doctrine you say because you had
[1:35:41] people grabbing toward the wrong thing
[1:35:42] but you see here it is God dealing with
[1:35:45] individually it would be good for her
[1:35:47] aren't you glad that the Lord has
[1:35:48] ministered things for you and for me
[1:35:50] that's been good for you than good for
[1:35:53] me aren't you glad God might have had a
[1:35:56] strain maybe had a minister come in
[1:35:58] maybe you were somewhere else maybe it
[1:35:59] was something that here you are
[1:36:01] listening to the message and brother BAM
[1:36:03] will just go into actually telling a
[1:36:04] little story and then working something
[1:36:07] around and all of a sudden something
[1:36:08] will click it'll come around and right
[1:36:11] then in there it just seems to open to
[1:36:13] you
[1:36:14] that is God's care for you and me oh my
[1:36:18] it's so precious not to think of this
[1:36:21] here you know the Bible when we look at
[1:36:23] it because you know no matter of how
[1:36:26] Holy Ghost filled the parents would be
[1:36:28] the genes of the children are still the
[1:36:30] genes of father and mother still that
[1:36:32] way and we still have
[1:36:33] inherited physical and emotional traits
[1:36:36] but yet God has a plan the Bible says in
[1:36:39] second Corinthians 5:17 therefore if any
[1:36:42] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:36:45] all things are passed away behold all
[1:36:49] things are new brother Graham takes the
[1:36:53] scripture over and over and brings it
[1:36:56] home for us it's an inner work within
[1:36:59] our lives a change has taken place a new
[1:37:04] creation in the same old temple now if
[1:37:13] we and I would have had our choice we
[1:37:15] would have said Lord and I get the new
[1:37:18] birth
[1:37:19] I want the glorified body as well I want
[1:37:22] my feel thing and so that human spirit
[1:37:24] go ahead and change it out right now
[1:37:25] but remember all of this is for our
[1:37:28] proving it's our testings right without
[1:37:32] the trials of life without the tests of
[1:37:34] life without the molding in our life
[1:37:36] where would our fletching be on our
[1:37:38] arrow how would we fly you with me so
[1:37:43] notice how God has it here there is a
[1:37:45] outer nature and there's an intern a
[1:37:48] church we've been looking at this year
[1:37:49] now notice this program says when in the
[1:37:51] message when divine love is projected
[1:37:53] when you become a son or daughter of God
[1:37:55] your disposition changes your attitude
[1:37:59] changes your all your look towards the
[1:38:02] life and towards others changes it
[1:38:05] doesn't mean you've joined the church it
[1:38:07] means you've been regenerated you become
[1:38:09] a new creation and cries and the old
[1:38:11] things have passed away and God has
[1:38:14] spoken to you and you have become a new
[1:38:16] creation so the Holy Spirit
[1:38:20] he now sets down on the throne of our
[1:38:25] heart that inner disposition is changed
[1:38:31] the darkness that was there that was
[1:38:34] covering that light that seed that was
[1:38:37] there that germ of life the darkness has
[1:38:40] been removed and the light has come to
[1:38:43] quicken what he
[1:38:44] already sewed and node was there but
[1:38:48] what about all my weaknesses what about
[1:38:50] the habits remember the quote that we
[1:38:52] read he knowed your nature not all of
[1:38:55] that but God knows one thing if I can
[1:38:57] move and I come to the innermost part
[1:39:00] but not of the throne of your heart if I
[1:39:03] am seated there I will absolutely be
[1:39:07] able to exert control over all these
[1:39:10] things because after all if you want to
[1:39:13] change the kingdom you change the king
[1:39:17] you change the administration and once
[1:39:20] the administration changes there'll be
[1:39:22] changes in the kingdom changes don't
[1:39:26] come overnight but changes are coming it
[1:39:29] becomes a kingdom of change that leads
[1:39:30] to change change change from glory unto
[1:39:33] glory unto glory unto glory glory and
[1:39:41] when Christ this is why people are so
[1:39:44] tossed about when Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:39:47] comes into your heart he is in you with
[1:39:51] your temperament
[1:39:59] so the new birth did not do away with my
[1:40:02] temperament then do away with yours oh
[1:40:05] so that's why there's some that's
[1:40:07] dogmatic some that's blusterous it's not
[1:40:10] saying that those things are okay you're
[1:40:13] with me because every one of us has
[1:40:15] strengths and we've got weaknesses and
[1:40:18] even in what is a strength can become a
[1:40:21] hindrance if it's not yielded to God
[1:40:23] Abraham was strong in faith but
[1:40:26] Abraham's faith could not make Ishmael
[1:40:27] the promised son so all of our strengths
[1:40:31] all of our weaknesses have got to be
[1:40:33] yielded to the Lord if there's anything
[1:40:36] today we think bla think I think I've
[1:40:38] really got something that could be a
[1:40:39] real and real added benefit you run as
[1:40:41] the Oh Lord
[1:40:41] help me that's already a thought of
[1:40:44] backsliding right there
[1:40:45] I'm already drifting from your presence
[1:40:47] that I need you Lord Jesus
[1:40:49] not by power not by might but by my
[1:40:51] spirit saith the Lord
[1:40:53] when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into
[1:40:56] your heart he is
[1:40:57] in you with your temperament and he is
[1:41:00] living his own life through his own will
[1:41:03] through you oh he said I know that
[1:41:05] sounds awful but it's right Christ
[1:41:08] so yielded you are that Christ speaks
[1:41:11] the kind of words he would speaks he
[1:41:13] thinks the kind of thoughts he would
[1:41:14] think through you he does the kind of
[1:41:17] works he would do through you you are
[1:41:19] yielding and rested what a beautiful
[1:41:22] picture of a consecrated Christian
[1:41:24] yielded God is working through huh if I
[1:41:30] was choosing what temperament to put on
[1:41:32] their mind I wouldn't have put on my
[1:41:34] temperament maybe I ought to get to
[1:41:36] looking at the other code of Tim oh no I
[1:41:37] don't know about that one Lord I'd like
[1:41:40] to have this right here I'd like to have
[1:41:42] this one with this and this is what I
[1:41:44] don't want that I'll hey you know what
[1:41:46] that is that's the earnest of the body
[1:41:47] change because over there all wrongs
[1:41:52] will be made right you realize that's
[1:41:56] why we know the body change it's not
[1:41:57] about you and I just going back to young
[1:41:59] people we'd end up in the same mess
[1:42:01] we're in now it's got to be a change
[1:42:04] completely do you realize it's not going
[1:42:09] to be on the other side where I said
[1:42:10] well this person pushes my buttons and
[1:42:12] this person pushes my buttons remember
[1:42:14] you won't have those buttons to be
[1:42:15] pushed and they won't have fingers to
[1:42:18] push them even then that going to be
[1:42:21] wonderful
[1:42:23] glory be to God in the highest well why
[1:42:27] wait glory glory glory Paul said to me
[1:42:34] to live is Christ and to die is gain not
[1:42:37] me that liveth anymore but Christ that
[1:42:39] liveth in me Christ living in the
[1:42:41] individual so surrendered when Christ
[1:42:44] speaks through the lips thanks through
[1:42:46] the mind sees through the eye acts
[1:42:49] through the temperament
[1:42:53] acts through the temperament you cannot
[1:42:56] judge Peter by Andrew I am fearfully and
[1:43:00] wonderfully made and now I will praise
[1:43:04] thee how do we praise thee I bow down
[1:43:08] like when God revealed to Joshua the
[1:43:10] battle-plan of Jericho Joshua
[1:43:12] immediately went on the ground and said
[1:43:14] what would you have your servant do
[1:43:17] hallelujah think of this of think of the
[1:43:20] great marvel of how God would bring
[1:43:23] everything together in the body I want
[1:43:26] you to look at this this scripture just
[1:43:27] for a moment gonna turn there but in
[1:43:29] subscription we're familiar with an ax -
[1:43:31] verse 1 the Bible says when the day of
[1:43:33] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:43:35] with one Accord in one place see they
[1:43:40] came in one Accord not because the Holy
[1:43:43] Ghost had already come but they were
[1:43:46] waiting in expectation for his coming
[1:43:50] and it brought them into unity what's it
[1:43:54] doing that
[1:43:55] what has the message that God has sent
[1:43:59] to us the unfolding of Christ in the
[1:44:01] sound what does it do it brings the
[1:44:04] people of God together are uniting for
[1:44:08] what the promise
[1:44:09] so what are we united around that we're
[1:44:12] all the same no no if we had off we had
[1:44:16] our choices or we looked at it we
[1:44:18] thought what in the world is this group
[1:44:20] of people doing together but that's
[1:44:22] God's choosing that's God's choosing
[1:44:25] think about it in the in the early
[1:44:27] church how that you had those who were
[1:44:29] servants you had masters and you know
[1:44:32] what they set in the same views and
[1:44:34] shouted one was a servant and the other
[1:44:37] one was their master and they shouted
[1:44:39] you had a kind people of different
[1:44:41] degrees different origin you had rich
[1:44:42] you had poor you had all sorts of people
[1:44:45] all kinds of backgrounds you had some
[1:44:47] that maybe their life was so pristine
[1:44:49] and thank God for that then you had
[1:44:51] other lives that Paul would have to be
[1:44:53] moved by the Spirit of God because they
[1:44:55] would get so caught and so jammed up
[1:44:57] within their mind and their conscience
[1:44:59] about their previous way of life and
[1:45:02] Paul
[1:45:02] let them know of the power of the
[1:45:04] redemptive flow of the blood of Jesus
[1:45:07] Christ and he would help them why so
[1:45:09] they could look beyond that and be able
[1:45:11] to do what he himself had done and that
[1:45:14] was learned to put the past behind me he
[1:45:19] had to do that
[1:45:20] you see that's God faithfully
[1:45:21] ministering to us as his children aren't
[1:45:23] you glad for that aren't you glad that
[1:45:25] y'all got don't look around say come on
[1:45:26] man get over it
[1:45:28] come on get over it
[1:45:32] you don't know what I've been through
[1:45:34] well I wasn't this way when y'all you
[1:45:36] don't know how I was when I was growing
[1:45:37] up
[1:45:38] get over it hey times have changed but
[1:45:40] God still the same see that was not the
[1:45:43] attitude that got applied that's not the
[1:45:46] attitude that even right here that the
[1:45:48] Prophet used at all it's not the
[1:45:50] attitude but what is it it's God
[1:45:52] ministering to you and I for what
[1:45:54] surrender surrender doesn't come by
[1:45:57] demands or commands surrender is
[1:46:00] submission and submission comes by love
[1:46:03] that is projected and when love itself
[1:46:05] is projected and comes to its end Grace
[1:46:07] will step in and take over and produce
[1:46:09] what love has called for so you're
[1:46:13] talking about having faith for the
[1:46:14] unfolding of God by the plan of God God
[1:46:17] has faith as he's watching the unfolding
[1:46:19] in our life God's not biting his nails
[1:46:24] bouncing up they're wringing his hands
[1:46:26] well no he's resting and his rest is
[1:46:33] exerted and moves upon us he reminds us
[1:46:37] over and over can I have just a few more
[1:46:40] moments they were all in one place with
[1:46:42] one Accord this this point this word
[1:46:45] right here one Accord or the phrase
[1:46:47] that's used you know it's used in
[1:46:48] multiple times throughout the book of
[1:46:50] Acts but this very scripture that's used
[1:46:52] or this word that's used out of the
[1:46:54] Greek it speaks of that which is like a
[1:46:56] great symphony where you have all types
[1:46:58] of notes that are being moved together
[1:47:00] and different pitches but they're all
[1:47:03] coming and running together in such
[1:47:05] unison of how that God would so set in
[1:47:08] the body even all the differences but
[1:47:12] all of it is necessary
[1:47:14] for his working God knew what he needed
[1:47:19] as he put Paul together oh but the same
[1:47:25] thing anybody could have done it that
[1:47:26] was yielded to the Lord no they couldn't
[1:47:29] have it's who God had for the job and
[1:47:31] God so fixed Paul's nature for that
[1:47:36] moment you understand as the Prophet
[1:47:39] tells us that God seeing the messenger
[1:47:42] of the age will so fix the nature of
[1:47:46] that man to catch the people of the hour
[1:47:50] that's God's doing
[1:47:53] oh my think of this let's look at this
[1:47:58] here with the Prophet just for a moment
[1:48:02] here it is as we looked at these
[1:48:04] statements of God acting through a
[1:48:05] temperament God acting through a
[1:48:09] temperament brother batam here he is you
[1:48:13] know he's already sent in a gun to the
[1:48:15] Winchester Factory and he's let him know
[1:48:17] something's wrong here it's not driving
[1:48:20] tacks straight in the in target they
[1:48:24] look at it and say was never meant to do
[1:48:26] that
[1:48:27] brother Brad said I know it can be done
[1:48:31] cuz I've already proved it
[1:48:32] see brother bran was trying to align and
[1:48:34] work it with the bead and everything
[1:48:36] else to get it to do what he already
[1:48:37] knew it could do so he was all worked up
[1:48:41] about this then here he is out in the
[1:48:45] woods squirrel hunting I know you're
[1:48:46] familiar with this but he says here I am
[1:48:48] he says I'm sitting under the tree and
[1:48:50] here's brother Woods and the rest of
[1:48:52] them up there banging it squirrels they
[1:48:54] hit him everywhere they want to front
[1:48:55] and anywhere you don't make any
[1:48:57] difference just as long as they hit the
[1:48:58] squirrel having a big time and I was
[1:49:01] sitting under a tree I started crying
[1:49:03] and I said Lord why did you make me a
[1:49:08] little nervous wreck
[1:49:09] why did you make me like this why can't
[1:49:13] I go out there and enjoy hunting what
[1:49:16] they do and have to have this gun in a
[1:49:18] super condition
[1:49:20] I waited there for about a half hour and
[1:49:24] laid down on my face and begin to cry
[1:49:27] and the Holy Spirit come to me and said
[1:49:31] I made you that way for a purpose that's
[1:49:35] for a purpose when one says one thing
[1:49:38] and hits loosely like that you can't
[1:49:40] stand it unless it's searing it has to
[1:49:42] be on the dot or it's not right I said I
[1:49:46] see the Lord you see how God moved on
[1:49:52] the scene at that time this was
[1:49:54] troubling to him God didn't just pass it
[1:49:58] off and say get over it
[1:50:00] snap out of it but God come and
[1:50:03] ministered why he needs to understand
[1:50:06] this if he doesn't he's always gonna be
[1:50:09] fighting what God had made him I would
[1:50:13] run so I could be like this and I wish I
[1:50:14] could be like this I wish I do just be
[1:50:16] what God made you to be surrendered to
[1:50:19] his will once you come into that it's
[1:50:24] rest you understand
[1:50:27] it's rest once God brought this to him
[1:50:30] he said I see now look at this how many
[1:50:33] years how many years brother brems has
[1:50:34] been ministering for how many years
[1:50:35] years
[1:50:37] how long's has been going on no doubt
[1:50:40] things that he's dealt with in his life
[1:50:42] think of this there's a part about his
[1:50:46] temperament is perfectionism that can be
[1:50:49] a positive that can be a negative it has
[1:50:52] to be governed by the Holy Ghost by no
[1:50:55] means was the Holy Spirit telling him
[1:50:57] here that your temperament is absolutely
[1:50:59] perfect but he's letting him know the
[1:51:01] conditions of things that you like
[1:51:03] things to be perfect that indeed I've
[1:51:05] made you that way for a purpose and
[1:51:07] brother Ram goes in to explain that to
[1:51:09] us he said because when the denomination
[1:51:12] says that God's killed or moved the same
[1:51:14] way he said I know that's a lie God
[1:51:17] moves the same way what he hit the
[1:51:20] target one time he'll hit it again you
[1:51:24] see that was not his spiritual nature
[1:51:26] that was that natural birth path whew
[1:51:31] but you see Liz Christ in there with his
[1:51:34] temperament and that temperament was so
[1:51:37] set for him for this age to carry the
[1:51:41] message and let me tell you something
[1:51:44] your temperament is set to carry the
[1:51:47] message horribie to God but we know we
[1:51:51] can't carry it but Christ can carry it
[1:51:52] through us hey man
[1:51:55] notice I've made you that way you know
[1:51:58] it might have been something let's just
[1:51:59] say I was like this let's just dramatize
[1:52:00] in a moment let's just say that maybe
[1:52:02] here he was the Prophet himself he's
[1:52:05] thinking why am I like this why is this
[1:52:07] way was that maybe he is a teenager
[1:52:09] maybe he's 20 years old still maybe 21
[1:52:12] and here his father comes up next to him
[1:52:15] and says son I understand let me guess
[1:52:21] you're thinking about this like this how
[1:52:25] do you know your of this gene pool
[1:52:33] relating helping him you see God doesn't
[1:52:38] want you despising your temperament
[1:52:40] oh brother Samuel all we needs the power
[1:52:43] of God this right here if you despise
[1:52:45] your temperament God can't move it's to
[1:52:49] let go and let God have his way just
[1:52:54] watch this how many times we hear
[1:52:56] brother brems say over and over if I can
[1:52:59] just get William random out of the way
[1:53:04] God can do things William Branham no
[1:53:09] it's nothing
[1:53:11] so it's to get it out of the way now
[1:53:14] watch this being content being content
[1:53:18] remember the scripture said by the grace
[1:53:20] of God I am what I am
[1:53:21] bill arraignment question answer says be
[1:53:23] thankful for all things I am thus
[1:53:27] because I am thus God made me what I am
[1:53:30] and I can't be nothing but what he made
[1:53:33] me melancholy and those kind of things
[1:53:36] they tell me I just have to be that way
[1:53:39] in order to be the help that he sent me
[1:53:42] here to be
[1:53:43] I want to be that kind of a person if
[1:53:46] that's the way I was supposed to be
[1:53:48] that's what I want to be whatever is the
[1:53:51] kingdom of God's will or God's will
[1:53:54] that's what I want to be he's at rest
[1:53:59] he's at rest with the temperament but it
[1:54:03] doesn't mean that he can just be at ease
[1:54:09] he's got a govern that temperament but
[1:54:15] he's not governing it with his own
[1:54:17] intellect
[1:54:19] he's governing it as a son of God
[1:54:24] he's been birthed by the Spirit of God
[1:54:28] the spirit of God is sitting right down
[1:54:31] there in the midst of his emotions in
[1:54:35] the midst of his temperament think of
[1:54:39] this how many times were brother brand
[1:54:41] himself look at this a part of it I
[1:54:43] don't have time to go through all the
[1:54:44] different temperaments and read these
[1:54:45] different things their strengths and
[1:54:47] weaknesses within each and every one but
[1:54:49] think of the number of times with
[1:54:50] perfectionism perfectionism one of the
[1:54:54] parts with melancholy is perfectionism
[1:54:56] and needing to feel accepted by people
[1:55:01] now not one of you including me in here
[1:55:03] is one straight line melancholy or
[1:55:06] chloric of saying I phlegmatic we've got
[1:55:08] a mixture but I want you to look at this
[1:55:11] right here how many times where the
[1:55:13] Prophet was honest before us to where he
[1:55:15] stood and he criticized people
[1:55:18] come on you know I showed you those
[1:55:20] things right here where he has
[1:55:22] criticized and he says in my heart I'm
[1:55:24] critical I can't go out there feeling
[1:55:28] this way in my heart he identifies it as
[1:55:32] a critical selfish spirit what is that
[1:55:37] that's governing that temperament so
[1:55:41] brother BAM is not by no way looking and
[1:55:44] saying then everything I think
[1:55:45] everything I feel everything I say
[1:55:48] that's just Christ acting through me no
[1:55:50] more than it is you or I it's a
[1:55:54] governing no wonder when Paul would say
[1:55:56] that I bring my body in subjection he's
[1:55:59] talking a lot more than just your flesh
[1:56:02] more than just those five gates of the
[1:56:04] Spirit he's dealing with our temperament
[1:56:07] and our makeup some of these things are
[1:56:11] wonderful in one sense such as like
[1:56:13] chloric a cleric can maybe be wonderful
[1:56:15] in a sense that they are a self-reliant
[1:56:18] person hey that's a wonderful thing but
[1:56:20] it can be a big negative thing too
[1:56:21] because it can cause a person to where
[1:56:24] they don't need nobody they don't need a
[1:56:27] new reality of it is we do we need one
[1:56:30] another but yet at the same time when it
[1:56:33] comes to walking with God no doubt as a
[1:56:35] chloric there's parts within their
[1:56:37] temperament that would be a little bit
[1:56:38] more stronger than maybe a same guy
[1:56:40] because the same guys one man they can
[1:56:43] just see the vision hey hey let's just
[1:56:44] do this and they've got a great vision
[1:56:47] but there's no follow-through but you
[1:56:50] need same guys you need people with
[1:56:53] vision then you need people to pick up
[1:56:55] and make that vision become manifest see
[1:56:59] how God has everything so divinely
[1:57:02] orchestrated my it's beautiful it's
[1:57:05] beyond the comprehension isn't it notice
[1:57:08] brother brems says I'm a temperamental
[1:57:10] person melancholy sort of person what's
[1:57:13] this I can't let myself get away Satan
[1:57:18] takes advantage of me on that for the
[1:57:20] Rams dealing was even saying goodbye
[1:57:22] it bothers him
[1:57:24] so he says I won't even say goodbye to
[1:57:26] you
[1:57:27] I can't let myself get this way Satan
[1:57:33] will take advantage of me isn't he
[1:57:36] filled with the prevailing power of God
[1:57:38] he is but part of being filled with the
[1:57:40] prevailing power of God is coming into
[1:57:42] maturity to recognize our strengths and
[1:57:45] our weaknesses the maturity is not about
[1:57:48] oh I'll never make no more mistakes
[1:57:50] you're thinking about the other side but
[1:57:55] the reality with maturity is you learn
[1:57:58] by experience and the virtues in our
[1:58:01] life grow by experience I keep my body
[1:58:07] under subjects many many places in the
[1:58:09] scriptures where Paul would speak of our
[1:58:11] body he said let not sin therefore reign
[1:58:13] in your mortal body that you should obey
[1:58:15] it in the lusts thereof even in Romans
[1:58:17] 12:1 by the mercies of God that you
[1:58:20] would present your bodies a living
[1:58:23] sacrifice think of this here in the
[1:58:26] message perfect faith prevents us now
[1:58:30] many of you will be waiting over till
[1:58:32] the morning it's got a long distance ago
[1:58:35] and I appreciate that effort some of you
[1:58:36] will drive home tonight because you got
[1:58:37] to go to work by daylight in the morning
[1:58:39] I know it's hard he says I get spells
[1:58:42] too you know I get Moody well that's
[1:58:48] hard to imagine that ain't it hmm I get
[1:58:53] to a spot to where I what gets me is
[1:58:56] where I get to those fells when I get
[1:58:59] all overworked and Satan comes telling
[1:59:03] me why nobody cares for you you really
[1:59:06] haven't got a friend in the world see oh
[1:59:12] so what's the problem
[1:59:14] well the problem is we'll just cast that
[1:59:17] devil away that's saying that that's not
[1:59:19] the problem
[1:59:20] the problem is getting overworked it's
[1:59:25] learning your enemy if the enemy can
[1:59:27] keep you moving and moving in that pace
[1:59:29] and moving in that pace and moving in
[1:59:31] that pace then they just get you set up
[1:59:33] to wear down and then he's ready to say
[1:59:34] well I know their guards gonna be now so
[1:59:36] I'll just come in with a little punch
[1:59:38] and nobody really cares about you so it
[1:59:42] isn't devil I say in the name of the
[1:59:45] Lord no this is called knowing how to
[1:59:46] possess our vessel unto sanctification
[1:59:49] and honor when I get overworked
[1:59:53] that's when Satan comes at me remember
[1:59:57] look at this I'm not immune to the
[2:00:01] temptation see I got to overcome that
[2:00:07] well he's already got the overcomer on
[2:00:10] the inside that's true but he's learning
[2:00:12] you see these things right here that's
[2:00:15] shared right there brother BAM no doubt
[2:00:16] has been hit with this over and over and
[2:00:19] over even to her brother Ram would spend
[2:00:21] countless times through the message
[2:00:22] interweaving it all the way through even
[2:00:24] where God would so move on his heart to
[2:00:26] take a word from the Lord to other
[2:00:28] people and let them know you've
[2:00:30] overworked yourself it is not God that
[2:00:32] brought that stroke upon you it's not
[2:00:34] God that brought the heart attack upon
[2:00:36] you you stayed too long in the presence
[2:00:39] of God and you shouldn't do that
[2:00:40] because Jesus don't want you to do that
[2:00:54] someday I'll preach that whole that
[2:00:56] whole Canada word I've been collecting
[2:00:58] for years because you know what that's
[2:01:00] been counseled to me and the counsel
[2:01:03] that I've received within that and you
[2:01:05] know maybe you don't mean it's easy when
[2:01:07] we hear these things like this you think
[2:01:08] this was easy for brother Brennan he
[2:01:10] said I've got to overcome that part of
[2:01:12] overcoming is to do what first recognize
[2:01:19] the enemy and every one of his tricks
[2:01:22] now you see right here you see brother
[2:01:24] Joey the way that the enemy I'd like to
[2:01:25] put this oh yeah you're not been praying
[2:01:27] enough you not been reading enough
[2:01:29] you've now been getting your Bible
[2:01:30] enough you not been doing this enough
[2:01:31] and really that may not even be the
[2:01:33] issue at all and here the devil's got us
[2:01:36] chasing men all round yeah well I gotta
[2:01:39] do this I gotta do that what are we
[2:01:40] doing more overworked
[2:01:43] instead of yielding because how does God
[2:01:46] speak to us yielding how do you meditate
[2:01:50] yielding you okay can I have another
[2:01:58] hour
[2:02:03] just a few more moments please I'm not

[2:02:22] say this that you might know you cross
[2:02:24] bridges many times before you get to her
[2:02:27] that's hereditary
[2:02:31] that's your makeup if you watched well
[2:02:38] how brother BAM goes into this and he
[2:02:39] deals with this inner nervousness it's
[2:02:42] part of the makeup the disposition the
[2:02:44] temperament the personality you can no
[2:02:48] longer no more go over to this person
[2:02:50] say I want you to return every material
[2:02:53] every bit of bridge building material

[2:02:58] ha you're wasting your breath but here
[2:03:03] to see what's happening what's happening
[2:03:05] for this brother right here the problem
[2:03:09] is being addressed it's not somebody's
[2:03:12] tongue hey you need to quit being so
[2:03:14] nervous I mean what neural is being
[2:03:15] nervous about well to be happy in the
[2:03:16] Lord you know everything is secure in
[2:03:18] the Lord Jesus Christ that ain't gonna
[2:03:19] answer his problem sometimes we think we
[2:03:23] got the answer to everything sometimes
[2:03:25] the best answer we've got if we shut our
[2:03:27] mouth and open our ears and listen I
[2:03:30] know that was plain I'm not always
[2:03:32] straight but I hope we get it cuz you
[2:03:35] know what sometimes when you come in
[2:03:37] here I come in here sometimes you know
[2:03:39] what I'm just down sometimes I'm just
[2:03:42] down
[2:03:44] well y'all get down to sure sometimes I
[2:03:49] can tell just even by preaching to you
[2:03:51] but that don't all through what I'm
[2:03:52] gonna Minister my desire is when I'm
[2:03:55] standing here my prayer is that God
[2:03:57] would come and minister to you and lift
[2:04:00] you your face may not change here but it
[2:04:05] might be something it's just so moved in
[2:04:07] your heart it's like a little grain of
[2:04:09] sand on the inside of you let's starts
[2:04:11] moving and by the time 6 o'clock rolls
[2:04:13] around my you're actually starting to
[2:04:15] even think about smiling and then it
[2:04:17] gets to Monday morning my goodness
[2:04:19] you're smiling Tuesday come along what
[2:04:21] insert the word the kingdom of God is
[2:04:24] having an effect
[2:04:25] perfect love that's what God is doing I
[2:04:31] just believe that if we stay and preach
[2:04:33] this word this word brings the change I
[2:04:35] believe that was on my heart the Holy
[2:04:38] Ghost accompanies that word it's him
[2:04:40] that brings the change and no matter how
[2:04:42] loud the minister is how still he is how
[2:04:45] active it is that has nothing to do with
[2:04:47] it that's the makeup of a man but the
[2:04:51] word is the word and Christ is Christ
[2:04:56] [Applause]
[2:04:59] 19:50 obey the voice of the angel my
[2:05:02] brother is talking to another man here's
[2:05:04] a sick man brother brems let him know
[2:05:06] you got troubles he said you know what
[2:05:09] sir
[2:05:10] he said you got heart trouble stomach
[2:05:12] trouble he said you've consulted a
[2:05:14] doctor listen listen this I know I may
[2:05:16] not have the all these lines up there
[2:05:18] you consulted a doctor about this they
[2:05:22] didn't give you much hope you believe
[2:05:27] with all your heart he said I want you
[2:05:28] to look at me when I'm talking to you
[2:05:30] your whole trouble has been is your
[2:05:34] makeup there was an appeal that could
[2:05:38] have fixed his makeup there's not a
[2:05:41] doctor that could have fixed his makeup
[2:05:46] the same God David wrote back in Psalms
[2:05:49] 139 is right there letting him know I
[2:05:52] know you're down sitting I know you're
[2:05:54] up rising and I'm letting you know the
[2:05:57] culprit to your problem is your makeup
[2:06:00] so what do I do Lord are you gonna
[2:06:03] deliver me on my makeup I already have
[2:06:05] delivered you greater am I in you than
[2:06:09] he that's in the world more than what do
[2:06:12] I do
[2:06:12] first of all it's recognizing your
[2:06:14] makeup how many times brother BAM
[2:06:17] remember he would deal with certain
[2:06:18] things with people certain people had
[2:06:20] certain times when they would get down
[2:06:21] look what he would tell them you or I
[2:06:24] may look at it at first before we come
[2:06:25] across these things we would tell a
[2:06:27] person and say I'll tell you what you
[2:06:28] need to do you need to sit down and read
[2:06:29] your Bible that's what it is you're not
[2:06:31] spiritual enough you need to sit down
[2:06:32] and read your Bible tell you what else
[2:06:33] you need to do you need to get out you
[2:06:34] need to be listening to tapes you need
[2:06:36] to be doing this what did the Prophet
[2:06:38] tell them to do put on some good snappy
[2:06:41] gospel music Wow why because they needed
[2:06:51] that do you realize friends God don't
[2:06:54] only speak to you when we're reading the
[2:06:56] Bible or when we're listening to the
[2:06:58] message home and we're sitting in church
[2:07:00] but many of the times God will speak to
[2:07:02] us
[2:07:03] it's things after we've listened to the
[2:07:04] message and we're sitting on work or out
[2:07:06] in the store or driving at all
[2:07:08] of a sudden we're thinking on something
[2:07:10] that just so has grabbed us and all of a
[2:07:13] sudden it just comes winding down from
[2:07:15] the eternities and all of a sudden it
[2:07:17] lights up was oh I got it I see it well
[2:07:23] is it God speaking to you Satan will
[2:07:29] attack this one more can I read one more
[2:07:35] Satan will let me rock on oh man
[2:07:40] somebody gonna be trying to figure out
[2:07:42] my temperament don't you dare try to sit
[2:07:45] there and try to figure out my temper in
[2:07:46] my own preacher but Satan will try to
[2:07:49] attack you on this you see here the way
[2:07:53] that God will come and use your
[2:07:55] temperament Satan also studies you too
[2:07:57] and he'll also come and attack you right
[2:08:00] there in those places he also knows how
[2:08:05] that birth path how that can work
[2:08:06] against you and he'll come in and try to
[2:08:08] attack you in those places in the
[2:08:11] message or the private interview before
[2:08:14] the prayer the Granta preaches the
[2:08:15] message masterpiece here brother branham
[2:08:18] is speaking to sister Georgia Bruce she
[2:08:21] said brother Branham most of all I want
[2:08:25] the experience that I've been sealed in
[2:08:27] the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it
[2:08:31] to your heart she's got to know this how
[2:08:37] many sister Georgia's here
[2:08:40] oh yeah yeah I believe with all my heart
[2:08:47] watch this that you are real born-again
[2:08:50] believer sister Bruce how could that
[2:08:52] spirit just leave when you get sick you
[2:08:55] get weary you're a nervous type person
[2:09:00] sister Bruce says yes and you get things
[2:09:05] on your mind see little bitty things it
[2:09:09] just keeps building up both ways
[2:09:13] you'll get somebody on your heart and
[2:09:15] you want to pray for them you get up and
[2:09:18] pray for it
[2:09:18] you can't rest till you get that person
[2:09:21] prayed for that's you what's this then
[2:09:30] take the other side Satan maybe might
[2:09:34] present something to you out this way
[2:09:37] you're a nature and God works and Satan
[2:09:41] works and then when Satan tries to make
[2:09:44] you believe that you are not sealed you
[2:09:48] keep building this and maybe this and
[2:09:52] this notice you keep building this Wow
[2:09:58] evidently sister Bruce is not the same
[2:10:00] guy then you have a man it gets called
[2:10:08] good evidently her nature her
[2:10:11] temperament is not a sane guy maybe her
[2:10:15] temperament is perfection
[2:10:16] I don't know I don't know I don't need
[2:10:20] to know but what I do know is that God
[2:10:22] was mindful enough to address the
[2:10:24] problem the problem wasn't she did she
[2:10:27] didn't need the Holy Ghost she already
[2:10:28] had the Holy Ghost but what it is is
[2:10:32] that Satan would study her and knew that
[2:10:35] she would get a certain way somebody
[2:10:37] come on her mind she couldn't rest till
[2:10:39] she pray for that person as a matter of
[2:10:42] fact after I preached down to brother
[2:10:43] Tim Humes one year right after I got
[2:10:46] done preach and I'd refer to this part
[2:10:48] for something I was ministering brother
[2:10:49] Tim got up and he referred and opened
[2:10:51] this story up my goodness wouldn't
[2:10:53] understand
[2:10:53] it opened to me I'd never know that
[2:10:55] unless this was told it was not sister
[2:10:57] Bruce that requested this interview this
[2:11:00] interview was an interview that was
[2:11:02] requested by brother Branham himself
[2:11:05] because he heard that sister Bruce was
[2:11:08] born around the tabernacle and she would
[2:11:10] go up to mama Humes
[2:11:12] and different ones and said I wish I had
[2:11:14] what you had I wish I had what you had
[2:11:16] and brother Brandon requested an
[2:11:18] interview with her aren't you glad that
[2:11:20] God request interviews with you and me
[2:11:26] girl repeater God amen to do what
[2:11:30] stabilize us you see it would do no good
[2:11:33] what if one of here she is before
[2:11:35] brother Brennan it takes some wisdom of
[2:11:37] God because if she comes up here and
[2:11:40] brother BAM begins to pray for a whole
[2:11:42] God fill it with the Holy Ghost the Lord
[2:11:43] just filled with the Holy Ghost because
[2:11:45] the Lord you know how it is shall no day
[2:11:46] time our moment minute what's your
[2:11:49] dispensation you're under what you know
[2:11:52] is there's a change and you know there's
[2:11:54] a change about the fruit it bears come
[2:11:58] on somebody you gotta follow the
[2:12:00] dispensation of the word as it
[2:12:01] progresses and to recognize within this
[2:12:04] how the Prophet what is he doing he's
[2:12:06] bringing her faith not to rest in her
[2:12:09] makeup you realize what's going on here
[2:12:11] he is dissembling Satan's army Satan no
[2:12:16] doubt has had a field day with sister
[2:12:19] Bruce no doubt he's had a field day with
[2:12:21] some of us but he says you keep building
[2:12:27] this and maybe this and this don't look
[2:12:29] at yourself sister Bruce remember she
[2:12:34] says I make so many mistakes
[2:12:38] and I fail so many times he said that's
[2:12:43] why Christ had to die with your mistakes
[2:12:47] wouldn't be allotted to you what's he
[2:12:50] working with he's working with that
[2:12:51] temperament right there he's giving that
[2:12:53] daughter of God on the inside
[2:12:55] jurisdiction by what the authority of
[2:12:59] the word he's dividing that part which
[2:13:03] is that natural birth path from the
[2:13:05] spiritual all he says he took your
[2:13:10] mistakes your desire in your heart is to
[2:13:13] serve Him she said yes that's what he
[2:13:17] died for so you could serve Him
[2:13:20] your mistakes are not lauded to you he
[2:13:23] is your perpetuation he is your sin
[2:13:26] offering your sins are not knowing
[2:13:28] you're not a sinner before God Christ
[2:13:30] took your sins and became you because
[2:13:33] your desire is to serve Him and she says
[2:13:40] but I never had an experience but I've
[2:13:43] been filled with the Holy Ghost that I
[2:13:45] can put my foot on where is she getting
[2:13:51] this from do you see how Satan will take
[2:13:55] the word and turn it and use it on you
[2:14:00] he has taken truth and turned it on her
[2:14:05] and her temperament being as it is it
[2:14:08] just took it oh the deliverance that's
[2:14:12] come all right ordinarily a human being
[2:14:17] is born in sin watch this I just love
[2:14:19] this ordinarily our human being is born
[2:14:21] in sin shaped and iniquity come to the
[2:14:23] world speak in lies that's the nature of
[2:14:26] a human being
[2:14:27] sister bruce says yes that was your
[2:14:30] nature that was your nature it changed
[2:14:34] once but what changed it and you said
[2:14:39] Christ they're your sister that's it
[2:14:44] what's he just done gave her something
[2:14:47] to put her foot on
[2:14:49] Oh glory be to God
[2:14:53] wow this arrows gotta fly straight the
[2:14:59] identity of who she is
[2:15:02] sure just like with sister Bruce and
[2:15:05] just like me and you oh my this outside
[2:15:09] part of us
[2:15:10] sticky taco whirl but the inside there
[2:15:17] has been wheat life that's been
[2:15:19] transmitted in the outside will be
[2:15:23] sticky brother Benham says it like this
[2:15:24] it'll bother you until the day you die
[2:15:28] I'll tell you this right now I'll just
[2:15:31] say thank God it bothers me don't you
[2:15:35] thank God it bothers you because you're
[2:15:39] not what you used to be it didn't used
[2:15:41] to bother you the way that it bothers us
[2:15:44] is because our desire is to please him
[2:15:49] that's what gets to us is when we Lord
[2:15:52] ah I don't want to let you down I don't
[2:15:54] want to displease you but in everything
[2:15:57] God through experiences he brings us to
[2:16:01] surrender again and again and you and me
[2:16:05] can say just like Paul o wretched man
[2:16:09] that I am Who Shall deliver me from this
[2:16:15] body of death I thank God through Jesus
[2:16:18] Christ my lord
[2:16:21] ah ha ha you talking about an Ernest
[2:16:26] moving into our heart of the body change
[2:16:28] oh yes but in the meantime His grace is
[2:16:35] sufficient and it is prevailing over all
[2:16:39] of our weaknesses over all things
[2:16:44] it's prevailing no wonder I love how the
[2:16:47] Prophet takes that place prevailing
[2:16:49] power
[2:16:52] it's prevailing don't you love him hey
[2:16:59] we're a chip off the old block we are a
[2:17:05] shaft of his choosing mm-hmm Lord just
[2:17:13] help me to be more surrendered yielding
[2:17:17] all of my strengths and all of my
[2:17:20] weaknesses and everything that you'd be
[2:17:24] glorified that you can act through it by
[2:17:27] the salmon you still Bronco my hahaha
[2:17:29] still growing and I still see by the
[2:17:31] growth I got a lot of grown to do
[2:17:33] because I looked at where I've come from
[2:17:34] and I said Lord
[2:17:36] I didn't even think I had that much back
[2:17:37] there but what I didn't think and what I
[2:17:39] really had it makes me aware right now
[2:17:41] oh my I've got a lot to go but you know
[2:17:44] what I'm growing you know what you're
[2:17:48] growing don't measure it by what it is
[2:17:53] that you might see or don't see just
[2:17:57] rest water the word and let the word
[2:18:01] produce what he said he will do he's
[2:18:05] doing it you love him
[2:18:07] this would be the name let's stand I
[2:18:14] know some me ain't gonna believe about
[2:18:16] it I mean to keep it this long but I
[2:18:23] trust that you're blessed this morning
[2:18:26] encouraged I trust this morning that out
[2:18:29] of this that you can see I see the
[2:18:32] problem and you're able by the help of
[2:18:36] God to address that problem
[2:18:41] a lot of other things you know beyond
[2:18:44] our temperament they own these things
[2:18:46] we've get sometimes we got scars in our
[2:18:49] life we've got disappointments we've got
[2:18:51] all everything so much complexities you
[2:18:55] know even when you look at complexes but
[2:18:58] the brand was so honest and open with us
[2:19:00] about the complex that he had formed you
[2:19:05] know the complex itself you look at
[2:19:08] certain parts about our temperament and
[2:19:09] our makeup it'll form it's easy to form
[2:19:12] in those areas of weakness it is it's
[2:19:17] very easy it'll come to us in certain
[2:19:19] ways and I'm grateful to God that God
[2:19:23] will teach us and he'll help us you know
[2:19:26] something I was just brother I was
[2:19:30] talking to another brother last night
[2:19:31] and the pastor talked to me it's talking
[2:19:33] about a presentation and things like
[2:19:35] Adhan and some things I had done on
[2:19:39] wounds and healing and their stages you
[2:19:44] know of healing when there's a wound
[2:19:46] there's four stages and when there's a
[2:19:50] there's a sometimes when you look in
[2:19:51] your life sometimes there's a healing
[2:19:54] and you can look at it in your life and
[2:19:56] you can think I'm not I'm not getting
[2:19:59] any better I'm gonna get any better but
[2:20:03] the reality is is that to know the
[2:20:05] stages of healing it's not something
[2:20:08] that takes place overnight but there's
[2:20:10] four stages I thought that's powerful
[2:20:12] it's four stages of healing and one of
[2:20:15] the last stages that shows a skin
[2:20:17] maturation as we start getting that
[2:20:19] pinkish and that marbling look you look
[2:20:23] at that say lion healed yet it and ain't
[2:20:25] blend it in with the rest of it but it's
[2:20:27] on its way you realize when there is a
[2:20:30] wound and everything itself will scab
[2:20:32] together you can stand there and say
[2:20:35] Healing is coming oh it's a scab right
[2:20:40] now I can still see the ugly mark yeah
[2:20:43] but it won't be there for all its stages
[2:20:48] what I got to keep doing keep letting
[2:20:51] him
[2:20:52] clean it with his loin nents and pouring
[2:20:58] in the medicine that's needed he's a
[2:21:01] good innkeeper and he he knows how to
[2:21:04] tend to those things he has the true
[2:21:07] essential oil he knows how to put it in
[2:21:11] and he knows how to sue this he knows
[2:21:13] how to move so that it brings healing in
[2:21:17] her life all of this he knows he knows
[2:21:24] only thing we have to do is say Lord I
[2:21:28] surrender I said and let him show you if
[2:21:34] you look at something maybe there's a
[2:21:35] wound in your arm maybe something now
[2:21:37] the Lord would have me to say that maybe
[2:21:39] something you can just let the Lord say

[2:21:42] what I'm not where I was and you might
[2:21:44] look at say I don't think I'll ever get

[2:21:47] you won't you are not where you were
[2:21:51] you're headed somewhere you're headed
[2:21:55] somewhere thank God you don't got
[2:21:57] infection thank God you don't got
[2:22:00] infection let's pray together could we
[2:22:08] more Jesus
[2:22:14] what so many so many of things that
[2:22:18] you've spoke to us this morning I
[2:22:21] realize the Lord that it's not about
[2:22:25] that we would remember everything but
[2:22:29] how did you speak so personal to deal
[2:22:33] with what the real problem is what I
[2:22:38] want to say thank you for these examples
[2:22:42] that are laid out right here in the
[2:22:44] message thank you Lord I'm so glad they
[2:22:48] were captured on wire magnetic tape
[2:22:51] whatever it was I'm glad I'm so glad it
[2:22:54] was left I'm glad for this Lord these
[2:22:58] are things Lord that you show your care
[2:23:02] you're concerned how you ministered to
[2:23:05] our life you teach us Lord right through
[2:23:07] these things you teach us Lord how to
[2:23:10] minister as a husband as a father as a
[2:23:13] pastor as a deacon as a trustee as a
[2:23:15] brother to a brother sister his sister
[2:23:16] you teach us right here Lord forgive us
[2:23:22] sometimes more the things that we
[2:23:24] overlook seem to be so simple but they
[2:23:29] are keys that open and unlock the
[2:23:34] channel
[2:23:35] but your life my flow lord help each and
[2:23:40] every one Lord here this morning myself
[2:23:42] included Lord help us father no matter
[2:23:46] where we are at in our walk with you

[2:23:55] Christ and father we ask Lord here in
[2:24:00] this service Lord God we don't want to

[2:24:10] father we see right here revisiting
[2:24:13] these things coming through these
[2:24:14] pathways we see Lord God just as what
[2:24:18] was pointed out many times our whole
[2:24:23] trouble not in every case but many of
[2:24:26] these cases the trouble was the makeup
[2:24:31] you never stripped away the makeup you
[2:24:36] never did you never said I'm gonna
[2:24:37] change that makeup that outer conscience
[2:24:40] that outer birth path no but you help us
[2:24:43] to see how Satan would be coming to work
[2:24:48] and use things right in our own body our
[2:24:55] own nature would turn it and use it
[2:24:59] against us
[2:25:02] nor truly your word is sharper than any
