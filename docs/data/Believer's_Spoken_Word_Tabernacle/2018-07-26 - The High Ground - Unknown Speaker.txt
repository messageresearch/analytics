might be glorified among us or you might have your way father we pray in this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen you love him tonight would you turn with me to Ephesians chapter 6 I'm just gonna read just a portion of this reading verse 10 is where we will start finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind and put on the horror of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places verse 12 I think it's very clear we're not up against human battles this is a spiritual warfare verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand may God bless his word and bless the reading bless you as you're being seated god bless you I want to speak here tonight on a thought just that struck my heart on the high ground the high ground Paul is speaking here you'll find that Paul is a Bible reader you know that Paul will speak of the armour of God even in the book of Romans and Paul will speak of it as being the armor of light and put on that armor of light and you realize that the armor of God when we look at it there many of the places within it which we did not read all the way down through there in going through those areas but most of the armor and armor that you have is that of it's for defensive purposes there's one there's one that is there that is very clear for the offensive and that's the sort of a spirit and when you look with this right here any person who would engage within or fight with in any type of battle position itself is always of the essence but the position is what is very important as a matter of fact many strategies have been adjusted have evolved down through time even with that of the different empires that have arose within the vision of Daniel that was interpreted of that dream of Nebuchadnezzar many of those empires when they conquered another Empire there was a changing of the tactics of how that they themselves would be able to outmaneuver outmaneuver the other opposing force so they would have to study that force and then they would have to figure out how that they themselves would be able to out outmaneuver that force and when you look at this I thought of this thought the the high ground many of these things when I was there even within that of Gettysburg there were some things that even on this angle of it that was so so pressing to my heart within this and so many things just to gathering even in this direction and you know I think back to it where you take for example when Israel went into the six-day war you take one by the name of Moshe Dayan and when he himself was preparing to lead Israel into battle Moshe Dayan went to that place of Jericho and he prayed there then Moshe Dayan he also went to the place where David had could feed defeated Goliath and he prayed there as well and he looked what he looked for is that the inspiration of those battles and what had taken place and how that those things had would be beneficial and how that truly he received inspiration and you know that when you look at it I was just looking at it early on Sunday morning when you take for example the different wars that have been fought and you compare the countries that have fought and looked at those that are the victors versus the flags of those who are defeated when you look back at that on the six-day war you see the lone flag of Israel as the victor and you see a multitude of flags of their of Nations that are in the defeated color as far as size as far as quantity as far as being how manned would be considered to be outmuscled Israel was all of the above but the difference was is that God was with them and I want to just just look at and in looking at this tonight when we look at inspiration brother Brian himself you know if you listen to the message at all brother branham takes many inspirations of things that have happened in very various battles and God would so direct him to place it in a spiritual context just an example where brother Branham would Roy it would be would speak to us even concerning Patton in different ones and I don't want to elaborate all of those different ones that he went through but yet he was able to gather inspiration of things that he had read and then when he himself was going through something he was able to apply that such as the very simple one with Patton where he said you know but the Brenham comes to a place and he says I've always been afraid of failure but the Lord dealt with him there in receiving the furtherance of his Commission of how that God had already confirmed it but he had to accept what God confirmed and once he accepted what God confirmed but the random then goes in and he opens up and he says I've always been afraid of that failure of failure he said but then he says what comes to my mind he said is that this isn't the message go tell he says that what comes to my mind is that of how that Patton himself said if I put a bullet in the gun and it fails to go off I will take that one out and I'll put another one in if that one fails to go off I'll take that one out and I'll put another one in you see what that whole part what was said upon a natural in applying to a war that had already taken place the Prophet brought that around inspired that this is God's Word and God's Word cannot fail faith in God's Word will stand there upon the front line in the midst of what would even seemingly be defeat but yet God's Word can't fail and we we look at these things of these inspirations and I I think of it of how that God and I want you to think of this for a moment of how that God Himself God made a promise so many promises through the word where his faithfulness to defend Israel you know many of maybe that go over in your mind and your heart right now too many for us to even cover but God made a promise that he would defend her God also made a promise that he himself would restore her through repentance and you know even after they had went away in Babylon it was God who said that he would bring them back he will also how God has said that in the book of Zechariah that he himself would pour out the spirit of grace and supplication upon those in Israel and you find that how within that he I want you to think of this of how that that has already been determined and set it's already been prophesied in God's Word but there must be people who are ordained within that promise that the spirit of grace and supplication would be poured out and in order and where that scripture is to be if let's say this represents those people then every one of those people of hooman is ordained for that promise must be in that place of where that promise of which they are a part of to happen they must be but remember the Prophet uses the simplicity of when you think back of even how that God will fulfill his word because when God gave a vision to the Prophet that was God's Word are you with me that's God's Word it's God it's God expressing of what is that which is certain and you must have faith within that and think of how that the Prophet do you remember in the in the different times where here he is setting in the house and he knows that this baby is to be healed that God has already spoken that that baby is to be healed and yet what happens is is that the Prophet himself which all of us have been there where we're in the sense of time the urgency the desire to see God's Word fulfilled and how that the Prophet moves takes up the baby and when he does that you know what takes place and actually the baby goes into convulsions it's worse I tell you every time when I read that and think of it I think God your grace that kept them from running him out of the house you know I mean you think of it in our but this is God's grace see even within it then the Prophet stepped back and he realized each one of these things must be in position and when it got in position then he could rise and act and authority and see it was God himself the whole time giving even the patience to the Prophet to wait on the fulfillment of the word then God steps right behind and the Prophet prays a very simple prayer but in that God this is this has been your this is your will and we know what takes place that child rises up and is healed and I and I look at this that within each one of these things coming into position you know there's a there's there's a book that I've read here just in different times throughout the years and it's called the lion hearts and it was given to me my father-in-law had given it to me and it's dealing with the early Zionists those who were called Zionists who returned into Israel it deals with the the raising up of that Hebrew language of what was completely lost and it goes into all of the of the miracle of that but it goes into these individuals that even prior to being drove back from there of the Holocaust how many of those who came in there in those times and the ways that they risked their life even of the man that I referred to earlier Moshe Dayan there were many times he spent in prison before he ever arose to what you and I know him for it's because of even those forces of how that they would press those men and and and so forth and we understand that if when you look at those individuals coming back into the land those are into all of those parts are necessary to even bring it to even where Israel has come today because right now within this we realize in this generation back there in 1947 when the Israel here becomes a nation all of those parts all of that when the Lord Jesus had even given that as a sign to be watching that watch watch the fig tree I want to just say it to you like this and I'm trying to get this point across these things just don't happen but it's God moving on all intra integral parts that are leading even up to that it isn't just something that just happens out of nowhere it's all parts coming together that lead up and move all together in a unison towards this I ask you when you think of and I know maybe you haven't read of some of that but what would possess a person to lay their life so much on the line to go right back in there in harm's way and would flight and all of those things what would do that you can't tell me that that's just human ingenuity or that it's just strong genetics I disagree with that I believe us all of my heart that it was influenced and inspiration that whereby it inspired those commits these things would begin to come into that place then to where everything is now it just doesn't happen God made it promise and when God has made a promise and they just just kind of move into this he fulfills his word let me just say it like this it's God always fulfilling his word it's God interpreting his word and God doesn't interpret his word just by speaking God interprets his word by manifesting it that's that's very clear and that we we understand that as believers so when God has made a promise there's only one that can fulfill that promise it has to be God fulfill that promise when God made a promise to deliver Israel it wasn't Moses that fulfilled that promise it was God that fulfilled it but God fulfilled it and he takes the agency an office there of man of whom was already predetermined within that promise when God spoke it but when God spoke it Moses's knowledge of it there was a conflict even though Moses was the man he was to be the messenger of the hour but there was a conflict and what had to take place is Moses himself had to come to a place of surrender and allow God who made the promise to operate the promise through him that's always that's God's greatest challenge so when God makes his promise he will fulfill his word by releasing the influence upon the hearts of men I want you to think of this upon the hearts of men then are either directly or seemingly indirectly tied to the promise let me just work with this a moment because all around the promise there when God has given a promise there's always opposition to that promise and to those who are identified in that promise by that promise persecution opposition all hell is against that working and that's what Satan's trying to stop is Satan's not concerned about the flesh and blood he's concerned with trying to prevent and stop the promise of God from coming to pass I want you to think about this for a moment Satan knows he can't stop it he knows that if you knew something was a lost hope or a lost cause I guarantee you and I probably would not be as adamant about certain things it's just like when you finally give up and call the plumber or you call somebody else or whatever more you finally realize you know what I've reached my end but Satan knows this and has known this he's known this in every age where the word has been raw has raised up and met him and confronted him he's all he's known this but yet he still can coming let me just say it like this there's advancements that the enemy would try to make in our lives and let me just say it like this let's just say this year of which previous years we have resisted and we have recognized it and overcome that but just because we've recognized it overcome it and gained the victory there does not mean that he's going to stop his advancement he keeps coming it's just the angle of which he comes he'll change it but he still comes with the same motive this is why that the Prophet would speak to us and a very a phrase within how can overcome and he speaks wrecking overcoming is recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks and then recognizing that the God in you is greater and there's so much that when we can look at this and and look into it that for a promise I want you to think for a moment and look at think of Cyrus here is Israel they've gone into captivity but before they ever went into captivity in Babylon in the book of Isaiah it's already wrote in Jeremiah it's already wrote of this visitation Cyrus his name is mentioned in the Book of Isaiah and yet Cyrus is not a believer he never became a believer but yet listen to me God calls him in the word my shepherd he calls him mine anointed what you think of this Cyprus was not anointed with an evil spirit but here the anointing of how God had already laid it within the word Cyrus was not a if we could say a direct part of one who left Babylon and went down into Jerusalem but he was a key part within it that when that inspiration broke you know how Cyrus stood there and Cyrus spoke as a man of authority in the very first chapter of Ezra and Cyrus says that has been commissioned and given me a charge by Almighty God he needs spoke with authority I am asked I'm gonna just look at this just for a moment I believe with all of my heart that there were believers remnant believers that were there in Babylon that even while they were in Babylon were living victorious I believe that Daniels Jew Daniel and the Hebrew children are just examples of this but yet within it there were those who also were looking to the fulfillment of the promise of which God had already made - Jeremiah I believe they were praying for that fulfillment remember there were others in the time when that word was in the place or the time and space of when that word was who was getting ready to be fulfilled of carried away in captivity there was such a rise and increase of false prophets with anointings that where they spoke peace peace peace I want you to catch this that whole thing rising a peace that message of peace it sounds like who would not want to hear that message of peace but it was in direct contradiction to what God had already said and think of it the believers down through time they had to stand there and judge between the prophets of Val and Micah they had to judge there between Moses and Balaam they had to judge there even in this even in this situation they're judging here between that of Jeremiah and Hananiah Jeremiah had and I wish it weren't to God as you're saying but you see here's the thing Jeremiah was prophesying under the very leadership of the Lord and he was calling the people back to the word and let him know this is where you drifted from the message of peace was not pointing them back that Hananiah was preaching was not pointing them back she wasn't correcting their wrong it wasn't pointing them to repent it wasn't in any of that it was just saying peace peace unto you and God is the Prince of Peace he is a God of peace he's a god full of grace he's the god of deliverer he's a healer and all of those attributes come and are manifest when the conditions of his word are met so indeed he is the God of peace and the peace that was of the elect was in that God will keep his word and after seventy years he will visit us and Cyrus was not so much a direct part as far as one who was going to return but it was like an indirect part and after all of this is accomplished on the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem we're in that he speaks and you know we've labored on this and many times here not everybody rose up when Cyrus proclaimed who is it who's God among him whose spirit is stirred up who is it among you not all of Israel rose up now you might look at that and say well it was about them returning but God knows who he has in his mind for the return and God knows the intervals and the Junction's God did not need Nehemiah at first he needed Ezra are you with me because you don't build the walls without first setting up the temple you with me you don't deal with the gates until you get the soul converted because that's the temple of God my spirit is not his temple my body listen to me now this body is not the temple but his temple and Paul could say you're no you not your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost it's God dwelling in the holiest of Holies and his effects and influence and his life are felt through the other courts he dwells in that place that belongs to him so here as four steps after the priests of God a ready scribe the Bible says then so we find in all of these parts here that it's God moving upon or each one of them in how that they come back and how that their return and so with this right here it comes I come to a place that I think of this quote this quote has been something that's been very pressing on my heart for months now months I referred I referred it in here a few weeks ago and I referred to in many places but out of the message the breech brother brems says those seven horns was the seven churches the seven church age is because that was the lambs protection what he protected his rights with on earth was a god-sent group of people that's protected he says that horn on the land he goes into seven eyes are the seven messengers of the seven Church h7 i7 seers so to have that of protection it speaks that there is powers there is a power at work there is a battle there is that which is present to try to undo and to try to take away or to try to add to but remember this is God's promise it's God that delivers this promise it's God overseeing this promise and so within this this protection the protection of his right God has reserved channels upon this earth that he has ordained that his rights are maintained you know it is his right he had he had the rights to the book of redemption he had the rights to that and here in this great sublime Act that the Prophet would call it in Revelations 5 wherein that the lamb comes forward to take that book of redemption and it's all speaking we're at a time of finishing up this is an ending time there's not going to be a continuation as far as another age this is the final Gentile age this is the final message the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost and him taking the book it's him claiming what he has rightfully paid the price for you see by the Holy Spirit coming through the word it has laid claim upon every one of his children down through the ages and when he lays claim listen to me now when the Holy Spirit coming through that word and the people are born of that word but the Spirit of God human because remember you're born of the water and of the spirit is that right the word and spirit so then it gives free course for the word to work within your life whatever that God has spoken it is God that brings that word to pass in the life of his believing children it's God that brings it to past by moving in our lives that whereby we are surrendered in full trust to him and he performs his word of promise God let listen God let Abraham's strength come to an end why did God do that God let it be known to you and I that was for you and I that example was for us with when we are standing in this time of the rapture and yet it's a time of the greatness of God's power and my how we have such to look forward to even moment by moment day by day that God's power is not diminishing but it is becoming greater are you with me and it's not going to become diminished it's come it's moving in the greater measure but I will I would assert this to you this evening is that it's God moving by his spirit bringing us into full surrender for his working because in reality it takes him to bring that about in our lives and when we think I'm fully surrendered that's when we're not but it's God who brings us to that place that Lord my trust is completely in you it's called doing that man can't do that but remember it's God doing it and God is the word and the word creates an atmosphere the word creates an atmosphere just like Genesis one in order to bring forth what he has already saw it's God's Word you are his workmanship I am his workmanship so he's protecting his rights which his rights here his rights he's maintaining his rights and I want you to think of this and think of it very deeply his rights is his coming his word its protecting remember his question will I find faith when I return is ask the question will I find faith when I return but remember just as every part has to be where it's at God releases the influence that is needed to bring every part into its place I'll just say it like this if I had a decision to make tonight I would be resting on the Holy Spirit to give me the influence what I needed and how to direct me in that decision I would not limit any decision tonight and say well this was a very natural decision but I believe as believers we want God to be the lord of all of our lives of all that even that he would want for us if it's things within the natural to allow God to direct us of where that we ought to be or what it is that we ought to have or the decision whatever it is Lord you direct me in other words I'm not big enough to make this decision on my own but Lord I'm trusting you to influence me because there's one thing that I want to do is see your kingdom advance in my life I don't want to make decisions Lord that removed me from the position that I'm to be in because those who are alive and remain the rites of the lamb is his word and his word is the prophecy of the book what's been wrote down through the time and I've said like this we are brought into a redemptive partnership with Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost a word as Paul could express it like this where he could say unto us has been committed a word of reconciliation listen to me a word that not only calls you out but a word that'll take you into something that doesn't leave you in limbo but brings you fully all the way this Antichrist spirit we mentioned this on Sunday that Antichrist spirit it's not as not just newly as of recent entered in John led by the Spirit of God put the people of God on notice that that Antichrist that which you have heard of and now is already worth a look it's working remember it's a spirit in order for it to work it has to have vessels to work through it has to have vessels to work through and to take control of the con the contrast is also the same the Holy Spirit is a spirit a person may be with me and it must have vessels that are yielded to work through so how can we yield we yield by the nature that is within whatever the nature is within that we are born of it's a yielding to to that and to look at of how that John points this out then he he comes to identify and wants you to catch this now he identifies what the Antichrist spirit is and he doesn't place it out here as some hocus-pocus he lets it be known that very thing is working right here that's what he said he said every spirit that deny it Jesus Christ he has come in the flesh is not of God and John was not speaking about the Antichrist spirit is a smooth fella the Antichrist spirit was not going to say that well Jesus Christ you know it was not the Son of God God did not become flesh no the settlements within that time of where John was speaking of the denying of his coming was to deny indeed he was the son of God because that the Holy Spirit had been poured out that's his coming there is a literal physical coming but as we were laying that in on Sunday he was coming by way of his Spirit coming through his word that makes the people who are a part of his coming they then live for his coming they are brought in position by the word in their day they are planted and established in prison truth those are two separate entities but if they work in unison to think of this he said he is coming he's coming so to recognize that the coming when we looked at his coming his coming has been missed even in every age because it's been so simple is that right it's been so simple God is taken and through the Ministry of that of the messengers and we go on and on the ministry under that on and on all of those that are gathered within that word how the Holy Spirit then bringing to a birth having the working and the preeminence in that group of people a simple humble and we could say like this uneducated being that not educated in that of the worldly and that of religion it's the simplicity that's missed each time his coming is working in our lives the channels to where each one is to be in position just as every age you know we you think of a relay think of a relay race if this person holding the baton does not get it to the other person they have to stop and retrieve that baton and then go on if they take off and don't have the baton they're disqualified but the baton that is handed is the same baton all along but as the baton itself in the hand of that last runner as it's being wrong then the crowd begins to stand up on their feet and the cloud of many witnesses begin to ring out and say hey here we are here's the finish here's the final stretch stay focused look onward why because it's close to the finish but in the transition of that there's always an overlap every age there's an overlap see it's not just a stop and then a start and stop and then a start it's an overlap you see that even in those were here within the ministry of brother branham some that were caught in that overlap they are a part of the bride of Jesus Christ but they were not in not seeing what God had opened for the bride when not to elaborate on all that but you see God's Greece they lived faithful to what God had opened to them just as you and I are held accountable to live faithful to what God has opened to us and so I'll say it like this in regards to his coming just to drift from that just a moment or to move from there there's two opposing forces in the world it's God Satan the battle that began as angelic battles it fell on humans and let me just let's just make no mistake about it it's not human battles its angelic warfare for we wrestle not against flesh and blood the scriptures are very clear of how that when Satan he and he engaged Eve with conversation through the instrument of the serpent and he began to speak to her what was he coming against he could not get to her he could not penetrate that wall of the word that they were fortified behind Satan couldn't penetrate it but when he could get her to doubt one little speck he poked a hole right in the wall and when he got a hole in that wall you know it's just like a mouse if you you ever seen those things where they put out the different size holes that a mouse can go through it amazes it can be such a small little hole and they're able to take their little bitty nose and bring that whole body through Satan put one little hole poked one little hole there how could he poke it because she already and let down I'm holding up of the word and in the song that we're looking at the high ground is not that we in every instance understand everything it isn't that we have a feeling it's wonderful to have a feeling it's wonderful to have a direct word from the Lord there are times where you don't have a direct word from the Lord and there's a need that as a rose in your life or Satan comes attacking but yet to stand upon God's word that irregardless of anything God is faithful the message God called men brother Brent says what we need his men trained to carry this message he said men that would stand there whether in victory or defeat will stand the same you see the Hebrew children they themselves did not know what was going to happen they didn't know I'll come to the end of this and he'll want to get to the end of this they'll be the fourth man they'll meet us down there will you know will be delivered they didn't know that but what they knew was we don't even need to pray about this situation we're not bowing God allowed that to be show that's an example that's part of the book of redemption that's part of our heritage that's part of this genealogy that's not of your natural tree or my natural tree this is part of the life of that tree of life and Satan studies closely these things my blue bream says it like this he says we find Satan let me just refer to this he speaks of this and the message the power of the devil and he talks about God's program and he finds he speaks of how that when everything went to take place after Genesis here comes the Exodus here comes God's promise of deliverance and in God's promise of deliverance Billy BAM says like this we find Satan quickly at work on God's program and he uses this terminology says we see that malignant eye of the devil that's serpent I want you to think of that that malignant eye a cancerous I remember at the eye itself if it be single thy whole body shall be full of light but Satan's desire was to get that than the focus and bring the focus out of where it needed to be he said that's always tried to interfere with God's program before it comes on earth and he always knows when it's coming mostly didn't the Spirit of the Lord speak through the Prophet in Christ the mystery of God revealed and said he's howling then why is he howling because his scheme has been uncovered and with the scheme being uncovered the answer is revealed and the answer is Christ his own life which ties and identifies us into him and in that book of life where there is no break but the breach has been removed you with me the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming upon that seed it removes the chasm and joins us back in to who we always were not just forgiven I stand justified he spanned the breach for us think about this look at this this program of God how Satan attacks this when the Jews returned as we were referring to in Ezra when they returned to build the temple what's the first thing that happened you find people who came up and said let us work with you we seek we seek your God as you do liars they did not you say how could you say that they did not remember his rights are protected by a god-sent group of people and a god-sent group of people the God who sends us goes in us are you as for me they have been commissioned not by a man where come under the Commission chin of the word now I wonder what they look like they look like you're not peace-loving people I wonder what things they had thrown up and you don't have the love of God y'all gettin quiet on me now they weren't being hateful they just were standing you see this is this inference that is not something that is not a strain that's come through the word that is a strain of the world that the love of God is something without a backbone that's not the love of God that's the love of this world not about arrogance not about hateful remember how many times were brother Branham is standing there times he calls names times he does it and I would ask you within those times how many times you hear brother man will stop and brother Brown even anointing once at the end time in many places he says I've not said that to be indifferent but I'm asking you within and I wonder how many of those talks and one of those things when he he was catching that spirit that was there but you see what it is just as it was in the time of the Pharisees people did not know the love of God the love of God is not against the sinner it's not against the person the love of God is for God for the standard of Almighty God and to think of this they stood there and they would not allow those others to help because they themselves were directly under that promise of a return date listen friends there was a discernment that they had within that hour let me ask you who wouldn't want help building it come on join in with us man we got to get this built we can use you come on in but you see it isn't that always more make the work go faster it ain't more of people it's more of God in the people and God standing in the hearts and lives of the people and people standing in the promise on the high ground when Israel think of this as we'd alluded to this with Moses look at this unfolding of God's program as we said at the beginning you have Moses Moses intellectuals here's a seed down beneath but his intellectuals are against but God's program can't be defeated that seed has got to come to birth and God knows exactly the water of life that's needed to rot - rot in order to bring that seed forth the water of Egypt could not rot it you said well his momma rehearsed the promise but it shows there is a place that we must come to the Holy Spirit brings a life to that place of birth brings us to that place of face-to-face God and in this unfolding of God's program here stands Moses watch this what Satan's advancement to come against this program it moves in from Moses to here as Moses we know it comes forth then here the wilderness they hadn't even got out of Egypt hardly and here's the golden calf and throughout the wilderness Israel became content with just the wilderness just sanctification but that was not the goal but in the midst of the wilderness the people complained is that right Moses got vexed come on somebody humanity that human was still I was there was on display what is it it's Satan trying to stop God's program if he can get the people down he can get the servant down hey man he's got it whipped you say well it's God's program but remember God fulfills his word through his ordained channels that's God's choosing that's God's choosing Oh so within it it makes God responsible if you're outta line or I'm out of line then it's in God's hands to align us for him to move within our lives to bring us into that place where we should be because he just won't do it he wants this from the heart so then from the wilderness we come to Kadish Satan's desire to come against God's program some spies come back and the Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 2 they discourage the hearts of the people or in another wording it means they cause the hearts to melt these were people they were walking in the wilderness they listened this is what the promise was the promise wasn't just I'll bring you out of Egypt but the promise was to bring you unto a land that floweth with milk and honey and those no there were men who were there the whole time that arose and brought an evil report words and those words had such an effect and a resounding effect that all of the Israel here they were weeping and wailing but there was some fathers who stood true just one Caleb there one weeping and wailing in their tent who imitated something they might have had tambourines out that night him I'm trans listen to me there was something within it they're rejoicing was in the God who made the promise I'm telling you Caleb wasn't walking that land and looking at all of Eden's place and valuing what Edom had and Eden's allowed to do this and this and that Caleb said I've got one goal and that is the promised land that's what Joshua had he had one goal the Promised Land listen to me Joshua and Caleb standing in that time and Joshua did not even know at that moment that he was ordained by God that the same angel the Lord that spoke through Moses called Moses equip Moses would turn around and be the same angel the Lord moving through Joshua that's not what Joshua stood like he did he stood like that because he was a believer his vision was fixed on the promise or a beat of God then here's God's program advancing you find here's a great victory that's one of Jericho all right great victory but Aiken doesn't pay attention and see the value of every word you with me and look what that wedge of gold does what was that all about it was influence it wasn't God influencing Aitkin but it was influence you see this is where it's so important in this our our influence our influence it must and is to come from Almighty God the same God who is the word this is where the Prophet before the seals were opened at the beginning of January out and Markova Valley Arizona he takes that message of January 63 and says low cloud made people recognize that the mighty angel has come down and opened those seals and may they allow him to influence their lives and yet it was months before it happened you know why it's a promise of the word and the Prophet here he is standing there he's aware he's been speaking about the seals touching on these things throughout life he realized it's something that is moving within his place within his life for what he himself must get into position getting in position it's not easy but what God has ordained in the position that were to be in God will see to it that whatever needs to be taken away and rearranged to get us in that position as he stayed there taking care of his mother-in-law in Jeffersonville what did the Holy Spirit say to him after he was on the porch after mowing the grass he said he said to him he said like Abraham I cannot fully bless you until you fully obey me you see obedience is not a line we set obedience is God's plumb line hey man we can feel pretty good like manna I feel like I'm up to this standard but remember we're growing God did not come near after the opening of the seven seals to have seven doors we're to grow has the Prophet himself would pray and inspiration God may there be mighty warriors rise in this in time you have an akin and they can arises and when akin arises here look what happened look at this the gold is that's the way what does this do Athens should have stood when he seen that garment and that wedge of gold notice you catch this he didn't just take a garment the garment and the gold and that garment is tied to that worship that same spirit that's in the earth today are you with me she has the gold you with me see this parallel going right through the scripture and notice what happened when when that influence was brought into the camp look how that influence akin never went out said anything but look at the influence among the men of war they themselves spoke in pride most Joshua we don't need to send out that many just a few don't don't we don't need the whole army hello it's not the me was because you won it wasn't because the strength of the horror me it wasn't because of the number of the me it was because the whole army was a whole army singular under the Living God singular that's where the victory was at Jericho was only a manifestation of the victory of unity in the camp of Israel unity with what with God's program so then they rise up in Pride and you know what happens at AI they end up running from their enemies then God turns it around see his programs not gonna be defeated God didn't fail we'll pass on by ai we're not gonna worry about him but instead the battle plan that God lays is a people who had looked like they're running scared but they weren't remember they had went away from God and the battle manifests as one running back to God and then running back to God a return in fellowship God manifested himself in victory showing that any place that is strayed from what God's program is if we and our hearts come back to that place where the holy spirit would point out in our lives then God's program continues on then it gets closer I'm closing there's no way we're gonna get to where I was looking at tonight it gets closer Satan's attempt to thwart this program here's some people show up called the Gibeonites these guys holes in their shoes moldy bread wine you know that's everything and what they say is that we are from a far-off country we know what you've done to the rest of them but would you make a pact with us and they made a peace pact with them and you know the scripture and not only says it in Joshua it says it also in Chronicles they're the Gibeonites abide to this day because of one peace treaty one pact and you know what it wasn't something way out there it was an enemy that was closer than what they thought and remember our greatest enemy we look at it every day our greatest enemy is closer very close to us very close but make no pact with him God's program cannot be defeated it's to maintain the high ground when position is compromised then the enemy has advantage but the high ground is what we've been given and what I'm what I mean by that there is the high ground that's been given to us upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it was it that the Gibeonites were more shrewd and more of how that that they would come it doesn't matter how shrewd that they would be how deceptive they came how believable it seemed Joshua was given a strict order by God God would speak directly to Moses but God told in the book of Deuteronomy Joshua is to go to Eleazar the high priest and he's to consult the yeren see it's faith placed in the word when God has come listen when God has come and visit the generation what is he calling us to he's calling us to the word he's calling us to himself he's calling us to the high ground and the high ground is him for he has set me upon a rock David said he alone is my rock hallelujah there is no other rock like a rock that rock is that high ground that revelation of Almighty God it's the high ground it's it's where it leads us back to the word we're not led by feelings we might have pulsation there might be things that are spoke to us things that are set but remember we're moved by a direct commission by the word beloved believe not every spirit but try every spirit and see whether it be of God I think it shows a great danger victories are precious aren't they everybody love victories I like them anybody like defeats I don't anybody like making mistakes it shows us within that instance right there the victory you might have had yesterday does not guarantee you victory tonight and the victory you have tonight does not guarantee you victory tomorrow but remember every victory comes from yielding and being submitted to him and his working and to always remember it is not I who live but Christ who lives in me it is not you or me that gets the victory it's him it's his victory moving through us as ordained yielded channels but I'll say this to you as I've said many times at different times of council and other things success is not permanent failure is only temporary now shall make that way of good success and prosperous so remember Paul said I die daily you love him every day is to look for victory but remember victory there might be different things that we come in contact with but remembering it all the Bible says submit yourself therefore under God resist the devil and he will flee from you it doesn't say resist the devil first then submit remember submission to greater is He that is in you then resist the devil your loving tonight his program will not and cannot be defeated but let it be within our hearts and our lives that Lord let your program advance in me Lord your loving let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you Lord tonight Lord God as we look Lord into the word as you have opened to us the contents to speak words of counsel and when your word is manifest Lord it's you and you are our leader Lord you Lord God are the one to lead us and to guide us Lord Jesus you know every need you know every situation you know each heart that's gather here tonight and all that are under the sound of my voice father may we be as yielded as that had those glasses the handkerchiefs even to those people where the Prophet would mention they had to be setting standing in certain places Lord were trusting in you [Music] that every part Lord of Our Lives to be positioned in you Lord I pray Lord Jesus help us Lord to be mindful knowing that Satan as we read in the scriptures Lord is various in the way that he would come way Lord God of which he would seek to approach and move Lord as the Bible says Satan as a roaring lion roll to and fro seeking whom he may devour but all God nor our hearts are looking to you there's a greater greater sound Lord that we have heard we have heard from you and as we look up on these things in your word oh god help us tonight the Lord that our lives and our hearts would be so yielded to you Lord I you know how to break it to every one of our hearts you know each circumstance you know each part every situation you know what each one Lord would be facing or dealing with you know Lord sometimes Lord we can have Lord where it's us using our own strength the Lord you can never use that strength [Music] but that it would be surrendered to you Lord God I ask that you would help each and every one of us as your children lay the word Lord being so broken and help us to our lives Lord and apply that we might be able to see your God and recognizing Lord the high ground that you have appointed us to help us Lord act me knowing the Lord that victories that we have are not guaranteed a victory again the Lord God to look at those victories and any victory any any one of them has been where we have been able to get out of the way and that's not even been anything that we can take credit because even to get out of the way it takes your influence your direction moving on our life that we would surrender that your program might be advanced we're standing there in these closing moments nor these hours that were living father all around us Lord God how that the enemy Lord is gathered the Lord were looking to you you made the promise you are faithful to fulfill and we're trusting in you Lord Jesus help us lord help us that we might surrender and die more Lord to ourselves Oh God not our wants the Lord your desire that which is pleasing to You Lord Lord your tonight and I believe I'm one of them and I believe I'm looking at others Lord that all God are to be and are a part of that rapture Jesus Oh God not an event but an unfolding where the climax of it all is the change of these mortal bodies Oh God how Satan Lord his desire is to stand against the Lord try to hinder it Lord but he cannot stop the program of God as you out Sara well then he was speaking to Abraham [Music] lord can anything hinder is anything too hard for the Lord nothing's too hard Lord God for their request upon the heart tonight Lord that has been held there Oh God in your presence Lord decisions maybe that have to be made and requests that are there Lord you see that requests more tonight and father with that desire that your program would be advanced in that life and that horn whether it's for a loved one whether it's for a job Oh God for Lord
