[0:00] couldn't fill moses's shoes that spot
[0:01] had already been filled but he was to
[0:03] carry the word over
[0:04] he was to be the one that would take the
[0:06] ministry of moses and
[0:08] reach the promised land with it right
[0:10] now there's so many
[0:11] so many things we can stop here but we
[0:12] want to want to get down to the end but
[0:16] when joshua realized he was walking in
[0:18] perfect harmony with god's word
[0:20] brother bam said he became fearless in
[0:22] his testimony
[0:24] when he was positionally placed and he
[0:26] realized
[0:27] i'm joshua this is my fulfillment
[0:30] this is the direction i'm going this is
[0:32] what i'm ordained to do
[0:34] brother ram said he became absolutely
[0:36] fearless in his testimony
[0:38] now now now when they came up to the to
[0:40] the river jordan there
[0:41] they we know the story and i mean i
[0:43] don't think anybody preaches on the old
[0:44] testament more thoroughly than brother
[0:45] samuel so i'm not going to tell you
[0:47] anything
[0:47] anything new but when they came up to
[0:49] the river jordan and they
[0:51] and they looked over there now 10 of
[0:52] them just saw giants
[0:55] but joshua and caleb saw something past
[0:57] the giants they were able to see past
[0:59] those giants and
[1:00] and and the other ones stopped there and
[1:01] all they could see was the wall of
[1:03] problems
[1:04] but but joshua and caleb were able to
[1:06] look over those giants and say there's a
[1:08] promised land over there
[1:09] there's there's a victory over there
[1:11] that's where we're supposed to be
[1:13] there's something
[1:13] pulling me over there to that promised
[1:16] land now for the other ten they couldn't
[1:18] help that they didn't have the vision of
[1:19] faith to see past the giants
[1:21] but joshua and caleb were ordained
[1:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:26] tens of millions of years before there
[1:28] were ever giants in the land
[1:30] they were ordained to overcome them
[1:34] it wasn't just it wasn't just i need to
[1:36] get over there but something was pulling
[1:37] them it was home
[1:39] it was where we need to be and i don't
[1:41] care how big the giant is
[1:43] that's where i belong over there you
[1:45] might as well just get out of the way
[1:46] now devil because i don't care how big
[1:48] you may look
[1:49] but i have eyes of faith to see past how
[1:52] tall you
[1:53] are and see that i'm supposed to be over
[1:55] there there is a promised land and i'm
[1:57] gonna receive the promise
[1:59] i can't speak for the other ten but for
[2:01] me i'm gonna receive the promise of that
[2:04] land over there
[2:05] by the ability to see through giants
[2:08] amen
[2:09] glory oh my what is that to a son of god
[2:12] absolutely fearless
[2:14] in his testimony didn't even question if
[2:17] we could overcome it
[2:19] didn't question how big they were amen
[2:21] joshua think about it he
[2:23] he worked in egypt building bricks and
[2:26] there the murmurs were in the wilderness
[2:27] well we should have just went back to
[2:29] egypt
[2:30] well they must not have worked very hard
[2:31] there
[2:33] oh it smells like garlic and onions i
[2:35] want to go back there and joshua said no
[2:38] no no no i've made too many bricks for
[2:40] the wrong pharaoh i've made too many
[2:41] walls for the wrong kingdom
[2:43] i'm not going to work for the wrong
[2:45] kingdom anymore but there's a kingdom
[2:47] over there
[2:48] that's mine where i am at home where i
[2:51] can build
[2:51] something where he has prepared a place
[2:53] for me to come and dwell
[2:55] that's where i belong now now joshua
[2:57] didn't question when they get across the
[2:58] river he didn't question
[3:00] how big the walls of jericho were now
[3:02] he's a brick builder he's a wall builder
[3:04] he knows the structural integrity of the
[3:06] wall
[3:06] and they could have chariot races on
[3:08] this wall and he thought my out of all
[3:09] the walls we built in egypt
[3:11] we never built one like that right
[3:14] oh my you think everybody around them
[3:16] thinking oh look that's never going to
[3:17] come down joshua didn't even question
[3:19] whether the wall would come down
[3:21] why because he was positionally placed
[3:24] to
[3:24] do it to perform the work that god had
[3:26] placed him there for amen
[3:28] joshua knew he was joshua so much so
[3:31] that
[3:31] he would draw his sword against the
[3:33] captain of the lord of the host and say
[3:34] are you for us
[3:35] or against us because if you're against
[3:37] us i'm going to cut you down right i
[3:39] know
[3:39] who i am and i know where my feet are
[3:42] planted
[3:42] i know whom i have believed in joshua
[3:46] was fearless in his testimony
[3:49] no question in joshua's life we're going
[3:52] over
[3:53] we're going over i'm not going back for
[3:55] onions i've tasted grapes
[3:57] the evidence has already come back we've
[4:00] already tasted of the land amen
[4:03] my god
[4:07] when you get positionally placed
[4:10] now maybe for some of our testimonies it
[4:12] comes a different way we might come
[4:14] along like brother gideon
[4:16] we might just be working in the field
[4:18] one day
[4:20] just frustrations rising up on every
[4:22] side and man i'm sick and tired of this
[4:25] i'm just tired of this job i'm tired of
[4:27] working i'm tired of slaving away i'm
[4:28] just
[4:29] they come and they steal it and they
[4:30] take it i'm tired of this sickness
[4:31] attacking my body i'm tired of my family
[4:34] wandering off i'm tired of of me always
[4:36] having to be the one to pull them back
[4:37] i'm just tired of this
[4:39] and you got to the moment of frustration
[4:40] brother graham said desperation
[4:42] produces a miracle and he got to that
[4:45] moment in his life
[4:47] he said if god before us then whereby
[4:49] are the miracles yeah
[4:50] and i can't tell you how many times i've
[4:52] been asked that question in the last
[4:53] couple years
[4:54] well if the message is true then where
[4:56] we are the miracles
[4:57] and i just love it when somebody asks me
[4:59] that because they don't know my
[5:00] testimony
[5:01] they don't know me or where i came from
[5:02] and how i used to just sit here on the
[5:04] front view like this brother
[5:06] and i was just a good hypocrite i could
[5:08] just sit here and
[5:09] yeah amen i knew right when to say it i
[5:12] knew exactly when i mean i grew up in
[5:13] church my dad was a pastor
[5:15] i just grew up and i would say amen hey
[5:18] man yeah
[5:18] once a while stand up and man everybody
[5:20] probably thought i was just the real
[5:22] deal but i knew on the inside
[5:24] there wasn't anything happening there
[5:26] was no life behind that i would go home
[5:27] and i would
[5:28] i know i lay down at night and i would
[5:30] know i didn't have what it would take if
[5:31] god would come tomorrow
[5:35] the real miracle is overcoming that
[5:37] spirit is overcoming this layout to see
[5:39] is overcoming
[5:40] what what we think is just church and
[5:42] some form of tradition or some
[5:44] ecclesiastical approach to this this is
[5:46] not a theology
[5:47] no man taught me this and and i had to
[5:50] go back and rewash everything that i
[5:52] thought i knew about the message about
[5:53] the bible when i really met the one who
[5:55] wrote it
[5:56] it all became a different book to me
[5:58] when i really met the jesus christ
[6:00] who produced the message then it all
[6:02] became something different to me it
[6:04] wasn't just a man came and he
[6:06] said these things and if you don't
[6:07] believe he's a prophet then you're
[6:09] you know and this and this you know how
[6:10] we do
[6:13] but when i met the christ that wrote the
[6:17] message that spoke through william
[6:19] branham
[6:19] that gave him the inspiration then it
[6:22] became something real in my life then
[6:23] there was an anchor there that would
[6:25] hold me down and then when i laid down
[6:26] at night
[6:27] i knew i would have the goods when the
[6:30] time came but there's
[6:31] that is a miracle that's taking place in
[6:33] this time yes
[6:34] don't let the enemy come in and say well
[6:36] where if god before us
[6:38] then where be all his miracles my
[6:41] friends we could go by and pass the mic
[6:43] one we won't but
[6:44] one by one testimony after testimony
[6:48] after testimony and you might feel
[6:50] discouraged in yourself
[6:51] but there's something about a victory
[6:53] that needs to be waived
[6:55] [Music]
[6:56] something about a victory that needs to
[6:58] be waved high it might just be a small
[6:59] testimony in your life but it could mean
[7:01] the world
[7:02] to somebody else that might have just
[7:04] been david had already
[7:05] david had already killed goliath but it
[7:07] was when he picked up his head and waved
[7:08] it then it rallied the troops that was
[7:10] the real testimony there
[7:12] if we could just look at what god is
[7:14] doing in our life not what he's
[7:16] done years past and we met him 30 years
[7:18] ago but today
[7:20] what is he doing today in our life he's
[7:22] the same god today
[7:24] producing signs wonders and miracles to
[7:27] be fearless
[7:28] in our testimony that nobody could stand
[7:31] in front of us
[7:32] right we could go down through the bible
[7:34] story after story
[7:36] and just take heroes of faith that were
[7:38] built for their position
[7:40] that were built for their time david was
[7:43] built for his time
[7:45] he was he was thought of by god before
[7:47] there ever was
[7:49] a kingdom for him to to to rule over
[7:52] before there ever was a heart for him to
[7:54] play right he was thought of by god
[7:57] to fill that spot brother braham says
[7:59] the same exact thing about david
[8:01] when david recognized his position
[8:05] he became fearless that's right
[8:07] absolutely
[8:08] fearless now we we look at that and we
[8:09] think well that's that's wonderful for a
[8:11] warrior
[8:12] but how does that affect me imagine what
[8:15] we could do if we could overcome every
[8:16] fear
[8:18] every fear every anxiety every pressure
[8:21] every opposition if we could get
[8:23] positionally placed
[8:24] in the body of christ we could become
[8:27] fearless
[8:28] the same promise i believe the bride is
[8:31] is there i believe she's rising up
[8:33] to that position where she's recognizing
[8:36] the devil
[8:37] ain't got enough that's right he doesn't
[8:39] have enough power he doesn't have enough
[8:41] force and he he's come at me with
[8:42] everything he's
[8:43] he can come against me with but he
[8:45] doesn't have enough to do it
[8:47] because i've been commissioned to
[8:49] overcome him in this age
[8:51] we could take paul the apostle and all
[8:54] the all the discouragements he had to
[8:56] overcome and
[8:56] and having to go back and rewrite his
[8:58] entire life when he finally met the one
[9:01] it was just i mean nobody could teach
[9:02] moses like paul nobody could teach
[9:05] abraham like paul he knew it in and out
[9:06] he knew the books and that was his whole
[9:08] life was spent studying it
[9:10] but he didn't know the one that's right
[9:12] who wrote the book he didn't know the
[9:14] one
[9:14] who was there on earth but when he met
[9:16] him on that road
[9:18] everything changed for paul everything
[9:21] became new for paul he was positionally
[9:23] placed and then look at paul's character
[9:26] being placed there
[9:28] nobody could shake paul from his place
[9:30] not even other apostles that walked and
[9:32] talked with him and ate with them
[9:34] they would come against paul paul said
[9:35] nobody can take this from me
[9:37] because i met the one i met him on the
[9:39] road
[9:40] he came to me when i wasn't looking for
[9:42] him i was persecuting his church
[9:45] i was killing his people and he came to
[9:47] me
[9:48] that's the god we serve when he's ready
[9:50] for us when he does the choosing
[9:53] he will meet us where we're at it
[9:55] doesn't matter how weak in faith we are
[9:57] it doesn't matter how discouraged we are
[9:59] it doesn't matter what we did yesterday
[10:00] when it's time
[10:02] for him to meet us he'll come to us
[10:06] and paul recognized that something
[10:09] greater
[10:09] than words on a page something greater
[10:12] than just these scrolls i've been
[10:14] pouring my life into
[10:15] i met the living person of jesus christ
[10:19] am i to think that paul's correct
[10:21] courageous spirit after that
[10:23] yeah you could lock him up
[10:26] you could put him in prison you could
[10:28] put a cease and desist order on his
[10:30] church
[10:31] you could tell him he couldn't have
[10:32] service there anymore you could tell
[10:34] them that they're coming to
[10:34] they're coming to kill you paul and he
[10:36] would still have church
[10:38] might think to preach like paul would
[10:40] preach and to preach with with such
[10:42] power and demonstration of the gospel
[10:45] not even
[10:46] not even knowing human body
[10:49] but he met the person
[10:54] amen martin luther was built for his age
[10:59] came into his time to oppose the
[11:01] greatest force on earth at that time
[11:04] amen built for it he was built to
[11:07] overcome that
[11:08] he was built to resist the catholic
[11:10] church he was built to resist it and
[11:12] they put a cease and desist
[11:14] letter now brother samuel if you show up
[11:15] to church and there's a cease and desist
[11:17] letter
[11:17] i mean if it were me i'm like well i
[11:20] don't know i don't know what i'll do but
[11:21] martin luther was built for that exact
[11:23] position
[11:24] to tear the letter off said we're having
[11:26] church i don't know if anybody
[11:28] else is going to come but we're going to
[11:29] have church he was built for that
[11:31] position we cannot take his place
[11:33] he was built for that place john wesley
[11:36] was built for his position
[11:39] i believe john wesley uh traveled over
[11:42] 250
[11:43] 000 miles in his lifetime preaching the
[11:46] gospel
[11:46] and this was before cars this was on
[11:49] foot or on horseback or by wagon
[11:51] 250 000 miles
[11:55] he went to preach the gospel he preached
[11:57] i think over 40
[11:58] 000 sermons in his lifetime amazing man
[12:02] of faith
[12:03] he was built for that right i can't have
[12:06] john wesley's spot
[12:08] but he can't have my spot either amen
[12:11] he was built to be a forerunner of this
[12:13] gospel he was created for that purpose
[12:16] peter cartwright was created for his
[12:18] purpose
[12:19] to come into a town and say i'm going to
[12:21] hold a revival in that town and no
[12:22] matter who comes against me
[12:24] i'm gonna have church in this town there
[12:25] will be souls won and
[12:27] and there will be people one to christ
[12:28] in this town you know peter cartwright
[12:30] we read that one story but in his
[12:31] lifetime he baptized over 12
[12:34] 000 people in the united states of
[12:37] america
[12:38] 12 000 people came to christ under peter
[12:41] cartwright's ministry
[12:42] he was built for that position
[12:46] now what are we built for now we're down
[12:48] to our time
[12:49] all right now we're down to our age we
[12:51] went through these other ages and and
[12:52] through the church ages
[12:54] god has placed men so perfectly so but
[12:57] now we're in the final age
[12:59] so what's our commission going to be
[13:01] it's going to be to win it it's going to
[13:03] be to fulfill
[13:04] all that those ages had promised would
[13:06] come there will be a fulfillment of
[13:08] those things
[13:09] and them which have been sawn asunder
[13:11] which have been pulled apart which have
[13:12] been burned at the stake which have been
[13:14] fed to the lions which have been which
[13:16] have been hung across which have been
[13:18] boiled in oil
[13:19] all those people that we can testify
[13:21] about cannot be made perfect
[13:23] without you this morning cannot be made
[13:25] perfect without this
[13:27] church this morning it's not just
[13:29] testimonies of men past
[13:30] but they're looking at you this morning
[13:32] saying finish the work which we started
[13:35] finish that gospel which we started run
[13:38] with this message that was preached
[13:40] that before time god saw us finishing
[13:43] this word
[13:44] [Music]
[13:47] you know brother brahm said we're given
[13:48] a greater responsibility
[13:51] than abraham than even enoch
[13:54] we're given a greater opportunity this
[13:57] morning we
[13:57] realize how perfectly orchestrated this
[14:00] is this morning
[14:04] he built us for this purpose ephesians 1
[14:07] said
[14:07] blessed be the god and father of our
[14:09] lord jesus christ who hath blessed
[14:11] us with all spiritual blessings in
[14:13] heavenly places in christ according as
[14:15] he had chosen
[14:16] us in him before the foundation of the
[14:19] world
[14:20] that we should be holy and without blame
[14:22] before him in love
[14:23] having predestinated unto the adoption
[14:27] of the children by jesus christ to
[14:29] himself
[14:29] according to the good pleasure of his
[14:31] will to the praise of the glory of his
[14:33] grace
[14:34] wherein he hath made us accepted
[14:37] in the beloved in whom we have
[14:38] redemption through his blood
[14:40] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[14:42] riches of his grace
[14:44] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[14:47] all wisdom and prudence having made
[14:49] known unto
[14:50] us the mystery of his will according to
[14:53] his good pleasure
[14:54] which he had purposed in himself my
[14:58] if there's a scripture that defines us
[15:00] it's that one right there what are we to
[15:02] do
[15:02] we are to fulfill the word we are to
[15:05] manifest the promises that before the
[15:07] foundation of the world
[15:08] i know we say that phrase all the time
[15:10] but we can just think about it
[15:12] and we can just think about the billions
[15:13] of light years that have gone on before
[15:15] us
[15:16] that have happened before he said let
[15:18] there be
[15:19] let there be we were already here and if
[15:22] we were
[15:22] already here then we already overcame it
[15:25] and we're
[15:26] over there if we could just look at this
[15:28] as just a little hickey of time
[15:29] but we're coming out of that hickey
[15:31] we're swinging out of that loop of time
[15:33] back into eternity where we came from
[15:35] amen
[15:36] i believe job recognized who he was
[15:39] i believe joe had a moment in his life
[15:41] where he had to look back and think well
[15:43] who am i anyway
[15:44] all right what is this all about why am
[15:46] i here who who
[15:48] who am i he recognized i was built
[15:52] on this rock and job had to think back
[15:54] past his spiritual amnesia and get back
[15:56] to the beginning
[15:57] i was there i was there when the sons of
[16:00] god shouted for joy
[16:02] that's where i was nobody can take my
[16:05] place because i saw myself over there
[16:08] i was there when they shouted for joy i
[16:11] know it because i see myself
[16:13] over there why when job got the
[16:17] revelation
[16:18] he was made for that moment what moment
[16:22] are we made for this morning i was there
[16:26] oh when we recognize who it is in front
[16:29] of us
[16:29] when we recognize what we've been
[16:31] presented with in this day
[16:33] it's not just tapes and books it's not
[16:35] just letters on a page
[16:36] it's not just powerful sermons it's not
[16:38] just it's not just men trying to
[16:40] trying to do something but it's god it's
[16:43] christ
[16:44] it's christ and his people in his body
[16:48] bringing forth the finish line amen
[16:51] amen i don't know i don't know how
[16:53] everybody else believes but i believe
[16:55] we're we're called to a higher age i'm
[16:57] not part of this laodicea i don't desire
[16:59] to be part of this leo to see i'm not i
[17:01] don't desire to be wishy-washy
[17:03] or lukewarm or cold or just maybe in
[17:06] church or maybe out of church or just to
[17:08] fill a seed i don't desire any of that
[17:10] but i desire to be on fire for god i
[17:13] desire to have a fresh fire with god
[17:15] every day that i know
[17:16] i know i know where i'm going when this
[17:19] is all over i know that in a moment in
[17:21] the twinkling of an
[17:22] eye when the last trump shall sound i
[17:25] will be caught up
[17:26] i will be caught up i will not taste to
[17:29] death because i know i've been
[17:31] positionally placed into the body of
[17:33] christ
[17:34] there are some standing here which shall
[17:37] not taste of death i believe that with
[17:39] all my heart
[17:40] it's not just a word on the paper but
[17:43] there are some in this building
[17:45] that shall not taste of death that no
[17:48] other church age could fulfill
[17:50] that paul could not fulfill that peter
[17:52] cartwright could not
[17:53] fulfill that john wesley cannot fulfill
[17:56] but there are some
[17:57] standing here that will never taste of
[17:59] death
[18:01] because we recognize our position in the
[18:04] body of christ
[18:07] there's not enough demons in hell that
[18:09] can stop that from coming forth
[18:12] coming into place recognizing your day
[18:16] and its message then if jesus defeated
[18:19] satan upon the faith of knowing who he
[18:21] was
[18:21] he was a predestinated creature are you
[18:24] ready
[18:26] what about the predestinated bride of
[18:27] jesus christ now
[18:29] you believe the bride is predestinated
[18:32] the predestinated bride of christ now
[18:34] the church the word seed with everything
[18:36] that god promised to put in the church
[18:38] in it right now it's in it now
[18:42] everything is in order the holy spirit
[18:45] has been given the seed has been sowed
[18:47] the evening lights has been shining
[18:49] the sign of sodom that jesus promised is
[18:51] here and malachi 4
[18:53] a predestinated church and then he says
[18:56] oh devil
[18:58] oh devil the church of the living god
[19:00] here and on tape 2 do you know where you
[19:03] stand
[19:04] do you know that you were called of god
[19:07] that the holy ghost reigns in your heart
[19:09] and every word of god is real to you
[19:11] oh brother how is satan going to stand
[19:14] against that
[19:17] how is he going to stop that from
[19:19] growing how is he going to keep them
[19:22] signs from following it while you could
[19:23] throw them in jail
[19:25] they if you could i don't care what you
[19:27] do they done tried it they rotted in
[19:29] jails
[19:30] they was fed to lines they were sawed
[19:32] asunder
[19:33] they were jerk to pieces you can't kill
[19:35] it
[19:37] you can't kill this a church that's
[19:40] predestinated
[19:41] those who he foreknew like he did jesus
[19:44] he was called those who he called he has
[19:47] justified
[19:48] and those who he had justified he has
[19:51] already glorified
[19:52] predestinated you can't kill this move
[19:55] of god
[19:56] you cannot kill this church you cannot
[19:58] kill this message from going out you can
[20:00] come against it
[20:01] with every demon in hell but you cannot
[20:04] kill the influence of this message in
[20:06] this hour
[20:06] because it's predestinated to reach that
[20:09] last one
[20:10] and we will be caught up and changed
[20:13] even our mortal bodies
[20:14] changed to immortality in the moment of
[20:17] a twinkling of an eye you cannot kill it
[20:20] [Applause]
[20:23] you can throw me in jail you can ship me
[20:25] to another country
[20:26] you can lock the doors you cannot kill
[20:29] what god has spoken
[20:30] amen when we recognize
[20:34] what we are really encountering in this
[20:36] life
[20:37] it's not just uh it's not just god said
[20:40] in prophet but why did he send him
[20:43] what is he saying amen what was his
[20:46] message
[20:49] what what do you think he what think he
[20:52] yeah of this message right right what is
[20:54] it to you
[20:56] is it just something that you were born
[20:58] into and your parents believed it and it
[21:00] was good ethics and good morals and so
[21:02] but what is it to you amen what thank
[21:05] you peter
[21:06] that's good whom say ye that i am
[21:10] yeah and watch peter's life in one in
[21:12] one verse
[21:14] he says who who think he that i am peter
[21:16] who what do you say
[21:18] well some say some say the message is
[21:21] you know it's a false prophet and he
[21:22] missed it there
[21:23] you know he he caught up there and some
[21:26] say he was god
[21:27] and we worship him and we baptize in his
[21:30] name
[21:31] some say this and some say that but what
[21:32] do you say peter
[21:35] where do you stand amen and right there
[21:38] peter
[21:39] experiences a supernatural change
[21:43] i say that thou art the christ the son
[21:46] of the living god
[21:49] flesh and blood hath not revealed this
[21:51] unto you
[21:53] but my father which is in heaven hath
[21:55] revealed this to you
[21:56] and i say unto you upon this rock
[22:00] i will build my church and the gates of
[22:02] hell
[22:03] shall not prevail against it now look in
[22:05] the beginning of that verse he says
[22:06] simon barjona
[22:09] flesh and blood had not revealed this to
[22:10] you no school hath revealed this to you
[22:13] no no man hath revealed this to you but
[22:15] my father
[22:16] which is in heaven hath revealed this
[22:18] unto you and i
[22:20] say unto you thou art peter
[22:23] watch the change from one verse to the
[22:25] next he's simon barjona in this verse
[22:27] and then when he recognizes that he's
[22:29] standing in front of christ
[22:31] the son of the living god he becomes
[22:33] peter in the next verse and i say unto
[22:35] you
[22:36] that thou art peter and he got a name
[22:38] change just like saul did to paul
[22:40] when he realized he recognized this is
[22:43] christ
[22:44] in our midst this is not a man this is
[22:46] not some cheap legit magician's trick
[22:48] but this is christ and when he
[22:51] recognized it was christ he became peter
[22:53] and upon
[22:54] that revelation i will build my church
[22:57] when we can recognize that our name has
[22:59] changed
[23:00] from whatever we were born with whatever
[23:02] name we're called in this life
[23:04] it has changed to mrs jesus christ when
[23:07] we recognize
[23:08] it's him he's here it's not just a man
[23:11] but it's christ
[23:13] living touchable feelable
[23:17] walking amongst us he's here when we can
[23:20] recognize that we we
[23:22] change from simon barjona to peter
[23:26] and it's that revelation that i will
[23:28] build my church upon
[23:30] yeah to recognize we're not just in this
[23:32] walk to fulfill 70 years or no
[23:34] 60 years but we're set here in
[23:37] an eternal purpose
[23:41] and until god has completed that purpose
[23:43] there is
[23:44] no demon in hell there's no sickness
[23:47] there's no depression there's no
[23:49] suicidal spirit there is
[23:51] nothing that will stop that purpose from
[23:53] coming to pass because it was already
[23:55] thought of
[23:55] in god's mind now we're look we're
[23:58] talking about the eternal god
[24:00] yes sir the one who who he doesn't
[24:02] forget
[24:03] he doesn't forget his thoughts he's not
[24:06] he's not forgetful
[24:07] he doesn't think oh where did i where
[24:09] did i leave that thought where was that
[24:11] thought supposed to go but we're talking
[24:12] about an eternal god
[24:14] that created the heavens and the earth
[24:16] and he thought of you
[24:18] he knows right where you're at this
[24:20] morning he knows right what you're going
[24:21] through this morning because he's
[24:23] already thought of it
[24:24] before there ever was a trial to go
[24:26] through he already thought of this
[24:28] moment in time
[24:29] and he thought you an overcomer my i
[24:32] need a people that will go
[24:34] when that when the age is so dark when
[24:36] there's trials on every hand
[24:38] where there's sodom and gomorrah all
[24:40] around where there's depression all
[24:41] around when the gates of hell have
[24:43] lifted off the earth
[24:44] and their spiritual attacks on every
[24:46] corner i need somebody
[24:47] who will go and fulfill my word here am
[24:50] i lord
[24:51] here am i i'm unworthy woe is me but
[24:54] here am i lord
[24:55] send me send me let me fulfill that part
[24:59] of your word
[25:00] amen you can go oh my to think that god
[25:03] had confidence in us
[25:05] to send us to an age where nobody else
[25:08] could fulfill it but god hath perfectly
[25:10] ordained you to overcome in this age
[25:15] and they overcame it that's me
[25:18] yes sir and they me overcame him
[25:22] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[25:24] my testimony
[25:25] i overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[25:28] and the word of my testimony i know
[25:31] where we're standing
[25:32] you can't stop it right you can't kill
[25:34] it
[25:35] you can lock me up i'll still preach the
[25:37] gospel yes i don't know
[25:39] there's an attack coming against the
[25:40] church or you know what's happened is
[25:42] his ministry has let down the bars and
[25:44] they've let the goats in the church
[25:46] and then now they want to blame it on
[25:47] the messenger and they want to blame it
[25:49] on the people and say you're not living
[25:50] like you're supposed to you let down the
[25:51] bars
[25:52] you stop preaching holiness you stop
[25:54] preaching the holy ghost and you've let
[25:56] the goats in the church
[25:57] and now you want to blame it on the
[25:59] message
[26:00] oh don't blame don't blame your lack of
[26:02] ministry on the message of the hour
[26:04] for it's the vindicated truth what
[26:06] vindications does your ministry have
[26:08] behind it
[26:09] none but this message has been
[26:11] vindicated time
[26:12] after time after time it is the
[26:15] unadulterated word of god in this hour
[26:18] i know whom i have believed in i did not
[26:20] meet a man
[26:21] or a prophet or a kentuckian i met jesus
[26:24] christ
[26:25] through his message when we recognize
[26:30] that name change is taking place yes sir
[26:33] it's god's thoughts he can't change his
[26:36] thoughts
[26:37] he can't change you to be a little bit
[26:38] different or i wish i was just different
[26:40] i wish i could do this he made you
[26:42] thus intricately perfectly
[26:45] to fulfill this hour with abraham says
[26:48] look
[26:49] god through his prophet isaiah a man who
[26:52] had his ups and downs like we do
[26:53] had his mistakes like we do but god that
[26:56] man
[26:57] so yielded by being a prophet that his
[27:00] words
[27:00] god's thoughts hallelujah god's thoughts
[27:03] expressed through those mortal lifts of
[27:05] isaiah
[27:06] a man with sin and things i have with
[27:09] his ups and downs like i have
[27:11] and like you have but a yielded vessel
[27:13] to god
[27:14] express the thought god's thought
[27:18] through word and no matter what they
[27:20] done isaiah's words
[27:22] had to be fulfilled for it was god's
[27:25] thought expressed through isaiah
[27:29] no matter what you could do you cannot
[27:32] stop the promise of god from coming to
[27:34] pass
[27:39] you can't stop it right right i could
[27:42] try
[27:43] to try you can't stop it
[27:47] you might be able to kill me you can
[27:49] shoot me if god's done with my purpose
[27:51] it might be my time to go
[27:52] but you can't stop this promise from
[27:54] coming to pass
[27:55] you cannot stop that there will be a
[27:58] body change
[27:59] you cannot stop that god will come down
[28:01] one more time
[28:02] and catch his bride away you cannot stop
[28:05] that because it's already been promised
[28:06] to happen
[28:07] by a greater authority than any power on
[28:10] earth by a greater authority than the
[28:12] president of the united
[28:13] states the greater authority than satan
[28:15] and all his demons but god
[28:17] who is rich in mercy said there will be
[28:19] a people
[28:20] that will overcome every trial that will
[28:23] overcome every demon that will overcome
[28:25] every affliction
[28:26] and they will overcome that age
[28:29] and be caught up i believe that's me
[28:32] excuse me if i get a little excited but
[28:33] i put my name there
[28:34] i put my face right there next to that
[28:37] because god
[28:38] saw me he called me he played i didn't
[28:41] i wasn't looking for him i was just
[28:42] wearing out a seat
[28:44] i was just wearing that a pew brother
[28:46] i'm just going to be honest okay
[28:48] i was just wearing it i was a good old
[28:49] message pharisee i could finish your
[28:51] quotes
[28:52] it didn't do me one looking good until i
[28:55] actually came in contact with him until
[28:58] i met the one who produced the message
[29:00] until i met the one that actually spoke
[29:02] the words until i recognized that he
[29:05] is here amen then everything changed
[29:10] oh my then it wasn't just me trying it
[29:12] was god pulling
[29:13] it wasn't just me like trying to force
[29:15] my way through but god was picking me up
[29:17] god was pulling me along because there
[29:19] was something in there that woke up
[29:21] something in there was activated by the
[29:24] presence of god and i knew
[29:26] i'm more than just this few years on
[29:27] this earth where were you job
[29:30] where were you i was there where were
[29:33] you brother brian
[29:34] i was there when the sons of god shouted
[29:36] for joy something in me recognized my
[29:39] position in this time
[29:41] we're there prophet said there you are
[29:44] hallelujah oh god upon this rock i'll
[29:47] build my church
[29:48] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[29:50] against it oh my when the world is no
[29:52] more
[29:53] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[29:55] word shall never pass away
[29:57] why he was expressing in word the
[30:00] thought
[30:00] of the almighty god my that's powerful
[30:04] and when we by faith can accept that
[30:07] word
[30:07] it's got to become material
[30:10] oh how it thrills my heart to think thy
[30:13] word forever in heaven lord is confirmed
[30:16] what god's thoughts is he expresses them
[30:19] in words and here is the living word of

[30:35] mind of god you might have had trouble
[30:36] and spilt something on the other one but
[30:38] you're wearing that one because it was
[30:39] in god's mind

[30:44] who are unsure about why this guy's up
[30:46] here screaming but yes you

[31:29] that heareth my words and believeth on
[31:30] him that sent me half everlasting life
[31:33] and shall not come into condemnation but
[31:35] has passed from death into life

[32:02] can just see a vision happening we could
[32:04] no but he that heareth my words he that
[32:07] believeth him that
[32:08] sent me it is not a just a man but it's
[32:11] god

[32:41] away but
[32:42] that eternal word that thought that's in
[32:44] your heart
[32:45] that's expressed by god can no more fail
[32:48] than isaiah's words could fail behold a
[32:51] virgin

[35:03] commission in the history of time
[35:08] even you oh my we're always putting
[35:12] pointing out how wicked the world is
[35:13] getting but you fail to see how powerful
[35:15] the church is getting
[35:20] at the same time she is rising up
[35:23] standing on the field oh she's a little
[35:26] but
[35:27] flock but brother god is with her and
[35:30] she is going to triumph just as certain
[35:32] as christ
[35:33] rose from the dead god's church shall
[35:36] never fail
[35:37] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[35:39] against it showed they would be against
[35:41] it but they cannot prevail
[35:43] the church is going to triumph through
[35:46] the blood of jesus christ
[35:48] through a victory march i'm positive of
[35:50] this one
[35:51] thing that god will have a church
[35:54] without spot
[35:56] wrinkle or blemish amen i'm so happy
[35:58] about that he says
[35:59] i am positive of this one thing
[36:03] i believe it's us i believe they without
[36:06] us
[36:07] cannot be made perfect he's speaking to
[36:10] us
[36:10] this morning he can't be made perfect
[36:13] without you
[36:14] he made you for that spot
[36:17] he whittled you down he shaved you down
[36:20] he took the time to carve you out
[36:22] so you could fit right in this spot
[36:26] i won't fit in your spot moses won't fit
[36:29] in your spot
[36:30] joshua won't fit in your spot right but
[36:33] the same elements that were in those men
[36:34] are in you
[36:36] together we make the body of christ
[36:39] but they those great heroes of faith if
[36:42] time
[36:43] if time could go on we would we would we
[36:45] would tell of the stories of the heroes
[36:47] of faith
[36:49] but they without you
[36:52] amen cannot be made perfect
[36:56] things are already set in motion there's
[36:58] nothing
[36:59] that can change it there's nothing that
[37:02] can stop it
[37:03] there is a bride coming to age in this
[37:06] time
[37:07] and it doesn't matter how many spirits
[37:08] come against her it doesn't matter how
[37:10] many doctrines sweep through the church
[37:12] it doesn't matter how many people fall
[37:14] away it doesn't matter how many people
[37:15] lose faith
[37:16] but there is a pride that is coming to
[37:19] age
[37:20] she is at the age where she's she's
[37:22] recognizing who she
[37:23] is she's recognizing the authority that
[37:26] she's been given
[37:26] she's recognizing that he had poured
[37:28] himself into her
[37:30] and when he says if you say under this
[37:32] mountain
[37:33] be that movement it's not by her power
[37:35] but it's by his power
[37:37] she's speaking on behalf of her
[37:39] bridegroom
[37:40] i believe that's us i believe we're
[37:42] fulfilling that i believe we are built
[37:45] for that
[37:46] somebody's going to fulfill this word
[37:49] why not me
[37:50] somebody's going to fulfill it it's me
[37:53] god made me for that position
[37:54] god made me to perform it god made me
[37:57] and fashioned me and molded me
[38:00] in all my inconsistencies in all
[38:04] my failures and all my misunderstandings
[38:07] and my slothfulness towards him and how
[38:09] i haven't i haven't really lived my life
[38:11] the way i should towards him and
[38:12] how i just kind of put him on the back
[38:14] burner but one day
[38:17] he's going to call and wake up that seed
[38:20] in you
[38:21] wake it up and say it's time it's time
[38:24] to come to age
[38:25] it's time to come up on a little higher
[38:27] oh you might not even be looking for him
[38:28] but he's looking for you
[38:30] he knows right where you're at he knows
[38:32] your frame he knows exactly what you're
[38:34] thinking he put the thoughts in there
[38:36] before the foundation of the world
[38:37] that would bring you to overcome
[38:41] he's not shocked by covid he's not
[38:43] scared by this
[38:45] he's not thrown off his you know his
[38:47] plan because we think changing things up
[38:49] but no
[38:50] it was even the government that put
[38:51] pressure on mary and joseph to bring
[38:54] bring jesus to bethlehem because it had
[38:56] to be bethlehem
[38:57] so all things work together according to
[38:59] the to the good of those that love the
[39:01] lord and are called according to his
[39:02] purpose
[39:03] it was the government that put the
[39:04] pressure on him right this hasn't thrown
[39:06] that
[39:07] it hasn't thrown god off no not at all
[39:10] but it's
[39:10] to it's to get our attention is to focus
[39:14] it's to get us down and really realize
[39:17] what are we doing here
[39:19] i believe we know that's right amen i
[39:22] believe we know
[39:23] we were fashioned to overcome
[39:26] the greatest adversary that there ever
[39:30] has been in time
[39:31] amen defeated so many before us
[39:35] he's he's the champion of this world
[39:38] he's defeated
[39:39] time after time after time he's taken
[39:42] him by cancer
[39:43] he's taken him by depression he's taken
[39:45] him by diabetes he's taken him by
[39:47] congestive heart failure he's taking
[39:48] them off of your time after time
[39:50] after time he took him on the cross
[39:56] but we yes we
[39:59] were fashioned to overcome the greatest
[40:02] adversary that time has ever known
[40:05] amen not by our our will not by our
[40:08] weakness
[40:09] but by his strength he said if we could
[40:11] just yield
[40:13] he can declare his character through
[40:15] your yielding
[40:17] amen god's character declared
[40:20] through our yielding he said empty up
[40:22] church there's more of god to have
[40:24] that's me that's my prayer lord i know
[40:26] that there's more of you out there to
[40:27] have
[40:28] lord i know you i i have the holy ghost
[40:31] i have an experience with you but lord
[40:32] there's more of you to have
[40:33] lord let me empty out everything that i
[40:35] am let me empty out every thought
[40:37] let me empty out every question lord
[40:39] every every inability let me empty it
[40:41] out because there's more of you to come
[40:43] and fill me
[40:43] let your character be manifest in my
[40:46] life
[40:47] oh god help us we have a greater
[40:50] opportunity
[40:52] we are the masterpiece of god
[40:55] yes sir you might look at disappear say
[40:59] who buddy
[41:03] but you are the masterpiece
[41:06] it took it took michelangelo's whole
[41:08] life he saw it in a vision
[41:10] when he was just a boy it took him his
[41:11] whole life to craft it
[41:14] god has taken billions of years
[41:18] to make you yeah and you might think
[41:20] well
[41:21] you know i'm just not able or
[41:24] i'm just too weak in faith but god
[41:27] took billions of years to make you for
[41:30] this moment
[41:32] this moment in time and he and he built
[41:34] the statue so perfectly
[41:36] and it looked so amazing and he just
[41:39] thought it should be real
[41:40] he thought it should speak he thought it
[41:42] should have a commission he thought it
[41:44] should have something to do
[41:45] and so he we know the story he struck it
[41:46] with his with his hammer
[41:48] and said speak speak
[41:53] what are we commissioned to do in this
[41:54] hour speak
[41:56] yes and under her messenger
[42:01] she will be the final voice to the final
[42:04] age
[42:05] you've been commissioned to speak it's
[42:07] not just a
[42:08] maybe she'll speak or she's going to get
[42:10] to the point where she's going to speak
[42:12] but
[42:12] it's the confession of god's word and
[42:14] his thought that she will
[42:16] speak she will be the one
[42:19] she will overcome under their messenger
[42:22] he will hear only from god and he will
[42:24] have thus saith the lord
[42:26] and speak for god he will be god's
[42:28] mouthpiece and he as it is declared in
[42:30] malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the
[42:32] children back to the fathers
[42:34] he will bring back the elect to the last
[42:36] day and they will hear a vindicated
[42:38] prophet
[42:39] give the exact truth that they is us
[42:42] they will hear
[42:43] as it was with paul he will restore the
[42:45] truth as
[42:46] they had it and those elect with him in
[42:49] that day
[42:50] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[42:53] lord
[42:53] and be his body and be his voice and
[42:56] perform his works
[42:58] hallelujah do you see it god sent luther
[43:02] with the word the lutheran spoke for god
[43:04] at that time
[43:05] but they organized and again the pure
[43:07] word was lost for organization tends
[43:09] towards dogma
[43:10] and creeds and not simple word thank god
[43:14] they could no longer speak for god then
[43:16] god sent wesley
[43:17] and he was the voice with the word in
[43:19] his day the people who took his
[43:20] revelation for god became living
[43:22] epistles read and known of all men for
[43:24] their generation
[43:25] when the methodist failed god raised up
[43:27] others and so it has gone through the
[43:29] years
[43:29] until this last day now i know we
[43:33] probably know that quote and we can
[43:34] recite it
[43:35] but it's talking about us until
[43:38] this last day there is again another
[43:42] people
[43:42] in the land who under their messenger
[43:45] will be the final voice
[43:47] to the final age yes sir the church is
[43:50] no longer the mouthpiece of god
[43:52] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[43:54] turning on her he will confound her
[43:56] through the prophet
[43:57] and the bride for the bride of god will
[44:00] be in her
[44:01] yes it is for it says in the last
[44:03] chapter of revelations verse 17 the
[44:05] spirit and the bride say come once more
[44:08] the world will hear direct from god as
[44:11] in pentecost
[44:12] but of course that word bride will be
[44:14] repudiated as it is in the first stage
[44:16] now he has cried out to this last age
[44:19] you have the word
[44:20] you have more bibles than ever but
[44:22] you're not doing anything about the word
[44:24] except dividing and hacking it into
[44:26] pieces
[44:28] taking what you want and leaving out
[44:30] what you don't want you are not
[44:32] interested in living it
[44:33] but debating it i would sooner you were
[44:36] cold or hot
[44:37] if you were cold and rejected i would
[44:38] stand that if you would get a white hot
[44:41] and know it's the truth and live it i
[44:42] would praise you for that but when you
[44:44] simply take my word and don't honor it
[44:46] i in return must refuse to honor you i
[44:48] will spew you out
[44:50] for you nauseate me those are heavy
[44:52] words that does not apply to me
[44:56] now anybody knows that it is a lukewarm
[44:58] water that makes you sick at the stomach
[45:00] if you need a nemetic lukewarm water is
[45:02] about the best thing to drink
[45:05] you want healing get hot a lukewarm
[45:08] church has made god sick and he has
[45:10] declared he will spew it out
[45:11] reminds us of how he felt just before
[45:14] the flood doesn't it
[45:15] oh my as we look at the church around in
[45:17] this age
[45:18] oh would to god that the church were
[45:20] cold or hot
[45:21] best of all she would be fervent hot
[45:25] sentence has been passed she is no
[45:26] longer god's voice to the world she will
[45:28] maintain that she is but god
[45:30] says not that's pretty dark but i like
[45:32] this last sentence here
[45:34] oh god still has a voice for the people
[45:37] of the world
[45:38] even as he has given a voice to the
[45:42] bride
[45:44] amen it's our commission to speak it's
[45:47] our position to speak we're not
[45:48] presuming
[45:49] we're not venturing outside our ability
[45:51] but we were put here
[45:53] to speak we were put here to be a
[45:55] repeater
[45:56] we were put here to be to be a a lips
[45:59] of living flesh that could preach this
[46:01] gospel that could
[46:02] that could speak this word into
[46:04] existence now we don't have need of
[46:06] squirrels
[46:07] i personally don't have need of
[46:08] squirrels but i have the same authority
[46:11] within me that produce those squirrels i
[46:14] have the same authority
[46:15] within me to bring to pass whatever i
[46:18] have need of in my life
[46:19] if you say unto this mountain and do not
[46:21] doubt in your heart
[46:22] it shall be removed you have yet been
[46:26] given the same authority
[46:28] that has been handed down from the
[46:30] almighty god
[46:31] you may not need squirrels you may not
[46:33] need a pocket knife
[46:35] you may not need a lamp to shake but
[46:36] you've been given an authority
[46:39] to speak over your mountain this morning
[46:42] amen oh if we could just look past the
[46:44] giant that giant is nothing before god
[46:46] oh what is that mountain before you
[46:48] zerubbabel right it's nothing before a
[46:50] son or daughter of god because you've
[46:52] been given authority
[46:53] not by man not by a pastor not by even a
[46:57] prophet
[46:57] but by god almighty has said you have i
[47:01] chosen
[47:02] to speak my word yes amen
[47:05] and move forward
[47:08] satan's done everything he could at us

[47:49] kind of a foggy idea every kind of
[47:51] indecision
[47:52] every kind of question i'm still here
[47:55] even though he attacks your body with
[47:57] cancer even though he attacks your body
[47:59] with diabetes or whatever sickness

[48:04] because you've been made
[48:05] to be an overcomer in this age you
[48:08] weren't just made to fill a seat

[48:11] harmony you were made
[48:13] to fulfill the promised word of the hour
[48:16] and speak speak
[48:20] we've been tried we've been shaped we've
[48:23] been
[48:23] formed you know brother bam said that
[48:26] that
[48:27] that when the three hebrew children went
[48:29] into the fire
[48:31] they sent the mightiest soldiers they
[48:33] had to bind them
[48:35] how stupid is the devil are you stupid
[48:39] he sent the mightiest soldiers he had to
[48:42] guard them them three boys from going to
[48:44] the fire he said turn it up seven times
[48:46] hotter
[48:46] i'm gonna send my best men in there how
[48:48] stupid is he
[48:52] they couldn't stand the heat come on
[48:55] brother they couldn't stand the heat
[48:57] brother baron said the only thing that
[48:59] it did that only thing the fire did was
[49:01] loose the bands
[49:02] the only thing it did was let it praise
[49:05] the only thing it did was let them raise
[49:06] their hands and kick their feet
[49:08] glory to god they watched every enemy
[49:10] that they had
[49:11] melt under the pressure of this age but
[49:14] they were made to
[49:15] overcome the fire they had another one
[49:18] with them
[49:18] it wasn't their own flesh it wasn't
[49:20] their body but there was another one
[49:22] inside
[49:23] there was a fourth man there's a fourth
[49:26] light in this age that's coming forth
[49:28] and it will bring us through there's no
[49:31] demon
[49:32] there's no weapon there's nothing that
[49:34] can stop it because it's ordained of god
[49:36] it's only going to lose your bands
[49:38] church that trial you're going through
[49:40] is only going to lose your bands
[49:42] they shall overcome by the blood of the
[49:45] lamb
[49:46] and the words of their testimony one
[49:48] time satan had me bound
[49:50] all but thank god jesus set me free
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:09] here am i send me
[50:12] that devil might think he's got you
[50:14] bound he might have the hardest
[50:16] oppressive spirit on you
[50:17] that there ever has been on earth but
[50:19] they can't
[50:20] stand the heat
[50:22] [Applause]
[50:25] church we've been elected to overcome
[50:28] this thing
[50:30] yes sir after all the discouragement
[50:31] that paul went through
[50:33] after all the trials he fought after all
[50:35] the thorns in his flesh
[50:37] and after all the spiritual oppression
[50:39] he was under after after
[50:40] being seemingly the only one with the
[50:42] truth
[50:44] paul said this one thing i know glory
[50:47] that god is for me
[50:50] and if god before me who can't stand
[50:53] against me
[50:54] who can prevail against it though the
[50:56] gates of hell will come against
[50:58] it they shall not prevail and michael
[51:01] ward
[51:01] and the dragon ward and the dragon
[51:04] prevail not
[51:05] though the gates of hell are against us
[51:07] they will not prevail because it's been
[51:09] promised
[51:10] by the almighty father that you will be
[51:13] an overcomer in this age
[51:15] it's not for anybody else it's for you
