Heavenly Father Lord we approach you reverently Lord God as we stand behind this sacred desk they're gone and father we realized the responsibility Lord the lays upon our strollers or but I asked Lord that you help me to yield to you that you may be able to come and speak or to be an encouragement to the people dear God Lord made me renew ourselves today dear God I pray father for your guidance more than I pray Lord for every heart that's here this morning dear God that you will speak to them and help them I pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen and I want to read this morning from the book of Malachi chapter 3 I want to read verses 16 through 18 amen then they that feared the Lord speak often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not a man you may be seated I want to speak on this morning as book of remember book of remembrance it says here that those that feared the Lord spake often one to another and God hearkened and heard it and wrote it down in the book of remembrance God remembers what you say about him God remembers what you think about him it says for them that feared the Lord and thought upon his name those who think upon his name realize the power that we have in the name of Jesus that in that name anything we asked in that name God hears them there's power in his name and during this time that Malachi is writing here was a very sinful time in Israel and the priests had forsaken their duties and the the majority of Israel had went in the ways of sin and adultery and that in but there were some that stood faithful and stood true and they feared the Lord the Bible says and they and they spoke often one to another about him it's good to testify about the Lord and the things that he's done it's good to bring that to our remember for us too and also to bring it to the remembrance of others that our God is a good dog he's good all the time even in the hardest trials he's still good even in the worst seems of times of our lives God is still there he's still good he's the one that's able the only one capable of delivering us and our times of lead it's good to testify and God writes this down in a book of remembrance there's many books or spoke up that are going to be open at the judgement throughout the Bible these different books are spoke of David even speaks of a book of tears but there's different books there's a book of life and the Bible tells us there's a book that will be open that will in the days of judgment that will people will be judged according to their works by what is written but this is a book of remembrance that the Lord writes so that he has a book that remembers your praise to him remembers your conversation of him remembers your thoughts how that you when you're alone would take time to meditate upon the Lord that's wrote down and he remembers it I want to turn to first Corinthians chapter four and I want to read verses 14 through 17 and I want to look at something about remembering first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons I've warned you were though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel wherefore I beseech you to be followers of me I I can't help when I read that verse in this church but to think of brother brownie he fathered us into the gospel wherefore I beseech you be followers of me for this calls have I sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church now he didn't say that Timothy was going to bring them and remembrance of his of his words but of his way the way he handled the situations that how he dealt with people how he dealt with the churches in certain situations as we go to putting quotes together of this message with the scriptures it's very important to remember the character of the man that brought the message and that's what Paul is speaking of here that Timothy is not just going to bring them into remembrance of what Paul said but he was going to bring them into remembrance of the character of the man who spoke Paul said I've said Timothy not just to quote the message say what he said but to point to the character behind the life the character of the life behind the quote turns me to 1st Thessalonians chapter 2 verse nine first this only is chapter two verse nine for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of God Paul was reminding them of the vocation which he done among them he said I want to let you know I didn't do it for money I didn't do it for popularity and I was not there to bring a weight on you these are important to not only remember what the man preached but the way in which he preached it turn over to the third chapter of first Thessalonians 3rd chapter 6 verse but now when timotheus come came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that he had good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you Paul didn't say I'm happy to hear that you're quoting what I wrote it was it's important to say what Paul said it was to the people then it is today remember from brother Branham went beyond the curtain of time and they told him said you'll be judged first and then if you're accepted which you will be then your people will also be accepted and brother Branham asked the angel said will Paul have to stand that way and he said yes he would he said well praise God I I said what Paul said so it is important what Paul wanted the people to also remember he wanted them to remember him not just a message but remember him because the man and his message are one when you sever the message from the character that God brought it in through the man you've missed the message what is what was the message it was Christ and when you sever the man from his message you've missed it you've missed the message which was priced the message of our time is becoming be so different sometimes through the people becoming different than the character in which it was delivered we need to remember what kind of man brother Branham was we need to remember that the prophets life was a reflection of the character of the message message is more than just books and paints and quotes it's a life and that life has been projected to us to have the letter but not the spirit and character is death this message must be more to us than just saying what he said must be more than books tapes and quotes it must become our life not the life and character of a man meaning not imitating brother branham but the character of the message which is Christ living in you I have a quote here I want to read from the resume of the ages church age book and I want you to in this to receive what kind of a man it was that brought us this message and I want you to see he's not one to desired great wealth or great accomplishments or achievements but he desired to be a help to the people he says here not for one moment do I bring a message to people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no intention in those things but I do have interest in the things of God in people and if I can accomplish this one thing I'll be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men wherein men become new creep creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word now there may be some of you here this morning that are like me you grew up on the coast maybe some of you though have been here and you can say well it's I've been in this message for years but are we remembering the spirit in which the message came turns me to the first Timothy chapter 4 I want to read verses 1 through 6 now the spirit speaketh expressively in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer if thou put the Brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou past attained he's telling Timothy stir up their memories stir it up back to the faith stir it not to the law and the works and deeds of the law but stir it up to the grace of God stir it up that they that they remember always giving Thanksgiving unto God for all things in which they received stirring up their memories to the message that was bribe now to her to me to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 2 through 6 2 Timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with the pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that wood is in thee with dwelt first in thy mother grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also wherefore I put the in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands he's telling Timothy you need to be reminded of the vision of this messy he's tell him you need to be reminded of arc of your call and of your purpose we need to be reminded we all have a purpose they say I don't know what my purpose is to serve God to testify of his name to spread the good news you don't you don't have to have any special qualifications to spread the good news when Jesus appeared unto the woman at the tomb and said go tell my disciples she didn't have any special qualifications or special talents but she was instructed to go tell my disciples and Peter that I have arisen amen were to all give testimony that he is alive today that he lives within our hearts and that his works are it's not just us remembering things of the Scriptures but remembering things that has happened in our own lives remembering the faith that we had at the beginning remembering the faith in which we started out with I am going to call to your remembrance some of you something very simple showing of faith one time there was two sisters from this church they were working in the kitchen the camp-meeting in Michigan and they dropped the stem from the coffee pot down in the pipe and didn't know how to get it back and one of them said well I read in the Bible where God had an axe head to float when the Prophet stuck his stick in the water let's just lay hands on this pipe and pray God would have that stem to float up to the top I'm sure you know what happened that stem of that that car got floated up to the top of that pipe and they pulled it out that's just simple faith taking God at His Word if God could do it then he's the same yesterday today and forever he can do it now if he touched the life back then and changed it he can change the life today if he healed someone from a sickness in the past he's capable of healing them if you'll only believe today he was reminding Timothy we're not here to have a big church or big numbers he said we're here to bring the message of Christ to the people we're not here to impress people with our ministry we're here to help the bride get ready to go into rapture we're not here to argue debate and fuss over quotes were here to produce Christ [Music] old God remind us of what you called us to remind us amen of why you sent the message and why you opened our eyes to it remind us that we were in a age that was wretched poor and blind remind us you didn't have to open her eyes the song says you could have easily passed us by for the age we were living in was rich and poor and blind oh but then we heard recognizing your day oh yeah God opened our eyes not to a man but to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the thing that we must see in the man who brought the message is that he had the character of Jesus Christ that's the same character we're to have I want to be like Jesus as song says amen hooking second Timothy chapter 2 verse 13 through 15 listen carefully to this if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth Paul is reminding Timothy people will sometimes fall short sometimes they'll make mistakes but they are the people of God those that are sealed with the Holy Ghost though they make mistakes God cannot deny himself for it's himself that is in you hallelujah and he says put the people in remembrance of the word put them in remembrance what that if any man sin we have an advocate with the father amen remind them that their security is not within themselves hallelujah it's not security within our own righteousness for our righteousness the Bible says as filthy rags but that our security is in Christ who was the worthy one who was slain for our sins for all the sins of the world remaining it's not their works but it is the grace of Almighty God let's look in first Corinthians chapter 16 verse 10 now timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do he's telling the church here in Corinth you can trust Timothy he work at the same work as I do he'll carry on the work in like character he didn't say they were exactly like in flesh but he's saying that the character of the working of the work of the Lord is the same they can receive Timothy without fear they can know that the same God that was working through Paul was working through Timothy amen the same Holy Ghost that was leading the one was leading the other as well that this Minister this pastor Timothy was following in the character of the messenger olympians chapter 2 verse 19 through 22 but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state for I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are Jesus Christ but you know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served me in the gospel it was not that Timothy would have to report back to Paul the state of the church but Paul had confidence in Timothy knowing how Timothy would conduct himself and how Timothy would can would react and how Timothy the character of the Christ that Timothy had he knew that once Timothy got there no matter what had been going on no matter what state they previous had been in that they would come into a state of peace that he would lead and guide them and bring them into a well state turn me to Hebrews chapter 13 I want to read verses 7 and 8 I believe remember them that have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever he was reminding the church remember them to have the rule over you now that rule over you doesn't mean ruling as a king or ruling us some monarch but that the administration of Christ's headship was coming through that vessel and he's saying you can follow their faith because you can consider the end of their conversation you can consider their character their life and you can consider if they went on before us where they went I don't want to go there too so follow in the faith consider the conversation what was their conversation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now let's look in Philippians chapter 1 Philippians chapter 1 I want to begin reading verse 1 really exclusively down through verse 11 Paul and timotheus the servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are in Philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in so much as both in my bonds and in the deference and confirmation of the gospel ye all are in partakers of my grace for God is my record how greatly I longed after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere without offence until the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God I'm sorry I mispronounced the word there it should be in defense and confirmation of the gospel Paul was telling them I am in remembrance of you and here you can trust assure that he instructed Timothy to be in remembrance of the people remember the work of God in their lives remember that that he that's begun the good work is able to perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he's able to bring it he doesn't just start the work in US but he's gonna bring it to perfection he's telling them these churches are already they were already established they lay claim to Paul as their father in the gospel but Timothy still had to remind them of the faith and of the word that had been delivered by the messenger but I like that Paul says I am I think my god every members of you and that I think of you all because you are in my heart ministry such as this ministry that not only the ministry that you have here now currently but the ministry which established this church had you in their heart I know that brother browning when he began to see the different ones that had come in under his ministry coming back to serve God and did rededicate their lives to God it brought joy joy why because you were always in his heart paster never forgets anyone that his ministry has died they stay in his heart - a manner of which constantly prays for his people he prays knowing the struggles that you have God has made the pastor in such a way that the pastor can see beyond what just we present and see what we really are discernment of the word and when he sees us struggling he don't condemn us but he takes our names before God in prayer part of me heard me the second Peter chapter one now in this chapter Peter is speaking here about our walk of faith that we have been given exceedingly great and precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature and he reminds the people give all diligence verse five and besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtual knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity that's love for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he the lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall not fail for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth Peter saying though you know these things that you're establishing the present truth that perhaps you know the quotes just as well as I do you read your Bible and the Spirit comes upon you when you read your Bible and quickens that word to you even though you know I'm still gonna put you in remembrance of these things to always keep them before you we should never we come to hear someone preach I've set and I've heard preachers begin to preach and of course I know what they're preaching I already know it I already understand it but I don't sit there and say well I know this I know that I'm not one of those that meets the preacher in the back and tells him what he left out and what he should have said but I I sit there and say god there's something else that you're gonna show me today from this I'm gonna see something else I'm gonna be encouraged you know there are times when I get discouraged I get down as a person and my wife encourages me and you know what she encourages me with the word that well you know the word yes I do there's times I need to be putting remembrance of it there's times you need to be putting remembrance of it when you're going through something and needed leverage you need to be put in remembrance that he is a deliverer sometimes you need to be putting remembrance of the arrow of deliverance not just striking three times but strike that bang until you free Alleluia even though we know it's good to be putting remember say I've heard the message of the rapture it's still good to preach about the rapture hallelujah it's encouraging look we we have enough voices out in the world that we that we have to hear and there's always a voice of our enemy sometimes speaking over our shoulder trying to discourage us one time I was on a Sunday morning someone came in and came to me and where I was studying and said about remember their brother who hadn't been coming to church and it just struck me and so I made a phone call to that particular individual that Sunday morning and I said you've been listening to the devil all this time that's why you're out of church it's about time now you recognize this is the voice of God telling you to get up get ready and go to church [Applause] he got up got ready in Cambridge Church I wouldn't say you do that as a practice I just felt led of God to do that when you felt led of God to do something don't matter how strange it might seem do it but no it's the Lord leading you okay second Corinthians chapter 7 no I'm reading a lot of scriptures today haven't you turned a lot in your Bible it's just the type of message I have today second corinthians chapter seven verses 13 through 15 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yeh and exceedingly the more joy we for the joy of Titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all where I have boasted anything to him of you I am not ashamed but as we speak all things to you in truth even so are boasting which I made before Titus is found a truth and his inward affection is more abundantly toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how was fear and trembling he received him paul had bragged to titus about this church that he was sending him to in in corinth he had bragged about it he had bragged about how they would react when Titus preached to them he bragged about the Liberty that Titus would feel in that particular assembly he bragged about the anointing and spirit and power of God that would be there among that assembly and he told he more or less was telling Titus you're gonna have a wonderful time over there preaching to those people they all align and identify with the word as you speak it you know when the word of God comes forth were to want to be sensitive to the spirit the word when it's coming forward even the times when it's been correction we can say ok now that was for me I want to be that sensitive don't you I don't want to be the type that's always saying that's for him that was for her that was for them over there I come under out of this unscathed no but I want to look what is God's saying to me I want to identify with the word I wanted to find myself in what is being preached titus goes to preach there and guess what the church encourages Titus Titus is blessed by the people by their reaction to the word and it stirs his affection toward the people and he says I love to go there and preach you know churches are remembered according to how they received ministry how they respond to the preaching of the word and I'll tell you something not only are they remembered by the ministers that come with those ministers passed on the word a the church up there in Ohio is a good place to go preach you're not having to plow the field all by yourself they got some people that are a menu they've got some people that are there to get into the spirit and you know it isn't always how loud or vocal you are although I enjoy that but as I scan the people as I'm preaching there there are times that something and you might pull my attention directly do you what is it the only thing I can say is you pulling on the Lord you pulling on that word you've come here to say God what did you have for me today there's a brother in our church he's visited here before he's not very vocal and he's not you know real loud or anything but at home when he gets excited he'll and I know he's right there with me so it's it you know it's encouraging when the people help you preach what we call it I went to a church one down one time down in Okeechobee Florida and this church wonderful group of people and I preached and they pulled and I preached and they pulled and I preached Napal and after the service one of the brothers said we took it kind of easy on you tonight we didn't want to scare you [Laughter] first Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 & 3 we get thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father he's talking about about this church in Thessalonica that he remembered their work of faith how that they you would come into the service as the Prophet said many times there is such a Bank of faith here in this place that anything is possible and he's talking about their labor of love and their patience of Hope Paul remembers these things look churches are remembered among the ministry I've preached in places where I got up to preach and after I read the scripture I started praying within myself Oh God helped me make it through this because it was like I was preaching just two pews and not that you ever go around talking bad about anyone but you never meant sometimes you never mentioned those churches at all but you mentioned the ones that are encouraging the ones that are good and easy to preach to the ones who have can join with you their faith with yours to make all things possible in the service all right turns me to Hebrews chapter 10 I want to change gears here a little bit looking at my time and it's running now verse 31 is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions I want us now to take and recall in our life when we first got saved when God first opened our eyes to this truth how we felt how charged we were how that we couldn't wait to share it with someone else and the times when we shared it and it was just stopped abruptly that didn't discourage us we found someone else to share it with we were not ashamed of of it we wanted to tell people about what God had did in our lives the Bible in Revelations talks about them to people leaving their first love you know I've seen couples and as they got older more years of marriage that they became common to one another then I've seen couples that the more of the longer they were married the more in love they became and that you know I'm thankful that eyes of love looked beyond our fault our fleshly human father any man and I think then about our walk with the Lord how that how often do we tell him I love you Lord is it just a church how often do we thank him how often do we do it and what do we still feel what we felt that first time when he came into our hardest that joy kind of lujah sometimes the people first come to Christ well too much church know they can't get enough they can't wait from one service to the next to get back would beware of that cooling off the time when the doors open and you're not there because this or that the other came up what should be first in our life its Christ amen I understand that there are are times legitimately but you can't make it but you know within your own heart whether it is or not so you know what I'm talking about the mess of what house will you build me says I know that each of one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the Spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it some experiences I just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first Saved that was so glorious to my heart and we can come into a place we can set and we can see it among us that we are drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brethren they talked to me and I talked to them and always in a little way of watching filling out their with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I begin to feel it's all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too real thing to us we must worship in the spirit where this where the Spirit of God is not only our message should be the flame of the hour but it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself remember the tenderness is sweetness we had in God you know he hasn't changed he's still the same as he was the day you got say but sometimes we go through defeat we go through battles where we feel like we failed we've defeated burn me the First Samuel can you give me a little more time I usually preach real short so you can bear with me this morning I'll take up some of the time I left off before First Samuel Chapter seven in verse 11 through 13 and the men of Israel went out of miss book and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they came under Beth car then Samson took a stone and set it between mesma and shin and called the name of it evany sir the named Ebenezer means a stone of help saying here two hath the Lord helped us so the Philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coasts of Israel and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistine all the days of Samuel now the people of Israel before the days of Samuel had suffered some great defeats at the hands of the Philistine and they had had about twenty years prior to Samuel they had had a great battle in this same exact place and they had lost the Ark of the Covenant to the Philistine and so when they came to this place what would be in their members would be of a defeat but God gave them something to remind them of victory in the same location Lord I've lost battles here before but now in this time of victory I'm putting down a stone I'm putting down and ebenezer to remind me of victory I want to remember the victory and Samuel put the stone of ebenezer there to remind the people of victory that God was still able to bring victory to them that it wouldn't just be residing in their minds times of defeat friends look you need to celebrate your victories celebrate them with praise celebrate them with spreading the news of your victories amen and not something to just recall from years back but something maybe you can recall from this morning David said restore unto me the joy of my salvation getting lost in salvation he just lost the joy of it he just wanted the joy of it to be restored restarted me the joy of when I first got saved Amen restore that exuberance I had Amen that excitement I had restore that feeling that you felt so close to Christ but you felt so thankful that you were right there realized that he what he had delivered you from this life of sin that you can look now in your life and see that he is forgiven you he's still the same cop the God that culture years ago he's still the same God to you today and he's had mercy on you many of these call back why because he belong to him he's not gonna let you go [Applause] it says here than what here in style Elijah now with every head bowed and all eyes closed this is lady the church members would you raise your hand and say god remember me put me in the cleft speak to me and it's still small voice I want to hear a still small voice that will anoint me and will send me to my post of duty a different person just as true as I'm standing here god I believe that you're calling your church into a cave now to speak to them and Lord it doesn't altogether have to be a made cave like the Prophet hid in but it could be a little cave in our memory it could be a cave in our soul where we can move back stop and take inventory and look around and then listen to see what we hear and then take us from here this morning this woman lured to the cave and made this convention not altogether breaking - a great shot in Jubilee but made it break also into an experience into us of repenting into a revival and spirit and men's hearts that revives them and brings them back to God again and to that sweet humble experience like the night that we were saved Lord brother Brian just bow our head Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you for your word today Lord for bringing to our remembrance these things Lord reminding us of the character in which this message had been delivered to us and then Lord for bringing to our remembrance Lord Jesus the experience that we had with you Lord I asked God may Lord that your presence now as it's been with us in the singing as it's been with us in the preaching may it now Lord God just bathed over the people Lord let us renew our spirits within you Lord let us renew our joy their God in the Lord this morning we ask it in Jesus name you brought me

even if sometimes maybe we let things get a little common Lord you've still been right there lower their voice be with us father our desires to be dedicated Lord to you Lord do not let this message this gospel become common to us Lord not letting coming to the house of God and worshiping you hook them common-law but every time coming with an expectation in our heart and a hunger and a thirst
