[36:40] amen amen what a beautiful song Amen man
[36:43] a beautiful reality that man that in the
[36:47] midst of the storm in the midst of
[36:49] everything that's where that's where our
[36:51] real Joy comes from that we know and
[36:54] whom we have
[36:55] believed amen that's why we can worship
[36:57] in the midst of the storm we can worship
[37:00] when everything else is going around you
[37:04] know like John when he looked in as we
[37:06] looked at that on Sunday John heard the
[37:09] 24 Elders worshiping but that's not what
[37:13] moved him he heard the angels worshiping
[37:16] but that's not what moved him but when
[37:18] John looked and he said there's
[37:23] John amen John's worship was personal
[37:28] amen it just Blended right in together
[37:30] amen and I'm so thankful God's a
[37:33] personal God aren't you amen we've got a
[37:36] real a real joy in our hearts amen a
[37:39] real worship and I I tell you this that
[37:41] that song the words and how that I thank
[37:44] you for singing that Paul I didn't ask
[37:46] him to do that but I think it fits so
[37:49] perfectly with what we're going to speak
[37:50] on here
[37:52] tonight because there's no greater
[37:55] reality than to know that God is in
[37:58] control of Our Lives you
[38:01] know when you look at what faith is and
[38:05] brother Bram will take that in the
[38:06] message perfect faith and bring that out
[38:09] for us and Faith itself is not knowing
[38:12] how faith is just knowing God's in
[38:16] control God will work it out I don't
[38:19] know how brother BR said another place
[38:21] of the message he said that's God's
[38:23] business not
[38:25] mine and I I'm grateful for that that I
[38:28] don't have to worry about that it's just
[38:29] a rest that comes to I don't know how
[38:31] all of it's going to work out but I just
[38:33] know that God's got it all in
[38:36] control amen and that's that that's
[38:38] where it's settled at and that's where I
[38:39] rest amen that's not mind over matter
[38:43] that's receiving his word that has life
[38:45] in it and that's what's influencing Our
[38:47] Lives amen don't you love him tonight
[38:51] amen so good to be in the house of the
[38:52] Lord and good to have friend here

[39:06] Tabernacle but it still doesn't matter
[39:08] we ministered together and uh pulled our
[39:12] our weight within that and uh to me they
[39:15] that's a that's a
[39:16] challenge that's a challenge I'd

[39:21] boots but uh we're just so thankful the
[39:24] Lord I'm glad our our fellowship that
[39:26] we've that we've have and if you don't

[40:59] just go to the Lord I don't want I'm
[41:00] sorry for keeping you standing let's
[41:03] just go to him in a word of prayer and
[41:04] then we'll get right into the
[41:06] word Heavenly Father Lord how thankful
[41:10] we are Lord for the great promise and
[41:13] reality Lord Lord where there's a
[41:16] testimony that Lord that comes from the
[41:19] depths of our being our soul that it is
[41:22] well Lord father when everything else
[41:26] that can be all sorts of situations all
[41:29] around us and you told us Lord in this
[41:32] hour we're living in that would be the
[41:34] background for the Rapture Lord we're
[41:36] surrounded Lord where trouble Lord and
[41:40] and turmoil Lord on every side but oh
[41:43] God I'm so thankful Lord that there is a
[41:46] rest in the heart of the believer Lord
[41:49] we're in a place of rest it's a it's a
[41:52] paradox Lord how that in the midst of
[41:55] this time
[41:57] God we didn't put ourselves here we were
[42:01] drawn here by you Lord there was a seed
[42:04] you placed within us Lord and you've
[42:07] drawn us you've led us we wouldn't even
[42:09] know how to find you Lord but it's you
[42:12] that found us Lord how that Lord through
[42:16] every aspect of life you begin to deal
[42:19] with us and draw Upon Our Hearts and
[42:21] Lord just given us the grace to yield
[42:25] now Lord where we can stand as the psalm
[42:28] Lord would say now is my head lifted up
[42:31] above my enemy oh God how thankful we
[42:35] are Lord that it's you that's lifted us
[42:37] lord it's you that's placed us on a rock
[42:40] Lord what a firm
[42:43] foundation we just love you Lord we
[42:45] thank you Father may you I just ask that
[42:48] you would just come Lord here tonight
[42:50] you're here Lord we sense your presence
[42:53] and we just ask that Lord that you'll
[42:55] just take control of speaker and hearer
[42:57] together Lord that there would be
[42:59] something that would be said tonight
[43:02] that God our lives would be edified in
[43:05] you Lord to be strengthened and to be
[43:08] encouraged Lord may you just have your
[43:10] way we pray Lord May that same
[43:13] inspiration just fall upon us tonight
[43:16] Lord we pray we ask it Lord in the name
[43:19] of Jesus Christ amen and
[43:22] amen amen let's go to job 23 God bless
[43:26] you amen musicians as
[43:30] you amen thank you
[43:34] for and the playing
[43:41] and and no familiar place and you really
[43:44] think when are we going to move out of
[43:46] this section of the the chapter but uh
[43:49] we we're getting
[43:51] there I was actually studying a little
[43:53] bit ahead here today and I've been going
[43:56] ahead but uh just a few more places here
[43:59] to look at this and um I want to just
[44:02] read here in verse in verse 8 this is a
[44:06] chapter brother Brandon will refer to
[44:07] very many very much in the message I've
[44:09] heard but now I see many times where
[44:11] he's referring and phrasing of these
[44:13] things uh of where job is at in verse
[44:16] eight it says behold I go forward but he
[44:19] is not there and backward but I cannot
[44:23] perceive him and on the left hand where
[44:26] he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He
[44:31] hideth himself on the right hand that I
[44:34] cannot see him remember we're speaking
[44:38] on in the hand in his hands and job is
[44:41] bringing this out we know it's
[44:43] figurative and we recognize that the
[44:45] left hand where he doth work God will do
[44:49] nothing without first revealing it to
[44:52] his servants the
[44:53] prophets so job is aware as a as as a
[44:57] prophet God has spoke to him by
[45:00] inspiration and vision and job is saying
[45:02] I know he's working but I don't know
[45:05] what he's doing right now but then he
[45:08] goes on to say he hideth himself on the
[45:10] right hand that's that's the power of
[45:12] God that's the manifestation of God and
[45:15] as Believers I tell you for me I love to
[45:18] see God move I love to hear from him I
[45:21] love to feel his presence you know
[45:25] classify me however you want to but I I
[45:27] love to feel the presence of God we
[45:29] don't always go by feelings but I tell
[45:31] you I I love as I love to see him and I
[45:33] love to hear him I love to hear the
[45:35] testimonies love to see God move love to
[45:38] see that but notice he hideth himself on
[45:40] the right hand that I cannot see him but
[45:43] he knoweth the way that I take and when
[45:46] he hath tried me I shall come forth as
[45:51] gold notice where job's standing he's
[45:53] certain of of the ground that he's
[45:55] standing on right now my foot hath held
[46:00] his steps his way have I kept and not
[46:04] declined neither have I gone back from
[46:07] the Commandment of his lips so I want
[46:11] you notice job's just not one who's
[46:14] reading the Bible you know here it is in
[46:16] the Stars he's not just reading the
[46:18] Bible but job is used to hearing from
[46:22] God and what God is speaking to him job
[46:25] said I've have not gone back from the
[46:28] Commandment of his lips I have esteemed
[46:31] I love that word I have esteem the words
[46:34] of his mouth more than my necessary food
[46:40] I love that job saying I just didn't do
[46:42] them I've esteemed them there's a value
[46:46] to the words that he's speaking to my
[46:48] life hallelujah amen may God bless you
[46:51] bless the reading of the word as you're
[46:52] being
[46:54] seated I want to just say that job as we
[46:57] look at this here he was a type of every
[47:01] believer that values the word of God
[47:04] above every idea above every reason
[47:08] above every thought and we know that
[47:10] even in our lives how God works and
[47:12] Deals and moves within our lives it's uh
[47:16] the word of God is continually moving
[47:18] and there's a there's a cleansing
[47:20] there's a cleaning that's taking place
[47:22] we're being changed from Glory unto
[47:25] Glory
[47:26] and that's something that we're thankful
[47:28] for job had a love for God that it was a
[47:31] love that that job did not give himself
[47:34] no more than you or I have given
[47:35] ourselves the love that God has placed
[47:37] in our heart but the Bible says we love
[47:40] him because he first loved us so it's a
[47:43] love that is reciprocated it's a love
[47:45] that he's projected and we have we have
[47:49] received it and it has changed our lives
[47:51] to where now the reflection comes back
[47:53] to him that we are a trophy
[47:56] of where the love of God has taken
[47:58] effect Upon Our Lives job had an anchor
[48:01] in his life this is definite within
[48:04] everything that has taken place job has
[48:07] an anchor now the think job is a type of
[48:10] the believer not having even the access
[48:14] or the privilege that you and I would
[48:16] have as a Believer to actually have the
[48:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of
[48:22] the Living God upon our soul but job was
[48:25] a type of a of of an individual that it
[48:29] will reflect that just as job by the
[48:33] portion that God allowed it in that time
[48:35] job lived by the word of God job lived
[48:39] he esteemed to live by the word above
[48:42] everything else and here's the thing
[48:45] that we can think of this that within it
[48:48] brother Brian I don't know something
[48:49] just kicked here I don't know what it
[48:51] was but job in all of it he knew he was
[48:54] right in the message message I have I
[48:56] have heard but now I see if you go to
[48:59] that quote there job knew that he was
[49:02] right and here brother BR says when he
[49:05] found out here in the scriptures these
[49:07] fellows come to him his church members
[49:10] everything that once seemed dear to him
[49:13] had turned against him and tried to
[49:16] accuse him of being a secret sinner
[49:18] because all these things had happened to
[49:20] him you hear people yet today say I told
[49:23] you look at him you see that ain't
[49:26] alltogether the truth sometimes it's God
[49:28] testing his people and in this case it
[49:31] was God testing job the best man there
[49:34] was on Earth at that
[49:36] time wow what a compliment you're the
[49:40] best man the best man on Earth God's
[49:43] going to test the best man on
[49:45] Earth amen it's fitted to be tested
[49:49] because what would show was what quality
[49:53] that job was of job was a part of God
[49:57] and here here the best man there was on
[50:00] Earth at the time now I want you to
[50:01] watch this statement now he was holding
[50:05] him then job wasn't holding himself God
[50:09] was holding him because that he knew Job
[50:12] was a prophet that had a vision from God
[50:15] and that he had exactly done what God
[50:17] had told him to do and God was Duty
[50:20] bound to keep his promise to him and I
[50:24] going say it for us as a Believer for me
[50:27] as a Believer for you as a Believer he's
[50:29] our everything yes he is he's everything
[50:33] to
[50:34] me uh that's not just a cliche he's
[50:37] everything it's what he's he's all that
[50:39] I evaluate everything in my life with
[50:43] decisions that I make I you see
[50:46] decisions that you come to a place in
[50:49] really with serving God that it's no
[50:51] longer about is this right or is this
[50:54] wrong it now com comes down to a
[50:56] personal place of where what is it that
[50:59] will please God for the purpose that
[51:02] he's called me
[51:04] for so it has nothing about what's
[51:07] lawful what's not has everything to do
[51:08] with Lord I just want to please you and
[51:12] you know what I don't feel the least
[51:14] little bit restricted amen I don't feel
[51:17] the least little bit robbed or
[51:23] deprived can I get a witness on that
[51:25] tonight I don't feel I don't feel that
[51:27] if there's anything at all I've missed a
[51:29] lot of
[51:31] Heartache I've missed a lot of other
[51:33] everything
[51:34] else but notice like job when job
[51:38] esteemed God's word above everything
[51:41] else not just that job did it you know
[51:45] you can do the word of God but yet not
[51:47] esteem it when you esteem it you value
[51:52] it and job this was something he valued
[51:55] the word of God this was before the
[51:57] trial ever came God's desire was his
[52:00] delight and like job it means everything
[52:03] to us to see him to hear him and even
[52:07] feel his
[52:09] presence I think of it like this if a
[52:12] person could say well you know we don't
[52:14] need to see Miracles anymore that first
[52:16] of all that's contrary to the
[52:18] scripture the Bible say signs and
[52:21] wonders will follow them that
[52:23] believe and if you are born again of the
[52:26] spirit of God you're a walking living
[52:29] breathing
[52:30] Miracle it's the greatest
[52:33] miracle and I'll tell you another great
[52:35] miracle that you're sitting here tonight
[52:37] in your right
[52:39] mind but tell you another great miracle
[52:42] that even if you're not where you need
[52:43] to be with God but you have something in
[52:45] you that presses you to be here you're a
[52:50] miracle cuz I'll tell you Satan wouldn't
[52:52] be encouraging you to be here it's God
[52:56] at
[52:59] work it means everything to us that's
[53:01] why brother BR could say it like this I
[53:03] believe in the Third Exodus he said Lord
[53:05] he said every once in a while towards
[53:06] the end of the message he said just come
[53:08] Among Us and do something so we know
[53:10] you're with
[53:13] us he's our life and when we haven't
[53:16] seen or heard from him especially when
[53:18] things are are taking place things that
[53:21] we're going through in our life things
[53:23] we've experienced and perhaps we've
[53:26] prayed we've waited for just a word from
[53:31] him we waited maybe put on this tape and
[53:34] you know it's but yet there's been a
[53:37] blessing that's come by our way but yet
[53:39] maybe a direct word about that hasn't
[53:41] dropped maybe here we're coming to the
[53:43] house of God and we're maybe expecting a
[53:45] direct word and not a direct word comes
[53:48] or or we're waiting to see this
[53:49] situation moving we don't see it moving
[53:52] but let me tell you we can take
[53:53] consolation that when we're listening to
[53:55] the message we're in prayer and we're
[53:58] looking even as we sat here in the house
[54:00] of God and his presence moves around us
[54:04] his presence is to encourage you and I
[54:07] because his presence is not confined to
[54:10] this building amen he said I'll never
[54:14] leave you nor forsake
[54:18] you you have a confidence that you can
[54:21] say the Lord is my helper amen
[54:26] amen the angel of the Lord encampeth
[54:29] round about them that fear Him and
[54:33] deliver them amen that has that in
[54:37] itself has nothing to do with feeling
[54:39] that's his
[54:41] word God is the god of his word and to
[54:45] think of it when God has given you an
[54:47] act the Holy Spirit when you think of it
[54:51] who is it that made the promise that you
[54:53] and I are partakers of tonight T God
[54:56] made the promise God's the one who made
[54:58] a way why are we living here for why are
[55:02] we the Church of the Living God I don't
[55:03] have this quote up there but just listen
[55:05] to this why are we filled with the Holy
[55:08] Ghost to remember in the time of trouble
[55:12] he is still
[55:14] here amen Wonder that's why we're filled
[55:17] with the Holy Ghost to remember in the
[55:20] time of trouble he is still here amen he
[55:25] stabilizes things he is the same
[55:28] yesterday today and forever he is with
[55:30] us just the same he might be resting a
[55:33] few minutes between meetings but he's
[55:35] still just the
[55:37] same so to stabilize it it's where
[55:41] something is
[55:43] made uh in a way so that it's unlikely
[55:46] to give way or
[55:48] overturn you know those big cruise ships
[55:50] that they have out there and we spoke on
[55:53] that some time ago that those cruise
[55:54] ship they have within them there's a uh
[55:57] a
[55:58] stabilization whole mechanism in there
[56:01] that it'll actually shift things in
[56:02] there to keep that cruise ship balanced
[56:05] even in the midst of the roughest of
[56:06] waters it has things already built into
[56:09] it and let me say this the stabilizers
[56:12] have been put on the ship the prophet
[56:15] made that declaration in this hour the
[56:18] stabilizers have been put on the
[56:21] ship you see we're not under the ideas
[56:24] or the thoughts or the reasonings of a
[56:26] man that's not what this message is this
[56:28] message is the thoughts of God declared
[56:30] to you and I and confirmed and
[56:32] Vindicated by the spirit and you're
[56:35] witnessing the word working in your life
[56:37] and a man's word won't do
[56:41] that amen a man's word will make you act
[56:44] like a man but God's word makes you act
[56:46] like
[56:47] God it brings Sons and Daughters of God
[56:50] so there's a stabilizer that when
[56:52] pressure comes situations come there is
[56:54] is an internal pressurization
[56:58] system that you're equipped with
[57:01] Hallelujah can I say it like this this
[57:04] equipment was in you the whole
[57:06] time but when the quickening power come
[57:10] it activates the
[57:12] [Music]
[57:14] equipment Hallelujah this is why I want
[57:17] you to think of this where we're
[57:19] standing at we are standing upon the
[57:22] word of
[57:23] God Jesus said heavens and earth shall
[57:26] pass away but my words shall not pass
[57:30] away

[57:35] 16:17 it's is it and it is easier for
[57:39] heaven and earth to pass than one tit of
[57:42] the law to fail that tit means even an
[57:45] accent
[57:47] mark even one little part God does not
[57:51] have to edit cut out or or in his word
[57:55] that it's easier for heaven and earth to
[57:58] pass away than for one p Hallelujah

[58:51] right Hallelujah on and on through the
[58:53] scriptures when you take that phrase of
[58:56] the Lord is my strength David in the
[58:58] opening of Psalms 27 the Lord's the
[59:00] strength of my life when they cross the
[59:02] Red Sea the very first words that come
[59:05] out of Moses uh mouth in the song is the
[59:08] Lord is become my strength hallu amen
[59:14] hallelujah our strength alone Isaiah
[59:16] said even young people their strength
[59:19] alone their stamina is great but that
[59:21] strength will not
[59:23] endure right
[59:25] but there is a strength that endures
[59:28] when our strength fails am that's when
[59:31] God's strength just steps forward and
[59:33] lets us know I've been here the whole
[59:35] time I'm not leaving I'm not turning
[59:38] back I'm the one that's holding you the
[59:39] whole time just this test or trial makes
[59:42] you aware of that it's me it hasn't been
[59:45] you it's been me the whole time now you

[1:00:04] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:00:07] the manifested word and the expressed
[1:00:10] image of his person and upholding All

[1:00:33] Brock every roadblock to try to hinder
[1:00:36] you he'll try to put everything he can
[1:00:39] over top of a seat of God but let me
[1:00:41] just remind that devil just like you can
[1:00:44] put a seed and that seed is there in the
[1:00:46] ground you put concrete over it it'll

[1:00:54] don't care what the enemy has put around
[1:00:57] or over your life there's nothing
[1:00:59] greater than the seed which is the word
[1:01:01] which is of God in your life nothing can

[1:01:17] doubt to
[1:01:20] Faith let me read this out Amplified cuz
[1:01:23] I want to take these words and verse
[1:01:25] three of Hebrews 1 he is the sole
[1:01:28] expression of the glory of God the light
[1:01:31] being the out ring or Radiance of the
[1:01:34] Divine and he is the perfect imprint and
[1:01:37] very image of God's nature upholding
[1:01:40] this where I want to draw from upholding
[1:01:43] and maintaining and guiding and
[1:01:45] propelling the universe by his mighty
[1:01:50] word of
[1:01:52] power that's just awesome awesome Amen
[1:01:56] he's upholding me he's maintaining me
[1:02:00] he's guiding me and he's propelling
[1:02:05] me hallelujah hallelujah I want you to
[1:02:09] think of this it's God who is who is
[1:02:12] keeping you and I in the message for him
[1:02:15] will I accept brother Bram said now
[1:02:16] you've got a way that you say ups and
[1:02:19] downs and ups and downs he said I would
[1:02:21] advise you to go to God and stay there
[1:02:23] until you really born again when trials
[1:02:26] and troubles and heartaches and
[1:02:29] disappointments set in something holds
[1:02:34] not you holding something holding
[1:02:39] you Hallelujah I don't find that
[1:02:42] discouraging I find that
[1:02:44] encouraging that if I was a person Sting
[1:02:47] with ups and downs I find encouragement
[1:02:50] hey there's a deeper walk with God than
[1:02:52] I found amen and God's calling me to a
[1:02:56] deeper walk he's letting me know there's
[1:02:58] a deeper
[1:03:00] walk Hallelujah something holds not you
[1:03:04] holding something holding you it isn't a
[1:03:06] question whether I hold on or not it's a
[1:03:09] question whether he held on or not it
[1:03:12] isn't looking at me it's looking at him
[1:03:15] he's the
[1:03:16] one brother Bram goes on to say in the
[1:03:18] message love he says to think that
[1:03:20] perfect love cast out all fear you're
[1:03:23] not scared about nothing you're just
[1:03:25] resting you're not oh I may backslide
[1:03:28] tomorrow I may backslide next week I
[1:03:30] won't worry about that I'm not trying to
[1:03:32] hold on he held on for me and he put a
[1:03:36] love in my heart that holds
[1:03:40] there it's him holding me not me holding
[1:03:45] him remember brother Brandon was asked
[1:03:47] by I think Mr eer pulled up next to him
[1:03:50] he's walking away from the graveyard
[1:03:52] Billy said he said how he said how you
[1:03:54] holding your religion now he said I'm
[1:03:56] not he said he's holding me he said if
[1:03:59] it was up to me he said i' turned loose
[1:04:00] a long time ago because why our
[1:04:05] strength can give out but there's a
[1:04:08] strength on the inside that shows
[1:04:11] there's something deeper than just the
[1:04:14] DNA of our natural family tree it's the
[1:04:18] strength of almighty God what's he doing
[1:04:21] upholding you maintaining you he is
[1:04:24] guiding you and he is propelling
[1:04:29] you Hallelujah in his
[1:04:33] hands glory be to God if it was if it
[1:04:35] was me holding him I'd probably turn
[1:04:37] loose but as long as he's holding me
[1:04:39] he'll never turn loose he promised he
[1:04:42] would now let's look at this in Psalm
[1:04:44] 63:7 let's just look at this just for a
[1:04:47] moment because thou Hast been my help
[1:04:50] therefore in the shadow of thy Wings
[1:04:52] will I rejoice
[1:04:54] right you know it'd be like somebody
[1:04:57] want that don't worry I ain't going to
[1:04:58] be real long it it'd be just like
[1:05:00] somebody you know running and say oh you
[1:05:02] running over to Mama now Mama's Boy I
[1:05:05] don't care what you call
[1:05:07] me in the shadow of his wings I'm going
[1:05:10] to Rejoice you know why I'm safe ever
[1:05:15] moreall amen I'm safe in the shadow of
[1:05:18] his wings my soul followeth hard after
[1:05:22] thee thy right hand upholdeth me it
[1:05:26] upholds me now notice the right hand is
[1:05:28] upholding me on the left hand he work
[1:05:31] but it's his right hand that's upholding
[1:05:34] me that word uphold means to grasp to
[1:05:37] hold the support attain to lay hold of
[1:05:40] hold fast in Isaiah 41:10 he said fear
[1:05:44] thou not for I'm with thee be not
[1:05:47] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[1:05:50] strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay
[1:05:54] I will uphold thee with the right hand
[1:05:57] of my righteousness so how does God
[1:06:00] uphold Us by his
[1:06:02] word is that right by his spirit because
[1:06:06] remember his his spirit is his word made
[1:06:10] manifest true you see to to the believer
[1:06:14] in this hour the spirit of God is Not
[1:06:18] Just An anointing or an emotion the
[1:06:21] spirit of God is the person of Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ amen it's the word that's here
[1:06:28] anointing us a living God the spirit of
[1:06:31] Truth himself that leads us that guides
[1:06:34] us that directs us notice I'll
[1:06:37] strengthen thee I'm so grateful for that
[1:06:40] Psalms
[1:06:41] 119 uh 116 or verse 116 uphold me
[1:06:47] according unto Thy word that I may live
[1:06:51] and let me not be ashamed of My Hope
[1:06:55] that's my prayer God uphold me according
[1:06:57] unto Thy
[1:06:59] word you know there's a lot of things
[1:07:02] God can do and he does even outside of
[1:07:05] his word but if he just keep what's
[1:07:06] inside of here I'm fine amen uphold me
[1:07:12] according to Thy word that's where I'm
[1:07:14] resting is on those promises hold thou
[1:07:17] notice hold thou me up and I shall be
[1:07:19] safe and I will have respect unto thy
[1:07:23] statutes continually in other words if
[1:07:25] you don't hold me Lord I'm not able to
[1:07:28] see your word as I ought to see
[1:07:31] it that I can perceive it so god holds
[1:07:35] us according to his word see this is why
[1:07:38] the word itself coming into us by the
[1:07:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost the quickening
[1:07:44] power what it does is it raises up that
[1:07:47] seed on the inside which is a part of
[1:07:49] God and then it becomes the word made
[1:07:52] manifest then you do not think it
[1:07:55] robbery to be equal with God because
[1:07:58] you're seeing that same word that same
[1:08:01] God it's moving in your life there's a
[1:08:04] sadl within it that you know there's a
[1:08:07] truth there's a word that's operating in
[1:08:09] my life and it's holding you it's not
[1:08:13] just something that you're saying and
[1:08:15] saying well you know praise God I you
[1:08:17] know haven't fully backslid all the way
[1:08:19] no there's a deeper walk than that well
[1:08:23] praise God I didn't go back on the Dance
[1:08:25] Floor well I'm glad you didn't but
[1:08:27] there's a deeper walk than
[1:08:29] that that's what the word is calling us
[1:08:32] to uphold me according unto Thy word
[1:08:35] amen hallelujah not just to be something
[1:08:38] that's maintained here well praise God
[1:08:40] I'm not back out smoking and this I'm
[1:08:42] not back out drinking hey we that that
[1:08:44] ought to be something that's so far out
[1:08:46] of sight how is it out of sight because
[1:08:49] in here there's come an anointing by the
[1:08:53] I SA of the Holy Ghost a real faith that
[1:08:57] looks beyond the circumstances and
[1:08:59] there's no tie or hold to the world any
[1:09:03] longer go back to go back to
[1:09:06] what uphold me according to Thy word
[1:09:10] hallelujah oh Hallelujah God has not
[1:09:14] called us to be lukewarm
[1:09:18] Believers but he's called us to be
[1:09:20] full-fledged Believers that are on fire
[1:09:23] amen that's why God could said make up
[1:09:25] your mind I would rather you're hot or
[1:09:27] you're
[1:09:29] cold cuz God said the in between I
[1:09:32] cannot take it right always tease the
[1:09:35] African Brothers cuz they don't like ice
[1:09:37] in their water they like it warming so I
[1:09:39] always give him a bottle of water I said
[1:09:41] I would that thou were hot or
[1:09:44] cold so I always tease them about that
[1:09:47] but you know it's true either be hot or
[1:09:50] cold I want to be hot don't you yeah
[1:09:54] notice this word aoli without reading
[1:09:57] all the Scripture it refers to the word
[1:10:00] in verse 8 of 2 Chronicles 32 of how
[1:10:04] that the people rested upon the words of
[1:10:08] Hezekiah king of Judah so the word
[1:10:11] rested in 2 Chronicles 328 is the same
[1:10:15] word upholdeth so it's where we're
[1:10:18] resting not when we're in trauma but

[1:10:39] apart but God anointed
[1:10:43] Hezekiah I tell you it took Insight
[1:10:46] because to recognize that this is not
[1:10:48] Hezekiah as a
[1:10:50] man it took it took Insight it took
[1:10:53] deception you know what it took it took
[1:10:55] God upholding his people not only did he
[1:10:58] uphold Hezekiah but God was upholding
[1:11:00] his people that they could see this is
[1:11:02] not Hezekiah this is the word of the
[1:11:05] Lord amen and they rested themselves
[1:11:08] upon the words of Hezekiah Isaiah
[1:11:11] 26:3 here it comes again thou wil keep
[1:11:15] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:11:19] stayed on thee do we got those

[1:15:23] amen it's the same pattern all the way
[1:15:26] down the difficult and the most
[1:15:28] challenging part is getting us to
[1:15:36] yield the challenge but I'm
[1:15:39] grateful God rolls his sleeve up he's up
[1:15:43] for the
[1:15:47] challenge oh my so this plan or purpose
[1:15:50] it's not viable to overthrow see God is
[1:15:53] moving God is working the promise that
[1:15:55] he's given us is that when the enemy
[1:15:58] would come in like a flood that the
[1:16:00] spirit of the Lord will raise a
[1:16:03] standard against the
[1:16:06] enemy what's God doing he's upholding
[1:16:09] he's maintaining he's guiding and he's
[1:16:12] propelling all the way down through the
[1:16:14] ages under that of the lion anointing
[1:16:17] they could only respond to the anointing
[1:16:20] they were under right when it came to
[1:16:23] the ox Anointed The Man same thing with
[1:16:25] the eagle you can you and I can do
[1:16:27] nothing but respond to the anointing
[1:16:30] that we're
[1:16:31] under oh God I I I I I want that of that
[1:16:35] eagle anointed to swow like brother John
[1:16:38] Sanger when he read that quote on Eagle
[1:16:39] St This n That quote is just so
[1:16:42] resonated in my heart God let me have
[1:16:44] Eagle
[1:16:45] thoughts I just want Eagle thoughts the
[1:16:47] things that just you know because
[1:16:49] Satan's always trying to get us to light
[1:16:51] down here upon this this earth right
[1:16:54] through every little tactic or thing
[1:16:56] that he can do to try to bring us down
[1:16:58] into this realm right yeah that's true
[1:17:02] we got to live here it's true we got to
[1:17:04] walk here it's true we got to face the
[1:17:06] things of life but we don't have to be
[1:17:10] controlled by the
[1:17:13] senses of this
[1:17:15] life we were
[1:17:17] made to control those
[1:17:20] things as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:17:23] I want you to think of this let me just
[1:17:26] kind of turn I going to turn here just
[1:17:27] for a few moments in Psalms
[1:17:31] 145:4 the Lord upholdeth
[1:17:35] all that
[1:17:38] fall that almost
[1:17:42] seems kind of contradictory but it's
[1:17:47] not God's word can't be
[1:17:52] overthrown Samson himself was overthrown
[1:17:54] but the word was not
[1:17:59] overthrown the word cannot be
[1:18:02] defeated Samuel what are you saying I'm
[1:18:05] saying just because somebody or you may
[1:18:08] not be where you ought to be God has not
[1:18:10] wrote you off amen hallelujah pise the
[1:18:14] Lord the Lord upholdeth all that fall
[1:18:17] I'm glad you say why are you glad
[1:18:20] because I can remember as a 13-year old
[1:18:22] boy matter of fact a year old boy when I
[1:18:24] was
[1:18:25] baptized did I go all the way at that
[1:18:27] time no then I remember as a 13-year-old
[1:18:30] boy my you know had a real touch from
[1:18:33] God but was it to the depth it needed to
[1:18:35] be no I didn't know that at that moment
[1:18:39] so I didn't I didn't continue I didn't
[1:18:42] continue on the pressures and the things
[1:18:44] of the world and everything else coming
[1:18:46] around but you see even though you say
[1:18:48] oh here Samuel you know just just just
[1:18:51] tottering just falling then here 19
[1:18:54] years old coming home from college the
[1:18:56] first year and in an unexpected time in
[1:18:59] an unexpected
[1:19:00] moment in a basement of all places
[1:19:03] brother Bill in your
[1:19:05] basement wow unexpected moment but God
[1:19:09] takes a hold of my life but Samy did you
[1:19:12] understand all that was taking place no
[1:19:13] I didn't but I knew one thing it come to
[1:19:16] a place God had brought me to a place I
[1:19:19] no longer want to live this life
[1:19:23] I no longer want to be bound with these
[1:19:27] things I no longer want to walk this
[1:19:30] way you say who put that in your heart
[1:19:32] God did you see that seed was there the
[1:19:35] whole time it was there beneath the
[1:19:39] darkness it might have been like well
[1:19:41] fall here fall there but the Lord
[1:19:44] upholds his word his word cannot be over
[1:19:46] Throne that's why I say I don't care
[1:19:48] what you see when you look at your
[1:19:51] children
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:56] hen Hallelujah the prophet says it so
[1:19:59] clearly in the message of how that those
[1:20:02] little boys of of had he writes were
[1:20:06] laughing when he was telling the
[1:20:09] testimony come on somebody we could look
[1:20:12] at that with scripture and say man
[1:20:14] you're laughing against the works of the
[1:20:15] Holy Ghost but God knew what was beneath
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:19] there let me tell you what happened in
[1:20:22] that love humble little home the same
[1:20:24] almighty God that spoke in the beginning
[1:20:27] and said let there be light was the same
[1:20:31] almighty God that came down in that
[1:20:34] little Shack of haty Rights hall
[1:20:38] hallelujah whatever you ask for that's
[1:20:42] she said I want the salvation of my two
[1:20:46] boys right there they fell across her
[1:20:49] lap weep their way to Calvary and we're
[1:20:53] filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:20:58] hallelujah I tell you when I to me when
[1:21:02] I look at that and I read of that you
[1:21:04] know what that says it is the atmosphere
[1:21:06] of the Holy Ghost that means everything
[1:21:10] and there's nothing that can create an
[1:21:13] atmosphere like the preaching of the
[1:21:16] word of God in
[1:21:19] season it inspires our faith to look
[1:21:22] beyond what we
[1:21:25] see
[1:21:28] Hallelujah let me just tell you
[1:21:29] something the devil never come and get
[1:21:31] on your shoulder and tell you you you're
[1:21:33] just getting excited the no God will
[1:21:35] never tell you that the devil
[1:21:37] will the devil will tell when you know
[1:21:39] you flopped before God never tells you
[1:21:44] that you got to recognize that devil is
[1:21:47] a
[1:21:48] liar Hallelujah just like this stuff you
[1:21:51] see over there I've watched videos of
[1:21:54] different times and look at the stuff of
[1:21:56] this with the Hamas that's what the
[1:21:57] stuff that's going on over there right
[1:22:00] now they're playing with
[1:22:03] them it's all
[1:22:06] propaganda longer they can get something
[1:22:09] drawn
[1:22:10] out here this morning or it was last
[1:22:13] night a few more minutes and the truth
[1:22:15] was getting ready to
[1:22:17] end then all of a sudden oh we're going
[1:22:20] to exchange and I just I just had seen a
[1:22:22] video where there was some Israelis that
[1:22:25] stood there and they said look it cannot
[1:22:28] cease we are not this is what I found
[1:22:30] tremendous it says we're not we are not
[1:22:32] doing this out of Revenge we're doing
[1:22:35] this because to avoid this type of
[1:22:39] atrocity it said it's not the gods and
[1:22:42] people it's
[1:22:44] Hamas and I like I like it they said
[1:22:46] they said in there to me I I I don't
[1:22:48] know this this video and the Resolute
[1:22:51] part of those family members that could
[1:22:54] stand there and say look at all
[1:22:57] cost don't stop fighting come on and as
[1:23:01] they were able to commentate it meaning
[1:23:03] that that our freedom our liberties that
[1:23:07] Tranquility here is valued more than
[1:23:10] just
[1:23:11] lives that to me it resonated deep in my
[1:23:14] heart sir Lord I mean even the
[1:23:17] commentators were blown away by those
[1:23:20] statements why is because what is Val
[1:23:22] you
[1:23:24] more I think that's what's going on
[1:23:27] there you know that over there is a type
[1:23:30] of what's going on right here
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:36] spiritually Satan's got a lot of little
[1:23:38] sneaky tunnels he likes to pop out
[1:23:43] at oh my we could go on that but I I'm
[1:23:45] going to stay here just on I got to
[1:23:47] finish this out here right that's a
[1:23:49] whole another thing but the Lord
[1:23:50] upholdeth all that fall
[1:23:53] and raiseth up all those that be bowed
[1:23:56] down thank you
[1:23:58] Jesus now I want to just just go here
[1:24:02] just for a few moments here in the book
[1:24:04] of Ezra and I'm just going to I want to
[1:24:06] just look at a few scriptures and just
[1:24:08] watching this of the hand of the Lord as
[1:24:10] it's upholding your
[1:24:13] life when Israel come back from Babylon
[1:24:17] remember there was a group that came
[1:24:18] back
[1:24:19] first and when they came back
[1:24:21] adversaries came against them that were
[1:24:23] in the land when they came back from
[1:24:25] Babylon the 70 years of Exile they laid
[1:24:28] the foundation then the people of the
[1:24:30] land it says they came against them with
[1:24:32] accusations to frustrate that word means
[1:24:35] to break the
[1:24:38] purpose and for 15
[1:24:41] years nothing was
[1:24:44] done they just were content with life
[1:24:46] they were building their houses and they
[1:24:48] were what what is the HEI chapter 1 goes
[1:24:51] into it they were just become involved
[1:24:53] with self the vision and the purpose had
[1:24:57] become lost so in other words the
[1:25:00] decisions that Israel was making had
[1:25:03] nothing to do with the purpose that was
[1:25:05] above every other purpose the purpose
[1:25:08] that God called him for wasn't for them
[1:25:10] to build a house the purpose God called
[1:25:13] him for was his house you see the Bible
[1:25:16] says seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:25:18] and then all these other things will be
[1:25:20] added unto you if that if that gets out
[1:25:22] of order you have to scramble and
[1:25:24] scramble and scramble and push and chove
[1:25:27] and you're trying to make things come
[1:25:30] together that will fall in order if
[1:25:33] you're under the right order you
[1:25:35] understand what I'm saying sometimes PE
[1:25:37] sometimes are our lives we can be
[1:25:39] enticed to do this and and do this and
[1:25:41] do that remember there there's blessings
[1:25:44] when we abide in the order there's a
[1:25:46] divine order of
[1:25:48] God and I'll tell you this right here if
[1:25:50] there's something that that even though
[1:25:53] that I might be able to have if God sees
[1:25:56] I'm talking about lawfully God sees
[1:25:58] Samuel that wouldn't be good for you I
[1:26:00] don't want it I don't want it if it's
[1:26:02] going to hinder him working in my life I
[1:26:06] I don't want it because him he he means
[1:26:08] more than anything
[1:26:10] else is that right is that how you feel
[1:26:13] that's what means more than anything
[1:26:14] else that's where everything gets
[1:26:15] evaluated notice I want you to think of
[1:26:17] this the hand of God now just just a
[1:26:19] just a few moments here I've got I've
[1:26:21] got here right in front of me and notice
[1:26:24] remember when the Bible would say Elisha
[1:26:27] was standing
[1:26:28] there and they didn't know what to do in
[1:26:31] that battle they had went out there in
[1:26:32] the desert and no water around them they
[1:26:34] brought a Minstrel and the minstrel
[1:26:35] began to play the Bible then says the
[1:26:38] hand of the Lord Came Upon Elisha and
[1:26:41] then he began to prophesy he began to
[1:26:45] unfold the Victory and the path of
[1:26:48] Victory to
[1:26:49] them Ezekiel we looked at this on some
[1:26:52] time ago Ezekiel the hand of the Lord
[1:26:54] would carry him here it would show him
[1:26:58] things that had taken place were taking
[1:27:01] place and would take place it was the
[1:27:04] hand of the Lord showing him all of this
[1:27:07] now here we come into a moment where
[1:27:10] Israel the temple has been rebuilt and
[1:27:15] now it's time for Ezra to come and Ezra
[1:27:18] comes and I just want just a few
[1:27:19] scriptures that I'm going to read here
[1:27:21] that pertain to the hand of God
[1:27:23] strengthening God's people to fulfill
[1:27:25] the purpose that God has
[1:27:31] allotted in Ezra 79 here's Ezra this is
[1:27:34] the testimony for upon the first day of
[1:27:36] the first month began he to go up from
[1:27:39] Babylon on the first day of the first
[1:27:41] month came he to Jerusalem according to
[1:27:44] the good hand of his God upon him how
[1:27:46] did Ezra know when it was time to go the
[1:27:48] hand of the
[1:27:50] Lord see it's God upholding maintaining
[1:27:53] guiding propelling Hallelujah he knew
[1:27:56] when it was time because the hand of the
[1:27:58] Lord where Ezra had prepared his heart
[1:28:01] to seek the law of the Lord and to do it
[1:28:03] and to teach in Israel statutes and
[1:28:05] judgments in verse 27 of that same
[1:28:07] chapter here he says blessed be the Lord
[1:28:10] God of our fathers which hath put a
[1:28:12] thing as this in the king's heart to
[1:28:14] beautify the house of the Lord which is
[1:28:17] in in Jerusalem and hath extended Mercy
[1:28:21] unto me before the king his counselors
[1:28:24] before all the king's Mighty princes and
[1:28:26] I was strengthened as the hand of the
[1:28:29] Lord my God was upon me and I gathered
[1:28:33] together out of Israel Chief men to go
[1:28:36] up with me so what were the chief men
[1:28:40] responding to the hand of the Lord that
[1:28:44] was strengthening
[1:28:46] Ezra this was their time to go others
[1:28:49] had went before started got the
[1:28:52] Foundation built the walls all of those
[1:28:54] things and finished the temple but now
[1:28:57] hear the hand of God moving in direction
[1:29:00] to give them strength to give them the
[1:29:02] nudge to encourage them onward Ezra
[1:29:05] 8:21 now here they come out here they
[1:29:08] come out Ezra comes out loaded with all
[1:29:10] of these Treasures to go back to
[1:29:14] Jerusalem loaded with treasures now
[1:29:16] remember what's between him and getting
[1:29:19] back to Jerusalem you've got all sorts
[1:29:21] of land
[1:29:22] that's filled with
[1:29:24] Bandits right brother brah will say it
[1:29:26] over and over
[1:29:28] ishmaelites is that right notice but
[1:29:31] here's what Ezra came to he says I
[1:29:33] proclaimed to fast there not knowing
[1:29:35] what to do I proclaimed the fast there
[1:29:37] at the river of ahaba that we might
[1:29:40] afflict ourselves before our God to seek
[1:29:43] him a right way for us and for our
[1:29:44] little ones and for all our substance
[1:29:47] boy what a way to raise a
[1:29:49] family I don't know what to do Lord but
[1:29:52] I know you don't you know how to lead me
[1:29:55] I'm at a place right here that I don't I
[1:29:58] I seem like nothing's coming to me but I
[1:30:00] know you're there to lead me and guide
[1:30:01] me and you can show me the application
[1:30:03] for I was ashamed to require of the king
[1:30:06] a band of soldiers and Horsemen to help
[1:30:08] us against the enemy in the way because
[1:30:11] we had spoken unto the king saying the
[1:30:14] hand of our God is upon all them for
[1:30:17] good that seek him but his power and his
[1:30:19] wrath is against all them that forsake
[1:30:22] Him so we fasted and besought our God
[1:30:24] for this and he was intreated of
[1:30:29] us the testimony we're here because of
[1:30:32] the hand of God God has moved upon the
[1:30:37] king his hand is moved because it's the
[1:30:41] time it's the same thing within your
[1:30:44] life in your
[1:30:46] job the Bible said
[1:30:48] that that that that every man's gift he
[1:30:52] said the gift maketh room for
[1:30:55] itself are you hearing me oh brother
[1:30:58] Samuel Prophet Apostle no the gift it's
[1:31:01] true we can apply it there but the
[1:31:03] prophet tells us the real gift is that
[1:31:05] soul that come from
[1:31:07] God he is Jehovah Gyra God makes a way
[1:31:12] for
[1:31:14] himself it's God who makes a way
[1:31:17] Hallelujah so when opposition comes here
[1:31:20] we are standing in that time and it just
[1:31:22] goes to show God said I'm the one
[1:31:25] holding you the whole time I'm the one
[1:31:27] that's been strengthening you sometimes
[1:31:29] you feel like that my everything's going
[1:31:31] just right and then there's other times
[1:31:33] where you look and say I don't feel like
[1:31:34] I can make another step but it's his
[1:31:36] right hand that's strengthening
[1:31:39] you and all the time his left hand his
[1:31:43] purpose is being worked out in our lives
[1:31:46] not only not only things that we would
[1:31:49] so much see out here but it's so much
[1:31:52] that's being gained in here by God and
[1:31:56] if it's being gained by God then it's
[1:31:58] being yielded by
[1:32:01] us one more scripture
[1:32:05] here here's Nehemiah coming back you
[1:32:08] know a Here Comes Nehemiah it's time to
[1:32:10] build the walls
[1:32:11] up so when Nehemiah comes back and the
[1:32:15] Bible goes on to say in verse 8 of
[1:32:17] Nehemiah 2 if they just go to the end of
[1:32:20] it if that would be all right
[1:32:22] the Bible Well maybe let me say he gave
[1:32:24] me Timber to make beams for the gates of
[1:32:27] the palace which are pertained to the
[1:32:28] house and for the wall of the city and
[1:32:30] for the house that I shall enter
[1:32:33] into in other words when Nehemiah came
[1:32:37] he came with his bag full of what was
[1:32:40] needed let me tell you something this
[1:32:43] message is not
[1:32:45] lacking it listen because you see the
[1:32:49] message it's Christ amen amen there is
[1:32:52] no lacking in Christ what God is
[1:32:56] requiring and you look or even the
[1:32:58] enemies look and say pile of rubbish
[1:33:02] who's going to rebuild these Gates who's
[1:33:04] going to do this let me tell you there
[1:33:05] is sufficient power in this word to
[1:33:08] achieve what God has called to be
[1:33:12] achieved
[1:33:14] Hallelujah and the King granted me
[1:33:17] according to the good hand of my God
[1:33:20] upon me
[1:33:24] let me tell you as we tell that a gift
[1:33:26] maketh room for itself God has you where
[1:33:29] he has you right
[1:33:32] now and be
[1:33:34] content in that of the Lord is my helper
[1:33:38] it's God who's making a way and when God
[1:33:41] sees fit that I no longer am supposed to
[1:33:44] be here then God will move me where he
[1:33:47] needs me to be
[1:33:49] next a might is started in the prison
[1:33:53] then I go to Piper's
[1:33:56] house then I'm back in the prison again
[1:33:59] but all of those places were
[1:34:03] necessary parts of Joseph's
[1:34:07] journey and what I love in the
[1:34:09] scriptures over and over and over is
[1:34:13] repeated in Genesis and acts and the
[1:34:16] Lord was with
[1:34:20] Joseph
[1:34:23] oh my don't you love him then I told
[1:34:26] them the good hand the hand of my God
[1:34:28] was good upon me and the King's word
[1:34:31] that he had spoken to me and they said
[1:34:32] let us rise up and build so they
[1:34:36] strengthen their hands for this good
[1:34:38] work he's upholding
[1:34:41] us even in the midst of the situations
[1:34:44] and no matter what it is what's
[1:34:47] important is is that you know that
[1:34:50] you're anchored right that's what's very
[1:34:52] important in this hour friends it's an
[1:34:54] hour as we we hear it over and over and
[1:34:58] I know even I pray that even as this
[1:35:00] would go out even over the over all that
[1:35:03] attend here that call that call this
[1:35:05] their home assembly and others that
[1:35:08] would hear and be blessed it's an hour
[1:35:11] to know where you're
[1:35:13] standing amen it's an hour to be very
[1:35:18] very
[1:35:20] sure it's an hour to understand that's
[1:35:23] why the word came to make you and I
[1:35:25] aware bring us to a place to where of
[1:35:28] rest that's what the coming of the word
[1:35:31] has done in this hour to bring us to a
[1:35:33] place of rest and that place of rest is
[1:35:37] in
[1:35:38] him he is our Promised Land he is our
[1:35:42] place of rest is that right it brings us
[1:35:46] to that place to where we're no longer
[1:35:49] up and down and in and out but there's a
[1:35:51] rest in him and like job let me just say
[1:35:55] it like job job had a value for the
[1:35:58] things of
[1:35:59] God there's one thing about it we you
[1:36:02] know when we look at it that comes that
[1:36:05] comes by A Love Affair in our life you
[1:36:08] see I I couldn't look to you or somebody
[1:36:10] else and say hey you need to esteem the
[1:36:13] word of God more well it's true we we
[1:36:15] should esteem it but to realize if you
[1:36:17] don't if that's not there in your heart
[1:36:20] to where you valow value his
[1:36:23] words his
[1:36:26] words if you don't value it and it's not
[1:36:29] something that you esteem more than
[1:36:30] anything else then it's something to say
[1:36:33] Lord I need to go deeper am and frankly
[1:36:37] all of us need to go
[1:36:39] deeper but I think it's very very
[1:36:41] crucial to understand that that look
[1:36:43] God's not throwing anybody under the bus
[1:36:45] the Bible said he upholdeth all that
[1:36:47] fall and he raiseth up so God's here to
[1:36:50] take us to a deeper walk right do you
[1:36:53] realize that they could not go into the
[1:36:55] holiest of holies on their own they had
[1:36:57] to go in by the
[1:36:59] blood is that right and the only way
[1:37:02] it's God coming down really it's not you
[1:37:05] and I walking somewhere else it's God
[1:37:08] it's the blood going deeper in our
[1:37:12] life because this is his
[1:37:14] Tabernacle this is to be his Dwelling
[1:37:17] Place you love him
[1:37:19] tonight and he's the one who's up
[1:37:21] holding you he's the one who's giving
[1:37:23] you the strength sometimes we look and
[1:37:24] say well you know like Ezra the rest why
[1:37:27] why is all this this adversity and why
[1:37:29] is all these uh different things that's
[1:37:30] that's going on around me I tell you
[1:37:32] it's just a moment to say Lord just help
[1:37:34] me in the midst of this just to see you
[1:37:37] and what I mean by seeing you is to
[1:37:39] recognize it's him that's holding you
[1:37:41] and the same God that's holding you now
[1:37:43] is the same God that's been holding you
[1:37:44] all along and God allows and he permits
[1:37:47] situations to arise in our life like
[1:37:50] example
[1:37:52] forgiveness well how would we ever be
[1:37:54] able to how how would you practice
[1:37:57] forgiveness if you had nobody to
[1:38:00] forgive but see God calls upon us to do
[1:38:04] that but you know you can't do that on
[1:38:06] your own it takes the strength of
[1:38:09] almighty God it takes God to bring that
[1:38:12] release within your life is that right
[1:38:16] this is why when reconciling itself the
[1:38:18] reconcile forgiveness leads to
[1:38:21] reconciliation and reconcile means to
[1:38:23] restore to a former state of Harmony now
[1:38:26] former state of Harmony doesn't mean
[1:38:28] you're setting down back at the coffee
[1:38:30] shop perhaps like you used to but the
[1:38:33] former state of Harmony is where
[1:38:34] everything within you is free and
[1:38:38] clear are you hearing me to where
[1:38:41] there's no animosity in
[1:38:43] here there's no feeling in here if
[1:38:46] there's still that feeling I think we
[1:38:48] can be honest before God tonight and
[1:38:50] that's what God wants that's a moment
[1:38:53] for his right hand to be made manifest
[1:38:56] that as he works things out in our life
[1:38:58] I need more I need more of him I want
[1:39:02] more of him and I just want I want to
[1:39:04] just rest and just look to him and say
[1:39:06] God you brought me this far you'll take
[1:39:09] me the rest of the way if you need a
[1:39:11] deeper walk with God which all of us do
[1:39:13] then you know what God's here to take us
[1:39:15] the rest of the way if you need that of
[1:39:16] the Seal of the Holy Ghost upon your
[1:39:18] soul God will take you the rest of the
[1:39:20] way stay with him amen put your hand in
[1:39:25] his hand and let him take you there he
[1:39:28] will take you to where you need to be
[1:39:31] this is this is our comfort don't you
[1:39:34] love him amen let's just
[1:39:37] pray Heavenly
[1:39:41] Father Lord how thankful We Are Tonight
[1:39:44] Lord
[1:39:45] that we have Lord a true Assurance Lord
[1:39:50] we can look back lord over our lives and
[1:39:55] Lord just from the beginnings Lord and
[1:39:59] see Lord that sometimes Lord even in the
[1:40:03] very beginning when there's hard trials
[1:40:05] and things that come Lord father that
[1:40:08] test us because as you said in your word
[1:40:10] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:40:12] be tested and tried Lord there's things
[1:40:17] sometimes that at that moment we did not
[1:40:20] know how we were going to make it but
[1:40:23] Lord your
[1:40:26] strength has proven to be perfect
[1:40:29] certainly certainly wasn't me certainly
[1:40:32] wasn't us holding on Lord It's your
[1:40:35] strength in our
[1:40:37] life Lord is each one Lord in Journey
[1:40:42] with you Lord I pray tonight
[1:40:45] God think of how your Prophet said it
[1:40:48] like this when the Holy Spirit would St
[1:40:50] strike the heart for any tonight Lord
[1:40:54] that hear under the sound of my voice or
[1:40:57] Lord would stream or archive this if
[1:41:00] there not come to that place Lord where
[1:41:01] there's an anchor and there's a hold in
[1:41:04] their
[1:41:05] life a something Lord that brings
[1:41:09] about that
[1:41:12] value that
[1:41:14] passion that love for you that no matter
[1:41:16] through tests trials
[1:41:19] disappointments
[1:41:22] Lord the prophet said it like this he
[1:41:25] said
[1:41:26] God may they
[1:41:29] denounce all of Satan's
[1:41:32] whispers about their lives telling them
[1:41:35] it's not for them they can't have it may
[1:41:39] they brush that aside and me a great
[1:41:43] determination of the Holy Ghost come
[1:41:45] upon their
[1:41:47] lives Lord even before
[1:41:52] we were fully quickened it was the
[1:41:56] quickening power of God that was
[1:41:59] propelling us drawing
[1:42:02] us leading us Lord moving us wooing
[1:42:08] us and
[1:42:11] Lord we find it here
[1:42:14] now that here Lord that's never
[1:42:19] stopped Lord our
[1:42:22] desire is just to please
[1:42:25] you Lord no matter what situation as
[1:42:29] Paul said I have learned to be
[1:42:32] content no matter how I find
[1:42:36] myself Paul would say in another place
[1:42:39] none of these things move
[1:42:43] me oh God how we're thankful
[1:42:48] Lord for your right hand that that
[1:42:50] upholds us
[1:42:52] Lord It's you working Lord
[1:42:56] It's job Lord under inspiration would
[1:42:59] use this figuratively of the left hand
[1:43:02] he doth work and the right hand we know
[1:43:04] that right hand signifies power and
[1:43:07] authority and Lord to see
[1:43:10] that there's so many things that Lord
