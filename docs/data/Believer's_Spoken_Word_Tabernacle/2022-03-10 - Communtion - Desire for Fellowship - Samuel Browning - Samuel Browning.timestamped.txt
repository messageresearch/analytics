[39:43] verse of scripture there i want to
[39:45] mention to you a few announcements
[39:48] that is first of all this sunday is the
[39:50] special offering for the building
[39:51] project
[39:53] brother shane had followed up with an
[39:56] email that you had
[39:57] received regarding the church calendar
[40:00] for march
[40:01] the shane followed up with that email to
[40:03] give current amounts and where we're at
[40:05] with everything
[40:07] so would you just be in prayer continue
[40:09] in prayer about that and how god would
[40:11] lay upon your heart
[40:13] amen as we go forward in that project
[40:16] also
[40:17] brother brandon senecola will be
[40:20] ministering for us this sunday
[40:22] i'll just ask you to keep myself in
[40:24] prayer i'll lord willing to be with
[40:25] brother jonathan martin
[40:27] in service there in the morning and then
[40:29] a youth service in the evening there in
[40:31] lima
[40:32] so if you just remember us in prayer
[40:35] and
[40:36] also brother brandon being here
[40:39] and we put out to you um on that
[40:42] announcement of
[40:43] some special services here with brother
[40:45] berry coffee on march 26th and 27th
[40:50] and those are just
[40:52] some services that i've had on my heart
[40:55] since back in the first part of november
[40:57] when i just just dropped in my heart and
[40:59] i contacted brother berry and of course
[41:01] you know that
[41:02] barry's very been very much involved
[41:04] with everything with
[41:06] ukraine and russia and it's just one
[41:09] channel that's been there it's just been
[41:10] easy to feed everything through that
[41:12] channel and so
[41:14] and that that's been mounting there so
[41:17] the reason
[41:18] i didn't get that to you earlier it's
[41:20] because it still was kind of hanging and
[41:22] not knowing right where it was
[41:25] and so
[41:26] the lord willing we're going to make
[41:28] this happen and i just there's some just
[41:30] some real things that
[41:32] i just felt just to come in and just to
[41:34] focus on some things and uh so i just
[41:38] really appreciate brother barry's
[41:40] ministry uh myself and my family we've
[41:43] been just we've been blessed
[41:45] and just been benefited and i know some
[41:47] of the rest of you you know brother
[41:49] barry well either you've streamed him on
[41:50] the internet or you've heard him speak
[41:52] in person and so i just i just really i
[41:55] appreciate that i appreciate all of
[41:57] god's gifts
[41:58] they're all every gift is different
[42:00] but i appreciate it because we need
[42:02] every gift
[42:04] amen
[42:05] so let's look here in the word of god
[42:07] tonight psalm 65
[42:09] and let's read here verse one
[42:13] it says a song a psalm in a song of
[42:15] david prays
[42:17] waited for thee o god
[42:19] in zion
[42:20] and unto thee shall the vow
[42:22] be performed i wish i could preach on
[42:25] that
[42:26] oh thou that hearest prayer notice what
[42:29] he says in verse two oh thou that hearst
[42:32] prayer there's there's no wondering does
[42:34] god hear prayer
[42:36] and you realize from the first verse in
[42:38] order to say praises waiting for you is
[42:41] talking of a life that is free
[42:43] because worship is a result of freedom
[42:48] praise is waiting for you in zion i know
[42:51] you're coming
[42:52] and so when i see you come i'm going to
[42:54] release my praise
[42:57] oh thou that hearest prayer
[43:00] unto thee shall all flesh come
[43:02] iniquities prevail against me as for our
[43:06] transgressions thou shalt purge them
[43:09] away
[43:10] blessed is the man whom thou
[43:13] chooses
[43:14] and calls it to approach
[43:17] unto thee
[43:18] that he may dwell in thy courts
[43:21] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[43:24] of thy house even of thy holy temple
[43:28] by terrible things meaning awesome
[43:30] things in righteousness
[43:32] wilt thou answer us
[43:35] o god
[43:36] of our salvation
[43:38] we want the confidence
[43:40] of all the ends of the earth and of them
[43:43] that are afar
[43:44] upon the sea
[43:46] i could say right now in this time he is
[43:48] our confidence
[43:50] as as paul would write on whom the ends
[43:52] of the earth have come and brother brown
[43:54] would take that scripture in corinthians
[43:56] and say what he is saying there is now
[43:58] where we are standing in the end time on
[44:01] whom where the end of the world has come
[44:04] but what a time in an hour to have a
[44:06] confidence
[44:08] in the lord
[44:09] amen amen may god bless you bless the
[44:12] reading of the word as you're being
[44:13] seated tonight i want to speak here just
[44:15] a few moments
[44:17] go a little bit further on that thought
[44:19] of communion we've been speaking on
[44:21] prayer
[44:23] and i want to just move into that a
[44:25] little bit more
[44:27] we started looking at that thought last
[44:29] week on settled and listening and
[44:31] i'm not going to get there tonight into
[44:33] that part of it
[44:35] of being settled and listening but
[44:36] that's the goal that god has with
[44:38] communion is where
[44:40] we come to a place of rest
[44:42] and to where that we're
[44:44] available
[44:45] and open in communion with him
[44:49] and there's things that as we recognize
[44:52] that this tonight i'd like to just speak
[44:54] on a communion and a desire for
[44:57] fellowship
[44:59] and truly there's no
[45:01] real
[45:02] child of god but
[45:04] you long to get in the presence of god
[45:08] sometimes there's things that can
[45:10] work or we allow and i just say it like
[45:12] this we allow god doesn't put any
[45:14] hindrances
[45:15] if there's any hindrances is what we
[45:17] allow
[45:18] or what we permit
[45:20] but i'm glad that there's grace and
[45:22] mercy to a company
[45:24] that can speak to any hindrance that can
[45:27] minister to our lives and that woos us
[45:30] into fellowship
[45:32] i want you to think of this how david
[45:33] would write it here when we would look
[45:36] at that in psalms 65 4 blessed is the
[45:39] man whom thou
[45:40] chooseth and calls us so notice the
[45:43] causing to approach unto him is directly
[45:46] related to the choosing of god
[45:49] you see no man sought god at any time it
[45:52] was god that came seeking for man
[45:55] there's no way we could find our way
[45:57] so the way himself became us
[46:01] that he might direct us and bring us
[46:03] into the way so blessed is the man whom
[46:06] thou chooseth and calls us so even in
[46:09] the causing when you recognize god
[46:11] dealing with your heart and drawing you
[46:13] into that place and there's a longing
[46:16] for something more we can fellowship
[46:18] with this that there were things that
[46:20] were in our lives i remember before god
[46:23] you know a full surrender in my life but
[46:25] there began to be a desire for something
[46:29] more than the things of the world those
[46:31] things it was just losing all of its uh
[46:35] its you know value or what we would look
[46:37] at but there was something that was
[46:39] moving there it was god that was
[46:41] stirring up and causing things to begin
[46:43] to look in a different way it was god
[46:46] dealing with our lives so even in god
[46:49] dealing with our lives that is a
[46:51] blessing that he would cause us to
[46:54] approach unto his courts
[46:56] you're a blessed person for the holy
[46:58] spirit to come by and speak to your
[47:00] heart you're a blessed person tonight
[47:03] amen when god met mary there through the
[47:05] ministry of gabriel what did he say
[47:08] blessed art thou and highly favored
[47:10] among men she didn't become blessed at
[47:12] that moment he was announcing to her
[47:15] your whole life you've been blessed
[47:19] you did not become blessed you always
[47:21] were blessed it was god watching over
[47:23] your life to bring you to the place
[47:26] where his blessing can be poured out to
[47:29] fully make known to you the blessing
[47:31] that rests
[47:33] in your life
[47:35] so psalms 84 verse 1 notice how david
[47:38] would write how amiable awesome are thy
[47:40] tabernacles o lord of hosts the courts
[47:43] my soul longeth yea even fainteth for
[47:46] the courts of the lord my heart and my
[47:49] flesh crack out for the living god if
[47:51] david a man under the law of god would
[47:54] desire to get in the presence of god and
[47:57] all that he knew was the law of god
[47:59] david knew what it was to get in the
[48:00] presence of god but to think about it
[48:02] that was only a shadow that was only a
[48:05] type what ought that to do to the
[48:08] children of god that are partakers of
[48:11] the blood of jesus christ it's a longing
[48:14] to get into his presence
[48:17] well let me just say this his presence
[48:19] don't allow it to be limited to just
[48:22] coming on a thursday or a sunday
[48:25] that's not god's desire but he announced
[48:27] his desire in matthew 28 that lo i am
[48:30] with thee always whether so ever thou
[48:33] goes so it's god's presence then that we
[48:36] are invited to be partakers of his
[48:38] presence and notice david would say yea
[48:41] the sparrow have found a house the
[48:43] swallow a nest for herself where she may
[48:46] lay her young even than altars o lord of
[48:50] hosts my king and my god
[48:53] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[48:56] they will still be praising thee
[49:00] in psalms 16 11 david david said thou
[49:03] wilt show me the path of life and in thy
[49:05] presence is fullness of joy at thy right
[49:09] hand are pleasures
[49:11] forevermore
[49:13] so david is already announcing under an
[49:17] unction and inspiration of the holy
[49:18] spirit of where the real pleasures and
[49:22] where the real delight where the real
[49:24] joy is for a child of god you you can't
[49:27] find joy in any other thing if your joy
[49:30] is limited to that of the world then you
[49:33] need to recognize that i i need that joy
[49:36] that the lord jesus spoke on because the
[49:39] joy of the world it comes and goes and
[49:41] let's face it we can get a new job and
[49:43] manic everything can just seem like this
[49:45] is the best thing
[49:47] since sliced bread and we get there and
[49:49] realize there's mold on this bread too
[49:52] there's hairs in these biscuits too are
[49:54] you with me because we realize there's
[49:56] always a law of contrast no matter what
[49:58] you do there's always good and there's
[50:00] always bad and if there's things that
[50:02] god has led you into whatever he leads
[50:05] you into does not mean it's going to be
[50:06] a rosy pathway but whatever god leads
[50:09] you into and he's there and he's guiding
[50:11] you in it all you have to do is say lord
[50:14] with these things that are coming along
[50:15] my way lord let me submit myself that my
[50:19] character can be molded through these
[50:22] things that it might match the image
[50:24] that you're calling me to lord
[50:26] you see god knows exactly what he's
[50:28] doing so here david is announcing that
[50:31] it's in the presence of the lord that
[50:33] there's fullness of joy and it's at his
[50:35] right hand in the power if that is his
[50:38] right hand in his strength
[50:40] this is where there are pleasures
[50:42] forevermore
[50:44] you know no wonder what brother branham
[50:45] could say the greatest thrill of my life
[50:48] the greatest thrill of the church is to
[50:50] pray until we can get into that place of
[50:52] his presence i'm sure i can i'm talking
[50:54] to believers tonight that there's times
[50:57] as you get into his presence there and
[50:59] here you're able to move into that place
[51:01] past all of the distractions and
[51:03] thinking about the load of laundry and
[51:05] thinking about tomorrow where you're
[51:07] able to come into that place in his
[51:08] presence where he begins to speak back
[51:11] to you and and you get up from your
[51:13] knees or on your face or walking around
[51:15] and here you go throughout the day and
[51:17] he's still speaking to you he's bringing
[51:20] things to you if there's a channel that
[51:22] becomes open between you and god and you
[51:25] find yourself listening to the word and
[51:27] there's things that you're reading in
[51:28] the word hearing in the word and you say
[51:30] my i never seen it like this before but
[51:33] it's the effects of being in his
[51:35] presence
[51:37] there's a channel that becomes open to
[51:39] you and i so when we look at prayer and
[51:41] i i think if we'll take it in this
[51:43] manner prayer itself because we hear a
[51:46] lot of things you know where i think as
[51:48] we've looked at it last week and
[51:49] throughout times when when a nation or
[51:52] or people get in trouble and everything
[51:54] is pray and pray and remember brother
[51:56] branham announces in the world falling
[51:58] apart again he said it isn't a day of
[52:00] prayer we need we need a day of
[52:02] repentance now the prophet is not
[52:05] speaking against prayer because paul
[52:07] would identify i would that every men
[52:09] would pray everywhere lifting up holy
[52:12] hands but the scripture goes on to say
[52:14] without wrath and without doubting so in
[52:17] order to bring it to that place there's
[52:19] got to be a repentance or a provision
[52:22] made that where we are in prayer that
[52:25] it's real communion with god because
[52:28] prayer itself is not a religious act
[52:32] i know it is limited to many as a
[52:34] religious act but prayer is not a
[52:37] religious act prayer is a communion with
[52:40] god prayer is not confined even to your
[52:43] prayer closet although i think it's good
[52:45] to have a place that's designated where
[52:48] you're able to go but prayer itself paul
[52:50] could say that men would pray without
[52:52] ceasing that they would pray everywhere
[52:55] and by praying always is that right so
[52:58] it would speak to you and i that prayer
[53:00] is not something of a tradition or
[53:03] religious ceremony but prayer is a
[53:05] contact with a living god where there is
[53:08] a communion with almighty god himself
[53:11] that no matter where we go there is a
[53:14] channel that has been opened to you and
[53:16] i to be able not only to speak to god
[53:19] but to hear from god
[53:22] you see when we're talking about this
[53:24] with communion prayer
[53:26] is real communion brother iran would
[53:28] take it into this manner and he would
[53:29] talk about the communion as far as he
[53:32] would say you know the sacraments that
[53:33] of the that of the bread and that of the
[53:35] wine he said that's not really communion
[53:36] he said we've got that he said from from
[53:38] the church he said that he said real
[53:40] communion is talking with god face to
[53:44] face
[53:45] it's being able to have in communion
[53:47] this when we take communion is only a
[53:50] testimony that i am in fellowship with
[53:53] the living god that's what that is
[53:57] is that right
[53:58] now notice when we look at this of
[54:00] communion so communion itself it deals
[54:03] with being able to talk to somebody to
[54:05] not talk at them sometimes we're really
[54:08] good at that we can talk at people right
[54:11] but communion is talking with one
[54:13] another so in other words you can speak
[54:16] to them and they'll speak back to you
[54:19] it's a two-way street is that right you
[54:22] know that's why when we read it last
[54:24] week brother brandon would tell us you
[54:25] can listen to a radio watch a television
[54:28] hope you don't but if you do they're you
[54:30] know they can't commune back to you
[54:32] right it's a one-way street you can't
[54:34] stop the announcer on the news and say
[54:36] wait wait wait wait that's fake that
[54:37] ain't right you can't do that
[54:39] is that right it's not a communion you
[54:42] can't stop that so communion even
[54:44] brother branham said me standing here
[54:47] ministering the word is not communion
[54:50] but it is a necessity the preaching of
[54:54] the word will point us to fellowship you
[54:57] see there's things that sometimes in our
[54:59] life let's take here the sinner coming
[55:02] it takes the preaching of the word to
[55:04] bring conviction and point them in the
[55:06] right way that calls them into a full
[55:09] fellowship and it's also the preaching
[55:12] of the word when we come and we hear the
[55:14] word this is why when we hear it that's
[55:16] why brother ramsey says a person can say
[55:18] i can stay home from church and be just
[55:20] as good a person brother bram said no
[55:21] you can't do that he said coming to the
[55:24] house of god keeps us in fellowship more
[55:27] than just fellowship with one another
[55:29] and to know what's going on in the
[55:31] assembly but it keeps us in a place of
[55:33] fellowship
[55:34] because the living word comes by and
[55:36] ministers to conditions and to needs and
[55:40] to situations that are in our lives
[55:42] because it's god's desire that we remain
[55:45] in fellowship
[55:47] is that right
[55:48] now when we're looking at this we
[55:50] realize that you know brother brandon
[55:52] would tell us with that of the communion
[55:53] that you know he says one of the things
[55:56] that we make the biggest mistake on now
[55:58] you know
[55:59] we'll get to this eventually but just to
[56:01] drop this in tonight he said the
[56:03] greatest mistake we have and i could say
[56:05] that covers every one of us he said is
[56:07] we do too much talking
[56:11] we get there and we're in prayer and he
[56:14] says you know we're talking about lord
[56:16] do something for so and so do something
[56:18] for so-and-so do something for so-and-so
[56:20] he said that in communion you're only
[56:22] asking for favors
[56:25] but you see communion is where there is
[56:27] a there is a transmission of strength
[56:31] should we ask requests we should ask
[56:33] requests but our prayer prayer is not
[56:36] limited to requests that's not communion
[56:40] communion is fellowship if it's only
[56:42] request it's no more than you or i being
[56:45] the radio or the tv to god
[56:47] he can't speak back at all we don't have
[56:49] no time lord i got 15 minutes fit this
[56:51] in you'll have to you got to come within
[56:53] 15 minutes you might as well save your
[56:56] time you're all twisted up in your
[56:58] spirit you'll never be able to break
[57:00] beyond that realm but instead to
[57:02] approach almighty god don't put him on a
[57:05] time schedule but say i'm going to
[57:07] redeem the time i'm going to step back
[57:10] into a place and stop allowing all these
[57:12] pressures to encroach on my time
[57:16] oh my so we know that there's enough
[57:19] with brother we got to wait until he'll
[57:21] answer back sometimes he answers right
[57:23] then sometimes he answers moments later
[57:26] hour later days later
[57:29] we understand
[57:30] now what did you think of brother ryan
[57:32] would take this around
[57:34] in this message communion
[57:36] and he would speak of how a great way to
[57:39] commune is to be agreed and to agree on
[57:42] certain things
[57:43] we find that in the scriptures we read
[57:46] this last week out of revelations 3 20
[57:48] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[57:51] if any man hear my voice open the door i
[57:54] will come in to him
[57:56] and will suck with him and he with me
[58:00] now this scripture we we can labor on it
[58:02] long but we know that this is a
[58:03] scriptural promise that god has
[58:06] vindicated in this generation
[58:09] now it's not vindicated before the
[58:11] church that has put him out because when
[58:14] the church rejected the word the prophet
[58:16] tells us they disfellowshipped the holy
[58:19] spirit from their meetings so to welcome
[58:22] the holy spirit you've got to welcome
[58:24] the word and the word is not a letter
[58:27] because they all carry bibles but the
[58:29] word is the person of the holy ghost
[58:32] himself coming present into lives and
[58:35] knocking on doors and saying hey i love
[58:38] you i want to have fellowship with you
[58:42] amen it's not a god that's far away it's
[58:45] not pointing off to somewhere out in the
[58:47] distance but he says behold i stand at
[58:49] the door and knock he's announcing his
[58:52] personal presence i'm not coming i am
[58:55] here
[58:56] is that right we know his coming now in
[59:00] the fullness of the holy spirit it's
[59:02] what makes us ready and looking to the
[59:04] literal coming
[59:07] is that right
[59:08] so when we recognize this you know
[59:11] brother brown talks about in order to
[59:12] have communion and he says he ties it in
[59:15] with the eating
[59:16] and when you think of it when we look at
[59:18] things that that that that are eating
[59:20] because he said i will come into you and
[59:22] sup with him and he with me
[59:25] you know brother brown texts he takes
[59:27] this exact example in that message
[59:29] communion and he speaks of how that with
[59:32] communion
[59:33] eating is associated with it
[59:35] now think of it brother brown will take
[59:37] this and apply a simple example he said
[59:40] any good salesman knows
[59:42] not to talk to you about their product
[59:44] if they're just getting you out of bed
[59:46] before you get a chance to eat
[59:48] come on i could say man for that for
[59:50] every one of us
[59:52] right feed the bear
[59:54] right put the bear to bed so we can talk
[59:56] business
[59:58] right is that right well they call it
[1:00:01] not hungry they call it hangry
[1:00:04] right i mean you just know hey wait a
[1:00:05] minute wait wait wait you need to eat
[1:00:07] you need these
[1:00:09] eating's associated with it why because
[1:00:12] eating itself is where things get
[1:00:14] settled so then you can agree
[1:00:17] and you can begin to talk on things you
[1:00:19] you're in an agreement to sit down and
[1:00:21] discuss those things i'll just say it in
[1:00:23] this way you recognize that if that
[1:00:25] happens in the natural in that way how
[1:00:27] much more important is it that we have
[1:00:30] the right spiritual diet the word of god
[1:00:33] would come in this hour to direct us
[1:00:35] into fellowship but hold on now
[1:00:38] not only that but the right diet in our
[1:00:40] life that makes us ready for continual
[1:00:43] fellowship
[1:00:44] you see not only did the word have to
[1:00:46] come in this hour when we talk about the
[1:00:48] dynamics of the holy ghost coming in
[1:00:50] this hour you cannot have the dynamics
[1:00:52] without the mechanics but the dynamics
[1:00:55] come to put and direct us into the
[1:00:57] mechanics of the word that he might
[1:01:00] fully come behind it and make it alive
[1:01:03] that's what brother bram says he says i
[1:01:04] have to stand here he said and when he
[1:01:07] was preaching scriptural signs of the
[1:01:08] time in birmingham in 64. he said i know
[1:01:11] some of you are not aware of this
[1:01:13] ministry the message of the hour he said
[1:01:15] but i want to sow and lay these things
[1:01:18] out clear because there's no way you can
[1:01:20] have faith if you don't know what you're
[1:01:23] approaching so god lays out his word and
[1:01:27] he himself i said he lays it out not a
[1:01:30] man lays it out that's why we need the
[1:01:32] dynamics to lay out the mechanics
[1:01:34] because it builds faith in the presence
[1:01:37] of the living god what is it doing it's
[1:01:40] opening up the way
[1:01:43] so eating is associated with it and we
[1:01:45] can all say man if our diet gets off we
[1:01:48] get off in things of the world and i'm
[1:01:50] not talking about going out to bars and
[1:01:53] getting on this and i'm talking about if
[1:01:55] we're not feeding on the word of god
[1:01:58] it's really hard to get into prayer
[1:02:05] you see prayer
[1:02:07] feeding on the word of god it prepares
[1:02:10] you
[1:02:11] as you're listening to a message
[1:02:14] sometimes as you put on singing and you
[1:02:16] say well brother samuel i'm just praying
[1:02:18] i can tell you you can't cause god to
[1:02:21] break his order
[1:02:24] god won't break his order the greatest
[1:02:26] thing we could do is say lord i'm tired
[1:02:28] of frustration
[1:02:30] i'm tired of spinning around i'm tired
[1:02:32] of trying to tell you what you need to
[1:02:34] do in my life instead i realize this is
[1:02:38] what i need to do
[1:02:40] first of all to eat we've got to lay
[1:02:42] down our will my my my my
[1:02:45] you we've gotta we're eating on the word
[1:02:46] of god it prepares
[1:02:48] us to enter in and to have fellowship
[1:02:51] with god do you realize in these
[1:02:53] services right here if all you get out
[1:02:55] of this service and it sounds like help
[1:02:57] me forgive me it sounds like charlie
[1:02:59] brown's teacher up here and you get done
[1:03:01] with it and say i need prayer brother
[1:03:03] samuel you missed it god is speaking to
[1:03:06] our needs right now
[1:03:10] he's setting things in preparation and
[1:03:13] order right now
[1:03:15] if my mind was a little bit foggy and i
[1:03:17] found it so upon the things of this
[1:03:20] earth and it can be pressing needs but i
[1:03:23] believe there's a presence of a living
[1:03:25] god right here right now while the word
[1:03:27] is being spoken that you can look and go
[1:03:30] forward
[1:03:34] oh my those things that are alike
[1:03:37] is what dwells together
[1:03:39] is that right that's why when the dove
[1:03:41] descended down
[1:03:43] there that day on the river jordan he
[1:03:45] did not light up on a wolf
[1:03:47] it lit
[1:03:48] up on a lamb
[1:03:50] the dove did not make him the lamb of
[1:03:52] god he already was the lamb of god
[1:03:54] the dove only confirmed the lamb of god
[1:03:58] you see it was a heavenly creature that
[1:04:00] come down to be united with that of the
[1:04:02] earth
[1:04:04] that then through that uniting could
[1:04:06] come uniting in our life to take us into
[1:04:08] the heavenlies
[1:04:10] so it's all god condescending you see
[1:04:12] it's the same dove of the holy spirit
[1:04:15] that that brewed and made love to the
[1:04:17] earth back there in genesis 1 and
[1:04:19] brought it in condition is the same dove
[1:04:22] of the holy spirit that works with our
[1:04:24] life because we in our first nature are
[1:04:27] wolves
[1:04:30] come on friends
[1:04:32] but the dove of the holy spirit deals
[1:04:34] with our life he ain't working on that
[1:04:36] wolf he's drawing that lamb out that's
[1:04:39] on the inside because your name is not
[1:04:42] wrote in a wolf section your name has
[1:04:44] been wrote in the lamb section of the
[1:04:47] book of life
[1:04:49] glory be to god
[1:04:51] oh my those things that are alike dwell
[1:04:54] together
[1:04:55] oh hallelujah think of this what makes
[1:04:58] people fellowship
[1:05:00] what does it what causes man to love to
[1:05:03] get together
[1:05:05] you know brother baby tells us that when
[1:05:06] we see it
[1:05:07] man
[1:05:08] loves to fellowship
[1:05:11] even the unconverted man
[1:05:15] is that right
[1:05:17] isn't it amazing
[1:05:19] you don't have to tell the people
[1:05:21] you just watch a little bit and you'll
[1:05:22] find them fill up a room with 300 people
[1:05:25] and you give it a few hours a few days
[1:05:27] and you watch how things will start
[1:05:29] merging together
[1:05:31] there are certain things that what you
[1:05:32] start finding is is things that you have
[1:05:35] in common with other people
[1:05:38] i mean nobody wants to stand around and
[1:05:39] be a wallflower
[1:05:41] or brother tell me i'm humble stop lying
[1:05:44] that is not it at all everybody loves
[1:05:46] fellowship
[1:05:48] now a person can say oh i don't like
[1:05:49] fellowship no you're lying that's not
[1:05:52] the truth what it is somewhere along in
[1:05:54] your life you've been hurt and you're
[1:05:55] not allowing the holy spirit to deal
[1:05:58] with it and the response and the
[1:06:00] reaction in your life shows you need
[1:06:03] healing
[1:06:05] because it don't feel right
[1:06:08] is that right percentage i don't like
[1:06:10] being around big crowds oh brother
[1:06:11] samuel there's medicine for that there's
[1:06:13] a greater medicine than that it's the
[1:06:15] medicine of the holy ghost i'm not
[1:06:17] knocking medicine but you understand
[1:06:19] what i'm saying it comes to deal with
[1:06:21] that because it is a desire within a
[1:06:24] person's heart to be able to fellowship
[1:06:27] that's why people can get together with
[1:06:29] their ball
[1:06:30] teams right well you got to beg them to
[1:06:33] support even if it is the sorry browns
[1:06:35] you don't got to beg them to support it
[1:06:37] they'll get out there and eat their hot
[1:06:39] dogs and bratwurst and everything else
[1:06:41] and knowing there's probably a good
[1:06:42] chance they're going to
[1:06:45] boy lose
[1:06:45] browns would be excited about this one
[1:06:47] and i wouldn't
[1:06:48] they won't be tuning in maybe some of
[1:06:49] their fans will take notice though but i
[1:06:51] want you to see it in this manner that
[1:06:53] there's things that can start to come
[1:06:55] together
[1:06:56] people that things that they have in
[1:06:58] common but let me just remind you that
[1:07:00] you and i were not created for that
[1:07:03] fellowship
[1:07:04] that was not the first priority
[1:07:07] we were created to have fellowship with
[1:07:10] almighty god
[1:07:14] and the reality is the rules and
[1:07:16] sometimes is the things of the world and
[1:07:18] the appetite it's because of what's
[1:07:21] still there now let me just say it like
[1:07:22] this brother graham said i love to
[1:07:24] fellowship he said there's men out here
[1:07:26] that love to hunt and love to fish
[1:07:28] talking about in the in the in the
[1:07:30] assembly of where that he's ministering
[1:07:32] at and how that he loves to be with him
[1:07:34] now he says now he says you know i love
[1:07:36] to be around people who loves the lord
[1:07:39] and have fellowship with them because we
[1:07:42] see the same thing our motives are the
[1:07:45] same our ideas are the same i said i
[1:07:48] like to talk to people like that let me
[1:07:50] just say this like this if you're more
[1:07:52] comfortable with people of the world
[1:07:54] than you are with people of god you need
[1:07:57] the holy ghost
[1:08:00] plain and simple
[1:08:02] obviously now i don't know about being
[1:08:04] around people of god no no because if
[1:08:06] the love of god is in your heart you're
[1:08:09] you are a part of that body and that
[1:08:12] portion inside of you and that unity is
[1:08:15] greater than the uniting of anything of
[1:08:18] this earth even if it is your own family
[1:08:20] there's the uniting on the inside by the
[1:08:23] baptism of the holy ghost where you've
[1:08:25] been birthed and born into the body of
[1:08:28] jesus christ
[1:08:29] are you with me
[1:08:31] even with friends of this world listen
[1:08:34] now over the samuel but we got a witness
[1:08:36] too many times what we call witnessing
[1:08:39] is compromising
[1:08:41] i'm just going to lay it on the line
[1:08:43] oh i'm trying to win them you don't win
[1:08:45] them by going on their turf
[1:08:49] there's a desire when i can talk to
[1:08:52] somebody a neighbor or something happens
[1:08:54] at a store that i can have even when i
[1:08:56] was working there in the school system
[1:08:59] or i could talk when god would open the
[1:09:01] door trying to make inroads to talk to
[1:09:03] somebody but when it came to a place
[1:09:06] that you you know you're looking at
[1:09:07] things and they want to go you know out
[1:09:09] here to eat afterwards and this and that
[1:09:11] there may not been nothing wrong with
[1:09:13] the steakhouse but for me i didn't want
[1:09:16] to be around that atmosphere i knew that
[1:09:18] in that atmosphere there was going to be
[1:09:20] jokes flying
[1:09:22] there's going to be things that i didn't
[1:09:24] want to hear things i didn't want to be
[1:09:25] a partaker of come on somebody
[1:09:28] what is that that's a desire for
[1:09:30] fellowship
[1:09:32] but we've got to have the right kind of
[1:09:34] fellowship
[1:09:35] listen you don't think the devil ain't
[1:09:37] sly enough you talk of how that god will
[1:09:40] begin to deal and work with the life and
[1:09:42] the enemy will try to line up everybody
[1:09:44] in the world to try to draw you away
[1:09:46] from the fellowship that god has for
[1:09:49] your life
[1:09:52] brother samuel when god got a hold of
[1:09:53] your life did you quit your friends no
[1:09:55] they quit me
[1:09:57] i'll tell you why because they wanted to
[1:09:59] tell me you can come out here you can
[1:10:00] just drink a coke now i said you know
[1:10:02] what i don't know where it's written in
[1:10:04] the word but the bible said how can two
[1:10:05] or three walk together unless they be
[1:10:08] agreed i said i am not afraid of that i
[1:10:10] said but what it is i don't want to be
[1:10:12] around that atmosphere because i said
[1:10:14] there's been a change that's come into
[1:10:16] my life it's not what i can't do it's
[1:10:19] what i don't want to do
[1:10:23] oh my we're not under a message of
[1:10:26] reformation we're under a message of
[1:10:28] transformation
[1:10:31] amen you see there is a longing for
[1:10:34] fellowship
[1:10:36] it's a long
[1:10:38] among natural
[1:10:40] but that longing
[1:10:42] itself
[1:10:44] that comes from a strain
[1:10:47] that is placed within man
[1:10:49] brother branham would speak of that of
[1:10:51] that strain
[1:10:53] for fellowship
[1:10:54] because it's it's something where you
[1:10:56] can agree together
[1:10:59] that's what god within it
[1:11:01] and longing to have fellowship with man
[1:11:03] brother branham would say i love
[1:11:05] fellowship with man
[1:11:06] but the greatest fellowship
[1:11:09] are you understanding me
[1:11:10] the greatest fellowship
[1:11:13] now watch this when we look at
[1:11:15] with broken fellowship because
[1:11:18] in the beginning in the garden of eden
[1:11:22] there was perfect fellowship
[1:11:24] between god and his people
[1:11:27] but when sin entered
[1:11:30] sin
[1:11:31] broke
[1:11:32] the fellowship
[1:11:34] god didn't break the fellowship
[1:11:36] sin broken
[1:11:38] you see sin even in your life will
[1:11:40] interrupt
[1:11:41] fellowship
[1:11:44] god will not tread over top of it
[1:11:46] but he comes to deal with that
[1:11:50] god let me just let me just deal let me
[1:11:52] just speak a little bit on that broken
[1:11:54] fellowship
[1:11:55] think of how that when god came down in
[1:11:58] genesis 3 god came down
[1:12:01] when the announcement went out in heaven
[1:12:03] that there has that a fall has taken
[1:12:06] place
[1:12:07] god didn't send an angel
[1:12:10] he didn't send nobody else he came down
[1:12:13] himself
[1:12:15] now he had been coming down
[1:12:17] every evening time and would speak to
[1:12:20] them
[1:12:21] there was nothing that would prevent
[1:12:23] them from coming and gathering together
[1:12:27] when he would come down as a matter of
[1:12:28] fact when god would come down among them
[1:12:31] and they would hear the voice of the
[1:12:33] lord god walking amongst them here god
[1:12:36] embodied and moving among them they
[1:12:39] would run to that place a matter of fact
[1:12:41] they could not wait till that time of
[1:12:44] evening oh it's drawing close oh oh oh
[1:12:47] oh darling it's growing close to time
[1:12:49] for papa to come down there was an
[1:12:51] excitement where they could not wait to
[1:12:54] get there into his presence
[1:12:57] oh glory be to god
[1:12:59] and here when he came down in that
[1:13:02] announcement that there was a fall
[1:13:04] he's the one that begins to call out not
[1:13:06] adam he calls out where art thou
[1:13:11] now god knew where he was
[1:13:14] god knew what all had happened
[1:13:17] but god's grace and mercy is giving his
[1:13:20] child an opportunity to come out and say
[1:13:24] and confess what has taken place
[1:13:28] oh my let me just say this his presence
[1:13:30] when he comes it does bring fear it but
[1:13:33] a fear not a slavish fear or a fear of
[1:13:37] torment that's satan trying to get in
[1:13:39] there but the presence of god will bring
[1:13:42] a holy reverence and a holy fear as
[1:13:45] david said the fear of the lord is clean
[1:13:50] it's a fear it's a reverence to where
[1:13:52] when his word comes to deal and uncover
[1:13:55] and deal with hindrances
[1:13:58] it invites us to a place to say yes lord
[1:14:01] forgive me lord god
[1:14:03] cleanse me lord jesus
[1:14:08] iran would take it up in this manner
[1:14:10] in the message oneness
[1:14:13] of that perfect harmony
[1:14:15] that god had with adam
[1:14:17] and eve
[1:14:20] he could come down
[1:14:22] at any time
[1:14:23] and talk lip to ear
[1:14:26] to them
[1:14:29] now i want you to think about it
[1:14:31] with the prophets
[1:14:33] god could god would come
[1:14:35] and his presence would lift
[1:14:37] then his presence would come on the
[1:14:38] prophet and it would lift
[1:14:40] why
[1:14:41] because that anointing would come to
[1:14:44] announce redemption is coming
[1:14:47] but when the lamb of god walked up out
[1:14:49] of the river jordan the dove came down
[1:14:52] and abode on the lamb showing that
[1:14:56] through this sacrifice it will not be
[1:14:58] the spirit of god coming and leaving and
[1:15:01] coming and leaving but when the spirit
[1:15:03] of god through this sacrifice the
[1:15:05] announcement of the blood when it comes
[1:15:08] upon your life it does not depart but i
[1:15:10] will be with you
[1:15:12] even in you
[1:15:15] amen i'll abide in you and you will
[1:15:17] abide in me
[1:15:21] coming back to this place of where
[1:15:24] god could come down
[1:15:26] at any time and talk
[1:15:28] live to hear any time he desired
[1:15:34] now one thing we've got to admit
[1:15:36] his desire is greater than our desire
[1:15:41] yeah
[1:15:42] don't matter if you're here or you're on
[1:15:43] the internet and setting self
[1:15:44] righteously it don't matter i'm just
[1:15:46] telling the truth
[1:15:48] his desire is greater than our desire
[1:15:51] but it's his desire that comes down that
[1:15:54] influences us
[1:15:56] and builds and brings faith and brings
[1:15:59] courage and stirs things up that we need
[1:16:02] to be praying for
[1:16:06] oh glory be to god
[1:16:09] so man now what you think of brother
[1:16:10] brown would put it like this
[1:16:12] he says now there was such a perfect
[1:16:14] harmony
[1:16:15] with god till they were one with god god
[1:16:17] and his family
[1:16:19] was one
[1:16:20] and a man in his family a correct good
[1:16:23] noble obedient family is one with
[1:16:24] another any family if there's something
[1:16:27] in that family that moves them apart
[1:16:28] then it's not right the family is broken
[1:16:30] somewhere they should all be one father
[1:16:33] with mother and mother with father
[1:16:35] children with parent parent with
[1:16:37] children all in agreement
[1:16:40] now don't hang up on me now
[1:16:43] oh brother samuel that's right where i'm
[1:16:44] at don't hang up on me now
[1:16:47] because whether you know it or not
[1:16:49] you're part of the solution
[1:16:52] and when you see that you'll see one
[1:16:56] lovely picture
[1:16:58] now think god's purpose
[1:17:00] was so that there would be
[1:17:03] a a a coming together in a union once
[1:17:06] again where fellowship would be restored
[1:17:10] and how would that fellowship be
[1:17:11] restored is when god's nature would come
[1:17:15] fully on the inside of his children
[1:17:19] i want you to think of this
[1:17:21] god we know will not override our own
[1:17:23] will
[1:17:24] god will not do that
[1:17:26] but god works to bring our will in
[1:17:29] surrender to his will
[1:17:31] now think of that then he said how that
[1:17:34] there was a beautiful picture there in
[1:17:36] the garden of eden no heartache no worry
[1:17:40] no nothing just joy unspeakable
[1:17:44] think oh brother samuel
[1:17:46] if i could just get back there
[1:17:48] no worries brother samuel do you got a
[1:17:51] month i could tell you all my worries no
[1:17:54] i don't even have 30 minutes or you
[1:17:56] could tell me all your worries and a
[1:17:58] matter of fact you really don't have to
[1:17:59] do that because this what god has
[1:18:03] desired we can come back into that place
[1:18:06] where the prophet could say us as long
[1:18:08] as adam had fellowship with god he
[1:18:11] had no worries
[1:18:16] oh this is more than don't worry be
[1:18:17] happy this is a reality
[1:18:20] when we're in fellowship with him and we
[1:18:23] have fellowship with him listen let me
[1:18:25] tell you we're not speaking to the
[1:18:27] janitor we're not speaking to the
[1:18:28] secretary we're talking to the main man
[1:18:31] we're talking to the almighty god who's
[1:18:34] over it all
[1:18:36] this ain't like talking to your friends
[1:18:38] on facebook that can get around it with
[1:18:40] a pow wow and cry on one another's
[1:18:41] shoulder oh that's so bad that's so
[1:18:43] terrible i'm so sorry for you we don't
[1:18:45] get a lick of health that way but
[1:18:47] there's one that not only will hear what
[1:18:49] you're going through but there's virtue
[1:18:52] in this blood that's able to reach out
[1:18:55] and deal with that situation and give
[1:18:58] you strength and give you courage
[1:19:02] oh glory be to god
[1:19:04] think of this
[1:19:06] when there was something that moved his
[1:19:08] family apart
[1:19:10] what did god do
[1:19:12] he came down himself
[1:19:16] when there's something in your home that
[1:19:17] good moves apart
[1:19:19] this is where you have to start saying
[1:19:21] god let that anointing of redeemer move
[1:19:24] in my life
[1:19:27] if there's something that comes up in
[1:19:28] the church between you and another
[1:19:30] brother another sister of family let
[1:19:32] that anointing of redeemer move on my
[1:19:35] life that reaches out in redemption
[1:19:39] right now there's stages in redemption
[1:19:41] forgiveness and reconciliation they're
[1:19:44] not the same thing
[1:19:46] but forgiveness will lead to
[1:19:48] reconciliation
[1:19:50] is that right
[1:19:53] oh my it's just like you can forgive
[1:19:55] somebody and you should because you
[1:19:57] can't stay praying with faith if you
[1:19:59] have ought in your heart
[1:20:01] so you can forgive and look to god
[1:20:04] to deal with that life to bring
[1:20:06] reconciliation
[1:20:09] are you with me
[1:20:11] oh glory be to god so then when we look
[1:20:14] that's the only grounds brother brahma
[1:20:15] said it this way that's the only grounds
[1:20:18] that god has ever laid down for
[1:20:21] fellowship is for himself and his church
[1:20:24] is the oneness of himself in the people
[1:20:28] that's the only grounds of fellowship
[1:20:30] the only way you can have those grounds
[1:20:32] is by union to be united with him
[1:20:34] forever so how we have this established
[1:20:37] that this is god's grounds for
[1:20:39] fellowship
[1:20:41] is a uniting
[1:20:43] with him
[1:20:44] god's desire
[1:20:47] is and was for communion
[1:20:51] fellowship
[1:20:52] and the only way
[1:20:54] that that those grounds that a
[1:20:55] fellowship can really be fulfilled is
[1:20:58] when his life
[1:20:59] has fully come in us
[1:21:01] and we're under the blood
[1:21:04] is that right
[1:21:06] think of this
[1:21:08] when god as he came down
[1:21:10] he came down personally
[1:21:13] and that was that god laid down the
[1:21:15] basis of how
[1:21:17] that he would deal with man because when
[1:21:19] we talk about fellowship we're talking
[1:21:21] about relationship
[1:21:24] you see love itself brother man we put
[1:21:26] it this way
[1:21:27] love
[1:21:28] demands fellowship
[1:21:31] he said like a young man he becomes
[1:21:33] interested in a young lady he said but
[1:21:35] before he can ever have fellowship with
[1:21:37] her relationship there's got to be
[1:21:40] necessary agreements
[1:21:43] with them is laying this out you know
[1:21:44] it's a theme throughout the whole
[1:21:45] message because we're in the time where
[1:21:48] where where let us be glad and rejoice
[1:21:50] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:21:52] and he lets it be known that no matter
[1:21:54] what that young man thinks about that
[1:21:55] young lady he first of all he's got to
[1:21:58] be able to take her to be his wife
[1:22:00] there's got to be a proposing
[1:22:03] is that right
[1:22:04] and there's got to then be an acceptance
[1:22:06] it's not brother brown takes us in the
[1:22:08] church age book he said it's not the
[1:22:09] woman who decides to accept the man but
[1:22:12] he said it's the man that is speaking to
[1:22:14] the woman and the woman accepts that
[1:22:18] invitation
[1:22:19] are you with me that's a vow that's a
[1:22:21] betrothal that's why there is that that
[1:22:24] necessary of a proposal
[1:22:26] is that right
[1:22:28] oh my it's just like when my wife and i
[1:22:29] were getting ready to get married you
[1:22:31] know well i say getting ready to get
[1:22:32] married you know i let her know you know
[1:22:34] months coming on hey you know what i
[1:22:36] went and looked at rings i was waiting
[1:22:38] to see if there was chirp chirp chirp
[1:22:40] chirp chirp chirp or click on the other
[1:22:42] end
[1:22:43] what was i doing i was announcing
[1:22:47] where the seriousness of the intentions
[1:22:49] of what's coming on
[1:22:51] in other words you want to back out go
[1:22:52] ahead and back out we weren't tied to
[1:22:54] one another
[1:22:56] we kept talking
[1:22:58] it's pretty evident eventually when it
[1:23:00] came to the proposal
[1:23:02] she accepted
[1:23:04] that's pretty evident right there's a
[1:23:06] lot of manifestation from all that
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:11] but you see all of that had to take
[1:23:14] place that's the same way that god works
[1:23:16] with our life
[1:23:18] he doesn't force himself on our life god
[1:23:20] makes clear through the preaching of the
[1:23:22] gospel his intention and his desire for
[1:23:26] fellowship for relationship with us
[1:23:31] but everything in itself notice there
[1:23:34] must be
[1:23:35] a process and god has that process now i
[1:23:37] want you to think of this in luke 17. i
[1:23:40] can't read all these scriptures but
[1:23:42] you're familiar with them but you can
[1:23:43] read over them tonight or or tomorrow
[1:23:46] look how god's desire for fellowship
[1:23:48] when the lord jesus
[1:23:50] hears standing
[1:23:51] god
[1:23:52] made flesh
[1:23:54] oh my
[1:23:55] oh my you see brother brown takes that
[1:23:57] up and he says god came down in the
[1:24:01] garden and begin to holler for adam and
[1:24:04] eve he said oh look how look how the
[1:24:06] spirit of god would take us he said look
[1:24:08] he said that's why i disagree he said
[1:24:11] with men just trying to put a social
[1:24:13] status upon jesus as though him just
[1:24:16] being a prophet he said it was nothing
[1:24:18] less than god made manifest
[1:24:23] listen to me when god became brethren
[1:24:25] with us it was not a separate person it
[1:24:28] speaks of how great his condescension
[1:24:32] was that he so merged himself
[1:24:36] to become brethren
[1:24:40] god uses personification personal ways
[1:24:44] the arm of the lord stretched down the
[1:24:46] hand of the lord he shows and deals with
[1:24:49] these things to show how personal that
[1:24:52] he has become to his people
[1:24:54] in john 17 as he's standing there and
[1:24:57] you're aware
[1:24:59] of of that prayer it's an intercessory
[1:25:01] prayer it's a prayer of redemption
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:05] he said i'm not praying for the whole
[1:25:06] world
[1:25:08] but i'm praying for those
[1:25:10] that are thine for thine or mine
[1:25:12] that didn't mean
[1:25:14] they didn't mean where you and i can say
[1:25:16] well i ain't praying for for any out
[1:25:18] there no when we're talking about he
[1:25:20] said i don't pray for the world he is
[1:25:22] what his prayer is going up is for the
[1:25:24] elect that would be scattered all the
[1:25:26] way down through that of the time
[1:25:29] and then you know and i don't know who's
[1:25:31] elect and who's not
[1:25:33] let me just say it to you like this even
[1:25:35] for a person that you and i come in
[1:25:37] contact with and you recognize there's
[1:25:40] no opening they're flying right where
[1:25:42] they're at
[1:25:44] i had lunch here back in the fall with
[1:25:47] an individual god allowed us to come
[1:25:49] back and reconnect one of my he was one
[1:25:50] of my coaches when i first started
[1:25:52] coaching in football one of the first
[1:25:54] years he was a pastor over here in
[1:25:55] illyria god allowed us to connect back
[1:25:58] up and brought it together now i don't
[1:25:59] know where it's at right now but i knew
[1:26:01] at that time when we sat down and we
[1:26:03] began to talk for lunch now i just put
[1:26:05] myself i'm not there to present a bunch
[1:26:07] of doctrine i'm not there to try to say
[1:26:10] glory to god i take this guy for lunch
[1:26:12] you know he wrote in my car he ain't
[1:26:14] getting out of here until i deliver
[1:26:15] every no i'm waiting on god
[1:26:18] because i only want to deliver if
[1:26:22] there's something that god presses on my
[1:26:24] heart for him i could see in just a
[1:26:26] little bit he wasn't he wasn't probing
[1:26:29] or looking around for more truth now i
[1:26:31] don't know where he's at right now now
[1:26:33] you say brother samuel what are you
[1:26:35] saying then i'm saying that prayer is
[1:26:38] because we don't know who's elect and
[1:26:40] who's not elect and i'll tell you this
[1:26:42] right now even if they're not elect or
[1:26:45] you think they're not elect i'm still
[1:26:47] going to pray for them
[1:26:51] pray that god open their eyes and get
[1:26:53] them out of those systems
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:26:56] that their eyes be really locked into
[1:26:58] what the sacrifice is because they can't
[1:27:00] trust in those cursed walls of jericho
[1:27:05] then walls are cursed god already
[1:27:07] brought them walls down
[1:27:09] and god announced in his word cursed be
[1:27:12] the man that'll raise that up again
[1:27:15] he'll build it he'll it'll cause him
[1:27:17] he'll build it in his firstborn there
[1:27:20] you know what it is it cuts off the
[1:27:22] supply line of god's grace and god's
[1:27:25] power so surely we ought to pray god
[1:27:27] turn their hearts from those cursed
[1:27:29] walls of jericho
[1:27:32] because if they see no further
[1:27:35] we're talking about praying now
[1:27:36] we're talking about praying
[1:27:38] because if they see no further well
[1:27:41] that's that's between them and god
[1:27:43] and god doesn't let you and i know hell
[1:27:45] brother samuel god let me know
[1:27:47] so-and-so's elect you're lying
[1:27:50] i just tell you right now
[1:27:52] whether you're here on the internet
[1:27:53] you're lying
[1:27:55] we we look at it we don't know who is
[1:27:58] but we're to stand here with a message
[1:28:00] and interceding with divine grace and
[1:28:03] praying with the anointing of redemption
[1:28:05] upon our life
[1:28:08] oh come on now
[1:28:10] hey abraham prayed for lot didn't make
[1:28:12] lot part of the bride
[1:28:16] right
[1:28:18] daniel prayed for enter in intercession
[1:28:20] for god's mercy but that answering of
[1:28:22] life the revealing of what was taking
[1:28:24] place with the image didn't make the
[1:28:26] rest of them
[1:28:27] come in
[1:28:29] they continued right on
[1:28:31] with their program
[1:28:33] but they still
[1:28:35] had life
[1:28:36] all right
[1:28:38] so here jesus in 17 john 17 20.
[1:28:42] notice as he's praying he says neither
[1:28:44] pray i for these alone
[1:28:46] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:28:47] me through
[1:28:49] their word
[1:28:51] how many knows we've got we got a gospel
[1:28:53] to carry
[1:28:54] amen that they all may be one
[1:28:59] as here's the oneness as thou father art
[1:29:01] in me
[1:29:02] i in thee that they also may be one in
[1:29:05] us that the world may believe that thou
[1:29:08] has sent me you know your life my life
[1:29:12] is a testimony
[1:29:14] that don't just point back to a
[1:29:15] historical event
[1:29:17] but brings it present that is still the
[1:29:19] i am that i am
[1:29:21] because my life is a trophy of the
[1:29:24] unmerited grace of god that's what your
[1:29:26] life is
[1:29:27] a trophy of the glory of god matter of
[1:29:30] fact your life in my life where christ
[1:29:33] himself has taken the uppermost seat
[1:29:35] within our life you realize there was a
[1:29:37] lot of other things exalted in our life
[1:29:38] at one time all sorts of things whether
[1:29:40] it was sports or whatever more a lot of
[1:29:42] things that were exalted of the world
[1:29:45] but when he came on the scene those
[1:29:47] things no longer have the influence and
[1:29:49] are exalted in our life it's jesus
[1:29:52] christ that's exalted in our life he's
[1:29:54] the one who's on display
[1:29:56] you say how's he to be on display he's
[1:29:58] on display in our life just like he will
[1:30:00] be
[1:30:01] in the new city
[1:30:02] where the lamb is the light
[1:30:05] is that right it gives light to all
[1:30:07] parts that's the same way the light of
[1:30:09] the holy ghost is in our life right now
[1:30:13] oh glory be to god
[1:30:15] notice and the glory which thou
[1:30:18] gavest me have i given
[1:30:21] them that they may be one even as
[1:30:23] we are one
[1:30:25] i in them vow in me
[1:30:27] that they may be made perfect in one
[1:30:30] that the world may know that thou has
[1:30:32] sent me and has to love me and as thou
[1:30:34] has loved them as thou has loved me
[1:30:37] but the random just takes it like this
[1:30:39] and things that ought to be just think
[1:30:40] of this here
[1:30:41] just for a few moments
[1:30:43] he says
[1:30:45] jesus only
[1:30:47] that he asked the father
[1:30:50] there in john 17
[1:30:52] he asked for this one thing
[1:30:54] that where i am
[1:30:57] they may be also
[1:30:59] he asked
[1:31:00] for our fellowship
[1:31:03] that's what he asked for
[1:31:05] that's the only thing he asked the
[1:31:06] father in prayer
[1:31:08] is your companionship forever
[1:31:12] he says oh then how much should we
[1:31:13] desire him
[1:31:15] he said if you really are born of the
[1:31:16] spirit of god that
[1:31:19] means everything to you
[1:31:22] it ain't some book of rules you don't
[1:31:24] live any laws and so forth you live by
[1:31:27] the grace of god
[1:31:29] the spirit of god
[1:31:32] he asked for our fellowship
[1:31:35] now you know with this right here
[1:31:38] since the garden of eden remember god
[1:31:42] provided
[1:31:44] a way that man
[1:31:46] had come back into fellowship with him
[1:31:48] under the shed blood of an innocent
[1:31:51] we see that with the it was all an
[1:31:52] antitype or a type that spoke of the
[1:31:54] antitype that was to come
[1:31:56] man could come under the shed blood of a
[1:31:59] of an innocent one
[1:32:01] and have fellowship with god
[1:32:03] but it was not the fellowship that they
[1:32:05] had back in eden
[1:32:07] it was not the fellowship that we would
[1:32:09] call perfect fellowship
[1:32:11] but perfect fellowship it would take god
[1:32:14] himself
[1:32:15] to come down
[1:32:17] and become the sacrifice
[1:32:20] you see what i'm saying that in order
[1:32:22] for there to be fellowship it requires
[1:32:24] sacrifice
[1:32:26] if i can just condescend just a little
[1:32:28] bit here it requires in order for
[1:32:30] fellowship to be in marriage it requires
[1:32:32] sacrifice
[1:32:34] it requires sacrifice and even when
[1:32:36] maybe you had words with one another of
[1:32:38] course i know nobody here in this church
[1:32:40] ever does that but let's just say for
[1:32:41] anybody who's on the internet or for
[1:32:43] anybody else who just would happen to
[1:32:45] somehow just stumble across this
[1:32:48] the only way that when those words you
[1:32:50] know when words come about between you
[1:32:52] and your spouse you don't feel right
[1:32:56] the rest of the evening don't feel right
[1:32:58] or the rest of the day
[1:33:02] lord
[1:33:03] don't fault them they think we're all
[1:33:04] here
[1:33:07] but somewhere along the line somebody
[1:33:10] has got to be redeemer
[1:33:13] are you with me and all it takes
[1:33:15] sometimes is one to be the redeemer well
[1:33:18] i didn't do it she needs to say
[1:33:20] something i didn't do it he needs to do
[1:33:22] it but you see god didn't do it we did
[1:33:24] it
[1:33:26] but he came down and became our redeemer
[1:33:30] and he manifested himself as the prophet
[1:33:33] said in this time as the redeemer
[1:33:36] anointed one
[1:33:40] that's the same way god comes to our
[1:33:42] lives and he'll bring conviction to our
[1:33:44] life he's not trying to run us down that
[1:33:47] is the anointing of redeemer that's
[1:33:50] dealing with our lives to bring us back
[1:33:52] into fellowship you say conviction hey
[1:33:55] listen you let words come between you
[1:33:57] and your wife or you know and somebody
[1:33:59] else and you begin to go and just let
[1:34:02] yourself down and say you know what i'm
[1:34:04] sorry i shouldn't have said that i'm
[1:34:06] sorry well brother samuel it ain't my
[1:34:08] fault if you go along that way there'll
[1:34:10] never be a restoration of fellowship
[1:34:14] you know what made god so big and so
[1:34:16] great he's able to make himself so small
[1:34:20] sometimes god will use situation where
[1:34:21] we're preaching now sometimes god will
[1:34:23] use situations that he's drawing
[1:34:26] humility out of our life
[1:34:29] to where that communication between
[1:34:31] husband and wife during your spouse
[1:34:34] means more to you than anything else
[1:34:37] means more than a hunting trip more than
[1:34:38] a fishing trip more than your buddies
[1:34:40] somewhere else it means more to you
[1:34:52] how did he redeem us well he didn't just
[1:34:54] come straight from the womb and go
[1:34:55] straight to the cross
[1:34:58] there's a little bit of suffering
[1:34:59] involved
[1:35:00] brother graham talked about not just
[1:35:02] between spouses he talked about even in
[1:35:04] a family when children aren't warm with
[1:35:06] their parents and parents one with their
[1:35:07] children what does that require the
[1:35:09] anointing of redemption
[1:35:11] well what does the anointing of
[1:35:13] redemption speak to relationship
[1:35:16] not laws come on
[1:35:18] that doesn't mean oh they just do
[1:35:20] whatever they want praise god we believe
[1:35:22] in predestination
[1:35:24] don't let me go there tonight
[1:35:26] that is not how predestination works at
[1:35:28] all that's not how the grace of god
[1:35:30] works at all the grace of god comes to
[1:35:33] correct us
[1:35:35] let us know where we're wrong and where
[1:35:37] we need to straighten up
[1:35:40] redemption works to move and heal the
[1:35:43] wound
[1:35:45] to bridge the gap
[1:35:48] to stand in the breach
[1:35:50] think of how the prophet at this hour
[1:35:52] what an example as he would stand there
[1:35:54] and he would see the churches walking
[1:35:56] before him and he saw that condition of
[1:35:58] all the church of america and all the
[1:35:59] rest of me said oh he said i bound my
[1:36:01] head in shame and said god is that the
[1:36:04] best that we can do for you
[1:36:06] i want you i want you to understand
[1:36:08] right now where the prophet is standing
[1:36:10] at he's standing right there in that
[1:36:12] time after the seals and so forth have
[1:36:14] been opened but as he stood right there
[1:36:17] notice he says now notice the bride will
[1:36:20] come in to preview again you think there
[1:36:22] was times he was discouraged he was
[1:36:24] discouraged he told us about a complex
[1:36:27] that had got a hold of him he talked
[1:36:29] about when he would go to preach to the
[1:36:31] people and they would tell their women
[1:36:33] put your hair up so he don't preach on
[1:36:35] it
[1:36:36] brother branham would stand and how can
[1:36:38] i overcome in the tabernacle and say i'm
[1:36:41] and he said i hear you out there saying
[1:36:43] brother branham i'm tired of hearing you
[1:36:44] preach on that he said well i'm tired of
[1:36:46] seeing you do it
[1:36:48] there had to be somebody that would
[1:36:50] stand in the gap with truth for you and
[1:36:53] i and let me tell you the bride itself
[1:36:56] is no longer a vision she is on earth
[1:37:00] now
[1:37:10] oh
[1:37:11] glory be to god in the highest
[1:37:15] how we can take such a lesson here
[1:37:18] how brother adam could tell us
[1:37:22] like the disciples said teach us how to
[1:37:24] pray
[1:37:26] now
[1:37:30] these were not ignorant fellows
[1:37:32] that didn't know how to pray
[1:37:36] but it's
[1:37:38] a request
[1:37:40] teach us how to pray
[1:37:42] see it's a restoring
[1:37:45] of those open channels
[1:37:48] remember
[1:37:49] many of these right here
[1:37:50] the disciples when they asked him that
[1:37:53] they had been raised
[1:37:55] in homes
[1:37:57] that believed in praying
[1:37:59] but you see there's a question that's
[1:38:01] deeper than just teach us how to pray as
[1:38:04] far as in our thinking do i get down on
[1:38:05] my knees do i fold my hands a certain
[1:38:07] way no
[1:38:09] it's asking
[1:38:12] what
[1:38:12] should we pray for
[1:38:16] and the only way you can know what to
[1:38:18] pray for
[1:38:19] is to be in contact with god
[1:38:24] and begin to pray for those things as
[1:38:26] brother branham would say
[1:38:28] god when we recognize and realize
[1:38:30] your presence and the god great god of
[1:38:32] heaven is among us
[1:38:34] we realize how insufficient we are
[1:38:37] you see sometimes let's just be honest
[1:38:39] all through this room
[1:38:40] sometimes we get too sufficient
[1:38:42] in ourselves
[1:38:44] that's a battle friends it's not it's
[1:38:46] not anything to condemn you but it's a
[1:38:48] battle
[1:38:49] but when you can recognize his presence
[1:38:51] among us then when we really recognize
[1:38:53] it we recognize just how insufficient we
[1:38:56] are
[1:38:58] that that we can't make things happen
[1:39:00] but
[1:39:01] we can invite him to teach us
[1:39:04] what we need to be asking him for
[1:39:08] because you see god the whole law of the
[1:39:09] kingdom god's desire is that we would
[1:39:12] ask
[1:39:13] ask that your joys might be full
[1:39:15] ask and he would say you have not
[1:39:17] because you
[1:39:18] ask not and the only way you can ask is
[1:39:21] you must ask in faith
[1:39:24] and let me tell you something faith
[1:39:25] itself
[1:39:27] brother bran would put it like this
[1:39:30] in god's provided way of fellowship
[1:39:33] god's provided approach to fellowship
[1:39:35] brother brown would pick that up and he
[1:39:36] said now it's not some great super duper
[1:39:38] sid supernatural faith you need
[1:39:41] and he takes us right into the waters of
[1:39:42] separation
[1:39:44] it was the ashes of the red heifer
[1:39:47] that was put
[1:39:48] there in that clean vessel
[1:39:50] with that of clean and pure water
[1:39:54] and they were to take hyssop
[1:39:57] and they were to sprinkle upon the
[1:39:59] worshiper as he would come near
[1:40:01] to draw into fellowship
[1:40:04] and that water is the waters of
[1:40:05] separation it's the preaching
[1:40:08] of the gospel
[1:40:10] and that hyssop
[1:40:12] brother brown would tell us over and
[1:40:13] over and over and over
[1:40:15] it's simple
[1:40:17] common
[1:40:18] faith
[1:40:20] so don't let the devil put it way out
[1:40:21] there well i've got a hat no
[1:40:23] god comes and he deals with what faith
[1:40:27] is already in your life
[1:40:30] is that right
[1:40:31] then god himself he's drawing i see our
[1:40:34] faith is now he's the one that's
[1:40:36] directing our faith
[1:40:37] and it's directed in him to come into a
[1:40:40] place
[1:40:41] of fellowship
[1:40:43] and relationship with him i i'm just
[1:40:45] gonna just pull up there tonight
[1:40:47] because i don't want to i don't want to
[1:40:49] push any further
[1:40:52] it's faith
[1:40:54] simple faith you see that's
[1:40:56] everything within our life
[1:40:59] every promise of god is based on faith
[1:41:03] you can't get anything the bible said a
[1:41:05] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:41:07] ways
[1:41:08] it said to ask without wavering
[1:41:12] so it's to have faith
[1:41:15] now to have faith is to know that you
[1:41:18] have met god's requirements
[1:41:20] whatever whatever the need or the
[1:41:23] situation is it requires faith
[1:41:26] you realize to receive the holy ghost it
[1:41:28] requires faith
[1:41:31] in order to receive it it requires faith
[1:41:34] satan will come just like upon that is
[1:41:37] the same way that he'll work and try to
[1:41:40] hinder a life and try to put things in
[1:41:43] there and try to try to in a manner so
[1:41:45] that things can remain
[1:41:47] between our life
[1:41:50] and god
[1:41:52] but that's not god's desire
[1:41:54] it requires
[1:41:56] faith
[1:41:57] but the only way that faith can come we
[1:41:59] know there's got to be repentance
[1:42:00] there's got to be confession is that
[1:42:02] right
[1:42:04] then you come into that place
[1:42:07] brother braham says how god bringing us
[1:42:09] into that place and we come into that
[1:42:11] spot
[1:42:12] he said and right there standing
[1:42:14] in that place
[1:42:16] of the inner court
[1:42:17] not the holiest of holies but the inner
[1:42:19] court
[1:42:20] he said here comes the holy spirit
[1:42:22] kissing away every fear
[1:42:25] every doubt
[1:42:27] but you see we can come in the kitchen
[1:42:30] and we can fellowship with everybody and
[1:42:31] eat the word
[1:42:32] but it's in the living room is
[1:42:35] where he puts his arms around us
[1:42:39] it's where he begins to move and
[1:42:41] what he's dealing with in our life is to
[1:42:43] get all the shame away from us
[1:42:47] that's his presence moving in that way
[1:42:50] to do what bringing about a yielding
[1:42:52] that we can fully enter
[1:42:54] into fellowship and into communion with
[1:42:57] him
[1:42:58] god made
[1:43:00] the way that we can enter into
[1:43:01] fellowship
[1:43:03] let me just say this
[1:43:05] just in this manner
[1:43:07] this is why that things it's just like
[1:43:12] that can be if there's something that's
[1:43:14] in our life and the holy spirit brings
[1:43:16] it to our attention
[1:43:17] make it right
[1:43:19] get it right
[1:43:21] and let's go on with
[1:43:22] god amen because the bible said if our
[1:43:25] heart condemn us
[1:43:27] god's greater than our heart
[1:43:29] see satan's desire and that's why when
[1:43:31] there's things we we i desire within our
[1:43:34] heart there's a longing we'll put that
[1:43:35] longing there god put that lonely there
[1:43:38] it's a longing for fellowship
[1:43:42] it's a desire what is it that's drawn
[1:43:44] with doing it it's love love demands
[1:43:48] fellowship
[1:43:51] now
[1:43:52] tonight as we've looked at that just a
[1:43:54] little bit god's desire for fellowship
[1:43:57] it's something that
[1:43:59] i believe that in our hearts and our
[1:44:00] lives i'm just going to say it in this
[1:44:02] way
[1:44:03] who wouldn't want that fellowship
[1:44:06] who wouldn't want that fellowship
[1:44:10] a man to enter on in into his presence
[1:44:14] to where his life comes in and that
[1:44:16] channel is open and there's a
[1:44:17] transformation there on the inside who
[1:44:19] wouldn't want that fellowship
[1:44:22] you see in that place to where
[1:44:23] everything is gone between you and him
[1:44:27] there's nothing you and not only has
[1:44:29] everything been repented of but he he
[1:44:31] has dealt with every fear with every
[1:44:33] doubt
[1:44:35] to where you can stand there in his
[1:44:37] presence
[1:44:39] and he comes
[1:44:41] to do
[1:44:42] what only he can do
[1:44:44] you see that's what real prayer is
[1:44:45] prayer
[1:44:46] is fellowship with god
[1:44:49] prayer is not it's not
[1:44:51] a religious right
[1:44:53] but prayer is communion
[1:44:55] where the channel's really been opened
[1:44:57] back up
[1:44:58] between us
[1:45:00] and god
[1:45:02] and it's a privilege that we have
[1:45:05] to enter in
[1:45:06] to his presence
[1:45:09] that's where real joy is
[1:45:11] that's where strength is friends
[1:45:13] that's where we find that
[1:45:15] all the worries that we can have
[1:45:18] things that we can hear
[1:45:20] and look
[1:45:21] things we can hear and if you allow them
[1:45:23] to to drop in
[1:45:26] it can trouble you
[1:45:29] but if you'll take
[1:45:30] and cast your cares on him
[1:45:33] if you'll take the things that are the
[1:45:35] uncertainties and begin to go to him in
[1:45:37] prayer
[1:45:38] and say god i know with you all things
[1:45:42] are certain
[1:45:44] there is no unsteadiness there is no
[1:45:46] variableness with you lord everything is
[1:45:49] certain now lord jesus i lay all of this
[1:45:52] rumors or things you know ideas
[1:45:54] sometimes you you can hear things on the
[1:45:55] job and well they're getting ready to
[1:45:57] cut this many people or they're getting
[1:45:58] ready to do this and they're getting
[1:45:59] ready to do this
[1:46:00] and all those things can come about and
[1:46:02] not saying that those aren't things that
[1:46:04] couldn't cause worry
[1:46:05] we've got a place that we can come to
[1:46:08] and having fellowship with him that he
[1:46:11] will give us a strength and a fortitude
[1:46:14] to where worry
[1:46:15] does not dominate our life
[1:46:19] but where the love of god and the joy of
[1:46:20] the lord
[1:46:22] overshadows
[1:46:24] our lives
[1:46:26] let's pray
[1:46:28] heavenly father
[1:46:31] lord
[1:46:33] as once again lord as we come
[1:46:36] to you lord

[1:49:54] a lord it's an attitude
[1:49:57] the god that we've allowed to come upon

[1:50:14] make these things known to our lives

[1:51:10] lord jesus
[1:51:13] we love you lord
[1:51:16] oh in the precious name of the lord
[1:51:18] jesus christ
[1:51:21] you know as we looked at that earlier
[1:51:23] if you'd like to stand with me
[1:51:26] about eating in our diet
[1:51:31] we've not been fed a diet of fear we've
[1:51:34] not been fed a diet of doubt
[1:51:36] we've not been fed a diet of compromise
[1:51:41] but this word that god would come and
[1:51:43] minister to us
[1:51:45] has
[1:51:46] come build faith
[1:51:50] to let us know that think of it
[1:51:52] that everything in the world was stacked
[1:51:55] against us
[1:51:57] there's no way that we could get back to
[1:51:59] god
[1:52:01] no way
[1:52:04] but god
[1:52:06] came down
[1:52:07] to where we were
[1:52:11] i don't know what that does for you but
[1:52:12] that just
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:14] it just does something for me
[1:52:16] that god will come right to where
[1:52:19] we're at
[1:52:20] sometimes we don't know how to how do i
[1:52:22] get out of this dryness how do i get out
[1:52:24] of this staleness how do i get out of
[1:52:25] this but when you begin to call out like
[1:52:28] that lord god help me like peter
[1:52:31] help me lord he'll draw now his presence
[1:52:35] is drawing nigh you know why because
[1:52:37] you're drawing nigh
[1:52:39] unto him
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] and he'll come down and he'll show us
[1:52:45] the way out of that
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:48] oh he don't just come and give us a
[1:52:50] lesson
[1:52:51] he'll come and speak to us
[1:52:53] with his presence
[1:52:55] you know what that does brother william
[1:52:56] his presence coming it gives us
[1:52:58] encouragement
[1:53:00] the shannon encourages us
[1:53:03] the dracula gives us courage to stand
[1:53:05] there because we know if god be for us
[1:53:09] who can be against us i'll not allow
[1:53:13] this thought to buy me
[1:53:15] but god is for me
[1:53:18] god is speaking to me god is leading me
[1:53:22] oh my what's doing that his
[1:53:24] love his desire for fellowship
[1:53:30] oh i know sometimes it's hard in our
[1:53:33] minds our hearts it's hard to comprehend
[1:53:35] it
