pray and ask his Blessing in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you so much for your mercy and your grace Lord Lord we can never never get over lord what you have done and what you're doing in our lives Lord many times we as we look back over the course of our time and our lives sometimes Lord we we're unaware of just exactly what you're doing but it's when we can look back and we're not looking back to the world but you would tell Israel in the book of Deuteronomy remember the Lord that brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt remember the Lord that have kept you all these days you would have them Lord to make Memorials of things that you did in their lives Lord in the landscape of Our Lives spiritually there's many memorials Lord there's been many times that Lord that we didn't know how we were going to make it through before us was a Red Sea before us was a Jordan before us was a Jericho yes but you made a way Hallelujah you've made a way so Lord here this morning we once again are are looking to you you are our way maker Lord we don't want our own way cuz our own way it's always wrong we want your way Lord yes Lord we want to walk in your way I pray that God you would so condition every heart every one of us Lord just to be able to receive the things that you desire to say to us this morning Lord as we go about the cares of this life we lord we we toil and we come through many things and Lord sometimes even as we come to the house of the Lord this is one of the Lord few places we find of [Music] peace now Lord we're asking in the midst of this moment may every part of our being be yielded to the great Prince of Peace and Lord we pray and ask that you would deposit Lord in our lives just exactly what is needed Lord in these moments and help us Lord to be able to grasp those things Lord we just ask you just move Among Us in a special way we love you father and we thank you thank you bless your children now Lord oh God watch over those Lord as even on the roads and traveling home I'm asking that God father that you would just just drive back the weather Lord until Lord God that even that we lord everyone had arrive to their destination safely Lord we pray we love you and we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you amen amen if you could would you turn in your Bibles with me to Ruth chapter 2 God bless you it's good to have you too sir good to have you Brian Brian just this just just a tad just thank you uh Ruth chapter 2 verse one of Ruth chapter two I won't keep you standing I'll just let me read a couple verses and then we'll let you be seated Ruth chapter 2 and verse one and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of IMC and his name was Boaz prise the Lord and Ruth the moabitas said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and it makes may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated ask you to forgive me last week I realized I didn't even give you the title after we had got done spoken speaking but I know you can always see it in the corner of the screen but just a thought that actually struck my heart and I had no you know you don't know how the Lord's going to take you and you just want to be mindful of that um when we looked at just the thought when it had struck my heart I thought well we'll just the thought will just drop in one service and we'll be going on and uh if that's what the Lord had had and then we seen last week how the Lord just took the service and I just always want him to take it the only thing I want to only thing I want is just Lord help me to get out of the way amen and just have let him take it because he knows what we have need of and uh you know surprises sometimes can uh can can get us you know but uh those are good surprises uh how the Lord just moves in such a way and uh so when we look at this here uh you know in the scripture I want to just really focus in on that once again on the value of obedience because many times the the way that remember Paul would address it to the Corinthian Church of how that uh that Satan had wanted to corrupt the Simplicity that is in Christ Christ and the the enemy is in in many ways there's ways if he cannot push you one way he'll try to push you another way if he can't make you to a place to where you say Ah that's not necessary then he would like to put you to a place to where you could go off to one extreme and then at the same time if if the enemy sees that well you know you're you're not going to get you're not getting rid of him he what he'll try to do is is in one way try to bring confusion in your mind but I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit God is mindful to lead us as his children he's a Shepherd that is one of the attributes of God that is made manifest and a goat cannot be shephered but a but a sheep can and when David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want and we are depending on his leadership and this is where that when we can see this with Ruth that as she stands here in this moment and I want to just really hone in on a part of this in the scriptures this morning how the Lord will take us on staying and serving and that's really just what's been really resonating on my heart for some time here we look here in in this of the scripture that Ruth herself in in returning back with Naomi and here she moves into the field to begin to glean ears of corn and realize that this was you know Naomi's husband had passed away and so had uh Ruth and uh orphas and we've seen orpa did not return the least little discouragement orpa just went on her way but Ruth had had made a decision and it was a clearcut decision it was a decision that I'm going all the way where you Lodge that's where I'm going to Lodge your God shall be my God and there's nothing going to separate me from this except let it be if there's anything at all let it just be that of death if anything anything other than that she was determined and you know let me just say it like this the only way that even as a person that you can even be determined like that is God has spoke to your heart oh yeah Ruth herself being a moabit she she did not even have a promise in the land of Israel but there was something as we were looking looking at that last week that she was being moved by the spirit of God and she couldn't explain it she didn't know exactly why but she was yielding to the spirit of God that was dealing with her life perhaps even Ruth was not even fully aware of all that was being said or spoken from her lips but she was speaking from her heart I want to just read this here once again as you know the prophet would say it like this in the Redeemer and Redemption and I I think we were ending with this last week and he said Ruth was willing to forsake her Idols forsake her past life forsake her people forsake everything and return with Naomi no matter what the circumstances was she was willing to go on that's all that God asks for is willingness there's no greater thing that we can give to God than a heart that is willing and you know it takes God it takes the spirit of God to make and bring about our heart to a place of willingness it's God it's his work it's not it's not man's work it's not it's not our doing it is salvation the Bible says very clearly salvation is of the Lord if we're here today and you have a desire to serve God you're a blessed people and I just say it like this if if if you have that desire don't just keep it but be like the little lad who had a lunch all that lunch could have done is fed him that day but when he surrendered it to the Master's Hand then it fed a 5,000 and that's not even including women and children they weren't even listed in that but afterwards the Bible said there was 12 baskets full and 12 represents worship so not only can he take from your life and take that desire he put that desire in you and the God himself is the one to satisfy that desire and with that he will prove himself to be more than enough more than you could have ever imagined he'll prove to be sufficient for every problem for every situation for anything that can ever arise in your life he is more than enough that's so good and when it's all said done it's a life of worship now watch brother B says now the way every man that comes to Christ must first be willing regardless he says I never like to tell the people oh you're going to prosper and be a rich man now that sounds like a Texas religion you know what I'm talking about and God's going to bless you you ain't going to have no sickness I don't promise him that because God don't promise him that the Bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous but let me finish it but the Lord deliver them out of them all is that right in the Book of John chapter 16 he said to his disciples before going to his crucifixion he said in this world you shall have much uh trial tribulation and persecution but in me you shall have peace and be of good sure for I have overcome the world H Hallelujah I don't promise him that because God don't promise that I say if you're really born again in your heart I don't care how rough the road gets you'll still hold on to God's unchanging hand no matter what lays before you if Jesus goes with me I'll go amen long as he goes that's all that's necessary verse three of room of Ruth chapter 2 and she went now I want you to notice this she is moving under the direction of Naomi there there is a need when they come back in the land they have no sustenance but they're in the land or their return back to the land is not only because EMC Naomi's husband has passed Ruth's husband has passed orphan's husband has passed but in the passing then the word comes that there is bread in Israel it's barley season so that in itself how you know listen friends God God's not entrusting you and I to try to arrange everything and make everything fit but God brings every piece and part together in his own time in his own way God will cause every part to come together just exactly at the right time he's not too late he's not going to be too early he's always right on time sometimes we think he's too late or or we're wondering where he's at but remember when he came to raise Lazarus he was right on time when you begin to sense that of where you sense an anxiousness remember that's not of God that is exactly like what brother Brian was ministering there the other time that's only the enemy trying to disturb you there's an oncoming visitation Hallelujah let's stand right there sit right there at that tent door and look for him wait for him he's coming when pressure arises listen that's only Satan trying to distract you and get you away from the real promise let me tell you something Satan will do everything in his power to try to distract you when I drive down the road my wife has to tell me especially when it's well it doesn't matter if it's deer season or not she'll just have to remind me honey honey eyes on the road I look over and say there's something moving in that Woods over oh my look at that field over there my look at that body on that deer honey honey honey honey eyes on the road I said just my peripheral honey just my peripheral but you you know and I know just like when we have the things what they call the no texting laws which everybody pays attention to we've seen the video I remember when the young people years ago showed me videos uh I think maybe even eight years ago just people that were texting and then here they were driving a big SUV and it just it's just in dust after because they were texting and they crossed the median it only takes one moment of distraction and Satan knows that in our life spiritually listen let me just say let me just be very honest he knows certain things that'll push your buttons and pull your strings and let me just say this the buttons and the strings are not righteous they're not of God they come along from that first birth but Satan his objective is to try to distract us from what we need to be focused on that ought to tell you one thing that Satan is afraid of you getting a hold of the word and the word getting a hold of your life yes sir that's right I'm telling you doomed devils are on the Run Satan is nervous let's just keep him nervous notice the Bible says she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers she's instructed by Naomi here she is she's going out into the field listen they just didn't come into Israel and then they're just uh you know sitting in their house and saying well you know if it's if it's God's will to you know Lord I you just you just drop whatever I need Lord you just but she had notice she's going out in obedience to the word that God had given even throughout the Old Testament Ruth being a type of the Gentile bride she goes out together she's going out to glean and and she's going she's going to have to glean after those of the Reapers and even after the maidens that will bind that of the uh of the barley and of the Harvest and she will have to go and glean that and beat it out and so forth but notice the Bible says and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto baz who was of the Kindred of AMC I wish I had a lot of time to speak on just these two words her haap because her haap this is not a chance it says her ha this means her lot she wasn't aware listen she made her decision but you see the value of simple obedience God will Direct you in the pathway of his Blessing God this wasn't it wasn't something that just you know just fly by night she's going according to the word she's going out to glean and God sees to it to guide her to this part of the field why did she choose this part of the field that belonged to baz she didn't know it belonged to Boaz she didn't know that let me just say this to you this is all the field of God's promise this is this this is God's field it's fied with promises but who is it that guided you to the point of the field in this hour where the promise of God was to be made manifest not a promise of 2,000 years ago not a promise of even 50 years ago but a promise for right now because the Bible said I'm God and I change not and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever a living God a living reality you're not here by chance you're here by Design right in the field of God's choosing God knows exactly that's why nowhere to go but the Holy Spirit has come and led us into the promises for this hour the same go God that leads us in the promise of this hour lead you through all of your future he'll lead you through every aspect of your life cuz he's he's concerned about everything he's a God that he said you seek me seek me first seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things the whole of life is consumed or encompassed in all these other things shall be added to you praise Boaz the Bible said in verse four came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you oh I love that and where did Boaz come from Bethlehem the house of God's bread and he says notice his announcement as he descends the Lord be with you all right that's good and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant notice he comes to one specific for the age and baz said unto his servant that was s over the Reapers is that right in the right hand of God the Bible says in the Book of Revelations are seven stars and the Seven Stars Are The Messengers to the seven Church ages right each one of those ages is was God dealing with a gentile the Bible said we're living until the fullness of time be fulfilled the fullness of times is God working and calling out a gentile bride where the Jews rejected it they listen it was prophesied they would be blinded but if they hadn't been blinded come on we're in the Book of Romans if God had not blinded them you and I would not have had a chance that's right but God God he blinded them that he might want what was laying in the scripture all through the Old Testament that I will take a PE I will SW unto me a people for my name's sake and God would take a people unto himself like Joseph took a gentile bride Ruth is a gentile it's speaking of this hour that's why this book Even This Book of Ruth is not just a small little book but the Book of Ruth in his hand was a little book open four chapters four Earthly Deliverance four is messengers of life where Satan has taken life from the church four Messengers restored to its original Glory Hallelujah the four anointings of the lion stepping forth that Ezekiel Saw Isaiah saw John saw here stands the lion here stands the ox here stands the man here stands this the the the Eagle what is it the same spirit of God moving through the characteristics in his in his hand a little book open and he descended who did he give this little book to he revealed it he tore off the seals and sent it down to his seventh angel Messenger on Earth sometimes I like to we just have to Coast was he lets us Coast in some of those things I I don't want to just say I want to make sure that we're all together my don't you love the Lord listen friends the Bible the Bible is is not just a book it's a history and it's a book of Prophecy it's a living reality of Jesus Christ all the way through Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new he's never changed never lost his power and any man or any church that says anything different is because they don't know him you must know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering verse six and the servant that was sent over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi is damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab and she said this is what Ruth had asked of them I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep let me just say this if you want something from God you're going to have to go get it and the way you go get it is with a willing heart amen is with a determination in your heart if you say well I'll just uh you know I'll just see if the Holy Ghost will come brother Bram says you might as well just stay in your seat you don't approach God that way you might say brother Samuel how could that well I you know I can't help I am listen revisit in your walk with God if you've got to a place in your walk with God where there are things that just seems kind of like halfhazard and and you know Cas sah sah listen you're not dwelling where you need to be dwelling because let me let me say this the world ain't going to give you Faith there's only one source of faith and that's from the word of God the Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God the Bible also said in the days in this day that there would be a famine in the land and the famine would not be for bread and water but for the hearing of the word of God listen there are churches everywhere up and down but let me tell you something not all of it is the word of the Lord the word of the Lord is the spirit of God inspiring his word for this season for this moment for this hour getting a church ready let me tell you something you know how it is when you're not feeding if you're not feeding and you start to get hungry what happens to you well let me ask your wife what happens to you let me ask your family what happens to you let me see if it's 12:00 black bear 1:00 grizzly bear 2:00 [Laughter] come on friends that's true true man a Christian walk is not just something that's just well you know this is just it's just going to happen no we have a responsibility to go into the field and glean that's why the prophet could say pray for Revelation I wonder if we would weigh our prayers out how many times we're praying about so many other things Lord bless me here Lord help me on the job and God's concerned about all those things but how many times are we really praying about the things that are of the greatest value because let me tell you something Revelation from the Throne of God will stabilize you it'll give you a vision and an insight and a direction for the things you face in this life it'll stabilize you and it'll bring a reflection from the king of glory into your life so she came and she hath continued from the morning until now that she carried a little in the house she was she was gleaning I many remember that that's not just a memory I remember when God first got a hold of my life Brother Sam did you understand I didn't understand everything all I know is I just kept playing the message I kept reading and I'm just going to be honest with you I I don't care what you think of me I you know sometimes I could get lost in the Book of Leviticus and numbers I don't now but I went to the New Testament I'm not going to be held back from the promises I can read through that or read through the Psalms read through the Proverbs listen let me tell you something don't get caught up with trying to figure things out in your mind just go out there and [Applause] [Music] glean just glean Hallelujah very very simple things go out and glean you got to glean for for what you you have need of let me tell you something when God promised to to supply Mana to Israel he didn't have them open up a chute in their tent and say I'll drop it right in your tent he had it fall on the ground he tested their obedience their willingness their love their favor by would they get out of their tent and go gather Mana are you hearing me he's the same God today where are we going to go and gather it things that sometimes seem to be a little Beyond us and if it's a little Beyond us well you know I'm just going to you know it's got to be God's will and I don't want to get ahead of God no you got to lay hold everything you get in god you're going to have to fight for it don't let the spirit of this age get on you where everything is dropped and things are dropped in your mailbox and you don't have to go to work and you don't have to do nothing and we'll give you a phone and don't get under that spirit it's a spirit of entitlement we are not of the spirit of entitlement listen the Bible said the kingdom of God it's suffereth violence but the violence take it by force if you want to serve God it'll be a fight but it's a fight worth fighting Hallelujah anything you want out of God you're going to have to fight your way you'll have to fight beyond your will you'll have to fight beyond your thoughts but it's worth it I said it's worth [Applause] it how the kinsman redeemer Ruth in her heart in her heart forgive me my words get confused I'm just a little weary but Ruth in her heart not knowing where she was going but a type of the church we sojourn like pil like Abraham pilgrims in a Strange Land among strange people now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but I think everybody can Witness when God opens doors in our lives sometimes we almost look at it it seems like that seems almost too easy it seems like well Brother Sam what you just got done saying we're going to have to press our pressing is beyond our own will to look to him that I I'm I'm going to keep looking I don't care I might have stumbled but I'm getting back up and I'm looking because he who made the promise is fa faithful that's what that's what the prophet said Abraham was not so much looking at the promise but who made it because if you can get a glimpse of who made the promise that's what makes the promise real it lifts it from just a man's word cuz a man's word won't act like that but sometimes you come into things and you wonder man this door's open shouldn't I have a lot of opposition shouldn't I have this shouldn't I have this shouldn't I have that let me tell you something when you're walking in step with God the Bible said when a man's ways please the Lord right he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him think about when when Peter walked Walked Out they were down there praying and when Peter in the in that solitary confinement the angel of the Lord went down there the rest of the guards are asleep and he goes down there and he loosens the hold upon him let me tell you something the angel of the Lord can bind every spirit in a spirit that's troubling you that says you can't go free that you're not a son and daughter of God the angel of the Lord can bind him up and loosen you amen he specializes in that there's never my I'm going to preach there's nobody that has ever been able to beat the reconnaissance missions of the Angel of the Lord he knows right where he where his church is he knows right where his children are I don't care if the arrows are the thickest and the bullets are flying there is nothing that can keep the Lord Jesus away from his children there were walls all around Jericho and Rahab couldn't get out so God brought the walls down you might be walled up with unbelief there might be all sort of thoughts around your life right now but let the presence of God go to work and that which is standing between you and full Victory watch him bring it down to your [Applause] feet I'm going I'm just going to tell this little testimony you might not think it's much but for me you know everyone while you got to switch out smartphones right so you know I kind of I'm be honest you can call me cheap or whatever you want to but for me I like when they give me the deal if you just trade it in it's going to be $3 a month I want my iPhone cuz that's the ones that work that was for brother [Laughter] Shane but listen I did that back in back in September when I got that thing and I was waiting on them to come in they called me I said okay ready to set up the phones Mr Brown all right all right okay I'll be in so we went in there and had to go in at different times for to set that up and you know what on mine and here I am I'm the account holder I wasn't getting Credit Now I check my bills I I check I'm an ID toiz T of kind of guy I'm the kind of guy that's a spreadsheet guy man I looked on their brother Ray and I said they ain't giving me credit October called them we're getting it taken care of we're getting it taken care of September oh no not that September Comes for October don't November I called him in November we're getting taken care of nice young man over there at the store I really like that young man and we're I'm getting to taken care of and I know I know he tried he stayed in contact with me they tried I was on the phone one time an hour and a half I finally had to tell the guy look man I I got to go I got to go I I got to go I I'm I'm going I'm going I'm going to the office I don't want I'm I'm going then I called in December talking to him in December matter of fact I don't know if I went in or not but over we getting taken care of January I finally went in over there when I went in in January finally they got it straightened out I was getting credit but then they charged me a$ 13535 adjustment fee nope wow nope nope what' you do I was standing there like the like the the widow woman on the judge's doorstep knocking so here I am I go I you know so finally here it comes up you know I paid my Bill minus $135 then I get this text you know the other day hey there's going to be a late oh man now I got to well I got to go take take care of this so I thought let me just try to call him you know I was want to go into the store let me try to call him and and so I went in I I I I called him I got a gentleman on that phone man the nicest ni and no I mean really nice not because what he did but he was really nice he got on there and he said Mr Brownie he said let me call you back he said in 30 minutes he said I will call you right back he said what I'll do is he said let me get all this resolved he said cuz because you are not going to have to pay that fee I see what's going on so I thought well Lord I'm just trusting you and sure enough he calls me back he said not only are we taking it off we're Expediting it he said but let me see here he said you've been with our company for over 20 years he said you know what you deserve a loyalty discount now I want you to think how many months some of you right now are taking notes Ain you ain't got nothing outside of church you thinking loyalty discount hey you get loyalty discounts with the Lord you get special privileges that right the Bible said forget not all his benefits I'm the Lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases forget not my benefits what a blessing I said I told my wife I said honey after all this is right here I said my bills I said it's back to where it was I said before we did anything I know I wasn't very spiritual but my point is what I'm trying to tell you is that sometimes how God is leading things and sometimes we come into things and we wonder and we look at it and we think this seems too easy let me tell you something from your heart there's a willingness to press on God opens doors for his children God makes a way just like with Ruth it wasn't just happen stance she was directed by the spirit of God to that portion of the field my now let let me can I I read on here just a little bit brother BR say she went in the second paragraph on she went and finally she came into the room in the place where Naomi was bringing her and what did she find everybody patting her on the back and saying Ruth we're glad glad to have you down here nope she found Discord she found something evil she found trouble right and preachers that'll tell you the Christian Life is a flowery bed of ease he is either deceiving you or he's never accepted that experience himself the world hates you and the people will hate you but let me just tell you it isn't you really they hate it's because what's on the inside of you are you hearing me it's what's on the inside of you so don't take it personal God allows those things to mold our character oh he says the people will hate you I many place of scripture we can go but I'm just going to stay with it you got to take the way of the Lord's despise few and be laughed at made fun of or anything else you've got to be different you're born of another Nation he said you know my wife Wasing talking about what you know why don't the Christian women wear these clothes like the other women do we're all Americans aren't we I said no sir well what are we I said we're neither Germans French Belgium Swiss African or Americans or none of them but what are we we're Christians American acts like American German acts like a German because that's their National spirit and we have a national Spirit that's the holy Spirit coming from God out of heaven and you act like that it makes you conduct yourself as they do up there because you are of another world you're only reflecting the world you're going to there ain't no world going back in to that world this is why listen friends you can look for many different evidences and this and that but let me just tell you if the you still love the world or the things of the world the Fashions of the world and the world itself then the love of God has never entered into your heart that is where your evidence rests doesn't matter if you could speak in tongues you could run the eyes you could quote like a Gatlin gun but if you still love the world you've not yet arrived and remember Deus forsook Paul having loved this present world but Deus didn't go back out into bars and saloons and everything else he didn't want to go according to God's revealed way for the hour that's are you hearing me we're living in America that's true that's the body part but the soul that conducts us our character is from above we live from above because we're born from above all Christians come from above and Jesus said I am not from below I'm from above if I was from below my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is of above so every man that's born of the kingdom of God is from above now watch he says that we find them coming into a disappointment talking about Ruth and Naomi remember when Naomi came back she they said oh Naomi she said don't call me Naomi call me Mara because it has brought about a bitterness a sorrow that she's returned she's lost her husband said isn't that where you come into when you got the Holy Ghost you sure did making fun of and everything life was hard for him that's what the Bible said that you know once you be uh became a part of of the way that God walking in the way of God you watch every devil Out of Hell turn his gun you watch how things will rise up listen as soon as you begin to make a step for God and things listen expect the enemy is going to rise up but remember he's only doing that to try to get you distracted and let me just tell you this it ain't your boss it ain't your brother it ain't your sister if you allow yourself to be distracted that's on you amen come on friends we got to take things down to personal we got to get out of that first nature of always passing the buck my problems on me on my my problems or somebody else's problem if somebody else then if there is such a rule upon your life that you can't live in Victory that way then you need to ask God put a victory in the Gable into my soul that no matter what goes along the love of God will burn through my heart and I'm not going to blame nobody else but recognize it's a test it's a trial it's a temptation but I'm going on with the Lord Jesus cuz let me tell you when you stand there that day there ain't going going to be no blame games work brother Samuel that's rough you want me to tell you the truth now don't you you don't want me to want to deceiver standing here in front of you you want somebody that really loves you that'll tell you the truth you don't want these so-called friends that get around and you make a post on Facebook and they just join in like a pack of wolves to strip somebody down you want to have real friends the Bible said faithful are the wounds of a true friend that means somebody that'll tell you the truth and where you're lacking in your life and don't go that way don't head that way what that's a real friend but a friend that's always patting you on the back the Bible said kisses are deceitful that's good come on friends we're living in a day and an hour they we have more kissing preachers than everything some of the biggest sissies in the pull pit and people are being being kissed their way to hell that's the truth friends it's a sad reality there's hearts that are longing for God let me to tell you something every heart that's longing for God God knows where to find them God will not leave them in that mess let me just say it like this lives don't want to preach the message God will deliver Hearts this message was meant to be preached in its power and its glory and bring people under the influence of the absolute of this hour Hallelujah God don't need men picking it this way and picking it this way and picking it this way preach it yes sir life was hard for her it's hard after you become a Christian I don't know how many times I had people that wrote me after God got a hold of my life even on the Antiquated email that we had back then it was on a screen that wasn't color it was black and had orange letters on it I don't think the dinosaurs delivered it either but I had people that contacted me from maretta where how did they get my email right how did they get my email after God had got a hold of my life but they contacted me hey hey we heard that something happened to you how I don't know I don't know you see it wasn't I know right now for the young people it's kind of hard because one little thing right now goes around the world it wasn't so then I don't know how I don't know who those people were even contacted to they were not contacted to any of my friends or anybody that I knew back home how did they know that I don't know I don't know just like when I'm standing there working in pennies and selling suits and I had different ones come right around me on a Friday night Browning how's it going you I understand you don't you know go out and move around in certain areas no more picking snickering and laughing you think there wasn't some sort of like where that tingling feeling would want to move over you but there was something that was deeper and I could stand there and tell him I said the only thing I can tell you is is I met him amen I didn't know a lot of scripture I didn't know a lot of scripture but the only thing I told him is I met him I wasn't brainwashed at a church camp that's the word that was going around in sesy I'm off my notes but we're going to go with this Lord they said he's brainwashed his mom and daddy sent him away to a church camp they did that already there was a couple times but you know what it only lasted so long until there came a real meeting with God let me tell you I thank God for every time that I had at a church camp don't you ever as a young person as a middleaged don't you ever discount any experience you've had with God never it was not a failure it was God letting you know he's God when God met Jacob at bethl the first time he didn't change him but Jacob knew what my daddy talked about he's real and when that God spoke to him and situations changeed and laban's count countenance change and God said get thee back to bethl right right he knew where to come back to so the experiences you've had are not failures you need to throw that to the ground this morning except God's go Brother Sam I've been to camp after Camp banquet after banquet I've been here I've been there but don't let it was not a failure every experience if you let it it's God molding you and tendering you but don't stop gleaning amen when God does something for you glean glean oh watch this life was hard it was hard after you become a Christian because you got to adjust yourself from one life of gity and pleasures of the world to another life of consecration to God you've got to readjust yourself over into this side is't that incredible words you've got to adjust yourself you adjust yourself there's things that you begin to do because it's the right thing to do there's a willingness you may not all to see altogether see the value of it you may not see altogether the value but when you take God at his word there is a value in obedience just like when you're planting that seed The Field's being dissed up and the seed is being planted you don't altogether see the full value of it until the crop comes up and then every bit of Labor has been worth it and you have to readjust or adjust yourself to those things that are coming on you know this is why when the spirit of God is dealing with our hearts and lives and we're asking God well I I need the Lord to take this I need the Lord to take this like the prophet tells us in marriage of the Lamb the Bible says that this this bride in Revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride hath made herself ready is that right brother B said many people say oh if God only take this evil spirit from me if he only take this gambling if he only take this drinking if he only take this of the Fashions of the world if he'll just take it away he said no you've got something to do you see simple obedience by simply saying Lord I'm going to take you at your word and lay it there before God and watch the fire of God come down and consume those Desires in your life Hey listen I'm not preaching something I'm reading off the back of a cereal box I'm preaching it by experience right Ruth had to adjust herself from being in a land where plenty to eat everything respected to a people that was laughing making fun of her into a land she gleaned in the field for what she eat verse eight of Ruth 2 let me try to come down here Ben said Boaz unto Ruth now he approaches her now he's asked who is she right he's informed this is who she is now watch his approach his approach was first of all to the chief Reaper that was over the servants then the commun then it was communicated to him of who this is then he himself makes his approach personally to her isn't that how God has done your life God has sent the message and the message has brought a personal approach between you and the Lord Jesus to where he have him clipped up behind somebody else or in front of a great group of men and you've got to come through us to get to God that ain't how God said it up not at all God never elevated man but and by by through the shed blood man has been brought into a place to have direct contact and fellowship and communion with God absolutely there is no mediator between God and man but the man ch Christ Jesus you don't have listen if you you could tell your sins to me it won't do you no no good it won't do you bit of good but if you confess your sins to the Lord Jesus he's the one that can take care of the problems in your life he's the one that'll free you no man can do that only he can let me try to finish here or pause Ben said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter look at this term of endearment my daughter God uses terms of of endearment and infection hearest thou my daughter you see God has a way of speaking his his first approach to you and I is is calm us so good is to speak to us that's so good he's letting her know what what he thinks about her go not now watch this go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by thy midence don't go nowhere else stay right here amen this is the right place stay right here stay abide here now her abiding here was not just something where she was just to stand around and you know she just stands there no she's to follow right in this field after the maidens right as are going after the Reapers he's giving her Direction in his word stay right here in this field let me move on here just a little bit Hallelujah stay right here brother BR says in in in here in uh in the message uh the kinsman redeemer he says don't start Mission trotting paragraph 134 don't go to these other fields I like that don't start Mission trotting stay right here in my field stay with mine he loved her he said stay here stay with me don't go running around from place to place stay here if you believe the message hang on to it matter what the price is stay with it go right on if it means sacrifice this that or the other and I have to quit my drinking I have to quit my steal and lineing I'm going to stay right with it let me just tell you something it won't be you quitting it it'll be you surrendering it it'll be God coming down and taking every desire of the world out of your life Brianna move down to Ruth let's skip let's go move down the Ruth chapter 2:9 let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap so now he's he's telling her this is how you abide let your eyes stay on the field you're in this field now keep your eyes on the field that they're reaping in if they're going down this row keep your eyes on them don't don't get your eyes off of them when they go make that turn you go up and make that turn with them they come down here you go up and make that turn with them you you keep your eyes on them because they have orders from me so when you're actually as Paul said follow me as I follow Christ so this is how we're to abide or to stay in this field it's not just something where we just come well praise the Lord I I I'm here in the field no no when we've come into the field here he comes to us and we want to follow his leading and go Thou after them have not I charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn what a privilege let me just let me close here on this on this quote here right here this morning Lord will will pick it up brother says notice here Bri it's out the message Redeemer Redemption he said notice he said when he went over there to her he said now look don't you leave this field I wish we had time to park there for a few minutes don't you leave this field that's the way it is stay put oh he says I I know I'm just just a little wild but he says look stay where you are every man that's born of the spirit of God when he set in Christ his eyes is on Calvary right in the middle of the road now watch he said if he's just a little bit emotional the first thing you know he'll work out over here to a side and the first thing he'll become a fanatic if he don't watch if he's just a little starchy educated he'll work over here on this side and be so cold and stiff and starchy and take all the spirit out of him if the devil can't keep you from seeing the the truth he'll push you off of the deep end with it what must balanced keep your eyes on the Reapers that are in front of you because it's the word that's being delivered in season in the field and let me just say this to you everything this is what I found this is my testimony I have found that everything God knows the decisions that I'm going to be facing even in the week the month the year and God is preparing he's guiding he's influencing he's changing us he's molding us he knows what's coming and as we'll stay in step with the word we don't have to try to make our own way if you will stay in step with him he will not only add to your life spiritually what needs to be added in your life but he'll make everything work for your good that isn't a promise of a Prosperity Gospel I'm talking about a god that'll take you through when tests or Trials come your way because there are tests and trials as you're walking this way there are temptations that come this way but if you keep your eyes on him amen and stay put don't allow the enemy to pull it out of you things that God wants to put into your life if you're not careful by the time that you get to the end of this street somebody's already cut out in front of you and the Very things that God has wanted to put in you you find yourself who we got quiet in here now but you understand listen you understand that's Satan's tactic to try to move you out of the field he's trying to move you away because listen the things that you're reaping as you're gleaning it and you're meditating on it and you're thinking upon it you're praying upon it let me tell you what's happening there's transformation taking place in your life this is why the prophet could say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said what God that great mystery God's wanting to get to you he said you let your job take it out of you you let family you let other things take it out of you that's right so just remember that's what Satan's desire is to do to try to draw us out of that field get us away from his presence when we get away from his presence listen friends one of the shest signs of the world we get away from his presence we in our own selves we start getting prickly we start getting touchy oh yes come on now I don't know about you but I I I don't not going to say oh that's just my flesh no God's given me a Dominion to rule over that he said if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit and if you'll walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh it's staying in this field staying and gleaning you know sometimes when you glean it you're gleaning and you don't you don't altogether see a loaf of bread out there but you got to go glean right it's like here like I told the young people and many different times I said you know when we look in the New Testament there's black letter and red letter right red letter red letter says oh this is the words of the Lord Jesus that that he spoke let me just tell you something every day in your life is not a red letter day there are a lot of blackletter days true but the blackletter Days Make Way for redl moments that's a complete walk with god oh yeah I'd love it if every day was a red letter day I look for it I don't say oh today's going to be a black letter day as a matter of fact some days I thought was a black letter day brother Ray end up being a red letter day ohy CU he shows up sometimes when you least expect it so what are we going to do we're going to glean oh oh my back it's man it's hard to get down there today but I'm going to I'm going to glean I'm going to take that promise Lord that what you spoke to me here I'm going to take that amen I'm going to nourish it like the prophet said let us cherish it and nurture it obey it he said with Godly discipline until it becomes manifest in our life I'm going to take it Lord you dropped this from me you dropped this from me I'm going to take that in my life amen you love him amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I I'm certain Lord that in each of Our Lives Many Times Lord we see it more and more that Lord the value of obedience just simple simple simple little things lord it's not Lord the big things Lord that are left undone that hurt us it's the little things but it's the little things that lead to the bigger things that you want to do in our lives Lord I'm sure that just as much as we said that Ruth when she went out there to that field that day and she was even moved to make that decision I'm sure Lord that maybe she didn't she didn't feel spiritual no doubt there were days that she went out there but she knew what a desire was in her heart that I want to serve God no matter what I'm willing to let go of the things of this life and this world I'm willing Lord I I want to serve you whatever it takes whatever you ask that's what I want to do it's not too much Lord it might be Lord God where my flesh Lord in your presence I can be honest with you if there's things that I'm still struggling with Lord God as I step into that Lord for the hearts of others Lord that would pray this along and have that upon their heart to say Lord there's things that I struggle with but I know that you're not ashamed you came down and talked to me this morning but I'm asking you Lord that you would take that from my life Lord I don't want anything that Lord I don't want those things of the world I know what's wrong Lord God take Lord God everything Lord every habit take everything from me Lord that Lord God is hindering a deeper Walk with You Lord oh Father I I prayed this morning Lord God as Ruth was in that field I'd say Lord there were days and mornings when she got up oh she was weary Lord God she came from a land where there was plenty and now when she came into this land the laws and the direction of it Lord the gleaning that was to be done by the maidens Lord father she would go out Lord Jesus no doubt there were days as we said that she maybe didn't feel just exactly up to going out and gleaning I'm sure that she did not see the full value of The Obedience just even at the beginning when she made her decision she had no way of knowing what what would transpire through her life that there would be a union with her and Naomi's Kinsman Boaz she had no idea Lord that this awaited her but that mystery laid there the whole time lord there's things about it in our life that Lord Jesus we come to and you show us just as we have have need of it Lord I'm asking through this building here this morning Lord father from every visitor is here Lord to everyone Lord that father would attend and Lord God call this their home assembly Lord Jesus May every one of us Lord father be faithful in gleaning in the field Lord Lord God gleaning of the promises Lord we realize there's a hpe here that Lord where Ruth was in a stage of her journey of her walk with you but in reality Lord once a person has really been United with you that gleaning as far as taking in of the word praying reading the word those are sacred virtues that are entrusted to us that never ceases Lord there's a desire I want to know him more I want to know him more Lord this message oh God I feel the same way Lord as your Prophet said when you came down there in Sabino Canyon Lord and begin to make make known your will he said it's wound me into this Bible tighter than ever before Lord Jesus we love you father Lord I'm so thankful to be in this field Lord I remember as a young man I sat around it I remember that Papa but Lord I'm so glad that Lord you begin to to deal with My Heart Lord I the way that Lord that you have taken me Lord the way that you've brought me through in my journey Lord I've seen many times with things the way you've dealt with me Lord so that I would be able to relate to others Lord and be able to minister and to help them Lord oh God I pray that Lord Jesus May Lord God that reality Lord Jesus of this field lord of the precious promises Lord of what lays here in our midst Lord may we lord God I pray gleaning it for our families for our homes for our lives Lord oh God a word that Lord Jesus will change us one of these days in a moment and a twinkling of an eye Lord God Lord help us father help us Lord help every one of us Lord God lord Jesus if there's anything that Lord has attracted the attention maybe lord it's been things of of this life and of this world and Lord there's lives and hearts that would want to be honest with you this morning and say Lord I I I'm here in the field but yet Lord I I'm really not where I need to be with you I've allowed other things to take Lord God to take the joy of the Lord out of my life I've just been going through seems like just ritual brother Samuel just just just going just through the motions of things there's just no joy I but I I want the joy of his salvation restored in my life Lord Jesus you're here to do that Lord it doesn't take Lord God some great big steps it takes Lord God a willingness from the heart to recognize where we've drifted from and Lord God wear Lord little things that we've allowed little by little by little by little by little to get us away from the most important thing Lord when it comes down to the closing moments of this life no doubt Lord some that are sitting under the sound of my voice we'll come to that don't matter what age we are we don't have the promise of the next minute but father there's nothing greater than your loving kindness that's why David could write he had found it to be greater than life thy loving kindness your life Lord your will oh father I pray this morning Lord may you Lord Jesus oh God just moving Lord God Upon Our Hearts if there's things Lord that father we've allowed Lord God to take our attention away from you may we not just Lord just just look at it lightly but may we lord truly from our heart say Lord I want to really stay in the field the right way because when he said abide here he meant not just to stand there not just to sit there but he meant to move there operate there go forward there Lord Jesus help us Lord I pray you're here to minister to us Lord you're here to minister to to our hearts here to encourage us like Boaz would say to Ruth go not to another field abide here in this field stay here remain here he asked her to stay in his field oh Lord God Ruth never asked asked him Boaz asked Ruth Lord it wasn't us seeking you it was you seeking after us it was you that approached us Lord God after the decisions that laboring in the field and you would come and speak to us maybe if it's been a while since you've heard from him why don't you just examine let the Holy Spirit just examine your heart have you been gleaning as you ought to I mean surrendering to him seeking after him is your eyes still upon the Eastern sky are you still looking for the coming of the Lord or you just looking for oh I can't wait till night gets here till I can go to bed I can't wait till the morning and no doubt there's pressures of Life friends that are real but let me just say this to you the prophet would use this term don't get in the rat race of life don't allow yourself to be drugged there oh we all have to deal with the cares of this life that's true but don't let the cares of the life rule over you Paul would warn the children of God in that hour that as we would live in the world but let us not abuse it let us not Let it rain over us we're here only for a purpose and that's to serve his purpose I wonderers our heads are bowed would there be a heart a life someone that would say remember me remember me in prayer amen God bless your hands Lord I Want to Be Remembered in prayer amen amen God bless you your hands he sees your hearts Heavenly Father Lord You're mindful Lord of your children now may you grant Lord every request that's behind those hands Lord Lord whatever the promise might be whatever Lord it it might be may you Lord God continue to Str strengthen Lord Jesus continue Lord I pray Lord God for every one of us Lord Jesus Lord in this hour of gross Darkness an hour Lord God where the spirit upon the church says I'm rich and have need of nothing but Lord God spiritual Criterion is not the wealth of this world but real riches are the true riches that come from you it's your life being deposited Lord in our lives help us Lord I pray father may you Lord God just continue to minister and meet every single need Lord may we lord God gleaning in this field what a what a what a precious thing Lord to glean in the field of the revealed Promises of the hour oh God where every promise of God is yay and amen Amen in him help us Lord I pray now in the name of Jesus Christ amen could we stand go ahead brother Brian go ahead lead us all the way I'm going all the [Music] way all the way I'm going in all the way all the way I'm going all the way Lord I pray oh God I'm going all the way with the [Music] Lord I've made my decision going all the way I've made my choice yes Lord I'm going all the way Hallelujah I've made my decision oh and I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with the Lord I've drawn the light I'm going all the way no turning back no turning back I'm going all the way I've drawn the line I'm going all the way I'm going all the with the Lord away [Music] all the way I'm going all the way I'm going all the way all the way going all the way I'm going all the way all the way yes I'm going all the way for I'm going all the way my Lord that verse in that song said I've made my decision and I'm going all the way you know there's always a starting point right and there's always a starting point with the Lord hlu just like you can be in a mall or somewhere and I know those things are kind of obsolete now but you know sometimes you don't know where to go cuz you don't know where you're at but when you can look at find a map that lets you know you are here then when you see where you're at then you can trace where you need to go and you see only God can show you where you're at but the God who shows you where you're at knows the desire in your heart for where you want to go he put that desire in there and it starts with the Simplicity of of confessing the Lord Jesus Christ of repenting of your sins it starts with a very simple decision that's what Ruth did that's why the scripture said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is the gift of the Holy Ghost that's that desire there's a longing within you for God and only God can satisfy that and so what God's desire is is to lead you beyond your unbelief lead you beyond your own desires and he lets you know this is where you are and this is where I want to take you and it starts with simple simple obedience how many you know what I'm talking about it was simple obedience I I could never have even known what it would be like if God tear this coming June it will be 29 years that I've been serving the lord 28 years of preaching the gospel but I could have never known it whether I ever preached or not I could have never known what Joy this is I couldn't even have imagined it I couldn't have even imagined it of the ways that God has made but you see the value of obedience don't ever despise obeying small things because when you begin to obey the word little by little by little there is a virtue of strength that's being released in your life and the things that you experience now you think Lord I didn't realize it I I didn't even realize the joy now from when I rep Ed and walked in the waters of baptism then to where God did a a capping work in our life filling us with the spirit of God my I could never have imagined I mean I've seen others and I thought I want what they've got I want what they've got I want that Joy they've got that's what I want I want that something that they have that I know that through thick and thin they're solid as a rock and they there's a joy that beats in their heart amen listen friends I lived in a home with a father and a mother they weren't perfect but they loved the Lord and let me just tell you something right now I even sitting there and sitting under the message I still couldn't figure out what made him tick that way you know why the Bible said that the mystery of godliness it's the mystery and godliness is God's spirit working in your life it's a mystery it's nothing we could read ourselves into study ourselves into it's the gift of God it's a reality that comes down on the inside the more that you surrender you know what it starts with yes Lord yes Lord come on for we don't have to make this is not hard there's times when every one of us have been in a bad mood we've woke up on the wrong side of the bed and yet we've got a choice on whether or not we're going to act grumpy or we're going to act nice is that right let's not make surrender hard we've got a choice but we do what we know is the right thing to do that is surrender so don't let the enemy discount that to you well that's nothing that's just you acting in the flesh that's you Desiring to please God that's the beginnings of surrender don't allow the enemy to take that from you it's little by little by little by little and the more you let that light come in you that light will keep penetrating in your life it'll run out every bit of malice it'll run out every bit of Envy it'll grow in your life that's what the light of God does hallelujah it's a joy it's a reality Hallelujah ain't that right brother Ryan little by little surrender this is what's right this is what I might feel like like sometimes we come here sometimes we come we don't feel like worshiping I I don't think I'm just the only one sometimes I don't feel like it I feel like just sitting maybe I'm tired I'm weary been through battles mind battle everything else but it's in that time that we press beyond that I may not feel real spiritual at that moment but he's worthy it's the right thing to do and it invites his presence right down to your life hey look they were sad on the road to emus but they began to talk about him they were disappointed cuz things didn't go as they thought it should go but they started talking talking about him but he came to him he stepped out and walked with them Hallelujah and the god that maybe you look in your life and through things that you look I'm disappointed here I'm disappointed there let me tell you something entertain him who's walking with you right now invite him in right now invite him in go beyond your flesh go beyond your thoughts go beyond your feelings and say Lord I'm going to press Beyond this barrier cuz this barrier is a lie it's only trying to K it's like a scarecrow where do you put a scarecrow at you don't put a scarecrow over a over a Barren spot of ground you put a scarecrow over things you don't want touched and the devil don't want you to get a hold of this word he don't want you to get a hold of it because this word releases to you who you really are it gives you power it gives you authority to Fly Above the things of the world this word has your identity it's the one thing that'll tell you who you are where you come from where you're going and'll be right there to tell you you're more than a conqueror that's what my Boaz does that's what our Boaz does hearest thou me my daughter yeah isin't God good he's good isn't he all the time all the time all the time go ahead brother Brian come and take over I've made my decision going all the way I made my choice going all the way I made my decision I'm going all the way yes
