[31:52] about how god desires to have fellowship
[31:54] with us
[31:56] it's not what we can see but it's what
[31:58] he sees deep inside of us amen
[32:00] it's the very life
[32:03] key of b-flat b-flat
[32:12] start with the uh verse
[32:14] do you remember the verse
[32:17] on the road to emails
[32:20] [Music]
[32:21] three men walk that way
[32:25] [Music]
[32:26] as they reach their
[32:28] destination
[32:30] the two men asked the third to stay
[32:36] and as they talk together
[32:40] breaking bread and pouring wine
[32:44] [Music]
[32:45] i finally
[32:48] now realize
[32:50] the simplicity of his size
[32:56] how could he
[32:58] desire
[33:00] to have
[33:01] fellowship with me
[33:05] there must be
[33:07] something more within
[33:13] amen
[33:15] i prayed your lord take on my life
[33:20] i give it all to thee
[33:25] grant that every day
[33:29] help me church
[33:30] your commune
[33:33] with me
[33:35] and how can he
[33:37] desire
[33:40] to have
[33:41] fellowship with me
[33:44] there
[33:45] must be
[33:47] something more within
[33:50] that only he can see
[33:55] i prayed your lord take all my life i
[34:00] give it all to thee
[34:06] [Music]
[34:07] oh grant that every day
[34:13] your
[34:14] commune with me let's sing that verse
[34:16] again
[34:20] on the road to emails
[34:26] three men walk that way
[34:30] as they reach their
[34:32] destination
[34:34] the two men asked the third to stay
[34:40] and as they talk together
[34:45] breaking bread
[34:50] i finally
[34:52] now realize
[34:55] the simplicity of his size
[35:00] and how could he
[35:02] desire
[35:04] to have
[35:06] fellowship with me
[35:10] there must be
[35:11] something more within
[35:15] that only he can see
[35:19] i prayed the lord take all my life i
[35:25] give it all to thee
[35:28] [Music]
[35:31] oh
[35:32] grant that every day
[35:37] your
[35:38] commune with me one more time
[35:42] and how can he
[35:44] desire
[35:46] to have
[35:48] fellowship with me
[35:51] there must be
[35:53] something more
[35:57] that within
[35:58] he can't see
[36:02] my prayer dear lord take all my life i
[36:07] give it all to thee
[36:14] oh grant that every day
[36:18] [Music]
[36:19] your
[36:21] commune with me
[36:24] grant that every day
[36:30] you'll come here
[36:32] with me
[36:44] [Music]
[36:48] it's just
[36:50] overwhelming
[36:52] as you think of it more and more
[36:55] god
[36:57] desires fellowship
[37:05] there's no way that we could get to him
[37:08] we couldn't restore him
[37:10] hallelujah
[37:12] only he could do that amen
[37:15] and i'm glad that
[37:17] he had a great yearning for fellowship
[37:19] weren't you amen

[42:00] amen
[42:04] if you'd like to open
[42:07] your bibles
[42:11] i'd like to
[42:12] go back to the passage of scripture that
[42:14] we were reading from
[42:18] last week i'd like to
[42:21] just continue on
[42:23] with the thought of
[42:25] our part
[42:27] in the kingdom our
[42:29] heart
[42:30] in the kingdom
[42:32] matthew chapter 9
[42:35] verse 35
[42:44] jesus went about all the cities and
[42:47] villages teaching
[42:48] in their synagogues and preaching the
[42:50] gospel of the kingdom
[42:52] and healing their sickness
[42:54] and every disease among the people
[42:57] when he saw the multitudes he was moved
[42:59] with compassion on them because
[43:02] they fainted
[43:03] and were scattered abroad
[43:06] as she
[43:07] having no shepherd
[43:09] then saith he unto his disciples the
[43:12] harvest truly is plenteous
[43:14] but the laborers
[43:16] are few
[43:18] pray you therefore the lord of harvest
[43:21] that he will send forth laborers
[43:25] into his
[43:27] harvest
[43:29] may god bless you bless the reading of
[43:30] the word as you're being seated
[43:33] i want to just
[43:36] say as well before i
[43:38] get right into this
[43:39] here
[43:40] this morning that um i just want to say
[43:44] you know on behalf of the
[43:46] trustees they could
[43:49] be doing this just as well and they
[43:51] probably will be doing it here in the
[43:52] future but just just wanted to make
[43:54] mention to you i wanted to
[43:57] thank you there was an offering i
[43:59] believe was right over
[44:01] thirteen hundred dollars that came in
[44:03] last week so i think that's about close
[44:05] to
[44:06] thirty 3 500 that's been collected for
[44:09] towards the building project
[44:12] and there i also want to say thank you
[44:14] for
[44:16] your prayers and continue to keep that
[44:18] in prayer of the brothers it seems like
[44:20] as we were praying about remember the
[44:22] quotes and getting the quotes back well
[44:25] thanks be to god we got the we got
[44:27] quotes back and we're only waiting on
[44:28] one more quote so it should be about i
[44:30] think it's six quotes is that right
[44:31] brother shane about six six quotes and
[44:34] so
[44:36] these brothers have done the
[44:38] the research to bring in
[44:40] someone here that
[44:42] you know would be where it would be
[44:45] somewhat of good good work so we just
[44:47] want prayer prayer as well may we just
[44:50] pray together that god will just guide
[44:52] and direct us on this here
[44:54] i also want to announce
[44:57] on this coming thursday brother benny
[44:59] perry from swanson south carolina will
[45:02] be ministering for us here you'll also
[45:05] be ministering at brother randy's on
[45:07] wednesday at 7 pm as well and more than
[45:10] welcome to to be there
[45:12] at brother randy's as well
[45:14] so this brother this coming thursday
[45:16] brother benny perry will be here from
[45:19] swanson south carolina
[45:21] and and he might actually be coming this
[45:22] way to actually get warmer weather
[45:25] with what they got in store coming today
[45:28] it's kind of kind of odd you know and
[45:30] amazing
[45:31] the things you when i was just talking
[45:32] to him last week and it was 80-some
[45:34] degrees and
[45:35] ah my goodness yeah i hated some degrees
[45:37] and i'm looking at my office window and
[45:39] i'm just i'm cold looking out the window
[45:43] but we thank god for his mercy and we
[45:45] want to just remember them in prayer as
[45:47] they would be traveling up
[45:49] i want to just continue on this thought
[45:52] on our part
[45:54] in the kingdom
[45:56] as we look at this and knowing that
[45:58] we there is a part that we
[46:01] we do have to
[46:03] fulfill
[46:04] and uh i want to read go back into a
[46:08] quote that i've read here a couple times
[46:10] to you one when in from the thursday the
[46:12] the message is on prayer which this also
[46:14] deals with prayer
[46:16] but to understand that
[46:18] the part that god has asked of you and i
[46:20] to do
[46:22] it's not
[46:23] us doing it on our own accord and then
[46:26] surrendering it to god but rather
[46:28] it's recognizing that it must be him
[46:31] do the work and fulfill it through our
[46:34] lives
[46:35] because all that was lost there in in
[46:38] the fall what was lost there of how that
[46:42] god would come down as brother trevor
[46:44] was going back into that on thursday
[46:46] night of fellowship with adam and eve
[46:49] and that fellowship was more it was not
[46:52] just speaking lip to ear but the
[46:54] fellowship was because they also had
[46:57] god's nature inside of them
[47:00] because that's the real fellowship
[47:02] without that fellowship then there
[47:04] cannot be the other fellowship so it's
[47:07] because of that there had to come about
[47:10] a restoring to bring us back into a true
[47:12] fellowship which would be under the shed
[47:15] blood of the lamb
[47:17] and so when we we see it that when we
[47:20] are looking here in the scripture
[47:22] brother branham he pulls this and this
[47:24] this quote that i want to read from and
[47:27] he's speaking how that the lord jesus
[47:29] spent so much time in prayer
[47:31] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[47:34] prayer to stay
[47:36] in fellowship with the spirit that was
[47:39] in him
[47:40] how much more do you and i
[47:43] have to spend in prayer
[47:46] much time in prayer if you only knew
[47:48] what time in prayer meant
[47:51] and remember we are made up of a series
[47:54] of courts body spirit and soul
[47:58] and we have decisions decisions are made
[48:01] not in the soul but decisions are made
[48:04] in the mind that's the battleground
[48:06] we have that in this we have the spirit
[48:08] realm as well
[48:10] and satan is always always out to try to
[48:13] draw us out to live
[48:16] our lives through those two outer realms
[48:20] and we're always defeated when we go
[48:22] when we go by those realms
[48:24] and those outer realms we can have
[48:25] feelings and impressions
[48:27] all sorts of things
[48:29] but when we're guided and letting our
[48:33] lives be under the influence of the
[48:35] inner man
[48:36] of that life that god has deposited on
[48:39] the inside then we're no we're not under
[48:42] the influence
[48:43] of of our own being or our own thoughts
[48:46] but we are under the influence of the
[48:49] mind of christ
[48:50] and that's something that we must we we
[48:53] find ourselves to be very purposeful in
[48:56] our lives it's not just things that just
[48:58] happens
[48:59] but it's things that we must be very
[49:01] purposeful with and this is why paul
[49:03] could say in romans 12 that we would
[49:06] present our bodies as a living sacrifice
[49:09] god god will not present our bodies for
[49:12] us we must present our bodies unto god
[49:15] our lives unto god
[49:17] and he said jesus had to spend much time
[49:19] in prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[49:22] spirit that was in him how much more do
[49:24] you and i have to spend in prayer
[49:27] much time in prayer if you only knew
[49:30] what time in prayer meant
[49:32] sometimes when you're in prayer god
[49:35] changes the complete destination of
[49:37] different things that's going to happen
[49:39] he said do you believe that it might be
[49:42] something's fixing to happen and your
[49:44] prayer could change the whole situation
[49:46] let me just pause here for a moment the
[49:49] outer two realms can look at something
[49:51] and say i don't see any other way around
[49:53] this this seems like a done deal
[49:56] but the inner man is one who is
[49:58] strengthened by god and if we give the
[50:00] inner man the right away
[50:02] the inner man it's not saying that it's
[50:04] going to go that way but we have an
[50:08] access to the throne of god to recognize
[50:12] that it is god that can move on the
[50:15] scene and will move on the scene even in
[50:18] things that are thought to be impossible
[50:20] to man god can take situations and turn
[50:23] it right around
[50:25] we've seen that with healing we've seen
[50:27] it with other natural things within life
[50:29] we've seen it within spiritual
[50:31] conditions of even the direction than
[50:34] pathways that our life was headed but
[50:36] god stepped in and god interceded and
[50:40] god changed the course of the situation
[50:44] of our lives
[50:46] but the brahman said you would say if
[50:48] god knows it's going to happen
[50:51] what would my prayer do
[50:53] he said your and he refers us to this
[50:55] text that we read he said you remember
[50:57] when he stood there looking out upon the
[50:59] harvest he was the lord of the harvest
[51:01] and he said the harvest is ripe and
[51:03] laborers are but few
[51:05] pray ye the lord of harvest that he will
[51:08] send laborers into his harvest in other
[51:11] words pray to me that i will send
[51:14] laborers into my harvest which i'm
[51:17] telling you it's such a needy thing
[51:20] he said but part of it sees this part of
[51:23] it lays in human beings do you believe
[51:26] that the kingdom of god lays within the
[51:30] human being
[51:32] now we know that the kingdom of god
[51:35] cometh without observation
[51:38] the kingdom of god is not in word but
[51:41] it's in power
[51:43] and no man can even see understand the
[51:47] kingdom of god except he be born again
[51:52] is that right
[51:54] and it is the kingdom of god when this
[51:57] kingdom that was that we speak of of
[52:00] god's own life coming in to his children
[52:05] by way of the new birth and raising up a
[52:08] son and daughter of god on the inside
[52:11] that is a subject of the kingdom
[52:14] that has been born of the spirit of god
[52:17] and reflects the kingdom of god
[52:21] right here walking in this present world
[52:25] it's a kingdom that daniel was under the
[52:28] inspiration and said in the days of
[52:30] these kings the god of heaven shall set
[52:33] up a kingdom that will overthrow the
[52:35] rest of the nations and shall never be
[52:38] overthrown let me just say this that the
[52:41] kingdom of god by the holy ghost this is
[52:44] why the spirit of god when it would
[52:46] speak to us it is not an option to be
[52:49] born again you must be born again
[52:53] there's only one thing that can
[52:54] overthrow
[52:56] that nature that first birth and give
[52:59] you a power to reign in and to live a
[53:03] victorious life and it comes through and
[53:06] by the holy ghost coming and quickening
[53:09] that man on the inside you see what the
[53:12] holy spirit is actually doing is he's
[53:15] drawing the man on the inside there is
[53:18] that of the son and daughter of god
[53:21] that's magnetized
[53:23] to the holy spirit that's coming forth
[53:26] and that's what god is working on to
[53:29] bring into expression
[53:31] and that expression it ties you right
[53:34] back in to the tree of life and that
[53:37] tree is greater than your natural tree
[53:41] right there you've received an abstract
[53:44] that is greater than any claim that your
[53:47] natural tree could have upon you you
[53:49] have been brought back in contact with
[53:52] the tree of life himself the lord jesus
[53:55] christ amen i'd say praise be to god so
[53:59] it's the kingdom of god that lays within
[54:02] the human being jesus said in one place
[54:04] i'm the vine you are the branches the
[54:06] vine can't bear fruit the branches in
[54:09] the vine
[54:10] bears fruit and god cannot bear fruit of
[54:13] himself it's got to take the church he's
[54:16] got to take you branches to bear fruit
[54:18] and when you branches are yielded to the
[54:20] vine then fruit comes forth
[54:23] notice god wants your hands he wants
[54:26] your eyes he wants your tongue he wants
[54:29] your lips he wants your ears he wants
[54:31] your hands and feet so he can bring
[54:33] forth fruit through you
[54:37] so god's god's desire he will use the
[54:41] life that is sanctified and surrendered
[54:44] to his purpose
[54:46] and so it becomes god pouring himself
[54:48] into that life and god operating through
[54:52] that seed and then the hands express
[54:55] what's on the inside the life expresses
[54:58] what's on the inside in other words this
[55:01] outward man only gives a visible
[55:04] manifestation of the indwelling of the
[55:07] invisible god
[55:09] because that that working is that of the
[55:12] kingdom of god going forth in our life
[55:14] you see when we're under the kingdom of
[55:16] god under that by the new birth we're no
[55:18] longer we no longer care for the things
[55:21] of the world but our delight is in the
[55:24] lord jesus christ
[55:26] we're not just we're not just people
[55:28] that are good clean moral people that
[55:30] comes with it but it's it's deeper than
[55:32] that it's a people that are moved by the
[55:35] spirit of god to fulfill the will and
[55:38] purpose of almighty god that are in tune
[55:41] with god's kingdom
[55:43] amen
[55:44] and jesus here we referred to this last
[55:47] week and referred to in the quote in
[55:49] john 15 and i just want to go to verse 5
[55:52] of john 15
[55:53] and jesus said i am the vine ye are the
[55:57] branches so he's letting us know
[55:59] position
[56:00] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[56:03] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[56:06] without me you can do nothing i want you
[56:09] just to hang on to this where without me
[56:11] you can do nothing he did not say that
[56:13] you were not going to do anything he
[56:15] just let you know that what you are
[56:16] called to do you cannot do it without me
[56:19] you will need me but i need you amen
[56:23] is that right yes amen
[56:26] verse 7 if he abided me
[56:29] and my words abide in you
[56:32] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[56:35] be done unto you so notice if you abide
[56:38] in me you're dwelling in me your life is
[56:41] hidden in me
[56:42] and my words abide in you they find
[56:45] place in your life you shall ask what
[56:48] you will and it shall be done unto you
[56:51] it's very simple what you're going to be
[56:52] asking is his will which is according to
[56:55] his word that's dwelling in you
[56:58] you're not even because you're you're no
[57:00] longer walking by your earthly desires
[57:03] and as the word is coming forth you're
[57:06] you find under the maturity you're
[57:08] losing sight of the things of self and
[57:12] you're more in tune with with working
[57:15] and operating to please the lord jesus
[57:19] christ
[57:21] it doesn't it becomes more into that
[57:24] into that realm and we know that
[57:26] whatever
[57:28] fruit will come from whatever we yield
[57:30] our members instruments to that's right
[57:33] god will never yield god does not come
[57:36] down and yield
[57:37] the members of our body
[57:39] but he says you yield them right
[57:42] god says yields your members romans 6
[57:45] and remembers to righteousness so we
[57:48] have we have an authority
[57:50] and yielding our lives to him and paul
[57:53] would write of this in romans 7 of this
[57:56] union that is now taking place between
[57:59] the believer and christ because our old
[58:02] husband that first nature were not just
[58:05] divorced from
[58:06] him he has to be dead
[58:10] is that right that's scripture
[58:12] because god will not marry will not
[58:15] become united the holy ghost will not
[58:17] come as long as a life is still alive to
[58:20] the world and loving the things of the
[58:21] world
[58:23] but you see god brings us to a place in
[58:26] our life the holy spirit not god
[58:27] bringing us but god dealing with our
[58:29] life and this is where as an individual
[58:31] when you've surrendered your life to the
[58:33] lord brother braham will say just this
[58:35] way and things that are to be he says
[58:37] when you've come to a place and you've
[58:38] offered your life to christ but if you
[58:40] haven't received the holy ghost yet he
[58:42] said ask god to add word on top of a
[58:46] word on top of word he said and come and
[58:49] get the holy ghost
[58:51] what a way it lays it right out that god
[58:54] is inviting us to say lord and word on
[58:58] top of word on top of the word lord
[59:00] bring me lord to that place that there
[59:03] is a desire you're stirring up in me let
[59:06] me tell you something a church can't
[59:08] stir that up that is the heavenly father
[59:12] that is stirring up that desire that was
[59:15] within you all the time and he's the
[59:18] only one that can satisfy that amen
[59:25] oh i love it it just takes it takes
[59:28] everything of flesh out of the way and
[59:30] it puts it right between us and god
[59:33] it's the vine that energizes the branch
[59:37] it energizes and we were looking at that
[59:40] last week on how that it's the vine that
[59:42] energizes or inspires the branch what to
[59:46] ask or we won't even know what to ask
[59:50] so it's working in a relationship
[59:53] abiding in me
[59:56] you see as we as we look at this i want
[59:59] to go now just into john 15 7
[1:00:03] and i just want to just pick up
[1:00:05] and work with this divine energy
[1:00:08] that that divine himself the lord jesus
[1:00:12] is the vine
[1:00:14] the the children of god are the branches
[1:00:19] and it's the divine energy of the
[1:00:21] inspired word that directs us
[1:00:24] what to ask for
[1:00:26] in verse 7 once again john 15 7 if you
[1:00:29] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:00:32] ye shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:00:36] be
[1:00:37] done
[1:00:38] unto you
[1:00:39] so there's no question
[1:00:43] it's not a question will it be done
[1:00:45] because where where not only that you or
[1:00:49] your life is dwelling in the word
[1:00:52] but the word is also dwelling in you
[1:00:55] so what you're asking for is the word
[1:00:58] which you're asking for the same thing
[1:01:00] you are amen
[1:01:03] is that right
[1:01:05] you're not asking for something
[1:01:06] different notice the life of the lord
[1:01:08] jesus when he came he came to
[1:01:12] demonstrate
[1:01:13] listen
[1:01:14] enoch and the rest of them had only
[1:01:16] heard stories from from great grandpa
[1:01:18] eat adam
[1:01:21] you know they were alive they had only
[1:01:23] heard
[1:01:24] testimonies about that and my heart adam
[1:01:27] could describe the presence of god
[1:01:29] coming down
[1:01:30] but now notice what was lost now christ
[1:01:34] there have been glimpses of it a glimpse
[1:01:37] here and a glimpse here and a glimpse
[1:01:39] here like rays of a rainbow but remember
[1:01:42] all of them come together to make that
[1:01:45] light and god is light
[1:01:47] it was god coming together now to
[1:01:50] display this
[1:01:52] is what god intended a son and daughter
[1:01:55] of god to be and this is what we had
[1:01:59] fallen from
[1:02:01] and so here the life of of the lord
[1:02:04] jesus it was in that of redemption work
[1:02:07] that is true
[1:02:08] but it was a life that within redemption
[1:02:11] that was also to express so that you and
[1:02:15] i could not just could have such a an
[1:02:18] idea to have such a if i can say an
[1:02:21] example that sat before us of what god
[1:02:24] intends every son and daughter of god to
[1:02:27] be
[1:02:28] the lord jesus did not operate on his
[1:02:31] own will though god listen to me now god
[1:02:34] so condescended into that place to where
[1:02:38] now he could experience that of that of
[1:02:41] a
[1:02:42] of a will but remember the lord jesus
[1:02:45] never moved by his own will he was
[1:02:48] tempted
[1:02:49] he was tested within that area come on
[1:02:51] now
[1:02:52] well you know
[1:02:53] man he was tempted with all sorts of
[1:02:56] temptations he was tempted with sin and
[1:02:58] everything else but he was also tempted
[1:03:01] to get ahead of the program of god he
[1:03:03] was tempted to do something and notice
[1:03:06] he had the power within him but he did
[1:03:10] not do it because he had the power
[1:03:12] within him he did what he did by vision
[1:03:16] under leadership of the holy spirit
[1:03:19] he was the word made flesh it was an
[1:03:22] example
[1:03:23] of what god was bringing back sons and
[1:03:26] daughters of god that would not be moved
[1:03:28] upon their own will upon their own
[1:03:30] feelings but would be
[1:03:32] reconciled to the leadership of the holy
[1:03:34] spirit and i say god help me to be more
[1:03:38] help me to be more
[1:03:41] help me to be more
[1:03:43] so this divine energy and i want to just
[1:03:45] just to lay this in
[1:03:47] and when this scripture here brother
[1:03:49] brahm talks about how moses failed in
[1:03:52] the first place and era of god's
[1:03:54] deliverance he said here's what's the
[1:03:55] matter it was the lack of having what
[1:03:59] the burning bush had
[1:04:01] and that's where our failure today is a
[1:04:04] lack having what the holy spirit has and
[1:04:07] the holy spirit has all good things for
[1:04:10] us
[1:04:11] if we receive the holy spirit then all
[1:04:14] things are possible and not only
[1:04:17] possible but promised to us
[1:04:20] is that right amen in him it yea and
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:23] jesus said ask the father anything in my
[1:04:26] name and i'll do it if you abide in me
[1:04:28] in my words and you ask what you're
[1:04:29] willing to be given to you now notice
[1:04:32] brother braham takes this he says when
[1:04:33] we step into the light of god's word
[1:04:37] with the unction of the holy spirit
[1:04:40] to shine the light on it brother the
[1:04:43] impossible becomes little things then
[1:04:48] we are we we are built to be moved by
[1:04:53] the unction of the holy ghost
[1:04:56] i hear brother branham standing at the
[1:04:58] end of fundamental foundation of faith
[1:05:00] it's been going over and over in that
[1:05:02] message and brother ram's talking about
[1:05:04] the divine energy of god moving through
[1:05:07] the branches and what god has purposed
[1:05:09] the church of the living god to be and
[1:05:11] brother ram stands there he's praying
[1:05:13] for for a sister after he's prayed for
[1:05:15] many and you know discernment things
[1:05:18] have been called out and he asked he
[1:05:20] asked the lord jesus he said father he
[1:05:22] said will you energize me just now and
[1:05:25] energize this sister with your presence
[1:05:28] lord that this need might be met you see
[1:05:31] it's asking for his energy for his
[1:05:34] unction god knows what you and i need to
[1:05:37] be unctionized in he knows the the
[1:05:40] energy that you and i have need of in
[1:05:43] our lives
[1:05:47] god asks us to believe his word he sends
[1:05:50] the holy spirit to energize that word
[1:05:53] when he falls into it
[1:05:55] when the word's being preached and the
[1:05:57] holy spirit brings the word he energizes
[1:06:00] that and flashes the same light of god's
[1:06:04] blessed promise
[1:06:06] and god's provided a way of healing he
[1:06:08] says when you receive the inspiration
[1:06:11] that jesus christ died for your sickness
[1:06:14] it's that very hour that your healing
[1:06:16] has come when you receive from heaven
[1:06:19] that jesus died for your sins and you've
[1:06:22] accepted it you don't need any prayer
[1:06:24] for you then you've already accepted it
[1:06:27] it's settled now watch how he goes here
[1:06:29] you we can preach the word and explain
[1:06:32] the word but you have to receive the
[1:06:35] word
[1:06:36] he said that's what sets it a fire
[1:06:38] brother when you receive it the
[1:06:41] revelation something slips out of the
[1:06:43] unseen world yonder and comes rolling
[1:06:46] down through a mystical channel
[1:06:49] somewhere into your soul that says now i
[1:06:52] see it your eyes brighten your lips that
[1:06:55] hung down straighten up and smile and
[1:06:57] every muscle in your body seems to
[1:07:00] rejoice something's going to happen
[1:07:02] something you don't need a prayer line
[1:07:04] then you've got it then
[1:07:12] when we're ready and to receive it
[1:07:16] you see the branch has to be willing to
[1:07:18] receive it
[1:07:20] it's just as it is declared right here
[1:07:23] and what is spoken and you can look at
[1:07:25] your life and say well i don't feel like
[1:07:28] a son and daughter of god brother samuel
[1:07:29] you don't know the kind of life or what
[1:07:31] i'm living but but the point is is that
[1:07:34] what is being proclaimed to you is that
[1:07:36] you are free but whether or not you
[1:07:39] accept that that's your own choice
[1:07:43] god will not do it for us he won't do
[1:07:45] anything it's us to accept what he has
[1:07:48] already done and reconcile ourselves to
[1:07:51] that fact that i am a son of god i am a
[1:07:55] daughter of god
[1:07:56] and stand upon that amen
[1:08:00] i think that was a very good
[1:08:02] point to brother trevor and he was i
[1:08:04] know that was inspiration striking there
[1:08:06] on thursday night i'll talk to him about
[1:08:08] that
[1:08:12] i'm gonna talk to my mom about don't
[1:08:14] talk to him about it right
[1:08:16] because satan has made an attack upon
[1:08:19] god's working in your life amen right
[1:08:22] don't you let him minimize that working
[1:08:26] as well well it's nothing that's you're
[1:08:28] just moved by emotion you know what it
[1:08:31] is he wants to discourage and try to
[1:08:34] take away from the working of almighty
[1:08:37] god but you know it's god's working in
[1:08:40] your life you know it's something beyond
[1:08:43] your own abilities your own things it's
[1:08:46] god moving in your life
[1:08:50] hallelujah
[1:08:52] oh my now i want you to think of this
[1:08:55] if you abide in me and my words
[1:08:59] abide in you
[1:09:02] you see this words
[1:09:05] it's not just as we can look at the
[1:09:08] written word
[1:09:10] we can even look out in putting the
[1:09:12] message together
[1:09:15] but if but if it's not
[1:09:18] by inspiration or the word that would be
[1:09:20] used here rhema the spirit of god
[1:09:23] inspiring and opening that word and
[1:09:27] really moving it down personal in your
[1:09:29] life
[1:09:31] and it's just a letter
[1:09:35] letters can be matched up
[1:09:38] students can match up verses
[1:09:40] quotes and everything else
[1:09:43] but when god speaks directly
[1:09:46] and that person that life is recognizing
[1:09:50] my words my my spirit revealed truth has
[1:09:55] found its place in your life then
[1:09:58] there's nothing can stand before
[1:10:02] and it becomes a living desire amen
[1:10:05] you see
[1:10:06] oh my let me just let me just minister a
[1:10:09] little bit
[1:10:10] moses when he needed direction for the
[1:10:13] children of israel that pillar of fire
[1:10:15] was following them brother bran refers
[1:10:17] that and the god changed his mind as the
[1:10:19] logos as the word
[1:10:21] but he says moses got from there
[1:10:25] what was needed for the people of god so
[1:10:28] what came from the logos
[1:10:30] was the rhema was the need for that
[1:10:33] moment
[1:10:34] and moses was god's instrument to tap
[1:10:38] into that that now rhema word could come
[1:10:42] to the camp of the living god
[1:10:44] so when the children of israel were
[1:10:47] moved by that inspired word it was a
[1:10:50] reflection that they had come under the
[1:10:53] leadership of the pillar of fire it had
[1:10:56] been a direct communication between god
[1:10:59] and them through his prophet amen
[1:11:05] are you with me amen
[1:11:07] now this is where let me just refer to
[1:11:09] this a few places
[1:11:11] jesus said it like this and this word
[1:11:13] that is used here rhema of spiritually
[1:11:16] revealed truth
[1:11:18] he answered and said in matthew 4 4 it's
[1:11:20] written man shall not live by bread
[1:11:22] alone but by every rhema that proceed us
[1:11:25] out of the mouth of god
[1:11:28] that's what we live by that's what our
[1:11:30] lives are orchestrated by you say what
[1:11:32] are you trying to say brother samuel i'm
[1:11:34] trying to say that every day of our life
[1:11:37] must be a fresh experience
[1:11:40] you can't live on last year's experience
[1:11:43] you can't live on last month's
[1:11:45] experience you must have a fresh
[1:11:48] experience every day of your life
[1:11:52] come on now organization make camps out
[1:11:55] of experiences of when god visited them
[1:11:58] but the only thing it is is a past
[1:12:00] memory
[1:12:02] amen god don't want to be a past memory
[1:12:05] he wants to be the living god
[1:12:08] he came to mary remember here the angel
[1:12:10] gabriel came to her with a message
[1:12:13] and remember as she as she asked how
[1:12:16] shall this be said the holy ghost shall
[1:12:17] overshadow thee
[1:12:19] notice
[1:12:20] and here he says for with god
[1:12:23] nothing
[1:12:25] no rhema
[1:12:26] no revealed word shall be impossible
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:32] it's prevailing power
[1:12:34] in the word of god
[1:12:36] let me tell you what prevailing power it
[1:12:38] is sometimes we're looking out here only
[1:12:40] to prevail over the enemy we need
[1:12:42] prevailing power over our own thoughts
[1:12:45] about ourselves
[1:12:46] and it takes a revelation from almighty
[1:12:50] god
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] come on now that's how we're living
[1:12:54] we're not living by bread alone we're
[1:12:56] living by every word of god that
[1:12:59] proceeds from his mouth
[1:13:00] for with god nothing no rhema shall be
[1:13:04] impossible
[1:13:05] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:13:08] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:13:11] that word that rhema the word that has
[1:13:14] been revealed
[1:13:16] here's what she did with it
[1:13:19] verse 19 of luke 2 mary kept all these
[1:13:22] rhemas
[1:13:25] she accumulated
[1:13:27] she accumulated this
[1:13:29] accumulated she accumulated
[1:13:32] she kept all these things or rhemas of
[1:13:35] god these inspired words and pondered
[1:13:38] them in her heart right well i don't
[1:13:40] have to tell you as believers you go to
[1:13:42] take in the word of god and start
[1:13:43] thinking in your heart and pretty soon
[1:13:45] you're
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:50] i'm not the only one amen
[1:13:53] the presence of god will just draw near
[1:13:56] now it isn't all together when we're
[1:13:57] just thinking on it but as we give
[1:13:59] ourselves to it how the presence of god
[1:14:02] will draw near the bible says draw nigh
[1:14:05] unto god and he will draw nine to you
[1:14:09] and the reason many times we don't have
[1:14:10] the visitations like we should have
[1:14:12] within that is because we got our minds
[1:14:14] on too many other things
[1:14:17] and god help us we've got our face more
[1:14:19] in this stuff
[1:14:21] oh brother samuel i know all the drug
[1:14:23] addicts what about phone addicts
[1:14:27] come on now
[1:14:29] all right
[1:14:30] oh my oh let's say i don't have time no
[1:14:32] no no no we we we realize we do have
[1:14:35] time
[1:14:36] we do have time and i know time
[1:14:38] sometimes it's pressing but we
[1:14:39] understand what we're saying here in
[1:14:41] luke 2 29 lord lord notice simeon is
[1:14:45] praying this lord now let thy servant
[1:14:47] depart in peace according to thy rhema
[1:14:50] that word that you revealed now this
[1:14:52] word was revealed simeon saw it come to
[1:14:55] pass it put him in motion to where he
[1:14:58] got him up out of his office he walked
[1:15:00] down that line of babies that were being
[1:15:02] dedicated that day now after that rhema
[1:15:05] word that god had given to him that had
[1:15:08] inspired him as a branch of god now he
[1:15:10] prays according to what the revelation
[1:15:13] had said you're not going to depart
[1:15:15] until you've seen the lord's christ now
[1:15:17] once that junction of time has happened
[1:15:20] he now begins to pray for his departure
[1:15:25] oh glory be to god
[1:15:27] oh my my my it is something how a saint
[1:15:30] just knows when it's time to go amen
[1:15:32] right sometimes they start talking about
[1:15:34] it start talking about it you know i
[1:15:36] never forget where my dad my dad had
[1:15:37] begun talking about going home he had
[1:15:40] been talking about that for a year or
[1:15:42] over a year and been been asking things
[1:15:44] or been asking mom will you be all right
[1:15:46] and all these other things he had been
[1:15:48] talking about sure he was tired in his
[1:15:50] body but there was also a call where
[1:15:52] there had to be a satisfying that my
[1:15:55] race has been run the course that god
[1:15:58] has called me to do it has been run
[1:16:03] aren't you glad that god has everything
[1:16:05] under control
[1:16:06] notice and simon luke 5 5 speaking of
[1:16:09] peter and simon answering said unto him
[1:16:12] master we have toiled all the night and
[1:16:15] have taken nothing nevertheless and thy
[1:16:18] rhema thy word i will let down the net
[1:16:22] now if anybody else would have said
[1:16:23] anything
[1:16:24] peter what peter was already saying
[1:16:27] we've done this we've been out here all
[1:16:29] night long
[1:16:31] and by the way he was an expert
[1:16:33] fisherman
[1:16:34] he's got a lot of people beatings and
[1:16:36] nowadays that have those trolling motors
[1:16:37] and i've seen been on the boat with a
[1:16:39] lot of the brothers right here from the
[1:16:41] assembly trolling motors and oh my
[1:16:42] there's the school and oh we'll go over
[1:16:44] here hey peter didn't have all that but
[1:16:46] peter was an expert fisherman
[1:16:48] are you with me but he but notice when
[1:16:51] the rhema word from god came he accepted
[1:16:55] that word over his own mental knowledge
[1:16:59] and conception about the things that
[1:17:02] were around him oh i went to god this
[1:17:04] morning that made god so speak to our
[1:17:07] hearts in such a way that we will take
[1:17:10] that above everything else that we see
[1:17:14] around us and rest
[1:17:16] in that word
[1:17:20] john 8 47 jesus said he that is of god
[1:17:24] heareth god's
[1:17:26] ramus
[1:17:27] his words
[1:17:29] therefore hear them not because ye are
[1:17:31] not of god now remember satan does not
[1:17:34] have access to the rhema of god
[1:17:37] he does not have access to that
[1:17:39] theologians don't have access to that
[1:17:42] that is not something that man can sit
[1:17:44] down and study and yet they don't have
[1:17:46] access to that that is sovereignly given
[1:17:49] by god
[1:17:52] is that right
[1:17:53] the father revealeth such
[1:17:56] undebates that right when jesus stood
[1:17:59] there in matthew matthew 16 he said
[1:18:01] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:18:03] unto you but my father which is in
[1:18:04] heaven and upon this rock i will build
[1:18:06] my church so revelation never the
[1:18:09] prophet puts it to us like this
[1:18:11] revelation does not come by natural
[1:18:14] endowments but revelation comes by
[1:18:17] spiritual endowment
[1:18:20] so it takes the dunamis of god the
[1:18:22] spirit of god to move upon the scene and
[1:18:25] notice think of this now god never gets
[1:18:28] ahead of himself
[1:18:29] man can get ahead of god man can get we
[1:18:32] can get so excited my goodness this is
[1:18:34] the time right now and this is the time
[1:18:36] right now we can get excited but
[1:18:38] remember our excitement does not
[1:18:41] speed up nor slow down the program of
[1:18:44] god one bit
[1:18:46] god's program is right on time and when
[1:18:49] god is ready to reveal his word it's in
[1:18:52] that season in that time there would be
[1:18:54] a group of people upon earth and an
[1:18:56] individual that god would have separated
[1:18:59] that god might be able to speak his word
[1:19:02] through his thoughts so that his
[1:19:04] thoughts would be communicated with us
[1:19:06] as his children
[1:19:09] so satan don't have access
[1:19:11] to this part you see it's just like the
[1:19:12] things as paul would write
[1:19:14] that the spirit of man only knows the
[1:19:16] things
[1:19:17] of man
[1:19:18] but it takes the spirit of god to reveal
[1:19:21] the things of god
[1:19:23] is that right and one thing we can be
[1:19:25] sure of is god will reveal it just as we
[1:19:27] have need of it amen
[1:19:29] is that right
[1:19:31] oh my
[1:19:32] oh my thank you lord now notice this
[1:19:34] energy this energizing this same energy
[1:19:38] or energizing this same word that the
[1:19:41] prophet would use over and over to
[1:19:43] energize the vine to our divine
[1:19:45] energizing the branches and energizing
[1:19:47] energizing us in his word this same word
[1:19:50] energize is a word that you use means
[1:19:52] the same thing as the stimulate it's the
[1:19:54] be that of dynamics it's to be that of
[1:19:56] which to fire up or to motivate it's
[1:19:59] which gives us the kinetic energy now
[1:20:01] there's two different types of energies
[1:20:03] i i know most of you here aren't in
[1:20:05] physics i never liked physics myself
[1:20:07] either had too much math in it for me
[1:20:08] but i noticed potential energy and
[1:20:10] kinetic energy potential energy is a
[1:20:13] rock that's just sitting here and you
[1:20:15] can look at it say oh lord if that man
[1:20:17] if that rock falls off boy it's really
[1:20:18] going to take his toe out that's
[1:20:20] potential but kinetic is where the rock
[1:20:23] is falling
[1:20:25] so kinetic energy
[1:20:28] this is what the energy of the vine is
[1:20:31] it comes to inspire us or put us into
[1:20:35] motion it's kind of like the sim card in
[1:20:38] your phone if you we can borrow that for
[1:20:40] a moment when there is a signal that
[1:20:42] comes that signal actually stimulates or
[1:20:45] it livens up or it stirs up and moves to
[1:20:49] speak or to direct the signal to your
[1:20:51] phone nobody else's phone goes off but
[1:20:53] your phone does why it is energized it's
[1:20:56] connected with that signal that's the
[1:20:58] same way it is
[1:21:00] with the economy of god that god is
[1:21:03] inspiring us with a signal from himself
[1:21:08] oh my notice now with that in mind
[1:21:11] notice how that when we would we are
[1:21:13] inspired then to ask the things that we
[1:21:17] need to ask for in john 14 13 and
[1:21:20] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[1:21:22] will i do that the father may be
[1:21:25] glorified in the son if ye shall ask
[1:21:28] anything in my name i
[1:21:31] will do it
[1:21:33] in john 15 16 ye have not chosen me
[1:21:37] but i have chosen you and ordained you
[1:21:40] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:21:43] and that your fruit should remain and
[1:21:46] whatsoever ye shall ask there it is
[1:21:48] again ask of the father in my name he
[1:21:52] may give it to you all right the brother
[1:21:55] brown continues to pick up this text
[1:21:57] that we've read here about the laborers
[1:21:59] in the vineyard and i'm not going to
[1:22:00] read all the parts across the screen but
[1:22:02] i will refer to a few places brother
[1:22:05] brown would say do you know that there's
[1:22:07] some things that we have to do that god
[1:22:10] cannot do until we do it
[1:22:15] god can't do it until we do it
[1:22:18] he furnishes the energy but we got to do
[1:22:21] the job
[1:22:22] he says in other words just a power of
[1:22:24] decision in other words you ask me to do
[1:22:27] what i knows got what ought to be done
[1:22:30] you see he could not do it until they
[1:22:33] asked him to do it
[1:22:36] so god will never override our will but
[1:22:39] here inspiration comes to move upon our
[1:22:42] lives to speak to our hearts the very
[1:22:45] things that god knows what you and i
[1:22:47] have need of not only in our natural
[1:22:49] life but god knows what you and i have
[1:22:52] need of in our spiritual life that we
[1:22:55] might continue to grow more and more and
[1:22:58] more into his image god even knows even
[1:23:01] decisions that is laying before us
[1:23:04] tomorrow or in the future and god is
[1:23:07] there to inspire our lives that we might
[1:23:10] begin to ask that we would seek after
[1:23:12] him so when that decision would come
[1:23:14] around we are under the influence of
[1:23:18] asking him for his will
[1:23:21] now think of this i've chosen you and
[1:23:24] ordained you you know
[1:23:26] sometimes you know and i think it's just
[1:23:28] let me just say it this way it's
[1:23:30] sometimes it can become so much within
[1:23:33] our thinking
[1:23:34] and we look at it in a manner of how
[1:23:37] that
[1:23:38] you know it's just as though that well
[1:23:39] you know things are going to take place
[1:23:41] and god's going to do this and god's
[1:23:43] going to do this and god's going to do
[1:23:44] that but in reality remember he cannot
[1:23:47] do anything unless we first ask him or
[1:23:51] he inspires us you see god will never
[1:23:53] override somebody's will and say oh no
[1:23:55] you don't want the holy ghost no you're
[1:23:56] going to get the holy ghost no lord i
[1:23:58] really i'm not asking for it right now
[1:23:59] no no no no you're going to get it now
[1:24:01] we realize listen now there is how the
[1:24:04] spirit of god can move and it's not so
[1:24:06] much about these lips right here asking
[1:24:08] it's the spirit of god can recognize
[1:24:10] even while the word is going forth that
[1:24:13] the spirit of god it's one way it can
[1:24:16] fall right into a person's life and that
[1:24:18] light will be completely changed just
[1:24:20] like it was in the house of cornelius is
[1:24:22] that right just like it was there even
[1:24:24] in ephesus it can happen in that way but
[1:24:27] remember it didn't always happen that
[1:24:28] way there were other times where hands
[1:24:30] were laid upon them is that right this
[1:24:33] is why brother graham said there's no
[1:24:35] set pattern
[1:24:37] there's no set pattern but this is why
[1:24:40] that the spirit of god dealing within a
[1:24:42] life it moves upon our heart really it's
[1:24:44] the heart that begins to call out it's
[1:24:46] the heart that begins to yearn it's the
[1:24:48] heart that god is speaking to and then
[1:24:51] from out of our life then comes forth
[1:24:53] the request of asking what god is
[1:24:56] dealing with in our life
[1:24:58] so the chosen and ordained to bear much
[1:25:01] fruit does not mean that it's just going
[1:25:03] to happen
[1:25:04] all right
[1:25:05] it's just going to happen
[1:25:08] but it rather it requires
[1:25:10] seeking and asking
[1:25:14] think how you look at every look at the
[1:25:17] patriarchs
[1:25:18] look at the matriarchs in the scripture
[1:25:21] it was not god never overrode their will
[1:25:26] but they were pulled they were drawn
[1:25:28] by him
[1:25:31] ruth forsook the land of her nativity
[1:25:35] because she caught a vision she
[1:25:37] something that grabbed the whole of her
[1:25:38] your god will be my god right were you
[1:25:40] elijah lodge
[1:25:42] she was willing to forsake the land
[1:25:44] of moab
[1:25:46] see
[1:25:47] god begin to move upon that life so he
[1:25:50] cannot do it until they ask him
[1:25:52] to do it right
[1:25:55] brother ben tells us in my new ministry
[1:25:57] he's talking about god's program he says
[1:25:59] god has so arranged it that his program
[1:26:03] cannot move
[1:26:04] without you or if
[1:26:08] he can't move without us that's right
[1:26:12] and as long as we're not doing what god
[1:26:14] leads us to do
[1:26:16] we're paralyzing
[1:26:17] his program
[1:26:19] but when the church moves by the
[1:26:21] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:26:24] then we're in god's will
[1:26:26] doing his program
[1:26:28] so to move under the anointing of the
[1:26:31] holy ghost to move under where lives
[1:26:34] have been authorized and set aside by
[1:26:37] the holy spirit and put into service
[1:26:39] walking under the anointing of the holy
[1:26:42] ghost it brings us into that place now
[1:26:46] to follow his leading and to seek after
[1:26:48] his leading listen when the holy spirit
[1:26:51] has come the bible his he reveals
[1:26:53] himself as the spirit of truth he will
[1:26:56] lead and guide us into all truth not
[1:26:58] pull us into all truth not push us into
[1:27:01] all truth not drag us into all truth
[1:27:05] lead us into all truth amen this is why
[1:27:08] the scripture said be not like that of
[1:27:11] the horse that the got to be put
[1:27:13] in our mouths
[1:27:14] sometimes we've had to have to have a
[1:27:16] bit but that we don't want to have to
[1:27:18] have a bit put in our mouth we are
[1:27:20] compared in solomon one one that we i
[1:27:23] have compared the oh my beloved to one
[1:27:26] of pharaoh's horses in his chariots a
[1:27:29] thoroughbred
[1:27:31] one who knows who his papa and his mama
[1:27:33] is he's got pedigree he's got papers can
[1:27:36] trace it all the way back
[1:27:40] god's program
[1:27:44] and say god help us we don't want to be
[1:27:45] paralyzing his program
[1:27:47] we want to do what he's leading us to do
[1:27:50] and god doesn't do anything without man
[1:27:54] he goes on he says and identified christ
[1:27:56] of all ages in 64 referring to the same
[1:27:59] thing you have not because you ask not
[1:28:01] you ask not because you believe not
[1:28:04] ask abundance that your choice might be
[1:28:07] full he is depending on you asking and
[1:28:10] believing that you receive what you ask
[1:28:13] for all right
[1:28:16] charles spurgeon i mean who charles
[1:28:18] spurgeon is right oh man i'm a great man
[1:28:21] of god too
[1:28:22] charles spurgeon wasn't a messenger but
[1:28:24] he's a great man of god
[1:28:26] charles spurgeon here's look at charles
[1:28:28] spurgeon
[1:28:29] a man of prayer what he would say he
[1:28:31] says whether we like it or not asking is
[1:28:34] the rule
[1:28:35] of the kingdom
[1:28:38] there is no other way ask ask ask ask
[1:28:42] ask
[1:28:43] god don't get tired of you asking
[1:28:46] that thrills him when you ask him amen
[1:28:50] well i might ask him for something too
[1:28:52] big you can't you can't ask him for
[1:28:55] something too big remember to god the
[1:28:58] big things are just as easy as the
[1:29:01] little things
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:04] we're encouraged to ask for big things
[1:29:11] it's a partnership now let me let me
[1:29:13] kind of bring this down home a little
[1:29:14] bit now a little bit more
[1:29:16] remember it's a partnership
[1:29:18] god
[1:29:19] right there in those texts that we read
[1:29:22] god
[1:29:22] is setting forth a partnership
[1:29:25] with man
[1:29:28] so now
[1:29:29] it brings us to a place
[1:29:31] of realizing
[1:29:33] lord
[1:29:34] my life
[1:29:36] is to be moved
[1:29:38] and to be in fellowship with you not not
[1:29:40] just when we come to the house of god
[1:29:42] but daily in our life
[1:29:45] but even more so knowing
[1:29:48] that what god would speak right here
[1:29:50] when we come together
[1:29:52] god gives direction
[1:29:55] god gives leadership right
[1:29:58] is that right
[1:30:01] so
[1:30:02] now it brings it to a place
[1:30:05] of praying and seeking
[1:30:07] for every service all right
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:11] you see when you're praying for
[1:30:12] something
[1:30:13] then you're expecting something right
[1:30:18] but a sure
[1:30:19] of of no expectation is no prayer
[1:30:26] so prayer
[1:30:27] when prayer is being is being offered up
[1:30:30] because it's not just random it's it's
[1:30:32] where coming before god and there's
[1:30:34] things that we are speaking we're
[1:30:36] communing we are asking him bringing to
[1:30:40] him the things that he is making known
[1:30:43] to us
[1:30:46] so every service every service should
[1:30:49] provide things very personally right
[1:30:52] that you and i would pray
[1:30:54] and seek after the lord in our own lives
[1:30:57] and the reason i say with praying and
[1:30:58] seeking because
[1:31:01] when we see his greatness
[1:31:05] and we see our insufficiency as brother
[1:31:06] branham put it at his feast of the
[1:31:08] trumpets
[1:31:09] or rather our inability to accomplish
[1:31:13] what he's
[1:31:14] asking and there's a good there's a good
[1:31:17] place within that to recognize our
[1:31:19] inability
[1:31:20] that's what drives us to prayer
[1:31:23] amen that's what drives us to pray
[1:31:29] i want you to think of this here the
[1:31:31] scripture would say
[1:31:33] i just want to try to get to a few a few
[1:31:35] places the scriptures in matthew 6
[1:31:39] how matthew 6
[1:31:41] 6 can i have just a little bit here
[1:31:44] i don't want to i don't want to be
[1:31:45] rushed within this in this spot and i
[1:31:48] notice matthew 6 6 when thou prayest
[1:31:51] enter into thy closet
[1:31:55] when thou has shut the door pray to the
[1:31:58] father which is in secret so it's an
[1:32:00] entering in
[1:32:02] there's an entrance there we are
[1:32:04] entering into a secret place with god
[1:32:09] listen
[1:32:10] you can even be in a secret place with
[1:32:12] god sitting in your car that's right
[1:32:16] are you hearing me now because closing
[1:32:18] here you the closing is in you going and
[1:32:19] clearing out a bunch of clothes out of
[1:32:21] one of your closets and then trying to
[1:32:22] cram yourself in there it's about
[1:32:24] entering in in other words going past
[1:32:28] all of the oh
[1:32:30] oh i just feel so tired oh my you know
[1:32:32] the flesh doesn't feel like praying or
[1:32:34] the listen the flesh never feels like
[1:32:36] prey
[1:32:39] okay it never does this is why brother
[1:32:41] bram said it's so easy to get away from
[1:32:43] praying and reading
[1:32:45] because the flesh is weak
[1:32:48] the lord jesus in a very climatic moment
[1:32:51] he asked the disciples while he's on the
[1:32:53] mountain hey watch and pray all right
[1:32:56] comes back
[1:32:58] all right
[1:33:01] all right it's like the challenge of
[1:33:02] this hour we're in
[1:33:05] listen the pressures that are all around
[1:33:07] us
[1:33:09] sometimes we look and say oh my you know
[1:33:11] the food we're eating yeah i understand
[1:33:13] there's a lot of things going on but
[1:33:15] it's not just food you can eat all the
[1:33:17] organic food you want but there's still
[1:33:19] pressures because this is not natural
[1:33:23] flesh and blood it is demonic forces in
[1:33:27] revelations 9 the lid of hell has been
[1:33:31] taken off
[1:33:34] but the bible says in revelations 10 1
[1:33:37] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:33:44] hallelujah god will never be out done
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:56] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:33:59] shall reward thee open
[1:34:03] i don't want to there's more to labor on
[1:34:04] that verse but i just want to get to
[1:34:06] this these places here
[1:34:08] he says in verse 7 don't use vain
[1:34:10] repetitions as heathen do
[1:34:15] god isn't heard by you repeating
[1:34:18] i'm going to repeat or i'm going to
[1:34:20] repeat i'm going to repeat no god isn't
[1:34:22] hurt by repeating all right
[1:34:25] you say well what does that mean it's
[1:34:27] god is here look what he's saying here
[1:34:29] for they think they shall be heard for
[1:34:30] them much speaking but bill be like that
[1:34:33] for your father knoweth what things you
[1:34:35] have need of before you ask you're
[1:34:37] asking what you know that he's making
[1:34:40] known you have need of and you're coming
[1:34:43] to him in faith amen
[1:34:45] and you're talking to him like a man all
[1:34:48] right amen
[1:34:50] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[1:34:54] after this manner therefore pray ye our
[1:34:56] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[1:34:59] thy name worship all right amen
[1:35:02] worship
[1:35:03] brother samuel i've got a bucket list of
[1:35:05] requests start with worship right amen
[1:35:08] that's right
[1:35:10] charles spurgeon also said in one place
[1:35:12] he said there's one one quick thing for
[1:35:15] prayer denial and that's cold formal
[1:35:18] prayers
[1:35:20] loaded requests
[1:35:22] and sometimes we have a lot of requests
[1:35:24] but praying isn't always about requests
[1:35:28] the bible and always in the scripture it
[1:35:30] says
[1:35:31] to to making known that your prayer the
[1:35:35] prayer and supplication
[1:35:37] so there's worship that goes for it now
[1:35:39] notice
[1:35:40] thy kingdom come here's the request
[1:35:42] thy kingdom come
[1:35:44] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:35:47] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[1:35:51] so we are longing for that time to come
[1:35:54] we're not here living endlessly we are
[1:35:57] living with a purpose life for the
[1:36:00] rapture right amen
[1:36:03] we are looking for that at any moment in
[1:36:06] any twinkling of an eye amen and so for
[1:36:09] this moment
[1:36:10] i need the daily bread that's needed for
[1:36:14] this moment
[1:36:15] i need the divine energy from almighty
[1:36:18] god the rhema word that's needed for
[1:36:21] this moment to minister to the need in
[1:36:24] my life to meet the challenge that god
[1:36:27] would let me know what he wants me to
[1:36:29] ask him for right now
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:32] thank you lord
[1:36:34] and i want to just say i want to just
[1:36:35] dwell on this just a moment
[1:36:39] it struck me after i
[1:36:41] believe it was last week and i just
[1:36:43] struck me as i'm just here on the
[1:36:44] platform
[1:36:47] and we know
[1:36:50] i want you to say i want you to catch
[1:36:52] this
[1:36:54] the lord jesus would speak to you and i
[1:36:56] and say
[1:36:59] ask
[1:37:00] and you shall receive
[1:37:04] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:37:09] you're trying
[1:37:11] the desire to gain entrance a desire
[1:37:14] that you have a desire
[1:37:16] in him
[1:37:17] that only he
[1:37:19] can fulfill
[1:37:21] so here
[1:37:23] we pray for revelation
[1:37:27] as a matter of fact
[1:37:28] as brother brown would state it
[1:37:30] revelation is more important to you us
[1:37:35] and he said perhaps you realize
[1:37:37] we've looked at a few few places within
[1:37:39] that
[1:37:40] but revelation
[1:37:42] is very important
[1:37:44] amen but i don't want you
[1:37:47] to think of revelation
[1:37:49] as just mysteries
[1:37:54] because there's one revelation
[1:37:56] that is the absolute
[1:37:58] necessity
[1:38:00] and the center of all revelations and
[1:38:02] that's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] a school can't teach that amen
[1:38:12] that that
[1:38:14] is
[1:38:15] god himself here giving that revelation
[1:38:18] personally as he gave it to john that's
[1:38:21] the same way he does to every child of
[1:38:25] god
[1:38:26] him
[1:38:27] sure you can hear the word but it takes
[1:38:29] god to open amen
[1:38:32] it takes god to unfold that
[1:38:35] so but praying for revelation
[1:38:40] is not just to understand
[1:38:43] all the mysteries
[1:38:46] because a person could understand all
[1:38:48] mysteries and still not have the love of
[1:38:51] god the holy ghost
[1:38:54] judas had understanding in all the
[1:38:55] mysteries right
[1:38:57] yeah
[1:38:58] hey
[1:39:00] judas could have judas could have had
[1:39:01] held bible studies and explained the
[1:39:03] mysteries wide open
[1:39:05] knowledge of them all right
[1:39:07] that's right
[1:39:09] right
[1:39:10] you had understanding
[1:39:14] but the revelation is when we're
[1:39:16] speaking of it isn't confined to just
[1:39:19] understanding mysteries but it's rather
[1:39:22] it's looking to the lord who knows what
[1:39:24] we have need of yes amen
[1:39:29] i want you to think of this when samson
[1:39:31] was being when samson here was conceived
[1:39:35] by the noah
[1:39:37] and his
[1:39:38] and and manoa's wife samson's mother
[1:39:41] the angel of the lord came to them and
[1:39:43] let them know
[1:39:45] what
[1:39:46] the manner of the child was and what you
[1:39:48] shall do
[1:39:51] and manoa said
[1:39:52] ask him to come back
[1:39:55] see god
[1:39:57] holds
[1:39:58] the mystery and the plan for our lives
[1:40:02] yes
[1:40:03] amen
[1:40:04] it's god unfolding
[1:40:07] himself
[1:40:08] and unfolding our lives
[1:40:13] so we're praying for revelation
[1:40:16] i want you to want you to catch this
[1:40:18] in revelation in psalms 27
[1:40:22] is everybody okay
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:25] in psalms 27
[1:40:29] i don't want to read all these
[1:40:30] scriptures
[1:40:31] but david is declaring who the lord is
[1:40:35] to him
[1:40:37] he is my strength
[1:40:39] my life amen
[1:40:41] he is the light of my life
[1:40:46] then david describes
[1:40:49] all of the
[1:40:50] encroachments of the adversary
[1:40:54] trying to come upon his life to consume
[1:40:57] his life
[1:40:59] but notice in the midst
[1:41:02] of the encampment encirclement
[1:41:06] and and coming after his life notice
[1:41:10] what speaks forth out of his life in
[1:41:12] verse 4 in psalms 27
[1:41:15] one thing have i desired of the lord and
[1:41:20] that will i seek after
[1:41:26] i'm desiring it and i'm going to seek
[1:41:28] after it i'll be seeking after it
[1:41:31] tomorrow seeking after in the next hour
[1:41:34] seeking after the next month i'm going
[1:41:36] to keep on seeking after this because
[1:41:39] this is the one thing that i've desired
[1:41:42] amen
[1:41:43] what is it david that i may dwell in the
[1:41:46] house of the lord all the days of my
[1:41:49] life
[1:41:51] amen his desire was to be
[1:41:54] right in the presence of almighty god
[1:41:57] don't just don't limit this and say oh
[1:41:59] inside of a church no we're talking
[1:42:01] about the true house of god which is the
[1:42:05] lord jesus christ which is his body his
[1:42:08] spirit dwelling in a many-membered body
[1:42:12] whose house we are
[1:42:14] it's dwelling in his presence in his
[1:42:17] life dwelling in the word david said i
[1:42:20] don't want to miss anything
[1:42:22] i want to be right in step amen
[1:42:24] i want to be right there when i read my
[1:42:25] word is being given i want to be ready
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:29] i don't want to be so distracted with oh
[1:42:31] look what the enemies are doing oh my
[1:42:32] goodness look what's going on look i
[1:42:34] don't want to be destroyed i know that's
[1:42:35] all out there i can feel the hot breath
[1:42:37] wanting to come down my neck but there's
[1:42:40] one thing that i have desired these
[1:42:42] things are trying to distract and take
[1:42:44] away but there's one thing that i've
[1:42:46] desired and that that will i seek after
[1:42:49] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:42:51] lord all the days of my life do what
[1:42:53] david to be whole amen the beauty of the
[1:42:58] lord amen and to inquire
[1:43:02] in his temple amen
[1:43:07] probably most of you are like maybe
[1:43:08] maybe you're not maybe you are maybe
[1:43:10] you're not
[1:43:14] i like art
[1:43:16] but art can bore me awful fast
[1:43:19] don't try to be spiritualized on me or
[1:43:20] nothing there's a certain other things
[1:43:22] can bore you quickly too if i started
[1:43:24] talking about hunting you might say
[1:43:25] oh
[1:43:26] god bless you this time i'll see you on
[1:43:28] thursday
[1:43:29] we have our natural likes or whatever
[1:43:32] i can go through certain things you know
[1:43:34] when we've been over the cleveland
[1:43:35] museum of art
[1:43:37] and i can go through there look at
[1:43:38] certain things and
[1:43:40] look at this and
[1:43:42] and you know there's some things you
[1:43:43] could just we just walk right by
[1:43:45] but then there's other things that catch
[1:43:47] you
[1:43:49] and you give more time to that than you
[1:43:52] do to any other display
[1:43:55] you see to behold the scripture says to
[1:43:57] behold david said this is why i want to
[1:44:00] dwell in the household that i might be
[1:44:02] whole that i might gaze
[1:44:04] look into
[1:44:06] the beauty
[1:44:08] the character
[1:44:10] of the lord
[1:44:11] his favor
[1:44:13] why because as i'm looking upon him
[1:44:17] i will be
[1:44:18] changed from glory unto glory amen
[1:44:24] david there's a lot of distractors i
[1:44:25] know
[1:44:27] but this is why i'm seeking after it
[1:44:29] daily
[1:44:31] because if i can behold his beauty be
[1:44:34] focused
[1:44:36] just captivated with that
[1:44:38] then notice what happens and to
[1:44:42] inquire
[1:44:44] at his temple
[1:44:46] to inquire means to make a request
[1:44:50] so things that i'm seeing
[1:44:53] causes me to start to inquire
[1:44:56] so as i'm beholding him
[1:44:59] it raises up within me there's
[1:45:01] inspiration to say lord
[1:45:03] be it unto me lord yes amen grant it
[1:45:06] lord let
[1:45:07] let my life be filled
[1:45:09] with more of the love of god amen
[1:45:12] help me lord jesus in my life lord give
[1:45:14] me strength lord in this area of
[1:45:17] overcoming my life now notice not just
[1:45:19] say it and walk away but behold
[1:45:21] to behold him
[1:45:23] to stay upon it
[1:45:25] in sincerity
[1:45:27] there are some things that have
[1:45:29] from our life just like that
[1:45:32] and then there's other things that
[1:45:35] stands out to us now
[1:45:37] god deals with our life about it and it
[1:45:39] stands out to a place we say lord
[1:45:42] i really want to overcome this
[1:45:44] what does it do now it's beholding
[1:45:46] in sincerity
[1:45:48] you're inquiring
[1:45:50] in his temple right now
[1:45:54] hold on
[1:45:56] this word to inquire it means to seek
[1:46:00] it means to look for
[1:46:02] it means to
[1:46:04] reflect
[1:46:07] there's one thing we could probably do
[1:46:08] more
[1:46:09] a better job on is reflect
[1:46:13] reflection sometimes
[1:46:16] that's where we've got to look and say
[1:46:19] just not hitting the mark just right
[1:46:20] here where it ought to be
[1:46:22] reflection
[1:46:24] reflection they used to have when i was
[1:46:26] in teaching methods before i ever went
[1:46:28] into student teaching they would have us
[1:46:30] write these big old lesson plans and i'd
[1:46:32] have to have a little section about like
[1:46:33] this little section and every time i
[1:46:35] taught this section of the lesson i had
[1:46:37] to write a paragraph
[1:46:39] after that lesson was over
[1:46:41] it was all about reflection
[1:46:43] did i do that when i got my own
[1:46:44] classroom no but you see that was
[1:46:46] framework
[1:46:47] teaching me right
[1:46:49] that good teaching there's reflection
[1:46:52] just like when what you do within your
[1:46:54] job or field of work mom dad whatever
[1:46:57] there's reflection within it
[1:47:00] there's reflection
[1:47:01] in our life
[1:47:03] and i'm grateful when we reflect oh we
[1:47:05] can look and we can see an image and we
[1:47:07] say oh god lord i i'm so ashamed lord i
[1:47:10] i don't like what i'm saying but if
[1:47:11] we'll look
[1:47:13] look into that perfect law of liberty
[1:47:17] and ask him
[1:47:19] he can change us amen
[1:47:22] give us strength in our life
[1:47:26] taking inventory
[1:47:28] in our lives
[1:47:30] this is why the scripture said
[1:47:32] in psalms 37 4 delight thyself also
[1:47:36] in the lord
[1:47:38] i tell you what a contrast to the day
[1:47:40] that we're living in
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:44] it's a day think of it it's a day about
[1:47:47] do you
[1:47:49] just do me
[1:47:51] you
[1:47:51] too
[1:47:55] everything is everything is about
[1:47:59] just do as you feel
[1:48:04] the heart is deceitful
[1:48:07] above all things
[1:48:09] but i the lord do try the reigns of the
[1:48:12] heart
[1:48:16] you see
[1:48:17] we think of this with with revelation
[1:48:20] this is where we have to ask in our own
[1:48:22] lives
[1:48:23] because
[1:48:25] you see the things that we see church
[1:48:28] will keep us in fellowship that's true
[1:48:31] that's true brother brahms are coming to
[1:48:32] church it'll keep you in fellowship
[1:48:35] with one another
[1:48:38] but you see without a prayer life
[1:48:41] that is sincere and consecrated after
[1:48:44] the things of the lord
[1:48:46] that he's unfolding and you're beholding
[1:48:49] without a prayer life
[1:48:50] you'll never grow
[1:48:54] you'll never grow
[1:48:56] we'll never grow
[1:48:58] but it's prayer
[1:48:59] god has entrusted what he reveals
[1:49:03] is god is entrusting us to pray
[1:49:06] over those things
[1:49:08] you see this is where we we take
[1:49:10] inventory we we must ask questions in
[1:49:13] our own lives
[1:49:15] are we praying for revelation
[1:49:17] are we seeking for more of god no let's
[1:49:20] just be honest let's just be honest
[1:49:22] there are entrapments to get us into the
[1:49:25] rat race of life
[1:49:29] right sometimes there's seasons in life
[1:49:32] i remember for some as you go through
[1:49:34] sometimes you've got to go through
[1:49:35] training on your job
[1:49:36] i was going through college sometimes
[1:49:38] there's busier time but it's not a
[1:49:40] busyness that you're creating it's a
[1:49:43] season
[1:49:45] but this
[1:49:46] the enemy wants to bring entrapments to
[1:49:48] where the focus becomes off of the lord
[1:49:52] you say brother samuel but i've got a
[1:49:54] family it's all the more reason to
[1:49:56] behold
[1:49:57] the beauty of the lord and to inquire
[1:50:01] because where your direction is
[1:50:04] your family's direction will be also
[1:50:07] is to set that direction to set the
[1:50:09] course and not allow the world to
[1:50:11] dictate
[1:50:12] what can be done in our lives
[1:50:16] we have to take that that very
[1:50:17] purposeful in our lives everybody okay
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:21] i know this is just seeds you see just
[1:50:23] fallen but i want to
[1:50:25] the seed would drop
[1:50:27] see his prayer
[1:50:29] god bring inspiration it sets in motion
[1:50:34] remember how i remember with elijah
[1:50:35] elijah prayed earnestly he spoke the
[1:50:37] word but then he prayed earnestly that
[1:50:39] it would not rain
[1:50:40] his prayer wasn't like oh lord i slept
[1:50:43] out here and i spoke no he spoke
[1:50:44] according to what god told him to speak
[1:50:46] but after the word had been spoken he
[1:50:48] prayed earnestly what was he doing
[1:50:50] according to the word
[1:50:53] that was in him that was spoke out
[1:50:56] the lord jesus stood before
[1:50:58] the the grave of lazarus
[1:51:02] we know what takes place
[1:51:04] he says lazarus come forth the same
[1:51:07] almighty god that was more than a man
[1:51:09] could have also said stone be rolled
[1:51:12] away
[1:51:13] but instead
[1:51:14] he picks two
[1:51:16] women
[1:51:19] jesus
[1:51:21] surely you could have got the burly guys
[1:51:22] up there to roll away the stone no no
[1:51:25] he's wanting to show see that shows
[1:51:26] their faith
[1:51:28] in his presence
[1:51:30] take away the storm
[1:51:33] i don't know
[1:51:34] i don't believe they were
[1:51:35] big strapping you know they walked up
[1:51:37] there and martha mary walking up there
[1:51:39] you know and walking up but i believe
[1:51:42] they were inspired
[1:51:44] and the task before them looked like
[1:51:47] more than what they can do but they were
[1:51:49] inspired to go beyond limitation
[1:51:54] and roll away the stone
[1:51:56] they had something to do we have a part
[1:51:59] to do
[1:52:01] that revelation that as we pray for
[1:52:03] revelation it's that we might know god's
[1:52:05] will
[1:52:06] for healing for understanding
[1:52:09] for family life
[1:52:11] salvation for deliverance for needs
[1:52:15] to remind you the pharisees
[1:52:17] i'm closing
[1:52:20] and i'm making my descent
[1:52:25] the pharisees had a prayer life now stay
[1:52:28] with me
[1:52:30] the pharisees had a prayer life
[1:52:35] brother samuel you're saying the
[1:52:36] pharisees had a prayer life
[1:52:38] jesus said they made prayers in widows
[1:52:41] houses for a long time
[1:52:45] and he also brought up
[1:52:48] in these guys their prayers
[1:52:51] really they never left the ground
[1:52:54] because jesus said in these prayers
[1:52:56] all they talked about was themselves
[1:52:59] lord
[1:53:00] i thank you that i'm not like that guy
[1:53:02] right
[1:53:04] are you hearing me now
[1:53:06] so what i'm saying they had prayer
[1:53:09] and you could say my they pray a lot
[1:53:11] mind they pray you couldn't have put a
[1:53:13] finger
[1:53:14] if you're gonna come down this way do
[1:53:15] they have a prayer life but we realize
[1:53:18] that prayer life
[1:53:19] is more than just going through the
[1:53:22] motion
[1:53:24] it's entering in and getting in contact
[1:53:27] with god because of all their praying
[1:53:30] they missed him
[1:53:34] and of all their prey they called him
[1:53:37] beelzebub
[1:53:40] weren't getting before the throne
[1:53:42] right they had all their long
[1:53:44] philanthropies and everything else that
[1:53:46] was walking around but they weren't
[1:53:48] getting before the throne all right
[1:53:53] think of this now
[1:53:57] remember when they came to the lord
[1:53:58] jesus
[1:54:01] they said
[1:54:04] you know your disciples don't pray and
[1:54:06] fast
[1:54:10] you guys must not believe in praying
[1:54:12] fasting no more no no they believed in
[1:54:13] praying and fasting still
[1:54:16] but you see
[1:54:17] the pharisees raised that question
[1:54:19] and what it was they were still praying
[1:54:22] and fasting looking for
[1:54:25] the very thing
[1:54:26] that was there
[1:54:30] this is why the spirit of god threw the
[1:54:32] prophet in this hour in recognizing
[1:54:35] the day in its message he spoke of the
[1:54:37] voice of healing and he said they'll
[1:54:39] hardly print anything except press fast
[1:54:41] pray fast pray god will send a great
[1:54:44] move on elijah and he said what it is
[1:54:46] they're christians and they feel the
[1:54:48] pull of the hour
[1:54:50] but they've not recognized god is
[1:54:53] fulfilling his word
[1:54:54] right now
[1:54:56] so we're praying and fasting but we're
[1:54:58] not praying and fasting looking for a
[1:55:01] great revival to come we are praying and
[1:55:03] fasting in contact with the living god
[1:55:06] the bread groom who is dwelling in his
[1:55:09] pride body we have come in full of you
[1:55:13] amen of our bridegroom we know in whom
[1:55:16] we have believed
[1:55:18] we are praying and fasting and seeking
[1:55:20] after the revealed will of god that's
[1:55:22] being made known to our lives
[1:55:25] we have found him
[1:55:28] hallelujah
[1:55:31] so
[1:55:33] my feet are
[1:55:34] preparing to touch the ground on this
[1:55:36] one
[1:55:38] philippians 2 12.
[1:55:45] wherefore my beloved as ye have also
[1:55:47] obeyed
[1:55:48] not as in my presence only but now much
[1:55:51] more
[1:55:52] in my absence
[1:55:54] work out
[1:55:55] your own salvation
[1:55:58] with fear and trembling
[1:56:03] lord me
[1:56:06] to work out my own salvation with fear
[1:56:09] and trembling
[1:56:11] their words fear and trembling means one
[1:56:14] who distrusts
[1:56:16] his own
[1:56:17] ability
[1:56:20] amen
[1:56:22] for it is god which worketh in you both
[1:56:26] to will
[1:56:27] notice both to will
[1:56:29] see it's god in you to will and to do
[1:56:33] you see it isn't our will
[1:56:35] it's his will
[1:56:38] that it's moving through our will so
[1:56:40] it's not my will my will surrendered
[1:56:42] your will surrender to his will it is
[1:56:44] his will
[1:56:46] to do
[1:56:57] this word this part here let me just
[1:57:01] read in verse 12. can i read that
[1:57:03] amplified
[1:57:07] my dear ones as you have always obeyed
[1:57:09] my suggestions
[1:57:10] for the morning suggestions these are
[1:57:13] these are words paul said let anyone who
[1:57:15] spiritually acknowledges the things that
[1:57:16] i write into you i commandments
[1:57:18] of god
[1:57:20] so now not now not only with the
[1:57:22] enthusiasm you would show in my presence
[1:57:24] but much more because i'm absent work
[1:57:26] out
[1:57:28] cultivate
[1:57:29] carry out to the goal and fully complete
[1:57:32] your own salvation with reverence and
[1:57:34] awe and trembling
[1:57:36] which is self-distrust with serious
[1:57:38] caution tenderness of conscience
[1:57:40] watchfulness against temptation timidly
[1:57:42] shrinking from whatever might offend god
[1:57:44] and discredit the name of christ
[1:57:46] verse 13
[1:57:48] not in your own strength for it is god
[1:57:51] who is all the while effectually at work
[1:57:54] in you i love this
[1:57:56] energizing
[1:57:58] and creating in you the power
[1:58:00] and desire
[1:58:03] it's god raising up the desire
[1:58:06] on the inside of you
[1:58:08] both to will and to work for his own
[1:58:10] good pleasure and satisfaction and
[1:58:11] delight
[1:58:13] brother branham says this recognizing
[1:58:16] your day and its message
[1:58:20] he's in prayer and if you go to
[1:58:21] paragraph 237 i just just cut down to
[1:58:24] that
[1:58:26] he says god
[1:58:30] create in me a revival with ram's
[1:58:33] personal prayer with the congregation
[1:58:35] let me be the revival
[1:58:38] let each one of us be the revival
[1:58:40] the revival
[1:58:42] in me
[1:58:43] make me lord to hunger
[1:58:46] they can say yes lord i just gonna put
[1:58:48] my hand up make me lord to hunger
[1:58:51] make me to thirst
[1:58:53] create in me lord that what is needed in
[1:58:57] me
[1:58:58] let me from this hour on be thine more
[1:59:02] consecrated servant
[1:59:04] a better servant more blessed of you
[1:59:07] more able more humbler
[1:59:10] more kinder
[1:59:11] more willing to work
[1:59:13] more looking to the things that are
[1:59:14] positive and forgetting the things that
[1:59:16] are in the past and the negatives let me
[1:59:19] press
[1:59:20] towards the mark
[1:59:22] of the high calling
[1:59:24] in christ jesus
[1:59:28] and say amen
[1:59:31] amen
[1:59:33] help me lord amen
[1:59:35] that i can lord get out of the way that
[1:59:38] the part that i'm to fulfill in the
[1:59:39] kingdom
[1:59:40] which is you
[1:59:42] working through me that i can
[1:59:45] yield myself lord
[1:59:48] yield myself placing myself just the
[1:59:51] things that you're speaking to my heart
[1:59:53] and give myself to that word
[1:59:56] that you're speaking to me
[2:00:00] see no matter where where where in our
[2:00:02] lives where
[2:00:03] a person no matter where you be god
[2:00:05] speaks to all
[2:00:07] all
[2:00:09] right they'll be sitting here no matter
[2:00:11] where you're at
[2:00:12] in your walk with god
[2:00:15] if you've if you've never surrendered
[2:00:17] your life to the lord this is a good
[2:00:19] opportunity to surrender it and to
[2:00:22] accept what the lord jesus christ has
[2:00:25] already done for you
[2:00:29] it will it would be the fitting thing
[2:00:32] to repent
[2:00:34] and ask the lord jesus to forgive you of
[2:00:36] your sins
[2:00:38] it would be a fitting time
[2:00:41] to make ready to walk into the waters of
[2:00:43] baptism
[2:00:45] it would be a fitting moment in this
[2:00:47] time that if you've come into that place
[2:00:49] and there's desires and things of the
[2:00:51] world that you can it's a fitting time
[2:00:54] to ask
[2:00:55] the almighty god to say lord
[2:00:59] clean my life
[2:01:02] cleanse me lord
[2:01:05] cleanse me by your spirit lord jesus
[2:01:08] create lord god remove every desire of
[2:01:12] everything of the world lord out of my
[2:01:15] life lord all i want is you let be word
[2:01:18] on top a word on top of word until i'm
[2:01:20] fully in that image oh god
[2:01:22] this would be the moment to ask for that
[2:01:25] say lord god the holy ghost belongs to
[2:01:27] me as a child of god lord i lay claim
[2:01:31] on that lord jesus and not just to name
[2:01:33] and claim it but my life is inspired
[2:01:36] god has let me know it belongs to me i'm
[2:01:39] not asking for something that he hasn't
[2:01:42] said to me i'm asking for him who has
[2:01:44] took me out and i've seen my life
[2:01:48] hallelujah as he showed them the field
[2:01:51] that was ready for harvest i've seen my
[2:01:52] life he's took me on a personal tour and
[2:01:55] asked me and said
[2:01:57] do you not see this praise god but he's
[2:02:00] not done that to shame me
[2:02:03] he's done it
[2:02:05] because he wants to help me amen
[2:02:08] he shows little things he shows things
[2:02:10] in our life not to shame us
[2:02:14] but that we might say lord
[2:02:16] help me
[2:02:18] and we give ourselves
[2:02:20] beholding him oh we're not beholding our
[2:02:23] mistakes we're not beholding the things
[2:02:24] that he's calling out we're beholding
[2:02:26] him
[2:02:27] when you want to see a counterfeit
[2:02:30] what do you do
[2:02:32] what do you do when you want to see it
[2:02:33] you want to know whether is it a
[2:02:35] counterfeit bill or not what do you do
[2:02:37] get a real one that's right amen
[2:02:40] get a real one that's why the holy ghost
[2:02:42] the real image of the living god the
[2:02:44] word image this is why here we are as
[2:02:47] we're looking upon him it's reflecting
[2:02:49] in our life and we can see well this is
[2:02:51] lacking or that is lacking and as we
[2:02:54] give ourselves to almighty god he gives
[2:02:56] us strength within our lives to where
[2:03:00] you can say
[2:03:01] this might have been in my family
[2:03:04] but the cycle stops amen yes
[2:03:08] why
[2:03:09] because you've got authority by the word
[2:03:12] of god if ye abide in me and my words
[2:03:14] abiding you ask what you will and it
[2:03:17] shall
[2:03:18] be done unto you amen

[2:04:28] changes
[2:04:30] to where we see the privilege
[2:04:33] to enter in
[2:04:36] we see the purpose of praying
[2:04:41] lord it's seeking
[2:04:43] it's asking for those things that you're
[2:04:45] speaking to our hearts about
[2:04:49] lord jesus

[2:04:53] voice

[2:05:53] of the world

[2:06:44] our hearts things that lord that
[2:06:47] can be so personal
[2:06:49] in every service
[2:06:54] or maybe there's one here that even
[2:06:57] struggled
[2:06:59] in their prayer life
[2:07:03] but i pray
[2:07:05] that god may they recognize
[2:07:09] if they just the lord would get down and
[2:07:10] just just worship you
[2:07:14] they don't necessarily have to get down
[2:07:15] on their knees
[2:07:19] the bible would say stand pray
[2:07:22] david would lay prostrate
[2:07:25] it's a condition
[2:07:28] of our heart towards you
[2:07:31] lord i pray that god may they just
[2:07:34] commit that to you and say lord
[2:07:36] teach me how to pray
[2:07:38] may the lord just be very honest and say
[2:07:40] lord
[2:07:42] i want a real prayer life lord
[2:07:45] i see the value i see it more

[2:07:57] want to make
[2:08:00] the most
[2:08:01] of every moment
[2:08:04] not to be bothered with
[2:08:07] thinking of whether or not prayers or i
[2:08:09] feel this way but maybe lord just may we
[2:08:12] just get into your presence

[2:11:00] seasons of life
[2:11:03] or god that even as they can be riding
[2:11:05] in a car they might say lord this isn't
[2:11:07] the same as me being able to get out in
[2:11:10] the woods or get out in the garage or
[2:11:12] get out here
[2:11:14] next to the bed and talk to you lord god
[2:11:16] but father
[2:11:18] this car right here or this place where
[2:11:21] i'm at right here

[2:11:55] we invite you lord jesus
[2:12:03] oh in the precious name of jesus christ
[2:12:07] amen
[2:12:10] amen amen amen
[2:12:13] oh do you love him amen
[2:12:17] oh my any good to us
[2:12:21] to
[2:12:22] cause us to stop
[2:12:25] and gaze like the
[2:12:27] disciples
[2:12:30] they weren't looking upon a natural
[2:12:32] field
[2:12:34] but you see what all they saw was people
[2:12:36] walking away you know going back to
[2:12:38] their homes and
[2:12:39] but what the lord jesus saw was
[2:12:41] they're like sheep
[2:12:43] without a shepherd
[2:12:45] see they were only seeing in the natural
[2:12:47] realm
[2:12:49] but it's his presence
[2:12:52] that opened them to look into the
[2:12:53] spiritual realm
