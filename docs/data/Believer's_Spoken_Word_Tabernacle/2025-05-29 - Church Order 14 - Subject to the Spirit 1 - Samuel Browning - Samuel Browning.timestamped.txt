[31:11] Oh and second verse once again. Lord you
[31:15] saw my
[31:19] condition. You had a plan from the
[31:22] start.
[31:23] [Music]
[31:25] Lord, your son for
[31:30] redemption, the price for my
[31:35] heart. Lord, I don't have a
[31:41] contest for that kind of love. I don't
[31:45] understand. Lord, I can't comprehend.
[31:49] All I know is I is that I need you. I
[31:55] run to the father. I fall into grace.
[32:00] I'm done with the hiding. A reason to
[32:04] wait. Oh my heart needs a searching. My
[32:08] soul needs a friend. So I run to the
[32:12] father again and again. I run. Oh, I run
[32:17] to the father. I fall into grace. I am
[32:22] done with the hiding. No reason to wait.
[32:26] Oh, my heart needs a searching. My soul
[32:31] needs a friend. So I run to the father
[32:35] again and again and again and again.
[32:42] Woah.
[32:45] Woah.
[32:48] Woah. My heart's
[32:50] been your sight long before my first
[32:58] breath. Running
[33:01] into your arms. Is running to life from
[33:08] death. Oh, I feel this rush deep in my
[33:13] chest. Your mercy is
[33:18] calling out just as I am. For you pull
[33:23] me in and I know that I Lord I need you.
[33:30] Oh, I run to the father. I fall into
[33:34] grace. Lord, I'm done with the hiding.
[33:38] No reason to wait. Oh, my heart needs a
[33:42] surgeon. My soul needs a friend. So I
[33:46] run to the father again and again. So I
[33:52] run to the father. I fall into grace.
[33:57] I'm done
[33:58] with the reason to wait. My heart found
[34:03] a sur. My soul had found a friend. So I
[34:08] run to the father again and again and
[34:12] again and
[34:15] again.
[34:21] Oh and again and
[34:25] [Music]
[34:28] again.
[34:30] [Music]
[34:32] Oh and again.
[34:34] [Music]
[34:38] Hallelujah.
[34:40] Amen.
[34:49] Amen. Let's call the pastor to come. How
[34:51] many's glad for God's mercy and his
[34:53] grace? Mountains of mercy. Help me sing
[34:55] it as our pastor comes.
[34:59] [Music]
[35:01] In a dark lonely
[35:06] valley of a desert so
[35:08] [Music]
[35:12] dry was us
[35:17] thirsty for the waters of
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] life. No real direction.
[35:27] Oh, I was lost as could be.
[35:33] I love this part. Then I met Jesus
[35:40] and Jesus showed
[35:42] me mountains of mercy.
[35:48] Oh
[35:52] grace, all the love and
[35:57] forgiveness is taking away the guilt and
[36:03] my shame. Oh, I traded all my doubts and
[36:08] my fears and every sin I could not erase
[36:15] for mountains of
[36:20] mercy. Oceans of
[36:23] grace. Let's all sing this
[36:27] morning. Lord, from the height of my
[36:31] [Applause]
[36:33] weakness to the depths of my
[36:36] [Music]
[36:38] sin. Oh, I was finally
[36:41] [Music]
[36:44] forgiven. Of all I had
[36:47] [Applause]
[36:49] been. Oh, just like a
[36:52] [Music]
[36:54] prisoner from darkness and
[37:00] free. Oh, when I touch
[37:05] heaven, I'm that heaven touch
[37:09] me. Mountains of
[37:13] mercy,
[37:15] ohions of grace.
[37:20] Oh, love and
[37:22] forgive
[37:25] me. Take me
[37:27] away my guilt and my
[37:30] shame. I tra all my doubts and my
[37:36] fears and every sin I could not erase.
[37:42] Mountains of
[37:47] mercy, oceans of rain.
[37:54] Well, I once was lost, but now
[37:59] I'm here to
[38:01] me
[38:04] to I once
[38:17] was of
[38:20] mercy of grace.
[38:31] Take me away. I
[38:41] [Music]
[38:59] guaranted all my death and my fears.
[39:04] and
[39:07] every race. Hallelujah. Mountains of
[39:11] mercy,
[39:13] mountains of mercy, operations of grace.
[39:18] Oh,
[39:19] hallelujah.
[39:23] Hallelujah.
[39:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:30] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise
[39:32] the Lord. Amen. Are you happy in the
[39:35] Lord? Amen. God is so good, isn't he?
[39:40] Amen. Amen. Let's just so thankful for
[39:44] the songs tonight and the worship. Amen.
[39:47] And uh it's good to be together tonight.
[39:50] Amen. Let's just approach him in a word
[39:52] of prayer before we turn to the word.
[39:56] Heavenly Father,
[40:00] we are so
[40:02] thankful once again, Lord, for this
[40:05] opportunity that we have to be able to
[40:09] come and and gather together,
[40:12] Father. Lord, not as a a people, Lord,
[40:16] just of God of our own doing, but
[40:19] Hallelujah. Lord, we were in your
[40:22] choosing. Bless your name. And Lord,
[40:24] it's you that has
[40:26] assembled us, Lord.
[40:29] That part of yourself, Lord, that you
[40:32] have drawn upon, Lord. Appreciate you.
[40:35] Lord, our lives truly, it's a paradox,
[40:38] Lord. Even as we stand here tonight,
[40:40] God, of the grace of God that found us,
[40:43] Lord, turned our hearts around, Lord,
[40:47] tendered our lives, oh God, and and
[40:50] Father, for the transforming power and
[40:53] work of the Holy Spirit. Oh God, we
[40:57] stand in awe, Lord, we just, Lord, are
[41:00] here to worship you, Lord.
[41:03] Oh God, we just want to draw closer to
[41:05] you.
[41:07] You said in your word, "Draw nigh to me
[41:09] and I'll draw nigh to you." Lord, we
[41:12] want to we want to draw near to you,
[41:15] Lord. Father, I pray that you'll just
[41:19] let your Holy Spirit, Lord, just may you
[41:22] come and just
[41:23] continue in waves to sweep among us,
[41:27] Lord. and Father that if there's
[41:30] anything Lord that's that's contrary to
[41:33] your will, contrary to your nature, your
[41:37] word, oh God, we just want to be so
[41:41] yielded that the Holy Spirit just just
[41:44] sweeping it, Lord, right out of our
[41:46] lives, Lord. God, moving it from a
[41:48] place, oh God, in our life of a hold to
[41:51] where that, oh God, we can just have
[41:55] that walk and that testimony, Lord,
[41:57] overcoming grace. Lord, we know, Lord,
[42:01] that there are things that are always
[42:02] set before us, Lord, to
[42:05] overcome. And Father, truly the greatest
[42:08] thing that we always have to overcome is
[42:11] our own selves, Lord. So, Father, I pray
[42:14] tonight that you'll just give us grace
[42:17] in every area of our life. You know,
[42:19] every need that's gathered here. Lord,
[42:23] probably standing here, I'm I'm in need
[42:25] of you the most. Lord, I'm asking that
[42:28] God that you would give me grace one
[42:30] more time to just be able to step out of
[42:33] the way. That Lord, you might be able to
[42:36] form the words of my mouth and say what
[42:39] needs to be said. May the Holy Spirit
[42:42] just take it, Lord. And we want our
[42:44] hearts to be available to you, Lord.
[42:48] Grant it, Lord. Minister to every need,
[42:50] Lord. Those that are gathered, those
[42:52] that are streaming, Lord, you see
[42:53] different ones that are suffering in
[42:55] their bodies right now. And we ask that,
[42:58] God, you'll go to them right where
[42:59] they're at. Lord, I pray for Sister
[43:02] Maria, Lord, as she's there at the home,
[43:04] Lord, at the house. I pray God, may the
[43:07] angel of the Lord make a visit there on
[43:10] Reeves Avenue, Lord, here tonight. Lord,
[43:13] may you just move, Lord. I pray God,
[43:15] upon those knees, Lord, just touch our
[43:18] sister, Lord. I pray, Father. You're the
[43:20] great physician, Lord. There's no
[43:23] situation that's too great or beyond
[43:26] you, Father. And you never told us or
[43:29] gave us any any sort of inclination that
[43:32] we would just Lord uh come to a place
[43:35] where age would would get in the way of
[43:37] the promise. You never said that. You
[43:41] never gave an age limit on it, Lord. But
[43:44] you said that, Father, that the prayer
[43:47] face shall save the sick and God shall
[43:48] raise them up. And it's by your stripes
[43:51] we're made whole. Now, Father, not only
[43:53] for Sister Maria, but for every single
[43:56] need, Lord, that's gathered here
[43:57] tonight. We claim that, Lord. We claim
[44:01] our healing, Father. In the name of
[44:04] Jesus
[44:05] Christ. Amen. And
[44:08] amen. Amen. God bless you
[44:11] tonight. Let's go right into 1
[44:14] Corinthians
[44:15] 14. And
[44:18] um I want
[44:20] to I want to pick up here on just
[44:25] a little portion of a of a thought and
[44:29] where I'm just wanting to move into a
[44:32] little bit more. We've been dealing with
[44:34] this aspect on within maturity and
[44:38] growth and maturity and that with the
[44:40] gifts and what even when we look at
[44:42] gifts of how that God what he has for
[44:45] our life. Um, brother Brandham when we
[44:49] just looking and just studying just a
[44:52] groupings on yielding and you know I
[44:55] like to go back over things and brother
[44:56] Brandham he simply puts it very clearly.
[44:59] He said, you know, he said, many times,
[45:01] he said, our lives are surrendered to
[45:03] God, and we are filled with God's
[45:06] spirit, but he says, we've got to go to
[45:10] yielding and looking to God for the
[45:13] purpose of God to be fulfilled for our
[45:15] lives. God's got a purpose. How many
[45:18] believe that? When the Holy Spirit has
[45:20] come, it's come to put us into service.
[45:24] And we don't tell him what that is. As a
[45:28] matter of fact, that purpose it
[45:29] continues to unfold within our life. It
[45:32] has many layers to it.
[45:34] father, mother and so forth, but even
[45:36] within gifts and whether it's five
[45:38] ministerial or the nine spiritual or
[45:40] however God would uh desire to use you.
[45:44] I believe within our hearts that when
[45:46] God touches your life, how many remember
[45:48] when brother says that little woman who
[45:51] came to the well and when her her her
[45:55] very hearts her sp her very heart was
[45:58] disclosed and she went away from there
[46:00] as a free woman, right? She no longer
[46:03] she no longer had to walk under that
[46:05] bondage. It wasn't just something that
[46:07] she she was just, you know, where it
[46:10] just had been lifted. She was free. She
[46:12] no longer had to look back over her
[46:14] shoulder in fear. And she went from
[46:16] there and you've heard brother Brandham
[46:17] say this over and over is she went into
[46:19] that city. And he said for her life was
[46:22] like a house on fire on a windy day.
[46:26] Right. And I believe that's exactly how
[46:29] God intends our lives to be. And you
[46:33] know, you we can have a picture of what
[46:35] that looks like, a a flaming and and
[46:38] burning house and things like that. And
[46:40] you might have something in the natural,
[46:41] but many times when you hear that of
[46:43] having a real burning desire, that's
[46:45] having a passion for God and the things
[46:49] of God. That's good. That's what the
[46:50] Holy Spirit is come to do. Hallelujah.
[46:53] It come to bring us to a place that we
[46:56] desire to be in his will. Amen. More
[46:59] than our own feelings, our own thoughts,
[47:02] our own ideas. It's a passion. Amen. So
[47:06] look here in 1 Corinthians 14. And you
[47:09] know, Paul's speaking to some believers.
[47:11] They've had some this this is some
[47:13] enthusiasm. And I I would say it in this
[47:15] way. If there's one thing that we could
[47:17] even use more of is godly enthusiasm.
[47:22] We're living in such an age of apathy
[47:24] and such an age of just, you know, and
[47:26] and look, things are coming where Satan
[47:29] wants to just so wear the people down.
[47:31] That's what the Bible said in the book
[47:33] of Daniel. People, you know, you just
[47:35] you just kind of thinking about, man, if
[47:37] I can make it from home, make it from
[47:38] the job to the lazy boy or or whatever
[47:41] more. And it but it's pressures. And
[47:43] it's not just the long hours, but it's
[47:44] the pressures of demons that you're
[47:48] battling against and that all of that's
[47:51] taking place within that. But to see how
[47:53] that within all of that, I don't know
[47:56] what happened. Somebody kicked me off
[47:59] there. Maybe they didn't and I just
[48:01] thought that. But there within it all,
[48:04] we want to say, God, don't let that
[48:07] enthusiasm die in my life.
[48:11] I want I want that enthusiasm and I want
[48:13] it channeled in the right way so it'll
[48:15] always bring glory to him. So let's read
[48:17] here without any further ado in verse
[48:20] 26. How is it then brethren when you
[48:23] come together every one of you hath a
[48:27] psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue,
[48:31] hath a revelation, hath an
[48:34] interpretation. Let all things be done
[48:36] unto edifying. Now, I'll just say it in
[48:38] like I said before, one thing about it,
[48:41] at least they came and they had a desire
[48:43] on their heart. That's right. They
[48:45] lacked understanding, but they at least
[48:48] had an enthusiasm. And what's really
[48:51] important is a teachable spirit. That's
[48:54] right. So that that enthusiasm could be
[48:56] channeled. Amen. If there's one thing
[48:58] that we want is a teachable spirit.
[49:01] Amen. So, let's just let's skip down
[49:04] here. Um, let me skip down because I've
[49:07] been having you stand here just for a
[49:09] moment. Let's skip down here to verse
[49:13] 32. And the spirits of the prophets are
[49:18] subject to the prophets.
[49:22] For God is not the author of confusion,
[49:26] but of peace. That word confusion, he's
[49:28] not of disarray and disorder. God has an
[49:32] order. We see all that from the how God
[49:35] set the solar system. We see it all from
[49:37] the tabernacle in the wilderness. On and
[49:39] on in our lives. He is but of peace as
[49:44] in all churches of the saints. Amen. May
[49:47] God bless you and bless the reading of
[49:49] the words. You're being seated. I want
[49:51] to just begin to speak on this thought
[49:53] of it.
[49:55] We
[49:56] were looking at some things last week
[49:59] and I just want to place this in between
[50:02] here in things of how
[50:05] that seeing things will things come to
[50:08] maturity and even with that within gifts
[50:10] and I think back even you know even into
[50:13] my own life and I've watched how uh
[50:16] there's things that for me uh there's
[50:19] even things I've watched where there's
[50:21] changes that God has brought even in uh
[50:25] my ministry and things like that that
[50:27] God has given me. The small little
[50:29] ministry, I've watched certain things
[50:31] and changes. And sometimes those changes
[50:33] aren't always um uh they're not always
[50:37] in one way comfortable because there's
[50:38] ways that God will change it. And we're
[50:41] so always looking back to how things
[50:43] were years ago, but God will just he's
[50:46] God's always working and he's always
[50:47] changing. And the reality of that is is
[50:50] just like when the the prophet speaks of
[50:53] the third pull and he made it very clear
[50:55] as a matter of fact he told Leo and Jean
[50:57] write this down and you'll come back to
[51:00] this and he said what the coming
[51:02] oncoming ministry because you know it
[51:05] would be nothing for them as humans to
[51:08] be able to look oh brother Brandham
[51:10] hospitals are going to be emptied up
[51:12] we're going to go in and pray for them
[51:13] and all of these things. Well, you know,
[51:16] that's that's part of human nature to
[51:18] get enthused about things and sometimes
[51:21] we can have our ideas about things and
[51:23] that's not God. When the Holy Ghost has
[51:26] come, he doesn't take that part away
[51:27] from us that we don't have our own
[51:29] ideas. But always the thing about it is
[51:31] the Holy Spirit within our life will
[51:34] always recognize his word and allow the
[51:37] idea to pass because ideas are actually
[51:41] hindrance for the spirit of God working
[51:44] in a deeper way in our life. So maturity
[51:47] never takes us out of the word of God
[51:50] but maturity actually brings us into a
[51:53] deeper rest in the rest of the Holy
[51:56] Ghost where we're already in to do what?
[51:58] with an understanding that we in our
[52:01] lives might be able to really yield in a
[52:05] deeper way. And this is why brother
[52:06] Brandham says God will not change so
[52:08] much the ministry as he will change the
[52:13] man. And that's what the real working of
[52:15] the third pull is because the third pole
[52:18] itself and I know we may have some new
[52:20] ones here but the first pool and second
[52:23] pool and third pole every ministry had
[52:25] those pools in it from the Lord Jesus,
[52:27] Noah and so forth but it is getting the
[52:30] third pole is getting that's the whole
[52:32] objective. This is who is stepping on
[52:35] the scene and actually who's been here
[52:36] the whole time. it's been Christ and to
[52:39] where that it's it's everything else
[52:41] fades out of view and it's Christ that's
[52:43] in view. So the real reality of the
[52:47] working of the depth of this message is
[52:50] to reproduce Jesus Christ in a many
[52:53] membered body to where that it's God
[52:56] himself being reflected because now
[53:00] we're no longer twain. Once we have been
[53:03] united with the word as an individual
[53:06] there there it is now bridegroom and
[53:10] bride and no longer twain but one.
[53:14] And so within that there is a uh a
[53:18] yielding and a and a direction and
[53:20] there's a changing that's going on. And
[53:22] you find that and I say that not just
[53:25] confined to that of the ministry but you
[53:28] find that even in the attributes that
[53:30] God has placed in your life as a father,
[53:34] as a mother, as a husband, as a wife.
[53:37] you there are different seasons and
[53:40] there must come a change to match what
[53:43] the season is calling for. And so God
[53:46] works within our lives that we are would
[53:49] coming into that place of really just
[53:52] submitting and surrendering to the Lord.
[53:54] And I tell you transition itself can be
[53:58] uh scary. But that's where God shows
[54:01] himself that he's faithful. He is a
[54:04] faithful shepherd. He's a faithful
[54:06] leader. That's where real leadership
[54:08] declares itself is in transition.
[54:11] You know, it's always easy to go along
[54:13] the same wall, but it's when you got to
[54:15] turn corners, making changes and turns,
[54:18] oh, that can be difficult sometimes
[54:20] because we get in a comfort zone of
[54:23] hanging on to things of what we've
[54:24] always known. And then when God begins
[54:26] to say, that's as far as this is going
[54:28] to go. It's like it was with Solomon's
[54:31] administration. Joab. Joab was a great
[54:35] help to David. But yet Joab, he had a
[54:38] part about him that he did what
[54:41] benefited Joab. That is so true.
[54:43] Whatever could benefit the ways of Joab.
[54:45] And that's why David said to Solomon,
[54:48] "Don't you let his head stay on his
[54:50] shoulders." Why? that cannot continue on
[54:54] in the administration of the Holy Spirit
[54:57] and that of Solomon of that of of the
[55:00] working of the son of man of Christ in
[55:02] our life. And I'll tell you that's what
[55:04] God comes to show up in our lives to
[55:06] where it's not about our him that willth
[55:09] or runth. It's God that showeth mercy.
[55:12] So it's God taking control. And that's
[55:14] what we want in our lives is I want God
[55:18] to have more control. Amen. Amen. I
[55:21] wanted less of me and more of him. And
[55:24] listen, brother Brandham, this is just a
[55:25] wonderful statement brother Brandham
[55:27] makes and why we're not a denomination.
[55:29] He says, he's in prayer, blessed be his
[55:31] holy name. He said, he's the one who
[55:33] sets the moon and the stars and the
[55:35] solar system. He set everything in its
[55:38] order, and he will set his church in
[55:40] order. It'll turn just like he wants her
[55:43] to turn, east, west, north, or south,
[55:47] whatever he is. When we can get these
[55:50] little or these denominational ideas out
[55:54] of our mind and throw oursel wholly into
[55:58] Calvary, he'll set it in order. If we're
[56:01] just as submissive as the trees and his
[56:05] other creation,
[56:07] I say grant it, Lord Jesus. That's the
[56:10] goal. That's that's the call of the word
[56:13] in this hour, that the word would have
[56:16] preeminence. And God let us come to that
[56:19] place of just being as submissive as the
[56:22] tree is and has the rest of that all
[56:24] that he has set into his divine order.
[56:28] My that's that's when there's a real
[56:29] achievement. So now coming into the
[56:32] scripture and I want to just look at
[56:34] this here a little bit tonight and it
[56:36] may be a a little bit of a different uh
[56:38] angle or thought but uh with it here
[56:40] tonight but I want to look at some of
[56:42] these points within it and how that the
[56:45] prophet will look at a gift in a life
[56:47] and the Holy Spirit and dealing with how
[56:50] to discern between the two. And so in 1
[56:54] Corinthians 14:13, we read this in our
[56:56] text. And the spirits of the prophets
[56:59] are subject to the prophets. That word
[57:04] subject is a is a Greek word that is
[57:07] known as hupataso. It's a word and what
[57:10] it is known as is that it is something
[57:13] that means to subject one's self to
[57:17] subordinate or to bay to obey uh to
[57:20] submit to one's control to yield to
[57:23] one's admonition or advice or to obey.
[57:27] In in a military term it means to
[57:29] arrange uh divisions in a military
[57:32] fashion under a command of a leader. uh
[57:36] in a non-military use, it's a voluntary
[57:38] attitude of giving in and cooperating
[57:42] and assuming responsibility and carrying
[57:46] a burden. Now, notice how the scripture
[57:49] is written and the spirits of the
[57:51] prophets are subject to the prophet. Who
[57:54] is the prophet? The word. Right. Amen.
[57:58] And that the word is that of the present
[58:02] moment and order in the
[58:05] service and how that the spirits itself.
[58:08] So in other words, the Holy Spirit will
[58:12] not act
[58:13] contrary to the present order.
[58:18] He the Holy Spirit because if it isn't
[58:21] then we got two separate people. The
[58:22] word and the Holy Spirit are two
[58:24] separate people. But they're not. The
[58:26] Bible, we know this first John 5 as it
[58:29] goes in that there are three that bear
[58:30] record in in you know in heaven father
[58:33] the father the word and the holy ghost
[58:35] these three are one. So this is why that
[58:38] when we cannot have the holy spirit in
[58:41] our lives in the depths of our lives
[58:43] without having the word because that's
[58:46] who the holy spirit is. He is the word.
[58:50] Amen. And so now when that that
[58:53] subjection it it submits to the Holy
[58:56] Spirit will always recognize his word
[59:00] and submit to it. Now you know we
[59:03] understand there are things that
[59:05] sometimes you can't find that find
[59:08] written here within the scripture but
[59:10] also remember his nature and his
[59:13] character. I am God and I change not.
[59:16] Amen. So there's things that sometimes
[59:19] within him that you can't necessarily
[59:21] maybe pin something and say well with
[59:24] something with scripture, but you come
[59:26] right back around and you recognize the
[59:28] character is not lining up with the
[59:31] character of the word. Right. So good.
[59:34] So it's always in looking at that even
[59:36] when you you say, "Brother Samuel, what
[59:39] are you saying?" I'm saying that I'm
[59:40] listening to not just in things being
[59:43] thrown or recited. I want to see the
[59:46] approach. What's motivating it? What's
[59:48] the spirit that's behind it? I want to
[59:51] see that because that will tell me
[59:53] what's behind it. Are you hearing me?
[59:56] Sometimes the word can only be a
[59:58] covering.
[1:00:00] Are you hearing me? So now we want the
[1:00:04] word to be something. It's meant to be
[1:00:06] something deeper than just a covering.
[1:00:09] It is intended to be a life. Amen. Now
[1:00:12] watch this in the scripture with
[1:00:13] subjection just a few places. Romans 8:6
[1:00:17] and 7. For to be carnally minded is
[1:00:20] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[1:00:23] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[1:00:26] is enmity against God. For it is not
[1:00:30] subject to the law of God, neither
[1:00:34] indeed can be. Now you think of this
[1:00:37] that even for a person that they could
[1:00:40] subject or
[1:00:41] conform to the message or conform to an
[1:00:46] idea and yet still have the desire and
[1:00:50] that carnal mind on the inside and it be
[1:00:53] wrong
[1:00:55] because it's not about all of the
[1:00:58] actions or what we could do out here.
[1:01:01] It's this man on the inside. It's about
[1:01:04] getting the inner man right.
[1:01:08] When the inner man is right, it'll
[1:01:10] reflect on the outside. And that's what
[1:01:12] God wants. In other words, God doesn't
[1:01:15] want you or I doing something just
[1:01:17] simply because it's the right thing to
[1:01:19] do. That's so I mean, you know, the
[1:01:23] Pharisees, they were they were whited
[1:01:25] supplicers. You couldn't lay a finger on
[1:01:27] their lives, right? But Jesus uncovered
[1:01:31] what was behind all of that religious
[1:01:34] pump and pride and everything else. He
[1:01:37] looked he said he came right down to it.
[1:01:40] These they were so technical and tithing
[1:01:42] on annis and men. And Jesus said you
[1:01:45] have you have uh omitted the weightier
[1:01:49] things of the law, right? Mercy and
[1:01:52] grace and truth. and and and they were
[1:01:55] they were doing what the commandments
[1:01:58] were without a heart that was actually
[1:02:01] attached to what God intended to be
[1:02:05] done.
[1:02:06] And really before the Holy Ghost has
[1:02:10] come into a person's life, I believe
[1:02:12] that we want to know what's right. We
[1:02:15] ought to give ourselves to right because
[1:02:17] listen, every every part of this is a
[1:02:20] fight and it is a battle. Uh you know
[1:02:23] the Bible said that the kingdom of God
[1:02:25] since that of John it suffereth violence
[1:02:28] and the violence taketh by force. So
[1:02:30] we're not it's not just something that's
[1:02:32] just going to drop within within our
[1:02:34] laps. But when we recognize that there
[1:02:37] is this which is touching my life and
[1:02:41] touching my heart and and dealing with
[1:02:43] my life. It's to pursue that with all
[1:02:46] that is within us. The Bible said, "Seek
[1:02:49] you first the kingdom of God and his
[1:02:51] righteousness and all these other things
[1:02:53] will be added unto you." You can get the
[1:02:56] P's and Q's of this natural life right,
[1:02:58] but if you miss the spiritual the
[1:03:01] spiritual part, you have missed
[1:03:04] everything. Amen.
[1:03:06] You might have accolades that could be
[1:03:09] given and read if God would terry at
[1:03:11] your funeral and your eulogy, but if you
[1:03:14] miss being filled with the Holy Spirit,
[1:03:18] you've missed it all.
[1:03:21] So this to be subject to be to yield to
[1:03:25] it takes something deeper than just our
[1:03:28] intellect or our knowledge. Right? Yet
[1:03:33] there has to come understanding in our
[1:03:36] lives. And God does bring understanding
[1:03:39] in our lives. But to understand that
[1:03:41] it's not a con a conforming, but it's a
[1:03:45] transforming work.
[1:03:48] That's good. Because always to have
[1:03:51] God's God's life within us is to be one
[1:03:54] with the word. The prophet would say,
[1:03:56] "Oneness with God is to have God's
[1:03:58] spirit in you, agreeing with the word,
[1:04:01] all the word, the whole word, and to
[1:04:04] make it manifested in power." Ephesians
[1:04:08] 5:22 and 24, wives submit. Now, notice
[1:04:12] these words that's used. It's the same
[1:04:14] word hoopasso. It's that which is that
[1:04:17] that is is yielding to admonition. one
[1:04:21] that is yielding or or giving into
[1:04:25] subjecting oneself. This is not this is
[1:04:28] not one being subjected but it is one
[1:04:32] that is submitting themselves. In other
[1:04:34] words, they are putting themselves
[1:04:38] under. Right. Right. And this is why
[1:04:41] brother Brandon would pick it up and
[1:04:42] thinking man's filter. He said, "Look,"
[1:04:44] he said, "we as sons of God, as husbands
[1:04:48] should live such lives before our wives
[1:04:52] and our families that they would
[1:04:55] reverence us as a son of God." Amen.
[1:04:59] That doesn't mean that they're rolling
[1:05:01] out red carpet, but they recognize
[1:05:04] Christ in our life.
[1:05:07] It isn't about can we tie everything
[1:05:10] together in the scriptures. You can do
[1:05:12] all of that and still not have what's
[1:05:15] necessary.
[1:05:18] Understanding all mysteries and not
[1:05:20] having the real baptism of the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost, the divine love of God, you miss
[1:05:25] it all. And listen, it is not knowledge
[1:05:28] that produces an image. It is the image
[1:05:32] of Christ in you, in me that brings
[1:05:35] forth real leadership. Hallelujah.
[1:05:38] That's where we can look at and say, I
[1:05:40] can submit to that. That's why with this
[1:05:43] message, this word that God has raised
[1:05:45] up in this hour, we are not looking at
[1:05:49] uh uh the ideas of a man. We recognize
[1:05:53] Christ.
[1:05:55] I don't care what others want to say.
[1:05:57] That's their problem. It's not mine. I'm
[1:05:59] not called to debate, convince, and try
[1:06:01] to I'm not We're not called to do that.
[1:06:03] were called. The Bible said, "My sheep
[1:06:06] hear my voice and a stranger they will
[1:06:09] not follow."
[1:06:12] Is that right? Yes, sir. So, notice when
[1:06:15] we're looking here, even in the
[1:06:16] scripture, as it would say, therefore,
[1:06:19] as the church is subject unto Christ, so
[1:06:23] let the wives be to their own husbands
[1:06:25] in everything.
[1:06:27] Now, we could take this just for a
[1:06:30] moment and say an ongoing process,
[1:06:34] right? Ongoing process. Because even in
[1:06:37] our lives as children of God, let me
[1:06:40] just say it. Even with being born of the
[1:06:42] spirit of God, we don't have all the
[1:06:45] knowledge at that moment when we receive
[1:06:47] the spirit of God that we have need of.
[1:06:50] Right. But we have what's most important
[1:06:52] and that is the answer to the devil's
[1:06:56] question. We've got the stabilizer and
[1:06:59] the confidence and the answer. He that
[1:07:02] will lead and guide us into all truth.
[1:07:06] That is so good. And there's an
[1:07:08] authority abiding under this word.
[1:07:12] That's right. Hallelujah. This is why
[1:07:15] the prophet would say in the closing
[1:07:16] part of the church age book resumeé area
[1:07:19] and he would say that they in this bride
[1:07:22] that they themselves will they come
[1:07:25] under that ministry of that seventh
[1:07:28] angel messenger and become the final
[1:07:32] voice to the final age. We've not been
[1:07:35] subdued by man. We've not been brought
[1:07:37] in here by fear. Amen. That only lasts
[1:07:40] so long.
[1:07:42] Are you hearing me? But it's a love
[1:07:44] affair. Amen. Amen. There's things that
[1:07:47] with in overcoming that God will deal
[1:07:50] with our life. Sometimes, as I read in
[1:07:52] that quote, why we're not not a
[1:07:54] denomination, sometimes the struggle is
[1:07:57] is dying to old thinking.
[1:08:03] Because sometimes old thinking and
[1:08:05] things that sometimes you may not even
[1:08:07] be able to put your finger on as though
[1:08:09] it's been taught into you. Because
[1:08:11] sometimes you can have some that can
[1:08:13] step away from ministries they've been
[1:08:15] under and you look and say, "Well, I
[1:08:17] know that individual doesn't stand for
[1:08:19] that." But sometimes it's the makeup and
[1:08:21] background of a person. But I am so glad
[1:08:25] that before there was even that makeup
[1:08:28] and before there was ever any any
[1:08:30] teaching that maybe somebody did in the
[1:08:33] very best, I'm glad that there was
[1:08:35] something that was before that. You say,
[1:08:37] "What was that?" That was the word. That
[1:08:40] seed on the inside
[1:08:44] that is a part of this word. It will
[1:08:46] take its place under the word.
[1:08:53] Now many other scriptures we could go
[1:08:56] into, but I I want you to notice how
[1:08:58] this takes place. It's a submitting
[1:09:00] unto. It's a subjecting unto. This is
[1:09:03] something that God moves in the heart of
[1:09:07] the individual to to bring them to to
[1:09:10] subject or to submit. Just like Titus,
[1:09:14] Paul would tell him, put him in mind to
[1:09:17] be subject unto principalities and
[1:09:20] powers. Peter would say, "Submit
[1:09:22] yourselves unto the elder and and and
[1:09:25] all of you be subject one to another and
[1:09:27] be clothed with humility."
[1:09:30] He would go on to say be servants be
[1:09:32] subject to your masters with all fear.
[1:09:34] So these are things that we realize that
[1:09:37] there is a recognition of of what and
[1:09:41] who is in our midst. And let me just say
[1:09:43] it like this. The spirit of Christ, the
[1:09:45] Holy Ghost will always subject himself
[1:09:48] to his own word.
[1:09:51] He's a gentleman at all times. He does
[1:09:53] not misbehave. He's a gentleman.
[1:09:58] He will always declare
[1:10:00] through it all of who he is,
[1:10:04] the character, his nature and the order
[1:10:06] of the word. So when maturing in in our
[1:10:10] lives, this is where Paul would write in
[1:10:13] the in in few scriptures in 1
[1:10:15] Corinthians 14 a few beyond where we
[1:10:17] read our text. Uh familiar Paul said in
[1:10:20] the church I had rather speak five words
[1:10:24] with my understanding than by my voice
[1:10:27] that by my voice I might teach others
[1:10:29] also than 10,000 words in an unknown
[1:10:32] tongue.
[1:10:34] Now truly anyone who would speak in an
[1:10:37] unknown tongue just like the brother
[1:10:39] Brandon would bring that out you know
[1:10:40] they're blessed they're being blessed
[1:10:43] but Paul is helping them to see and
[1:10:47] trying to guide them into a place not to
[1:10:51] remove enthusiasm. Are you hearing me?
[1:10:54] Not to take enthusiasm out. Listen this
[1:10:57] is why let me just go with this. This is
[1:10:59] why when the Bible would say in
[1:11:02] Ephesians, in Colossians, fathers, it
[1:11:05] says, "Provoke not your children to
[1:11:09] anger." That phrase means to exasperate
[1:11:13] or to take the life out of. God, when he
[1:11:17] corrects us, now listen, when he
[1:11:19] corrects us, he's not taking the life
[1:11:22] out of us, but he wants to channel us
[1:11:26] into his perfect will. Amen. Amen. Take
[1:11:32] where we are. Are you hearing me? God,
[1:11:35] listen, God never took away and looked
[1:11:38] backwards to what when the gifts were
[1:11:41] restored in Isuza Street and because
[1:11:44] they had mixtures of unclean spirits and
[1:11:46] everything else, God never looked back
[1:11:48] there and said they didn't have
[1:11:50] anything. No, there needed to be a
[1:11:52] maturing and a growth. And that takes
[1:11:57] laboring with them. And when God brought
[1:12:01] this message, hallelujah, it was God
[1:12:05] coming down to labor with the church.
[1:12:10] Just like he labors with your life,
[1:12:12] labors with my life. And let me tell
[1:12:15] you, he has brought you, he has brought
[1:12:17] me a mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty,
[1:12:19] mighty long way.
[1:12:24] He's been longsuffering. He's been
[1:12:26] patient with us.
[1:12:30] Because sometimes our ideas or thinking
[1:12:32] is security because why why could it be
[1:12:35] looked at as security? Because it's
[1:12:37] looked at as though it is word. And when
[1:12:41] God begins to come, you know, God don't
[1:12:43] sit there and take our hands and you
[1:12:45] know, like trying to take something from
[1:12:46] your sister or brother. You know, you
[1:12:49] and mom, no, no, God don't do that. He's
[1:12:52] a gentleman. Yes, he is.
[1:12:54] What he does is by his spirit he comes
[1:12:57] to bring rest in the word. Yes. That's
[1:13:02] how that's how levan old thinking is
[1:13:06] dismantled in our in our minds in our
[1:13:09] lives is through the preaching of the
[1:13:11] word.
[1:13:13] Hallelujah. That's why this word it has
[1:13:15] an effect upon our life. And I'm sure we
[1:13:18] can fellowship around this. There's been
[1:13:20] things I have witnessed over the years
[1:13:22] in my life. Oh, of things that I thought
[1:13:25] and man, I thought and when God would
[1:13:28] bring a release on it, I see it. I can
[1:13:30] see something. Oh my. Brother Brandon
[1:13:32] said this right here, man. It's it's
[1:13:34] it's it's a release. You know what it
[1:13:36] actually was? You realize what we were
[1:13:38] holding to was a hindrance.
[1:13:41] Amen. Right.
[1:13:44] We think where how in the world did that
[1:13:45] get in there?
[1:13:47] Well, a lot of
[1:13:49] times wanting to be sincere, which is a
[1:13:52] good thing. See, enthusiasm, sincerity,
[1:13:55] it's a good thing. But always under the
[1:13:58] subjection of the word, right? You know,
[1:14:02] you can never, let me tell you this, you
[1:14:04] can take everything and lay it right
[1:14:06] there on the pew beside you and the Holy
[1:14:08] Spirit will never take from you what
[1:14:10] he's given you. All right. All right.
[1:14:14] That's the kind of that's the kind of
[1:14:15] peace and kind of rest in his presence
[1:14:17] that we're to walk with. Now, let me go
[1:14:20] on here. But, brethren, be not children
[1:14:22] in understanding, but in malice be
[1:14:24] children, but in understanding be men.
[1:14:28] Now you see this is why when when
[1:14:31] brother Brandham when he would take
[1:14:32] different things even in the earlier
[1:14:34] church order and saying talking about
[1:14:36] with gifts and he says the same phrase
[1:14:38] over and over about that the people
[1:14:40] doesn't understand how and when to use
[1:14:44] these gifts. So there's some of those
[1:14:46] things of how and when. And I I pray
[1:14:49] that God will help me and help us
[1:14:51] together because I know I only have so
[1:14:53] much time, but that that that that we
[1:14:56] can look even beyond the nine spiritual
[1:14:58] gifts and even look into our life to
[1:15:01] what God has called us to do and say,
[1:15:04] "God, teach me how and when."
[1:15:07] Cuz even as moms and as dads and fathers
[1:15:10] and mothers and and and we need to know
[1:15:13] how and when, right? That was one thing
[1:15:17] that the coming of the Lord in this
[1:15:19] hour, it was a three-fold revelation.
[1:15:23] Who, how, and when. Right. Is that
[1:15:26] right? In 63, Christ the mystery, the
[1:15:29] prophet said, "We know, we know who it
[1:15:31] is." Right? Even at the end there of the
[1:15:33] seventh seal. But he says, "The how and
[1:15:36] the when." Those are two things that he
[1:15:38] hasn't revealed up to this time. But
[1:15:40] notice there from 63 coming into 64,
[1:15:44] feast of the trumpets, he's declaring,
[1:15:46] we know we're living in the season of
[1:15:48] his coming. And then God breaks the
[1:15:51] rapture revelation in December of 1965,
[1:15:55] revealing the other two folds of that
[1:15:59] three-fold
[1:16:01] mystery. How and when the Lord himself
[1:16:04] shall descend from heaven with a shout.
[1:16:08] So God opening and you know even within
[1:16:10] that we realize hey we don't have to get
[1:16:13] in a rush but neither neither do we just
[1:16:16] sit back with our hands behind our head.
[1:16:18] That's not the kind of rest this is.
[1:16:20] It's the kind of rest like the little
[1:16:22] lady who was operating on the ranch.
[1:16:24] Man, she knew he was coming back for it.
[1:16:27] She was working but she was whistling
[1:16:28] while she was working. They thought what
[1:16:31] in the world's got into her? That's the
[1:16:33] key. What got into her? That's what made
[1:16:35] the difference in our life. what got
[1:16:37] into us.
[1:16:39] It took away the fear, took away the
[1:16:41] scare, brought a confidence in our life,
[1:16:45] right? But to understand how and when
[1:16:48] and then to just to move into that
[1:16:51] place, God, what you have for my life,
[1:16:53] the right opportunity. So there's a need
[1:16:55] for knowledge. I know this word in
[1:16:58] itself, we many times this word
[1:17:01] knowledge, it's like, oh, we we don't
[1:17:02] want knowledge. Well, we don't want
[1:17:06] just earthly knowledge. In some
[1:17:09] instances, we need it. You need to know
[1:17:12] how to drive your car. You need to know
[1:17:15] different things and cooking and so
[1:17:16] forth. But the need for knowledge, I'm
[1:17:19] talking about Holy Ghost knowledge,
[1:17:21] right? I'm talking about as God would
[1:17:24] teach us and and speak to our lives and
[1:17:27] direct our lives. Notice this is Paul's
[1:17:29] request that God that the God of our
[1:17:31] Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory,
[1:17:34] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:17:37] and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[1:17:43] In Colossians 1:9, for this cause we
[1:17:45] also since the day we heard it, do not
[1:17:47] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[1:17:50] ye might be filled with the knowledge of
[1:17:54] his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:17:57] understanding. How many could say it is
[1:18:00] absolutely important that I know God's
[1:18:02] will for my life? Absolutely important.
[1:18:05] And it's ongoing. God's will it's it's
[1:18:08] folds that continue to be unfolded in
[1:18:11] our life. And this is where even with
[1:18:14] God, God unfolding himself. It isn't God
[1:18:18] unfolding a book. Remember the book
[1:18:21] itself is Christ. And it's Christ taking
[1:18:25] the the seals off of himself. It's
[1:18:28] Christ unveiling himself. We're talking
[1:18:31] about God bringing a real Holy Ghost
[1:18:35] knowledge to his people. Right.
[1:18:39] This is why the word when the word has
[1:18:42] gone forth even in every generation,
[1:18:45] God's desire is for that word not to be
[1:18:49] studied that it would be debated.
[1:18:53] Is that right? The prophet tells us that
[1:18:55] in the church age book in the sardesian
[1:18:57] age, he tells us how people in that age
[1:18:59] got under the anointing and they begin
[1:19:01] to take things and study it to debate
[1:19:04] it. He said, "But they," he said,
[1:19:06] "instead of studying it that it might
[1:19:09] become a practical outworking in their
[1:19:12] lives." Let me just tell you what that
[1:19:14] brings it down to you in your life. When
[1:19:17] you get down and giving your heart and
[1:19:19] your life as you're taking in the word
[1:19:21] of God, you know, we're not here uh you
[1:19:24] know, yes, it's wonderful to remember
[1:19:26] certain things and God has gifted us in
[1:19:28] many different ways. God will never hold
[1:19:30] you accountable for what he's holding me
[1:19:32] accountable for. but to understand
[1:19:34] what's most important. You could have
[1:19:36] all knowledge of the scripture as far as
[1:19:39] to be able to finish a scripture after I
[1:19:42] say it or to repeat a chapter and do all
[1:19:44] that and that's all wonderful. But
[1:19:46] what's really important is that it has
[1:19:49] become a practical outworking in our
[1:19:52] life that does not come by human res
[1:19:56] recitations that comes by the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost. He's the one that reveals
[1:20:03] the deep things of God. That's why the
[1:20:06] prophet said in this hour, it's going to
[1:20:08] take more than just comparing verse to
[1:20:11] verse.
[1:20:14] Brother Brandham, we need to know this
[1:20:15] language. He said what we need is the
[1:20:18] author of the book.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah. And I can say thank God for
[1:20:26] the author of the book.
[1:20:28] Amen. Yes. Amen. That ye why why why why
[1:20:33] Paul? Why are you praying for this? That
[1:20:35] you might walk worthy of the Lord unto
[1:20:38] all pleasing, being fruitful and every
[1:20:41] good work and increasing in the
[1:20:43] knowledge of God. It's like the prophet
[1:20:44] said, as a boss, you you know, you're
[1:20:47] not not making himself a boss, but he
[1:20:49] says, you know, as a boss gives you
[1:20:51] something to do, you do it. He said, and
[1:20:52] then what does it do? the boss has
[1:20:54] confidence in you and continues to raise
[1:20:56] you higher and higher. And that's what
[1:20:59] the whole purpose is is I we want to
[1:21:02] grow deeper in the love of God. Blessed
[1:21:07] are they that do and keep all his
[1:21:10] commandments. Blessed are they, notice,
[1:21:14] and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[1:21:17] Second Peter 3:18. I always love how
[1:21:19] this was wrote. It didn't say grow in
[1:21:21] knowledge. just said grow in grace
[1:21:23] and in the knowledge of our Lord and
[1:21:26] Savior Jesus Christ. So it comes down to
[1:21:30] a
[1:21:31] yielding. Now let's look at this
[1:21:33] yielding because that's that's
[1:21:35] subjection and to be subject. Watch how
[1:21:38] Brother Brandham is going to take this
[1:21:40] and I'm going to just move really right
[1:21:42] into this this place of it to where the
[1:21:44] prophet begins to take this and show us
[1:21:47] the difference and the distinction
[1:21:50] between a gift and the Holy Spirit
[1:21:53] operating that gift.
[1:21:56] He
[1:21:57] says he's asked a question. Do you
[1:22:00] believe that the program, including the
[1:22:03] sermon, should yield to the spirit when
[1:22:06] it's trying to bring forth a message in
[1:22:08] tongues?
[1:22:09] Now, I think we're very much aware of
[1:22:13] this even before I would have even said
[1:22:16] anything here or started months ago. We
[1:22:19] we're
[1:22:19] aware what the scripture says that the
[1:22:22] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[1:22:23] prophet. In other words, the Holy Spirit
[1:22:25] will not anoint someone to begin to
[1:22:28] speak in tongues when he's speaking from
[1:22:29] the platform.
[1:22:32] It could be a spirit, but it's not the
[1:22:33] Holy Spirit. Right? Are you hearing me?
[1:22:36] Cuz that'd be confusion. So, when these
[1:22:40] questions are coming because it it gets
[1:22:41] into a real a real beautiful thing that
[1:22:44] if God will give us grace to apply it
[1:22:47] across all of our lives when we look at
[1:22:49] it. Now notice, brother Ram goes on to
[1:22:52] this and I I'm just going to refer to a
[1:22:54] few things. He said, "Now when the when
[1:22:56] now in speaking in tongues, that's a
[1:22:58] gift of God." Just just listen to me for
[1:23:00] a moment. But it's subject to what's on
[1:23:02] the floor at the first place.
[1:23:06] Theirs, he said, where many times as
[1:23:08] Christians, you make your mistake. He
[1:23:11] said the Holy Spirit, if I'm anointed of
[1:23:13] God and I'm speaking by the Holy Spirit,
[1:23:15] he's speaking here. Don't speak over
[1:23:17] here and over here and over here a
[1:23:20] confusion. We must get those things down
[1:23:24] in our heart. Everything has to come in
[1:23:29] its season. Right? Amen. Remember the
[1:23:31] the service remember as we started out
[1:23:34] in the beginning a service is not start
[1:23:37] stop. It is there is an ascending and
[1:23:41] then it crescendos and we move on. you
[1:23:45] different ones that have at different
[1:23:46] times have had to maybe stand here and
[1:23:48] even lead songs after the service and
[1:23:51] they've spoke this to me. They've
[1:23:53] recognized this. You don't even start
[1:23:55] singing. It's not about your favorite
[1:23:57] songs. You don't even just keep on
[1:23:59] singing. You you recognize into that
[1:24:01] place. If you're gifted for that moment
[1:24:04] of the service, you recognize when to
[1:24:05] step back and let the spirit just just
[1:24:08] come to a crescendo. Amen.
[1:24:10] people still continuing to worship and
[1:24:12] and going on and moving on. It's
[1:24:14] recognizing because it's not starting
[1:24:16] and stopping. He's a God of order. Amen.
[1:24:20] Is that right? A lot of feelings we can
[1:24:22] have. Just bear with me here because
[1:24:24] these are not my words. Notice we must
[1:24:26] get those things down in our heart.
[1:24:28] Everything has to come in its season. He
[1:24:30] said, "Now, you know, he said, let's say
[1:24:32] someone that you know starts uh speaking
[1:24:35] in tongues and he says, I want you to
[1:24:37] watch how brothers approach. I've I've
[1:24:39] I've taken this through the message.
[1:24:42] Brother Bram says, "I ain't saying the
[1:24:44] person was wrong. I don't say the person
[1:24:46] was
[1:24:48] demonpossessed." Brother Bram will say
[1:24:49] that many times. He said, "I" and then
[1:24:51] he'll say it in another place. He says,
[1:24:52] "I don't know that." Now, when Brother
[1:24:55] Bramble says, "I don't know that." And
[1:24:57] somebody tells me they do know it,
[1:24:58] somebody's lying.
[1:25:01] Or trying to be something that they're
[1:25:03] not.
[1:25:04] You say, "Where would you pull that
[1:25:06] from?" One of the messages questions and
[1:25:07] answers is God being misunderstood. If
[1:25:09] you want a list of others, I can give
[1:25:11] you more. But it's showing us that it's
[1:25:13] not, you know, us saying, well, I know
[1:25:15] this is and I know, look, there are
[1:25:16] certain things even in the scriptures
[1:25:18] that we can look at. But notice, brother
[1:25:21] says, I believe the person was sincere.
[1:25:24] So what is it? Their enthusiasm there.
[1:25:28] You know, as this is why that the
[1:25:30] prophet said when it's a good praying
[1:25:32] church, the gifts are present.
[1:25:35] But remember, the gifts are not noted on
[1:25:37] a blackboard or it's not on a billboard,
[1:25:40] right? Thank God for people that don't
[1:25:42] have to toot their own horn about, well,
[1:25:44] you know, God used me to do this and
[1:25:45] used me to do that. I'm grateful that
[1:25:47] God just has such a way and such a
[1:25:50] humility that it brings in our heart
[1:25:52] that you know what it isn't for
[1:25:54] everybody to know.
[1:25:57] Sometimes God has things for that. He
[1:25:59] has times for that. He has seasons for
[1:26:01] that. Are you with me? But always always
[1:26:04] the thing that I always we look for is
[1:26:06] is brother Brandham himself, brother
[1:26:08] Brandham would speak even coming out of
[1:26:11] the meetings. Now this is just even you
[1:26:13] can hear on tape but even in those that
[1:26:14] were in his house they said when they
[1:26:17] rode with him after the meeting he spoke
[1:26:20] as in third person. I was there and I
[1:26:24] saw him do this. I happened to be there
[1:26:27] and I saw him do this. Oh, glory be to
[1:26:30] God. You say, you see, brother Brandon
[1:26:33] was so careful that he never wanted the
[1:26:35] people to chase after a person,
[1:26:40] but that they would be identifying that
[1:26:43] that God when God does something, God
[1:26:46] showing what he thinks about you and
[1:26:49] about me about his word. Amen. It isn't
[1:26:52] that you know that that that it's had to
[1:26:54] be something that that's happened to me
[1:26:56] or happened to you. All through this
[1:26:58] congregation, we can have testimonies
[1:27:00] that when there has been things that God
[1:27:03] has done for someone else, how that that
[1:27:06] in itself has ministered to the depths
[1:27:08] of our lives. Is that right?
[1:27:14] I'm saying I believe that person is
[1:27:17] sincere. I believe that person. I
[1:27:19] believe they could speak in tongues.
[1:27:20] They're blessed of God. But it's like
[1:27:22] brother Neville standing here trying to
[1:27:24] sing a song. Maybe he's gifted to sing a
[1:27:26] song and he's singing a song and me
[1:27:28] standing here trying to preach right in
[1:27:29] his face and him singing. That's how you
[1:27:32] talking about confusion.
[1:27:34] Wow.
[1:27:36] Finally, you just wrap it up and say, "I
[1:27:38] tell you what we'll do. It's been so
[1:27:40] rich tonight. This movement of God, we
[1:27:43] don't even need to preach."
[1:27:47] Wow.
[1:27:48] Now, notice if the Holy Spirit I'm I'm
[1:27:52] going I'm going to give you a few slides
[1:27:53] here in a minute. If the Holy Spirit is
[1:27:55] in the singing, let the singing go on.
[1:27:57] If I was standing here and started
[1:27:59] preaching and he raises up and starts
[1:28:00] singing a song when I'm preaching,
[1:28:02] that's out of order. The Holy Spirit is
[1:28:04] not the author of the confusion. He
[1:28:06] said, "You're lovely people." He said,
[1:28:08] "But that's that's error." If you've got
[1:28:10] a gift, use the gift where the gift
[1:28:14] belongs. Right? So now notice how
[1:28:17] brother Random and all the way through
[1:28:19] the message places it. It's not us as
[1:28:21] though that oh I don't know which way
[1:28:23] I'm going to go and the gift has taken
[1:28:24] me here and and this and that. No, no,
[1:28:26] no, no, no, no, no. That's contrary to
[1:28:28] the word.
[1:28:31] Use the
[1:28:33] gift. How many of you got tools in your
[1:28:35] tool shed, sisters? You've got pots in
[1:28:39] your in your Right. Those pots don't
[1:28:43] those pots you you have to use them in
[1:28:46] the right place. Right. Right. I know
[1:28:48] sometimes we may have to use a pot to
[1:28:50] catch a a leak and things. You know, I
[1:28:52] think when we had to use a trash can in
[1:28:54] school, maybe to catch a leak from a
[1:28:56] leaky roof or something. That's not what
[1:28:57] it was intended for. It's not its
[1:28:59] rightful place. It was just there to
[1:29:01] collect trash. But notice God God,
[1:29:04] listen friends, God teaching us that
[1:29:07] their responsibility is to use the gift
[1:29:11] where the gift belongs. Now look at
[1:29:15] this, brother Bam. As you look at this,
[1:29:17] brother Brand says, "If I got a pick and
[1:29:19] a
[1:29:19] shovel," he says, "I'm not going to try
[1:29:21] to ho my potatoes with it." Now, notice,
[1:29:24] if I have a pick and a shovel, I'm not
[1:29:27] going to try to ho the potatoes. Now,
[1:29:28] for those of you that don't know about a
[1:29:31] garden, you hoe the the tomatoes to get
[1:29:35] the weeds that are gathering around them
[1:29:38] to loosen the soil up. This other part
[1:29:41] is stuff you would use at the end of the
[1:29:43] season to get rid of them. So, it's
[1:29:45] using the right instrument at the right
[1:29:48] time. It's like, you know, you don't use
[1:29:51] the saucepan to necessarily make the
[1:29:53] mashed potatoes. You use more of a stock
[1:29:55] pot or whatever more, but you use the
[1:29:56] saucepan to make some good
[1:30:00] gravy. Right? You got to use what's
[1:30:02] needed at that time.
[1:30:05] Right? Notice he said, "When I'm picking
[1:30:07] or digging a ditch, that's when I'll use
[1:30:09] that. If I'm picking or digging a ditch,
[1:30:11] that's when those two are needed." So it
[1:30:13] isn't every service running in I got a
[1:30:16] shovel. I got a shovel. That's why Paul
[1:30:17] said every one of you hath a psalm in
[1:30:20] Revelation half of this. My shovel my
[1:30:22] shovel. Well, praise God for your
[1:30:24] shovel. Praise God for your pick. But
[1:30:26] this may not be a pick service.
[1:30:31] But don't lose your enthusiasm.
[1:30:34] How do I lose my enthusiasm? By pulling
[1:30:36] back because oh my my pick isn't it's
[1:30:39] not being used. My shovel's not being
[1:30:41] used. You got to cast away that childish
[1:30:44] thinking.
[1:30:46] Come on up and be a man. Come on up and
[1:30:49] grow up. As Paul said, it isn't that
[1:30:51] every time we come together, it's got to
[1:30:53] be this. But listen, let me just tell
[1:30:54] you something. You know what? What
[1:30:56] happens many times where it was with the
[1:30:58] Corinthians, I believe they were sincere
[1:31:00] people, friends, and some of it was
[1:31:03] where they had come from previously.
[1:31:06] That's why Paul had to deal with talking
[1:31:09] about that how yes, women could prophesy
[1:31:12] as far as to speak in tongues and
[1:31:15] interpret, but they couldn't preach.
[1:31:17] Right? Paul had to deal with that among
[1:31:20] the Corinthians because they came right
[1:31:22] out of where God brought them out of and
[1:31:24] they had to understand you can't be a
[1:31:26] priest over here in that way that you
[1:31:29] were over there. You see the word come
[1:31:31] to set and give order. Now the reality
[1:31:34] is is that what was within their heart
[1:31:36] to submit to the word of God. I tell you
[1:31:38] you're talking about a breath of fresh
[1:31:40] air and a relief when the word it came
[1:31:42] and it set set free those sisters that
[1:31:46] were sitting there and thinking you know
[1:31:48] maybe they should be preaching and man
[1:31:50] they were getting inspiration and maybe
[1:31:51] you know they were well you know you are
[1:31:53] the fifth gospel. Yeah.
[1:31:56] Is that all right?
[1:31:58] But what a relief it brought to their
[1:32:00] lives to realize God didn't require me
[1:32:04] to be a priest in his house even though
[1:32:06] we are called a kingdom of priest in
[1:32:09] terms of being endowed with the spirit
[1:32:11] of God.
[1:32:14] All these instruments have their have
[1:32:16] their place. That's why brother Brandham
[1:32:18] said I wouldn't try to drive my
[1:32:19] automobile through the cornfield.
[1:32:21] Probably some of y'all know people that
[1:32:22] tried to do that. you know, they got a
[1:32:24] four-wheel drive and they they lost
[1:32:26] their mind. I use the automobile to
[1:32:29] travel back and forth and I use my plow
[1:32:31] in the cornfield. So, I ain't got
[1:32:33] nothing against the plow. I haven't got
[1:32:35] nothing against the automobile. They
[1:32:36] both are instruments to be used here for
[1:32:39] the
[1:32:40] embedment of
[1:32:43] mankind. So, it's control,
[1:32:47] right? Control is not a bad word. That's
[1:32:49] a word that the prophet uses over and
[1:32:52] over. As a matter of fact, when it comes
[1:32:53] to that of the supernatural gifts and
[1:32:57] when a person says, "I can't help it."
[1:32:59] Oh, yes, you can. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, you
[1:33:02] can. That's good. Oh, no. We You can be.
[1:33:06] It's not quenching the spirit. But God
[1:33:09] is calling us to recognize that we're
[1:33:11] not puppets just being drugged around.
[1:33:14] But God has placed the gifts and the
[1:33:16] spirit, the Holy Spirit, that we are to
[1:33:19] be operated within his presence. Brother
[1:33:23] Bram says, "People with these gifts
[1:33:24] don't know how to control them." Now
[1:33:28] watch the real Watch this. Watch what he
[1:33:30] says about Peter talking about man mount
[1:33:35] transfiguration. Peter got all excited.
[1:33:38] Usually men do when they're in the
[1:33:40] presence of the
[1:33:41] supernatural. Usually they can't control
[1:33:43] themselves because they're creatures of
[1:33:45] the earth and yet they're creatures of
[1:33:47] heaven too. Right? We're going to keep
[1:33:49] reading though. But that foretaste just
[1:33:52] runs them wild. That's what happened to
[1:33:56] the Pentecostal church. That foretaste
[1:33:59] you don't know how to control
[1:34:02] yourself. You get all out of reason. The
[1:34:07] Holy Ghost is a gentleman.
[1:34:11] Oh, I just can't help it. No, no, no,
[1:34:13] no. We can't help it. We can't help it.
[1:34:16] This is why Brother Ram goes on. He
[1:34:19] says, you know how they will raise up
[1:34:20] and you know, you don't know how to
[1:34:22] place those gifts and tongues
[1:34:23] interpretations while the preacher
[1:34:25] speaking. Sometimes they'll raise up and
[1:34:27] speak and write while the preacher
[1:34:28] speaking. That's contrary to the Bible.
[1:34:30] Oh, God, give me a message of this and
[1:34:32] it's fresher than the Bible. No, it's
[1:34:34] not.
[1:34:36] That's good. Yeah. You know what the
[1:34:38] prophet called that in Christianity
[1:34:40] versus idolatry? When they said that to
[1:34:42] him, he called that another Roman
[1:34:45] Catholic idol.
[1:34:48] And let me tell you, any idea that will
[1:34:51] not bow to the word of God is a Roman
[1:34:54] Catholic idea.
[1:34:56] You can be so and we should be dead set
[1:34:59] against the spirit of organizationalism.
[1:35:02] But let me tell you something. That
[1:35:04] Roman Catholic spirit is a dominating
[1:35:06] spirit. It's an unbending spirit, an
[1:35:09] unsubmitting spirit. It's a dominating
[1:35:11] female that won't stand correction to
[1:35:14] the word. Hallelujah. That's right. And
[1:35:16] it has no place because it's showing
[1:35:19] it's showing that's not his bride.
[1:35:23] That's not his wife. When that comes out
[1:35:25] against him,
[1:35:27] I don't have to. And you know what?
[1:35:29] God's such a gentleman. He don't make
[1:35:30] nobody. God ain't going to make anybody
[1:35:32] go in the rapture.
[1:35:35] No, he ain't gonna make
[1:35:37] nobody. You know what it is? It's what's
[1:35:40] already on the inside of us.
[1:35:43] The Holy Spirit didn't put something in
[1:35:45] us. The Holy Spirit come to raise up
[1:35:47] that part of himself that was already on
[1:35:51] the inside.
[1:35:53] And so the real coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:55] in your life upon that seed allows you
[1:35:59] to cooperate with the vision God had
[1:36:01] before the foundation of the world. Yes,
[1:36:03] sir.
[1:36:06] Good preaching. Praise the Lord. Does he
[1:36:08] have control at all over the spirit as
[1:36:10] to when and how to act? Does he have
[1:36:12] control?
[1:36:14] Does he? Well, let's listen to the
[1:36:17] prophet messenger of the day. The Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit controls. Yes, sir. It has
[1:36:21] control of you and you have control of
[1:36:24] it. It'll never make you do anything
[1:36:27] contrary to the scripture. The spirit
[1:36:30] does not misbehave itself unseemly.
[1:36:36] Hallelujah. Don't you just love the word
[1:36:38] of God? That's why brother Brandham in
[1:36:40] this same quote and message, let me just
[1:36:43] refer to it. I don't want to put I'm not
[1:36:46] putting up there. I got it right here.
[1:36:47] And but brother Random when he says he's
[1:36:50] talking about how that when tongues and
[1:36:53] interpretation and when that sets down
[1:36:55] upon a person and brother Brandham
[1:36:57] parallels that with what takes place on
[1:36:59] the path platform and remember when
[1:37:01] brother Brandon would come out of that
[1:37:02] he would say uh what whatever he said
[1:37:06] right and brother Brandon will tell us
[1:37:08] that that's way he he'll say in this
[1:37:11] same message that tongues itself when it
[1:37:13] drops it drops like a supernatural
[1:37:16] combustion upon on the person and he
[1:37:18] said just overtaken them and he said and
[1:37:20] that's how that even the interpretation
[1:37:23] does and I love how brother Neville
[1:37:24] spoke up and said just a moment brother
[1:37:26] Brandon just a moment just a moment now
[1:37:29] you're not intending to say that that a
[1:37:32] that a person couldn't control
[1:37:35] it says a man that has a gift is
[1:37:38] supposed to be in control of it he can
[1:37:42] control himself you're so so brother
[1:37:44] Neville said you're supposed to be
[1:37:46] conscious enough to know that he's about
[1:37:48] to speak in tongues. Brother Bram said,
[1:37:49] "That's exactly right." So, it's not as
[1:37:52] though that it's just, "Wow, I didn't
[1:37:54] know what was going to take place." No,
[1:37:55] Brother Bram says if he's not conscious
[1:37:57] enough, it's already out of order.
[1:38:02] Now, now listen, let's let's let the
[1:38:04] Holy Spirit take this beyond just nine
[1:38:07] spiritual gifts. Let's let him take it
[1:38:09] down into our everyday
[1:38:11] life because there's situations that you
[1:38:14] have to approach and that I have to
[1:38:16] approach. There's situations not only as
[1:38:18] a pastor but as a husband, as a father,
[1:38:22] as coworker, on and on. There's
[1:38:24] situations that you have to approach
[1:38:26] that you have to wait on the timing of
[1:38:28] the Lord. Yeah.
[1:38:32] And even in the approach of it as even
[1:38:35] into what tool to use because using the
[1:38:37] wrong tool could be the wrong thing. You
[1:38:40] could be taking a shovel and a pick to
[1:38:43] an area that just needs to be loosened
[1:38:45] up with a hole.
[1:38:48] You see it goes see how it goes so much
[1:38:50] deeper than just how the word this is an
[1:38:52] application in this hour. Notice brother
[1:38:56] Bram even dealing with shouting. He said
[1:38:57] you know he said in the same quote he
[1:38:59] said it even deals with people. He said,
[1:39:01] "Fixing to shout, you know, but he said,
[1:39:03] you could be standing there," he said,
[1:39:04] "and all of a sudden in the present, in
[1:39:05] front of the president," he said, "and
[1:39:06] you all of a sudden turn loose, they're
[1:39:08] going to think you're
[1:39:09] crazy." He said, "But you you need to
[1:39:12] know
[1:39:13] when." It's just like in a service, you
[1:39:15] know,
[1:39:16] when there's things how God will touch
[1:39:19] our lives, and it isn't something we're
[1:39:20] saying, "Brother Aaron, shout right now.
[1:39:23] Brother Brother Shane, shout right now."
[1:39:26] No, you understand you. We've been right
[1:39:29] here. Not only here, you've been in
[1:39:30] other places, but we don't even have to
[1:39:32] leave here to where all of a sudden
[1:39:33] there'll be a spontaneous like
[1:39:35] combustion and all of a sudden it just,
[1:39:37] you know, it just it just it roars at
[1:39:39] that moment. Isn't it incredible how God
[1:39:42] moves together the synchronization? Why?
[1:39:46] So nothing is lost, but all are able to
[1:39:50] rejoice.
[1:39:53] You see, that's that's why we don't want
[1:39:55] to be in because if you're just one
[1:39:58] little fish by yourself, you ain't a
[1:39:59] school of fish. Nope.
[1:40:02] I don't care how much lateral line you
[1:40:04] got. There ain't you're lateral line.
[1:40:07] You have no other fish around
[1:40:09] you. Are you hearing me? Y'all have
[1:40:12] watched fish sometimes even in
[1:40:14] documentaries and man they'll move like
[1:40:16] this and like that and and they they'll
[1:40:17] move in that way even to throw off seals
[1:40:20] and and sharks and other things and they
[1:40:22] make themselves so with just going in
[1:40:25] that grouping or in that pattern. And
[1:40:27] the whole thing that the seals and
[1:40:29] dolphins and killer whales will do is
[1:40:31] they swim right into the midst of that
[1:40:34] to try to break up unity
[1:40:38] and get some off so they can go to
[1:40:40] feeding.
[1:40:43] This is why as God brings us together,
[1:40:47] this is why the real order of the Holy
[1:40:48] Spirit, it's not one just out here doing
[1:40:51] their own little thing. Right. It's a
[1:40:53] body that's moving in the symphony of
[1:40:56] the word. It's got the lateral line of
[1:41:00] predestination. Amen. That's catching up
[1:41:02] every turn and and move going up and
[1:41:05] moving this way and moving that. It's
[1:41:07] catching the moments of transition.
[1:41:12] Oh, don't you love him?
[1:41:15] So, the Holy Spirit, he will recognize
[1:41:17] his word to be true.
[1:41:19] He'll always recognize his word to be
[1:41:21] true. That's that's why brother Bram
[1:41:23] says as long as you he said like brother
[1:41:25] Neville standing here preaching in the
[1:41:27] platform. He said and here he is under
[1:41:29] making an altar call whatever he's
[1:41:30] doing. As long as he's in the pull pit
[1:41:32] and his voice is moving he's under the
[1:41:35] inspiration of God or should be. And
[1:41:37] then he said when he gets finished then
[1:41:39] the spirit of God will go to fallen in
[1:41:42] the meeting. In other words when it's
[1:41:44] moved from here it can move into that
[1:41:46] channel and into that place of God. If
[1:41:48] there's a message that is to be given
[1:41:50] there to the church that God sees that
[1:41:53] is that is that is his will. Now brother
[1:41:56] Bram it fell on me in the beginning.
[1:41:58] Brother Brham talking about right during
[1:42:00] the service while it's going on you know
[1:42:02] well brother Brand said I know it's true
[1:42:04] but it isn't the spirit falling on you
[1:42:06] brother the spirit the sister whoever
[1:42:08] you are the spirit is subject to the
[1:42:10] word. So the Holy Spirit will never
[1:42:13] interrupt the word.
[1:42:15] He won't do that. That that's confusion,
[1:42:19] right? It'd be like somebody it'd be
[1:42:21] like God giving you orders and somebody
[1:42:23] else coming around and you know a
[1:42:24] different orders. God stays with his
[1:42:26] word. Amen. Now, let me bring this
[1:42:30] down. Brother Brandon goes in. He
[1:42:33] says it's a gift of God and it wants to
[1:42:37] go forth and do something. What does the
[1:42:41] gift does? It's enthused. What's
[1:42:44] enthused? the gift is, but it's got to
[1:42:48] come under subject to the Holy Spirit.
[1:42:51] Right? So sometimes a person is doing
[1:42:54] something because of the gift and not
[1:42:57] under the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[1:43:00] So the prophet's bringing this down
[1:43:03] right here and showing us this. He said,
[1:43:05] "Now watch, Paul said, if a man speaks
[1:43:07] with tongues in the church and there be
[1:43:09] no interpreter, let him hold his peace."
[1:43:11] See, this shows control. If if the
[1:43:14] tongues are spoken, some of you reading
[1:43:16] ahead of me. If the tongues are spoken,
[1:43:18] I want you to hear what I'm saying. If
[1:43:20] the tongues are spoken, notice the
[1:43:22] scriptures. I skipped over many in our
[1:43:24] text that shows there is a control. If
[1:43:27] there be no interpreter, hold your
[1:43:29] peace. Well, I can't. Yes, you can. Yes.
[1:43:33] Right. That's the same way. Listen,
[1:43:35] friends, let's let him apply. Go deeper
[1:43:38] than that. That's why. Well, I was there
[1:43:39] with my husband and I couldn't hold my
[1:43:41] peace. Yes, you can.
[1:43:43] I was on the job and I just couldn't.
[1:43:45] Yes, you can.
[1:43:48] You are not somebody who belongs in an
[1:43:51] asylum that's lost control. That is not
[1:43:54] what the prophets were when it said they
[1:43:57] were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. It
[1:43:59] wasn't that they were walleyed and out
[1:44:01] of their mind. It was the inspiration of
[1:44:03] the Holy Spirit that lifted them up to
[1:44:07] catch the knowledge that was above
[1:44:10] earthly knowledge and bring it back
[1:44:11] down. Amen.
[1:44:15] Is that right? Now, so within this,
[1:44:19] notice he said it's got to come under
[1:44:21] that of the subject of the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:23] Now, if a man speaks with tongues in the
[1:44:25] church and there be no interpreter, let
[1:44:27] him hold his peace. No matter how much
[1:44:29] he wants to speak, watch this, how much
[1:44:32] it's crying out in him to speak. That's
[1:44:36] the gift.
[1:44:39] Wow.
[1:44:40] So the gift is separate from the Holy
[1:44:42] Spirit.
[1:44:44] The gift is actually crying out. Do you
[1:44:46] realize and see that sometimes where the
[1:44:49] confusion has come and why some have
[1:44:53] wrestled with things because they feel
[1:44:56] it's God that's leading me and it's not
[1:44:58] the Holy Spirit, it's the gift.
[1:45:02] Now you say, Brother Samuel, the results
[1:45:04] will speak for themselves. I can take
[1:45:06] you to where the prophet called miracle
[1:45:09] lines. And when he called those miracle
[1:45:12] lines, there was nothing scriptural
[1:45:16] about that. And he called them miracle
[1:45:19] lines. Bring your hardest cases and put
[1:45:21] them up here first. And there was number
[1:45:24] after number after number that were
[1:45:27] being healed. And brother Bram comes
[1:45:29] into the message and he says, "He hasn't
[1:45:32] spoke to me for six months.
[1:45:35] Wow. Because he said, "I've done
[1:45:37] something that's not even patterned in
[1:45:40] the scriptures."
[1:45:42] You say, "What was that?" That was the
[1:45:44] gift moving in compassion.
[1:45:49] Just stay with me here. It's very See,
[1:45:52] see when when God begins to break this,
[1:45:54] you know what it does? It begins to
[1:45:57] loosen. It begins to loosen
[1:46:00] ideas, minds, or thoughts of
[1:46:04] bondage where people feel like as though
[1:46:07] they're disappointing, displeasing
[1:46:11] God. Oh, I thank God for the loosening
[1:46:14] of I thank God for freedom. Don't you?
[1:46:17] That's the gift. That's the gift. So we
[1:46:20] understand that that that that that the
[1:46:22] sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:46:24] God. Now brother Brandon says he goes
[1:46:27] into he says now even I see it many
[1:46:30] times with the gift that the holy spirit
[1:46:32] has given me to pray for the sick. I see
[1:46:35] a time here where it said the gift oh
[1:46:38] there's some poor little fellow. I must
[1:46:40] pray for him. My heart just feel for
[1:46:42] him. And the Holy Spirit said leave him
[1:46:44] alone and go over here to this one.
[1:46:50] Oh my. No matter what the gift
[1:46:55] says, it's got to yield to the spirit.
[1:46:58] So the gift can talk.
[1:47:02] You know, a gift could tell somebody
[1:47:04] even there might be a special singer,
[1:47:06] you need to go sing right now. It's got
[1:47:09] to yield to the spirit.
[1:47:12] Now, if it doesn't, there's an order
[1:47:14] that God has set within his word within
[1:47:17] the church that will bring in an
[1:47:19] order. And how it responds to that will
[1:47:22] determine what spirit was even leading
[1:47:25] them in the first place. That's a direct
[1:47:28] quote because if the spirit because if
[1:47:31] the person can't take correction, it
[1:47:33] shows the spirit on them doing what was
[1:47:36] being done was not the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:40] Why? because he's subject to the word.
[1:47:44] No matter what the gift says, it's got
[1:47:45] to yield to the spirit. That's why Paul
[1:47:47] said that gift right in there in
[1:47:49] congregation will yield to the prophet.
[1:47:51] You got to yield to the order. It's a
[1:47:53] gift. And he said, I hope that explains
[1:47:56] that. He picks up one more. One more. He
[1:48:00] said, "When a man," Brother B just goes
[1:48:02] on this, I just love it. He says, "When
[1:48:03] a man speaking or preaching up here on
[1:48:05] the platform, a message going forth, if
[1:48:07] the man is a man of God, he's anointed
[1:48:08] of the spirit to preach the word." And
[1:48:10] that's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit
[1:48:12] is moving there. That's just your gift
[1:48:15] there trying to get you started.
[1:48:19] Woo.
[1:48:21] Oh, I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. I
[1:48:23] know God wants me to do this. Wow. So
[1:48:26] many times, listen friends, I'm not
[1:48:28] saying this to I'm saying these things
[1:48:31] to be a help.
[1:48:33] You can just take the term impression
[1:48:35] and impressions. Trust me, I studied
[1:48:38] this for months and months before we
[1:48:40] ever dealt. Many times it's
[1:48:45] impressions when it can start to get
[1:48:47] moving. I don't want to say many as far
[1:48:48] as giving a percentage, but I'm saying
[1:48:50] you we always have to check it. And you
[1:48:53] know, one of the simplest ways to check
[1:48:54] it is check it right with the word of
[1:48:56] God right in the order that God has
[1:48:58] given. That's the simplest way to check
[1:49:00] it. Well, I know so and so patting me on
[1:49:03] the back. That's not vindication. Amen.
[1:49:07] That's not vindication. Remember the man
[1:49:09] who played there on on on the platform
[1:49:12] and the prophet gives this example. All
[1:49:14] the audience was standing and
[1:49:16] applauding. He didn't even look at them.
[1:49:19] He looked in the
[1:49:21] balcony and he wanted to see what does
[1:49:25] he
[1:49:26] say. That's how our lives are. Cuz we
[1:49:28] can have a lot of plotting and alkales.
[1:49:30] And let me just tell you something.
[1:49:32] There's a lot of things that I feel and
[1:49:34] I feel and sometimes there's things you
[1:49:36] know what I thank God that people are
[1:49:37] cordial enough and gracious enough to
[1:49:39] not all of a sudden bury somebody and
[1:49:41] say that was wrong you but I'm so glad
[1:49:43] that we can be able to shake hands and
[1:49:45] say God bless you thank you and go on
[1:49:48] because you know what God will correct
[1:49:50] all things and bring it all into the
[1:49:53] order of his word.
[1:49:56] We can be real sons and daughters of
[1:49:58] God, real gentlemen like the Holy Ghost
[1:50:00] is. Amen. Is that right? Oh, blessed be
[1:50:03] his name. That's where the gift wants to
[1:50:05] get started trying to get you started.
[1:50:07] But the Holy Spirit is coming through
[1:50:09] the word and the Holy Spirit will always
[1:50:11] the Holy Spirit. He feeds on the word
[1:50:12] and it'll recognize this word and be
[1:50:15] reverent. Let's
[1:50:21] stand. Brother Brandon said that in
[1:50:23] little that gift in his life would, you
[1:50:26] know, it'll go out there
[1:50:29] and says, you know, to go take care of
[1:50:32] this little one. And brother Brand said,
[1:50:33] "My poor heart's beating for that little
[1:50:35] fella right there. Here sets a lady over
[1:50:37] here with female trouble, and the angel
[1:50:39] will never touch that woman laying right
[1:50:41] there. It'll go right beyond her and say
[1:50:44] to this other one, "Thus sayeth your
[1:50:45] healed, now me." Watch. Now me, my gift,
[1:50:50] I want to get to that woman there. And
[1:50:54] what's he saying? My gift wants to get
[1:50:57] to that woman, but the Holy Spirit says,
[1:51:00] "Go over here."
[1:51:02] I'm saying, Lord, no matter where we're
[1:51:05] applying this in every phase of our life
[1:51:07] as he's been leading us here tonight,
[1:51:10] going beyond just the nine spiritual
[1:51:12] gifts, leaving even beyond these walls,
[1:51:14] but in our own everyday wall, there's
[1:51:17] sometimes where we've had a notion to do
[1:51:21] something. But thank God, we've waited
[1:51:24] on him.
[1:51:26] Sometimes even in on that waiting on
[1:51:28] him, you know, it can get to a place we
[1:51:30] think, am I moving fast enough? Yeah,
[1:51:32] that's good. Should I have or should I
[1:51:34] have not and should and we're yeah,
[1:51:38] brother, I can't go into that in
[1:51:40] Revelation series, but he deals with
[1:51:41] that. But you know, Paul and Paul all
[1:51:44] the way through the scriptures, Philip
[1:51:47] was having, they were having amazing
[1:51:48] services in Samaria.
[1:51:50] It didn't make sense to take Philillip
[1:51:54] as far as in our minds from here down to
[1:51:57] meet a
[1:51:58] unic. But that's what God's will was.
[1:52:01] And what did he do? He obeyed. And he
[1:52:04] obeyed and he was transported like a
[1:52:07] thought. Right? Because there ain't no
[1:52:09] way he made it there just by walking or
[1:52:10] running.
[1:52:13] See, God already had that transportation
[1:52:14] already there. You see, it just shows us
[1:52:17] that that that many times just just
[1:52:19] submitting to God's will. He can take us
[1:52:21] places that we can think it could take a
[1:52:23] long time to get there. All it takes is
[1:52:25] just a surrender. All it takes is just
[1:52:28] submission and God can take us right
[1:52:30] there. Lord, cleanse me. Lord, take let
[1:52:32] I surrender, Lord, to take us there.
[1:52:36] Lordise, Paul said, I I I want to go to
[1:52:40] Asia. Spirit forbid him. That's what the
[1:52:42] scripture said. He had a notion. There
[1:52:45] was a woman preacher following him
[1:52:47] around. These men be the men of God and
[1:52:50] going on. Paul knew he had power to cast
[1:52:54] that devil
[1:52:56] out. But he waited
[1:52:59] until the right time.
[1:53:02] This is why Paul could say, "I'm a
[1:53:05] prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:08] I'm not a prisoner to my own feelings."
[1:53:11] He had them because he describes them in
[1:53:14] Corinthians. He isn't it funny how he
[1:53:16] can relate to the Corinthian church
[1:53:17] letting them know listen I still have
[1:53:19] feelings like you do. He could say
[1:53:21] remember I was despised but not cast
[1:53:24] down. He could relate to all that. I
[1:53:26] still have feelings but he did not allow
[1:53:29] feelings to be placed above the
[1:53:33] word. He took always his feelings took
[1:53:36] those things and that's a constant
[1:53:38] that's constant. It's constant in our
[1:53:40] lives. constantly submitting to the word
[1:53:43] of God. But you know what that proves?
[1:53:46] That's showing pride. That's what that's
[1:53:49] what that's showing because others ah I
[1:53:52] don't want that. Remember Rebecca's
[1:53:54] remember what Rebecca's her her her her
[1:53:57] brother and them they didn't want to go
[1:53:59] but give us the gifts. They were content
[1:54:01] with the gifts. They didn't want to go
[1:54:03] but she was willing to go.
[1:54:07] And that's the thing. Oh God, what a
[1:54:09] great value. What a great treasure.
[1:54:11] Friends, don't listen. I know many times
[1:54:13] you're looking, you might say, "Oh, if I
[1:54:15] if I had this, you know, to be able to
[1:54:17] this testimony and this testimony to
[1:54:20] share with my coworker, share with my
[1:54:21] coworker." You know, the greatest
[1:54:23] testimony is first of all, you're in
[1:54:24] your right mind right here tonight.
[1:54:27] Another thing is another great testimony
[1:54:29] is is the word of God is living right
[1:54:30] through your life.
[1:54:32] And you know, a great a real great
[1:54:33] testimony is you've got a heart that
[1:54:35] wants to obey the word of God more than
[1:54:38] anything else. And obedience is better
[1:54:43] than sacrifice.
[1:54:45] Hallelujah. Sometimes it's the little
[1:54:47] things, but God looks on the heart.
[1:54:50] Don't you love him? Oh God, let's just
[1:54:55] pray. Heavenly
[1:54:57] Father, I'm sure Lord every one of us
[1:55:00] Lord here tonight those it's Lord not
[1:55:03] only in the visible but invisible as
[1:55:06] well. Lord
[1:55:08] Jesus, this is our heart's
[1:55:11] desire is the Lord to be fully a
[1:55:14] prisoner of Jesus
[1:55:16] Christ. Lord that has
[1:55:20] your
[1:55:21] bride, the lamb's wife. I always thought
[1:55:24] that was so tremendous how it's
[1:55:26] included. It doesn't say the lion's
[1:55:28] wife. It says the lamb's wife. It speaks
[1:55:30] she's got a corresponding nature of her
[1:55:34] husband, a lamb that can be led. Lord
[1:55:39] Jesus, help us here tonight, Lord.
[1:55:42] Father, you've graced us with your
[1:55:45] presence. Things that, Lord, that you've
[1:55:47] spoke to our
[1:55:49] hearts, Lord. ministered
[1:55:52] Lord not to put us in a corner but to
[1:55:56] relieve Lord
[1:55:58] ideas
[1:56:00] thoughts your prophet called it
[1:56:02] leavvening Lord that would just Lord
[1:56:05] just not meant there's not one of us
[1:56:08] Lord no one ever meant to carry things
[1:56:11] over the Corinthian church never meant
[1:56:14] this but your prophet told
[1:56:18] us there in 196 63 church
[1:56:21] order. We know that you taught through
[1:56:24] Paul, the Ephesian church, Thessalonica
[1:56:27] church. They didn't just understand the
[1:56:31] gifts by osmosis. They were taught it.
[1:56:34] But here in
[1:56:36] Corinthians, there had to come
[1:56:39] correction. And your prophet told us
[1:56:41] it's because they made it an issue.
[1:56:48] Lord, help
[1:56:50] us. Help us, Father. Forgive us, Lord,
[1:56:55] in places in our lives that even goes
[1:56:58] beyond the gifts where we've made things
[1:57:03] issues. Lord God, you never intended
[1:57:07] things themselves in one way to be a
[1:57:09] struggle. But Lord, sometimes, well, all
[1:57:13] the time, Lord, the greatest enemy I've
[1:57:16] got is
[1:57:17] Samuel. He's my biggest
[1:57:21] enemy. Lord
[1:57:24] Jesus, I just,
[1:57:27] Lord, I want to, Lord, with all of my
[1:57:30] heart, I want to love you
[1:57:34] more, Lord. I want to with everything
[1:57:37] that's within me,
[1:57:39] Lord, as there's things, Lord, that
[1:57:41] you've brought across my
[1:57:43] path, even Lord, as you would deepen our
[1:57:47] understanding through these times, Lord,
[1:57:51] not just within this series, but in
[1:57:53] other Lord God, as we're walking with
[1:57:55] you, walking in this word, Lord, we can
[1:57:58] fellowship on this that our our
[1:58:01] understanding has become fruitful, Lord.
[1:58:06] Not just something that has become
[1:58:08] knowledge where we can repeat things but
[1:58:10] Lord where it's become a practical
[1:58:14] outworking. Lord
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:19] Jesus help us Lord every one of
[1:58:23] us. Lord when I read this text here
[1:58:26] tonight I was reading of a group of
[1:58:28] people.
[1:58:30] They had great
[1:58:34] enthusiasm. your prophet Lord as I
[1:58:36] looked and have studied on that Lord on
[1:58:38] times on enthus
[1:58:40] enthusiasm he'll bring that Lord in two
[1:58:42] veins of
[1:58:44] thought and he'll show us that that sure
[1:58:47] there's times just as I read in these
[1:58:49] quotes where a gift itself alone can get
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:54] enthused Lord
[1:58:56] Jesus but there's a real enthusiasm that
[1:59:00] comes from the vine through the branches
[1:59:04] us. And it's an enthusiasm, Lord,
[1:59:07] that'll move us right into the
[1:59:10] word. You never come to take our
[1:59:12] enthusiasm
[1:59:14] away. Lord, if our enthusiasm is limited
[1:59:19] to our own
[1:59:20] ideas, then that's not the enthusiasm
[1:59:23] you
[1:59:25] intended. That needs to be taken away
[1:59:27] because it's a real hindrance.
[1:59:31] But
[1:59:32] Lord, we want from that real source,
[1:59:35] that fountain that's open in the house
[1:59:36] of David. That's the real source of
[1:59:38] enthusiasm.
[1:59:40] Lord, when lives have been cleaned and
[1:59:42] set free, sin question answered, Lord
[1:59:45] God. Lord, drawing from that that
[1:59:48] fountain, that thanksgiving, Lord
[1:59:50] Jesus, of your presence in our lives.
[1:59:54] Help us, Father. Lord, I pray right here
[1:59:58] tonight, maybe as our heads is bowed,
[2:00:00] you'd want to be remembered in prayer.
[2:00:01] Maybe father, mother, husband, a wife,
[2:00:04] grandparent. You say grandparent. Oh
[2:00:06] yeah. Speaks of it in the book of
[2:00:08] Deuteronomy. But looking at all these, a
[2:00:10] co-orker, a brother, a sister, every one
[2:00:13] of us, deacon, trustee, song leader, on
[2:00:15] and on. So special singer.
[2:00:17] Lord, help me. Lord
[2:00:21] like your prophet when he talked about
[2:00:23] Paul he said he had a notion to go over
[2:00:26] there to Asia but the spirit as the
[2:00:29] scripture said forbid him and then he
[2:00:33] assayed to go there and the spirit
[2:00:36] suffered him not to go. Lord one thing
[2:00:39] about it is Paul was open to your
[2:00:43] leading. He tested things such as maybe
[2:00:48] a young person saying, "I I just it
[2:00:51] seems like I'm drawn to this particular
[2:00:54] thing right here in school, maybe career
[2:00:56] or trade, but always open to the leading
[2:01:00] of the Lord." Don't ever close your life
[2:01:02] with a period,
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:06] but always a
[2:01:08] comma. Always available for God to come
[2:01:11] by and interrupt our
[2:01:14] plans. Lord Jesus, help us tonight as
[2:01:18] husbands, as fathers, as mothers. Lord,
[2:01:21] there's
[2:01:22] pressures all around us. Things that
[2:01:24] Lord that would love to strip away
[2:01:29] enthusiasm in serving you. Giving our
[2:01:33] lives to you,
[2:01:35] Lord. Lord God, every one of
[2:01:38] us, there's a battle through this
[2:01:41] journey. Every one of us, Lord, we have
[2:01:44] to
[2:01:46] press. not pressing against our own
[2:01:49] nature when that nature has been changed
[2:01:52] but it's actually the subduing of this
[2:01:55] outer
[2:01:56] realms as Paul would say bringing it
[2:01:59] into
[2:02:00] subjection Lord God help
[2:02:03] us help every one of us
[2:02:06] Lord help us
[2:02:08] Lord oh God we might have notions of
[2:02:11] this and notions of that but may we
[2:02:14] always Lord God be reserved
[2:02:19] to your leading, Lord.
[2:02:22] Lord Jesus, your leading is peaceable.
[2:02:27] It's not arrogant. It's not detestable.
[2:02:29] It's not
[2:02:30] touchy. Your
[2:02:32] leading is that of the
[2:02:34] dove. It's
[2:02:37] peace. Lord Jesus, help us. Grant to us
[2:02:41] Lord God. Help us to in each situation
[2:02:44] of
[2:02:45] life. Grant to us Lord the knowledge
[2:02:47] that we have need of the real Holy Ghost
[2:02:50] knowledge. Lord
[2:02:52] help us
[2:02:55] Father. Grant it Lord. I
[2:02:58] pray in the name of Jesus
[2:03:01] Christ. Amen. Go ahead brother Brian. Go
[2:03:04] ahead.

[2:07:52] The more that I surrender, the more that
[2:07:56] I
[2:07:59] surrender, the
[2:08:02] lighter my
[2:08:05] Lord. Oh, that I release my
[2:08:12] cares takes control. Yes, Lord.
[2:08:17] more than I can humble
[2:08:22] myself. Lord, he lifts me
[2:08:26] up. Every day I
[2:08:29] live, Lord, I love you
[2:08:34] more. More than I surrender.
[2:08:37] Oh Lord, the more that I
[2:08:42] surrender, the
[2:08:44] lighter my
[2:08:47] Lord, I live. The more that I release my
[2:08:53] cares, the more you take
[2:08:58] control, the more that I can humble
[2:09:03] myself, more he lifts me
[2:09:07] up. Every day I live.
[2:09:12] Lord our love only gets
[2:09:17] easier and it gets
[2:09:20] easier to
[2:09:23] understand this road tingling down.
[2:09:28] There's no more
[2:09:31] wondering or
[2:09:33] wavering. I'm standing on solid
[2:09:38] ground and I know I'm here to my future
[2:09:43] home. For in the voice I hear is yours
[2:09:48] alone. Every day I live. Oh Lord, I love
[2:09:54] you.

[2:10:04] surrender, the
[2:10:06] lighter my
[2:10:08] Lord. And the more that I release my
[2:10:14] cares, the more he takes
[2:10:19] control, the more that I humble
[2:10:24] myself, the more he lifts me up.
[2:10:29] Every day I
[2:10:31] live, Lord, I love you
[2:10:38] more. And the problems I had won
[2:10:44] yesterday are stepping stones to a
[2:10:48] higher place. the trials that seem so
[2:10:53] awesome to me. Lord, they're now my
[2:10:56] banners of
[2:10:58] victory. And I know I'm headed to my
[2:11:03] future home. And the voice I hear is
[2:11:08] yours alone. Every day I'm Yes, Lord, I
[2:11:14] love you
[2:11:17] more. Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] Oh, the more that I

[2:11:27] higher my
[2:11:29] Lord, the more that I release my car.
[2:11:34] Oh, the more yes, he takes
[2:11:38] control. And the more that I can humble
[2:11:43] myself, the more he lifts me up.
[2:11:49] Oh, every day I
[2:11:51] live, Lord, I love you
[2:11:55] more. Every day I
[2:11:59] live, Lord, I love you
[2:12:05] more. One more chorus. One more chorus
[2:12:08] before we go. He's got it
[2:12:11] all in control.
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:18] He's got it
[2:12:21] all in
[2:12:25] control. Yes, he put that
