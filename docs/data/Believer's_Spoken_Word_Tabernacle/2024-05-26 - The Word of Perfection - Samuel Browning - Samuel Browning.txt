remember um continue to remember Sister Wilma in prayer I I didn't hear whether or not that there was a prayer request on that but um I didn't get a chance to mention to you last week um in regards to the surgery of the email that I had sent out and we had had prayer on last Thursday and uh in that request is that she had taken one test and it showed cancer so they did another test it showed cancer then they got into looking and said well it looks like there's an extra colon as well so they went in that's why the point of the surgery is to go in you know and obviously if there's cancer there uh which had showed up on previous two previous test to remove that as well as take care of that extra colon and surgery is supposed to be 4 hours and the things that sister Wilma was requesting and I couldn't write all that in the email was that that you know didn't want to have the lingering After Effects the possibilities of what could be from a surgery like that and um the Lord was so gracious the surgery was two hours long not four she didn't end up she didn't have to wear a bag and most importantly there's no cancer amen Our God still rains and I I when I received that call actually received the call from Sister pansy and I missed it but my wife had caught it and then I listened to it later on uh but when my wife told me I I tell you I had a praise break right there in the kitchen I was so so burdened uh for that need and uh just so thankful for the Lord's touch on sister Wilma's life so we want to continue to pray that the Lord will continue to give her strength as she recovers she hasn't been here in a few months because she had surgery on her feet and um the doctor told her when they had that surgery on her feet and said is actually the equivalency of two surgeries because the previous surgery the doctor didn't do it correctly and so that's why they had to go back in and take care of that work and redo it and just she's been she's getting around well but yet just after a little bit her feet will swell up and so she said just uh just just keep me in prayer that the Lord will just completely amen take care of that so let's just remember her in prayer hey the same God that took care of the cancer is the same God to take care of the feet amen so we want to do that as well uh also want to say um uh we want to just have prayer for also our son Ben I know he's he's at home he's a few days uh behind and he's kind of feeling a little bit under the weather you know how the allergies and things go and things get down you're coughing and things get down in your chest or so forth so he's he's he was wanting to come he said no you better stay so um we we want to ask you that you remember him in prayer and pray and if there's any other unspoken requests too we want to remember that I know they took that up earlier but I also want to say God bless sister kener it's good to have her and GRE back with us I tell you I'm just so thankful to that and how the Lord has brought our sister through amen we want to just now just turn our hearts Amen in prayer and just to these needs as well as as we prepare to open the word of God and to look into what the Lord would have for us here this morning Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful Lord for these precious moments that Lord that you give us Lord amen Lord we are are grateful Lord for

your strength Lord and your unction this morning Lord we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen thank you musicians amen let's go to Ruth amen chapter 2 and I want to go I want to go to verse eight we've it's been a few Sundays since we um that's spoke here on this and I jumped right in on it the last time in Ruth chapter 2 and verse 8 then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap go Thou after them have not I charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go into the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger so good and Boaz answered and said unto her it hath been fully showed me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and are come unto a people which thou knewest not hi to before and the Lord recompensed I want you to watch this verse the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward War be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust amen then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou Hast comforted me and for that thou H has spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though I be not like one of thine handmaids and Boaz said unto her at mil time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her now I want you to watch that he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left amen I'd like to just speak this this morning on a thought the word of perfection may God bless you and bless the word as you're being seated you know here in the Book of Ruth we recognize that as Boaz is speaking to her in this moment brother brandham when he would speak on Ruth and you catch it in the Revelation series you catch it in the breach you catch it in Redeemer Redemption kinsman redeemer it's very very rare that you'll find when the prophet would begin to speak on Redemption that the Ruth and that of Boaz does not come up because it's a very it's a very type of Christ in his bride and it's a very it's a book that speaks of the very hour that we're living in right now and the prophet would say it like this in one place in the message he said that baz when he saw Ruth and her character he said he already had in his mind what he was going going to do he already had that she didn't know that she wasn't aware of that but Boaz is aware of that and there are many things that though we look here in uh chapter 2 and you know that as you look in Chapter 2 very much you could almost conclude and say just as the prophet would go through that chapter 2 is very much a a chapter of sanctification she's responded to the to the call of the Holy Spirit God drawing her heart and there to come with Naomi but now as she's come into the into back into the land she's she begins to learn the customs of the land and how they dress and she's going along and doing this it's all under sanctification and remember it's even in this chapter brother B said she became a a legalist me you know not not a legalist in sense in a bad way but just there's things that if this is what he's saying and this is what's to be done and this is what I'm going to do and and you know it takes God coming in a deeper way within Ruth's life as it has in our life to take things from where it's just this is the right thing to do to where it's something that I desire to do it because of him so when when the love and the desires of the world is gone that it's all about him it's not a it's not a struggle anymore it's not it's not just a way of thinking anymore it is that that life that works within us that works to please him and this is exactly that notice that bohas himself sees all of this he has already all of this in mind and seeing her character but yet God just like Boaz with Ruth there has to allow that character to be displayed and allow the testing to come she's got to be tested throughout this journey even in Ruth chapter 2 she would receive a word of encouragement from her mother-in-law or rather admonition when she returns with this grain that she has gleaned and says don't don't you be found in another field now you stay right in his field and she's also going to be tested even though Boaz has said don't go after the young men she's going to be tested Boaz didn't put a bubble around her she's going to be tested in other words she's got decision to make just as she made an initial decision that's why you realize that when the Holy Ghost has come it doesn't remove decisions we we don't become robots but we become inspired and in tuned with the Living God and we're operating Under the Influence from another realm and because at one time we were operating by The Prince and power of the air that same spirit that now worketh Paul said then in the children of Disobedience no longer is it children it grew into a man of sin is that right this is the hour we're living in it grew so it matured it came to that place but notice that that that same the same holy spirit that at one time that where we walked under that influence but God in His Grace has brought an influence upon our life and let me say this if there wasn't anything in there to catch this influence it's just like this batter this this belt pack that I'm wearing going to that receiver that goes into the system if there was that receiver is not turned on if there is no receiver then there is not going to be any operation of this mic and that's why it's God bringing the influence that's why the Bible said it's not of him that willth or runneth it's God that showeth Mercy amen me just say it plain as day we couldn't find our way out of a paperback it takes the grace of God coming to our way to lead you and I out to Victory is that right and and really I feel that same way I need him every day I need him every moment he is the lead and guide of my life I need him at all times so through this though this be a chapter that we can look at that upon sanctification I want to remind you that when we think of the scripture where Boaz says has at Meal Time come hither um she's got to make that decision to come herself and notice all the way through this baz has not done one thing to discourage her as a matter of fact everything is set up to encourage her when you need refreshment there's water already drawn for you that's he's here to encourage you at Meal Time come and here she would come at meal time and he would reach her barley cakes he would reach her and we know what barley is a type of it's a type of resurrection power he would Minister to her the strength that was needed and this is why yeah turn this down a little bit please this is why that the prophet would say remember some would when it comes to going to the house of God and the church and remember one person said well you know brother brand I you know I don't believe in being a legalist I don't believe you got to go to church I I believe you can just do brother brand he's quickly said 64 question answer he said you better be legal on some things now you think well why must I be legal on some things because there are some things that we recognize that when it when it comes down to it there will be times that we may not feel and though there's a desire they if listen friends if there's not a desire within to be in the house of God then you really need to check up this is where the Prophet said in Christ the mystery you need to get to the Altar and say God God fill me with the love of God right so now because we're recognizing that within all of this there's a time that we have to say you know I I'm going because God is going to meet us there amen God knows what I have need of even when I'm at my lowest moment or a downtime or a test or a trial uh you know we we want to come because God has promise that he would meet us he said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be there and that's why the prophet when they were starting the church in Tucson and he spoke to the congregation and he says look he said he said we must assemble together to correctly worship God and he says if there's only two people there you be one of them right now to think when we see this in this manner let me just read to you here a few statements of that that the prophet would make and and just to take this into our hearts the prophet would say and I will restore in 1954 a man that's born of the spirit of God loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry the spiritual man on the inside has got to be fed and if that man isn't fed he will die the outward man isn't fed he will die and so will the inward man he goes on he said Jesus told Satan in the debate it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds s out of the mouth of God that's how man lives not by his bread alone but by the word of God man lives his outward man lives by Bread his inward man lives by the bread of God and let me just say it like this the bread of God is the revealed word for this hour if you were living in the days of Wesley that was the revealed bread of sanctification for that hour so the bread remember the bread is actually the person of Christ himself because remember he was typed as the Mana falling in the wilderness they had what they needed for that day is that right God promised he would provide what we have need of for this day and let me just say it like this God knew what would take place in this day spiritually God knew what would be taking place in your life today May 26th God know knows all about this and God has prepared what you and I have need of for this moment he is the bread of life he is that bread that come down from heaven amen a bread of life he is the source of Life yes sir So within this we understand it's just like when job I love how job says this when he says I I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food so I I need I need to hear from God more than I need anything else because listen there's a lot of things that you and I we could Fellowship on this I could try to fix I could try to solve we come here we bring burdens we bring our cares and we say Lord I need a word I need I need a word from you Lord I need strength Lord I I need help I need strength I I'm not too big to say Lord I need I need help my thoughts may be getting away from me I need a word from God I can have a good meal I could have a wonderful steak or whatever more but I need something that goes down on the inside to give me strength in my spiritual man because if if that's where I receive the strength there's where it's needed everything else will be ordered correctly my perspectives on everything else will be ordered correctly ly and we're in this life and oh how we need him we need this leadership amen that's how God leads us by feeding the word of God is that right that's how that's how his children are LED they're not led by a man saying go do this no we're led by the feeding of the word oh my now notice brother bam goes into this in the Attunement uh in in tement I want you to notice these words here he refers to that that scripture again where every man but we shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God go ahead and go to the next paragraph sister Brianna he says then how can you stay at stay home and be just a good a Christian as you would be at church you can't do it now there could be a lot of reasons and things within there but you know when I when I'm looking at this of how that the prophet would bring it that how can you stay home and be just as good a Christian as you would at church you can't do it must read the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church and the Holy Spirit watch this now and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you order it so who's bringing it he's bringing it he's the one that's giving it who was it that reached it to Ruth Boaz notice everything is set up to to encourage her in her journey he knows he knows what he has and what he is intending to do she doesn't know that secret that's in his heart that's it's a secret that's been in his heart nothing can pull that secret out no other men no one else that is a secret that only that can be disclosed to her at the proper time so good that's why God in this hour here's a Ruth on the scene where the secret of God is being disclosed to his children in this hour yes sir it's a secret it's that that part that God is unfolding all all that that with all that it's all been about down Through the Ages and how that every shadow and every type that's been through the scriptures it's been about you the Bride of Jesus Christ it's been of Christ himself taking a bride and that he himself would Tabernacle in a people that's the whole secret that is there is that he himself would take a people for his name sake this is why clear back in Genesis to you can all the way through the scriptures you can see the presence of the seven seal all the way through and and I I say this you've heard me heard me speak it enough the terminology itself should not stumble you the seven seal itself is simply Christ coming down to earth in the fullness and tabernacling in humanity thank you Lord It's God tabernacling deity in its fullness once again upon the Earth it's Christ it's the coming of the Lord Christ coming in our lives that makes us ready for his coming that's so good amen it's an event that's a secret to the rest of the world this that took place between U Boaz and Ruth it was a secret yes right that's right but it's here in In This Moment God is making it real to you and I let me just tell you it's not a bunch of information it's not a bunch of it's not a bunch of theology that's right but it's a spirit of God taking the word breathing upon it breathing into your life and letting you know that you were in his mind before the foundation of the world before there was atom Stardust or molecule you are already a son and daughter of God and there's nothing that can destroy that hall because you're a part of that word and God's word can not be destroyed if one word of God can be taken away or diminished then he's not God but God is the [Applause] word I want you to notice this and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you water this becomes our responsibility with Thanksgiving thank you Lord okay think I heard in the prayer very much of even like what brother uh Wendell had spoke there at the very end when God drops a promise in your heart don't look for some don't look for some sensation or some feeling begin to thank him because it's the word that must come to pass and when God's word has been spoken and it's spoken clearly to your life begin to thank God for it and every Divine promise will produce just exactly what God said it will do it's got to it's his word it's his life it's just like mzd when Abraham I'm trying to just lay this in here when when MDC met Abraham the same God that had called to Abraham knew Abraham all along now here Abraham sees him here in a form in a being and God reveals himself in this in this form of mezc as priest of the most high God one who is an intercessor one who goes in between to do what to make a way and what does he give what does he release to Abraham after the battle is over he gives him what's needed Bread and Wine this is why that even when we see that what took place on the day of Pentecost Jesus said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you must be a partaker of the word amen and to be a partaker of it is where we give our lives to it it it's not enough to hear it memorize it repeat it that's right it's got listen friends it's where we give our life to it that's right that's why the prophet said in spiritual food and due season he said if this is the truth and all that God has Vindicated and is the truth then we owe our entire life to it Hallelujah to him to this word that this word would have its way in our lives and this is why that even when we consider this that through this meeting with MDC Abraham he he received a call from God but it's in this meeting that Abraham has a blessing pronounced over his life that thou art Abraham of the most high God you're not just Abram of so and so and so and so you are of the most high God he's not talking to this man right here he's talking to that Son of God on the inside Blessed Be him who is possessor of heavens and earth Blessed Be him who has delivered the battle into your hands that's why when we're a partaker of the Bread and Wine then out of our hearts it Paul states that Revelation I am of the most high god he has delivered into my hands my enemies he has caused me to triumph over my enemies no matter habits whatever it is you can put it all down but it is God that causes you to be Victorious and because of that Abraham surrendered ties of all he gave the best he gave the choice part he gave that part unto God he recognized who was in his midst this is why the prophet said that this shows what every son of Abraham will do in the end time as they meet MDC that's so good it's a surrendering of Our Lives yes it is is that right right that soul is a type of the tithe it's that part because the bride itself is a tithe unto God is that right the Bride is a tithe unto God there's many that you know can come into the offering but it's like our soul our soul being a tithe unto God but your spirit and your flesh will be an offering it's what you want to offer if you just want to offer just a little bit you can offer just a little bit but listen it's about an offering and if God listen this is why oh I love it in the Psalms when David when David would write in the Psalms in the midst of battle he would say with with my whole heart oh God will I worship thee that's right when they would go to worship they didn't just give a little piece of an offering but they they opened up in times of worship Thanksgiving offerings it was with the whole entirety of that animal of that sacrifice I say if there's ever a time ever a people ever received a word from God that should be in the place to say God take every bit of my life Lord let my all be an off offing and if there's anything that's hindering me from offering my all Lord Purge it out of my life Lord he gives us just what we need I want to say that again he gives us just what we need he guides us he ministers to us just what we need the scripture here in John 14 and I want to just begin to take this this approach here he's giv us what he needs remember Boaz has all of this in his mind and God giving us what we have need of John 141 said let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am then there ye may be also as as the complete sacrifice as the one who had come here to represent and to manifest of what that Adam was in the garden prior to the fall here stands the second Adam and the second Adam being that of God himself because God God's a redeemer he could not send somebody else to redeem something that's his like you can't send somebody to the pawn shop to get something that's in there you got to go yourself if it belongs to you you got to go this is why Jesus is not the second person of the godhead the Holy Ghost is not the third person of the godhead it is God who was above us God who came down with us and the same God is now in US it that is redemption yes sir yes sir he came down to redeem his creation and this is why the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself it all began with that word that went forth and brought forth a body that the word itself could Tabernacle in yeah it was made in the likeness of sinful flesh but brother and sister it did not come by sexual birth that blood is the holy precious blood of the Lamb Peter called it the blood of Christ you know why because we couldn't be another man's blood I don't care how righteous a man would have been he still born in sin and we're still would be subject to the fall but there had to come one from above I hope you hear me he had to come from above he could not come from this polluted line there had to come one to stand on the stand on our behalf is that right and he had to go to Calvary he had to pay the price had to take our sins to hell and deposit them there and he raises on the third day and he's Seated on the right hand of the Majesty on high he's got Authority let me tell you something the same one that was here that could say to a person go and send no more the same one that were an epileptic child in fit would be dismissed the same one where demons would be cast out that had tormented and hounded a man throughout his life that same almighty God that demonstrated in that hour through the very veil of the Son of God was announcing that the Jubilee is on because there's already a free man right here and Christ himself manifested that he was the free man and not only the free man he became the high priest of his own word and he sent back the holy ghost that life that was in that blood cell that was in that free man that could call out and say you are free you are pardoned it was the Redeemer expressing Redemption that's he went to prepare a place make a way for you and I that we could come back to our inheritance Hallelujah you see this is why this this this word this message has meaning to you that's right that's why it's not just another movement that's why it's not just well there's are wonderful Miracles and my I tell you we this can be reproduced this is why that this message is more than that this message itself is a direct a direct message from the throne that Reve rals to you that you have an inheritance on the other side you were always a part of God hallelujah you know what that does it doesn't matter what kind of Darkness or Gloom or unbelief or whatever has hung over your life or might be hanging over your life there is a word before there was a Gloom before there was a doubt before there was an unbelief the word itself was already established and settled and that word cannot be defeated you might feel defeated this morning but your feelings are not the truth that's right let every man's words be a lie and let God's word be the [Applause] truth even your own thoughts that sometimes plague you about you God's word is the truth that's right you are a part of the truth the very God of Glory that stood there in Pilot's Hall he said I've come to Bear witness of the truth amen pilot said what is truth here was standing truth you know what truth was it was the manifested word it was the word that had been spoken all the way since there of the Fallen Eden it was that which was represented clear back before the foundation of the world now came the truth and let me tell you this truth that he came to bear witness of is that indeed God has and will have a bride he will have sons and daughters of God he was the first among many Brethren yes sir yes sir and he said in verse four whether I go in the way you know Thomas said Lord we don't know whether thou goes how can we know the way Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me that's good so now the way Thomas is looking for and say hey hey how are we going to know the way he said the way is right before you amen what what was the way the way was the word being manifested you see how simple it was they had been they they were overlooking it they were seeing what was taking place but you see to connect what it was all about it would take the grace of almighty God friends listen if it wasn't for God's grace you and I it would have went over our heads it wasn't because we were some great intellectual people H not at all it's the grace of God that has opened our [Applause] eyes that's what it is it's God's grace because you see the way itself it's kind of like when you think of in the days of the judges you know when all this was taking place and how the judges were here you know every man the Bible this says it a couple times in that every man did what was right in his own eyes whatever he thought and you know why they did it that way the prophet said it's because the word of the Lord was missing that's good they had the writings but they were missing the word of the Lord and the prophet said what that is is they didn't have a prophet among them a prophet is a mouthpiece of God a prophet is one who speaks the very Oracles of almighty God a prophet is a channel that God uses and anoints to see the on present conditions and be able to enter into that sphere in that realm to catch what God has already said and bring it down here to Earth that the people living on Earth can live in Heavenly places Hallelujah God has men to raise up into that channel and you know what that word becomes then we've got an absolute that's good so good then we've got a point of ending all Strife that's right amen Oh my he come to make a preparation this is why when the prophet would talk about this and he would go through that message things that are to be if you haven't listened to it in a while it' be good to go in through it that's a good way yes sir but the prophet's talking about all of this preparation God God is making a way for his people science he said in that time he said science is is making this he said it's it's sending up all these Sputnik and things I found it interesting how the prophet said it he said they're sending up all these satellites and stuff and he said all it's going to end up doing he said is just to spread disease found it interesting that would be said that way and he says you know he said but you need to look Beyond science you know science like to promise a lot of helps and cures and and there's a lot of things that even with science and and I they just put it this way let's just try to bring it down to To Nuts and Bolts that there's a lot of things that you can look at Within this world let me just let me just say it like this this world is beyond hope friends that's right I'm just going to tell you right now if you vote you vote but listen don't don't put all your eggs in the basket that's right don't put all your attention in the basket of well we got to get this and turn this around you can't Hallelujah that's right but the thing to do is turn Heavenly say God let me be so locked into what's going on in heaven Hallelujah because remember God knew you would be here that's right hallelujah oh brother Samuel we can't make it let me tell you something Trump didn't put nothing on my table that's right come on now that's right come on now you might get offended I like Trump but he didn't put nothing on my table I'm talking about not his character the things that was done you know but what I'm trying to say is and then you say well well he did this and he did that let me tell you something God promised he'd apply all my needs there is no little superscript writing that says unless Trump is in office or unless there's a republican you know both sides are as corrupt as corrupt can be that's right you see what I'm saying friends these things become traps of the enemy oh brother Samuel I love my country what do you love more do you love God more or do you love your country more preach brother Samuel it's a trap friends it's a trap to try to bring you down that's right come on now this is why God bringing his word in this hour what's he doing leading us to the things that we need to be feeding on let me tell you something right now if I get around you I can tell whether or not you've been listening to a lot of this junk brother Samuel do you I don't I'm just being honest with you I just don't I'm not trying to be naive once in a while there might be something that comes up on Israel I want to hear it you know if somebody's got to say something about this I want to hear it but the other things I you you say why because listen if you haven't caught it and seen it by now we are there are people that are completely insane and I'm not talking against the people friends this is an anointing of Darkness that's upon the earth I feel sorry for the people but it's the darkness that's overtaken the people but we're not to be overtaken with Darkness we're to be overtaken with the [Applause] [Music] light that's why the prophet picks it up in Shalom he says put your life in the hands of he who holds the future that's right that's right David said my times are in thy hand oh God so God has this preparation this thing that we're living in right now is an old pest house right I know that might be kind of new you know to the young ones and young ones they can go and look it up what's a pest house that's where they put all the diseased people yes it's like an ouse yep yes right sickness and everything will come around you know even while you're living here in in this pest house this is not what God intended no no God never intended for you and I to you know in this this body to be broke down and how things are God never intended that but what did that was sin amen are you hearing me this is why sometimes people we caught up and say this is a good person this person's good why did this have to happen to them listen it doesn't matter if they're good bad or one of more and let me tell you we're all in bodies of sin I hate seeing disease and things take a hold in people's body I've got a neighbor right now that oh my if if God don't intervene he won't be here much longer I told my wife the other day when I've looked at that I said I've heard that word cancer so much in this past year I hate that devil I hate that devil sometimes hearing it twice in one day and things coming oh I'm glad that we're going to a [Applause] place we're going to a body where they'll never be no more cancer no more sickness no more disease we're going to a land where there'll never be an ambulance there'll never be a funeral there'll never be a hospital there and as a matter of fact I'm not just talking about the future H I'm talking about the Millennium in the Millennium is where God will have Universal Health Care set up but the problem is you won't have to register for it if you're already pre-registered you've accepted the invitation been sealed with the spirit of God then here you will be gathered and there will be even others on the earth that will be raised during that time and will benefit from it and when it's all said and done we'll turn their backs and walk away that's amazing that's a that's a that's another message for another time let me try to get to where I'm getting to this is this this this what we're talking about this is not the father's house that we just read about but the father's house has many mansions there's a body that's reserved Peter said like this you you have a body through and by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ we have been begotten unto a lovely hope amen we we have a body that is undefiled uncorruptible unfaded reserved in the heavens are you hearing me this is where Paul would write if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting is that right see see the elect of God have one waiting over there now let me just let me just put Let me just drop this in here you see what this is it's calling us to a Perfection now let me just let me read this the other one the prophet said is called my father's house this is that of things that are to be I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of the pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are I'll take you out of the old Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exist it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said Jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom it must be a perfect people because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins the blood of Jesus Christ the dripping bloody word the word of God bleeding to wash the bride in she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it there's the father's house that he's going to prepare thank you Father Lord now I want you to think about this for a moment we have representation over there when we get over there on the other side remember when the prophet saw them over there I want you to remind you he said the sisters he said everybody was dressed there within gowns there was no makeup there was no toe gloss there fingernail polish no come on friends don't don't don't back up on me now you see going in the Rapture is not leaving all that behind it's the spirit of God calling to hearts that if there's things and listen friends there's things I know that if it continues to go deeper but if there's things that is there that's in the life that the spirit of God is calling out against listen malice ain't going to make it bitterness ain't going to make it Envy ain't going to make it those things have got to be settled on this time right are you hearing me Rapture morning ain't going to take care of it God has called you and I in this hour to live as sons of God just like that slave lived he knew he was the son of a king so he conducted himself in the same way this word is calling us to Perfection everybody's being influenced by Spirits remember here we are standing there's three Realms going up here's the Holy Spirit here you come then the the souls under the altar Heaven itself then you go beneath that you have the souls of the unjust then you have demons then you have hell itself so Mortals are living here in this in this in this uh in between space and there are spirits that are influencing them to do those things we've got a choice on what we are going to allow ourselves to be influenced by amen because let me tell you something the word of God will never lead you downward it won't Lead You downward in your thinking it won't Lead You downward in your actions it won't Lead You downward in your life the word does never go down because the word cannot be defeated how can you bury resurrection power you can't do it it'll come up even when you go through a test or a trial let me tell you something in a time when you're dying to yourself there's resurrection power there in your life that that resurrection power will guide you and see you through that test or trial and you'll come out stronger on the other side of it why cuz you can't keep that life down hallu that is good Hallelujah we have representation over there it's calling to us that's what I said that's why this message means something to you and I that's why the prophet said when you have heard this word and it's become Eagle food to you and you left the other thing you have heard from your theophany Hallelujah is that right that's right so now that representation and this is why that within a life that even has within a life that is calling out a seed of God on the inside is longing for life this is why that just accepting the Lord in the Forgiveness of your sins it's not enough there's something about it that you're thankful but there's more there's more there's more it's why that it comes to the sanctifying power of God that cleanses out the habits and the desires of the world but you know that's not enough there's something that says I want more I want more of God I want more what is that that's calling out for more of God it's not your intellect it's that seed on the inside that God knew would be here hallelu and here you are praying Lord I I want more Lord show me your way Lord I want to see I want to see a complete victory in my life Lord I want to see Lord a a real ceiling you promised the Holy Ghost to me Lord I I want to I want to grow Lord I I want to mature in my life Lord give me Grace to go through the test and the trials Lord Give Me Lord strength through adversity through these things that the virtues might move and abound in my life Lord give me Grace Lord that's why the prophet at the end of the message stat of a perfect man he could stand before the audience and he said oh he said I might not maintain my family I may not maintain my job I may not maintain a lot of things but let me maintain my relationship with Jesus Christ he said Almighty God he said before this congregation he said my hands raised in the air he said I will not stop nor cease till I see every one of these virtues flowing out of my life that is so good that's good like I told you the week before and I the the example but I don't think I finished it out it's like a suitcase you know you don't pack you don't pack an empty suitcase on a trip you take a suitcase you pack in at what you're going to need right but you don't get out everything when you get there and try to put on all your clothes now I know some people in here that could wear five outfits a day and I won't call their name but you see within that suitcase when I pack my suitcase to go somewhere I get out what I need when I need it right let me tell you something God's already packed in you all that you need the quickening power is what breaks the zipper it opens it up and all that is in there he begins to bring out there's times you say God I got to put on patience there's times I got to sink into this Garment of Brotherly kindness standing in somebody else's shoes and trying to think how they think and how they feel Lord there's times I need to stand there Lord and and have that that knowledge Lord that I need to have that God is faithful to his word you see all of that is packed in there but it's not just like you and I window shopping and saying I think I'll try on a little bit more patience it don't work that way it's when adversity and test and Trials Come is that right because remember for this age there is there is a bride that's going to sit on the throne remember when the sons of zebedee's mother asked the Lord Jesus granted that one of my sons will sit on the left and the right and the Lord Jesus basically how the prophet wraps it up and he says he said it's not for me to give that place has already been given in other words the test for for that was not going to come in that hour but the test would fall in this hour when the bride would come to complete maturity right it's a queen's position so this this call in this pull there from the other side it's something that's pulling upon our life this is why when there's things listen friends let me just say it like this the prophet made it so simple there within the message and he said just like he said when Mama is wanting something maybe she wanted pickles or ice cream and she's expecting you know she was expecting Junior daddy made sure he went out and got it it didn't matter what hour it was Daddy went and got it and Daddy got smart enough to say instead of running out at midnight let's just buy up a box of pickles why because there was something that was needed for that life that was being developed on the inside and this is why listen to me now this is why that when there are things in the spirit of God begins to strike upon a heart and God's dealing with a life that son and daughter of God on the inside they can't explain what's going on it's like Ruth in that field but begins to cry out Lord Lord give me Grace in this area of my life Lord take this out of my life Lord give me the strength Lord to rise show me the way and the prophet said you watch God will anoint a man of God and bring him to the pulpit and he'll preach exactly according to the very thing that's being craved in your life why that's God overseeing his children coming to pass that is so good God God's in charge of this does that make sense yes God's in charge of this I know brother Ram I read that quote to you last week or a couple weeks ago out of how can I overcome and brother BR said we we see the weak places we see where where where where the congregation is and where we should be and we ministers we study on that to catch where we are to where we should be that's true but how does a man of God see what needs to be seen unless God shows him that's right and even within that even with what he sees it has God releases what needs to be released in a season it can't get ahead of it it it could be it could be right on the dot it could be but if it's not in season it'll will fall right to the ground why God has an appointed season amen my my my my my so there's a focus here go to that scripture there Brianna Ruth 2 and verse 12 there's a focus I want you to notice this where the scripture said here the Lord recompense thy Work that's good now she's working she's laboring right now remember she's this is to gain favor right right on now once she comes into a place of rest she's no longer laboring to gain favor that's right are you with me yes sir this is why Works don't stop when rest has come that's why the prophet said Works itself is really to show your appreciation of the grace that's been given I don't need to do that because you won't feel like that well I don't need to do that this is not important no it's just that you begin you see the value and the value keeps on deepening that's right that's right yes coming to the house of God being in meetings has more of a value to me now than it ever did I've always believed in it I've always I've witnessed it in my own life I witnessed how I've walked in here and and my mind might be so clouded I'm talking about even when I'm sitting here and I W I witnessed let me just tell you what I've witnessed I witnessed where God will anoint the song leader to begin to sing songs and I can and the spirit of God will help me to catch it hey he's singing about while you're feeling right now but I'm here to remind you I am not going to leave you see God has the whole service set he's preparing everything set he knows what what he's going to do and bring forth in our life brother Samuel what are you saying I'm saying that the Bride of Jesus Christ is not an aimless people that just wandering around around and I'll feed this and I'll feed this our feeding is purposeful intentional under the direction of the Holy Spirit how can you say that because notice and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust that very word Wings is the same word of skirts she started out under the wings but when the wings became manifest come on now she slid under the skirt of Boaz a full reward be given thee what's a full reward friends what are we he for why is the word coming forth to make us better people in this world no that's not the goal that'll be an effect but that's not the goal the goal is the [Applause] rapture the goal is the rapture and if the goal is the rapture then God is giving you and I a word even in this season to give us strength to be caught away caught away from our own ideas catching away from how we've always acted I've always went about this way catching us away if we're people of the Rapture oh god there are quickening powers among us to catch us away we're not people that's going to continue a pattern a cycle of Revival and death but we are a people that are anointed for rapture are you hearing me we're called to grow and mature that's what this word has brought us to Pentecost live to their height Wesley Liv to their height Luther Liv to their measure but we are called to the full measure to the full stature and to grow up into him in all things and some of those things it's the it's uncomfortable but God gives you an the grace and he leads us through the feeding of the word to give us the strength to rise above our own Nativity to rise above our past to rise above previous molding to rise above things that could be buried so deep of hurts and complexes and things so deep there it's like fossils being dug up in the Earth today that could go down so deep but the grace of God will reach right down in there and bring that Deliverance sure does that's right this is why I want to say to you this morning we are now you hear this scripture said over and over we are now the sons of God not we're going to be we are right now amen the holy spirit is calling the sons and daughters that's why this message it had that's where it's to have an effect this message when it listen when we're feeding on the word of God we cannot remain the same way you can't feed on the divine nature and character of God and remain the same way there's things that's change that's going on in your life your heart's being changed your life's being changed you're watching change from the inside come to the outside why that's what real feeding is feeding is not going to church getting underneath the anointing and walking out that's not feeding cuz the Holy Ghost don't feed on anointing that's good he feeds on the word that's good when the anointing has come that is him letting you know he is here he's letting you know that he is the god of his word he's coming down personally for your life that's a time not just listen don't just get caught up in the moment but say God catch me up into you Lord let me be caught away Lord from all of my doubts let me be caught up into you Lord why we want to leave here has changed people is that right now we are the sons of God this is why the prophet remember he would talk about the New Birth being bornn again in his own life and he said oh he said when that struck me that day and he said and realized I'm not the son of Charles Anella brandham I'm a Son of God youtie how powerful that Revelation is yes it because listen there's a lot of claims that could come come down through your family and my family that's good yes sir Prophet said when I see a stubborn Spirit he said I can trace it all the way back and there's a grandpa or great great grandpa way on down there that's so good just gets handed on down but let me just tell you something right now I am not the I am not going to be the basket that's called the what do you call the lost and found is that all right you know like the laundry basket with a thousand pair of socks and take two to match them up I'm not the laundry basket I'm not the I'm not the dirty clothes basket I know the prophet called this the human grab bag of life but when the Holy Ghost is come Hallelujah that's a word of authority that no matter what disease that no matter what thing that has plagued your family down through your life no matter what hurts no matter when you are taken advantage of there is a Grace of all consuming power that comes down to bring healing and deliverance in your life brother there's healing In These Wings there's healing in these [Music] wings that's right now we are the sons of God that's why the prophet said one of the things he said the reason we miss so many blessings is we fail to feed on it and what he talking about feeding on in that quote he said is this daily bread that God has given us now we are the sons of God wow that's why I think this God this is listen this is why the word is coming with such a word of authority so that when things arise and listen there can be things that want to arise listen you need to stand there and recognize I am not here to display the characters of Browning I am here to display the character of Jesus Christ amen don't back down when the word comes don't back down when the test comes but stand right there and say now I'm a Son of God not I'm going to be in the Millennium but right now over this pile of dirt and dust God has allowed me and given me Grace to rain when my spirit wants to go when things want to Harbor in my life maybe you're built and Keen to handle and harbor unforgiveness and bitterness but as a Son of God as a daughter of God you recognize I am not made to be a receptacle of the enemy I am not going to stand here and be a servant to the devil I am called as a Son of God and though this hurt me though it offend me but I'm standing here I'm a Son of God right now and I'm going to conduct myself as a Son of God as a daughter of God by the strength of the Holy Ghost you're saying what are you saying remember he gives us what we have need of God will lead us right down the pathway he'll lead us right down on things in our life Lord I oh my that that's stinging that's burning you don't understand you don't know when he's leading us let's feed because as we feed on that word you receive overcoming strength so good that is so good yes sir that's why the prophet said in anointed ones at the end time if you haven't fully given yourself to feed on this word to where you can Fly Above the things of the world will you do so at this time you see this is why the Holy Ghost I want you to listen to this quote Branda pull that up with you 1965 thir I want you to look at this quote very carefully brother brand says if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit the word of God Jesus said every word shall be by the Holy Spirit and listen now if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it's the genuine Holy Spirit in you it'll know the difference what's what he's saying if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it's a genuine holy ghost in you it'll know the difference watch what he says here's what he he said the word of God is what the Holy Ghost feeds on it don't feed on enthusiasm no it don't feed on education it don't feed on Church going it don't feed on theology it feeds on the word am because enthusiasm will leave you are you with me sir if there's enthusiasm and joy and it should be not because everybody else is in Joy it's got to be because there's something going on personally with you are you hearing me yes let's just put let's just put the enemy's voice of confusion away amen well I felt the anointing and I I I did what the rest of them did don't don't get caught in somebody else and and what's going on there but you listen God's to speak personally to you and when God speaks personally in your heart if it puts a little dance in your step then you're more than welcome to dance are you hearing me but enthusiasm alone will never feed the spirit of God and the prophet said if you try to do it he'll recognize it now let me ask you the question when I look at this quote I just meditating on these things for some time I look over this quote and I look at and said God how could it ever be where a person you know would try to feed may may be the wrong thing how could it be that Lord that we could maybe come into that place and feed at the wrong thing and you know just I begin to look at it and and just my heart just meditating because a real child of God notice that the Holy Ghost is in you you can't feed on nothing like you can't feed on on enthusiasm theology education and church going just going to church won't feed you it won't feed you that that's not what I've been preaching on about coming in meal time just about coming to church you can come to church and be a sinner you can walk walk out of here and be a sinner right you can be the same kind of person walking out of here that you walk in if you choose to be but if you can say God I need help there's a call going on in my life Lord I want help Lord I want strength Lord God that's why I've said friends special meetings is not just your meeting every service is where it ought to be in prayer when we're coming here not just showing up and saying well I wonder what's on the table this morning but God I've got needs in my life Lord I want I'm here to make a Rapture yes sir you see listen this is why we want to have everything under the blood everything confessed and under the blood nothing made an excuse for well my daddy was like this my mama remember you're sons of God hold that banner and don't you ever let it down you rally around that Blood Stained Banner cuz the moment you let it down you doubt your weapon you're defeated right he's disarmed you you hold that I don't care what you feel like and even the pain of the things that is going through hold that Banner High I am a Son of God let the redeemed of the Lord say so I'm weak let the weak say I am strong amen yes sir defeat is not a word in the vocabulary of a Christian but you see the only way that things can begin to be replaced is when there's things that's not right and we're trying to eat and feed listen the only way you can feed is when everything's clean and clear before between you and God this is why God when they would come into worship I believe it's Exodus 32 or 33 when they would come in they had to wash their hands and their feet before they could worship this is why there's our goings our doings sometimes it's not even the things that maybe we've done are falling a trap to sometimes it's just the things that we just feel so muddled up and dirty from Life of things that we've heard and seen we didn't ask to hear didn't ask to see right spirit's been vexed in some way you see sometimes that's why we got to say Lord I'm here to wash by the water of the word Lord I'm a son and daughter of God I know what you have made me Lord forgive me Lord any thoughts that I've entertained that's went through wrongly Lord You Are My righteousness you're my Holiness Lord you're all that I have need of Lord if there's something that's been said or done wrong confess it what is it you see out of that labor they weren't dipping the water out there was it was made to be a running spot right there it was running water speaking that there's Living Water a Fountain that's open in the House of David how many glad that we've got a place to wash Hall and it's not even about you coming to 1530 Lake Breeze Road this just further puts you and makes you aware of it you have an access to that at all times don't you love him think about this here in closing what it means to live a separated life and feed on the word of God you know Daniel Daniel refused the king's meat he refused it that's good and he chose pulse what D what Daniel was refusing was is that which is of Babylon that's what Abraham did back in the beginning when the king of Sodom wanted to make him Rich he said I don't want nothing what you've got to offer me I don't want it I don't want it see he was tested in the presence of cassic yeah right and here Daniel said just just test US 10 days I think about it it it doesn't make sense that this would be this way but you see it wasn't just it wasn't something natural it wasn't that they had some special organic peas back there that was off some special organic Vine that didn't have any pesticides or any no no this was Dan Daniel standing for the word of God in a type yes sir to where there's things that the world would want to hand you or hand me this can make your life easier it can make it better it could do this but you recognize wait a minute I'm not here for this I'm here to serve the Lord I'll take Paul at the end of 10 days their flesh was fatter their countenances was a whole lot better you know why cuz they stood on God's word yes amen you take also a man by the name of David I want you I want you to hear me now you take a man by the name of David and David himself in this time of 1 Samuel 30 he was greatly distressed remember Philistines had come down remember they had come and into the camp and ransacked the camp and those things and taken wives and everything this is what I want you to notice here because at times whether it's a family a church or whatever job and so forth David was in a place he was greatly distressed the people spoke of stoning him right and it wasn't that they hated David it's that they were so grieved the Bible said because their sons and daughters and wives were taken now David had a choice as a leader David could have fed on what they were projecting and himself become bitter towards them right that's right you hear me now this is this is God leading Us in feeding on the word this is why sometimes as we come here how God will direct us in things he'll he'll move Upon Our Lives things to be preached within a certain way why he's directing us on what to feed on Amen right just like when Abigail came to David and David man he was he was going to take out he was going to take out that man naboth he was going to take him down and Abigail came and stood in the Gap and said I want you to know if you go and do this this is going to be on your hands when you come on the throne right she stood right there in the Gap like what happened that very thing by Abigail turned David from feeding on that which was projected to him from naboth listen friends you can feed on things that is projected at work you can even feed well someone so did this or so and so don't feed on don't feed on it don't feed on it what do what should you do turn to the word of God like David David said hey hey I don't understand this situation there the people are grieved at me but n David never took it out on the people David turned around and said bring me the ephod bring me the urum bring me the word of God bring me the absolute in this hour this is what I need and God told him said hey David go on up and recover all what was it God directed David on what to feed on you have Elijah that's so good how many of you ever felt lonely felt despair Brokenness but God repaired Elijah he called him away and Elijah went underneath a juniper tree and God sent down angels with soft hands to rub his brow and one that was a good cook to make the cakes that was needed and when he would get them made that's when he would go and wake him up hey it's ready come on it's ready Elijah was in under the pressure remember Jezebel said she would get him he was running yes but God let him eat and put him back to sleep then he woke him up again fed him again and when he fed him that second time the Bible said he ran for 40 days in the strength of that meat and the prophet would say it like this he said here we are he said we come to meeting after meeting he said if there ever was a time that the people of God need a juniper tree and need to Feast on the word of God it's right now amen amen because he said there's a battle that's coming to the church it's the coming of the Lord what we see that's upon us and he said God is going to turn his church into manhood he said we frolicked we've played long enough but God listen that's what's so powerful in that quote God is going to turn his church to manhood that's so good God himself working and directing us on the things to feed on Amen I could just just keep going and going Caleb said if we go after these enemies this will be bread for us right sometimes the feeding and the eating is where we go under the anointing to take what belongs to us take what God is leading us to take Jesus said I got meat to eat that you know not of is that right yeah so it's feeding beeding is is all acting also upon the word see when we're taking that word in there's an action that comes from our life I want you to think of this as I as I close this is where it comes to where even as we go through trials and Times of not understanding things taking place anybody ever been there you don't understand things that are taking place don't understand tests trials don't understand certain things that's right that can be one of the hardest times to muster the strength I'm talking about your human body to muster the strength but you know at that moment in that time God knows what we have need of and sometimes there are things that look Elijah couldn't rise and make the cake you know how it is when you've been sick sometimes you're just glad somebody's been there to heat up the chicken noodle soup God did for Elijah what was needed Elijah couldn't even must it maybe he couldn't get his m just set within a chapter bring it down to our day or just seemed like his mind seemed like he going to listen to a message it might have been muddled up and just with the things that was taking place but here God would come down God might send a servant sure God can speak to us while we're reading the word he can speak through us right through the message of the hour I believe that I've witnessed that many times but I've also witnessed times that where it feels like I just can't get my mind together and I've witnessed how God would take a man of God and the spirit of God would come down and just it's like it's like a breath of fresh air it's like a breath of life that just moveth back in that puts things back in perspective I'm glad God does that I'm glad God does that at Meal Time Ruth come hither come hither let's spow hands Lord Jesus Lord I I thank you Lord for each time Lord you've given to us what we have need of Lord Lord giv us the grace I know not only for myself but every Minister Lord Pastor evangelist different ones Lord down through and standing in all around the world Lord God where you would give us the Direction Lord where we need to be feeding In This Moment Lord God we stand in need of your Divine strength Lord I thank Father at different times Lord even as we as a church Lord there's different things that we can go through Lord as individuals as people Lord Sons and Daughters of God things that we can go through but Lord you know just exactly how to lead us into the right places of your word to minister to our needs Lord Lord God I've just I've stood in a maze Lord not just in the time lord where I've stood here and had others come to me and said my you don't know you don't know how that helped how that ministered whether it's been here or other places but I also know it Lord on the end when I've been sitting right there in the Pew I'm a witness of it of how Lord God you lead us in the feeding of your word help us Lord these examples that we move through Lord rather quickly here at the end but Lord I'm just trusting you that it'll just stick in our hearts Lord may we be like David in those moments Lord may we lord also be like Caleb Lord in those moments may we lord God like Elijah may you Lord I pray in these in these times Lord that we have you said you'd have a bride without spot wrink or blemish I believe that Lord I believe Lord I'm a part of and I believe I'm looking Lord at lives that are part of this end time prophecy Lord truly there's many battles that we've come through and you've brought us through by your grace no doubt battles that lay lay ahead of us Lord but father none of these things like Paul said move me we're here father in this moment everything Lord that you permit to come our way whether test or trial Lord there's times where you lead us in feeding you do each time lord we want to take that strength into our lives I pray that God that here this morning Lord May that just so resonate Lord in the hearts and lives if if there's one here Lord oh God May May the call to each one just to really give themselves to feed on the word of God Lord God not just to come to the service and en joy and anointing but to really get in and really feed on the word of God because Lord Lord as we'll feed on that word we begin to Bear the characteristics of that word that we're feeding [Music] on help us Lord I pray Lord I ask God forgive us Lord if we've tried to make it anything else if there be one here Lord that it's just been Church going in enthusiasm may they Lord God I pray move beyond that and realize I pray that Lord that if there's something in their heart or their life that's calling out I need more of God I need more of God I need a deeper walk with God Lord God there's a craving on the inside and your Prophet tells us Lord when he refers the scripture deep call to the Deep at the noise of thy wat spouts as the heart panth after the water so my soul panth after thee Oh God he said you could not have that craving for healing unless healing was for you you couldn't have that craving for more of God unless there was more of God for you Lord Jesus Lord with my very best to give my heart my all Lord God to you to these people Lord I don't want to see one of them miss it Lord I don't want to see one come up short not only Lord God I want to see them each and every one

soldiers for the grace that's been given to us Lord the sufferings like Paul wrote of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us help us [Music] Lord I thought of Lord when brother Wendell was preaching last week and he he' got to it right towards the end but of how you told the prophet I'll meet you in there Lord Jesus that's where the real dying and the molding takes place in our life Lord God I realize we can be in many different circumstances and situations but help us to be as a sheep lamb that's LED before her shearers help us Lord this is where you mold and make your children Lord Lord as we will take feet on that word like Elijah did when he was gathered there like David did in that situation like Caleb did when the opposition was against him help us Lord [Music] wonders every head is bowed every eyes [Music] closed maybe there's a heart or a life in your heart you say Lord I want more I want more of you Lord I Want More God bless you bless your hands I want more maybe maybe all you've known him is in the Forgiveness of your sins that's one wonderful but there's more of God for you Hall brother Samuel will will God give
