[41:05] not everybody hears that but aren't you
[41:09] thankful that we hear the shouts
[41:12] shouting grace grace unto a and you know
[41:17] that bringing of the capstone is not
[41:19] something way out there that's his life
[41:22] becoming preeminent in his body amen
[41:28] amen you love him you're so good to be
[41:32] back together again
[41:34] amen certainly appreciate your your
[41:36] prayers when we were gone we just had a
[41:39] I read a real good time and just glad to
[41:45] be back home there are the archives are
[41:48] on the men's meeting org so you can you
[41:52] can look those up if I believe they
[41:55] would be a blessing to you and I feel
[41:58] like I'm still trying to recoup those of
[42:02] you that's been in the men's meeting you
[42:04] know what I'm talking about from you go
[42:06] from right in I think the first sessions
[42:10] and is at 9:30 and then I don't think we
[42:13] left out of that room aside from lunch
[42:16] and of course I didn't go to dinner
[42:18] because I had to speak that night but
[42:20] and we didn't leave out there I think to
[42:22] attend or after so it's almost 12:00
[42:24] over 12 hours there in just one six
[42:27] sessions one right after another and so
[42:30] the Lord was certainly merciful to us
[42:32] and just had so many many wonderful
[42:35] things that the Lord spoke to our hearts
[42:37] and challenged our lives I can say one
[42:40] thing I was challenged was really really
[42:44] really challenged and edified by the
[42:46] word of the Lord just to see not only
[42:48] the because the timing the hour that we
[42:51] are living in but then how that God just
[42:54] comes down to deal with our lives so
[42:57] that there is nothing that
[42:59] wonders what he want desires to do that
[43:01] nothing hinders that from coming forth
[43:04] so we certainly thank God for that we
[43:07] want to go right into the word tonight
[43:08] into Genesis 28 verse 10 and we want to
[43:15] read just a few portions of scripture
[43:16] verse 10 through verse 15 we've been
[43:19] reading from there and just trusting
[43:22] that God will give us direction to
[43:24] continue to move within those parts
[43:27] again tonight amen verse 10 and Jacob
[43:32] went out from bear sheba and went toward
[43:34] haram and he lighted upon a certain
[43:36] place and tarried there all night
[43:38] because the Sun was set and he took of
[43:41] the stones of that place and put them
[43:44] for his pillows and laid down in that
[43:47] place to sleep and he dreamed and behold
[43:51] a ladder set up on the earth and the top
[43:54] of it reached to heaven and behold the
[43:56] angels of God ascending and descending
[43:59] on it and behold the Lord stood above it
[44:03] and said I am the Lord God of Abraham
[44:05] thy father and the god of Isaac the land
[44:08] whereon thou liest the V will I give it
[44:11] and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as
[44:15] the dust of the earth and thou shalt
[44:17] spread abroad to the west and to the
[44:19] east and to the north and to the south
[44:21] and indeed and in thy seed shall all the
[44:24] families of the earth be blessed and
[44:27] behold I am with thee and will keep thee
[44:29] in all places whether thou goest and
[44:32] will bring thee again into this land for
[44:35] I will not leave thee until I have done
[44:38] that which I have spoken to thee up amen
[44:42] let's just go to the Lord in a word of
[44:44] Prayer tonight Lord Jesus father we are
[44:49] standing here Lord God Lord in our post

[46:15] want to continue to speak on that
[46:19] thought God's grace to Jacob at Bethel
[46:21] and when you we zero in here on it we
[46:28] find of how that Jacob has we've been
[46:31] looking he doesn't come to this place as
[46:36] though that it holds significance for
[46:39] him but yet it is is there that God is
[46:43] going to meet Jacob and God is going to
[46:46] speak many things to Jacob even
[46:49] concerning his life this is a this is a
[46:52] time where that God is going to speak
[46:54] personally to Jacob and he's received
[47:00] counsel from his mother from his father
[47:02] but now he's he's going to have God
[47:06] speak to him right on and directly and
[47:10] God is going to we see in the scripture
[47:13] of God is promising him is committing
[47:16] himself to a fulfillment within Jacob's
[47:19] life and God is God always is commits
[47:22] himself to his
[47:24] word now when we look at it within
[47:26] Jacob's life right now Jacob if we can
[47:29] if we would type this out Jacob within
[47:31] his life he's not he's not been fully
[47:33] converted he's on his journey he has a
[47:37] desire for the birthright and go out his
[47:39] spoke to him gave him direction and now
[47:41] he meets God we're in that God makes
[47:45] known to him that he's the one that's
[47:48] been watching over his life all along
[47:50] and he will continue to watch over his
[47:53] life and bring him back into this place
[47:55] so when we're looking at this and we
[47:58] think of it in the scripture of how that
[48:00] Jacob laid down and the scripture said
[48:03] he comes into a place to where he slept
[48:05] and then he dreamed and when when he
[48:08] dreamed the scripture tells us in verse
[48:10] 12 that behold a ladder what he dreamed
[48:12] was a that of a ladder the set up on
[48:15] earth and the top of it reached to
[48:16] heaven and when you you think of this
[48:19] yeah I want you just to I want to just
[48:22] pause just for a moment in light of this
[48:24] that when we think of God's grace God's
[48:28] grace is not how that much of the world
[48:33] has interpreted God's grace to be they
[48:37] they look at God's grace as as as an
[48:41] allowance for permissiveness that God is
[48:46] somehow giving them a license and he
[48:50] understands that they can't live a
[48:51] victorious life but that's not what
[48:54] grace is all about grace is the grace of
[48:58] God is God providing the very remedy and
[49:03] what is needed that you are I cannot
[49:07] provide that's the grace of God so when
[49:11] we are looking at it we find God's grace
[49:14] if we just look at God's grace we find
[49:18] in the very beginning when this earth
[49:20] was in a condition of darkness and void
[49:23] it had not the ability for for it to
[49:27] transform the condition it was in it
[49:31] didn't have that but it needed it needed
[49:35] one greater than itself to
[49:38] upon the situation and we find that
[49:41] God's grace God seeing the need he
[49:44] speaks he speaks out his word and the
[49:47] Spirit of God begins to go in order to
[49:50] bring forth and perform the word that
[49:53] he's spoken that's the grace of God we
[49:56] see that that God's grace is there
[49:59] providing that even when the fall would
[50:03] take place in Eden that here when man
[50:06] was seeking to provide something to be
[50:08] able to stand before God's presence
[50:11] because they knew that they were not
[50:13] able to stand in his presence grace its
[50:17] South provided a voice to call him out
[50:20] of hiding
[50:21] grace provided the the blood of an
[50:25] innocent one grace provided clothing
[50:27] that they could stand in his presence
[50:29] that is the grace of God great the grace
[50:33] of God also provided when God looked
[50:35] upon the condition of the world and he's
[50:38] seen the the state that it was in yet
[50:41] there was one who by the name of Noah
[50:44] that God would make himself known to
[50:47] Noah of the impending judgment and he
[50:51] would also make known to Noah that that
[50:53] that this is the way of escape and I am
[50:56] your way of escape because it is the
[50:59] Word of God that came to Noah and that
[51:01] word itself it became the very Welling
[51:05] place the leadership the grace of God to
[51:08] Noah that Noah in that hour there was a
[51:12] way of escape provided that was God's
[51:14] grace it was God's grace that also when
[51:17] Abraham within his life he was down in
[51:20] the end and in the land of Babylon and
[51:23] to think of it even though that even in
[51:25] each of these that were speaking of the
[51:27] earth being a redeemable attribute of
[51:29] God even and how that God moves down
[51:31] upon the creation that has fallen those
[51:34] being attributes of God
[51:36] each one of these being attributes of
[51:38] God but yet being an attribute of God it
[51:41] is not something that the attributes of
[51:43] God are able to do on their own accord
[51:46] but they need one who is greater to move
[51:50] the scene and that one who moves on the
[51:53] scene then it supplies to them what they
[51:56] have need of in the hour and where
[51:58] they're at that's the grace of God so
[52:00] here God provided not only speaking to
[52:03] Abraham but then the leadership to bring
[52:06] Abraham out of the land where he was and
[52:10] then even to tell him when he arrives
[52:13] within the land that God have was
[52:16] calling him into grace was providing
[52:18] that so I think we're beginning to see a
[52:20] picture grace the grace of God does not
[52:23] leave us where it finds us that's not
[52:28] grace that brings disgrace Jude talked
[52:32] about there were men who crept in
[52:34] unawares who turned to grace the grace
[52:36] of our God and of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:39] into lasciviousness they turned it into
[52:42] uncleanness but the grace of God it
[52:45] pipes within it the the power and
[52:48] authority to bring truly a deliverance
[52:52] and to bring the person or that one into
[52:55] the condition that God is requiring so
[52:58] we could go on and on with that but I
[53:00] think that that we see the point that
[53:02] how that grace itself is not something
[53:05] that Noah merited it's not anything that
[53:08] I any any person that we have spoken of
[53:11] here that they merited it but it is
[53:14] something that is sovereignly given by
[53:17] God because only through them by the
[53:19] grace of God can the children of God
[53:21] come out and meet the need and the
[53:24] challenge of the outter if it's not
[53:26] provided then we don't know which way to
[53:28] go so with the grace of God here's the
[53:30] leadership of God here's the Spirit of
[53:33] God it's it's directing in to fulfill
[53:36] God's purpose in that hour so then we we
[53:40] see within the midst of it that there is
[53:43] a strain that remains in fallen man and
[53:47] that strain that remains is just as it
[53:49] was in the very beginning when when man
[53:53] fell it was to do something of
[53:55] themselves rather than accept what God
[53:59] had provided it shows that there's
[54:02] nothing
[54:03] that we can do that God connect that God
[54:06] will accept but what we what we desire
[54:10] is to accept what God has provided and
[54:14] when we accept but God has provided and
[54:16] we live by that then it is God himself
[54:20] through that us accepting God's grace
[54:23] then it is God coming and working in our
[54:25] life him performing what He is calling
[54:28] for and grace not only makes known the
[54:31] way grace also brings and releases what
[54:34] is needed to bring about what he's
[54:37] calling for it that's the grace of God
[54:39] so here we find that when Jacob comes
[54:42] into this place here that as we've said
[54:45] before Jacob does not see this to be a
[54:48] place of significance but yet when he
[54:52] comes into it here we find that God
[54:55] makes himself known to Jacob and really
[54:57] there's two to two words that I'd like
[55:00] you to I wouldn't want to hone in on
[55:01] here tonight and that is looking at this
[55:03] ladder and looking at the stone because
[55:07] when we see this here brother Ram tells
[55:10] us in the message of over Jireh and he's
[55:12] giving that parallels how that the
[55:14] message of grace God gave it to Abraham
[55:17] unconditionally in the second paragraph
[55:19] of Jehovah Jireh he talks about how that
[55:21] he it lasted on on up until Exodus there
[55:24] to where then they themselves begin to
[55:27] put something into it as though they had
[55:28] to do it and then in the last the last
[55:30] paragraph he says just like Nimrod he
[55:33] had to have something to do so he built
[55:35] a tower but God just showed Jacob a
[55:39] ladder grace Jacob did not merit this
[55:45] ladder he comes to a place of rest he's
[55:50] in a place of exhaustion he can go no
[55:53] further and when he's in a place where
[55:56] now he dreams and what God does is
[55:59] showed to Jacob what he himself has
[56:03] provided that this is the answer
[56:06] think of how Nimrod Nimrod and those
[56:08] under an inspiration and inspiration to
[56:11] want to get to heaven sure there was an
[56:15] inspiration but
[56:16] Otis but notice what came along with
[56:18] that inspiration that that that
[56:21] inspiration whereby that they were
[56:23] anointed to move in that they were
[56:25] making stairs they were making of that
[56:28] which would have sinned up but yet it
[56:30] was a perversion because it was man's
[56:33] doings and anytime we take anything
[56:38] outside of what God has provided it's a
[56:41] perversion God lays it down so simple
[56:46] that you and I all that we must do is
[56:49] accept it and walk in it it does it
[56:53] doesn't mean it's not about whether you
[56:54] can explain it or not it comes back to
[56:57] what it comes back to is this is God's
[57:00] Word I just just was listening here
[57:05] earlier in the week and brother I'm
[57:06] speaking in the message in those
[57:08] Redemption messages Redemption and joy
[57:10] Redemption and completeness Redemption
[57:12] and power and in the message Redemption
[57:13] and completeness brother Graham says if
[57:15] I knew had friends that they had already
[57:18] went on over there and they come on and
[57:21] would they already went on and and they
[57:23] had made it but they came back to me and
[57:25] they told me brother Branham don't go
[57:28] any further it's not true it's not
[57:30] genuine it's not real brother Graham
[57:32] said I would steal go on anyhow he's
[57:38] paralleling that with how that even he
[57:42] says if I prayed for ten thousand
[57:43] tonight hey everyone I'm dying I'd be
[57:46] standing here tomorrow night praying for
[57:48] ten thousand more
[57:49] why because it's not based upon people's
[57:52] experiences this is cops word there's a
[57:58] lot of people that can have a lot of
[58:00] experiences but there's one that is true
[58:02] and it's solid and that's the Word of
[58:04] God that's what we're anchored on them
[58:08] said I would still keep going on I'll
[58:11] tell you the only thing here listen
[58:12] friends you know what that is that's an
[58:14] experience you hear me that's an
[58:18] experience there is nothing that could
[58:20] talk you out of it and experience is an
[58:23] anchor
[58:26] and I'm talking about the depth of an
[58:29] experience to where you've met God face
[58:32] to face and your life has changed
[58:34] forever
[58:36] it becomes everything to you that's an
[58:40] experience so here when we we see this
[58:45] this ladder this excess notice of how
[58:48] that the Scripture speaks of how that
[58:51] the ladder the ladder itself in verse 12
[58:54] that it was set upon the earth and the
[58:56] top of it reached to heaven but it
[58:58] doesn't specify in the scripture where
[59:00] is the ladder set up on earth yet we
[59:02] know that ladder is going to be set up
[59:04] on earth Jacob knows that and he
[59:08] recognizes that reaches unto heaven so
[59:10] here is the access route here is the
[59:13] access the channel the opening to lift
[59:16] up out of this realm there's got to be
[59:19] something that can lift us out of here
[59:22] it was set up on the earth but it
[59:24] doesn't specify where upon the earth to
[59:27] whom upon the earth but we know that it
[59:29] says it reaches under heaven and the
[59:32] angels of God ascending and descending
[59:34] upon it and this we know verse 13 and
[59:37] the Lord stood above it they men and
[59:42] this is what the Lord said standing
[59:45] above it I am the Lord God of Abraham
[59:49] that father not Abraham that grandfather
[59:54] because I don't have grandchildren every
[59:57] one of my children are not they're not
[59:59] second born third born but every one of
[1:00:02] my children are first generation every
[1:00:05] one of my children are first born
[1:00:09] so he's declaring that I though you came
[1:00:13] through Isaac and Rebecca but I am your
[1:00:17] father so now the word is letting it be
[1:00:20] known as it standing above the ladder
[1:00:22] that I am your father they meant I have
[1:00:28] the complete oversight over your life in
[1:00:34] the message infallibility of God spoken
[1:00:36] word let me just go through this brother
[1:00:39] brems says we take
[1:00:40] Jakub he lays down God shuts him off and
[1:00:44] gives him a coma of a vision he looked
[1:00:47] up and he saw a ladder fastened up in
[1:00:49] heaven to God's throne and reached all
[1:00:51] the way to the earth and the angels
[1:00:52] ascending and descending on the ladder
[1:00:54] up and down now all through the years we
[1:00:57] find out that this was a beautiful
[1:00:59] promise here that God had promised a way
[1:01:01] of escape a ladder to climb on a sure
[1:01:04] foundation God had promised it but it
[1:01:07] was hooked in glory to the throne of God
[1:01:09] but where could he find a place on earth
[1:01:12] to hook it to now we're talking about a
[1:01:16] ladder I used to be afraid of heights
[1:01:21] and I still AM that probably seems like
[1:01:24] they don't make sense I don't like being
[1:01:27] up in high places but I will go up to
[1:01:29] high places is that Alright
[1:01:33] I really don't like climbing a ladder
[1:01:35] but I will climb on ladders but there's
[1:01:39] one thing about when I'm climbing on a
[1:01:41] ladder
[1:01:41] the first thing I'm checking is not just
[1:01:44] where it's resting but I also want to
[1:01:46] make sure the ground it's set on is
[1:01:49] solid I don't want it sitting you know
[1:01:52] when I go to climb enough to where it's
[1:01:54] already wobbly if it's wobbly down here
[1:01:57] when I get partway up it's going to even
[1:01:59] be further to me when I'm in that state
[1:02:02] further wobbly so there's got to be a
[1:02:05] firmness a surety
[1:02:08] down here amen no wonder as punkers to
[1:02:14] let every man work out his own salvation
[1:02:16] with fear and trembling is that right so
[1:02:20] it's got to know that foundation and and
[1:02:23] to know that foundation is not just a
[1:02:25] feeling not just a thought but it's a
[1:02:27] reality within our life to where that's
[1:02:29] through that reality we can look back we
[1:02:32] know we no longer lock the things we
[1:02:34] used to love but we also see the fruit
[1:02:36] of God that is moving through our life
[1:02:39] there's a foundation he tried to hook at
[1:02:44] one time upon the Jewish nation he found
[1:02:47] out that he couldn't do it he knew what
[1:02:50] he was going to do all the time because
[1:02:52] he promised to see
[1:02:53] and the seed was in Jacob then but he
[1:02:55] couldn't hook it on Jacob discipline er
[1:02:58] couldn't do it because Jacob was a sir
[1:03:02] planner but that seed that faith seed
[1:03:05] was resting there neither could hook it
[1:03:09] on Abraham little fellow setting out
[1:03:11] there backslide little shyster lying
[1:03:13] treating his wife the way he was he
[1:03:15] couldn't hook it on that he couldn't
[1:03:16] hook it on many of these other things he
[1:03:18] couldn't hook it on the temple jesus
[1:03:21] said there be a time when there won't be
[1:03:23] one stone left on another he tried it on
[1:03:25] the patriarch David and he took
[1:03:27] Bathsheba for a wife
[1:03:28] Uriah had him killed everything that he
[1:03:31] tried to hook it to it wouldn't anchor
[1:03:35] every one of those were giving glimpses
[1:03:38] in part but yet he couldn't hook the
[1:03:41] ladder in one of them what does it show
[1:03:45] it shows the weakness and the fallow
[1:03:48] ability of man it shows that this cannot
[1:03:52] be a ladder that simply hooked into
[1:03:55] flesh amen it cannot be just flesh
[1:03:59] because flesh failed but it's got to be
[1:04:03] one who's greater than that afresh and
[1:04:06] that can only be one and that's God oh
[1:04:13] my look at the grace of God in Isaiah
[1:04:16] 28:16 therefore thus saith the Lord God
[1:04:19] behold I lay in Zion for a foundation
[1:04:23] stone a tried stone a precious
[1:04:26] cornerstone a sure stone he that
[1:04:30] believeth shall not make haste this
[1:04:34] stone has got look at it look at him
[1:04:36] says I lay who laid this stone the Lord
[1:04:39] Himself laid this stone it wasn't a
[1:04:43] stone that was provided by man it wasn't
[1:04:47] a stone that was provided by the
[1:04:48] prophets but it was the stone himself
[1:04:52] that moved upon the prophets that would
[1:04:55] even speak and give even designation to
[1:04:58] that which and who he is here is I lay
[1:05:03] in Zion highly a precious stone a
[1:05:06] fried stone think of it has he walked
[1:05:08] upon this earth he was tried he was
[1:05:11] tested he was ridiculed he was exiled by
[1:05:14] the religion of the day they're right
[1:05:18] they didn't even they were not they
[1:05:20] didn't recognize him but yet now the
[1:05:22] trying of that stone is that we're an
[1:05:25] anchor that we see it in tight we see
[1:05:27] the block you see it in David where
[1:05:29] David is facing the life you see a part
[1:05:31] of that you see a characteristic that is
[1:05:34] a part of that stone but yet David it
[1:05:37] couldn't be hooked in David you see a
[1:05:39] part of it they're in Abraham and see it
[1:05:41] on down but yet it could not be hooked
[1:05:43] in them highly in Zion so look how God
[1:05:51] would place this here even in 1st Peter
[1:05:54] chapter 2 verse 4 because notice this
[1:05:57] this stone that I lay in Zion we know
[1:06:00] it's speaking not just of Israel but as
[1:06:03] a speaking Zion is speaking spiritually
[1:06:06] of the bride notice here how that he is
[1:06:09] a tried stone a precious stone a sure
[1:06:12] foundation and first Peter chapter 2
[1:06:15] verse 4 says to homecoming
[1:06:16] as unto a lively stone disallowed indeed
[1:06:19] of men but chosen of God and precious
[1:06:22] who is he is the foundation stone but
[1:06:27] notice what he's doing he's letting to
[1:06:29] be known that he's the foundation stone
[1:06:32] of which all other stones that are a
[1:06:35] plant of him are brought together and
[1:06:38] just as all of these qualities speak of
[1:06:42] him that is a tried stone a precious
[1:06:44] stone it's a sure stone that same
[1:06:47] reality speaks in the life of a believer
[1:06:52] chosen of God and precious ye also as
[1:06:56] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:06:59] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:07:02] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:07:05] by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is
[1:07:07] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[1:07:10] in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect and
[1:07:13] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:07:16] shall not be confounded
[1:07:21] confounded means shall not be ashamed
[1:07:25] let me just let me put it real clear you
[1:07:28] might be out argued you might be out
[1:07:31] debated that might be printing there
[1:07:34] might be individuals you can talk to but
[1:07:37] they could pluck questions at you and
[1:07:38] everything else and you don't have the
[1:07:40] answer right there but you're not
[1:07:42] confounded if your experience is here
[1:07:47] then you could be but when the
[1:07:49] experience is down there you cannot be
[1:07:51] confounded because this can be shaken
[1:07:54] but this right here cannot be shaken
[1:07:57] this is a real true stone even Joseph
[1:08:04] who was very close in the perfection but
[1:08:07] yet we seen in the midst of a pressure
[1:08:09] situation he was shaken hallelujah but
[1:08:15] yet notice how that in the midst of it
[1:08:17] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:08:20] precious and unto them which be
[1:08:24] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:08:25] disallowed the same has made the head of
[1:08:28] the corner let me go on here the
[1:08:31] infallibility of God spoken word brother
[1:08:33] an refers to the scriptures I just read
[1:08:35] about that stone being laid in Zion and
[1:08:37] then he moves on it says and then God
[1:08:40] being God in heaven with the ladder
[1:08:42] hooked into his own throne he hooked it
[1:08:45] also in none other but the son of man
[1:08:48] Jesus Christ the Cornerstone
[1:08:51] God don't want his ladder slipping
[1:08:54] around why you I just don't he wanted
[1:09:02] slipping around
[1:09:02] it ain't about him it's about you it's
[1:09:06] about me it's gotta be made sure the
[1:09:13] word of the Lord is tried and it is sure
[1:09:18] his reputations on the line
[1:09:21] God don't want his ladder slipping
[1:09:24] around he tried to hook it through a
[1:09:26] covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked
[1:09:28] it to a covenant with any broken but God
[1:09:30] made the Covenant unconditionally
[1:09:33] and he hooked into Christ Jesus bear
[1:09:36] it's anchored there's no slipping and
[1:09:38] sliding there's no way of getting away
[1:09:40] what is it it's hooked by God above and
[1:09:43] by the Son of God beneath and what is it
[1:09:46] it's a pathway it's a traveller's way
[1:09:49] from earth to glory hey man this is the
[1:09:55] way God said I will provide I am that
[1:10:00] way for he provided that of even the
[1:10:03] flaming sword of a chairman to keep the
[1:10:05] way back to the Tree of Life notice how
[1:10:10] he's revealing note it as he revealed
[1:10:12] himself all the way down even in this
[1:10:14] place to Jacob it's grace revelation is
[1:10:21] not merited revelation is what we pray
[1:10:26] for that's why the importance of it can
[1:10:30] never be over emphasized the Prophet as
[1:10:34] he as he as he speaks there in that
[1:10:36] particular place and I brought this - to
[1:10:39] the brethren in that meeting when he
[1:10:41] says may God by his Spirit continue to
[1:10:45] give us life-giving revelation and that
[1:10:47] word continuous means cycles that keep
[1:10:51] on unfolding with no reversals there is
[1:10:55] no reversal to divine revelation in the
[1:10:58] life of a believer for in God himself
[1:11:01] his desire is to reveal and when he
[1:11:04] reveals it's for that word to now have
[1:11:07] preeminence and when the word has
[1:11:09] preeminence there is now a part of that
[1:11:12] Kingdom being restored that three-fold
[1:11:16] purpose works over and over and over and
[1:11:18] over till it comes to the final
[1:11:21] culmination notice here is Jacob let's
[1:11:24] look down a little bit further in
[1:11:26] Genesis 28 16 Jacob awakens out of his
[1:11:29] sleep and he says surely the Lord is in
[1:11:33] this place and I knew it not hallelujah
[1:11:39] so he's aware he's aware by this dream
[1:11:43] you know this isn't something that that
[1:11:45] the
[1:11:46] scriptures would lay before us that
[1:11:48] Jacob in a manner is questioning but
[1:11:51] what has been shown and declared the
[1:11:54] Jacob he recognizes that the Lord is in
[1:11:57] this place he could have went to many
[1:12:01] other places but you know what God was
[1:12:06] going to meet him in this place there
[1:12:09] was a significance behind this place and
[1:12:13] God was going to meet him there God
[1:12:16] arranged everything like we looked at it
[1:12:18] God arranged the path wings for
[1:12:20] everything to be there just at the right
[1:12:22] time
[1:12:24] God knew Jacob was gonna be out of
[1:12:26] strength he knew Jacob was gonna need a
[1:12:29] place to rest God knew what you would
[1:12:33] need in this age got knew what you would
[1:12:35] need in this hour God knows that we
[1:12:37] would take it would take more than any
[1:12:39] other age it was going to take not just
[1:12:42] a portion but would have to be the full
[1:12:45] unfolding and dispensing of Christ
[1:12:48] Himself coming back in the church
[1:12:51] hallelujah if not there would be no
[1:12:53] rapture God knows and he is making ready
[1:12:58] he provides all those things and he was
[1:13:05] afraid and said how dreadful is this
[1:13:09] place he was afraid the presence of God
[1:13:15] you know brother Branham he says it is a
[1:13:18] sign of the insertion with what's
[1:13:20] approaching he said I'm very weary right
[1:13:22] now for what is approaching I to see the
[1:13:25] magnitude of it Bill Graham talked about
[1:13:28] when that the Friends of God comes and I
[1:13:30] I tell you you know you know how it is
[1:13:33] when the prints of God there's times how
[1:13:34] the prints of God comes you don't feel
[1:13:36] like doing nothing it just it just it's
[1:13:40] a solemn fear you just you don't even
[1:13:43] want to move oh yes like many times have
[1:13:49] it asked for the brennaman and we and I
[1:13:50] know how not only myself but others
[1:13:52] speaking here don't you feel like
[1:13:53] shopping says none other but the house
[1:13:54] of God and this is the gate
[1:13:58] notice this realization of Jacob he goes
[1:14:01] he goes right on back to sleep comes to
[1:14:04] a place now he goes right on back to
[1:14:06] sleep and Jacob rose up early in the
[1:14:09] morning and took the stone that he had
[1:14:12] put for his pillows and set it up for a
[1:14:15] pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
[1:14:20] now he doesn't receive there's no
[1:14:23] Direction nothing that we can see right
[1:14:25] now to where that there's been direction
[1:14:27] but it's something that would resume
[1:14:29] within Jacob so I already God is showing
[1:14:32] in tight that this place and it would be
[1:14:36] all the spiritual significance that
[1:14:38] there will indeed be one who indeed is
[1:14:40] the gate of heaven there will indeed one
[1:14:44] that is coming that will indeed be the
[1:14:47] very happen at the house of God the
[1:14:50] tabernacle of God's own life indeed but
[1:14:53] notice how Jacob he takes that stone he
[1:14:56] sets it up for a pillar he declares this
[1:14:59] stone that I'm resting on he's going to
[1:15:01] become established our foundation and he
[1:15:04] pours oil upon it what was it Jacob
[1:15:08] acting out in tight what God himself God
[1:15:11] provided it was not Mary that provided
[1:15:14] that body it was not anyone that
[1:15:17] provided it but God provided it this
[1:15:19] stone that Jacob picks up he didn't
[1:15:22] provide it it was there the Lamb that
[1:15:24] Abel offered he didn't provide it it was
[1:15:27] there and Jacob recognizes this tone he
[1:15:32] sets it for a pillar and he a nice it
[1:15:35] same thing that takes place at the River
[1:15:39] Jordan here comes one here comes this
[1:15:44] chief Cornerstone here he is moving in
[1:15:48] slips right down into the water
[1:15:51] everything continues on no doubt that
[1:15:55] has many were rejoicing things keep
[1:15:57] going on but for John things change that
[1:15:59] day for the life of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:03] things change that day
[1:16:06] because now it comes time for this word
[1:16:10] that is laid there from now since his
[1:16:13] birth now for this word it's been
[1:16:16] ignited or quickened and it's now time
[1:16:18] for this word to be expressed under the
[1:16:24] knighting what a knighting Redeemer
[1:16:26] anointing is that right
[1:16:29] he poured that oil on the top of it that
[1:16:32] the heavens were open and the Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit descending down in the form of a
[1:16:38] death God coming upon his stone one that
[1:16:44] was provided among many other of
[1:16:46] humanity but God provided this stone
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] jesus said in John 1:51 hereafter you
[1:16:56] shall see heaven open and the angels of
[1:16:58] God ascending and descending upon the
[1:17:00] Son of man in John 14:6 he said I am the
[1:17:03] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:17:05] unto the father but by me
[1:17:08] in the mighty Conqueror the prophets
[1:17:11] said it like this he said all that old
[1:17:12] prophet when he laid down there on the
[1:17:14] bed of stone that night and his pillar
[1:17:16] of stone he saw the angels ascending and
[1:17:18] descending the first place
[1:17:20] it was descending and ascending but this
[1:17:22] time it was God in man ascending and
[1:17:25] descending on the ladder of Jacob so now
[1:17:29] what was a ladder shown in type to Jacob
[1:17:34] that access now had become flesh you see
[1:17:40] that word that grants access must become
[1:17:43] flesh the word Christ must it must
[1:17:48] become flesh and what does it do opens
[1:17:51] up a way to you and I otherwise we're
[1:17:54] looking at the letter we're looking at
[1:17:56] the way there's no way there must be one
[1:17:59] who Leah's failed in that word to step
[1:18:01] forward and take the seals off of
[1:18:04] himself and come down to you and I it
[1:18:07] must be him that steps out of the way
[1:18:10] fales himself and that brings you and I
[1:18:12] into the veil of the word hallelujah
[1:18:16] her mother rest of the world can say
[1:18:19] you're crazy you've lost your mind
[1:18:21] but you veiled behind the word hey man
[1:18:25] because the word itself that was letter
[1:18:28] has become spirit and life and truth and
[1:18:31] it's dwelling behind your flesh
[1:18:34] why because grace provided one to step
[1:18:37] out when he broke every power fought
[1:18:44] every domain sets at the right hand of
[1:18:47] the Majesty on high far above everything
[1:18:52] Satan has fought this all down through
[1:18:56] the ages he still fights this ladder the
[1:19:03] channel notice the probably calls it the
[1:19:05] channel of the Holy Ghost in this dark
[1:19:07] world is laying open for whosoever will
[1:19:09] may come and be baptized into this great
[1:19:12] channel of his blessings and receive
[1:19:14] redemptive blessings that he died for
[1:19:18] Genesis 28 19 here Jacob he calls the
[1:19:24] name called the name of that place
[1:19:26] Bethell and the name of that city was
[1:19:29] called loose at the first but say no
[1:19:34] that's not the first time it's called
[1:19:35] Bethel mill it is the first time he
[1:19:37] names it in the scripture we read it in
[1:19:42] Genesis where it speaks of Abraham
[1:19:44] camping close on this side of Bethel but
[1:19:47] notice where did Jacob get this to call
[1:19:50] loose Bethel where did this come from
[1:19:53] God's mind he's walking in tune with God
[1:19:57] and God gives to him the name of what to
[1:20:01] call this place yet it was a place that
[1:20:05] God in the time of Abraham God
[1:20:07] recognized it as beth-el but now Jacob
[1:20:11] himself moved by inspiration said this
[1:20:14] is Beth el OMA and Jacob vowed a vow
[1:20:20] saying of God be with me will keep me in
[1:20:23] this way that
[1:20:23] go and will give me bread they eat and
[1:20:25] raiment to put on so that I come again
[1:20:27] to my father's house in peace then shall
[1:20:29] the Lord be my god this is what I want
[1:20:32] to get to in verse 22 and this stone
[1:20:34] notice he comes back to this stone he
[1:20:38] anoints this stone but now in between
[1:20:40] the time of his vow he comes back to
[1:20:42] this stone why because it's gonna have
[1:20:45] to be this stone all of these things
[1:20:47] that Jacob is vowing he ain't gonna be
[1:20:52] able of his own strength to keep it but
[1:20:56] you know what God's already told him I
[1:20:58] will not leave the until I have
[1:21:00] performed to these those things that I
[1:21:01] have said amen and this stone which I
[1:21:07] have set for a pillar shall be God's
[1:21:10] house and of all that shall give me
[1:21:13] surely I will give the tenth unto thee
[1:21:15] now you know I got to readin on this
[1:21:17] some weeks ago and brother Branham you
[1:21:21] know he picks it up and brother Branham
[1:21:23] talks about how that in the message
[1:21:25] enticing spirits and he says I like this
[1:21:28] he said Jacob pulled up a stone one time
[1:21:30] and laid his head on it and it still
[1:21:31] recognized today as the the throne of
[1:21:34] stone or the stone the the stone of
[1:21:36] stone but the great men of the earth
[1:21:38] still packed that stone around for the
[1:21:40] kings to be inaugurated over the top of
[1:21:42] this stone just a common old stone
[1:21:44] laying in the field I read a lot about
[1:21:50] those things looking on a lot of
[1:21:51] different history and a lot of things
[1:21:52] this is the point that there would be
[1:21:56] people who would take of of of the stone
[1:22:00] and it would say that this stone you
[1:22:03] know if if it is it is if it isn't it
[1:22:06] isn't but there's still a great point to
[1:22:08] be made to wear that the Prophet would
[1:22:10] pick it up that people would still
[1:22:12] regard this stone when there is a king
[1:22:14] coming in to be inaugurated and it's
[1:22:16] down through history where they'll take
[1:22:18] this stone they proclaim the stone to be
[1:22:20] the stone that Jacob slept on is the
[1:22:22] stone that Jacob anointed with and and
[1:22:25] and you know establish it as a pillar
[1:22:27] they would take that stone and they
[1:22:29] would inaugurate King's on that stone
[1:22:33] this is the point behind it though they
[1:22:36] even how the Prophet
[1:22:37] make it it was a common old stone laying
[1:22:40] out there the Bible said there wasn't
[1:22:43] any beauty that we should desire him
[1:22:46] it's been moved right in among the rest
[1:22:49] of the stone but there was something
[1:22:51] different about this one from all other
[1:22:54] stones a many would be through this
[1:22:58] stone that there would be many sons and
[1:23:00] daughters inaugurated into the kingdom
[1:23:03] of Almighty God it would be on this
[1:23:05] stone that many sons and daughters of
[1:23:08] God would be born again and will be
[1:23:10] placed into the Kingdom of Almighty God
[1:23:12] it would be of this stone that that
[1:23:15] kingly rain and that priestly origin
[1:23:17] Highland moves forth over this stone
[1:23:20] it's also called the Stone of Destiny
[1:23:25] this stone reveals your destiny because
[1:23:30] it reveals who you are where you come
[1:23:33] from
[1:23:33] I have no God of that father Abraham
[1:23:39] Google revita God just a common stone in
[1:23:44] the eyes of many no reputation he took
[1:23:47] no reputation
[1:23:48] he took the form of a servant that right
[1:23:54] this is where that he could declare when
[1:23:59] he asked them who do other stones say
[1:24:05] that either stone in some say you
[1:24:09] Jeremiah some say you're this I'm saying
[1:24:11] that who do you say I am
[1:24:13] Dodd's of Christ that precious stone
[1:24:21] payment that was the Christ the Son of
[1:24:23] the Living God and even What did he say
[1:24:25] thou art Peter
[1:24:29] the stone spoke back thou art Peter and
[1:24:34] upon this rock I will build my church
[1:24:38] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:24:41] against it it's a sure foundation they
[1:24:47] remember stone him end that life wrapped
[1:24:50] in that created blood cell but when
[1:24:53] there was a blood that loose man from
[1:24:56] the hold that the devil did he claimed
[1:24:58] he could put on and in the spirit God's
[1:25:01] a life that was wrapped in that cell
[1:25:03] that could seek out his children and
[1:25:05] could relieve them from the oppression
[1:25:08] and the bondage they were in by what
[1:25:10] moving away by the atmosphere all the
[1:25:13] things of the contaminants of their life
[1:25:16] and doing the work within them that
[1:25:18] creates a real true pillar in their
[1:25:23] anointed with the same oil is that right
[1:25:30] can I have just a few more moments he
[1:25:34] says what is it it's a pathway it's a
[1:25:38] traveler's way from earth to glory and
[1:25:40] you can't fail there's great companies
[1:25:43] of angels up and down here ascending and
[1:25:46] descending picking up the weary and the
[1:25:49] sick healing their bodies and showing
[1:25:52] visions and mighty signs and wonders
[1:25:54] can't fail it can't slip it can't slide
[1:25:58] you're safe God said so that settles it
[1:26:01] forever
[1:26:03] notice it can't slide it can't fail and
[1:26:07] what is it you're safe why because we
[1:26:10] are in that ladder God's great channel
[1:26:14] by lot by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:18] the new birth we are brought into that
[1:26:21] channel and angels are ascending and
[1:26:28] descending on the ladder
[1:26:32] angels are ascending and descending here
[1:26:36] on the Son of Man ascending and
[1:26:40] descending upon the word
[1:26:42] why to minister to you and I the
[1:26:47] minister stress to you and I listen
[1:26:49] friends the battles were fighting or not
[1:26:51] flesh and blood
[1:26:52] amen these are these are battles that
[1:26:55] have men that were fought before there
[1:26:58] was ever a human immortal upon the earth
[1:27:01] here it was between that of the angels
[1:27:05] there were angels who stood and there
[1:27:08] angels who fell remembers every language
[1:27:13] the first estate and there are those who
[1:27:15] held they men and the angels of God are
[1:27:19] here gathered around that same word the
[1:27:23] same word that Satan Lucifer rhetoric
[1:27:26] letter rebellion against they are
[1:27:28] gathered around that word and remained
[1:27:30] around that word and God himself has
[1:27:33] brought that life that word down to you
[1:27:36] and I and the angels of God the great
[1:27:38] hosts of God our impact among those who
[1:27:42] fear Him think of this the Lord Jesus
[1:27:47] himself the lamb of God dealeth the
[1:27:51] tabernacled in flesh and here he is he
[1:27:55] goes through the battles he goes through
[1:27:57] the tests and as after he comes out of
[1:27:59] the temptations angels came and
[1:28:02] ministered unto him all right Nigel
[1:28:08] their lives who got down and he got back
[1:28:11] there in the cave but the Brennan
[1:28:15] referred to that as the mind of Christ
[1:28:18] was there in Elijah but now in that mind
[1:28:21] of Christ pulled back Elijah didn't know
[1:28:23] what to do he ran brother Brown likens
[1:28:27] that down to the seventh seal and how
[1:28:29] that in our life there's things
[1:28:30] sometimes that we know what to do
[1:28:31] other times we don't know what to do but
[1:28:35] there is a place that we can run to
[1:28:38] we're tempted sometimes to go running
[1:28:40] our own little cave and there's times we
[1:28:44] have written running our own little cave
[1:28:46] we've had our own little pity parties
[1:28:48] about things come on friends but God
[1:28:51] still has angels to prepare some
[1:28:54] for you hey man the angels of God we're
[1:29:00] preparing meat and cakes on the fire for
[1:29:03] Elijah rise and eat Dean strength Elijah
[1:29:08] who loves it the angels of God are
[1:29:11] coming the word oh my it's hooked around
[1:29:15] the heart of God of heaven hooked around
[1:29:17] the Son of God down here and were
[1:29:19] brought into it through the Son of God
[1:29:21] we ascend to him oh my what you scared
[1:29:24] about I promised his hook between God
[1:29:27] and Christ we're in between them no he
[1:29:31] will give his angels charge over thee
[1:29:32] you believe that there's angels that are
[1:29:36] given charge over you I don't know about
[1:29:42] that brother Sam no well there's many
[1:29:44] places in the world but you notice that
[1:29:46] the devil himself when Satan was walking
[1:29:49] around he told God concerning Jobi says
[1:29:52] I can't touch him because you got a
[1:29:53] hedge all around him there are angels
[1:29:58] that were in charge that man those
[1:30:03] angels aren't in charge of keeping your
[1:30:05] soul the Angels didn't save your soul
[1:30:08] but the angels are sent and they're
[1:30:11] there to minister to us along the way
[1:30:15] your mind no wonder brother Graham would
[1:30:18] open the service many times God may the
[1:30:20] Angels take their post may they come and
[1:30:22] walk up and down the aisles Lord may
[1:30:25] they give strength the Lord to us as
[1:30:26] your children as we're gathered at
[1:30:28] Bethel tonight amen that's my desire I
[1:30:32] don't want to come to church and it not
[1:30:35] be Bethel hey man I want to come to
[1:30:39] church and it's Bethel the Living God is
[1:30:42] present you mean things may not happen
[1:30:46] just exactly like it did a previous
[1:30:48] service that's not what determines that
[1:30:50] but we want the presence of God where
[1:30:52] God is coming down through him by his
[1:30:55] word and we know that we have met
[1:30:57] face-to-face with the Living God one who
[1:31:00] deserves our life one who knows all
[1:31:02] about the circumstance and one who is
[1:31:04] the answer to it
[1:31:06] and all up and down the angels of God
[1:31:10] unkempt about those who fear me and all
[1:31:12] up and down when we're making this
[1:31:13] foundation climbing each day higher and
[1:31:16] higher each day brings me one round
[1:31:18] higher higher as I move up up anybody
[1:31:22] want to move up huh
[1:31:25] there's things sometimes that you feel
[1:31:27] like are afar off but you got a ladder
[1:31:31] and that ladder is the channel of the
[1:31:35] Holy Ghost hey man we're not looking at
[1:31:38] the word as though it's us performing it
[1:31:41] but lord I need more of you who is the
[1:31:44] word to come and fulfill it in me
[1:31:49] amen anything happens if I fall along
[1:31:53] the road or something happens to me
[1:31:55] there's a great host of angels standing
[1:31:57] there to pick me up sometimes when you
[1:32:04] thought like you were about ready to
[1:32:06] give up you were ready to quit you were
[1:32:09] ready to give in but you can't
[1:32:11] understand what it is that turned around
[1:32:13] to tell you first of all there's got to
[1:32:15] be a time post there but there are
[1:32:16] angels of God that come and minister to
[1:32:19] you because God just don't want to type
[1:32:21] o sitting in your soul and you're weary
[1:32:23] in your spirit your gloomy in your
[1:32:25] spirit your your-your-your gloomed in
[1:32:27] your mind but he wants to encourage you
[1:32:31] go to be a god if I follow he picks me
[1:32:34] back up think of that even how the prior
[1:32:38] to Calvary he when the Lord Jesus come
[1:32:40] out of praying about going to Calvary
[1:32:42] the angels were there and ministered
[1:32:46] unto him ministers Ian do you realize
[1:32:50] friends that these things right here is
[1:32:53] that all along the way I don't I I don't
[1:32:56] doubt this at all I know this I know
[1:32:57] this by an experience that it has been
[1:32:59] so many times that God has come on the
[1:33:02] scene when maybe that I've been down
[1:33:03] where I've been discouraged and God the
[1:33:06] angels of God have made a sweet by yes
[1:33:12] sir
[1:33:13] think of this now of how that even Paul
[1:33:16] look what Paul would say here Paul is in
[1:33:18] the midst look at him he's in the
[1:33:20] of distress and many times you find
[1:33:23] we're poles in the midst of distress
[1:33:24] they would send out Titus they would
[1:33:26] send out Timothy and after everything
[1:33:28] was going on Paul would say all the
[1:33:30] situations that are taking place but yet
[1:33:32] when they returned bringing word of how
[1:33:35] you stand in the faith that encouraged
[1:33:38] us it didn't take away the situation
[1:33:42] I hope somebody still hearing me tonight
[1:33:45] that doesn't take away the situation
[1:33:48] we're in it encourages us with strength
[1:33:51] to press on the angels coming in
[1:33:54] ministering to the Lord Jesus did not
[1:33:56] relieve the cross it gave him strength
[1:34:00] to go on
[1:34:02] amen that's why brother Adam would even
[1:34:05] say and something that which sometimes
[1:34:07] we could take so for granted but he
[1:34:09] would talk about in the message perfect
[1:34:11] faith opening in that message and he
[1:34:13] said you know there's times I get gloomy
[1:34:15] I can relate to a man like that these
[1:34:20] other times I get gloomy and Satan gets
[1:34:23] to telling me nobody loves you
[1:34:24] nobody cares about you that right now we
[1:34:30] could take that quote and stop right
[1:34:32] there and we could create a little
[1:34:33] commune or in a fellowship session of
[1:34:35] pity party but I don't believe that's
[1:34:38] why that's included in the message there
[1:34:41] is direction that's given there because
[1:34:43] the Prophet said then I come out and I
[1:34:45] look and see people who stayed around -
[1:34:47] for the second service on a Sunday night
[1:34:49] instead of driving back to Georgia he
[1:34:52] said then I'll put that right back in
[1:34:54] the devil's face and say what about that
[1:34:59] I'm putting many of cards back in his
[1:35:02] face I put many attacks back in his face
[1:35:05] I put many a email back in his face the
[1:35:10] proud the point is put it back in his
[1:35:12] face and say this is true you're lying I
[1:35:16] know you were lying
[1:35:19] what is it that which is sent to
[1:35:22] Minister strength to us along the way
[1:35:25] person said brother Samuel I don't need
[1:35:27] that you need first of all you need help
[1:35:29] over that self-righteous lion spirit all
[1:35:35] I need is Jesus I do too and I need him
[1:35:37] to show up in flesh too I need him to
[1:35:41] make himself known in his body God has
[1:35:44] made it that way that we have that we so
[1:35:48] work together as a body of believers
[1:35:51] that's why when he said when one hurts
[1:35:54] we all heard when one rejoices we all
[1:35:56] rejoice Oh can't fail there's no failing
[1:36:03] in it it don't rest upon what I do it
[1:36:06] rests upon what he did it's already
[1:36:08] finished the believer once anchored in
[1:36:11] Christ coming through the door back
[1:36:12] there put on this highway you can't get
[1:36:15] any way but straight up to God with it
[1:36:17] angels to take care of you let me just
[1:36:21] say it plain you didn't put yourself on
[1:36:23] the ladder
[1:36:24] you didn't provide the ladder and there
[1:36:26] ain't a devil out of hell can take you
[1:36:27] off the ladder because you know what
[1:36:30] that there is no desire to come off this
[1:36:33] ladder Amen you have been baptized into
[1:36:36] the body of Jesus Christ what a security
[1:36:41] it's not getting up on a ladder oh honey
[1:36:44] honey honey honey check the ladder you
[1:36:50] get the going like that and very soon
[1:36:51] it's gonna be sliding off when I'm on
[1:36:55] the ladder I don't want nobody shaking
[1:36:56] it I don't want nobody messing around
[1:37:00] with the ladder
[1:37:01] hey brother Samuel hahahahaha I don't
[1:37:05] want that happening we have fun with my
[1:37:09] feet are on the ground with yours but
[1:37:13] this ladder here is a true precious
[1:37:18] tried stone detach the trows everything
[1:37:22] will come away to try to shake us but in
[1:37:25] moving the ladder the ladder can't be
[1:37:28] shaken because that stone is firm it's
[1:37:32] fixed the ladder is firm his fits and we
[1:37:34] are on the ladder and if we start
[1:37:38] shaking a little bit there's angels
[1:37:40] ascending and descending it like the
[1:37:47] first time you know second time I flew
[1:37:48] to Ghana and I rode first-class every
[1:37:51] time I go overseas God please open a
[1:37:52] first-class I got in there in first
[1:37:55] class and man I'm telling the truth like
[1:37:57] I had my own little suite yeah they gave
[1:37:59] me a menu and I got to looking at the
[1:38:01] menu and I thought I was supposed to
[1:38:02] pick off a menu like you do at Cracker
[1:38:03] Barrell one or more no you select from
[1:38:05] every category in there sir and by the
[1:38:08] way what can we get you to drink right
[1:38:10] now what can we get for you taking my
[1:38:12] shoes from me hanging my shoe hanging my
[1:38:14] coat up you know putting my shoes in the
[1:38:16] closet here can we can we can recline
[1:38:18] your seat for you can we do there all
[1:38:21] these things you know because of the
[1:38:22] class that you're in today man and you
[1:38:25] know what there's a class that you and I
[1:38:26] are in there's a class that's already
[1:38:28] been provided it was not something that
[1:38:31] we could pay for we did not have the
[1:38:33] money to get into this class but he
[1:38:35] himself who is the firstborn class he
[1:38:39] brought us into this class and we have
[1:38:42] the angels of God that are there to
[1:38:44] minister unto you and I let Stan we
[1:38:54] can't slip we can't slide you might get
[1:39:00] weak hey man you might get weak you
[1:39:05] might as the Prophet said in a 35 their
[1:39:07] brother Brian he said our foundation
[1:39:08] stands sure foundation of God God laid
[1:39:11] enzyme the cornerstone there we are
[1:39:13] can't slip can't slide can't move then
[1:39:16] we come into the door through Christ put
[1:39:18] on here oh we may have our ups and downs
[1:39:20] along that's true sickness and trouble
[1:39:23] but remember there's a great company of
[1:39:25] angels all along the road bear thee up
[1:39:28] at any time taking you up or on up when
[1:39:31] you fall he promised it
[1:39:34] you made away
[1:39:41] God has provided by His grace the way
[1:39:48] for you and I to be able to live a
[1:39:53] victorious life an overcoming life
[1:39:58] strength that he's provided to you and
[1:40:00] I'm sometimes along the way as we look
[1:40:05] at it sure we get week
[1:40:09] we're tried and we're tested but you
[1:40:14] realize it's a statement that I heard
[1:40:17] and I thought that's a profound
[1:40:18] statement
[1:40:22] if there is something that has no
[1:40:24] resistance against it it's not faith but
[1:40:29] real faith always has opposition always
[1:40:35] that's what makes it faith if it has no
[1:40:40] opposition it's not faith but faith
[1:40:43] always has an opposition why because it
[1:40:48] allows the faith itself to declare
[1:40:50] itself
[1:40:51] God permits the test God permits the
[1:40:54] trials God's not worried about the
[1:40:56] slipping and the falling he's not
[1:40:58] worried God's see this is secure it's
[1:41:01] secure in him we are secure in him
[1:41:05] that's where we rest we rest in him God
[1:41:09] is overseeing all of this when we have
[1:41:14] been brought in to the body by the new
[1:41:18] birth that seed has been quickened you
[1:41:22] can no more die and God can die
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:25] but that's why it's important to be in
[1:41:28] that body
[1:41:29] that's why it's important Jacob could
[1:41:33] look at this time right here and Jacob
[1:41:34] could say what God spoke to
[1:41:36] but if you'll notice within this Jacob
[1:41:39] is still gonna go do what Jacob wants to
[1:41:43] do
[1:41:44] but he knows that God is real
[1:41:49] knows God's watching over his life but
[1:41:52] you see the difference is that where you
[1:41:55] and I can come into that place and the
[1:41:57] Spirit of God will bring us into that
[1:41:59] place to where it's not just us meeting
[1:42:04] God in terms of just I realize he's a
[1:42:07] lot but we recognize he's everything
[1:42:10] lord I must have you I must have you
[1:42:17] and God sweeps in and brings that
[1:42:20] transformation in your life it's a
[1:42:24] reversal that which can never be
[1:42:27] reversed what you're loving
[1:42:33] I'll tell you with all with this and -
[1:42:35] and Lord may we just give ourselves more
[1:42:38] fully - I don't want to try to find my
[1:42:43] way I don't have to find my way I want
[1:42:46] to just yield to the way that you're
[1:42:49] opening
[1:42:51] our lives are pre-planned God has
[1:42:54] everything down does that mean he's
[1:42:56] gonna do everything for us quite the
[1:42:58] contrary he won't do it for us but he
[1:43:01] will guide us he will lead us as we
[1:43:04] yield to him and as we yield then he'll
[1:43:08] bring us into those places under his
[1:43:10] leadership in his direction that he
[1:43:13] might move upon our lives according to
[1:43:15] his faith
[1:43:19] what Jacob saw
[1:43:21] what's his avenue of escape
[1:43:30] or Jesus
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:36] or how could we stand here tonight Lord
