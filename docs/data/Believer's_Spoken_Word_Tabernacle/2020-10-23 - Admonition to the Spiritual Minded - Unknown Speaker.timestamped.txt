[24:32] representation that son or daughter
[24:35] is down on the inside of us lord we

[25:45] a mute unless lord god you would say
[25:48] something through it
[25:49] lord god may you just come and speak to
[25:52] our hearts i pray
[25:54] we ask these things lord in the name of
[25:56] jesus christ
[25:58] amen amen god bless you tonight it's
[26:02] certainly good to be in the house of the
[26:04] lord
[26:05] good to be gathered with you once again
[26:08] we want to look
[26:08] into first corinthians chapter two
[26:11] uh brother brian if you'll turn these
[26:14] the floor monitors down just
[26:15] a tad just yet just a little bit
[26:22] okay
[26:28] i'm going to read these these scriptures
[26:30] here
[26:31] some things that we were looking at on
[26:34] sunday and
[26:35] some of these things with just was
[26:37] already
[26:38] looking at before that time but i want
[26:40] to read this really
[26:42] of a background for some things that
[26:45] we want to just look at here in the
[26:48] scriptures and just to try to get the
[26:50] the context of of the of the setting and
[26:54] that'll
[26:54] make a little bit more sense to you in
[26:56] just a little just a few moments
[26:58] but in first corinthians chapter 2 verse
[27:00] 9
[27:02] paul says but as it is written i hath
[27:05] not seen
[27:06] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[27:09] the heart of man the things which god
[27:11] hath prepared for them that love him but
[27:14] god
[27:15] hath revealed them unto us
[27:18] by his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[27:21] all things yea the deep things of god
[27:25] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[27:29] save the spirit of man which is in him
[27:32] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[27:36] but the spirit of god now we have
[27:39] received
[27:40] not the spirit of the world but the
[27:43] spirit which is of
[27:44] god that we might know the things
[27:48] that are freely given to us
[27:51] of god how many knows everything that
[27:54] god has given us
[27:56] you're going to have to fight to take it
[27:58] but it's worth it
[28:00] amen he equips us he strengthens us he
[28:03] encourages us
[28:05] so the spirit that we've received is not
[28:07] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[28:09] which is
[28:10] of god that we might know the things
[28:13] that are freely
[28:14] given to us it's very clear as
[28:17] if without the holy spirit the
[28:21] the things of god would just go right by
[28:24] our head but god's desire is that we
[28:26] might know
[28:28] what it is that belongs to us
[28:31] amen is sons and daughters of god so
[28:33] verse 13 which things also we speak
[28:36] not in the words which man's wisdom
[28:39] teaches but which the holy ghost
[28:42] teacheth
[28:43] comparing spiritual things with
[28:46] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[28:50] not the things
[28:51] of the spirit of god for they are
[28:54] foolishness
[28:55] unto him neither can he know them
[28:57] because they are spiritually
[28:59] discerned but he that is spiritual
[29:03] judgeth all things that we're judgeth
[29:05] means to discern
[29:07] yet he himself is judged of no man
[29:10] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[29:14] that he may instruct him but we
[29:18] have the mind of christ amen may god
[29:22] bless you bless the reading of the word
[29:23] as you're being seated
[29:24] amen i see some visitors here tonight
[29:27] god bless you i think i already heard
[29:29] that you were
[29:30] welcome is just glad to have you here
[29:32] with us amen may god
[29:34] richly bless you and trust that the word
[29:36] will be
[29:37] a blessing not unto you but to each of
[29:39] our hearts
[29:40] um i look at this
[29:44] at the the thought here
[29:47] in in where paul is writing and we begin
[29:50] to look at that a little bit on
[29:52] uh sunday and we're dealing with that of
[29:55] the spiritual mind and
[29:57] dealing with things of what it would
[29:58] mean and the difference between the
[30:00] carnal
[30:01] and the spiritual and we find as we've
[30:03] been looking there in romans 8 that
[30:05] the carnal mind is enmity against god it
[30:08] could never
[30:09] be subject to god even with all
[30:12] that a carnal mind could hear of the
[30:15] letter of the word
[30:16] and say well i'll do this and i'll do
[30:18] this but if
[30:20] it never comes to a place that the
[30:22] desire on the inside
[30:24] flees or there is a sanctifying power
[30:27] and then
[30:28] god takes the innermost seat in that
[30:30] heart
[30:31] then it's still at enmity and still at
[30:34] odds with god
[30:35] because it takes thereby a real birth
[30:39] of the holy spirit this is why jesus
[30:41] said you must be born again
[30:43] it's not an option you must be born
[30:46] again
[30:47] and to recognize that where the the
[30:50] birth itself
[30:51] the holy spirit does not come to bring a
[30:54] new birth to our flesh
[30:55] nor does he come to bring a new birth to
[30:57] our spirit we're a three-part being but
[30:59] he comes to bring
[31:01] that new birth to that soul to change
[31:04] that nature
[31:05] and that's where god takes up residency
[31:08] within our life
[31:09] and then the other parts of our life the
[31:11] spirit and the flesh
[31:13] they declare the inner work that god
[31:16] himself
[31:16] has done because it's really you really
[31:20] who you are on the inside and who you
[31:23] are on the inside
[31:24] will come out on the outside you cannot
[31:27] say
[31:27] this is who i really am and then the
[31:29] outside says something different
[31:31] who you are comes out from within
[31:34] it's just like a seed what is on
[31:36] whatever the germ is
[31:38] on the inside of that seed if it is an
[31:40] apple within this
[31:41] the rain and the sun only releases
[31:45] that germ that's already inside of that
[31:47] seed
[31:48] the sun doesn't make it an apple the
[31:50] rain doesn't make it an apple it only
[31:52] releases
[31:53] what was already in there and that's the
[31:55] same way it is when we come into
[31:57] the presence of the living god which god
[32:00] is light
[32:01] and it's god releasing what is there
[32:05] that he sowed within us he's the only
[32:07] one that can release that
[32:09] that real mystery and that reality in
[32:11] our life so
[32:12] paul is dealing with this here of the
[32:15] of even in a life and i want to just
[32:18] just to look at it in this manner as
[32:20] well
[32:21] of how that even a spiritual one that
[32:25] paul will use this term and i'm going to
[32:27] deal with this tonight a little bit
[32:28] but use the term spiritual and you see
[32:32] that even a person that uh you know can
[32:35] be
[32:35] covered over with all kinds of darkness
[32:37] but yet when they begin to hear
[32:40] coming into a service coming into a
[32:42] meeting and there's something that
[32:44] they begin to hear begin to recognize
[32:46] and say
[32:47] there's something here that i'm hearing
[32:49] and they recognize
[32:50] this is something beyond man this is
[32:52] this is something beyond just words it's
[32:55] more than just
[32:56] stories that's being told but we
[32:58] recognize that the word
[33:00] is uncovering our life and we recognize
[33:02] that that that can be
[33:04] it cannot be a man but it must be the
[33:06] word himself
[33:07] which is jesus christ so it is the holy
[33:10] ghost coming
[33:11] and now as he moves upon that there is
[33:14] that spiritual
[33:15] man begins to be stirred in the
[33:18] direction that is drawing
[33:20] that person to life because
[33:23] it takes the person of life to come and
[33:26] reveal the path of life
[33:28] so he wants that that our walk with him
[33:30] that our footsteps
[33:31] are ordered of the lord and then to see
[33:34] how paul
[33:35] comes into the place to say that the
[33:38] spirit of god that is given to us
[33:40] it comes to quicken our life through and
[33:43] by the new birth
[33:44] that we might see and we might
[33:47] understand
[33:48] and we might know what god has freely
[33:51] given to us
[33:52] you see we it comes down the whole
[33:54] chapter of the part that we read there
[33:57] as paul begins in the chapter speaking
[33:59] of himself
[34:00] a great a scholar knowing many languages
[34:04] and knowing the word but yet he said i
[34:06] am standing among you
[34:08] in fear and weakness and trembling lest
[34:11] your faith would be in the enticing
[34:13] words of man's wisdom
[34:14] but he said i want your faith to rest in
[34:17] the power
[34:18] of god and we recognize that it's
[34:21] according to the word
[34:22] so it's putting the full emphasis
[34:25] on the spirit of god the lord jesus
[34:28] christ the word
[34:30] that is in our midst and this is where
[34:32] paul is saying
[34:34] this is where our reliance i rest
[34:37] this is what we trust in we're looking
[34:39] to the spirit of god
[34:41] that he would reveal to us what we have
[34:44] need of
[34:45] because without him we will miss it
[34:48] we need him to reveal to us what we have
[34:52] need of
[34:53] and if not if we miss it it goes over
[34:55] our head
[34:56] the bible says that there are those of
[34:59] the natural man
[35:00] the natural man cannot receive the
[35:02] things of god
[35:03] it takes that which is given by god to
[35:06] receive and respond to his voice
[35:08] this is why jesus said that my sheep
[35:12] know my voice they did not become sheep
[35:14] when they heard his voice
[35:16] they were already sheep they may not
[35:18] have been acting like sheep
[35:20] but they the sheep hear the voice of the
[35:22] shepherd
[35:23] hallelujah once at a certain authority
[35:26] that was over our life
[35:27] but now here comes the voice of the
[35:30] shepherd
[35:31] calling to our life and what does it do
[35:33] it brings out
[35:34] and makes known that there's a sheep of
[35:37] god on the inside
[35:38] what is a sheep of god a sheep is
[35:41] different from a goat a goat cannot be
[35:43] led
[35:43] but a sheep can be led and this is why
[35:46] got the elect of god that on the inside
[35:49] is ordained and is called a sheep of god
[35:52] because he
[35:53] can leave his sheep and he promised he
[35:56] would lead us
[35:57] into green pastures he leads us beside
[36:00] the still waters
[36:01] we are led by the holy ghost
[36:04] it is not us when the holy ghost has
[36:06] come it is not
[36:07] us instructing god it is not us telling
[36:11] god but it is now god come on the inside
[36:14] and he's leading us amen right you
[36:17] realize
[36:18] if he just comes to the flesh and a
[36:20] person can do
[36:21] many religious things out here but
[36:23] they're not being led
[36:25] it's not pleasing it can even come to
[36:28] the spirit to where on the spirit
[36:30] they can have a love for god upon the
[36:32] spirit but yet
[36:33] that is not a place of pleasing unto the
[36:36] lord
[36:37] it has to come to a place to where
[36:40] now the mind of christ coming in by the
[36:43] new birth
[36:44] then it our lives are led by
[36:47] that realm that is unseen to the natural
[36:51] eye
[36:51] it is a privilege that we come into that
[36:54] channel
[36:55] of the mind of christ it's the same mind
[36:58] that adam
[36:58] operated by in the garden of eden it's
[37:02] the same mind
[37:03] that was there when there was not adam
[37:05] stardust or molecule
[37:07] and god in the beginning he he spoke
[37:10] and here things begin to move things
[37:13] begin to come about
[37:14] the angels were created all of those all
[37:17] of those parts even down
[37:19] from where this great clinker of ice and
[37:22] here it drops down
[37:23] and we it doesn't look like the earth at
[37:25] all but it
[37:26] yields to the voice of god and it comes
[37:29] around the sun
[37:30] and it becomes a water garden of eden
[37:32] because it obeyed the voice of god
[37:35] you see why it comes into that mind
[37:38] and when we come into the mind of christ
[37:40] it's not
[37:41] us directing god but it is god
[37:44] having supreme control and authority
[37:48] in our lives and it's not it's not a
[37:51] struggle
[37:52] but it is actually a blessing and a rest
[37:55] to recognize
[37:56] the realm and the privilege that we can
[37:58] walk in
[37:59] it doesn't mean that we all the time
[38:02] feel
[38:02] spiritual or you fear it but you
[38:05] recognize remember
[38:06] what brother branham talks about the
[38:08] anointing is oh my
[38:09] he said the anointing is not running
[38:11] here and running there
[38:12] but the anointing is supreme power in
[38:16] control
[38:16] you know who you are a situation arises
[38:20] junior gets cut
[38:21] and here you know it's such a situation
[38:24] that you could frantic about it but
[38:26] something steps up at that time and you
[38:28] might say what am i going to do but
[38:30] there's something that steps up and says
[38:31] wait
[38:32] a minute we got a promise they shall lay
[38:34] hands on the sick
[38:35] and they shall recover he's a god that
[38:38] heals that which is broken
[38:40] he mends that which is torn what is it
[38:42] it's operating
[38:44] in that mind of christ
[38:48] and we can truly say that any time uh
[38:51] because we have uh the mind of christ
[38:54] and then you have that natural mind and
[38:57] any time
[38:57] we're defeated is because we went to the
[38:59] natural
[39:01] amen but when we operate in that channel
[39:05] that we are privileged to come into
[39:07] praise and you recognize that this
[39:09] channel
[39:11] is a channel the mind of christ is a
[39:14] channel
[39:15] that we are to yield ourselves to
[39:18] it's a yielding to him and he does the
[39:20] leading
[39:22] he does the guiding he takes control
[39:26] in situations and and directs us
[39:30] through uh each one of these each
[39:33] situation
[39:34] and it's it's something that when i when
[39:36] we look at this
[39:37] it's a privilege it's a relationship
[39:40] that we can that we have with god
[39:42] uh remember when jesus here he was
[39:46] he's speaking to the disciples and they
[39:49] were called
[39:50] as servants but then he says i'm no
[39:52] longer going to call you servants i'm
[39:54] going to call you friends
[39:56] because servants do not know what the
[39:58] master is doing
[40:00] they're just simply pick this pick this
[40:02] up pick that up
[40:03] i remember when you know when when i was
[40:05] just um
[40:07] 15 or 14 or 15 to 16. worked in a
[40:10] greenhouse there you know and
[40:12] uh you know and and some of the times
[40:15] what we were doing
[40:16] in the summer uh some of the work it was
[40:19] hard work
[40:20] you know but i didn't know why am i you
[40:22] i didn't see
[40:23] why am i doing this what does why why am
[40:25] i doing this
[40:26] why am i doing that and i didn't ask you
[40:28] know the owner i didn't ask him you know
[40:30] why am i doing this i didn't see why am
[40:33] i doing this
[40:34] why am i doing that it was only go do
[40:36] this go clean out the warehouse
[40:38] go do this and go do that in other words
[40:40] what i'm saying is i didn't see any
[40:42] vision
[40:43] i didn't see nothing come together like
[40:45] a plan
[40:46] it was just like you know oh go do this
[40:48] and go do that okay i'll go do this
[40:50] and go do that but that's not what it is
[40:52] with a believer
[40:53] when he moves from servant to friends
[40:56] remember
[40:57] friends he says a servant doesn't know
[40:59] what his master's doing
[41:01] but but a my friend he is one to whom
[41:04] he will disclose what he is doing
[41:08] and to recognize that even from friends
[41:10] it moves from friends then to
[41:12] after the resurrection he did not say go
[41:15] tell my friends
[41:16] he said go tell my brethren you see the
[41:20] relationship
[41:21] progressed just like with you and your
[41:23] wife or your husband
[41:24] you know you just don't meet him and
[41:26] then run to the altar and get married if
[41:28] you did something's wrong
[41:29] you you you there is a change in
[41:32] relationship
[41:33] you become friends and you know it moves
[41:35] on to a place to where
[41:36] now as husband and wife but what is it
[41:38] it's a growing it's a changing
[41:40] in relationship and that's the goal of
[41:43] the gospel
[41:44] is to bring us into full relationship
[41:47] with
[41:48] god as sons and daughters of god so that
[41:50] we're not just walking around
[41:52] ignorantly and saying oh so-and-so is
[41:54] doing this okay so i'll do that
[41:56] so-and-so is doing this okay so i'll do
[41:58] this that is not that's not god's desire
[42:01] god's desire is that everyone has a
[42:04] personal
[42:05] revelation and they've got a personal
[42:08] connection
[42:09] as a son and daughter of god and are
[42:11] under
[42:12] the leadership of the mind of jesus
[42:14] christ
[42:17] hallelujah now
[42:20] i want you to think of this i haven't
[42:22] given him my title
[42:23] now i'm going to give him a title what
[42:24] i'm going to preach on
[42:26] i i want to speak on here tonight or at
[42:28] least begin to
[42:30] these are some things i just just was
[42:32] looking at here
[42:34] you know even before last weekend and i
[42:36] want to preach on
[42:37] and or at least kind of deal with
[42:40] spiritual
[42:41] admonition or if i could say it in
[42:44] another way to save them length back
[42:45] there
[42:46] admonition to the spiritual minded
[42:49] and i want you to watch how paul because
[42:52] you'll find
[42:53] even in the scriptures as we go through
[42:56] and we're looking at the spiritual and
[42:59] the carnal and paul is setting that
[43:01] the difference and i want you to think
[43:03] of this it has always been
[43:05] clear back from from the very
[43:09] beginning there with abel and cain you
[43:11] had carnal
[43:12] and spiritual and there was war that
[43:15] took place
[43:17] the war that occurred or the conflict
[43:19] within the church
[43:21] the conflict the war was between the
[43:23] carnal and the spiritual
[43:25] the spiritual abel received he had he
[43:28] had revelation from god
[43:30] on what god desired in that hour and all
[43:33] he did
[43:34] he submitted himself he made himself
[43:36] available
[43:37] and god revealed to him this is my
[43:40] acceptable way
[43:41] and he walked in it then you had cain
[43:43] who brought fruits
[43:44] and after cain saw god come and
[43:47] vindicate
[43:48] abel's sacrifice he rose up and he
[43:51] slew abel is that right
[43:55] why because abel cain himself
[43:58] he was of that wicked one he rose
[44:01] up he he was jealous he would not humble
[44:04] himself
[44:05] to god's provided way and here was a
[44:08] conflict
[44:09] between this carnal and the spiritual
[44:12] it was a conflict with jacob and esau
[44:16] it's the church you always have the
[44:18] spiritual and you have the kernel
[44:21] and i want you to think of this it's
[44:23] just like let me just narrow it down for
[44:25] a moment
[44:26] it's the same even in a certain way
[44:30] even in our own life as we said moments
[44:32] ago where we
[44:33] in ourselves have to be inclined to the
[44:36] spiritual
[44:37] and that takes a spiritual endowment of
[44:40] the holy ghost
[44:42] amen so i want to just speak
[44:45] just for a few moments on spiritual
[44:47] admonition because i know i won't get
[44:49] through all of this
[44:50] but this is just an admonition is just
[44:53] to
[44:54] kind of step back and an admonition is a
[44:58] warning
[44:59] an admonition is something that it draws
[45:03] a real clear attention to something
[45:06] that is pressing and i want you to think
[45:09] of this now
[45:10] where paul what we just come out of
[45:12] reading in first corinthians chapter 2
[45:15] then paul opens the very next chapter
[45:18] and he says
[45:19] i brethren could not speak unto you
[45:22] as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
[45:27] even as unto babes in christ
[45:32] now you know what it really depended on
[45:34] how they were going to take it
[45:35] right right you know when a person can't
[45:39] receive correction
[45:40] it's one sure sign they ain't got the
[45:42] holy ghost
[45:44] brother said when they're corrected and
[45:46] they can't receive it
[45:47] it shows they're not humbling themselves
[45:50] to receive that correction
[45:52] is that right because the spirit of god
[45:55] will lead and
[45:56] guide us into all truth and if he's a
[45:58] teacher then he's able to take the word
[46:00] that's coming in that we might be
[46:02] directing
[46:05] many things that we can go but to think
[46:07] how paul
[46:08] would write of this and and speak to
[46:10] them i can't
[46:11] he says i couldn't speak to you as under
[46:14] spiritual there are things that paul
[46:16] wanted to bring to them but remember
[46:18] paul
[46:19] was under the leadership of the holy
[46:21] spirit and what good would it do
[46:24] to preach things up here if they're not
[46:26] up here
[46:28] god is mindful of our needs now notice
[46:31] in verse 2
[46:32] i have fed you with milk and not
[46:35] with meat milk is necessary milk is
[46:38] necessary for newborns
[46:40] right right i mean no matter how big
[46:42] your boy or girl was that came out you
[46:44] know
[46:45] uh it doesn't matter they don't come out
[46:47] eating a t-bone steak
[46:50] they come they come out you have to give
[46:52] them milk
[46:54] right there's nutrient those things are
[46:56] already broke down
[46:58] they don't have to chew them and break
[47:00] them down in their mouth they don't have
[47:02] to rely
[47:02] on all of the digestive juices and they
[47:05] don't have to rely on that
[47:06] it's already given to them in a very
[47:08] simplified form
[47:10] and milk is the very foundation
[47:13] principles of christianity
[47:17] it's very foundation principles
[47:20] now notice i fed you with milk and not
[47:22] with me for hitherto
[47:24] you were not able to bear it neither
[47:28] yet now are you able for you are carnal
[47:32] for whereas there is among you envying
[47:35] and
[47:35] strife and divisions are you not carnal
[47:38] and walk
[47:39] as men for while one saith i am a paul
[47:43] and another i am of apollos are you not
[47:46] carnal
[47:46] right paul is paul he goes on without
[47:51] reading the rest of that portion
[47:54] where the people look look what's coming
[47:56] out of the cardinal
[47:57] look what carnal reactions are coming
[47:59] out divisions among them
[48:01] that's not spiritual the man who's
[48:04] spiritual says
[48:05] i will not let division enter into this
[48:07] church
[48:08] i will not let division enter in my home
[48:10] i will not let division come
[48:13] between me and my family that's a
[48:15] spiritual man
[48:16] because a spiritual mind can catch that
[48:19] and recognize
[48:20] even though they may have been wrong but
[48:22] they recognize if i allow this to fester
[48:25] what it will cause spiritual
[48:28] spiritual is insight it's discernment
[48:31] right envyings envyings
[48:36] this is among what he just got done
[48:39] writing about people
[48:40] who have the mind of christ right
[48:43] and there's envyings
[48:46] divisions look at this
[48:50] strife that's what's standing out
[48:53] that's what's spiritual this is what it
[48:56] produces no
[48:57] what paul is saying the behavior and
[49:00] conduct
[49:00] is the reason that i have to come with
[49:03] milk and not with meat
[49:07] this is why god comes and i thank god
[49:09] that he does come and correct us
[49:11] i thank god that he does come and
[49:13] admonish us but remember
[49:15] we don't want to continue to receive the
[49:17] milk bottle
[49:18] of don't have division don't have heart
[49:20] don't have grudge
[49:21] don't have bitterness i don't want to
[49:22] see that milk bottle of bitterness
[49:25] i don't want to see the milk bottle of
[49:26] those other things we want to grow
[49:29] into a place to where we're not walking
[49:31] around
[49:32] and being men all of a sudden a
[49:34] situation comes and we're back on milk
[49:38] amen god's desire is to feed us
[49:42] meat meat takes you
[49:45] beyond those things it gives you
[49:47] strength to do what fly above them
[49:52] but milk in itself here as it comes
[49:55] along and things that
[49:56] are basic things that are basic teaching
[49:58] and notice
[49:59] god has to remind us there are times
[50:02] where the spirit of god will have to
[50:05] come down
[50:05] and remind us because remember you don't
[50:08] go into algebra without the abcs
[50:14] i think i was in a church one time i was
[50:16] preaching uh
[50:17] services and i kind of know you know how
[50:20] the brother kind of
[50:21] the brother was always you know kind of
[50:23] and i didn't pray i didn't
[50:25] come and minister because of that but i
[50:27] thought what am i going to preach
[50:28] i don't know i never know i never go
[50:30] into any place what i'm going to preach
[50:32] i don't know sometimes god lets me know
[50:33] beforehand
[50:34] sometimes i'm just waiting and sometimes
[50:35] there's things that god are just little
[50:37] inspirations here and there i don't know
[50:40] i don't know but here
[50:41] i i just something moved on my heart and
[50:43] i just spoke on a simple little thought
[50:45] the abcs of daniel
[50:48] and i took how god led to show the
[50:51] mysteries that come
[50:52] to preserve life but it all came
[50:56] through abc's it all come through prayer
[50:59] it all come through fasting it all come
[51:01] through faith standing on the word of
[51:03] god
[51:04] and knowing that no matter what the
[51:05] circumstance god is present and he will
[51:08] answer and he will stand for his
[51:10] children
[51:11] amen now you know i know
[51:15] uh the brother is a friend friend of
[51:17] mine but i know how i really kind of
[51:18] leaned on
[51:19] mysteries and everything else like that
[51:21] i i like all the mysteries and all that
[51:23] but i like the mysteries where i can put
[51:25] them in the lunchbox
[51:27] you wish me i like it where it gets put
[51:29] in the lunch box and it goes right with
[51:31] me
[51:33] and so you know i thought lord are you
[51:35] sure you want me to preach this here
[51:36] the abc's of daniel but you know we
[51:39] ministered it
[51:40] and god gave us grace within that but
[51:42] the the thing that we're looking at
[51:44] is is seeing of how that here among
[51:48] the people they they're not recognizing
[51:51] really who it is that's working they
[51:54] they now have become locked on
[51:56] personalities
[51:57] and i'm of apollos i'm appalled and then
[52:00] you had a group in there
[52:01] that actually says i'm of christ
[52:04] in other words i don't need no ministry
[52:06] i'm not making that up that was that was
[52:08] there
[52:08] in that time they they come into a place
[52:12] where i don't need this
[52:14] i don't need that i don't need this and
[52:15] and even as history courts
[52:17] those were the most dangerous out of all
[52:19] of them
[52:21] right now think about this paul is
[52:23] pointing it out wait a minute
[52:25] apollos planted i watered god gave the
[52:28] increase
[52:28] what paul has to bring him around to see
[52:31] it's god working in your midst
[52:32] there's sometimes you need planting
[52:36] i mean you can't go and rejoice uh you
[52:39] know over pumpkin path you don't first
[52:41] plant the seed
[52:42] and when you plant the seed you might
[52:44] have in your mind a thought who am i
[52:46] this is going to be a nice pumpkin pie
[52:49] cream cheese on the bottom
[52:50] and streusel on the top of it double
[52:52] streusel man this is going to be good
[52:54] and all you're doing is putting the seed
[52:56] in the dirt nothing right there really
[52:58] to rejoice over
[53:00] is that right but then after times of
[53:03] watering
[53:04] and my service after service thursday
[53:07] sunday monday in prayer tuesday prayer
[53:10] watering
[53:11] tending pulling around weeds and
[53:13] everything and then
[53:14] finally it comes to the time of oh my
[53:17] here comes that pumpkin pie well who was
[53:20] the one working all along
[53:22] it wasn't all of a sudden the guy that
[53:23] comes and plucks the pumpkin off the
[53:25] vine that
[53:26] oh my this guy no this guy just takes
[53:29] the pumpkin he recognizes this is the
[53:31] time
[53:32] it's the same one who recognized it's a
[53:34] time to plant
[53:35] and it's good in our midst there's times
[53:37] where we need to plant
[53:38] there's times where we need to break up
[53:41] fallow ground
[53:42] that the seed find its mark there's
[53:44] times where god
[53:46] has to do that why because then he'll
[53:48] come right back around
[53:49] water that and he'll bring increase in
[53:51] our lives
[53:54] oh my you see this is what paul is
[53:58] trying to get him to recognize
[54:00] who who is in your midst
[54:04] and you see much is spoken of
[54:08] with this part even with milk even where
[54:11] the lord jesus
[54:13] he you know you find after the death
[54:16] burial and resurrection
[54:18] now you find this witness in isaiah
[54:22] that reaches forward clear to pentecost
[54:25] and it's speaking of the coming of the
[54:27] holy spirit
[54:28] and remember here in isaiah the the
[54:31] question is
[54:32] who shall i make understand doctrine
[54:36] those that are weaned from the breast
[54:41] brother brandon uses that term he says
[54:43] they're not babies anymore
[54:47] and you know babies themselves there's a
[54:49] it's a wonderful thing
[54:51] you know of a baby but a baby's got to
[54:53] grow
[54:55] it's got to mature is that right
[54:58] there's got to be a maturity underneath
[55:00] that you you really you want to maturity
[55:03] not just in the physical realm but you
[55:05] also want the maturing
[55:06] of the character on the inside
[55:10] is that right i mean you you we all have
[55:12] seen people
[55:14] that you know it's still 30 40 50
[55:17] 60 years old and if mama could she'd
[55:21] pick them up and carry them around
[55:24] is that right they never they never
[55:26] graduated from certain things
[55:30] sometimes you see when you you could see
[55:33] certain things that
[55:35] it's going on and you recognize that's a
[55:36] sign that that's immaturity
[55:38] right you see maturity has nothing to do
[55:41] with chronologically
[55:42] how old you are maturity
[55:46] deals with the character amen
[55:53] this is why jesus as he's expressing
[55:56] this to isaiah
[55:57] who shall i make understand doctrine
[56:00] those who are
[56:01] weaned from the breasts those who have a
[56:03] desire
[56:04] did not just receive the milk of
[56:06] justification
[56:07] not just the milk of saying i know him
[56:09] as my as my savior but it's something
[56:12] that goes much
[56:13] deeper than that where you know if a
[56:15] person wants to hang on to milk
[56:17] and be babied around this is things that
[56:19] brother brown says
[56:20] being babied he said well you got to
[56:22] persuade him to come to church
[56:23] you got to tell him ah come on you got
[56:25] to come to church you should be doing
[56:27] this
[56:27] it doesn't matter how long they've been
[56:29] around the church
[56:32] if they still have to be persuaded in
[56:34] those things
[56:35] it's still babies preach brother simon
[56:41] it's still these are simple simple
[56:44] truths is that right
[56:48] these are simple truths that you don't
[56:50] even need a message for
[56:52] hallelujah the bible says
[56:55] for black and white forsake not to
[56:57] assemble yourselves together
[57:00] these are simple truths these are simple
[57:02] truths that even those in denomination
[57:05] know that they read that they see that i
[57:07] know people
[57:08] that value in that these are baby basic
[57:11] truths
[57:13] but if people are struggling with basic
[57:16] baby truths
[57:17] and listen i'm not talking about a
[57:19] person who is in journey
[57:21] i'm talking about a person who has just
[57:23] come to a spot
[57:24] and they count down and they say i don't
[57:26] need that
[57:27] i you know i don't understand it i don't
[57:30] need to
[57:31] understand that god ain't looking at it
[57:33] the same way your reasoning is
[57:36] there's got to be something and there
[57:37] should be something in your heart
[57:39] and if there's not something in your
[57:41] heart that says i deny
[57:43] every excuse i want to be
[57:46] full of the holy ghost i don't want to
[57:48] walk around with a milk bottle
[57:52] amen
[57:54] oh my my mama
[57:58] some of you thinking man i don't know if
[57:59] i should have come tonight or not
[58:01] no no no no we're we're in for a great
[58:03] blessing from the lord
[58:05] because you see to spiritual you know to
[58:08] others it'll never do anything
[58:10] in the world it'll just go right on by
[58:13] there's times i've watched things where
[58:14] people can be corrected and they're
[58:16] corrected and they go right back into
[58:18] the same rut
[58:19] corrected back into the same rut correct
[58:21] it back into the same rut
[58:23] there's got to come a time that you
[58:25] recognize that the pastor or anybody
[58:28] else
[58:28] nobody even god does not delight in
[58:31] correcting
[58:33] but it's to recognize what he's doing
[58:35] and saying god
[58:36] let my life be corrected let it come
[58:39] into a place
[58:40] to where my life reflects that
[58:42] [Music]
[58:44] you see to be to be spiritual is to be
[58:48] walking
[58:48] in unity and harmony with the holy
[58:51] spirit in the word
[58:52] lining up with the word and with one
[58:55] another by his spirit
[58:58] and so notice in hebrews 5 10 another
[59:01] place that paul
[59:02] let me just pick this up here and paul
[59:05] is
[59:05] is here in these first five chapters of
[59:08] hebrews
[59:10] he is laying out of who god is
[59:14] god's condescension he makes known it
[59:18] was god
[59:19] who was speaking in the prophets it was
[59:22] god
[59:22] in christ and he's tying the old
[59:25] he's tying what is the old and the new
[59:29] he is declaring that jehovah of behold
[59:32] is
[59:32] jesus of the new he's declaring that the
[59:35] law
[59:36] itself was fulfilled in christ and he
[59:39] is our righteousness and the first five
[59:42] chapters think of it
[59:43] think of the numerology the first five
[59:45] chapters it is grace to
[59:47] you and i that lets us know who he is
[59:53] and now in the closing of this chapter
[59:56] of chapter five he now is expressing
[59:59] called of god
[1:00:00] and high priest after the order of
[1:00:02] melchizedek he's speaking
[1:00:04] of the lord jesus yes
[1:00:07] remember melchizedek melchizedek himself
[1:00:11] came and he appeared unto abraham who
[1:00:13] was it priest of the most high god
[1:00:16] the bible says he ever liveth having
[1:00:18] neither father nor mother
[1:00:19] who was that that was god god unfolding
[1:00:23] himself
[1:00:24] that he would become our high priest
[1:00:29] oh my amen glory be to god
[1:00:32] but here now when god would become
[1:00:35] flesh that same god would would take
[1:00:39] upon
[1:00:40] a flesh body and who was that there
[1:00:43] within that body that was the same one
[1:00:46] who met abraham melchizedek the same one
[1:00:50] who came to abraham's tent door in
[1:00:52] genesis 18.
[1:00:54] it's the same one who met gideon it's
[1:00:56] the same one
[1:00:57] who came there time and time again met
[1:00:59] there the hebrew children
[1:01:01] in the fiery furnace he's the same one
[1:01:03] that daniel saw
[1:01:04] he's the same one that ezekiel saw he is
[1:01:07] the theme of the whole bible
[1:01:11] he led his children down through the
[1:01:14] scriptures
[1:01:14] in the word we were not just people just
[1:01:17] walking around
[1:01:19] you know like well these are good moral
[1:01:20] people christianity is more than good
[1:01:22] morals
[1:01:23] it'll produce that but it's more than
[1:01:25] that christianity don't limit
[1:01:28] the gospel to good morality there's a
[1:01:31] lot of good people who
[1:01:32] have a lot of good morals but they're
[1:01:34] not christians and they're going to have
[1:01:36] christians that have a lot of good
[1:01:37] morals but they're not holy ghost filled
[1:01:40] christians are you with me
[1:01:43] it's to be spirit filled to catch what
[1:01:46] he is doing
[1:01:47] in this hour is to know what is taking
[1:01:50] place
[1:01:51] in this season when daniel
[1:01:54] the bible says he was there in daniel 9
[1:01:57] god had prophesied 70 years and then i
[1:02:00] will visit you
[1:02:01] in babylon and israel would come back
[1:02:03] into the homeland
[1:02:04] the bible says in daniel 9 that how
[1:02:07] daniel he begin to understand
[1:02:10] according to the books that now was the
[1:02:12] time
[1:02:13] daniel was a prophet but remember he
[1:02:15] could not
[1:02:16] pry into that it was the time and the
[1:02:19] time
[1:02:20] and the season the inspiration came for
[1:02:23] those
[1:02:23] who could be inspired to see what was
[1:02:26] already written
[1:02:28] he was reading what god had spoke
[1:02:30] through jeremiah
[1:02:33] see what god comes to do in this day is
[1:02:36] what he has already
[1:02:37] spoken through his prophets
[1:02:41] that's why when a person wants to know
[1:02:43] where are we at in this day
[1:02:45] there is a clear direction because the
[1:02:47] bible is a road map
[1:02:49] it's a blueprint and it's also an
[1:02:51] unfolding there is a beginning
[1:02:52] there is an end there is there is a
[1:02:54] beginning of redemption
[1:02:56] there is an ending of finalizing up and
[1:02:58] all of that is god's great drama
[1:03:01] that's unfolded and how would we know it
[1:03:03] except the holy ghost
[1:03:05] would come and reveal to us and say this
[1:03:07] is where you're at
[1:03:09] you haven't tried to go to a mall or
[1:03:11] somewhere and you say oh i wonder where
[1:03:13] i wonder where that dillards is at i
[1:03:15] wonder where that jc pennies is at i
[1:03:17] wonder where this is at we'll go ahead
[1:03:18] and walk around all you want
[1:03:23] man if you were in some of the malls i
[1:03:24] was in in manila
[1:03:26] i ain't never seen a mall like that
[1:03:28] beautiful big i've never seen malls like
[1:03:30] that here
[1:03:32] and you walk around and say i'm gonna
[1:03:34] find the store
[1:03:35] how about going to a map because when
[1:03:38] you go to a map there's a dot that says
[1:03:41] this is where you're at you can look at
[1:03:42] your surroundings
[1:03:44] you're able to look okay now looking at
[1:03:47] the map okay i see
[1:03:48] this store right here is on the right
[1:03:50] this is where i'm at that's towards so
[1:03:51] so that i have to go straight and up and
[1:03:54] make the first turn on the left you see
[1:03:56] what the map does
[1:03:57] when it is made known to you where you
[1:04:00] are
[1:04:00] then what can be unfolded to you is the
[1:04:03] destination
[1:04:05] and this is why it takes the holy ghost
[1:04:07] to reveal
[1:04:08] where you came from where you are
[1:04:12] and where you are going that is the work
[1:04:15] of the holy ghost
[1:04:20] it produces stability in the life
[1:04:26] in other words we're not just flowing
[1:04:27] around like a church and
[1:04:30] well you know brother so-and-so is doing
[1:04:32] this so i'll do that or
[1:04:33] sister so-and-so's doing this so i do
[1:04:35] that no no
[1:04:36] you're to be in tune with the same
[1:04:38] trumpet they are
[1:04:40] we are assembled by the trumpets the
[1:04:43] trumpets let us
[1:04:44] know who we are they tell us our
[1:04:48] genealogy
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] you're out of the tribe of judah they
[1:04:53] let us know
[1:04:54] who you are
[1:05:00] called of god and high priest after the
[1:05:02] order of melchizedek verse 11
[1:05:04] of whom we have many things to say
[1:05:08] hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull
[1:05:11] of hearing slow slow of hearing
[1:05:19] for when the time notice he's announcing
[1:05:22] to them
[1:05:23] this is the time you ought to be
[1:05:26] teachers
[1:05:26] you have need that one teach you again
[1:05:30] which be the first principles of the
[1:05:32] oracles of god
[1:05:35] my you you think
[1:05:39] how paul let me just read on here and
[1:05:41] our become notice
[1:05:43] are become such as have need of milk
[1:05:46] and not of strong meat
[1:05:51] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:05:53] unskillful
[1:05:55] in the word of righteousness in other
[1:05:56] words they lack experience
[1:05:58] for he is a babe
[1:06:02] but strong meat belonging to them that
[1:06:04] are
[1:06:05] of full age it is talking of perfection
[1:06:09] completion even those who by reason of
[1:06:12] use
[1:06:12] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:06:16] both good and evil right so everything
[1:06:20] if we
[1:06:20] can look at in this manner paul by the
[1:06:23] spirit of god
[1:06:24] notice i want you to catch this leading
[1:06:27] of the holy spirit
[1:06:28] paul is not just standing there and
[1:06:30] saying well here i am
[1:06:31] you know i'm among the hebrew church and
[1:06:33] my i'm just gonna let i'm gonna let the
[1:06:35] revelation fly
[1:06:38] there's there ha listen you can't
[1:06:40] approach the word casual let me just let
[1:06:42] me back up a moment
[1:06:44] a person cannot receive the holy ghost
[1:06:47] without a surrender
[1:06:49] amen you can't do it the holy ghost can
[1:06:51] come upon a person
[1:06:53] and then they experience they experience
[1:06:56] they have an experience of it but if
[1:06:57] they
[1:06:58] not really surrendered and they're not
[1:07:01] really truly repented
[1:07:03] and desired to die to the world
[1:07:06] then they can receive an experience upon
[1:07:09] them
[1:07:09] but they don't receive a feeling of the
[1:07:12] holy ghost
[1:07:14] are you with me because when the when
[1:07:16] the real
[1:07:17] feeling of the holy ghost comes it's a
[1:07:19] new it's a new birth
[1:07:21] it brings about a change within that
[1:07:23] life all things
[1:07:24] are passed away behold all things have
[1:07:27] become
[1:07:28] new it's not you trying to put on whoa
[1:07:31] but wool comes out of you it's not you
[1:07:34] trying to
[1:07:35] manufacture the fruits of the spirit
[1:07:37] it's the spirit of god
[1:07:38] inside of you leading you it's him that
[1:07:41] has control
[1:07:42] of you it's the mind of christ operating
[1:07:44] in your life
[1:07:48] you see paul is expressing here
[1:07:51] there's got to be things that
[1:07:55] qualify for the word to be revealed
[1:07:58] right now this is true this is to all of
[1:08:01] us
[1:08:02] but i i even speak very expressly melon
[1:08:05] to young people
[1:08:06] but even for those that have sat around
[1:08:08] maybe sat around in this church
[1:08:10] for years and everything it just it's a
[1:08:13] casual approach
[1:08:14] a casual approach to god well i come to
[1:08:18] believer spoken word tabernacle well you
[1:08:20] know i believe the message
[1:08:22] well i know that god sent a prophet and
[1:08:24] everything is just casual
[1:08:27] there's no there's no function in their
[1:08:30] life
[1:08:31] they stay in the same place that they've
[1:08:33] always been
[1:08:35] preach brother samuel they stay in the
[1:08:39] same
[1:08:39] the same place and never move and a
[1:08:42] matter of fact
[1:08:42] the real never moving it gets worse
[1:08:46] it gets worse because it starts creeping
[1:08:49] in like
[1:08:49] everything's okay everything's all right
[1:08:52] maybe they can quote a few things or
[1:08:54] say a few things and maybe they do a few
[1:08:57] good deeds
[1:08:57] but the reality is is that the truth be
[1:09:00] known
[1:09:01] they know they're not where they ought
[1:09:02] to be
[1:09:04] the gospel is not something real
[1:09:07] christianity
[1:09:08] is not what you have to pretend it's
[1:09:11] not a pretending or an impersonation
[1:09:14] it is a genuine birth on the inside
[1:09:18] where god's life comes in and god
[1:09:21] changes you
[1:09:23] amen that's why i say that for everyone
[1:09:26] even those that are listening and no
[1:09:27] doubt some that aren't that need to be
[1:09:29] listening
[1:09:31] they need to be born again of the holy
[1:09:33] ghost
[1:09:37] you say why i get tired of milk bottles
[1:09:43] it's like papa speaking tonight pastor's
[1:09:46] like a father
[1:09:49] sometimes the milk bottles that have to
[1:09:51] be given out of when we need to forgive
[1:09:53] so and so and
[1:09:54] we need to do this right here these are
[1:09:56] things that as brother adam takes us
[1:09:58] there
[1:09:58] in rising of the sun he said we need to
[1:10:00] be beyond these things where you
[1:10:02] put the caffeine or the coffee and the
[1:10:04] sugar and you let the little baby
[1:10:08] you've got to get some sugar he said we
[1:10:09] got to get beyond that we need to be
[1:10:11] he said we're living in a time we need
[1:10:13] to be burly
[1:10:15] men and women he said to where when
[1:10:17] something comes our way
[1:10:18] it don't hurt our feelings but it is
[1:10:20] only an opportunity
[1:10:22] for love to come forth amen
[1:10:26] say how many jesus you see this is where
[1:10:30] the spiritual will catch that
[1:10:33] a colonel will never reflect in their
[1:10:36] life
[1:10:37] spiritual catches the reflection of the
[1:10:39] word
[1:10:40] carnal carnal is deflection
[1:10:45] spiritual catches the reflection they
[1:10:47] reflect in their life
[1:10:49] when you leave out of a service you
[1:10:50] continue reflecting
[1:10:52] cardinal deflects it hope somebody got
[1:10:55] that
[1:10:56] help somebody got that you the guy
[1:10:59] you the woman you're the one i mean you
[1:11:02] know
[1:11:03] god could call your name out right
[1:11:06] that's what they said
[1:11:07] don't be bringing her you know a
[1:11:08] pitchfork and pitching in here
[1:11:10] pitching attack bring a rank and rake it
[1:11:12] all home
[1:11:14] oh jesus let's sweet jesus back again
[1:11:19] notice he told him that he paul's desire
[1:11:22] is
[1:11:23] i want to feed you strong meat
[1:11:26] but instead now you come into a place
[1:11:30] that you're having to use milk this is
[1:11:33] why
[1:11:33] paul admonished the very following
[1:11:36] chapter
[1:11:36] he admonishes the people let
[1:11:40] us therefore laying aside the principles
[1:11:42] of the doctrines of christ
[1:11:45] we repented we've been baptized
[1:11:48] sanctified by the blood yes
[1:11:51] let's go on to perfection what is
[1:11:54] perfection
[1:11:55] let's get into the holy ghost let's get
[1:11:57] into the promised land
[1:11:59] let's get into christ let's get into the
[1:12:01] place where the spiritual
[1:12:03] blessings lie into the place of adoption
[1:12:06] into the place where what is really on
[1:12:09] the inside of us
[1:12:10] is made manifest you see israel
[1:12:13] while walking in the wilderness they
[1:12:16] were waiting on the manna to fall
[1:12:20] but as soon as they came across the
[1:12:21] jordan
[1:12:23] their diet changed it went from manna
[1:12:27] to the old corn they went from manna
[1:12:31] to the mature life what was the old corn
[1:12:35] it was that which had been buried died
[1:12:38] and raised again and come into full
[1:12:40] maturity
[1:12:41] they came into that and partaking of
[1:12:43] that word
[1:12:44] this is where we've come into this is
[1:12:46] where every son and daughter of god
[1:12:48] when you come into that across the
[1:12:50] jordan you are a partaker
[1:12:51] of that old corn that resurrection power
[1:12:56] you're feeding on that word
[1:13:00] it's life to you i
[1:13:14] in the message spiritual food in due
[1:13:16] season
[1:13:18] brother brahm says i want you to get
[1:13:21] built up now
[1:13:23] in the holy oracles of god in the faith
[1:13:28] the faith of this hour
[1:13:32] the faith it's going to take more faith
[1:13:35] than
[1:13:35] ever was in any age for this has to be
[1:13:39] rapturing faith be taken up
[1:13:41] right this is the burden
[1:13:47] to be built up in that faith strong meat
[1:13:51] belonging to them that are full age
[1:13:53] right
[1:13:56] you know the spirit of god would stand
[1:13:58] and many times where the prophet was
[1:14:00] saying
[1:14:01] he said we ought to be further advanced
[1:14:05] than we are and i'm sure that
[1:14:09] let me just say it like this every one
[1:14:12] of us
[1:14:12] and as a spiritual minded believer it's
[1:14:15] not just something that we join in
[1:14:17] as a casual course and say yeah we ought
[1:14:20] to be further up the road
[1:14:21] but to a believer it's something about
[1:14:24] it your life you're
[1:14:26] being evaluated you reflect
[1:14:29] in your walk with god the desire that
[1:14:32] you have
[1:14:33] every day is am i pleasing to my lord
[1:14:39] these are things that are being
[1:14:40] evaluated in your life
[1:14:43] daily it's not a casual approach
[1:14:48] to serving god but it's something you're
[1:14:51] very intentional
[1:14:53] he is your life
[1:14:56] it's not just something that's of going
[1:14:58] to church but he's your life
[1:15:01] you see god's desires will be calling
[1:15:03] out to the to this
[1:15:04] hebrew church the same way when brother
[1:15:05] branham would stand there and he says
[1:15:07] god is supplying he wants to supply that
[1:15:10] strong meat
[1:15:11] and i believe that god has been
[1:15:13] supplying strongly
[1:15:14] but you know there are times where you
[1:15:16] got to come back you see even in the
[1:15:17] prophet's ministry
[1:15:18] brother branham would come back
[1:15:19] sometimes and brother branham would come
[1:15:21] in
[1:15:22] and he would minister certain things in
[1:15:23] the church he would be preaching things
[1:15:26] and
[1:15:26] here he is he's out and he's getting
[1:15:27] ready to come back for the holy ghost
[1:15:29] series
[1:15:29] and he says i've got a burden to go back
[1:15:31] there because there's many in the
[1:15:32] tabernacle that are good fine people
[1:15:34] but they need to be born again you see
[1:15:37] the burden the burden of the spirit of
[1:15:39] god
[1:15:40] which comes down to what is the need for
[1:15:42] the hour
[1:15:43] and god has to operate and move within
[1:15:46] all those channels and listen
[1:15:47] the word the word as we're preaching on
[1:15:50] sunday
[1:15:50] the word if a person can just let go the
[1:15:53] word
[1:15:54] will take us it'll build faith to walk
[1:15:57] with god
[1:16:01] but these parts that we're reading about
[1:16:03] here these are where people just said
[1:16:07] why do i have to do that this is good
[1:16:09] enough
[1:16:11] it's just church life church life
[1:16:15] it's just their lives are in and out up
[1:16:18] and down
[1:16:20] let me just tell you something an up and
[1:16:23] down and in and out life
[1:16:24] you need to be born again say it
[1:16:27] frankly you have not been born again
[1:16:31] in and out up and down and all over the
[1:16:34] place and
[1:16:35] floating over here floating over there
[1:16:37] that's a life that's never been grounded
[1:16:39] in jesus christ
[1:16:41] for once that life is grounded in jesus
[1:16:43] christ they've found their mate
[1:16:45] you see they're in tune with an unseen
[1:16:47] world they're following him
[1:16:52] and it's saying that we don't experience
[1:16:54] times where we maybe in our spirit
[1:16:56] get a little down but you understand
[1:16:58] what i'm talking about
[1:16:59] where you get sometimes where people all
[1:17:01] of a sudden they come back to church and
[1:17:02] you say
[1:17:03] should we put you on the visitor list or
[1:17:05] are you part of the regulars
[1:17:07] preach brother samuel i know these are
[1:17:09] milk truths
[1:17:14] yes
[1:17:16] there's some other milk truth but let's
[1:17:17] let's move on here
[1:17:20] you see the things sometimes we're
[1:17:22] looking for all of this
[1:17:23] remember it's little foxes that spoil
[1:17:26] the vine
[1:17:28] brother brown would even identify a
[1:17:30] simple little fox such as setting down
[1:17:33] to scarf down your meal and not asking
[1:17:35] god for blessing
[1:17:38] simplicity the bible says let everything
[1:17:40] be received with thanksgiving in prayer
[1:17:44] simple little things that we say oh
[1:17:46] that's not that deep that's christian
[1:17:48] life
[1:17:50] the bible says whosoever added to the
[1:17:53] word or take of the way
[1:17:54] his pot will be taken out of the word of
[1:17:56] the book of life
[1:17:59] sometimes that adding and taking has
[1:18:01] nothing to do with people ripping out
[1:18:02] scripture
[1:18:03] it has simply down to where they
[1:18:05] emphasize some and de-emphasize others
[1:18:07] that is also taking and adding to the
[1:18:09] word of god
[1:18:11] you don't add it you don't emphasize
[1:18:13] here and de-emphasize there
[1:18:15] it's all the word of god the bible says
[1:18:17] all scripture
[1:18:19] is given by inspiration of god
[1:18:30] i said jesus let's put away the gerber
[1:18:32] milk bottles
[1:18:36] amen in all that you have seen and heard
[1:18:39] let me think about it wouldn't it look
[1:18:41] funny if you seen a guy come in here
[1:18:43] i mean maybe a guy like even shane and
[1:18:46] shane walked around in here and
[1:18:48] him and lily got married and he had this
[1:18:50] great big secret
[1:18:51] and the big secret was he still took a
[1:18:54] bottle
[1:18:57] oh boy lily said why
[1:19:00] didn't his dad or mama or the pastor say
[1:19:02] something here
[1:19:04] lily be saying man there is some
[1:19:06] problems here
[1:19:09] this guy wants a bottle you know why
[1:19:12] you would look at look at his size you
[1:19:15] look at his age
[1:19:16] you say hey this is something that
[1:19:18] should have passed away
[1:19:20] a long time ago and you're still
[1:19:23] carrying a bottle
[1:19:25] right right you see this is why the
[1:19:28] spirit of god
[1:19:29] deals with our life no it's not god
[1:19:31] condemning
[1:19:32] it's not god saying aha you're a you're
[1:19:34] a bottle sucker
[1:19:36] you drink milk that's not what god's
[1:19:38] doing
[1:19:40] god is letting us know you're not to
[1:19:42] dwell on the bottle
[1:19:44] it's necessary for milk when you're a
[1:19:46] newborn but the desire is gone
[1:19:48] take me on i want to eat that meat that
[1:19:51] belongs
[1:19:52] to me
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:57] oh my oh glory
[1:20:01] in all that you have seen notice about
[1:20:03] the ram says in all that you have seen
[1:20:05] heard
[1:20:05] the word that you have heard preached
[1:20:08] the signs and wonders that you've seen
[1:20:11] done
[1:20:11] we want you to accumulate
[1:20:15] all that together in your heart and
[1:20:17] consider it
[1:20:19] whether that be of god or not
[1:20:24] there's a lot of things you can
[1:20:25] accumulate right
[1:20:29] sometimes people have accumulated hurts
[1:20:31] for years
[1:20:32] they've accumulated offenses they've
[1:20:35] accumulated this and accumulated that
[1:20:38] but you see what god's desire is take
[1:20:40] everything
[1:20:42] that you've heard all of the miracles
[1:20:45] that you've seen
[1:20:46] and accumulate that in your heart
[1:20:49] take it in so you see what is it it's
[1:20:52] feeding
[1:20:53] brother brown says the reason you're
[1:20:55] still on milk is we're not feeding
[1:20:57] enough
[1:20:59] so to feed is to is to yield
[1:21:03] and to take in that word to really give
[1:21:06] ourselves to that word
[1:21:08] to really consecrate ourselves to the
[1:21:10] word of god amen
[1:21:11] it's not just something we do
[1:21:12] haphazardly neither is it gonna be
[1:21:14] something where you're sitting right in
[1:21:16] front of maybe a tape recorder or you've
[1:21:17] got your phone right there and you're
[1:21:19] watching all the words go down through
[1:21:20] there
[1:21:21] it isn't even that whatsoever at all
[1:21:23] it's where you
[1:21:24] are open and available to god
[1:21:27] and you're giving yourself to the word
[1:21:31] feeding on the word because if you don't
[1:21:35] feed
[1:21:35] you don't grow
[1:21:39] that's a very simple truth but if you
[1:21:42] don't feed you don't grow
[1:21:46] challenges and situations and things
[1:21:48] come in your life
[1:21:50] the enemy's business is to try to break
[1:21:53] and disrupt your feeding
[1:21:57] his desire is to try to interrupt that
[1:22:01] because you know we all have things in
[1:22:03] life
[1:22:04] okay you you've got to live there's
[1:22:07] things you have you have to live there's
[1:22:09] things that you have to do
[1:22:10] but even within everything that we do
[1:22:12] sometimes seasons of our life are more
[1:22:14] busy than other seasons
[1:22:15] because there's things sometimes that
[1:22:17] happen in seasons we didn't ask for
[1:22:23] that's true right sometimes you have
[1:22:24] seasons in your life you're
[1:22:26] going through things you didn't ask for
[1:22:27] all those things to come about maybe
[1:22:29] it's something in the home maybe it's
[1:22:30] something with family maybe what's up
[1:22:31] all these things that's going on in that
[1:22:33] time and your normal times and
[1:22:35] everything else
[1:22:36] seems so condensed
[1:22:39] seems like what everything's thrown out
[1:22:41] of whack what should i do
[1:22:42] say god you knew this was going to come
[1:22:47] whatever it might be maybe it's
[1:22:48] something you have to tend to or do but
[1:22:50] say god
[1:22:52] let my let the peace of god rule
[1:22:56] let me just guide me through this let me
[1:22:58] know lord
[1:22:59] just speak to my heart lord even in the
[1:23:02] times that
[1:23:02] i may not have the time in this season
[1:23:05] of quantity
[1:23:06] but god i want quality amen
[1:23:10] i want quality with you lord i want to
[1:23:12] dedicate
[1:23:13] myself and my heart my life to you
[1:23:17] let me finish this quote here it's like
[1:23:20] elijah of old said if god
[1:23:22] be god then serve him amen
[1:23:26] and if jesus is the center of all things
[1:23:28] to the christian
[1:23:29] then i think we ought to let loose of
[1:23:31] everything else
[1:23:33] and cleave to him remember he is the
[1:23:36] center he's the north star
[1:23:38] he's the ultimate he's the absolute
[1:23:42] there's only one thing that can point to
[1:23:43] the north star that's your compass that
[1:23:45] you're selling with
[1:23:46] and the compass that i'm trying trying
[1:23:48] you to sell with
[1:23:49] is is the word trying to get you to sell
[1:23:51] with is the word
[1:23:53] and the word always points to him
[1:23:58] see in the days of elijah the people
[1:24:00] were between two opinions
[1:24:03] that of baal that of god right
[1:24:09] a person can try to live between two
[1:24:10] desires
[1:24:12] right but now
[1:24:16] what do we look for we look for the word
[1:24:19] from god
[1:24:20] to come and to deliver us
[1:24:24] from two opinions yes
[1:24:27] just like jesus said no man can serve
[1:24:29] two masters
[1:24:30] you see the word what what did what did
[1:24:32] elijah operate by
[1:24:34] the word that come from god baal
[1:24:37] all they did no fire came
[1:24:40] and elijah said pour water on it this is
[1:24:43] not a kindled fire of man
[1:24:46] pour water on it there was no fire there
[1:24:49] matter of fact everything seemed
[1:24:51] impossible
[1:24:54] that might be like your life tonight you
[1:24:56] might it might seem impossible to you
[1:24:57] but not to god
[1:24:59] amen that's right the same god that sent
[1:25:01] the fire on that altar is the same god
[1:25:03] that can come
[1:25:04] upon the altar of your heart the same
[1:25:07] god who brought the fire there
[1:25:08] is the same god that can come to your
[1:25:11] altar come to your life
[1:25:13] and to where you're no longer divided
[1:25:15] between two opinions
[1:25:17] to where your life becomes an expression
[1:25:20] of not an opinion
[1:25:21] but i know that i know that i know that
[1:25:26] i know
[1:25:27] the lord he is god then what happens
[1:25:31] from there
[1:25:31] your life revolves around him
[1:25:35] everything the decisions what happens as
[1:25:37] a family
[1:25:38] what happens in your life even decisions
[1:25:40] that come your way
[1:25:42] when it comes in in the natural realm
[1:25:45] everything gets passed
[1:25:46] through the north star what is the north
[1:25:48] star about
[1:25:49] think about those who were when when
[1:25:52] when when uh it were in slavery
[1:25:54] and the underground railroad i love
[1:25:55] reading on that you recognize a lot of
[1:25:58] places around here oberlin into sandusky
[1:26:00] and other places
[1:26:02] and what did they have to follow there's
[1:26:03] certain markers by nature
[1:26:05] they would they would find that moss on
[1:26:07] the north side of the tree
[1:26:08] they would also find that that north
[1:26:10] star because that north star
[1:26:12] never moves it holds its position
[1:26:16] amen is that right and jesus christ is
[1:26:19] the same
[1:26:20] yesterday today and forever
[1:26:23] he said i'm god and i change not
[1:26:26] man have tried to change position and it
[1:26:28] should have considered the church
[1:26:30] growing towards him and moving into him
[1:26:32] the church is going a different
[1:26:34] direction
[1:26:34] but you see god has sent eyes to holy
[1:26:37] spirit
[1:26:38] that we might see that north star what
[1:26:41] does it do
[1:26:42] it reveals that the north star is not
[1:26:44] somewhere
[1:26:45] way out there but it's the same god who
[1:26:47] comes on the scene like he did with
[1:26:49] elisha there a day at dolphin and gahesa
[1:26:52] said oh my goodness
[1:26:53] look at all this situation but eliza
[1:26:55] said god open this boy's eyes
[1:26:57] that he can see that there's more with
[1:26:59] us than there is with them
[1:27:01] what was it open his eyes to that other
[1:27:04] realm
[1:27:05] that's more real than this round amen
[1:27:08] amen it affected him
[1:27:12] it changed and that north star then
[1:27:15] everything in our life
[1:27:17] it revolves around him the decisions
[1:27:20] in life it revolves around him he is our
[1:27:24] anchor
[1:27:25] our absolute you know what an absolute
[1:27:29] is
[1:27:29] you know this guy in the stand his son's
[1:27:32] up there you know up to bat
[1:27:33] and this guy you know he's looking at
[1:27:35] every one of them
[1:27:37] if his son doesn't swing in it's a ball
[1:27:41] right i mean he can see even though he's
[1:27:43] not behind the blade it's a ball
[1:27:44] i mean just
[1:27:47] next one comes he don't swing
[1:27:51] ball but what he says
[1:27:54] ain't showing up on the scoreboard
[1:27:57] instead what showed up
[1:27:59] was two dots next to strike
[1:28:02] why his voice is not the voice
[1:28:07] of the absolute hallelujah but the
[1:28:10] umpire who is standing there
[1:28:12] behind the plate is the one who's making
[1:28:15] the call
[1:28:17] it doesn't matter how disturbed this guy
[1:28:19] gets in the stand
[1:28:20] it's the guy behind the plate who has
[1:28:23] the authority
[1:28:24] and there's no higher and greater
[1:28:26] authority than the word of god
[1:28:29] amen as jesus christ the holy spirit
[1:28:32] gets into the word and he makes the call
[1:28:35] man can make this call
[1:28:37] the reasoning a man can make this call
[1:28:39] but when jesus christ he makes the call
[1:28:42] his sheep hear his voice
[1:28:46] and it's an absolute
[1:28:49] let's just stop here tonight spiritual
[1:28:52] admonition
[1:28:54] spiritual admonition oh god
[1:28:58] within our hearts and lives this is my
[1:29:00] prayer for all of us
[1:29:02] as as even as an assembly we look at
[1:29:05] things
[1:29:06] and we see many times it's little things
[1:29:10] that we leave undone you want to see we
[1:29:13] want to see more of god
[1:29:15] we want to see more of god within our
[1:29:17] lives
[1:29:19] it's not just it runs much deeper
[1:29:22] than just a good service for a good
[1:29:24] meeting
[1:29:25] it's where that word's gonna be taken
[1:29:27] into our life and it's gonna be a change
[1:29:31] to where we're not just coming back and
[1:29:33] forth to church and there's no prayer
[1:29:35] life
[1:29:36] there's no walking with god i realize
[1:29:39] this is spiritual ammunition
[1:29:42] but the spiritual will catch it the
[1:29:45] cardinal will say
[1:29:47] sometimes the cardinal will not say well
[1:29:48] that's not necessary but the cardinal
[1:29:50] just kind of looks at it like
[1:29:52] well i don't understand this or i don't
[1:29:54] but the spiritual says
[1:29:55] god you're the revealer
[1:29:58] yes amen you're the one who opens eyes
[1:30:02] you're the one who reveals these things
[1:30:05] you're the one who
[1:30:06] puts things in motion lord
[1:30:09] i'm one of your children praise the lord
[1:30:11] i'm one of your sheep
[1:30:12] amen you say listen how does that come
[1:30:15] more and more the more you feed
[1:30:16] on the word and in prayer
[1:30:21] what's happening you're being built up
[1:30:23] because there's
[1:30:24] vitamins in this word amen
[1:30:30] let's pray
[1:30:34] lord jesus
[1:30:38] father i pray lord
[1:30:42] with these things lord that you just
[1:30:44] laid on my heart
[1:30:46] lord just to just to reflect upon
[1:30:51] lord just these things and how paul
[1:30:55] would
[1:30:56] would speak to to that corinthian church
[1:30:59] he would let him know
[1:31:01] the real thing that he's letting him
[1:31:03] know and there even in hebrews 5
[1:31:06] is don't live beneath your privilege
[1:31:10] but live live in the privileges
[1:31:14] that is afforded to us as sons and
[1:31:16] daughters of god
[1:31:18] father i pray tonight
[1:31:21] dear god
[1:31:24] that may lord in every life
[1:31:28] and every heart
[1:31:31] i pray that god it would be
[1:31:34] that of where lord it's strong meat
[1:31:38] i pray that god that you'll continue to
[1:31:41] as
[1:31:41] hearts would really take in of the word
[1:31:45] i realized lord that
[1:31:49] even though lord i i wouldn't want it to
[1:31:50] be this way but i realized lord that
[1:31:52] sometimes it could just go right on
[1:31:54] through
[1:31:55] but i know that god there is the
[1:31:57] spiritual
[1:31:58] is going they're going to catch it and
[1:32:00] lord always heed to it
[1:32:04] because i think of that
[1:32:07] man the one time who was coming up had
[1:32:10] to go up this
[1:32:12] mountain road and he asked
[1:32:15] he asked this this drivers he needed to
[1:32:18] take a driver to take him up there
[1:32:20] and he came up to this driver and that
[1:32:22] driver said oh no he said i can
[1:32:23] i can get real close to the edge i can
[1:32:26] get within so much of a fraction
[1:32:29] he walked around he found another guy
[1:32:32] this other guy he says
[1:32:34] can you take me up there that guy says
[1:32:37] well i can he said but i
[1:32:39] i just stay awful close to the mountain
[1:32:41] he said i hug that mountain real tight
[1:32:44] i don't try to get close to the edge the
[1:32:46] driver said you're the guy i want to
[1:32:47] drive me up
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] lord we don't want to see how close we
[1:32:53] can live to the edge
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:56] we want to live close to you
[1:33:01] lord i believe the desire
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] of the hearts and lives maybe there's
[1:33:07] some listening some here
[1:33:08] maybe lord there's questions that has
[1:33:11] arose in their heart
[1:33:13] and now clarity has come that god
[1:33:18] they need to move to a place to where
[1:33:19] their diet changes
[1:33:22] moving into a place lord from the
[1:33:24] wilderness into the promised land
[1:33:27] need to move lord from milk to strong
[1:33:29] meat they need
[1:33:30] to move on with you not being content
[1:33:34] with just drinking milk but god having a
[1:33:38] desire
[1:33:40] now lord i can't give them that desire
[1:33:43] nobody can
[1:33:44] but lord if that desire is in them it's
[1:33:46] because you put it in them
[1:33:48] and lord you're the one god is able
[1:33:52] to bring them into that place to where
[1:33:55] their desire
[1:33:56] becomes fully expressed
[1:34:01] lord i asked god that you would grant
[1:34:03] that
[1:34:04] i pray for hearts lord and lives that
[1:34:08] because we understand that lord the milk
[1:34:10] itself oh it's necessary
[1:34:12] every newborn babe needs milk
[1:34:17] it needs milk before
[1:34:21] other things will come
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:24] the lord we believe this is the time and
[1:34:27] i believe that god that is sons and
[1:34:29] daughters of god
[1:34:31] they can recognize in taking you at your
[1:34:35] word
[1:34:35] they can take in lord as your prophet
[1:34:37] would say it this way he said they can
[1:34:39] take in that
[1:34:40] sincere milk he said like that milk and
[1:34:42] honey from canaan
[1:34:43] and let it stimulate their faith in the
[1:34:46] promise
[1:34:47] i pray tonight god that you would grant
[1:34:50] that to their heart
[1:34:52] as they earnestly are looking to you
[1:34:56] i pray lord
[1:34:59] i pray god that as you would move
[1:35:02] continue to move among us lord
[1:35:06] lord we don't want to be found
[1:35:11] resting and leaning upon milk but we
[1:35:14] want to be
[1:35:15] lord feeding upon that strong meat
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:19] taking in oh god the nutrients of that
[1:35:23] word
[1:35:24] we see a paul address that there was
[1:35:26] conduct there was
[1:35:28] character there was divisions envious
[1:35:30] strife
[1:35:31] these things that were allowed oh god
[1:35:34] let us
[1:35:34] operate i can't ask for everybody else
[1:35:37] but i asked for right here
[1:35:39] within this local assembly let us be
[1:35:41] spiritual
[1:35:43] let us recognize the devil at every one
[1:35:46] of his tricks lord
[1:35:49] help us so god and as we recognize the
[1:35:51] devil
[1:35:52] and every one of his tricks let us
[1:35:54] recognize that god inside
[1:35:56] of us is greater granted lord god i pray
[1:36:00] may we operate in that spiritual realm
[1:36:05] and lord if there if the carnal if we
[1:36:08] come over under that side
[1:36:10] may we be inclined and in tune and be
[1:36:12] spiritual lord to say
[1:36:14] forgive me may we lord repent where
[1:36:17] repentance is needed lord

[1:36:22] restores fellowship

[1:36:27] desire lord
[1:36:28] with our lives as a body that you might

[1:41:55] this is
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:05] oh let it be
[1:42:16] you know paul paul would write even in
[1:42:19] the admonition he would come and say
[1:42:22] when i was a child i thought as a child
[1:42:26] but when i became a man then i put away
[1:42:30] childish things
[1:42:32] and you know isn't it true
[1:42:35] in your life there's things sometimes
[1:42:42] it's funny when it comes to a time that
[1:42:44] you don't have to tell
[1:42:46] you know this particular child
[1:42:50] to ignore what this child is saying
[1:42:54] it just happens you remember in your own
[1:42:56] you know
[1:42:57] in your own life you had people who were
[1:42:59] younger than you but you were the
[1:43:01] no no and was always digging at him
[1:43:03] digging at him digging at him
[1:43:05] and then eventually you come to a spot
[1:43:06] that you recognize
[1:43:09] what happened you grew up a little bit
[1:43:13] and and that which you used to no
[1:43:16] like you had to prove your point you had
[1:43:19] to
[1:43:20] show your i'm older than you
[1:43:23] when he gets to a spot you grow out of
[1:43:25] that
[1:43:26] and then when you grow out of it then
[1:43:28] you can look back on and say oh man
[1:43:30] mom and dad had to hear me mom and dad
[1:43:32] had to hear me
[1:43:34] what what did i look like you looked
[1:43:36] like a kid that was growing
[1:43:39] but eventually you put away that
[1:43:42] what put that away and i know some some
[1:43:44] people don't ever put that away but
[1:43:46] that's another service but you
[1:43:49] understand how it normally should be
[1:43:51] put away what happens you look back and
[1:43:53] you think
[1:43:55] how childish that was how insignificant
[1:43:58] that was
[1:43:59] what causes it growth maturity
[1:44:03] how does growth and maturity come
[1:44:06] love is expressed to you you receive
[1:44:09] love
[1:44:11] you grow you grow and you develop
[1:44:14] this is what god's love is to you and i
[1:44:17] god's love to us is not just always
[1:44:18] telling us how good we are
[1:44:20] but it can tell us areas we need to
[1:44:21] improve on hey you need to pick it up
[1:44:23] here
[1:44:24] this and we grow and then eventually we
[1:44:27] come back to a place and say
[1:44:29] my goodness and then i was hanging on to
[1:44:31] that
[1:44:33] see you don't you don't look you don't
[1:44:34] look at it the same way anymore
[1:44:37] you put away childish things i say i
[1:44:40] thank god for his grace
[1:44:41] that he deals with our life to lay aside
[1:44:44] childish things you say oh brother
[1:44:47] samuel praise god i've laid aside all
[1:44:49] tried childish things no you haven't
[1:44:50] that's one right there
[1:44:53] you're still laying them aside you're
[1:44:56] still laying them at a sign
[1:44:57] as god brings it to our attention but we
[1:45:00] want to keep growing
[1:45:04] like an example i use a brother shane we
[1:45:05] don't want to we don't want to be
