power though [Music] is is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] how many know that by experience amen those precious times when we're going through it they don't seem like precious times but you know those are the times that where our character is being molded and being shaped you know we come here and we receive instruction from the word receive life we receive encouragement but you know this doesn't mold us it's the yielding to the word that we're receiving remember john said it was sweet and my mouth was honey but when it it got down to practical outworking living out oils it was bitter but i'm grateful to god to know that there is by experience there is power in the word of god all we have to do is is eat it become one with it and say be it unto me lord the word has within it the power to transform our lives and our outlook and every situation is the same god tonight we're witnesses of that let's just approach him in a word of prayer before we look into the word tonight heavenly father what a privilege it is lord to be gathered here once again tonight how thankful we are lord just to be able to come and enter into your presence father to press beyond all the toils of the day and of the life to know that lord jesus it's in your presence where lord we receive such strength renewing refreshing even lord where we find how that we are looking at things when we come into your presence lord it's a testimony that ways that we never would have thought and lord of approaching maybe dealing with the situation or answering whatever it is we know that as your prophet told us lord and i believe that not only this apply for the new birth but i believe for every aspect of our life he said it was less than five minutes in your presence where moses was before that burning bush and he learned more than all the 40 years that he had before lord jesus our learning itself there's certain things that can serve within that then you give us the ability to learn but there's absolutely no way that our learning can give us strength through the trials of life our own learning our understanding can never ever meet the challenge but just a moment in your presence we're just asking tonight that lord as we are are gathered lord in the precious name of the lord jesus christ that lord right now through the building we just pray that god that that same pillar of fire with lord as licks or laying within hearts just to so move to unite our hearts into that purpose that lord let me just move beyond every barrier thought or doubt or unbelief whatever it is let me just i want to move into your presence tonight lord for you're the answer to my need you're the answer to what i have need of lord i need you tonight lord so father we're just looking to you that you just speak to every heart help me to step aside lord and get out of the way and be be no more than just a microphone lord that you use that you can just speak lord the holy spirit would just take control and you know the needs of your children and that's what we're here for lord is god just lord step aside and the lord that the needs would be met lord that your children would be encouraged lord and strengthened lord and lifted up in you lord i pray we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's look in the word here in matthew chapter 5 thank you musicians amen i want to say if you haven't have a chance here within the next day or a few days if you look over the calendar that was sent out with just the events it's coming up i think i believe the sisters have a brunch here this coming saturday and brother alexander magoulis will be here on sunday lord willing i ask you just to keep me in prayer i'll be flying out to washington dc to be with brother mike walls and the saints there god will just keep his hand not only upon us but god will just make our way in our journey prosperous amen the whole objective is we just just want to be a blessing amen god knows what he's doing amen so we just ask you to be in prayer also on the calendar will be some important announcements with some different services and things we have the meetings coming up with brother wayne lawson on the second weekend of november i believe it's the 13th and 14th and there's uh details that are mentioned there as well some other events so just take a look at that calendar and i have to say that because i still get people that ask me and say oh there was a youth meeting oh there was a oh and so just encouraging if you don't have email or you don't have someone maybe you know a relative or somebody can can print it out for you or let you know but if you get it just if you have to put it on your mirror put it on your on your refrigerator because lord knows we visit that place enough so amen let's just let's do that just so you can be aware and planning on things and praying about it amen matthew chapter 5 verse 9 let's just read one verse of scripture and we'll let you have your seats tonight blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god i'd just like to speak to you tonight on the peacemakers may god bless the word and reading of it as you're being seated tonight i just think as we've been looking at the thought of of the peace of god you know sometimes there's different avenues that we we approach and we look at in the word of god and you know you never know exactly the avenue of where things are going to take you but it all is every every avenue it all ties right back into the lord jesus christ and how that every scripture itself comes together it all it all weaves together for the same picture sometimes there's ways that how god will bring out in his word because the word itself is not just something of a picture that's just a two-dimensional it's three-dimensional it's a place that we can walk into remember when god would tell paul and paul would pray for the saints of god that we might know the depth the height and the breath remember when the man's eyes was healed in the bible and he said i see men as trees walking so god's word is meant to have a it's a perception and sometimes it's it's sometimes how god will take us and it's just our perspective and just having us look at things sometimes from a different angle and we all can testify tonight that that's one of the great blessings sometimes is when we actually can come to a place of looking at something maybe from a different angle looking at the same thing but god will have us look at it maybe from a different angle and that's what we've been looking at here is god's just been leading us through those different parts on the love of god and when we look at this scripture here the lord jesus here in the beatitudes and he would give this particular admonition that blessed our the peacemakers and we would know that just by that word alone the peacemaker it's one who would make peace and we know that within ourselves that you know there's a lot of things that you know you're a lot of times we remember as kids growing up you know and if there's little skirmishes you have between cousins or sisters or brothers and probably none of y'all had that but you know how it is mom and everybody else or dad or different ones try to facilitate things and get it together to where there's peace and you know tell so and so you're sorry and you know and you know how this is kids i remember teaching elementary school and you'd see that sorry you know it just and you you could say well that was really heartfelt and but you know you really wasn't something you know you're just trying to teach and direct them in the right way because um it's the right thing with peace and peace is how we were meant to live upon this earth because there's one thing that came to disturb peace and that actually brought the disturbance and that was sin unbelief is is the greatest hindrance to peace it's the greatest hindrance to peace itself being facilitated or put forth in our own life and the only way that you and i could fulfill this scripture here blessed are the peacemakers is if first of all there has been the peace of god that has come to our lives to where we are no longer at war with god you know a person could say i love god but they can still be at war with god because the bible says in romans chapter 8 that it says that the carnal mind is enmity to god and yet the carnal mind can look and say i love god i scribe to do this i'm going to do this and god said to do this and i want to do this and and that's all well and good but you realize that's even the grace of god that can even accompany a person by way of a new heart and a new spirit that actually then causes you then to agree with the word because the holy ghost can never come without there being agreeance to the word and you and i listen you and i could never bring ourselves to that place to where we come to a place of death and surrender that the new birth can come into effect in our life without the holy spirit working in our life to bring us to repentance and then through that new heart and new spirit where we begin to look at the word and agree with the word you know you can't get anywhere without agreement so the holy spirit remember he's the very peace of god because the peace itself is not just an attribute of god it's who he is because when we looked at that last week when it speaks of melchizedek it says he was king of righteousness and peace so as paul would write the god of peace so it's not just an attribute that's who he is he is he is peace itself as paul would write he is our peace so when we look at this it it reversed before we and i could ever be a peacemaker or one who loves peace or who seeks to make peace then we in ourselves are ones that must be occupied with the peace of god now let me just go out here just for a moment making peace does not mean compromise you see think of how the lord jesus uh let's just go here think how the lord jesus when he said in his word think not that i have come to bring peace but i've come to bring a sword that would seem contradictory to this statement when he would say blessed are the peacemakers but to understand he's not come to make peace with sin because sin is what has taken peace but he's come to deal with the real root of the issue the war the struggle on the inside where then a person is no longer striving to be pleasing to god but they have received the peace of god in their life and they are at peace with god and the war has ceased they are serving god now not out of letter but out of the spirit who gave the letter and gives the letter lie so it must be the peace of god in the life in order to be a peacemaker because it's not us going around as i said like between two kids and everything else we understand that peace itself this right here only comes by the word of god it doesn't come any other way let me just go on to say this the only way that the word of god comes into effect is not by our oversight of the word but by us coming into the word and when we come under the authority of the word then the authority of the word flows through our lives so to be a peacemaker there's so much that within this part and the scripture as if god will help us tonight as we see it's not so much of us taking a situation and moving over it as much as it is us ensuring and operating with our lives under the governance of almighty god because uh let's just go on here it just more just keeps on unfolding as i'm standing here and i want to just look here at the let me look read from the amplified bible if you don't mind and it speaks the same verse and it said blessed here's who's blessed those who enjoy invaluable happiness spiritual prosperous with life joy and satisfaction in god's favor and salvation let me just pause spiritual prophecy uh prosper prosperity spiritual prosperity is where the virtues of jesus christ are flowing through our lives how many know that amen because peter said if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should not be unfruitful and to realize that the flow of those virtues they come out even as we're working and moving in times that would be adverse to us is that right oh my blessed blessed now let's go to the last part of here so and satisfaction in god's favor and salvation regardless of their outward conditions are the makers and maintainers of peace those are two parts makers and maintainers you and i are called to this blessed are the makers and maintainers of peace for they shall be called the sons of god incredible jesus never spoke here in the beatitudes blessed are they who speak in tongues blessed are they who pray for the sick although all those parts are very are very important but remember as we've been looking at paul said i can have all of those things and without charity [Music] so you have we have a choice in this life here jesus is saying that when when you are known as a peace maker one who makes peace remember by the word that only comes by the word our authority as sons and daughters of god only comes by the word is that right so it must come through and by the word so to be that a maker and maintainer of peace then we are recognized as sons of god this may not seem it may not seem too glamorous to us but remember that part about not seeming too glamorous is a result of the fall the things many times that we look for and say my if this could just take place whoa wouldn't that be awesome and god looks at us and says that's so minuscule oh god if i could just walk on the water adam did that right adam did that before you see the things that you and i look at we look at so glorious and forget that what it is that manifests in these times here we are we were trapped in a fallen nature and god's grace has come to us to bring a rescue to that seed within us that then equipping it with the dynamic power in order to live a godly life that when situations around us are not matching the enoch condition our souls but yet we've been brought back into authority as sons and daughters of god to master those circumstances not the circumstances master us how many can say yes lord that's the truth you see you have to agree with the word let me just say this you have in order to the situation and circumstance that you might be facing whether it's illness in your body no matter what it is you must first agree with the word that the word is true thy word is true o lord and when you will go to agreeing with the word don't forget that liar who's on your shoulder just test him to the side and agree with the word you'll find it will bring strength into your life for the word to come to pass of what god is addressing and the need in the situation we're called as sons and daughters of god let me tell you something you know we're living we're in a moment in a time where you're either going to control or you're going to be controlled it's either one or other things right now things that uh just as a son and daughter of god when god made made man in the beginning in genesis 1 26 27 28 he made man to be a god upon the earth he was under god and he was given as the bible says the a charge and a commission to multiply to replenish to subdue and to have dominion over the fish over the fowl the heirs and so forth now remember this this godship over the earth as a son of god was was with that purpose to think of how that it was there was no evil there was perfect love there was a perfect understanding yes what was the control that what was the authority that was given was to be operated or lived by the word you know brother brown would dramatize it in in it was not in a manner for that authority to be uh you know fish don't swim here fish swim there no it wasn't meant to go around and telling things what to do it was meant with the purpose when god said he took that man that he created and then in genesis 2 he now takes that man that's in his image and places him in a flesh body are you with me and he puts him in the garden to keep it and dress it incredible keeping and dressing speaks of the presence of an enemy and there was no enemy known or present at that time yet satan and lucifer was working but you see god is entrusting his son with that understanding he places him in a garden to dress it and keep it that's where you and i have been placed you see for you and i we bypass come down here and that seed of god that attributes laying on the inside and now the holy spirit comes by way of the new birth to raise up that man horse or woman on the inside and we become a new creature in christ jesus and so it's not us exercising dominion but first it is god exercising dominion in our own life and we submit to that so then it's not our dominion it's god's dominion operating in the channel of a son or daughter of god and there's an authority that's given there because without god you take you take the holy spirit away from our lives we're no more than just like any other person oh sure you know people can be anointed and everything else but i'm talking about a life that where there is a mastery of circumstances not circumstances mastering us and we've all let me just put this disclaimer we've all been there where situations they're mastering us and yet our life is under the control of the master understand what i'm saying by mastering we're fretting we're worried we're fearful we're concerned and whatever and listen we can put away the angels wings because none of us are angels we've all been there i can't preach on that tonight but to understand as sons and daughters of god that these things come around but don't you let the devil lie to you and say well you wouldn't be dealing with this if you weren't a daughter of god or a son you put that liar on notice that your soul has been sealed by the holy ghost but you might deal with things in your spirit your mind your flesh even weaknesses in our body there's times when you know what my body might ache my soul's not aching [Music] my soul don't need motrin sometimes my hip needs motrin but my soul has never needed a tylenol or an aleve or a motrin are you hearing me now my body sometimes might need a shot or an antibiotic or one but my soul needs none of that because i've already received the toxin of the holy ghost and i'm at peace with god and you know what that does that causes me to seek after that peace so that it will permeate in every area of my life because i know as a son of god that that is what's given to me is for peace in this life so the son of god a daughter of god and here we come back into that place made in the very image of god and god places us here and to see of how that in galatians 5 22 let me just move to there paul would write paul's dealing with let me just give just a little bit of a background paul's dealing with where men have come into the church they're in galatia and they've wanted to try to take the people back to the keeping of feasts and rituals and as though that that is what is what stabilizes them and paul has to take you know when you read the book of galatians and he has to take it and remove it that it's not your righteousness because if it's your righteousness my righteousness we're in trouble because if we're still living on our righteousness then we have we are rejecting the righteousness of god that is by faith in christ jesus is that right so it's not the keeping of those things suppose speaking of paul was let me just say this paul was a man as the first church agent messenger you look how paul would minister in hebrews paul would would tell this in philippians in colossians thessalonica galatians look throughout all the scriptures and watch how the holy spirit will deal with we're going to look at some tonight it will deal with that of a rest among a believer in a believer's life the rest of the holy ghost that rest that were to enter in why because solomon was a type remember when solomon was was was ordained by god to build that temple and david was told by god your son shall be called a man of rest which it was a type of the coming of the holy ghost after the lord jesus would give his life now the holy spirit is the rest of god and in the life of the believer he is that man of rest that brings us into rest ruth could never be brought into rest unless there was a man of rest that could bring her into rest is that right so here look how paul's paul under the leadership of the holy spirit is placing the rest and because there were those who wanted to trouble the people and paul is going straight back to the word to deal with where the troubling is coming from and he says it like this the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law that's wonderful in it there's no law against being meek temperance know what meekness is it's giving place where brother branham talked about how the man walking down the sidewalk and here he was just walking and i can't remember who was with a dwight moody or one of them and the man just walking on down get out of my way white moody just stepped off and he said remember the man said get out of my way you fool or whatever morton dwight moody just stepped off and says i i always do get out of the way for them something i don't have the rewards exactly right but you see he gave place brother brown said for some people this is the only millennium they're ever going to have don't get entangled up with them given place meekness the bible said the meek shall inherit the earth those who give place this world's not my home amen i'm not here to try to make it you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna be the well let me go on and they notice verse 24 i want you to notice the scripture and they that are christ's have crucified the flesh it's speaking of that old nature on the inside notice have crucified the flesh with the affections and left they're still there but it's been crucified they're not in here but it shows that part there's got to come a greater ruling part on the inside and we must live by that authority not be drawn out into these gates as soon as we're drawn our spirit we're defeated is that right as soon as we're drawn out in any from living back there in that presence we're defeated under the samuel but what a when when i have to approach something in the natural you don't approach it by your own things and say god i got this so i'll call you when i need spiritual help no no it's for every part of our life amen right he's every part of our life this is not a thursday and a sunday and when jesus when i need you i'll bring no he's our life he's our life we see so much of that in the world already with hypocrisy look where the world turned in 9 11. man everybody was going to church everybody become everybody under a crisis becomes religious but you see what about when everything else is going good what about some things are going your way come on now and then you see quickly then had just as quick as the church is filled up the churches start emptying yes is that right but it's a constant life that that's where a life of a believer because there's there's no very bridge to go back to i don't want to go back nowhere there's no desire there's no fear of going back in the world because the world has passed out of my life amen oh my if we live this is where i want to draw from here if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so if we're living there our soul we are placed and we're living from that court like you think of that drawing that we've had up weeks ago then let us also walk or this word means to direct one's life in the spirit first thessalonians 5 12. now look at this admonition we beseech you brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and be it and stand to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake upon him to say worship them right let's just look at this for a moment but esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves notice how the holy spirit would have paul to join these things together first of all to know them that labor among you and are over you in the lord well as as placed by god as a leader but remember it's it's that where you recognize it's not brother samuel but it's the word you're not being led by brother samuel you're being led by the world hey israel could say well where is moses going but to understand they weren't really looking that it was flesh they knew that moses was getting his direction from the logos from that pillar of fire so it was not man's mind that was leading it was god what a blessing that is that is to stabilize the life of the church and then as we recognize that that part that it's god that is feeding us it is god that is leading us now comes that responsibility to understand that great value of the revelation how many appreciate the leading of the lord you appreciate the word of god the holy spirit coming right down and ministering to your needs i don't know how many times you know where we can fellowship and say my you know this was not known but god came right down the way and spoke right to my heart you see that's not man man can't do that that's god doing that and that's god working on a channel between you and him that you might rest and then through the value that god i value that channel not just that channel but my life being a conduit that your word can come to because brother ram said where there's a resentful spirit in a service he said the holy spirit will not reveal anything so it becomes the responsibility that not only for the ministry but for us together to be a channel and this is where the responsibility paul is speaking of be at peace among yourselves that we recognize hey satan's desire is to come and disturb peace is that right never comes in like a red horse rider but it comes into the white yeah right is that right that's why brother could even say in christ the mystery you put someone among you fellowship with you and so forth and then the test becomes that we're able to stand with the word are you hearing me this is why you see this is why as the prophet could say where he says at that time he said you stay with your pastor he's ordained to lead you through i'm not saying that to lift me up i'm talking about the word because the word does not take into account nor does it operate based on somebody's feelings here or this here that's not how the word operates remember a peacemaker is standing with the word amen is that right paul could even see how that the church was being troubled in galatia and paul could even make the statement that there are those who are troubling you i wish that they even were cut off from among you paul's desire and his love was for the entire body but when someone had rose up to bring trouble to the body let me just say this plain and simple there is one thing that matters more than anything else and that's the body of jesus christ that matters more than my feelings my thoughts or my ideas [Applause] is the body of jesus christ this work right here that god has entrusted me it matters the body matters not me not anybody else it's the body that matters and that's how we're to live our life it's the body of jesus christ first not my family first the bounty of jesus christ first amen hallelujah and my family isn't cooperating with that then it's time for the family to get straightened out so that it can cooperate with the body amen hello somebody i mean this is this is the reality of how where brother brown would warn how satan would come in very subtly to try to disrupt the program of god but you and i are charged with that not just brother samuel we are in charge with it you to recognize that channel and then also to recognize that within your own life brother bill can't do it for you when he song leads paul can i can't your husband can you can you're entrusted remember a dominion that's been given back to you as sons and daughters of god it is incredible how sometimes that we allow the enemy to take things from us that we've been given dominion over i will stand in my pray for the sick or i'll do this and we're going to take dominion over the spirit and yet then we'll allow another spirit to just enter in amen incredible but how can we give a little cow can we allow one is because with his flesh there's always a part within us decide whether you say amen or not it's true it's true i mean brother brown would have never had to say it in christ the mystery if it wasn't true that's right true right there's a part about us that's tribal by nature that's what we're dealing with the new birth don't take that out of you it changes your soul and gives you dominion so you're not living subject to the tribe of your family name but you are living according to the name of jesus christ for he has redeemed me out of all kindred nations and tongues is the kingdom of god first brownings are second amen third we'll have water a point you want to put you understand this is where paul could write in second corinthians 13 11. i better get going finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace i read this to you one last week live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you how many want the god of peace and love with us i want it with me i i need him i need him every day of my life so here's the quad here's the qualifier live in peace well in in is dealing with a place a position of where we're to live from now notice this word peace means to make peace i want you just to hold that now to make peace to cultivate or keep peace a harmony to be at peace so a person in order to actually operate you you might indeed be filled with the spirit of god but to actually operate as a peacemaker there's times where you and i both we have to go before god and we just this is not a one once in a while trip it's living in the presence of god now friends we we believe in prayer life we believe in getting into the word of god sometimes we're looking for we're looking for avenues of victory and god is letting us know you want to get closer to me very simple brother graham said read and pray and you'll draw closer to god has nothing to do about do you feel like you got understanding that day did you feel like something i don't know how many times in the morning with devotions when i'm going through certain things and devotions and maybe it's in isaiah or jeremiah because i have a plan that i follow each year and you know just so that i don't get in study mode because that's very easy to do and so when i'm looking at there's sometimes where i feel like my goodness i feel like the pipe from heaven is just wide open and my goodness there's streams flowing everywhere lord have mercy how am i ever going to minister this and minister that on top of other outlines here and this and that and then there's other times that i feel like is is there a pipe sometimes that has nothing to do with oh brother samuel you're not living where you should be no remember there are times for that that is times of proving grounds as well i'll tell you i'm just learned in those times not to get go down and oh my goodness what have i done i've learned in those times is just you know what just listen because god will give to me beyond what my conscience can actually pick up there are things and i've witnessed it where the holy spirit maybe i'm studying in another part and all of a sudden something will come back and sure enough it was in one of those days that i thought nothing itself didn't seem like any pipe was open but sure enough it dropped but it dropped beneath that conscience down to the subconscious in my life you see this is where our trust is in the lord oh my amen this is part of our life this is part of the responsibility you know one one to go around and operate the world right now the world wants to go around and supposedly they want to make peace but they want you to agree with them and all we've got to make peace and you know peace in an incredible that the very symbol that they use for peace is a very blasphemy against the cross of calvary it shows a broken cross are you hearing me there is no peace outside of the lord jesus christ there is no peace outside of the gospel of the lord jesus christ none whatsoever this peace is not a temporal peace it is an eternal peace but it's amazing that this peace that house it would try to be operated now as we look at this it's to make peace how many know there's times to make peace when you make peace it shows that there's differences that's part of being a peacemaker there's times when you have to make peace right and then there's other times here's another part cultivating it this takes a wise steward right not just man woman too cultivating for those things that make for peace and keeping those things that you identify this is peaceful this goes well keep that so these are our responsibilities so we're not just aimlessly wandering around notice paul would write in romans 12 16 be of the same mind paul would write this over and over and over i don't believe he's just writing to all the sorry make believers unbelievers out there the real believers don't need no help no we need help with this we need reminded of it be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condensed sin to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits notice skip on down to verse 18. or no lurid 17 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as life in you live same word peaceably make cultivate or keep peace to be at peace in yourselves now you realize before we can ever be at peace with one another we've got to be at peace in ourselves so you see where satan comes to work is to get our peace all twisted up that's right think of how that this is if it be possible to live in a state with one's friends my goodness i mean there'd be no problems with it just me and me on this planet are you on this planet are you with me where do where do all of our difficulties come from not my dog not my pets human relationships are you hearing me how much that all these things even as we as pointing out here even earlier even when paul or peter would write adding to your faith adding to that real experience in your life and you're adding all the way up all of those parts that are packed in your life where do they come out in human relationships are you hearing me they come out in times where it has to show that there's something greater on the inside than just a person is all they've got this person is so peaceful there's a lot of people who there are very peaceful right there's people have such a peaceful spirit but it may not be that they've got the real peace of god on the inside is that right now notice when we look at this live peaceably with all men because this requires a laboring a laboring think of it a man who loves god must labor after this think about how that a man you know we can't we cannot have broils you know fusses and misunderstandings with others without having our own peace that's disturbed how many feel good when you've had an argument no probably feel lower than the pad underneath this carpet you don't feel good about it or when you there's been an exchange of words you don't feel good about it if you do you you you think you might need something you might you might need a touch of the real touch of the holy ghost if you enjoy that and that's how your life is because a real child of god does not love disturbance amen let me just say this to you it isn't just well this person they avoid conflict they do that but a real child of god is a peacemaker one who loves peace and who seeks after it not only in their own marriage not only in their own home but in the church of the living god they seek for peace oh my think about it you and i've come to a place if you've been born again of the spirit of god where the peace of god has completely set down on the very throne of your heart but how did that come about how did that come about think about it how did that go well well brother sam you know he went to calvary died and rose again and sent back to hollywood but how how did that come about where the peace of god is on the throne of our heart how did that come about if first of all started with his love ministering to us and drawing us dealing with us because he knows if i can just contact them this shadow this cloud this unbelief these attributes all that right there will be cast aside this is the power the peace of god what an atmosphere you know brother says it like this what kind of an atmosphere should we live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer let me say lord help me remember constantly in prayer doesn't mean you always have to be in your prayer closet because most of us realize by now sometimes the best laid plans that we have they get upset but this is where paul said pray without ceasing it isn't saying that we take away from those times we we seek for those times to get along with god but remember you can also be alone with god right while you're walking down the midst of a store you're in your car don't ever remember the circumstances it's not what dictates to you if you're in an environment and that environment's all twisted up what can you do you're able to slip away to a separate little room or slip away over there and say lord jesus you know the need for the moment lord oh my we're talking about sons and daughters of god with a deep love now notice here's the result of it with a deep love for every person we come in contact with notice every person we come in contact with hebrews 12 14 follow peace make sure i get this right with all men amen and holiness without which no man shall see the lord now this is our responsibility the desire that we have the greatest desire when god has dealt with our life is that our lives would be a display of the lord jesus christ that it's not so much that people are are noticing boy they you know they're they're religious no but there's a display of christ about our life but sometimes you know family work and other times follow peace with all men then there's situations then that are not very peaceable but the scripture says follow pursue after peace seek that let that be the first priority because without that in holiness then they can see no reflection of christ through your life look how this reads in the amplified state strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will ever see the lord you realize you can disagree with somebody and still be at peace to be at peace doesn't mean that people have to agree with you all right that's right is that right sometimes living peaceably it means you realize i don't need to engage them hello i'm talking about wisdom and realizing i don't want to upset i would not want to cause them to say something against me against the lord so you realize it's not a time of engagement what are you doing you're making peace you're not walking up there and saying well let's see what they're going to see today no that's not following after peace oh my because we want them to see that reflection of christ through us first timothy 2 1. i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of things be made for all men hello for kings and for all that are in authority why that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty you appreciate peace i do i appreciate peace i appreciate peace in the church i appreciate peace in my home that isn't just something we know that's just it just you know something that magically happens we have to work at it pete this right here that paul is talking about he's not saying hey we'll just put this on autopilot it don't work that way because our humanness is not on autopilot are you here notice first peter chapter 3 verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no diet let him rescue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it how many seekers of peace you come into your house and you wonder why isn't this picked up you ain't seeking peace you you might as well get the trenches laid out right and let's just face it when we come from things of life whether it's our job whether it's things of life sometimes where things get that things and cares of life that get up on us burdens and sometimes things that we're entertaining i'm not talking about things sinful i'm talking about just in carrying burden sometimes and then things that we're entertaining this thought about or this thought about it and before we know it we're so in such a turmoil in our own spirit to where we're not looking at things as a son or daughter of god would look at it instead we're here we are and something is said or this is done but as the children of god were to seek peace but let me tell you something before i ever step foot in that door these are not buttons that we push these are things that god is telling you and i cultivate your life in my peace live in that place because you and i do not know the next moment we do not know the next time somebody's going to say something about us somebody's going to offend us so we don't have all that in control oh bless god brother samuel it'll just roll it'll just roll right off of me who do you think you're going to get to believe that it might roll off of your soul but it'll have to be dealt with in your spirit and in your mind so that you don't think of it every time that you see that person or their name is mentioned come on now we're preaching right down where the rubber meets the road we're talking about seeking peace but sometimes you think well brother samuel i walked right in i was seeking for peace but you weren't even praying you weren't even looking to god and really submitting yourself how did adam speak to the wind and say peace because where he was living you see this authority that you and i are given remember it's from him and it must flow for our lives let me move on to ephesians 4 2. with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace knowing paul is dealing with how that peace itself seeking for peace it invites the holy spirit remember brother rahm says when you go to acting like a wolf the dove takes his flight so you want god to come into the meetings god to come into your home god to visit you then remember this is very important endeavoring you know what endeavoring means how many know we're in a battle paul said put on the whole armor of god this word endeavor right here is one of a strategic military term it means to strategically in other words you're not just walking around you know with the head in the clouds we're not we recognize with all the endeavoring but where does this all come back to our own personal walk with god this is where our peace comes from this is where peace comes from in our home it isn't like oh if i could just be like brother shane and sister lily if i could just it's because of where they would live if you're looking at somebody else and saying oh if i could just be like that oh if i could you can yes you can because nobody's got super dna in here right it's a matter of fasting if you chest trace traits back through our life i don't care what your last name is we got a lot of junk all right yeah and if you're one for the holy ghost we'd all be in a mess come on now you know so notice within these things endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace now look how paul would write of this here in romans 4 14 verse 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost now remember there were those who as far as liberty they were able to eat any meat they wanted to eat whether it was offered to idols or one or more they weren't eating it as meat that was offered to idols they were just hey it's this is filet mignon man it goes perfectly with lobster let's just take it in it had no bearing to them but there was another brother who was a weaker brother or a weaker sister that that troubled them [Music] right and so because it troubled them notice you had those that were going about with liberty and within that liberty it wasn't that they were condemned before god but now once this is brought to their attention because what is their liberty doing there is liberty between them and god god's not looking down and saying oh you shouldn't eat that filet mignon it was offered there on that cow that was offered to that i don't know there was complete peace between them and god but what paul is dealing with your actions is troubling the body and because of that troubling it's hindering growth now notice this verse 18 for he that in these things righteousness peace and joy all three things in the holy ghost in these things servant christ is acceptable to god and approved of men so we're the man himself that could stand over there and say man why aren't you eating meat today well i just i don't want to offend i want to help my brother i want to help i don't i don't need that what i need is my brother more than that piece of meat hallelujah i need my sister more than that piece of meat are you with me talking about appetites now that fellowship notice where paul is getting the focus because that's what real true christianity in the heart of a believer not only as the word is first but with the word being first it also eschemes the body before itself because that's what the lord jesus did he esteemed the body he endured the cross despising the shame thereof for what to redeem the body let us therefore notice follow after pursue you know what this speaks you know it just shows me right here every time we've been reading this follow ensue pursue you know what that means but this is something we've got to go after all right that's what it tells me it tells me that going after it really has to do with samuel getting beyond samuel are you hearing me getting beyond self or that barrier or that well you know this is right or this is right or this but it's following after the things which make for peace and things where with one may edify another so paul is dealing with there's the wisdom to know what things make for peace and follow after those things to understand that how many can say lord i i want to understand that right i want to understand that i want to further understand that in my home i've not i've got everything figured out and here i am a doctor's degree no no i i'm preaching to myself as well i want to know those things that make for wisdom there are certain times that may not even be wrong but there's certain times maybe to ask my wife certain questions and then there's certain times that i know this this may not be the best time it has nothing to do oh brother samus she may not be under authority she's not a doormat and neither am i a dictator but it's recognizing look at god god knows even how to god could have came right out of fire david rider with bullets but instead watch how god approached it in a peaceful way there was this man and you know he sent down there there was this other guy had a nice sheep he sent down and took that lamb he had his own but he went and took that one what do you think about that kill the man nathan said got it buddy all right you're the guy you're the man you're the guy right now we're talking about what happened peaceably it opened him up if he would have come in today david what in the world are you doing like this but you see the word comes peaceably to open us up peace opens us up that's why many times when brother brown i'll just just go with this right now that's why brother graham tells us many times he talks about the pastor he never said the pastor was the eagle of the team oh the pastor you know he used to be the eagle no the pastor is not the eagle he's the ox that's right you know what the ox is oh it's not something it's oh boy it's soaring right now brother bam talks about you know the evangelists and the prophet and and of course they they have their own things that they deal with but an ox for the rem tells the ox is what he has the yoke four feet on the ground the pastor can only go by what's being shown god can give him insight but the life itself will paint the picture come on now it'll just show because it's four feet on the ground on whatever the light the fruit that's coming out shows whether it's been drawn from that's right and that's what brother brown talks about as a pastor he said patient sometimes he said the congregation says man why are you hurting up and dealing with this there's reasons i'm not here to explain that or go through that but there's reasons for that waiting for god's timing there's reasons for all because why god is a god of peace and there's times to approach and to deal with certain things and everything that is number one is the body in wisdom to understand those things that cultivate peace let me just try to let me just try to rap i'm going to wrap this up here so true peace in the home you know remember a peacemaker is one of god but true peace in the home is not one person getting their way whether it's a son or a daughter not with any piece well just let him do that man so everything will be at peace no no that's not peace that's called war that's right remember satan comes in by flatteries right the white horse rider come in i can't get to that tonight peaceably then what does the red horse rider do he comes to take peace all these things moving around and about this is why they're saying it doesn't mean we storm right out there is times within this part here true peace in the home is not one person getting their way sometimes where has to come this is where i'm making peace all right that's him how did he make peace okay how did god make peace with us did he send down commandments that didn't make peace he came himself the bible said he is our peace yes amen he tore down walls of division this is the scripture ephesians 2 this is him making peace tearing down walls things that were hindering him and no go zones no gun he tore those down how by himself self coming as our peace you see waltz could not have been torn down if it was not the god of peace but he came down to tear his whole purpose in tearing down those walls was to reconcile us back in fellowship when we were unlovable this is why when brother memory talks in greatest boundary fought and he talks about looking up into the sky and he says you see everything up there just moving around you know all the stars and the planets and everything he said all of that he said i looked in there oh everything is in its position and when it's in his position you know here it is it's it's showing the constellations and everything is just right and he says i thought of how that the beings are in the heavenly and how that is to be on the earth with the church of the living god and he says how he says that if if one member gets out of order it throws the whole thing out of line don't you see why the enemy wants to get after just one true why because if he can get one then he can break order sure this is why brother rem says we must strive to maintain the order of the spirit we must strive press go it's going beyond ourselves let me read this in closing galatians 5 14. i'm going to read from the amplified version that saved me from defining certain things and i just feel to read in these verses for the whole law concerning human relationships is complied within the one precept you shall love your neighbor as you do yourself who's my neighbor the one who's in need all right remember oh yeah brother brian read that up here on on sunday that presentation remember the one who was real righteous i'm like yeah i don't know what i want to taint my i don't want to taint my walk no they'll taint my life your life's already tainted it's a bad spirit it's already tainted don't matter how righteous is it out here it's already tainted in here you can only give to people what's in here not what's out here but here comes some here come the samaritan around he saw one was in need it had nothing to do with is this guy a samaritan it had nothing to do with is he one of my family is had nothing to do this was his neighbor is one who he saw right had a need who is my neighbor the one that god shows you has a need well who might who might that be who god shows to you oh i might die oh maybe i need to buy shoes and clothes no let me tell you what some of the needs are sometimes healing is a necessity in our life from when we're sick we get disease we get afflicted is that right right sometimes a healing healing is a process is that right but there's many ways let me just refer to a couple places many ways that god heals god heals by music how many knows that yes god heals my music god heals by medicine notice god heals brother braham says god also heals by understanding as well by reaching out and trying to understand of you know maybe this person's why why do you think this way why do you feel this way god heals by that way god heals by love and brother brown puts it like this and look away to jesus he said love he said that stretched out amen where's the longest stretch oh in that place that we've crucified stretch out right right but it's god who does the healing you see the god inside of you that same god that we've been talking about that has reconciled you and me unto himself not just paid the price he paid for reconciling before you brother gabriel could ever come to god sister amanda beforehand he already made a way and you know what he came with the gospel of peace you know what the gospel of peace is about it's already done all right it's calling you to what it's the gospel of peace calling you to peace he did that as as the son of god our sacrifice our perpetuation that that same peace might come into our lives that we might be at peace with god and be peacemakers one that even in seeing a need we lay down our own and now you can't help it if somebody when you call them into the way of peace whether they come or not that's not enough for you to decide you understand it's like if i tell paul paul come up on come on up here and let's make peace but i want you to walk up those stairs and paul walks up these deer no no you got to come this way there's a way there's a way back into fellowship are you hearing me there's a way you have to come the provided way you can't just come anyway but you see for in our lives we must have when we come to god god draws us unto himself that reconciliation has already been made and what's he doing the holy spirit is working to reconcile to reconcile what has already been reconciled the debt's been paid now the holy spirit comes to seek out those who are included in the party and to make reconciliation real praise the lord what does that the peace of god so you see to be a peacemaker it starts here first it starts here first and that's where satan wants to attack he'd love to keep a life separate from the peace of god he let me just say this he'd love to keep a person in a church referring to different things and maybe under religious but never ever come to the peace of god in their own lives that's a dangerous situation right it's a dangerous situation and then satan could not hand he could not stop those how how god has moved and their lives have been so changed by the peace of god and there's a peace but what he works to try to do is to try to hinder peace that's right in our lives because you know where there's not peace where there's turmoil where there's upset it's hard to think right when satan gets you out of your i see your groove you're in peace it's hard to meditate about the things of god are you hearing me that's true why satan's desire is to try to hinder and take peace well brother samuel i've got the peace of god down deep in my soul i thank god for that but there's many things here i can't get to tonight of where satan came in even to the prophet's home and his wife was filled with the peace of god but there were times where things came to take peace couldn't take the peace of god from her soul right but tried to take peace from the home sure and i say tonight we're peacemakers not compromisers all right we are peacemakers any ground that the enemy thinks that he can have we can just say it tonight it's not your ground and you can't have it that's right that ground is part of the peace treaty hallelujah oh let's just pray father lord thank you for your word tonight lord i i realize that as you've set your word here before us is to cultivate our lives but lord really you've been what you've done you've just reminded us of the authority that we have as sons and daughters of god in you lord no matter even sometimes we're situations and things that lord that we come in contact with sometimes lord it's just the menial tasks of life that sometimes just get overwhelming but father you remind us lord of who we are remind us of the authority that we have in you lord i pray that if there would be any spirit of bitterness or indifference in any life or god right now father in your presence may it just be laid down may our heart just say lord i lay it down i lay it down lord in your presence i don't want that occupying my life [Music] i just want the peace of god to flow freely in my life [Music] what i want to live live in that place called to me cultivate sometimes i'm called to make peace [Music] lord jesus other times we're called to cultivate it [Music] i think of how that you spoke in your word you not only said that your sheep know your voice but you said i know my sheep by name i think of that lord when i look at the stars david would write under inspiration how that every star has that certain peculiarity about it [Music] it's a name the stars are named by you not man by you think about it lord of how that even where astrologers and different ones would even speak of orion and different ones that was not man first that was you that gave that in the word orion who holds the seven stars and lord to each one of those we could look at them i look at them lord at night sometimes on a nice summer night was clear outside my they all looked the same the lord each one of them have a name a uniqueness lord just as your sheep every one of us have a uniqueness [Music] lord sheep but all of us have our own our temperaments make up our makeup we all have these lord the parts that we have to we deal with in our life but lord help us as lord your prophet would look at it in his own life and he would ask you the one day when he couldn't hit the squirrel in the eye and say god why did why am i like this and you responded to him and said i've made you this way for a purpose the lord he was all tore up about that everything had to be perfect he he couldn't enjoy just hitting that squirrel anywhere it had to go in the eye but you let him know i made you that way for a purpose now to think about that there could be a lot of things in his natural life where he could get tore up about it but lord from that moment i just happened to believe it didn't take away the battle but it gave brother branham grace as it would give each and every one of us grace to realize we're put here for a purpose even our temperament that yet it must be under the leading of the holy spirit it must be continually under your guidance or god or even the very things that you have placed within us to serve your purpose if we get it out on our own that's where we get weary that's where we get frustrated that's where we get down that's where peace seems like something that oh lord if i can just get back there lord help us tonight help us to realize the greatest the greatest privilege that we have and for every battle for every situation is that we would take our lives into the presence of god sometimes lord i know i know i'm speaking to believers here tonight i know how it is they do too the times the lord god won't get in to pray sometimes lord in prayer just don't have the words to say sometimes lord with even maybe things that's going on and it just it feels like things are closing in my we would give anything to have that rushing that moves in and oh my just feeling so uh you know your presence just rushing in sometimes lord here we are in those moments but lord god to where in that time where we can just lord in brokenness surrender our will lord even invite your presence it will invite the god of peace and of love help us lord the greatest battle lord god you won lord that battle lord that battle lord that was in our life that raged that's been settled by the prince of peace himself down in the depths of our soul by the holy ghost sometimes lord we deal with the battles out here in that spirit realm flesh all those areas lord sometimes when disease hits our body or pain lord we feel those things but god i pray i pray help us lord as sons and daughters of god that we can realize lord the simplicity of just living in your presence [Music] what what a privilege lord for every situation here we could go we could look for an answer here and an answer but if we could just get still in your presence and say lord let me be a peacemaker let there be peace resolved here a reconciling to where maybe my thoughts my feelings my ideas my attitude let that be reconciled to where it's [Music] forsaking of my thoughts forsaking of my will to your will granted lord i pray through every home [Music] through lord god every child of god granted lord if there's one tonight that does not know you in that way lord will you just minister your peace to their heart to that place lord of a surrender to where they just lord will release everything to you granted lord i pray in jesus precious name your care's on here [Music] oh [Music] oh he is [Music] [Applause] he cares for you [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] who has broken down [Music] he is our peace [Music] thank you lord he is our peace who has broken down every wall [Music] all your cares cast all your cares on him glory cares for you is [Music] [Music] [Music] he is our peace [Music] [Music] coming down from [Music] yes [Music] of [Music] give us peace lord hallelujah [Music] [Music] above sweep over [Music] [Music] in [Music] of love

services like this tonight lord where you you just make your character known to us lord and that as as you as the brother was saying breaking down those those tribal barriers and family barriers lord realizing we're part of a bigger family lord part of the family of god lord we our desire lord is to to follow after peace lord as you said tonight father because in doing that we're following after you lord and the same peace that you call us into lord that there would be that that spirit same spirit in us would call others they would see the peace that we have they desire to come and have that same peace lord i pray that you'd make help us to be the peacemakers we heard about tonight lord appreciate it help us lord whenever we come to the next situation the devil puts in our way the next
