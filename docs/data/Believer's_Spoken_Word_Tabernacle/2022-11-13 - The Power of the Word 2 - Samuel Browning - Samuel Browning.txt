is fullness of joy father we need you Lord we need more of you oh God we are thankful Lord that your mercies are new every morning we're so thankful for your faithfulness Lord oh God we need you Lord Lord how we are so grateful oh God that we can we can come to you Lord bring our petitions bring the needs bring every request bring questions Lord a that scripture you know Lord has just been pulsating on My Heart Lord for weeks of how that Moses would speak to the children of Israel there in Deuteronomy he would speak of how that it would be known what nation has such judgments and statutes as this nation that Lord that the people that others around would would see as you would Express in that scripture that thou art called by the name of the Lord God that your character would be so would be manifest in their lives that would be a life that separated and different and this is the scripture Lord that have been just so pondering on Amen that God that a nation would have God so nigh upon all that they would call upon him for and Lord The Desires in our life are not for the material and temporal things of this world it's for you Lord it's for you it's that Lord this word might come to pass in our life this is our desire Lord we need healing in our body there's a need for deliverance there's need Lord for the filling of the Holy Ghost there's need for refilling there's needs the Lord God Among Us Lord and you are still the same yesterday today and forever what a people that has God so nigh unto them Lord it certainly was not us Lord finding you but it was you coming to find us Lord you weren't lost we were lost Lord you came and you sought us out oh God how we thank you Lord for your mercies Lord so we asked you this morning Lord oh God that even in this moment and even as the word is coming forth May our hearts Lord be filled with prayer Lord may it be filled Lord with as the word is coming so be it Lord let that rain in my life let it move in my heart whatever Lord our needs are and those things that you would Lord make known o God it's in your presence that we receive fullness of joy because Lord in your spirit when the word has went forth there is no other court of appeal the Supreme judge has spoken granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ may you just Lord have the preeminence the Lord in every part of this service Lord I give myself to you Lord you see moments ago as I stood before the door that would lead out of my office and I asked you would you just go before me would you lead me to the platform would you just make a way Lord I just Lord want to be your assistant this morning that you would just speak to our hearts and our lives Lord help me to step out of the way Lord that you can come Lord I pray in a personal way how we love you and we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen don't you love him and let's turn in our Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapter 8. just so good to be in his presence good to be gathered amen with each of you and amen it's just a privilege to serve the Lord amen amen sister Millie did you hear that birthday wish foreign did he buy you a big cake yet well we're going to have to work on him it's coming I'm sure it's coming amen God is so good so good to see each and every one of you and I also want to remember it almost slipped my mind and I've tried to send it out to other people but with um let me just pull it up here if you wouldn't mind coming up tomorrow here not here but what's going to be going on tomorrow is brother brother Timothy at Sean brother Timothy's no stranger to us he's a friend he's been here many many many years brother Timothy ashong from Ghana and um I just wonderful message that brother Timothy has spoke here he's my goodness I think the first time brother Timothy came it might have been back in 97 or 98 but just to keep it in mind on Monday morning this tomorrow morning he's scheduled to undergo prostate cancer surgery and here is actually in North Carolina and he's been there his wife is flying over also to help and during the healing and recovery process so uh we just the prayer request is this that we would remember him in prayer in our services and then as well as praying for him tomorrow and and I forgot to mention that would you mind to Bow your heads once more and we'll just approach him would that be okay just just as a real need here Heavenly Father Lord I ask you to Lord forgive me Lord my mind Lord even of all the reminders that I've had down and praying upon this but God we are thankful Lord that we can come to you Lord and we lift up brother Timothy a strong Lord and asking for safe traveling mercies for his wife and Lord we ask that you would guide o God the surgeon's Lord and I pray that God that Lord May there not be one Speck of cancer Lord that would Escape Lord may you just move Lord I pray in such a special way because we know that even now Lord that oh God you're still The God Who dissolves the Lord every sound Lord and we recognize Lord that cancer Lord It's a bachelin Cell It's a spirit that's God in there but Lord we're thankful Lord that you are still the Mighty God you're greater Lord than cancer and we just ask this Lord word for our brother Lord for a complete deliverance and a healing of his body in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah God bless you Ecclesiastes 8. who is who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed now Solomon's right in here of just even a man in the natural that even with natural wisdom we've all experienced times where we've had the if I can say it like this an understanding or an aha moment they call it in school or when things begin to open to us and oh I figured this out maybe it's something in your home or something's been put together and there's a difference you see it's reflected on our face now if that's how that is in the natural and it is then how much greater is it in the spiritual sure because it was in the spiritual that when Moses came forth from the presence of God and came down the Bible said his face is shown how much greater is the wisdom of God than the wisdom of man so it's we just look at this in verse two I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that in regard of the oath of God be not Hasty to go out of his sight but stand stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him so we know there's a there's there is uh if this is in the natural how much more in the spiritual to stay in the presence of the Lord you see this is why it's so important that even when after a service after service is finished and what God has spoken let me just say it like this brother Brahm says when the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you when he's here to inspire you he says you confess that word because he's there to back it up that's the inspiration of the Holy Spirit so to understand when we then in his presence because there's a lot of things with just simple cares of life let alone other things of entertaining different things that wants to draw us out of his presence but we realize his presence is not just confined to this building but his presence it goes with us and God will speak to us if we'll just draw nigh unto him how many knows the scripture says draw nine to God and he'll draw nine to you and brother Brandon would take that same scripture over and over and over and he would deal with sometimes he said we have so many other thoughts on our minds who are thinking about the latest dishwashing powder and he brings it down to simple things that are not even sinful are you hearing me now they're not even sinful things but it's just when we become occupied yeah and that's what Satan wants to do is occupy our lives and that's a battle that's a battle every moment it's a battle for you and I to sit here and not let our minds be occupied on tomorrow or what's coming up it's a battle we have to fight there is a battle that's engaged remember songs have went forth this is not right here this is not just a relaxing time it's a time of battle because the word the songs always go forth and then the word is leading us into battle and I believe when the word is leading us into battle we follow the word there's victory Victory is certain I just want to follow the word so we want to stand to entertain his presence amen verse 4 where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what do us thou Jesus Christ he's the king of saints the almighty God whoso keepeth the Commandment shall fill no evil thing and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd just like to speak here just once again just for a few moments just taking just the thought and just moving ahead just a little bit upon the power of the word and I want to just deal with the thought behind that a sub thought if we could under that because when we talk about the power of the word we don't want to just leave it to where it's something that we're observing are you hearing me we just don't want it to be where it's something that we're observing or you know we're giving An Occurrence of something that happened but we want to take it in and let the power of the word work in our lives where we're Witnesses of it so we want to deal with that of recognizing receiving and releasing the power that's in the word recognizing receiving and releasing the power that's in the word you realize that you know brother Branham would make this statement over and over because it's right there in the scriptures of how he says that God he said even when the preacher's preaching and how he's ministering and he said no matter how the minister how are they with all the things that would be put together it says it's not the minister that heals you it's not the minister that delivers you but God has sent the ministering gifts and this is here he sends as the Bible says he maketh his ministers as a flame of fire because his ministers are anointed with his spirit the same The Same Spirit that sends the word that delivers the word to you and I that has delivered the message to you and I that same Holy Spirit has never left the church it's God speaking his word and he's declaring God's just not uh giving his word just to say things but God is speaking his word to call forth what he has already said that now it would come into manifestation and that's God declaring that and it's it comes into our lives that we would we would receive that we would recognize that and we would receive that and I just want to deal with a few parts here this morning on this uh within this thought and I want to take from there when we're looking at where the word of a king is there is power now we know that there are natural laws and natural things in the land Peter describes all of that from in Acts and then over into second Peter and we understand that there's things that are even laws and things within the land that if you don't heed to them and Obey him you you're thrown you know you get thrown in jail or fines or whatever more there's a penalty that's from them but we recognize that within just the natural how much greater is almighty God God's word and how much more with his word it's to give us life you understand what I'm saying we could be going we could follow all of the you know the Natural Things of the land and I believe we should the Bible said give unto Caesar what's Caesars right but to understand that God's word the God's word it is there and it's greater than every other word I want you to think of this every word begins with a thought it's greater than every other word his word if I can say it like this and not stand here and elaborate just on this and this moment his word is greater than your thoughts of yourself his word is greater there's no limitations to God's word this very word right here where the word of the king is there is power and that word power means mastery it means to to exercise a lordship over it now I want you to think of this God is a gentleman God does not force himself on anyone because remember this is why every conquering that's ever took place when one nation or country conquers another one that conquering never lasts right it only lasts as long as this person remains in power and this and then eventually something Rises up to overthrow that right and that type of conquering never leads to peace it actually leads to a resentment I mean we've seen that even in our generation okay because those are things that we can you know it can be thought well these people need to be liberated but it isn't what we think they need to be liberated because it comes back to this this point here if a heart doesn't want to be liberated then it doesn't matter of all the truth all the word everything that's around that which can bring a liberty to their lives they have to want that and if they don't want it then there's a resentment that sets in there's an opposition against it but so the word when we're looking at this remember the Lord Jesus applies Us in the scriptures he speaks of how that when when when one is come when the son had come and there were those who said in that time we will not have this man to rule over us they did not want to accept his rulership they did not want the son to rule over them but oh my to think what it meant and what it means to receive the word without going through multiple examples if we could call the woman up at the well and ask her what do you say about the power of the word what do you say about the Mastery of the word I tell you what she would say she would say what I would say in any other life that's been set free by the power of the Holy Ghost by the pound of the word I was bound and I wanted to be free and when he came the word came to me and the word began to master every situation every circumstance in her life the word was coming in in power he didn't he couldn't change her if she did not desire to be changed but there was something beneath all of the immorality all the baggage all the darkness there was that something that was a part of God in the beginning and that's what God was coming to liberate that's why we need the Holy Ghost that's why we need the quickening power amen we just don't need uh you know just where our lives are so filled up with well I know this and I know this and I know this Doctrine there's the whole reality is is that we would know the Lord Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection amen he is a quickening spirit it's a quickening power it's a transforming power and we need that Mastery of the spirit of God because that Mastery is where it comes to a superiority or a control over someone or something the Bible Will Tell Us in Psalms 29 4 the voice of the Lord is powerful the voice of the Lord is full of majesty in Psalm 68 33 to him that wideth upon the heavens of Heavens which were of old Lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice amen I want you to turn with me to Isaiah 55. your Bibles I don't have this right there in that particular point but I want you to look here in the scripture very simple we're we're familiar with this scripture but we're talking about the power of the word recognizing it and receiving it then that's what releases that within our lives so verse 6 of Isaiah 55 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near so finding him while he's near so he's not afar off he's right here so seek Him seek you seek Him the Lord who is near how do I know he's near because he's speaking he's moving he's dealing with your life so we seek after him now this applies to every every part of our life no matter what your need and where you set spiritually this morning this word still applies notice in verse 7 let the wicked forsake his way now notice the wicked's got to be able to forsake his way now you can say brother Samuel I can't well let's just use a few examples the woman at the well that we just spoke of she had to be willing to forsake her way how could she do that right you say brother Sammy you just said moments ago she was wanting to be free she had a desire to be free and when the word began to deal with things in her life she knew when the word was coming across your pathway there was going to be some decisions that would be made that would be life-altering there would be things that she would have to let go of all right but you understand there was Mastery the power of the word the presence of God was there to give her strength to forsake that [Music] Hallelujah yes and the unrighteous man his thoughts so sometimes it's not even your ways it's your thoughts you've got to forsake sometimes you can say well I I'm got this I've met this I met this I'm good here I'm good here sometimes it's your thoughts because our thoughts are no good thoughts are no good it must be his thoughts remember before a word is spoken it's a thought so a word is a thought expressed your thoughts and my thoughts is what has got us into trouble and not submitting our thoughts to him right so we need his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him oh I love that let him return to the Lord see God isn't holding anybody at Bay God's calling to his children even if you've drifted in your walk God's saying return unto me how do you return you return in your heart you return in your life you return to repentance return unto the Lord oh yeah and this is what he'll do he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon there is no situation that the handle [Applause] in this hour that we're living in let me just pause here a moment the hour that we're living in we recognize that the Lord Jesus we can quote the scripture all day long he triumphed over every principality and power that is the word of God but remember he has come to vindicate that this word that God has sent in this hour where the seals have been taken off the backside of the book it's an end time revelation and who's in revealing it's revealing the same God he is the mighty conqueror where men have wanted to sow up the veil to where he becomes obscure looking in you say how do you say it by how you say it's become obscure because when they can't truly see him for who he is what he has done what he has made available then they still remain in their same condition but when a heart sees him for who he is when it comes present to your life I'm talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ when that comes present to your life that's it amen are you hearing me that's it it's to recognize that he is the same one as the Bible said here he descends with a little book open what is the little book it's the Lamb's Book of Life he's got the whole book are you hearing me the whole Bible because this is The Book of Life he's got the whole Bible but he is speaking to that of his elect and it is the word that is ministering to the elect though the elect would set in darkness though the elect were under all sorts of conditions maybe like the woman at the well or one on so forth and so on but the word is what's energizing that seed on the inside to believe and let me tell you something it is God's strength that is coming to you has come to you that causes you to forsake your thoughts to forsake your ways it's God's strength that comes to you that ministers return unto me [Applause] he had put his foot upon the land and upon the sea what is he over he's over that ecclesiastical peace power he's over the serpent he's over every devil are you hearing me amen he's the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ we are not believing on a historical God we see him in plain view what's the evidence that you see him in plain view what's the evidence I see him in plain view because he is reflecting his authority and power through our lives it's a dominion over the flesh over sin over the devil and over the world verse 9. for as the heavens are higher than the Earth so are my ways higher than your ways my thoughts than your thoughts oh brother Samuel I I could never get there yes you can no you can't get there on our own efforts but I'll tell you there's a power here that's able to break you out of this realm into that other Realm Hallelujah there's a power here that's able to take you beyond the music beyond the doubts and be able to see Victory and be able to live above your ways above your thoughts what is it it's the same power that transported Elijah [Music] it's the same power it's the quickening power let me ask you a question what is it that transports a man or woman from sin to righteousness transports God sends what is needed to transform this is why the scripture could say he hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son this is what he has done this is the Mastery of the word let me tell you the final Mastery of the word in our lives is the change of our bodies it's working I said it's working it's working even right now the word is working even right now [Applause] the ram stands there in end time seed sign he preaches it he preaches end time seed sign there in Tifton Georgia but he just was at a meeting he was saying at that time I believe it was in Florida maybe it was in Florida at the Tabernacle but he was saying to teach my church a lesson he says I went to the platform there was a young lady who was laying on a cot bound she couldn't get off that cot brother Brown said I wanted to show my teach my church a lesson and listen what he says he says I went straight to the platform I took the text that God gave me and I preached that word and he said as I was preaching that word he said I just stayed right with the word and as I was preaching the word she got up off of the cop you understand what he's saying I'm teaching my church something what's he teaching the Mastery of the word I want to say this when brother ran him in two places he makes the statement he knows there's a change coming in his ministry but he says I want you to write this down the change that's coming in my ministry will not be so much a change in the ministry as it will be a change in me see that's what the third pool does it brings a change in our life that's what the seventh seal is all about don't let words confuse you the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord it's the fullness of his presence coming in a bright body [Music] it's making ready because that that seal has been released he's right here with us and what's it doing it's ushering us on in to the rapture that's why the prophet could say the Rapture cycle is on what does a cycle what is a cycle what's a cycle with planting right you you you you take the wheat you take so much of the grain you eat of it and then you re you plant what has come forth and then out of that one seed comes more and this is why when the scripture says Thou must prophesy again the word again means a cyclic up oscillatory operation in other words let me just do not to confuse you with big words I don't think you are but in other words that's what it's a cycle we are receiving the word we are eating the word becoming the word and the word is being sewn back into our lives it's a maturing that is taking place man I mean I trust that you're able to look at your life and say I'm not what I was before and I'm not just talking about 20 years ago no no I'm talking about even a month ago a week ago come on now because you might have wondered in here and everything else about your life but where are you today have you moved closer to God all around Hallelujah I can speak of things that God even within the past uh months has made known and when I say reveal I'm not just talking about observing but God bringing things down into my life it's victory and you know when it's victory over this guy it ain't nobody else this guy this guy this guy oh my let me go on here for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven wasn't that beautiful yesterday trapped you yeah oh that snow was flying I said Thank You Jesus I loved it man but notice well listen as the rain coming down and the snow he's not talking about a thunderstorm here are you hearing me we're not talking about it he's talking about something that comes down in uh silence something that comes down and it's not making great disturbance but it's coming down with the purpose the rain and the snow is coming down with the purpose the Bible said he poured out a spirit upon All Flesh but it don't stop there upon my handmade those who receive and surrender oh my for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and make us it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater sometimes where we're at is right here in this scripture we're wanting bread when we see rain we're wanting bread when we see snow we should want bread but remember for there to be bread there's got to be a seed and there's got to be nourishment for that seed is that right oh I can give you a Litany of quotes Easter seal 65 is the rising of the sun power to transform God's power to transform brother the man says no oak tree comes up overnight right but what is it it's a continual quickening that is taking place it's quickening quickening quickening quickening quickening we don't want to stop don't be settled with just one quickening but let it keep quickening you on up keep clicking we want to be quick enough you say how long does a quickening go until we see him [Applause] because when our loved ones appear before us right there there'll be another sweep another quickening and we'll be changed and then we'll Fellowship here on the breath of the Earth amen God has everything arranged is that right we need a continual quickness that's what we should seek for it's more of God when the rain and the snow you'll see the rain and the snow what does it do the the earth is made to absorb it take it in why because there's a seed that needs it look what he says in verse 11. so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me voice [Music] God is saying my word comes as the rain as the snow it comes as a former and lettering it comes as a sowing ring and as a maturing ring and it also cometh as the snow what is the snow though thy sins be a Scarlet they shall be whiter than snow a word that brings pardoning Grace a word that helps us to see ourselves as God sees us Hallelujah that's when a life recognizes they're a son and daughter of God brother when the word begins to be preached and they recognize that you don't need to coax them onto repentance it strikes their heart is that right amen the old the opening right there in Acts 2 what must we do to be saved it was an instructor heart what do we need to do repent oh Hallelujah but it shall accomplish that which I please they could preach a month to Sundays on that scripture that part right there it shall accomplish not what you please what I please remember God's not obligated we're not here and God's saying okay what's your purpose no we're here for God's purpose that's what we're here for yes we're here to serve his purpose we're here for that for that purpose to serve him with all of our heart that's what we're here for that but it shall accomplish that which I please so oh God I want the word to have preeminence Lord Jesus I want your word to have preeminence I want the word to come in and have Mastery over Samuel mastering over my ways Mastery over my thoughts Mastery over my life you say what are you saying remember who what nation hath caught so nigh unto them has all the things that we call upon him for what I am calling and asking upon him for is what he has said this belongs to you that's what we're praying about yeah yeah oh my and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sinned so the word of God it's more powerful it's here to master every situation and once you understand this there's churches all around that have the Bible thank God for the Bible thank God for the lives that's been given for him but do you realize friends what was needed because as brother Brown would give that dramatization of the auction where there was a violin nothing wrong with the violin but nobody wanted to bid on it nobody wanted it didn't seem like it had any value but there was one who was sitting in the audience he was there the whole time when nobody was wanting to bid on it but here he came one who knew what was in them and was able to release what was trapped in silence and he walked up and he takes it then he takes that bow predestinated ordained for this hour the Holy Spirit the inspiration that is poured out to make this word live and it begins to take the word and it begins to play upon that word you shall repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins restore the truth of the godhead restoring the reality of predestination and as it's being played there's a Melody that is in line with our lives there's a lot of other songs that tried to capture us but we weren't a part of those songs we were a part of this music sheet what was needed was the composer to move down and a director that can stand there and say what God has said is still the truth and God confirming it because God confirming his word is God speaking no he does send forth his voice and that a mighty voice it's the lion roaring who can but prophesy [Applause] [Music] God is determined to bring his word to pass amen he's determined I don't care how much unbelief is all around he's determined God's word he said it's not going to come back to me void it's going to accomplish that word is going to achieve are you hearing me time makes no difference sometimes you and I can get in a hurry but time does not make a difference the word holds mastery is to have Mastery in our life to bring the word to pass let me give you a few examples here within the scripture here are the disciples what's just what's the word here the same one who spoke in the beginning in Genesis 1. when the condition was Darkness chaos when you could say it was yeah chaos chaos means what disorder things are all out of order how can this be how are we going to bring this in order see God God gave the example how do we bring how do our lives come in order how do our homes come in order how is order brought by the word of God and he said to the darkness let there be light he didn't even he didn't go through and give a lot of a lot of other a lot of things just said let there be light because light is understanding light is revelation now you realize the first light that ever struck this Earth was Shekinah the Shekinah light of almighty God because it was the Shekinah light working upon the Earth that would cause the Earth to move around the Sun see here's the Shekinah Glory of God working Upon Our Lives to bring us fully into relationship with him it's his presence and the Bible says there was light his word held Mastery over the darkness [Applause] all the other seeds that were planted there the word held mastery over the circumstances and it released what they always were here he stands after a meeting he's in the back of the boat the Lord Jesus here he is the word made flesh and the Bible says that a great storm Came Upon the sea and that storm Satan was going to try to drown them are you with me but they woke him up they knew they needed him if they didn't they were going to perish but they asked him don't you care that we perish well of course he cared and of course he cares about you amen of course he cares about me and you might really be in you know what a storm does on the lake I mean look right now here just on our Lake there's some serious waves I've been out there on a boat with this fella right here one time I was out there with him one of the times and he told me he said oh we'll just go around Mouse Island right here and I'm I'm looking and the boats going we're right trying to get it out brother Dave you you think there's going to be fish biting this we were rolling I mean we were roping you know what waves can cause right wind can cause ways and cause waves in your spirit waves in your life a great storm but this is what they did they woke him up and that's the thing don't try to handle the storm on your own wake him up wake him up now you might have to go back to a place maybe there's a place in your life where you you kind of went astray but he's there he never left you he's near what I have to do go back and wake him up wake him up say Lord the storm that's present and let him speak to that storm because in speaking to that storm he's letting you know I care about you I want to do for you because let me say something the storms that come about within our life and they come about through many different ways but there's no storm that a person will ever face like a storm when they come down to the Jordans chilly Waters at the time of death remember the Samuel I'm not counting on going to death I'm counting on going to enter the Rapture are you ready are you ready if you're not ready to face that you're not ready for the rapture are you hearing me now let's not play games I don't mean to say it shows distinctly but the reality is is that you understand there can be a lot of storms in life but Storms Come in our life but what's important is all is your life founded on a rock right and he arose and he rebuked the women wind and he said peace be still you know what the Bible says you know what the Bible says that the way the when the wind ceased the waves think about it waves went from this call what was it mastery Mastery over the circumstance history because creation recognized the voice of its creator oh God help us to recognize the voice of our creator [Music] well if they come if they submitted if immediately What About Us think about Lazarus brother Wayne preached all over this but here was here was Martha right and when when finally when Jesus came here's what she said I know that whatsoever you ask God he'll do it that was wonderful right can you say Amen that was wonderful that's the truth right whatsoever you ask God he will do it yeah but you see that wasn't what Jesus wanted to bring to her that's one part of it and but he begins to begins to say this let me just refer to a few of these places Jesus told her thy brother shall rise again what did she say I know he will in the resurrection at the last day right but Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me not on me you have to start Believing on him right but believing on him then it leads into believing in him believing in him is to be dwelling in him and how do we get in him by one Spirit we are baptized into one body right who the believer than me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this notice what he's asking do you believe it see he believed it what he was expressing is who he was are you hearing me now yeah the word that was being spoken this was not reading from a letter he was announcing I am the resurrection and the light he was present right there at that moment and she says yea Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world how many of you ever you know our vehicles are so different nowadays there's no such thing as Keys anymore right but still I know sometimes even to get into people's house they've got all these you know doodads and gadgets and stuff to get in there but let me say this to you we've heard the term about skeleton keys right what's the Skeleton Key it's it's it's a key that's not really fitted to the lock but that skeleton key will open up multiple locks because it it just has a way about it that it's able to turn the Tumblers in a way but it's not really fitted right right but in order to have Real ACT access that's true access you've got to have the key that was made for that lock that's why there's there's another assignment the Holy Ghost is not something that is just coming faith is not just something that just well it has a little bit to turn a few of the Tumblers no when faith has come the key is faith that unlocks every door it's made to possess every promise Paul said we have with the grace that we have been given by faith we have access into this grace wherein we now stand who's given us this faith God has I said God has now notice this this key you know here was here was Martha standing there but in order for something to take place I I just really want us to drop on this right here here is the word of God here is the word to be spoken but she's got to be willing to forsake everything to recognize the word of God being manifested right there in her midst and here she's got one more one more little like brother Bramble called it one more little Cog that has to be turned she said yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God what happened then now things are starting to move because the question come down it wasn't whether Jesus believed it do you believe it it's not one of the Prophet believed in it's whether do you believe it not whether the pastor believes it do you believe it not whether your husband believes it do you believe it not whether your daddy believes it do you believe it believe us thou this I am the resurrection of life she said I believe Thou Art the son of God that was to come into the world in other words you are the promise that was to come here in this hour what's she doing she's recognizing him and here's what he told her take away the stone how many beliefs he could have spoke and removed that stone we're not talking about paper mache or fiberglass Stones was one time I worked in a little Sweatshop there for a few years and we made these these big rock sculptures out of things we had to pull these things out and you have blisters all over your finger from trying to pull them out they were hollow inside but they looked like rocks they would spray them and they look just like it no no they didn't have no substance to them this Stone was not just like a little Stone I've picked up rocks back here and rock said even this size they're heavy yeah yeah I said they're heavy he told them take you away the stone not to the men but to the women what was happening the word was having mastery now what do what did Mary say what did Mary say at that time Mary or Martha that said to him and said but Lord stinketh by now in other words corruption set in you know what she was saying she was right on as far as four days Corruptions already set in he's thinking but what she's what what is going to take place is creation to recognize its creator they had to remove the stone you have to remove the stone for the Sunday I want you to do that I can't do that for you you have to remove the stone are you hearing me Satan will sometimes that stone can be bitterness sometimes that stone can be a complex sometimes the song is this is a sin sin Satan wants to trap you in that what do I have to do take away the stone how do I take away the stone by the authority of him who is speaking to you Hallelujah we know the end there of this of the story here's the Roman Centurion I'm just giving just a few of these examples here's the Roman Centurion he has a servant who's grievously tormented every sickness is a devil when something as a disease is about the life it's torment right nobody feels good you don't feel good it's a tormenting spirit and Jesus here the Roman Centurion comes to him says I've got this need Jesus said I'll come and I'll heal him right but here's what he says he said I'm a man under Authority I know I'm not worthy that you would come under my roof you know what he's doing he's putting himself under the word don't try to come face to face just put yourself under it God help us to put ourselves under it sometimes it takes sometimes it takes a time for us to recognize that we're trying to do things by facing him I bow to eyeball and that'll never work what is it it's got to be me you coming under his authority that's what the Roman Centurion he said if you'll just speak the word only you know and he realized he says I don't need your physical presence to come to my home I'm not worthy of that you're a busy man but if you'll just speak the word only I know he says I've got people under me if I speak they do they carry out that word what is it it's a Mastery it's a word being taken place and so this is what he recognizes he recognizes this is more than a man this is God in Christ and once he recognizes he recognizes his position just like Joshua when it came to the Battle of Jericho Joshua recognized his position when he met the captain of the Lord's host do is get out of the way right it's me it's you listen friends that's the greatest that is the greatest battle that you and I have is us getting out of the way right right Hallelujah but this is why we always want to put ourselves in the background let him be before us and Jesus told him go your way as thou Hast believe so it shall be done unto you here's a group of individuals that came remember four four individuals that they brought a man who was sick I believe with the palsy and they looked there were no parking spaces available there was no seat there wasn't nowhere you know the story what they did they looked up and realized there's a way in there we're getting into that meeting we're going to get into his presence even if we've got to take the roof off we're going to get into his presence yes sir you know why they recognize who was there how polite is that to take somebody's roof off are you hearing me it shows when a person is Desiring to get into God's presence there is a source of Mastery that carries us beyond our traditional way of thinking because it's a traditional way of thinking this has to happen like this and this and this and this and this and God you're in a box you won't put God In The Box what happens is happens isolate yourself from God we don't want to put we want God to be God found the place where Jesus was standing and laid and the man they placed him they let him down the Bible says when Jesus I want you to think of the scripture when Jesus saw their faith it didn't say when he saw the faith of the man he said when he saw their faith right now are you hear me now that man I don't know what it took for him to make that kind of a journey I don't know all the being carried whether it's on a gurney or what however it was it wasn't a comfortable ride but not only did they know but there was something in his heart as well are you hearing me because if there hadn't been faith in his heart and there wasn't faith in the others Hearts the others carrying him would have said hey buddy we can't go in there we can't go in there you know what it shows everybody what's in agreement there was four Messengers carrying him Hallelujah for messengers of death took the church for messengers of Life restore it and here is five standing there f-a-i-t-h-g-r-a-c-e faith and Grace and he saw their faith what was it speaking of when everything yes is in harmony from the inside are you hearing me I want to make sure that drops from the inside out you know the reason he didn't have legs to get there are you hearing me now he didn't have legs to get there he didn't have the arms to carry himself but Faith was present to put legs in motion to put arms in motion where did that Faith come from Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God we're not here to be entertained we're not here to be entertained we're here the preaching of the Gospel the bread makes it very very very plain the preaching of the Gospel the Reason God has sent the ministering gifts is so that he can get in it and he can raise the faith of the people it's not the minister raising your faith that's raising our faith he uses the foolishness of preaching but it's God that's doing it when he saw their faith he said thy sins be forgiven me to the to the man on the come thy sins be forgiven now you know what a disturbance that was because there was some setting there that only the only intentions they were there for is for a show they were only there and that like think of this they were taking up space in the house that Believers would have gladly occupied right but you see what the word was also going to be a judge against him yes God doesn't desire to do that but you see if you don't receive it recognize it and accept it it'll judge you nobody sitting right here will have an excuse we are without an excuse thy sins be forgiven thee and they begin to reason in themselves who is this guy blasphemy you see that you see the Trap of tradition and Dogma and Creeds you see how horrible that is yeah I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't have been rejoicing I don't mean maybe they weren't even standing up but who wouldn't have been rejoicing but you see showing that he is the almighty God and they begin to question who can forgive sins but God hello hello and what does Jesus say he said which is easier for a man to forgive sins or to tell this man arise take up thy bed and go that's a question Jesus didn't even pause after that that you may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins I say arise take up thy bed and walk what was it his sins were already forgiven that was in an invisible realm nobody could see that but Jesus said that you might know what has taken place in an invisible realm it will become visible that's the power of the world [Music] it helps Mastery in our life to dismantle the hold of sin to dismantle disease to dismantle iniquity and what does it do the Mastery of the word amen amen has Mastery over it to dismiss it if thou believest [Music] then what will happen it becomes reflected in our walk the sins I used to do I do them no more the sins I used to do I do them no more why because the things that you were bound upon now now you're carrying it you're ruling over it what was once your master now you are over it [Music] in the word of God let me just have just a couple more minutes just to tie this point up here because this should be a question this is where I want to bring you to all these situ all of these examples these are just a few of the examples with the Lord was pressing on my heart but I want to bring us to this place here do you realize the scripture says he even came into Nazareth and other places and the Bible says he could do nothing because of their unbelief think of this the power of the word the Mastery of the word here he was but he could do nothing because of their unbelief so unbelief hinders God from moving now let me just say this to you his faith is greater than your unbelief are you hearing me now because his faith will stay right there at your life and keep reminding you Who You Are reminding you of what belongs to you let me just say this to you we just don't want to have a reminder anybody ever had to put reminders on your phones yeah I even had a reminder on here about brother Timothy Sean and I have to put reminders on my phones but you know what he goes to show you even when I had that reminder set up at a certain time to go off right before I walk out here and hopefully that'll stir my mind even of the best intentions are reminders it fails truth certain things I forgot to announce and I put a reminder on my phone announced this on Sunday and I have it set so that it would sometimes have go off right when I come and stand here hopefully if I'm up here at that particular time but see we just don't want reminders but God is reminding you and I he reminds us who we are he reminds what belongs to us amen unbelief it hinders him from moving in and doing what he wants to do and desires to do and Achieve and accomplish in our life what do I have to do we have to believe we have to surrender yeah let me just have just these few moments here the word that's being it's being spoken the word itself or think of it in this way how does the word come into our lives I'm just getting right down to a very practical basic things how does the word come into our life the mind accepts it right I'm quoting greatest battle of font I could take you a Litany of quotes spoken word's original seat on and on and on it's got to come and the spirit is what's controlling the mind and the mind has to accept the word of God now listen to me not your thoughts not your thoughts or my thoughts about the word because my thoughts and your thoughts would be skewed but we're talking about receiving his thoughts receiving the spirit of the word when we receive that and let the word come down into our life receive the spirit of the word then it'll put everything else in its place are you hearing me I could really I could just skim through this here real quick but I want to just in bringing this part of it he says I want you to think about brother Ram says this he said if this church could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere what's brother brown mean by one Accord well it means you know brother Joshua and I are thinking the same thing no I don't mean that one Accord means to be one in him one with his thoughts right we still have our own different preferences about things right in order for there to be Unity we have to we have to be burning to surrender our opinions many times so you're getting what I'm saying you see sometimes we're thinking that in that way but if everybody would be in one Accord one Accord with who one in one Accord with the Lord because let me tell you something if we're in one Accord with him it'll be no problem being one Accord with somebody else it'll be no problem because if I'm trying to get one Accord right here I'm working the wrong way are you hearing me now I gotta go why he's bringing him if I'm trying to get well come on Brothers me and you we we got to get in one Accord come on brother we all gotta we gotta that don't work that way one Accord is being in one Accord with him [Applause] that is welcoming the preeminence of the word amen yes Hallelujah because you'll never I don't just the congregation our science you're never going to get everybody to everybody's taking on the same page come on that ain't gonna happen that's foolishness to think that but where are we on a court is because we're not that my mind's like your mind no we are under his mind we have one desire and that's to see him [Applause] Hallelujah I'm Gonna Worship in church whether he sings my favorite song or not right I'm gonna sing my special even if it is on Thursday night instead of Sunday [Music] not one shadow of down anywhere you and I could sit down there can still be shadows of Doubt but if we're focused on him then all the needs everything that we have need of he is the one to meet every need I'm going to read this because I believe I believe I'm one of them I believe I'm speaking to people that believe this too if we're in one according not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there will not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed and that's where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will now let me preach just a few moments here he said this ain't Christian Science the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought in the channel of your thought it's not the thought as Christian Science says mind over matter no it's your mind that accepts it it grasped it so what's your mind control by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you and when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifested if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you he said what it's doing from the middle of the heart which is the soul there it goes forth feeding every Channel this is a key Point here the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that no let's listen you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside the thing that counts is the inside and he says that's also Satan's approach he said now you can say I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things that has nothing to do with it no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are those things are respected but Jesus said except the man be born again there's got to be something happen inside right thy sins be forgiven thee in The Invisible nobody else can see it that man knew it I'm saying that man knew it brother you it's a reality that strikes your life when you know my sins have been forgiven when you begin to say once it stretch your life you can say my sins have been forgiven what are you doing you are saying the same thing he has said [Music] Hallelujah don't wrestle with the word accept it there's got to be something happen inside if you don't that's an artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real he said there's only one Avenue that can come down and that's by the way a free moral agency come into your soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say this mountain move and don't die in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have it there's the Battlegrounds if you can only get started first Brian says I've been misunderstood about having about talking about Alder calls and when I said I wasn't much on one he said I never said I never said I was against him right right this they're drawing this out of Christianity versus idolatry brother Brown preachers the previous year you see it's me you can't you can't help that people misunderstood what he's trying to tell him this is that we're not working on people's emotions are you with me we're not working on their emotions we're not working on things to get them into a place no no no no no no the word the word comes to have Mastery Upon Our Lives is to encourage Us in the word of God the word is what's to bring conviction the word is what's to bring Liberty not working on a memory of you know your grandmother really loved the Lord your grandmother where they serve God or your dad I didn't really believe this message brother so and so ready no it ain't about that said that's the wrong Avenue it'll never work you're present what are you saying I'm saying it's about you and God it's about you and God it's about me and God hallelujah oh he said it's gonna come down that line of free moral agency you don't come he said because you're a good neighbor because you're a good woman you come because God calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word is what what means everything that word and if you can get everything out of the way if you can get everything out of the way believe us now this yay Lord I believe the Thou Art the son of the Living God that was to come in the world if you do take away the stone take away the stone right the same one that's to raise him up is also the same one giving you the authority remove the stone but Lord you don't know how long I've been behind this Stone take away the Stout you don't know how long ago take away the stone why because I'm here to bring forth what's in your life Hallelujah glory be to God he said you see if we can get all the consciences and and senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly but he said here we have it he said if you he said but if you receive it and you cover it over and you say well brother Branham these conscience and senses for and so forth they don't have nothing to do with the brother Branham he said certainly it does but if you'll let the word come in and cover it over with conscience it can't grow it'll be a deformed word it'd be like a plant he described a corn and you put like a rock or something my it'll grow out like this it's still growing but it's growing crooked what do you have to do get the hindrance removed get the hindrance removed get the conscience give them reasoning get all that let that be cleaned out it'll grow crooked he said we've lacked too many things Hinder the faith we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in us we've got too many things looking at somebody else let me just say this he's right here Among Us the desires that we have in him we need to look on him and we need to believe what the word says we are you understand me we need to believe what the word says we are who cares what so-and-so thinks they're not the king you don't know my mama your mama ain't the king the king but go not out of the presence of the king abide under his word because the Devil he's always going to try to point you to somebody's failure right oh I know somebody was like this and this is what happened and I know somebody you know what we ought to say God forgive us for talking about all the negative friends wrote look there's dead deer down this ditch line right here I don't talk about them dead deer there's times when I leave out of the office here you know what I talk about I talk about the leaves I'm not talking about me I ain't Lifting me up but I'm talking about in the spiritual you can't be looking at everybody else right you say what's going to happen whatever you look at you'll start walking towards it [Applause] come on Friends the church started looking at those that was going astray brother so and so since you're so and so this and this and that get your eyes off of people get your ass on Jesus Christ [Music] if there's going to be one by somebody make it I'm gonna be that one [Music] and I can't help nobody if I get my eyes off him I can't help nobody but if I keep my eyes on him those that are ordained will move right in line with the word of God [Applause] but if it comes from the true source of the word of God see when it comes from the true source of the word of God heavens and earth will pass away with my word and pass away let me tie this up here he said it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's gobbling flows through you see what's happening you have the Mastery of the word working in your life what's it doing well the greatest thing even as it starts working to bring conviction to our heart what it brought conviction and Drew us to him you know what it's doing it's mastering Our Lives cleans us up it's mastering Our Lives right right then he moves in by the new birth there's a death and there's a resurrection but is it mastery Mastery the word is mastering circumstances then as that word is in our life oh I love this it's mastering and molding our character to match his character he's mastering they're being changed from Glory unto Glory we're not Observers we are participants to receive that word into our lives receiving it when it comes to Healing receiving that word down into our lives but you're doing mastering the circumstances you have to understand circumstances can Master you but it is the word in you that we must let have the right of way to master us and the circumstances because when the word listen to me now when the word then the circumstance is conquered I need examples of that I've read you some but if you want me to give you the examples of situations when brother Branham was standing there on the platform and the maniac of uh that that that that that that that insane man came up on the platform what was it brother REM said I went I drew back a pose right used to be a boxer come on now sometimes we sometimes we're trying to handle problems in our life using the same techniques we've always done come on Friends the Holy Ghost did not put you in a glorified body that's right we're still trying to handle but I'll tell you what I'll get I'll get it brother Brandon said I got the thinking he said this man said got a family at home even begin to think he said I changed my thoughts oh God made a decision to change his thoughts what kind of thoughts did he think about oh this guy this guy wasn't such a blessed God In The Name of Jesus if he went no no no no he began to enter in why is he acting the way he's acting why is he responding the way he's responding you'll never get anywhere with anybody until you enter into their shoes never in relationships and anyway you have to be able to enter in who that's good this is free tonight you have to be willing to enter in yeah think about it when you know the story you know what happened there on the platform think about when he was there with with the bull right who was it that was mastered brother Brown when he came under the Mastery of the word then the circumstances around him he could say I take it I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God let me tell you something that just was not for and confined to 1965. that was God demonstrating through an adopted matured Son of God are you hearing me one minute come up from the field to let you and I see this same life this message produces Sons and Daughters of God that have dominion over sin flesh the devil and the world Hallelujah it's held up for you and I that's why this message is preached and held up because it's Jesus Christ it's what gives you confidence to face the circumstances that surrounds your life in your home on your job with your family on and on there's nothing as powerful as the word of God I say oh God let the word Master my emotions let him Master my thoughts I'm tired of doing things my own way and you know what getting the same old results you know what the definition of insanity is right doing the same old thing and expecting different results that's not mine that's Dr W himself that's insanity you can't keep doing the same thing and expect different results can I bring it down you can't just keep saying well I'm just going to come to church you've got to enter in amen you've got to enter into the word amen you've got to receive the word take it into your life sometimes I I I'm under a concern of when I look at things and I noticed there should be a continual moving up closer to the Lord Jesus not a oh yeah wait I was born again now let me see um I was born again so and so back and forth and I'm Rapture Ready and no joy in your life really I'm Rapture Ready no joy well listen there's a way to get joy back in your life just because Joy's departed don't mean that the Lord's Departed right how do I get joy how do I get joy back David said restore unto me the joy of thou salvation David knew it's repentance and then with hyssop applying that into my life are you hearing me yeah oh brother Sammy I've been delivered out of the Roman Catholicism for years well why are you still carrying the cross and beating yourself on the back why are you still doing that why don't you take God at his word it don't make you no more holy no more self-righteous take God at his word hallelujah oh my God you see how powerful sometimes our thoughts even when we've been set free by the grace of God we have to be liberated from our Traditions many times we still pack traditions oh but glory be to God there is a word to master thank you [Applause] Hallelujah it's your mind brother Brown says you're mine I am closing I said that I said ask you give me a few minutes and here it's been you could say I'm used to it thank you and close my Bible and I know you say it means nothing selections sometimes I think what we're doing is and I I'm not saying this to scold anybody you understand me I've asked God to just really help me with these things I've been really he's been putting them on pressing on my heart for weeks sometimes remember remember we were looking at some weeks ago Satan's desire is to corrupt us from the simplicity of the Gospel he wants to make it complicated you know how he does that wanting to point out failures point out this point out why we're not worthy let me tell you something your acceptance of the word of God has nothing to do with your worthiness are you hearing me or if I can just make myself when I make myself worthy your leopard spots will stick out bigger because you can't make yourself worthy are you under hearing me it ain't you that can do it well I got to get worthy before I can come to church it ain't getting worthy before I come to church it's the word of God that sets you free if you can receive the word it'll loosen it'll Master every circumstance he'll overthrow every Hound of hell That's The Power of this word Hallelujah if the Serpent's been after you get back in the word because this word is authority to bind Satan he's Bound in the name of Jesus Christ you can just just accept that word it's liberty for you fear to master your doubt master your confusion master your unbelief I lose when I do open up open up and close yourself off to all your conscience you know how many times I've tried take it out failed this minute kick it out you're saying what are you doing I'll tell you what you're doing you're acting like your father because when Satan rose up in heaven Jesus never asked him would you leave he cast him out amen that's why Paul said cast down every imagination steam out let the word of God just come and penetrate let the word just move right down let me tell you this word has power it's powerful you receive it into your life it goes to work for healing in your body receive it it'll go to work it'll

[Applause] you believe that let's act upon the word listen Faith Moves In Action with the word when Jesus saw their faith then he said thy sins be forgiven what was it Faith was working it was moving throughout every part yet the man was still on the cot but Faith was working I'm going to get in there somehow he's here and I'm going to get to him he is all that I need let's power hands Lord Jesus oh God greatest Lord the simplest thing that we can do is to take you at your word is Lord to recognize and to receive then Lord it releases the power that's in that word to do what it is that you have spoken now Lord I pray across this congregation there are many many different needs right here this morning Lord no matter where we are are setting at spiritually we are needy Lord and you know just exactly Lord Where We Are and we know where we're at Lord I pray that God that you just Lord even now that word Lord may we just Lord receive it just take it into our life just accept it not

Mary be it unto me according to Thy Word oh God and just welcome the word to ride into their life and Power for the Lord you're the one who takes chaos and darkness and Lord transforms it into the order of the word it's you that brings leadership and order in our lives lord it's not us that can fix every situation Sons and Daughters of God Lord are under the authority of the word that the word might go to work in our lives help us Lord may we lord not underestimate one one word of God for he is the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord we are made Lord to believe every word of God for we are a part of that word I pray that God even right now Lord that you would draw near to every heart Lord hearts that Lord that are praying Lord for your will and for your leadership I'm asking God that is your presence withdrawn near to them Lord that father there would be o God even in their heart and their life would Break Forth Lord a vision of the word that they would see Lord Victory Lord they would

God I pray right here this morning Lord we surrender Lord in your presence we see our inabilities we see our weaknesses but we're not going to make excuses we surrender them we surrender Lord to you

the beginning in this service Lord it's your presence Lord that's what makes the meeting Lord that's what Lord builds strength faith encouragement in our hearts the Wonders our heads our hearts are bowed in his presence I know we don't want to be observers I don't want to be Observer I know you don't but I'll say this if you know your life is not where it needs to be there's one way quickly to loosen that that's to repent that's to get things right back on track with God is so brother Samuel repentance is a very simple thing it is but it's it's what God leads us to the goodness of God leads us to repentance to recognize who's here in our midst even isn't as even as it was spoken he's been saying that throughout the service it's him and it's not just man that's saying it you know there's one here that's more than a man that knows your situation there's one who's called out even the thoughts of your heart because the word is right here with us it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart more powerful sharper than any two-edged sword it's alive why don't you let him cut from you all that unbelief why don't you let him cut from you all the doubt why don't you just welcome him in why don't you just let go and let God do it and let's just lay down every bit of Pride how long I've known the message or I've known this and I know no no where is your life where is your life with God because it takes your life the whole purpose of this message is that your life would be transformed by the quickening power to match the word of God and I say what Grace has come to us and what a day this is what a day this is what a light this is never been a light that shines so bright as this light and right now you've been encouraged take away the stone I encourage you take away the stone roll it away thoughts ways rolling away let the Holy Spirit let him just move and strengthen you that even here in this moment that you can walk from not just this place but walk from where you're at and you'll never be the same many things there could be things heard it's not just this isn't just a message of the new birth there is lives that need the new birth that's true but there's also lives that need healing need Deliverance hearts that need to be touched it still carrying hurt wounds complexes all those are stones but will you take away the stone will you remove it let the word go to work in mastery let it master that circumstance in your life I say right here this morning this altar is open I know God God met you there he can meet you right there in your seat too but I want you to be obedient to the Lord because we just don't want to recognize him we need to receive him we need to receive him to in many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God we want to receive it Samuel what should I do I would lay aside my doubts lay aside all and believe cast every thought down all the failure every mistake cast it down because it's of no value but take the word of God that is of Eternal value and let the word lift you let it exalt your life above sin above doubt let it come let it move in such a special way Hallelujah saying something brother Brian lead us please something softly Hallelujah amen Hallelujah if you want prayer we would love to pray with you but I want you to remember when you come it's not my prayer alone
