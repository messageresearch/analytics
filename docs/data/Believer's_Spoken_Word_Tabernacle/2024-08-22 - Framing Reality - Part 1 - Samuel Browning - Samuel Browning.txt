in our hearts amen we see certainly the day and the hour we're living in but you know and it says in the scripture when you begin to see all these things you know how could you put it in a list how could you describe the insanity you see that's right how could you put it in a list but when you begin to see all these things simple lift up your head for your Redemption draweth not oh my and you know I tell you I'm so thankful that what God has done in our lives is the same thing that he's taking this Earth through that whole process because the Earth is a redeemable attribute of God it had its call to repentance in the days of Noah was baptized God baptized it with water is that right then the blood dropped upon it from Calvary and Sanctified it and then then will come the fire atomic fire still under sanctification and will just cleanse and the bride will walk out in that Millennium Reign then after the Millennium reain then comes down the future home there's the the fire of God has taking place and then it becomes then a complete now thewell dwelling place for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and you know what your life and my life with the Seal of God is a testimony that this Earth is coming back to its original ownership that's right yes sir amen it all started in in the life of the Lord Jesus and now it's coming through a many membered body that's part of that new creation oh my oh my don't you love him amen so good to be here in his presence amen could we just go to the Lord in word of prayer Heavenly Father how we thank you Lord this evening for your grace thank you for your mercy once again among us Lord and thank you Father oh God to be able to walk out Lord in an atmosphere Lord such as this Lord and we just ask that God that you would take us higher Lord I pray that Lord as we have lay aside all the thoughts of of the day and Lord may you just give Grace to every one of us Lord to lay all of those things questions Lord to lay them Lord before you and may you now move Lord I pray upon the needs in our lives Lord we could thank on questions and think on situations Lord day in and day out but father we know just even in a moment in your presence where things Lord take place Lord spiritually you can give us the direction we need in our our natural lives Lord father you're mindful of all things Lord we're thankful Lord in this hour God for your grace Lord we just love you Lord Jesus we ask that you would just Lord take control Lord and Lord God let my mouth Lord only be given Lord to what it is that you want said Lord I pray May our hearts Lord just being in tune Lord for these moments Lord help us Lord we pray in Jesus name amen amen if you'll turn with me to job 23 uh I want to make announcement that uh we want to here on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. uh we have the uh funeral service for um be sister Irma and uh sister Carmen uh their father and as well as his brother Carlos's father-in-law and so um they had asked if if I would do the service and so uh we're going to have it here uh it won't it won't be a viewing or anything like that of the body it'll just be a service that we will have here and so we want to continue to keep them in prayer as well as a family uh through this time that the Lord would continue to strengthen them as well as that the Lord would just continue to move and and to deal with hearts as well and we're so thankful to know that we do have a comforter amen and I I still never I tell you since the time when my when my dad had passed away you know many times I had entered in you know you enter in to pray for others who's lost and you can feel it there are many that have went on from the assembly right here that my it just so it gripped me and would touch me in such a way uh but I never forget the part that when my dad when the Lord had taken my dad and I you know you just I was in complete shock I was just numb and uh but I never forget it was a few mornings two or three about three or four mornings later I remember when I woke up that morning and when I woke up it was a release and I looked over and I touched my wife I said honey I said this is the prayers of the Saints and I never forget that it was so Supernatural of that and so every time now when you know you have experienced that in someone that has experienced the loss that's how I pray Lord do for them what you did for me Lord and you know it just it allows you to be able to pray in that manner You' you've been through those things and I know many of you have already been there and uh but we just want to pray and enter in on their behalf as well also um this coming weekend uh Lord willing we my wife and I we will be gone we have a a marriage banquet to minister at and then on a Sunday service brother Boaz Romero he'll be here on that on this Sunday to stand in for us it's kind of hard to get not that brother Boaz the second but uh it's kind of hard to get brother Steven now that he's pastoring so brother Steven had talked to me on the phone and you know uh he said Brother Sam I still would like to come you know to minister I said hey you're always welcome but I understand you got to get settled in the saddle but you know you just let me know and uh but we so have appreciated brother step being here and you know the ministry that God has allowed us to to bring in and to and it's been a blessing to our lives and I'm so thankful for for that amen so let's look here and I know i' we've read from this and I believe we're coming to the to the end here of the job 23 um so I want to read a few scriptures then we'll just let you be seated in job 23:1 it says then job answered and said even today is my complaint bitter and my stroke is heavier than my groaning all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat and I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments now he wasn't talking about being contention contentious but job's know knows where he's standing with God I there's nothing that I've that's kept back there's nothing that he hasn't asked me to do that I haven't done but job's asking and I wanted you to catch that in verse three when he says oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat and I want you just to take a hold of that verse tonight to see that in theid midst of even the tests and the trials there is an immovable desire in his heart for the Living God Amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word that's good in verse 5 job said I know the words which he would answer me in other words I I would understand and understand what he would say to me if I can just get in his presence that's where understanding will come remember even there was one who was the lead musician in David's time ASF and ASF remember he watched a lot of things taking place how the wicked would Prosper the Bible says even when he got his eyes on looking at the wicked and how they're prospering and and asf's testimony is my foot had almost slipped because he got the looking at the wrong thing but he says when I came into the house of God then I understood the end of the wicked so you know there's nothing like being in God's presence you know there's a lot of things we're understanding that's where understanding comes is you know it's times when we're in prayer times when we're in meditation even when maybe you're in the most obscure moment maybe you're right on the job you're just thinking upon the Lord or maybe you're doing your your daily activities or you come or you're in the house of God and that understanding strikes but you know just when you come into His presence there's understanding that comes to our life and a strength and job says in verse six will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me you see job knows him he he he's not going to he's not going to destroy me but he would give he would put strength in my life and you know the prophet would take this scripture over and over and and point us to this reality that as we come to the end of the trial we are actually strengthened and made more stronger amen and he goes on to talk about there the righteous might be dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge and in verse 10 if I can just skip to that he says behold he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept that's observed and and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food now verse 16 job said for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me remember Satan is making job think right that it's his God that's doing this to him but it isn't God doing it it's God permitting it is that right Satan's doing it and the prophet tells us in three kinds of Believers I think it's very key that in that message that the prophet would make that statement and he says as long as Jo as Satan could make job believe that he had him whipped but I want you to notice this right here he was still a Believer you cannot separate a Believer from his God you might get him confused in his mind you might trouble him in his Spirit but when that Soul has had fellowship with God Amen that's it so these are where testimonies that you find that even in the midst of all that is taking place and even the accusations where Satan is coming and job is thinking that it's God doing it yet you could not touch or tamper that desire because that desire is not Earthly that desire Came From Heaven it was deposited in his life I could read many scriptures more where job talks about my my tears I poured out before God his desire was unmovable I want you to capture that here in verse 17 he said because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face he's talking about death and to see death and destruction all around me and so I want to just look at a thought beginning here tonight um because what I can see is I have just a couple parts on it but I want to deal with a thought on framing reality framing reality because sometimes realities of things and how things really are can seem like it wants to somehow Escape us but you know God has a way to frame reality and put it into to perspective there's one who knows our thoughts he knows he knows even the decisions that we have before us the Bible says and we Are Witnesses of this out of Hebrews 412 that the word of God is alive it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I'm grateful for that because even the things that we're contemplating or thinking on or even reasonings or imaginations or things that we can have even in our mind I'm thankful that the word of God comes write down and is there to discern and actually frame what's really the truth and so where job is at within this he's standing and of many scriptures we could uh pull from on this right here he's standing there's an unmovable Faith that's there within his soul but yet in the midst of it this is what I want to hone in on in the midst of it his weariness and tiredness in his body and his spirit is where Satan is beginning to Buffet him in his thinking you see Satan has assailed against him but yet you can't he couldn't turn job from from that rock solid confession he had remember job had a grip on God by divine revelation divine revelation of knowing god in a personal way does not mean that we understand everything that's going on it doesn't mean that fears and doubts and things cannot come in our mind no it only means there's an anchor that even when the waves come there's an anchor that holds us from within the veil hallelujah hallelujah so it all comes back down to the glory belongs to God Amen he is my anchor he's the one that is holding me and that's why Paul could write and say for I am persuaded that neither height nor depth nor life and nor Darkness nor things present nor things to come nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God out of Romans 8 what a declaration very familiar scripture to us but there's a there's a Resolute notice all of these things can come around but there's I'm persuaded nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God he didn't say I'm persuaded that nothing will happen around me I'm not I'm I'm not persuaded that I'm going to do everything exactly right and hit everything right on the mark and cross every tea and Dot every eye but I'm persuaded that in the midst of everything that comes that it's unable to be separated from the love of God and this is why Paul could even speak of the suffering that he was dealing with because of preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and you know we're witness of this when you are making a stand and you're you're walking for the Lord the Bible says that you know many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth out of them all any that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution and Paul Paul throughout his whole Ministry you find this and you find uh throughout every life of of every believer yet that within everything Paul could say though all of these things I've suffered I'm not ashamed right I'm not ashamed I'm not turning back I'm persuaded yeah I I'm Resolute in whom I have believed I'm persuaded he's able not that I'm able He's Able amen hallelujah to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day amen so this weariness that tiredness and you know that can come around within our mind when you you go through a time of t testing and trying Even in our lives sometimes just through the busyness and and just through the toils and and tormos of life we have seasons of life where it seems like there's not enough hours in the day it seems like there's not enough time around us and we're we're looking and then on top of that there's this situation you have to tend to and and then there's this situation and that's just simply summed up in one word life and here we are one walking in this life we experience Joys we experience disappointments and yet within it here as we're walking and through tests and trials it can come to a spot to where that in our very spirit in our mind in our body we're wearied we're weak we're depleted you you know anytime you ever go through something I think many times that to me is you know when I've had to set maybe within a hospital with my wife or or someone or whatever more sometimes even just that part part of being there and you're you know here you are you're in prayer you're on the edge of your seat or whatever and you can come out of all that and you're even a great deal more tired than if you physically had labored because mentally mentally and the strains and the tensions that that come and pressure is all around us and you know what just because that we here are a part of what God is doing in this end time and have received the Seal of the Living God we're not exempt from feeling pressure and let me just say this to you we're not exempt from responding in the wrong way the prophet laid it out he said there's pressure here pressure there he said right here Christians ref they feel it and all of us act out he said we get under pressure he says it's everywhere but there's a place where we can let off the pressure doesn't mean we're not going to feel it we'll feel it but there's a place where we can go to am and this is where when I think of this with the weariness of where that job was at there was an there was a a immovable desire that was unable to be moved and I want you to catch that and this is what I want you to lock on that desire that was unmovable is that very type in the life of a Believer when they have been sealed by the Holy Spirit there is a desire for the Living God that pulsates above everything it's a desire that even when I don't understand what's taking place but my love for him I can be disappointed in myself I have been and no doubt if God carries I will be but I've never been disappointed in God I might not certain directions that are taken it may not make any sense to me whatsoever there's been many things the way God has taken the course of many things that I would have never ever looked at it in that way or thought that Avenue was going to be taken but you know what God was do working on one person and maybe working on others but God was letting Samuel know I'm the one who's leading and I'm going to make it known that it's me and me alone that this is not something that you have figured out some bridge that you have crossed but I'm the one that's leading and in order for me to do that you've got to trust me completely don't lean on the arm of Flesh don't lean on Pharaoh's chariots let me bring Pharaoh's chariots our reasoning our imaginations the ways that we've always gone I don't want to lean on the arm of Flesh I want to lean on that Everlasting arm here was Elijah a man used a great man that had been used of God As a matter of fact God would use that Spirit five times in the scripture and here was Elijah after a a momentous day that had taken place on Mount Carmel everything that Elijah had done he had the Bible said according to Thy word oh Lord even the timing and waiting and after everything had taken place on Mount Carmel God had shown up in a mighty way it had been such a such a wonderful moment the prophet called it like this a red letter day how many of you had red letter days I like red letter days I do I you know I'd say well brother Samy you ought to like the black ones as well just as much well look I you know I like I don't I like red letter days black letter days are necessary for red letter days to come but I really like red letter days but if every day was a red letter day I probably wouldn't appreciate him very much but you know it's after them red letter days is where Satan wants to try to come because you see what in order for something to become a red letter day it's where you have given yourself completely to God where God has spoke to our life you know God it's things that that we our lives God has dealt with us like Elijah said I've done all of this according to thaty word it's when God can completely get us under his control and you know how it is when you're waiting on an answer or you're praying and you're seeking after the Lord and all of those things when when for a believer that means more than anything I want his leading and and you're doing everything you're getting into the word you're praying and you know you're reading in the Bible you're you're staying in that place knowing that I need for God to lead me and speak me speak to me I I want to be sensitive so where just the slightest little nudge I'll catch it and then you know after that nudge has come when the leadership has come and then after the event has taken place then our physical bodies are the ones that experience where we've kept it in a place of waiting on the Supernatural are you with me let me just bring it down to you every one of us have been in a meeting you know here we when we have special meetings here you go to meetings you know elsewhere and it's a it's the reason it's called a special meeting is because it's special it's a time of of of coming together and a time of Revival it's a time of refreshment it's intended to be that way it's a time for our faith to be built and s to be rekindled God has it that way for a purpose but you'll notice that every time when you can come out of something like that my this is exactly where the enemy wants to hit right after that you know why because our physical body our mind and our spirit have been worn that's good point I know we experiened these things even just from daytoday life I know we experien these things but I want you to understand and looking at this here tonight may God help me to just get out of the way that just to be able to speak this this thought that he laid on my heart there and that is when Elijah come to this place he he runs when Jezebel says I'm going to kill you this is a man that had faith now let's just step back for a minute and you see now a man running behind bushes and running for his life and telling Gesa you stay here at BBA I'm going on this was a man that just said I just got to get along and what's he running from he's running from the thre the threat of Jezebel she said I'm going to kill you this is the man who has just seen the mighty hand of God hallelujah and you say how could he take off and run like that the prophet tells us in the seven seal he says what it is he said it's that when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ that drops down Hallelujah but he said when that pulls back he said then Elijah in his natural way of thinking did not know how to think so he took off running now we can shame Elijah all we want but if there's a fire in your house guarantee you're going to run out if you don't something's wrong with you right if you know there's something bad wrong in a situation and you see something say hey something don't look right what's going on in this store or out in the parking lot you're foolish to walk on in there right is that right so we we have a certain part that's about us and Elijah he takes off running why why when he comes to such a place he's tired he's weary he's worn his nerves the prophet said are on edge he's been used of God and now he's in a place to where he's asking God like job just take my life I ain't no better than none of my fathers just take my life I want to I want to go on I want to just I I I don't want to I don't want to stay here he's he's feeling after such an event and his testimony is now this is what he believes to be the truth because let me say this Elijah in that service he did not see an altar filled he did not see he saw the miracle of the fire come down but he did not see anything as far as out of the rest of the people yes there were those who would take that that direction to take these prophets of B and slay them but yet he did not see anything that would make him think that he wasn't the only one but his statement to God when God asks what are you doing here he said because he goes into this I'm jealous for the Lord I've done this and this is what they've done they've thrown down thy altars and all of this rebellion and all that's been done well God knew all of that that's why God sent him with a message was to call them out of that are you hearing me God sent the message not to not to just not to bring judgment on them but to call out of those things where they were halted between two opinions God sent a message with a certain sound to bring a courage Hallelujah for hearts to stand out but he didn't see the 7,000 but God saw the 7,000 what he thought was reality I'm the only one I'm the only one I I won't ask you but it's not fun to feel like you're all alone sometimes you're in the midst of a trial or a test or a situation and sometimes you can look and you can look around it seems like everybody else is Happy everybody else is full of joy and you feel all alone let me just tell you something you're not alone your feelings yes there are feelings that are there but God has a way of coming down and framing reality for what it really is he tells he tells Elijah I've got 7,000 that haven't bowed a knee to Bell hallu I've got 7,000 I I you didn't see them but what you became a channel you surrendered yourself to me and you became a channel and the fire of God came down through the word you don't see them but let me tell you something what was able to be achieved there has put a courage in their heart and they're standing for the truth he was encouraged but yet God had a way of ministering to the needs within his body he was you know John was the same way how many know this is you know here you have that same characteristic Same Spirit of Elijah John when he got into that prison he got his eye filmed over but I want you to catch his Eagle Eye he was still an eagle though your eye might get filmed over you're still an eagle there's a place that can bring you back to the vision and the sight that you once had and here when the Lord Jesus when he heard of what John had asked he never shamed John in the presence of his disciples because why he had sent John with that message the almighty God had sent John with that message to introduce them to the Messiah then a way would be made so he'd let him know this is what's needed show John what you have seen take it back to him and they communicated that to John and John that broke the film on John's eye you know where that film was at on his eye John thought things ought to be going differently out of the message forsaking all brother Brown takes that beatitude blessed are blessed is he that's not offended in me he said John was offended because he didn't see things happening the way he thought they ought to happen sometimes we can sit in the service and we can say well I think it ought to be this way or I think it ought to be this way and we miss what God is wanting to do for us individually am we can get we get and you see that's a trap of the enemy our minds if we we're not careful when we come in here and listen we don't want our minds let loose we want to be focused and say Lord I want to be zeroed in upon what it is that you want to say to me Lord I want to be attended because when we come into this place it's a very peaceful place but let me remind you all the way through the scriptures even when God had called together the summons there and the sons of God were summoned remember Satan came in that congregation as well Satan is permitted to come evil spirits are committed to are permitted to come evil spirits are not out there they're in here to try to detract our minds that's what we've been ministering on with the greatest battle ever fought the prophet tells us even a little girl that's suffering with sickness he said Satan is trying to battle at your mind to keep your mind off the word of God he'll battle at your mind but we've come here with this sayith the Lord we've come here and gathered together as Believers this is not a time of rest it's a time of battle it's a time of War we got to fight to keep my mind right fight to keep my thoughts right oh my and God knows how to bring refreshment and strength to our minds he doesn't he didn't shame Elijah for getting and feeling the way that he needed to feel he didn't he didn't shame him so how could you feel this way look what You' done he didn't shame him he knew he was tired he needed a rest you know what God has a special ICU for those who need a real rest treatment God knows when we get overworked listen friend we're living in a day and age that as far as punches Satan punches constantly we're living in a time where you're in the battlefield and the battleground of the mind it's constant but I want to remember he took the crown of thorns for your mind battles Satan is always there to try to contest everything in every move of God but this is where with the scripture that Paul would write of how that be that for we want not to swow to our flesh cuz we'll reap that but we want to swow to the spirit we shall reap that of the spirit and notice that even within that in Galatians 6:9 Paul would write let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not now in another place in the scripture that I don't have up here Paul writes of this same portion of being not weary and well-doing and he's dealing with how that the church in thessalonica is to stand against people who are busy bodies instead of them working and beginning making a living so they can eat they're just mattering in everybody's Affairs and Paul's talking of how to keep that in check and the Very the statement he leads after this is be not weary and well-doing why because to standon listen to me now to stand for what's right and to stand for what's truth even though there's something within you that is standing standing in the midst of it but to stand right there and to yield your lives to yield your mortal bodies it depletes the very strength out of our bodies and out of our minds that is so true probably every one of us in here managers casew workers people who are supervisors parents maybe can look and say I'm tired of repeating myself I've told those guys that five times times every month the beginning of the month I have to say it I've had to say this over and over and finally you just say why you get weary at even standing for what's right doesn't mean you're a compromiser righten some of you smiling I know we pick plucking chords now it's true mom mom get tired of you know telling here uh you know kids to do this and do this and you know do this and do that and finally you know it just it gets to a time you can you go for so long and then through the cares and toils and pressures of life you get weary now listen when my soul my soul has never been wearied your Soul's never been weary but my spirit has been wearied my body has been wearied I'm not just talking about when we've been sick we felt that when we've been sick but even sometimes just the we in our minds and our spirits but I want to tell you you're not alone thank you I want you to think of this message I'm going to start right here the message perfect Faith right right and the prophet goes in to talk about his own life a little bit right he says I get spells too I get moody I get to a spot he said what gets me is when where I get to those spells when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world now notice what gets me is when I get all overworked he's talking about this body and in his Spirit not talking about his soul but what gets me when I get overw work then Satan you know you see Satan is an opportunist he's a buzzard he's a vulture he's an opportunist that anywhere he can find a place to sleep to slip in listen when did he come and tempt the Lord Jesus not when he was at his strongest weakest 40 days of fasting come on just came right out of a red letter day the heaven had open Dove descended down this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased led up into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil but it wasn't until after 40 days when he was at his weakest moment amen true and then Satan said get the Bell please I'm ready to go but the Lord Jesus showed you and I listen he did this for you and I so that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest not just somebody who knows it but has experienced it when we are at our Wit's End when our weariness and the tiredness of our body through the perplexities of life but yet a Believer is a Believer at all times and the weakest of Christians the weakest of Christians is still more than enough and match for the enemy because we're not standing on our own we're standing on his word we may not even have the strength to frame the words exactly or muster them out but there is a voice behind our voice and Satan must respect that because that voice is the voice of the blood it's the voice of the word it's the voice of Jesus [Applause] [Music] Christ brother Rand when does he when does Satan seem like he's coming at when I get overworked remember I love this remember same quote I'm not immune to to to the Temptation I got to overcome that it a that ain't going to ever come overcoming don't mean that you don't have to over that well once I've overcome it it'll never come again no Satan he just he continued to come but you've got to overcome it you see that's real overcoming too you might say well I'll tell you what I I I'll be out there to walk walk on the water listen it's real overcoming in your life as a Believer to walk above those Temptations right and say I I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded He's Able notice I got to overcome that then when I look back and I see something like this what is he talking about where Satan has said you don't got a friend in the world and he brother B is just said in the beginning that quote I see many of you that's traveled a long distance you stayed over for the Sunday night service and he's he's just talking about that and now when Satan has said you don't got a friend in the world watch what the prophet does he said when I look back and see something like this I put it right back in his face and I say what about that no don't run in the corner what about that come back here unpack your tail from between your legs I want you to look at this somebody sends you a text that says I'm praying for you you call that devil out of the corner and say what about this devil nobody loves me nobody cares about me no no don't you run away what about this what are you doing framing reality here's the Lord Jesus in the back of the boat What a Mighty service they've just had Miracles that's been done many that were healed of unclean spirits my red letter day but here he is laying in the back of the boat the prophet says in Rising gyrus his daughter he said how the devil of the sea sworn they drowned him while he was laying back there tired he said you know the devil takes advantage of you when you get tired or worn out he does you the same way you just get a little tired and wore out and get discouraged he caught Jesus right at that weak spot got tired and weary he was laying back in the back of the boat rocking around and the disciples came don't you care that we perish I don't know about you but sometimes there's things that where I know brothers and ministers they they'll get ready and they'll take a nap before they preach I I can't do that personally because sometimes those little things of naps I feel like probably some of you can relate to me those naps you can cut out of and I feel like I got swimmy head I feel like I can't even get thing my thoughts together it's like one of those times you don't feel like you could even talk at the dinner table now that's just me that may not be you that that's fine that ain't nothing spiritual that's just something I know about me right but I wonder when you and I have been tired and somebody comes to wake us and here's a serious matter sometimes it's a little hard to get awake right especially when his body remember God came down and became one of of us and so experienced what it was when the supernatural moving in this veil of humanity he experienced what it was like remember how brother Bram would tell us over and over through the message deep called to the Deep he would tell us even on that what you see there in Washington DC and he would tell us oh considering of how he said even Daniel and different ones he said when they would experience visions and how that Daniel said he was troubled in his head many days afterwards right because of the impact of how the Supernatural and what has moved down upon upon their life and then even considering the Lord Jesus where he would get tired and he would get worried and brother Bram said and he was the Virgin born son of God made in the likeness of sinful flesh like us but he experienced that weariness and that tiredness in his body now there's ways of how that the enemy when he will come you know I find over and over in the things when I go through and I study you'll find that when brother Bram will talk about nervous conditions and nervous things you'll talk about even sometimes of our sisters going through certain things and over and over you find a lot of times in the discernments of things of how that the enemy will attack during the evening time the prophet said I see you he said oh he says you get that weary feeling you get really weary in the evening time you get really tired around that time and he talking about a nervous condition that you know that what in order to kind of deal with that and maybe the season of life that they're in but what I'm saying is that how Satan will so attack in certain times why why wouldn't Satan let me ask you this why wouldn't Satan attack in the morning time you're rested right he giveth his beloved sleep for night owls he giveth his beloved sleep right now notice well but but the whole point is this is the rest and refreshment Even in our body but how Satan would come and he'll plan his attack for that weakest moment let me tell you something you and I both know there's times and situations that you and I don't have control over of where we're standing in certain times and situations and we know sometimes when maybe that our threads are a little bit thin that's a time that we need to say Lord I need more help now than I ever have Lord my threads are so thin I I I don't want the wrong character anything to be expressed Lord I want that of you Lord God breath me the coating on the threads give me the strength and fortitude I need to make it through this meeting through this moment through this interaction God give me what I need now notice how Satan will attack it's amazing how that he'll come and you know he'll work on certain ways like what he did with Elijah he told Elijah you're the only one he made him feel all alone after a great event had taken place and he's tired and his weary Satan can come with in so many different ways and tell us so many different things and you know what it can seem very real let me tell you what Elijah was experiencing he would have argued you face to face because he stood in the face of God and said I'm the only one now did anybody tell Elijah hey hey hey hey hey hey before you go in that cave I want you to know you're the only one he couldn't say that right but in his mind right that's what he thought and what he thought affected his actions so Satan knows just how to plant in your mind he knows how just all of a sudden he can plant a little seed plant a little doubt even while the word is coming forth he can want to try to plant a little seed of Doubt get you doubting and thinking and get you focusing in upon yourself why because God is ministering a word that would be fitting to our lives but he wants to distract us from what we need to be focusing on and he can get us so much there's times he could get us so far in the corner that we almost feel like I I don't know what's a use of even being here I tell you I how you feel so isolated you see any thought that ever comes from the enemy right is an isolating thought but what comes from God will always draw you in to the word see I want scripture for that when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you into all truth Jesus said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest the word of God the spirit of God draws you unto himself he reconciles us unto himself not excludes us not trying to exclude and get us over in a corner and then just start way laying on us so if you don't mind tonight I'd like to take a few moments and just whay on the devil in the message or the private interview was Sister Bruce and I think I've told you this as a church over the years this message when your private interview it's right before he preaches the Masterpiece this particular interview was not what sister Bruce called brother brandham called it because sister Bruce was one who had such an instrument brother brma actually when he's talking and praying for her he's saying I don't they said I've prayed and asked God not to take you cuz you're such a value to this church he repairs her life to like that of dorcus of old in the in the in the book of Acts and remember and here it was with sister Bruce she was actually the one going around to different ones and saying I wish I had what you had oh I wish I had what you had now she had I'll tell you the way sister Bruce was used and you know some insights of these testimonies that had been shared with me over the years it was actually a brother after I preached some certain things that actually got up before the congregation and told him afterwards do you realize who called this interview it wasn't brother brandom it was Sister it wasn't sister Bruce it was brother brandham brother brandham heard that she was going around saying that and so he called the interview I'm glad the word knows when to call an interview aren't you aren't you glad when our thoughts or our doubts or anything can be a certain way and the word just shows up and you're like how did he know that well well not a man knew that but God knew that and God called an interview and so sister Bruce you know she's seen so many miracles praying for people in the hospitals and people being healed and getting up God used her in a Wonder ful way but here she is still she's standing in this place and she says sister Georgie Bruce says brother brandom most of all I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart well it wasn't so important that it was revealed to brother bram's heart it's important that it's revealed to her heart you know even after what God does in your life it's got to be revealed to you what he's already done and you know what you can't you got to look at the right kind of evidence you got to look at the right evidence the word evidence oh he says I believe with all my heart you're a real Born Again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave now watch this when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person she says yes and you keep getting things on your mind little bitty things and it just keeps building up both both ways right it's like you go to the flea market buy a little bit buy a little bit more buy a little bit more buy a little bit more no sister Elia don't don't you spend a loud Amen on this one buy a little bit more buy a little bit more and for you know it the garage now listen to me stay with go back with me on this right here it starts brother Aron with just little bitty things he just say a little bitty little bitty and eventually little bitty things add up adds up notice you get somebody watch watch how watch how she's made up now you get somebody on your heart you want to pray for him you get up and you'll pray for him you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side Satan maybe will present something and out this way and you're a nature and God works and Satan works then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not you you keep building this and maybe this and this don't look at yourself yes sir that's a word from a Vindicated Prophet yes sir they might as well say private interview with Samuel browny private interview put your name on there private interview notice how she's made up notice the word is not going to come and just change how she's natured her temperament God's made her that way for a reason sometimes we we we we in our lives oh I I don't want to be this way I want to be that way I want to be oh I wish I could be like so and so we'll never be like so and so God don't want us like so and so he don't have two thumb prints that are exactly alike you say what is it that God's wanting he's wanting us to realize our humanity and our need for him to be in full control in our life David said I'm fearfully and wonderfully made and the prophet is going down through here the word is Discerning and letting her know this is how you're made up now as a daughter of God right this is how you take Dominion God puts people on your heart and it builds and builds till finally you said I'm going to the hospital to pray for him and he says now Satan sees how you're natured and he'll put something and keep putting something putting something and fin you're like I'm not even I'm not even sealed I'm I'm not even a believer I don't got the same experience that everybody else has I don't have this now you see what she's looking at she's looking in that time frame of other things that she's seeing and wanting and evidence that she's had an experience and the prophet La down in this interview takes her into a place this is normally how you would be you would love to do this cut your hair and do all these other things he said but you was like that but something changed what what was it that changed those desires she said Christ that that's your answer that's your answer right there see she had the answer the whole time it just was revealed in the presence of the word of God hallelujah so even how we're natured in a certain way brother B will pick this up in other places in the message of how that we can be natured a certain way and how that he says here we can have this depending on how a person is natured they can actually get something on their heart from the inside conscience that is actually been reborn by the spirit of God and know that it's absolutely scriptural it's what God wants me to do and he says on the outside conscience how they're made up the B the star they're born under the birth path he said Satan will come and stand on that outer conscience and begin to pound at them and pound at him and pound at him and try to get him away from that and he said what a times many times he said we give heed to that on the outer conscience let me just tell you this right here I don't know how many times that the enemy has wanted to sweep around on me and say you know what you need to you need Don't Preach this you you oh the people aren't going to get that oh you know what he'll come over here on the other oh that's so simple that's so shallow you don't need you say brother Samuel oh that that must all that must be so easy well I know who's talking to me but you know sometimes it's almost like you've got a you're waiting you're listening because constantly I'm looking for God what is your mind you know you've experienced it right here we're walking right out of that offense minutes before I walk out there's times where God will change things on me why he does it that way I don't know maybe it's because just to teach me and let me to see that he that my dependence is upon him doesn't mean that I won't come around and preach these other things in their season and their time but the battles that we have to go through you have to go through that's right I mean why you going to church tonight he's preaching on job 23 again we have been on job 23 how long but aren't you glad you came [Music] tonight oh brother Brandon picks it up when a person you know he goes to talk about evidences and he says it in question and answers part three he says I don't care how much you spoke in tongues how much you jumped and how much you did this or that or the other whatever you've done it wouldn't me a thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on the things that's right and wrong aren't you glad there's something on the inside that says uh-uh that ain't right you can try to override that but let me you cannot shake that uncomfortable feeling why it's the spirit of God that's bringing conviction in your heart oh my thank God for the anchor in our life and when we have overrun it guess what we're his children and he just takes the belt off yes sir I'm not going to do it cuz I may not get it back on we're still his children when every time I've got a weapon and I've got plenty of them I'm still his child and you know every time he's gave me a weapon it ain't because he's frustrated with me he just said look that's your target right down there the body change and that right there ain't going to cut it so we're going to line you up boy Hallelujah that's one real correction is he don't hate me he's lining me up boy you're off Target a little bit he lining me [Applause] up Sir aren't you glad you got something there that condemns you oh my brother Ram goes on to say see he said you know it's yourself talking about the change you know it's yourself it's an individual thing between you and God you know that Something's Happened you know there's a change whether anything else you yourself you're the change you're the one that's done the change inside of you and you know you have it whether you spoke with tongues whether you jumped shouted or anything else you know that God lives in you that you don't walk with your own mind it's the mind of Christ that leads you with that word just exactly the way it goes Hallelujah come on back I got more I got more let's just put his head in like one of them m nail presses yeah there you go in the message desperation preached the evening after he preached the token message in Jeffersonville that morning and spoke about the assurance that has come Among Us the token the necessity to have the token how God has so laid that burden on his heart that we must have that token for Rapture showing that the blood's been applied we can't even get on the highway unless we've got the token like I mean you couldn't even make it into secure security you could get into the security line at the airport but you're not going to get in and through that line without a ticket you got to have a ticket and when you got a ticket then you can pass through security that ticket will tell you your gate of departure right and that's what the token is that's what the Holy Ghost is it's your assurance I've got a spot reserved on that flight that's [Applause] right my place is reserved on that flight glory be to God now notice this when brother B has just brought the Assurance of this and he speaks to the people in the beginning of desperation just a little bit of counsel and he's talking with them of the assurance that has been brought our way by that token and what that means to have it applied that you have been accepted when the Holy Ghost has come upon you it shows you've been accepted and then he says this very statement in paragraph 18 of desper ation now he says Now not no certain evidence you say brother brandom he said I feel it in your minds why will I know or How Will I Know How will I know it's been a pride he said I feel it in your minds look what you were and what are you there is how you know what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's supplied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the token has been applied or not not no certain evidence what do I look at look at your desires look at what you were and look at what you [Applause] are glory be to God come on back here devil I got one more I got a lot more but I got one more after preaching it is the rising of the Sun that morning the prophet starts out does God change his mind about his word and he begins to just encourage the people about that message it is the rising of the sun I tell you what it was like one brother was we were talking and fellowshipping you know together and he was talking about where he had been over there and overseas ministering and and he began to quote the message of the rising of the sun he finally stopped in the middle of the quoting and he said look he just asked the brother he said don't interpret this have you ever listened to his the rising of the sun no well how in the world can you interpret for me you see what I'm saying that's a that's a key message it is the rising of the sun that's what it's a key message it's a message where the picture gets turned right Hallelujah I'm not just talking about that of that that cloud in Sabino that's one way where the Prophet said we got to turn it the right way but God turned the picture in you and me he turned it the right way so that you and I can see I was always a son and daughter of God we weren't looking at it right we were looking at it like if I can just be worthy if I can just get good enough if I can just do the right thing and God takes the word and says hey you're looking at it the wrong way let me turn it to the right woo it was on the right he pardoned the thief hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah where did that weariness go hallu hallu where did that weariness [Laughter] go oh my here it is does God change his mind about his word he just preach it's a rising of the sun he said now look he said I apologize for that long message this morning I don't feel bad I didn't want to wear out your patience and then come at it again tonight but I wanted to get that message to you that you are a part of this resurrection and don't worry about it no more just Rejoice over it there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it nothing eternally secured in the kingdom of God when God has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of the destination when the government puts a seal Upon A package the railroad puts a seal on the door and that car cannot be tampered with until it reaches its destination let me pause here for a moment the prophet says in an earlier message he said Satan can come and Buzz at that seal tease at that seal and want to just try to come at it but he cannot tamper with that [Applause] seal that is so good when God puts his seal upon a man and the seal is the holy spirit when he seals a man like that he is gone to his eternal destination never no more can he ever go back anymore cuz remember Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed for all time see you're sealed forever you're sealed eternally into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit now think of that I got some shouting shoes on right now now watch the devil will punch at you and he'll say everything to you and accuse you and try to make you think that you're not let's read the last part together but don't you listen to him right if he's been a liar once he's still a liar a liar is a liar is a liar now you know watch how me now how do I come back with this now you know you've passed from Death unto life you know the things that you once loved you don't love no more you know that you have believed every hallelu word of God what a reality to be framed with sir Psalms 273 I think I think this is phenomenal of how that this would be the scriptures and I'm only going to use two of them out of here but what would be used for the text of the Rapture though a host verse three should encamp against meall my heart shall not fear Body Spirit all fearful things can come through there but my heart shall not fear praise God I know in whom I have believed amen I know that I've met God's requirements I know the Grace has been given I'm able to look and see what I was before and what I am after oh Hallelujah though War should arise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple this is where my confidence is in what the desire that's in my heart because the desire that's in my life tells me who's on the control tower of my soul that's a direct quote Hallelujah two different control Towers there's a control tower for the flesh sometimes you know you get to a place like right now my mouth is a little dry it could use a drink but I'm not going to take one right now the body is letting me know hey hey hey you need to get a drink need to get a drink need to get a drink right the body calls for certain things hey it's cold you need to get a blanket I know some people live in blankets but it's cold you need to get a blanket right your body sends you signals and the prophet takes that same thing and then he'll flip it right around and he says your soul is also calling for Spiritual things that's so good see the desire that rises up within us get into the word Lord I I want to get in your presence Lord I I want to I want to move deeper Lord with you a desire this is what David this is his confidence David notice his confidence isn't that I've hit every tea I've dotted every I've done all this no no neither is he calvinist but he's a balanced man man he's looking at the desire in his heart he's looking at the desire in his life God has change the desires of my life David what is it everything is surrounding you how in the world are you going to face that enemy and here's how this is my confidence one thing I've desired to dwell in the house of the Lord I want to be wherever he's at I want to behold the beauty in his Temple I want to see his face I want to Behold Him I don't care about anything else all of that has faded away you love him the worshippers once purged has no more desire of sin it's gone right aren't you thankful for the mercy of God hallelujah let's stand maybe as they play something softly let me read this quote to you 1954 questions and answers how many remember them three little monkeys yeah make sure I get it right hear no evil see no evil speak no evil brother brand refers to them in this quote and he's referring back to that and he says now see just keep your mind pure and on Christ that's a job because there's a lot of filthy thoughts can go through our minds there's a lot of Filth there's a lot of junk there's a lot of things can go through our minds is that right and Friends listen don't just classify filthy some other way there can be accusations can go through our minds against a brother or against a sister that's not Purity can right God never legislates an accusation against a brother or sister that's right into our mind one of the quick ways that we know where that come from is look how it begins to change and affect our attitude that's good watch this I'm talking about framing reality now just keep your mind pure and on Christ now he said if you don't watch you'll get yourself into a place if if you keep thinking on that I said don't think on it and what's he telling them not to think on you can't live so perfect till you don't make that mistake now wow so you mean if I'm thinking my thinking is I'm going to live in such a way I'll never make a mistake or never make a mistake again you're not living in reality but the holy spirit is trying to frame reality for us right he said you can't live so perfect till you don't make that mistake now don't you think you'll ever get that way cuz you won't you're not sinless and you're certainly will get off their track and on this and on that but a man that's once knocked down how many he's been knocked down before probably could raise both my hands and and feet as well if he's a real Soldier he'll rise up again Am Lord let me rise and try again what is that desire desire but a coward as soon as he sees he he makes his first little mistake like I said this morning the bug and the water spider they'll crawl right back out into the water again he just can't stand it see that's something where you can see this with job though job's thinking is wrong but what you find there's a desire in his heart that is unch changing he wants to get before God I want to talk to him I don't know what's taking place but I know if I can just get in his presence I'll understand his words I I'll know I I I don't I don't know what's going on but I know if I could just get there and I know he won't come against me with his power but if I can just get in his presence he'll put strength in me and job over and over many more scriptures I could have rehearsed right through for you to show that desire that job had that in the midst of even accusations his desire was to get before God he said I'll maintain my ways a hypocrite will not be ex but be accepted he said he shall be my salvation look at that that desire that within the midst of it a test or trial could not knock that desire out of him once that desire every one of us listen I remember when I had a desire to serve God as a young boy 13 years old but I also remember then when that desire thank God where did that desire come from it come from from God's own mind but once it came to that appointed time God leading to that place and now he comes to Quicken and bring that desire to where that desire is no longer like a seed that's underneath darkness and Gloom and void but once that that quickening power comes what does it do it comes upon that seed and that seed has what's needed to respond to the transforming power and what does it do that old ruling nature that was there is Cast Away the desires of the world is cast away and that seed doesn't start out as a fully mature plant but it's been quickened and it begins to grow it begins to grow he teaches us we fall we get back up he works with us we we begin to learn certain things sometimes maybe certain Pathways we walk we keep falling and falling and falling finally he gives us and the grace we realize so Lord help me I'm tired of making this same mistake what is it how do I keep falling in that same way sometimes it isn't altogether that God strips something out of us as far as like takes our very temperament and says come here Aon let me just rearrange you no sometimes what God has to do is like what he did for sister Bruce this is how you're made up right and you need to understand it God works with you like this and then the enemy will work in so you're made like that you know what you know what he's saying brother Aaron he's letting sister Bruce know as a daughter of God you're in control you're in control discern when them spirits come when those those times times come but it's true like we started out tonight preaching this Veil man this Veil this Veil is the one my soul has never got tired but I'll be honest with you there's been sometimes where I get I just get tired there sometimes my eyes will get so weary and things from reading and look at sometimes we get tired I know how it is even in a service sometimes we can come out of a service or a meeting you think woo I don't know about you sometimes on a Sunday service we get done with a Sunday service and all of a sudden after eventually things start continuing to come down come down come down you [Music] realize I was in places where Mortals don't walk and that inside part here we were sitting in Heavenly places and these bodies then after we after everything comes back down these bodies oh my we feel the effects of it don't we sometimes you just don't feel it on Sunday afternoon sometimes you feel it on Monday feel it on Tuesday is that right come on whether you're a preacher or not you feel it when you really get into a service right that's true but aren't you glad that we have a resource we get weary God doesn't shame us if you're in a place of weariness maybe in weakness maybe feel down listen God's not going to shame you and I sure ain't going to shame you but I will say this God still has has angels with soft hands you still have Angels ah they can bake bread 10 times 100 times million times better than kadis some of you don't have that Revelation yet but God still has them you see God knows how to pamper us are you hearing me friends sometimes as we even look around the assembly sometimes we we don't understand sometimes it's almost like you know I think I just heard somebody say this a little bit ago comes to me I I just feel to say it right now cuz sometimes we don't even understand what you know sometimes I might look and I can see sister re I don't know what she's been through this week see brother Aaron sister Barb sister Rachel I don't know what they've been through this [Music] week but but somewhere I remember hearing the basketball coach from duke who was the basketball coach I

getting beat by 49 points You' be ready to send the scrubs in am I right or not right this is what he did then this is just a carnal natural example this is what he did he got them boys around he said

University you are already Champions so he said I'm here to remind you who you are you're a champion they broke that Circle they went out and won that game you see listen friends this is where we need the encouragement of one another brother Braham said it in the message thy house a little house meeting he said look he said I get moody I get down sometimes he said and I need you to understand me Hallelujah when I'm down and you're up and he said I'll tell you what I'll do when you're down and I'm up I'll understand you does understanding mean that I make sense of that doesn't mean that it means that you know what I know what it feels like to be down I know what it feels like to be weary I know what it feels like to that I feel like I've been punched on and beat on I know what it feels like to be weary with the things of life if there's one thing when somebody enters these doors they should never be met with scorn skepticism ridicule or condemnation if there is come tell me about it
