[39:27] in his presence can give release to us
[39:31] the answers that we

[39:36] God will do amen we just want to say
[39:40] Lord help me to Step Beyond this
[39:43] physical address amen and we've uh
[39:46] entered in and just to create an
[39:48] atmosphere for him to come you know an
[39:51] an atmosphere itself is more than just
[39:53] what we do with our hands or if the
[39:56] right notes are played on there but you
[40:00] know what creates an
[40:02] atmosphere is what we think
[40:06] on what we meditate on remember how God
[40:09] told he told Joshua meditate on those
[40:12] things you know why because it creates
[40:16] an
[40:17] atmosphere but to meditate on what on
[40:20] the
[40:21] word and it creates an atmosphere
[40:25] Hallelujah the Bible said draw nine to
[40:27] me and I'll draw nine to you and as we
[40:31] begin to think about him well then that
[40:33] that's where our clap comes from that's
[40:36] right that's where our shout comes
[40:38] from however it is that you worship him
[40:40] but it's it's based on what he is to
[40:46] you and so that is what creates the
[40:49] atmosphere in then that atmosphere is
[40:52] set and and you know what that
[40:53] atmosphere is it's because of the word
[40:57] that we have received in our life that
[40:59] has changed us just like it did in
[41:01] Genesis 1 and we think upon that word
[41:04] and I tell you what no matter what our
[41:06] troubles is cuz we come in here and we
[41:09] sit and sometimes we're
[41:11] discouraged it's true it's true we're
[41:15] we're not
[41:18] superhuman sometimes we are facing
[41:21] things decisions and everything else but
[41:23] you know we begin to think about what
[41:26] God has done for us
[41:29] because it's the word that is done for
[41:32] us in our lives no matter where you're
[41:35] standing at now even standing with
[41:37] potential in your life it's the word of
[41:40] God that has brought you to that place
[41:42] that's right
[41:43] amen and as we begin to think upon that
[41:46] word you know that's when
[41:49] Israel they came back into the land and
[41:53] my after the gates were
[41:55] erected NE Nehemiah they the Bible said
[41:59] they built a pull pit that's the first
[42:02] only time you ever hear that word
[42:03] mentioned a pull
[42:05] pit and Ezra and then begin to take the
[42:08] law and the Bible says they begin to
[42:11] give understanding to what was wrote in
[42:16] there and the word so touched their
[42:19] lives that they begin to weep you see
[42:22] notice the order the word itself even in
[42:25] the revealing of the word in this hour
[42:27] it brings repentance right it brings
[42:30] humility but then the word directs us
[42:33] and say wait a minute I I don't want you
[42:34] to live just there that's the beginning
[42:38] but then he came and said this is the
[42:40] time of
[42:41] Joy this is the time of the Feast of
[42:45] Tabernacles reminded we're in these
[42:47] temporary
[42:48] dwellings we're dwelling here in this
[42:50] temporary dwelling he said but this is
[42:53] the time for rejoicing
[42:57] and that scripture that we quote no
[42:59] doubt we've seen it on t-shirts bumper
[43:01] stickers we've quoted it so much but it
[43:03] didn't come out of the book of Psalms it
[43:05] came from that moment where they
[43:08] directed the hearts of the people to
[43:09] said the joy of the Lord that's right is
[43:13] our strength yes sir and you know what
[43:15] that Joy
[43:16] is is what he has already done for
[43:21] you he gives you a joy that the world
[43:24] cannot
[43:25] give and and no matter what you might
[43:28] feel like with tests and trials but it
[43:30] really it can't take it away when David
[43:33] said restore unto me the joy of thy
[43:34] salvation it was there it just needed
[43:36] God to bring it
[43:39] forth amen don't you love him this
[43:42] morning oh we we we we know we know
[43:45] where we're standing by God's grace amen
[43:48] we want to uh this morning as the
[43:50] Brothers prepare uh to come and I know
[43:53] it wasn't announced over and over but we
[43:56] may mention about that special offering
[43:58] toward the parking lot I know God bless
[44:00] you no doubt many have continued to just
[44:03] write on the envelopes and you can
[44:04] continue to do that uh throughout uh
[44:07] oncoming weeks and and so forth uh some
[44:10] of you maybe send it in through uh your
[44:12] bank and things like that um so we just
[44:17] wanted to do that today and the reason
[44:21] is I I was saying when we looked at the
[44:23] things that we have set up to do is and
[44:26] we continue to live lift up um offerings
[44:29] and continue to take that because
[44:31] anytime you get into something there's
[44:33] always extra costs and those are things
[44:36] we're also trying to offset and head off
[44:39] as we're going along as well and so um
[44:42] let's just we want as the brothers would
[44:45] come
[44:46] and and I apologize that it wasn't
[44:49] continually U announced here on a Sunday
[44:52] and um I'll take responsibility for that
[44:56] um that I should have probably put that
[44:58] as a reminder and continued to send that
[45:00] out and have the song leaders to do it
[45:02] and then if they would have forgot I'd
[45:04] have had somebody to
[45:06] blame but uh could we just let's just
[45:10] pray over it let's the brothers if
[45:12] you'll come and let's just pray I want
[45:14] to pray before we lift it because I want
[45:17] to thank God for what he's already done
[45:21] cuz I tell you it's already been
[45:24] Supernatural you hear me it's already
[45:25] been Supernatural
[45:28] amen Heavenly
[45:31] Father Lord we just come before you this
[45:35] morning and we want to say that we love
[45:38] you

[46:32] aside because we know that God within
[46:35] the word of God there is power there is
[46:38] transforming power Lord to take Lord
[46:41] situations to take Lord places rivers
[46:45] that are even thought to be uncrossable
[46:47] and that God you can move down in a
[46:49] moment's time and give us Lord a courage
[46:53] maybe not that we would see the water
[46:55] parted but you give us the courage
[46:57] to come right up to the Jordan like the
[46:59] priest did and then you who is the way
[47:04] maker will make a way Lord I pray for

[48:37] oncoming weeks Lord we we just Lord know
[48:40] that God that you're more than
[48:42] enough we ask these things Lord in the
[48:44] precious name of Jesus Christ
[48:47] amen
[48:50] amen amen
[48:57] and by all means if
[48:58] you even in oncoming weeks I know that's
[49:01] been put on the envelopes where you've
[49:04] just wrote on there and um then some
[49:08] some do it through their bank and things
[49:10] like that
[49:11] and um if you need a PIN for your
[49:14] checkbook I can run back to my office
[49:16] and get
[49:20] one amen
[49:22] amen well let's look in the word of the
[49:25] Lord I appreciate the musician
[49:27] and amen I as we turn to Ruth chapter
[49:33] 3 I I text Brother Boaz there the other
[49:37] day and I took a few days to kind of
[49:40] when I had little bits of time to go
[49:42] through the message and my what a what a
[49:45] masterpiece yes it was I really really
[49:48] really enjoyed that that service um and
[49:52] I would say he referred he was quoting
[49:56] um a lot of references in greatest
[49:59] battle ever fought but also in the
[50:00] message you as he was drawing from that
[50:03] thought on the remedy uh he carth do you
[50:07] care my brother Bram preaches that twice
[50:08] he preaches it in
[50:10] 1960 and then in 1963 he preaches it and
[50:14] it's under the burden of what is it that
[50:18] will rub out any make belief or unbelief
[50:21] or anything that causes wondering and
[50:24] the Holy Spirit directs him right back
[50:27] to that of that of a real true
[50:31] repentance and that's something so it's
[50:33] a message I say it like this that's a
[50:35] message it would be good to go back over
[50:37] and to listen to he cares do you care
[50:41] because to tell you the truth I like how
[50:42] the prophet says it in the message he
[50:44] says he died to make a way that you
[50:47] might care that's so good we wouldn't
[50:50] even be able to care had he not made a
[50:53] way that we could care oh
[50:57] my I I just love the message of the hour
[51:01] Amen in Ruth
[51:05] 3:1 then Naomi her mother-in-law said
[51:08] unto her my
[51:11] daughter shall I not seek rest for
[51:15] thee that it may be well with thee I
[51:19] I'll just let you be seated right there
[51:21] and we'll keep on reading because I've
[51:23] had you stand in a little bit
[51:27] shall I not seek rest for thee that it
[51:30] may be well with thee notice the purpose
[51:34] in verse two and now is not Boaz of our
[51:38] Kindred with whose maidens thou was
[51:42] behold he win with barley tonight in the
[51:45] threshing floor I want you to catch this
[51:48] now I pray the Holy Spirit would just
[51:50] help us as we look in upon these things
[51:53] the prophet even when he would start
[51:54] into the message Kinsmen Redeemer
[51:57] he would he would ask the Lord and speak
[51:59] to the people he says if we can just
[52:01] really catch and the Holy Spirit would
[52:03] really reveal to us what has taken place
[52:07] and what God has done for us and even in
[52:10] this hour that we're living in and he
[52:12] said oh what a glorious thing it is and
[52:14] I believe that with all my heart I I
[52:16] know what he's revealed thus far it's
[52:17] wonderful it's glorious and so Naomi
[52:21] knows exactly where where he's at that's
[52:23] important you got to know where he's at
[52:25] you got to know where he's at that in
[52:26] the season of his word verse three she
[52:29] says wash thyself therefore and anoint
[52:32] thee and put thy reignment upon thee and
[52:35] get thee down to the floor but make not
[52:38] thyself known unto the man until he
[52:41] shall have done eating and drinking and
[52:45] it shall be when he lith down that thou
[52:48] shalt Mark the place where he shall lie
[52:51] Thou shalt go in and uncover his feet
[52:53] and lay thee down and he will tell thee
[52:58] what Thou shalt do and she said unto her
[53:03] all that thou sayest unto me I will do
[53:08] verse six and she went down unto the
[53:10] floor and did according to all that her
[53:13] mother-in-law bade her I would like to
[53:16] just continue to take that thought where
[53:19] we started the other week on accepting
[53:22] the counsel of the Lord and we we can
[53:27] stand here this morning just like Peter
[53:30] could declare in First Peter that we
[53:33] have not followed cunningly devised
[53:38] fables these are not things that's been
[53:40] made up by by the heads of
[53:43] man God didn't need to send us a new
[53:46] Bible the message never came to replace
[53:49] the Bible but the message come to raise
[53:52] the Bible into the place that God
[53:55] ordained it to be that the word of God
[53:58] would be the absolute in our
[54:00] lives and so Naomi would be being a type
[54:05] of the Old Testament also the prophet
[54:08] would speak of it of how that uh being a
[54:11] type of the Holy Spirit had had sought
[54:14] out of what was needed for Ruth in order
[54:17] for her to find rest which would be
[54:20] Safety and Security and I want to say
[54:22] that to you that that's the objective
[54:25] when the Holy Spirit the word comes to
[54:27] our life it's to bring and seek out
[54:30] settledness for our life God is not in
[54:34] the business of causing
[54:36] confusion he's not in the business of
[54:39] unsettling uh Hearts he's in the
[54:41] business of bringing us to a place of
[54:44] settledness in his word because that's
[54:48] the only place that'll that's the only
[54:49] place that'll stand and that's a sure
[54:51] place where we can come to so here she
[54:54] is under Ruth is under the leading of
[54:56] the Holy Spirit and it the word of God
[54:58] is leading her right to the right place
[55:01] and the humility that that she has has
[55:04] walked with it it was a virtue remember
[55:07] she she had a a humility and a virtue
[55:09] that was already being known even from
[55:12] when she uh exited the land of of Moab
[55:16] with her mother-in-law and come back
[55:17] into the land and and and Boaz has been
[55:20] has been watching this all along as a
[55:22] matter of fact he he has seen it and
[55:25] witnessed it before he ever descended
[55:28] into the field and came to her he was
[55:31] identifying the character that what was
[55:35] what she was about and let me just say
[55:37] it like this God knew when he would send
[55:40] this word in the end time behold I send
[55:43] unto you uh Elijah the prophet before
[55:47] that great and terrible day of the Lord
[55:49] and and he spoke within that but
[55:51] remember that in itself there's three
[55:54] people in that verse there is Elijah the
[55:57] prophet there is also I God and there is
[56:00] also you and so there are three people
[56:03] that are involved in that verse and God
[56:05] knew that you and I would be here in
[56:08] this hour God knew when he descended in
[56:12] the field of his word in this hour when
[56:15] the coming of the holy spirit in his
[56:17] fullness to fulfill that word and to
[56:20] make that word live God knew that you
[56:23] would be here and God also knew that
[56:26] there would be a character in you and I
[56:29] that would rise and to meet that word
[56:32] and come under that word to be molded
[56:34] and shaped and be brought into a union
[56:37] and into Rapture God already knew that
[56:40] we are not living in things that are
[56:43] just a happen stance but everything has
[56:47] been foreordained and pre-arranged by
[56:50] almighty God you did not stumble into
[56:53] this field by chance you did not stumble
[56:55] into this revealed word of the hour but
[56:57] it is the holy spirit that has sought
[57:00] you out and guided you to this moment
[57:02] this is why the questions you had even
[57:05] in the churches you set or maybe you
[57:08] never even darkened the door of a church
[57:10] and there was something within you that
[57:12] was longing for reality that you could
[57:15] not put your finger on it and let me
[57:17] tell you what that was that was a part
[57:19] of God that was in your life and the
[57:22] Holy Spirit in the Fulfillment of his
[57:25] word in this hour begins to make that
[57:28] Creation in you to stir that up to draw
[57:32] you to
[57:35] himself I want you to notice this in the
[57:37] book of Exodus
[57:40] 33:12 and here Moses says unto the Lord
[57:43] thou sayest unto me bring up this people
[57:45] and thou Hast not let me know whom thou
[57:48] will send me yet thou has said I Know
[57:50] Thee by name and thou has thou has also
[57:53] found Grace in my sight now therefore I
[57:55] pray thee if I have found Grace in thy
[57:58] sight show me now thy way that I may
[58:02] Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy
[58:05] sight and consider that this nation is
[58:08] thy people and he said my presence this
[58:12] is his person shall go with thee and I
[58:16] will give thee rest and he said unto
[58:19] them unto Moses said unto him If thy
[58:22] presence go not with me carry us up not
[58:24] hence I I don't want to go anywhere
[58:27] where you're not leading
[58:29] me I want to go where you're leading
[58:33] me you see I want to walk in your
[58:35] presence Lord amen and I think that's
[58:39] the part that every one of us come to is
[58:41] that to realize that we are here in a
[58:44] fallen condition a fallen world because
[58:47] one person let down on the word and
[58:50] chose their own way now that way was
[58:52] made to seem right it was made to feel
[58:55] right it was made to where that any
[58:58] judgment regarding that decision to go
[59:00] the wrong way was diminished but yet now
[59:03] that decision has come had come about
[59:05] and you and I were born in sin shaped in
[59:08] iniquity come to this world speaking
[59:10] lies we were all built within this place
[59:13] and within that first birth and that's
[59:15] something that even after the New Birth
[59:17] has come we have to continue to wrestle
[59:20] with and put in subjection because
[59:22] there's Parts about us that we still
[59:24] want our own way and sometimes we can
[59:27] even classify our way as though it's
[59:29] thus sayith the Lord but yet thus sayith
[59:32] the Lord will always collaborate and
[59:35] Unite with not only the written word but
[59:37] it'll always Unite with the character so
[59:39] if you can't find the scripture but you
[59:42] find out that's not matching up with the
[59:44] character of Christ lay it aside because
[59:46] he is the word we always want his way
[59:49] because there's two ways his way and our
[59:53] way his way is always
[59:56] right our way is always
[1:00:00] wrong is that right the Bible said
[1:00:02] there's a way that seeth right unto man
[1:00:05] but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:00:07] death and so when we look at this the
[1:00:09] prophet would talk about how that there
[1:00:11] is a buzzer that in our life like a you
[1:00:14] know a buzzer and he would say now when
[1:00:17] that little buzzer he said if it begins
[1:00:19] to ring as the word is going forth you
[1:00:21] better listen to that and don't walk
[1:00:23] across it cuz you'll never get any
[1:00:25] farther till you come right back to
[1:00:27] where you left him now he says where you
[1:00:30] leave Christ at by failing to obey his
[1:00:33] word notice he don't leave you you leave
[1:00:36] him and you always leave him because you
[1:00:39] get in in the power because he's got you
[1:00:41] in the path and he's trying to lead you
[1:00:44] but when you leave him then you have to
[1:00:45] come right back to where you left him at
[1:00:48] and start again so it's to trace back
[1:00:51] the steps if if any has got off on any
[1:00:54] path we just cannot come right back to
[1:00:56] go but we have to trace back the path to
[1:01:00] coming back to him is that right I know
[1:01:03] sometimes that what we don't want is we
[1:01:05] we don't want to uh take in the Harvest
[1:01:08] of wrongful actions but coming back
[1:01:10] through repentance it's not going to do
[1:01:12] away with sometimes the bitterness of
[1:01:14] the Harvest of wrong seeds that were
[1:01:16] sown by our own decision that that's not
[1:01:19] what forgiveness don't take away from
[1:01:20] that but you know the thing that we have
[1:01:22] to understand that when real forgiveness
[1:01:25] is when we can look to God then God will
[1:01:27] give us the grace to stand and come back
[1:01:29] to where we need to be and get back on
[1:01:32] track you every one of us have been in a
[1:01:34] place or with somebody that was going to
[1:01:35] take some good scenic route somewhere
[1:01:38] and finally after all chasing things
[1:01:40] around you finally realize we need to
[1:01:43] get back on the
[1:01:45] route
[1:01:47] right and you know sometimes you know
[1:01:50] there's places where you go there's no
[1:01:52] signals
[1:01:54] whatsoever uh I mean you count on GPS
[1:01:57] and what and there's just no signals to
[1:01:59] get back there so we all we sometimes we
[1:02:01] got to retrace our steps on how do I get
[1:02:05] back to where I left God remember
[1:02:07] brother BR says as a person he said
[1:02:10] remember that man when the ship was
[1:02:11] going down and he was passing on and
[1:02:14] dying and that little boy knew and read
[1:02:16] Isaiah 53 to him and he instructed him
[1:02:19] and said now go back to where you left
[1:02:21] him and he said that that that man
[1:02:23] thought for a moment and he realized
[1:02:25] this is where he left him now I lay me
[1:02:27] down to sleep oh where he left him you
[1:02:31] see God will not leave us to wonder but
[1:02:33] he'll direct us right back to where we
[1:02:35] left him but you know there's nobody
[1:02:37] listen friends nobody within our own
[1:02:40] when you've got a real desire to serve
[1:02:42] God nobody Desires in a way to leave him
[1:02:45] but we've got to feed that desire we've
[1:02:48] got to feed that desire and and not
[1:02:50] allow the other things of the world to
[1:02:52] come into our life that can lead us
[1:02:54] astray we do not not want things that
[1:02:56] lift up reasoning lift up imagination we
[1:03:00] want the word of God which will only
[1:03:03] exalt the word and exalt that work that
[1:03:06] he's done on the inside that's what we
[1:03:08] want to see exalted in our
[1:03:12] lives this says why the Prophet this is
[1:03:14] a powerful statement he says it's not up
[1:03:16] to him that willth or runneth it's God
[1:03:18] that showeth Mercy he said you know it
[1:03:20] isn't how much you try it's how much God
[1:03:23] has done for you and if you've got
[1:03:25] enough God to come out here tonight I'll
[1:03:27] say this morning a desire to come hear
[1:03:30] the message you ought to be the happiest
[1:03:33] person in the city because God is moving
[1:03:37] in your life and he's trying to lead you
[1:03:40] to the Fountain because he loves
[1:03:42] you oh aren't you thankful to have a
[1:03:45] desire amen the scripture says in Isaiah
[1:03:49] 556 seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:03:54] found and call ye upon him while he is
[1:03:57] near and let the wicked forsake his way
[1:04:01] and the unrighteous man his thoughts and
[1:04:03] let him return unto the Lord and He will
[1:04:06] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[1:04:10] he will abundantly pardon for my
[1:04:14] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:04:16] are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord
[1:04:19] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:04:21] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:04:24] ways and my my thoughts than your
[1:04:26] thoughts oh that's what I want I want
[1:04:28] his ways I don't want Samuel's ways cuz
[1:04:31] Samuel's ways is always wrong Hallelujah
[1:04:34] you going to put your name there too I
[1:04:36] don't want Samuel's thoughts my thoughts
[1:04:38] are always wrong the only thing that
[1:04:41] would even that that when we only time
[1:04:43] we ever accept a thought like that is if
[1:04:45] the word itself has blessed it
[1:04:49] amen is that right the word must bless
[1:04:51] it how does the word bless it that it's
[1:04:53] in line with the word cuz if it's not in
[1:04:55] line with the word I don't want
[1:04:57] it I might want it my flesh might be
[1:05:00] pulled to it but I don't want it because
[1:05:01] at the end thereof are the ways of death
[1:05:04] that's right there's effects for those
[1:05:06] things I don't want that I I want I want
[1:05:08] to forsake and return is that what you
[1:05:10] want God I want to forsake if I'm going
[1:05:13] if I'm off a little bit I want to
[1:05:14] forsake that I don't want to try to
[1:05:16] defend it put arguments to it reason
[1:05:18] against it and and lay everything out I
[1:05:20] I want to I want to forsake it Lord I
[1:05:22] want to forsake whatever it is as it's
[1:05:25] leading and I cannot feel the peace of
[1:05:27] God to put my foot there I do not want
[1:05:30] to continue to walk that way I want to
[1:05:32] forsake it and return because there is
[1:05:35] abundance of Pardon in the presence of
[1:05:38] God and I tell you what as we're walking
[1:05:40] in this way God promised and he has
[1:05:42] provided the angel of the Lord to lead
[1:05:44] us all the way to the body change he's
[1:05:47] promised that he would lead us guide us
[1:05:49] keep us in the way and bring us to the
[1:05:51] promise of in my father's house are many
[1:05:53] mansions clear to the body chains and I
[1:05:56] tell you what by following the counsel
[1:05:58] of the lord we will make Canaan as sure
[1:06:01] as anything God's provided way that he's
[1:06:04] laid out for us in this hour I tell you
[1:06:06] I'm thankful aren't you I'm glad that
[1:06:09] God he reveals the acceptable way in
[1:06:12] this hour this is the counsel of the
[1:06:14] Lord now I don't know about you but you
[1:06:16] know when when I get in and I'm looking
[1:06:17] at things there's things that stand out
[1:06:19] to me and I I don't believe anything's
[1:06:20] just in coincidence within the word of
[1:06:23] God even in its placement in judges
[1:06:25] there's two place in the Book of Judges
[1:06:27] you know it's the book right before the
[1:06:29] little book of Ruth and in that Book of
[1:06:32] Judges is a time where it says that you
[1:06:35] know every man did what was right in his
[1:06:37] own eyes two times and the Very closing
[1:06:39] verse of the Book of Judges ends in
[1:06:42] verse 25 of Judges 21 and it says in
[1:06:46] those days there was no king in Israel
[1:06:49] and every man did that which was right
[1:06:54] in his own
[1:06:58] eyes Israel had a lot of trouble in the
[1:07:00] days of Judges you see the days of
[1:07:03] Judges is a parallel to that of even the
[1:07:06] ages the church ages remember that the
[1:07:08] here the the church was in inaugurated
[1:07:11] there it's a type the beginning of it of
[1:07:13] even there on the time of Solomon it
[1:07:15] totally it perfectly correlates with
[1:07:17] what took place on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:19] why Solomon was a man of rest right even
[1:07:21] when you trace through everything that
[1:07:23] happened in the dedication of the Temple
[1:07:25] God bringing his life into the believer
[1:07:28] and then you see how then on down
[1:07:30] through those kings Ahab being a type of
[1:07:32] those of that middle ages of that tharan
[1:07:35] age and you know coming in actually the
[1:07:36] paman age then it enters that into the
[1:07:39] thyra age and and I I just it comes down
[1:07:42] to a place to where now in the judges
[1:07:45] it's always a Time the prophet called it
[1:07:47] of a cycle of Revival and death he said
[1:07:50] where God would send the word and my he
[1:07:52] said people would be blazing and on fire
[1:07:55] with that original fire but after a
[1:07:56] while it would begin to cool down and
[1:07:59] and he said what would now only become
[1:08:01] now Embers that would there he said
[1:08:03] people would begin to allow themselves
[1:08:05] to partake of worldly things and watch
[1:08:07] things that they should not watch and
[1:08:09] read things that they should not reach
[1:08:11] why they begin to get comfortable in a
[1:08:14] past experience but God's not going to
[1:08:16] judge you on a past experience it's
[1:08:19] where you are right now are you walking
[1:08:22] in the word and the counsel of the Lord
[1:08:24] right now remember if he would have
[1:08:26] judged Lot's wife she started out as an
[1:08:30] overcomer but she didn't follow on she
[1:08:33] kept on walking but it never got out of
[1:08:35] her heart and eventually a call from in
[1:08:39] Sodom came out and she turned around to
[1:08:42] look and see what it was and right there
[1:08:45] right there in there she stopped and
[1:08:47] became a pillar of salt oh my we don't
[1:08:50] want to turn around for anything church
[1:08:53] we want to walk in the counsil of the
[1:08:55] Lord and God's not left you and I to try
[1:08:58] to find this on our own way but he
[1:09:01] himself is the one who's here with us to
[1:09:04] lead us and guide us and bring us into a
[1:09:07] place of rest to bring us into that
[1:09:09] place of a new heavens and a new Earth
[1:09:11] to lead us to the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost to lead us into that place of a
[1:09:16] real Security in
[1:09:18] him I want to just think I want you to
[1:09:21] look at this for a moment maybe you
[1:09:23] never thought of this before
[1:09:25] but you know with this last verse in the
[1:09:28] Book of Judges how fitting that is to
[1:09:31] the age we're living in an age that when
[1:09:35] God was calling it to repent they spit
[1:09:37] it right back in his face and said we
[1:09:39] are rich and increase with goods and we
[1:09:42] don't have need of
[1:09:45] nothing now you know it's comfortable
[1:09:47] for us to put that all out there on
[1:09:50] those bad churches all those bad
[1:09:52] denominations but I want you to know
[1:09:54] that's an attitude right denomination is
[1:09:57] not a building it's an attitude
[1:09:59] denomination is not an organization it's
[1:10:02] a
[1:10:03] spirit it's a spirit that wants to get
[1:10:06] upon and exalt above the word of God to
[1:10:09] get between you and the word and that
[1:10:12] where you and I would begin to take our
[1:10:13] own ideas our own thoughts our own
[1:10:16] feelings and and but yet we what we want
[1:10:18] to do is we want to stand and take the
[1:10:20] word of God because that is the only
[1:10:23] thing that'll never pass away
[1:10:26] and it's step by step of the way oh God
[1:10:30] help me
[1:10:31] Lord what a Time Israel had come into
[1:10:35] the land under
[1:10:37] Joshua but here they wer in the
[1:10:40] judges they had no
[1:10:43] counsel but the truth is they forsook
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] counsel if you ever look at this in the
[1:10:48] Book of
[1:10:49] Judges I want you to notice how
[1:10:52] important it is when God sends a message
[1:10:55] that that message is what God has sent
[1:10:58] to bring the interpretation of this
[1:11:02] word well I know scholar son I'm not
[1:11:05] interested in scholar son Ando God
[1:11:07] prepares a prophet he is a chip off of
[1:11:11] the diamond it's a vitrola needle when
[1:11:14] it's put up on the canned record the
[1:11:17] record that has the music in it when it
[1:11:19] places upon there it releases what's
[1:11:22] been sealed in here that's why this me
[1:11:25] message God could not send you and I a
[1:11:27] reformer because it would not bring the
[1:11:30] faith that was needed to live an
[1:11:32] overcoming life in this hour it would
[1:11:35] not bring the faith that was needed for
[1:11:37] rapturing condition and it wasn't
[1:11:40] brother brandom in his own self that
[1:11:42] brought it he was a channel that was
[1:11:44] found in the scriptures that God had
[1:11:47] promised he would send a prophet and a
[1:11:50] prophet is an eye piece it is a
[1:11:52] mouthpiece whereby the prophet is not
[1:11:54] speaking speaking according to his own
[1:11:56] thoughts but a prophet is caught up into
[1:11:59] a realm and he catches what God has
[1:12:02] already spoken and he's notifying the
[1:12:04] church this is the season this is the
[1:12:08] hour this is the acceptable time of the
[1:12:14] Lord Lord in the Book of
[1:12:19] Joshua the word Moses is mentioned 51
[1:12:23] times
[1:12:26] Moses said Moses the servant of God in
[1:12:29] the Book of Judges four
[1:12:32] times you want to know friends the
[1:12:35] pattern I don't understand where I don't
[1:12:38] understand if if individuals can say
[1:12:40] well we don't need to quote the
[1:12:42] prophet maybe you need to check and see
[1:12:44] whether you even believe the
[1:12:46] message and maybe you need to check to
[1:12:48] see it's even been revealed to you
[1:12:51] hallah come on cuz when Caleb went to
[1:12:53] get his Mountain he reminded Joshua
[1:12:58] Moses Moses said this is what this
[1:13:02] message promis me is a full Rapture a
[1:13:05] full inheritance he reminded Joshua this
[1:13:09] is what the word has
[1:13:12] said I tell you're talking about living
[1:13:14] a Victorious Life in this hour you're
[1:13:17] not going to live it outside of the
[1:13:18] message of the hour and when I'm talking
[1:13:20] about the message of the hour I'm not
[1:13:22] talking about books and tapes the
[1:13:24] message of the hour is Jesus Christ the
[1:13:27] person right here revealed before and in
[1:13:31] and through his body of
[1:13:34] Believers this is the son of man where
[1:13:38] the Eagles are being gathered to feed
[1:13:42] for body
[1:13:43] change feeding to overcome habits
[1:13:46] feeding to overcome fears and anxieties
[1:13:49] he's all I have need of
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:57] you quot him too much you might want to
[1:13:59] find another
[1:14:02] church I don't mean that arrogantly I'm
[1:14:05] just telling you I know where I'm
[1:14:09] standing the Bible said he that ha an
[1:14:12] ear let him hear what the spirit say to
[1:14:14] the church you want a blessing in your
[1:14:16] home stay with what the message has
[1:14:21] brought well I know so and so got off
[1:14:23] this way don't look at so and
[1:14:26] so the quotes not wrong their
[1:14:29] interpretation was wrong but the word is
[1:14:31] always
[1:14:36] right there a lot of quotes and all of a
[1:14:39] sudden you can go to quotee them and
[1:14:40] it's like you know all of a sudden
[1:14:41] people want to get scared I understand
[1:14:44] that but don't fault me because somebody
[1:14:47] that wasn't qualified to handle the word
[1:14:50] took that word and began to put a carnal
[1:14:52] interpretation to it
[1:14:55] and I'm going to tell you right now
[1:14:56] without him I'm nothing I'm depending on
[1:14:59] him he's the one who sent this
[1:15:03] message and the same angel that sent it
[1:15:06] is the same angel that accompanies this
[1:15:08] word to bring it to
[1:15:12] pass
[1:15:14] Hallelujah so yes sir I'm going to say
[1:15:16] what Moses said I'm going to say what
[1:15:19] the prophet of God has
[1:15:21] said the best thing that could happen
[1:15:23] for some of you to lay aside your
[1:15:26] bookstore devotionals and get into the
[1:15:29] message of the
[1:15:31] hour that's what keeps you going around
[1:15:34] the same Mountain you've been going
[1:15:37] around this mountain long
[1:15:39] enough it's time to get in to the
[1:15:42] message of the
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:46] Hour come on
[1:15:49] Friends well I heard doctor so and so
[1:15:51] said they don't have the word for the
[1:15:53] bride
[1:15:55] they don't have the word for
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:08] Rapture 51 times it was mentioned in the
[1:16:11] Book of
[1:16:15] Joshua only four times in the Book of
[1:16:18] Judges see to me friends when I'm when I
[1:16:22] when I'm this message when I hear this
[1:16:24] message
[1:16:26] it didn't draw me out of my Bible it
[1:16:27] drew me this Bible means more to me now
[1:16:30] than it ever
[1:16:34] did I mean it's got to where now you all
[1:16:37] may not do this but for me I mean my
[1:16:39] Bible I'm going to have to have this one
[1:16:40] rebound but you know you just hate to
[1:16:42] get rid of something that's already
[1:16:43] broke in and sometimes I have parts of
[1:16:45] quotes written in here and and
[1:16:46] everything it just things that you know
[1:16:48] God does it didn't take me away from the
[1:16:49] Bible this message come to reveal the
[1:16:52] god of the Bible
[1:16:55] well brother Samuel denominations they
[1:16:57] follow the Bible that's a lie they don't
[1:16:58] follow the Bible they'll go up to a
[1:17:01] certain point but they can't take all
[1:17:03] the word of
[1:17:04] God they'll hang up and they they'll
[1:17:07] teach that he split into three
[1:17:08] personalities that's heathenism that
[1:17:11] never came from the mind of God it's not
[1:17:14] three persons it's one God revealing
[1:17:18] himself as father as son as Holy Ghost
[1:17:25] brother we needed the counsel of God we
[1:17:27] needed the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:17:30] that was promised to be poured out upon
[1:17:32] the word in this
[1:17:34] hour
[1:17:35] Hallelujah and you know what that
[1:17:37] promise is when he would pour it out
[1:17:40] that anointing be poured out at the end
[1:17:44] going into the Philadelphian age which
[1:17:46] is the age before lady OA he said I set
[1:17:49] before thee an open
[1:17:52] door and brother Brown tells that open
[1:17:55] door it merges into the last St you know
[1:17:57] what that door is that door is the
[1:18:00] person of Jesus Christ for he said I am
[1:18:03] the shepherd John 10 I am the shepherd
[1:18:06] and I am the door of the sheep he's the
[1:18:09] one that leads us draws us guides us to
[1:18:12] him and then as we enter in through him
[1:18:15] oh we have safety in him and there is
[1:18:19] the power of God that moves down in our
[1:18:22] life to raise up a son and daughter of
[1:18:24] God
[1:18:25] why we've come through the open door the
[1:18:27] way that has been set before
[1:18:31] us
[1:18:33] Lord my my we could probably just close
[1:18:36] there and say it been good to be here
[1:18:38] but I'll tell you friends it's a truth
[1:18:41] yes that's why there's things that I
[1:18:44] think I'm just going to stay right now I
[1:18:46] think there's things you know what our
[1:18:47] our young people it a it ain't just
[1:18:48] depending on me well brother Samuel they
[1:18:50] needed to get at youth Bible study it
[1:18:52] shouldn't just depend on that there's
[1:18:54] Direction that the prophet has given us
[1:18:56] even on
[1:18:58] marriage on how we're to marriage how
[1:19:00] we're to seek things out and he was not
[1:19:02] speaking in some civil political manner
[1:19:05] either these are things that are to be
[1:19:07] instructed in our home I don't care what
[1:19:10] the culture says you be strong and
[1:19:13] courageous and stay with the word
[1:19:15] because if you'll stay with the message
[1:19:17] of the hour oh that was just brother
[1:19:19] bram's thought you better run from
[1:19:22] that I know there's a lot of voices in
[1:19:25] the land that said oh this is Brother
[1:19:27] bram's opinion my whole point that I
[1:19:29] will call them on the carpet with is
[1:19:31] show me the Vindication in your ministry
[1:19:34] that was there in the ministry of
[1:19:36] Malachi 4 and if we're going back to
[1:19:39] that that's what God C us out of every
[1:19:42] man doing what was right in his own eyes
[1:19:44] God does not want us to follow any man
[1:19:47] as an absolute oh I got to get to this
[1:19:50] pastor I got to get to this preacher
[1:19:52] there is one that we have been
[1:19:53] introduced to and if you ever meet him
[1:19:56] in a personal way you come to know his
[1:19:59] ways you come to know his voice and it
[1:20:01] stabilizes you because he said I'll take
[1:20:04] care of you when you get in trouble I'll
[1:20:07] save you when the things get hard I'll
[1:20:09] deliver
[1:20:13] you
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:19] Hallelujah you want a home that's
[1:20:21] blessed with God
[1:20:24] take the message of the
[1:20:34] hour now it's because the scripture
[1:20:38] said as many as I love in Revelations 3
[1:20:42] not not as many as love
[1:20:44] me brother BR said we never to make him
[1:20:46] the object of human love he said the
[1:20:49] many are the elected of God as many as I
[1:20:53] love
[1:20:55] well what do you do do you send them
[1:20:59] Amazon drop things do you send them
[1:21:03] sugar what do you do I rebuke and
[1:21:07] chasen be zelous therefore and
[1:21:11] repent now I don't care friends who who
[1:21:13] you are who we are our flesh don't like
[1:21:17] correction that's right that's right I
[1:21:20] said our
[1:21:21] flesh that's why there's got to be
[1:21:23] something deep in our
[1:21:26] life a strength on the inside that's
[1:21:30] able to hear God's voice and say look I
[1:21:34] might have a right to feel this way but
[1:21:36] you are not going to reside in my life
[1:21:39] and dominate my life I'm not nope
[1:21:41] grudges are not welcome get out it's not
[1:21:45] welcome I don't want that because you
[1:21:47] know why that'll be left
[1:21:50] here you see friends when when the
[1:21:52] Rapture comes we're not all of a sudden
[1:21:54] when the come will it be perfect love
[1:21:55] over there but remember it'll take
[1:21:57] perfect love here to get there so it
[1:22:02] isn't when Rapture comes along and man
[1:22:04] the atoms of our bodies are changed
[1:22:05] automatically hey that Grudge I had
[1:22:07] against you gone no no that's the power
[1:22:10] of the rapturing word in this hour to
[1:22:13] dismantle things in our life that would
[1:22:16] be holding us down once to hold us back
[1:22:20] right
[1:22:21] amen Lord Jesus help us he said said
[1:22:24] behold I stand at the door and knock I'm
[1:22:26] trying to get somewhere behold I stand
[1:22:28] at the door and knock that's our heart
[1:22:29] that's not the church remember he got
[1:22:32] put out of the
[1:22:33] church right the Lord Jesus got put out
[1:22:36] of the church see they've got the Bible
[1:22:38] but they put out the Holy Ghost they put
[1:22:41] out the word for man's
[1:22:45] ideas well all you got to do is just you
[1:22:48] know just believe on Jesus and and
[1:22:50] that's all there is to it but wait a
[1:22:52] minute he spoke about you and I taking
[1:22:54] up not his cross he did that for you and
[1:22:57] I but you and I have a cross to take
[1:23:01] up you see it's like an easy an easy no
[1:23:05] commitment just just just this and
[1:23:08] that's it you know you can go on and
[1:23:09] live your own life and everything's okay
[1:23:12] and and it's all right but you see
[1:23:13] listen friends that will never I want
[1:23:15] you to understand me God God is a
[1:23:17] Shepherd not a herdsman right that's
[1:23:20] right God's not trying to her people in
[1:23:23] he leads you and I
[1:23:25] he draws you and I he doesn't want to
[1:23:28] come and make us fearful and terrifi
[1:23:30] well if I don't serve God I may go to
[1:23:32] hell what kind of miserable that that's
[1:23:34] miserable that's that's where that's
[1:23:36] where that God is moving to bring Ruth
[1:23:39] to a place of rest to where she knows
[1:23:42] that no matter what takes place I am my
[1:23:44] beloveds and he is mine to where that
[1:23:47] she no longer is just looking at her own
[1:23:50] identity but now God is bringing her to
[1:23:53] a place to where she is is taking on the
[1:23:55] identity of
[1:24:00] Boaz now she's got to know Boaz over
[1:24:03] many
[1:24:04] days this Harvest barley Harvest then
[1:24:07] wheat Harvest over many days I don't
[1:24:10] know weeks I don't know but it was a
[1:24:14] period of
[1:24:15] time and she got to know his character
[1:24:19] right you see she's got to have
[1:24:21] trust she's come around his character
[1:24:24] She's Come Around the word and and if
[1:24:28] Ruth got to a spot and said uhuh you're
[1:24:31] not going to medal in my life right
[1:24:33] there we are not doing that you're not
[1:24:36] going to tell me how to live you're not
[1:24:39] going to tell me what to
[1:24:42] do but what do you like about me Ruth
[1:24:44] well I love
[1:24:46] Grace but that's only one attribute
[1:24:49] that's the attribute that brings the
[1:24:50] realization of all these other things
[1:24:53] because you cannot even live what I've
[1:24:56] called you to live without the grace of
[1:24:59] God and so he himself will not even
[1:25:02] allow the attribute of Grace to be
[1:25:04] misinterpreted so that our lives are not
[1:25:07] in disgrace but that we become the real
[1:25:09] trophies of divine grace he is The
[1:25:13] Interpreter of his own word is he not
[1:25:16] and I want you to think of this of how
[1:25:18] that Ruth oh she is falling in love with
[1:25:20] the character of Boaz she's already been
[1:25:22] told when she comes in hey hey hey the
[1:25:24] field that man you talked about Boaz
[1:25:27] he's a near
[1:25:28] Kinsman Naomi is already
[1:25:32] rejoicing cuz the prophets have looked
[1:25:34] forward to this time Naomi beginning to
[1:25:36] rejoice and H you know who this
[1:25:41] is hallelujah now I want to just say it
[1:25:44] you know in this way that when you begin
[1:25:46] to look at it you know how that God
[1:25:48] would come in such a way that you know
[1:25:51] for for the Lord coming like it was in
[1:25:53] Revelation 3 in this end time where even
[1:25:56] as we said in the Book of Judges every
[1:25:58] man did what was right in his own eyes
[1:26:01] you know that God when he sent the
[1:26:03] message in this hour he could not build
[1:26:06] upon the ideas and the Creeds of man in
[1:26:09] other words it was not as though it was
[1:26:11] a building that was already built in a
[1:26:14] place just awaiting the headstone are
[1:26:17] you hearing me now there had been an
[1:26:19] elect that had come under the word of
[1:26:21] God in their generation but when the
[1:26:24] word would come in this hour to to a
[1:26:27] people of God there had to be an
[1:26:29] establishing of the church back on the
[1:26:32] rightful foundation of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:36] Christ the Chief Cornerstone the
[1:26:38] foundation is that right this is why the
[1:26:41] Bible said zerubabel his hands have laid
[1:26:44] the foundation and he shall also bring
[1:26:46] forth the Capstone so God in this age
[1:26:50] brought a word that would take us back
[1:26:52] to the original Foundation
[1:26:56] brother he won just 2,000 years ago it
[1:26:58] took us back to the back parts of God's
[1:27:01] mind and showed us the lamb we were
[1:27:04] there as sons of God shouting for joy
[1:27:06] and you know when we're shouting for Joy
[1:27:08] the prophet says in one place we saw our
[1:27:11] Salvation in another place he said the
[1:27:13] sons of God were shouting for Joy when
[1:27:16] they would recognize one day the life of
[1:27:18] this lamb would be
[1:27:21] tabernacled in Dwelling Places
[1:27:25] again do you understand what hearing
[1:27:27] from your theophany is it's tying you
[1:27:30] back to that reality of who you always
[1:27:33] were and what you rejoiced and shouted
[1:27:36] about in the mind of
[1:27:39] God it brought you back to the
[1:27:42] Cornerstone to the foundation and as a
[1:27:45] matter of fact you're part of this
[1:27:46] Foundation the prophet said and chosen
[1:27:48] place of worship he laid the foundation
[1:27:51] stone in you before the foundation of
[1:27:52] the world
[1:27:54] this is why we don't build upon our own
[1:27:56] ideas we don't build upon anything
[1:27:58] outside of the revelation of Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ and it takes the quickening power
[1:28:02] of God to raise up the foundation stone
[1:28:05] of the seed of God that he placed within
[1:28:07] us so you know what he's doing it'll be
[1:28:09] word added to word so inside of our life
[1:28:11] there is a conforming to the very image
[1:28:14] of Jesus Christ and it's all under the
[1:28:17] counsel of the lord it's all him leading
[1:28:19] us continuing to draw you and I lead us
[1:28:23] through the word word lead us by his
[1:28:26] Spirit oh my aren't you thankful friends
[1:28:28] for the message in this
[1:28:30] hour it's God bringing us into real
[1:28:32] Dwelling Places you see the thing of it
[1:28:35] is and I want you just to listen to me
[1:28:37] for a
[1:28:39] moment you see Ruth was Ruth was
[1:28:42] tested Boaz didn't put her in a bubble
[1:28:46] she was going to be tested right whether
[1:28:49] she'd follow the young men cuz they were
[1:28:52] much closer to her age than Boaz was I
[1:28:55] won't get into that today they were much
[1:28:59] closer but you see when we get to
[1:29:01] looking at this this is where that God
[1:29:04] would stand in this Lal seean age and
[1:29:06] here you find oh man I mean when the
[1:29:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost struck down
[1:29:11] you know there on isua street and return
[1:29:13] of gifts and my the supernatural that
[1:29:16] was taken but there was a lot of mixture
[1:29:18] of wrong as well this is why that the
[1:29:21] bride is not called back to and Aza
[1:29:24] Street
[1:29:26] Experience but the bride is brought back
[1:29:28] to the original Pentecost
[1:29:31] experience come on friends I hope you
[1:29:34] don't misunderstand me Pentecost is not
[1:29:37] signs and wonders and miracles Pentecost
[1:29:39] this a direct quote out of spoken words
[1:29:40] Original Seed Pentecost is God they met
[1:29:45] God and then signs and wonders followed
[1:29:48] them that believed this is why you and I
[1:29:51] listen friends we don't follow after the
[1:29:53] supernatural if the supernatural has
[1:29:55] come to us and the Supernatural is
[1:29:58] following Our Lives you may not even
[1:30:01] realize but the way that you have even
[1:30:03] stood on your job or maybe with your
[1:30:05] family where the enemy has tried to draw
[1:30:07] you out and the spirit of God would move
[1:30:10] you in a way you may not have even
[1:30:11] failed it but God Gave You Grace to
[1:30:14] stand there and conduct yourself as a
[1:30:16] son and daughter of God anybody else
[1:30:18] would have blown to a middle of pieces
[1:30:20] and you walk away and what is that signs
[1:30:23] and wonders are following them that
[1:30:25] believe a supernatural God that is
[1:30:27] holding you as a prisoner to his
[1:30:30] word you talking about a
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:36] miracle Brother s I want to see
[1:30:38] something Supernatural you can be healed
[1:30:41] and get sick again but when God takes a
[1:30:43] hold of your life and changes it and as
[1:30:45] your character is being molded more and
[1:30:47] more in His image that is irreversible
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:55] Hallelujah GL now you all know I
[1:30:57] appreciate healing I I'm not preaching
[1:31:00] healing is a minor thing hey when I get
[1:31:01] sick it's
[1:31:03] major that's not I'm not saying that but
[1:31:05] what I'm trying to say here this morning
[1:31:08] is that the bride of Christ is not being
[1:31:10] drawn back into a place of we've got to
[1:31:14] have this we've got to have that and
[1:31:15] we've got to have this amen and and
[1:31:17] pictures painted well I'm not going to
[1:31:20] go there this morning but sometimes it's
[1:31:22] it's responsibility I I think of myself
[1:31:24] as a minister of the Gospel of this
[1:31:26] message I've got a responsibility of
[1:31:28] what I set before you I don't want to
[1:31:31] just set a mirage of something you're
[1:31:33] grabbing at and grabbing at but to
[1:31:36] recognize the Dynamics is not something
[1:31:38] out there and the Dynamics is right
[1:31:40] there working in your life how do you
[1:31:42] think you're sitting here this morning
[1:31:44] in your right mind even when things have
[1:31:47] gone backwards from what you wanted it
[1:31:50] to go you prayed and it went the other
[1:31:52] way you prayed and you never heard an
[1:31:54] answer I'm asking you what's holding you
[1:31:56] the Dynamics of the holy
[1:32:00] spirit it's come to make the word live
[1:32:04] in flesh
[1:32:08] HL so we're not going to minimize it to
[1:32:11] just well it's something got to take
[1:32:12] place up here it's something no no no
[1:32:14] the Dynamics is Christ coming to his
[1:32:16] word and making that word live and the
[1:32:20] prophet said it like this in the
[1:32:21] adoption series it's Christ Living in a
[1:32:23] farmer it's Christ Living in a housewife
[1:32:26] it's Christ Living in a minister it's
[1:32:28] Christ Living in a factory worker it's
[1:32:30] Christ Living in a father it's Christ

[1:33:28] of harvest time and he begins to take
[1:33:30] that word and run it through our lives
[1:33:33] and the things that was weighing us down
[1:33:35] the great Winds of the Holy Ghost just
[1:33:38] blow that shaft away and all that's left

[1:33:59] him you go down there he going to be
[1:34:01] there

[1:34:05] remember Naomi the Old Testament right
[1:34:07] was a foreshadow of the new I tell you
[1:34:10] where he's going to be I'm not guessing
[1:34:13] no wonder if God's going to send another

[1:34:16] guessing I know where he's
[1:34:19] at and I can tell you if you go down

[1:34:41] why seek you the living among the
[1:34:44] dead right you know the Rich Young Ruler
[1:34:47] no wonder the prophet would take the
[1:34:48] Rich Young Ruler and and type him as the
[1:34:51] lady oan AG that's
[1:34:54] because here's
[1:34:56] one I've done all the
[1:34:59] Commandments but he knew he' lack
[1:35:01] something in his
[1:35:03] life and that's why he was standing
[1:35:06] there before the Lord
[1:35:09] Jesus the prophet would speak to it and
[1:35:13] say as he held on to his great
[1:35:16] possessions now let me just tell you
[1:35:18] friends you might be as poor as a job
[1:35:20] job's turkey but we ain't talking about

[1:35:45] dealing with things in your life and it
[1:35:47] feels like woo it's come I'm going to

[1:36:08] try to do this you listen and I think I
[1:36:10] think that would that's a wonderful
[1:36:11] thing I remember when God got a hold of
[1:36:13] my life and man I'll tell you what you

[1:36:24] music playing that didn't change I I
[1:36:25] still I love music I'll have music going

[1:36:28] music going I'll be singing but I had a
[1:36:30] whole big case man of
[1:36:33] CDs then I had you know from where I had
[1:36:35] my earrings and I had those in the box
[1:36:38] and had that laid out you know I missed
[1:36:40] a cool one when God got a hold of my
[1:36:43] life I still had a pull on them things
[1:36:45] but there
[1:36:47] was I remember somebody said what what

[1:36:50] want them no more amen yeah there you go
[1:36:54] I'm just telling you I don't want them
[1:36:56] no more and you know let me just tell
[1:36:58] you something there's a power it comes
[1:37:00] to agreeing with the word of
[1:37:02] God you understand what you saying
[1:37:04] Brother Sam I'm saying that music that
[1:37:05] worldly music was not
[1:37:08] me them hoops and everything that wasn't
[1:37:11] me it was a spirit you've got to realize
[1:37:15] it's not something well I've got to try
[1:37:17] to do this better there is a God who
[1:37:20] supplies all of our needs he breing
[1:37:23] breaks Spirits he breaks habits he's a
[1:37:26] chain
[1:37:28] breaker the breaker is come
[1:37:32] up he breaks holdes he breaks depression
[1:37:35] he breaks anxiety listen friends it's
[1:37:37] not you it's a spirit that wants to hold
[1:37:40] you back it's a spirit of fashion and
[1:37:44] the Holy Spirit says you can't rule over
[1:37:46] my daughter no more you can't roll over
[1:37:49] my son no more there is a desire in
[1:37:51] their heart to be free and they're
[1:37:54] laying it aside and what does he do he
[1:37:56] breaks that hold on your life I'm
[1:37:59] telling you not not to the end of
[1:38:01] service I'm telling you right now well
[1:38:04] the word's going
[1:38:06] forth what are you saying he's letting
[1:38:08] you know where he's laying at he's
[1:38:11] laying in the
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:14] floor if you'll let him he'll separate
[1:38:16] you from them worldly desires
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:26] I don't care what it cost
[1:38:28] me let me just say this to your
[1:38:31] friends it still cost
[1:38:34] me it still cost me when the Holy Spirit
[1:38:37] deals with my heart and there's things
[1:38:39] that comes up that God brings me to that
[1:38:41] I couldn't bring myself to and I'm
[1:38:43] brought to a place to stand face to face
[1:38:45] and say there's still too much Samuel
[1:38:51] here it still takes the counsel of the
[1:38:54] Lord it still takes that this isn't just
[1:38:57] some One-Shot deal right here at the
[1:38:59] altar man we're good to go the rest of
[1:39:01] the time we are born as children of God
[1:39:04] but we grow to
[1:39:06] manhood that's why even when God gets a
[1:39:08] hold of her life there might be little
[1:39:10] things that they'll have to set aside it
[1:39:12] might want to come back they'll push it
[1:39:13] away it'll want to come back but as they
[1:39:15] feed on the word and the experience in
[1:39:17] their life they'll find that hold is
[1:39:19] broken in their life why greater is he
[1:39:22] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:39:25] world it's not your Perfection it's his
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:34] Perfection this message come to show you
[1:39:37] and I I know where he's at I know where
[1:39:40] you can find rest I know where we can
[1:39:43] get all this
[1:39:45] settled and Ruth said I'm all ears and
[1:39:49] I'm all
[1:39:50] heart that's a time you want ears
[1:39:53] you want a great big heart
[1:39:56] too see that Rich Young Ruler down in
[1:39:58] his heart brother BR said he knew there
[1:40:00] was something different about Jesus than
[1:40:02] the rest of them
[1:40:04] Pharisees I want you to think about that
[1:40:06] no doubt I know I talked with some of
[1:40:08] you even when God brought you back here
[1:40:10] after a time and you said and talked to
[1:40:12] me and said we've been here and we've
[1:40:14] been there but there's something
[1:40:15] different about here well let me tell
[1:40:17] you it ain't this physical
[1:40:20] address I'm glad God's no respect to
[1:40:22] person I listen I I I love where we're
[1:40:24] at I thank God for the building and
[1:40:25] everything we're at and man everything
[1:40:27] we've had to go through and you know
[1:40:28] some through the water some through the
[1:40:29] floods I'm grateful we've had to you
[1:40:31] know move through all those things but
[1:40:32] let me just tell you something it is not
[1:40:34] the beauty of this place right here but
[1:40:37] it's the beauty of his character that's
[1:40:40] being revealed to his people in his
[1:40:43] people and through his people you know
[1:40:44] what it is that there is a reality of
[1:40:46] God that is here that in your life and
[1:40:49] in my life that beyond your
[1:40:51] circumstances there's a word that tells
[1:40:53] you you are not hopeless you are not
[1:40:56] Beyond Redemption your problem is not
[1:40:58] too great there is nothing too big for
[1:41:01] God there is a place right here that
[1:41:03] says he is more than able and if God is
[1:41:06] for us tell me who can be against
[1:41:10] us tell me what habit tell me what
[1:41:13] situation tell me what
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:19] Spirit
[1:41:21] hallelujah oh God
[1:41:24] we got to follow that
[1:41:26] pathway back into the holiest of
[1:41:30] holies let me just let me just try
[1:41:33] to bring this around
[1:41:37] here I tell you friends if not for God's
[1:41:40] mercy you and I would not have found the
[1:41:43] path that's right that's right David
[1:41:45] said he'll make known unto me the path
[1:41:47] of life he will show me that's what the
[1:41:50] Bible says show me reveal to me we
[1:41:52] wouldn't even even know how do I get to
[1:41:55] him are you listening to me now the
[1:41:58] Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy CH
[1:42:00] 12 there's many
[1:42:02] gates that the lord giveth thee but
[1:42:05] there's one gate right that he's given
[1:42:08] to place his name in right the prophet
[1:42:10] said all them other Gates was given to
[1:42:13] tempt but the gate that he places his
[1:42:16] name in is his life is his character is
[1:42:20] his nature is who he really is
[1:42:23] is is that
[1:42:26] right brother Bram would say it in this
[1:42:29] way in the message
[1:42:31] indictment he said there's reasons why
[1:42:33] we don't see things happening in the
[1:42:34] churches now he's not altogether talking
[1:42:37] about signs and wonders that's that he's
[1:42:39] talking about with a life that's lived a
[1:42:42] life that is harnessed to the word of
[1:42:44] God a life where there's a desire to
[1:42:47] please God above everything else a
[1:42:48] desire that doesn't pull back and say
[1:42:51] well my pastor said says this or my so-
[1:42:55] and so says this you know listen friend
[1:42:57] that's the same thing are you listening
[1:42:58] now that's the same thing as a person
[1:43:01] you or I that could follow the word of
[1:43:03] the hour and then we get in a real tight
[1:43:06] spot and we'll say but my daddy said but
[1:43:11] my mama said my grandma said my so and
[1:43:15] so
[1:43:16] said it's got quiet
[1:43:19] now but the Bible said forsake all
[1:43:22] others
[1:43:24] and cleave thee only unto
[1:43:28] him that's what's important that's many
[1:43:31] times listen I I've stood as a pastor
[1:43:34] now 22 years this weekend 22 years does
[1:43:38] seem like just about just few years to
[1:43:40] me in one way in another way I look at
[1:43:42] pictures and I think I didn't get them
[1:43:44] wrinkles
[1:43:46] overnight I didn't get I didn't get that
[1:43:48] didn't happen just like but I look at it
[1:43:50] now and one thing I've always found and
[1:43:52] these are things that matter after you
[1:43:53] sit and talk with someone give them
[1:43:55] Direction and counsel and you realize
[1:43:57] when you pray I go away pray God be
[1:43:59] merciful Lord help them and just
[1:44:00] continue to pray Lord help them give
[1:44:02] them Grace because I know that those
[1:44:04] things can wrestle and more there could
[1:44:05] be things we want but what we want more
[1:44:07] than anything else is the word of
[1:44:10] God because sometimes there's things
[1:44:12] that we might want you got to look to
[1:44:14] the end of it where's this going to lead
[1:44:15] me to if I make this decision now
[1:44:18] where's it going to lead me to see lot
[1:44:19] didn't see that lot only looked at hey
[1:44:22] it's better down there
[1:44:24] so you got to be careful what you follow
[1:44:27] you could follow a job right out of
[1:44:29] church you could follow activities right
[1:44:32] out of
[1:44:33] church come on you could follow a lot of
[1:44:35] things right out of church let me I'll
[1:44:37] just say you right now you don't need to
[1:44:38] pray over anything that's leading you
[1:44:40] out of church that's right the only
[1:44:42] reason we pray and say I wonder if this
[1:44:43] is God's will it's not really that we
[1:44:45] want to know it's God's will it's what
[1:44:47] we want but let me tell you when you put
[1:44:50] God first God is a way maker
[1:44:55] he's a way maker he does the
[1:44:59] miraculous when you stand upon his word
[1:45:02] listen miracles do not precede the word
[1:45:06] Miracles follow the word amen go fill
[1:45:10] the water pots with water then the
[1:45:12] miracle happen repent be baptized in the
[1:45:15] name of Jesus Christ and the Miracle
[1:45:17] will
[1:45:19] come roll away the stone and the Miracle
[1:45:22] will walk out
[1:45:23] yes Miracles follow obedience to the
[1:45:30] word brother Bram said they reject the
[1:45:32] very path to get back to the blood which
[1:45:36] is the word and he says there's only one
[1:45:38] way God will honor that word you'll
[1:45:40] never honor that word and come out and
[1:45:42] say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand this
[1:45:45] to be done you can't do it Methodist
[1:45:48] Baptist or Pentecostals you can't do it
[1:45:51] the only way you can do it is under the
[1:45:53] mercies of God through his grace is to
[1:45:56] come through the shed blood of Jesus
[1:45:58] Christ and say Lord I claim the
[1:46:03] promise in the message the way back in
[1:46:06] 1962 he says if you say you believe God
[1:46:08] and deny his word well then you don't
[1:46:10] believe God cuz God is his word you
[1:46:13] can't do it you've got to accept the
[1:46:15] word that is the way back back by the
[1:46:18] word path and the word is God Amen
[1:46:23] and the message leadership I hope this
[1:46:25] all right this is Moses maybe quote
[1:46:29] 48 out of the message
[1:46:32] leadership brother BR says there's no
[1:46:34] church listen to me now there's no
[1:46:35] church no methodists Baptists
[1:46:37] Pentecostals or anything else can ever
[1:46:40] put this church into the bride that's
[1:46:44] right it'll have to be the answering of
[1:46:45] Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to
[1:46:48] be revealed cuz that's the only way
[1:46:53] remember David wanted to bring the ark
[1:46:55] back right he wanted to bring it back
[1:46:59] and what he did he consulted with
[1:47:01] captains of
[1:47:03] thousands many many schools of men's
[1:47:06] thoughts and you know what they said Put
[1:47:09] it on a new cart God never intended
[1:47:13] mechanical devices to carry the
[1:47:17] word that's a direct quote God never
[1:47:20] intended that you know what that end up
[1:47:21] causing it end up PA and when the ark
[1:47:23] started to slide off of that it shows
[1:47:25] that it's not in its rightful place cuz
[1:47:28] the word started to shift listen that's
[1:47:30] why the word it's got to be deeper than
[1:47:33] just your mind it's got to be deeper
[1:47:35] than just your spirits it's got to be
[1:47:37] something to where the love of God has
[1:47:39] come into your soul by the Holy Ghost it
[1:47:43] changes your desire and your desire is
[1:47:45] to please God if there's anything that's
[1:47:47] going to move it's not the word it's my
[1:47:50] will not thy will not not my will but
[1:47:53] thine will be done if there's anything
[1:47:56] going to slide off it's my way because I
[1:47:59] want to go God's
[1:48:01] way that's when the word comes back into
[1:48:04] the rightful position God said it's to
[1:48:07] be carried over the heart of the
[1:48:10] priest the prophet said that's the
[1:48:12] rightful place for the word is in your
[1:48:15] heart amen right cuz if it's in our mind
[1:48:19] it only takes C certain website it'll
[1:48:21] will be gone
[1:48:23] it's only and that's what I'm talking
[1:48:24] about in our spirit oh it takes oh this
[1:48:26] this you know that's all it takes but
[1:48:28] when it's anchored even though you may
[1:48:30] not even have the explanation to it or
[1:48:32] whatever more but you say too
[1:48:35] late as a matter of fact I I don't even
[1:48:37] eat out of garbage
[1:48:40] cans I found something so much better I
[1:48:43] don't need to I don't even need to know
[1:48:45] what the garbage men are picking
[1:48:47] up God hadn't sent me to straighten out
[1:48:49] them that want to eat out of trash cans
[1:48:51] God sent me with a message where there's
[1:48:53] children that they're sick and tired of
[1:48:55] eating out of trash they're sick and
[1:48:57] tired of living an up and down life and
[1:48:59] God has sent a word in this hour to say
[1:49:01] hey you don't have to fly around on dead
[1:49:04] carcasses things that lead to death and
[1:49:07] destruction and causes you a ticket to
[1:49:09] the tribulation but if you're Desiring
[1:49:11] to go in the Rapture and live an
[1:49:13] overcoming life there is a fresh kill of
[1:49:16] the word right here in the threshing
[1:49:19] floor
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:24] now amen my my my don't you love the
[1:49:29] Lord
[1:49:32] hallelujah you know the Bible says it
[1:49:34] like this in Romans
[1:49:36] 2:4 the goodness of God
[1:49:40] leadeth thee to repentance that's very
[1:49:43] key friends right repentance I know is
[1:49:46] that's that's where we
[1:49:48] begin but but this is the thing God's
[1:49:51] not interested in us staying in a cycle
[1:49:54] of where it's just a cycle of
[1:49:56] repentance but yet you and I have to
[1:49:59] repent
[1:50:01] daily right but this repentance I'm
[1:50:04] talking about is there's got to be a
[1:50:06] starting spot and see it's the goodness
[1:50:09] of God what what goodness what does this
[1:50:10] mean the goodness of God it's the same
[1:50:13] one I read to you out of the book of
[1:50:14] Exodus where it says my presence shall
[1:50:18] go before thee and God by his presence
[1:50:22] leads us and has led us to repentance
[1:50:25] isn't it powerful that even in a service
[1:50:27] like this that there's things that God
[1:50:29] can bring to your attention and to my
[1:50:31] attention and it's the goodness of God
[1:50:33] the revealing of the mercies of God that
[1:50:36] will direct us into Parts in our life
[1:50:39] and lead us to
[1:50:41] repentance come on Friends well brother
[1:50:44] Samuel I'm a sheep I'm a lamb that new
[1:50:46] nature is that that on the inside that's
[1:50:48] been raised up yeah but remember there's
[1:50:50] this here right now even when Nathan
[1:50:52] came to David he never came into David
[1:50:54] and walked in there and said hey you're
[1:50:56] a guilty guy
[1:50:57] buddy flat service might as well saying
[1:50:59] take the name of Jesus with you and go
[1:51:01] on why because even though it's truth it
[1:51:03] ain't going to help but you see what God
[1:51:05] does the goodness of God begins to stir
[1:51:09] David's gates up knowing David's a word
[1:51:13] man is that right but God knows I can't
[1:51:15] allow them gates in the spirit to get in
[1:51:17] the way because if he locks up even
[1:51:19] though he's a word man on the inside I
[1:51:21] cannot allow them Gates to lock up the
[1:51:24] gates have got to be open right for me
[1:51:28] to enter so how does God bring the gates
[1:51:31] open in David's life how does he bring
[1:51:33] the gates open in our life by his word
[1:51:37] by his presence it causes us to trust
[1:51:40] him and then the gates are open and then
[1:51:42] he just slips right in there as the
[1:51:44] mighty conqueror and as he slips right
[1:51:46] in and then he leads us to repentance
[1:51:52] I wish there's more time I had to deal
[1:51:54] with this on that of repentance because
[1:51:57] it's such a key in this hour it you know
[1:52:01] you know you're a blessed you're a
[1:52:02] blessed person you and I are blessed
[1:52:04] friends to be able to hear God's voice
[1:52:06] to be able to realize that what this
[1:52:08] word has called you and I too look I no
[1:52:10] doubt like right in here I'm talking to
[1:52:11] people that were Roman Catholics maybe
[1:52:13] some of you were devout and probably a
[1:52:15] lot of you weren't and then you're
[1:52:16] talking you know the people might have
[1:52:17] been Baptist devout Baptist I mean you
[1:52:19] had all the gold stars on the on the
[1:52:21] Sunday School calendar and all these
[1:52:23] other things you know but still it took
[1:52:25] the word of God coming across your path
[1:52:27] and Jesus said I've not come to call the
[1:52:29] righteous to repentance I'm come to call
[1:52:32] the Sinners to
[1:52:33] repentance you see isn't it wonderful
[1:52:36] that there's a call that goes forth into
[1:52:38] your heart and to your life that call
[1:52:40] was
[1:52:40] broadcast you understand that it was
[1:52:42] broadcast throughout this whole
[1:52:45] generation and those who are affected by
[1:52:48] that word and are coming into a real
[1:52:51] repentance with God pise God no man the
[1:52:56] Bible said can come unto me except my
[1:52:58] father draw him and I'll raise him up in
[1:53:02] the last days you see what that drawing
[1:53:05] is you you and I could not even seek
[1:53:09] after him unless he first begin to draw
[1:53:14] us and let me just tell you this right
[1:53:16] here the drawing did not even start no
[1:53:18] doubt when you were sitting in the
[1:53:19] church the drawing could have started
[1:53:22] like even when you reading a
[1:53:24] track remember the one man word made
[1:53:26] flesh from India trip his wife had a
[1:53:28] track somebody gave him a track and all
[1:53:30] of a sudden one day he just sitting
[1:53:31] around and just pulls it out of his
[1:53:32] pocket and all of a sudden he began to
[1:53:33] read that track and he said the awfulest
[1:53:35] feeling came over me that I needed to
[1:53:38] get right brother Ram said right there
[1:53:40] is where you was
[1:53:41] saved
[1:53:43] Hallelujah yes sir he said brother Ram
[1:53:46] right there he said yeah he said you
[1:53:47] never were able to get away from were he
[1:53:48] said no he says and you used to do horse
[1:53:50] betting and gambling and drinking and
[1:53:52] all those things like it used to used to
[1:53:53] dance halls used to love all he said I
[1:53:55] used to he said he said from that moment
[1:53:57] he said I didn't I didn't like it no
[1:53:59] more he said I don't want he said what
[1:54:00] happened brother BR said it was God's
[1:54:02] thought that came in and dropped down
[1:54:05] into that man's life right
[1:54:07] there my goodness it happened all at
[1:54:10] once right there with him but to think
[1:54:11] of even the prophet listen now is
[1:54:13] everybody okay amen yes this is so
[1:54:16] struck me in that message Redeemer and
[1:54:18] Redemption a lot of those messages I've
[1:54:19] just continued to listen to Listen to
[1:54:21] and brother BR said this message
[1:54:22] Redeemer and Redemption he said when God
[1:54:24] began to deal with my heart and I knew
[1:54:26] that I was a sinner he said you know
[1:54:27] what the sad part about it was I
[1:54:29] couldn't find a church that even would
[1:54:31] make an altar
[1:54:33] call he said I didn't even know how to
[1:54:35] get right with God he said I didn't know
[1:54:38] how he said with what was being dealt
[1:54:40] with in my heart he said all they talked
[1:54:42] about was the bridge being built across
[1:54:44] the river and they talked about this he
[1:54:46] said but one day he said it finally came
[1:54:48] to a place he said by Church wouldn't
[1:54:50] make an altar call the place I went he
[1:54:52] said I wrote a letter he said I don't
[1:54:54] know even how to approach you but he
[1:54:56] said God if you're real Hallelujah Lord
[1:55:01] make yourself known to me he knew it was
[1:55:04] real but he sought him out you see what
[1:55:06] it was it was the goodness of God that
[1:55:08] led him to repentance friends I
[1:55:11] understand we want to grow we should
[1:55:13] continue to grow in the word what a
[1:55:15] responsibility we want to go on to
[1:55:17] Perfection but let us never ever get
[1:55:20] away from a moment when there is a heart
[1:55:22] being touched by the voice of God that
[1:55:24] they're being drawn down to a place of
[1:55:27] repentance where you and I have already
[1:55:29] come to to meet him at the foot of the
[1:55:31] cross May there always be that place
[1:55:34] where he is lifted up where everyone
[1:55:36] that might be guilty might be under
[1:55:38] situations where they don't know that
[1:55:41] their sins have already been forgiven
[1:55:43] them that they don't know that there's
[1:55:45] one who's already paid away made away
[1:55:48] and paid the price shed his blood where
[1:55:51] they don't know that but where he comes
[1:55:53] in and makes himself known to them that
[1:55:56] I am your sin
[1:55:58] Bearer I am the pardoning power of
[1:56:02] divine grace for your life
[1:56:05] amen where am I going to find him at
[1:56:08] Naomi you'll find him in the threshing
[1:56:11] floor
[1:56:13] amen that's where you'll find
[1:56:18] him but
[1:56:20] Ruth when you go down there to that
[1:56:23] floor this is how I want you to go you
[1:56:26] must go this right
[1:56:29] way you need to wash yourself
[1:56:33] first what do you mean now me well you
[1:56:36] know the word that you've been setting
[1:56:39] under let it wash you yeah come on now
[1:56:43] it's preparing you to meet him who is
[1:56:47] the word cuz you see you and I would not
[1:56:50] be able to have what's needed to prepare
[1:56:51] ourselves to meet what he's required so
[1:56:55] he's provided Esther all that we have
[1:56:57] need
[1:56:59] of and then I want you to get your
[1:57:02] garment I want you to get the best
[1:57:04] garment you've
[1:57:06] got and I want you to cover
[1:57:09] yourself Hallelujah I want you to
[1:57:11] remember I can't go into this here
[1:57:13] today but her approach to that floor was
[1:57:17] not to be
[1:57:19] seductive this was a divine
[1:57:22] approach because she's already been in a
[1:57:25] courtship as it were getting to know the
[1:57:28] character of Boaz yes so she's coming to
[1:57:33] a place she says I want to know how look
[1:57:36] look what's drawing out of her life at
[1:57:37] that time how do I submit myself how do
[1:57:41] how do I go and ask for the right for
[1:57:45] him Hallelujah to be My Kinsman because
[1:57:48] that's who he is but how do I do that
[1:57:52] wash
[1:57:53] yourself and cover yourself up and
[1:57:57] present yourself right at his feet don't
[1:58:00] just lay anywhere get to his
[1:58:03] feet and when you get to his feet
[1:58:05] remember she said Mark the place where
[1:58:09] he's laying I'm out of time I'm way out
[1:58:11] of time Mark the place where he's
[1:58:16] laying and go and lay down at his feet L
[1:58:23] you know what that means don't go lay
[1:58:26] down right there at his midsection by
[1:58:28] his rib but go lay down at his
[1:58:32] feet you know what that signifies this
[1:58:35] word this character that I've been in
[1:58:37] the presence of that's been speaking to
[1:58:40] my life there's been a confidence that's
[1:58:43] been built she's watched how Boaz has
[1:58:46] cared for her right she's every day
[1:58:50] those handfuls of purpose
[1:58:52] she's caught the refreshment when she's
[1:58:55] been parched she has had his hand
[1:58:58] extended with barley cakes she has
[1:59:02] caught his kindness and it has built
[1:59:05] confidence in him of what he sees in
[1:59:09] her and it's led her to a place to say I
[1:59:13] want the word to be the headship
[1:59:16] Hallelujah of my
[1:59:18] life I'm willing to lay my life
[1:59:22] down yes that he might be my ruler my
[1:59:28] head my leader Amen to lead me into all
[1:59:35] righteousness to lead me through all the
[1:59:37] trials and test of life I I'm not even
[1:59:39] focused on that but I know he'll be
[1:59:41] right there with me I've Got Confidence
[1:59:45] and that's what that was she had
[1:59:47] confidence to come and lay herself down
[1:59:50] and Mark the place where he's
[1:59:54] laying I wonder even here tonight you
[1:59:57] know this morning for us maybe there's
[1:59:59] one in here you haven't marked the
[2:00:01] place but you know when you mark the
[2:00:04] place in your heart where he laid down a
[2:00:06] Calvary where he's he's laid down
[2:00:08] there's been a death to self a dying out
[2:00:12] to self that he's all I want he's all I
[2:00:14] want he's all that I need and you know
[2:00:17] that dying out it just is not one time
[2:00:20] the Bible said take up our cross
[2:00:23] daily sir daily it's daily at his feet
[2:00:29] when Lazarus was raised from the grave
[2:00:32] look over a chapter or two the next time
[2:00:34] that you find Lazarus mentioned he's at
[2:00:36] the feet of
[2:00:39] Jesus at his feet that's where we want

[2:00:49] this to be the amen of my life that's

[2:00:56] they they that will inhabit that City
[2:00:58] are they who bless themselves in the god
[2:01:00] of Truth and that phrase means the god
[2:01:03] of the amen those who will walk in the

[2:12:15] Lord being right here Among Us Lord to
[2:12:18] lead
[2:12:19] us to keep us in the
[2:12:21] away Lord we need you this message has
[2:12:25] not made us smarter it brings the
[2:12:27] realization we're sheep we need our
[2:12:33] Shepherd oh
[2:12:35] God I think of how your Prophet said
[2:12:39] [Music]
[2:12:42] Lord he said let me so live in that
[2:12:49] word till my word
[2:12:52] and his word becomes the selfsame
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:57] thing so live by the word till we become
[2:13:02] the
[2:13:04] word Lord God there's pressures I know
[2:13:08] there's pressures all around us there's
[2:13:10] pressures that want to pull us into that
[2:13:11] realm of reasoning like we've been
[2:13:13] looking at Lord in our midweek services
[2:13:15] in imagination but
[2:13:17] God help us Lord we want to walk by the
[2:13:22] counsel of the
[2:13:24] Lord You've not left us in this hour to
[2:13:29] wonder to try to figure our way
[2:13:32] out but God you sent us a
[2:13:36] message
[2:13:39] Vindicated with your
[2:13:42] presence Lord here you are among us
[2:13:46] living in US
[2:13:48] Lord I wonder here this morning
[2:13:52] I know we've had I know we've a little
[2:13:54] bit of time but I wonder here this
[2:13:55] morning think back on what you can lift
[2:13:58] your heads
[2:14:00] up think back on what was said even in
[2:14:03] this morning because it really I think
[2:14:04] it overlaid a lot of it the way the Lord
[2:14:06] took
[2:14:08] it you know the greatest way we can
[2:14:10] honor this
[2:14:12] message we could have pictures and I
[2:14:15] thank God for the pictures don't you
[2:14:18] picture of the pillar of fire yeah
[2:14:20] because as the Prophet said he had his
[2:14:22] picture taken with us that's yes
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:28] sir but I think every one of us right
[2:14:31] here this morning I don't think there's
[2:14:32] anybody that would say I don't want more
[2:14:35] of God I think every one of our hearts
[2:14:38] would say I want
[2:14:39] more of God I I I want I want him to be
[2:14:44] the influencer of my life cuz we're
[2:14:46] living in an age right where everybody
[2:14:49] they've got people who actually make a
[2:14:50] living as young people called
[2:14:52] influencers yeah right there you go if
[2:14:55] they wear you know if they shave off
[2:14:57] this eyebrow and then there's other
[2:14:58] people going to shave it off it's really
[2:15:00] nothing new it's been going on yeah
[2:15:02] somebody wears a green shoe red shoe
[2:15:04] then somebody else and now it's just
[2:15:07] spread throughout the world it don't
[2:15:08] matter if you live in 10 Buck two or you
[2:15:10] live in City it it the worldwide web
[2:15:13] that's right people get stuck in
[2:15:16] influencers yes right but think about
[2:15:20] this
[2:15:23] I don't want my
[2:15:25] opinions that's why I said when someone
[2:15:27] says oh that's brother Ram's opinion
[2:15:29] I'll take his opinion any day over your
[2:15:33] opinion when you tell me that you've
[2:15:36] just told me I don't need to hear you no
[2:15:39] more soon as you say
[2:15:42] that because to
[2:15:44] me I'm talking about a man whom God
[2:15:47] stood next
[2:15:49] to and there are things that God would
[2:15:51] allow him to see that though I may not
[2:15:53] understand but I will heed to the
[2:15:56] counsel that was given because I know
[2:15:58] it's
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:16:00] safety
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:05] right oh my there's a lot right now but
[2:16:07] I'm just I want to just say it in this
[2:16:11] way I want him to be the complete
[2:16:13] influence of my
[2:16:15] home but Sam what are you saying Joshua
[2:16:19] Moses was mentioned 51 times in the Book
[2:16:23] of Judges four
[2:16:26] times I want this
[2:16:28] message to Prevail in my life and in my
[2:16:33] home I believe it is but with that right
[2:16:35] there God bringing us to that
[2:16:36] realization friends in the dark hour
[2:16:38] that we're living in if we ever needed
[2:16:40] the light of God to shine upon our life
[2:16:43] it's right now and let me just tell you
[2:16:45] something it ain't light out there but
[2:16:46] it's light in Goan
[2:16:49] yes there's light right in our
[2:16:52] dwellings yes amen and to
[2:16:56] me I feel safe standing on this
[2:17:01] message I'm I'm not trying to hold you I
[2:17:03] just want you to see
[2:17:04] this there was a man I just had stood
[2:17:07] and I had ministered years ago some
[2:17:09] years ago I stood and I ministered the
[2:17:11] opening meeting in his
[2:17:14] convention when I got in the back office
[2:17:17] the things that was said to me in the
[2:17:19] back office I thought Lord have mercy
[2:17:21] what what what did I
[2:17:25] do come to find out that Pastor was on
[2:17:28] his way out of the
[2:17:30] message
[2:17:32] wow very incredible the things that was
[2:17:35] said but when I got home from those
[2:17:39] meetings I got a call early in the
[2:17:42] morning and I thought 8:00
[2:17:46] a.m. and it called me and begin to talk
[2:17:49] to me about all of the problems and
[2:17:50] everything going on within his church
[2:17:54] the very first thing that I could look
[2:17:55] at and say is is you've cost
[2:17:59] him when you start questioning the
[2:18:03] message yeah there you
[2:18:06] go you see this is why when someone says
[2:18:09] and they want to take this position
[2:18:11] behind the pull pit and said that's
[2:18:12] brother bram's opinion you know what
[2:18:13] it's trying to do replace the
[2:18:17] absolute with themselves that's right
[2:18:20] I'm going back there I have come out of
[2:18:22] Egypt I'm not going
[2:18:25] back not going back not going
[2:18:29] back that's why I can tell you right now
[2:18:32] if I hear those things and someone has
[2:18:34] preached things like that you won't
[2:18:35] stand behind this pull
[2:18:37] pit because I don't want to hear your
[2:18:40] opinions it wasn't no man's opinions
[2:18:42] that changed my life it was the word of
[2:18:45] God spoken through the prophet of God
[2:18:49] [Music]
[2:18:52] and as I got off the phone there's
[2:18:54] things that you know just like if you
[2:18:56] called me for for advice or we set back
[2:19:00] there I don't pull things out of thin
[2:19:02] air no but neither do I know where to go
[2:19:05] unless he'll guide me brother Aaron as I
[2:19:08] was sitting there talking and and it was
[2:19:10] it come to such a place to where I
[2:19:12] realized at that time I can't even refer
[2:19:14] to him to a quote and then from a quote
[2:19:16] I'll take you right into the scripture I
[2:19:17] don't just have to have quotes I can
[2:19:18] show you right through the scriptures
[2:19:20] but I I realized and I began to talk to
[2:19:22] him about certain things and as soon as
[2:19:24] I hung up the phone the spirit of God
[2:19:27] came right there in the office and said
[2:19:29] the authority of the word has been
[2:19:31] lifted from this
[2:19:33] assembly talking about that church wow
[2:19:38] wow and it wasn't but but a month and
[2:19:41] two weeks
