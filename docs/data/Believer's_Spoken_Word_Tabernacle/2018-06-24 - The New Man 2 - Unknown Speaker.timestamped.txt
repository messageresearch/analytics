[41:59] it's good to be in the house of the Lord

[42:02] just asked you if you but a Giri coming
[42:08] in here leave tomorrow and Lord willing
[42:11] gonna have him to speak here for us next
[42:18] next Sunday I asked you just to remember
[42:20] not only that service but the whole
[42:23] believers youth camp down there and I
[42:27] think it's in Indiana where they have it
[42:29] Lord willing we will be ministering
[42:32] there Sunday to services so you're just
[42:37] looking for the Lord just to move
[42:39] throughout that camp amen that God will
[42:42] just really really move upon the hearts
[42:45] and lives of the young people amen so we
[42:51] just we want to look into the word this
[42:53] morning let's look at verse 9 and we'll
[42:57] just read a few verses of Scripture and
[42:59] then we'll just let you have your seats
[43:02] Colossians 2 verse 9 for in him dwelleth
[43:07] all the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[43:13] verse 10 and ye are complete in him I
[43:20] love those words said by those sent me I
[43:24] see so much lacking in me right now but
[43:28] ye are complete in him so how do I move
[43:33] from lacking to complete and lets us
[43:35] know this is our resource there's
[43:38] nothing else that brought this change
[43:40] and light change of life within us and
[43:43] that completion every leaf every apple
[43:47] is already in that seed when the
[43:51] quickening power has moved upon that
[43:53] scene every leaf every attribute is
[43:58] already there every every virtue it's
[44:02] already there but it is him that brings
[44:05] forth
[44:06] this from our life ye are complete in
[44:10] him which is the head of all
[44:14] principality and power in whom also ye
[44:18] are circumcised with the circumcision
[44:20] made without hands in putting off the
[44:25] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[44:29] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[44:33] in Baptism you don't bury people that
[44:36] are alive
[44:38] is that right I mean I hear stories
[44:41] about those things sometimes were but in
[44:43] reality you don't you don't bury anybody
[44:45] who's still alive buried with him in
[44:51] Baptism wherein also ye are risen with
[44:56] him through the faith of the operation
[45:00] of God who hath raised him from the dead
[45:04] and you being dead in your sins and the
[45:08] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[45:12] quickened together with him having
[45:14] forgiven you all trespasses may God
[45:19] bless you bless the reading of his word
[45:21] as you're being seated I want to
[45:25] continue to look at this thought this
[45:26] morning on the new man I want to draw
[45:31] your attention back if you will to verse
[45:33] 11 where in that Paul would say ye are
[45:39] circumcised with a circumcision made
[45:43] without hands in putting off the body of
[45:49] the sins of the flesh by the
[45:53] circumcision of Christ once you notice
[45:56] how Paul places this where this
[45:59] circumcision of Christ has actually
[46:03] brought us to a place of putting off the
[46:06] body of the sins of the flesh Paul makes
[46:10] it very very clear and very evident that
[46:13] there is been a change the first nature
[46:17] the first man
[46:19] he's died he's dead and Paul makes it
[46:23] very clear that this right here that has
[46:26] come forth has been borne by the
[46:28] circumcision of the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:32] but I want you to notice within this
[46:35] here as he says I've put off of putting
[46:38] off of this body of the sins of the
[46:41] flesh and yet I'm still looking at you
[46:44] in your body you're still looking at me
[46:48] in my body and yet this body itself is
[46:52] only a representation or it can only
[46:55] bear the image of the life that's on the
[46:59] inside of it so Paul would place it here
[47:03] that by the circumcision of Christ that
[47:06] by the indwelling of God's Holy Spirit
[47:09] the body itself is rendered powerless
[47:14] what you think of this it's rendered
[47:17] powerless we have received an authority
[47:21] over this vessel that we now live in we
[47:27] have received an authority within this
[47:29] now watch out brother brand places this
[47:31] here in souls that are in prison now
[47:33] he said now the soul of man is not the
[47:37] body of man it's the soul and the soul
[47:40] is something that's the nature of the
[47:43] spirit and when the nature of a man when
[47:45] he said we are dead the scripture
[47:48] plainly tells us that we are dead and
[47:51] our lives are HID in God through Christ
[47:54] sealed there by the Holy Spirit
[47:57] watch these words very closely now it
[48:00] wasn't your body died that it wasn't
[48:04] that your body died it wasn't your
[48:07] spirit died it was the nature of your
[48:10] spirit died see the nature which is the
[48:13] soul the nature of your soul is God if
[48:17] you're born again if it's not it's of
[48:18] the world anything that began has to end
[48:22] now watch I separates this so therefore
[48:25] the only way that you can have eternal
[48:27] life is to have a life that never did
[48:31] begin
[48:32] and then your life did begin when you
[48:36] were born when God breathed the breath
[48:38] of life into your nostrils and you
[48:40] became a living soul then you begin then
[48:43] so he's bringing it in that second part
[48:46] that we read of our natural birth
[48:49] so God here it's through and by the
[48:51] breath of life that you and I we come
[48:54] into this we come into this world and we
[48:57] know we're conceived between man and
[48:59] woman but yet it is and it is an act of
[49:01] God we're in that God Himself brings
[49:04] forth life but yet in order for us to
[49:07] have eternal life it speaks of a life
[49:09] itself
[49:10] that never ever did begin to really
[49:13] understand this this is something that
[49:15] goes beyond our minds and us being able
[49:17] to so place it or put things together
[49:20] because all that you and I remember from
[49:23] as far back as you can remember maybe
[49:25] you can remember when you know this
[49:27] certain little thing when you were four
[49:28] years old or some other times sometimes
[49:31] it's very hard to remember certain
[49:33] things and yet that's as far back as
[49:35] your memory in your earliest memory or
[49:37] what it can go to but yet within that
[49:40] part that has been deposited within our
[49:43] lives that when you and I come into this
[49:45] earth here think of it of how that God
[49:48] knew our I caller
[49:49] God knew our hair color God knew
[49:51] everything but yet the way that we came
[49:53] through and by the natural birth the way
[49:56] that this body came was not in the way
[49:58] that God intended for it to come because
[50:01] the way that it comes it still breaks
[50:03] down the way that it comes embarrassed
[50:05] of how the aging in the process it also
[50:08] packs within at every abstract it packs
[50:16] within that and this is why that when
[50:18] there is not only a need for the new
[50:21] birth within our soul but there is a
[50:23] need for this body to be born again so
[50:27] in the meantime how that the Spirit of
[50:29] God would move down and that seed as
[50:32] we've looked at it throughout the course
[50:33] of time that seed was placed within us
[50:36] when we took that breath of life that
[50:38] seed was laying there within us the
[50:40] whole time of God's choosing but then
[50:42] how that God would bring us to
[50:45] him and he would he made a way that you
[50:47] and I would be actually able to die to
[50:50] ourselves and that he would be able to
[50:53] raise up that seed that son that
[50:56] daughter that he sowed on the inside and
[50:59] to think of it that God did not kill the
[51:01] body God did not kill the spirit but it
[51:04] is actually the nature of the spirit
[51:07] that dies so there is a change that
[51:10] takes place you see that's why that we
[51:12] can look at things and there can be all
[51:14] kinds of changes that a person can do
[51:16] out here but those changes will fade
[51:18] those changes that can be made it it
[51:21] shows look at it even when you look at
[51:23] things that can be done where I will do
[51:26] this or I will do that but yet when it
[51:28] moves to the inside this is where it
[51:31] really has to have the beginning because
[51:33] the wreaths are not out here the wreath
[51:36] is down on the inside so it actually has
[51:39] to be routed out from the inside now
[51:42] look out the brother Graham goes on
[51:44] within this he says that nature that was
[51:47] in you by nature was of the world you
[51:51] were alienated from God you were
[51:53] actually an animal anyone knows that we
[51:57] are mammals that how many knows that we
[51:58] are mammal we are warm-blooded animal
[52:01] but that is what we are by our earthly
[52:03] creation but what made us different from
[52:06] other mammals that God put a soul upon
[52:10] us now the other mammals don't have to
[52:12] wear clothes no other animal has to wear
[52:14] clothes to hide his shame but us were
[52:16] the only ones that does because we have
[52:18] a soul but see God in the beginning knew
[52:21] what a man would be like and he created
[52:24] the earth and brought up all kinds of
[52:25] animals from the very lowest to the
[52:28] highest
[52:28] and the highest animal come forth was
[52:31] man now to think of how that where Paul
[52:33] would replace this that by the
[52:36] circumcision that whereby we are
[52:38] separated from our first birth or our
[52:41] first Union and we are reborn or
[52:45] regenerated by the renewing of the Holy
[52:48] Spirit by that washing of regeneration
[52:50] remember in the scripture where Paul
[52:52] would would bring this down to it and
[52:54] think of how that once the fall had come
[52:57] that God made
[52:58] way that we're aware a person could come
[53:01] and be able to stand in his presence but
[53:04] the only way that that could be would be
[53:06] was there had to be a blood a life that
[53:09] was shed an innocent life and we see
[53:11] that clear back there in the Garden of
[53:13] Eden where God took that life of an
[53:15] innocent one and he clothed them with
[53:18] those garments so God when they were
[53:20] clothed with those garments think of it
[53:22] those garments themselves that they were
[53:24] clothed with were tied to what was spoke
[53:27] of in that was an innocent lamb that was
[53:30] there so their their clothing of what
[53:32] they were clothed with it's spoke of the
[53:35] innocency of that life that had been
[53:37] taken yet within animal life because
[53:40] animal doesn't have soul it is not a
[53:42] nature that is there to be able to come
[53:45] back upon the worshipper and bring about
[53:48] a real change and this is where that
[53:50] Paul would say in the book of Hebrews
[53:53] chapter 10 I believe it is where Paul
[53:55] would speak of how that all of those
[53:57] things they had a shadow they were a
[54:00] shadow and only thing they spoke of is
[54:02] they spoke of that true image that was
[54:05] to come but yet they were not the
[54:07] perfect image because those could only
[54:09] cover a man could you know a man would
[54:12] come and he would offer up the sacrifice
[54:15] but he left back out with the same
[54:17] desires within his life but once that
[54:20] through and by the shed blood where God
[54:23] became one of us then there is an
[54:26] atonement there is a debt that has been
[54:28] paid that the very life that was within
[54:31] the very body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:34] that life might come back upon the
[54:36] worshiper and this is why over and over
[54:39] even and through the scriptures of how
[54:41] that Paul would reach back under the
[54:43] inspiration of God and pick it up there
[54:46] and he would speak of how that where God
[54:49] spoke through David that when he
[54:51] bringeth his only-begotten into the
[54:53] world he saith unto him sacrifice and
[54:56] offering that would it's not but up body
[54:58] thou hast prepared for me there had to
[55:01] be there had to be a lamb a body that
[55:04] was prepared for him in order to come
[55:07] and to pay that price and know
[55:09] how that that you know it would go on to
[55:11] say in the scriptures in Romans seven
[55:13] for it would speak of how that my
[55:16] brethren ye are also become dead to the
[55:19] law by the body of Christ we're without
[55:23] the body without there being an offering
[55:26] up of the Lamb think of this God became
[55:29] one of us they had he had to become one
[55:33] of us that through and by he is offering
[55:35] up we could become dead to the law by
[55:39] the body of Christ that allows you and I
[55:41] so that you and I might be able to die
[55:44] to ourselves think of it like this of
[55:47] how the scripture says in Romans eight
[55:49] verse three what the law could not do in
[55:52] that it was weak through the flesh God
[55:54] sending his own son in the likeness of
[55:58] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[56:02] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[56:05] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[56:08] walk not after the flesh but after the
[56:11] spirit so we are become dead to the law
[56:15] I love that that word dead means you
[56:18] become it's a loosened yeah it's
[56:20] rendered extinct and you know how it is
[56:22] even here in the state of Ohio they've
[56:25] got things that they put you know in
[56:26] their little booklets you you pick up
[56:28] for the new hunting season and they'll
[56:30] sometimes they'll update they'll move
[56:32] things from where it's on a watch list
[56:35] and from an endangered list and from a
[56:37] protected list and then they'll move it
[56:39] to a list that can be hunted and when
[56:42] you know it's on a protected list you
[56:43] can't hunt it because here they want it
[56:46] to blossom within this state so there's
[56:49] got a protection that's upon it I want
[56:51] you to think of this with what God
[56:53] Himself that's done within the life of
[56:56] the believer I tell you by the working
[56:58] of the Holy Spirit he is rendering
[57:01] extinct that first birth and he is
[57:04] continuing to work till eventually as we
[57:06] stand there on that day when this life
[57:09] has been fully developed in this life
[57:13] here and the transplanting it will be a
[57:16] rendering of extinction
[57:19] won't that be glorious there will not be
[57:21] any hole brother Brian why do you do
[57:23] this so brother just well why do you do
[57:24] this or brother done there won't be any
[57:26] of that because it won't be them doing
[57:28] those things neither will it be the
[57:30] buttons inside of me or you that's being
[57:33] pushed Laurie so the body he he became
[57:36] one of us that we might become rendered
[57:39] extinct or become dead to the law all
[57:43] glory be to God now let's look at this
[57:45] here just a moment on this on
[57:47] circumcision and the circumcision
[57:49] because when we look at it through the
[57:51] word we know that God placed the
[57:54] circumcision in many places of the
[57:56] scripture and I'm not going to read all
[57:58] of them I just refer to many of the
[58:00] places but to know how that God would
[58:03] even speak of it in the Book of
[58:04] Leviticus and of how that the manchild
[58:07] that he when he was born he was to be
[58:10] circumcised on the eighth day think of
[58:14] how that God God gave this to to Abraham
[58:17] and this this sign of circumcision was a
[58:20] sign in the flesh and I think of this
[58:22] Abraham already had faith all along
[58:25] are you listening he already had faith
[58:28] you see at God it comes to a place to
[58:32] where that God will recognize that faith
[58:35] and God has accepted that faith and then
[58:38] there's a circumcising there's a cutting
[58:41] away of the surplus flesh but notice it
[58:43] could not be done just any day it had to
[58:48] be done on the eighth day because eighth
[58:51] day is a new beginning and day is new
[58:54] life it was on the eighth day that our
[58:57] Lord Jesus Christ was raised from the
[58:59] grief on the first day of the week it's
[59:02] showing that through and by this was a
[59:04] tie that was pointing that by the
[59:07] circumcision of the Holy Ghost that
[59:09] without hands that God would bring forth
[59:12] his children better born in his house
[59:14] and that sign of the Holy Ghost the
[59:17] circumcision it places us within the
[59:20] Covenant of which we were always a part
[59:22] of it Isaac was always a part of the
[59:25] Covenant are you with me Isaac was
[59:27] always who God had in
[59:29] but notice there had to come Isaac had
[59:32] to come and then here had to be a
[59:34] circumcising in Isaac's life let me say
[59:37] it like this as the Prophet said in the
[59:39] message future hope you were always
[59:41] saved you will always say you are always
[59:46] a part of the Covenant but you had to
[59:49] come his provided way and the made of
[59:53] provided way so the you and I could come
[59:56] back and it's him bringing us back to
[59:58] where that we always were it's him it's
[1:00:04] him and he's breeding back sons and
[1:00:06] daughters of God the only way you can
[1:00:10] breed something back you have to have
[1:00:11] corresponding parts so here the see that
[1:00:15] lay within that life when the flow of
[1:00:18] the water of the Spirit of God the
[1:00:20] washing of regeneration the preaching of
[1:00:23] the word the ministering of that word it
[1:00:26] begins to draw and call the believer and
[1:00:28] it brings the believer from from where
[1:00:30] they are into a union with the Lord
[1:00:33] Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that he
[1:00:36] was raised on the eighth day so there
[1:00:38] was a circumcising so when Paul picks
[1:00:41] this up in Romans chapter 2 verse 25 he
[1:00:44] said circumcision verily profiteth if
[1:00:48] thou keep the law but if thou be a
[1:00:50] breaker of the law by circumcision is
[1:00:53] made uncircumcision now to think of this
[1:00:56] Paul is dealing with in throughout each
[1:00:59] one of these letters when you read you
[1:01:01] read as a Bible reader in Romans and
[1:01:03] Galatians and Colossians and on and on
[1:01:05] you find that each one of them there
[1:01:07] were Judaizers or others that would come
[1:01:10] around Paul called him in one place
[1:01:12] false brethren that were coming around
[1:01:14] and stirring up the people but what they
[1:01:16] were trying to do is take the people
[1:01:18] back to an Old Testament form of worship
[1:01:21] and remember this opening text that I
[1:01:24] read tiata cautions to Paul is dealing
[1:01:26] with the contrast between God's
[1:01:29] indwelling life whereby we are complete
[1:01:32] in him and he's contrasting that with
[1:01:34] others who themselves present unto God
[1:01:37] worship by their own
[1:01:39] and he is contrasting that to show that
[1:01:42] it's we do not worship God by our own
[1:01:45] will our own offerings but we worship
[1:01:48] Him through him by His divine will
[1:01:51] through him by the divine perfect
[1:01:54] sacrifice that brings us to that place
[1:01:56] because you and I have nothing to offer
[1:01:58] God the only thing that we can offer is
[1:02:01] our life and that's all he wants from us
[1:02:04] is our life then he himself imparts his
[1:02:06] life in us and transforms us in this
[1:02:10] life aren't you glad therefore verse 26
[1:02:15] if the uncircumcision keep the
[1:02:18] righteousness of the law now think a
[1:02:20] look out he's saying here if the
[1:02:22] uncircumcision keep the righteousness of
[1:02:25] the law shall not his uncircumcision be
[1:02:29] counted for circumcision and shall not
[1:02:34] uncircumcision which is by nature if it
[1:02:38] fulfill the law judge thee who by the
[1:02:41] letter and circumcision dust transgress
[1:02:44] the law suppose dealing with it deeper
[1:02:48] because even in this time you know there
[1:02:51] are those that could say well I've been
[1:02:53] circumcised but Paul's letting them know
[1:02:54] that was given they're in a covenant
[1:02:58] this is a type this is a shadow but he's
[1:03:01] letting them know that still within your
[1:03:03] nature you might be circumcised in your
[1:03:05] body but your nature is still
[1:03:07] uncircumcised so he's letting them know
[1:03:10] there's been a change that has taken
[1:03:12] place this is not just a sign within the
[1:03:14] flesh
[1:03:15] but there is an actual change that takes
[1:03:17] place on the inside we're wearing that
[1:03:20] we as Gentiles who were of the
[1:03:22] uncircumcision but now through and by
[1:03:25] the Holy Spirit we have been circumcised
[1:03:28] or brought into the Covenant by the man
[1:03:31] Christ Jesus are you listening
[1:03:35] we have been brought in by marriage
[1:03:38] Union into the Covenant by the man
[1:03:41] Christ Jesus and shall not
[1:03:44] uncircumcision which is by nature if it
[1:03:46] fulfilled the law judge D who by the
[1:03:49] letter and circumcision does transgress
[1:03:51] the law
[1:03:52] or he is not a Jew which is one
[1:03:55] outwardly Wow I tell you what man Paul
[1:03:59] is this must have been a stir I mean
[1:04:03] when he's making this known within this
[1:04:05] time he's wonder what it is he's not
[1:04:08] trying to put him down he's trying to
[1:04:10] show them a real true Liberty but
[1:04:14] they're still walking with listen
[1:04:16] whether or not these people themselves
[1:04:18] have been regenerated or not listen to
[1:04:21] me closely now if even when they have
[1:04:23] been regenerated if they still within
[1:04:26] their minds have not been washed and
[1:04:28] cleansed by the washing of water by the
[1:04:30] word although they have been renewed
[1:04:32] from within but if they're within the
[1:04:35] washing of water by the word to actually
[1:04:37] remove from them traditions and ideas
[1:04:40] that would still be there in that spirit
[1:04:42] realm we all know what I'm talking about
[1:04:44] we this is why we need that washing of
[1:04:47] water by the word it's to cleanse out
[1:04:49] our ideas our traditions we need that
[1:04:54] washing of water by the word and this is
[1:04:58] why the ministering of the word why Paul
[1:05:00] himself why would he deal with marriages
[1:05:02] why would Paul deal with all these
[1:05:04] things if it was so be that once you're
[1:05:07] born again you don't need any more
[1:05:09] instruction you don't need to be taught
[1:05:11] anymore but that is not true but the
[1:05:13] Spirit of God what to see ministering to
[1:05:15] he's ministering to the man down on the
[1:05:18] inside because many times there's things
[1:05:21] that we could be taught that if we allow
[1:05:23] that to be and things don't happen
[1:05:25] according to that way it will trouble us
[1:05:28] you understand what I'm saying it's just
[1:05:30] like certain things that people have to
[1:05:32] believe so sir service has to go a
[1:05:34] certain way and if a service doesn't go
[1:05:36] a certain way because it doesn't go a
[1:05:37] certain way or we've really not met God
[1:05:39] and see it is a tradition it is a form
[1:05:43] or an idea let me tell you something God
[1:05:45] meets you and I even write while the
[1:05:48] word is coming forth he'll meet you
[1:05:50] right there in your heart and in your
[1:05:52] mind God will deal right there in your
[1:05:55] life then there's other times that God
[1:05:58] may be at the end of a service it may be
[1:06:00] an altar call it's called sometimes
[1:06:02] maybe it's just the Spirit of God will
[1:06:03] move on your heart and you feel like you
[1:06:05] know what
[1:06:06] got to walk out of this seat right here
[1:06:07] and I'm gonna come up here and pray what
[1:06:09] that's God that's between you and God
[1:06:11] you understand what I'm saying
[1:06:13] it is a washing of ideas and this is
[1:06:16] where Paul while you say why would that
[1:06:18] be necessary because God is not just
[1:06:21] interested in you and I being planted we
[1:06:25] must be established
[1:06:27] not just planted for he is not a Jew
[1:06:32] which is one outwardly neither is that
[1:06:35] circumcision which is outward in the
[1:06:37] flesh but he is a Jew which is one
[1:06:40] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:06:44] heart in the spirit and not in the
[1:06:46] letter whose praise is not of men but of
[1:06:49] God Abraham father of the faith was a
[1:06:55] Gentile who exactly right he was a
[1:07:00] Gentile but notice the designation
[1:07:04] became Jew when it were Abraham remember
[1:07:07] in the book of Genesis chapter 15 when
[1:07:10] the lot was taken captive it says he
[1:07:13] came and he told Abraham the Hebrew and
[1:07:16] the word Hebrew was a designation that
[1:07:19] speaks one from beyond one from the all
[1:07:25] glory be to God so Paul is dealing with
[1:07:28] this here but a Jew it's not one who is
[1:07:30] one outwardly but it's one who is one
[1:07:33] inwardly and he moves it to where it's
[1:07:36] the circumcision of the heart in the
[1:07:38] spirit not in the letter whose praise is
[1:07:41] not of men but of God I'm ask you this
[1:07:45] question there are things that can take
[1:07:48] place right here while the words going
[1:07:49] forth one tree even when maybe you're
[1:07:51] out you're going down the street you
[1:07:53] might be sitting in the car with your
[1:07:55] children or whatever more and somebody
[1:07:57] comes right across you maybe there's
[1:07:59] something that is said or done and there
[1:08:01] is nothing that is seen visibly but on
[1:08:04] the inside oh my how that Satan can
[1:08:06] suggest and it can work from the outside
[1:08:09] to the inside
[1:08:10] but that inside man when that white dog
[1:08:12] is strengthened up in the word that
[1:08:14] white dog can say get out of here I am
[1:08:16] NOT gonna get angry about
[1:08:18] I am NOT gonna get upset about this now
[1:08:21] who saw that man or God God solid your
[1:08:26] praise is of God there might be nobody
[1:08:29] that knows that nobody that knows what
[1:08:31] victories that you have over come this
[1:08:34] way where you've turned your head where
[1:08:36] you've refused to give in to this but
[1:08:38] your praise is not of men your praises
[1:08:41] of God because it is his righteousness
[1:08:46] that has been sewn into our hearts I
[1:08:48] guarantee it's in there it will reflect
[1:08:51] and manifest itself within our lives
[1:08:55] glory be to God galatians 6:15 for in
[1:08:59] Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:09:01] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:09:06] a new creature
[1:09:10] remember what Paul's dealing with you
[1:09:12] have people who were actually trying to
[1:09:14] compel others to become circumcised then
[1:09:18] Paul deals with it within the book of
[1:09:20] Corinthians cause you had those who were
[1:09:21] circumcised that they started feeling
[1:09:23] guilty and they wanted to become
[1:09:25] uncircumcised that's a study all in
[1:09:28] itself but Paul tells and let every man
[1:09:31] abide in his calling wherewith he was
[1:09:35] called he's letting it be known that it
[1:09:38] is not about your flesh it is the inward
[1:09:42] work of the circumcision of Christ for
[1:09:48] we Philippians 3:3 for we are the
[1:09:50] circumcision which worship God in the
[1:09:53] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus you
[1:09:58] catch that not rejoice in Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] rejoice in Christ Jesus be anointed word
[1:10:05] we are of the circumcision who rejoice
[1:10:09] in the anointed word for our day we have
[1:10:13] been circumcised we have the word
[1:10:15] circumcised is separated we have been
[1:10:18] separated unto God oh my we're not just
[1:10:21] empty vessels but we are less 'old that
[1:10:24] had been circumcised put into service by
[1:10:27] the very power of God himself
[1:10:31] glory and have no have no confidence in
[1:10:35] the flesh can you say amen to that Paul
[1:10:39] here is the prophet of God but Paul was
[1:10:42] very clear we have no confidence in the
[1:10:44] flesh many of the times this is what
[1:10:47] gets us in trouble right here we put we
[1:10:49] start putting too much confidence in the
[1:10:51] flesh but God is there to help us to
[1:10:55] Humble us as a matter of fact he knows
[1:10:58] how that flesh itself it could just
[1:11:00] somehow it could rise but he will give
[1:11:03] thorns to help us aren't you glad for
[1:11:07] that but saying I don't need foreign
[1:11:10] spall headphones he needed him he needed
[1:11:13] him lest he should become POW
[1:11:19] well how in the world if he's been
[1:11:23] delivered and he's been born again
[1:11:25] how could he become proud it wasn't your
[1:11:28] body that died it wasn't your spirit
[1:11:31] that died it was the nature of your
[1:11:36] spirit that died Oh glory be to God
[1:11:41] notice here in the book of Joshua
[1:11:43] chapter 5 verse 9 here when they crossed
[1:11:45] the Jordan River remember here there had
[1:11:48] been a leaving out of a very important
[1:11:51] part of the Covenant they had left off
[1:11:54] circumcising the young but here at the
[1:11:57] crossing of the Jordan and as they
[1:11:59] crossed remember God told Joshua look at
[1:12:02] this now God tells Joshua to tell men to
[1:12:05] take these stones and make sharp knives
[1:12:08] out of them there were stones that were
[1:12:11] there those stones that they would have
[1:12:13] the ability but thereby they could be
[1:12:16] made into sharp stones aren't you glad
[1:12:18] that God can take the promise of the
[1:12:21] word that is laying right here it's
[1:12:23] stones that have been laying here but
[1:12:25] once you cross into the Jordan by the
[1:12:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:30] there is knives these promises
[1:12:32] absolutely sever you separates you from
[1:12:36] the world what is just words to others
[1:12:40] becomes separated
[1:12:43] what is just Jones you say that's the
[1:12:45] sort of the word it is quick and alive
[1:12:48] it has separated me from the reproach of
[1:12:51] Egypt so the new birth the circumcision
[1:12:56] of Christ here without hands this is how
[1:13:00] he could say to Joshua look at this and
[1:13:02] the Lord said unto Joshua he was not
[1:13:05] Joshua just circumcising it was there
[1:13:07] all of those men that were there but
[1:13:09] remember they were there under that
[1:13:11] direction and that word now listen to me
[1:13:12] now as they were under that direction in
[1:13:14] that word look it is not this man that
[1:13:16] did it and this man gave this one a
[1:13:18] birth and this one gave this one a birth
[1:13:20] and Joshua gave this one a birth and
[1:13:22] know that God says the Lord said unto
[1:13:24] Joshua this day have I rolled away the
[1:13:29] reproach of Egypt from off you
[1:13:32] you see it's God the holy ghost himself
[1:13:35] it is him that circumcise our hearts
[1:13:39] it's not a church it's not a man it's
[1:13:41] Christ himself personally that
[1:13:44] circumcised is us unto Him separating us
[1:13:47] from the world and bringing us into the
[1:13:50] Covenant of which we were always a part
[1:13:52] of now think of this here in Colossians
[1:13:58] chapter 3 verse 8 Paul said but now ye
[1:14:08] also put off all these anger wrath
[1:14:15] malice blasphemy filthy communication
[1:14:19] out of your mouth why not one to another
[1:14:23] seeing that she have put off the old man
[1:14:28] with his deeds I want you to watch what
[1:14:31] he's just said put off these also put
[1:14:36] off means lay them aside throw them off
[1:14:40] as clothing that is no longer befitting
[1:14:44] so there happen listen to me now how in
[1:14:47] order for that to be it shows a
[1:14:50] separation within the individual and a
[1:14:53] divine authority to be able
[1:14:56] to put these things off reverse any when
[1:15:00] I put them off does it mean that I won't
[1:15:01] be tested on them no quite the contrary
[1:15:04] you will be tested on them come on now
[1:15:09] but there is a ruling power on the
[1:15:13] inside through and by that of the new
[1:15:15] birth that is we are feeding that new
[1:15:17] man that new man is strong but it's not
[1:15:20] ours
[1:15:21] our strength not our our own human
[1:15:23] servitude it's by his strength David
[1:15:26] said the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:15:32] that's the rapture chapter so seeing
[1:15:36] that you've put off the old man with his
[1:15:38] deeds and have put on or sunk into the
[1:15:43] new man which is renewed in knowledge
[1:15:47] after the image of him that created him
[1:15:52] we are a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:15:58] dwelling in the same old temple but a
[1:16:01] new creation it's a creative work by his
[1:16:06] life moving up on that seat on the
[1:16:09] inside remember when God laid had him to
[1:16:13] sleep
[1:16:14] he opened his side he took out of his
[1:16:17] side of rib and God began to multiply
[1:16:19] cell on top of cell on top of sanity and
[1:16:24] then as it was brought forth in the
[1:16:27] completion of the body she had received
[1:16:30] of his life a life that was original
[1:16:33] that life notice in the body was a
[1:16:36] byproduct but the spirit itself was
[1:16:39] original are you with me and here when
[1:16:43] God divided there that masculine from
[1:16:46] feminine you see there was a part here
[1:16:49] that that had to be fulfilled and
[1:16:51] reflected and manifested within her life
[1:16:54] and that's the same way within your life
[1:16:57] and my life as a believer what you think
[1:17:00] of this what God himself as he sends
[1:17:03] forth his spirit he is actually
[1:17:06] separating what rightfully below
[1:17:09] to him there's only one thing that can
[1:17:12] separate what belongs to you think of it
[1:17:14] here is Abel here is King both of them
[1:17:17] are told and what is proclaimed that
[1:17:19] Adam and Eve both of them this is bull
[1:17:22] right here this is your father this is
[1:17:24] what's proclaimed but it is the
[1:17:26] sacrifice by divine revelation and how
[1:17:29] that the Spirit of God comes down upon
[1:17:32] that and Abel himself obtains a witness
[1:17:35] that he is righteous it is that
[1:17:37] revelation that breaks forth that Abel
[1:17:40] realizes that I am of God Abel
[1:17:45] recognizes that I am of Adam and Adam is
[1:17:49] of God and through that revelation it
[1:17:51] also takes the covering off of who his
[1:17:54] brother is what did that the revelation
[1:18:01] but even when it uncovered came to
[1:18:03] became Abel didn't rise up to kill Cain
[1:18:07] LA because that revelation that has
[1:18:11] moved with enables Hart
[1:18:12] you see it's something that takes place
[1:18:14] within our lives as believers that even
[1:18:16] though that you and I can look at
[1:18:18] circumstances sometimes and we are so
[1:18:21] tempted to try to look at it through
[1:18:23] carnal measures I'll correct this and
[1:18:25] say this and do this and yet you realize
[1:18:27] this is not how we're to live as
[1:18:29] believers and I understand you've got to
[1:18:31] pay bills and do other things but you
[1:18:32] understand I'm talking about things
[1:18:33] within families and other things
[1:18:35] whatsoever these are not things that can
[1:18:37] be handled by just natural means but we
[1:18:40] are people of God that have been born of
[1:18:42] a supernatural we have not been born of
[1:18:45] a supernatural that we might continue to
[1:18:47] live our lives in the natural realm as
[1:18:50] far as living here trapped but it's to
[1:18:52] bring a faith within our life to realize
[1:18:55] when situations arise that he is still
[1:18:58] the same yesterday today and forever -
[1:19:02] we're in a situation it'll look hopeless
[1:19:05] to our eyes but something on the inside
[1:19:08] will say God is still God
[1:19:11] that's the supernatural and it's a
[1:19:16] battle for us not to get trapped down
[1:19:19] here in these census then I'm gonna tell
[1:19:22] you a greater is He that's in you and
[1:19:25] you put on the new man which is renewed
[1:19:28] in knowledge after the image of him that
[1:19:30] created him where there is neither Greek
[1:19:32] nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision
[1:19:37] barbarian Cynthia knew ond nor free but
[1:19:42] Christ is all in all doesn't matter your
[1:19:47] nationality where you come from doesn't
[1:19:50] matter your status in society
[1:19:51] what matters is once you've been born
[1:19:53] again you've been birthed into the
[1:19:55] family of God of which you were always a
[1:19:58] part of but you have just now recognized
[1:20:03] it and when you listen to me when you
[1:20:06] recognizes when you recognize it by the
[1:20:09] indwelling of his power
[1:20:11] it changes your conduct tempted to put
[1:20:17] things on but by the grace of God you
[1:20:20] have strength to put off things and you
[1:20:23] have strength to put on other things
[1:20:25] oh my believe in God brother Babbitt
[1:20:30] says you've got a soul besides your
[1:20:32] senses God never gives you those senses
[1:20:35] to trust him with God give you his
[1:20:37] spirit so that you will trust your
[1:20:39] senses is only to contact see taste feel
[1:20:43] smell in here but to you yourself is
[1:20:46] that spirit that lives into you watch I
[1:20:48] places this and when that's been
[1:20:50] regenerated and the old man died and the
[1:20:54] new man born again that is a part of God
[1:20:57] then you become a son and daughter of
[1:21:01] God
[1:21:01] and offspring of the creator
[1:21:04] then then you can believe the impossible
[1:21:08] things because you're made up of the
[1:21:11] miracle-working God you're a part of him
[1:21:15] glory be to God have not our sin theme
[1:21:19] brother brems says we have needs Lord as
[1:21:22] we go through the world
[1:21:24] this body is still physical still born
[1:21:29] of sin Sunday it'll be born of God but
[1:21:34] today it's born of sin glory
[1:21:39] so here being converted but yet still
[1:21:44] sitting in an old pest house but see
[1:21:49] God's not worried
[1:21:50] once that circumcision has taken place
[1:21:52] on the inside it equips you with
[1:21:55] strength to be able to bring this guy in
[1:21:57] subjection listen to me now it's not for
[1:22:01] you to go on autopilot you must feed
[1:22:06] feed that inner man if you don't feed
[1:22:10] that inner man you'll find weakness
[1:22:12] where you're trying to put things off
[1:22:14] and you say oh I cannot put it off it's
[1:22:16] where who are you feeding see this is
[1:22:21] where you recognize and realize I have
[1:22:23] no confidence in this thing I ain't
[1:22:25] making excuses for I am making no
[1:22:28] excuses for it whatsoever but I realize
[1:22:30] that inside of me there is a power I
[1:22:33] have been circumcised and separated or
[1:22:36] they might say this will come your way
[1:22:38] this is part of your family tree this is
[1:22:40] part of your family tree but you can
[1:22:42] stand there on the word and say but I
[1:22:44] have been been birthed into that tree of
[1:22:47] life and I can expect the strain of that
[1:22:50] life to move inside of me and access
[1:22:54] Authority to put off Romans 6 verse
[1:22:59] Warner what shall we say then shall we
[1:23:04] continue in sin that grace may abound
[1:23:10] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[1:23:17] sin live any longer therein no you not
[1:23:22] that so many of us were baptized into
[1:23:25] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:23:28] death I don't believe that these people
[1:23:34] these believers sitting here I
[1:23:36] do not believe that they did not know
[1:23:38] this and were not taught this before
[1:23:40] they went through water baptism but Paul
[1:23:43] is making a point to them that to
[1:23:46] understand that when you were baptized
[1:23:49] here this was a testimony you see what
[1:23:52] real true water baptism is is to be a
[1:23:56] testimony that I am dead it's not just
[1:24:03] something to where it comes as part of a
[1:24:05] tradition or a formality will we come to
[1:24:07] this church and yeah you know somebody
[1:24:09] said all to get baptized this let me
[1:24:10] tell you something you don't need to go
[1:24:12] by somebody else's word you need to go
[1:24:14] by the working of the Spirit of God that
[1:24:16] moves upon your heart because if not
[1:24:19] you'll go into this tank a wet Center
[1:24:21] hour drive one you'll come up a wet one
[1:24:24] but there's got to be a change on the
[1:24:28] inside this must be such listen if
[1:24:31] there's such a determination to wear
[1:24:33] that a person if it can come to such a
[1:24:35] place of realizing that God who moved
[1:24:38] upon my heart that called me down
[1:24:40] through justification you know why God
[1:24:42] did that him his presence would let you
[1:24:45] know that he's a real living God who
[1:24:47] gives a real living experience that you
[1:24:50] might be like it was when they prepared
[1:24:52] to cross the Jordan they st. to fight
[1:24:54] themselves and made ready for the
[1:24:57] fulfillment of the promise because the
[1:25:00] promise is sure sometimes I know you
[1:25:07] know sometimes you think maybe some well
[1:25:09] but I think about you went too fast or I
[1:25:11] think you went too slow then because
[1:25:12] sometimes there's been situations I look
[1:25:14] at and I said why do you want to be
[1:25:16] baptized I want to know why do you want
[1:25:17] to be baptized because in some
[1:25:19] situations I want to know what's your
[1:25:21] background
[1:25:21] or my Catholic well you're not doing
[1:25:23] this out of rights this is not I go
[1:25:26] through this act and all of a sudden
[1:25:27] something's better no no this is not
[1:25:28] what this is hey brother Sam have you
[1:25:30] actually I've actually told people that
[1:25:32] and held off on things until and they
[1:25:34] themselves I would tell them you pray
[1:25:36] about it and you look my brother Samuel
[1:25:38] that's the word but I wanted to make
[1:25:40] sure because why there is a clear
[1:25:42] expectation it's not just to be baptized
[1:25:46] but the expectation is the real focus is
[1:25:49] to be filled with the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:25:52] telling you God can fill you with the
[1:25:54] Holy Ghost
[1:25:55] right where you're in your seat you can
[1:25:57] be sitting right there and the Prophet
[1:25:59] lifts it very clear in enticing spirits
[1:26:01] God can come right on the scene and do
[1:26:03] everything every night in one sweep so
[1:26:14] verse 4 therefore we are buried with him
[1:26:21] by baptism into his death into death
[1:26:24] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:26:28] the dead by the glory of the Father even
[1:26:31] so we also should walk in newness of
[1:26:37] life
[1:26:39] Paul's admonishing the believers this is
[1:26:41] how were to walk in newness of life what
[1:26:43] other words in verse 5 for if we have
[1:26:45] been planted together in the likeness of
[1:26:49] his death this word planted together
[1:26:50] here means born of the same nature of
[1:26:53] the same kind clung genital receiving of
[1:26:57] the same inherited genes if we have been
[1:27:01] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:27:04] death we shall be also in the likeness
[1:27:08] of his resurrection see what post
[1:27:10] hanging it into if we've been planted in
[1:27:13] the likeness of his death we shall also
[1:27:15] in the resurrection these mortal bodies
[1:27:19] will also be changed what's this this is
[1:27:23] very important verse 6 look at the very
[1:27:28] first two words here what's those first
[1:27:33] two words knowing this knowing this it's
[1:27:42] important to know this this is what
[1:27:46] Paul's saying knowing this knowing not
[1:27:49] because mama told me not because daddy
[1:27:53] told me not because the pastor told me
[1:27:55] but I must know this
[1:27:58] you understand I must know this within
[1:28:03] myself
[1:28:04] what about Samuel somebody that can see
[1:28:06] a real experience in your life so-and-so
[1:28:08] can see a real experience your life
[1:28:09] that's true but what I'm trying to point
[1:28:11] you to right here is that you must know
[1:28:13] this because when you know this then you
[1:28:16] have authority that when the devil can
[1:28:20] try to come and put things on he could
[1:28:22] try to put on faults try to put on
[1:28:23] accusations he can try to put on a lot
[1:28:26] of things but you have strength to know
[1:28:28] from the inside knowing this like I've
[1:28:35] said before we moved into our house and
[1:28:39] we're not about a year ago we still get
[1:28:41] mail from the people who live there I
[1:28:44] don't know how many times we keep a pen
[1:28:46] we keep pens in the car
[1:28:48] wrong address see we keep pens in the
[1:28:51] car they send us things about cruises I
[1:28:54] hate cruises I've never been on one the
[1:28:57] only kind of water I want is the one I
[1:28:58] take a bathroom when I take a shower I
[1:29:00] do not want to go out on the cruise now
[1:29:02] some of y'all might like that that's
[1:29:04] fine you can go out on the cruise but
[1:29:06] for me I don't want to go on a cruise
[1:29:07] but they keep sending it to my house now
[1:29:11] I got one choice cuz it'll say I won't
[1:29:13] say the name such as such or current
[1:29:16] resident no sir buddy current resident
[1:29:20] never requested this junk so don't just
[1:29:24] try to say well you know your daddy had
[1:29:26] this and you now no sir buddy
[1:29:30] no no they somebody said about cruises
[1:29:35] they send me stuff the catalogs that man
[1:29:38] I mean these things must cost a mint to
[1:29:39] ship against furniture I don't know if
[1:29:41] you can set on this furniture or not it
[1:29:43] sure don't look comfortable to me and
[1:29:45] ain't lazy boys and ain't couches that
[1:29:47] actually it looks like couches you might
[1:29:49] set on the end with a cup of tea and a
[1:29:51] biscuit now if you all like that style
[1:29:54] that's fine that's fine but for me I
[1:29:56] don't like them styles whatsoever what
[1:29:58] I'm trying to tell you they keep sending
[1:30:00] that stuff to the house and we keep
[1:30:02] writing you've got the wrong address and
[1:30:04] we put it back in the box and you know
[1:30:06] what it keeps coming but we keep putting
[1:30:09] it back we
[1:30:10] doing that for a year little by little
[1:30:12] they have stopped sending things credit
[1:30:15] cards and other things why because we
[1:30:17] refuse to accept it you understand what
[1:30:21] circumcision does it gives you the
[1:30:24] authority to say though I am in my
[1:30:27] natural of this family tree but on the
[1:30:29] inside I have no longer of that family
[1:30:32] tree wrong addressee don't be to God
[1:30:43] knowing this that our old man is
[1:30:48] crucified with him that the body look at
[1:30:53] this what's how hopeless is it that the
[1:30:55] body of sin might be destroyed that
[1:31:00] henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:31:08] what does circumcising my heart have to
[1:31:13] do with deadening this everything
[1:31:18] because this right here came as a part
[1:31:21] of even that first birth but the
[1:31:26] circumcising on the inside it acts it
[1:31:29] absolutely separates you and as Paul
[1:31:33] puts in this right here our old man is
[1:31:35] crucified and the body that the body of
[1:31:37] sin might be destroyed that word
[1:31:38] destroyed means unemployed rendered idle
[1:31:46] there's factories all around us that's
[1:31:49] been idled when they've been idle
[1:31:52] they're a shell that's still there but
[1:31:54] there's no manufacturing going on on the
[1:31:58] inside it is only the remnant of a
[1:32:01] memory that was when you can look back
[1:32:04] maybe it's a steel mill in the
[1:32:05] background behind remember the days when
[1:32:07] this and that Marvin we were here here I
[1:32:09] remember all that but what is that it's
[1:32:11] memories of what was going on when it
[1:32:13] was
[1:32:14] active on the inside with people but now
[1:32:18] once it's been idled
[1:32:20] it sets there as a shell don't you
[1:32:22] realize when we have been circumcised by
[1:32:24] the Holy Ghost here we are a new man a
[1:32:27] new creation on the inside but this guy
[1:32:30] has been rendered idle
[1:32:33] this is recognizing our authority don't
[1:32:38] let him get employed put off there also
[1:32:43] don't let him get employed this guy hey
[1:32:46] man this guy
[1:32:47] you don't need Bernie Sanders they have
[1:32:48] $15 an hour this guy man this guy worked
[1:32:51] for peanuts he'll work for anything that
[1:32:54] satisfies him you understand this guy
[1:32:59] man he'll he'll jump I'll tell you what
[1:33:01] it's like you take somebody into a fight
[1:33:03] with you and you're in there and man
[1:33:04] you're getting ready for that fight and
[1:33:06] then all of a sudden this person sides
[1:33:07] with the other person you think wait a
[1:33:08] minute we ain't even been in here a
[1:33:09] minute and you're already siding against
[1:33:11] me your flesh will do that to you every
[1:33:13] single time your spirit will do that to
[1:33:16] you every single time that is why when
[1:33:18] you are feeding on the word it is
[1:33:20] necessary notice how the prophet words
[1:33:22] it and who is this Marquess today if
[1:33:24] you've never given yourself to feed fool
[1:33:27] a to fly above these things destroyed
[1:33:41] think about the sacrifice once you take
[1:33:46] the life of the animal as you're told
[1:33:49] once you take the life of the animal
[1:33:53] that body is no longer employed because
[1:33:56] the life has went out of it it's like
[1:34:01] the deer head that you all went together
[1:34:03] and had mounted of that buck that I
[1:34:05] killed out here you know you can look at
[1:34:07] that deer and I can sit there and I can
[1:34:09] look at it think back to the hunt and
[1:34:11] think back to all those things think
[1:34:12] back you know your all your love and
[1:34:15] everything that was expressed even
[1:34:17] within that but you know what I can
[1:34:20] relive all that in my mind but that
[1:34:22] thing is right there
[1:34:24] it's still it's not going around acting
[1:34:26] like a dear it looks like a dear but it
[1:34:29] ain't acting like a dear you know why
[1:34:32] it's unemployed because then I see this
[1:34:36] flesh or the skin or the hide of it yes
[1:34:39] but its life has been taken and all that
[1:34:44] you see is that hide that's there so you
[1:34:48] can see the hide and you can look at the
[1:34:50] hi no that was a deer oh that's a wolf
[1:34:51] where that's a fox or that's a Kyle or
[1:34:53] that you look at the covering or the
[1:34:56] outside so once that's been taken the
[1:34:59] life has been gone now think of this of
[1:35:01] how that that God would speak this
[1:35:03] through Paul let me try to hurry in
[1:35:04] romans 8 verse 10 if Christ be in you
[1:35:09] notice in you not on you in you the body
[1:35:14] is dead because of sin but the Spirit is
[1:35:19] life because of righteousness and if the
[1:35:23] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:35:25] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:35:29] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:35:30] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:35:36] dwelleth in you now in the Old Testament
[1:35:41] let me just come coming down here godly
[1:35:46] got many all the way through Redemption
[1:35:48] is laid out but to think of how when God
[1:35:51] would have it set forth with the
[1:35:53] tabernacle three room three room house
[1:35:57] and God would have it set forth that
[1:36:00] over the top there of the holy place and
[1:36:04] the holiest of Holies of how that God
[1:36:06] would make sure that over top of that in
[1:36:10] a time he told he told Moses in Exodus
[1:36:13] 26 verse 14
[1:36:15] thou shalt make a covering for the tent
[1:36:18] of Rams skins dyed red not just RAM
[1:36:24] skins but they had to be dyed red they
[1:36:28] had to be soaked in that guy that red
[1:36:32] dyed red they had to have that
[1:36:36] which would speak there of one who has
[1:36:39] bore our sin ball our judgment it would
[1:36:42] speak fair of the precious blood of the
[1:36:45] Lamb notice this it would be a covering
[1:36:48] for the tenth of Rams skins dyed red and
[1:36:52] then right above that covering there was
[1:36:55] a covering above that of badger skins so
[1:37:04] the covering that's beneath the badger
[1:37:06] skins is RAM skins dyed red what's how
[1:37:13] the Prophet places this in the unveiling
[1:37:14] of God he says now I want you to notice
[1:37:19] he said that old veiled that hid the
[1:37:21] glory the old badger skins
[1:37:24] there was no Beauty to be desired of it
[1:37:27] neither was his flesh that's the reason
[1:37:31] people said a little old stooped over
[1:37:33] fella like that probably thirty years
[1:37:35] old and gray and his beard gray wasn't
[1:37:37] much to look at but Bible said there's
[1:37:39] no beauty we should desire him he didn't
[1:37:42] look like a king the old badger skin but
[1:37:45] all what was on the inside it looked
[1:37:50] like a badger skin on the outside and he
[1:37:52] was made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:37:55] our body hast thou prepared me but
[1:37:59] inside behind that body was the RAM of
[1:38:02] God it was the RAM that they had looked
[1:38:06] for when each of them had went to the
[1:38:09] mountain of their revelation and they
[1:38:12] with her just as Abraham they were
[1:38:14] looking for that rail they prophesied of
[1:38:17] that ramp but here in Jesus Christ
[1:38:20] here is the realm made manifest the Lord
[1:38:25] has provided for himself sacrifice here
[1:38:33] was RAM skins beneath the badger skins
[1:38:37] hey hey show us Jesus that came and saw
[1:38:41] mister he's just a man all they saw was
[1:38:45] badger skin but the elect saw Ram skins
[1:38:49] this is he who was spoken up well he
[1:38:55] said on a little bunch of holy rollers
[1:38:56] sitting together in a hot building like
[1:38:58] this they call them not much beauty to
[1:39:01] be desired but what's on the inside
[1:39:04] I'm sure it's veiled from many hearts
[1:39:06] outwardly listen to me now how outwardly
[1:39:09] it was nothing but all was on the inside
[1:39:14] what's inside of it then you see how do
[1:39:18] you get into it shaking hands joining no
[1:39:22] born into it
[1:39:24] dying getting rid of your old badger
[1:39:27] skin your old self to get into a new one
[1:39:32] forsake the old badger skin but hem eyes
[1:39:36] not still in a badger skin yes but I
[1:39:38] forsaken the badger skin here old self
[1:39:42] you're with me it's been circumcised cut
[1:39:45] away but here's the badger skin but
[1:39:48] remember if the Spirit of Christ be in
[1:39:52] you the Badger is dead the nature that
[1:39:58] lived behind this badger is dead glory
[1:40:03] be to God no wonder no wonder no wonder
[1:40:06] we are groaning and desiring to be
[1:40:10] delivered of this badger skin you
[1:40:15] realize when we have Pro truly been
[1:40:16] converted I've never had to repent one
[1:40:19] time for anything that my soul did wrong
[1:40:21] you with me never had to do that but
[1:40:23] I've had to repent plenty of times
[1:40:25] plenty of times for this time but I
[1:40:31] can't put it off and say Lord forgive me
[1:40:33] you know my old sorry flesh Lord no I
[1:40:36] say Lord forgive me I didn't go to sleep
[1:40:43] did you not everybody did but here
[1:40:49] notice I don't like I put these up there
[1:40:51] but just listen this a moment when you
[1:40:53] come in behind that badger skin until
[1:40:56] you get out of your old skin your old
[1:40:58] thoughts your old creature
[1:41:00] and come into the presence of God then
[1:41:03] the word becomes a living reality to you
[1:41:06] you see friends we were to encourage one
[1:41:10] another but I cannot be your experience
[1:41:12] you cannot be my experience OMA as much
[1:41:17] as my wife and I'll have such wonderful
[1:41:19] fellowship around the world she's not my
[1:41:21] experience neither can I be her
[1:41:22] experience but we can't encourage one
[1:41:24] another
[1:41:25] now listen friends it's got to be
[1:41:28] something so real within you that it has
[1:41:31] become a reality to you that if
[1:41:33] everybody walked away it has been made
[1:41:36] alive to you and not just something that
[1:41:40] you say it's truth but your life says
[1:41:43] truth truth truth truth truth then the
[1:41:53] word becomes a living reality to you all
[1:41:56] of them then you're awakened to the
[1:42:00] Shekinah glory then the Bible becomes a
[1:42:03] new book then Jesus Christ is the same
[1:42:07] yesterday today and forever
[1:42:11] when we circumcised out of our old self
[1:42:16] Omaha Road Rash says you know behind
[1:42:19] that badger skin he said people can look
[1:42:22] and say well I can remember when that
[1:42:26] person did such and such and such as
[1:42:27] this man says that's what they was they
[1:42:31] are no longer that it's the badger skin
[1:42:36] that's still there but it's unemployed
[1:42:41] it's rendered idle amen
[1:42:47] Oh mom behind that badger skin in there
[1:42:50] oh he said the outside it looks like a
[1:42:53] bunch of holy rollers the old Badger
[1:42:55] skin but inside has this a kind of glory
[1:42:58] inside that by badger skin behind that
[1:43:01] human skin in there is the Shekinah
[1:43:04] glory in there is the power in there is
[1:43:08] the word
[1:43:09] there is the shewbread old friends this
[1:43:14] is the reality within our lives knowing
[1:43:17] this we must know this that reality that
[1:43:22] is within us in there is the power in
[1:43:26] there behind the veil is the power to
[1:43:29] live an overcoming life in there that
[1:43:33] life when it's circumcised its him
[1:43:36] living his life through you same same
[1:43:40] old badger skin but new life on the
[1:43:44] inside oh my you're loving this morning
[1:43:51] those skins brother Bama sent in one
[1:43:53] other place those skins he said was one
[1:43:57] time on a badger you've been around
[1:44:03] people they can remember you before God
[1:44:05] got ahold of your life I know some some
[1:44:08] folks in that's I think listen I'm gonna
[1:44:10] taste something you don't calm potato
[1:44:11] all the young people you don't need to
[1:44:13] go out in the world you know the grace
[1:44:14] of God no sir you don't have you don't
[1:44:17] have to touch one cigarette one drinker
[1:44:19] dude you don't have to know that to know
[1:44:20] God's grace no sir understand that very
[1:44:23] clearly but there's still a part about
[1:44:25] you that even when maybe you as far as a
[1:44:29] finger can never been laid on your life
[1:44:30] but there's a change it takes place and
[1:44:32] it's a change that you know about where
[1:44:37] this this word this life it is a life to
[1:44:40] you and you have received power on the
[1:44:45] inside and it's not just well I don't do
[1:44:48] this I don't no no this is a power to
[1:44:51] live out the will of God in this
[1:44:53] generation it's a power of the
[1:44:57] overcoming life that gives you the
[1:44:59] strength to reflect Jesus Christ let me
[1:45:01] tell you something it wouldn't matter if
[1:45:03] they put you in the midst of hell you'll
[1:45:04] still live in overcoming life but say me
[1:45:08] how can that be you tell me how Daniel
[1:45:10] did it right in the Babylon and Daniel
[1:45:13] didn't even have the Holy Ghost like we
[1:45:15] have it but it shows you Daniel was so
[1:45:18] purposed to the God that he met they put
[1:45:20] him right there in Babylon
[1:45:22] he lived right there around the throne
[1:45:23] but he made up his mind
[1:45:25] I will not defile myself with the King's
[1:45:27] wine and the Queen Kings meat and I
[1:45:30] believe God's got people that's been
[1:45:31] called out of Babylon that says I will
[1:45:34] not define myself with the wine of this
[1:45:37] world I will not eat of her meat but I
[1:45:42] will stand separate unto God and receive
[1:45:45] that new wine I received that meat that
[1:45:49] has come from God
[1:45:50] that meat not only what is too of a neat
[1:45:52] but that meet that sustenance it is in
[1:45:55] doing the will of God a strength they
[1:46:00] lived right there in Pergamus in the
[1:46:02] very seat of Satan I know how sometimes
[1:46:06] you're in the midst you might be
[1:46:07] surrounded by a bunch of unbelievers and
[1:46:09] there the mouths and everything that
[1:46:11] they say and they do but yet in the
[1:46:13] midst of it it is the power of God
[1:46:16] within your life that you are living and
[1:46:19] overcoming life standing right there
[1:46:22] what a miracle what a paradox because
[1:46:25] you want to know why you are not of this
[1:46:27] earth you're not of this world
[1:46:31] you've been lifted up out of this world
[1:46:34] and to the rest of them you look like a
[1:46:37] nut they don't understand how can you
[1:46:41] not give in to this you know I mean I've
[1:46:45] stood there and looked at a doorknob for
[1:46:47] how many weeks and I will not drink and
[1:46:49] I will not drink and I will not drink
[1:46:50] and I will not drink drinking is this
[1:46:51] and drinking is that I will not do this
[1:46:53] I will not do that but you didn't meet a
[1:46:55] doorknob you just went through the door
[1:46:58] you met the door Christ Jesus you didn't
[1:47:01] just look at a doorknob and repeat a
[1:47:03] bunch of says and it's a mind over
[1:47:05] matter
[1:47:05] but the mind of Christ has come and
[1:47:08] sought you out and lifted you and
[1:47:11] walks you into Liberty such a Liberty
[1:47:15] that you can say I can do it if I want
[1:47:17] to but I don't want to you mean you
[1:47:22] can't yeah but I don't want to I've been
[1:47:25] liberated this is a real Liberty not
[1:47:30] this kind of nonsense and trash they try
[1:47:32] to promote through our government this
[1:47:34] is the real Liberty let's finish
[1:47:42] Romans 6:4 he that is dead is freed from
[1:48:00] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[1:48:04] that we shall also live with him knowing
[1:48:10] that Christ being raised from the dead
[1:48:13] diet no more death hath no more dominion
[1:48:18] over him for in that he died he died
[1:48:22] unto sin once but in that he liveth he
[1:48:26] liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also
[1:48:34] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[1:48:40] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] our Lord
[1:48:47] reckon yourselves have the regard think
[1:48:51] of yourselves thinking not robbery
[1:48:54] reckon yourselves once you think of this
[1:49:00] Paul when he makes this scripture
[1:49:04] putting off the sins the body the sins
[1:49:11] of this flesh in our opening text that
[1:49:16] word a putting off is a laying aside
[1:49:22] Paul would write through different
[1:49:24] places in the scripture and Paul would
[1:49:27] say for this earthly Tabernacle if it be
[1:49:32] dissolved we have a body in the heavens
[1:49:38] not made with hands Paul goes on through
[1:49:42] that portion of Scripture in 1st
[1:49:45] Corinthians 5 just speaks of it think
[1:49:48] about Peter spoke of this Tabernacle
[1:49:50] this body
[1:49:51] Paul said Peter could say like this he
[1:49:55] said he has showed me that I must
[1:49:57] shortly pull it off
[1:49:58] this tabernacle you see they realized
[1:50:03] this Tabernacle was not them they
[1:50:10] realized it was a garment that was given
[1:50:14] but there was an image of the heavenly
[1:50:17] that had moved on the inside and was
[1:50:20] pressing itself in morphing through to
[1:50:25] be shown on the outside and so they
[1:50:28] realized this body of flesh is only a
[1:50:32] visible form such as the Prophet would
[1:50:34] tell us in the message the Hebrews
[1:50:37] series he said william branham you have
[1:50:40] never seen him the only thing he said
[1:50:43] you've ever saw is this outside man that
[1:50:46] you called him and he said this outside
[1:50:49] man this veil keeps us he said from
[1:50:53] things that we need to see he said but
[1:50:56] one day he said a matter of fact the
[1:50:58] real william branham is invisible you've
[1:51:02] never seen him but yet when you would
[1:51:05] look look you would look at that bonding
[1:51:06] say brother Ram but what is it it's the
[1:51:10] character that is behind there that has
[1:51:14] expressed itself through that body but
[1:51:20] this body that you know it's Samuel
[1:51:23] browning and you put up put your name to
[1:51:25] it the authority that we have received
[1:51:28] through him by the circumcision of the
[1:51:32] Holy Ghost
[1:51:33] we have put off by the grace of God that
[1:51:37] old nature guess what we've received the
[1:51:41] earnest this body is gonna be changed
[1:51:45] this body is going to be born again to
[1:51:49] match the new birth in my soul aren't
[1:51:52] you glad in my soul by the new birth
[1:51:55] there is no deformities well here with
[1:51:59] me my soul is not susceptible to
[1:52:01] sickness when this gets born again there
[1:52:10] in not only will there not be any
[1:52:11] sickness but there'll be no susceptible
[1:52:13] it will come according to how God
[1:52:15] intended for it his job said I will wait
[1:52:20] I will wait and I will wait for my
[1:52:25] changed and when he shall call I shall
[1:52:29] come forth listen to this as that
[1:52:33] clothes things that are to be just want
[1:52:36] to share this with you I didn't I don't
[1:52:38] think I may have put it up I don't know
[1:52:40] this old earthly tabernacle here you
[1:52:44] know what it is this body it's like an
[1:52:47] old coat that you wear a coat that you
[1:52:50] once wear but now you have one so much
[1:52:53] better you don't use it anymore
[1:52:56] what do you do you're hanging in the
[1:52:58] closet before you've got one better
[1:53:01] you've got a better coat it's more
[1:53:04] up-to-date than the one you used to wear
[1:53:07] that's worn out what it is that garment
[1:53:11] you are the inside of that there that
[1:53:15] garment only done what it bore your
[1:53:17] image but you don't need it anymore now
[1:53:21] you've hung it up it's a rag and that's
[1:53:25] the way this old body is you it's more
[1:53:28] the image of the heavenly yet it is not
[1:53:30] you you are on the inside of that body
[1:53:34] you the Spirit of God is on the inside
[1:53:36] of that body that's what makes the
[1:53:39] outside come into subjection because the
[1:53:42] inside is pulling it
[1:53:46] pulling it yes there's a war but greater
[1:53:51] is he that I sent you the inside man is
[1:53:55] pulling it see it's bringing it in line
[1:53:59] with the Word of God one day that inside
[1:54:02] man will pull it right into a change
[1:54:05] you're inside you yourself your being
[1:54:10] this body is just an old coat some day
[1:54:16] what will you do with it you already
[1:54:19] says someday what will you do with it it
[1:54:23] was only a garment for a while this is
[1:54:26] locked their earthly garment this body
[1:54:28] you are real body your real self is on
[1:54:30] the inside of this old coat that you
[1:54:33] call William Branham or Suzy Jones or
[1:54:36] whoever it is some day you know hanging
[1:54:39] in the Earth's Hall of memory of you
[1:54:41] you'll put it out on yonder in the great
[1:54:43] but someday somebody will put a
[1:54:46] tombstone up here lies Reverend
[1:54:47] so-and-so Johnson so or so and so it'll
[1:54:50] lie there as a memorial of you that
[1:54:52] people just seen you in this and what
[1:54:56] you was your real you was on the inside
[1:55:00] of that but the old code itself just
[1:55:03] born the image of the heavenly what's
[1:55:07] happened the circumcision by the Spirit
[1:55:11] of God has been able to extract with us
[1:55:14] by the new birth what belongs to him and
[1:55:17] bring back sons and daughters of God and
[1:55:19] through him by that there will actually
[1:55:22] be a body that will come forth by God
[1:55:25] himself that will match this body if we
[1:55:30] die and those that have passed on in
[1:55:34] Christ they've entered into this the
[1:55:38] author me

[1:57:21] their theophany and they will come back
[1:57:25] down here and take upon their body a
[1:57:28] glorified body hallelujah it will not be
[1:57:36] a body that has been brought forth by
[1:57:39] man and woman it will look according to
[1:57:44] how the members were laid out within his
[1:57:46] book there will not be any blemish there
[1:57:50] will not be any abnormality of sin
[1:57:53] there will be no
[1:57:55] mocking of that there and they will pick
[1:57:59] up their glorified body and we will take
[1:58:05] our glorified body for when we see them
[1:58:10] we shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:58:16] twinkling of an eye the very atoms of
[1:58:20] our bodies will change change on by his
[1:58:25] word his presence his life and we will
[1:58:31] take our glorified body to meet our
[1:58:35] theophany I say that with this what
[1:58:42] authority that we have right now not in
[1:58:50] the millennium we shall reign
[1:58:53] we're raining right now this is where we
[1:58:58] are to reign right now
[1:59:02] reigning over sin reigning over the
[1:59:08] world reigning over the devil reigning
[1:59:12] over the flesh it's a reign that's going
[1:59:16] on right now now look how this reign
[1:59:20] happens though this rain is not by brute
[1:59:24] force this rain is not by I tell you
[1:59:28] what hit no that that's not that's not
[1:59:30] how the body I'll tell you about it no
[1:59:32] that's not it the way the body is ruled
[1:59:35] is by the heart and submission to God
[1:59:40] the submission and humility allows the
[1:59:44] power of God to flow so the word is not
[1:59:48] given to us that we might somehow come
[1:59:52] forth by our own strength but it's
[1:59:54] submit yourselves therefore under the
[1:59:57] mighty hand of
[2:00:00] this message that God has revealed to us
[2:00:03] is the mighty hand of God it's the
[2:00:06] mighty hand of God yes it is this is God
[2:00:11] has revealed to us and I say to you now
[2:00:15] what authority that we have to live a
[2:00:19] victorious life knowing this that our
[2:00:23] old man is crucified you have Authority
[2:00:30] you have authority to live a victorious
[2:00:33] life you believe that this morning or
[2:00:45] Jesus

[2:00:53] what promise that God you've placed
[2:00:57] within our hearts but to think more of
[2:01:01] how that you have made it so clear to us
[2:01:05] that by this earnest money this earnest
[2:01:12] of the Spirit of God within our lives
[2:01:17] that is circumcised circumcised us from
[2:01:26] the body the sins of this flesh
[2:01:32] Lord I pray right now this morning I
[2:01:34] asked Lord by your mercy that if there's
[2:01:39] one here that's not ready I pray this
[2:01:42] would be the morning I pray this would
[2:01:44] be the moment that they would just let
[2:01:46] it be settled in their hearts Lord let
[2:01:51] it be that Lord God were they recognized
[2:01:55] that there's a settling
[2:01:58] there is an overcoming granite or Jesus
[2:02:03] and I pray
[2:02:07] and Lord make each and every one of us
[2:02:12] realize
[2:02:15] as Paul speaks to us midway through this
[2:02:18] chapter likewise reckon ye yourselves
[2:02:22] also dead
[2:02:27] but alive unto God through Christ Jesus
[2:02:34] or Jesus
[2:02:38] we realize each day Lord God we pack
[2:02:43] around this body
[2:02:46] Oh how many times Lord you've healed us
[2:02:50] you've touched us
[2:02:54] whether we've had a headache toothache
[2:02:56] backache Lord even what was testified
[2:02:59] here on Thursday and once again today of
[2:03:03] cancer Lord on and on we can go these
[2:03:10] bodies she prophet laid it out over and
[2:03:14] over is sin still these bodies are
[2:03:20] susceptible to sickness
[2:03:23] we're healed today can be sick tomorrow
[2:03:29] once that soul has been healed oh my it
[2:03:35] can never be sick again
[2:03:39] what sometimes
[2:03:42] your children Lord some Lord in their
[2:03:47] lives they spirits different changes
[2:03:51] changes in times changes in times of
[2:03:54] life your prophet told us like this Lord
[2:03:57] God he said every seven years there's a
[2:04:01] change in our life and our natural body
[2:04:04] there's a change certain changes Lord
[2:04:10] God that here we are though
[2:04:12] our soul beats for you Lord and all God
[2:04:20] can deal with things that's just in a
[2:04:23] emotional rent that deals with the
[2:04:27] seasons of life then Lord to look at it
[2:04:32] of how that you'll move down by your
[2:04:36] Holy Spirit you bring healing in our
[2:04:39] lives or God
[2:04:46] your prophet told us you said it just
[2:04:49] like this he said it's real easy to get
[2:04:54] a complex real easy
[2:05:01] or sometimes it's things Lord that's not
[2:05:04] just necessarily something that someone
[2:05:09] has done or this or that I remember a
[2:05:11] Lord a case the Holy Spirit picked it up
[2:05:14] there was a man that almost died of
[2:05:17] carbon monoxide poisoning 1964 the
[2:05:23] Spirit of God calls him out and he had
[2:05:26] been bound with a complex of fear that
[2:05:28] he would not even go back out and work
[2:05:30] he was fearful
[2:05:34] and what god how that you broke on the
[2:05:39] scene you moved on the scene and you
[2:05:42] delivered that man from that complex
[2:05:47] or Jesus I believe this morning as we've
[2:05:53] looked into this at that new day that's
[2:05:57] dawned within our hearts we receive a
[2:06:00] strength to wear Apostle Paul could
[2:06:04] speak to us while walking in this life
[2:06:07] behind this badger skin where he could
[2:06:12] charge us by the Spirit of God put off
[2:06:14] this awesome and put on this Lord Jesus
[2:06:21] I pray this morning

[2:06:27] unit got to recognize the responsibility
[2:06:31] that we have in our lives
