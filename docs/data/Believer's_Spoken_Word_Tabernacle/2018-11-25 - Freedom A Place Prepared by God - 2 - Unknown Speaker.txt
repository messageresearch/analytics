the Lord amen for that sister honk I'll bless you god bless just good to have you all here and any other visitors we have god bless you it's good to have you here with us and we want to turn right in the scriptures to revelations chapter 12 verse 1 is what I'd like to just read a few verses of Scripture this morning there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I'd like to continue to look at that font here just a little on freedom it's a place prepared of God this verse of scriptures that we've read we know it continues to transition back and forth between that of the Jewish church that of the Gentile church and then coming back to the calling out of the 144,000 but I want to focus on verse 6 a little bit more here this morning and we know that when we look at this this verse brother Branham was very clear as the Spirit of God would direct and give the direction that this verse it speaks of the very purpose of this land that we would call America of why that it was founded was for the purpose of freedom of religion there was no other it wasn't any other any other purpose other than that freedom of religion and we see of that you know as we looked at it last week where brother Branham told us that when we come together on this holiday the Thanksgiving holiday said this is an American holiday and it's one that where God has had given a desire within the hearts of people that they would escape that the tyranny and the rule of that Roman Catholic system that had continued to move and follow the very movement of God you see every time that God would make a move guys God would move eventually you find that that system would move in behind it and it kept moving until where we are at in this place the gospel itself it can't go any further than back east again but to look at the purpose within this this scripture here I want you to I want to draw your attention here there was a period of time and it's a place that was prepared of God whereby to be fed and to be nourished by the word and the spirit to be built up the whole purpose was so that God knowing that what God had intended that God is calling a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake God had been had been already doing that and all of that was moving he was building his body all along and in this place that you know as we look at and now we see my the expanse of civilization and where things are at now but yet it was a place of wilderness there was not places of development but yet it was given as a place that God whereby that God would be able to feed his people be able to nourish his people by his word and by his Spirit and when you look at it you know we think of it that even within this we see that how much that the purpose itself was so far lost it's not even it's not even held in the original content of why that this place that you and I here we call home of I was even founded in the first place the purpose itself has so far left from the hearts of the people and I believe that that's something that we can see and look at how that God provided this land for a place to be nourished and fed and I believe that if we look at how that God has provided for us in this hour a place that we can be nourished and fed where God would open his word to us his spirit to us that we can come into a place coming into the body of Jesus Christ into the word that God has promised in this hour I believe that it is so beneficial and crucial to us that we are mindful there is a purpose of why God has done what he has done God did not do what he has done in this hour so that we would become puffed up but we recognized that if not for the grace of God we would be just like any others and to think of it that why is it that there would even be a desire within our hearts like the scripture said the woman fled not everybody fled not everybody came here but there were those that we look at and call the pilgrims and how many of them started out there in that time 105 I believe it is and here you end up with 66 or something to that to that nature what is it that would be within them that would drive them to make such a sacrifice and avoid or even those that would follow after what is that I'll tell you what that is that was the Spirit of God moving within them that there was a call and God was in the midst of bringing this word to pass and even though that they within themselves would not have the understanding I'm doing this because of this but you see when God gets ready to fulfill his word God puts it within the heart and the condition of the heart will match what God's heart was when he spoke it there and here they were moving within this to come to a place where they could worship God freely where where the Spirit of God could take that word and nourish their lives and build them up that was the purpose and the reason that they land to here and I look at this and I of all that it would behoove us in this hour to recognize the grace of God that has come to us and opened to us this land in this hour I believe it's imperative that we don't take these things for granted but we be very diligent with what God is open to us that it ought to be something that raises in our hearts that says Lord I want to occupy every bit of it it ought to be something that feels our heart and it drives us and it motivates as I I'm not talking about and being motivated by a pastor that will wear out I'm not talking about being motivated by a church you've got to have this in your own heart where you desire this you know the Bible tells us like this that here in Psalms 33 verse 12 blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord at one time America could say that but America can no longer say this we know that you know many times that it said she's a Christian nation but the Prophet already identified by what was done he said we are not a Christian nation we are a Catholic nation so this has already been done and you know to think of this bless it is that nation what was the great blessing about this nation what is the blessing about it the blessing was that God was the Lord think about it brother man tells us he said they would have never had to have bomb shelters and all these other things they would have never had to think about that Israel never had to start thinking about all these enemies when their focus was on God they didn't even have to focus upon their crops they only had to focus upon the Lord and everything that they did the sowing of their crops the rain would be there in its due season all they had to do was make the Lord their refuge no wonder the scripture says blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people in whom he had chosen for his own in here now notice this parallel brother Brown will run this parallel here between the nation of Israel and our nation think of this here in Deuteronomy 4:20 the Lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this day I believe with all my heart when we recognize why God himself would open his word would make himself real and alive to our hearts to recognize it's God that has taken us out of the air iron furnace that we would be a people of inheritance unto Him the Bible goes on to say in 2nd Corinthians 3:17 that the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty you know freedom is not free I I know we've got different veterans sitting here right now that we thank God for their service our freedom was not free and I'll tell you freedom itself if freedom is not something that's just handed to somebody freedom itself is what is taken and it must be maintained there must be a desire within the heart to remain free to remain the skate to remain liberated there must be a pulsation and a desire because you see well there is a false Liberty and that false Liberty is the same it has within it the same interpreter that came to Eve and told Eve that if you just eat of this tree you will be as God's and he was presenting to her a gospel that within it that if you go this way God surely will not kill you he's taking away the penalty you know what he's doing he's destroying the effectiveness and the authority of God's Word if I can't believe that God will stand behind one word what makes you think I'm gonna have faith for any other word you see Satan does is to try to undermine the authority and divine inspiration that is given by God upon the world freedom isn't free there is a Liberty that is a true freedom it's a place it is the person of Jesus Christ hallelujah there is what what is said today I am free and oh you know I've got Liberty but in reality it's bondage I think to think of this you and I this morning if your soul has been set free by the Holy Ghost you know realized within your life in my life this morning the desire of God has come forth in afro-eurasian do you realize that there are drunks and prostitutes and everywhere else that know those desires would be there but you'll find him and they'll say I don't want to be this way now here it comes again this weekend they are enslaved to those desires that they want to be free of but to think of it for you and I it's easier when you've been born of the Spirit of God by the true Liberty it's easier to live a Christian life than it is a drunk to be a drunk it's easier because you do what you want to do you see when God has separated us from the world you know and you look all the way down through this road the road down through here you got the Greek Orthodox brother and you got the badness on up the road and he you have all these different places that are that are down through here each one of the churches themselves are separated and they're separated based on their doctrines or their what they believe out of the scripture but that is not what God calls separation that is called organization but the real separation of God is not by us just having a different take on the word or us just preaching a different a different word that's not what it is it is the very presence of Almighty God that made the difference remember when Moses said Lord if you don't go on don't take us up any further for how shall it be known that we are thy people is it not in that thy presence will go with us you see the presence of the Lord brings liberty to life it will expose the error of the spirit of error and will leads you to righteousness it'll leads you to domina settled leads you to holiness he leads you to a true Liberty the presence of God will manifest and reveal his name to be the same yesterday today and forever glory churches churches can be separated but remember our separation is not because we come here it's not because that weari quotes that is not that could just be we're no different than any other church but the difference is the presence of the Lord and remember where the Spirit of the Lord is various Liberty but remember let us not take Liberty for granted Liberty is not always a guarantee as this nation right here remember it was a period of time there were those who made in the provision in a period of time and even you and I after in the midst of all this corruption yet you and I as we see all of this sinking and caving in all around us but yet God has provided a place for you and I in Christ where we can be nourished and fed and built up and being made ready for the coming of the Lord but yet within it this place itself this building who knows if God carries remember the prophet said one day they will shut us up who knows one day this very building right here it may no longer be used as a building for whatever it might come but let me bring it on down here close who knows is there a guarantee that this building itself well it's always going to be a church is that oh is that the guarantee there's no guarantee about this but as long as the hearts of the people that assemble here under the word is in tune and one with God it will be a place that God Himself will feel welcome to come down and move among his people he feels welcome to come among his people where hearts hearts are aligned with what he thought when he spoke his word now remember in God there is no sin there's no variableness there's no shadow of turning he's perfect is that right and God's desire is to dwell among us that's his desire but remember it's not something that is guaranteed it's a place we must create well how do I create that by our heart our life the way we live this is where true Liberty itself has boundaries you know the sea can only go so far you see God when God even would set even the boundaries God was speaking of child-raising there's got to be boundaries and boundaries are known they are set forth for what reason boundaries are security there are borders that are given by God God gave the parameters sure of Israel as a land but he gave them the borders of protection was his name his word his life and no wonder Paul could admonish the Galatian Church what's how deceptive it had come in Paul could tell them stand fast and therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage notice Stan Stan be persistent be perseverant keep ones standing now let's look here just a little bit as we're looking at this parallel and let's take just of jurnee this morning if the Lord would help us and let's look here into this parallel of Israel here is Israel they've come up out of the land of Egypt that come through the time of judges wherever men did what was right in his own eyes and then Israel began to get their eyes on other nations which God said they would and they desired to have a king and then they raised up and made a king after their heart not after God's heart it was one that they chose according to their choosing not gods choosing but God permitted them and allowed them to do it then we watch how that God will take a permissive will but yet it will only it will come back to a place God will bring it around to where that he'll be able to set forth his perfect will now notice this has Solomon himself David is praying in the midst of this in 1st chronicles 28 for howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever for he had chosen Judah to be the ruler and of the house of Judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel and all of my sons for the Lord had given me many sons he had chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the Kingdom of the Lord over Israel and he sent unto me Solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for I had chosen him to be my son and I will be his father you know the choosing of God is a very wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing but the choosing of God cannot be taken for granted just because that we are his children does not mean he won't correct us he's a faithful father remember God never visits a generation and reveals himself I am the grandfather now every time God makes himself known I am the God of thy father Abraham God always reveals himself as the father to his seed line so to think the choosing of God is a very wonderful thing it's wonderful to know the choosing of God this is why that the Paul would say no your election brother Peter would say make your calling an election sure you make the calling you make it sure nobody else can do that but you now watch this moreover I will establish his kingdom forever if he be constant to do my Commandments and my judgments at theirs at this day now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord and in the audience of our God keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God notice keep and seek keep and seek not just where it's handed but remember Liberty is not free keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever and thou solomon my son know that the god of thy father know Val the God of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind notice how David instructs Solomon this is David telling him this is how that you served the Lord with a perfect perfect meaning complete heart God wants completeness and a willing mind a willing mind that which one takes pleasure in which it is the delight of the individual sews David is admonishing solomon let it be that from thy life that there is a completeness of your heart that is given to god as well as a desire within to please him for the lord searches all hearts aren't you glad for that and understandeth all the imaginations of the heart I'm glad for that too I'm glad for a beliving word that comes down and discerns the very intentions intents of the heart I'm glad when there's decisions or there's things that can be going on within our life and you know we might not be something where we are able to open the scriptures and find maybe the answer written there in black and white but holy spirit oh my he doesn't need a new word but the Spirit of God is able to come down and with the word that he's given manifest his characteristic his nature in that hour and it'll speak right to your heart right to your need and yet you look at it and say ma that's alarm oh how did that happen because God knows our need and God will discern and speak to our hearts how many times where there's been people that's ready to make a decision and they brought that decision carrying it on their heart they've been in prayer with it and they come to the house of God and right here God comes down and he speaks to that knee and he answers that question and right quickly either they say yes I'm going to go ahead God has led me to do it or they say no I'm not going to do it because God has warned me against it hello because God's desire he leads us and he knows our hearts this is what this is a very important place of instruction if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast the off forever take heed now for the Lord had chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it you see these were men David and Solomon right here that knew what godly fear was this is a time and an age where when we stand right now there is no fear and yet that no fear it really is fear you don't understand you see the bumper stickers no fear that's a lie the Bible says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but in this age people are so taken with things they may not take sedatives they may not take all these other pills but everything else that they will take in to their life to try to keep their so deadened to the reality there's a judgment coming they'll do everything in the world to try to Det then silence that voice I'll tell you what if that voice within you is calling out for life it's because there is a source of life there is a place where you can have a real true life and liberty and actually be free take heed be attentive be careful be diligent be strong think of this here in the scriptures as we go along in second chronicles verse in chapter 6 verse 4 here is David or Solomon rather and he recognizes this choosing of how that God has chosen to place his name here in that which God is directed to be built notice in verse 7 now was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel notice it was in the heart of David you remember when God revealed it to David David said praise God and then God held back said but David you're not going to be the one to do it what did David say I love this in the scripture it was not a selfishness in his heart at all he said then I will pray for what you've revealed see what God has revealed it didn't matter if David was the one to make it to happen you see then what was it the heart of Christ that was there in David I will pray for this to happen now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel but the Lord said to David my father for as much as it was in thine heart to build a house for my name thou did us well in that it was in thine heart God so honored that it rested in David's heart to build a house there was not lip service that David gave God it was his heart David expended his life laying up so that this place could be built David gave of himself why because the word was revealed to David it was in David's heart do you realize David why are you exerting yourself David why are you glowing the way you're glowing why are you doing it it was in his heart don't you realize friends that when God anytime that the love of God has entered into the heart of the believer you don't live the way you live because you're afraid of Hell you live the way you live because you love the Lord the love of God is in your heart the desire to please him if it's just in this church you'll fall under conviction and if you don't get your heart really set right it'll line right back up in your life and preaching I have two coming in but you ever get that heart set just right with God and the love of God enters they're brother and sister there ain't enough devils and demons out of torment that can ever take that out of your heart because you have become one with the purpose and program of Almighty God your heart is in it you ever heard somebody say your heart's not in it who was it was it Paul Rader you know he kissed his wife and ran out the door he got to thinking what happened to her if I'm going he ran back in and grabbed her and laid one on her what's the difference the second one had feeling in it I believe that sound were to serve God with feeling with heart now don't misunderstand me I believe in emotions I'm not just talking money motion I'm talking about with our heart when you serve God with your heart he doesn't matter where you're at you can be in a factory you can be in a grocery store you can be anywhere and your heart is still sealed away with God he is the delight of your life oh my notwithstanding oh my he let David know he shall not build the house of the Lord but the Sun which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name notice the Sun that would come forth from the loins of David would be the one who would build the house of the Lord here is the great type of here out of God notice out of God here coming forth the word the son how that God Himself would actually erect his dwelling place through and by the surrendering and submission of the life of his only begotten son that God himself through and by this this offering that was paid that then the Holy Spirit being released the water in the blood to be able to call us to himself to where that he then could come and live on the inside it is all a work of almighty Glahn notice what David says right here in verse 10 the Lord therefore hath performed his word that he has spoken who performed it the Lord but how did the Lord performance by hearts being surrendered to him God said after your energy or my energy but he's after our energies being surrendered through a heart for I am risen up I am risen up this was the rising of the Sun come on somebody this was the resurrection before I am risen up in the room of David my father and him sat on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel and in it have I put the ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord that he made with the children of Israel notice I have put the ark in it when God builds a house he builds it by his word he has solid foundations right and he been he himself the finishing touch is when he places himself in it that itself becomes a perfect dwelling place of the Lord God oh mama so risen and he assembled the material for a dwelling place now notice if we go on in first Kings chapter 9 verse 1 now what Solomon here I want you to watch the order in the scripture here the Bible said when it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord and the Kings house and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do notice the order he finished the house of the Lord and his house it wasn't his house first and the Lord's house second come on somebody you see it was God's house first you can't build your house by putting your house first god's house is first the house of the lord is first your life is first your life unto god you might give yourself into all sorts of other things but yet if your heart and everything within you is not fully given to the lord first it'll never come out right it'll never come out right God can never bless that and if God does bless it look out a person begins to think God's with me he's blessing me I'll tell you friends when the presence of god when god's prison ever pulls back from you it's something within your heart that you begin to seek after if there's something you've prayed or hear you've been reading or whatever more for something you start searching your life there's things you start looking at saying the lord is there something that i'm entertained is there something Lord that I'm dwelling on and what what is it Lord is it forgive me Lord is there anything and yet you begin to come to times as a mature believer you recognize there are dry times to make us appreciate the times of refreshing but it does not maturity does not cause us to get loose it does not cause us to come into a place to say well you know I'm the chosen one I'm the bride of Jesus Christ that's a contrary attitude to that a maturity real maturity rec Nasus and brings us to the realization that we need him all the time think about it toddlers they know they need help to walk they know they need help to get their milk bottle they know this but once then it grows up to teenagers teenagers are telling you they're the ones who invented the car they know how it runs they know all of this you never knew anything you were never my age you don't know what I'm talking about but once they get beyond that teenager spot then they get into a place to recognize you know what mom and dad weren't dumb after all they were pretty smart they begin to evaluate the word that's been given to them and I believe with all of my heart that even within the spiritual birth we have those stages and real true maturity does not make a self-reliant or self dependent but it makes us more dependent upon the Holy Ghost to recognize that he is the one that has been leading us and directing us the whole time he's the one that we are resting it and counting on to take us on Omaha so here the order the order was absolutely in the right order that's a--that's a good thing in the house of God is first his life is first and I'm not just I'm not just talking about this I believe this to be a place that God comes and dwells with us I believe that it ought to be something that it ought to be a priority to be in the house of God so matter of fact the Prophet said it very clear if the love of God is in your heart then you can't wait for those church doors to open good but you see it's not about just coming to church if it's just about coming together that'll get old but if the love of God's in your heart then you're expecting God to come and speak to you even when you're at your lowest time sometimes you're going through something but you said I'm going there and I know that God is going to speak to me I know that God is gonna minister to my knee [Applause] the Bible said the Lord appeared unto Solomon the second time as he appeared unto Him at Gibeon and the Lord said unto Him I have heard that prayer in that supplication that thou has made before me Solomon was so in tune with what God wanted his son to he was so in tuned to his prayers were right in line with what God's heart the semi do you believe that a man can live that way I'm proof I believe that that prayers can we can be so in tune with the heart and the mind of Almighty God it's not that we walk around and know it you know I mean brother Terah now that you walk around saying well I know I've got it sometimes you don't even realize maybe when you're ministering or sometimes you say something to have another brother or your sister say something another sister you don't even realize it about how the Spirit of God would so lead you as you are so in tune with God's mind and I have hallowed this house which thou has built to put my name there forever notice was this not a direction of God build this house I will put my name there what's that not well why did he have to pray pray prayer was Lord come fulfill your word fulfill your word that you have given where is it that we get to a place we don't pray instead of praying for things because look what God has revealed or to say that he has opened remember we want it to be revealed in us but Ron tells us and mighty God unveiled before us he said what it is he said we don't seek after God that these things are made real to us you realize sometimes God he'll speak things right here within within the service there's things you can be reading in the scriptures things you can hear out across as you're listening to the message and you look and you say you know what your heart says O God let it be Lord you say well why would God do that because he wants us to seek after him if he keeps handing us everything handing it to us and we're not reaching out for it there's not a desire for more than we become fat and lazy and that's a problem because God said when you get that way you forget who did and brought you out and gave you this that you didn't get yourself who verse 4 and if thou wilt walk before me Oh Maha that's a big that's a big phrase than that not just before the rest of Israel how the rest of Israel thinks about you but in my eyes as David my father walked in integrity that word means completeness and fullness of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I have commanded thee and will keep my statutes and my judgments God goes on to tell him I will establish the throne of that Kingdom upon Israel forever as I promised to David thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel but if ye shall turn at all from following me ye or your children will not keep my Commandments and my statutes without set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then will I cut you off Israel out of the land which I have given them and this house which I've handled for my name I will cast out of my sight and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people and at this house which is high every one that passeth by shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why half the Lord done this unto this land and to this house and they shall answer because they forsook the Lord their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil so God was not sitting there in a manner of it's always going to be here my presence is always going to be here but God let him know if you turn away from me at all I will pull back my presence Oh God what good does it do to have a building without his presence I hope you understand me what good does it do to have a message without his presence what good does it do to have a Bible without his presence you see you can hold these things you can hold date you can hold look you can come all that but remember to capture the presence of God it takes a heart that is fully surrendered a heart that is surrender Doeg a heart that is surrendered to God it captures his presence it'll stop him it'll get his attention a heart that is surrender to him no wonder Solomon could say this building he said cannot contain me but a house the house that the Lord shall build this parallel was Salomon that we've just started reading here you know I'm you know where it lasted for a period of time it's very much so the parallel of what took place with the Gentile Church ages after the Holy Ghost was poured out on the day of Pentecost it was about twenty years in there after until the start of the first church age but when the first church age began the one but woman the church was already fallen but you see God's desire is to bring his church back the way he started it at the beginning on the day of Pentecost you recall when you look back in the scriptures the Bible even is such a parallel between that of Solomon when the presence of God is descending down into the temple of God the Shekinah glory of how that all of the musicians and all of them who were there they were all together the Bible would say sounded as one there was a unity they were in one mind and one Accord but then as we look at it the parallel that speaks right here you eventually begin to see a drifting because what we're looking at and what we begin to look at last week is how that this country has got to where it's got to how did Israel get to where it got to it didn't just morph to Ahab overnight it did just all of a sudden bang it happened sin is gradual rhythm and puts it like this let me just read a few portions from Jezebel religion what happened to Israel after all this godly background they begin to get carefree oh that's an attitude carefree it's it's a heart condition they begin to get to a place where they well they didn't care what went on I mean they're the chosen where Israel brother Graham goes on to say David was our Father shall was our Father is that supposed to keep the devil back we've had a messenger in this day is that supposed to keep the devil back it's got to be the same messenger who used a messenger that is in our hearts it's got to be the same Holy Ghost in us it's not how much we know the message the doctrines it's how much are we yielded to the God who brought it that this word would be placed in us think of it when brother Adam is preaching the seals what's he doing he's talking about a union a marriage that I just performed in the back office may it be a witness and a prophecy of what's gonna take place this week what is it he's presenting the tabernacle of God how because the tabernacle of God is come through all of the word that's been stored up down through the ages and then the administration of Solomon it's a gathering of all the Lucien's all the parts that's been laid down through there and bringing it together than what that Christ Himself might step into the body they didn't care what when they begin to get slack in their worship to God and in care although they held a form of religion just like we had we have they had a form of godliness but they begin to get free with their people and they begin to bring in different heresies in their church it didn't arrive that they have overnight but if you remember the scripture speaks of Lucifer thou art he who did it weaken the nation's deceive the nation's Satan does not have the power to overthrow outside of deception there's got to be a weakening he could not come into the Garden of Eden and lay his hands upon Eve until she walked out from behind the word as he talked to her however many days it was however long each duration of time it was to weaken causing her to let down to remove the penalty from her let me just tell you there's a real hell it's burning there is a hell it's not made for humans it's prepared for the devil and his angels but it's a real place and outside of knowing the Lord Jesus Christ and making him accepting him as your Savior and being filled with his spirit it's a sure place you see your destination this morning you can know it very clear but if it looks like your destination it's headed that way you say well how would I know what's the desire of your heart what brother Samuel I mean you know I want to serve God but is that really our burning in your heart or is it just something that you're saying or are you really sold out to it lock stock and barrel is it a testimony in your life the way that others can see you living that that indeed is a Christian it doesn't look like you're a Christian does it look holiness does it look godliness does it look pleasing to the Lord or is it more like the world if it looks like the world than its influences from below remember when brother Branham he said right there in JC Penney's he got sick the escalator came up and he's seen him with painted eyes he said just this way and there was those women they were painted up you know what pain is it's a facade it's a covering it's to try to make a presentation to try to cover up something that's there yeah you know what real paint daughters of God don't need paint once you've been painted by the blood of Jesus Christ on your soul you've got a covering that's real that's effectual that's alive on the inside of you and you recognize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder it is a beauty that is appealing to the Lord begin to get carefree well you know it don't matter just little by little little but remember what Delilah did Delilah just told Samson just let me know where your power and eyes if I can find where the secret of your strength is I'll dismantle you now watch how Solomon here Solomon's praying I'm just going to focus skip some of this for time but Solomon he addresses the people and he's blessing the congregation in first Kings eight and he says concerning it that how that you know that the Lord God that he would be with us in verse 57 as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us that he may incline our hearts unto him you know that's a beautiful word incline you see God wants you and I following and doing because we have a desire that he has placed within us in an amazing within a service how the Spirit of God will sweep right down and it draws you to say yes sergeant what's he doing inclining our heart he's inclining our heart God does not want just formalities of words he wants our hearts to be behind it notice how that he would go on Solomon would pray this I want to just leave this here he says in verse 61 let your heart therefore he's talking the blessing on the congregation let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his Commandments as at this day let it be complete let it be perfect now remember this is what David has prayed and told Solomon served the Lord with a complete heart with a willing mind a desire of the light to please him you know sometimes people just don't know what's right and what's wrong but when you tell them the word if there's something within their heart they rise up to and say amen I didn't see it before didn't realize this before but Amen it's in the word and I believe that this is God's desire for me you see what it is how do you respond to the word after the word brings correction oh my what a wonderful prayer that's been made but then when we go back and we moved back pages in the scripture and we find in some of the very beginnings there was a little speck of leaven that was already present notice it wasn't mentioned so much in some of these chapters that we've read it only was like a little speck that was mentioned but the Bible says in first Kings 3:1 and Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt God had brought him out of Egypt God never one of his people tied up in alliances with Egypt but a Solomon made affinity that is against God's Word yet Solomon chosen of God but notice what you begin to see is the unfolding here of these church ages you begin to see one little speck of leaven leavens the whole lump let me tell you something sin you can't Corral it you can't contain it you can't confine it to one little place remember sin itself will defile it'll spread through your life it's not one little area well I'll just happen in this chamber remember a heart it might be a heart that's 95% given to God but yet not a perfect heart a perfect heart is a complete oh my an affinity that were marriages remember what marriages do marriages brother man made it very clear he I love the way said it he said you take a bad man and a good woman they get married he said that man who either become a good man or she's going to become a bad woman union's themselves remember that's exactly how Satan how does Satan deal to invoke and bring God's judgment on is to bring about wrongful unions think about the very inspiration of the of the Gentile kingdoms of that which Daniel saw that fourth Kingdom it was iron that was spread throughout the clay the Bible said it would cause the seed to mingle with the seed of others what was it to break the power come on friends it wasn't just things were Protestants marrying Catholics but it's inner any inner breeding where the Word of God becomes hybridized the power is lost the authority is lost the holiness is lost its lost when it becomes mixed with the world sin enters through Union I watch this in second chronicles 8:11 Solomon watch this brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the City of David unto the house that he built for her and he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel because the places our holy wearing to the Ark of the Lord had come oh that sounds good don't it sheesh she can't dwell here if she can't dwell there you had no business marrying her come on somebody you had no business man her if she can't come into the house of God with you you had no business marrying her but Solomon ooh I can't let her remain here this place is holy old MA it shows every union the Bible is clear give no place to the devil in all you do in word or deed let it be done in the name of Jesus Christ if you can't do it in the name of Jesus Christ then let the Church of the Living God deep plot from sin you can't wear a split skirt in the name of Jesus you can't wear high heels in the name of Jesus Christ you can't wear painting nails in the name of Jesus Christ rather you can't look like a in the name of Jesus Christ come on somebody you can't listen to worldly music in the name of Jesus Christ over Samuel I'll listen to it off the fish that's stuff a number a bunch of trash come on somebody the things such worldly ism singing songs had nothing to do with Jesus look I'm not that old I'm a very young young man only 43 years old brother Terry with Amen that but you know I would go in the bookstore and you know what I'd see this is the little book stores in Elyria mall they had a little flip chart there and you know what it said on the flip chart if you like rap this is what you like here if you like R&B this is what you like here now we're talking this is back in the ancient days if you liked Metallica or heavy metal this is what you're like you see what it is substituting God hates substitution God loves reality I'm tell your friends there's a lot of things that need to be checked and listen it ain't just stuff there I'm telling you what I look at a lot of the things with southern gospel you wouldn't know if they're gonna start singing about the hound dog next or how they return somebody's wife they stole off this or whatever more it's saying all around we have a filter that's been given to us there is no excuse we've got a filter and that filter will never ever give us death it will always give us life but it matters what the desires are on the inside it's important that our desire is in line with God it's important to flee from sin without fleeing for sin you got to start worrying about adversaries you got to start worrying but if you just walk with God God said I'll be an adversary to your adversaries I'll be an enmity I'll be an enemy to your enemies Solomon had no business marrying her if he couldn't bring her in the house of God shouldn't even look at her he knew this is one that is all oh my goodness I just I don't know I mean you know but Solomon maybe Solomon showed up and Solomon came to the pastor and said pastor you know we believe in this election of God how can you pray and make him elect what nonsense come on friends prayer is the key come on somebody there's two things that the Prophet laid out in choosing of a bride prayer and study it over two simple simple things prayer give no place to the devil don't be unequally yoked you better know what they believe brother Daniel they go to message Church you better know what they believe you better make sure you're not just getting somebody with formality you better get somebody who loves God more than they love you because if they love God more than they love you when you get down they'll pick you up they'll punch you in the right way you want somebody that's connected with God you want a real Alliance a real union somebody who's there you want a godly husband that can say little too tight honey it's a little too short you need to lower it down we're separated people but not because we're message people were separated by the presence of God oh man brother Branham talks about a creeping paralysis and impotence on the lack of a power and authority they began to drift when people had begun to drift from the altar huh adulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost look at these words some earn an age and no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure Word of God knowledge of and adherence to it not just knowledge of it and he rents to it the brand goes on to tell us those unlawful alliances what it led to I want you to think of this here's try to find someplace here to get off Solomon's Rich's his wisdom the Bible says in first Kings 10:23 it exceeded all the kings of the earth exceeded all the earth sought to hear his wisdom Solomon was the preacher on the docket at the meetings and don't take me wrong you understand they sought to hear him why wanted to hear what God had put in his heart the Bible goes on to say in verse 25 and on down they brought every man his present he was recognized a tribute and honor to what God was doing but this next sure the beginning of chapter 11 after you've just come out of chapter 10 where the Queen of Sheba is the Queen of Sheba comes in and sees his house she sees even how that the meat is served she watches how he even walks up the steps and the Bible says she's seen how everything was so set in order in his house she said there was no spirit left with him it took away her breath this was something that was known a gift that God had placed within Israel and the people of Israel were rallying around the gift of God but verse one says but sometimes that's a good word when it says things like you who were dead in sins but this is not a good time for you but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites Sidonians and Hittites remember Jezebel was of the sidonians but evidently the one he married her daddy won the priest but you see a little heaven it wasn't enough just to have one strange wife you gotta have more he was addicted it grew in his heart it wasn't something he could just put a chain on and say you can't go no further in this it'll just be this right here no it'll keep going it'll lead from one thing to another to another to another sin takes ground but has sin takes ground so does righteousness stay ground as you're willing to allow your heart to be touched by dog gotta move right in there the Spirit of God will keep moving he'll push out all of the things as we allow him of the nation's concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel you shall not go into them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon clave unto these in love this is what's amazing here is a man who stood in the presence of God here is a man who was so aligned with God's heart that he could pray and God said I heard what you said that's what mom that's what my heart is concerning it how did he get to this place how does it come to a place to where he loves many strange women and it gets to this spot he's neglecting an area in his life he said that God's not dealing with it all no God's dealing with him he knows better it's not ignorant he knows God's dealing with him but yet he just keeps looking at it in a manner I got it under control let me tell you friends don't mistake the Spirit of God falling here in these services as you're okay the Spirit of God moves down in these services to bring conviction in your heart not to okay and put a cross on your T or a dot on your eye it comes down to move within our lives it ought to be a real witness that you know my heart has been drawn closer to God my life has been touched by God you leave out of here with a greater more fervent desire to serve Him not out of here for his God huh I made it to church today my one that a wonderful service miles say the presence of God just fell what did it do for you what did they do for you I'll tell you what it did for Moses when he got in the presence of God it made him realize like it did Isaiah I'm on done I am not fit for the task I'm talking about even when Collin has dental work in your life the presence of God brings humility it brings the place I want more Lord help me Lord God I want to live closer to you more determine what's he doing he's stirring up he's quickening the word that he's already sown in our hearts brother sister we're not operating by manpower were operating by quickening power his feelings his emotions the prince of god has come down he's been there but Solomon keeps going keeps going the Bible goes on to say in verse 3 his wives turned away his heart not his body his heart a lot of times people can stay in body and the hearts already gone they'll bring a body to church but the hearts outside somewhere else the heart is nowhere before the throne of God they really don't have no desire to be in the house of God they just simply show up because well you know it's Sunday there's nothing else to do oh my this is the greatest privilege of your life this will not always be this is a period of time for you and I have to be fed and be nourished don't you wait till the church doors are closed up it might be too late for you then but brother Samuel the bride still here but remember the door of the Ark was shut before rain ever fail we're living in the time of the third Pope we're living in the kind where the voice of God that's been building the preparation of the Ark down through the ages where the voice of God is heard from within the Ark come in come in and remember no I've been shut the door God called him in and God shut the door this is the day of mercy this is the day to get right with God this is today to make the Lord thy absolute to let him be the Lord of your life his body was still in church but his heart was gone it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after their gods and his heart look at this was not perfect complete with the Lord his God he makes you scratch your head you think he built the house of God all of this was done but his heart was not complete you see even then in the midst of all that was going on his heart wasn't complete it might started out one little speck but then it grew until all of a sudden people around him say what happened to him it was a speck that girl it was an area that wasn't surrendered it was a part that wasn't attended to you see where Solomon's problem was he was living on a past reputation he was living on past visitations God visited me once God spoke this through my daddy God spoke this through here but you know what you don't live by past reputations you can't live by what God did just last week that ain't good enough it's what about today it isn't about what you wore brother BAM said a question/answer 64 it's not about what you were 20 years ago what are you today you can't take 20 years ago and go before the presence of God that might have been gained an entrance a time ago you understand but the word it's real gone brother it comes to a time there's got to be an advancement in your life and one time it was all right you could say praise God God sent a prophet but that's not enough in this hour you've gotta recognize there's a message that has come a message that called us out of darkness that he himself might step inside of us and take us in rapture it's not enough to go upon a past reputation sudden you have all kinds of memories I have memories from when I was a little boy meetings and things would take place in camp meetings and all those things and hold brother Samuel if we can only go back to those days those were wonderful times but I wouldn't trade where I'm at right now for back there I will not trade in whatsoever the word itself it's richer his presence the reality of what God is in my life I wouldn't trade it for nothing but you know what the difference is the difference is depending on how you've given your heart to God Solomon said I got your building done said I know I want your heart yeah but I built you a building but I want your heart but Lord look at this building you know but I want your heart God was interested in Solomon's heart the Bible goes on to say here can I just have a few more moments [Music] Solomon went after aster offers five the goddess of the sidonians and after milking the abomination of the ammonites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord maybe in the rest of the congregation he's the upright guy but in God's eyes God said you're doing evil he sees let me tell you something what you do at your house if you couldn't invite anybody else from the church and you do it then you don't need to be doing it anything you can't do in faith is sin if they're saying look at this or I'll do that if you can't do that and invite somebody from here how in the world do you think to heaven the one in the presence of God in your home that he can come and sit down in your home come on somebody if he is and welcome he's only made welcome as you and I make him welcome so much of the time we look at services oh I want a good service do you realize what makes a good service it's not just you getting prepared on a Sunday morning getting up praying getting to church here a little early coming in pray and read your Bible getting ready make it look like you're anxious for something I didn't get an amen but I'm gonna preach anyhow make it look like it's a delight to come to the house of God that it's something you're waiting on that I'm waiting on God to come down not barely squeaking in the parking lot in the church doors but coming here at the place of anticipation to meet with God it's not just about that it turns on a half hour beforehand your preparation and meeting with God it ought to be every day of your life if the only time you get service about serious about serving God is on Thursdays if you do come on Thursday some of you and if it's on Sundays if that's the only time you're backslidden you're not really loving God the way you are - you're letting other things creep into your life that you all know let creep in let me tell you friends there's a lot of schedules there's a lot of things that can come your way that could try to hold you out all brother Samuel but if I have to do this and I have to do that listen your beer smart people you can evaluate what it is that's necessary and what it is you're allowing to crowd out your time with God come on the Holy Spirit is there he's able to bring conviction you know this is where it's very important when we look at the presence of God and services it's not something that the pastor packs in his bag it's not something that the musicians have or the song leader has it is a condition of the heart from brother Sandra when I come to the house of God I expect you and lifted up some of you I've been carrying around on my back so long about getting tired why don't you start being one who lifts others up instead of being worn who needs to be toted and packed around all the time I don't mind packing around the tabernacle of God but there's a time when you unpack it you unfold it you set it up and the presence of God comes down it out but it shouldn't be something that's packed over and over and over again it ought to be a place that set up that the presence of God can come down I know it's hard preaching but it will help you if you say man oh yeah it'll help you say man you watch the next couple services will be even more loose than they are right now Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as David his father he did evil well what's evil halfway halfway zville anything less than full and complete surrender is evil well if this if God will if this not full surrender it's got to be complete full surrender it's got to be him not just coming to this church because well it's a good church I I feel comfortable here don't let that be the reason but why is it that that you would come here maybe for some of you it's the only relief you have out of demon oppression and torments that comes around your life but let me tell you something you can have a Liberty than when you walk out this door them same demons that I have to flee under the preaching of the word you can have that same power within your soul you can have that same liberator that when you go out there that score mentor or a presser can come and you've got the goods on the inside because there's a stronger man let's move to the inside and it's pour down the strength of that one that's there there is a living power of a Living God where you find it hard to do this and I found it hard to live this way and find it hard to but if you ever meet him he will free you from what you think his freedom he will free you from the bondage of sin he will bring it a Liberty to we're living holy it's a pleasure it's a delight when he says let your hair grow you say thank you Lord I realize the Lord God what that represents when he says dress modestly free flowing clothing use thank you lord I realize my body is preserved for you hello its holiness unto the Lord I realized sometimes I can't get on today but I realized sometimes even on the men they've got to get get on sometimes we've got a bunch of sissies that's designing clothes nowadays come on somebody you go into the clothing rack and everything else everything's skinny tighten whatever more who designed that the same editors because you like your clothes loose well I mean like my clothes loose but I sure don't want to wear tight clothes I don't think it's becoming when I had tight clothes you know what mama did do the tight clothes put him in a GW bag and we took him to Goodwill because you know what they were too small to wear nowadays are too small to wear give them to somebody who's twice as big as you that's free that's free I'm talking about living before God in holiness Solomon built all these high places of verse 70 motion abomination and mohab in the heel that's poor for Jerusalem Moloch and the abomination of the children of Amon and likewise he did for all his strange wives which burn incense and sacrificed unto their God Solomon was a gifted man he know how to take a pattern and bring that pattern forth but there are certain patterns he didn't need to learn in his life there's certain patterns strains that he needed to overcome because these patterns of these houses these were God's houses for the gods of these women that he loved he made a place for them so that they would feel comfortable I don't know about you I don't want sin to feel comfortable I don't want the devil to feel comfortable I want him to squirm when things walk in that's not right with God we want to burn it open the same you ain't thinking about their heart well no I am thinking about your heart because if your heart isn't rescued by God that very thing going on can take you to a devil's hell God cares about every part of his word this is where James could say do not air my beloved brother look at this here's David God regards David as a perfect heart that is a paradox to me you say you say well what about that of the sin of Bathsheba that was there but there's one thing that's different is you go on and read here in the scripture God comes to Solomon and he tells Solomon because you haven't heeded to what I've commanded you the kingdom is gonna be rent from your hands I'm not gonna do it in the day of your lifetime but I'll do it in the days of your son what was his strength what was the strength of maintaining the kingdom kingdom is power Authority was a heart completely surrendered to go think about it if Solomon did what he did and not all of his heart was perfect before God think about it what about to a heart that's perfectly surrendered to God a heart that's perfectly surrendered look at this David's life difference between David and Solomon sure David had his points about him but the difference was David was willing to repent when he was wronged he was a man after God's own heart yet one that God was saying David was innocent David so good David never done nothing wrong no David repented when he was wrong they've been even knew what the sacrifices that I offer up God is not pleased with those outside of my heart being broken outside of my spirit being broken God doesn't want any of those other sacrifices David knew what it meant to repent and to be lying back up when he had gone out a lot he knew what it was to come in line but Solomon he kept going going and going yeah you know this isn't the only place that talks about this in Nehemiah Nehemiah stands against it and says remember Solomon's heart was led astray by outlandish women when they came into the land Azra Nehemiah they had to deal with it when they returned back from Babylon they had to deal with this mixing up with stuff so no God's people are to be separators I say were to be separators we're to be separate now because of war a message not because that we say well we believe that God sent a prophet we have a prophet we have a Bible no were to be separated unto the Lord by the presence of God and were separated by the presence of God believe me we reflect the presence of God in whom we dwell let's bow our heads I wonder this morning is our hearts just mindful before the presence of God I know I've ministered long here this morning but I pray that it's not escaped your hearts think very deeply are you closer to God now then you were when God first got a hold of your life or even last year or last month [Music] or do you notice in your life a subtle carelessness becoming carefree certain things that you wouldn't even look at now you give place to certain things you wouldn't even read things were there was a fervency to be in the house of God to be in the presence of God to be gathered together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith a fervency to live for the Lord this would be a good moment [Music] to let your heart has it's been moved by God I trust I trust my hearts have been moved by the Spirit of God this place remembers a said moments and moments ago this place is not always guaranteed well I can count on coming there the prints of God will be there no remember you've got your part you may not always be here there might be things that you would have in your heart you leave unattended and it can lead to a coldness in your life it can lead to a place to where it comes to a moment where did they go what happened to him but I wonder this morning if in your heart that you say Lord I want a perfect heart but remember having a perfect heart sometimes there's got to be a brokenness within your heart ground itself in order for seeds to take place remember sometimes there's seeds that can be sown but in order to counter affect counteract that there's got to be some ground that's broken up what I'm talking about there's got to be a real repentance in your heart real conviction that strikes your heart says the Lord I want to be closer to you Lord I want to lay aside all the foolishness of the world maybe it's things that you've been entertaining things may be in your wardrobe you've allowed to creep in you never would have allowed to be there before but influences one time you never would have given to it I'll ask you to look very deep throughout this building here this morning I don't doubt for a moment there's hearts they need to be liberated you need to be set free [Music] you need the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost to really see what God has done for you what he's done already for you if you just surrender your life to him not to an idea not to a church but to him saying what I'll give I want to give my all to you right there even in your heart you can come right up here to the altar the most important thing is is that your heart is an altar with God the most important thing is is that you leave out of here with a desire Lord I want the Holy Ghost more than anything Lord I want to fully surrender to heart Lord not a heart that's halfway maybe a heart here this morning you've got cold in your prayer life you got cold giving yourself to the Word of God listening to the message not valuing the things that God has given us this land the way that you ought to valuate maybe not valuing his presence when we come here service after service where you really give yourself to God when you like to make that consecration this morning say Lord I'm forsaken this coldness Lord I was not made to live in this coldness I don't want to live here I want to live in your presence remember before he ever left Israel and for sukham they already forsook him he's right he's right where you left him how many times brother branham will tell us maybe you left him at the dinner table where you stopped asking blessing over your food maybe you left him in the prayer closet you left him how about at this morning church how about it don't you want his presence to be the separating factor above everything else that that's what God said what identifier says his people and all he asked for is our heart to be surrendered to him this morning why don't you just let him search it out oh my I believe it do us good to really pour our hearts out well I'm not calling you to an emotion but I'm trying to bring you to a place to realize the word that's been delivered to us in this place don't let it go unattended Solomon but tend to it carefully that there be not houses erected for other gods don't let your job be a god don't let your occupation don't let schooling don't even let your family be your God let the Lord be your God [Music] we're gonna go in prayer [Music] if you'd like to come and pray you're more than welcome to wear cry insane
