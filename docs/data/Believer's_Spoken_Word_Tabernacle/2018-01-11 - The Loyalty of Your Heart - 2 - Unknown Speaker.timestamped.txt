[33:47] through all these things Lord and father
[33:49] were just Lord committing ourselves to
[33:52] you lord over this few moments that we
[33:55] have Lord to look into your word but
[33:57] pray that God that your Holy Spirit Lord
[33:59] that you would come Lord behind your
[34:02] word confirming it Lord Lord to every
[34:05] heart in every life and Lord just
[34:07] ministering to every need that's
[34:09] gathered here tonight Lord we pray Lord
[34:12] we just we give ourselves to you Lord
[34:14] that you would have the right away
[34:17] we love you and we praise you now Lord
[34:19] in the name of Jesus Christ amen god
[34:24] bless you if you turn on me tonight to
[34:26] Romans 8 and most of you got the news we
[34:31] had to just thought it best to cancel
[34:34] and to reschedule that with brother
[34:37] George and because of the weather that
[34:40] we saw that possibly be coming our way
[34:44] tomorrow and as well when I know later
[34:47] tonight as well as tomorrow and then
[34:50] Saturday but I'm just thankful we know
[34:56] that all things are in God's hands we
[34:59] know that so thankful we were able to
[35:02] get that rescheduled and so we just want
[35:06] to turn our attention to the word of the
[35:08] Lord just pray that God will just come
[35:11] and just speak to our hearts tonight in
[35:14] Romans chapter 8 verse 35 I want you to
[35:19] watch how Paul writes this here by the
[35:22] Spirit of God who shall separate us from
[35:27] the love of Christ shall tribulation or
[35:33] distress or persecution or famine or
[35:38] nakedness or pearl or sword so all of
[35:46] these all of these things that are here
[35:48] when you you consider this here
[35:51] tribulation distress persecution famine
[35:54] nakedness pearl and sword all of those
[35:59] you would think why does Paul use the
[36:01] word who are you with me why would he
[36:06] use who
[36:06] why wouldn't he use things it's because
[36:10] of the one who comes through these
[36:14] things to try to come at us so this this
[36:20] is first of all in just in this
[36:21] scripture alone this is discernment
[36:24] itself
[36:25] who not what who who so it's another
[36:30] person that we try to separate us from
[36:32] the person of Christ we'll ask you who's
[36:36] greater Satan or Christ so the love of
[36:42] Christ is that which God has placed in
[36:45] our hearts by the new birth so what who
[36:48] is it
[36:49] that can separate us from him nothing as
[36:56] it is written now watch this as it is
[36:59] written for thy sake we are killed all
[37:03] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[37:06] for the slaughter nay in all these
[37:10] things we are more than conquerors
[37:13] through him that loved us for I am
[37:17] persuaded that neither death nor life
[37:19] nor Angels nor principalities nor powers
[37:23] nor things present nor things that come
[37:25] Paul has put the whole rank of Satan's
[37:29] army right there
[37:30] doesn't matter what rank it is there's
[37:33] nothing greater than Christ is that
[37:37] right the devil as far as he's more than
[37:40] a match for you and I physically
[37:42] speaking but he's not more than a match
[37:45] for the Holy Ghost that's the truth nor
[37:50] height and then watch this in verse 39
[37:52] nor height nor depth nor any creature
[37:56] nor any other creature now when you look
[37:58] at that that thought in verse 39 nor -
[38:01] or death what is this dealing with why
[38:03] would Paul even include this and we know
[38:05] it's not Paul riding just by his
[38:07] knowledge but these given this
[38:09] inspiration hype or death deals with
[38:12] perception sometimes our perception is
[38:17] different based on where we're standing
[38:19] is that right perception itself can
[38:23] really change sometimes things can look
[38:25] much different when you get to a certain
[38:27] level so no matter the perception of it
[38:30] no matter how things look no matter how
[38:32] good they look no matter how bleak they
[38:33] look no matter what it is shall be able
[38:36] to separate us
[38:38] from the love of God which is in Christ
[38:41] Jesus our Lord may the Lord bless his
[38:46] word bless you as you're being seated
[38:49] I'd like to continue to speak on that
[38:52] thought the loyalty of your heart we
[38:56] know that within this that Hall is
[38:59] bringing this here this love itself is
[39:02] not a feeling of mind it's not even a
[39:06] feeling in our spirit because we can
[39:09] have a feeling of love within our spirit
[39:12] in our mind but yet that itself will
[39:15] fail but yet this love here that Paul is
[39:18] speaking of is that that agape love of
[39:21] God that love that has been placed
[39:24] within us or born in us by the new birth
[39:27] in our soul it's the actual substance
[39:30] that's there that holds us that keeps us
[39:33] even in the midst of even in the midst
[39:35] of things that where we don't understand
[39:37] in the midst when doubts would try to
[39:39] swirl gloom comes along disappointments
[39:43] happen there is a substance and anchor
[39:46] that nothing can get us away from that
[39:49] when Paul makes this declaration here
[39:51] what shall be able to separate us from
[39:54] the love of Christ who shall be able to
[39:56] separate us from the love of God so if
[39:58] this declaration is made within it we
[40:01] know that there are things that will
[40:02] actually try to come to separate the
[40:06] believer from the love of Christ from
[40:08] the love of God but if that is sown down
[40:11] in our heart by the new birth there is
[40:13] no separating that can take place at all
[40:17] that right nothing at all none no
[40:20] separation and all can take place but it
[40:23] is RIT is that of a the love affair and
[40:26] to think of it how that you know brother
[40:28] Brandon would place it in in different
[40:30] places where he would talk about the
[40:32] love of God of how that during the time
[40:34] when he was asked a question when
[40:36] everything happened where his wife was
[40:39] taken from him his daughter was taken
[40:41] from him and yet within the midst of it
[40:44] they would ask him how is your religion
[40:46] holding you and how are how are you
[40:49] holding on and he says it's not me
[40:51] that's whole
[40:51] hang on he said but he said there is
[40:53] something that struck my whole my soul
[40:56] one day he said the love of God he said
[40:58] to where it's it's held me and it's
[41:00] holding me in the midst of this there
[41:02] was no way that he could actually
[41:04] articulate or explain with words to
[41:08] explain the keeping and the holding
[41:10] power of the love of God it was
[41:12] something that if you want you to think
[41:14] of this for a moment now brother BAM
[41:16] tells us that when Satan came right up
[41:18] there next to that that crib or the bed
[41:21] to where that his little girl was laying
[41:23] and you'll hear brother Brown tell it in
[41:25] many different instances and you'll hear
[41:27] how the brother brems says Satan himself
[41:29] drew near in that moment and he begin to
[41:32] speak to him and remind him of all the
[41:35] healings and there's words that Satan
[41:37] injected in it that the prophet catches
[41:39] later on but those words that Satan was
[41:42] even injecting in the midst of the
[41:44] temptation was as though that it was the
[41:47] Prophet himself doing the healing he
[41:49] said you remember when you healed people
[41:52] you remember when you know you had
[41:54] people this and that and he continues to
[41:56] go through it and then he begins to
[41:58] relate to him as though that it was
[42:00] something you know web as by efforts and
[42:03] merits and works and you did all of this
[42:05] and look how he turns his back on you in
[42:08] the moment of time now remember here the
[42:10] Prophet tells us that that Gate of
[42:12] reasoning in the midst of that time he
[42:15] said everything that he was saying up to
[42:17] that time was exactly the truth is that
[42:21] right he said reasonings was ready it
[42:25] was in agreement but he said at that
[42:27] very moment when I was about to say if
[42:31] that's how he's going to be see in order
[42:34] to say I was about to say it there was a
[42:36] formation of thought that had come
[42:39] together and word was getting ready to
[42:41] usher out but there was something there
[42:44] that was able to correct it before it
[42:48] could ever be spoken what was that the
[42:50] love of God the love of Christ I hope
[42:53] you understand this that was not a
[42:54] doctor
[42:55] that was their doctrines are wonderful
[42:57] but friends doctrines do not bring a
[42:59] bird you with me
[43:01] doctrines can make people who are stood
[43:03] knowledgeable they can quote they can do
[43:06] all sorts of things have a good mind be
[43:08] able to put things together but that's
[43:10] not the experience nor is that the
[43:12] divine love of Almighty God the love of
[43:15] God is something of an experience where
[43:17] Christ himself has moved into your life
[43:19] and your life is changed and when that
[43:22] life and that change takes place listen
[43:25] if you've got the right spirit it'll
[43:27] lead you to the right doctrine you with
[43:30] me many times you know we hear it quoted
[43:32] well I'd rather have the right you know
[43:34] the right spirit and the wrong doctrine
[43:36] then to have the right spirit and the
[43:37] right doctrine you cannot have the right
[43:39] spirit and remain in the wrong doctrine
[43:42] that's impossible
[43:44] because the Spirit of God cannot dwell
[43:46] in error and neither can the Spirit of
[43:49] God in us allow us to dwell in error in
[43:52] doctrine in thought in Word or in deed
[43:55] so here when we when we look at this and
[43:59] when we see it you know if it was just
[44:01] loyalty brother band talks about the
[44:02] term loyalty he said if I was just loyal
[44:05] to that of a denomination he said Lord
[44:08] he said I would have been gone a long
[44:09] time ago you see if you were just if it
[44:11] was just somebody who was loyal to the
[44:14] message because of their doctrines and
[44:16] truths and well it's a good church and
[44:18] you know I really enjoyed you know
[44:20] brother Samuel and I are enjoy this or
[44:22] enjoy that if that's all the extent that
[44:23] the loyalty goes you're in trouble but
[44:26] the loyalty itself has got to be that
[44:28] you have met Christ face-to-face and you
[44:32] know in whom you have believed there is
[44:34] a reality that you are resting on not
[44:37] about that you can put everything
[44:38] together study everything know
[44:40] everything not at all it's about a life
[44:43] that is expressed through your life many
[44:45] times the enemy likes to try to pull
[44:48] things over on people because they can't
[44:50] understand this can't explain this but
[44:52] remember friends there are times for all
[44:54] of that when God wants us to understand
[44:57] when God wants us to see certain things
[44:59] and you know what the only thing that I
[45:01] want to be worried about is what God's
[45:02] bring it to my attention right now
[45:05] those are the things that I want to
[45:06] attend to if I'll give myself to that
[45:08] then all of those other things but I may
[45:11] not understand God will bring to and
[45:13] bring me to that just as I have need of
[45:16] it because God sees it right now that I
[45:19] really wouldn't have much need of it
[45:21] right now it might actually puff up my
[45:23] pride it might makes me more proud for
[45:25] whatever more but God knows just exactly
[45:27] when to give it when I have need of it
[45:31] so we want to be in loyal to be loyal to
[45:34] something as something very very great
[45:37] many times we find that where you can
[45:39] find that people are loyal people can be
[45:41] loyal to a job that's a wonderful thing
[45:43] if you're the one employing it is that
[45:44] right you want them to show up on time
[45:46] but yet you can have people who are
[45:48] loyal to a job but yet they come to the
[45:50] job complain about the boss talk about
[45:52] the boss whether they have us doing this
[45:53] this don't make sense this is ridiculous
[45:55] why they do this they're really not
[45:56] loyal to the job that yet they are
[45:58] coming so loyalty goes deeper than just
[46:01] us coming to something us coming to
[46:03] church us being around the message
[46:05] loyalty is deeper than that it's deeper
[46:07] than us being able to know it quote it
[46:09] be it's much deeper than that loyalty is
[46:11] dealing with life life and life deals
[46:16] with relationship there's no teaching
[46:19] that can teach relationship into you
[46:21] that is something between us and the
[46:23] Lord
[46:24] think of how brother Branham would tell
[46:25] us you know when he's asked a question
[46:27] or he's he's speaking about how that we
[46:30] in our lives would win others to the
[46:32] Lord he talks about how do we win our
[46:35] loved ones he said by you being the
[46:37] lawyer
[46:37] to what you believe so it's being the
[46:41] Lord you and he says staying in that
[46:42] condition and brother Branham actually
[46:44] that quote I'm referring to in questions
[46:46] unanswered 61 but the Branham is
[46:48] speaking of a young person who's setting
[46:50] in the Assembly at that time and brother
[46:52] Branham is pointing out in regards he's
[46:54] I won't call their name right now he
[46:56] said but I see them in the midst of
[46:58] parents aunts uncles everything else
[47:00] they stand loyal and they have the
[47:02] desire to stand loyal to the cause of
[47:05] Christ that's a great thing that loyalty
[47:08] because as we said moments ago when
[47:10] everything was lining right up they're
[47:12] coming against the Prophet at that time
[47:14] all of a sudden he spoke out
[47:16] he slay me but I've said here's what he
[47:19] says think about where it would have
[47:21] been if it hadn't been for that type
[47:23] host think about where it would have
[47:25] been if it hadn't been for that new
[47:27] birth so it shows it wasn't it wasn't
[47:29] the power the ability of all of the all
[47:32] of the great experiences that God had
[47:34] given him those experiences were
[47:36] absolutely priceless they were wonderful
[47:39] but friends listen when you could stack
[47:41] experiences from here clear to the moon
[47:44] and back but if there is not that within
[47:47] your heart and in your life all of the
[47:49] other it only puts that there is a
[47:51] living God and that living God who can
[47:54] stack all them experiences up wants to
[47:56] come and live in you what matters is
[47:59] there something that stands in the midst
[48:02] and the test of time
[48:03] this is where that even where Paul
[48:06] himself would speak think of how Paul
[48:08] would relate this concerning the love of
[48:10] God because we realize that when we have
[48:13] been born of the Spirit of God we have
[48:15] been born of the love of God God is love
[48:17] we have been born of the love of God the
[48:20] love of the truth now rest within our
[48:23] lives and here we are walking in a love
[48:25] affair not something we have to do we
[48:28] don't have to come to church we want to
[48:30] come to church and the Spirit of God
[48:32] speaks to us teaches us admonishes us on
[48:35] the value of things that sometimes we're
[48:38] doing and the Spirit of God will teach
[48:40] us in maturing us helping us to see a
[48:43] greater value wouldn't we see a greater
[48:45] value we come with a greater a greater
[48:47] discipline about our life we come with a
[48:50] greater reverence about our life so
[48:52] right so here Paul would pre would speak
[48:56] and you find Paul speaking of this over
[48:58] and over but Paul would speak of how
[49:00] that his desire in prayer is that how
[49:04] that the people of God there in Ephesus
[49:06] chapter three I believe it is where that
[49:08] they would know the depth height and
[49:10] breadth in Christ that they would know
[49:12] the love of Christ he spoke that they
[49:14] would know the love of Christ that
[49:16] passeth all knowledge knowledge is one
[49:19] thing that is wonderful is it not
[49:20] knowledge is something we must have you
[49:23] have to have knowledge knowledge is
[49:26] necessary the word is necessary that the
[49:28] word will
[49:28] preached and things will be put in order
[49:31] and but yet within that if that's all
[49:33] that it ever goes is just knowledge we
[49:35] hear a good word we hear a message God
[49:37] anoints and that word comes together so
[49:39] my iciness like I've never seen it
[49:42] before but remember the whole working of
[49:44] divine revelation is for God Himself to
[49:47] be able to move in preeminence in our
[49:49] life so in Revelation is struck in our
[49:53] hearts and it's truly been revealed
[49:55] it should come preeminent preeminent
[49:58] means giving first place right away in
[50:01] order to give first place and right away
[50:02] it requires one fading behind because
[50:05] you see God Himself does not work
[50:07] according to even the law of mathematics
[50:10] that he himself has set forth because
[50:12] God says one plus one equals one
[50:15] not one plus one equals two so in order
[50:18] now some of y'all much smarter than me
[50:20] in math you know this in order for one
[50:22] plus one to equal one one of those ones
[50:24] in between has got to decrease that the
[50:27] other can increase so the way that God
[50:29] brings forth that is this Union is to
[50:32] where what is actually going to be seen
[50:34] and portrayed and his desire from our
[50:37] life is that Christ would be the one
[50:39] who's on display that's his work we are
[50:41] his workmanship so to think of how that
[50:45] within this the great love of God that
[50:48] bringing forth that loyalty that
[50:49] breathed beats that of a of a trueness
[50:52] in our life I want to go back into the
[50:54] message three kinds of believers and
[50:55] just move on here tonight the RAM says
[50:58] sometimes believers put to the test not
[51:00] sometimes every time for every Sun that
[51:04] cometh to God must be chastened tried
[51:07] and child trained remember he said the
[51:11] trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of
[51:14] persecution but the loyalty of your
[51:17] heart beats that material till she's
[51:21] ready to come into the mold God's
[51:23] children is made up correctly on his
[51:25] word for they are living examples and
[51:27] the Word of God living through them so
[51:30] the loyalty now watch this the trial
[51:32] itself coming is not what brings the
[51:36] molding the trial doesn't bring the
[51:39] molding but the trial brings
[51:42] conditions that loyalty itself can come
[51:45] forth and beat material into the right
[51:48] place
[51:49] consistency whatever he desires so there
[51:53] is a need for the trial but when we
[51:55] looking at the trial
[51:56] it's the loyalty that is there that
[51:59] actually under that trial will beat the
[52:02] material what material our character hmm
[52:06] notice he said the trial comes to shake
[52:09] you to put you to the very bottom to see
[52:13] where you'll stand they Ted they tested
[52:16] tried every Son of God now notice in
[52:18] Romans 5 verse 1 therefore being
[52:21] justified by faith we have peace with
[52:23] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[52:25] whom also we have access by faith into
[52:28] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[52:31] in hope of the glory of God now watch
[52:34] this and not only so but we glory in
[52:38] tribulations also glory we glory in
[52:44] tribulations also how can you glory now
[52:48] I'm not going to deal with the glory
[52:49] part tonight but how can you glory in
[52:52] tribulations ah understanding so here's
[52:57] where knowledge itself understanding
[52:59] coming to us and us submitting to that
[53:02] to where ah oh now I see but just seeing
[53:08] doesn't mean that all of a sudden
[53:09] magically we're just right there we're
[53:12] pliable no it brings us to an
[53:14] understanding wait a minute here
[53:17] I know where I'm standing lord I don't
[53:20] understand everything that's going on
[53:22] but I know I'm in you Lord I'm resting
[53:25] in you I don't know what's gonna come
[53:26] out of this but I am trusting you I need
[53:29] your grace to help see me through
[53:34] knowing that knowing knowing that
[53:37] tribulation worketh patience
[53:41] this sounds like patience has got to be
[53:45] matured
[53:48] so you mean when I receive patients from
[53:51] the Lord
[53:51] I just don't receive automatically your
[53:55] patience is completely perfect your raps
[53:58] already set out and wait on the rest of
[54:00] us
[54:00] no no tribulation worketh patience now
[54:09] that every one of us remember when you
[54:11] first started serving the Lord you know
[54:13] there were things my goodness that God
[54:14] was answering prayer there were things I
[54:17] mean where you see miracles I talk about
[54:18] things that wasn't long durations of
[54:20] time you've seen a prayers answered
[54:22] miracles you say brother send oh why
[54:24] isn't that now well let's first of all
[54:26] go back to why that was at first it's
[54:29] the same way it was in the book of Acts
[54:30] when there were many different ones whom
[54:33] God would have said brought special
[54:35] miracles by the hands of Paul and God
[54:38] would rule I would god right or what
[54:40] those miracles remember God doesn't do a
[54:42] miracle to show off but God does a
[54:45] miracle to declare his presence that
[54:47] what he said I am here to confirm that
[54:50] the experience that he's talking about I
[54:53] am here to confirm that and in our early
[54:56] journeys in our walks in our life as an
[54:59] as a Christian and early on mother's
[55:01] things that God is just confirming and
[55:03] building our faith in my it just seems
[55:05] like my goodness
[55:06] every morning we're eating frosted
[55:08] flakes with angels I mean we're eating
[55:11] Donuts with angels everything just all
[55:13] around and then all of a sudden you
[55:15] think my goodness
[55:17] where did these trials come from where
[55:24] these women persecutions I mean you know
[55:26] there were persecutions that you would
[55:28] shout about when somebody say your Holy
[55:30] Roller well your Branagh might there
[55:33] would be parts about it that you know if
[55:35] it's steam you began at the same time
[55:37] you would say God thank you for allowing
[55:39] me to be identified but yet those
[55:42] persecutions those things will start
[55:44] coming in different angles than what
[55:46] they've ever come before is that right
[55:48] and yet within that God is still molding
[55:52] and working and causing our patience to
[55:57] come forth
[55:58] verse four and patience now what's this
[56:01] tribulation worketh patience and
[56:03] patience experience so there's no
[56:06] tribulation there's no working of
[56:08] patience there's no working of
[56:10] experience you know your experiences are
[56:15] precious absolutely your experience
[56:19] unless in you ever been around sometimes
[56:20] you tell somebody you're experienced and
[56:22] I'm not talking about you know
[56:23] necessarily how that God done a complete
[56:26] work in your life and birthed you into
[56:28] the kingdom because sometimes let me
[56:29] just say this to you sometimes you know
[56:31] when you get to looking at things
[56:32] sometimes people are so beat up because
[56:34] they can't seem to find I don't know the
[56:36] day nor the time but what you have to
[56:38] understand do you know the life for this
[56:41] season that's living out that's what's
[56:44] it that's what it is that's what's
[56:45] important hope you understand what I'm
[56:48] saying
[56:48] so within this on where I was going I'm
[56:51] talking about experiences where you can
[56:53] just say my goodness I'm gonna share
[56:54] this one you know I get the use of
[56:56] meeting tonight I'm gonna share this
[56:57] when I get to the house of God tonight
[56:58] I'm gonna share this with brother
[56:59] so-and-so and you're trying to tell him
[57:01] and tell him what it's all about huh
[57:02] yeah brother that's really wonderful
[57:05] that's good brother praise the Lord
[57:07] that's good brother but you mean you
[57:09] were expecting them to you know swing
[57:10] you know like monkey bars from the
[57:12] chandeliers and say glory that God
[57:14] hallelujah my goodness but you see that
[57:17] experience was for you that experience
[57:20] was called building your faith and we
[57:22] need God to continue give us experiences
[57:25] to build our faith we still need the
[57:28] miracle working God to work miracles
[57:30] signs and wonders and he still the same
[57:33] God who does it again and again we need
[57:36] that
[57:37] - what continue to build our feet the
[57:42] Prophet says I never again the end of
[57:43] third Exodus is his praying he says
[57:45] father every once in a while will you
[57:48] come by our way and perform a miracle
[57:50] that we might know you are with us glory
[57:57] experiences experiences themselves and
[58:00] lives and we can look all across this
[58:02] building tonight and knowing you know
[58:04] and to think of seeing the older even
[58:06] the younger there's experiences within
[58:08] every person's life
[58:11] I like hearing experiences myself long
[58:15] as they don't go too long no I'm just
[58:19] even I like hearing experience I like
[58:22] hearing experiences myself I really do
[58:24] I enjoy you know I remember I told uh
[58:27] you know I've said this many times I
[58:28] remember when we first started doing
[58:29] them the youth meetings there at the
[58:31] house I think back in 2005 and my
[58:33] goodness man we'd get everybody together
[58:35] both John I mean after I got done with
[58:37] Bible study I had him working with Plato
[58:39] in their hands and all those sorts of
[58:41] things I love that how God leads I bring
[58:43] Plato in here for you if he led me to
[58:45] but I mean working with these things but
[58:47] after I get done with Bible study for 45
[58:49] minutes maybe a half hour all of a
[58:51] sudden is silent nobody was talking
[58:55] nobody I mean and all of a sudden I had
[58:58] to try to say okay you get an activity
[59:00] going here and you know they have to
[59:02] write you know is they're getting
[59:03] activity so I focused you know we also
[59:05] trying to get you know building where
[59:07] people are able to be comfortable around
[59:09] one another not now not now after the
[59:14] Bible study is over I can run in the
[59:15] corner and everybody just keep on going
[59:17] and all of a sudden when they'll get
[59:18] ready leave say oh we want to shake his
[59:21] hand now this is what I'm trying to say
[59:25] within that they're not just talking
[59:26] about playing things and doing this and
[59:29] doing that I'll tell you what what
[59:31] things that excites me and is that when
[59:33] I hear them talking about the Lord and
[59:36] what God is doing in their life and how
[59:39] God is bringing them along that that
[59:41] tightens me up so tight like a string
[59:43] sometimes it's hard for me to go to bed
[59:45] but that's the same way it is with each
[59:48] of us what I'm saying is is that
[59:49] experiences themselves have a way of
[59:52] just somehow just reaching to our heart
[59:54] speaking to us but yet those experiences
[59:57] are so defined for you just like your
[1:00:01] tests and your trials are defined for
[1:00:04] you defined for me and patience
[1:00:07] experience and experience hope think of
[1:00:10] David there's David he walks in on
[1:00:12] Goliath but what if he had not had the
[1:00:14] bear in the lion
[1:00:15] he's still a believer but those
[1:00:17] experiences right there had brought such
[1:00:21] of a patience there within his life that
[1:00:23] David could stand there and say you know
[1:00:26] I don't know how to fight this guy with
[1:00:28] all this stuff but what I know is that
[1:00:30] he has spoke against the armies of the
[1:00:33] Living God I don't care how sorry they
[1:00:36] were I don't care how many pews they
[1:00:39] were hiding behind they were still the
[1:00:41] army of God
[1:00:42] hey man and David said they are God's
[1:00:46] children and you spoke against God's
[1:00:48] children daddy man I believe that that's
[1:00:50] the kind of stand but we ought to take
[1:00:52] and should we maintain as believers in
[1:00:55] the Lord no matter how weak or this or
[1:00:57] that they still you're speaking against
[1:00:59] God's children now right and David
[1:01:03] walked out there now notice how the
[1:01:05] Prophet tells us and I've heard but now
[1:01:07] see he said David walked out there not
[1:01:09] knowing what was going to take place but
[1:01:11] he walked out there why because he could
[1:01:13] stand on God's Word this was an affront
[1:01:16] to the people of God let me tell you
[1:01:18] something it was not David that put
[1:01:20] Goliath on the ground it was God through
[1:01:23] a yielded voice of what the tribulation
[1:01:26] and work patience and patience
[1:01:27] experience and there he was standing in
[1:01:30] hope with an expectation that God will
[1:01:33] bring this thing down to see the
[1:01:39] earliness in our life was not for naught
[1:01:42] remember what God David by the Spirit of
[1:01:46] God I think it Psalms 103 whenever
[1:01:48] reading on the mercies of God and David
[1:01:51] begins to speak of how that I said our
[1:01:54] people he said understood us not the
[1:01:57] miracles that were done in Egypt they
[1:02:01] didn't understand what the miracles were
[1:02:02] all about they looked at the miracles as
[1:02:05] just do what was big and understand it
[1:02:07] was God confirming his presence that the
[1:02:09] same God who is present is the same God
[1:02:11] who will take you all the way they
[1:02:14] didn't understand that that God has a
[1:02:16] desire for the work of his hands but
[1:02:18] here this hope hope maketh not ashamed
[1:02:23] David's expectation you know what I
[1:02:25] don't know how God's gonna do this but
[1:02:28] this right here has come against I don't
[1:02:31] know how God's going to do it there can
[1:02:33] be things where the devil can rattle
[1:02:34] his mouth against you and you may not
[1:02:38] feel like you've got an answer come on I
[1:02:41] hope somebody preach with me you may not
[1:02:43] have an answer a matter of fact he might
[1:02:44] slide something your way that you look
[1:02:46] at and it seems like it starts to move
[1:02:48] and reverberate through your spirit you
[1:02:50] find that you're looking at I don't have
[1:02:51] an answer I don't have an answer but
[1:02:52] notice there is an anchor that holds in
[1:02:55] the midst of all those reverberations
[1:02:57] that I know and whom I have believed I
[1:03:01] know and you stand there in the midst of
[1:03:05] that time what are you waiting on
[1:03:06] inspiration and all of a sudden you'll
[1:03:09] hear our inspiration it might come
[1:03:10] through a minister might come on your in
[1:03:12] prayer you might be listening to a
[1:03:14] message you might be reading many times
[1:03:16] this happened to me with things we're
[1:03:17] out here the prophets voice of a quote
[1:03:20] that has been said it'll come right to
[1:03:22] me right then in there but you say we're
[1:03:25] brothers have a wife doesn't that come
[1:03:27] right at first I mean I want to be able
[1:03:28] to stand there and just go prettier but
[1:03:33] you see it's not based on your pity it's
[1:03:36] based on loyalty and loyalty is not
[1:03:40] something that can be pinned down this
[1:03:43] kind of loyalty that was tried to be
[1:03:45] pinned down by a man who was in the
[1:03:47] insane institution oh love of God how
[1:03:50] rich and pure how measure less and
[1:03:53] strong his shall forever more endure the
[1:03:59] saints and angels song hallelujah hope
[1:04:04] maketh not ashamed David wasn't it this
[1:04:05] is God doesn't make the expectation that
[1:04:08] it's a shame that it's confounded but
[1:04:11] there's an expectation that God Himself
[1:04:13] is gonna move in this it's just like
[1:04:14] when you prayed sometimes where you pray
[1:04:17] things don't happen the way that you've
[1:04:18] asked for them to happen you're going
[1:04:20] through a test or trial
[1:04:21] maybe there's something a sickness or
[1:04:22] condition a financial need or whatever
[1:04:24] and you're praying and you're looking at
[1:04:25] a certain way and it seemed like mine it
[1:04:27] seems like this Wayne's gonna open and
[1:04:29] that's not the way that opens but notice
[1:04:31] within the midst of it standing with an
[1:04:33] expectation that I don't know how I
[1:04:36] don't know when but I know that God is
[1:04:39] in control that's trust
[1:04:45] that's patience
[1:04:46] this is what hope maketh not ashamed
[1:04:49] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:04:52] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:04:54] given unto us these are realities right
[1:04:59] this is a reality of something that
[1:05:01] takes place even as a husband and wife
[1:05:03] are coming together in a union so that
[1:05:07] they don't they're not walking off you
[1:05:09] know and many times at times when I've
[1:05:11] talked with different and different ones
[1:05:12] you know I don't want to scare nobody
[1:05:14] because I don't put any things up like
[1:05:16] its to be scary but there is parts of
[1:05:18] their realism that there's a reality
[1:05:20] this is not Cinderella it is happily
[1:05:25] ever after but I got to talk about the
[1:05:28] tests and trials because if tests and
[1:05:31] trials in the spirit shall bring you
[1:05:33] together it's gonna be tests and trials
[1:05:36] in the natural that won't somebody it's
[1:05:40] easy when everything is going well
[1:05:42] hey man it's easy to come to church when
[1:05:45] you feel good and my goodness man
[1:05:47] where's that devil at but it requires
[1:05:50] loyalty when you don't when you think
[1:05:54] you know what tonight I they don't need
[1:05:56] my man there I'll just stream you know I
[1:05:59] just believe that God understands my
[1:06:01] lazy boys more comfortable than mine
[1:06:03] then that few you know that few can get
[1:06:04] awful hard and I've got arthritis in my
[1:06:07] back and come on somebody sometimes it's
[1:06:12] not about what's convenient for us
[1:06:15] there's a lot more things that's
[1:06:18] convenient for us today what have been
[1:06:21] more convenient how about I just sends
[1:06:23] you a PDF for the notes I'm going to
[1:06:25] preach we will leave a we don't even
[1:06:29] need to have a building now I just send
[1:06:30] you a PDF of the notes and scriptures
[1:06:32] and quotes or whatever more but you know
[1:06:34] what of everything that I can give
[1:06:36] myself to the Lord but there are things
[1:06:38] that the Holy Spirit will speak right
[1:06:40] through here and right in this time that
[1:06:42] are not even written down there but
[1:06:44] he'll bring that to light and bring it
[1:06:46] right down to our lives for what we have
[1:06:47] needed that is the mind of Christ
[1:06:50] setting down
[1:06:51] among us to give us direction that is
[1:06:53] his love to care for you and I who Lord
[1:07:00] be to God get that thought out of my
[1:07:01] mind
[1:07:04] amen oh yeah hope maketh not ashamed
[1:07:07] because the love of God this is why
[1:07:11] because the love of God
[1:07:13] you shared abroad in our hearts by the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost which is given unto us so
[1:07:20] it's not just something that has been
[1:07:21] just somewhat placed there and it's just
[1:07:23] resting there but this love of God is
[1:07:25] shed abroad little white button but it
[1:07:30] spreads it spreads it grows it grows
[1:07:38] notice of three kinds of believers he
[1:07:42] said job went through the trials in the
[1:07:44] tests his children taken everything else
[1:07:48] taken the church members come accused
[1:07:51] him of being a secret sinner and tried
[1:07:53] to say everything against him but yet he
[1:07:57] wouldn't listen to any of it wouldn't
[1:08:01] listen to any of it but yet what he was
[1:08:03] hearing was also affecting you but the
[1:08:07] effect could not dismember or separate
[1:08:11] what was in his soul his spirit he
[1:08:15] became weary all right
[1:08:17] he became weak but yet this is where the
[1:08:22] love of Christ proves listen friends how
[1:08:24] are things proven to be as strong how is
[1:08:27] the faith listen this faith that God has
[1:08:29] given to you and I this revelation how
[1:08:31] is the strength of it tested by the
[1:08:36] persecution the tests the trials that
[1:08:41] come our way are you with me this is a
[1:08:45] loyalty that goes beyond knowledge you
[1:08:52] with me because just knowing that I
[1:08:55] ought to go to church that'll fade
[1:08:56] there's gonna be times when my flesh
[1:08:58] doesn't want to
[1:09:01] just like a brother brother John can
[1:09:03] tell you sitting right here as a
[1:09:04] minister there's times when the flesh
[1:09:06] don't feel like sitting down and
[1:09:07] studying all bullets Sam you know I
[1:09:10] always want to study well I'm what I'm
[1:09:13] trying to tell you is that as you're
[1:09:14] sitting down and here there's things
[1:09:16] your flesh everything can come against
[1:09:18] you it can start to be weak and here you
[1:09:20] are you're waiting on God sometimes
[1:09:21] listen friends there's inspiration
[1:09:22] sometimes that'll flood right in here
[1:09:25] and I can look at it and say dear Lord
[1:09:26] this is gonna be weeks on end then
[1:09:28] there's other times of when there's
[1:09:29] something that'll come and I'm looking
[1:09:31] at I think Laura I don't know how
[1:09:32] exactly how to bring this I don't know
[1:09:34] how to go about it and God will reserve
[1:09:36] that and keep that back with them that
[1:09:38] time and all of a sudden when I get here
[1:09:40] it's like he just pops it and there it
[1:09:43] comes out but in the midst of that time
[1:09:45] there's some times where the inspiration
[1:09:47] flows and it seems like they have just
[1:09:49] opened the fire hydrant out of here and
[1:09:50] it's just gushing out yeah so where I
[1:09:54] can't wait to go to sleep at night so
[1:09:55] and get up in the morning that's the
[1:09:58] truth then there's other times where
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:04] you'll remember nothing else out of this
[1:10:06] message
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:09] gotta help you connect it right
[1:10:15] sometimes you don't feel but this is
[1:10:19] where in those times that we don't go by
[1:10:20] feelings there's times that I worship
[1:10:22] because I feel to worship boy I mean I
[1:10:25] feel I don't matter where I'm at if I
[1:10:27] want to dance I'm gonna dance how I just
[1:10:29] feel but then there's other times I
[1:10:32] don't feel those are in those times
[1:10:37] where we can say lord I love you there
[1:10:42] have been many times throughout even
[1:10:44] this past year and I think of my mama
[1:10:45] thinking brother Doug different ones
[1:10:46] there's been times when the waves of
[1:10:48] missing my dad is hitting me it's hit me
[1:10:50] so hard sometimes on some of the nights
[1:10:52] where I just had to kind of I've gotta
[1:10:54] you know gone away somewhere sometimes
[1:10:55] it seems like it hits me at hard times
[1:10:57] but there's one thing I can say in the
[1:10:58] midst of it when it begins to come tears
[1:11:00] flow down so thank you Jesus what a
[1:11:03] comfort you are to me Lord
[1:11:04] what a comfort you are Lord what
[1:11:06] strength you are Lord God what would I
[1:11:09] do with that here what would anyone else
[1:11:11] for the heart different once it's lost
[1:11:13] their spouse what would you do if it was
[1:11:15] not for the Lord or different brothers
[1:11:18] and sisters that sit right here among us
[1:11:20] thank God for the strength and the
[1:11:22] comfort of the Lord amen I love him I
[1:11:27] love him more now than I did yesterday
[1:11:30] yeah he's more precious to me right now
[1:11:34] but he want us when he got ahold of my
[1:11:37] life way back
[1:11:39] hallelujah jump didn't listen to any
[1:11:42] other you know you can hear a lot of
[1:11:43] stuff but there's a difference in
[1:11:45] hearing it and listening to it you can
[1:11:49] hear stuff how do you know - shut stuff
[1:11:50] off if you don't hear it but to listen
[1:11:54] to it is to take it in what job was
[1:12:00] hearing he could come in but it could
[1:12:03] not reach and separate in his soul job
[1:12:07] started trying to justify himself right
[1:12:10] there in their presence he got to talk
[1:12:11] in their language but he still was not
[1:12:16] separated from the love of God
[1:12:19] he no look at this he knowed he had met
[1:12:23] God's requirements he knows there's no
[1:12:26] need of Satan trying to tempt him Satan
[1:12:32] couldn't tell Joe Joe
[1:12:34] this is foolishness it's all in your
[1:12:37] head man
[1:12:38] it's all made up this whole day it's all
[1:12:40] worked up there's nothing to this why
[1:12:44] don't you just go on back
[1:12:48] nope said excuse me you can't talk me
[1:12:53] out of this because I didn't get talked
[1:12:55] into it I wasn't talked into this
[1:12:59] I wasn't schooled into this I know I've
[1:13:02] met God's requirements so he stood on
[1:13:08] what he knew what he didn't know he knew
[1:13:15] that God would make it know the right he
[1:13:19] was God's prophet and God will make now
[1:13:23] he don't tell his prophets everything
[1:13:24] but he'll make known to them what they
[1:13:26] have need of if God does that way with
[1:13:27] the prophets how much more you and I God
[1:13:30] doesn't tell us every little single
[1:13:32] thing he tells us what we need when we
[1:13:34] have need of it what's that that's
[1:13:37] called faith walking by faith mom imon
[1:13:44] he know it was the devil so right away
[1:13:47] that that right there that's not going
[1:13:49] any further I know that's the devil you
[1:13:52] see there's some times where you have to
[1:13:54] just stand right on that you know who it
[1:13:56] is
[1:13:57] you know who it is by what's being said
[1:14:03] there right and you judge listen you
[1:14:06] judge this by the desire that is in your
[1:14:09] life you with me
[1:14:11] you judge it by the desire you know
[1:14:13] what's in your heart by the desire in
[1:14:16] your heart he knowed it was the devil
[1:14:20] and as long as Satan can make him
[1:14:24] believe that his sickness was his God
[1:14:27] doing it he had job
[1:14:30] but Joe being whipped was not losing the
[1:14:35] love of Christ where was he with that in
[1:14:39] his thinking
[1:14:40] where was he whipped at in his emotions
[1:14:43] you see God doesn't want you and I being
[1:14:45] whipped in our mind whipped in our
[1:14:47] emotions he wants that love of Christ to
[1:14:50] move out into those other areas and same
[1:14:53] piece but these are the areas where
[1:14:59] Satan wants to try to work but those are
[1:15:01] the areas that you and I have to rule
[1:15:04] rule but when Joe once struck that
[1:15:09] revelation 9 that it was not God he was
[1:15:13] only going through his trials to make
[1:15:17] him something so these trials it's not
[1:15:22] the trial it's what is going to be made
[1:15:24] out of it so the trial is only an
[1:15:30] instrument the trial is only a tool
[1:15:33] right I mean when it comes to buying
[1:15:36] furniture like these pews okay
[1:15:39] this right here that we had we had this
[1:15:41] this custom-made years ago right from
[1:15:44] from my dad brother Richie
[1:15:45] had had to had that done by
[1:15:46] cabinetmakers you know what when you
[1:15:48] look up here I don't see one tool you
[1:15:51] see it - I don't see a tool not know
[1:15:53] there's woodworking - my brother brother
[1:15:55] Dave crest senior he has his own
[1:15:57] woodshop there at his house this kind of
[1:16:00] stuff fascinates me because I'll tell
[1:16:02] you laying carpet doing this and paintin
[1:16:04] this to me as gifts you say what you
[1:16:07] want it's a gift
[1:16:09] yes sir not to me I value those things
[1:16:12] being in the lay floor I think that's it
[1:16:14] that's a tremendous gift but I look at
[1:16:17] this I don't see one tool and yet I know
[1:16:19] they had to use a router right here no
[1:16:22] doubt they used a bandsaw in different
[1:16:23] parts on prior to the joy be able to
[1:16:25] tell me certain things that they that
[1:16:26] was done with on this right here and be
[1:16:28] just by looking at it they may had to do
[1:16:29] this and maybe had to do this right over
[1:16:31] here but when I was when I see this I
[1:16:33] don't see the tools but I know there
[1:16:34] were tools that were used to make this
[1:16:37] but you see it's not the tool that's
[1:16:39] highlighted it's the
[1:16:41] of the tool the trial is not what the
[1:16:45] highlight is it's what comes out of the
[1:16:48] trial it's the product that comes
[1:16:51] forward God uses many different tools
[1:16:54] sometimes it's a bandsaw sometimes he
[1:16:57] uses a router sometimes it's a table saw
[1:16:59] but all of those are only tools to cut
[1:17:03] the wood put angles to finish it
[1:17:06] sometimes it's a sanding now it's all
[1:17:08] done for one purpose that the end result
[1:17:12] we can enjoy it I may not see the tools
[1:17:18] around your life I can look back and
[1:17:22] look across this assembly here I don't
[1:17:24] see tools when I look at brother Bill
[1:17:25] Sanchez I don't see a bunch of tools
[1:17:27] right look at brother Carlos look a
[1:17:30] brother Richard look at all the
[1:17:32] different brothers I even look at you
[1:17:33] brother you know I don't see craftsman I
[1:17:38] don't look over brother Joey and say the
[1:17:40] Walt black & decker I don't see tools
[1:17:45] what you see is a product that's been
[1:17:48] formed of tools and yet you know that
[1:17:52] that individual that individual young
[1:17:54] tall has went through trial after trial
[1:17:57] test after test why to make you an out
[1:18:01] where we are tonight so we're not
[1:18:05] highlighting the trial
[1:18:07] we're not glory in the trial we glory
[1:18:11] because the product that comes out of it
[1:18:18] his trials was just to make him
[1:18:20] something once job caught wind of that
[1:18:25] hidden and amazing God just didn't stop
[1:18:28] this trial brother you know he just
[1:18:29] didn't say stop you've already messed up
[1:18:33] he didn't stop it this is all part of it
[1:18:36] you see this trial right here is
[1:18:38] dissolving parts of job it's getting rid
[1:18:43] of parts of job and need to be gotten
[1:18:45] rid of Scott knows what he's doing
[1:18:49] personally even to her job would stand
[1:18:51] there seemed like his faith is faltering
[1:18:52] but his soul is not faltering
[1:18:55] listen to me friends you wonder when you
[1:18:57] read it in the book of Joe there's the
[1:18:59] thing where seems like the faith can can
[1:19:01] go away I'm not talking about the faith
[1:19:02] and anchoring yourself but I'm because
[1:19:04] that is an anchor that cannot be part at
[1:19:06] all
[1:19:08] you understand me I've got my faith wear
[1:19:11] it so believe in trusting but it's right
[1:19:12] here within our mind that right there
[1:19:14] can see my I can't put this together
[1:19:16] that's why the Prophet could tell us
[1:19:18] what the biggest part of our faith is
[1:19:20] intellectual faith right but don't let
[1:19:24] it remain there right
[1:19:26] it starts out that's where knowledge
[1:19:28] that's where understanding of the word
[1:19:30] even these things that I'm ministering
[1:19:32] right here tonight that the Lord would
[1:19:33] lead us on the service if it stays no
[1:19:35] more than intellectual faith you'll walk
[1:19:37] right out of here text me tomorrow call
[1:19:39] me tomorrow or do whatever you listen
[1:19:44] friends I don't ever I don't ever put
[1:19:45] nobody down because they're weeping like
[1:19:47] that I want you understand this but what
[1:19:49] I'm trying to tell you is is that God
[1:19:51] wants us to have understanding now I
[1:19:56] don't put people down if somebody calls
[1:19:58] me and they're crying are all upset
[1:20:00] let's go to the word and let's see what
[1:20:01] dr. Jesus can do because I'm what I'm
[1:20:04] interested in is that if they're in that
[1:20:06] in that place right there there's
[1:20:08] something that's bothering them
[1:20:09] something that's troubling
[1:20:10] let's get among the word let's get the
[1:20:13] word because the water will stabilize
[1:20:15] all emotions the wired will cast out all
[1:20:18] fear that love of God works and not just
[1:20:21] it to do it for the moment it builds
[1:20:23] them hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:20:27] hi I'm not here ministering and
[1:20:28] pastoring to make a group of people
[1:20:30] dependent on me I won you're so anchored
[1:20:33] and established in Jesus Christ because
[1:20:37] you're going to face you're gonna face
[1:20:38] tests and trials and whatever more and
[1:20:40] what happens if the sale or network goes
[1:20:41] down but there's one network that
[1:20:45] neither sleeps nor slumbers everything
[1:20:51] else that can come that network is still
[1:20:53] active and if you have been activated
[1:20:55] and baptized in for that network guess
[1:20:59] what you have access just as much as I
[1:21:01] do
[1:21:03] if you need to call him up call him up
[1:21:07] you need to text him text him you need
[1:21:09] to twittering twittering who well he
[1:21:17] wouldn't get down here honey fell I got
[1:21:19] nowhere tonight well with job once
[1:21:23] struck that revelation that it was not
[1:21:24] God he was only going through his trials
[1:21:29] to make him something
[1:21:31] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[1:21:34] doing it and the same thing today he'll
[1:21:39] try to tell you that these trials and
[1:21:42] things as your God trying to put
[1:21:45] punishment upon you it isn't so no sir I
[1:21:49] realize that this is a recorded message
[1:21:54] from 1963 November the 24th and as I'm
[1:22:00] reading it right here it's echoing out
[1:22:03] not by my voice but by the authority of
[1:22:07] the Holy Ghost to speak concerning the
[1:22:11] very things right now that could be
[1:22:13] present in our lives
[1:22:15] this word listen friends the Spirit of
[1:22:18] God upon this word is discernment that's
[1:22:22] the difference between the inspiration
[1:22:24] of man and the inspiration of God God's
[1:22:27] inspiration goes on but notice this this
[1:22:32] this is important it's not punishment
[1:22:37] why is that important because any of us
[1:22:41] in here when you or I have felt in any
[1:22:44] way we've let God down or maybe I didn't
[1:22:49] say that just right maybe the way I my
[1:22:51] demeanor was was not just right if this
[1:22:54] is something Lord forgive me I it kills
[1:22:57] you as a believer when you we have in
[1:23:00] some way fallen short it kills you if it
[1:23:06] doesn't you need help if they don't
[1:23:09] bother you you need help
[1:23:11] brother BAM tells us in a
[1:23:13] revelation series ran they don't bother
[1:23:15] me to do this brother REM says you have
[1:23:17] no more if you have no more conscience
[1:23:19] than a snake has hips it did have hips
[1:23:23] at one time but it sinned its hips away
[1:23:27] you with me
[1:23:29] so this conscience here it's a why it's
[1:23:32] a wonderful thing but yet even when we
[1:23:34] and ourselves know Lord to forgive me
[1:23:37] but to think about it what if you are I
[1:23:39] here we are setting intestine trials and
[1:23:42] the enemy now listen this guy can point
[1:23:46] out all your failures and all your
[1:23:47] mistakes he can point out all the
[1:23:50] reasons that you ought to be punished
[1:23:52] you ought to be punished because of this
[1:23:55] you remember how you thought this this
[1:23:57] guy in digging up stuff years and years
[1:24:00] ago he will do that sometimes but he'll
[1:24:04] try to dig certain things up and then
[1:24:06] try to cause you to believe that you're
[1:24:09] living under punishment we understand
[1:24:17] that tests and trials can come to
[1:24:21] correct it but let's look at what
[1:24:23] correction is correction yes it's
[1:24:28] punishment but it is discipline with a
[1:24:32] vision and the subject in whom is being
[1:24:36] corrected it's their amendment their
[1:24:39] interest in mind but not every test not
[1:24:45] every trial there's correction when we
[1:24:48] done wrong right we do we get corrected
[1:24:51] we need to be correcting when we done
[1:24:52] wrong right but when we get to looking
[1:24:56] at tests and trials God can permit
[1:24:58] sickness to come our way but a trial
[1:24:59] listen my brother's sister a trial
[1:25:02] itself is not God punishing you God can
[1:25:06] permit things to come our way to do what
[1:25:08] bring us back in line but a trial is the
[1:25:11] molding of our character so even Satan
[1:25:16] look how he's doing this why Satan knows
[1:25:18] if he can get this and get this about
[1:25:20] because he can't tell you what God don't
[1:25:22] love you see look look at that he can't
[1:25:24] tell you he's trying to
[1:25:25] come where he out on certain things like
[1:25:27] that he'll try to hit you the Binet
[1:25:28] Rebbe around and say well you know what
[1:25:31] it's because you're not been too good
[1:25:37] you know you failed and this and this
[1:25:40] and this and this why to get you
[1:25:44] thinking on that get you thinking on
[1:25:48] that you get you down why would it get
[1:25:50] us down as believers because our desire
[1:25:53] is to please him that's that's the
[1:25:57] ultimate of our life like David said
[1:26:00] Lord you can take anything else from me
[1:26:01] but don't take your Holy Spirit from me
[1:26:04] anything else Lord but don't take your
[1:26:07] presence from me Oh God
[1:26:23] brem says it like this I'll leave you on
[1:26:25] this and we'll pick it up
[1:26:29] he says it's Satan doing that and God
[1:26:36] permitting it you mean God God permits
[1:26:42] the trial absolutely God permits the
[1:26:44] trial and in the permission of the trial
[1:26:46] God permits Satan to run his mouth Satan
[1:26:53] told him he said you removed the hedge
[1:26:55] it's around joke
[1:26:57] God said okay but you can't touch his
[1:27:00] life he touch his flesh and you can't
[1:27:04] touch his life he came at him and he
[1:27:09] said you let me have him and I will make
[1:27:12] you curse you to your face
[1:27:20] he was encouraged to do so it came so
[1:27:24] close to where the enemy anointed is why
[1:27:29] anointed look at all this is happening
[1:27:32] to you and you're still faithful you
[1:27:35] still going on no world man it seems
[1:27:41] like since you started serving the Lord
[1:27:43] your whole life oh no you just looking
[1:27:47] out there you ain't seen the love affair
[1:27:49] in here but everything that she said why
[1:27:56] don't you just curse God and John died
[1:27:58] he said you speak like a foolish he
[1:28:02] didn't call her foolish
[1:28:03] he said you speak like will see the
[1:28:05] discernment the desert to separate in
[1:28:10] the midst of it well was this Satan
[1:28:13] notice who shall separate me here is the
[1:28:17] enemy coming in within the midst of that
[1:28:19] why don't you do this why don't you do
[1:28:22] that there's a lot of times there's
[1:28:23] influences that come over way and
[1:28:24] there's all sorts of suggestions and
[1:28:26] everything that comes against what God
[1:28:28] has revealed to us but God's permitting
[1:28:34] it to temper you
[1:28:42] to make you see if you're tied to this
[1:28:46] earth so this is to make me see it's to
[1:28:50] make you see God permits so the trying
[1:28:54] tribulation worketh patience but yet in
[1:28:56] the midst of it God can have you to turn
[1:28:59] back around and say hey yeah I know we
[1:29:01] don't walk through a rear view mirror I
[1:29:03] understand that but I also understand
[1:29:05] that God by his word would have Israel
[1:29:07] to look back remember and so God has to
[1:29:11] let you know sometimes remember who was
[1:29:14] that that kept you it was I who was that
[1:29:19] when you felt like giving up who kept
[1:29:21] you there was I but you see he won't
[1:29:24] answer and he wants you to say Lord that
[1:29:26] was you that was you Lord I would have
[1:29:30] turned loose at the end a long time ago
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:35] and so God says we've come through this
[1:29:40] way then if how bright I brought you
[1:29:43] this far
[1:29:52] no we don't understand everything
[1:29:54] sometimes there's things that it's when
[1:29:56] God that child try our test is permitted
[1:29:58] to come our way it's out of our hands
[1:30:00] but may our hearts our lives be in his
[1:30:04] aides say Lord whatever tool whatever
[1:30:08] tool you think I need a router I cut
[1:30:11] right here if you think I need the table
[1:30:13] saw whatever you think Lord I need a
[1:30:15] press if I just need something to press
[1:30:17] me to hold me in place right now do it
[1:30:21] it's like those clamps you know they use
[1:30:24] those clamps don't make a cut plants
[1:30:26] don't make a cut but clamps hold things
[1:30:28] so they can be cut to preach a little
[1:30:33] bit you know how sometimes the
[1:30:35] experience is out of your life and your
[1:30:37] testimonies might be the very clamps
[1:30:39] that somebody can look at it and say my
[1:30:42] goodness God's faithfulness and what
[1:30:45] does it do it causes them to stand there
[1:30:47] as well they see a testimony of Christ
[1:30:49] living through you and say Lord you made
[1:30:52] them you're able to make me Lord your
[1:30:56] grace has carried that safe this far
[1:30:58] it's carried me well Lord Jesus I'm
[1:31:01] praying to you what does he do
[1:31:04] clamps it right down you got to get it
[1:31:06] clamped pretty good in there I brother
[1:31:07] Joey if you're gonna get a clamp good
[1:31:09] and you're gonna try to start moving
[1:31:10] that on the sole that other piece buddy
[1:31:12] it's bad news your angle your cuts not
[1:31:16] going to be right it's not gonna fit
[1:31:18] right so sometimes there's tough to beat
[1:31:19] things coming down and God knows how to
[1:31:22] crack things down by his word he knows
[1:31:24] how to clamp it down with the witness
[1:31:26] and experiences within each individual's
[1:31:28] life
[1:31:34] hallelujah let's pray Lord Jesus how do
[1:31:40] we thank you tonight Lord for your word
[1:31:42] Lord Jesus thank you for speaking to our
[1:31:45] hearts Lord your God your counsel what
[1:31:49] not the counsel of man but how that you
[1:31:51] would bring your word and speak to us
[1:31:54] Lord calling us Lord to have
[1:31:55] understanding Lord in our lives lord
[1:31:58] sometimes the Lord understanding Lord
[1:32:01] God when things aren't understood Lord
[1:32:03] sometimes the Lord as individuals things
[1:32:05] can think what in the world is going on
[1:32:07] what's happening no wonder Lord that
[1:32:09] through the Scriptures when it speaks of
[1:32:10] tests and trials it would deal with our
[1:32:12] understanding of the thinking not
[1:32:14] strange
[1:32:16] count it all joy
[1:32:18] no wonder Lord God in these things Lord
[1:32:21] knowing as Paul would say that
[1:32:23] tribulation worketh patience this
[1:32:25] understanding Lord and father with this
[1:32:28] understanding Lord may we not complain
[1:32:31] on that about the tool Lord God if it's
[1:32:34] the router you're using the bandsaw that
[1:32:36] you're using Lord maybe the welding
[1:32:38] torch that you're using Lord the
[1:32:40] screwdriver the hammer Lord the clamp
[1:32:42] that's not what's going to be on display
[1:32:45] what's going to be on display is what
[1:32:48] come forth from the tools that were used
[1:32:53] or you're a faithful master builder we
[1:32:57] love you tonight Lord I pray that God
[1:33:00] that may your presence Lord move within
[1:33:03] every heart in every life Lord for every
[1:33:05] need tonight that is gathered here Lord
[1:33:07] under the sound of my voice and across
[1:33:09] that internet Lord God I pray that
[1:33:11] father God may your presence Lord meet

[1:33:15] that need that they have and desire in
[1:33:18] you Lord God father to know that Lord
[1:33:20] Jesus that you are mindful of every need

[1:33:26] mindful or
