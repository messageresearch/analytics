greatest achievement can be have for us to be able to step aside that God can just have his way the fall itself in Eden came because one put their s head of the word of God Satan came to draw to draw Eve out ground that wasn't Solid Ground death everything entered for one decision the Bible declares in the Book of Romans death in entered in all of this everything that we see even these bodies that we walk in now are the result of that decision thanks be to God there was another decision made before the devil ever became the devil there was already before there was atam Stardust or molecule for there was anything any Angels anything God already set forth the plan the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Isaiah 53 does not speak of future tense it speaks as a past tense declaration you know why when God has thought it it doesn't matter what Satan can try to do he cannot stop it he can't stop he came against Abel thought I had him when I got aen he came against Seth he came against Noah he came against AB on and on and on and on I thought I had him you know why it was that life that he could not snuff out let me just tell you something trial after trial test after test persecution after persecution he can't take away or destroy that life Hallelujah GL he can't do it because it's God not I that live it but Christ liveth in me oh we thank God for his Mercy this morning we want to remember as we go into prayer here in just a moment for the for the word of God and the furtherance of the service we want to remember musicians thank you um we dismiss the sister Irma Cruz they were here that she had she had to leave she had trouble with the chest Brother Carlos had to leave with us so we want keep her and keep them prayer that God will just just move for sister very special there's a lot of things can go through your mind a lot of things try to come and to take place times even when you seemingly know different symptoms and other things of whatever it is you know this is where we always want to take all of those things and say but what do you say we put it right there in god so let's just go to prayer as a as a body Heavenly Father dear God we're just so thankful that Lord your promises they are everyone yay amen Lord we are beneficiaries right now this morning oh god of the word that Lord was decreed from your mind and we are Lord fellowshiping with you Lord dear God every promise Lord Jesus is met is fulfilled and belongs to every believer Lord in you and we just pray right now for our sister oh God as you see the need that's arose in her body father I pray that God that your presence Lord we'll just move right there to relieve that tension oh God I pray May the peace of God just move Lord right now oh God lord to

hear from you Lord I pray that you will just help me help this congregation may we just Lord taking every one of our needs and putting it Lord into Lord into you and upon the Altar and I ask that God you'll come and speak to us and minister to every need Lord fill every empty heart God and refill every heart Lord move Among Us in a very special way we pray father for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you will turn with me to Genesis 22 going to go back they in the scriptures here Genesis 22 just moments here this morning verse we let you read a few verse of scripture then we'll let you have your seats verse one it says and it came to pass after these things that God did him Abraham that word temp means to try and the word that's used here is a word that means to aay which deals with when they go to look for uh samples of of minerals things that will would be in a land they take a great big drill bit but that drill bit going in also has the ability to take out what they call a core sample they can pull when they pull that bit out they can look at that core sample and though you can't see it on the surface sometimes these things are so so deep and but what you can't see on the surface the drilling down of the bit and pulling out reveal what's really down so the Bible says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham see God wasn't wondering is this really an Abraham God already knew this from before the foundation of the world but God always always brings his word always brings his word to p and we his word and he said to Abraham and he said behold here I am but don't you just want to stay available to hear God's voice Lord I I just want to be simple just to stay available to be able to say here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off so God told him go to the mountain that I tell thee of Remember When God speaks his word it's not just a letter but it becomes open a vision to you it's something that you can't explain you just know this is the this is the will of God just like when God opens his word to you you begin to take steps in that word what is that that's God opening and showing you and I he's telling us but he's opening to us that path sometimes there's things where you can see a vision before you maybe sometimes you would have a dream that God would speak to you concerning his word but when we look at this of the word it's just it's even in the the simpleness of where God would speak it's finished maybe it's healing in your body and it just that that scripture it just drops just like that say brother Samuel what is that that is the Lord appearing in his word and giving sight the Bible would say on and on with Abraham the Lord appeared to him that does not mean he came in a physical form in that particular verse the appearing is God coming in his word and speaking to Abraham God did show up to Abraham in in a flesh body God did show up to Abraham but there are times as God would speak to him and that word was so real to Abraham he journeyed Journey he kept walking amen we want to just speak this morning once again on F focus in into the program God may God bless you as you're being seated and we look into the word for a few moments Abraham in his journey uh certainly was a journey of faith faith itself is a very very marvelous thing it's a reality faith is a revelation sometimes we realize that there are things that have been called faith that uh it's really been more of hope there's things that for both of us or all of us that we have a measure we have human Faith human Faith itself is in the is in the intellectual realm and it it is a part that sometimes we can look at things uh in with human faith and feel so sure of about it but then situations can arise and we say I don't know about this I don't know did this really take place or did this really or did that but you see this is why it we we need more than just human Faith we're still going to have human Faith there's times where even at time for every one of us brother Brandon would say it like this in works as Faith expressed is that every one of us at times have tried to reach out for things of healing in our body and yet as brother Bradon would go on to tell us he would say now don't throw away that human Faith he said but just just let it become real Supernatural Well how can it become Supernatural faith I can't make it Supernatural Faith you can't make it Supernatural faith it takes God to come down behind our human Faith then it is not it is not our achievement then it is God's faith moving in our life that which you can't even explain how it is of the ground that you're standing on you you can't explain it but it's it's that which is so real to you that you are willing to stand there and say it's finished how do you know you don't even see it yet I don't know God dropped it and your rejoicing our worship is simply to know when that has come it's finished and we're no longer we're not just waiting until we see the physical appearing or manifestation we're already rejoicing in that right there that we cannot explain but we know that God has dropped it it's finished it's finished how can you explain that I can't and that's not my job am it's not my job oh my my my my Abraham was looking for the place that God showed him up he Abraham was so tuned into the word to where he begin to Journey he was looking for that place his here he was he was moving in a direction he was moving forward and then the Bible says when it come to that place remember there was mountains that was there Seven Peaks that was there and he says when he says I will show you when you come to those mountains I will show you I will hone in on that place where you to go where you to stand he said I'll show you Abraham walked you see this was not Genesis 22 was not something that you or I would have seen in this full expression in Genesis 11 when God called him out but this God knew lay here the whole time God allowed situations to arise that would that would actually Force what God had on the inside that would bring it out and allow it to be expressed and this is why even in test and trials that we go through this is why the the spirit would admonish us through Peter it says regarding the trial of your faith it's more precious than gold tried in the fire that after the trial might be found to the praise and glory of God I'm telling you a gold and every you know it's just like now you hear bits and pieces everybody saying oh let's get gold or let's get gold I'm glad that we already have received gold we've already received the true gold F gold out there will never do anybody any good James said it corrupts and becomes motheaten but this go is God's own life this go is a go that brother it is a reward that's released to you and I that says your fair your passage out of this life is already taken care of and in the meantime all that you have need of you have the gold the token within you to take every promise the Holy Spirit and say this belongs to me Abraham was looking for this characteristic of the word you see Abraham was looking to see God he wasn't this was not about what mountain that he wanted this was the one that God spoke to him in the word now and let me read in Romans 4 verse 13 it says for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed br through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect remember the promise came before there was ever a law Israel received the law they rejected Grace Exodus 19 Grace had provided for them what they had need of they turned it down and they received law law being something they could I don't want to depend on what I can do because let's just sum it up as the spirit of God spoke in Isaiah all our works that are our own made are filthy RS everything outside of his righteousness his life and so here the Bible goes on to say in verse 15 because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith you know let me just simply put this in this manner would you rather have the law here or have the law himself the life the nature living in you I would rather have his life because the life is the lawgiver himself and when that life is on the inside it's not you trying to keep a law it's God inside and his nature his word is being kept by himself Glory therefore verse 16 it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed it's unmar favor not to that only which is of the law but to that which also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many Nation before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in Hope right against hope against what the expectation was the expectation was your body is going to continue to go downhill your body is going the opposite direction of the promise that I've called for Hallelujah and Abraham who against that expected course he believed in expectation amen he was tuned in to a different expectation amen he knew he had an expected end hallelujah we're not wondering as children of God what will our end be we've got an expected end the word has already spoken Hallelujah God ha prophesied amen are you with me God has already prophesied he took his word that he spoke in this generation and God took that promise and he prophesied over our life there will be a Rapture Hallelujah I already saw you there that's a word that's been prophesied the Lord has spoken who can speak contrary not even your thoughts of wondering where your thoughts sometimes where you look at yourself can stop the word of God are you with me Brother Sam you're preaching that awful straight because it's God's [Music] word you see the bride will not be standing there on that day Lord didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't I remember the didn't I are the ones who'll say get out of here that's right I never knew you because the bride is made to rest on the promise of her husband he said I your provider I am your house band I am the protection you are safe in me Hallelujah every promise belongs to my household yeah oh my according notice oh I love that who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be God laid it all the way out spoke it all and it's going to come to pass and being not weak in faith that ain't talking about human Faith human Faith he's as weak as you and me right even in even if you've got real strong human faith is still weak and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb let me remind you not only was Sarah's womb dead but there was a time that there was still a stream of life going through AB ABR he fathered in Ishmael God finally had to let it die God let it dry up the Bible says his own body being now dead he did not have the ability to Father any more childrenall he was dead that is looks like God what are you doing the promise with the promise the promise but God said I made the promise and I will fulfill my promise Hallelujah God was letting an example be made known to you and I I'll take every bit of hope that you can see from around you that your expectation might be fully in me alone hallelujah hallelujah God glory be to God he consider not this word considered if means he did not even perceive into to try to understand if I can say it like this God's made a promise he didn't ask you to devise the details I don't care where this saying came from but I'm going to say it the devil's in the details are you with me the devil's in the details what do you mean by that brother Samuel I'm saying that when you go to try to figure it out you're off of your god-given ground and that gets you discouraged that will get you down because you are trying to look at how you can make it happen you're trying to look for a aray of hope that's natural within ourselves but down on the inside here when it comes into that place that's right there we're not trying we can try to say oh how will this be or how can we go this way and don't don't don't don't don't don't look any other way like oh I don't ever go that way we all go that way sometimes we all thought can cross your mind how do you know thoughts can cross your mind come on now right your your mind didn't get the Holy Ghost your body didn't get it but one day my body's going to be born again just like my soul wasall you're praying for healing and the question arises how is this going to be is it going to be a year from now I'll be this way or I'll be that way the devil's in the details what should I do cast it down God promised I don't know how it's going to be but I'm going to stand on that word because every time God brings his word to pass it blows up the mind of the people cuz it's not according to how you have it figured outen why would we do that as Believers we've learned we've learned been taught by him trust him him when he came in the days of his flesh he walked right among them they even wanted to take him many times and they crucified him because they had a way figured out and he didn't come according to how they think he ought to come he didn't come cloaked in their religious Garb but what he did come he came clothed in the vesture of his word he came according to the promise of his word and the Very one that they claimed to be looking for they rejected him they crucified him but here were some that were not renowned people they were not on the who's who list he passed by their way he had an appointment he let him know there's an invitation for you me like the woman at the world me me but what's he doing he knows what's beneath down in the depths of her life all it takes is to get in his presence one time one time all the holds and all the bondage all the darkness everything else it was just tearing loose because why you can't listen to me now closely you can't stop God from bringing his word to pass amen amen as many as received him to them he gave the power to become sons of God Amen become God becomes his word to every generation God becomes it's God becoming in you Hallelujah now now and his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith whose Faith God's faith God's faith this was not his own faith are you with me it's not your own faith oh brother Samuel I received the Lord Jesus Christ my that wasn't your own faith I believe the satification that wasn't your own faith oh I've received the Holy Ghost it wasn't you it was God receiving himself in you right amen it's all the work of God we are his workmanship it's us yielding to the plan and program of God Amen God already knows where you fit in this building I'm not talking about this building I'm talking about that spiritual building that spiritual house he already knows like Solomon Stones were hewed out from here from here from here from here and they brought them all together under what under an inspiration a vision given to David and God said the man of rest Solomon thy son will build this Temple Solomon took what David provided and he assembled those stones those different walks of life but they all came together and that's why Peter said we are Lively Stones not our life is his life not our glory is it's his glory Oh Glory was strong in faith giving glory to God being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousness B says it like this in the message look he says his faith talking of Abraham of a Believer his faith can only be based upon one thing that's the word he says now I feel like a shouting Baptist when you get to that word that's the living thing that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do make The Word Alive amen he makes the promise alive until that time the word is just laying there people AR can look at it oh my aose of God but when God comes in to make that Word Alive then the word itself is no longer a seed that's waiting to be raised to life but it already has that life in it and when he Broods over his word and brings his word to pass it has an effect upon the believer when they stood there on the day of Pentecost what was taking place it was God broing on the promise of Jo to and the brooding on that promise it brought forth lives vessels surrendered yielded that the god of that promise might pour himself by his word into their lives and they could say that which ye now see and hear is Joel too they had a word experience an exp expence identified in the word that declared itself Oh My My My when your mind and eyes can be single to that word and focus that in until you see exactly what God is doing what a wonderful thing Abraham saw it look at this Abraham saw it he did not look to any of the misunderstandings of the promise I love how brother Brown puts this here now watch he did not look to any of the misunderstandings of the promise there was a lot there was misunderstandings all around him there was misunderstandings all around him what look at this what if he would have looked and said here I'm 75 years old and such and such a voice spoke to me said I'm to have a baby by my wife she's 65 years old about 15 or 20 years past minut PA what would he have done if he would have looked at that what would he have done were those things all around they were were those things true they were right amen there's a lot of things about you and me that's true come on now we're not trying to change that it's to receive this change on the inside and rule over the other amen y because God will see fit that the other part that we are ruling reigning and bringing subject he said I'll change it just like I changed you just like I transformed your life what must I do oh God this feeling comes back this comes back some what must I do reain by my spirit Hallelujah bringing it subjection to the word amen and one of these moments you'll receive a body to match the work on the inside What would he have done I don't know maybe he' have joined a church group you know one of the subgroups we meet every Tuesday to talk about the wowy weed and the wowy Woos oh I'm so this and I'm so that anybody else ever had a problem yeah I've got problems anybody else I've got problems oh let's all join hands and cry we all got problems duh d every one of us I don't care how you look this morning you know it doesn't matter how you even look look at me like oh brother Samuel he's always on the mountain top he don't ever have problems don't you let the devil paint that picture it has to battle just the same as you do has to battle through mind battles thoughts other things else things that comes up in the body and everything else has to battle even in life but there is one thing that is certain that you every one of us can look at and God helps us and and strengthens us to be more inclined to depend on him what would he have done I ain't going to throw this cuz I don't want to pick it up baby what's the use there ain't nothing going my way my wife there's the promise look at the promise look at all this I got going on in my life my wife's passed menopause look at me look at me Abraham you're looking at the wrong thing if you look at negative come on now it ain't the negative don't come our way right but if you look at the negative what you focus on you will become that's true if you feed on negative things come on this is the Bible if you feed on negative things you become negative and there's everything you look in the world today it's negative you feed on it you become negative you don't recognize it but it starts carrying over in your spirit walk you start looking at the promise of God negatively not like what I don't believe it no you start looking at it in regards to your own life you're not feeding on the right Source you've got to feed on the source of Life you've got to talk to the one and feed on the one who has made you who you [Applause] are what are you doing I'm journeying to the mountain I'm on my way to the mountain glory be to God but what did he do he never paid any attention to what the Natural Things was he looked at what God Said did you catch that he looked at what God Said looked at it it becomes such a reality to him till he didn't see nothing else but what God Said amen what was he doing just like I said last week he was focusing in the the further as he was walking with God the peripheral of things that were out here it became peripheral he kept his eyes focused he kept looking this is an hour you remember what I just read to you a quote above this last week when the Church of the Living God begins to see the things taking place that are they bind themselves tighter with the word that's the only sure ground church I said that's the only sure ground he left his home he separated himself from all unbelief anything that would try to pull him away he separated himself so he could walk along God didn't separate him he separated himself right are you with me this is why when God would say in uh was the 1 Corinthians 6 separate yourselves it's things that God had given see the word the promise that God had given him brother when that word comes in it now remember our senses by eating on the strong meat our senses are exercised to discern good and evil I mean let's face it you know in the natural eating you might say oh I really want that oh I really want to do this you know the effect it's going to have on you some of us at least you know well how much more naturally how was Abraham able to separate God gave him strength how was it when all this arose with lot and now lot this this Strife arises you see it took the discernment of the word to move I'm not going to I I can't even begin to try to explain that only thing I know I know that by experience it had to be the word that gave him discernment gave him strength as far as naturally brother B tells us and you know this to be the truth in your own self he said that was hard for Abraham to separate from lot right he loved him right but God allowed that situation to arise and the word gave discernment and here the word itself acting showing the word gave discernment and Abraham's life he said whichever way you choose you go north I'm going to go south you go east you go what's he saying I can't be tangled up with conflict right you see the word is giving discernment conflict turmoil trouble vacation in your spirit it hinders God from speaking to you you want to be like Abraham over and over Abraham here I am here I am I'm right here I'm in a place that I can receive from God now you and I both know there we can't go live in a bubble and we don't walk in a Utopia right right we don't all around us is problems and troubles and everything else and sometimes when things seem like they're going so around and then all of a sudden something comes along right we don't live in a perfect Utopia we don't live in a in a we do not live in a place that oh this is a perfect place this is a perfect condition for me to be a son or daughter of God no God says I can put my children down in the midst of Babylon like Daniel I can put they can be placed there under a hot furnace they can be placed they don't need perfect conditions out here hallah oh Glory they don't need the perfect conditions out here they're not dependent on the light of the Sun by day nor the Moon by night nor the Stars they're not even dependent on the Candlestick but they have my Light Within them that's why David said in Psalms 27 the Lord is my li who shall I be afraid of he's my salvation amen and let's just be honest he saved us and he keeps on saving us yes amen amen come on now Paul said he delivered me from the mouth of the lion right Paul was not walking in the same Lion's Den that Daniel walked but it was the same anointing that had put Daniel there that came upon that came against Paul and Paul said God ha delivered me the same Angel of the Lord out of the mouth of the lion amen God made him a promise in the word when he would go to the Gentiles I will deliver thee from the people in whom thou are sent that's what every genuine believer has to do separate him separate yourself from these doubters and unbelievers and walk with Christ it's life to you what made Abraham make that decision the promise the promise gave him strength virtue to make hard decisions that human Faith would have struggled with human Faith Can reason Abraham did such a thing 25 years later we find him still believing the promise why he had focused his mind Mind through the will of God by the word of God and believe God God had appeared to him spoke to him in his word remember it was what God said he did not have a Bible oh come out of the land of er C no that's you and me reading right but you see without the same God speaking to us the same way he spoke to Abraham we can have the Bible but we read it just like a book this is why we need the god of the word to identify himself in the word and speak to us because the word is made to speak amen what God spoke to Abraham it was only unfolding in Abraham's life as Abraham walked God was taking the seals off of his life hallelujah oh my and he had focused his mind to the will of God the word of God God stepping in his word you see listen what God steps in his word to make known is what he's calling from the very character and life that's within you and me this is not something different like where I say oh you want this box of clean brother Aaron brother says wow yes and I go okay here you go said that ain't the same same thing you with me brother Dre that ain't the same thing God when God comes to make his promise known what he is doing he is calling to that Inside Man and let that Inside Man know this is who I've called you to be are you with me I'm not talking about Eagle stories it takes an eagle to fly over Eagle Stories won't do it it takes an eagle it takes a living God it took a living God in this generation it was not the banner of a church or an organization but it was the banner of the Lord and we can say His Banner Over Me his love his standard his inside Over Me Is Love if we can focus oursel to the plan of God to what God wants for us and what God promised us and let everything else alone no matter how long it is just keep believing tell you what we live in an impatient self I didn't say you noce I didn't say impatient world we already know that I want to smooze I got to be a work of 10 but I want to get up at 9:58 time stand still let me do all this and I got what do you mark me absent why did you mark me late don't you know all the traffic I had to go through don't you know it's not my fault the red light it's not my fault that the tire I need to fill it up it's not my fault it's an impatient World impatient you know what impatience Ares all those things I just said you know impatience Rises around self no reflection no accountability no standard you see when we look at this to become impatient you know if God answered every promise that we every every every uh request we made brother BR said it like this he said we would become even more impatient with life and what he says if he answered it the very moment we prayed if we answered the very moment we prayed we would become oh but Sam you don't understand I've really been born again but remember there's a part of you that's not been born again that's the part that still gets impatient right that's in the part that still wants to try to help God and God says I don't need your help no thank you look what your help has got me come on now people want to help God to serve him Lord I'll help you so I can serve you so God just lets it go on here's one ishmail another ishmail another ishmail another ishmail what is it child after the flesh are you with me he's a wild man he can never be pained right amen I don't care I know people got they got lions and tigers and all the sorts of stuff and they call them oh this is a pet in my house not me buddy and I don't care what you have I don't care what you'd have to eat that I might want to come I ain't coming to your house because I know those are wild animals I'm not dumb are you with me oh well you know you know you know the say oh he would her to flee are they they're just like a teddy bear you know how they are they're still alive wild animal right I don't care how tame that a person wants to try to project or be it still without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that nature changed they are a wild animal the only one that can ever tame it it takes the Living God to come on the inside and that Inside Man surrender and die amen then you got the strength of the Lamb to keep the beast in subjection right Hallelujah glory be to God Amen you've already got the peace of God right now reigning in your heart that's able to make this Beast lie down are you with me glory be to God you see it's already reality of where you're going you're already ruling and reigning now in this body why we are ruling and reigning by the lamb that has come to give us life amen prise no matter how long just keep believing Romans 4 he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief he didn't let unbelief contaminate him at all anybody been around you know somewhere maybe you go into a house or something I know Thanksgiving and everything's coming up too but sometimes you get around or maybe hotel room sometimes I've been in went in the hotel rooms and I go in the room nope you're going to have to give me another room well why somebody smoked in that room I think it's got cigarettes and not beds in there why well think about how that would look first of all I couldn't take it my sinuses and everything else breathing you understand me but how would that look brother Samuel's going to be coming here to speak for us brother Samuel walks up the aisle knocks everybody over with cigarette smoke that has contaminated the fibers of his clothing right are you with me all of them things can contaminate because you see there's certain things fibers that it can get into and contaminate right true this is why you've got to be sealed with the Holy Ghost where sealed into God and the world is sealed out amen listen to me that's not a pie in the sky that's something you've got to desire more than anything else let the word of God Focus you in to the will of God lord I want every poor soaked with pitch amen come on now God gave the vision to Noah to take down these trees and this is what you're going to build the ark out of and what did he say cut down this tree this tree I don't want you adding it to the other trees but I want you to take the life the pitch out of that tree and seal these other trees amen that's where God came down then there was no tree upon Earth who was fit to redeem another but God came down the tree of life came down I am the way the truth and the life he had the pitch within him he had the atonement within him you and I were the trees that God has harvested to the plan of God and the Holy Spirit the pitch the atonement of God has sealed us hallelujah into the body amen God this won't absorb it right the Holy Spirit can fall on this and'll leave the mind was not meant to absorb it the spirit was not meant to absorb it but that soul that soul that place that tree I'm when I'm talking about that tree I'm talking about that predestinated tree of God do you realize that when balam was moved he said I see him as trees of H right God Likens you and I in Psalms 1 to trees blessed is the man he shall be like a tree not that will be that has been planted God has already saw us past tense planted hallelujah amen planted where in the word amen planted in him plant gred in the promise of this hour and the quickening power comes what does it do it comes upon that piece that piece of wood that he has assembled he knew it where it was at within you he's assembling it to himself let me just say this without him coming without him speaking to you and I where life we would be searching for meaning but he is the meaning of Our Lives he's the meaning why you can never fit in anywhere else this is the mystery in your life and there's only one that can unfold uncover that mystery and that's him him alone he didn't let any unbelief contaminate him at all but the joy this is where Jesus said I walk in the world but I'm not the world Jesus Luke 15 the Bible says in Luke 15 I believe it is that the Sinners and publicans they all came to him there was something about him that they likeed there's something about you sometimes you may wonder and say why isn't this person why but what it is about you that they like is because it's God behind your skin are you with me it's a spiritual power it's a life that's behind there that they're drawn to something that's real it's a substance this is where Jesus speaks of the prodical son incredible how that none of the Sinners of publicans wanted to be around the righteous Pharisees you know why because as Jesus said you're full of dead men's bones and it was a trespass against the law un cleanliness to touch the dead help me preach you weren't allowed to come back into the camp if you touch the dead Jesus is letting them know you're filled with deadness right right amen but oh aren't you thankful that he looked beyond the deadness of our condition and he looked down on the inside he said there is a life there on the inside there's a life that I'm calling out oh it's it's been sealed away it's right there under that first Pur but I have come to call that one forth Lazarus come forth Hallelujah they didn't have to walk in the grave and bring him out Hallelujah somebody had to put Lazarus in the TB somebody had to put the stone over him amen yes God told Martha and Mary roll away the stone but nobody had to go get him that's right amen oh I've got to preach the word broke out in another dimension Hallelujah Glory he was The Lord Of Glory exercising Dominion as the second Adam he goes out there and Lazarus is here walking in Paradise Glory Hallelujah Lazarus is going Ezekiel Jeremiah God bless you oh my Heen it's good to see you all but guess what get ready cuz the one you've been waiting on he's on Earth right [Music] now he's on Earth right now about that time how the voice of God had went out here comes Lazarus right out from that place Hallelujah his spirit his life returns into that body his nose corruption had already set in right are you with me right you waited too long Jesus it's too late waited too long corruption's already set in but he was showing I am over corruption Hallelujah hallu I don't care how long the promisees it doesn't matter how old the promise is there is a literal Jesus hallah he's coming for his children amen amen I don't care how corrupt a life is yes when he speaks amen yes you don't need a church to prop them up amen come on somebody amen there is power in that voice amen no I do send forth by voice it is a mighty Voice hallah Hallelujah the voice of God is the word of God it is the person of Jesus Christ amen hallu hallelujah explain to me how themselves came back explain to me how his nose had sunken in explain how that came back [Music] you can't it was Supernatural right amen explain to me how you were born again right amen go and try and explain it to me oh it was this step or this step no that ain't explaining to me because the reality is you can't explain it amen if you can explain it there's somebody that can explain it away from you yes amen but when it's something that you say I just know I know what I was I know what I am I know that God is everything this word is my everything Hallelujah you can't explain it but it is solid ground he didn't let un believe contaminate him at all glory glory glory he had a seal about his life he could walk in the midst of the Furnace like the Hebrew children and when he came out of that furnace you could have been around him and said H what kind of soap you using it's pretty good soap that's nice soap I just came out of a fire really you don't smell like [Music] it I just came out of a trap really don't smell like it preach brother samen because the Bible says there wasn't One Hair of their head T they weren't burned brother their clothes didn't even smell a smoke that's the word that's the keeping power of the Seal of God Hall kind of a miracle their bands that they went in there with whether it was like this or it was like that it's still bound tremendous sister Mercy they come out of there these got burned off now brother Joey explain how that got burned off and how none of them hairs yeah Glory hallah explain to me how God sends a message in Satan's Eden and he seals away a people that their lives are victorious and he'll take in [Applause] Rapture Hallelujah didn't let unbelief contaminated am oh father of nation how long's it been now oh I'd say Abraham probably got to a point where he said I'm getting off of Facebook is that all right or maybe he said de friend de friend de friend de friend where is your y the Y of God Abraham he said the love of God does not put you above his word you're speaking against his word then you're above God and the love of God says love the Lord thy God with all preach brother Samuel sometimes we give too much junk place in our life whether it's junk from Friends junk from family junk from everything else it's where we have to be dialed in you see he was not going to let himself become contaminated right like you can going for a surgery or something or some kind of thing and then you all of a sudden you let this pop up and you go to start reading it does it build Faith well you know I'm just trying to find out what it is is opening a door for fear because you start me going in that direction listen if whatever the pathway that God chooses for your healing it's all a miracle from God go to one of these corpses put all the antibiotic put all the cream you want to put on them they got a cut put it on them that stuff don't heal life is the Healer medicine is an aid God ain't get against medicine and Hezekiah needed needed help God told that God go God told Isaiah Isaiah go get some figs tell him get some figs and put them on all right brother Brown would even say see he said God's not against medicine he spit in the ground he said from the elements of where medicine is made God spit on that and put it on the Man's eyes he said God is in medicine you see this is where it takes a prophet to come in this hour and balances it out where the devil say oh you don't got faith if you really have faith you wouldn't need medicine you'd say listen my faith says I need God I have God he has me whatever they AV it is a miracle Hall he looked to one thing and that was the voice that spoke to him that's what the church ought to do today look to the one thing the voice the word of God speaks churches and people they can they can speak anyway but look to the voice what are we looking at he looked to the voice look at that The Voice we stopped last week on that part there was a voice of that third Angel Babylon Babylon great sp there was the first Angel flying with a message coming to restore justification second Angel's message westling sanctification that third Angel's message is to announce the destruction and to call us out of Destruction into the place of safety do you realize there's no other place of safety outside of churches aren't safe religions not safe Rahab she stood there that day she heard we have heard what's your God that were oh my they were Representatives brother Aaron standing there they were representatives of what God was doing in that day and she asked him she said we've heard what your god did we've heard how he parted the Red Sea we heard how he consumed the Army we've heard how he parted the Jordan and everybody in this city is afraid but she asked them give me me true token not just a token I want a true I want that which is real and is genuine she received a true token that same voice the Bible tells us I read out of Revelations 18 last week that same voice this that that that angel strong angel on Earth proclaiming Babylon the greatest father what was it pointing out what was it pointing out out pointing out denominations and churches have fallen Fallen how did they become a a cage because they failed to receive the deity of Jesus Christ they could receive dogmas and doctrines and oh you believe this oh you're one of us this is what makes you one of us no no no we are Christians because it's Christ in US amen it's the same deity that was in Jesus Jesus Christ that comes back in you and me he said the works that I do shall you do also his Works was to do that of the Father which was revealed th has fallen what they they have put it out put out the deity the real Pentecost the real where God comes in Tabernacles and hearts oh sure he can have anointing and you know everybody dressed everywhere and looking every way and oh my oh wasn't that a wonderful service and oh this anointing and and every they get the music going and all oh wasn't that wonderful but has it changed you if it hasn't changed you something's missing it's got to be something that changes you it doesn't matter what is on the outside there's been a change in here you're founded on a solid rock that persecution winds and storms can come but you are solid am in Jesus Christ oh sure sure you feel like you're going to go a million pieces but there's one thing on the inside of you that holds you this is why the Bible says the love of God constrains us constrain means holds us together Hallelujah it holds us together we're United with him by the love of God the holy spirit this this is Angel proclaiming and heaven heaven echoed what was spoken on Earth it was it was being sounded at the same time are you with me so sounding and brother brah says it's that angel on Earth that third Angel was so inclined with god Till heaven was echoing that word these are the true sayings of godj come to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen the time is at hand it's time for departure amen stand with me would you please my God bless you this morning he looked to that voice that spoke to him he called Everything contrary to that voice as though it wasn't and yet materially it was as far out of focus with the world as Noah's time was it was just as far out of focus I want you to catch this for a moment I'm not going to have you stand along but if you had to sit down or something that's fine you won't I'm not but I want to just say this Abraham he could look in the mirror he could see maybe his Hunchback he knew what it was each morning to have to get out of bed say oh had maybe got to a place he had to think about step when the Bible says he called Everything contrary as though it were not he did not it was not Abraham saying oh I don't have an ache in my back honey what's wrong oh nothing nothing no say well how would Abraham do it how does Abraham SE do it now how can I overcome in the message how can I overcome brother Bram says the doctor says you got cancer he said and you say I don't got cancer brother Bram comes along and says no you've got cancer but but here's Abraham's seed the god in you is greater than the cancer oh I had a pain in my back oh maybe I need to take a muscle relax or I need to take a a pain pain feel or I need to take something you know to straighten that back out or are you doubting no God made a promise whether I see it now or I see it over there I'm walking into my healing it already belongs to me I'm in him Abraham how you feel this morning well Sarah I didn't sleep too good last night I'm tired my back's hurting or my legs hurting but you see listen to me now that was not the theme of the day are you with me no matter what Rose that was contrary that ache in his back or whatever that's a misunderstanding to the promise are you with me it's something that looks contrary I'm getting strong I'm getting weaker get but you see the faith of God listen this is where human Faith would fail human Faith would have succumbed to that but he not being weak in faith whose Faith was that you know how it is you you could be prayed for right here and and you and you you should have faith but think sometimes on maybe on a Monday morning oh oh that that ringing came back oh I don't know may maybe I was just in the thought yeah maybe you were just worked up yeah maybe this just what's he trying to do work on that human Faith to see if that's where if that's where it's at brother brother Samuel what should I do I just keep confessing it confess it he's the high priest of our profession confess means to say the same thing and do what confess it until you actually believe it confess it until God's faith steps down behind it you see this is why the new birth is not our faith it's God's faith you can't give up you can't quit you didn't start it this isn't your work it's an anchor this is why Paul called it an anchor an anchor that holds steadfast in the veil oh God so what do I do well if you get sick the doctor says this or whatever look Caleb and Joshua guys never came back you know brother Joy they never said don't listen to them tin spies these guys ain't nothing but Liars they want no Giants over there that's called hope face in reality is there's some Giants there but let me tell you I serve a god who's bigger yes Hallelujah he's bigger than every giant every son of an he's bigger that's how we handle as Sons and Daughters of God we're not walking around making oursel odd like well I ain't going to name it and claim it I don't want no box of rattlesnakes I who said you wanted a box of rattlesnakes by you saying brother Samuel pray for me my back is bothering me you haven't claimed that box of rattlesnakes that's you saying he's here trying to give me this but I'm applying the promise he's the Lord that he all all my diseases I'm one of his children and healing is the children's bread hallelujah how you walking [Music] Abraham how you feeling well today I'm not feeling on a mountain today matter of fact Sarah right now today I'm feeling a little gloomy but you know what God's done so much for us I know he's bringing us through am honey how are we going to see our way through this situation how we going to see our way through this problem honey I don't know I don't know the details of it Devil's in the details I don't know the details of it but God yeah honey do you remember one time in our life where our lives was at but God who is rich in Mercy but God stepped on the scene do you remember where the children of Israel was they were backed up against the ET se but God but God came he's the [Music] same so no matter what promise or what adversary no matter what raises its head Paul would write it like this and Paul would identify whether it's test trial all those things at the end of Romans 8 he never said what shall separate us he said who because it's the enemy trying to move in different Avenues but Paul recogniz who shall separate from the love of God that we have in Christ aren't you grateful for the love of God oh I just I thank God to know that it's him if I can say it this plainly the way that the prophet said it it's become more and more real to me it's God in you believing his own [Music] word oh brother saidel I receiv received the Holy Ghost no it was God in you receiving himself into his place [Music] it's God I say this morning it's just it's just that simple if you're willing to die if you don't have that if you don't have that ground you're willing to die that's what it has to take not God will not come and add on top of your will but he wants your will surrendered and when you're willing to surrender your will what does that mean brother Samuel to where you realize I don't want no more ishmaelites I'm not qu trying to Father an ishel trying to make this happen and trying to oh I'm going to try to do this and I'm they don't last so long the law is based on times at this time go do this at this time go offer this Thou shalt not do this it's based on times Seasons it's based on the natural positionings of lights and stars where the Moon is at Harvest it's based on Seasons that are God set forth as a sign that in him when the grace of God is coming you're no longer walking those by those lights out there you're walking by his light in the season of his word what a what a rest it is it's not me it's not you trying to I got to bring forth fruit no no no what I have to do drink drink push up drink drink push out drink drink push out Samuel sometimes it just seems like I can't I can't see fruit you got your eyes on the wrong spot keep your eyes on The Voice God will allow you in situations and as older veterans I talk to these are not situations that you and I would elect necessarily to come into but God allows fruit to be made manifest in The Valleys in times of test and times of trouble and God lets it be proven whose faith is really there faith brother Aaron like they could ask brother brand brother Shan they would ask him in the car pull up next hey Billy has your religion holding you now he says I'm not holding on he's holding [Music] me glory be to God there's been times like that there will be times like that matter of fact the more that we become aware that it's him so every time when we start to try and do thing we getting away we get we getting away God has to allow that part about us just kind of die away you know God has to allow it to get to a spot in our life to [Music] where the womb on the inside the Sarah on the inside says put ishmail out are you with me put him out what do you mean put him out don't look at him because he's not part of the [Music] promise but but but this was your idea correction this was sar's idea not Sarah's this was s i I can do this I can do that that was SAR eyes doing but since he came Sarah Hallelujah the Breath of God push put ishell out so in the meantime you could tell your ishel you're going to church you're going to raise your hands because Isaac needs to borrow your hands right now but eventually God's going to give me an Isaac that matches the Isaac on the inside hallelujah amen a body fashion like his own glorious body you love him this morning Heavenly Father Lord behind the hearts of your children Lord perhaps there's a heart a life that's here or streaming that that's a longing it's they it's raised up in their life life there's a yearning Lord God from what they have craved or desired but never knew how to put it in words sought it in different Avenues but that thirst could never be quenched there's only one that can quench that thirst World material things of the world are never satisfied you're the only one that's how you placed it I pray God this morning that as that Lord would become more real in their life and before them Lord Jesus that's you in your word making your word your promise real it's the same life of the Messiah it's the same Lord Jesus right here Among Us the same God appearing in his word drawing upon that heart or a life a word in itself cannot do that but it's you Lord I
