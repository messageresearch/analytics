[46:52] well and you know to think of that
[46:55] during that time you know just how long
[46:59] that they've been together as a husband
[47:01] and wife tremendous timing those of you
[47:05] that's lost a spouse you also can be
[47:07] able to enter in into that as well so we
[47:11] just want to turn our attention with the
[47:13] word of the Lord here this morning and
[47:16] just see what the Lord will have for us
[47:22] are you hungry
[47:25] it's just such a such an honor and a
[47:28] privilege that we can come together and
[47:30] to worship their true and living God one
[47:33] of these days these things will be
[47:35] nothing but just a fond memory to be a
[47:39] fond memory and we want to take every
[47:42] every opportunity we have a man and draw
[47:46] closer to the Lord amen let's just stand
[47:50] if we could we want to go right into the
[47:52] word Luke chapter 22 I'd like to start
[47:57] there in verse 13 and we'll just see
[48:01] where we get to here this morning
[48:10] verse 13 of Luke 22
[48:19] the Bible says and they went and found
[48:22] as he had said unto them and they made
[48:26] ready the Passover and when the hour was
[48:29] come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles
[48:33] with him and he said unto them with
[48:36] desire I have desired to eat this
[48:40] Passover with you before I suffer this
[48:45] was not going to be a Passover like any
[48:48] other Passover this was a time where
[48:53] fulfillment was present this had been
[48:57] God's longing and desire where his word
[49:02] it's coming to pass for I say unto you I
[49:06] will not eat I will not anymore eat
[49:10] their own until it be fulfilled in the
[49:13] kingdom of God and he took the cup and
[49:16] gave thanks and said take this and
[49:19] divide it among yourself well I say unto
[49:23] you I will not drink of the fruit of the
[49:26] vine until the kingdom of God shall come
[49:29] and he took bread and gave thanks and
[49:32] brake it and gave unto them saying this
[49:35] is my body which is given for you this
[49:38] do in remembrance of me likewise also
[49:42] the cup after supper saying this cup is
[49:45] the New Testament in my blood which is
[49:48] shed for you amen may God bless you this
[49:52] morning bless the reading of his word
[49:54] have you seen I'd like to continue to
[50:00] look at this thought on the issuing in
[50:04] of the New Testament that I would like
[50:07] to deal with it may be a sub thought the
[50:10] love of God when we think of Testament
[50:16] itself we know that a Testament ISM it's
[50:20] an arrangement it's a disposition it's a
[50:24] will that one desires to be put into
[50:29] effect and yet just like a will that any
[50:33] of us would have or you would make or
[50:35] any person the only way that the will
[50:38] itself can actually come into effect is
[50:42] for the one who has given that of the
[50:47] will or we would say the testator of
[50:50] that will for that one to die and when
[50:54] he would die then the very force of that
[50:56] Testament can come into effect when we
[51:01] look at this and we think of the New
[51:03] Testament no doubt I would say that
[51:05] there's many that just look at the New
[51:08] Testament as a book and as a collection
[51:12] of writings there's many times that all
[51:14] around us that you find situations where
[51:18] many carry around the Bible but they've
[51:20] never they've never read in the Old
[51:22] Testament they've never even for many
[51:24] that's never even heard preaching from
[51:27] the Old Testament I never forget some
[51:29] years ago and there was a group of
[51:31] Pentecostal ministers that came here
[51:34] during a service and different ones they
[51:36] were so struck by the ministering of
[51:39] from the old and into the new and how
[51:41] all of these types and these things were
[51:43] moving out through their means so much
[51:45] to where they they wanted to know can
[51:47] you train us in these things I wanted to
[51:50] arrange a special meeting and I you know
[51:53] it began to let them know it's not
[51:54] something that my and myself can train
[51:56] you it's it's God is sovereign ly giving
[51:59] it by divine revelation and you know
[52:02] that's a great privilege to be able to
[52:04] not just have the Bible but to be able
[52:07] to read it and see and recognize that it
[52:10] is God's God's desire and the great
[52:13] redemptive plan that's unfolded to you
[52:15] and I and it's inspired to our it's not
[52:17] just something that is back there or
[52:20] something that is to come but we see God
[52:23] presently for who he is and working in
[52:26] his word and not just him but we see and
[52:29] recognize ourself in the word that's a
[52:32] glorious glorious privilege so this test
[52:36] this Testament it's more than just a
[52:38] it's not just a mere collection of
[52:40] writings but the New Testament itself is
[52:44] that of the book of the Bible that we
[52:46] ruin we refer to the New Testament it's
[52:49] and it's the actual giving forth of
[52:52] God's own life we'd find were you know
[52:55] the the the disciples and how that
[52:57] Matthew Mark and Luke and John and how
[52:59] that they would write there of the of
[53:02] that of the the life of Christ that was
[53:04] made manifest there up on the earth and
[53:06] they would express many of these things
[53:08] and we know that it's also
[53:10] representative of the guards and how
[53:12] that all of those would be wrote within
[53:15] there and there are ways of the approach
[53:17] of how that man can actually come into a
[53:20] place to approach God and yet then you
[53:22] find how God will move up on Paul and
[53:24] and different others and they'll begin
[53:26] to write by divine inspiration but
[53:28] everything that they're writing when
[53:30] they write to the other churches of
[53:32] Corinth and Thessalonica angulation all
[53:35] the rest of their their writing of the
[53:37] working of God's own life moving in his
[53:41] own body that he has purchased and
[53:43] redeemed for himself and and that's the
[53:45] whole plan of redemption is God's desire
[53:48] is to bring back to himself his children
[53:52] and and to move from just living here
[53:55] within this life to a complete
[53:57] reconciliation to where our lives are
[54:00] changed and where that this earth itself
[54:02] receives her final stage and even to
[54:06] where that we move beyond them the
[54:08] Millennium and walking out on the ashes
[54:10] of the wicked to where it comes into
[54:12] that time of the future home God's
[54:13] desire is for complete and full
[54:16] reconciliation and we find that within
[54:20] this that you know when God issued in
[54:22] the issuing in of this new testament we
[54:25] look sometimes at the word new and and
[54:27] new itself when we look at it we realize
[54:31] that it's not something that is new as
[54:33] far as new in what's been expressed but
[54:36] we realized that God himself already
[54:39] expressed this coming even when he had
[54:42] spoke to Abraham and he confirmed this
[54:45] to Abraham even confirmed it by an oath
[54:47] to Abraham and when we look at that how
[54:50] that within it there is nothing then
[54:52] that could dissing all this a covenant
[54:54] this covenant this Testament was before
[54:57] the law ever came into existence and
[55:00] there was nothing that the law could do
[55:02] nothing that could dissin all it at all
[55:04] and you know we can begin to look at it
[55:06] I think about it that when we look at
[55:09] the New Testament itself in order to
[55:11] really find the origins of the New
[55:13] Testament we've we've got to go back
[55:15] deeper we've got to go back more than
[55:17] just when we look at Abraham because we
[55:19] realized that that is one of the first
[55:21] times that God would would utter within
[55:24] things concerning that and really begin
[55:26] to unfold it but we find ourselves where
[55:29] we would have to actually go back to the
[55:31] eternal one himself to go back into -
[55:34] God Himself when God Himself would just
[55:37] dwell alone when he was there and God
[55:40] would begin to think about himself and
[55:42] think about his attributes and think
[55:44] about himself becoming tangible and how
[55:47] that through the whole redemptive plan
[55:49] where the lamb was slain in the mind of
[55:52] God or all of it was already laid out
[55:54] within God it was already there
[55:56] determined within him and yet God
[55:59] himself had all of these attributes that
[56:01] would it would that he desired to
[56:03] display and we see that within it that
[56:06] God the whole working would be where God
[56:09] would bring back to himself his children
[56:11] through him by the process of redemption
[56:13] that he might be able to have fellowship
[56:16] with man he might be able to have
[56:18] communion and he might dwell in man and
[56:20] warship with them God's desire with all
[56:25] of it this this great Testament we find
[56:28] that when we look at it here I think of
[56:30] how that you think of the great eternal
[56:32] one and how that here God Himself that
[56:35] Great Spirit there was no visible form
[56:38] at all but how that God Himself began to
[56:41] form himself to where that the Bible
[56:44] tells us in John 1 in the beginning was
[56:46] the word and the Word was with him in
[56:48] the Word was God and we find that how
[56:51] that in the midst of that time that he
[56:53] gave birth to the Son of God not the
[56:55] body but that visible light it was not
[56:57] one who went out of him that was
[56:59] different from him but it was the very
[57:02] God himself that beginning to form
[57:05] himself in a visible form it was that
[57:08] white light that
[57:09] pillar of fire but God himself would
[57:12] begin to veil himself behind it was
[57:14] called himself already showing and
[57:17] condescending of how that he himself was
[57:20] going to take a people unto himself yet
[57:22] in the midst of this time there's still
[57:25] no Adam dust or molecule nothing but
[57:30] it's God and how that God himself out of
[57:34] God here begins to step forth and we
[57:37] find that the Almighty God as he comes
[57:40] brother Ram said it like this in
[57:41] preparation he said let's take a little
[57:44] mental trip tonight you and I let's go
[57:46] back before there was a star in the
[57:48] heaven for there wasn't anything setting
[57:50] way back in eternity that was God and
[57:52] then going out of God or God unfolding
[57:55] himself come below God which was the son
[57:58] of God or the word of God in the
[58:00] beginning was the word and the word was
[58:02] with god and the word war and the word
[58:05] was made flesh and dwelt among us the
[58:08] logos so it's God unfolding himself so
[58:13] here
[58:13] the Great Spirit where it cannot be seen
[58:16] at at all but now it takes upon that
[58:19] visible form so much to wear that
[58:21] remember in the scriptures it would
[58:23] describe it and say in Colossians 1 who
[58:26] is in the image who is the image of the
[58:29] invisible God it's that same one he by
[58:32] his son that he created the world's
[58:35] created the earth the Bible says in the
[58:37] book of Ephesians chapter 3 that he
[58:40] created all things by Jesus Christ he
[58:43] created all things by His Word and to
[58:46] see how that God is stepping forth
[58:48] within this time of how that God would
[58:51] begin to unfold himself to wear how that
[58:54] God there is a little there's an
[58:56] attribute that's here and we find that
[58:58] God begins to express his word and we
[59:01] see the Sun we see that coming into
[59:03] existence and then we find that little
[59:05] clinker that begins to come off of that
[59:07] Sun and how that even within that there
[59:10] is a reserved place for that clinker to
[59:13] come to a rest that we would know as the
[59:15] earth it did not determine its position
[59:17] on its own called already determined its
[59:21] in the whole layout and as a matter of
[59:23] fact here it was being moved upon and
[59:25] the word itself was putting that earth
[59:28] or that chunk of ice like we would know
[59:30] it it was putting it right in its
[59:32] position but to think how that in the
[59:34] midst of that time that the earth itself
[59:36] out of all the other planets all the
[59:39] other stars it was one that God had
[59:41] already recruited in that very
[59:43] redemptive plan to where that he himself
[59:45] would come down and he would dwell and
[59:48] that this very planet itself would
[59:50] become habit of where it was a place to
[59:52] where God would choose to display his
[59:55] attributes in a tangible manner and the
[59:58] earth itself I love this quote out of
[1:00:00] power transformation brother man tells
[1:00:02] us he said when that earth itself to
[1:00:04] think how God will transform by his word
[1:00:07] he said that earth how it was moving out
[1:00:09] there but it obeyed the Word of God and
[1:00:12] it came in and began to move around that
[1:00:14] Sun you see what the word did when the
[1:00:17] word went forth and the earth being a
[1:00:19] redeemable attribute it responded to the
[1:00:22] word and the word bought it in and
[1:00:24] around the Sun so that where that the
[1:00:27] Sun itself was the center there and to
[1:00:29] where that that life could actually
[1:00:31] begin to touch and move upon that earth
[1:00:34] oh my how that God said it right there
[1:00:37] with that earth and how that God would
[1:00:39] come down and in the midst of etter
[1:00:41] there was a choice place called the
[1:00:43] Garden of Eden out of all the earth God
[1:00:46] loved all of the earth but out of the
[1:00:48] midst of it there was a choice place
[1:00:51] called the Garden of Eden and in this
[1:00:54] Garden of Eden God would choose to set
[1:00:59] up his headquarters he would choose
[1:01:01] within this to set forth his son and his
[1:01:05] son's wife you look at it when you think
[1:01:08] of how that in that creation all here
[1:01:11] the creation begins to move along bear
[1:01:14] in the book of Genesis but then how God
[1:01:16] steps forth there in Genesis 1:26 let us
[1:01:20] make man in our own image let us make
[1:01:24] man in our own not images remember that
[1:01:28] Great Spirit has been one image one
[1:01:30] likeness here the invisible God now
[1:01:32] taking for
[1:01:34] in his word that low loss of God that
[1:01:38] that's the often II of God the word of
[1:01:41] God or my let us make man in our own
[1:01:46] image in our own likeness what you see
[1:01:51] that the word was never ever meant just
[1:01:55] to remain just as something way out here
[1:01:58] that's not visible but call it intense
[1:02:01] for his word to be made visible in our
[1:02:04] lives God wants his word to be tangible
[1:02:08] and you look at how that within
[1:02:11] everything that had taken place to think
[1:02:14] of how that God himself coming down to
[1:02:17] to dwell among his children how that God
[1:02:20] would come down there and even within
[1:02:22] when we look at Adam and we see that
[1:02:24] Adam himself how he he begins to come
[1:02:27] forth here upon the earth and God moves
[1:02:30] and God sets forth from that there and
[1:02:32] that that image God puts that spirit man
[1:02:34] into a physical he forms that body
[1:02:38] around it and how that God would set him
[1:02:40] forth and Adam Woods would stand there
[1:02:42] and he would name the animals and we
[1:02:44] know that how they were brought forth
[1:02:46] Adam was such in tune with God's mind he
[1:02:50] was speaking remember he was identified
[1:02:52] with the characteristics by the mind of
[1:02:55] God he was so in tune with it to what he
[1:02:58] was calling it that's exactly what God
[1:03:00] Himself had already and would call it it
[1:03:04] was perfect but yet before within Adam
[1:03:08] there was a long it was a longing in
[1:03:12] Adam no there was nothing of this animal
[1:03:15] life that could satisfy it nothing so
[1:03:19] god oh my to see God in His great mercy
[1:03:23] how that God moves by I don't believe
[1:03:27] that he forced at him I don't believe
[1:03:30] that he took him by the hand and and
[1:03:31] forced him but I believe he was led to a
[1:03:34] deep sleep the Bible says that the Lord
[1:03:36] caused a deep sleep to fall upon him it
[1:03:39] was it was not something of force but it
[1:03:41] was submission and out of Adam here
[1:03:44] comes one where God would take
[1:03:47] that rib part of what that substance
[1:03:50] that he created and God would go in
[1:03:52] through that spirit there and God would
[1:03:55] begin to actually be able to separate
[1:03:57] the masculine from the feminist and be
[1:04:00] able to put that into this body and then
[1:04:02] when he would wake him up he would bring
[1:04:04] this bride Adams bride unto him that he
[1:04:08] could be presented unto his son
[1:04:11] we find that when then the fall itself
[1:04:13] when all of this had taken place he want
[1:04:16] it what a time it was you know how that
[1:04:19] God got it dwell with his creation water
[1:04:22] what a lovely time it was you know they
[1:04:24] had perfect understanding of the love of
[1:04:26] God right there in the garden there was
[1:04:28] no malice
[1:04:29] there was no hatred they never they
[1:04:33] never had to deal with ill feelings they
[1:04:37] never had to deal with sickness they
[1:04:39] never had to do that they were perfect
[1:04:43] it was under God's perfection God's
[1:04:47] creation and right there they were
[1:04:49] dwelling in the love of Almighty God God
[1:04:53] had given them his word that they could
[1:04:55] live by that word but you know we find
[1:04:58] that when man himself and when the phone
[1:05:01] had taken place to where that here man
[1:05:04] he left himself there was absolutely no
[1:05:07] way back for man no way there was no way
[1:05:13] man could get back when Adam walked out
[1:05:17] here Eve she was deceived within and in
[1:05:19] how that Adam walked out playing acting
[1:05:22] out a type of Christ but yet Adam left
[1:05:26] his self no way back within that friends
[1:05:31] when we look at that don't ever let that
[1:05:34] get old that is the heart of it all
[1:05:37] because even after we have been redeemed
[1:05:41] it is still him by his Spirit fulfilling
[1:05:46] his word not by power not by mine but by
[1:05:51] my spirit saith the Lord there's no
[1:05:53] church there's no man that can fulfill
[1:05:55] the word it takes the Spirit of the
[1:05:58] Living
[1:05:59] that'll come through yielded vessels
[1:06:02] that he doesn't matter how much a person
[1:06:04] knows it doesn't matter how steady they
[1:06:06] are they still can't do nothing without
[1:06:09] the Holy Ghost coming down and the
[1:06:11] Spirit of God performing his word God
[1:06:16] was laying this down this foundation of
[1:06:18] where all of this would be laid and you
[1:06:20] know to think that he himself the very
[1:06:23] Almighty God becoming one of us you know
[1:06:26] Abraham met him
[1:06:29] Abraham met him here after the fall had
[1:06:32] taken place and he spoke with Abraham
[1:06:35] and he talked with Abraham and I want to
[1:06:37] just read just a verse of scripture to
[1:06:39] you here that out of the book of Timothy
[1:06:41] were Paul would mention this and a
[1:06:44] portion aware brother branham would tell
[1:06:46] us and who is this Melchizedek he
[1:06:47] doesn't read it but he says when you get
[1:06:49] time I want you to go back and read
[1:06:51] these verses scripture in first reverse
[1:06:54] Timothy chapter 6 verse 13 he said I
[1:06:58] charge thee in the sight of God who
[1:07:00] quickeneth all things and before Christ
[1:07:02] Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[1:07:05] witnessed a good confession that thou
[1:07:07] keep this commandment without spawn
[1:07:09] unrebuked
[1:07:11] unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ which in his times he shall show
[1:07:16] who is the blessed and only potentate
[1:07:19] the king of kings and Lord of lords who
[1:07:22] only hath immortality dwelling in the
[1:07:26] light which no man can approach unto
[1:07:28] whom no man hath seen nor can see to
[1:07:33] whom the honor and power everlasting a
[1:07:36] man who we read about Almighty God Amen
[1:07:41] we're reading about Christ dwelling in
[1:07:44] the light where until no man can
[1:07:46] approach and no man has seen him man has
[1:07:51] seen forms but man has never seen him is
[1:07:54] that right but how that when we we get
[1:07:58] to look at it how that God would unfold
[1:08:01] himself to become one of us God would
[1:08:05] unfold himself down you know the Prophet
[1:08:07] takes it like this in the message
[1:08:09] unveiling of God and you know I
[1:08:11] appreciate the times how we
[1:08:13] can look at this and it be so simple
[1:08:15] that we can hopefully by the grace of
[1:08:17] God being able to see it that he puts it
[1:08:20] like this he says it's like a great
[1:08:22] drummer and he goes on that says you
[1:08:25] know one person played referring to a
[1:08:28] play that he had saw one person played
[1:08:30] three or four parts and in order to do
[1:08:32] that he changed his maths sometimes he
[1:08:35] come out he's this character the next
[1:08:38] time he comes out he's another character
[1:08:40] but it is the same person all the time
[1:08:43] no doubt many of probably everybody in
[1:08:46] here at some point in time has actually
[1:08:49] witnessed a play sometimes in the plays
[1:08:53] themselves are you knowing that one
[1:08:55] person there might be multiple people
[1:08:57] now when we look at it you'll find how
[1:09:00] that person can come out and you know if
[1:09:01] you can set they're in a play and you
[1:09:03] can begin to look at it and say I think
[1:09:05] that's I think that's the same
[1:09:07] individual I think that and you start
[1:09:09] getting carried with that and forget
[1:09:11] about the play but you see it's an
[1:09:15] instance sometimes it's not just about
[1:09:17] not having enough cast it's that that
[1:09:19] person itself they're able to act out
[1:09:21] those different parts and that's chosen
[1:09:24] and selected and what a type that is of
[1:09:26] God it was God himself that was acting
[1:09:30] out each one of these parts it was God
[1:09:33] himself that was moving through Abraham
[1:09:36] God Himself that was moving through
[1:09:38] Isaac God through Jacob God through
[1:09:40] Joseph it was the same God that was
[1:09:43] moving through the prophets of all it
[1:09:45] was that same God who touched the
[1:09:47] believers of all who are ordained to
[1:09:49] that work it was the same Almighty God
[1:09:52] that was acting out each part of the
[1:09:55] drama
[1:09:56] remember when he walked on the road to
[1:09:58] Emmaus they didn't know who he was their
[1:10:04] eyes were holding that they wouldn't
[1:10:08] know him he wanted them to see him as
[1:10:13] the fulfillment of the word see that's
[1:10:18] the the real way of seeing the Lord
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ is to see him by way of his
[1:10:24] word
[1:10:25] and we're aware that he would take and
[1:10:27] come by his word and where he himself
[1:10:30] the Living God would come right down and
[1:10:32] begin to make himself known that he's
[1:10:34] the same God he's the same God that was
[1:10:37] back there as the same God that's here
[1:10:39] this morning that same God coming to
[1:10:42] confirm his word to our hearts a great
[1:10:45] drama that he's acting out oh my to
[1:10:49] think of this how that if brother n
[1:10:51] tells us it's the same person all the
[1:10:53] time and he says that's God he changed
[1:10:57] himself from a pillar of fire to become
[1:11:00] a man been changed yourself from that
[1:11:04] back in the spirit again that he might
[1:11:06] dwell in man God acting in a man what he
[1:11:10] really was Jesus was not no second
[1:11:14] person of the Godhead you know sometimes
[1:11:23] you ask I ask him to vigil I said what
[1:11:24] who are you redeemed by who redeemed you
[1:11:27] and they said what do you mean
[1:11:28] redemption I said who were you redeemed
[1:11:30] by you trying to sell me if you're
[1:11:32] trying to sell me three gods but I'm
[1:11:34] asking you who which one of them
[1:11:36] redeemed me
[1:11:37] and what does redemption mean is
[1:11:40] redemption just there on the cross or is
[1:11:42] redemption there of a work that moves
[1:11:45] into the innermost part of an individual
[1:11:47] that changes their nature and will
[1:11:50] eventually change their bodies if Jesus
[1:11:55] is the second person of the Godhead
[1:11:56] you're still in your sins there is no
[1:12:00] hope but it's the very God the God
[1:12:05] himself coming down and condescending to
[1:12:09] form himself moving from the pillar fire
[1:12:12] to become man then he changed himself
[1:12:16] just stay with me a moment then he
[1:12:18] changed itself from that back in the
[1:12:20] spirit again that he might dwell in man
[1:12:23] God acting in a man what he really was
[1:12:27] Jesus Christ was God acting in a man in
[1:12:31] a man in a man that's what he was he
[1:12:34] changed from the pillar of fire then he
[1:12:37] had come in which was a veil
[1:12:38] in the wilderness that God hid from
[1:12:40] Israel watch this now Moses seen the
[1:12:43] shape of his body but really he was hit
[1:12:46] all the time behind this pillar fire
[1:12:49] which was the logos that went from God
[1:12:52] God was dwelling there in that pillar of
[1:12:56] fire in man it was a visible form but
[1:13:00] yet no man had seen God is that right no
[1:13:05] man had seen God and here God is
[1:13:07] dwelling in that pillar fire but now
[1:13:09] from that pillar fire remember when
[1:13:11] Moses said asked to see his glory what
[1:13:14] did he saw he saw the Honda parts of a
[1:13:17] man remember when Moses said remember
[1:13:19] what Moses said Lord let me see your
[1:13:21] face he said I can't it's not face time
[1:13:23] yet you cannot see my face yet is that
[1:13:27] right yet the mystery is he spoke to
[1:13:30] Moses as a man face to face though what
[1:13:36] is face his presence his presence what
[1:13:39] Moses had asked to see he let him see
[1:13:42] the hind reports of a man that this
[1:13:45] would be the fulfillment that the
[1:13:47] presence of the Lord would fulfill this
[1:13:50] but zeal of the Lord would fulfill this
[1:13:53] and he would bring forth a body a temple
[1:13:56] that he himself would change from the
[1:13:59] pillar of fire to dwell in man but yet
[1:14:03] Moses could speak to him face to face
[1:14:08] presence of the Lord and that wonderful
[1:14:11] you know you've been given that same
[1:14:14] privilege to be able to speak to him
[1:14:17] face to face no matter where you're at
[1:14:20] you might be in your timing on your
[1:14:22] ironing board you might be right there
[1:14:24] in the factory you're given that
[1:14:25] privilege because let me tell you he
[1:14:27] said lo I am with thee always amen the
[1:14:32] word itself a Ministry of the Spirit has
[1:14:35] brought you into this place to where you
[1:14:37] have an access whereby that many could
[1:14:41] only go once a year but you live there
[1:14:44] that is your place where youth well it
[1:14:46] has been made for you and accessible
[1:14:49] that we can live there in his presence
[1:14:52] and talk with him and he with us what a
[1:14:57] privilege oh my the Prophet says here he
[1:15:04] goes on to say how that in them in the
[1:15:07] midst of it when we're looking at how
[1:15:09] man he left himself no way back think
[1:15:14] about when that fall had come play I've
[1:15:16] taken place there in the garden how that
[1:15:18] God stepped down and God the very love
[1:15:22] of God move down the very heart of God
[1:15:25] and said I'll make a way back for you I
[1:15:29] will give her a seed look friends they
[1:15:33] were walking out with no hope they had
[1:15:36] lambs skins on them that's true they had
[1:15:38] lambs blood but who came from that not
[1:15:40] there
[1:15:41] he gave them that they couldn't stand in
[1:15:45] his presence and where at one time they
[1:15:47] had stood in his presence but God's
[1:15:49] desire for fellowship was so expressed
[1:15:52] that he took the clothes the skins of an
[1:15:56] innocent one and slayed an innocent one
[1:15:58] and through the skins in and says come
[1:16:00] out come out and when they would walk
[1:16:05] from there the very presence of God how
[1:16:08] the Prophet would describe it that white
[1:16:10] light began to come down that great
[1:16:12] pillar of fire and it began to write out
[1:16:15] l.o.v.e the very expression of his word
[1:16:20] where I will give you a seed was the
[1:16:24] very love of God we know that there's no
[1:16:27] way that the woman herself does not
[1:16:29] possess the seed but yet God Himself
[1:16:32] said I will give you a seed look how God
[1:16:37] began to move with the foundation I know
[1:16:40] I'm referring to a lot of these places
[1:16:41] but look how God begins to move with the
[1:16:44] foundation
[1:16:45] he had a masterpiece and his son and his
[1:16:48] bride there in Eden and God begins to
[1:16:51] move back and there's a great foundation
[1:16:54] that's laid for this masterpiece
[1:16:57] you know many of you you've seen
[1:16:59] Michelangelo some of you know they have
[1:17:01] the little statutes and things like that
[1:17:03] and I remember a time I remember how old
[1:17:08] I was but it seemed like they were
[1:17:10] really selling them you knowing I still
[1:17:13] like to get my hand on one of them right
[1:17:14] now I don't know where they're at so but
[1:17:16] I they were selling them some of that
[1:17:19] some of the church there and where we
[1:17:21] were going and and you know you see on
[1:17:24] the bottom of those statues there's a
[1:17:26] foundation there's a foundation you
[1:17:29] can't just have it there without a
[1:17:31] foundation there's got to be a
[1:17:33] foundation or a platform for it to rest
[1:17:35] on and God Himself you know he he just
[1:17:39] didn't come there within a body but God
[1:17:41] began to set the very foundation of the
[1:17:44] program and how that God would lay it
[1:17:47] first of all with faith there with
[1:17:48] Abraham in an elective faith it was it
[1:17:51] was faith it was God God who called to
[1:17:53] Abraham God was determined to save man
[1:17:57] it was not Abraham looking for God but
[1:18:00] God was looking for Abraham it was not
[1:18:04] Abraham praying and seeking after God
[1:18:06] but but no doubt there was probably
[1:18:09] something within Abraham's life that it
[1:18:11] was looking at there's got to be
[1:18:12] something more than this but who gave
[1:18:14] him that God gave him bad and and then
[1:18:17] one day how that God spoke to him and
[1:18:20] and then spoke to him that you know I
[1:18:22] get the out of the land of thy kindred
[1:18:24] and my Nativity and unto a land I will
[1:18:26] show thee and and I will bless thee and
[1:18:28] I will multiply thee and all of this had
[1:18:31] promised that God had given you find
[1:18:33] Abraham Abraham you know he goes a
[1:18:35] little bit journeys a little bit and he
[1:18:36] stops down there in one spot but you see
[1:18:39] God's determination this was not based
[1:18:41] upon Abraham strength or Abraham's
[1:18:44] ability oh my but God Himself was moving
[1:18:48] upon Abraham and it would be God's faith
[1:18:50] that would so move upon Abraham to where
[1:18:53] there would be such a foundation of
[1:18:55] faith that would be laid for this
[1:18:58] masterpiece to come there through
[1:19:00] Abraham Abraham had such faith to even
[1:19:04] think about it with with Isaac you know
[1:19:06] and how that Isaac represented that of
[1:19:08] love think of them that
[1:19:10] of how Isaac you know I just thinking of
[1:19:13] that how that Isaac himself he comes up
[1:19:16] to this place and you know he submits
[1:19:18] himself to his father
[1:19:20] Abraham's walking in faith you know this
[1:19:22] is faith
[1:19:23] Abraham's not walking without faith
[1:19:25] Abraham's faith is is reaching such a
[1:19:28] time of maturity but you know there's
[1:19:30] only one way that he could have that
[1:19:31] kind of faith it's because Abraham has a
[1:19:34] real love there's only one way because
[1:19:36] you can't have faith without love I'm
[1:19:38] talking about a faith that trusts God's
[1:19:40] trust God in all things because faith
[1:19:43] worketh by love Abraham trusted God you
[1:19:47] understand what I'm saying it's like you
[1:19:49] could trust you and maybe your children
[1:19:50] or or trust you know somebody to come
[1:19:52] into your house if you're gonna be gone
[1:19:54] on vacation or something you can trust
[1:19:56] him to come into your house there's a
[1:19:57] trust but how much greater that's just
[1:19:59] an example but how much greater God
[1:20:01] trusted Abraham so God trusted him and
[1:20:04] Abraham trusted God it's just such a
[1:20:07] measure to where when Abraham said I'm
[1:20:09] gonna go up on this hill I am the lad
[1:20:11] and we're gonna come back we're gonna go
[1:20:13] worship and we're gonna come back down
[1:20:15] it was speaking of the greatness of the
[1:20:18] obedience of the very Lamb of God and
[1:20:21] through that obedience he would be
[1:20:23] raised back up among the true worshipers
[1:20:26] that were born our faith Lauria Isaac's
[1:20:31] surrendered himself father where's the
[1:20:33] sacrifice was an act he submitted
[1:20:37] himself into the hands of his father he
[1:20:42] gave himself what love then you find
[1:20:45] Jacob my brother man he really says that
[1:20:50] in the masterpiece he says Jacob means
[1:20:52] grace he said anybody knows that he said
[1:20:55] you just study Jacobs life and you study
[1:20:58] Jacobs life study Jacobs life after God
[1:21:01] transforms him when he brings out the
[1:21:04] hidden mystery of Israel then you find
[1:21:07] places in the scripture
[1:21:08] Israel's acting and then there's times
[1:21:10] in the scripture Jacob is acting you
[1:21:13] with me it's just like you and me
[1:21:15] there's parts where how it is the God
[1:21:17] part and then there's parts about us
[1:21:19] that still the Samuel part come on
[1:21:23] but the main thing about it is we have
[1:21:25] been changed
[1:21:27] we've been quickened our desire has been
[1:21:31] changed glory be to God
[1:21:35] Jacob is Grace it could only be issued
[1:21:39] in with truly divine grace and then to
[1:21:42] see how the very top of it of this
[1:21:45] foundation would be perfection
[1:21:47] and that of Joseph and here that body
[1:21:51] would set upon that perfection so this
[1:21:54] foundation of which the first
[1:21:56] masterpiece the bridegroom was brought
[1:22:00] forth is the same foundation upon which
[1:22:04] the very bride herself is brought forth
[1:22:08] by the very faith and the love and the
[1:22:11] grace and the perfection of Almighty God
[1:22:14] it's God's great determination it's
[1:22:17] God's great working and think of how
[1:22:19] that you know God he preached this to
[1:22:22] Abraham God preaches you believe that he
[1:22:27] preached to Abraham when he called
[1:22:29] Abraham Paul says he preached this
[1:22:31] gospel unto Abraham wearing that God
[1:22:34] would justify the heathen so here
[1:22:37] remember when he brings Abraham
[1:22:39] you know Abraham's coming to a place and
[1:22:41] Abraham begins to ask God he says Lord
[1:22:44] what are you going to give me what shall
[1:22:49] be mine ere I have this Eliezer of
[1:22:53] Damascus now remember you got to stay on
[1:22:55] the top when it's time to stay on it and
[1:22:56] move on when it's not time for it in
[1:22:59] this particular looking at a scripture
[1:23:01] Eliezer could not be his heir because
[1:23:05] Eliezer was not born in Abraham's house
[1:23:08] he was not of his seed there had been
[1:23:13] listen to me now listen now there were
[1:23:16] many that were bought along the journey
[1:23:20] even when you look at how God when he
[1:23:23] would issue in how Israel were to treat
[1:23:26] those who were strangers that had been
[1:23:29] brought in in wouldn't treat them bad
[1:23:32] but there was still a part of it to wear
[1:23:34] when you look at how Abraham even
[1:23:36] one down and remember he went after lot
[1:23:38] he went after a lot and all those
[1:23:40] servants that were down there they
[1:23:42] didn't come back there and and serve and
[1:23:44] and move where Abraham was at but yet he
[1:23:47] loosened them old friends
[1:23:49] there's many lives that God sets free
[1:23:53] and loosens but yet they never ever were
[1:23:56] ordained to be a part of that elective
[1:23:58] grace of Almighty God but yet thank God
[1:24:01] for salvation they can serve Him as
[1:24:06] servants but let me tell you you were
[1:24:07] never ordained to be a servant you were
[1:24:11] never ordained to be a slave
[1:24:13] I don't care how much sometimes you
[1:24:15] might think that I'm unworthy I'm this
[1:24:17] remember it was never anything based on
[1:24:20] our worthiness or your worthiness we are
[1:24:23] sons and daughters of God by the
[1:24:25] elective grace of Almighty God it's God
[1:24:28] moving through and by that very process
[1:24:31] of redemption that brings back his
[1:24:34] children unto himself
[1:24:38] it moves upon Abraham Abraham said
[1:24:40] whereby shall I know I shall inherit and
[1:24:42] God moves down and it begins to confirm
[1:24:45] his covenant unto Abraham this is how
[1:24:48] you're going to know it I think of this
[1:24:50] how that God had Abraham to separate
[1:24:55] those beasts whose bodies he had him
[1:24:59] separated showing that of the law in
[1:25:03] that of grace this covenant is a
[1:25:06] covenant of grace but God was already
[1:25:10] showing that the law would come but the
[1:25:14] notice there was no way to join that of
[1:25:17] the law and that of the grace but that
[1:25:19] little white light that logos God
[1:25:25] Himself moved right down God in Christ
[1:25:29] moved right down and right through those
[1:25:32] feasts and proclaimed I will make a way
[1:25:38] this is the confirmation of it Abraham
[1:25:41] that's a confirmation that your seed
[1:25:44] will inhabit the land I will bring forth
[1:25:47] your seed God confirmed it right there
[1:25:51] that was saddled that was to confirm it
[1:25:53] to Abraham that his faith resting and
[1:25:56] God you see friends it was not up to
[1:25:58] Abraham to get stronger it was not
[1:26:02] Abraham when we sat down with him on
[1:26:04] that day it's not Abraham gonna be
[1:26:06] sitting there saying well you know what
[1:26:07] I read the promises over and over and
[1:26:09] over and as I read the promises over and
[1:26:11] over I recited them I memorized him I
[1:26:13] talked about it and I got stronger
[1:26:15] nonsense it is not not of worse but I do
[1:26:24] believe that Abraham lived in those
[1:26:26] promises I do believe he read those
[1:26:29] promises why would you not want to read
[1:26:32] something that's about you why would you
[1:26:36] not want to rehearse something that God
[1:26:38] had said about you that's why Abraham
[1:26:43] would rehearse it
[1:26:44] - I signa remember even when Abraham
[1:26:47] would express this to the different ones
[1:26:49] on down it was not just merely the
[1:26:50] handing of a word to another but God
[1:26:53] would come and confirm his word of oath
[1:26:56] that he gave to Abraham and in each time
[1:26:59] God would say that I am the God of thy
[1:27:02] father he told Jacob I'm the God of thy
[1:27:06] father Abraham Abraham was his
[1:27:10] granddaddy
[1:27:10] but that faith or my Jacob was of the
[1:27:14] same one that Abraham was of Jacob was
[1:27:17] born of that same faith that same
[1:27:20] revelation
[1:27:21] I think of Joseph was born other - you
[1:27:29] realize if they hadn't been born of it
[1:27:31] when Jacob told him even you remember
[1:27:33] when Jacob was saying when I pass take
[1:27:35] me down there and bury me and they did
[1:27:37] think about when Joseph Joseph said
[1:27:40] don't you leave my bones here he said
[1:27:45] you take me with you when you leave when
[1:27:48] God visits you you see how he could
[1:27:50] stand there
[1:27:50] he knew the Santhal
[1:27:52] oh god it's gonna visit his people the
[1:27:57] time didn't get easier the time got
[1:28:00] harder the persecution grew great but it
[1:28:03] was at the time when the persecution was
[1:28:05] growing great that God stepped on the
[1:28:08] scene and fulfilled his word
[1:28:09] oh my it would be no Marvel when
[1:28:13] everything is easy and everything is
[1:28:15] smooth but God steps on the scene when
[1:28:17] everything is against it all opposition
[1:28:19] is rising and he declares himself to be
[1:28:23] Almighty God I tell you this morning
[1:28:26] that in whatever the need would be in
[1:28:28] your life it might seem that the
[1:28:29] mountain is so high it might seem that
[1:28:31] the river is so deep but the same God
[1:28:34] who opened the Red Sea the same God who
[1:28:36] part of the Jordan the same God that can
[1:28:39] make a tunnel through a mountain is the
[1:28:41] same God for your need for your
[1:28:43] situation he specializes in things
[1:28:49] thought impossible he makes himself
[1:28:54] known now let's look at this for a few
[1:28:58] moments there's an entrance of the law
[1:29:06] we know that Israel coming out of of
[1:29:12] Egypt that God had moved down there
[1:29:16] grace gave the promise to Abraham is
[1:29:20] that right God's grace moved down and
[1:29:24] called his man for the hour his prophet
[1:29:30] God's grace this pillar of fire he came
[1:29:37] to confirm that that is all the grace of
[1:29:40] God and he moves down there into Egypt
[1:29:46] and brings out the children of Israel
[1:29:51] then we find within this moment that
[1:29:55] there is a or Israel makes a choice
[1:29:59] they're not forced into this decision
[1:30:02] they're not forced to make this decision
[1:30:05] God had told him you'll be a peculiar
[1:30:07] treasure unto me but I was marvel I look
[1:30:10] at how that brother random will use this
[1:30:12] a few times in the message and talk
[1:30:13] about how that Israel made a rational
[1:30:15] mistake in Exodus 19 and when you look
[1:30:20] at it you you see it that there is a
[1:30:22] covenant that is given and it truly is a
[1:30:24] covenant that is given by God but Israel
[1:30:29] enters into it and it when brother
[1:30:31] raddimus he'll go into dealing with that
[1:30:32] you know that it had to be within the
[1:30:34] hearts of the people to wear that has he
[1:30:37] said they rejected grace and began to
[1:30:40] take something that they could do
[1:30:42] themselves God was speaking to him but
[1:30:46] they said don't let God speak no more
[1:30:47] and let Moses speak we all understand
[1:30:50] that's all working out and a great
[1:30:52] program and plan of God but then to see
[1:30:55] how this law itself let's focus in on
[1:30:58] this how the law itself would enter the
[1:31:01] law comes about Paul tells us it was
[1:31:05] added because of the transgressions is
[1:31:08] that right
[1:31:10] it was the law was given that sin might
[1:31:15] abound be declared so great you see it's
[1:31:20] like this out here on this roadway I try
[1:31:24] to take the youngest one of the youngest
[1:31:25] persons in here and I could ask them and
[1:31:28] say in your car if you ride with mommy
[1:31:30] and daddy or you ride anywhere else can
[1:31:33] you go as fast as you want to go well
[1:31:38] you know you can't now you can put down
[1:31:44] the pedal you can get out here on 480
[1:31:51] and just hope you're one that don't get
[1:31:53] flagged over 480 is 160 60 I think so
[1:32:01] don't don't look by what the cars are
[1:32:03] going on there
[1:32:07] but here's a speed limit let's say right
[1:32:09] out here out 35 miles per hour right out
[1:32:11] here on this road you can go faster but
[1:32:16] what happens when you go above 35 you're
[1:32:20] gonna get pulled over in this village
[1:32:22] you go a few miles over you're gonna be
[1:32:25] pulled over you say how do you know I've
[1:32:27] seen some of you over the years and it's
[1:32:34] true it's true you know it's just like
[1:32:38] this you know certain places where you
[1:32:39] can drive and you could say ah we can go
[1:32:42] a little bit and we give it a little bit
[1:32:43] of grace you know they give a little bit
[1:32:45] of grace what's greats mean well they
[1:32:46] give about five miles over there they're
[1:32:47] okay with it you better hope they don't
[1:32:50] get a new recruit they don't know that
[1:32:52] unwritten rule but you realize that when
[1:32:57] that that law is set out here if you if
[1:33:01] you run that law what what you know what
[1:33:03] good does it do if it's out here 35
[1:33:06] miles per hour and you've got cops that
[1:33:08] set right out here what good does it do
[1:33:10] if you if people are running up and down
[1:33:12] here 55 or 65 miles per hour 35 might be
[1:33:16] right out there he don't mean nothing
[1:33:18] you know it's like somebody say hey what
[1:33:22] does that sign me they don't mean
[1:33:23] nothing you see it's become something
[1:33:26] that it doesn't hold it holds nothing to
[1:33:29] it it's it don't mean anything they just
[1:33:31] say that it don't mean anything now God
[1:33:33] has given his word and God has given his
[1:33:38] word now we understand that the law
[1:33:40] itself it entered in to magnify said it
[1:33:43] pointed out that we indeed were sinners
[1:33:46] we were guilty let me tell you something
[1:33:49] God's Word even under the administration
[1:33:52] of grace it takes God dealing with the
[1:33:55] heart to bring conviction for a life to
[1:33:58] see I need him it's not oh they don't
[1:34:05] matter I'll read this in the word and
[1:34:07] this is what God says concerning women
[1:34:10] and God says this in our dress and God
[1:34:12] says that we should be baptized in the
[1:34:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:15] oh don't pay no attention to that really
[1:34:18] that
[1:34:18] like going right down this roadway right
[1:34:20] here and saying that sign 35
[1:34:21] miles-per-hour
[1:34:22] who cares you don't have to do that but
[1:34:25] every word that God has given must be
[1:34:29] fulfilled and he gives us the grace he
[1:34:33] gives us the grace to even come to him
[1:34:35] it's him that gives us the grace to even
[1:34:38] be cleansed and set free by the blood
[1:34:40] it's him that gives that's third stage
[1:34:43] of grace to where he'll step inside of
[1:34:45] you and I it's all him working but it's
[1:34:49] us submitting and surrendering to that
[1:34:50] word so the law itself it magnified it
[1:34:54] it spoke of the need because the law
[1:34:56] could only put you in prison that's all
[1:34:59] the law could ever do it could only put
[1:35:02] you in prison now think about it this
[1:35:04] first covenant that God gave this first
[1:35:07] covenant now the Scriptures refer to it
[1:35:10] like this as the first as the first
[1:35:12] covenant but it's when Paul speaks of it
[1:35:14] in the book of Hebrews but he's not
[1:35:17] referring to that covenant that God made
[1:35:19] with Abraham this first covenant that he
[1:35:21] made with the fathers when they came out
[1:35:24] in that Exodus and when they came out
[1:35:28] not only within this first covenant that
[1:35:31] God make this this first covenant with
[1:35:33] them that law and Israel was enjoined to
[1:35:36] that law but in this there was a
[1:35:38] tabernacle there was a first tabernacle
[1:35:42] there was a that second partner there
[1:35:43] was the holiest of all and to think of
[1:35:46] how that God God himself in the midst of
[1:35:49] his time talking with Moses there in the
[1:35:51] mount God spoke out his desire he said
[1:35:57] let them make me a sanctuary that I may
[1:36:01] dwell among them remember God's desire
[1:36:06] is to Tabernacle inside God's desire is
[1:36:13] to dwell in side of his children and so
[1:36:19] to see how that within this how that God
[1:36:22] would lay out even within the tabernacle
[1:36:25] itself even all the parts that were laid
[1:36:27] out I go back to this scripture here in
[1:36:30] Exodus 33 7
[1:36:32] and I'll think about when Moses walked
[1:36:35] down off the mountain God had told him
[1:36:39] get down for the people have sinned a
[1:36:42] great sin they made back golden calf you
[1:36:48] know Aaron was still under that
[1:36:49] inspiration how they made that golden
[1:36:52] calf that this be there this be that
[1:36:53] God's that brought thee out of Egypt and
[1:36:56] here there turned us there there turned
[1:36:58] aside after what God has already told
[1:37:02] them in a previous chapter I believe
[1:37:04] it's Exodus 20 were God had already
[1:37:06] expressed to them not to do such a thing
[1:37:09] but then to think we're God himself
[1:37:12] after Moses himself the Spirit of Christ
[1:37:15] steps in to intercede for the people of
[1:37:18] God to where that he comes down and
[1:37:20] remember the scriptures are very clear
[1:37:22] how that the Spirit of God Moses says
[1:37:25] who's on the Lord's side let him come
[1:37:27] and stand by me and we see this begin to
[1:37:29] take place and after God moves through
[1:37:32] the camp and removing all of those who
[1:37:34] truly had sinned against him but then
[1:37:36] Moses went up to make an atonement Moses
[1:37:38] then comes back down and in this verse
[1:37:41] of scripture how that Moses was directed
[1:37:44] by God take the tabernacle and put it
[1:37:47] outside the camp God told him and said I
[1:37:51] will not and I cannot go up in the midst
[1:37:53] of you you're a stiff-necked to people
[1:37:56] rebellious I cannot go up in the midst
[1:37:59] of you but notice his desire for
[1:38:03] relationship he did not remove it
[1:38:06] altogether he put it outside of their
[1:38:09] camp he put it outside and the Bible
[1:38:13] says that within this scripture here
[1:38:15] that Moses took the tabernacle pitched
[1:38:18] it without the camp afar from the camp
[1:38:20] and called it the tabernacle the
[1:38:22] congregation and it came to pass that
[1:38:23] everyone which sought the Lord went out
[1:38:26] unto the tabernacle the congregation
[1:38:29] which was without the camp where did
[1:38:33] Jesus die not in the camp he suffered
[1:38:37] without the gate is that right
[1:38:40] when they had rejected him come on
[1:38:43] somebody
[1:38:44] what did Stephen say when Stephens
[1:38:46] to do that day he said you stiff-necked
[1:38:48] on circumcised and ears is that right
[1:38:53] but there were some who were in
[1:38:55] Jerusalem who went out there were some
[1:38:59] who caught hold of the vision and some
[1:39:02] who went out and who became a partaker
[1:39:04] of that life well God's desire that that
[1:39:09] Tabernacle would be pitched then we come
[1:39:13] here in the scripture Hebrews 10 chapter
[1:39:16] 4 for it is not possible that the blood
[1:39:19] of bulls and of goats should take away
[1:39:21] sins wherefore when he cometh into the
[1:39:24] world he say a sacrifice and offering
[1:39:26] thou wouldest not but a body hast thou
[1:39:30] prepared me in burnt offerings and
[1:39:34] sacrifices for sin thou had us no
[1:39:38] pleasure God himself remember when he
[1:39:42] came to Mary listen to me now
[1:39:45] he came to Mary he said Behold you're
[1:39:52] gonna be with child how is this gonna be
[1:39:55] Lord seeing I don't know a man he said
[1:39:58] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you
[1:40:02] Gabriel made the announcement that this
[1:40:05] within you will be a work of Almighty
[1:40:10] God it will not be anything of Mary but
[1:40:15] God Himself was going to prepare a body
[1:40:19] that he himself could come and dwell in
[1:40:23] the Almighty God stepping down to take
[1:40:27] kinship with man God created that body
[1:40:32] that blood cell every other blood was
[1:40:34] polluted is that right
[1:40:36] nobody you could take the most righteous
[1:40:39] man there was not one of them not one of
[1:40:42] them not one couldn't make a way back
[1:40:45] not one of them there's only one that
[1:40:49] could do this and that's God himself
[1:40:56] in burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:40:59] sin thou had us no pleasure and to think
[1:41:01] about it there are many great men there
[1:41:04] are many believers who offered these
[1:41:07] sacrifices but it did not fulfill God's
[1:41:11] desire it was given for that time but
[1:41:15] God's desire is that he would dwell in
[1:41:18] his people in Redemption
[1:41:22] is that right the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:41:27] 9:11 let me just refer to this but
[1:41:30] Christ being coming high priest of good
[1:41:33] things to come by a greater and more
[1:41:35] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[1:41:38] that is to say not of this building this
[1:41:43] body was a creation of God by his word
[1:41:50] he spoke his word and Mary believed it
[1:41:56] why did she believe it she was ordained
[1:41:59] to believe it she didn't know that she
[1:42:03] was the vessel but God declared to her
[1:42:07] she was the vessel she was the one that
[1:42:12] where Isaiah would speak up but here God
[1:42:16] Himself coming down into her now look at
[1:42:18] this now God has come and he has come in
[1:42:23] physical form multiple times already is
[1:42:30] that right but he could have never went
[1:42:32] to Calvary that way never he had to come
[1:42:37] through and by the woman he had to be
[1:42:42] made under the law in order to redeem
[1:42:47] his visitations to Abraham he could not
[1:42:50] have just went it wouldn't have paid the
[1:42:52] price come on somebody so think about
[1:42:56] this this was not something that was a
[1:42:59] pleasure ride it was not something that
[1:43:03] anybody would just sign up for I hope
[1:43:07] you're with me
[1:43:08] this was not something that anybody
[1:43:11] would volunteer for because in order for
[1:43:15] this notice even the condescending and
[1:43:17] coming down and becoming one of us he
[1:43:20] took upon himself a body made in the
[1:43:23] likeness of sinful flesh but to think of
[1:43:25] it friends he came in that countable
[1:43:27] body the very king of glory the very one
[1:43:32] who created let the atoms the molecules
[1:43:35] the stars the very earth and the very
[1:43:38] creator himself coming down creating a
[1:43:42] body but he might step into it for
[1:43:45] redemption one bid he what drove him to
[1:43:48] that what brought him from glory what is
[1:43:52] that that's in constrains him it was
[1:43:54] love his love his desire for fellowship
[1:44:00] for communion with you and me his desire
[1:44:04] brought him down don't you realize it
[1:44:08] that your power of your need is so great
[1:44:10] the Bible says in the scriptures it says
[1:44:13] that the husband hath not power his body
[1:44:16] but the wife the wife hath not power her
[1:44:18] body but the husband don't you realize
[1:44:19] that it is your need that draws him to
[1:44:22] you and it was his need to be worshiped
[1:44:27] as Redeemer that has drawn us unto Him
[1:44:35] God he creates a body for himself to
[1:44:42] come down and dwell in the Bible says in
[1:44:45] verse seven then said i lo i come in the
[1:44:49] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:44:52] to do thy will O God above when he said
[1:44:58] sacrifice and burnt offerings and
[1:44:59] offering for sin thou wouldest not
[1:45:02] neither had his pleasure therein which
[1:45:04] are offered by the law then said he lo I
[1:45:10] come to do thy will O God he taketh away
[1:45:13] the first that he may establish the
[1:45:18] second
[1:45:20] now he can't not come back down he can't
[1:45:23] come down and rewrite his word that will
[1:45:27] not be a taking away that would be an
[1:45:30] uh-oh
[1:45:30] oops I changed my mind but he has to be
[1:45:35] there has to be one who's able to take
[1:45:38] away the first this first covenant this
[1:45:42] which he made with the fathers when they
[1:45:44] came out of Egypt the law there has he
[1:45:46] has to be able to do this that he might
[1:45:50] establish the second don't you see
[1:45:52] friends he can never walk by law and
[1:45:54] grace it cannot be law and grace they
[1:45:56] cannot be under bondage and under fear
[1:45:58] God doesn't want you to serve Him under
[1:46:00] fear God doesn't wants you looking at
[1:46:02] I'd better do this and I'll tell you
[1:46:04] what if I don't go to church but the
[1:46:06] same is liable to call me or somebody's
[1:46:07] label to call me or or somebody God
[1:46:09] don't want you serve him by law gun
[1:46:11] don't want you to do anything about all
[1:46:12] this and friends you can get so carried
[1:46:14] away by law in looking at things to
[1:46:16] where you begin to look at the things
[1:46:18] you do as though you're meriting God's
[1:46:20] favor on a daily basis let me tell you
[1:46:22] something the greatest thing that God
[1:46:24] can have is a heart that is surrendered
[1:46:26] to him that he can come down and speak
[1:46:29] to that you might know you might be a
[1:46:30] time you're walking right down the store
[1:46:32] you might be standing right in the
[1:46:34] kitchen
[1:46:34] folding the clothes but you could say
[1:46:36] Lord I Love You Lord Jesus how I thank
[1:46:38] you Lord and oh my what is that His
[1:46:41] grace will come by his miss presence
[1:46:44] moves right down it's not something that
[1:46:45] you're made to do he's not standing
[1:46:47] there saying now you tell me you love me
[1:46:49] you you offer a praise to me if you
[1:46:52] don't wash him you know no I delight to
[1:46:57] do thy will O God now you must do this
[1:47:02] no I delight to do that well Oh God well
[1:47:07] if I don't do this I'll be lost no no no
[1:47:10] that's not that's not how he wants you
[1:47:13] to serve him but his word ministers his
[1:47:16] word ministers in grace to reveal his
[1:47:20] way that we might approach him and that
[1:47:26] he alone can take his word and ride it
[1:47:30] into the very depths of our life till
[1:47:33] it's no
[1:47:34] anger I can't do this I can't do this I
[1:47:37] better not do this but when he writes it
[1:47:41] with his life it's no longer I can't I
[1:47:46] don't want to my love is to him
[1:47:53] and to him alone it's him that I desire
[1:47:58] to please time just running out on me
[1:48:06] but let me just try to drop this because
[1:48:08] I have to close
[1:48:14] in order for God to take away that first
[1:48:16] and establish that second he had to
[1:48:19] become flesh and he had to take the
[1:48:24] penalty of his own law and not just take
[1:48:28] that penalty but God himself would so
[1:48:32] subject himself in humanity that he
[1:48:36] would literally take his own laws and
[1:48:39] live by now remember when he came here
[1:48:44] he is he's the very lawgiver this is the
[1:48:48] very one who spoke to Abraham before
[1:48:52] Abraham was he's the very one who spoke
[1:48:58] to Moses on Sinai he was the very one in
[1:49:03] the midst of the bush dwelling there
[1:49:06] he's the very one that there gave the
[1:49:11] commandments that by his presence his
[1:49:15] light his finger as it were wrote the
[1:49:19] commandments and gave him and here he
[1:49:23] himself the law giver the sins and takes
[1:49:29] upon a body
[1:49:37] remember what the Pharisees and what
[1:49:39] many of them thought at that time they
[1:49:42] thought he came to destroy the law you
[1:49:48] see they didn't understand it needed
[1:49:51] fulfilled he told him I have not come to
[1:49:55] destroy it I come to fulfill it is that
[1:50:02] right here's the lawgiver himself
[1:50:06] stepping down and OMA that blessed day
[1:50:13] there at the River Jordan here comes his
[1:50:19] tabernacle his temple walking up to the
[1:50:24] Jordan here stands John a messenger
[1:50:30] preparing the way and here comes this
[1:50:35] temple this body becomes walking into
[1:50:41] the water and as John baptizes him in
[1:50:45] water
[1:50:47] it wasn't baptized because he needed to
[1:50:51] repent he was being washed as the Lamb
[1:50:59] it was also preparation for his coming
[1:51:04] ministry as high priest and as he comes
[1:51:09] up out of the water the heavens are open
[1:51:13] and out of the heavens here comes the
[1:51:16] Spirit of God descending like a dove you
[1:51:19] see it had come there when every
[1:51:22] Tabernacle had been built it was him
[1:51:25] coming to the tabernacle that announced
[1:51:29] the finish and here he comes and steps
[1:51:33] in the messenger of the Covenant steps
[1:51:39] into his temple suddenly
[1:51:46] greatest event greatest event that took
[1:51:51] place upon earth God and man had
[1:51:56] reconciled God and man had reconciled
[1:52:04] there'd be many prophets that had lived
[1:52:06] before but God was not able to reconcile
[1:52:10] with a man who was born in sin now one
[1:52:16] of them could fulfill the law but here
[1:52:22] comes the lawgiver himself all hope was
[1:52:27] lost but here he comes according to his
[1:52:30] word and the body that he had formed by
[1:52:34] his word he steps down and he makes a
[1:52:39] claim this is my body this is my body so
[1:52:45] much of my word has went forth to make
[1:52:48] this body their right form from them
[1:52:52] same elements of the earth but a blood
[1:52:56] cell now through this god himself will
[1:53:00] fulfill his own law for what for what
[1:53:08] for you and for me somebody to do that
[1:53:16] for you do that for me oh how we owe him
[1:53:20] our whole life it's not something where
[1:53:24] it comes to that of a law but it's a
[1:53:27] love affair that he could express his
[1:53:31] desire he is loved in such a manner he
[1:53:34] just didn't say it he just didn't say it
[1:53:37] he manifested it he took his own laws
[1:53:45] and lived by it
[1:53:50] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:53:53] he manifested that he manifested that
[1:53:59] for he became one of us that he might
[1:54:04] redeem us thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:54:07] God with all thy heart soul mind body
[1:54:09] and strength
[1:54:10] never had there been one upon the earth
[1:54:12] because I could declare that but here he
[1:54:15] stood the very love of God himself why
[1:54:20] that he might offer up and pay the price
[1:54:24] and bring this love into the heart of
[1:54:28] you and me he took his own laws and
[1:54:33] lived by them
[1:54:35] I'm closed I told you that before Jesus
[1:54:39] did not walk around this hell yeah I
[1:54:41] can't do this what was it that
[1:54:45] constrained him the same thing that
[1:54:48] constrains you the love of God I delight
[1:54:54] to do thy will O God it was resting
[1:55:00] within his heart here was the love of
[1:55:03] God on display o love of God how rich
[1:55:10] and pure how measureless and strong
[1:55:13] friends don't you see don't you see what
[1:55:16] the real true working of redemption the
[1:55:19] real true baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:55:21] the love of God moving into your soul
[1:55:24] that changes you to where you no longer
[1:55:27] desire the things of the world you
[1:55:31] desire him and your desire is I do only
[1:55:36] those things that please him my desire
[1:55:41] is to live for him and if you go to do
[1:55:46] something a little wrong think something
[1:55:48] wrong that dove is there and that dove
[1:55:52] is there to bring correction what is
[1:55:57] that that's the love of God
[1:55:59] oh love of God how rich and pure do you
[1:56:02] see God's design was not that he any
[1:56:05] mortal would serve him out of law but
[1:56:10] out of a love affair to wear a life that
[1:56:13] is surrendered unto Him giving our all
[1:56:17] to him surrendering our all his vessels
[1:56:20] that he might have the right of way you
[1:56:22] love him this morning I trust I trust
[1:56:25] that the word where we've even come to
[1:56:27] in this place I trust that it could
[1:56:29] brings you to a place to say Lord I want
[1:56:32] to surrender my home I want to give you
[1:56:34] more Lord God all of me Lord Jesus I
[1:56:38] want you to have all of me Lord God

[1:57:57] Psalms mercy and truth

[1:58:05] and truth and peace have kissed heaven
[1:58:11] and earth has joined together

[2:12:37] work like that
[2:12:38] with infections and I just said Lord I'm
[2:12:45] going to just accept your healing right
[2:12:48] now and it was something just simple and
[2:12:54] I went into the bathroom to brush my
[2:13:00] teeth and everything and when I looked
[2:13:03] they were both gone
[2:13:10] I wanna share another one last night my
[2:13:16] I had a back pain so bad I had near the
[2:13:21] bottom of my back it was very painful I
[2:13:25] couldn't even get off the hardly get off
[2:13:27] the chair in the living room and I was a
[2:13:34] real pain I couldn't even get up to get
[2:13:39] something to eat you know that's really
[2:13:41] hard for me and anyway I went to bed I
[2:13:50] went to bed and I was in pain lots of
[2:13:55] pain when I woke up in the middle of
[2:13:57] night it was even worse I felt like

[2:14:16] can do it again and I couldn't even turn
[2:14:22] to my side it was hard and I said I'm
[2:14:27] gonna turn to my side because I like
[2:14:29] laying on my side on my left side and I

[2:15:09] love and his care Joel he didn't have
[2:15:11] the Bible like what you and I have he
[2:15:14] didn't have that he didn't have any
[2:15:16] chapters or anything to refer back to
[2:15:19] but he could look up and he could read
[2:15:24] in the heavens the love of God
[2:15:29] it was known to job to see how that that
[2:15:32] God all around us all around us well did
[2:15:37] Paul write by inspiration God makes
[2:15:40] known his Godhead all around us he makes
[2:15:46] you known the greatness of and yet some
