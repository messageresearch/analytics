oh God how we Lord Jesus stand here all God's so thankful because Lord we realized that it is solemnly by your grace Lord that our eyes would be open our hearts would be turned Lord it's your grace I

moment I pray Lord we ask all these things Lord that may our hearts Lord warmed by your presence Lord may you come among us Lord and change us Lord change lives Lord God I pray this morning Lord we just love you and we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's look in the scriptures here - first John chapter 3 say we certainly greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ first John chapter three we'll just read a few verses of Scripture will let you be seated behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him now beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope this expectation in him purifies himself even as he is pure amen I'd like to begin speaking to you here we've been dealing with the thought and I'd like to just title this this morning just leading into it a little bit on reunited with another nature may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated when we think of this and we've been looking at that of the new birth how did the Lord Jesus has spoke to us you must be born again and we know that that that particular passage of Scripture there is without many that read that and the new birth itself is taught in many different ways according to what people themselves would understand or what they would know but we realized in the in the simplicity of it all that in the new birth is to be born again and as simple as it can be it's a new life it's not the same old life remade and reaping and relived but it's a new life that begins within the same old temple so when we look at this in the scripture in first John chapter 3 verse 1 the Scriptures tell us here what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God when we look at this in the scripture we recognize that this is not something that is being bestowed or another word for bestowed there is to confer it's not something that is just being stuck upon us as though that in in in some manner that we are are something that we are truly not but Andheri but in reality within everything this is the effect of the love of God that has come to raise up that which God always knew and the whole plan of redemption of what it was all tied to it's not something that where when we look at it that you know when a person can look and and have a thought and say well you know we're sons of God but remember a son in itself but son PAC's the DNA it packs the name it packs the life of the father impacts all of those thing of the bloodline and when we we look at this in here in the scriptures as as as it is mentioned here beloved now are we the sons of God not not we will be but we are now the sons of God and to find that how when we look there in verse 3 every man that hath this hope this expectation in him purifies himself even as he is pure and we find that that expectation that as a believer that once God has brought that change that quickening into that life we have an expectation because that mystery as being unfold in our life there is come a change in our life and this is where John could say it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him the confidence is is because who he is now in all that he is we are we're not just a part of him we are who he is the scripture is very clear as it lays out here every man that has this same expectation within him purifies himself even as he is pure you realize you cannot be purified but but only according to the measure of purification that's ministered what the purification is ministered when we look back in the days of Luther there was a level of purification that they could come to it was a purification of the gesture live by faith and there were things that Luther was able to do under that word that was revealed but yet those who came under that word are a part of the body just as much as Wesley when he came there's a level of the word that comes and brings a further purification and it kept moving been in the restoration of the gifts and then to see how that God himself coming in this hour in entirety not just to release to you and I apart although we have the Holy Ghost in a portion but it's to release within us the fullness and the full reality of everything that was ever against us has been stricken off and there is a fullness that is moved upon our life in Redemption it's a full as a word that brings a purification in our life it's a word that brings a real true sanctification from within a word that brings a change and it's a word that continues to change us it's a word that continues to purify a word that continues to cleanse and you realize if it's a word a letter will cleanse it has to be a Living Word to bring a flimsy steel water will not cleanse it must be flowing running water that's the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ that this water his word is a living water and we are washed by the washing of water by the word so to receive this this this adoption or the placement as the scripture would say in in Ephesians 1 to have the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ that placement and you know placement is everything it's everything it makes it makes a difference because without the placement that expression of what God has sown with in your life can never be expressed so what God has placed their placement itself taking from one place to the other and worries transferring or moving to is that that which is within can come forth in expression so here this adoption of sons by Jesus Christ unto himself so when we look at this in in as we've covered that here in 1st John 3 we were always sons of God and Frank's Alyssa this can never be stated enough it can never be you know a person could say part on it's not heart on this is the Word of God this is the declaration this is this this is the whole thing of redemption that we can recognized at sons and daughters of God and the sons and daughters of God our beginning is not here in time we don't end here in time this body is a time body but God himself has moved in our life and we're no longer a time being we're a preacher of eternity amen God starts at color and has been expressed in this hour so this manner of love that he has bestowed upon us is not that he has made of something that were not but this manner of love has come to do what only his love can do and that's to release the true identity of who you and I always were in familiar passages in the book of Galatians Galatians 4:1 Paul says that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all now he's already an heir he's already a son but he difference nothing from a servant what is a servant what hell is the servant a servants always were waiting on tell me what to do okay I'll do this tell me what to do okay I'll do this tell me what to do I'll do this a servant is not clued into what it's all about that's what Jesus said a man must be born again without being born again he can never understand see the kingdom of God it's just something of tell me to do this tell me to do that okay I won't do this okay I won't do that and listen friends we need the Holy Spirit to remind us to deal with our life we need the preaching of the word to put that outer man in check we need the preacher in the word now listen here's how the preaching of the word it'll put that out or matichek it'll bring correction buddy while does it do it it does it by lifting the real you on the inside because you are the one that is ordained and anointed by God to rule over that outer man correction comes but with correction comes authority if we heed to that than authority comes so though he be Lord of all my having all of this within but yet he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father so everything in time I want you just to catch this here everything very simple principle but everything it is it is there appointed in a designated season of time friends if we can if we can truly take this this is a principle all the way through the scriptures if we can rest within that our faith rest within the word that no matter what it is that you're praying about whether it's lost whether it's loved ones that you don't see here your desires listen the desire is to pray but understanding this here if everything is in God's hands if you're praying you're committing it to the Lord you're looking faithful then God is able to move on them and God moves at his appointed time he won't be late he won't be early it'll be ready disappointed and when God is moving things along sometimes it doesn't seem to move along maybe fast enough for us but remember here God is the one who is in control God will bring forth every one of his words in its season anytime the word has gotten ahead and I don't say the word where people got ahead of the word in him with the wrong necessarily with wrong desire to try to get ahead of God but it's that thing's trying to make things happen that God is the only one can make those things happen what can't do it not you and I listen this handkerchief may have to be right here but you can't put it there you might know it has to be right here you know the degree of the heart the spirit where it needs to be you can say I just don't see it there yet I just don't see it there yet you can't put it there it has to be God sovereignly move upon those things that everything will come in line and everything will line up with this time it's not a coincidence than even the star there that supernatural star in the sky it's not a coincidence that God has he wrote his Bible in the heavens and all these things were lined up it's not a coincidence that the stars were lined up and those different things at certain times of birth upon this earth it's not a coincidence it is called aligning everything in his timing my momma when we think of that you know friends when you look at those things more and more that we look at the word it creates should create within us more and more of a reality to know that Lord it must be you and it is you doing it in my life so help me to get out of the way so just as your natural birth has been pre-planned your spiritual birth has been pre-planned by God God knew exactly what time what age gotten to exactly the moment God already had all that plant even so verse 3 when we were children were in bondage we were children but we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law whose the law that of sin and death he had to come under the penalty of his own law couldn't come through sexual birth because there there would be no redemption in that but there had to be a birth that of a virgin birth which is separate from the sexual birth that took place in the beginning showing showing in the ministry of the son of man coming there is another birth coming in the ministry of the son of man that's why the prophet could stand there and preach a message the birth pains and say that this earth is to be delivered of a new birth according to Malachi 4 why it's coming with the fullness to bring a deliverance hallelujah away when God since his word it comes to bring life verse 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons I want you to consider this this you know brother Branham lays heavily on this in the in the message future home and he intermittently continues to come back to it of how that when the Lord Jesus was here upon this earth here coming with the purpose of redemption and Satan tempted him in in in many in greatness of weakness and in many different places and there on the mountain tried to assert authority over him how would he assert authority by giving but the Lord Jesus stood there and would not take that gift because there had to be a purchase it had to be clear there could not be any in debt meant that is even felt or since that could not be anything that had to be a purchase and rather the Lord Jesus made that decision what that you and I could truly walk free and clear and this could not be gifted it had to be purchased and yet you and I received the gift of eternal life he purchased not what you and I can receive hallelujah we could have never received it if he had not purchased it when they tried to get Abraham a place to bury their of Sarah Abraham would not receive it they tried to give it to it how many people you know setting even right here in this congregation you wouldn't take something somebody's given you come on somebody why because to give it it means you don't got to spend your finances you don't got to go out and do it or whatever more you'll take it I'll be honest for you but the Lord Jesus he could have taken this you know what this would have meant no suffering it would have made an easier road but he would not succumb to the gift of just giving it there had to be a purchase why because with redemption redemption requires a purchase and Men there is an object that was there was a reason of his coming the Prophet tells us he did not die to save the entire world though he wanted to but he came for those who was in his foreknowledge but the grace of God spills over from the Lamb's Book of Life and there are many that are not sons and daughters but many that receive they are able to enter into after the white throne judgment into eternal life that's the grace of God I don't have any can have a problem with that I'm thankful for that that's grace it spill over this is not look at the Bible didn't say it came in a little bit of grace but it was abundant grace it spilled if the fall had not come listen friends what we see in Revelations to him he doesn't just say a book was opened he said a little book what is that of the Lamb section but thanks be to God that from that lamb section there if there had not been a fall there would have never been millions of people that would have ever lived upon this earth but in the midst of that like we begin looking at this back in December of last year these things God never lost sight of one the book passed back into the hands of the original owner what did the lamb's section it passed back into the hands of the original verse six says and because ye are sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ now lets you to catch the setting the background in many of these instances is very important as well Paul you know is dealing in this in this whole book of where men have come in and Paul called him false brethren these men had come under the influence of Peter and yet Peters are genuine elect of God but Peter had his own thoughts come on somebody we've seen how Peter you know was sitting there eating with him and he had his bacon and he was eating his sausage and his bratwurst and his pork chop and then some brothers came over the hill he grabbed the breath freshener wanted to clear his breath of bacon and he to make sure there was no grease on it why you say it well well he had a he had a dealing before he went to Cornelius house I know what I'm talking about he's after Cornelius's house you see that's why the washing of water by the word it comes to class Peter didn't needed so Clancy had oughta been regenerated he needed his sub-conscience that teaching that belief he needed that washed away because it was troubling him Paul is dealing with this letting them know you're not servants any longer but those that are under the law we're then in this in that particular that you don't know you don't understand what God is doing but the grace of God has come to lift you from that where is that we are above the Lord you say how can we be above the law because it is his law now written in our hearts by the Spirit of Almighty God this scripture is a very very tremendous scripture in verse 6 and because you are sons look at this this is a cause and effect because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts because you not become but you always were sons this is to come this is the reason of the coming of the Holy Spirit is to do what is to raise up and to bring into realization the sons and daughters of God now look at this in the message of some earning in church age brother Branham says now comes a higher triumphal capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost our triumphal capstone this is our triumphal capstone it's not only where we're at in the pyramid but it is also a signification this is our triumphal capsule this is that reality breaking in upon our lives in our hearts in the real true reality of what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost is all about the REM says there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as sons he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as sons hallelujah there's something that is there within your life to be able to receive that word to be able to receive the Holy Ghost it's just like there's all kinds of signals going through here right now I don't have my cell phone on me I don't have it on me it's back in my office there's all kinds of signals going through here there's signals that's going from my belt back but you don't have in your possession your own position the receiver to pick it up but if you have the receiver then you're able to receive the transmission of the waves that are invisible but yet you're able to receive them there must be something already there that's able to receive the Holy Ghost that's why the Prophet over and over and you find and even continue to grow as the message unfolds in the latter ages why he says that the Holy Ghost he said he can fall he said it and if he said that word he said it could make that Holy Ghost it can make a church member it can make a good person he said but when it comes to lining up of the word they'll never do it see understand that's why what a person says the Holy Ghost listen friends the Holy Ghost is a necessity that is what brings you and I into the body are you with me but in the reason it brings you and I into the body is because of that real gift from God that lives within our life that's soul that's why the Prophet would warn in things that are being talked about things that we enjoy and that we like we like mountains some of us like mountains someone was like playing some of us like this something like that and brother Graham talks about how that God would so lay those things out knowing what we like what we would desire he said but all those things are temporal and that's where he could say in that same message he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a temporal gift if powerful huh he wasn't making light of a Holy Ghost he's showing as he goes on to say that the real gift is that soul that come from God because the Holy Ghost is sent to quicken and raise up that purpose that was purposed in God from before the foundation of the world this is why this is why friends that we we understand that the life of the Holy Spirit the working of the Holy Spirit in our life that of the word of redemption is not a demonstration it's an action it's not something that just here and there that shown no no it's a living action brother Ram goes on to say here he says for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we're still here but we're not in the world as far as in that nature we couldn't be recognized the sons and daughters of God yeah we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and here this and because your sons God had sent forth his spirit and into your hearts whereby you cry father father upon whom did the spirit fall at Pentecost sons at Corinth upon sons while they heard the word he said so what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it's the Spirit of God coming remember here he is revealing his name by way of his word it is the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water has an answer of a good conscience toward God so God makes away that through the shedding of the blood the price is paid for now the life that was within that blood cell is loosed now is the issuance of a preaching of the acceptable year of the Lord it begins to sound and declare not something that is coming but now it is sounding what has taken place and delet you and I know we are a part of that we are the reason and here to think of it as a son of God I want you to just to think of this for a moment as a son and daughter of God we can look at that all as a son always a daughter but there has to be something that brings you and I to the realization of who it can't be anything that's strange think back to some weeks ago a month ago we were dealing with that on the sheet jesus said my sheep they know my voice and a stranger they will not follow say they know my voice what is his voice his word how do they know because he's the Shepherd that the Sheep always why sheep so it can't be something strange but you get that sheep on familiar grounds and the sheep will recognize who it is before that time it's walking in amnesia think about them boys who were on the train that from the battle battle that started in heaven fell upon human beings they were from that battle they were being escorted to an asylum see they weren't they will say a request that was made known and they were letting parents know your boys that some of your boys that if they're missing you haven't heard from them and so forth they're headed to the asylum and you had parents the Prophet dramatized it how you had parents that we're riding in to try to claim and looking different descriptions of their sons but here when that train stopped all of those soldiers got off of that train but in that stop something happened we're one of those soldiers who was on that train bound for the asylum but when he got off of there he started to look and it started to consider things around him what was it it was his surroundings he began to look at the trees then he begin to look at that water tower and the man who was there gliding him because they had to watch and they could go off astray but the man who was there watching him he started watching this young man and this young man started walking and he took a trail the guard did not show him that trail he got into a familiar place and when he got in that familiar place his amnesia started to live from him and he started walking over this hill what was it it was familiar territory and as he was walking in this ground it was leaving him and then that that guard he saw where that soldier here it is a father was sitting on the porch and that father runs out and embraced that son and said they told me you were there but son I knew you weren't dead what was that it was a familiar place that brought me amnesia who ever intended something that God in himself where his presence by his word heaven itself heavenly places sets down right amongst believers and what does it do it is a familiar place bill you may not be able to explain it but you recognize this this is where something begins to take hold and nisha breaks away hallelujah a water tower a familiar place so God would deliver his word to our lives so this word when you think of how that that water tower and those things think of that in terms of how Paul speaks of the gospel the gospel of your salvation after having heard you believed and second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 you see because we need the word to come to us is that right the word always comes to the predestiny we need the word to come to us right Paul says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God had from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth we are believing this morning because we were chosen to believe understand this choosing is not a making you this choosing is simply conferring who you are it's not all of a sudden God saying now you're going to believe you were chosen in him Amen now you are chosen to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit so the word itself the Spirit of God coming to bring a real purification a real sanctification the revealing of the truth as the truth comes in our mist it deals with the heart where a person could say that's the truth then follows into repentance there right now listen friends he could take a break and take a process of time but it can also happen in just one moment all things things hallelujah sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth where until he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ so the gospel sounding pause letting you know not another gospel not just any gospel or do not just any Jesus will do hey man it's got to be not imagination not an imaginary Jesus but a real true living Jesus he meant the real true living atonement that's the real gospel of Jesus Christ amen that has been sounded down through the ages and polar's letting it be known that you were called you who were chosen to this have been called by our gospel what is that gospel the gospel is the word preached in power and demonstration could already be to God to uh to the obtaining of the glory the honor of the Lord Jesus Christ Peter says in first Peter chapter 1 verse 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia strangers sure we are pilgrims and strangers we're not of this world Peters Linden been no new strangers that were scattered abroad verse to elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit under obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ let me say this very clear election will always declare itself in the presence of the word it will always manifest submission in the word when you had those who after they had heard the word here when Peter spoke in the house of Cornelius they had received the Holy Ghost but remember when it was made known to them of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ even though they were already filled with the Spirit of God showing they were in let and that seed was quickly they were in full submission to the word because the Lamb of God Himself was in full submission so the Lambs of the Lamb book are in full submission it select for this the election elected to the word elected to the placement in John chapter 1 verse 9 the Lord Jesus says this was the true light here which lighteth every man that cometh into the world lieth so man need to be lit so the first verse itself is not the lighting you must be lit but not just lit with a man-made fire it's gotta be a holy it's gotta be that light which is himself he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name let me deal with the scripture here just a little bit this word powers that of the authority that of power that of jurisdiction to give to you what rightfully belongs to you and one time your life was being ruled as Paul portrays this is Ephesians Titus so forth that we were walking under the Prince of power of the air the motions of sin worked in our members we were dominated by that first nature we were and yet within us residing within us there was an authority but it was not authority that had been quickened it had not come to light yet within us a jurisdiction is is laying there but there had to be something one who would bring forth what was resting there the whole time and not just bring it forth but that you and I would know there the whole time it was always a son and daughter of God what is it coming into it's coming to that and moving in that real identity of who you really are [Music] listen friends is just as it just as simple that sin as sin can rule over a life but when God has moved in and lift life up sin no longer is your ruler you become the master it's no longer a nature that's ruling you and you're under it being moved along but now it is a reality of a jurisdiction as a son and daughter of God that hey this is my possession this is who I am [Music] my to them but as many as received him these are not just an idea of him this this will not bring transforming power but to receive him the person itzá recognize him in his day of visitation remember the probably takes us back to Luther's time and he talks about how much word was spoken in that hour of the word itself if the word would have been taken in of what it would have done within the people's lives he said but many were not hearing it in before practical out working they were hearing the word in an academic manner they were just hearing it in a matter of I agree with Samson this and they were hearing it and they were debating and arguing and holding others in contempt and everything else it was not for practical outworking let me tell you something when the word is coming forth whether I'm sitting here I'm listening at home and reading in the scriptures that word is coming forth for me I don't want to be in a state to where I know this I know that I know this listen friends there's many tapes I could finish the paragraphs go high know exactly where the prophets voice will go that's not what we're talking about you can get that from listening to it many times but it's never cease we're God's help we'll move down in our days that stand up out of that message and God speaks and delivers in that time when you think where this [Applause] it's not us listening to the word in an academic manner it's for practical out working and the only way it can be for practical out working it must be submission to them gave he power to become the sons of God I love this word become this word become means come to pass it means to be fulfilled it means to arise it means to be married to this word become means to cause to be gene paraded that's how the definition is you say you're putting this and no I'm not I'm just reading a definition given to me that is to be come into being it's to be come into existence begin to be begin to be received being to come to be come to come to pass happen to arrive come on the stage none of these things they just they disconnect right out to be made to be finished to be performed to be wrong so when the scripture says but as many as received him to them gave he the authority to become or come to pass the sons of God to be fulfilled the sons of God to come into being the sons of God glory be to God hallelujah this word become that is used here it's the same word that's used throughout the New Testament when it speaks of things being fulfilled and I would speak in there and I'm just gonna skip over these things but many of the places in the scripture where it would speak about that this was done that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the Prophet this same word that's the word that you've become all of these things were done that it might be fulfilled let me say this to you the message that God in this hour it has called that it might be fulfilled and that you and I might come to pass that is late here and been wrote for this talent and the Holy Spirit has sweep over our life that you and I might come to pass that what God has spoken concerning you and I what he thought hook you and I might be fulfilled in us that they come come to pass the very next word that holds this meaning the very next scripture which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God here it is verse 14 and the Word was become flesh was made flesh that very word it would come to pass that word that was spoken is now come to pass the word that was now backward in flesh that word has become light in our lives no longer aware that we're waiting on listen friends we're not waiting on prophecy there are things that God will fulfill in his own time but remember in this hour the Prophet cautioned when he stood there and what is the attraction on the mouth and the whole time the Spirit of God moving through the Prophet to cause the people's attention to look away to Jesus not become centered and focused on him as a person but be focused on him who is standing in our midst Jesus Christ the Son of man why because the Son of man has come to take his bride hey Maddie come to unite with her in a union so his whole part was I must decrease that he might increase hey man as I said my ministry in spoken words original see as it would be standing there and declaring behold here he comes the Lamb of God see a prophet identifies the Word of God the presence of God on earth in that time God as a spokesman to catch what is taking place and as that were coming in God's order what happens a vision a reality it begins to move upon the people and what takes place what starts as a prophecy now comes to pass see if we make the message about brother Branham then everything is there and it's still prophecy this message is not prophecy it's become fulfillment it is being fulfilled in our lives even as we speak because the one who spoke it is here fulfilling it that's where the scripture when it when when the Lord Jesus picks up in the book of Matthew and he speaks about that stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is the Lord's doing fulfilled come to pass it's God is bringing his word to pass this is where the Prophet could say it has changed from the Prophet to his prophecy our focus is there in that of the prophecy a man who lives that prophecy that's Christ who read that prophecy its Christ in you Christ in me [Music] Alleluia this message is not a calling together to get a church this message is a calling together to make a people gathered unto Him for his namesake it's the finishing of all Redemption a menace of canonization it's that final move of God coming right among the Gentiles to call out of people for his namesake but that Junction look how things are transitioned over the times and how that God honing right in now on a group of people the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the message God who is rich in mercy my the prophet said I believe that a man when he's born into this world when you're a little baby born into the world you could not have been here without being the foreknowledge of God because he is infinite and he knows all things when that little baby is born into the world there is something in that baby if he is ever going to have life there is something in there in that child then that he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him something we come to say brother Samuel I read I read the scriptures and that seed came in that's contrary to the word the seed you didn't do anything you didn't do it you didn't do anything for that seed that seed is placed within you it was already from God's mind there was already a body a celestial body there and here God deposits that seed that matches a representation over there that matches what was in his mind and that seed is placed there from there as you come into this world a little somatic it's resting there the whole time yes sir in the message Easter seal then when the Holy Spirit come and you're on earth and listen friends I could just refer to many of these places here and there's a lot of things I do but I want to read these things to you because this is not my ideas this is the truth of election this is the truth of who and you you and I really are what this does is take it out of your hands and out of my hands and it brings us to the realization of whose hands it's always been and if it's all if it's always been in good hands with him didn't mean it to come out like that but it did that's blessed assurance right there then when the Holy Spirit come and you're here on earth walking around here as a sinner but way down in your lives there is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry you don't know what's taking place but you're as you're hungry there's got to be something that can satisfy there's got to be something that can quench this hunger this longing that I have no he said I heard that presbyterian brother the baptist talking back there are free will Baptists preaching all my fellow brother he said there's something in you something that you never put in there it's something that you couldn't desire to be in there why cause it's contrary to your first nature contrary it's something that's contrary to your own nature it's the foreknowledge of God taking place God's Word when the prodigal son was down there in the Pigpen before he ever left the Pigpen he was always the son but here was the age of the Lord begin to deal with his heart and he begins to consider going back home what's happening the foreknowledge of God is taking place just let me still down in the Pigpen but there has to be something that stirs him up that's why the preaching of the gospel you know that isn't just something that happens by osmosis but God has chosen to save through the foolishness of preaching Amen it's a word oh my what is it it's just as God Himself did in the beginning he stood back and spoke his word and believed his a word amen it's God within your app raising up and catching it yep that's me that's me that's me let me tell you friends the Word of God the message that God has sent us it is not about do's and don'ts I believe if we have the doer on the inside we'll do the things we ought to and we won't do the things we should and I believe if we do do the things we should not believe the doer and the inside will help us do the things and correct those things that we did wrong cause we got the doer on the inside some you have to replay that one to find them but he says if we look here of how that the Holy Spirit would seek us out let me let me move on from that quote in Ephesians 5:8 the scripture says for ye were sometimes darkness but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of light at one time darkness but now are you light what's happened he has come to light you up has to be substance there to light up substance that we'll be able to take that that light as it's coming in and be able to reflect it the prophets were reflectors is that right they they were they were ordained to catch what was taking place in that time and reflected down to the children of God who were in that time in that hour and the children of God the elect of God have was in the ability to catch that and will reflect Jesus Christ not reflecting ourselves is reflecting this is where the scripture could say in Isaiah 60 it says arise and shine a right come to pass be fulfilled arise shine for thine light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen that light to light you and I are where the world itself passes away and here where there's a birth that takes place on the inside where this right here the message the word is no longer it's not just words it's not just do's and don'ts it's not just but it's a love affair it struck your heart where your whole desire is Lord at all cost and everything Lord Lord Jesus I want you to be the center of Troy you recognize him for me he really yes let me let me move here let me move on down here go down to that message communion towards the latter part then let's give some places the RAM says here it says our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to there's been a change that has taken place within our life he says like in the book here the spot we were talking about the two books being worn the first book of life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life he says I was explaining it to some sisters it's afternoon see there's a little grain of life laying down there that you wonder where did it come from what these strange things he says I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William Brannon well forty years ago the William Branham isn't the same one tonight if someone back there would say William Branham he was a rank rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham that first breath coming under that first breath as everyone was there has to come a change they Menon you can't bring that change I can't bring that change but the gospel the word sounds up the Holy Spirit coming out through the word brings that place to draw you and I to himself its yielding to him that he would perform what he already knows voices but in their in their nature I was a sinner in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature presence II predestinated was in there by God in the same body two nature's in there well I catered to the one as it grows a good has a baby data the first thing you know I become a liar I've become everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time the whole time that see that other nature was laying in there the whole time it was a long-lost relative you needed to be reacquainted to be free tonight glory be to God there's examples the Holy Spirit has had me pick out of the news from clear back at the first part of the year that we'll get to by God's grace but I'm just looking at here just the other day of Hallie this woman she begin to realize she said you know what I had two babies that were born to me I had two boys that were born and and she was she kept them you know for for for a little bit of their life they don't remember it but she had them for a little bit of her life and and then she had to give him up for adoption but she began to do inquiries and try to find and find out where these boys where are they at and so she begin to post different things through different forms of media Facebook and things and there was things posted out there about you know certain things like we lived in this location and all these other little things trying to put little fillers out and then have DNA testing done and there was a man that he hadn't to be looking at this you know and for him he's looking at things himself and and and he knows there's something about his life he was adopted he knows that he knows that but he doesn't know who his parent is so he begins to reach out and whatever the sites that they haven't and he has a DNA testing that's done and here comes a match of DNA that's made and then the contact is made and sure enough not only is a DNA MMA match but everything else lines up and here Sarah's are reacquainting after 57 years here they are reunited or let me tell you when the Holy Spirit comes down by Leila's word it's God's seeking to reunite and their being a reuniting that you and I would reunite with another nature that real you and I who's on the inside that he would be raised up that real son and daughter of God that we would recognize who we are we're not Church members we are the bride of Jesus friend we are sons and daughters of God [Applause] Maddi blog placed in this word for the salary became sensing he came to seek you and I listened there must be a DNA match there must be a match there must be the world must see the word Amen it must be the wife that's already residing there and the word that comes on the scene in this hour it's a DNA match that's why the Bride of Christ and this hour could not be born again under a loser messenger Wesley message of Pentecostal message it takes a bad message of the fullness of Jesus Christ coming in this our DNA yes upon earth in this hour Alleluia it's the inspiration of God poured out but the Prophet he goes on to say he said I think of how many times I would be out there in the summer time he said I'd be out there I'd get my sticks and put them down for a little windbreak where if it rained and lay there and have the pole sticking in the water fishing mild dog laying there I'd say lookee here you know last winter I camped right here one night I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to treat I had a fire here it was froze five inches deep in the ground but little flour where did you come from well and where did you come from who come out here and planted you what hothouse did they bring you out of what about where'd you come from see that little flower I'd say why he was froze everything I I built a fire on top of there besides the freezing element there was a heat element laying there on a big old log where I burned you and here you are and you're alive where'd you come there was a lot of fires that was on this lot of fires black coldness but beneath fair there was a flower beneath there was a lily beneath all the mud and the gum and everything else packed into us was a lily glory be to God I real Lily ordained for the light and what the light does the light comes across that lily it's down there beneath the pond the light comes up that Lily starts growing towards the light what's it doing its pressing its way to overcome how by the strength of the light the light is giving it the authority to say it's time all right it's time come to pass it's time be fulfilled the light is giving the authority to that Lily to come forth and that Lily presses right through all the mud all the muck all the gum it pushes and pushes through all of that until it sets on top of the water it began way down deep but it sets on top of the water and it gives forth its radiance it was that all the time but the light gave it a thority to come forth that's what the Holy Ghost dogs it gives you authority to live as a son and daughter of God it gives you authority to stand there on your land and say I don't have to live this way any longer it's a gospel it's a word that sounds to you and say I don't have to be under this any longer then let you know there is Liberty glory be to God and after you're walking in Liberty it makes you aware of your jurisdiction all the grounds that belong to you every promise belongs to you all the grounds are given to us as the believers oh he said what was it I'm closing what was it there was another William Branham in a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the Word of God that was placed in there he said each one of you can think of those similar things let me just finish it out he says I look up at the trees and I think leaf I saw you fall off last year why are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here I see it was that eternal life working in the body then one day as I walked on that voice talking he'll never smoke drink so forth and the young fellows and all got order see there was something moving you see that's why even in your life you find a separation in your life you find separation from things that you wants to walk with and things that you once were inclined with things begin to they begin to lose it begins to lose its interest what is it it's God moving it's gone moving God bringing forth his sons and daughters listen Church there's never been a church there's never been a pastor a proper sofa or whatever that gave birth to sons and daughters of God but the Shepherd himself he's always on duty when they use art with lamps amen he is always the one by one spirit we are baptized into one body he's the one coming through that word listen he'll use a preacher he use a prophet he'll use a minister you'll use things listen God can you he'll use nature what will the nature do the nature itself doesn't bring the birth the nature only brings the realization to there is a living God he is he is true he is real he's the Living God and I want to give my life what's it it's all him drawing you and me into submission yes he says but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham there's something calling he said like my little eagle I'm not a chicken I'm not a chicken there's something Abhyanga somewhere we're great eagle whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it begin that seed that life that was always there now when the life of the word comes upon it it brings that seed that was that mystery in your life is revealed by the mystery of God coming in and the mystery of God comings in reveals to you and I is Christ in us no longer the same people that little life was laying there the light with water poured upon it begin to grow that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgiveness to never be remembered against me now we stand justified as though we had never sinned in the presence of God always was laying there I tell you friends this is why the word itself as it comes forth here within this hour it's a deal with our lives let me just I say this very very firmly the word itself God's purpose and God's desire is not that we would just come to church leave out of church come back we just kind of go through life God's desires that you would have victory in your that it's not something that you have to do but it's a love affair outside it's what you live for you live for him day in and day out your desire is to please him not to please yourself that life moves to raise you up it's only him that can separate and bring that separation only him that can bring that reuniting with that other nature that real you on the inside I say this morning that he is able he is able to do and perform his word just exactly what he said and bring it to pass in our life let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus sometimes the Lord I just feel like the Lord the word it comes out Lord just so chopped-up Lord and all over the place it's not on your account Lord I look at myself the Father I pray that Lord that the fault the word itself alone would strike Lord each of our hearts Lord that he would bring comfort Lord to our lives as children of God but I pray that it would bring conviction Lord to hearts and lives God to realize more that there is a deeper life Lord I pray that God that he would stir within each of our hearts because even Lord as we can look Lord in our lives and for those Lord those of us law that is passed from death unto life Oh God may Our Lives Lord truly be lived with conviction like that Lord of that young man who was in the field he was Lord he was operating in that field with conviction when the rest Lord would look upon him Lord and see his life Lord yet it was with conviction Lord and he was moving Lord it was a character Lord that stood out from all the rest not something than Lord that he had to do but it's because he recognized who he was recognized who he was but knowing who his father was and lord I pray that Oh God for every heart and for each life nor that's gathered or Jesus I pray that God that there would be life Lord raised up Lord father eaning Lord that's still within their lives Lord it seems like that things Lord that just cannot be overcome they look at their life Lord fine I'm not able to step beyond this but Lord may Lord they look to you look to you fully Lord and fully giving themselves to you and say Lord cause to come to pass in my life Lord I want to cement Faline would help me Lord to fully submit Lord help me Lord that what is there was in Lord God that he would come forth Lord that it's it's no longer Lord my struggle but it's yielding lord I pray Heavenly Father grant that this morning Lord for each life Lord knowing that it's your word as it comes forth Lord God lets us know who we are I pray Heavenly Father that you will just Nord have your way here Lord to give strength give encouragement Lord God to the hearts Lord of your children Lord we certainly don't count Lord ourselves Lord to be worthy and we certainly know that the Lord God it's nothing that we put there but father it's you moving Lord upon our lives to bring forth what you have sown there father may God in our lives lord as we Lord staying under that word bringing forth from our life Lord as we will grow into that stature of a perfect man granite Lord father we give ourselves to You Lord I pray Lord granite Lord this morning Lord let your word Lord may it Lord have free course in our hearts Lord may it rain Lord in our lives granite Lord Jesus I pray Lord if there's one that doesn't know you Lord in that way Lord my heart Lord desires Lord that they would know you Lord in that reality Lord in their life I pray God that they would just surrender Lord to that call and allow you or to make out of them what only you can do Lord your word is a sounding it's a call Lord to let it be known that there's liberty Lord there's liberty granted Lord a parade may you search out Lord God each and every heart in every life or we just give ourselves to you now know the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] three [Music] [Applause] my [Music] ah [Music] from the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] born again born again there's really been a change in me born again there's really been a change in me amen Oh ain't that wonderful it brings a change down on the inside the desire it's completely changes our life has changed Oh God [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah I don't know yet so true so clear the real truth what tells you and I that we have been born again is the identity we find in the Word of God the message clearly reveals to us the real birth it lets you and I know that real true reality now listen friends a person could say I felt this or I felt that those are all wonderful things but everything else after it's the life that follows because remember the Prophet Lee that are very clear in the hour that we're standing in the Holy Spirit comes with a plummet in his hand a plumb line it measures all of Jerusalem to see everything isn't up to the standard of where it needs to be and the Prophet when he makes that declaration he says what has caused all the confusion he says the reason is his experiences he's not saying that you don't need an experience but he's saying all these experiences he said but let us come back to the word as our plumb because the word will always declare a true experience after Paul look after what happened to Paul Paul didn't know what it what had taken place he knew he had met Jesus but here he went into the desert three years and he looked into the word I hope you're hearing me those things of God helps me to tarry on there's a lot of things I've already been studying before the Philippines on these things if you look into it don't look and look at your thoughts of yourself don't look at your wanderings what do I do look into the world the word tells you the word reveals to you who you are the word gives you solid ground to put your feet upon is that right Paul looked into the word and what Paul looked into the word Paul said that experience was of God and when he knew that experience was of God Paul went running so don't be entertained with your thoughts look into the word remember the Prophet said concerning his jacket he said my jacket doesn't match my pants he said but there's one thing that I'm glad that does match my experience matches the word that's what's important our experience matches the word and you know what your experience is your experience my experience is my experience but in each of those that true experience brings us in to the body of Jesus Christ nobody taught it into us nobody schooled it into it in that wonderful God seeking you and I out and so when the word is dealing with your heart even as I said is it dealing with a loved one allow God that word is sitting under that word and the presence of that word and that life sometimes you can't even get a word in maybe with loved ones but you know what you are the light jesus said you are the light the light has come to light you up you are the light of this age the prophets that your duty is to express God he said the church you're setting it is - it is for you - your duty to express God it's your duty to express God in your neighborhood your duty to express God on your job you are the light is that right it's the expression sometimes it's not what we say it's our life let let let that light burn so bright that all the people see is the light and they don't see me that's my design Lord let it not be me I want him to see you is that right I don't want to see the jeans of browning I want to see the gene of God amen and the genes of browning I want those genes are browning I can't wait so there's a change there right the old sticky Kaka bro part that it's still there but thanks be to God there's a hidden power a strength on the inside I reach in here even just keep on rolling for these things amen I trust that the Word of God I trust that the word has been an enrichment to your life I trust the Friends of God strengthens you in your life and you walk maybe you walked in here discouraged you walked in with something in your life but you walk uneasy wait a minute this is my jurisdiction yeah I have authority as a son and daughter of God I don't have to lay underneath this this has no part in this ground so thankful to see mr. Shirley [Applause] also it doesn't remind you I've been sending up the text is much just trying to send it out as much as I could regarding sister Elizabeth Collins and I didn't I don't we have an update rather Chuck keeps sending me things quite frequently I don't have an update as of right now this this morning but you know it's just it's been like a rollercoaster there's been things that even after we left out of your prayer meeting on Tuesday night I no sooner made it to my car on Tuesday night at a prayer meeting and I received the text and and it was things to where the doctors had just given up hope and the doctors the one we're not gonna take the case and we're not gonna do this you know it's just those things if humanly it would be a safe place for us to entertain that but you know what there's something there of how that God gives us the strength to look beyond that to know that and all these things God it's in his hands the doctors we don't we were thankful thankful to God for the doctors they've done all they can do yeah they're doing all they can do they they wouldn't want to see her die or I want to pass on but you know it's it's always been and it is in God's hands so I'm just asking you whether you know the text comes out or not I just I send it a lot of times it's brother Chuck will relay things to me that keep sister Elizabeth Collins in your prayers I want you to forgive me I just had something on my heart and it was been burned on my heart to get up give a little testimony and sing I I I didn't do it and I'm sorry but I want to share something with you that I was thinking about this morning it I'd shared with her brother out in the parking lot and there's thinking back of before I was becoming Christian before God changed my life I was thinking about going down the road over there and urine on my old Harley Davidson and I wasn't good shape and I wasn't even holding on to the handlebars and that was one of those I let go it just kept going it didn't back off but I think of all those things that we each could of the grace of God in our life if I'd hit a bump I might not have been here talking to you but the grace of God and it's mercy and then you know one day he moved us from here and over to Bayview and he began to deal with my heart and I didn't know what was God but I told surely won't even honey turn off the television it's turned off on a sweeter Bible there was something in there from a child my family was Pentecostal dad was a preacher but he had strayed there was something that they had said that I would read my Bible and you know but I didn't know him but there was something that said it stuck with me it said before Jesus comes there'll be squishes it has to be fulfilled so God was pulling but I couldn't stop drinking and smoking I I just I would try I couldn't do it but I went down I would went down to Virginia I my sister and then they God had already brought him into this message and and they were saying you know God sent a prophet that's all over sure and they said talking through and I said would you like to hear some how it and I said okay and they put a message on and it was this day the Scriptures fulfilled that caught my heart that sounded real and I begin to listen and and you know as I listened and it come to the last and that discernment I said that's God that's real that man couldn't be doing it he couldn't know that God has to be showing him that and you know right then God took drinking and smoking out of my life he just tuck it away you know what they just did it and from there on he began to walk with me and deal in my life and I just I know all of you has a testimony but I just wanted to share that with me I'm sorry God forgive me it was on my heart and I didn't do it or Jesus calmly Lord we just thank you with all our beings Lord where would we be without you Lord it's lost and undone with no way Lord but old Father in your love and grace you might away and Lord Jesus you came down for you know Lord if you had little sheep here Lord only you could come and redeem us Lord and it was lovely grace that compiled Jesus and each one of us Lord as you spoke to us o the Lord that sounded right it was a call from heaven something that like your servant said it sounded from deep within us and how we thank you Father and Lord to say this word that you've spoken
