it's good to be gathered together once again and it's always a privilege to come to the house of the Lord amen it's uh it's it's just a privilege that God has given to us and it's what's in our hearts amen our hearts we know that there's always something God is going to do something very special because he always keeps his word he said where two or three agree or two or three are assembled together in my name I'll be in their midst and then he placed to us he said for us not to forsake to assemble ourselves together amen place it upon us that we might demonstrate and show our faith that Lord I'm coming to have a meeting with you amen and God is always faithful amen how many witnesses are that God is faithful amen I tell you God is faithful to his word amen we just are just so thankful to be here this morning so glad to have um sister Rebecca and Nathaniel and and Ruthie here with us and um glad to have them came up and to be with us and visit with us and brother Nathan just finished his sixth service in four days so he just finished and he's in Finland you pray for him as he'll be he'll be traveling back home and so we just so appreciate having them amen here with us and um we're so glad to have brother George here with us as well amen and uh you know we were we were talking there just a little bit I made a comment to brother George in the back office I said you know I said there's not too many I I don't I don't know how many of living witnesses as far as that was right there with the prophet how many that are still remaining I know they're few and then he asked me he said do you can you name them I said no I don't know all of them that would still be remaining but there's not that many but you know one thing about it this is a privilege um that for brother George I've appreciate brother George his balance Amen on the word of God and um and with it all I appreciate God God gives us um these examples in this way and there's just certain little insights to me um even over the years not only from Brother George's testimony but um my when uh our path crossed with the Bryants and and we just become real good friends and then down there my the testimonies that was shared and things that uh different ones would share with you I so appreciate those testimonies uh I appreciate it just like I appreciate being able to go to different places and actually see the things I no longer have to imagine and what brother Bram was talking about with the bubbling brook I drank from that Brook and so all of those places and and it's just it it's wonderful but you know let me just say it like this we could have all of these things we could have even rubbed shoulders with brother brandham but if we missed what the message was all about and it was about a real relationship with Jesus Christ then we missed it all that was the purpose and you know God God used the vessel it was the prophet it was ordained in this hour God God kept his word it had to be a prophet the word comes to the prophet to restore it and then through that through the life and Ministry of brother brandham God showed himself he was a character that was on display that's not elevating a man that's just remembering God showed himself he made himself known and now that same God is veiled in the bride body of Jesus Christ it's God living in his people amen sister Doris God bless you man so good to see you amen I tell you amen that's a real answer to prayer amen so we're so thankful to have our sister here with us amen you continue to remember her in prayer and I know I know different ones that are here uh this morning and from the week and previous weeks there's been battling with sickness and I know some that that aren't here today that are and um but I'm thankful to know that God is faithful Amen to heal us amen by his stripes we're healed so we don't want to take any further time we want to just invite brother George and um just that brother George just have his Liberty here this morning amen let's just sing a song um let's sing the song only believe amen can we sing that song only believe oh believe oh that all [Applause] [Music] things yes Lord [Music] only and all be come on [Music] that all things [Music] are and Lord I yes Lord I believe all things are possible yes Lord I be oh Lord I yes Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I might let us pray Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be in your presence this morning we thank you Lord for the songs of Zion Lord for the music we thank you for all your blessings you've been so good to us individually corporately you've been so good to us thank you thank you now for your word thank you for the the things that you've given me to say here we pray that you it would be a blessing to somebody that somebody could gather strength for the journey help us in Jesus name amen thank you very much so we're back in Ohio again this morning am it's good to be here and you all need to be very thankful for the pastor that God's given you yeah don't take him for granted there's only a few people on the planet that um we could say are balanced some are going one way or another way you know some don't have anything to say but God has been good to you and the other thing I like about him is that he's not afraid to Branch out and have some of the other four ministers to come in to speak I've been a lot of places I know you got your story but we got people that I'm the only one that can say it right yeah that's not it's not scripture sorry so I'm here for three reasons that'll be all the music I'm not going to sing we've got singers why would I want to try that um like I say three reasons one of them is a brother Browning you know he every time I see him when you coming by when you coming by well see when somebody invites me that's already 51% of the formula already because we believe they know what they're talking about so the other reason is I felt inspired to come now I could be someplace else but you know there's only 52 Sundays in the year and it's not always good weather in Ohio but um third reason now I don't know about you but um I don't dream a lot when I do dream by the time the coffee's hot well dream's gone but God does deal in dreams and I've got a couple of friends that they dream and then they tell me and that encourages me so this one brother um he called me one one day and he said man I just woke up and I had this this dream and I said well tell me about it so the dream is that he was in uh brother brandom's living room there in Jeffersonville and uh like a fly on the wall and he's seeing what's going on and so in this um in this scene uh he said that he said you and Rebecca were sitting by the fireplace and over here in the chairs was uh brother Neville and sister brandham and they were talking okay they talked for a while they were talking about current things not back then but now and so then brother Nimble got up to leave and he's going toward the door okay he let in March of 74 and then sister randam got up to see him out uh she was called Home in May of 81 so they're by the door and um and then they looked over to Rebecca hey come here so now the three of them are over there well she left in November 0 6 it's another dimension I'm still sitting by the fireplace and they looked back at me and they said you keep doing what you're doing so I'm going to keep going and uh there's no lack of places to go last Sunday I was in the southern jungles of Mexico as far as you can see is green probably a lot of snakes out there you know who knows what all is out there but um we had some meetings had a wedding last Sunday and then got home Monday night so we just keep going and there's other places to go but uh I'm not an Entertainer I'm just trying to be a faithful witness because like brother Browning pointed out there's only a few of us left and uh I'll be honest with you some of them aren't believable maybe they got too old I don't know but um we're trying to stay balanced and that's why I do carry a level with me to check on the pulpit first okay you pass the test but um you'd be surprised there's people out there quoting William Brandon and they're about like this oh yeah all these churches you came by to get here today they got big churches big programs got coffee got everything right same Bible but they're not balanced but they're part of the puzzle they're doing their part and so we want to look at the scriptures just briefly Acts chapter 1 and you don't have to turn to it but just listen closely Acts chapter 1 1: 6 when they were therefore gathered together so the people were gathered from uh the area with the resurrected Jesus and they had a political question who's going to be president are you going to do this wait a minute this is resurrected being you never seen one before and they asked him uh Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it's not for you guys to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both right here in Jerusalem over in Judea over in Samaria and to the uttermost part of the Earth all the way to Ohio it didn't come in a parachute people somebody had to come on a horse on a boat brought the gospel you you see so that's where we're going to start and it doesn't say anything about a judge nobody qualifies doesn't matter what your name is who your grandpa was nobody nobody's a judge you know and and nobody's a lawyer we're simply Witnesses so um I'm the eagle that was born in the Baptist chicken yard some of you were born in the Catholic yard and all kinds of things but God gathered us and here we are today God is faithful and so when we get to the other side and there's no clocks then I'll sit down and listen to your stories but today's my turn and so we must keep a balance in our Christian walk very very important especially here at the end time and you're going to hear things today that you haven't heard before but they'll all be true Lord willing um in our world today there's over 7,000 known languages not everybody speaks English and so many of these languages are only spoken they're not even written yet it's just a spoken language amongst a group of people and so we've got the Bible now translated into 700 of these languages and the New Testament is in 1500 of the languages is it sound okay back there okay um people have died literally burned out front to have the English Bible right yeah now this this Bible is the most important book you will ever own there's nothing like it in the world that's right nobody could sit down and write a new book Pope says he need we need a new book he doesn't know what he's talking about no we have God in printed form that's right because people have they've given their life they they've died for it yeah you see this book was written over a period of 1500 years by 40 different writers inspired by one author many of them didn't know each other didn't speak the same language and yet here it is all pointing to Jesus Christ Hallelujah a long time ago in 1944 my parents met in Bible School in California and they were married and and they agreed that they needed to go to Mexico to find this tribe of people that only had a spoken language they wanted to go down there and get started on making a dictionary and then the Gospel of John but that kind of work takes about 20 years or more back then today where computers might take a little less but I know that he didn't have that kind of patience and so he started that work and it it's not a matter of let's just fly in there they had no GPS they had nothing it back in the Dark Ages and so they were newly wedged didn't know any Spanish gotten their their military truck that they had purchased to go as far as the truck would go and uh they kind of knew where they had to go so then they hired these horses and they go on Horseback for four days into this area and and you know they camped out at night sounds really fun doesn't it well camping out to me is holiday and express clean sheets and hot water but anyway they go up there and they start finding these people and um and then what's going to happen in a newlyweds home well sooner or later there's a baby going to be born so they come out on the horses instead of going to Grandma's house in Arizona they got on the train and went to Mexico City where the headquarters was with the wickliff Bible translators and that's where their first child was born in late August of 1945 it was me so now you know and uh eventually I was the first of 10 children five boys and five girls okay so he he saw that this was going to be a very difficult task no computers paper and pencil and these people are saying something and you got to you got to make that word on paper somehow it sounds impossible it's still going on in many places well anyway he left out for somebody else and he went to the East Coast of Mexico uh near the gulf to uh start a Baptist work over there and he he founded a bible school where train ministers train Sunday school people it's still there today I've met people that have graduated from it it's been a real success and so that's where that I was put in into the elementary school and I had all the first sixth grades all Spanish I didn't learn about American history I learned about Mexican history you know so forth at home my mother was teaching us you know reading and things we needed to survive and um she had some very strict rules you can imagine growing family and so the one of the rules was that in the house you can speak English but outside you can speak Spanish you go mix them up that come in real Handy later uh that's why today when I meet some of you people that you know kind of mix it up it doesn't fly speak Spanish or speak English I know who you are so here I am in the in the first grade uh first American kid they'd ever seen and so back then we didn't have pencil sharpeners no everybody carried a single-edged razor blade to sharpen your pencil not to hurt each other and um so friend that you know kid I knew he got a very sharp point on his pencil and when I wasn't paying attention he jabbed me in the arm and so when he saw that I had red blood like him then we could be friends so there was my first battle scar well anyway uh we're we only have one service today everybody had a good breakfast right yeah so there's no hurry um Anyway by the time I was nine years old I missionaries kid front row every service no you know back then they didn't give kids choices no this is what we're doing you don't have any to say when you get 18 buy your own tickets you can make your own decision but anyway so here I am on the front row every service and by 9 years old I realized this gospel that I'm hearing every service isn't just for all these people it's for me too you know because you know the scripture says that all have sinned yeah all the brownings all the Smiths all the randoms all of them they all sin come short of the glory of God your name's not going to get you anywhere and so at 9 years old I I met the Lord Jesus was uh saved because you know the scripture says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord wherever you are what color you are doesn't matter and um then on Easter Sunday 1955 I was baptized in the Baptist Church and by the time I got out of the sixth grade my parents decided Well you have six grades in Spanish now these next six you're going to have in English I didn't get a vote so here I am 13 years old in Houston Texas with a family I never met before and that was my new life and um survive but um the um we had some other moves and by by the time 1962 comes along uh I was already a teenager and had another glorious experience with the Lord and they moved me up to live with my grandfather in Tucson Arizona because my mother was born and raised and died in Tucson Arizona so here I am in the uh 10th grade in Arizona and um I in this big school of 2 200 kids and so then when we get into the 11th grade uh I had I was a guy with a reputation no dances no drinking no smoking and my friends in the lunchroom was was uh the uh Mormon kids I andan they at least dressed right and speak a little bit of word with them you know and so anyway here I am in in high school and and uh so I remember one day this girl comes up to me and she says you know we know you're so picky but I know just a girl for you oh really well it turns out that that she had some new neighbors that had moved from Indiana and so she said yeah she's uh she's over there getting on the bus well the next day I met Rebecca brandom well now I'd never heard this name before completely new to me uh we didn't travel in those circles but sure enough most beautiful girl I'd ever seen and then she came from Southern Indiana and she had that that that accent well out there they don't talk like that so I was smitten right from the first day you know and there's no hope and and um so I met her you know the next day and um and so she said now you got to meet my dad my dad's preacher no problem I've seen a lot of preachers well see the miracle is God moved these people from Indiana 1 18800 miles and puts them a block and a half from my house I didn't have to travel many hours like some people I know now she was right there God has a way of doing things and so I'm very very thankful but anyway so I go to meet the man after school that next day and he's in the backyard no shirt on it's hot you know and I don't know what day it was so don't ask but could have been February or March somewhere in there uh probably February and so we're talking I come with a purpose I wanted to date his daughter and he's checking me out and you know we we're just two guys talking maybe 15 20 minutes well by the time we're finished I had the victory because I got permission but he had the problem because he had to tell the rest of the world this one's got a boyfriend back away they knew who he was and they were scared to go ask I didn't know who he was yeah and so um so anyway what I realized you know not too long later when I got to realize what it was all about he was scanning the hard drive that whole time yeah all the way out maybe till today and so you know I got the permission well at the time I was driving a um 5-year-old Ford pickup two door no air no stereos pick up three speeed and I found out that her she had an older brother I thought maybe we might have a problem here but her older brother was a little skinny guy like me and it didn't matter he had a nice red brand new red Chevy but the man himself drove a Ford station wagon so we got along just fine now when they moved to Arizona um it wasn't because of the weather it was because of a vision and they didn't know how long they were going to stay so they just brought their clothes and got an apartment and um at that point Rebecca had already had either nine or 10 years of classical piano training piano teacher was across the street and uh know same church same school same friends but uh now they moved to Arizona and there's no piano well a girl in 11th grade with no piano that she's been playing every day it could be a problem but she realized that the girl at the corner her mother was a piano teacher and she had grand piano so that's uh where she was spending some of her time and that's the girl that introduced us okay so you can hear some of this on tape some of it's filler that you haven't heard before but um so brother bram's getting the family together one evening to go to go to supper and he's only got three children he looks in the back and there's only two where's Rebecca well she's at the corner we'll pick her up on the way so he goes to the corner stops and he's going up to the door and he can hear the piano playing well yeah there's 20 fingers you know on this piano and it's not Bay Tolen it's not shopan it's not down at the cross either it's rock and roll you know yeah and so well Hearts break girl and so he bangs on the door and they heard him she comes to the door now he was a balanced man he didn't jerk his belt off what are you doing down here I'm beat the tar out of you no all he said it's time to go okay we go she didn't hear another word about it for two months but when he tells the story in August of 64 you know some of these details he said and just after that she met George and he's a Christian end of the problem yeah I was taking to the Baptist church every Sunday and he was thankful and he went with us sometimes so when you're on vacation I don't I don't want to hear those corny comments well there's no church I guess we'll have to stay at the beach no you can go in the Catholic church and get a slice of bread yeah you can go to church so God Is Watching yeah okay so early June of 63 is when I was in the first meeting now he didn't give me a big list you got to go home and listen to all these tapes you got to read these books no he he welcomed me he he could see through you know the veneer he he knew what was on the inside I was just a 17y old kid and so the first meeting was in early June of 63 and I'm seeing him in pulpit and he's saying things that are right out of the Bible can't can't fault him on what he's saying and here's God in action and so I remember going home that night and said Lord this is either something comes straight from you or it's your greatest deception ever hit the earth you know that was my first impression but God began to reveal you know this is the truth and uh brother Bram traveled a lot but when he was home he was very you know very gracious and we could sit down and talk about the scriptures and and different things and he was he was just like a father you it was very very kind we'd spent time together and so I was always welcome at their house so people asked me well what attracted you to this ministry well it wasn't sitting in the you know in the pews watching the preacher um the girl was the hook on you know the bait on the hook but uh but I always kept you know two separate things relationship with her and relationship with her dad and um the fact is when I I met William brandom i' already read my Bible through twice and if you haven't read your Bible through shame on you you got your your th telephone and in there there's a schedule that you can keep and you can read a little bit every day and by this time next year you read your whole Bible this man came by promise of God to turn your hearts back to the original amen not to burn candles no that's Catholic idolatry came to bring us back to the word and that's where the life is okay so when you read your Bible well there's a spirit of the scriptures and I can see that same spirit in him this the this matches I'd heard a lot of Baptist preachers and others but okay they're great in the Pulpit but go outside and it's a different story but here's a man that was living the word all the time so that's what attracted me to this and knowing that it was the same Spirit of the scriptures you know and even my mother me when I was growing up she taught us to read our Bible and pray okay then I run into William brandom how how how do I get closer to God read your Bible and pray oh yeah that's the only way you're going to get there okay so I'll give you a little glimpse into what I call the prophetic Dimension and that is that prophets speak from eternity that's why brother random could be here and he would see 500 people when there's really only 131 probably or less okay I didn't count but um it's like when when Elisha and his helper were in the house and he said now son go outside and see what's going on so he goes out there and all he can see was Soldiers with Spears oh he comes back trembling look what are we going to do all this problem now Elisha didn't take a stick and hit him he's put his hand on Lord open the young man's eyes so goes back out there oh Hills are full of angels huh where they come from they were there all the time it's another dimension you see it's just like brother Ram tries to explain it with uh with TV it's coming through here all the time there's 500 channels going through here and if you got a a machine you bring them down well it's another dimension so brother brandham was preaching in Houston Texas in 1950 in January and it was a u series of 10 services and so during this time there was a Baptist preacher that thought it was his call from God to denounce this it's all the devil it's no good because then and I don't know today but the Baptist theology was that healing was not in the atonement well how they doing this well must be the devil well anyway that was his that was his theory and so brother Bosworth was working with brother brandham he stand I look brother br we've got to do something this guy's causing a lot of trouble it's in the newspapers people are looking at us like we need to respond and so brother brandom said we're not going to waste one night on this one man when there's hundreds we got to pray for them we got a job to do you know so finally brother bradsworth convinced him they could do it very simply but it has to be done okay have at it I'm going to stay in the hotel you guys take care of it but holy ghost says no you will you know be there you got to go so he comes to service that night uh his brother random and his wife and his brother who was helping him and four-year-old Rebecca well this was a big night for her because for the first time she gets to sit with her dad in church all the other time he's up here and she sees the other little girls with her dad never happened to her well they're way up in the balcony where they can see and um found thousands of people and so um brother bonworth is down here you know managing this debate he said now now the noble esteemed brother um the seven compound names Redemptive names of Jehovah in the Old Testament can we apply those to Jesus Christ yes or no we can finish this well the Baptist was caught because if he says no Then it eliminates salvation If he if he says yes it incorporates heing oh hadn't thought of that so anyway you can hear all about that on tape and um the uh struggles they had but anyway it comes to an end now during this time there was a photographer two photographers over here from a famous Studio that the Baptist had hired because he wanted pictures because he was going to win and you know needed publication so they're taking pictures so um it comes to an end and brother Bosworth says now thousands people here I can't see but if brother brandom's in the audience somewhere he's welcome to come down and dismiss the audience so brother RM starts to get up out of his chair and his brother says don't you dare cause a riot and the wife says it's okay he knows what he's doing so he gets up puts Rebecca in his seat and she can see him coming down and so he says as I came down through that crowd thousands of sick people he said cases that would make the heart of an Iron Man melt you know and um he said so 500 ushers helped me to get to the pulpit okay because everybody won't touch him and so he comes down to the pulpit and he says a few words he says I don't need to say anymore because he's present and I dismissed the audience a few people saw the pillar fire most of them didn't but when the photographers developed the film that night this is the only picture that came out all the others were blank God is faithful now this picture's been around the world millions of times and brother BR says it's better if you have the picture than if the real thing came in the room because your eyes can't deceive you you know and so uh one one testimony is when he he was in a prayer line he had people lined up and this lady's carrying her picture she had bought out front and she's there to be prayed for and so he says oh I see you have one of the pictures he said let's talk about that for a minute he said on my desk at home I've got a testimony of where that a lady was in the hospital dying already given up and she had this picture on the staying beside her bread and her testimony was that the light the light came off the picture and came over her she got healed went home that's happened many times in our time now so it's very important and to the naysayers have a good day see at the Finish Line we're not going to argue we know what we believe and if if William brandom doesn't fulfill the the scripture of Matthew 17:12 then you go find it because Jesus said he's coming so you go find him let me know but we believe he fulfilled it okay so long time later whenever you know Rebecca was listening to the tape and she hears brother R tell this whole story she says to her mom now you were the only one there that I know did you see 500 ushers and the mother says no dear those weren't ushers those are angels that other dimension God watching how many times this past month of July was God looking after you you had no idea you could have got T-boned and killed or whatever God watches over his own every day so there's many other things that we could do um point out about this uh about this prophetic Dimension but just one in particular because I know it's controversial with some people um when brother Rand moved to Arizona January of 63 one of the first things he did was he had a had a Rolodex thing with Andes he sent out invitation to his people come to Jeron bill March 17 to 23rd there Seven Seals and so um he sent that invitation out okay the Lord told him to do that well in the meantime um he always was in Arizona for the wild pig hunt since 1947 because that's something he liked to do it was that was the season for it it varied every year a little bit but uh he promised these two brothers will go okay well that particular year the season started on March 1st and then he gets a phone call and some of you Old-Timers might remember we used to have a radio program called um uh chaplain Ray it was a prison ministry and so this chaplain was a friend of brother brand so he called brother Brandon one day there in early 63 and he said now look um we've got a we've got a case over here in Houston where that there's these two kids they were involved in robbery last year somebody got killed so they put it on them and they're facing the death penalty here in Houston and the boy is a son to one of the two photographers from 1950 so there's a link he said would you please come and help us pray that they won't get the death penalty brother R said sure will he said if I don't go and they kill them I can never hunt again so he agreed to go well so those are the three things that are coming up and then he met me and that was another pressure but you know we survived that one um um so the uh the seals are for Jeffersonville March 17th so we're back up over here to the first of the month of March and um the um the first thing that comes up is he's promised these guys to go hunting which starts on the 1 but if you listen closely on tape he says first I went to Houston then I went hunting a that changes things well because the only place we have that the picture that's so famous that's gone around the world in the Life Magazine is dated February 28th okay naal National Geographic has paid photographers they've R the planet getting nice pictures Life Magazine prints pictures they send them so this man was out he took these pictures and he sent it in well uh that that'll come up a little later okay but for now he goes to Houston which is a thousand miles from Tucson prays for the you know in this prayer meeting it's on tape and then that night they get in the car and they go all the way back to Tucson to keep his word to the hunters Jeffersonville is over here the other way and so he figures he can go take care of that and then get over there by the 17th and so he gets back to Tucson changes clothes gets his rifle out and they go hunting and when he tells the story about the h hunting and the cloud and so forth he says I already had mine means I got it yesterday he says now we're the three of us at this fire that night and Visions are coming he's telling these guys about their families he says it got so heavy I just get to walk away couldn't take any longer the next day which would have been March the 8th they're out there hunting you know he already had his so he's trying to run these pigs over so those guys guys can get theirs and that's when the blast went off and so forth now he comes back with the brothers he never said did you see he said did you hear that okay yeah the blast well they had some words and took off preach at Jeffersonville so that's the short version of when and how the cloud appeared besides that it was a sign to him for him the angel simply said go back to Jeffersonville preach Seven Seals and when he's going to the bulit for the first service he stops at Billy's office and he says now look Billy if you ever prayed for daddy pray now I don't have any idea what I'm going to tell these people so the Angels didn't give them the big list they said go it'll be given to you as you need it same thing for us today he gives us what we need as we need it we don't need to know how deep the streets or gold are and all these details no just get there okay okay so we get to the end of 1963 and those of you that have been in love know that when your girlfriend goes away for a week or two but it seems like a whole year you know so I knew they were going to go to Jeffersonville preach you know Christmas and come back we'll be back in school in January but you know Thumper hair wouldn't let me alone so I hit the ride some other people and got there for uh Sunday morning December 29 first time in the brown Tabernacle wow you know and so between Services I go out to eat with the family and um brother Ram knew that Rebecca and I both were in in school you know choir music and he said I love George at the service tonight I want you to sing me the brandom Tabernacle he said yeah he said tonight we're going to have um we're going to have prayer l so it'd be good if you could sing then Jesus came well I never heard that song but I learned it and he was pleased and very pleased that his daughter played for the first time in the service and he came out and preached Look Away to Jesus well time passes and um we uh we graduated together in May of 1964 we got three hours to go remember and so this was a very proud day for William Brandon oh he said finally brandom was graduated big day in July of 64 he's preaching over here in Philadelphia and you know when you when you would go to the service with brother brandom um he didn't get here for the song service and the offering he'd get here in time to preach you know he's under the anointing so they drive to the service some big Auditorium there and so was brother brandom and Billy and Rebecca and her friend Betty before them they arrived well brother brandham had a had a seat they had a big long table brother or Roberts was speaking at the right as he walked in so he takes his seat over here and but there's no seat for the girls they found them two chairs up in them mes some so they could see and hear and so while brother Ram sitting there waiting his turn he reaches over and just barely touches the suit you know real careful and um so then he spoke that Mighty message the uh unveiling of the Mighty God and so then after service and they leaving Rebecca said I saw what you did touching his suit he said oh sis you wouldn't believe it was a fine fine suit well yeah probably $3,000 suit the man had to have the V you know and so brother R looked down at his own clothes didn't match it was you know off matching probably 3995 for the whole suit and um but the point is they're both called of God they both had a part of the puzzle but they were different you know God used them in different ways another place brother R tells about um he says now you want to see the the reason for the success of these meetings big meeting big you know uh curtain back here and he had him raised the curtain well back there behind the curtain old John Ryan the long long beard he's out there praying the whole time Prayer Changes Things brother rand's Ministry was not a push button Ministry I need I need I need he had to struggle the whole time you know well um I'll have to share a few things about the courtship um we couldn't have any dates during the week because we were in school you know and she had to in be in by 11:00 p.m. and so um so then we had church on Sunday so any I'm come I'm bringing Rebecca home and we live in this apartment and it's you know nothing fancy and so we're standing on the porch it's you know dark and all of a sudden the light comes on right here porch light boom 100 100 watts and and the door opens a little hand comes out if I put a quarter in the hand goes back in the light goes off H success yeah that was my brother-in-law's first experience of separating Believers from their cash and when I reminded him of that he tried to tell me you weren't even a believer at the time I said well your dad thought so anyway we had some experiences but um you know now at my house with a bunch of kids and everything we had a black phone on the wall with a dial kids don't know what they look like but uh and my dad of course being you know leader of the clan he said ' we have a democracy yeah I got the vote and so he said now the phone is for uh communication not for visiting oh had thought of that unless he needed to visit and then it was different you know so I had to you know figure out how to use the phone now see today we've got our our friend here everybody's got one some people have two but back then it was on the wall and so and she only lived a block and a half away but we still like to talk on the phone it's just the way it is but his house at brother Brandon's house they had just installed a new phone ours have been there for years well this is the new technology and it was push button but it was still a desk phone with the wire you know wasn't walkway phone and so people started calling him you know we should I buy the white car or the blue car well now if they ask Brother Sam who cares by whatever you want but but he was kind well he got tired of that you know so he's looking at the bottom of the phone and he's got a dial down there if you turn it one way ringer gets louder if you turn it the other way goes off what do you think he did turned it off so so if you're calling you can hear it ringing but you can't hear it over there because it's off so Rebecca says what are we going to do I said it's real simple said you set your your watch just like mine okay got it now when it's exactly 7:00 I'm going to call you thanks to your dad there's no ringer so you have to believe me so so sure enough 7 o'cl picks it up hello and then I had this long cord so she could take the phone and go in the closet we can have some privacy so love conquers all um so yeah so I had this clean pickup truck okay tried to keep it clean lived on dirt road but um but brother am had a Cadillac back then that was the luxury car of the time he didn't buy it somebody gave it to him so he had this 55 Fleetwood Cadillac about from here to the door had two four barrel carburetors you loved it big air conditioning very nice and sometimes he' you know let us use that and um but see his his car took the EXP expensive gas and there there was no self- pump you had to have the guy come out and do it and the Cadillac took the gas it was 36 Cents a gallon where my truck would take to 22 cents a gallon so we'd buy $2 at a time you know well anyway so I'm taking her to the Baptist Church he was happy that she was in church and um I don't ever remember taking her brother and her sister but took her and so here I'm in this this pickup truck uh you know two doors so there's me and Rebecca and my sister and in the back was my little brother and sisters you know and they um uh yeah open air no problem a long time ago some we used to drink out of a hose you know and so he would come out to tell us goodbye one time he comes out to say goodbye to us that he was home and he said my what a fine trunkload of preachers you have here I didn't see preachers I just saw little brothers you know sure enough they all going to Bible school they're all preachers today so God knows what he's doing yeah well um by the end of 64 God tells his Prophet now look you're going to stay here so you need to look for a house now he could have given him the address and go find it no he just said you go find a house so he starts looking and looking and he found a place where he could see the mountains very easily and they had space to build on din room that he wanted to put his guns and his trophies and everything in so he goes and makes a deal on his house so while he's making the deal the the Builder had almost finished it but he wanted to leave it so that the owner could you know trim it out the way they wanted so the the Builder standing outside and brother Ram standing in the doorway and they're talking uh about the house well in the meantime here's Joseph you know 8 years old and you know how little kids are they run their fingers every place and so he's running his finger up the the door jam and um he's about this far from the the lock you know from the hole and so brother ry's talking to this man without even flinching P pulls out his knife sticks it in a hole and brings out a scorpion this is is the way he lived because he he was a prophet well um so anyway they found the house so all of 65 they're finishing out this house and building the den room and the driveway and all the stuff some of you have been out there and seen it and um and so that's basically what was happening all 1965 well in May of' 65 I uh I U had this great idea you know I wasn't baptized right yet I didn't have a car yet I didn't have a job didn't have money didn't have a house I thought I needed a wife yeah I was you know like something and so I was brave enough to go talk to the man and so here again it's just me and him in the in the room and so he starts talking a little bit nervous kind of knew what I was there for no doubt and so he starts telling these trips and different things going on seem like went on for a long time and I said well brother R that's all beautiful but I'm here for a purpose oh what would that be I said well you must notice I really like your daughter yeah well I want your blessing and your your permission to marry well everything changed that eyes got real narrow and um he said well I'll tell you what I'll give youall permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism of the Holy Ghost wow and um I said yes sir now a smart person would have hit the floor okay what's step one you know tell me no life went on life went on that was May and um and then you know they go away again for about six weeks in in the summertime and I don't know how I got there but I ended up back to jville for two three weeks and I was there when he was preaching ano once the end time I was sitting from here to the piano he was all just going right over I was I was listening you know and what's the attraction on the mountain events made clear by prophecy and so forth so on on April on August 1st he preached uh morning and night and I knew that that week which would have been 59 years ago now I knew we were going to get in the station wagon and go to Jeffersonville so I said now look before we go will you have time to baptize me correctly oh sure well we had been waiting three years for that so Monday morning which would have been August the 2nd of 1965 we go down to the church and he uh here again no shirt just the way it was back then and there two or three people in the audience for for Witnesses and he baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was 59 years ago and uh that was the last person he baptized as far as I know well so now we're in Tucson and um so now I got the girl under contract got a car I got the baptism we're making progress you know so we're driving around in my car one day and he says man I really like this you know just me and my wife this' be good and he said and then out of nowhere it seemed like he said if you ever get a chance to go to the Holy Land your Bible will be a brand new book well that's interesting I wasn't thinking about Holy Land I was talking thinking about the girl you know and um so you know prophets they see what we can't see and so last June uh was trip number 48 so we've been there many times we know where not to stop where to stop but right now it's war and you would believe everywhere I go the last three weeks when are we going to go back to Israel they're having a war I don't know I guess people don't read the news but you know it's serious people getting killed over there no we're not going right now so if the Lord carries maybe someday soon but um anyway uh September of 65 brother R's preaching in Phoenix and so I took rebec and so I L her I let her out at the door this big hotel and I go to park the car well she comes in to the lobby of the hotel and you ladies know when you first get the ring it seems like that hand's Always Somewhere they're just like that and so she comes into this Lobby and here's her friend you know other lady standing in there and she sees the ring and she says is that what George gave you yeah but Rebecca he's Baptist you know and so Rebecca says yeah but daddy likes it well um also in September when brother R had the experience with the uh Sabino Canyon you know little squirrel jumped at him and hit the cactus and all that well we were we were there at that time I wasn't in Sao Canyon but I was at the house when he came back and he was very happy well it just so happened that brother green was in town from Texas because he his mother was a seamstress and she was she' made all the drapes for the new house so he was in town putting up the drapes you know getting things ready and so brother brandom said to him one day he said look looks like this guy's going to be my my son-in-law take him home and pray for the Holy Ghost why didn't brother B just put his hand on me know wasn't God's plan so anyway so here I go to um here I go to Texas with brother perie green and that's when I was introduced to humidity oh yeah Houston Texas August September and so I'm over there and um so I was there about two days and brother um another brother came over from Louisiana to use brother Green's phone to call brother brandom it's four times you know so he comes over brother Blair's his name so he calls him that day and brother Brandon's already out of the house he said but when he comes back we'll have him call you so they're wa they're sitting there waiting by the phone all day so I'm over in my room I come over and say what do we what if we just the three of us pray so we kneel down at the bench we're praying they're not beating on my back they knew why I was there I didn't know why I was there I just knew it'd be good idea if the three of us praying and so while we're praying uh I could still see in my mind just like a cloudy Sky when there's breaks in the clouds and these shafts of light come through you know and um so about then the phone rings so brother green goes answerers phone and was brother random calling for the other brother but he said first let me talk to George so I greeted him and he said I want to be first to congratulate you on receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see it's different for every person that's good that's a mistake the Pentecostals made well hey that one spoke in tongu so everybody no that's not the way it works it's different for everybody it's just like you know everybody's got a different color shirt on we're all going to have a different kind of lunch we're different and so um then I got a call the next day from my mother in Arizona and she said hey we got a letter here from President Johnson they need you in the in the service so within a week I was a US Soldier with the Holy Ghost for two years yeah and so they sent me to Fort po Siana it was worse than Houston it was armpit of the world you know and um so I'm down there and brother brand was preaching in shreport Thanksgiving so Rebecca came down and got me and I was in some of those Services there in shreport 1965 so on Saturday morning I had some time just a few minutes with him and I was concerned I didn't know what they were going to do with me I just finished basic training I don't know if I was going to be a you know tank commander or what um and so he said he didn't even pray said George don't worry footsteps of the righteous order of the Lord thank you got back to the Army you're going to make a cook out of you good take care of me and a few others you know well um so back while I'm in the Army things are going on and tuon they're finishing up the house and and then I I was um given I don't know it seems like several weeks around Christmas time to go home and be with family so I was in Tucson helping them put some of the furniture together in the new house they ordered got some things ready and so he was going to leave on um on the 18th of December and um so a week or so before he says to Rebecca one day now look dear um I know you've been without a piano these three years but I've saved up $900 and we're going to you and I are going to go down we're going to buy piano today okay so they go down to the piano store and he had no idea what pianos were worth but she had some idea so she's over here with the the spined pianos you know small ones And1 thousand pianos well he's wandering around the store and they opened up the big double doors in the back and they brought out from the shop uh a grand piano about the size of that one there maybe a little longer totally redone beautiful fruitwood you know what caught his attention oh says come over here look at this one no that they one embarrassing and so she got closer cuz you know he had a way of so she gets over closer and he says styo and Sons oh no Dad we can't let's not get involved here well just just play it see what it sounds like so while she's playing it gu super salesman he turns to the salesman he says how much did you take that pan right now well we'll take $0000 fine I can find $200 so he gives him a check for $1,100 they delivered the piano it went everywhere with us first thing on the truck you know and so come to 1992 we thought you know we've had this thing for several years we need to get it refinished make it look nice so Rebecca called the piano store and she told him you know we bought this piano and we want to have it refinished oh if we bought it here we got records what's the name Brandon wait a minute we sold just same with piano for $1,100 well you're looking at the check and we got the piano and um so he said well the man that refinished it then 65 he's still here he's got room for one more you're it so they came and got the piano they refinished it looks beautiful they delivered it well that cost us $3,500 and we thought we might want to take some insurance on this so we had an estimate made 9 two is worth 25,000 so it's a good investment and my daughter's got it today but um so anyway the the idea was the brands are going to go to Jeffersonville for Christmas 65 and they're going to leave Rebecca in town so that she can move the stuff out of the apartment up to the house and when they come back from preaching they can move right into the new house well when brother renham traveled he had some very strict rules for one thing the Bible was always the last thing into the suitcase that way there's nothing on top of the Bible and if you listen to very long to the tapes he says you don't put anything on top of your Bible not even my books so I'm watching number two he liked to leave very early at six o'clock he's rolling he doesn't care if everybody go to sleep he wants to get there well I wasn't going to get up and you know 5:00 and go say goodbye so I go up the night of the 17th to say goodbye to him which will be a Friday night and um so I'm in his room and the third thing that he was very strict about was if he was traveling just by himself or with Billy Paul he would wear some boots and some blue jeans and his shirt but if he was traveling with family he'd dress up a little bit you know so here I in the room with him and we're talking a little bit and I noticed on the chair by the door is his clothes for the next day and it's the boots and the blue jeans and I asked him what's this all about and he said well the guy never knows what he might have car trouble I knew this guy never had trouble with the car because he kept it very sharp but I didn't say anything he didn't say anything and less than 24 hours later he' been a terrible head-on collision which we don't we're go into all that right now but um uh that happened happened on Saturday evening on the 18th of December the next day was Sunday 19th we caught a flight over to Amarillo and uh people starting to gather there was no cell phones the only phone the only way to communicate was put quarters in the phone and so people were starting to come in you know and there's a lot of opinions and this is going to happen he's going to come walking out any minute just watching all these uninformed opinions you know and so we're sitting there and I noticed there's a Mexican family sitting way over here by themselves and so I go over to talk to them and u i um come to find out their grandson was in the other car so when they had the head- on collision there's these four drunk guys one died right on the spot this was another one I don't know where the other two were anyway I got to talking to them a little bit and that was it was 10-minute encoun never heard another word never saw him again but about two years ago come to realize that there's a man in Dallas right now who is the great-grandson and that man that was in the hospital the young man he became a Christian started preaching the gospel but he always lived under that cloud we helped kill Le random that would be a terrible situation but anyway um so the time you know people are there and I got in to see him once because it was very strict I had him all bandaged up had a trachea with him couldn't talk or nothing but you know there was there was 12 beds in that in that ICU and a lot of people praying a lot of faith um but during those six days he was there the other 11 beds got better walked out but on the evening of the 24th of December God said that's enough we took him home well we were like the disciples now what you know we had planned on this part of it brother REM says you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here just in another dimension faster than this they're not a million miles away so um there was a lot of things going on but on the 29th of December they're going to have a funeral in jville they transported the body family went up well you see I wasn't blood relative so I couldn't stay I had to go back to the Army and um the uh the funeral director want know should we bury him here well sister ROM didn't already know what day it was bil he wasn't going to make a decision so he said fine I'll keep him you guys decide what you're going to do we know the word says for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind the word is always right and also in Philippians and the peace of God which passes all understanding all things you can understand God's peace goes way beyond that shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus so here I in the Army Family struggling we learned to to pray listen learn and um we became anchored in the word you know missionary work began printing began and everything and um so comes time for uh my orders you went through cook school and now we're going to send you some place well I knew what God had done for me I knew God done something for Rebecca so I called her one day I said hey let's get married next Tuesday you bet so I go to Tucson have a private ceremony I took a honeymoon trip back to Indiana because there's going to be a burial on August 11th on a Monday and so U we U we uh go to this burial excuse me and all through Billy Paul's life he'd always kept touch with his with his grandmother Hope's mother but Hope's mother was a very difficult person she very hard never cried never went to church nothing but it was his grandma so when he goes to the burial on that Monday morning he leaves his two little boys with Grandma and he goes to the burial well as is typical in Indiana there's a light rain falling this all day and so when he comes back to pick up his little boys the grandmother says even the heavens weep for that man and for the first time Billy sees his mother his grandmother wiping her eyes and um so then we left that day and flew to California and on the 15th of April I flew off to Vietnam for one year and uh Rebecca had to take care of her mother her brother sister and learn how to take care of everything you know all of a sudden so after my two years in the military got back and um started working with the printing operation setting type and Spanish translations all that began in October of 67 and all these years we've been translating and speaking on the tapes printing the books all that's been going on the whole time I was just in Mexico this last uh last week in fact and they want books so we're printing books in China printing books in Mexico and Colombia and South America for the people they they want a book they they can read and underline turn back two pages so that's going on it's still going on and we're just glad that we can be part of something that honors God something where these people they want to know what did he say how did he say it and uh uh so we if we fast forward 40 years we come to October of 2006 and Rebecca was very sick she had been through uh cancer operation where that they took out the the um uh tumor and the kidney and they're watching her very close and I I can see that she's not getting well it just keeps deteriorating you know I said look you're not just somebody you live 19 years with around you know what Miracles are you know what faith is God can put you back brand new in the next 10 minutes but if he chooses to take you home look for your dad and wait for me there well um few days later a sister called from over here in West Virginia and she said now I was s getting up from the table today at noon and there was a vision right in front of me it's all these people brother Brown preaching faith and here's the prayer line it was all going on in this vision and he's looked up to me and you little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca and tell George everything's going to be all right but when you hear your name from the other dimension you pay attention you know so I realize things might not turn out the way I want them but it's going to be okay well sure enough November 28th of 06 the Lord took her home and after the funeral I remember praying Lord keep me busy keep me focused and keep me balanced so I'm very busy I got plans right up until Christmas right now and uh focus is beyond the curtain of time because this thing is winding up brother R said in 1964 if things go on the way they are right now whatever he was looking at 50 years would be Total Insanity so that Circle closed in 2014 we've been in Total Insanity for 10 years it's everywhere it's only the bride that's got common sense and live by a level the rest of doesn't matter so yeah we're very very busy and you know balance is very essential so for every one of you here tonight today the there is a line in the road if you go down and check the the at the mortuary they didn't all die at 95 there's a line in the road and I don't care how much broccoli you eat you won't go past that line God has a time to take you home you know and uh for those of you that are gathering numbers uh we were married just over 40 years we have three children they're all in they're all in church today three grandchildren two of them are married they're all serving the lord and um a lot of times we have questions and answers I see with you people it would take about 30 minutes because you're well taught you wouldn't have a lot of questions but when there's 6,000 Africans and first time I've been there so the brother says now we don't know when brother George is coming back but but do anybody got any questions well all they have is time they don't no hurry to go you know they probably brought a little lunch but you look out there's 6,000 people you look outside and there's 10 cars and there's probably uh U maybe 200 motorcycles and about 500 bicycles everybody else walked so they're no hurry to go any place well these questions keep coming and I got to translate I got to translate the answer the only question I remember um this sister sent up a question well since the Lord took your your wife why you still wearing the ring people notice everything I said well because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't until death departs for eternity oh okay and of course later I realized there's a secondary reason scare away desperate women you'd be surprised so my humble advice to you married people pay attention make her laugh every day whether she just laughing at you but make her happy okay right and um you know every every day people are looking at us to see how we living our Christianity we claim to be Believers we claim to be at the top of the pyramid really why is everybody so depressed looking down we're Victorious Christians scripture says by this shall all those people know that you're my disciples if you have love one to the other yeah but he doesn't believe just like me and his Pastor love one another very simple so um we're just very glad today to be involved with missionary work in many countries not just the printing but sending clothes sending stuff they need to these places that don't have anything like right now you probably noticed in the news last Sunday they had big election in Venezuela it looks like that the opposition is won they're going to finally put away the 25 years of dictatorship and kind of get things a little more balanced but things are expensive they don't have a lot of stuff so I send them boxes of stuff every couple weeks and um they they need money for for groceries you know we're helping them so the the gospel has reached very very high levels of the drug World either you have a relative or a friend somebody you know that's hooked on the drugs it's everywhere and the only reason there's drugs coming is because people are wanted here it's a it's a supply and demand and so the gospel has reached some of these high level drug people they have their own network amongst themselves where they're playing Spanish translated tapes right now the gospel is is going out many have been baptized their main guy is in is in prison out in Colorado he's a believer he just hadn't been baptized yet so um this same brother that I told you about earlier about the dream uh he had another dream later and he said he was in heaven physically and he was talking to brother Brandon I said no wait a minute you don't talk English he doesn't talk Spanish yeah but we were communicating so whatever language and so they're talking and he's tell them yeah you know down there where I live and brother R say look I don't care what they're saying I have said everything I've had to say okay but if I was to come back the way some people want I would have to have to take a few people to the Woodshed so I don't know what all God lets them see in that Dimension but enough to know that things aren't right you know and so they talked a little bit and then he noticed there was this young girl on brother brm's arm he looks at her ah that's Rebecca of course and she gives him a big smile and she says you tell George I'm waiting right where he told me to wait so it's very real so to achieve balance get back to this again you see one of the one of the Bible characters that's almost on every tape is the woman at the well and the lesson there is God is seeking those that will worship Him in spirit and in truth not all Spirit jumping and shouting not all truth no balanced how are we going to get balanced little simple you read one chapter out of your Bible every day minimum you read one chapter one page out of your church age book minimum you listen to at least 30 minutes of God's prophet and you pray if you'll do that every day you'll have a balanced life and a balanced Church it works so those are the things that we can share with you um when I come back maybe I'll have questions and answers figure out the details but you know let me just share this one thing here on Watchman one of the night 1960 brother REM says years ago there was a writer Fanny Crosby she was blind she didn't sell her Birthright like many singers today she was a different woman and uh so they came to interview her one day and they say why don't you write modern poetry why don't you write songs for the entertainment world he Saidi give all my talents to God oh then you believe there's a heaven oh yeah and you believe you're going to be there yes so they asked her well when you get there if you still blind how are you going to know him good question she said I'll feel the nail prints in his hands and she got up went in the other room and um when these people left she raised her hands and began to praise God and a strong a song struck her heart I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his sight I shall stand we're going to annoy so brother Ram says and today brother and sister she's walking the streets of Glory with far better sight than anybody on this Earth ever had she sees him she knows him she's standing Redeemed by his side and if I would ask her tonight Fanny grounds me what does Christ mean to you she would sing this song for me pass me not oh gentle s let's Stand Together get our chief musician over here to play the song in F ask me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry and that's our our prayer today that God have mercy on us I'm sorry and uh that he would hear our humble cry [Music] me not oh [Music] gent [Music] my th are [Music] saor oh my [Music] sa give my humble PR [Music] and while all of th are [Music] call not [Music] pass let me at that Throne of Mercy oh let me at that thr of Mery there I find a sweet kneeling there in deep contr oh Lord help my unel oh when we're crying say My Savior yes Lord won't you hear my humble cry for while all nothing that what [Music] call Jesus do not has be B yes in thy Mar oh [Music] the [Music] face my wounded broken Spirit oh Lord Save Me by thy Grace I'm crying saor [Music] saor here yes Lord a humble cry and why oh mothers th [Music] call do not pass [Music] me you know he's a living God am he gives a living experience a real reality you know you've heard brother George's the testimony in his life and every one of us have a testimony you know for many of us outside of brother George being here we were not there in the meetings if it were not for the recording that we had of deep calls to the Deep we would have never even seen it it would have just been what we could kind of imagine what was taking place by what we were hearing on the tapes but you know every one of us it comes down to the scriptures is blessed are your eyes that never saw yet you believe bless are your ears that have heard because the same God who took brother brandom and I want you to just just catch this brother brm says this in the message the Rapture he says you hear these men saying the statements message of the hour he said what that is that's a scriptural promise that God made us in his word and he said it like this we wouldn't know where to look if the Holy Spirit didn't point it out to us so this is the spirit of God coming to reveal himself and make the promise real to us in this generation and in our lives the whole purpose of this of the message coming was to bring a relationship between us and God where all the veils man man's ideas man's man's thoughts and and all of that existed down through time but God in this hour he came and he removed the veils so that we might see him personally for who he really is you think about it we're we're standing in an hour of where Paul stood and where the disciples stood on the day of Pentecost we're standing in that hour to be able to see him face to face in this hour to where that we can truly say many of you were here when brother Jerry was preaching and remember he made the statement when they they'll say to us you follow a man we're following I mean all through the scriptures Paul said follow me as I follow Christ is that right but we're following the pillar of fire now a lot of these other examples of these other churches you press them on one scripture you could talk to them about dress we could start there very simple and you start with just that well that that's no longer that's just that's no longer needed that was just where Paul immediately you realize who's following man because the pillar of fire it is God and God is his word the spirit of truth will never lead us outside of the word that's why a real truth true experience with God it leads us into the word it leads us all the way that's why when the Holy Spirit begins to work with the life like I know you I know we heard it as brother George said it but I want you to I love hearing these parts about brother brandham you know I I spoke to you about how brother brandham worked with brother Billy Paul but then three years brother George was right there with him I want you to watch this now I could guarantee if I asked brother George the question right now brother brandham did not Badger him when he came in the house time and time again hey you going to be baptized hey come on come on you going to be baptized he didn't do that to him he didn't do that to him but one of the things that brother George mentioned there in the beginning was this was a word that was lived and everything is Sovereign in God's time just exactly hey look we're living in an urgent hour if you haven't repented and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's an urgent hour today is the day of salvation is that right today is a moment to make sure that we we have the Seal of the Holy Ghost that that's what's more important than anything else in this life but to see the confidence what I want you I think we've seen that and I I trust you honed in on that the confidence the prophet himself bringing that that word it was a confidence this word will bring the experience sometimes we our frustration can be when we try to start doing things in our own efforts you can get frustrated with family you can get frustrated but any time frustration it's never because of God's leading it's because of us looking at a promise and trying to say how can I make this come to pass but if we'll just trust the Lord pray and say God let my life be so salty let it be salty let me be like that little bear that got in that tent that just got so got got all that molasses all over him and and just just oozing out the Molasses having something like what brother George mentioned as well that others can look at and say man I want what they've got amen not because they can quote scriptures and they can quote but there's they got a Joy about their life there's something that's joyous amen that's a joy that God gives I tell you if you don't have that Joy if you don't have that this morning God's here to give that he's here to do that for you is here for you even in this moment to take a hold of that promise it might have seemed like it slipped out of your grasp but it's not beyond what God is able to do for your life just say Lord just like within this Lord make yourself known to me make yourself more real to me when brother Bram said the holy the Holy Spirit has showed us the promise of this hour just be that simple with God be that simple Lord just show me Lord the promise for this hour show me Lord what your will is for my life Lord and as we're getting into the word get into the word for those of those of us as we've been around it listen friends we need to get into the message more than ever we don't need to be listening less we need to be listening more well I I listen to so and so you we need to listen to the message of the hour we can get caught up and listening to so many other ministers all around and I appreciate good Ministry but let me just say this to you if we're not careful we begin quoting other preachers instead of quoting the prophet of God are you hearing me God gave one voice of authority in this hour amen if we're getting blessed then it's because they're tapping into the same source who gave it to the messenger you believe that if there's ever a time in an hour we need to really get into the message of the Hour really really dig in say God and just make it personal Lord make yourself more real to me Lord if you need the Holy Spirit Lord condition Lord my life let everything about me rot away until there's nothing left but a willingness of full surrender if you've got loved ones they're not here here you claim them I don't care what the situation looks like it doesn't matter what kind of a condition that they're in there's no situation that's beyond Redemption some of us you're sitting here right now and you prayed for your loved ones and now your children are standing in church with you is that right am God's God's no respector person amen amen don't you love him amen amen thank you brother George thank you brother George amen if you'd like if you'd like prayer this morning we'd be happy to pray with you I'm crying SA
