in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege it is that we can call you our father to know that Lord by Revelation in our hearts that Lord that we have come from you your God we've been placed here in a body of time and Lord Jesus what a certainty it gives us within our hearts that Lord among all the other parts of life that are so uncertain we have that great certainty Lord of your presence of your life and to know that Lord where we are going more and we're so grateful for that Lord we draw strength Lord from you we draw strength from that reality oh God it's a paradox Lord our whole life as a believer it's a paradox for our birth was a paradox that new birth that new birth it's a paradox it's what cannot be explained by the intellects of man as you said in your word that Lord as one cannot tell from whence the wind bloweth no weather where it going so is everyone that is born of the spirit Lord how we thank you Father in our lives it's the most precious precious reality that there is Lord that we know that we have passed from Death unto life and like Paul could say that Lord we believe that you are able to keep that which we have committed unto you against that day God I just asked tonight Lord your blessing on your people father you know every need you know requests that are in Heart Heart Lord requests that have not been wrote down but you know Lord you know the things that Lord that is upon our heart the things that we've prayed about Lord you even know Lord our frustrations our confusions our questions you know about it all Lord father what a comfort it is tonight that we are not coming to stand in the presence of a man but we have come here God as your children Lord to come before your presence that Lord that you might speak to us Lord then you might minister to our hearts the very things that we have need of in our lives and Lord to speak to those needs Lord now father we just give ourselves to you Lord God is speaker and here together and we just invite you that you'll come in a very personal way Lord we just love you and we thank you tonight Lord may you move among your children Lord for every need that's here we pray Lord those that are gathered and will stream it we ask God you just move for them too father in the name of Jesus Christ amen it turned with me to Psalms 84. amen so good to be with you and certainly uh just uh appreciate your your prayers while we were there in the services and uh I don't want to delay too much on that but the Lord just really moved wonderfully in the services and just how God just dealt so personally with hearts and lives and healing deliverance and well on and on and we just thank God for his grace amen he's good isn't he man we we always have an expectation when we we come together and and what he's going to do among us because all it takes is just him to come and my I tell you it goes from impossible to everything is possible amen we're just so glad about that in Psalms 84. I'm just going to read three verses of scripture and let you be seated tonight in verse 8 verse 5 it says blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the Valley of Baca make it a well the rain also filleth the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appeareth before God amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just like to take and go into that second verse there verse six actually where it speaks of who passing through the Valley of Baca make it a well and the rain also filleth the pools and I want to just draw from there tonight you know this passage of scripture I shared this with you before but it's one of these passages of scripture that there's been actually certain times and even in other meetings even over a year ago that I wondered if I would speak upon it but you know it's just something that so God begins to burn on your heart that you recognize it's part of it's part of our journey it's part of what God is doing in our lives and I think that we all can look into the word of God and we'll come here tonight that we might be encouraged in the things of God there's enough things that goes on all around us that is there to try to discourage us and try to worry us try to wear us down but there's one place that as a believer that we really get encouragement from and that's from the word of God sometimes there's things that we don't even sense the impact of the word as we're taking it in and we don't realize it sometimes until sometimes time later and we recognize that God has strengthened us through his word just you and I being available being opened and just receiving from him that to me is a paradox it's just because if God placed it that even that we had to sit here with our minds and try to I need to grasp a hold of every word and I've got to put this all together I'm sure that that's that we would it would it would certainly wouldn't work that way even though we know that God will take his word and the word itself has to be taken in our mind first but I believe that when we come to the house of God we recognize that I'm not here to depend upon my natural abilities God's given me ability to hear but I this is a hearing that I need that goes deeper than my ability to repeat words or to memorize scripture but I had the ability to be able to hear from God personally that God is speaking be to me that God is visiting my tent that God God is coming to minister to my need and that's not just something we're looking at tonight but every single time that we come together that God has something very special for you and I and he's speaking to our lives God doesn't get uh you know short with us as a matter of fact there's no patience that can compare to the patience of God there's no long suffering that could compare to the long-suffering of our Lord Jesus and how that God will work and move and minister to our lives and in such a personal way and I just want to just take that thought just for a few moments on the passing through the Valley of Baca and looking at this this point of scripture because as we took this last week and we're looking at of of appropriate responses to things and how that we respond even in the midst of a test of a trial and we need we need something much deeper than just our DNA we need something deeper we we have to have something more that's than just our ability or our patients because we recognize that a lot of that a lot there might be individuals you know that they seem very very patient and they've got that virtue in their life but the difference between it being a natural virtue and a god-given virtue is the Holy Ghost because when the Holy Spirit has come into our lives then it's not us exhibiting patience but it is God inside of us that in the midst of the trial we are patient enduring and looking to God as a matter of fact every one of those virtues if you are acquainted with that of the Statue of a perfect man these are not just things that are these are not things that are just added to us and we walk out of service and we walk out as just you know uh pyramids were walking out but the reality is is every one of those virtues have already been packed into our life and when the Holy Spirit has come he seals every one of those virtues within our life and his tests and trials every one of those virtues that you look at they are manifested in times of adversity so what really declares that the bride is the bride is the word and and we know that even in the midst of tests and trials this is where the word is made manifest because we can all rejoice as many times we can look at the word and we can Rejoice but where it comes down to is does the word itself live and produce what the word is saying and when tests and Trials Come is that word living is it something that's a substance and a strength in our life that generates a power that we're able to stand within that moment because that's the promise of the word you understand me that's the promise of the word so when when new we write here in the scripture blessed is the man as David could say in that first verse whose strength is in you he's drawing his strength from God there let me just say it this way it's not something as though that you know just coming by and god-giving strength once in a while but this man is connected to God there is a Lifeline there if I can say it like this there is such a union that he can say the Lord is the strength of my life and that's that's the that's the very equality of the Rapture where you and I are able to say God is my strength he's the one I'm drawing strength from in my life David said my enemies came around me and what was the purpose of the enemies to destroy him but he said they came around my flesh but they stumbled and fell why did they stumble and fall because David was standing in the very line of duty in the purpose of God and it was God's strength that was permeating in his life that gave him the ability to endure in the midst when things had encroached all around him so there's no glory that David could take there's no glory that you and I can take all the glory goes to God blessed is the man in whose strength is in you whose heart and we pulled this out is sat on pilgrimage or if we could ever sing that song this world is not my home you see you can tell by the way that you live where is your heart you see if your heart is still tight to this earth here you'll live for this Earth you live for these means remember that's why the test came to job Satan said I know man I know his weakness you let me touch everything that's around me and I promise you he'll curse you to your face you know what Satan was making a bet on he knew the weakness of man of that first birth because that first birth is what's is we came because one in the beginning let down on the word in the in the in the whole Battle of reasoning and so Satan knows let me tell you something brother put it this clear Satan is the near Kinsman of our first birth are you hearing me now kinsman redeemer remember when Boaz came to redeem Bruce he could not straight go and redeem her he first had to come to the nearest kenchman and ask him are you able to do the work and the nearest Kinsmen said I cannot do it lest I'm Mar my inheritance that's why brother REM said the devil could not be nothing different and take away the devil it would Mar who he is he's the devil but there is one who stands for you and I that's able to say I will take the reproach I will bear the reproach and I will do for them what none other can do blessed be the name of the Lord whose heart is set on pilgrimage why our focus is not upon this Earth we've got a place we're going let me just say this we have a place we're going we have a promise every other age has a promise of overcoming I'll give you to either Tree of Life uh you shall partake of the Hidden Manna I'll give you a stone wherein a white stone wearing a new name is written all of those promises are to the Overcomers in every age in each age and then here we come to the end and this age it is then an inheriting of all of those promises and here we stand where God made a promise that that he that overcometh shall set with me in my domain in my father's throne even as I also overcame and am set down so in the same process you know Jesus was announcing now think about this this was not something that Jesus was making up he catches John up and lets John behold his coming remember the second coming of the Lord has been going on when the Holy Ghost came it sealed the first coming and it opened the second coming to make you and I ready and that's why Paul said we are longing and looking for the coming of the Lord that's our desire is his coming that's why in every service that's why every moment of our life we should expect his coming can I bring it down personal Lord I've got this situation on the job we should look for his coming Lord I've got this in school look for his coming Lord this issue is going on in the family or this or that look for his coming say brother Samuel what does that to do you're missing it I'm talking about him who is the answer to all things he that is the dissolver of every doubt we are people of the coming and we should expect his coming that's why every service it should be with an expectation do you realize what makes the service the service is your expectation right they call Satan if he can come and bug you and get on you and cause you to say this or do this or whatever more then he would like to put that old gloomy Spirit over you and tell you why you are not worthy to receive from God but let me tell you something you're just a moment away from where there is repentance to say Lord forgive me o God because I know what Satan's trying to do he's trying to keep me back from a blessing are you hearing me that's part of maturity maturity isn't oh I don't have any more of those blunders maturity is is to recognize oh this was said I shouldn't have said that repent because he is on the way with a blessing for my life hope it don't stumble you you might just be getting off of your knees from repenting and your atoms are changed because remember he still got on the garments of the priest Hallelujah and when he changes his garments we get a change of garments also and until that time we need him to be a high priest glory be to God whose heart is set on pilgrimage this this man's strength is his the life that is there wherein that God is the very strength of his life and he is like we looked at it last week he is our source within that we draw strength from in our lives you know it's one thing to draw strength from one another and I believe that that's necessary you know I I don't believe any of this you know Pride where you know it's well you know I don't need nobody I got the Holy Ghost and I don't need nobody they're going to be something come to deflate you now I don't say that to be negative because many times I don't even try to wrestle that when I've heard other people before well my faith keeps sickness away from me what do you do brother Samuel well I'll tell you what I've done I just pray God give them Grace because they're going to need they're going to need that because we're still in these bodies right here we're still in all of that and and thank God for Faith right but there's also faith that comes that you and I have to be able to go through something I mean what if you never went through anything why would you want to leave hello somebody God has to allow things to come about that causes us to want to leave oh boy we'll preach God has to allow things in our life that we desire to leave where we are at presently in our own lives not just waiting for the change of our body but God and what God's trying to do call us out of us because then the one that's the biggest enemy of our life is the guy that we gal that we look at the look in the mirror every day that's our biggest enemy oh no no no no if so-and-so didn't push my buttons remember you got buttons to push and the change of the body is also to do away with those buttons as much as it is for what they push your buttons with are you hearing me so in the meantime in the meantime we are here under the molding and the shaping of almighty God and we receive strength from him so we do we do receive strength also from one another but it isn't it isn't just uh human strength right right it's strength that comes from the Lord that's what Paul could talk about that we comfort those who are in the midst of a trial by the same Comfort we are comforted with he is also we looked at this he's our saving strength he's our saving strength he comes to our rescue but the way we think of rescue sometimes is not altogether how God does it God doesn't come to our rescue and here we are in the midst of everything and God says let me take you out of that and I'll put you over here that's not rescue the rescue is God rescuing us from our own selves it's God's way of rescue the Bible tells us in regarding this of Joseph in the book of Acts it speaks of how in the book of Acts that God was with him and God delivered him but God delivered him into every appointment that God had for him the greatest Deliverance that we we can have is deliverance from ourselves it contains themselves right so blessed is that man and who's who finds his strength in God his heart is set on pilgrimage he's not relying upon the world for strength he's he and he considers himself a visitor a traveler it's just one who's passing through let me just try to jump into this just for a few moments tonight who passing through the Valley of Baca make it a well and the rain also filleth the polls just in study here and over the past time of looking at this many of the even of the writers and so forth do not have this pin down as far as an actual physical point on the map but it is figurative if we can because even whether if it was a point or not it's still figurative and any that it's applied to our life that how a man has strengthened God and His desire is the house of God his heart is set on pilgrimage in other words this world is not my home I'm just passing through and there is the need who passing through not coming to dwell in the valley we're not made to dwell in the valley we are inhabitants of Mount Zion we are the inhabitants of Mount Zion when it speaks of the Bride we are elevated not by our own works we are elevated through the perfect cleansing Redemptive work of Jesus Christ we are elevated into position as his pride glory be to God so our position is not the valley but the valley is necessary it's necessary as we're coming and we live in the valley we live from the strength of him who has positioned us as Mount Zion you see we're like that that young man who was working in the field and they said what do you do with him well he gets everything his way everything goes how he wants it to go everything's perfect he that don't happen that way that's not why he was acting the way he was acting he still had to eat the same things that they had to eat he had to work the same way they had to work what is it that's different about this boy what was different it's what he knew in another land my daddy is the king he's the king that makes me the son of a king so that reality affected his conduct in the midst of what was going on That's The Power of divine revelation are you hearing me divine revelation has a power in it because it works to affect our lives the way we act the way we behave so the valley itself it's a place in the journey now notice just even from the scripture here it's a place a valley we know it's a place that lays between mountains it's a place that we know that if you look in the scripture it's wonderful wonderful wonderful victories that were rocked in valleys it was also in the valley that there was an Army that challenged God and said he's God of the mountain but he ain't god of the valley God said I'll take that challenge up I let him know that the same gun on the mountain is the same God in the valley oh we ought to just take that and run it right back in the devil's face you've already sung a special to him you ought to put it right back in his face God is still here no matter how I feel what circumstance look like God is still presence [Applause] this part of the journey reminded that it was from the valley of Esco where Caleb and Joshua brought grapes from not from the mountain from the valley because fruit don't grow in the mountaintops fruit grows in the valley right so to many precious Promises of the valley and things that take place God does many things in the back let me just say it like this you realize it was in the valley that Goliath met his end he wasn't on a Mountaintop it would despise The Valleys because it's in the valley where we've seen those greats God Vindicated his word when challenge came with Goliath God Vindicated his anointing that had returned to Israel he Vindicated it by bringing Goliath down and made him he made him not fall on his path he made him fall on his face every word that he ever said and he cursed the armies of Israel God said I'll make you bow on your face hey man what should I do I tell you what I do I get ready for a chance to start falling in the valley I forgot to start showing up with grapes in the valley you see it's how we looked at the valley [Music] think of what brother country said when he was here which we know is very very true think of what he said when he dealt with just in the part about tragedy and purpose and he said many of the times the reason we stay as long as we do it's our attitude help me preach somebody now we went from shouting to getting quiet but let's we're here to be helped I don't want to dwell in the valley no longer I'm supposed to be here because I'm just supposed to be passing through in other words I'm not setting up homekeeping here in the valley the valley is just just a point along the way where am I going I'm going back to where I come from I've got an appointment when the Rapture I've got I've got a I've got a place in the Millennium I've got a place at the wedding supper place in the Millennium I got a place at the future home I have appointments better to be kept and that is worth more than anything of this life nothing in this life is worth missing the Rapture form you say bring it down personal a funny feeling it's not worth missing the Rapture for come on somebody anger and lack of forgiveness and bitterness is not worth missing the Rapture talk we're just passing through foreign be to God but in this Valley this Valley it definitely infers that in this Valley is heaviness in this Valley is weeping now you hear me now in this Valley is distress and it's only a place only a place that we pass through Maybe now there have been some places that I've passed through on trips that I don't care if I never Pastor them again I'm just being honest some places to me in my opinion ugly I don't care if I ever pass through there again some places wow you can see certain effects and things like that that's all around but then there's other places that you look back and you think man I sure like to go through there again maybe if we can kind of you know take the trip out and kind of go through the leaves are nice and pretty right now and you don't mind going through that you know because it's it's somewhere we like to go through but these valleys are not places that anybody signs up for matter of fact this Valley is not on the tourist list this Valley does not have a resort that it's booked out no but this Valley is predestined appointments for everyone of God's children but let me just say this to you no more than staying at a hotel as your permanent residence no that's the same way it is with the valley of baka you check in and you check out I'm just passing through that's why this world's not my home I'm not I'm not of this world I'm of that other world [Applause] so there's a destiny and we we realize that with that this is why we want to be very important to notice whose heart is set on pilgrimage and who passing through the Valley of Baca what we want to make sure is if you can look and you find yourself in a valley of weeping distress or heaviness or sickness oppression or somebody said something about you or them just make sure look real quick and say which way are my feet pointed when I've come to this have I went to turn around to go back because we're challenged with that am I going to go back because you know what Satan's deal is I'll let off the heat if you'll just take your foot off the gas a little bit I take the heat off of her she just never brought me do anything but trouble and trials and look what it's done with your family I beg to differ with that liar it's been the greatest blessing and privilege of my life because this message is not a movement it's Jesus Christ being revealed then give me a little bit more right here I don't want to lose my voice [Applause] I hope it's okay I lost my Lawson was a miracle that I preached on Sunday morning God totally restored it I didn't have monitors down there and I've got to have monitors oh brother Sammy you don't know you're not a preacher so you wouldn't know but anyhow beast and the pilgrimage that we're on make sure what direction your feet are on let me tell you the worst thing to do in the midst of a trial is pull back on God can I just be very Frank if when a trial comes because they are going to come if when a trial comes you find yourself going away from God going right back out in the world then you need to ask God give me a deeper experience I need a strength in my life that goes beyond my mental acknowledgment of truth I need an anchor Hallelujah because the trial is not greater than God's strength in your life and I don't say that to shame you that should be a test in our lives turn it down just a little bit if when things are coming out I go out oh by the same I don't go back on the world but you lay out of church for how long amen oh well I'm just going through a trial who isn't who isn't oh you're not going through a trial like I am how do you know remember trials are peculiar and particular to each one are you hearing me that's why we're not called I'm just going to preach straight to this coming that's why we are not called we sympathize empathize with one another but we recognize that God strengthens you and I he comes to strengthen us throughout this building right here there's hearts and lives that no matter what is taking place even some maybe that are not even here and on and on that even in the midst of the toughest of trial you say well it ain't just about being a church it's about being in the house of God and serving God let me just say this if the world still holds an appeal you need a birth [Applause] say it with the love of God in my heart because that is what's going to get you out of here that's what will get you through every test and every trial oh God help us you got to be sure which way is your pilgrimage heading is it heading toward God or away from God Paul would even admonish the people of God he would send the disciples in Acts 14 21. the Bible said when they had preached the gospel to the city and had taught many then returned again to last her into Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God this is not a picnic this is a journey are you with me and the valley of baka is a personal personal appointment for my life it's personal for your life and hope you understand this this Valley there'll be many valleys there's many valleys of baka along the journey because God's got a purpose in the midst of this Valley god brother Branham would say it in the message I know he said why do we come to these troubles what makes these things come why should a Christian ever be perplexed why wouldn't not everything just run perfect for a Christian but it doesn't and we know it sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners because it's written many is the afflictions of the righteous but God delivereth him from them all God promised oh my let me just rehearse this God promised many afflictions strange feeling any better had strange feelings sure have and strange things that would be beyond our understanding what God promised I know those are not things that are rehearsed those are not things that books are written on but that is the word of God this is all part of our journey God promptly with that promise he said I'll deliver you out of every one of them that's what he did say so when I flip a flee getting out of the fire but Deliverance is is God saying I have arranged this so that I can meet you personally here in the midst of the fire glory be to God but Lord what about all these lines don't worry about the lines I'm the ones who I'm the one who created them oh I know they're bigger than the you know than your tabby cat and whatever more but they ain't only but kitty cats once they're once under my presence and under my control and they won't touch you in order to be to God but it's always done for our good we just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be Faith to us we would go with an understanding now I want to pick that up here in just a little bit if we understood it if we did but we don't then it would not be Faith to us so Faith itself is not me understanding the trial but faith is an understanding that God has everything in control that God is working it out and I am going to hold to God's unchanging hand we do it we believe by faith his word that it's going to work something good for us if we could grasp that today if we could grasp that all our troubles there is none of us immune from them and we could realize that those things are for our good how brother Brown would go on to say after he says we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come I referred you to a scripture last week out of First Peter chapter one a very common scripture especially when we talk about tests and trials and and the first couple verses speaks of The Inheritance that we have waiting on us a body that is not prepared with hands and we have that Assurance in our hearts we draw strength from Before the Throne of God down into this life that we're living in verse 6 it says wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations if need be now I'm sure that every one of us if we had to we would tell God I don't need that Lord I don't need that you know just like your kids would tell you I don't need that yeah yeah I got that yeah yeah you know they know where you're going yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't need that but God knows what we need let me tell you something God will use circumstances friends when we speak of this within trials and I hope I can get to this point of it here tonight that when we look at the testings and the trials that come up on our life it's not always correction whereas that we've done something wrong God will also at times allow things to get our attention you understand God will allow things to get our attention that maybe if maybe if we're straddling the fence and we just kind of back and forth God will allow a situation to get our attention something to come up you know what to cause us to realize where am I at where am I at you see if a situation goes by and there's no reflection here maybe for you that was a waste but for somebody it wasn't are you hearing me that's why when things come around we must learn from it and say God help me to learn what is it that you're trying to teach me and don't give him a bunch of words that this is what you're trying to do you don't understand it right you don't understand it I don't understand it but that's where faith comes in in our life oh my goodness Pastor back in town any wherein we greatly rejoice what are we rejoicing in in that article for Yonder so my joy is about where I'm going my joy is not about what I'm going through it's not what I'm glaring in what I'm glaring in is that I know that this trial cannot take me it's only going to move me and shape me but there's nothing that can affect or deter my destiny I have been sealed until the day of redemption so in the midst of my trial I can Joy I can thank God not because the trial is good but because I know where I'm going we are in heaviness through manifold Temptation so this is not the valley of baka it's not a a a choice destination it's a place of heaviness why that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so what's on trial here our faith God's Not trying God is not wondering where is your faith at but God knows where our faith is at I hope you understand this God knows God knows if our faith is only here he knows if it's here and the trial itself will unfold that and what's what's more precious than gold not the trial but our faith because the gold of this Earth it belongs to the one whose faith I have been born of right true he does the deity is not in heaven it's in you the earth and the fullness thereof Belongs to the Lord it's his faith in my life that has brought my faith to a level that's not just intellectual are you with me it's his faith motivating our faith you understand what I'm saying his faith is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the life I'll now live I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and that Faith moving in our life it affects our faith and God will turn around in the church ages and reward the Believers I have seen your faith and brother Graham said see he weren't talking about his faith in that scripture he's talking about their faith oh God I want my faith to be affected by his faith I want my but it actually displays please oh glory be to God look at this here in the scripture we find with this as we look at it at Peter it's bringing this about then we realize that as all of this comes about in verse 9 we are going to receive the end the completion the culmination of our faith even the salvation of our souls oh glory be to God so this this Valley I'm just passing through you hear me I'm just passing through so these trials they're a natural normal part of Christian Life that's the words of the prophet they are a natural normal part of Christian life now let me just say it like this let me let me read this here and I think this will kind of let me let me just kind of hone in on this part of it here tonight to try to get this tied up brother Batman refers to this in three kinds of believers and he says the Believers we are put to the test and he said remember trials and Dusty roads and hot son of persecution but it's the Loyalty of your heart that beats that material until she's ready to go into the mold so all of those things that are a part of the valley of weeping but it's the heart taking a hold on God's word and say Lord this is what you've promised and as we're standing there upon that word weeping in heaviness crying out to God what is it that's beating Our Lives what is it that's molding that character our heart is stayed on God blessed is the man whose heart his strength is in the Lord his heart is set on pilgrimage in reality this man can't give up you know why because he never did start what was in his life right oh I gave my life to God one day no God got a hold of your life don't try to take any glory in it God got a hold of your life hallelujah oh one day I went to the altar no God moved upon your heart and God Drew you no glory of our own this is not my work it's God's word we are his workmanship [Applause] Hallelujah so I didn't start it I'm not the one to finish it but I'm Anointed with the same one who started it I'm Anointed with the finishing anointing because I'm living in the finishing age and the Holy Spirit that has anointed me is the one who has come to take the seals off of the book and I've been anointed to finish this [Applause] [Music] glory be to God oh I'm going to fall you rebuke that devil no you're not oh there'll be something down the road now right here I am where I am by the grace of God and what I got in need of was what lays down the road God will prepare me for that moment and just listen up devil that moment is not to destroy me yes that moment is not to consume me I'm just passing through I'm not going to take up residence with you you realize sometimes friends we can take up residence on things so and so talked about me so and so said this do you realize that that's permitted to be a valley of baka I can pull out a Litany of quotes tonight and scriptures on that if you'd like but sometimes we're looking oh brother William I tell you bless God if he'd be if he was more of a real believer I tell you oh man he said this about I'll tell you if he really had the goods if he and God said you're not just green behind the ears Samuel you're green all over boy you know why because we're always looking at ready if so and so I had done this so-and-so hurt me so-and-so said this so-and-so said that you know the sad thing about it is some folks have taken up residency in the valley of baka and the trial is bitter are you hearing me now the trial is bitter it's weary but God never made you to be a bitter Christian the circumstance around you I can read scriptures here tonight where the circumstance is bitter but God never ordained you to become a receptacle of bitterness and anger and resentment God never ordained that you need to put your notice in tonight I'm checking out of the valley of baka because the valley of baka God wants to do things in the valley and he can only do it when we allow patience to have her not his the bride submits let her perfect work I agree with Mr Patsy Lord help me [Applause] I love that Honesty because we argue and we all Lord help me Lord help me we need it because this Valley listen friends these are things tonight when the Holy Spirit would press Upon Our Hearts this is words of encouragement for you and I you know what it does sometimes it doesn't necessarily dissolve or resolve the issue but it lets you know that Satan's trying to hinder me he's come right into a test or a trial and he's come to hinder me right it's like somebody experiences a car accident and because they experience a car accident maybe they're driving along the road and so forth and they experience a car accident then Satan's desire would say hmm not only do they got to pay the insurances and all these bills but you know what I think I'll do while in this vulnerable part right here I'll slip in with fear to where they won't want to get behind a car again over the center that's not a big deal well no Satan is an opportunist Satan would love remember in the midst of the valley he came at job in every angle is that right oh but I'm so glad that God is our deliverer I'm glad about that tonight aren't you I'm glad that God don't sit down and say oh why do you have that attitude in the valley but I'm glad that God when he begins to speak and we can say yes Lord we begin to experience the Liberty as Satan's cover is taken off and we can say yes Lord yes Lord thank you Lord what's happening now we're getting ourselves in a position to receive what we need in the valley because in the valley he maketh it a well he reigneth down blessings that filleth the pools places that are ordained to receive refreshment and he ordains that for our lives God's children oh my God's children is made up correctly on his word they're living examples and the word of God living through them the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand tested and tried now let me just can I have just a couple more minutes I'm only going to take just a couple more minutes here on this I know that's dangerous but for job the test and the trials came and then he had those friends of his and they were friends they were friends they looked upon job and they sat there for seven days the Bible says and they saw the grief now the Bible when he speaks of the grief it says that they could see physically and mentally the effect upon his life one of the wisest things those seven friends could do were those three friends sitting there for seven days and not saying a word that was the best thing right right I mean you you and I had people that said dumb things sometimes oh I understand do you really you you walk through this way I forgive me if that offend you I don't mean to offend you but you understand what I'm saying sometimes you just take it you know for that hey they don't okay we don't I'm not going to put up roads about that you know hello not gonna put up their picture as how they say foolish things no that's sometimes people say things when they don't know what else to say they get nervous and they just say something right so we don't fault them for that but we understand even with that right there what are we going to do we're going to cop an attitude hello we're gonna cop an attitude with them well if you really knew what I knew I don't know think I want to know maybe maybe I need to get my my plasmat suit or hazmat suit and yellow suit okay come on and tell me what it is Sammy what what are you saying I'm saying it's important that we don't become Valley dwellers we're just passing through we're just passing through bitterness is not a result of the valley a product bitterness can be a condition of the valley but it's not a product that we receive from God at all I want you to think of this he know job knowed that he had met God's requirements and there was no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and as long Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whip are you hearing me as long as Satan could make job think now Satan could not make Job Curse God but he was making him think it was God doing it now he knew it was Satan doing it but Satan was making him think it was his God doing it now let me just read on here just a moment but he said when that Revelation struck job that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something did you catch that only going through to make him something only passing through the valley to make us something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and he said he'll try to tell you that these trials this is your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so it's Satan doing it and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this Earth by the cares of it or whether you're treasure is in heaven you read through the Book of Job as a Bible reader you come into the second chapter and job right there he's already in the Valley of Baca but these are statements while passing through for the circumstance that he was in and the situation oh I wish the day had never come that they said a man child was born I wish I had never been born are you hearing me you know why the heaviness the distress the Weeping the anguish the sorrow the but you know one thing you don't ever read about with job this is to me is what's I've looked at this and if somebody finds it and you find it and send me a text shoot me email but I've read through and I've tried to find I don't find one place that job ever was angry with the sabians or the Chaldeans uh-oh y'all hear me so in other words he didn't attack the boss boss's picture on the wall no it's not sharp enough he might have felt like it are you hearing me come on let's let's bring it down where it's at because job's flesh is no different than our flesh but there have listen if it's not wrote in there it doesn't mean that he didn't experience anger at the sabians at the Chaldeans and what they did but what it goes to show is that from what happened and between that moment there had to be the work of the sacrifice in job's life as job was feeding off that sacrifice that was able to wash him it was able to cleanse him he didn't diminish what the sabians had done or what the Chaldeans had done but job said I am not going to allow this the valley you know what I'm talking about a lot of times feelings and everything else it can work to keep us there and let me say this over and over you hear brother Brandon put this very clear in the message we have rights job had a right to be angry job had rights are you hearing me but as sheep what do sheep do forfeit you know what I'll just be honest with you I'm not too big to ask God Lord help me to submit to the Shaving yeah are you hearing me I'm not too big to admit that God's had to bring me around to help me to see sometimes that this is what I'm trying to do finally as she comes around you don't tell me everything but there's sometimes where there's things that God has let move on experiences and it's not that I'm dwelling in the valley for years but through a period of time of what he's doing and sometimes we don't know what's going on like job we're questioning does he love me does he love me like he loves this one come on now brother Graham said he was on the ash sheep after visiting Oral Roberts place he said I was on my ash Heap I put my hand on the marble fixtures he said I went out and on my ash Heap I said God I guess you can't trust me but there was a voice that came to him and said look up I am your portion [Applause] so sometimes the ass heaps the valley is not altogether what we're thinking sometimes we don't even realize we've entered the valley and here we are and we're wondering God is it something about me is there something I'm doing wrong Lord am I I'm not doing this well enough is it not going like this is it not and you know what as a Believer you ought to thank God if you reflect on your life because as a Believer we should reflect all right let's just close I can keep going with this and we need to go I'll keep you here for a while but I think it's just so it's so crucial in the midst of these times to realize we're not standing here as secret sinners job wasn't a secret sinner job didn't understand what was going on I want you to think about this job didn't understand what was going on for 31 chapters finally at the beginning of chapter 32 Ella who had showed up in Ella who said I stayed quiet but now I've got something to say I've let wisdom speak and you would think that days on this Earth should speak see Ella who was a respectful Reverend he was younger than the rest but he realized the days the age was not addressing what was going on and so Ella who came and the first thing that elohu tells job he says you've tried to justify yourself think of that you've tried to justify yourself in the eyes of God and he rebuked him for it you know why because job couldn't figure out what was going on why is this happening to me I haven't done this I haven't done that I have but you know what was powerful and at all I got to stop you know what's powerful in it all job also had the testimony he didn't move from the word of God his character might have moved a little bit but you ain't going to move that inner man that inner man is there to mold the character and pull it back in line thank God for his Mercy listen friends I may not know and I don't need to know what it is that you're going through you don't need to know what I'm going through we can we can converse with one another and I want you to understand I don't make light of what anyone would be going through I hope you understand that but neither do I glorify anything that I'm going through or you're going through the only one that needs to be glorified is the Lord Jesus because no matter what we look at in a test or a trial or whatever it is we're only going to get through it by the grace of God and if there's one thing we can say God let me have Grace that means your favor let me have Grace what kind of Grace well I think I'd like to have some Grace like Ruth because it may not be all at once but he might just drop a handful day by day he gives me just enough strength each moment to keep looking to him and keep coming back say Lord I'm looking to you you're my strength remember this Valley is not your destiny but this Valley is a predestinated appointment from God's mind to try us to perfect us to see where we're standing to see are we tied to this earth or are our Treasures in Heaven because we can't have both it's one or the other and if we evaluate and say I'm more tied to the Earth where there's a power to loosen you from that hold and a power to unite you with that other hold there's the power of the grace of God right now to break and bring and bring right here in the midst of the valley of baka sweetness where's it at just just look to him I'm sure there's a little tree he'll show you I'm sure there's a little tree he'll show you and that little tree is Calvary Moses saw that little tree it wasn't a tree that Moses had to have a chainsaw for it was just one that was sufficient that when it was placed in bitter Waters it turned those bitter Waters there's still a god who's present to sweeten Waters water don't you love him tonight wonders if he hit his bowed they go to the Lord in prayer tonight I wonder how many would like to be remembered in prayer tonight God knows amen God bless you my hand is up with you Hallelujah let's just go to God In Prayer let's look to him we're just passing through Lord Jesus Lord here tonight as we humble our hearts Lord in your presence Lord the trials and the tests or to all that that would come Lord there is as the scripture said many are the afflictions of the righteous and Lord we Lord there's just trials that we things Lord of life that happen that are truly great tragedies just like our brother Cadre Lord administered Lord but father right here tonight as you've just been speaking to our hearts and Behind These uplifted Hands Lord we don't want to be residents of the Valley of Baca that's that's not our appointment we're we're going we're going into rapture we can't escape the valley of Baka and Lord as the prophet could pray I don't want to escape him My Flesh doesn't want them Lord I'm just going to be real My Flesh doesn't want to test and trials it doesn't like them but Lord the Inner Man I know that they're necessary and we ask you for Grace Lord that you'd give us Grace to go through each one sometimes Lord like job you know Lord as even I was praying over this last week and there's things that you was even speaking to my heart there Lord there towards the beginning of last week and Lord just realizing you're leading oh how overwhelming it is Lord just to see you're working in our lives and Lord even when we're not aware but it's Lord that word having a hold of that word standing on the word of God and letting the word just have an effect in our life Lord there's a molding that's going on there's a shaping that's going on now Lord just like any any patient Lord in a hospital Lord I know that many of sitting right here tonight they remembered years ago Lord when we were ministering on certain things like forgiveness and one of the things that they'll do in many of them cancer centers they they've got confidence that medicine will work one of the things they try to find out or is there anything that'll block that medicine and one of the things that they look for are there any grudges now this is Medical Science Lord this is not Believers but this is Medical Science they can see the effect of things in that emotional realm that can actually affect and block the work of Medicine the Lord if that in itself could block the work of medicine that we would take whether interveniously or take my mouth or whatever if that if things emotionally in our body could do that then Lord how much more could things like that hinder the work of the holy spirit in our lives so Lord we ask God right here tonight Lord that you would just cleanse every channel of our life Lord if there's things the Lord that right now that in the midst of this Valley this Valley Lord when we come out of it there we are to come out stronger than when we entered in more like you and I asked God that you would help us Lord right here tonight to receive Grace in our lives Lord where the Holy Spirit would go down Lord with a real Divine evaluation and pull out and say you've got some unforgiveness you've got some bitterness you've got some anger you and going right down through and say I can't go around that but I can relieve you of that oh God we welcome you tonight Lord we welcome you tonight with the conditions that Lord that would be present in the valley and won't be present we would have a right to all of those things but God if we just as a lamb surrender our rights to you then the dove will fly back and begin to move and work and deal and strengthen our lives Lord God may we recognize Satan's desire is to get us trapped in the valley you permit the tests and trials to come but then he wants to trap us there father I just got a confidence Lord that right here tonight that you're moving Lord God among your children the Lord where there were holds and where there were things that were there that Satan has planted those seeds I've Got Confidence that the good man the son of man is moving down right now and is planting seeds that'll counteract the effect of the bad seeds that Lord would remove those hindrances Lord if we lord God will confess it and put it before you and invite you in Lord God and Lord we know that God that you're there to strengthen us and to help us we submit ourselves Lord we submit our life to you we forfeit our rights I think in the scripture of Isaiah 53 when it is written of the bridegroom himself our champion the chief Shepherd but it would put that of the Bride in there and said who was led as a lamb is dumb before her shears letting us know that there is that which we must pass through because when it would be wrote In the book of Acts it would say who as a lamb was led done before his shears because there was the suffering that our Lord and savior had to go through Lord you've left more to measure for us help us Lord help us Lord as Lambs to submit ourselves to you Grant him Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to stand Hallelujah let's just let's worship Him [Music] [Music] okay come on [Music] please oh you're never alone [Music] he's still gone when things go wrong will you make them right in the god of the good times he's still got in the bad times and the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] but it's down in the back valleys of Trials and Sensations oh that's where faith is really puts you put to test for the God on the mountain peace to God when things go wrong oh he'll make them [Music] a god of the good time he's still God in the bad times or the god of the days [Music] when we're up on the mountains foreign [Music] [Music] for the god of the mountains he still he shook the valley that's when things go oh he'll make [Music] the god of the good times [Music] he's still God in the night Hallelujah you know there's not a not a time and not a moment many times I just didn't win sometimes you get I get a text on here and can come in from overseas or other brothers right here in the states I was getting ready to go and Minister there on Friday and I don't know if you know brother Mike brother Mike altag but Pastor there in Nutbush South Carolina and he was on his way to do a funeral and he and his wife were in a very bad car accident and you hear the things that brother Mike was going through and the situations not knowing he's going to make it not knowing what was going on and you hear things it's something about it that touches our hearts as as as believers when you hear someone else that's going through something I don't know it just it always grips me you know I look at it many ways [Music] it's like for my own children I'd love to take everything from them [Music] you know there's situations that right here this young man right here playing the piano went through on his job some of them situations caused the hair on Daddy's neck to stand up and daddy wanted to go in there but I know he's got to be able to stand on his own two feet and what I had to put he didn't need daddy going in there and making him out to be a little boy but he needs to know there's one who's greater than daddy and he also needs to know that their circumstances you go through in life that you need to go through them you need to go through them and make sure who you are but what I wanted to do it killed me to see it y'all know what I'm talking about his parents killed me to see him as a pastor kills me but it does that way to a body does it not what what if I could what if I could lift every test in every trial what if I could do that my goodness what a sorry bunch of people we'd be we wouldn't be fit for the throne for nothing right we wouldn't be fit but I'm glad that God has given us something that's greater than me just saying let me take that from you because you know in reality he's already born he has already carried it I don't have to carry it but what I can do and we can do is go in prayer because the reality is when we sense that even within a body Sometimes some things that you can see sometimes and you enter in in prayer God be with sister so and so be what brother you just you just isn't something maybe you you see something you're saying what do you do enter in prayer let me tell you the greatest thing we can do is be in prayer for one another because somewhere along the line we're going to be in a valley and we're going to be back up we're going to meet back up we're going to need people who's praying for us I'm glad I'm glad that I'm part of a body I'm glad I'm part of the body of Jesus Christ but I'm glad I'm part of a local body where people love me care for me pray for me and Hold Me Up Before the Throne of God I'm glad that there's there's family there's we're able to take notice of one another and say God be with sister so and so be with brother so and so Lord be with them Lord strengthen them Lord I'm glad for that aren't you God's brought us together that way he's still god of the valley same God that is Victorious on the mountain is the same God in the valley amen let's sing that course one more time before we dismiss God still God in the valley s go wrong [Music] and the god of the day he still got in the night [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
