look different i can actually see you now so and we that's kind of goes without saying anything um actually before all that came about i actually had already made plans to come here tonight with announcement then everything started rolling in yesterday so uh uh so celebration started a little early but um anyhow we're just thankful to the lord and i want to say this that um for anyone and this is for some that are not here even and streaming if you know at any time and throughout times if you want to wear a mask you're more than welcome to wear a mask that's that's your choice um but i want to say um you know as far as that it won't be anything we won't be doing that that's that's that's done with and um so i don't even have to look out there where y'all preaching and you know what you guys most you're wearing them like chin straps anyhow that's okay i understand i've sat there with it with through it also um but but anyhow i want to say this on on a positive note i think brother bryan was so excited he forgot to do prayer requests tonight so when he sing the song thank god he set me free he had a lot of meaning in it but we just want to also remember and i want to say this to you i i really i i want to say thank you because this has been quite quite a journey that even that we've been through and it's not then through this when this sickness and things have you know come about within the last year and things like that it's it's been quite a journey that uh really that we've we've not been through uh before or anything and there's a lot of different decisions that had to be made and and i realized within the different decision i want to say to each of you is i certainly appreciate is how that you've handled that and you've taken that and even you know to be here you know to realize that you know it was something that you responded to the leading of the holy spirit here you are you've been here we've had to pray through and find the mind of the lord in different times and when to go into service when to do this and that's really been a reality is that trying to just find the mind of the lord and what to do and different things like that some things done just to try to make people feel comfortable and and so forth but i want to say that i just really appreciate that because that speaks a lot to you of how that within it you caught something that was beyond brother samuel and you caught the leading of the holy spirit and god leads us in times like this this is where we need to know and hear his voice and so these are things that's very very important and i want to just say i really appreciate how that you you handle things you know throughout the time and different things that was asked of you know it wasn't convenient but i really really appreciate that and i want to just say thank you from the bottom of my heart we also want to continue to remember the different ones in in india and some of the other countries and things like that that they um they are dealing with this very thing that we've come through and they are are dealing with some of that and so we just we want to continue to remember them in prayer um brother samson shetty i brought that request to you his his mother you know she's there in at home and uh the brother-in-law as well so we just want to continue to keep them in prayer and that um i haven't had any other reports coming in i've been to some other brothers and things like that where things have come on different text threads that i'm a part of but you know god has just been merciful uh to the to the brothers and sisters and i tell you what when you you catch a little video i don't look at much i i really don't i i don't i don't look at much much out there at all but one brother had sent me a video and so i went ahead and i looked at that video and you see the different setups that's in those other countries i tell you what you see things it's just so absolutely antiquated it's so sad of how things are within the hospitals and the different places like that it's you tell you what one thing i could do when i looked at that i said god i'm thankful for america and even when i've been overseas and other places like that from the different things that we have and availability for things like that and really appreciate that so we want to remember those in india and other places i also understood in south africa they had have been experiencing some different things as well that's there and so we just want to continue to remember them in prayer uh throughout this this this whole thing as well um i want to welcome brother david holdren here with us he's back there in the corner it's good to have brother david here with us and we just just appreciate that as well with the prayer request as we get ready to take these requests to the lord in prayer i want to remember brother joshua he's conversing with him today and he's just at different times at night uh just going through some pain and discomfort trying to get a position to sleep in and you know he's walks a little bit he's walking on his own but he gets he gets really tired very quickly and so he goes for some x-rays and things i think it is tomorrow so we want to just continue to hold our brother up in prayer that god will continue to give him strength throughout he's been through quite a process and that god will also be just help him to get rest as well in his body and also within these requests that are here we have a request from sister mercy says for a healing touch for sister margie and that's the lord would just move for her a prayer for salvation of of my children also keep the perez family in your prayers from sister gomes please pray for carmelo and his family salvation of all of our unsaved loved ones from brother from brother bill says please pray for me i will find the lens for my glasses and i need your prayers god knows so let's remember that i i know god directs us to things like that that we've lost i'm glad about that aren't you i know all these little apps and things they have now but i'm glad that before those apps and now even with the abs and after we've got jesus amen i'm glad that he he can guide us and direct us into those times also request please pray for israel and for for jerusalem we want to remember them in prayer as well and i'll tell you we're really living in a in a late hour you see everything that's taking place and my goodness it's uh you just see it collapsing all around you but in the midst of it all i'm glad we've got an anchor we've got a promise that we're holding to in every word and what god has said god is faithful to back up that promise amen and we we've received that that announcement from the lord shalom and so we just we're thankful for that aren't we no matter what comes shalom no matter what we stand with him amen so if we could tonight would you stand with me and let's just take these requests before we invite brother jim to the pulpit maybe if you have an unspoken request you just want to make known by an uplifted hand also thinking about brother ray hernandez comes to my mind right now as well heavenly father dear god you're a mindful a mindful god lord your one lord who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities lord jesus each one of these requests lord many different needs some lord for family others for healing lord you're guarding for the nation of israel their lord dear god you see father each one of these requests lord some of those countries lord that are still lord and dealing with lord some of the lord and parts of this virus lord god i pray lord jesus for each and every one of these lord god as we just place them on the altar of god then lord you would just move lord for each one of these needs lord in a very special way lord there's needs behind the uplifted hands lord of your children lord tonight and dear god i pray that lord you would just minister to their hearts lord in a special way lord god sometimes lord father it's lord where we receive the answer lord and there's other times right then and there lord god we receive lord not only answer but lord what needs to take place right there but either way dear god we can rejoice lord to know that lord as we take these petitions before you lord jesus you said if we ask anything in your name that you'll do it lord and father so we're asking for each one of these requests lord we lift them up before your throne father and ask that you would just touch each and every one in a special way father lord we love you and we thank you tonight father in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen as we invite brother brother jim schumer i want to just had it on my heart for some time to have brother jim over some of you know brother jim some of you don't brother jim pastors the group there in erie albion pennsylvania just just almost right across the border there in pennsylvania right off of 90 there and brother jim's just been a just been a real good friend he's just uh you'll find out he's just got just a wonderful spirit and uh just just a wonderful brother always enjoyed the times of fellowship the times we've had on the phone we've been there to be with the assembly there a few a year ago a few years ago whenever that was and i believe you'll really be blessed by the by the ministry and we just want to pull on the gift of god and we know that that gift that god has placed there that gift is for us we just want to be able to hear his voice and what god has to say to us tonight so whatever your need is whatever question is whatever it is god is here god is faithful and god is mindful of our needs tonight so we just want to invite brother jim and just ask him just to take his liberty i told him i said you're at home i said we we just we just love the lord we love the word and we just want to pull we just want to receive from the lord tonight don't leave amen your amens ought to be a lot more clear you ought to have much more of an incentive to say amen and hallelujah and glory to god but listen to what he says just don't get caught up but we're very thankful to the lord amen let's sing that let's sing the song amazing graces brother jim would come [Music] amen [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] are you glad for his grace tonight thank you lord [Music] daily let's praise him a little bit tonight let's pray [Music] break down praise god oh praise god praise [Music] amen he's surely worthy of all our praise tonight amen nothing we could do and more than praise him amen for all he's done for us amen thank god for his goodness amen i thank god for the privilege to be here tonight i appreciate the invitation of your pastor and the confidence that he would place to allow me to come and stand behind this sacred desk i know what that's like when you invite ministers to come and minister the word of god i told samuel i said you're building a church here not tearing one down i meant why you called me i mean so i told him i feel like the least of the least uh we have a small church there in pennsylvania uh maybe run i don't know when everybody's there and all the kids we we might run 120 people and uh we're just not a big group and uh they have mercy on me man and uh they love me so they put up with my faults and my failures but uh i mean i pray that you love me tonight and i can get away with they meant some faults tonight amen i just want to bring greetings from a little church there in pennsylvania i ministered last night to them and then had a real good crowd on wednesday night and i would ask if you would remember sister mary spring in your prayers she just came through an operation this afternoon they uh she'd had a brain operation for a brain aneurysm and she was having some complications with the drain at the top of her head and they couldn't get that thing to quit so they took the drain out and they put a shunt in her her head down into her stomach and uh got a got a um text just before i got to the church tonight that the operation went better than it could ever have been expected it was perfect i mean a lot of people were praying i asked if you would continue to keep her in your prayers uh brother john says she was sleeping he wouldn't respond to his talking but they said that's that's normal amen after having just come through the operation so if you would amen please keep her in your prayers that god would just bring her through completely heal i'm not going to believe for anything less than complete healing and i know my god's a healer and i've seen him healed before i've seen him healing my own body and the prophet of god said he won't heal one person one time and then not heal someone else he wouldn't be god is that right so i know he's going to do the same thing for our sister tonight so if you would just keep praying your prayers and and again i bring greetings from the church there if you have your bibles tonight i want to get right into the word of god i asked brother samuel how long he usually preaches on wednesday night i know we have some brothers that work all day from the wee hours and and sometimes i look back there and i see a couple of them going like this when i'm preaching they're saying hurry up brother jim yeah amen get that over with something amen i understand i'll try to have mercy on you tonight and try to keep it brief so that we don't wear you out so first john chapter 3 if you have your bible first john chapter 3 beginning at the first verse i've been preaching a series back home for about a month or so and on some different things and i leave it and come back to it but i looked at the thought that i've been preaching on is uh it's time to recognize that we are sons of god it's time to recognize the weird how many sons of god we got here tonight amen it's time that we recognize that because we're getting down we're getting down to the end of things here and i don't know about you but a son has privileges that nobody else has we're going to look at that tonight if we could for just a few moments amen first john chapter 3 verse 1. and read like this behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now i like that it doesn't say going to be doesn't say someday it says beloved now we are the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is every man that has this hope in him purifyeth himself even as he is pure let's just ask the lord to bless the reading of his word heavenly father god we bow our heads before you tonight grateful once again to be in the house of god among brothers of like precious faith lord we pray tonight lord god that you would just take the words that you've laid upon my heart lord and and i ask that you would take this thought lord god bless it to the hearing of the people i ask once again lord as i do so many times guard my lips father lest i would say something wrong but father let everything be said to bring this little portion of the body of christ closer to you lord god that's our heart's desire that we might mature and come become that perfected bride that you said you're coming back for he said be perfect lord amen the other way we can be perfect not sinless perfection but as we come to maturity realizing that we are sons of god tonight we pray lord god that you would just guard my lips as i said lord let me say only that which would edify the body of christ lord if there's one here tonight that's sick let them receive their healing as the word of god comes forth there's one here that's downtrodden lord god lift up those hands that hang down lord god lift up that head lord god to the redemption that drawing knives so well so god we pray tonight that you just have your way into service be with those who aren't here tonight for whatever the reason would be that we keep them from the house of god and minister unto them in a special way and we'll be careful to praise you for it all in jesus precious name amen and amen you can be seated this evening amen i just want to i've been i've been preaching a little series on recognizing that we are the sons of god and and uh i just this is one of the messages i preached at home and there were several of them and i just couldn't go decide which way to go and then i was working on a completely different message that i hadn't preached yet and i just started getting panicked thinking about coming i don't i don't go out and preach i'm not one of these roving preachers i mean i preached to my people i preach to my people and like i said they have mercy upon me and they they just overlook my faults and my shortcomings and so i don't go out so i was a little nervous and trying to put that thought together i said no i'm just going to lay that aside and i started on another one i laid that aside and brother samuel and i were talking back in the study there sometimes you don't know where you're going until you get to the pulpit sometimes you're not quite sure and i wasn't quite sure today until i jumped in the car and headed this way and i grabbed the right message i hope so by god's grace i want to speak to you tonight on it's time to recognize that we are sons of god now i like that the word of god says amen am i too loud for you is that hurting your ears or anything okay i got these hearing aids and everything sounds loud to me so amen i don't want to hurt somebody's ears and amen so anyways what we're looking at here tonight it says now we are the sons of god amen what what uh what what love the father has that he would call us his son amen isn't that great to be the son of a son of god amen to be his son tonight hey you know as i say my son and brother samuel's sons they have certain privileges that nobody else has amen there's his his sons they can go to their dad and they can fully well expect him a man to to supply their needs they go to the table hey man guess what brother samuel has the table set they never have to say well brother samuel's wife has a table set they never have to say dad is it okay if i eat no that's a privilege of being a son you just come and feed oh what a privilege we have tonight as sons of god that we can just come here can i take this off brother samuel sure man all right amen i can't i can't fight with a coat on and we're going to fight the devil tonight is that all right amen but but you know we have a right to as a son of god we have privileges that nobody else has amen you don't have the same privileges that samuel's sons back there have amen i don't have the same privileges as his sons have but i am not a son of brother samuel browning i'm a son of jesus christ tonight and i have privileges tonight amen but you know the prophet of god said we live below our privileges how many believes that tonight we live so far below our privileges amen we look at this and we say oh now i'm a son of god it sure don't appear like you're one brother jim i saw what you did last i i've seen the mistake amen i look at my own self and i say oh i could not be his son i could not be a son and think what i thought i could not be his son he made on the way here tonight some guy tried to cut me off and i didn't think his son's thought all right i said oh surely i'm not a son of god amen it doesn't matter what you think it doesn't matter what you say quit living below your privileges and realize it's what god said and god said i'm a son now amen how many believes that tonight it's not when you get good enough it's not when you quit making mistakes it's not when you it may get to the point where you say well now i'm doing a pretty good job then you've lost it then you've really missed it right but church i mean it says here now i'm a son of god amen and sometimes we all how many of them always feel like a son of god i don't always feel like when i'd like to brother hey but tell me you're sick i want to get with you after church amen i don't always feel like a son and therefore when i don't feel like one i start living below my privilege and say well i just don't dare come to the father with that need or i don't dare come to the father with this need hey he knows how he knows how i messed up on the way to samuels all right come on brother come on church how many knows it nobody else messed up on the way to church today did they nobody else made a mistake today or last week or or did or thought something you shouldn't have thought what if we're looking at our own flesh we're looking at this old man amen but god's not looking at the flesh he's looking at our sacrifice tonight how many say amen to that he's not looking at that so we get discouraged we say oh when am i going to be a son the bible says i'm the son now i don't feel like a son now it doesn't matter what you feel it's what god's word says is that right it's not what you feel it's what god's word said brother brahm said this in a message of the eye of servants we would see jesus is it okay i don't have an ipad i'm an old guy hey man i'm going to go oh there it is i told brother samuel i wish i had an ipad my office is stacked with messages with me like this amen amen i got 15 years worth of them stacked up in there and then some i mean but anyhow i'm i'm whipping up my ipad tonight here's what the prophet of god said the message called service we would see jesus it might encourage you i want to encourage you a little bit as christians amen amen and i need some encouragement sometimes because i don't feel like a son of god how many believes it tonight amen amen he said the bible said the bible said that our names were written in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world how many believes that tonight i believe it's over in first peter or something like that he was the lamb slain he redeemed us as the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world amen amen and then over in corinthians i think in some place he says the same thing he says we were predestinated amen it was in galatians ephesians amen it's a fear we were predestinated to be sons of god amen i'm not having to work into it it's not something i'm going to accomplish i was predestinated from before the foundation of the world god saw me and you as a son amen amen that's right oh i like that yes amen so let me encourage you a little brother branham said the bible says our names were written on that lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world when was it when the lamb was slain every person that was ever to be saved was associated with that lamb in the slaying before the foundation of the world oh i like that i look at myself and i look at myself today and i don't feel like a son that god says oh i saw you as a son from before the foundation of the world oh i like that church it's not what i see it's what he sees you're going to believe something you're going to believe what you see or you're going to believe what the word says i choose tonight to believe what god's word said i want to be encouraged as a son tonight amen the bible says our names were written there amen the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he said that's the one that that the one thing that i find out that's wrong with the church today he said i found one thing wrong boy i mean i'm glad he i wish he could just only find one thing wrong with this part of the church he said but i find one thing wrong with the church today he says they're afraid to claim their position as a son he says they back up it doesn't understand its privileges like i said samuel's children have privileges that nobody else has i mean why because they're his sons we have privileges as sons of god that nobody else in the world has tonight oh i like that he says the bible teaches us that we are placed as sons and as as placed sons have all the authority of the father how many knows brother man preaches many many times on the placing of the son amen he says oh you're born again amen when the holy spirit comes in you're born again have a born again experienced by the holy spirit he said then you are his son but he said you're not placed in that position as a son hey but until there's a ceremony till you get to the point amen where god looks at you and he says that's my son that's the way he's doing everything like i would have him do amen and you know when he saw me doing everything he would have he knew before the foundation of the world oh church that holy spirit my brother said that's the placing of the son yeah he comes down and robes you in that robe of righteousness and he said there now you're my son amen i like that amen and you know what happened brother brown said when that son became a son he had all the authority of the father in his name whatever the father could do he could do if the father amen could come down and heal someone amen i have that same healing living in me amen as a son of god tonight somebody believes this if he could forgive someone of their sins he said i forgive you hey guess what i can do the same thing tonight i can find forgiveness as a son i mean no matter what i do no matter what i say no matter how many times i mess up i can run to the father and he says okay son amen it's okay yes amen yes sir when i get sick in my body guess what at the place done i have all the authority of the father amen amen how many ever seen one time that jesus amen ever did not heal someone that needed heal right he went about doing good healing the bible says all that were afflicted of the devil that's right is that right yeah church everyone that was afflicted of the devil he said he healed him amen amen church amen if he healed him then he'll heal him now amen how many how many believes that tonight i have the same authority to lay my hands on the brother the sick and say amen they said the word of god said call the elders let them lay hands on the sick and they shall be healed amen yes sir how many believes that tonight that's the authority of the son amen that ought to encourage you a little bit jesus but you know what we look at ourselves and we see this corruption we see this old body my brother man says you know what you don't really see me he said you just see this old house that i'm living in is that right yeah he said the real me on the inside the real seed gene of god on the inside you don't see that guy right amen that's the guy that god sees he don't see this old body he sees that redeemed seed on the inside how many are faithful for that tonight amen he says oh there we are we live so far beneath our privileges that god has ordained us to live we because we are now not will be when you get rid of all these problems in this place no he says you are now the son of god but now you're the sons of daughters of god he says he said now we try to put that off in the millennium some place how many knows that's the truth oh one day over there one day when i get dropped this old corruptible robe of flesh amen and put on that incorruptible then i'll be a son no he sees you as a son right now oh i like that yeah what a privileged people amen once i'm placed as a son once i'm filled with that holy spirit heaven once i'm robed in that robe of righteousness hey man you know what the bible tells me it means i've got a full pardon amen from all this mess that i'm in here amen oh brother jim you preach like that you'll give people license to live any way they want amen if you really got the baptism of the holy ghost you won't want to live like that amen that's right that right that's right amen yes sir i don't i like i read after charles spurgeon i don't know anybody ever read after charles spurgeon i like charles spurgeon boy i get some real enthusiastic or get some real enthusiasm for him i get some real unction from him and so many times i find him saying the same thing that the prophet said yes or the prophet in him agree so many times but it brother uh charles spurgeon was preaching about the sons of god amen and he said when you become a son of god you receive a full pardon yes amen is that right yes you receive the full pardon of jesus christ when you become a son there is therefore now no condemnation amen you can come to the father amen oh what a privilege it is to come to the father as a son amen yes amen amen amen behold what matter of love the father has bestowed upon us he's quoting virgin is quoting the scriptures we read in first john consider who we were and what we are ourselves and even now the corruption that's in us and we'll doubt our place as an adopted son we'll doubt our place when we look at the corruption but don't look at that god don't look at that he looks at the blood amen amen is that right he looks at you and he says i don't see all that i see a son from before the foundation of the world i saw you as a son looks at that and oh what a privilege that gives us to know that the father loves me that much that he he look over my faults amen he looks past all that he said why he said because i sent my son to die for all that stuff amen i like what he said i'm free i have a full pardon from all that we're all what a privilege it is to come to the father as a son what kindness and tenderness i can come and expect the father amen to forgive me yes amen even when i make a mistake i'm still his son amen well i like that all right amen i have a son amen his name is jim poor guy they say he acts just like i do amen you know what i'm taking on his he's got my dna come on i got the blood of god in me i got the spirit of god in me he's got my spirit in him he acts like i do he looks like i do the poor fella amen the church that's the way we ought to be looking a little bit more like our father every day how many believes that tonight he said oh but i can come to the father when my son makes a mistake and he made a lot of them when he's grown up i hope he's not watching but he made a lot of mistake we all do but when he come home i wouldn't say out of here you rascal you you renegade get out of here i can't believe you did that i wanted to do that [Music] but you know what he was my son and he knew he could come say dad i i messed up i i don't want you to look out in the driveway but the truck has smashed all the pieces oh my god three times you know what i said they'll make another one they'll make another one you gotta learn to be more careful but what it was a tenderness between the father and the son that's what we have a privilege to come to our father and have that same tenderness that same forgiveness amen and oh how the father amen how we can expect that ten years from the fat what a privilege that brings to us as sons amen yes but spurgeon says and oh what love the father feels towards the son yes he knows the son could feel the love of the father but you know what the father has a love for that son unless you have a son you'll never know what it's about and you would do anything to see to it that that son was all right yes he said and he's already done that for us tonight he's already placed us in that position of the son amen that's oh i like that he said beloved now are we the sons of god it's easy to say but it's not always easy to feel like i'm the son of god because i see how i mess up i see when i wreck the car i see when i make a wreck of this amen but that's not it yes he said we put this off in the millennium oh someday i'll get good enough someday i'm gonna no we just have to simply take my faith what god says we are tonight amen it's not what i'm going to be it's not what i'm going to attempt to be i mean you could never be good enough come on but we look at ourselves and we say oh one day i'm going to be a son of god but that's not what the bible says the bible says i am a son now amen oh well you sure don't look like one when you lose your temper you sure don't look like one when you do this you notice i don't care what i look like the bible says over in ii corinthians that we look not at the things which are seen he said but we look at the things which are not seen he said the things that you see those are just temporal things amen but the things which are not seen that old life on inside that sunshine it says that's eternals tonight amen how about you but i like that but looking at what you see quit looking at your mistakes a bit and look at what he said about you amen amen have faith in what god's word said bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen i got faith in god's word that i'm a son tonight yeah he said oh brother jim you don't look like a son if i come and said to my church i mean they all know me you know some of you might not know me but i make mistakes sometimes i say things wrong instead of staying a smartphone one time right over the pulpit i said i just turned those two words around and the whole church erupted i lost my whole service right there i said i couldn't believe i said that they all laugh said preach on brother preach him you might have a fart small but we all have smartphones and i hope i didn't lose you too amen but i make mistakes but quit looking at your mistakes and look at the words i'm a son regardless of the mistakes i'm making here oh i like that he says we're imperfect this is what the prophet of god said this is a message called abraham said he says we are all imperfect amen so if you think you're perfect tonight amen either you're wrong or the prophet's wrong sorry i'm gonna take your word right amen we're imperfect we're no good we're born in sin shaped with iniquity come to the world speaking lives we're no good to begin with amen wow and i'm a son you're no good to begin with but here's what i like he's not looking at me he's looking at my sacrifice oh i like that i mean you know back in the in the day they used to have the blood sacrifice they'd they'd have to get a perfect sacrifice they had to get a perfect little dove or a perfect little lamb and they'd take that to the high priest to take it in if you take the blood in behind the mercy seat you know the story but what did they do they take that little lamb they take that little sacrifice of that little dub and they bring it down and say is this all right never one time did that appreciate just a second let me see you don't have much hair buddy hey wait a second your shoulders are just wide they didn't look at you they didn't they looked at the sacrifice amen i didn't care what i did what i looked like they looked at my sacrifice that's what made the difference oh i like that glory amen aren't you glad we got a sacrifice tonight that placed us as disciple before the foundation of the world he was slain before the foundation of the world for my problems for my sin for my iniquity that's why i can be a son now because he did it before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah glory oh church what a privilege it is to be a son tonight what a privilege it is to be a sunday tonight yeah the scripture said he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world how many believes that tonight you find that over in first peter amen he says we're not redeemed with corruptable thing but with we're from gold silver people it says but we're redeemed with the precious blood of christ the lamb without blemish without spa who was verily for ordained before the foundation of the world to be my sacrifice oh i like that and he purposed yes amen at that time when he did that he did it for a purpose the book of ephesians says he says he had chosen us in him before the foundation rule that we should be holy without blame before him in love amen he had a purpose for that son died he had a purpose for that lamb being slave so that i could be a perfect son of god in him in all my imperfections amen he predestinated us to the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself amen yes when did he do that brother jim before the foundation of the world before i ever made my first mistake before i ever thought the first strong thought amen before i ever and then fumbled again and stripped up again and made a mistake again amen he did it before then amen how many are glad for that amen therefore i can go forth as a son amen i can go forth and i can defeat the enemy they've been in my own flesh i can defeat the enemy in my own life amen how many knows we can tonight amen amen the true sons of god that have truly been placed as sons of god that are trusted in the blood of jesus christ the prophet of god said over the revelation series he said now remember that christ in the true church the true sons of god he said they will be a continuation of the book of acts how many knows he said that church what did they do when they came down in the book of acts when they came down out of that upper room they had power over the enemy that guy was defeated they went up there amen they went they went up there imperfect they came down their place as sons amen with all the authority of the father they walk down silver and gold don't i have but i give you what i have i have the authority of the father rise up and walk in america church that authority has been given to you as sons tonight amen amen if the people if we could just get that readily we just have faith that we are what the word of god says we are sons probably god said this and that same quote he said if the people get the true revelation of the true church the true sons of god and what she is she will stand and she can stand and do the greater works she will become an invincible army oh church i like it i hear somebody i hear people preach we're going to be coming invincible we're going to come i want to say we're not going to become one i say we are one amen but we just haven't got the revelation i am now a son amen you get that revelation church look out devil that's right even look out devil amen amen your head's coming off amen amen you're coming down tonight yes sir how many believes that tonight with the true revelation of our lights the prophet of god said the gates of hell can't prevail over us but we will prevail over them amen because we are heir to all the authority of the father when we realize that we are a son tonight amen oh i like that he says what do we have to fear we say oh i just i just i don't know if i'm ever going to make it i fear that i'm never going to make it a bit probably god said don't fear don't fear remember john over revelation said don't fear john that's right don't fear john page 64 of the church age book what brother brandon say don't fear john i say don't fear little flock i say don't fear little son of god amen he said all that i am as a son you are heir to you are heir to as a son all that i am you are here to tonight do you realize that the implications of that all that he is i'm an heir to it how come because i was placed as a son tonight now i'm a son church we live so far below our privileges as sons of god tonight amen we let the devil push us off in a corner somewhere oh you're when you get good enough no i was made good enough to the blood thank you lord glory all that i am i you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours i stand in your midst amen i have not come to bring you fear of failure but love courage and ability the power is all power listen all power is given unto me he says you believe that do you believe there's any power greater than the omnipotent god all power is given unto him as my father but guess what as a son as a son of god tonight i'm heir to all of that amen all that my out my power's given to me it's yours to use you speak the word you speak the word and i will perform it i don't have to worry about performing i'm just going to speak what the word says the word says i'm a son i'm going to say wait a second devil i'm a son you're trespassing at my house my father's house now it's time for you to leave hallelujah you're trespassing in my father's house my mind i mean the battle's not going to go any further i got the victory did i get out of here quick quit tormenting my mind i got the victory tonight as a son hallelujah amen it's a covenant that cannot fail glory you realize where we are sons of god tonight we have another failing covenant pronounced upon us amen with all the power of god upon us yes if i'm a son but the problem is that little doubt comes creeping back in yeah oh you surely couldn't be a son yeah i saw what you that was that's an outright sin brother jim that's an outright you just didn't believe god's word when you did that yeah you just didn't believe god's word amen wait a second wait a second the bible says though your sins being scarlet right amen though your sins be as scarlet he says my sins might be scarlet in your eyes tonight all right you know that's true amen what's worse your sins might be scarlet in your own eyes right right that's looked in the mirror one time he said there's the worst enemy that old william brown has right there's the guy that condemns me the most there's the guy that i have the most trouble with yes sir i mean oh i say oh i surely couldn't be a son and think that i did that it then church it doesn't matter what you look like the bible says though your sins being scarlet amen i want to tell you one thing prophet god said they might be scarlet your sins might be scarlet he said but there is a red streak of blood running down through the word of god from genesis to revelation and he says when you look at red through red all you see is white tonight i like that yeah i mean red through red is white amen though your sins be a scarlet god looks through the blood of jesus christ he looked at the sacrifice he said they're white as though hallelujah amen glory curse that you feel a little more like a son now yeah amen he doesn't see my sins anymore when you confess your sin and claim the blood of jesus christ for those sins amen the sin problem is over church the sin problem is over they said when was it over the moment you believed hey the moment you believed what the word said the moment you were placed as a son when you put your trust in the blood the sin problem is over he said god is looking through red and he sees you just as white as he sees you it's just like he said here in first john i see you as a son with all the privileges of the son god looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed amen now you know when you redeem something that means you have to buy it back that doesn't mean you never did make a mistake that didn't mean you never win we're out in sin but he said he redeemed you amen when did he do that from before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain i have always been a son in the mind of god amen church him and it's our own mind where the battle brother said that's where the greatest battle has ever fought is right in the mind amen yes sir oh i couldn't ever i'll never make it no you'll never be good enough but he was amen he was a perfect sacrifice glory amen that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect and sinless perfection we're perfect in his the eyes of god because why because we are found in him under the blood amen amen that's the reason he said be perfect your father heaven is perfect amen i'm not perfect that shocked some of you i but i got a big amen if i'd have been preaching at home i'm not perfect in your sight he said you may not be perfect in my sight all right he said what about god's sight all right god says you're a perfect son of god tonight that's right he says there's where it lays if you're born again into the body of christ then god looks at you as a perfect son of god amen perfect as christ was himself amen he says we all say amen i'm perfect oh church i may quit condemning myself saying i'll never be a son he already said you're a son i'm not perfect in your side nothing you can do to get you perfect there's nothing you can do to bring you to perfection amen he says no it's only if it could only be done by works he says you can't do nothing at all it's by grace through faith in the shed blood of jesus christ that he sees you perfect in heaven amen god has given you this offer amen but it's up to you to accept it it's up to me to accept my faith what he says i am tonight have you trusted in the blood then he says you're a son if you trusted in the blood that was shed before the foundation then you always were a son he said that's right he says there you are christ was he says he looks at you as perfect as christ was himself nothing you can do he made it only by the grace to the faith in the shed blood of jesus christ that's the offer that you have to accept in his sight your perfect ahead washed by the blood of the lamb without thought without blemish without spot by grace you're saved through faith amen in the shed blood of jesus christ aren't you glad for that amen i'm not i'm not perfect i'm not i'm not a son because i believe god sent a prophet come on now i'm not son because i can quote all the quotes i'm not son because i never make a mistake i'm a son because i'm in him so that i was placed in him it is for the foundation of the world but the reason we have all the struggles that we have the reason that brother brown said the church is backing up all the time and finding themselves feared in fact we're just like the apostle paul how many believes he was the son of god i surely hope you do amen i believe he was the son of god but you know he had the same problem he had the same oh what's that word that i want to say the complex that we have all right amen he got out there he says when i want to do good evil is present when i try to do something he says i do what i don't want to do when i when i want to do this i do something that i don't want to do he said oh it just goes on and on how many have ever felt like paul amen oh and i said i'm never going to do that again i'm never going to lose my temper again i'm never going to sass my mom again i'm never going to do this again and the next day boom right now all right all right come on brother why because i'm stuck in this old corruptable shell right here and as long as i'm there i mean brother brahm said this old sticky carnation will give you trouble until the day you lay it down amen and one day i'm going to lay it down but there's been a little seed transplanted into there of the son of god and when it comes forth it's going to come forth to notice the life as the son of god hallelujah it's not coming up with this old couple why because that life has been put out the spirit of god come down burned out that nature and put his nature in there amen hallelujah i'm a born again son of god amen the old wretched man that i am said paul who shall deliver me from this old wretched man that i am the bible says i thank god through jesus christ our lord amen amen but you might feel wretched but thank god through jesus christ the lord i've been placed as the son tonight there's therefore now no condemnation amen no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk after the who don't walk out of flesh but walk after the spirit amen that's right it's when that spirit come down brother says that's the adoption that's the placing the holy spirit that he wrapped him in that robe of righteousness amen he said this is my beloved son i'm out of transparent hear ye him amen and he gave us the same authority whatever you say he said i'll perform it amen that's a privilege of the son it meant all his authority is now in me how many believes that amen the savior's given us a full pardon a full pardon through his blood amen you have a right to approach the father as the son with all the authority of the father amen behind you amen brother branham said when that son was placed after the holy spirit was his tutor amen he said he's doing everything like you would do he he's just lining up with your word amen but when we line up with this word with this message and we just find ourselves lined up we're not going to say we're not going to make mistakes but we're lining up with the word when you make a mistake first john 1 9 confess your sins he's faithful just it's already taken care of amen how many believes it amen so we get to that place and we get to that place that we can put our trust in him put our trust in that what what the word says we are not what we see in ourselves not the mistakes that we see she keeps saying that brother jim but you know i think there's a lot of people that struggle with that very question right right yes if not brother brown would have said i see the church backing up all the time i see him in fear what do you got to be afraid of he said what do we have to be afraid of we are sons tonight hey you know what we're afraid of we're afraid of our old corruptable flesh we're afraid of what we see in ourselves that's right he said don't look at what you see look at what god sees quit acting like the prodigal son amen how many remembers the story of the prophet [Music] brother samuel you said 45 minutes i got six more minutes and i think i got about seven more here i'll try to get i'll try to get through this i only got a couple more pages is that okay hey man i can go on for more but i got i'll do a couple more pages and i'll and i'll let you your poor brothers at work thought they go home and get some rest and i gotta drive two and two hours to get home not two and a half two hours to get home amen anyhow quit acting like the prodigal son i said you know that was the prodigal son's problem maybe it wasn't that he wasn't the son he was he was born in the family as a son is that right we find this story over luke the 15th chapter i just like to share with you a little bit you get the idea what i'm trying to say here he said there was a certain man he said he had two sons and he said the younger of them said to his father give me the portion of goods that befalleth me and he delivered unto him his living he divided unto them his living you know what he did he gave me everything he had as a son that what he did he gave me all his i inherited everything he had but there is a son i got the riches of the father every one of us in here tonight son you've got the riches of the father you've got it with you but how many have ever used it all wisely all right that's good listen to what he said he said after many days the younger son gathered all together took a journey into a far country he got away from his father and the bible says he wasted his substance with righteous living in that old corrupted flesh nature i know none of you have ever done that but it took me a long time to realize i was a son i looked back and i could see the wasted years that i had oh you young people that were born in a messy church you young people that have been having cut your teeth on a messy pew young people had an experience at their young age oh thank god that you didn't waste what you had in righteous living amen everybody you know i hear the young people somebody say oh this guy gets up and gives a testimony how god did this for him this guy i don't have a testimony i heard a young person i just grew up in this what a testimony amen what a testimony you don't have to be ashamed of that old flesh you don't have to be held back and say oh you couldn't be a son i always was a son in there that's a testimony tonight amen thank you lord but this son wasted every hat and righteous living he said he said and a famine grew in the land how many believe there's a famine in the land now for the hearing of the word of god he said and he went and joined himself to the center of the country and began to feed the swines in the field and it would feign had filled his belly with a husband the swine did he and but no man gave unto him he was in bad shape [Music] a son in that kind of shape with everything the father had laid in his lap that's where we find ourselves sometimes all right but did it change the fact that he was a son i'm not a bit no you know what kept him in that pig pen his own mind you know what keeps you in the bondage that you're in you know what keeps you sick you know what keeps you even thinking i'm not a son but the word says i am he says right up here he wanted to go home he whoa he said i'm stunned i'm dying for a good old i'm going for brother samuel to preach me a good old message that i can just feed on amen he said oh he would have filled his belly but no man would give unto him church i'm here to tell you there's one that will give you if there's one here that'll feed you tonight yes amen who is it it's the father and when he realized he quit looking for man to feed him he quit looking for his own self defeating he quit looking for his own self to be he said no man would give him anything church amen you're not going to get what you need from a man tonight you're going to get what you get tonight what you need tonight from the one who was slain from before the of the world amen amen that's what this man come to that's the revelation that that's the faith that the son had to come to tonight that's what all of us got to come to amen he said when he came to himself you know what it was a lot of us need to come to ourselves tonight how many believe that he said he when he came to himself all of a sudden he realized wait a second the scripture said now i'm a son of god what am i doing in this paper now i'm the son of god amen i put myself in that pig pen we put ourselves in that condition we stay sick because we don't believe the authority we have as a son to cast that thing off us we stay in sin and we stay discouraged because we see our mistake it may cast that thing off without the authority of the father with you tonight amen amen the bible says he came to himself he meant the faith in who he was started to trickle down and if i wait a second i'm the son of god hey man wait a second i'm a son he said how many hired servants in my father's house have bread to spare and i perished with hunger i like this part right here he says i will rise i will rise church it's time for this bride to rise up tonight amen i'm going to rise out of this old pig i'm going to rise out of this place that i have my health self-held amen and i will say to my father i have sinned against heaven and before thee amen what's he doing i don't know about you but this sounds like the heart of a repentant son amen how many have ever said oh god i did it again oh father oh forgive me he's not going to say oh i gave you everything and you wasted it said get out of here no he said he didn't do that amen he said if you would confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you he said they cleanse you from all unrighteousness not just some of them but all that unrighteousness that we hold ourselves i couldn't be a son like helen righteous i look amen come to confess to him and it's all taken care of under the blood i will rise and go to my father i will say to him father i have sinned against thee he says and i am no more worthy to be called your son there ain't one of us in here worthy to be called man oh but behold what manner of love the father has amen bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god regardless of our mess regardless of how many mistakes we've ever made he said i will go to him but he arose and went to his father he meant what was that i believe the holy spirit was dealing with that son i believe that holy spirit was dealing with that son there that pig pen and that mess that he was in i wonder tonight if the holy spirit isn't dealing with some people here tonight like he dealt with me when i come on this message amen i wonder if tonight didn't deal with some people saying hey it's time that you rise up above this thing it's time that you get out of that mess that you put yourself it's time that you get out of that old same pen that you put yourself into i didn't place you there i said you were a son amen amen i'm not worthy to be called a son there's not one of us we're all born and sin shaped and iniquity come to the world's speaking life but he doesn't look at that he looks at my sacrifice amen he said he rose and he came to his father it was yet a far way off his father saw him and had compassion he ran and fell on his neck and he kissed him i i was listening to a message or not a message a preacher preacher message on the on the radio once and i hope i don't lose my thought when i go here just popped into my head you mean look samuel that's why we preached so long to all that stuff that pops in our heads rabbit trails but listen to this guy amen he was from egypt and he's still on the radio i can't remember his name but anyhow it doesn't matter and then he has a radio ministry and i used to drive truck i go down the road and all night long i'd listen to that xm radio and all each preacher that would come on i'd listen to him some were so far out there in the left field but some of them had some good thoughts but i like this thought he said that scripture the prodigal son where he said his father ran to him his father ran to him he said he said you don't know the significance of that scripture until you have lived in egypt where this was written over in the country where in the middle east where this was written he said after a man was 30 years old amen to run was undignified to run and it was a disgrace but when he saw his son he didn't worry about disgrace he didn't worry about what people that can't worry about going to the cross was spit on his face he ran to me amen he ran to me and he gave me his life and then he gave me my thoughts for me oh church archer glad for a god who doesn't worry about the straight but he loved us enough the place that has a son oh i like that what i'm doing wrong here brother samuel but if i'm doing something wrong sorry amen he said i'm not worthy to be called your son he came to his father and he ran and kissed him and he said the son said to the father i've sinned against heaven and in thy sight he may see he's still putting himself in the pig pen i'm not worthy to be called your son oh just make me as one of your servants i just want something to eat i just want a little bit of morsel oh dad can i come and feast at the table oh church sometimes we come to church and be oh i'm not worthy of it but oh i sure hope brother samuel has something for me tonight i don't deserve it amen but oh no you do deserve it you're a son amen look what the father said to him just make me as a servant he said to the servants he says bring me the best robe not just some old dirty robe he says here he was in the condition he was in just fresh out of the pigpen he said bring me the best robe right in the conditions he's in i'm going to i see him repent i'm going to wrap him in a robe of righteousness bring me the best robe he put a rip put it on him put a ring on his hand shoes on his feet what was that rig that rig was a signature whatever he signed and then he could have it amen church amen whatever we want tonight amen we have the authority of god as sons of god we're heir to everything he had in you right amen bring him to the fatted calf kill him let us eat and be married for the son was dead is now alive he was lost and is now found it is and the bible says they began to be married maybe in church no more long faces oh i'm never going to make a son maybe over in the millennium someday no he was a son all along amen church i'm here to tell you tonight maybe you're a son i'll quit putting it off in the millennium someplace i mean tonight you're a son brother brown he you know how he always he tells the story so he can understand it he said i can just see the angel lord come to that boy i wonder if tonight if the angel of the lord isn't coming to some people here he said boy wake up boy it's time to wake up he talked to him and said oh he said what about you just get back to the father's house what about you just get back into the relationship of a son in your father's house where you belong amen what about that amen i wonder tonight at the father in the state of state what about you sons of god and get back in relationship with the father tonight he said oh think i think of my father all he has wealth he has and the things that he had he said he gave it all to me and here i am laying out here dying a hunger and a pink pen eating slop he said but the bible says he came to himself like all of a sudden he came to himself tonight church i hope this message helps some of us come to ourselves hey wait a second i'm a son i'm a son i put myself in this pink pen it's time that i lifted myself out of here by believing what god said i am tonight amen he said oh that's what the church needs to do today they need to come to the self to realize that we are sons to realize who your father is and sometimes we act like we don't even have a heavenly father how many say amen he said for the goodness of heaven belongs to the son to the church brother branson i said to the sons he says divine healing salvation freedom from worry that all belongs to the sons of god jesus died and we are heir to all that god was through him amen we are heirs of the kingdom amen didn't ever look up that word kingdom in the bible i know it's used many times but it says seek ye first the kingdom of god that word kingdom is a word called and i use it all the time at church if i was asked by church what does it mean they would all say basilia basilia it's a greek word amen i'm not a greek scholar i barely have a hard time with english amen but it says he says we are heirs to the kingdom when you look at that kingdom it's the word vasilia it says it means royal power it means dominionship it means kingship not to be confused with an actual kingdom but rather the right or the authority to rule over this kingdom amen church i'm so glad that he gave he made us heirs to the kingdom tonight i have a right to rule over this kingdom here that i'm in i have a right to rule over satan's eating i have a right to cast that devil of doubt out of my mind tonight because i'm a son i'm there to the kingdom amen i'm married to his power tonight amen i'm here everybody to say devil you have no right coming here and and trespass it upon my building amen get out amen amen we're going to come to a conclusion that's what brother brown says in this message i'm going to say musicians come i'm going to come to a conclusion tonight i went a little over brother samuel amen amen he says then here we come we're coming to a conclusion how many believe we are actually coming to a conclusion i mean not just in this service tonight how many believe we're coming down to the end of this thing amen if you are a son it's about time you recognize who you are amen while you still have a chance amen it's time to recognize that now we are the sons of god not will be not when we get good enough now we quit messing up amen he bet that was all taken care of even when he was slain before the foundation of the world he called me a son then he predestinated me to be placed as a son amen adopt you i was predestinated to that adoption place aren't you glad of that tonight amen he said we're coming to occlusion that eternal logos you can't do that with an ipad he said we're coming to occlusion that eternal logos god was manifest in the sun how may say amen he said and in jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he says and that eternal one was the father manifested in the flesh let's say amen and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts and then eternal in his thoughts before the foundation of the world of god's lord says is that right eternal his thoughts in our turn became a many-membered spoken word seed bride manifested in the flesh i become a son of god manifested in the flesh amen he said and those eternal thoughts now manifested in the flesh amen how many believes you were a thought and the father said well i would bless god i was no thought or an attribute you better say you were i was a thought and an attribute before the foundation of the world he saw me as a son amen that's how he thought of me that's how he thought of you yes amen he said there you were those eternal thoughts manifested in the flesh are now called the sons of god just like we are called tonight amen amen he said you did not become seed by the rebirth he said you were seed and therefore you could be reborn yes sir he says for only in the elect is there anything that can be reborn because there was seed there that's the reason you could be quickened because in non-seed there is nothing to quicken but because god put his seed in you before the foundation of the world amen he quickened it one day i came to myself and i said i'll realize i'm a son of god tonight amen how many are glad to be sons brother man thinks that think on this carefully he brought you back he brought you back into fellowship he saw you'd make a mistake but he said his son he's had him slain before the foundation world to redeem you tonight amen redeemed means to buy back to restore to the original owner god by his death and the shed blood brought us back to his home brought us back to being sons of god he brought back the spoken word seed bride son of god tonight amen through his blood amen he said that's why he said why do you do that because you always were a sheep you always were a son you weren't a pig or something out here and was changed into his son he said no that seed was always hidden that's why it could be reborn be reclaimed as a son he said we were in his thoughts of god and expressed to the flesh we have come today when we hear his voice the word and hear that voice something we can we become aware of the father calling us just like that prodigal son there was something he came to himself but one day he said i realized the fathers calling me to get out of this place and take my position as a son he recognized we recognize that we're sons of god how many remember when you come to that realization you recognize hey i'm a son of god tonight i'm a son of god tonight i'm a son of god tonight as a son of god i mean i have a right i have all the authority of the father behind me i like what he said about shamgar oh i'll never shut up and then i've got to quit but he said about shamgar you know what he was defeated he was hiding he was cowardly right amen but all of a sudden he remembered the promise hey wait a second i'm an israelite i'm a son of abraham i got to sign a circumcision on me those devils can't come against me he said he grabbed an old ox goat and he defeated him amen church say man we ought to grab ahold of the promise of god and defeat that devil today i'm a son [Music] there was a voice inside you called out just like it did to that prodigal son save me father i'm returning to do and he received us as a son aren't you glad tonight that he did that but i like this and i'm gonna close with this thought i mean you know what i was a brother ernest fulcher meeting to virginia one time the guy said i'm closing and i'm closing and i'm closing he closed for about an hour and the last time he said i'm closing brother samuel got up and he says you're closed let's say this let me close one more time that you had to know earnest full you you have to know ernest fuller to understand but i'm gonna close with this thought tonight [Music] he says it took me a long time it took that prodigal son a long time to re recognize that he was a son brother branham said a son of god can go a long time before he recognized he's a son how many read where he said that in the message but i liked what he said after that it really through my heart he says in fact a lot of true christians are like the story of that little baby eagle amen how many knows that eagles are the true sons of god amen he says you know eagle's the type of the true believer he said but you know the story of that little baby eagle said a farmer it made her pull a dirty trick he said he took that eagle out that egg out of an eagle's nest and he put it in there with the chickens and he says long about that chicken said all that may said along about time he said that that eggs all hatching that eagle hatched out and looked around and he says [Music] i just don't quite understand this something just don't quite feel right [Music] everybody's around like that and he said what in the world are you doing a little joke at our church i say to some of the brothers when their wife should pull up the people we're standing out there talking i go [Music] hey man i i gotta oh i want i can't go there nevermind i quit i was worried about having enough brother samuel i got too much amy you're saying go a long time before you recognize your son he said that little eagle hey man he didn't recognize that where he was at something was wrong amen he didn't realize he was an eagle he saw the chickens around he couldn't see himself he said man i he said that that old chicken would go i was in denominations and that guy would stand up and go [Music] what in the world is he talking about what the world is he talking about i told my wife one day i said man we got to go find some place to eat i said i can't i'm starving today that's right i read my bible and then he gets up and goes look good look and i said man there's something's wrong so i started looking i went here i went there i went to this one i got into some crazy messes hey man [Music] that's a new whole story i won't get into that but one day i told my wife i said oh my dad told me he says maybe what you're looking for it just isn't out i was in the nazarene denomination in case you didn't know he said my dad i sat on a board with my dad i was a sunday school teacher and a nazarene church i sit on the board of trustees with my dad in the nazareth church and i said dad something's just not right amen [Music] he said maybe what you're looking for just isn't out there maybe you're just looking for sensationalism i sure was we got a sensational god tonight and i know about you but i'm looking for sensation tonight so i was i was to the point of tears i went home one day i told my wife i said i don't know i just don't understand it i just don't understand and she says she said you know we went to school with a girl named margie smith my pastor was my pastor before me was herb smith that's who i come into the message under she said remember margie smith he said her dad's a pastor somewhere around here and bing my lights come on and i saw margie smith standing there dressed like the bride long smooth hair long dresses hey man they've had sleeves down to here hey man she come out there and she was always quiet and meek and peaceable i said where's that guy preach where's that guy go to hey man something in here i just can't get enough to eat hey man and i went to that church one night out on route 18. i went out to that church one night and the guy got up and he preached and he preached and he preached and i wasn't hearing cluck cluck i was here the scream of an eagle come out of that message you're in all of a sudden i realized guess what i ain't a nazarene i don't know quite yet what i am but i know i don't belong here i belong here amen and he kept saying that brother adam said this and brother branham said that and brother branham did this amen and afterwards i knew one of the brothers sam pitzenbar went to the church i got to he worked on the railroad where i used to work him in he said what did you think of the service jim and i said man you guys must have just come out of revival amen i sure would have liked to been here to hear brother brandon but all these things you said he said and he says let me give you some books brother tell me about the story and he gave me he gave me some books of brother brown's message books and i took them home and the more i read them the more i feasted the more i realized i was hearing a cry from something i never heard oh glory came in i had took a long time for me to realize that i was a son tonight sometimes it takes us a long time brother brown to realize that we are sons amen the true eagle the true type of a believer the true believer he said the farmer took that egg placed it out of the hand in due time the eggs hacked out the baby chicks are doing along just fine listen to that cluck pluck but that little eagle said something's wrong that's how many believes that something's wrong when you hear something contrary to the message all of a sudden boom something's wrong that's the holy ghost in you that placed you as a son it checks you the moment you hear that word there's something wrong with that brother amen that's not the word the word said i'm a son amen i mean oh but you can't be a son the word said i'm the son amen it takes some people a long time to realize that we're southern but one day oh one day way up in the air that eagle put that life in that little egg he said it flew over that barnyard oh brother bill he flew over that barnyard and he let out a screen and he said oh just like that prodigal son down there he heard something called rise up rise up and get back to where you belong amen he said he heard that scream and something stirred down inside of him he had never heard the cry of an eagle before he said but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch toward it oh church when i stepped into that church out on route 18 i heard something i never heard for the first time and i realized i'm not a denominational chicken amen i'm a son of god amen i said well what do i do about it amen he was stirred the prodigal son was stirred but he's got to do something about it [Music] and he said that voice that spirit of god screamed out to me he says just get out of there just rise up just flap your wings and get out of that place and come to what the word is calling you to come to you he said that's right he acted like a chicken for a while but he couldn't be satisfied he always was and he began to beat his way and he hurled himself into the air amen oh god aren't you glad tonight he rose are you rose out of the chicken pan into the revealed word of god for this hour amen he acted like a chicken for a while church we might have acted like we're not sons of god but it's time to start acting like what we are today can't be satisfied with anything else he said but when he heard that great eagle he came to his it came to his own place he said and once a true son of god hears the cry of the spirit by the word he too you too will realize that you would and you realize that you are the son of god and you will run to that great prophet eagle and you will be forever seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen amen how many have heard that eagle cry tonight you're a son i mean get out of that mountain get out of that self-condemnation and rise up above it all like the prophet said it's time to go back to the father tonight and go back to the word the father said i am a son of god tonight would you stand your feet with me you know you guys sing that song here hey man set your wings to the winds of faith that brother does amen i'll probably get the tune all wrong amen but church it's time we set our wings to the wind of faith tonight it meant faith in what the word of god says the word of god says i'm a son tonight he'd be quit letting the devil say oh you're not ever going to be a son put it off in the living one day i'll know you are now a son of god with all the authority of the father behind it tonight you have a right to tell that devil get out of my mind you have a right to tell that devil i'm afford to cast you out of my body i have the authority to cast you out of my deal i have authority to cast you out of my finances i had authority to cast you out of all my thinking amen amen that will you have no right here you're squatting on my territory him i'm a son of god now you can either look at what the word says that you're a son or you can look at the chickens all around you and say oh i'm just another chicken amen but i want to sing a song because i think it depicts what i'm trying to say tonight amen you sing a song [Music] take the word of [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] do not struggle it's [Applause] get your wigs tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's much [Music] truly in a higher [Music] [Applause] [Applause] in the sky he does not struggle he the does there's a power that'll raise you out of that fake page [Applause] oh and do not struggle is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in a higher place i will not struggle [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen how many are blessed amen amen lord i've been really really blessed really edified you know it's just ways that the holy spirit god knows just what we have need of you know it's just how to speak to our hearts there's so many so many points that the holy spirit was just bringing out tonight our sonship is not based on our works [Music] your authority in any situation is not based on your works but the authority is based in the blood that's where our nature on the inside has been changed and that's what you can really identify with is that life that was there within the blood this is this is why brother brahma said even when times here when jesus was facing a whole group of demons he didn't have to have a prayer meeting he just addressed the situation there are situations that i'll just be honest with you i would have liked to have had a prayer meeting before i had to deal with that situation but everything doesn't come when it's convenient hey we need this we need to come for this or this situation but this is the times that we realize our authority is not based on how how regular how long we pray how many tapes we listen to that's all works we believe in that we feed on the word of god but that's not what our authority is you might have had a week that seems like things are all tied up and everything else that does not affect your authority your authority is not based on your works your authority is based on the word and the blood has already spoken amen so it's not about it's like how the lord was bringing it sometimes our feelings our feelings there's times in our feelings we don't feel like a son of god but this is the time as the holy spirit was speaking to us to take what the word has said when you take what the word is saying to you and recognize that's his voice he's speaking to me let that supersede our feelings let it supersede our thoughts you stand right upon that word thought it was so good how the holy spirit brought it to night that here as a the battleground bringing that right out the battleground to where that as in our thinking all those things it ties together sometimes right in our thinking thoughts the battle that is being fought brother brown talked about even standing right at the pulpit he was asked a question one time brother branham what must i do when satan continues the devil is telling me i'm not a christian he said well he said what you do is when you see he said that your life matches with the word you know where your heart is at with god take the opposite of what he's saying he said frankly i'm standing right here doing the same thing to keep from pitching over oh my god's word can never fail this is this is we're living in a time and in a moment you're aware of this right now this the whole world it's the very fall in the beginning was it come about based on sensation feeling all of those things we're living in a time right now where people are strictly living by feelings you know you and i are humans there's no doubt about it but there's something we experience the same some of the same things with feelings but there's something greater on the inside we are sons and daughters of god and just like at the holy spirit broken we don't allow that thinking and to be held captive with that we we stand upon god's word amen and we say to the enemy get out of here amen traces of doubt thoughts that wants to put because the very moment that you start to dwell on it is the very moment that the authority that you already have you don't exercise it the way you need to [Music] to stand there regardless of how you feel stand on the word god's word has said this is who i am amen i tell you what what a word that god has brought us here tonight amen our hearts have been edified by the holy spirit god speaks and sees and god speaks very timely the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows exactly what we have had need of you know situations that facing whether here or out there on the internet situations that are facing but we never it's like israel right now we're not making any pact with you want to fire mortars we're going to only shoot them down but we're going to push you in the sea are you hearing me we're not we're not playing games we're not just we're going to get we'll fire one back you keep coming this way we're going to put you right in the sea that's the kind of things that in the midst of this time and say you know what now we're going to take more ground you're rising up we're going to take more ground right now we're not we're not standing around we are sons and daughters of god have confidence in what the word has already said about us amen i'll tell you if this is one of those messages you download on your phone play it
