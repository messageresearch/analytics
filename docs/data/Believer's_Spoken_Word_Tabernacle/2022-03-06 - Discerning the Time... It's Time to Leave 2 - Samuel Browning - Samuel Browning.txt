in the name of the lord just for a moment ask brother adam rego if you'll go ahead and make his way forward to give a testimony here brother gabriel just turn me down just a little bit here i asked brother adam to come and i asked him to do it last week but i didn't have it wrote down so i had to apologize after the service and put it in my uh what they call smartphone so i could remember bearing go off at a certain time i'll tell you that sounds bad you know in a way as though but uh i'm thankful that there's little things of reminders that we can have all around us for that uh ben you want him to use this right here would that be all right okay okay all right so i got hired in as a mill carrier uh last year i was told i was supposed to uh maybe take like two years get hired and full time so i had to work every sunday but i guess enough people were tired last year that was hired in full time last month so i'm able to come every sunday now so just want to thank god for that because we should be i ever saw that we should be at church so i miss being in church every sunday so i'm really glad for that just want to thank god for that opportunity god bless [Applause] it's been almost it was almost a two-year journey there where he got hired and i think brother brian was somewhat like the kind of the company that you were in before and then the lord just made a way we were just praying and together and god just made a way and we're just so thankful he's still jehovah gyra amen he knows just what we have need of and i'm so glad he's there to he provides for us just what we have need of amen and so i know uh just so appreciate that also i'm not gonna then turn me down just a little bit here on these monitors that's usually not a request i give just a little bit okay if i need them up later out there a little bit they're having to work a little bit more back there because the whole issue that was going on with the mics remember the popping it wasn't anything to do with the mics at all it's a separate thing back there that controls and regulates the compression of sound so they had to move out of that right there so they'll be working a little bit this morning but also with that of just to mention and not take much time with that of ukraine i'll send out a link here this week some of you probably already have seen it where brother barry he did a little bit more of an extensive update brother there's kind of been a little point person inside of there or right inside where different ones have given him uh the videos and different things of what's going on there so we'll get that sent out by email so you can take a look at it that's brother barry coffey and i just received the text from him here this morning more updates and i i didn't even have by the time i got it and have a chance to go through all of it but i know that there is some different families and some that have they have went to holy and the lord willing brother barry is going to be going there to poland to try to take different funds and also meet and try to encourage the believers that are there they're doing the believers are doing really well you know last week when i i was here and i was just kind of giving the update to you and uh then i find out that them in ukraine my goodness there were some of them right in the midst of everything they got out they went to church [Applause] that's that to me is just something i was just i said oh lord jesus that's just tremendous yes and um they're they're doing the one thing about it that they have done is where they have taken in some of the uh where some of the you know news and things like that was coming in they got together and they just made a decision just to among themselves just say you know what cut it off just cut it off we don't need because it was just troubling you know you start looking at things you entertain it and it starts bringing fear and uncertainty because all those things are uncertain right and uh but we've got a place to focus in this hour to draw strength from and i'll tell you what the message of the hour is good at all times amen because the message of the hour is in tapes and books the message of the hour is jesus christ revealed personally as a living god he is the strength of my life amen well we could just go ahead and preach right now let's let's stand if we could and let's read out of the bible out of first thessalonians chapter four and i'm just going to read begin in verse 13 and i'd like to try to pick up from where we were looking at last week as well and just try to move forward on that on that thought and just see how the lord will just direct us here in this first thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died rose again even so them which also sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them that's where we get our word rapture caught up caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words may god bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated god bless you mr stephanie god bless you i thought i heard your voice [Applause] some of you have different things that you know i just want to continue to look at that thought on it's time to leave when i look here how paul would write this promise it is written as a promise to the church of the living god it's a promise that all the way down through the ages they've looked for it they've lived their life in a way that that any moment that it could take place you see they didn't have the understanding at that time that it would be so many thousands of years or hundreds of years or they didn't have that understanding but that shows that there's certain things like that that's not necessary and that even is part of the mercy and the grace of god in our lives because if we did know the day or the hour we might have a little bit more trouble from our flesh that's good right yes are you hearing me yes yes because we are no matter who we are and what we are there's a level of procrastination that goes in and we can kind of look at it like well if i could just you know this is the date right here got this marked in on the calendar and this is when it's going to happen but you see that's that's not how that the coming of the lord is in any way right it's a promise that god makes and he confirms it to the heart of the believer and they look for that that word to come to pass in their age brother branham would say it i believe in the message taking sides with jesus or the message thy house i don't remember which one right now but brother branham makes a statement he says that those when they are raised up the those that have lived in the other ages when they raise up he said they went down running and they'll raise up right in stride they went looking for they would live for the coming of the lord in their day they didn't know there's another age or or this age is to come that they didn't know that but when we look at it within this hour even paul would live his life in that time to think how paul would be privileged as he could say to to move into that part of the third heaven and and receive a revelation of things that's not even lawful to be uttered but yet we recognize that god has a season and god has a time because paul did not live his life as though that well it's not going to come in my time or my generation but paul lived his life as did all the believers that this is the time right and i believe that's how that not only we are to live as believers but i believe that that that is how that we we are moved to live in this hour and i i thank god for the promise that we have received in this hour where this promise has laid there and it has waited until this time and this season and now god comes along to begin to make this promise known and make it real to the church of the living god and i look at this this this statement here where paul would say we're not going to have you to be ignorant in other words there's an understanding that's coming to you in this hour because this is the hour for you to understand these things and he would also go on to announce that what we are speaking to you this is by the word of the lord so this is not man's contrived idea this is not something to make somebody feel good but there is a certainty in this and you know it's not something that god does to try to convince somebody but the word of the lord comes and there's a sounding within that word of certainty of his voice and his presence that it just does something to the heart of the believer to bring them a comfort and a stability and a certainty that they can look at the promises of god no matter what they're facing and whatever the need is in their life god will take his promise and make it so real before them till they have a confidence to go after that promise and call that promise their own oh my our courage does not come from any other source than from the lord himself and so when we see this this is why where the scripture would say comfort one another with these words to console one another to encourage one another and as i said last week but when i think of the consolation and the strength and the encouragement comfort one another with these words i i can just only say it in this way that we might comfort one another with these vindicated words in this hour the message of the hour this is the comfort to the church of the living god it's that that even at times that we don't know what to do in a situation in our life and we're like the shunamite woman but we know if i can just get to my absolute now the absolute is not the flesh of the prophet but the absolute is the revelation that came through that and through that life and that's why when we can look there in the word of god we are not reading the bible with our own understanding or the understanding of a man that's been down through the ages there's been presumptions there's been studies here and studies there but in order for there to come a strength and a power in the church to bring about rapturing faith it would take god himself to come down and vindicate his word and not the thoughts of a man to come but the thoughts of almighty god no wonder brother branham would call out in the hour when he would preach falling apart again of this world and say what we need is a message with the messiahship of christ upon it we need it with a living god that he would stamp his his his own presence his life upon it and is that not what we're promised in revelations chapter 3 it would say thus saith thee amen the soviet of god this is the hour where the amen of god is speaking in this moment and what a privilege we have for in the book of isaiah what promises for them who bless themselves in the god of the amen and that's when we're finding our comfort and our strength so there's no other source of comfort in this hour the order of this rapture has been revealed to this generation it's sure it's been probed at in other times but then this hour is where it is revealed and the prophet would declare to us when we read the scriptures when we see the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice and with the trump all three things he does while he's descending and they're they're all in folds and increments of time and the first thing that he does is to shout i know for many this is familiar territory and the shout itself is a gathering of the people of god that shout is a message now notice brother branham would take us in the message the rapture and he would speak about the signs and wonders and the miracles that were being done in that hour and truly there is no denying of the ministry that god sent in this generation as a matter of fact brother branham would take it in the message token and he would say jesus christ had more success in the ministry he gave me than the ministry he had in galilee you see it's the same god it was god working in the body of jesus christ there it's the same god working in the body of jesus christ now it's god moving on the scene to bring the faith of his children into a level of rapture and god that's not given that to a church to do that a man to do that but the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout let me tell you something this message is not a thing of instability this message is not a wondering and a happening this message is jesus christ revealed i want to remind you satan was kicked out and the bible refers to it in revelations 9 he fell a star fell from heaven lucifer fell but not god god descends down it's under control what is it it's the anointing of the word of god in this hour to bring supreme and complete control by the anointing of the word the order of the rapture revealed to us in this hour that that shout that message going out because beyond the signs and wonders there is a message to be given to the people see this is where this is where that that message that voice is to the elect any signs or wonders that are done we will want to know where's the voice behind it because listen there can be signs and wonders and there are that are outside but as the prophet told us if it's not taking you into the word it's a denominational affair when god gives a sign and wonder it's that there would be a voice behind it and it's the voice itself the sign gets your attention so you'll sit still and hear the voice but not many saw the sign and set still but you see when you set steel you recognize the oh my that this is god moving in the fulfillment of his word then you can take a hold of the promise they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength this is the hour that god has given a renewal to the church of the living god by pouring out his own strength into the bride of jesus christ it's time to leave so we recognize that this message this is a shout it's a it's an assembling that that draws the people of god together now you know when we look at that i in many places i could go with that but i i want to just stay focused here with it that the shout itself it's a message that's getting the people together the living bread of life which what is the living bread of life it is the holy ghost is that right he is that bread that came down from heaven oh my it's not just an anointing it's the anointing of the word in this hour when we speak about the baptism of the holy ghost we are speaking about the anointing of the word that when the holy ghost has come into a life of a believer it directs us right into the word of god it doesn't take us away from the word it doesn't give us a big head it comes to direct us right into the word of god amen so when we look at it we were we were looking at and at first that's only it's four and i referred last week to how when brother brown would preach the message the rapture and he would take psalms 27 and i'm not going to read psalms 27 this morning for sake of time but brother branham would read psalms 27 as the text for the rapture you know because and he says it like this he says for a background now a background i will read this to you a background is that of events that serve as the scenery the setting the circumstances that are prevailing at a particular time that underlie a particular event now to understand it the background is not the focus if you ever went to a play or you know something you read or you watch you don't go home and talking about the background you you talk about the main event the characters that were there let me say this there's a lot of characters a lot of actors on stage there's a lot of players right now that have to be and in their position for the vision to fully come to pass but the other players listen to me now and actors they are part of the background that which is in the foreground is the and the focus is christ in his bride has the prophet could put it like this in things that ought to be he said the bride is the manifestation of the hour she is the living oracle of almighty god you know what that says that we are a creation of god and not a creation of a man we've not been schooled into this message we have been birthed into this word by the presence of the living god my my my my so we know that this background this is not what we focus on but when you see the background david would even prophesy you know the things coming against us enemies coming in to to consume us things that would come your way to try to swallow you up tests trials circumstances even things that we in ourselves made some bad choices but things would come around and the enemy's objective is to try to swallow you up to consume you and if it is just our strength based on our flesh alone he would have consumed us a long time ago are you hearing me because he can come in and eat on our flesh you say how do you mean by eating our flesh remember this right here is the serpent's meat come on now book of isaiah this is this is the serpent's meat right here this thing will always side against the word of god very quickly it's not an ally this thing is not not an ally that's why you've got to have the holy ghost to rule over it and bring it in subjection is that right if you take in thoughts and entertain thoughts then there's a war that starts with all sorts of propaganda that can come your way but the thing is it's not how long the war goes on but stop it when you hear the war starting when a thought comes in and it's not according to the word of god you stop that thought bringing in subjection to the word of almighty god you're not meant to be a trash can you weren't meant to be a receptacle of the devil you are a temple of the living car to be filled with his thoughts with his glory with his power hallelujah all these things around us things pressures all around us but david said here's how i'm i'm dealing with this the lord's the strength of my life he's the light of my life david could your light be blown out depends on what light you're talking about if you're talking about the light in my spirit that can get blown out with storms and winds coming by but if you're talking about the lord is the light of my life i didn't like that and that's not a lie that is man-made or can be blown out with winds of tests and trials that it should kind of light on the inside that even when i'm at my lowest yet there is a light and a presence on the inside that is greater than my thoughts it's greater than my abilities what is it the lord is the light of my life oh hallelujah one thing i've desired and that's what i'm going to seek after that is my objective david what's going to be your focus in this hour i am going to dwell in the house of the lord now david wasn't just talking about coming to church part of it but david is dealing with i want to dwell in his presence oh my david knows he will come when he's invited that's why david could say i have longed to see thy power and glory as i seen manifested in thy sanctuary you see david was prophesying of a time to where that the power and the glory of almighty god would not just be something that would be in the tabernacle but it would be with man anointing man in man living through man and so the power and glory would be veiled in a people who glory be to god so in the time of trouble the promise is this is what he'll do and everything in that scripture of what he does what he does now he don't do it without our permission he don't do it without our yielding you see what brings calm and peace to the believer is his presence his presence and what does it do it brings a yielding about in our life then what he has ordained to do he comes and accomplishes that he comes and he hides us in his pavilion he hides us in the secret of his tabernacle that he shall set me up on a rock and notice what with the power of position that is given you see when david is writing this under anointing he is speaking of a group of people that would come in the last days has adopted sons and daughters of god that would be positioned by almighty god in christ are you hearing me this morning that it would not be man positioning themselves it wouldn't be man like you know the latter rain movements and all no no it would be god himself coming down and bringing an adoption upon his children just like he did on matthew 17 when jesus took peter james and john up there there was an adoption ceremony that was being performed that's why the adoption cannot come outside of the revealed word of the hour is that right now notice this here look look at the glory of being in position it didn't being upon a rock you see all this right here david didn't say well he just took it all away he made everything just you know peachy cream and smooth and mine was just like the most light and fluffiest buttercream every day became a whipped cream day come on friend that's not what he wrote but this this is how god deals with in the midst of chaos and disorder but you see god is not interested in trying to hear me he's not interested in trying to bring order to this world you can never bring order to this world but god will bring order and desperate order and haspering order and will bring order to the sons and daughters of god because they can be touched and hear the word of god and respond to it so it doesn't stop everything else that's going on around us it doesn't stop the background the background is there and the background is not a pleasant time the black what david describes here is not pleasant things going on it's not a picnic all kinds of battles test trials mind battles on and on and on that's all around but he says now because he's been set up on a rock notice verse 6 and now notice and now because of this now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me notice the enemies are still there but my head has been lifted up above them they are not the focus it is not what i'm indulging in it's not what i'm looking at because i tell you if i focus on my enemies fear can try to overtake me but now i'm set up on a rock and because of being in this place i can look above my enemies my enemies don't go away but i can look above my enemies therefore david what you're going to do well i will offer in the tabernacle sacrifices of joy this is talking about real joy not a joy the world brings joy the world brings let's just speak plain today the joy that the world brings is hey they got gas gas is real cheap right now what the water puts price on it 525 whoa that's real cheap joy that the world brings but that's not you see everybody's got joy but this joy right here is a joy that the world can't give you this is the joy of the lord this is the same joy that jesus prophesied and announced to the disciples the joy that i will give you no man can take away from you no tests no trial no demon no discouragement nothing can take away this joy from your life but as a matter of fact you will draw strength from this joy because it is a source of life of living water inside of you when you're down when you're discouraged when you feel dry you still have a well a joy to draw from oh my we are not tapped into a broken sister we are living from the living fountain of the word of god in this hour so david could see this great sovereignty of god in a place of safety it's god that has placed us there now i'ma think of this here and i want to read this this statement to you out of second-handed robot i don't have this up i just just going to refer to places in here you know thinking about the calling and the choosing and the election of god that's what brother brown is talking about in this quote and he's talking about how we can't make one hair black or white we can't add you know one cubit to our stature here's what he says in regards to that he said i'd be a discouraged man this morning if i didn't believe in the election and calling of god if i thought that this world was left to the outcome by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the big force and the uns whoever who never even mentioned god's name i'd be a discouraged person but i'm not looking to that for the outcome not focused on the background tuned in to the main event oh he said i look down in the pages of this old book here where god wrote it out and everything will come out just exactly the way he said it that's all so the only thing for me to do is not to line up with them but line up with calvary line up with god line up with his word stay in his word no matter how much it looks like it could be this way it's going to be the way god intends it to be it can't be nothing else for him being infinite know the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his praises notice brother brown quotes all things will have to work together everything will have to shape right up to its place my he said if that wouldn't make the courage in a christian nothing can go wrong after all it's not our battle it's his it's not our wisdom it's his the only one thing we had to do is put our faith and trust there and set still and see the glory of the lord and how it moves around to its place every wheel moving it may be scattered from side to side but it'll move right into its right place when god speaks the word now in psalm 62 verse 5. psalm 62 verse 5 this is where brother bannon would take his text in the message shalom i wa notice the words my soul wait thou only upon god i think it's fitting not my spirit you see because in our spirit is also our mind our thoughts but my soul let the mind of christ be in us as it was in christ jesus my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him so who has given us this expectation rapture healing deliverance the baptism of the holy ghost who gave us that expectation that expectation has come from him he only verse six is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved in god notice in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god it's a very key point when you you look around in lives and see stability it's not because the person has some great dna or great genes and boy if i can only be like them no you're looking at the wrong thing but to see the reality is there is a rock that is there or paul would call it in this term an anchor that absolutely stabilizes us in the midst of every situation it isn't that a person that's on a rock doesn't get discouraged we do get discouraged we can get down the pressures do come but there is a rock or an anchor that we are tapped into by the grace of god so it's not our strength it's his strength he's the stability of our life notice this in psalm 62 8 the next scripture trust in him at all times it's easy to trust when it's when you know when everything seems to be just right but the scripture says at all times not trust on trust in him it's speaking of the hour of the believer in this time to be trusting in him you know it's just like i spoke to one of my neighbors here last year you know and and they were they were talking to me and even the year before we had talked and they were talking about all this was going on with the pandemic and things like that so i was just waiting to see if i get my foot in the door so i can you know begin to kind of talk and identify some things well we didn't get to that point but but even last year coming along this was his statement that he made very fine man really good neighbors i really really love him appreciate him but this is his statement that he made he said i knew sometime along the line he said i told my wife it'll be all right america will get it figured out well you know it's a miracle we'll get this thing figured out you know the vaccines coming out there now look where their certainty is because the year before that i talked to him he was looking at he said you know you begin to think is this the end of it all well i started to lay certain things in but couldn't get real far you know with that but to think of it that people have such a confidence in in in america or they have a confidence in certain things and truly this nation itself is that of the greatest or was of the greatest of the free world when when you really consider it and look at it how that it was started and all that but now she's fallen she rejected the gospel the things that we are seeing now even with the hippies that are in control the same things that we are seeing right now you know where that all started that started years and years and years and years ago even the feminist movement many of them a couple couple years ago when i was going back and researching a lot of it a lot of the feminist movement and seed started clear back in the 1800s and a lot of those things that led to the sexual revolution and all those things everything the debauchery within the nation and things that would come about to where they won't even allow prayer in school i i just read a news article here the other day of of one of the school uh school teams here in ohio down around the amish country area where you know they got on them about you know you shouldn't have been praying out there and and you know leading them in prayer and i thought about it you know you you think that america you listen to them on the newscast and how they're wondering they'll talk about russia and run them down i find you guys you've got such uh uh you know a false impression such a a thought of a past reputation and they're counting on that they're looking at that my goodness putin doesn't need a whole military men he's got nukes right there it wouldn't have even lasted this long if he'd have pulled the button are you hearing me but it's such a false security in this hour that people are secure and yet they'll look at it well we're a christian nation we are no longer a christian nation they forsook that when they forsook the gospel of jesus christ and remember the gospel of jesus christ is not the bible the gospel is the holy ghost the word that has been written made manifest they rejected the place of safety and salvation and because of that they are turned to themselves the bible says that nation that rejects god has turned to hell that's the bible right so we know that even in this time of where we see things you know prayer taken out of school and everything amazed me even when i was teaching things that they wanted to try you know to control kids and oh this is going on this is going on you know and and they want to try to mitigate things well you know you can't say that it's anything you know because of the parents or this or that you can't do any of that well nobody was trying to pass the buck but you know they're trying to harness things and deal with things through education that's the god of this world and whether you realize it or not communism isn't over there the prophet announced it this this very america is honeycombed with communism it may not look like the form of that which is on display over there but let me tell you something it has within it the same cruel things some of the things that we saw being made manifest even in this past year with groups uprising and marching and all the things they've done you know what it is that's a form of communism remember there's the three isms there's fascism marxism and it all ends up into communism brother brown tells us she said it'll all come to a place to where the churches will they will come together to try to fight against this communism uh my mama i can't go into depth on all of that because i really see it to be uh you know in many different ways and many different levels i believe that the conservatives if you could call it that in this country would so unite together around things which you know we don't want to see those things people tearing down statues and everything else and you know all that all that type of nonsense that's going on but all that is because they've rejected god we're seeing the effects of it of people coming under the spirit of destruction in this hour it's a sad thing because what they need they really need to meet jesus christ but because the church has failed them god never failed them but the church has failed them trust in god at all times now notice this achievement that has taken place upon the earth you know brother brown would say in the message three kinds of believers he said that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon the achievement of every believer is that god is able to keep every word that he said he would do every word that no matter what circumstances rise god is able to keep his word friends we are we are standing in a moment in this hour of a rapture and we recognize there has already been two other raptures is that right even here in the new testament but we recognize within that it will take just as it did then it took faith to bring rapture in that time and god's the one who brought faith in order to bring rapture in that time and in that season so here we are living in this moment the church in itself how many times did your brother ram say over and over he said the church is in no condition to finish out the great commission that god gave to the church because god never intended for the church to carry the word god intended for the holy ghost to pack the message the word on the inside of the believer so there had to come a time to where the holy spirit would return to the church in order to finish up the great commission of that of redemption now he goes on to make the statement in that same message and he says the reason he says that i believe he says of this time that when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of light now notice she's called out elected and set in the book of light notice the placing that will take place there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in rapturing grace oh glory be to gods because you see there is a promise there is a heaven there is a literal jesus who is coming and to announce that he's here in the fullness of his word and his spirit right now that's the first part of the procession of him doing all three while he descends the shout now to see that within that david would also write in psalms 130 verse 5. notice how he writes this i wait for the lord that's a big statement i wait for the lord now you know the only way you can wait you've got to have faith you've got to have faith like the little woman who was promised by the the owner son of the ranch i will return to you in the spring and take you for my wife so that right there there was a faith that she operated by while they were apart she operated by faith in her life that brought about a waiting you know you you couldn't move her from that it didn't matter of all the scoffers it didn't matter all of those around there that looked better than she did maybe had everything else they were more beautiful and everything but he did not choose based on outward character he chose on what is real what is true and that's that inward character and she was waiting on him to come why because he said he would hallelujah i wait for the lord my soul doth wait oh this really narrows it down don't it my soul doth wait that's where the waiting really has to come from come on friends we can receive a real a word from god but look if our flesh we get to looking at it well look you feel worse today than you did before look at you that pain is coming back your flesh can quickly subside and move away from that but in the soul itself it waits on the lord it says wait a minute i'm not waiting for it's a feeling a sensation i'm waiting for the lord and the same god who confirmed that promise to me is the same god that will cause my body to come in subjection to the confession i have received and i'm living under my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope oh there is no greater place to be is there how's it going to be i don't know but he said so you know brother samuel that sounds a lot like abraham's seed that's exactly what abraham's seed is he said so that's the purpose of the word of god coming in this hour and the baptism of the holy ghost that's made visible before the people and coming into our lives is to bring a certainty in the life of the believer so when things rise up you can put your foot on that devil's neck and say i am certain of god hallelujah oh my my soul verse 6 waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning now there's no doubt i'm speaking across this room no matter if you're young or old there's times we've had sleepless nights and we went to bed and we thought man i'm tired tonight and you realize you just crossed the boundaries there you overtired you better get that way you just get over time you're restless and you're looking at the clock at two o'clock three o'clock because we know i got to get to sleep morning's coming right well because we know hey morning's going to come for sure that that's one thing he got to be punched in at this certain time i've got i've got to get up morning's coming but david is speaking of something in his life that's more certain than the morning coming oh my my soul waited for the lord more than they that watched for the morning so to the believer the coming of the lord is more certain than the morning the coming of the lord is more certain than the next second on your watch the coming of the lord is more certain than the next minute hour day week month year it's more certain to you and you are looking more to it your expectation is more if we had a scale right here your expectation in the coming of the lord not that you don't have other expectations but you said this is the height of my expectation i'm expecting this more than this because this may never come but this right here the coming of the lord is certain can i preach for a minute the baptism of the holy ghost is more certain to you than the next second [Music] hallelujah the coming of the lord with healing virtue is more certain to you than the next hour what are you talking about the focus not the background oh brother branham he picks this up 1959 who is this i'm just going to refer to it he's talking about how different things have come up israel becoming a nation all those things happening and how it paralleled there in his ministry and he says like this i want you to listen to these words in 1959 he said i don't see nothing at all left according to scripture of course there may there may be many things maybe the lord's not letting me know but i don't see nothing left but just the coming of the lord now see that's 1959 and you and i can look and say well you know the seals had to be open and this had to come about but you see it was more than just messages to be preached this is what when we have an insight into this right here the prophet has not brought a message to you and i because that is not how it was revealed and made known to him that it's a message of delay are you hearing me this is not a message of delay in other words you say what is a message of delay a message of delay is to push back his presence right now and looking for something to come that's already here right now to prepare us for the next moment so that results in a delay are you hearing me now can i preach a moment that's what can delay things coming in your life that's what can delay the coming of the lord in your life that's what can delay healing that's what can delay those things if you push away right now his presence that's trying to deal with things in your life and you're pushing away and you're waiting for something to come maybe i'll be at a camp meeting here maybe i'll be at a meeting there maybe i'll be at a meeting there remember the coming of the lord is a greater expectation than the morning coming we don't want to push it away but we want to stand in this hour that today is the day of salvation that this is the moment of my visitation right now i am part of this end time generation that this revelation has been waived over my life this reality has come has struck my heart [Music] delay no longer you see that's the urgency of the message time should be no more we're not living under a delay now i can't bring him from glory you can't bring him from glory i can't say rapture next minute that's not what it is but every promise that we are to take between now and the next moment there should be no delay i just say right now lord god all through this building my hands up included lord god take every bit of sluggishness out of our lives take every bit of delay out of our lives and let us operate not as people of the delay but people that are possessing the promises that god has given in this hour because that of the rapture is a possessed a promise that is possessed by the believers oh my notice he said i don't see one thing left according to the scripture of course there may be many things but the lord's not letting me know but i don't see nothing left but just the coming of the lord i mean we could go through this building and how many of us could think well we didn't think it would be here this year right but you see it it's how we live living in a manner it don't matter if he comes today tomorrow it don't matter and it's still joy it's joy brother say how can you say that look at everything that's going on in the world let me get to a minute i got a little prescription right here how can you say that you you it depends on where you're focused you know [Music] you see it's like this it's like you know sitting behind somebody in church i see some of you sometimes you you move out behind somebody you move in between a couple because maybe you can't see around the brother you know see you see over top of see you know you might be a little shorter i see you'll kind of get in position kind of squeeze through so you can see why it means just something about it you want to see maybe whoever is ministering up here and it isn't that you're focused upon them but you just want to see it right and you're trying to move around and get in position well you and i were not in position to see the coming of the lord in the right way it wouldn't matter we didn't have enough strength because it was not in our ability or we were not gifted to catch that you see god works in a way so that it takes one thing to cause the reaction in something else brother adam described it as a prophet in this age i believe it's impersonation of christianity he said that a prophet in this season a prophet is one who is designed to go beyond the realm of emotion beyond the realm of music beyond all those other realms and climb up into the realms of god and to see where we need to be and then come back down here and tell us he also said that a prophet is one who can stand there and he has strength to pull himself up on the fence to see what's going on in the circus and come back in and tell the other people oh my now you see in order for that to are you hearing me now in order for that to be believed in order for that to be true then that revelation of who that is in that hour has got to be confirmed to you you see it's got to be confirmed in your heart that this message is not a message of a man it's not an extension of pentecost it's not a it's not like moody it's not like calvin it's not like any of them it is the message of the hour that god promised a full restoration in this time back to the original baptism of the holy ghost and when that revelation is caught then it stops the questioning of the prophet's words because this is why think of it the message the rapture brother braham said prophecy two or three are to judge that in the church but he said nobody sets before a prophet to correct him that's rapture condition a person may not understand it but god has not entrusted any man to correct the prophet of god because if you want to talk about correction they could have hung jesus what do you mean eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood they could have taken you back to their bible to their quotes to their scriptures and they could have said moses said that you're not to eat the blood you're not to eat that because in the blood is the life which is the atonement but you see to the believer though they couldn't explain it but yet they believed it it was something about it that was taking a hold in their life that had already even though that hadn't lifted them into the baptism of the holy ghost but it had already taken a hold of their lives that they knew that this is the promise that god made through moses brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying that that's the kind of faith and reality that must be in the hearts of the believer because god sent this message with you and me in mind this message is not about brother branham this message is of jesus christ and his righteousness it is to announce that the bride is not coming she's here [Applause] my mama i feel like saying whatever he said amen let me try to finish this quote i don't see nothing at all left according to the scripture of course there's many things maybe the lord's not letting me know but i don't see nothing left but just the coming of the lord now watch this oh he said how i i just like to check up and you get to reading in the papers and listening to the newscasts now you know right now sister reed if i read something right here right now if i read after this and say and you get to reading the papers and listening to the newscast and boy your faith just grows and it just strengthened you would know right now say you're lying i know her well enough she'd say it you're lying that is not what it is because i know newscasts and newspapers and this doctor and whatever more they don't build faith now watch this is the prophet right here speaking he says now i like to check up just like no doubt probably some of you have been watching the events and things like that like i have little videos here and there and watching this reading reports seeing the different things and believers in ukraine and all these things going on now notice what he says oh i just like to check up he says and you get to reading the papers and listening to newscasts it makes you real nervous and then you sit down and think before it can all happen we're going home we're saying he didn't tell us to be ignorant but the bible says when you see these things come to pass subscribe to that channel subscribe to that news feed subscribe to this subscribe to that no when you begin to see these things come to past lift up your head your redemption draweth not [Applause] isn't that wonderful and that's tremendous you can just put it all down and after it all when you get done with that newscast maybe some of you say you know what i don't need that feed on my phone because that type of stuff right there is feeding me with fear feeding me with wrong things feeding me with this feeding me come on friends you say brother samuel what are you talking about well let me just show and share with you the brothers that got together in ukraine you see the brothers can't go out for food and stuff it has to be the sisters make the runs outside of the places where they're at to go get the food so the sisters themselves because you know there's such a tightness within there all the men had to stay put and there's a lot of you know a lot of the russian soldiers that's actually got in there you've probably seen it this morning they just assassinated a man who went to the first peace talks on the side of ukraine but he's a double agent ukraine just assassinated him today now to all you have in russian soldiers and this is why the ukrainian brothers as they said you you can't go out and talk or trust anybody because you have a lot of russians that have infiltrated in plain clothes so you know you have the sisters they're the ones that have to go if they get money if money's to be withdrawn most of the money right now they're able to do everything by phone but if they go to do anything they got the sister's got to go out and and go take care of that and do it so the sisters they which would be natural who when where witness be natural or the sisters because of things that they were receiving and hearing from news that begin to be concerned like what's going to happen with our family what's going to happen with the kids and we're going to go into school and all those things right they begin to you know and so the very thing what wisdom that these brothers got together and you know in that time as they're gathering together the one thing that they made a decision of course you know everybody had to go along with it but was to do what cut off all of that now let me tell you something what they cut off and what they're feasting on is the word of the hour brother that ain't propaganda that's life [Music] propaganda will bring fear and uncertainty do we do this don't we don't do this do we do this do we don't do that do we do come on friends hey listen that's not just over there that's been right here right here in this nation right now you wait as things go on you wait as time goes on watch certain things will pop back up oh we need to watch out for this certain things it's all propaganda that's going on listen we're not conspiracy people are you hearing me but it's a reality in this hour that there is one focus that we have as the bride of jesus christ and that is in the coming of the lord and the promise is he's coming in my life today he's coming in my life tomorrow he's coming the next day if he tarries and one of these moments the coming of the lord a sweet will come over my life and we'll be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye right now i think that to be such admonition in this hour of things because the things that you read you look at you take in it's very important that we see because before it can all happen we're going home brother brown would say it in the message identification he says in my humble opinion 1963 just in condition this world is just in condition for the coming of the lord the rapture the next thing and all that lacks could happen within an hour so for the church of the living god the next thing that we're looking for is the rapture oh brother tell me i'm looking for him to close the churches i'm not i'm looking for the rapture are you hearing me now oh i'm looking for this you better be looking for the rapture because if you're looking for the rapture you're right focused on the right thing you're not looking at background things and trying to make presumptions and put this together and put this together because the prophet himself even grew in understanding in the ministry on those things is that right so as we continue on and we're looking at those things now look when we recognize this is the very next thing that we're looking for is the rapture that's the promise that belongs to us as believers oh glory be to god that's why when brother bannon was asked a question in 1964 questions and answers brother branham will the church have to go through a persecution like the early church he said no sir the next thing is the rapture you say brother samuel what's the danger what's the danger and looking at anything else it's because you get your eyes off the lord jesus well our focus is in the coming of the lord the very next thing the very next thing that takes place is the very the chains of the bodies is to be waiting and looking for our loved ones to appear because the prophet tells us when they appear the scripture said they arise first and when they arise and we see them oh the rest of the world won't see them but we will see them and we'll know our change is on its way why we've been looking for that so we're not focused on the background we're focused on what's happening in the foreground this is why let me just try to get to a spot you didn't turn me off yet did you don't don't dial them things down on me there's just not enough services this is not enough time but when we see where we're at in this hour daniel interpreted the dream of nebuchadnezzar god gave nebuchadnezzar that dream and showed the end from the beginning oh i just feel him so wonderfully he gave it that dream to him and even though he had the dream he couldn't interpret it but the god who gave it had a channel upon earth that was there in that moment in that season that could interpret that dream and when he interpreted that dream remember it was calling death to come upon all of the the you know the astrologers and all them and the kingdom but it was daniel who would stand in the gap and daniel would stand there and say don't be so hasty there is a god in heaven who reveals these things let us ask for the mercies of god so daniel said i ain't got too big i still know my abcs and the way that i approach god for anything is prayer and fasting yes i'm sorry my position and what god has ordained me to be i know the little things that brought me here i stay with the little things i'll take that swing shot i'll stay with where god brought me from and i'll stay with prayer and fasting when things come up that i don't have the answer to i'll pray and i'll fast and i look to the god who is rich in mercy to reveal his secret of life to me daniel receives from god the the the the king had this he had the dream let me tell you something this has it tells the end from the beginning are you hearing me all those characteristics of those kingdoms that was described within that image it's all laid out right here and you can see that same spirit that wormed its way and worked through you know coming up under the name of a pagan rome and now into because it's been wormed all throughout all the nations are you with me what started out listen now what started out as an objective by nimrod after coming after the flood an objective to create a religion and objecting to be worshiped and objective for another another place another way remember what was once an objective is now in worship in the world is that right the god of this evil age is education satan is the god of this evil age brother branham would tell us and i think this is good for young people and everybody alike brother brown would say no he said i'm not against education but he said remember he said you go get what you need to get he said i'm not against reading and arithmetic and all those things like that he said but don't ever let education take the place of god come on friends you know there's things that come about in your life and there's a lot of things that come about as education the doctors can tell you this will happen and this will happen and that'll happen and you know what you can look at it not disrespecting that man but then you've got to make a choice are you going to take what that man has said education is the best and the far as his intellect can go education stops with the mind of man but remember the supernatural is of god it moves to do things that are thought to be impossible it supersedes the reasoning of man that's why the battle that we still face in this hour is a wisdom versus faith battle it's an age-old conflict and it comes at us are you hearing me in many different forms oh brother samuel i came out of denominationalism that don't mean that battle ain't still before you we've got to battle that every day and every moment of our life it'll come in every every sort of form and every sort of way is that right now notice this how that this image would be but daniel would receive that just like it he wouldn't do no good just to have that dream if there wasn't somebody that can interpret it but daniel couldn't know it only god could know it but daniel hadn't had faith in god you know why he knew god he just didn't know about god daniel wasn't in babylon facing this moment with a sunday school experience is that all right to say it that way he he wasn't just something he knew about the god of the message well i know about him i know he's done this no daniel made a statement in that hour it came from his heart don't let the king be hasty because he didn't just know about god but he knew him personally he knew that god is the interpreter god is the revealer [Music] and he was able to stand there in the gap in that hour you talking about a lot of pressure there was a lot of pressure on daniel there was a lot of
