[40:15] her in different ones visiting but we're
[40:17] just so glad to have your presence back
[40:18] here may God bless you this morning
[40:22] verse 67 of Luke chapter 1 and his
[40:28] father Zacharias was filled with the
[40:31] Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed
[40:34] be the Lord God of Israel for he hath
[40:37] visited and redeemed his people and hath
[40:40] raised up and horn of salvation for us
[40:42] in the house of his servant David as as
[40:46] he spake by the mouth of his holy
[40:48] prophets which have been since the world
[40:51] begin that we should be saved from our
[40:54] enemies and from the hand of all that
[40:57] hate us to perform the mercy promised to
[41:01] our fathers and to remember his holy
[41:03] Covenant the oath which he sware to our
[41:07] father Abraham that he would grant unto
[41:09] us that we being delivered out of the
[41:12] hand of our enemies might serve him
[41:14] without fear in holiness and
[41:18] righteousness before him all the days of
[41:22] our life may God bless his word and
[41:25] bless you as you're being seated like to
[41:28] continue reading there and thou child
[41:33] shalt be called the prophet of the
[41:37] highest for thou shalt go before the
[41:41] face of the Lord to prepare his ways to
[41:46] give knowledge of salvation unto his
[41:48] people by the remission of their sins
[41:51] through the tender mercy of our God
[41:54] whereby the Dayspring from on high that
[41:58] visited us to give light to them that
[42:01] said in darkness and the shadow of death
[42:04] to guide our feet into the way of peace
[42:05] and the child grew and waxed strong in
[42:09] spirit and was in the deserts till the
[42:13] day of his showing unto Israel
[42:16] I'd like to speak to your begin to speak
[42:20] to you on the heart of God when we look
[42:25] at this and just when you think even in
[42:30] our own lives our own bodies are not
[42:33] natural bodies the heart itself is
[42:36] really at the at the center of
[42:39] everything you know even where when a
[42:42] when a person themselves when through
[42:45] many of much of the research and things
[42:47] that I've even looked at a person
[42:50] themselves can actually be in a place
[42:52] when they put them on the respirator and
[42:54] so forth that's that's not for their
[42:56] heart their heart will continue to go
[42:58] but the respirator would be in order for
[43:00] them so that they would actually be able
[43:02] to have the oxygen and so forth in their
[43:05] lungs but it's the heart is so designed
[43:07] in such a way that it actually is not
[43:11] really a part of the nervous system
[43:14] itself you realize that our body is
[43:16] comprised of many different systems and
[43:19] how that those systems work so
[43:21] intricately together they complement one
[43:23] another yet there is no system that is
[43:26] of such vital importance and of great
[43:29] need as the heart is because without the
[43:33] heart then the cells themselves and all
[43:35] the other organs of the body are not
[43:37] able to function to their full capacity
[43:40] and potential and we know that when a
[43:43] heart itself would begin to shut down
[43:45] then the body itself things begin to the
[43:49] other organs and everything else because
[43:51] everything in that body is depending on
[43:54] that heart it's really just quite a
[43:56] quite an amazing thing when I looked at
[43:59] it and you know as you go back over it
[44:01] and the inspiration of God will direct
[44:03] you into those things to look at and you
[44:05] see how that not only how God has wrote
[44:07] his Bible in the heavens but to see how
[44:11] that God would even have Paul would you
[44:13] know Paul would relay the the warfare of
[44:15] a believer he would relay it by what he
[44:18] saw with the soldier that here he was
[44:21] shackled with and Paul would be able to
[44:23] catch inspiration from that and ride of
[44:25] how that we would be
[44:27] as believers to war and have an Armour
[44:30] an Armour that's given to us by God and
[44:33] to see how that you know it's in another
[44:34] place the gospel is likened to a race
[44:37] but then we find that here within also
[44:40] Paul would like into the body of
[44:43] believers and he would like in the body
[44:45] of believers to that of the natural body
[44:47] and realizing that within it that there
[44:51] is a need within a body for the heart
[44:54] and you know many times you know we hear
[44:57] the phrase sometimes where people say
[44:59] have a heart and we understand that's
[45:03] more than just the blood pump and that
[45:04] that deals with the compassion that
[45:06] deals with looking upon something and
[45:08] really taking taking into consideration
[45:10] some things and so when we we look at
[45:13] this I to me when I see this and the
[45:16] purpose of the heart and we begin to
[45:19] look at this in the heart of God and as
[45:21] we've been dealing with the mercy of God
[45:23] here I find in this in a state that
[45:27] where when the word itself that's been
[45:30] prophesied and we know that it all of
[45:33] this begin this prophecy begin to come
[45:36] forth clear from the time of the the
[45:40] Garden of Eden and here we are in this
[45:44] moment of Scripture we're living this is
[45:46] what all things were pointing to that
[45:48] the Lord Jesus he spoke that in genesis
[45:51] 3:15 that he would give the woman a seed
[45:54] and then he added to that and he he
[45:58] opened that it would come through that
[46:00] of the Abraham's seed and then he
[46:02] further opened that even further and
[46:05] added to it as the Prophet tells us and
[46:07] he revealed that it would be through the
[46:09] the seed of David and so it would come
[46:10] through that of Judah and but the mem
[46:12] tells us at in the church age book he
[46:14] says he added to it he didn't sow what
[46:16] God added did not take away from the
[46:18] original revelation all it did was take
[46:21] what the original revelation was and
[46:24] further bring it into view and when as
[46:27] the Prophet would would let us know
[46:29] there he said the reason God would do
[46:31] that is so that the believers themselves
[46:34] would have something to look forward to
[46:37] so God knows that within that that the
[46:39] word
[46:40] because as believers well why is it that
[46:42] you and I are believers well it's not
[46:44] because we studied our way into this
[46:46] it's not because we'll everything just
[46:49] makes sense it isn't because of that at
[46:51] all because in the reality that God many
[46:54] times in our own lives there are things
[46:57] that are taking place that do not make
[46:59] sense but yet we understand that the
[47:01] very first stage where a person where
[47:03] God would deal with alive he God would
[47:05] deal even with that of bringing where
[47:08] the word would come forth and the person
[47:10] in their mind would say and that's
[47:11] exactly right I need a Savior yes I I
[47:13] need to repent and so forth there's all
[47:15] a beginning stage of that but God's
[47:17] desires for that to drop even deeper yet
[47:20] God would would a give all of this out
[47:23] and the adding and the opening to
[47:25] further clarify his path and you know
[47:29] all the way down through time the
[47:31] believers that are identified the elect
[47:34] of God have always been waiting for the
[47:37] word and the promise to be fulfilled
[47:40] they lived within that word they walked
[47:42] within that word and we and I find that
[47:45] when I look at this here within the
[47:47] Scriptures it's a it's a lot like when
[47:49] Israel was than the day that we're
[47:52] living in Israel when the fulfillment
[47:55] really of the mercy of God that was
[47:57] promised the oath that was given in
[47:59] another place it said the truth of Jacob
[48:01] in another place it said this sure
[48:03] mercies of David all of these things
[48:05] that were spoken in that time Israel had
[48:07] all of these things wrote out of
[48:10] everything that was going to take place
[48:12] and to a believer a believer looks for
[48:15] this word to be made manifest it isn't
[48:19] that you know within it that a believer
[48:22] knows everything but it's just something
[48:24] where a believer is inclined by the
[48:26] leadership of the Spirit of God that's
[48:28] just like the animals that know when
[48:31] it's time to come back home after their
[48:33] departure in the fall they know to start
[48:35] flying again
[48:36] you don't have to send them a telegraph
[48:38] it's something built within them that
[48:40] they they begin to know and it's
[48:42] something that begins to move in the
[48:44] season a time and that's exactly the way
[48:47] it is with us as believers it's things
[48:49] that begin to move upon our lives like
[48:51] many of you you can look at
[48:53] that maybe you were sitting in a you
[48:55] know in a in a cold and formal place and
[48:58] the church and things and and you know
[49:00] but all of a sudden how God they're just
[49:02] something begin to deal with your life
[49:03] it wasn't that you looked down and said
[49:05] well you know they this place doesn't
[49:07] have nothing no but it was something
[49:09] within you said there's got to be more
[49:12] there's got to be more what was that
[49:14] that there wasn't you that was what God
[49:17] placed within you and there was a deep
[49:19] that was calling that only God Himself
[49:22] could satisfy there was a lot of good
[49:25] things around but yet only God can
[49:27] satisfy that part of himself and so it
[49:31] begin to draw you like like the salmon
[49:33] even coming back to its its bedding
[49:35] grounds it begins to draw you back into
[49:37] that place and a believer is looking for
[49:40] the word itself to be fulfilled yet
[49:42] Israel in the midst of this time as I
[49:45] look at this they had all of the word
[49:47] laying out before him they had the law
[49:49] they had the prophets they had the
[49:51] Psalms they had everything as a matter
[49:53] of fact we could put it like this they
[49:55] were much like us they have all of the
[49:57] scriptures if I could say it there was a
[49:59] lot of teaching there was a lever ething
[50:01] laid out but yet within it all what what
[50:04] was missing was they were not ready for
[50:08] the fulfillment of that word they
[50:11] weren't ready yet they had the word but
[50:14] yet they didn't they they weren't ready
[50:16] for it to be fulfilled but they thought
[50:18] they were ready oh my I believe it's all
[50:21] my heart friends that yes we we need to
[50:23] have a positive confession but I believe
[50:25] we need to be careful that our positive
[50:27] confession doesn't become arrogance I
[50:29] believe it needs to be something to
[50:31] where we realize that who were depending
[50:34] on to open the word to us and who were
[50:36] depending on toom oldest and to shape us
[50:39] and to correct us and rebuke us and to
[50:41] lift us up and to mold our lives I
[50:44] believe we need to be conscious of that
[50:46] because a word that has come and been
[50:48] delivered to you and I the word has not
[50:50] just been delivered and that's it of it
[50:52] it's been fulfilled know the word that
[50:54] has been delivered was a prophecy that
[50:57] laid in the word but now when that
[50:59] that has been spoken across this
[51:00] generation it is for a God is raising up
[51:04] a people that will reflect that word
[51:07] that the prophet has spoken in this hour
[51:09] and that's the expectation it is to look
[51:12] for that word and that word becoming
[51:15] material in our life more and more and
[51:18] more until the very of the body that's
[51:21] the expectation of our lives and you
[51:23] know they they weren't they needed a
[51:26] preparation and when I look at this I I
[51:29] I think you know when we go into the
[51:31] scriptures if I can go to a few
[51:33] scriptures here in before this and Luke
[51:35] Warner a few places up when the angels
[51:38] come to Zechariah and verse 13 and he
[51:42] says fear not Zacharias for thy prayer
[51:44] is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall
[51:46] bear thee a son and shall call his name
[51:48] John and thou shalt have joy and
[51:51] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[51:53] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[51:58] of the Lord not in the sight of man yet
[52:02] many of them in mire you they admired
[52:05] him but they didn't know what this was
[52:08] about now remember even the Lord Jesus
[52:12] could speak to many and say you rejoiced
[52:15] you walked in his light for a season but
[52:19] if they fail to walk on into further
[52:23] light of what that light was pointing to
[52:26] because when this is fulfilled this part
[52:29] of the word remember when this parts
[52:31] being fulfilled it is declaring there's
[52:34] a junction where it's declaring this is
[52:37] what is to be fulfilled next for what
[52:40] there is one standing among you John's
[52:44] ministry was a ministry that not only
[52:48] was in preparation but it was a ministry
[52:50] that could declare he is now here it was
[52:57] an announcement it was a sign and saw
[53:01] within this in the sight of the Lord he
[53:05] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[53:07] drink and he shall be filled with the
[53:09] Holy Ghost even from his mother
[53:11] and many of the children of Israel shall
[53:14] he turn to the Lord their God how much
[53:18] you look at this word turn turn it means
[53:21] to turn to through the worship of the
[53:23] true God to calls to return to bring
[53:26] back and he shall go before him in the
[53:29] spirit and power of Elijah to turn the
[53:33] hearts of the father's to the children
[53:35] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[53:39] just to make ready a people prepared for
[53:42] the Lord there was a mission there was a
[53:45] hold that had taken hold upon John's
[53:48] life and to see that within here a turn
[53:52] that was to take place I won't want you
[53:54] to think of it here they are reading the
[53:57] then many of the people they knew these
[54:01] things they could quote the prophets
[54:04] they could quote the Psalms they could
[54:06] quote all of the writings they could
[54:08] quote these things but they needed to be
[54:11] turned there had to come a turn to had
[54:15] to come something that would where there
[54:17] would be a turn brought about in their
[54:19] lives so when you think of it the how
[54:21] they are looking at all of this but yet
[54:23] they need to be turned and turned in
[54:26] their hearts you see because what was
[54:29] what God was coming to deal with was a
[54:32] heart condition
[54:35] hallelujah and in order to deal with the
[54:37] heart condition you need more than just
[54:39] an MD you need a cardiologist there
[54:45] right you need someone of a reputation
[54:47] when you're putting your heart into his
[54:50] hands so here he's coming to this would
[54:54] be the objective and this would be the
[54:56] outcome of his ministry is to turn the
[54:59] hearts of the people and to prepare so
[55:02] where where Israel what a contrast to
[55:05] their thinking in this time it when you
[55:07] would have asked them and asked the the
[55:09] great religious of that time in that day
[55:11] and you would ask them all their lawyers
[55:13] all their scribes all their Pharisees
[55:15] and Sadducees if you asked them they
[55:18] would say we're ready we're ready we're
[55:23] ready
[55:24] ready for the Messiah to come we're
[55:27] ready for that but yet they weren't
[55:30] ready there's a difference in being
[55:33] ready and thinking you're ready cuz you
[55:37] see they thought they were ready why did
[55:39] they think they were ready because they
[55:41] knew the word they had all of this in
[55:44] front of them
[55:45] but it takes God to come and to fulfill
[55:48] that word and open the eyes so that one
[55:52] might see and be changed they weren't in
[55:56] condition they were not in condition to
[55:58] receive the Messiah let me put it like
[56:01] this they were not in condition to begin
[56:03] the Commission and in this age where the
[56:07] churches and everything had got to and I
[56:10] you understand what I'm saying I you
[56:12] know I'm not taken away from churches
[56:14] but I how do we look at how the
[56:15] condition that that had come into and
[56:18] God did not send a new Bible in this
[56:20] hour the message never replaced the
[56:23] Bible the messages that which was sealed
[56:25] within the Bible it's the same original
[56:28] message but the church drifted from that
[56:31] message and that message is calling you
[56:34] and I to the true atonement to the true
[56:37] relationship to the true United with the
[56:39] Lord Jesus Christ and the church is the
[56:42] conditions that they were they were in
[56:45] they were in nope no condition to finish
[56:48] up the Great Commission because the
[56:52] urgency this whole space of time is not
[56:55] about works of man yet Satan has made it
[56:59] that way this whole time is about the
[57:03] gathering of the elect of God and then
[57:06] gathering it on that gathering and unto
[57:09] the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul spoke of
[57:13] you know even Paul spoke of rare there
[57:15] was men who had different objectives
[57:18] right Paul spoke of that how that there
[57:22] were some but yet in the midst of it
[57:24] God's Word went on there had to be a fit
[57:28] reception there had to be a message of
[57:30] preparation that would bring the people
[57:33] into a condition to be able to see you
[57:35] realize friends that even in our lives
[57:38] sometimes when we come in here to the
[57:40] house of God we're in no kind of
[57:42] condition to be able to receive
[57:45] sometimes listen sometimes even when
[57:48] we're about things during the week but I
[57:50] want you to think of this God Himself
[57:53] will prove even his mercy at times that
[57:57] you and I are not even in condition and
[58:01] he'll come by and he'll you know what's
[58:03] doing that he's doing that he's leading
[58:05] us that's leadership it's not just
[58:08] teaching us he's showing us how to lead
[58:12] even in our own lives but also and also
[58:15] how did we approach even one another
[58:17] when even one another are not deserving
[58:20] of good graces are you missing me I'm
[58:25] not just talking about the body of Jesus
[58:26] Christ I'm talking about around in our
[58:28] workplace and everywhere else we go and
[58:30] you know sometimes you may have had
[58:32] somebody that you know you you told her
[58:34] what kind of meat you want and man they
[58:35] just snap back and what are you gonna do
[58:39] you say you can either keep going with
[58:41] it or you can just say I'll take this
[58:43] and hey how's your day going Oh same you
[58:46] it's kind of but how do you know that
[58:47] what you speaking expressing that kind
[58:51] some places I've got it to where I go
[58:54] I'll stand there to meat counter in that
[58:55] long meat counter and I'll look just
[58:56] like I'll take my number and wait and
[58:58] I've got some of them they'll come and
[59:00] they know when you know they'll see me
[59:02] when I'm there and all of a sudden
[59:03] you'll see things change on their face I
[59:05] know I'm funny looking but I know it's a
[59:09] lot of times cuz I'll tell some of them
[59:10] when they they've had their walk emolia
[59:12] so why didn't you share with me you know
[59:14] it's things that's like that I you
[59:16] understand what I hope you understand
[59:18] what I'm saying that God that they were
[59:20] in no condition many times we're not in
[59:22] any condition but it's up to it's God
[59:24] Himself moving upon us but you know what
[59:26] God Himself will not create the
[59:29] condition for us but he will bring
[59:31] what's needed if we just surrendered to
[59:33] it it will tenderize us it'll soften us
[59:36] up that he might come battle
[59:39] this word I'm telling you what a godly
[59:41] sir that would come down and he's
[59:43] desiring to fulfill his word in such a
[59:46] way that he'll remove the vilest of
[59:48] attitude he'll remove the violence of
[59:51] that how does he do it by his presence
[59:53] his love oh my little circle right
[59:56] around this building
[59:57] it'll circle right around your heart to
[59:59] bring you into a place to begin to
[1:00:01] reflect and think and say Lord I need
[1:00:04] more of you hallelujah
[1:00:09] oh my the Bible says you know when we
[1:00:13] look at it in matthew chapter or Malachi
[1:00:16] 3 it he said behold I send my messenger
[1:00:18] before my face or he shall prepare the
[1:00:23] way before me and that word even
[1:00:26] preparing it so it deals the same word
[1:00:28] it's a turning and and he said the Lord
[1:00:30] whom you seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:00:33] temple even the messenger of the
[1:00:35] Covenant in whom you delight behold he
[1:00:39] shall come and saith the Lord of Hosts
[1:00:43] all of this that was going to take place
[1:00:46] the word was giving them a direction of
[1:00:51] the fulfillment and there were hearts
[1:00:55] and lives who were awaiting on the
[1:00:57] Messiah they were on their toes waiting
[1:01:00] you had a Simeon you had a Hanna you had
[1:01:03] this the remnant was small that was
[1:01:05] waiting but God was going to have some
[1:01:07] people that in the darkest of times let
[1:01:10] me tell you something the darkest of
[1:01:11] time it doesn't mean so much gloom but
[1:01:14] theology and everything of man is such
[1:01:17] darkness and such gloom because it
[1:01:20] doesn't allow the Rays of God's life to
[1:01:23] shine through and that does produce a
[1:01:27] gloom but there's a darkness that's
[1:01:28] greater than just and then they're not
[1:01:30] having sunlight it's a darkness where
[1:01:32] there is a covering and a Anna and and a
[1:01:35] removing of the power of Almighty God
[1:01:39] hallelujah the one whom you delight and
[1:01:42] he shall suddenly come to his temple so
[1:01:44] his temple so the preparations made the
[1:01:47] temple will be on earth and God Himself
[1:01:49] will come
[1:01:50] and it feels that temple who will feel
[1:01:52] that temple the messenger of the
[1:01:54] Covenant Amen who is that the very heart
[1:01:59] of God himself
[1:02:02] the Bible has said I think of how that
[1:02:05] it spoke you know regarding John you
[1:02:08] know it talks about how every high place
[1:02:10] will be brought low and how every every
[1:02:12] a low place will be brought high you
[1:02:14] talked about how that the mountains
[1:02:16] would skip like Rams all of these things
[1:02:19] and yet we know that when you think of
[1:02:22] even the mountains and things skipping
[1:02:23] like Rams and how that that would be
[1:02:25] wrote in the scripture then it would be
[1:02:28] creation that would be rejoicing because
[1:02:30] this earth knows it's already had its
[1:02:34] water baptism in the days of Noah and
[1:02:37] this earth has been waiting to come back
[1:02:40] into the control of the sons and
[1:02:43] daughters of God once again
[1:02:45] Shiva's getting anxious and so the earth
[1:02:47] itself when this Advent began to start
[1:02:50] here when when John stepped on the scene
[1:02:53] and all of this begin to come oh my the
[1:02:56] mountains themselves begin to skip like
[1:02:59] Rams the leaves were clapping their
[1:03:00] hands yet everybody else could say the
[1:03:02] leaves are doing like they normally do
[1:03:04] the mountains I don't see the mountains
[1:03:06] skipping like rounds but if they can see
[1:03:08] what was going on in the heart of the
[1:03:10] earth oh if it could be seen what's
[1:03:14] going on in the heart of the believer as
[1:03:17] the time is drawing closer all things
[1:03:20] were drawing closer
[1:03:21] hey man it's his fulfillment of his word
[1:03:25] that creates a condition in our lives
[1:03:30] here you find John coming forth very
[1:03:34] familiar passages but here John comes
[1:03:36] he's preaching in the wilderness of
[1:03:38] Judea and in verse 2 of Matthew 3 this
[1:03:41] was what he said repent repent
[1:03:51] this guy can't be saying what I think
[1:03:53] you saying repent we have the prophets
[1:03:57] we have the Psalms we have the law
[1:04:01] repent if anybody that doesn't need to
[1:04:04] repent we don't you see you see even
[1:04:13] right there they were so far removed
[1:04:19] from the heart of God you say we're
[1:04:23] gonna say no the heart of God had not
[1:04:25] come yet careful now
[1:04:26] the heart of God was already moving upon
[1:04:29] the earth it had been the heart of God
[1:04:32] that had announced even all the way down
[1:04:35] from the Garden of Eden when they walked
[1:04:37] out of Eden there and they were going on
[1:04:40] their way and the lambskins were beating
[1:04:42] against the legs the heart of God came
[1:04:45] down and spelled out love and said I'll
[1:04:48] make a way back for you the heart of God
[1:04:53] has been pressing the whole time and
[1:05:00] here he comes
[1:05:01] ministering alert this is the mountains
[1:05:05] they're gonna skip like Rams these are
[1:05:08] valleys being brought up repent ye for
[1:05:14] the kingdom of heaven is at hand what
[1:05:19] had been they here now the kingdom of
[1:05:21] heaven here there's going to be in
[1:05:22] divine issuance down into earth whereby
[1:05:26] that this kingdom will now move through
[1:05:28] the hearts of our people and then work
[1:05:31] to the full reestablishment of the
[1:05:34] kingdom of Almighty God being set up on
[1:05:38] this earth verse 3 see it's at hand
[1:05:44] verse 3 for this is he that was spoken
[1:05:48] of by the prophet Isaiah saying the
[1:05:51] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:05:52] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[1:05:55] paths straight so they knew this they
[1:05:59] knew it by the letter
[1:06:05] but here is a preparation going on
[1:06:08] because the way why does it have to be
[1:06:12] prepared because their hearts were not
[1:06:14] ready to receive him do you understand
[1:06:18] you miss disjunction you miss this
[1:06:21] necessary Junction you miss it this is
[1:06:26] why there are junctions that are put
[1:06:28] within the word this was a keystone it
[1:06:31] was pointing you realize that even they
[1:06:33] didn't have to go back even after the
[1:06:35] ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:06:37] didn't have to go back and preach the
[1:06:38] baptism of John this now had been
[1:06:40] fulfilled but they did bring along this
[1:06:43] is the fulfillment of the word when
[1:06:46] Peter stood there on the day of
[1:06:47] Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 when he
[1:06:50] began to speak what did he do he began
[1:06:52] to take up the word that now has been
[1:06:55] fulfilled
[1:06:56] that word which had been spoken and as
[1:06:58] Peter began to preach that word the
[1:07:00] Spirit of God picking that word up
[1:07:02] that was not Peter as a man that was the
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost himself that was beginning to
[1:07:07] pull that word together and connect
[1:07:09] those pieces of what was prophesied
[1:07:11] that's been fulfilled these things that
[1:07:13] were spoken now are being made manifest
[1:07:16] and what you see and you hear of a very
[1:07:19] manifestation of a promise of Almighty
[1:07:21] God what did that do it allowed the
[1:07:24] people that were there in that time
[1:07:25] they've brought conviction to their
[1:07:27] heart but it brought out of them a
[1:07:29] realization that a way is open for me
[1:07:32] but I can go free I can walk in liberty
[1:07:36] to what must we do to be saved see the
[1:07:42] preaching you in Peter spoke it brought
[1:07:44] them to a realization they needed to be
[1:07:46] safe and they could be saved the
[1:07:52] ministry the fulfillment of this word
[1:07:54] right here was to bring knowledge of
[1:07:57] salvation that's a fulfillment of this
[1:08:01] to prepare the way where it's like and
[1:08:04] where in the Orient this word is taken
[1:08:07] from where there would be different
[1:08:09] things in the roadway boulders and
[1:08:12] everything else it would be like you
[1:08:13] know coming down lake breeze
[1:08:15] this morning you know and here you come
[1:08:17] you know you know your normal timeline
[1:08:19] I'm just gonna come to church and you
[1:08:21] find there's boulders in the road you
[1:08:23] find that there's all kinds of trees
[1:08:25] that are blown over in the road you say
[1:08:29] I want to come to church what's gonna
[1:08:32] take more than a four-wheel drive to get
[1:08:34] over them boulders ain't gonna plow over
[1:08:40] see God don't plow over things in our
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] [Applause]
[1:08:45] he comes with a message of authority -
[1:08:50] clearer but we have to receive that
[1:08:54] message and when we received that
[1:08:58] message and continue to receive what is
[1:09:00] it it's God himself by his word through
[1:09:04] the spirit preparing the pathway for
[1:09:06] himself that's what the rapture the
[1:09:10] change of the body
[1:09:11] it's Christ himself culminating not only
[1:09:14] in the pathway that he had prepared but
[1:09:16] all through the journey where he had
[1:09:18] brought a people to present unto himself
[1:09:23] so to remove all those things you've got
[1:09:26] to remove all of that and that's what
[1:09:28] John's ministry was to remove and you
[1:09:30] know as I said before you look at
[1:09:32] anything
[1:09:32] remove what has to be removed we've got
[1:09:37] the word what are you talking about John
[1:09:42] remember Jesus he Jesus he told him he
[1:09:46] said search the Scriptures these were
[1:09:52] not people who did know the Scriptures
[1:09:53] they knew him but he's telling him to
[1:09:56] search to search means to think to
[1:09:59] consider think about the time that we're
[1:10:02] living him think about what the word
[1:10:04] that's being spoken think about all of
[1:10:06] these things that's something that for
[1:10:08] none of us is to take for granted hope
[1:10:12] you understand what I'm saying when you
[1:10:14] have been born again
[1:10:15] I'm not worried I'm not worried then
[1:10:18] well you know I'll be lost in me and I'm
[1:10:20] not worried about that but my heart's
[1:10:23] desire by the new
[1:10:24] is I want to walk pleasing to him when
[1:10:28] there's things that he deals with me in
[1:10:30] my life and says that is not going to go
[1:10:33] on any longer
[1:10:34] I want to line up with that word I don't
[1:10:38] want to make excuses for it
[1:10:40] I want to line up with it because you
[1:10:43] know what it is he's not against me he's
[1:10:46] preparing the way for him to further
[1:10:48] make himself known in me that's what
[1:10:51] he's doing and he gives you an idea
[1:10:53] thority to stand on that word doing me
[1:10:55] hurt no it may cut though it may look
[1:10:58] impossible but it's not you fulfilling
[1:11:01] it but it's us giving ourselves to it
[1:11:08] because you might you or me you know
[1:11:11] when God first got a hold of our life
[1:11:13] but even now there are things that you
[1:11:14] can look at right now that you might do
[1:11:16] and deal with and you think my goodness
[1:11:18] the things that God took out of my life
[1:11:20] before and what God's done in my life
[1:11:22] but now you see certain things of family
[1:11:24] strains that are boulders right you see
[1:11:28] certain parts of genetic genetic things
[1:11:30] that would be there looks like logs
[1:11:31] across the road because nobody in your
[1:11:35] family has seemingly been able to live
[1:11:37] above that but let me tell you something
[1:11:39] you are ordained you are ordained the
[1:11:42] strains in your family the strains in my
[1:11:44] family no doubt they're different your
[1:11:47] strains aren't better than my strains
[1:11:48] are worse than my strains or whatever
[1:11:50] more but the one thing about it God
[1:11:52] through his body is manifesting his
[1:11:55] power and authority as an overcomer that
[1:11:58] there will not be one thing not one
[1:11:59] complex not one family strain they'll
[1:12:02] not be one thing that this bride is not
[1:12:04] walking in victory over you have been
[1:12:07] ordained to walk in victory amen this
[1:12:12] word comes with power in the forty to do
[1:12:15] what cast out those things to remove
[1:12:18] logs that are in the road because you
[1:12:20] know what happened logs they close
[1:12:21] things up they might be beautiful but
[1:12:23] they're not beautiful in the past
[1:12:25] William we don't want things that
[1:12:26] crawled up the past
[1:12:29] because you clogged up the pathway
[1:12:31] there's a restriction of blood flow
[1:12:40] verse 5 oh my no that's like a verse 4
[1:12:43] and the same John had on a tuxedo
[1:12:51] whatever garments that they wore
[1:12:54] but he had an arraignment of camels hair
[1:12:56] a leather girdle about his loins and his
[1:12:59] meat was locusts with wild honey you
[1:13:01] know God has a sense of humor John was
[1:13:05] not dressing like this to try to make
[1:13:07] himself humble let's just clear the air
[1:13:09] real quick on that one you don't have to
[1:13:13] make yourself humble let the Spirit of
[1:13:17] God bring the humility in your life
[1:13:21] that's false that's a false humility but
[1:13:25] John here he is how God would have this
[1:13:28] to be we're all of a sudden he's in the
[1:13:30] desert and then he makes his showing
[1:13:32] when it's time his six month six months
[1:13:36] of ministry and he makes his showing at
[1:13:40] this time in the thick of it that how
[1:13:42] that the people at that time when
[1:13:43] they're watching everything take place
[1:13:45] these great refined men who had to work
[1:13:47] they're looking at him and I love how
[1:13:50] brother branham describes it he said
[1:13:52] here stepped out a man he said the ner
[1:13:53] hardly took a bath what is six to six
[1:13:55] months but Rev said he didn't brush his
[1:13:57] teeth now you young boys know well maybe
[1:14:06] some of you brothers do but
[1:14:08] you see it was a conditioned look at
[1:14:10] this how God allowed this to be it was
[1:14:13] not a condition that would appeal to the
[1:14:16] natural senses he was something too
[1:14:20] whether religious would say you you look
[1:14:26] how you dressed what does that have to
[1:14:28] do with it that absolutely means nothing
[1:14:33] nothing I'm not gonna try to set a new
[1:14:38] standard but he wouldn't make it
[1:14:39] wouldn't make a difference if I preached
[1:14:41] in jeans a little brother Sammy don't
[1:14:45] worry I'm not gonna start I'll do that
[1:14:48] on youth meetings but you understand
[1:14:51] sometimes things can become so of a
[1:14:54] formality to where we're looking for
[1:14:56] certain things that's not what we look
[1:14:58] for what we look for as believers is the
[1:15:01] Spirit of God to come down and take that
[1:15:04] word and begin to deal with our life
[1:15:06] that's who we want to see we want the
[1:15:09] real preacher to come by this way and
[1:15:12] preach to you and I we don't want
[1:15:14] sermons we want the Word of God to come
[1:15:17] and deal with our life if I've got logs
[1:15:19] in the way I want him out of the way if
[1:15:21] I've got boulders and the way I want him
[1:15:23] out of the way the Bible says they went
[1:15:31] out to him he was not going to where
[1:15:34] they were at they had to go out to him
[1:15:36] remember when Israel sinned in the
[1:15:38] wilderness God told Moses pick up the
[1:15:41] tabernacle and pitch it over here and
[1:15:44] you tell the people stripped themselves
[1:15:46] of their ornaments and they want to get
[1:15:48] right those who want to seek the Lord
[1:15:49] they must leave out of the camp and come
[1:15:52] to the tabernacle why their camp was
[1:15:55] polluted so it's showing they had to go
[1:15:59] out to him he was not a part of their
[1:16:02] systems this was a calling out
[1:16:06] I'm not calling out not a uniting with
[1:16:13] so they were looking for this great
[1:16:16] advent of the Messiah they were looking
[1:16:18] for job but what is was going to be this
[1:16:20] was going to be an anointing of their
[1:16:24] sister an anointing of their thinking
[1:16:27] surely when he comes Lord Ram describes
[1:16:29] it they'll crank the golden handle and
[1:16:31] down the corridor here here the Messiah
[1:16:34] will come right down the corridor I
[1:16:41] don't know about you but there's a lot
[1:16:44] of things that I've thought wrong and
[1:16:46] I'm so glad for his mercy that he
[1:16:49] cleanses and I'm glad that if as I can
[1:16:53] submit my heart and life to Him he will
[1:16:55] straighten out all that needs to be
[1:16:57] straightened out because he didn't call
[1:17:00] me to straighten everybody else out yeah
[1:17:02] I got enough right here with this guy I
[1:17:04] know I don't worry listen I pray for all
[1:17:06] the brothers and sisters in different
[1:17:07] ones but I got enough right here maybe
[1:17:11] putting you all down that's where my
[1:17:13] loving cares for y'all set a man
[1:17:20] stronger the first time they went out to
[1:17:25] him Jerusalem in all Judea and all the
[1:17:28] region round about Jordan and were
[1:17:30] baptized of him in Jordan confessing
[1:17:32] their sins this minute notice it's a
[1:17:36] ministry and there's confession of sins
[1:17:39] going on not just walking into a church
[1:17:42] it's not just coming a coming in and
[1:17:45] saying but I just move along with it but
[1:17:47] it's it's looking there's got to be
[1:17:48] something there must be something that
[1:17:50] would strike a harder life there's got
[1:17:52] to be a new beginning God's not going to
[1:17:57] keep on building on things that are not
[1:17:59] right i'ma give me an example if you've
[1:18:02] not been baptized in the name of the
[1:18:04] Lord Jesus Christ and you've not
[1:18:05] repented of your sins how do you expect
[1:18:07] to go any further with God that's the
[1:18:10] first base
[1:18:11] that's first base what other saying that
[1:18:15] people shouldn't do it because you tell
[1:18:16] them Peter
[1:18:17] somebody's got to save the word it's up
[1:18:20] for the word the Spirit of God to bring
[1:18:22] it to your heart for you to see where
[1:18:25] are you at and what you need to do God's
[1:18:28] not gonna rapture anything that has not
[1:18:31] come through his word Strait is the gate
[1:18:36] narrow is the way and few there be that
[1:18:40] find it but then again if I say if you
[1:18:45] don't feel - well that's up that's up to
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:48] I'm nah I can't make anything out of
[1:18:50] anybody
[1:18:51] but I can preach the word and it has to
[1:18:53] be the word that tugs your heart John
[1:18:55] was not going and gathering people up he
[1:18:57] was not rounding people up I'm telling
[1:18:59] you friends in this hour this is not a
[1:19:01] rounding people up you either want to go
[1:19:03] on and serve God or you don't you got to
[1:19:06] make up your mind either you do or you
[1:19:08] don't because the Church of the Living
[1:19:12] God we are going on now if you want to
[1:19:15] come along come along and go on northern
[1:19:26] mercy verse 7 but when he saw many of
[1:19:29] the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
[1:19:31] baptism he said unto them o generation
[1:19:34] of vipers John couldn't you have
[1:19:44] sweetness generation of vipers he's
[1:19:52] tying them in who hath warned you to
[1:19:57] flee from the wrath to come even though
[1:20:01] they were not part of the prophecy as
[1:20:05] far as to receive it and walk in it they
[1:20:07] could feel something was going on
[1:20:12] something was getting their attention oh
[1:20:16] it was an issuance of the heart of God
[1:20:19] yet they didn't know it it's like a
[1:20:20] serpent begins to run they begin to burn
[1:20:23] fire begins to come up they take they
[1:20:25] take they take flight
[1:20:27] who has warned you to flee who warned
[1:20:31] you how could he say who warned them
[1:20:33] why didn't why didn't jump just say
[1:20:35] praise be to God the Pharisees are
[1:20:37] coming down here they're gonna be bad
[1:20:39] fast
[1:20:40] it was discernment he can tail friends
[1:20:43] by the way they were coming in the next
[1:20:45] verse bring forth therefore fruits meet
[1:20:49] for repentance you realize that fruits
[1:20:53] must be present even for repentance and
[1:20:57] after you repent there will be fruits
[1:21:00] that come from that but they did not
[1:21:03] have the necessary fruit for repentance
[1:21:05] here they were coming down there and
[1:21:07] John could let them know you're not
[1:21:10] really here for this reason you're not
[1:21:13] here for the right reason thank not
[1:21:19] verse 9 look at this discernment think
[1:21:21] not to say within yourselves we have
[1:21:25] Abraham to our Father look where they're
[1:21:28] wrestling we have Abraham to our Father
[1:21:29] for I say unto you that God is able
[1:21:31] these stones to raise up children unto
[1:21:33] Abraham and now also the axe is laid
[1:21:38] unto the root of the trees therefore
[1:21:42] every tree which bringeth not forth good
[1:21:45] fruit is hewn down and cast in the fire
[1:21:50] john was declaring to them the fruit
[1:21:54] what i'm saying what is here you're not
[1:21:58] bringing the fruit for the season where
[1:22:01] your life is now it's at a saint you're
[1:22:04] out of season it's not the right season
[1:22:07] this is a season of a fulfillment of the
[1:22:10] word and you should be bringing forth
[1:22:12] fruit meat for repentance with Peters
[1:22:14] faith but the day of Pentecost what
[1:22:16] happened as the way
[1:22:18] went forth what did it do the presence
[1:22:20] of the Lord brought about the necessary
[1:22:22] fruit that was meet for repentance there
[1:22:28] was no breaking up here among these
[1:22:30] people see their whole thing repent why
[1:22:35] I got a repent they needed a breaking up
[1:22:45] how many times brother random you said
[1:22:47] he that phrase and go through it how
[1:22:48] many times I've heard him say it and
[1:22:50] then you study there just keeps saying
[1:22:51] keep looking over and the call that is
[1:22:53] going forth we need a breaking up
[1:22:55] we need an old-fashioned cleansing
[1:22:57] revival we need a break in you said
[1:22:58] brother Samuel that was looking for the
[1:23:00] seals to come oh hold on a moment now in
[1:23:03] recognizing your day in its message 1965
[1:23:06] the Prophet at the end of that message
[1:23:08] he makes a declaration God create in me
[1:23:12] a revival make me Lord God in a place to
[1:23:15] receive more of you Lord make me more
[1:23:18] humble make me more willing Lord in
[1:23:23] order for there to be a revival a
[1:23:25] revival is a breaking up and I find the
[1:23:29] Prophet pray that over and over
[1:23:32] different words but would pray it over
[1:23:35] and over I believe that's leadership for
[1:23:40] you and I am there's a need for a
[1:23:45] breaking up how that these the
[1:23:48] individuals where they're at the
[1:23:50] Pharisees and the people in that time
[1:23:52] now there were children that were were
[1:23:54] being turned and they were they were the
[1:23:57] children were actually the father's the
[1:23:59] father's were being pointed to the
[1:24:00] message of the children those that were
[1:24:02] living at the time the children that
[1:24:04] would be the children of the promise the
[1:24:06] children of Abraham all of them were
[1:24:08] seed of Abraham but not all of them were
[1:24:11] children seed of Abraham crucified him
[1:24:16] but the children didn't are you with me
[1:24:19] there's a difference in seed in children
[1:24:22] children are those who are of the
[1:24:24] promise the elect of God his smell was a
[1:24:28] seed of Abraham are you
[1:24:30] they were seeds but the children the
[1:24:33] children are accounted for the promise
[1:24:36] so how that this ministry was turning
[1:24:39] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:24:41] children
[1:24:42] this is the fulfillment of the word they
[1:24:45] needed a breaking up but you know what
[1:24:47] when they would read these words that we
[1:24:49] read in our opening text they believed
[1:24:52] there needed to be something come and
[1:24:53] removed them from the occupiers they
[1:24:56] needed to be free of this Roman
[1:24:58] occupation
[1:25:00] you see where they were at they were
[1:25:02] trying to make the world a better place
[1:25:06] you can't make the world a better place
[1:25:09] you can see look friends you can see
[1:25:12] things even from the times I don't even
[1:25:14] know where it would be at right now in
[1:25:15] education but even in the times it's
[1:25:17] things that where things are moving
[1:25:19] about in people are you know they don't
[1:25:21] know what's going on
[1:25:22] they're trying then even within where
[1:25:24] we're at right here in our place to know
[1:25:25] how they're trying to do everything in
[1:25:27] our city our county to do everything
[1:25:30] they can to control the drug traffic and
[1:25:32] everything else that's going on they're
[1:25:34] trying to do everything completely
[1:25:35] wrapping those things are going on what
[1:25:37] is it it's a heading up time it's time
[1:25:41] to be ready they men it's time to be
[1:25:45] ready and stay ready and live ready I'll
[1:25:53] tell you right now you live loose you
[1:25:55] will be left behind I'll tell you that
[1:25:59] in the name of the Lord you live of all
[1:26:03] kinds of stuff in your heart and in your
[1:26:04] life you will be left behind the rapture
[1:26:08] is not a cleansing it's a cleaning God
[1:26:12] sent a message to bring the cleansing to
[1:26:14] you and I right now the Holy Spirit to
[1:26:16] take this word and clean you and I out
[1:26:19] the rapture is not the cleansing
[1:26:21] it's the claiming of the cleansed well
[1:26:27] I'll be free of this then or I didn't
[1:26:29] know right now the power of God if you
[1:26:32] cannot believe in the power of God that
[1:26:34] will actually bring that deliverance in
[1:26:36] your life right now how can you believe
[1:26:38] it for the change of your body
[1:26:39] I'm telling you you can't God don't want
[1:26:44] you to walk with the hope so he wants
[1:26:45] you to walk with an O so not an
[1:26:48] arrogance but with you can look back and
[1:26:50] say the same God that gives me grace and
[1:26:53] strength that has changed my life
[1:26:55] that berthed is life inside of me that
[1:26:56] same God will change this body they
[1:27:04] looked at they needed free from Roman
[1:27:05] occupation
[1:27:08] we need again we need to get rid of
[1:27:10] everybody else around us everybody else
[1:27:11] is the problem get rid of them you get
[1:27:16] rid of the Romans
[1:27:17] we'll be better off that's not true I
[1:27:21] said that's not true
[1:27:23] to a believer you can live victorious in
[1:27:27] the midst of hell God come into the fact
[1:27:33] Herron Age commended the Pergamon age
[1:27:35] right there in Satan seen in fact our
[1:27:38] age when it was the darkest the hardest
[1:27:40] to be able to work yet God commended him
[1:27:42] for their work in labor of love
[1:27:44] Levin said God was showing that in the
[1:27:46] face of all that in the darkest of time
[1:27:48] to the how that Satan could not stop the
[1:27:51] work of God as a matter of fact it was
[1:27:53] more strengthened during that time tell
[1:27:59] you friends I don't mean to put nobody
[1:28:01] down but I've got to preach the word
[1:28:02] straight here there ain't no time to be
[1:28:06] looking for sympathy on things in your
[1:28:08] life God has given if God has given us a
[1:28:11] word and he has and then it's up to you
[1:28:14] and I had to reach up and say God Lord
[1:28:16] your word all that I have need of Lord
[1:28:18] God what I need Lord is in you Lord
[1:28:21] Jesus and turn it down in your life
[1:28:25] though brother shall not keep coming
[1:28:28] back service after service but yet have
[1:28:30] you really given yourself to him are you
[1:28:33] nursing on the promise but you cannot
[1:28:35] nurse on the promise with all gems in
[1:28:39] your life art and bitterness and
[1:28:42] everything else against people you can't
[1:28:43] do that with them kind of boulders but
[1:28:46] saying I've got a right that you do but
[1:28:48] if you're a lamb you'll forfeit it
[1:28:53] this is where the part of Isaiah 53 he
[1:28:57] was led as a lamb dumb before her
[1:29:00] Shearer's it's a need of a breaking up
[1:29:08] before God can add to you there's
[1:29:12] breaking up they didn't realize the
[1:29:17] biggest enemy they had was themselves
[1:29:23] their biggest enemy was themselves they
[1:29:25] needed a birth by the way he came showed
[1:29:31] him what they needed they believed they
[1:29:34] needed a great general he gave him a
[1:29:36] baby what was he showing I myself came
[1:29:40] to the earth in birth so that you might
[1:29:44] be born again he was showing them this
[1:29:49] is what the advent was all about but see
[1:29:51] the simplest of things the overlooked
[1:29:57] you're made to live victorious friends
[1:29:59] that's absolute truth don't you let the
[1:30:02] devil tell you that there's got to be
[1:30:03] this kind of condition this kind of
[1:30:05] condition no no it's not that kind of a
[1:30:07] condition that allows you to live
[1:30:08] victorious it might you might feel more
[1:30:10] comfortable but you were born to
[1:30:13] overcome there are things that can be
[1:30:17] uncomfortable but as you're taking in of
[1:30:18] that word and living under the presence
[1:30:20] of Almighty God God will give you
[1:30:22] strength to move give you strength to
[1:30:25] subdue those things you see this here
[1:30:31] let me just I'm going to kind of take a
[1:30:32] little bit of a turn here now when we
[1:30:38] look at this the scriptures have talked
[1:30:40] about the tender mercies of God and
[1:30:42] you're familiar with that I've referred
[1:30:43] to those things but yet you you've read
[1:30:46] them as Bible readers and here we find
[1:30:48] in the scriptures right here it says to
[1:30:51] perform the mercy that was promised when
[1:30:57] God would these would be expressed in
[1:30:59] the Old Testament of his tender mercies
[1:31:02] you find David would write of him you
[1:31:05] would speak of at the tender mercies but
[1:31:07] yet the tender mercies were not just
[1:31:09] they're not just something that was just
[1:31:11] as we would say a sentimental not just
[1:31:16] that of a love that just reaches down in
[1:31:19] a manner and says well I see how you are
[1:31:22] and I understand that you can never know
[1:31:26] no no but his tender mercies as a matter
[1:31:29] of fact the Prophet would describe it
[1:31:31] like this that when the prophets
[1:31:33] themselves were sent by God to Israel he
[1:31:36] said it was the tender mercies because
[1:31:40] after all tender mercies are the depth
[1:31:42] of his love his love when the Bible says
[1:31:45] love covers a multitude of sin it
[1:31:48] doesn't mean that love makes excuses for
[1:31:51] sin love deals with sin that's the real
[1:31:55] covering none makes excuses for it it
[1:32:00] deals with it sometimes what people call
[1:32:06] love and not love at all it is it is let
[1:32:09] me correct them but it's on the spectrum
[1:32:11] as the Prophet could talk about that
[1:32:13] love it goes from the uttermost filth to
[1:32:16] that of agape so then you can look and
[1:32:19] say my one is being said or done we're
[1:32:22] on that spectrum is that coming from
[1:32:24] because when it comes down to it will
[1:32:27] God does the love of God project itself
[1:32:30] within that manner so the tender mercies
[1:32:32] of God when we look at it to even think
[1:32:35] for his tender mercies to send the
[1:32:38] prophets to Israel to turn him back that
[1:32:40] was God's love he didn't want to see him
[1:32:42] go that way the tender mercies of God
[1:32:46] that would speak to you and I and call
[1:32:48] us if the ways that might be stranger or
[1:32:51] lukewarmness or things that might be
[1:32:54] creeping in in your life
[1:32:55] it's the mercies of God the tender
[1:32:57] mercies of God is the tender mercy of
[1:33:00] God to call hearts and lives to
[1:33:02] repentance yes sir it's the tender
[1:33:06] mercies of God to bring real genuine
[1:33:08] conviction
[1:33:12] Israel getting back in their homeland it
[1:33:14] was the tender hand of Jehovah he would
[1:33:23] not be classified by just people looking
[1:33:26] at it in that way it would they would
[1:33:28] look at him and say oh no that I
[1:33:29] couldn't tenderness that was harshness
[1:33:30] but he was the tender hand so this
[1:33:34] tenderness that we look out here I'm
[1:33:36] just I'm making a turn here now in Luke
[1:33:38] and Luke 1 where we were looking for our
[1:33:40] text the Bible had spoke in verse 78 of
[1:33:43] Luke 1 through the tender mercy of our
[1:33:45] God whereby the Dayspring from on high
[1:33:47] hath visited us to give light to them
[1:33:51] that said in darkness and the shadow of
[1:33:52] death to guide our feet into the way of
[1:33:55] peace the Dayspring that promise that
[1:34:00] was being looked for the day's spring
[1:34:03] there had been arising in the ministry
[1:34:07] of john when this would start here even
[1:34:09] as this was being prophesied here there
[1:34:12] is an announcement that day is fixing to
[1:34:15] dawn well is it isn't announcing a day
[1:34:18] that's coming the word the water has
[1:34:22] already prophesied of the day God is not
[1:34:25] repeating himself like they think he did
[1:34:27] in Genesis he simply announcing what has
[1:34:30] been prophesied this is the time let
[1:34:33] there be light it was announcing the day
[1:34:39] what day the day of redemption yes here
[1:34:44] Amen this is the the the the the
[1:34:48] entering of ray of redemption to the
[1:34:51] Daystar how did this come through the
[1:34:54] tender mercy of our God
[1:34:55] I wonder if we asked the religious men
[1:35:00] in that time what do you think about
[1:35:01] John I think he's harsh I think he needs
[1:35:05] what may have a little bit more manners
[1:35:07] I'd rather he didn't use such sharp
[1:35:09] terms like that as Vipers and things
[1:35:10] like that
[1:35:11] I mean if he wants to use them that way
[1:35:12] and feel that way he my dread he
[1:35:15] wouldn't do it like that
[1:35:21] but to say to ask them do you think this
[1:35:24] is the tender mercy oh no not him you
[1:35:31] see their conception of tender mercy was
[1:35:35] wrong it's just like our conception of
[1:35:39] real genuine humility can be wrong too
[1:35:41] you can meet somebody that can be ever
[1:35:44] so sweet oh they have such a sweet
[1:35:46] spirit I've met a lot of people that got
[1:35:47] nice sweet spirits but you cross someone
[1:35:49] time all oh brother Samuel there's an
[1:35:54] allowance for all that really friends
[1:35:56] what I look for is is not when I see
[1:35:58] these things where somebody has a nice
[1:36:00] sweet spirit and they can do this and so
[1:36:01] forth do that but this is what the Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit is one within us the Bible says
[1:36:06] he'll lead and guide us into all truth
[1:36:07] well if he will lead us then we must be
[1:36:09] able to be led so if a person cannot be
[1:36:12] led and be in subjection to the word
[1:36:14] they do not have it I don't care how
[1:36:17] sweet it is over the same girl how could
[1:36:19] that be you tell me how that those
[1:36:21] virtues could dwell in somebody nature
[1:36:23] given but yet not be what God accepts
[1:36:27] that could be ever so temperament ever
[1:36:31] so much virtue ever so much knowledge
[1:36:33] and yet it's not even recognized as a
[1:36:35] building of God through the tender mercy
[1:36:44] of our God
[1:36:46] this word tender I begin to look at this
[1:36:49] and boy things just further exploded
[1:36:53] yesterday on me I began to look at this
[1:36:56] and I began to just look over let me
[1:36:58] just read it here the bowels were
[1:37:00] regarded by the Hebrews out of this the
[1:37:02] word tender as the seat of the tenderer
[1:37:05] affections kindness benevolence
[1:37:07] Compassion's a heart in which mercy
[1:37:10] resides
[1:37:11] so just in case you're wondering where
[1:37:15] mercy ought to be it ought to be in yet
[1:37:19] it ought to be in your heart but the
[1:37:23] next little part that goes along with
[1:37:24] this right here that this word in the
[1:37:26] Greek which I don't know how to
[1:37:27] pronounce this word is also strengthened
[1:37:31] from the word spleen which is the spleen
[1:37:35] the spleen in the body the spleen for
[1:37:42] science lesson Wow y'all ready for a
[1:37:44] science lesson I'm tell you what we just
[1:37:47] had a metal lesson right you got people
[1:37:51] in here ready to be steel workers after
[1:37:53] Thursday night it's not me it's them
[1:37:57] we're not gonna be steel workers we just
[1:37:59] lets us know we're the ones being worked
[1:38:00] on so notice of how that the spleen
[1:38:05] itself is an organ in the far left part
[1:38:08] of the admin abdomen to the left of the
[1:38:10] stomach the spleen varies in size and
[1:38:13] shape between people but it's commonly
[1:38:15] fish shaped purple and about 4 inches
[1:38:17] long because the spleen is protected by
[1:38:20] the ribcage you can't easily feel it
[1:38:22] unless it's abnormally enlarged the
[1:38:26] spleen plays an important or a multiple
[1:38:28] supporting roles in the body it acts as
[1:38:31] a filter for blood as part of the immune
[1:38:35] system all the red blood cells are
[1:38:39] recycled in the spleen and platelets and
[1:38:42] white blood cells are stored there the
[1:38:45] spleen also helps fight certain kinds of
[1:38:48] bacteria that cause pneumonia and
[1:38:50] meningitis so how it works is as the
[1:38:53] blood enters the spleen the healthy
[1:38:56] blood cells pass on through the healthy
[1:39:00] blood cells pass right on through but
[1:39:03] but damaged and get blood cells get
[1:39:06] caught in a series of narrow passages
[1:39:09] and then get broken down so the spleen
[1:39:14] itself is there to pass on the good
[1:39:17] blood cells but it's there to correct
[1:39:22] bad blood cells thank God for a
[1:39:28] spiritual spleen
[1:39:34] so the heart of God when we're looking
[1:39:37] how that the spleen would work in
[1:39:38] conjunction with the heart because in
[1:39:40] this passage of scripture says the
[1:39:42] tender mercies of our God
[1:39:44] so the tender mercy is referring to that
[1:39:46] bed that where it's deep seated here
[1:39:48] within the spleen so what does the
[1:39:50] spleen in the heart have to do with one
[1:39:51] another
[1:39:52] stay with me we understand when we look
[1:39:55] at this at the heart itself morale
[1:39:57] brother Brennan would say in countless
[1:39:58] times in the message and he would talk
[1:40:01] about he says I used to think that God
[1:40:04] was angry with me but Jesus loves me I
[1:40:08] used to think that I'll tell you what to
[1:40:13] me when I look at that it wasn't a bit
[1:40:15] of pride about that at all he never said
[1:40:18] I had it right the whole time that have
[1:40:21] been pride God couldn't use me I used to
[1:40:23] think it type that in sometimes I used
[1:40:25] to think any man what about in you and I
[1:40:30] can we type it in in ours oh no not my
[1:40:35] database mine is authenticated yeah it's
[1:40:40] probably cryptid and everything else -
[1:40:42] better make sure they don't have no
[1:40:43] viruses in it you've got it up to date
[1:40:50] so here Christ being the very heart of
[1:40:53] God now once you think of this for a
[1:40:55] moment
[1:40:55] God's desire has been made known even
[1:41:00] from the heavens the Bible says in
[1:41:03] Psalms my team that he has he declared
[1:41:06] his firmament his work in the heavens
[1:41:10] they declared his handiwork and it
[1:41:12] speaks of how men all of those the
[1:41:14] planets the celestial bodies they're how
[1:41:16] they're all these bodies are all set
[1:41:18] forth and yet he says in the midst of it
[1:41:20] he had put the tabernacle for the Sun
[1:41:23] and he would speak about that when that
[1:41:26] Sun itself would be like a bridegroom
[1:41:30] coming out of a chamber a strong one
[1:41:34] what was he doing casting forth his
[1:41:36] light throughout that plane he was
[1:41:41] letting it be known that
[1:41:43] his desire was to be the center of it
[1:41:47] all
[1:41:47] he's been the center of it all but his
[1:41:51] desire was more than just to be the
[1:41:55] center of the songs the center of the
[1:41:58] profits the center of the Bible he
[1:42:01] wanted to be the center in you and me
[1:42:04] that was only a type of what he desired
[1:42:07] to be in you and me the center in our
[1:42:11] lives even to see where that he would
[1:42:15] tell Moses Moses in Exodus 25 when Moses
[1:42:19] is up there on the mountain he would
[1:42:20] tell Moses go and tell the people let
[1:42:25] them make me a sanctuary
[1:42:29] he didn't say let him make me a
[1:42:31] tabernacle I hope you're with me now God
[1:42:34] don't want to just dwell on flesh there
[1:42:37] had to come a tabernacle that was
[1:42:39] willing to give his life but he did not
[1:42:43] ask him to build him a tabernacle he
[1:42:47] didn't just want to come on the spirit
[1:42:49] realm he said let him make me a
[1:42:50] sanctuary that sanctuary is the secret
[1:42:55] of the Most High it's a sanctuary his
[1:42:59] dwelling place the heart the soul let
[1:43:04] them how can they make him a sanctuary
[1:43:07] because he provides the necessary
[1:43:10] conditions for the people to walk in it
[1:43:14] and become a dwelling place God has let
[1:43:19] this be known there was here the
[1:43:22] unfolding of this revelation become more
[1:43:25] clear Israel chose a man after their own
[1:43:30] choosing but God gave him grace but Saul
[1:43:36] kept doing what Saul wanted to do and
[1:43:43] eventually as he kept on intruding into
[1:43:45] places that he had no business intruding
[1:43:48] why did he do it he became impatient
[1:43:52] it showed he could not wait on the word
[1:43:56] to be fulfilled wait on the word to be
[1:43:59] fulfilled what does that have to do
[1:44:01] he couldn't Eve you mean to tell me
[1:44:03] because he'll in an offer to sacrifice
[1:44:05] he couldn't wait on the word to be
[1:44:07] fulfilled because the word is fulfilled
[1:44:09] in a season by divine order and even in
[1:44:13] the little thing he for Sukkot little
[1:44:20] foxes spoiled by it's not the big things
[1:44:25] we leave undone it's the little thing so
[1:44:32] here was a man that did not come seeking
[1:44:35] this position but he was ordained for it
[1:44:37] he was a man after God's own heart God
[1:44:43] sought him out just like God is
[1:44:46] something you and I out just like God
[1:44:49] would would seek you out this morning
[1:44:51] that's an older man a young man a young
[1:44:53] lady all alone God seeking you out for
[1:44:56] what someone after his own heart that he
[1:45:00] might commune with and make know what
[1:45:02] his desires are he could not make known
[1:45:04] his desires to saw he could press the
[1:45:08] phone David about building a house and
[1:45:10] then turn around and tell David David
[1:45:12] you're not the guy that's going to do it
[1:45:13] but David would come around in that say
[1:45:16] chapter ii samuel 7 and say Lord what
[1:45:21] thou has revealed to me I shall pray for
[1:45:23] this slide that I there will be a house
[1:45:27] established that my name will be a
[1:45:30] seller he took comfort in what the word
[1:45:33] that was spoken it was not him that
[1:45:35] would bring it to past but he said it'll
[1:45:37] be your son he was comforted in the word
[1:45:41] and he could pray over not become
[1:45:43] frustrated about it he was a man after
[1:45:47] God's own heart David oh my he had his
[1:45:49] flaws just like you and I have our flaws
[1:45:52] but David was a man after God's own
[1:45:55] heart Abraham had his flaws but Nehemiah
[1:45:58] chapter 9 said thou found this Abraham
[1:46:01] had a faithful heart o Lord
[1:46:03] what was it was faithful his heart
[1:46:08] what's God after the heart that was the
[1:46:12] same way with their Jeremiah Isaiah all
[1:46:14] the elect nouns are hot he had their
[1:46:15] heart
[1:46:16] he didn't demand their heart he he
[1:46:20] received their heart I want you to look
[1:46:23] at this for a moment we're talking about
[1:46:25] David David who could shout about the
[1:46:31] law of God the long cadenza the long
[1:46:36] doesn't doesn't offer to your grace but
[1:46:39] David said that love is sweet Oh God
[1:46:43] see it's how you look at the word David
[1:46:48] was able to look at the word knowing
[1:46:50] that the word was not against him his
[1:46:52] love for the word the word was working
[1:46:54] and bringing out in David's life what
[1:46:56] needed to be brought out glory if David
[1:47:02] could shout about that lord have mercy
[1:47:03] what we be doing oh ma look at David
[1:47:10] here let me read a few places here David
[1:47:13] says in Psalms 25 verse 6 remember O
[1:47:17] Lord thy tender mercies and thy
[1:47:21] loving-kindness for they have been ever
[1:47:24] evolved remember not the sins of my
[1:47:28] youth nor my transgressions according to
[1:47:32] thy mercy remember that many for that
[1:47:34] goodness sake o Lord watch this
[1:47:39] David is directing the attention of the
[1:47:43] Lord how can a man like this direct the
[1:47:47] attention of God how can David tell god
[1:47:50] what to remember and what not to
[1:47:52] remember he's not doing this arrogantly
[1:47:54] how can he did this what what is this
[1:47:57] it's because David is connected with the
[1:48:01] heart of God the heart of God is
[1:48:04] pulsating
[1:48:11] it's pulsating and david realizes he's
[1:48:15] walking in fellowship in step with what
[1:48:21] god has revealed to him so david could
[1:48:25] say remember lord that tender mercies
[1:48:28] but remember not her like how could
[1:48:30] David say remember not because there was
[1:48:32] a sacrifice that was before him he was
[1:48:37] connected to that sacrifice I hope
[1:48:39] you're with me now
[1:48:41] David had that authority to believe that
[1:48:45] you see down through the ages you've
[1:48:49] heard this maybe for some of you you
[1:48:51] have it but in all of them down through
[1:48:55] time not only the prophets but many
[1:48:57] others it was Christ in them it was
[1:49:01] Christ indeed it was Christ in Moses it
[1:49:06] was Christ in on and on it was Christ
[1:49:09] when the Bible says in Isaiah 53 I don't
[1:49:12] remember the exact verse but when it
[1:49:14] says he is despised and rejected not was
[1:49:17] not will be is despised and rejected
[1:49:20] Christ has always been despised and
[1:49:24] rejected in every generation but he's
[1:49:29] also been accepted it's not Moses let's
[1:49:36] look here just for a moment let me break
[1:49:37] over now as a a63 we're here that Isaiah
[1:49:44] would speak about the restoration time
[1:49:46] he would talk about the loving I will
[1:49:48] mention of the loving-kindnesses of the
[1:49:50] Lord and the praises of the Lord
[1:49:52] according to all that the Lord had
[1:49:53] bestowed on us and the great goodness
[1:49:55] toward the house of Israel which he had
[1:49:57] bestowed on them according to His
[1:49:58] mercies and according to the multitude
[1:50:00] of his loving-kindness for he said
[1:50:02] surely they are my people children that
[1:50:05] will not lie so he was their Savior in
[1:50:09] all their affliction he was afflicted
[1:50:12] and the angel of his presence save them
[1:50:18] who's the angel of his presence Christ
[1:50:23] not to separate people
[1:50:25] it's Christ the heart of God what was a
[1:50:31] written promise
[1:50:33] now that written promise begin to have
[1:50:35] life pumping through a promise of
[1:50:44] deliverance out of the bondage in Egypt
[1:50:47] which was a type of deliverance for us
[1:50:49] out of bondage and the Spirit of God
[1:50:53] began to move upon that promise and what
[1:50:55] is it it's the heart of God it begins to
[1:51:01] because in the heart of God going forth
[1:51:05] when the Israel had sinned out there
[1:51:09] made the golden calf went the way they
[1:51:11] went
[1:51:12] but Moses stood in the breach and when
[1:51:17] God told Moses get out of the way I'm
[1:51:21] gonna kill every one of them and I'm
[1:51:22] going to start a new generation with you
[1:51:26] notice Moses said repent a lot for this
[1:51:30] turn from this Lord what did Moses put
[1:51:35] before God his word all the way down
[1:51:40] through the scriptures you find over and
[1:51:41] over remember that word Oh Lord to
[1:51:43] Abraham remember that word Oh Lord
[1:51:45] remember why this is his world I tell
[1:51:49] you the coming of this message right now
[1:51:51] to you and I it is God remembering his
[1:51:54] word hallelujah he's remember his word
[1:51:58] he descended in Revelations in one
[1:52:01] rainbow about his head his mind on the
[1:52:04] Covenant he had remembered his covenant
[1:52:08] that he spoke he remembered what he said
[1:52:12] to you he's remembered with a promise
[1:52:14] that he has quickened BR he's remembered
[1:52:16] the healing he's remembered to deliver
[1:52:18] it he has remembered his word the angel
[1:52:25] of his presence was there to save them
[1:52:30] God couldn't cross over Moses cuz he
[1:52:33] looked in Moses what did he see Christ
[1:52:36] he saw the cross
[1:52:38] no wonder the Prophet could stop in the
[1:52:40] middle of the message presuming and say
[1:52:42] oh the power of the believer the power
[1:52:46] of the believer surely he must be
[1:52:50] talking about shutting the heavens no
[1:52:51] he's talking about us shutting off
[1:52:53] things from entering into our lives to
[1:52:55] whether we're ready to span the breach
[1:52:58] for one another come on somebody you
[1:53:02] don't span the breach for somebody else
[1:53:04] by running somebody else down does it
[1:53:10] let us be really clear on that one right
[1:53:11] there hear how that this David is is
[1:53:15] tied in David would speak in Psalm 51
[1:53:18] after what had happened with between him
[1:53:21] and Bathsheba here's David in Psalms 51
[1:53:25] verse 1 have mercy on me O God according
[1:53:28] to thy loving-kindness according to the
[1:53:31] multitude of thy tender mercies blot out
[1:53:34] my transgressions I hope you
[1:53:38] understanding here David is not
[1:53:40] communing with a dead word I hope we can
[1:53:44] see that the heart of God is not a
[1:53:45] letter it's a person of Christ
[1:53:49] we're not communing with the letter
[1:53:51] we're not being built up with doctrines
[1:53:53] and yet we're powerless if we're without
[1:53:57] power we've missed it it's not about the
[1:54:02] doctrines if you have the right if you
[1:54:05] have been born of the Spirit of God
[1:54:06] don't worry the bark will be on the tree
[1:54:09] yes it will the Spirit of God within you
[1:54:12] he will lead and guide you into all
[1:54:13] truth but sometimes it's so much weight
[1:54:19] had been placed upon the doctrine and
[1:54:22] yet we've got people in our ranks that
[1:54:24] our doctrines feel listen friends I'm
[1:54:27] not saying that to be hard I'm saying
[1:54:28] that that's a report of concern you
[1:54:31] think even though the falling away that
[1:54:33] we've had with that people that could
[1:54:34] rehearse doctrines Mandic could preach
[1:54:37] doctrine some of them some of them when
[1:54:39] they preach that in no one the world is
[1:54:41] ever
[1:54:41] anyhow sounded like a rabbit running
[1:54:43] around a tree I'm not saying that
[1:54:45] disrespectful I'm just telling you the
[1:54:47] truth now maybe somebody else thought
[1:54:49] they'd and you know maybe they did
[1:54:50] something good friends I'm not saying it
[1:54:52] because I judge other ministries I'm
[1:54:53] just saying I never could make sense of
[1:54:54] what in the world they were even trying
[1:54:55] to get to but you know what it's clear
[1:54:58] it wouldn't reveal to him but what I'm
[1:55:01] saying is is that even for a person to
[1:55:03] know doctor and doctor and doctor and
[1:55:04] doctor induction doesn't mean it's been
[1:55:06] revealed when it's been revealed it's a
[1:55:09] life of Christ inside of you people are
[1:55:14] gonna know all these Ducks out telling
[1:55:16] you right now there's quotes I could
[1:55:17] finish when I was way out in the world
[1:55:19] I didn't could finish him I could tell
[1:55:22] you I could quote her that wasn't right
[1:55:27] though I knew him oh to sit down and
[1:55:30] challenge somebody on serpents eat yeah
[1:55:32] even when I was out in the world but my
[1:55:36] life what kind of life did I live at
[1:55:38] that time see the life did not match but
[1:55:44] there's got to be a life on the inside
[1:55:49] life not a lifestyle a life let me hurry
[1:55:56] up here brought out David he's awareness
[1:56:00] that this person to blot out my
[1:56:02] transgressions to wash me thoroughly
[1:56:05] from my iniquity and cleanse me from my
[1:56:08] sin David knew God in this way without
[1:56:13] even having the new birth that you and I
[1:56:15] have he knew the power of God to be able
[1:56:20] to wash not God not as a letter a word
[1:56:23] but he knew you as a person
[1:56:25] now once you think of this the heart of
[1:56:29] God here's the heart of God moving in
[1:56:32] and the heart of God with the tender
[1:56:36] mercies of God as we bring those two
[1:56:38] together it not only comes forth to deal
[1:56:41] with the heart that would bring us to
[1:56:43] himself but he's not going to
[1:56:47] recirculate the same old life he's got
[1:56:51] to be able to cleanse the life
[1:56:54] he's got to be able to set you in a
[1:56:57] three the heart and the spleen coming
[1:57:01] together this is the tender mercy of God
[1:57:02] hey man were here himself he was able to
[1:57:05] come on the scene where an animal
[1:57:07] sacrifice had no soul in it it could not
[1:57:12] come back upon the worshipper
[1:57:13] but Christ Himself came and he made his
[1:57:17] soul and offering for sin in the
[1:57:20] shedding of his blood his soul was
[1:57:24] offered up for our sin so that that life
[1:57:27] might come back upon you and I bring you
[1:57:29] an eye into that blood cell I'll tell
[1:57:32] your brother and sister a blood
[1:57:36] transfusion it brings a change
[1:57:38] when the heart of God being connected
[1:57:41] with the heart of God it brings a change
[1:57:43] it has the power within it this when
[1:57:46] this Lord Jesus Christ has the power
[1:57:48] within it to bring about change in a
[1:57:51] person's life
[1:57:52] because inside of that blood cell the
[1:57:55] things of the world cannot remain the
[1:57:57] Bible says if you love the world or the
[1:57:59] things of the world the love of God has
[1:58:01] never entered into your heart what
[1:58:04] brothers saying I don't smoke I don't
[1:58:05] drink if you love fussin if you love
[1:58:08] sighted if you're a filled with
[1:58:09] bitterness it shows of that you're okay
[1:58:11] with that and you've always got an or to
[1:58:14] stick in there is something wrong with
[1:58:16] your soul its lungs that need to be
[1:58:21] cleared out
[1:58:22] it's boulders that need to be removed
[1:58:25] amen the heart of God the spleen there
[1:58:28] the tender mercies what is it doing it's
[1:58:30] cleansing it will not allow the
[1:58:32] recirculating of damaged blood cells sin
[1:58:39] cannot dwell in the blood of Jesus
[1:58:41] Christ sin cannot reside and dwell in
[1:58:45] the soul of a believer no sir
[1:58:49] once it has been quickened there's been
[1:58:53] that birth that has taken place but
[1:58:55] cleansing you say oh brother Samuel I
[1:58:58] have problems with this and I have
[1:58:59] problems with that listen friends there
[1:59:01] is one who is greater than wall problems
[1:59:04] that you have
[1:59:06] but listen don't make excuses for him
[1:59:09] well my daddy had this my mama had this
[1:59:11] oh brother Sam you it's just a little
[1:59:13] lust it's just a little drink once in a
[1:59:15] while you need to have a real
[1:59:17] transfusion
[1:59:18] Paul brother send you you know it's just
[1:59:20] a little bit of pornography it's just a
[1:59:22] little bit of this it's just a little
[1:59:24] bit of that that's not just a little bit
[1:59:26] if you're making excuses for there needs
[1:59:29] to be a transfusion not an adding to God
[1:59:32] can add to your life there's got to be a
[1:59:36] transfusion and if there's a call for a
[1:59:38] transfusion there's got to be one
[1:59:44] present who can actually bring about the
[1:59:47] necessary change where he can actually
[1:59:54] give you his life listen friends a
[1:59:57] person could live above all of those
[2:00:00] things right there
[2:00:01] whatever was mentioned can live above
[2:00:03] all of that and still not with it the
[2:00:06] question becomes this morning is he your
[2:00:09] life is he the center of your life
[2:00:17] what brother saying I love him I didn't
[2:00:19] ask you that I said is he the center of
[2:00:22] your life
[2:00:24] is he your all you know is your delight
[2:00:29] to please him or would you rather please
[2:00:32] the bosses more would you rather display
[2:00:36] yourself before others or be able to
[2:00:38] display a heart before God where there
[2:00:40] is a sincere life that's lived before
[2:00:43] God listen friends it's not knowing all
[2:00:45] the chapters all the verses and being
[2:00:46] able to recite that there's many people
[2:00:49] know how to understand me that are
[2:00:50] inhale right now this morning that can
[2:00:52] recite all those things that's not what
[2:00:55] it's about you miss the life you miss
[2:00:57] everything let's be clear on this what
[2:01:01] they thought they needed they felt wrong
[2:01:05] what they needed was the visitation that
[2:01:09] was promised a deliverance of themselves
[2:01:14] I'm telling you this morning you don't
[2:01:16] have to live where you've been living
[2:01:19] you don't have to live there he made a
[2:01:22] way for you that you could live in walk
[2:01:25] in victory that it's a life that is
[2:01:29] reflected through you the it's a
[2:01:31] pulsation of your heart you realize but
[2:01:34] right now there's times and maybe you've
[2:01:35] been sitting here and no doubt mine you
[2:01:38] know my my pulse maybe it's been up over
[2:01:40] a hundred here
[2:01:40] well I preached and then other times you
[2:01:42] know my pulse will rest at forty seven
[2:01:44] but then in between those times what is
[2:01:46] it there's different there's movements
[2:01:48] that's going on it's a pulsation that's
[2:01:52] calling blood is pumping even when
[2:01:55] you're just sitting right there even
[2:01:56] when you're sleeping blood has been
[2:01:58] pumping through the body you say what
[2:01:59] are you saying I'm saying whether you're
[2:02:01] in church or you're out of church you're
[2:02:02] a Christian you don't matter where you
[2:02:04] are at on the job or whatever you're a
[2:02:06] Christian because why you're connected
[2:02:11] with the heart of God it's God's heart
[2:02:14] that's pulsating through you what you do
[2:02:20] you have access to him my little
[2:02:27] children I rather do you say not but if
[2:02:30] you sin we have an advocate with Jesus
[2:02:33] Christ the righteous what is it
[2:02:36] connected with the propitiation it's
[2:02:41] taken in that word here you are
[2:02:42] receiving that word into your life
[2:02:44] what's he doing you're taking in that
[2:02:47] word but Simon I don't feel no different
[2:02:49] now I I really don't feel I don't feel
[2:02:51] anything at all no you got to let that
[2:02:53] blood flow you see what happens is the
[2:02:55] little heart itself will actually reach
[2:02:57] over there and it will put the left
[2:02:58] ventricle will put that blood over into
[2:03:00] the lungs to get it oxygen oxygenated
[2:03:03] then it will pull that blood back over
[2:03:05] and send it out down through your body
[2:03:07] through the right through the right
[2:03:08] artery there it'll send it out with
[2:03:10] oxygen in it it sends it out with
[2:03:12] nutrients in it you realize it's the
[2:03:13] blood that carries the nutrients it not
[2:03:16] only carries the oxygen and the
[2:03:18] nutrients that are needed to every one
[2:03:20] of our little cells but in those cells
[2:03:22] is also another place to where on the
[2:03:25] outside of it they are actually able to
[2:03:27] dispensed all of the metallic waste that
[2:03:30] is in a cell and that blood itself
[2:03:32] begins to take and pack that metallic
[2:03:34] waste away what's it doing it's taking
[2:03:36] it back for cleansing now I'm so glad
[2:03:38] that we are in contact with the very
[2:03:42] heart of God amen
[2:03:44] whereby between our lives there is a
[2:03:47] flow of that blood to do what will being
[2:03:51] washed by the water you'll be able to
[2:03:57] wash to be able to take the nutrients to
[2:04:01] where it needs to go in my life and be
[2:04:04] able to take away the waste and then all
[2:04:07] the cells that are there all it might be
[2:04:08] a damaged cell somebody said something
[2:04:12] about you somebody thought something
[2:04:13] about you somebody - damaged cell you
[2:04:16] know brother Brahma said you got to
[2:04:17] watch themselves he said then
[2:04:18] backslidden cells can start a cancer in
[2:04:19] the church lord have mercy I'm preaching
[2:04:23] weeks ahead now but it can start a bat
[2:04:25] it can start a situation but that's why
[2:04:28] there's got to be blood flow you've got
[2:04:32] to identify that cancer call it out for
[2:04:34] what it is and allow what allow the
[2:04:37] blood the blood stream it will cleanse
[2:04:45] this is for you this is for me the heart
[2:04:50] of God brought in contact with this
[2:04:54] heart not just when I say contact just
[2:04:56] to come near but come into him into this
[2:04:59] blood cell to where it's his life
[2:05:12] so doing it's circulating the blood this
[2:05:15] is a living living body it's not a dead
[2:05:24] it's a living body for he said I am the
[2:05:29] heart I'm divine and ye are the arteries
[2:05:34] the veins the capillaries the branches
[2:05:37] where the mem says what that blood all
[2:05:40] in the heart of God he said setting in
[2:05:41] the midst of the church he said when the
[2:05:44] heart of God goes to pumping the blood
[2:05:47] of God he said Paul Saints through the
[2:05:49] Church of the Living God it posses
[2:05:53] pulsation what is it it's God's
[2:05:55] heartbeat pulsating moving dealing with
[2:05:59] our life I need you look at God that
[2:06:10] pulsation Lord God - where there's
[2:06:13] things that has the blood goes through
[2:06:14] out of those cells comes things that
[2:06:18] passes back through and the spleen is
[2:06:20] right there - says come on come on bring
[2:06:23] the waste products here I'll take those
[2:06:26] waste products I'll recycle them I'll
[2:06:28] turn them around what are you talking
[2:06:30] about I'll take dirty laundry and make
[2:06:32] clean laundry out of it I will give you
[2:06:37] beauty for Ashes the heart of God Christ

[2:06:48] upon our lives you love him just make up
[2:06:55] in your mind make up in your heart right

[2:07:39] you something his heart is for you that
[2:07:45] God would come and speak to our hearts
[2:07:47] in this way brother Branham addresses it
[2:07:50] to a group of people in conference with
[2:07:51] God he said when you sitting there and
[2:07:53] saying oh brother Branham God can do
[2:07:56] without me he said oh oh no God can't do
[2:07:59] without you he came all the way he put
[2:08:06] his heart in it he didn't come just
[2:08:10] haphazardly he put his heart and he just
[2:08:16] didn't put his heart in it his heart all
[2:08:26] that God was he poured into Christ all
[2:08:30] the Christ was he poured into the church

[2:12:39] morning Lord that does not know you I
[2:12:42] would not want to let this time go by
[2:12:44] I don't know Lord sometimes I look
[2:12:47] across I see different faces sometimes
[2:12:49] Lord as long as I would have my glasses
[2:12:51] on and sometimes Lord I
[2:12:53] I don't know Lord where people are at
[2:12:55] but I don't say it because of that I say
[2:12:57] God because it burns on my heart I don't
[2:13:00] want nobody to miss it Lord father not
[2:13:04] just someone who would be here but North
[2:13:05] God I wouldn't want anyone not even if
[2:13:09] someone Lord that would think the lowest
[2:13:10] of me I won't want nobody to miss it I
[2:13:14] wanted to make it more our pray Lord God
[2:13:18] that this morning Lord Jesus may that
[2:13:24] word Lord as it's been spoken may it go
[2:13:26] forth moving upon their hearts Lord and
[2:13:31] if there's a desire to say I want to go
[2:13:33] on with the Lord may they look Lord see
[2:13:36] where they're at and may they yield to
[2:13:38] you Lord if there's lord habits if
[2:13:41] there's things in the life Lord God the
[2:13:45] Lord it seems like it's things and just
[2:13:47] reoccurring and reoccurring and
[2:13:48] reoccurring Lord I'm not talking about a
[2:13:52] trap I'm talking about sin that's just
[2:13:54] lay there
[2:13:57] god I pray this morning may they
[2:14:00] recognize that there is a fountain
[2:14:03] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[2:14:07] veins where sinners plunged beneath this
[2:14:12] blood lose all their guilty stains met
[2:14:17] there is a liberating power Lord God
[2:14:23] your life can move right down Lord in
[2:14:27] through that life Lord and set them free
[2:14:33] Liberty to the uttermost granite Lord
[2:14:37] this morning Lord
[2:14:44] my heart my hands are up before you lord
[2:14:47] I don't want Lord God the flow of that
[2:14:54] blood to be restricted I don't want it
[2:14:58] to be restricted in me I don't want it
[2:15:01] to be restricted in this assembly Lord
[2:15:05] because the Lord what you have delivered
[2:15:07] to us in this hour is yourself your
[2:15:15] heart Lord God to think Lord of that
[2:15:18] bride that you have been building
[2:15:21] bringing forth down through the ages
[2:15:27] that bride that as the Prophet could say
[2:15:29] that you took that rib right up next to
[2:15:34] Adams heart and that match peace the
[2:15:39] Lord would come back together the flow
[2:15:41] of that life Lord flowing through us
[2:15:45] Lord I pray God
[2:15:50] cleanse us Lord renew us Lord by the
[2:15:55] Holy Ghost let the flow of the holy
[2:16:00] spirit Lord let it just flow the Lord
[2:16:04] God moving over Lord God as that blood
[2:16:09] would move Lord into the lungs and
[2:16:12] become oxygenated Lord and bring Lord
[2:16:16] that oxygen that is from this atmosphere
[2:16:20] and bring it into the body Oh God has
[2:16:27] the Spirit of God brings the atmosphere
[2:16:29] the preaching of the word brings the
[2:16:31] atmosphere of life down Lord God that
[2:16:35] atmosphere Lord God that life to Paul
[2:16:39] seems to cleanse Lord we say flow flow
[2:16:46] through me Holy Spirit flow through me
[2:16:51] granite Lord this morning
[2:16:55] the heart of God Lord you've given us
[2:17:00] your heart how we love you Lord Jesus
[2:17:06] I pray father grant Lord each and every
[2:17:11] request Lord every desire nor any that
[2:17:14] would desire to be prayed for this
[2:17:15] morning I pray that God that you come
[2:17:18] and that you will make real to them
[2:17:22] whatever the need or request that they
[2:17:25] would have on their life
[2:17:28] granite Lord may your life be a Liberty
[2:17:33] to Paul Saints through us Lord have your
[2:17:37] way Lord Jesus in the name of the Lord
[2:17:41] Jesus Christ
