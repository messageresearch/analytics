[38:01] know I so appreciated last night and I
[38:06] want to just say uh for brother Shane
[38:08] and putting all that together and all of
[38:10] the labor that went in with the
[38:13] musicians young people coming together
[38:15] and there was a lot of time that I know
[38:17] that they spent throughout the week and
[38:20] times leading up to that as well as the
[38:23] arrangement for it I I enjoyed it amen
[38:28] uh I really enjoyed it it was something
[38:31] that I I do believe that we we will
[38:33] definitely be doing again and uh I just
[38:36] uh I so I enjoyed it in many ways I
[38:39] enjoyed it in one way that I just opened
[38:42] in prayer and that was
[38:43] it I just got to enjoy I so appreciate
[38:47] that of the the burden and I want to
[38:49] just say say that once again that
[38:51] brother Shane we really appreciated it
[38:53] really appreciated that amen
[38:58] and all of the the testimonies that were
[39:03] shared um they were all so so important
[39:08] and so impactual and I I couldn't help
[39:12] but you know there are things that
[39:16] uh I grabbed brother Randy last night he
[39:19] he grabbed me we we were standing there
[39:21] and I said um he said I'll see you
[39:23] tomorrow night I said yeah I said yep I
[39:26] said said we'll be here tomorrow night
[39:27] and and we were talking about last year
[39:29] when brother Trevor was here
[39:31] and and um brother Randy said I got so
[39:34] much tonight he said all I need is a
[39:37] pull
[39:38] pit you know it's just things that how
[39:41] God so inspires our hearts you know and
[39:44] I I want to just say I really the things
[39:46] I was praying even this morning and I
[39:48] thought about that testimony that sister
[39:51] Stephanie was given and I I looked at
[39:54] that and I thought Lord how when the
[39:57] statement she was making about remember
[40:00] her neighbor and how he was so
[40:04] obstinate hearing her streaming and not
[40:07] just the streaming of the of you know
[40:09] the services but just was
[40:12] really well not a real likable person
[40:17] but this is to me what I what I what was
[40:19] the key it it wasn't so much the outcome
[40:22] out of that I rejoiced in what I
[40:25] rejoiced was is what was caught in her
[40:28] heart is Lord take the chip off of my
[40:32] shoulder you see sometimes we're so
[40:35] interested in praying about change this
[40:37] other person and God said they're
[40:40] there to
[40:42] irritate to rub oh because you know a
[40:45] pearl can only be made when you put a
[40:47] grain of
[40:49] sand in that oyster and then that
[40:51] irritation it just keeps on covering
[40:53] that you
[40:54] know and uh I don't believe that we are
[40:57] to be we're irritants to one another
[41:00] we're brothers and sisters but I believe
[41:02] that you know God knows what he's doing
[41:04] when he brings us together you know it
[41:06] takes I said it like this I'm not the
[41:08] speaker this morning but you know what
[41:11] it takes a real commitment and a
[41:13] responsibility to have a home church
[41:16] right it does because it's like a family
[41:19] you've got to work through
[41:21] things you've got to look you've got to
[41:23] be able to look past things you've got
[41:25] to be able to work with one another
[41:27] we're living in an age right now an age
[41:30] that absolutely takes no responsibility
[41:33] for anything and wants no commitment
[41:35] least a little bit of problem see
[41:37] you we're living in that kind of a time
[41:41] but I'm thankful there's a resource for
[41:43] each of Our Lives to say Lord I don't in
[41:47] myself have the answer but you're the
[41:51] answer he's the
[41:54] answer you know some times in the midst
[41:57] of our moments when we we get frustrated
[41:59] remember frustration
[42:01] itself is not the result of seeking the
[42:05] Lord frustration is the result of us not
[42:09] seeking
[42:11] him because when you seek him you're
[42:13] you're coming to a place of committal
[42:15] even in your heart and your spirit and
[42:17] you're letting God move for your heart
[42:19] move for your life and prepare you so
[42:22] that you can see him in the answer that
[42:27] he has for your
[42:29] life God is so good so good and I I just
[42:34] I want to say I'm so grateful to have uh
[42:37] the emans here with us brother Trevor
[42:40] sister Anna May uh brother Azariah and
[42:44] of course brother Zion I don't know
[42:46] where they're at they've been on all
[42:48] sides of this platform but I appreciate
[42:51] the brother Zion and brother Azariah
[42:53] they made the trip up here on Friday
[42:55] after getting off work to be a part of
[42:59] last night and and Saturday and so I
[43:02] really appreciate that amen really
[43:05] really appreciate that and we just want
[43:07] to pull on the gift of God God knows
[43:09] what we have need of I'm this is the god
[43:13] that we know if it's just one need that
[43:16] God would call this service
[43:19] for God will do
[43:22] it God doesn't need crowds all he needs
[43:26] needs is available hearts and I believe
[43:29] we've got we've come here this morning
[43:30] because we're we're a needy people Lord
[43:34] I have needs there's may be questions I
[43:36] have there's things that I need
[43:39] unraveling that only you can go down and
[43:44] unravel I'm glad he's that kind of God
[43:46] aren't you I'm glad he's not looking at
[43:49] like we do sometimes with fishing line
[43:51] and we say cut it start fresh but God
[43:55] can go down
[43:56] and
[43:57] unravel everything in our lives and
[44:01] what's powerful he don't tell you or me
[44:03] do
[44:04] it he comes and does it as we'll just
[44:08] yield to him let's just invite him say
[44:10] Lord I invite you right here to my Pew
[44:12] come set by me matter of fact Lord right
[44:15] here in my heart help me Lord I just
[44:17] want to open my heart to receive you
[44:19] Lord not try to figure it out just let
[44:21] the word come in and let the word just
[44:25] transform let the word just take effect
[44:28] in my life Lord As we sing this song
[44:31] again as brother Trevor come and I that
[44:34] Thank You
[44:35] song um I really appreciate brother
[44:38] Trevor I've I've to me I've I've been uh
[44:42] I really enjoy his ministry I really
[44:44] enjoy the gift I enjoy all the
[44:46] uniqueness that God has and I tell you
[44:49] in this even in the past few years we've
[44:51] seen a lot of diversity within gifts
[44:53] right here in our assembly and I think
[44:55] the one one thing when you all that you
[44:57] see is when it all comes down to it if
[44:59] you can see Jesus through every gift
[45:02] that's amen and I want to say I really
[45:05] appreciate that with with brother Trevor
[45:08] and so we just want to without any
[45:09] further Ado I want him to come have his
[45:11] Liberty also tonight at 5:30 the youth

[46:54] for amen what an amazing grace you can

[47:04] that'd be all
[47:07] right
[47:10] almost now we haven't practice this in
[47:14] some
[47:15] time but we'll have the general idea of
[47:18] a song
[47:19] anyhow amen I just felt this song is um
[47:23] I've sang it a few times it's always
[47:25] been an encouragement to people and just
[47:27] thinking here kind of in the New Year
[47:29] time and and it's so
[47:32] cold you know that there is coming a
[47:35] land that we're going to where will be
[47:38] much closer to 70°
[47:41] fahit than whatever the temperature is
[47:44] this morning but not only that not just
[47:46] that it will be a wonderful time
[47:49] physically but that there will be so
[47:51] much more because it will be everything
[47:56] that is the heart of God for
[48:00] us that's the way it will
[48:02] be because God wants us to be
[48:05] comfortable it won't be Zer
[48:08] degrees because God wants the best for
[48:11] us there's so the the the love the joy
[48:15] the peace the no tears all of that is
[48:18] coming and it's coming because an its
[48:21] expression of God's heart glory to God
[48:25] that he has for each one of us and to me
[48:28] that's what I I feel that this song is
[48:30] is just saying is that we're almost home

[53:07] amen we have something to be excited
[53:10] about we have a land we're going to this
[53:13] isn't just
[53:14] toiling this isn't just trying to do
[53:18] right there's a land we're headed to
[53:20] there's a goal in
[53:22] sight we're almost home friends amen
[53:25] thank you musicians appreciate you all
[53:27] very much enjoy the spirit of the Lord
[53:30] that we
[53:31] feel together if you would we'll just
[53:34] get into the the the preaching of the
[53:36] service now we'll just stand with me
[53:44] and we'll turn on our Bibles to the Book
[53:46] of
[53:54] Genesis
[54:00] Genesis chapter 1 and verse
[54:04] one in the beginning God
[54:08] created the heavens and the
[54:10] Earth amen very simple very basic this
[54:15] is how all of it
[54:18] started I mean we got we got nothing
[54:20] else if we don't have
[54:23] this okay and so then we start to
[54:27] understand though that that there was a
[54:29] there was an
[54:31] action but there had to be a Cause right
[54:35] I don't want to get too philosophical
[54:37] here but God we you don't do anything
[54:41] you know you don't you don't pick up a
[54:43] bottle of water unless first you think I
[54:45] would like to take a drink of
[54:49] water there was a desire there first
[54:53] before the action came all right so then
[54:57] God so God has this action of creating
[55:00] the heavens and earth and creating
[55:02] everything and so we can begin to say so
[55:05] but we should be able to find in
[55:06] scripture the
[55:08] why amen so turn now to Genesis
[55:11] 2 and verse
[55:18] 18 Deuteronomy 218 the Lord God said it
[55:22] is not good that man should live should
[55:25] be alone I will make him and help meet
[55:30] for him so God decided Adam was alone
[55:33] and he didn't want Adam to be alone why
[55:35] didn't God want Adam to be
[55:38] alone how did
[55:40] God this is a tough one I know but how
[55:43] did God know and the word know can be
[55:46] very playful but how did God know that
[55:49] it wasn't good for Adam to be
[55:51] alone well brother Trevor he's God he
[55:55] kind of knows stuff but but but it's
[55:58] deeper than that right it's deeper than
[56:00] that he just intellectually knows he can
[56:02] see oh it wouldn't yeah I mean I've kind
[56:04] of played out the scenarios and Adam
[56:06] Adam will do much better if there's
[56:07] someone with him versus being alone is
[56:10] that it or is there something inside of
[56:13] God that
[56:15] knows do we begin to find the reason of
[56:19] Genesis 1:1 here in Genesis
[56:23] 2:18 let's also turn to Deuteronomy I'll
[56:26] let you be seated here in just a moment
[56:27] Deuteronomy
[56:33] 318 the
[56:34] Lord he it is that doth go before thee
[56:38] he will be with thee he will not fail
[56:41] thee neither forsake thee fear not
[56:45] neither be
[56:50] dismayed okay one more here Hebrews
[56:53] chapter 13 and verse
[56:56] 5 and it says let your conversation be
[56:59] without covetousness and be content with
[57:01] such things as ye have for he hath
[57:04] said so here we have the writer of
[57:06] Hebrews which we believe to be Paul
[57:08] quoting Deuteronomy 31 I will never
[57:10] leave thee nor forsake thee so even in a
[57:13] new testament era we still believe this
[57:16] is surprise surprise a promise that God
[57:20] has for us it's not just Old Testament
[57:23] this is New Testament it's not just any
[57:25] Testament it is because of the purpose
[57:29] of God's creation amen I want to speak
[57:32] to you on a subject a very one-word
[57:34] title of
[57:36] alone it is not good that man should
[57:39] live alone can we just go to the Lord in
[57:42] prayer father as we look to your word as
[57:45] we look
[57:46] to uh to you Lord we want to understand
[57:50] you more father we want to know your
[57:53] heart oh God and then father we want to
[57:56] after looking at that just a little bit
[57:58] father we want this mirror lord of the
[58:00] word of of who you are Lord we want to
[58:02] then compare our lives in that image
[58:05] because we're created in your image and
[58:07] father we want to be uh Lord we want
[58:10] there be to be no Distortion in the
[58:13] image as we look in you at you in the
[58:15] mirror Lord we want the edges to be
[58:17] clean and clear Lord Jesus we we want
[58:20] the picture to be a a perfect reflection
[58:23] of your life and your
[58:25] heart your desires Lord may they be our
[58:28] desires s the way you see others may we
[58:32] see others the same Lord the way you
[58:34] love may we love father we want to know
[58:37] you that we might become you oh god
[58:41] father we know that you don't leave us
[58:43] to this on our own and our own strength
[58:45] and our own devices but Lord that your
[58:47] spirit has come you've given us a new
[58:49] birth Lord that we might seek to that
[58:52] and be changed Lord by by a a a new
[58:55] birth Lord by by coming in the same way
[58:58] in the flesh that you came oh God and so
[59:01] Lord I pray that that if there's anyone
[59:03] here that has not experienced that new
[59:05] birth father may you move on their
[59:07] hearts Lord Jesus to to die to self and
[59:10] to be born again in in you father fill
[59:13] us with your spirit Lord we give this
[59:15] service to you and we ask Lord that you
[59:17] would give utterance Lord for the word
[59:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:21] amen amen you may be
[59:23] seated
[59:32] we'll set the timer as I always say not
[59:35] because I actually adhere to it but at
[59:37] least it tells me how bad I'm
[59:40] doing amen that's it's comforting to
[59:43] know that the preacher at least has
[59:45] something flashing red at him um to tell
[59:49] him lunch is being served soon but um at
[59:52] least I feel that way I don't know so
[59:55] amen so alone it is not good that man
[59:58] should live alone Genesis 1:26 God said
[1:00:01] let us make man in our image after our
[1:00:03] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:00:05] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[1:00:07] the air over the cattle over the Earth
[1:00:09] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:00:11] upon the Earth so so God creates and you
[1:00:16] know he creates a world he creates
[1:00:18] heavens and earth he he creates this
[1:00:20] this planet that we live on and then he
[1:00:22] begins to divide the land from the water
[1:00:25] and he he puts a uh he puts a a a well
[1:00:29] there's light and then at some point in
[1:00:30] time he even puts that light into the
[1:00:33] Sun and into the stars and the various
[1:00:35] places and he begins to develop all of
[1:00:38] this and then he puts fish in the in the
[1:00:40] seas and and birds in the air and he
[1:00:42] puts animals on the ground and he
[1:00:44] creates mosquitoes for some reason and
[1:00:47] you know and they were perfect at one
[1:00:49] time don't really know how that worked
[1:00:51] but we're going to find out we're almost
[1:00:52] home um and what a perfect mosquito is
[1:00:56] and how its purpose and and all of that
[1:00:59] will be very uh enlightening someday to
[1:01:02] us um if you should care to to want to
[1:01:04] know about that but um you know uh and
[1:01:08] and and so and so and so God you know
[1:01:11] and then he comes to Kangaroos and he
[1:01:13] stops
[1:01:14] creating is that
[1:01:17] true okay he comes to elephants and he
[1:01:20] stops and he says it is
[1:01:23] good
[1:01:25] wasn't enough yet was it man there was
[1:01:28] mosquitoes there was Birds there was
[1:01:29] kangaroos there was elephants and we had
[1:01:31] a a little Zoo going on in the Garden of
[1:01:34] Eden and still wasn't enough for him God
[1:01:36] was not yet satisfied why was God not
[1:01:39] yet
[1:01:40] satisfied right it could only be because
[1:01:43] the the the actual purpose of his
[1:01:47] creation had not yet been
[1:01:50] expressed the the action of Genesis 1:1
[1:01:54] that it hasn't been complete it hasn't
[1:01:57] completely yet satisfied the desire that
[1:02:00] was in the heart of God that he was
[1:02:03] Express that the action come because of
[1:02:06] something inside that he wanted there
[1:02:09] was a desire on the inside of God though
[1:02:12] God was look God was
[1:02:15] awesome God was everything he was Alpha
[1:02:19] Omega he was a toz everything that was
[1:02:21] cool everything that was wonderful
[1:02:22] everything that was you know right I and
[1:02:24] holy and awesome God was
[1:02:27] it I mean if you wanted somebody that
[1:02:29] was it God was
[1:02:34] it and yet he still
[1:02:41] creates he
[1:02:43] creates and then he gets to Kangaroos
[1:02:46] and he still creates it's not enough yet
[1:02:49] the desire hasn't been satisfied but he
[1:02:52] gets to man and he creat creates man in
[1:02:55] his own image and after he creates man
[1:02:58] he steps back and says it is
[1:03:02] good it's good and then he stops he
[1:03:05] didn't stop after kangaroos but he stops
[1:03:08] after man the you know look I can I can
[1:03:11] I I want a drink of water I I take a
[1:03:13] drink of
[1:03:15] water now I've stopped why because the
[1:03:20] desire has been
[1:03:23] satisfied so God's desire for man for
[1:03:27] for his Fellowship has now been
[1:03:30] satisfied the inside of God who knows
[1:03:34] that it's not good for Adam to live
[1:03:36] alone it's not just knowledge it's not
[1:03:39] just his for knowledge to play out
[1:03:42] scenarios and figure out well it'll go
[1:03:44] better this way because I'm Eternal and
[1:03:46] I just I know things you know but no God
[1:03:49] knew at a deeper level than just knowing
[1:03:52] things he knew it on a desire higher
[1:03:54] level that it's not good for him to be
[1:03:57] alone on this Earth because he because
[1:04:00] the very Act of me creating him is
[1:04:04] expressing that I do not want to be
[1:04:06] alone so I know that if I wanted to
[1:04:09] express someone Adam will want to
[1:04:12] express someone Adam will want to have
[1:04:15] someone there to impact and to
[1:04:21] know are we is this okay are we are we
[1:04:25] together here now now now I'm I'm not
[1:04:28] I'm I'm I'm saying things that aren't
[1:04:31] you know written out in scripture but I
[1:04:33] am saying things that are revealed
[1:04:35] plainly by scripture if you just think
[1:04:38] about it for a moment so we as we said
[1:04:41] here God said it's not good that man
[1:04:44] should be alone I will make a helpmate
[1:04:46] for him so so there's this God knows
[1:04:49] this he knows that man is going to want
[1:04:53] someone to be with and he knows this
[1:04:57] because he knows he was not content
[1:05:00] being all of it yet he still creates and
[1:05:04] didn't stop at
[1:05:08] kangaroos all right he wanted
[1:05:13] man
[1:05:14] so so God creates
[1:05:18] man and so then we can begin to
[1:05:21] recognize here and like I said this
[1:05:23] Genesis 2118 like it is it is almost the
[1:05:27] predicate like you know creation comes
[1:05:31] and if and and our first couple of
[1:05:33] chapters of of Genesis our beginning
[1:05:35] story we we we it's like okay that's
[1:05:38] that's the beginning right amen that's
[1:05:40] and this is in the beginning God did
[1:05:42] this right okay so this is the beginning
[1:05:45] but then we get to the why which is
[1:05:48] actually before the beginning yes sir
[1:05:52] right and so so that man should not live
[1:05:55] alone is a is God showing in natural
[1:05:59] type what he is Desiring in the
[1:06:02] spiritual and
[1:06:04] Supernatural realm we have the natural
[1:06:07] we have the supernatural so so Genesis
[1:06:10] 218 then becomes the predicate upon
[1:06:13] which the entire word of God is based
[1:06:17] upon is that man does God is saying in
[1:06:20] type and a natural I don't want man to
[1:06:23] live alone because I didn't want to live
[1:06:25] alone and because I didn't want to live
[1:06:28] alone I am now creating so that I can
[1:06:31] put a man there and give him dominion
[1:06:34] and make him like me in the natural so
[1:06:37] that I can show to everyone the plan
[1:06:40] that what I want from them is I want to
[1:06:43] live with them I want to bring them to
[1:06:46] my home I want them to have someone they
[1:06:49] can choose I'm even going to allow for
[1:06:53] evil because when I allow for evil I can
[1:06:56] fully Express all the love that I am
[1:07:00] because without evil and without being
[1:07:02] able to pull someone out that you know
[1:07:05] look if I was just
[1:07:08] perfect it would be easy to love
[1:07:12] me I'm sure it's fairly easy to love me
[1:07:16] anyway but but you
[1:07:22] know I mean my wife married
[1:07:25] me it must not have been that
[1:07:32] hard so God even allows for evil so that
[1:07:36] he is able to express the full the full
[1:07:40] power of his
[1:07:42] love GL the length and depth and breadth
[1:07:46] of his love is allowed to be expressed
[1:07:49] and the God and but but but so now we
[1:07:52] have to stop for a moment and we say
[1:07:54] Okay expressed because that's a word
[1:07:56] we're going to use this morning that God
[1:07:58] now is is Desiring not merely you know
[1:08:02] because he's like look I'm it I am just
[1:08:05] awesomeness yes he
[1:08:08] is and God realizes and you forgive this
[1:08:11] little bit of humor here for just a
[1:08:13] moment but because I don't really feel
[1:08:15] like God realized this exactly but we
[1:08:17] have to just try to conceptualize it in
[1:08:19] human terms but and God realizes I am so
[1:08:22] awesome but nobody
[1:08:30] knows
[1:08:33] absolutely and he realizes cuz this is
[1:08:36] exact this is where we're going so you
[1:08:38] like I said you forgive me if this feels
[1:08:40] a little irreverent I I don't mean it to
[1:08:42] be but I mean it so that we can identify
[1:08:44] ourselves with that because that will be
[1:08:46] very important and so God is like you
[1:08:48] know it's so sad here right because I'm
[1:08:50] I'm awesomeness and nobody knows
[1:08:54] and how many of us would like to be
[1:08:58] awesome half of the people okay how many
[1:09:02] never raised their hands in church okay
[1:09:05] that's what I thought okay same people
[1:09:07] all right um so so
[1:09:10] God God recognizes that that that who he
[1:09:14] is when we say he wants to express
[1:09:17] himself there has to be an object there
[1:09:21] to receive the expression
[1:09:24] is that right so so someone has to know
[1:09:28] someone has to be there to receive the
[1:09:30] expression or the expression is
[1:09:32] meaningless I I did a little uh I did a
[1:09:35] little devotional on on on the light of
[1:09:37] the world right around Christmas time
[1:09:39] and and I was we were doing a Bible
[1:09:40] study uh with brother Diego's group and
[1:09:43] and and I was as I was going along these
[1:09:45] lines of the light of the world you know
[1:09:47] that God was light and then he creates a
[1:09:49] sun you know and but if the sun like if
[1:09:52] you never actually witness the light of
[1:09:55] the Sun what good is the light is it
[1:09:58] really light if you don't
[1:10:01] see amen so that light then those those
[1:10:05] you know if we break it down into
[1:10:06] science and all that we understand that
[1:10:08] it's you know it's it's a light it's
[1:10:10] it's it's waves and you know beams and
[1:10:13] whatever it is and it's been a long time
[1:10:14] since I've been in seventh grade so you
[1:10:16] know um but you know we were it's light
[1:10:19] waves and they hit us but if those light
[1:10:21] waves never hit us
[1:10:24] right what good is it there's there's
[1:10:27] even this is the coolest thing ever like
[1:10:29] well one of the coolest things ever
[1:10:30] there's a lot of cool things but sliced
[1:10:32] bread and all that but but but but
[1:10:34] there's a there's a science project that
[1:10:36] was done that talked about like like
[1:10:39] light coming through and and and they
[1:10:42] had two holes and they set up this
[1:10:44] science experiment and they had two
[1:10:45] holes that that light would come through
[1:10:48] maybe brother Samuel has preached on
[1:10:49] this already I don't know but no okay oh
[1:10:51] say so there's two there's two holes
[1:10:53] that they would let light through and
[1:10:55] then they would track how the particles
[1:10:57] of light would go through these holes so
[1:11:00] they set up the source they set up the
[1:11:02] receiving end of what was to receive
[1:11:05] that source and they allowed two slots
[1:11:08] for light to come through and when both
[1:11:10] of those slots are open the light
[1:11:12] travels through both of them equally
[1:11:14] when they close one of them it is not it
[1:11:17] you would think well the light's just
[1:11:19] going and it's going through both of
[1:11:20] these holes and then they close one of
[1:11:23] them and so the Light Just Hits and
[1:11:24] bounces off and goes through this one
[1:11:27] that's kind of what we would think
[1:11:28] happens that's not what
[1:11:30] happens it it'll blow your mind what
[1:11:32] actually happens is when that is closed
[1:11:34] the particles go through that
[1:11:38] one you see if there's nothing there to
[1:11:42] receive
[1:11:43] it if there's nothing there to receive
[1:11:45] the expression Hallelujah then what's
[1:11:48] the point of the
[1:11:51] expression now I know it's a scien
[1:11:53] experiment that just will blow your
[1:11:55] minds and everybody's looking at me
[1:11:56] going there's no way he said that right
[1:11:59] telling you what you can look it up on
[1:12:00] Wikipedia I don't remember the name of
[1:12:02] the study but you know you look for
[1:12:04] light and I don't know we'll we'll tell
[1:12:07] you tonight I don't know it's there
[1:12:10] okay so you have to you have to begin to
[1:12:13] recognize that in order to be
[1:12:17] anything truly there has to be something
[1:12:20] to receive the
[1:12:22] expression
[1:12:24] right is that all
[1:12:26] right so how many wanted to be
[1:12:29] awesome okay a few more people have
[1:12:31] decided to be awesome okay there has to
[1:12:34] be someone that can receive that
[1:12:37] expression of your own
[1:12:41] awesomeness it is not good that men
[1:12:45] should be
[1:12:47] alone because if you are alone what are
[1:12:52] you
[1:12:55] unexpressed it was rhetorical but thank
[1:12:57] you Pastor I feel right at home now when
[1:13:01] the pastor is answering my rhetorical
[1:13:04] questions amen amen if you were sitting
[1:13:08] right there it would feel just so
[1:13:09] perfect it's exactly where my pastor
[1:13:12] sits and answers my rhetorical
[1:13:14] questions so so there has to be you you
[1:13:18] and we all we all recognize like we want
[1:13:20] to
[1:13:22] express and we want people to receive
[1:13:24] our expression but we struggle sometimes
[1:13:28] when we do Express and it's not received
[1:13:31] the way we want to be received then we
[1:13:34] react to
[1:13:38] that and sometimes the way we react to
[1:13:42] that is to shut down the expression
[1:13:46] Factory they're not receiving it I they
[1:13:50] don't get
[1:13:52] me
[1:13:54] right so I'm going
[1:13:57] to stop being me
[1:14:01] apparently how do we know who you
[1:14:04] are how do you know who you are oh now
[1:14:07] it just got all deep and
[1:14:12] stuff there's only one way you can know
[1:14:15] who you are you have to express yourself
[1:14:19] and that expression has to then impact
[1:14:21] someone else
[1:14:23] and they are able to say you're
[1:14:27] awesome you're kind of a
[1:14:32] jerk and then you wouldn't have to stay
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:37] way and sometimes as we express
[1:14:40] ourselves and then we recognize it's not
[1:14:42] really being received well there's well
[1:14:44] there's really two Poss well there's
[1:14:46] three possibilities one you have a
[1:14:48] problem two they have a problem three
[1:14:50] you both have
[1:14:52] problems
[1:14:54] it's probably
[1:14:56] three and that's and then we then then
[1:14:59] where Grace comes in because we have to
[1:15:01] recognize I need to have Grace for their
[1:15:03] problems to not like my expressions and
[1:15:05] then realize well but if I have to have
[1:15:07] Grace for their problems I really hope
[1:15:08] they have Grace for me and you know this
[1:15:10] this goes all you
[1:15:12] know abundance of Grace and love is
[1:15:14] really nice and then when we have Grace
[1:15:15] and love what are we doing well we're
[1:15:17] expressing Grace and love and then life
[1:15:19] becomes just so much
[1:15:21] easier as it comes so much more graceful
[1:15:24] and lovely that's how that works anyway
[1:15:27] we going to we're going to move on now
[1:15:29] here so that I don't take up too much of
[1:15:30] that timer time um and so so brother
[1:15:33] brandham now he I want to Pivot into
[1:15:36] what what really is it what it is what
[1:15:38] is
[1:15:40] alone or maybe even what is not
[1:15:45] alone and so we can recognize that God
[1:15:49] is is God himself has expressed and he's
[1:15:53] expressed attributes to be created so
[1:15:56] that he could dwell not
[1:15:58] alone right everybody followed that line
[1:16:01] of thinking right so it's in God it's in
[1:16:04] God's nature not to be alone so then it
[1:16:08] would follow then that everywhere God is
[1:16:11] it there's not there there's there's not
[1:16:14] there's there's more people
[1:16:18] right so then the opposite so so we
[1:16:21] could then say well but then and so if
[1:16:23] Heaven is where God Is Right not just
[1:16:26] some place above the clouds like we
[1:16:28] thought when we were five and we thought
[1:16:30] you know Grandpa was looking you know on
[1:16:31] a big white fluffy Cloud looking down
[1:16:33] over us and how cute that was and
[1:16:35] everything it's not heaven heaven is
[1:16:37] with God right Heaven is cuz we you know
[1:16:39] cuz I mean how many of you are seated in
[1:16:42] Heavenly places
[1:16:43] already all right and I'm not I am not
[1:16:46] saying that we're not that Jesus is not
[1:16:48] physically coming to take us to a
[1:16:51] somewhere different physical place but
[1:16:53] if we can be already seated with him in
[1:16:55] Heavenly places then that must mean that
[1:16:58] that a that a large attribute of Heaven
[1:17:01] is being with
[1:17:03] him because we are all because by the
[1:17:05] cross our our relationship has now been
[1:17:09] reestablished with him and we can very
[1:17:12] literally although not physically you
[1:17:15] understand that differentiation I hope
[1:17:17] that literally we can be with him even
[1:17:20] though not in our physical bodies right
[1:17:23] right amen so because of the Cross so so
[1:17:27] if being if if if being with God and
[1:17:30] there's always going to be others there
[1:17:33] then part of Heaven is that there
[1:17:36] there're always they will never be alone
[1:17:38] there will always be people so then the
[1:17:41] opposite of that then the opposite of
[1:17:43] Heaven which we know would be hell what
[1:17:46] would be the properties of hell we would
[1:17:48] find that it would be the opposite of
[1:17:50] the properties of heaven and if he
[1:17:53] Heaven has properties of you're never
[1:17:55] alone then hell would have properties
[1:17:59] of always
[1:18:03] alone always alone yes sir now brother
[1:18:07] Brandon will go into this quote here now
[1:18:09] brother Brandon in the message Souls
[1:18:10] that are in prison now and this is kind
[1:18:12] of the basis this Vision that he has as
[1:18:15] he's you know his legs have been shot
[1:18:17] and he's bleeding and he's dying on this
[1:18:19] Hospital
[1:18:20] table and and and the basis kind of of
[1:18:23] of this
[1:18:24] sermon um that he's going to preach in
[1:18:27] 1963 entitled Souls that are in prison
[1:18:29] now and if you listen to it you find
[1:18:31] that you know he's he's saying you know
[1:18:33] man is the door closed we hope it's you
[1:18:35] know we don't believe that it is but
[1:18:36] it's a very man in the altar call like
[1:18:38] man that would that must have been an
[1:18:40] altar call of altar calls I mean people
[1:18:41] are you can hear it on tape they're
[1:18:43] crying out to God and and a very heavy
[1:18:45] heavy sermon and it's kind of based on
[1:18:48] this Vision that he begins to describe
[1:18:50] and we'll read this quote together now
[1:18:53] after the vision struck me I was so weak
[1:18:55] and I had lost all that blood I thought
[1:18:57] I was sinking into an endless eternity
[1:19:01] many of you has heard me tell this
[1:19:03] before sinking into an endless eternity
[1:19:06] first I was going through like clouds
[1:19:07] and then through darkness and sinking on
[1:19:09] down down down the first thing you know
[1:19:12] I got into the regions of the lost and
[1:19:13] in there I screamed I looked and there
[1:19:15] just everything there was no Foundation
[1:19:17] to it I could never stop falling for
[1:19:20] eternity looked like I was going to fall
[1:19:22] there was no stopping nowhere and then
[1:19:25] what a difference it was from the vision
[1:19:27] I had here not long ago of being in
[1:19:31] glory with the
[1:19:35] people the contrast what is he
[1:19:38] contrasting falling and not falling no
[1:19:41] he's contrasting there's no one here and
[1:19:45] I was in glory with people and brothers
[1:19:48] are hugging me our precious brother
[1:19:50] sisters are hugging me my our precious
[1:19:52] brother there's there's people there
[1:19:54] it's
[1:19:56] wonderful but falling through hell
[1:19:58] there's no people there but in this as I
[1:20:01] was falling falling I screamed for my
[1:20:02] daddy of course just being a kid that's
[1:20:04] what I would do I scream for my daddy my
[1:20:06] daddy wasn't there I screamed for my
[1:20:07] mother somebody catch me there was no
[1:20:09] mother there I was just going and I
[1:20:13] screamed then to
[1:20:14] God there was no God there there was
[1:20:18] nothing there and after a while I heard
[1:20:21] the most mournful sound that I ever
[1:20:22] heard heard and it was the awfulest
[1:20:23] feeling there is no way even a literal
[1:20:26] burning fire would be a pleasure to the
[1:20:28] side of what this was now those Visions
[1:20:32] has never been wrong and it was just one
[1:20:34] of the most horrible
[1:20:36] feelings I ever
[1:20:39] had he was falling through all hell
[1:20:45] alone so yes the falling part must not
[1:20:48] have been good the Blackness the clouds
[1:20:50] the the even there's bees beings there
[1:20:53] that he would talk about that that would
[1:20:55] be making these mournful noises and
[1:20:57] you'd say well but okay he wasn't really
[1:20:58] alone there was hey the there's there's
[1:21:01] beings there just like you're still
[1:21:05] alone because there's no expression
[1:21:09] right right there's no one receiving
[1:21:11] your expression there's no one you can
[1:21:13] cry out to and talk to well you're alone
[1:21:18] so contrasting with Glory that there's
[1:21:20] people there you're rejoicing together
[1:21:22] you're there there's something that's
[1:21:23] been accomplished together there's some
[1:21:26] shared uh there's shared substance that
[1:21:28] you have together and it's a wonderful
[1:21:30] time and hell is the opposite of that
[1:21:33] where there's no people and you're just
[1:21:36] falling and there's no God there right
[1:21:39] and we begin to understand like I'll
[1:21:41] just just for a moment segue into this
[1:21:43] for you know brother brandham preaches
[1:21:44] and it's one of kind of the the
[1:21:46] doctrines that we would say of this
[1:21:48] message is that there is no eternal
[1:21:51] hell
[1:21:53] right and and a lot of people have
[1:21:56] issues with that you know Pentecostals
[1:21:58] and Baptists and different things they
[1:21:59] take real I mean it's just it's kind of
[1:22:00] weird that they take issue with that
[1:22:02] you'd think that'd be kind of merciful
[1:22:04] um and and so you'd think people would
[1:22:06] latch on to that I would think but but
[1:22:09] what it really comes down to is when
[1:22:10] you're a legalist and when you have a
[1:22:11] Works spaced religion that you're that
[1:22:13] you're a part of and you're trying very
[1:22:15] hard to please God um through your works
[1:22:17] and everything else and then you realize
[1:22:19] there's a group of people who aren't
[1:22:20] trying very hard on in this life um
[1:22:23] trying to please God then bless God I
[1:22:25] need them to be punished be and me
[1:22:27] rewarded because I did stuff and they
[1:22:29] didn't and it's not merely enough that I
[1:22:31] be rewarded they need to be punished as
[1:22:33] well and that must be that's I don't
[1:22:35] know any other explanation as to why
[1:22:37] Christians would would reject the idea
[1:22:40] of of no eternal hell but it even goes
[1:22:43] deeper than that when we recognize what
[1:22:45] brother Brenham is saying Hell is right
[1:22:48] here and what he'll say I believe later
[1:22:50] on in this sermon what hell is is is
[1:22:52] it's it's Eternal separation from
[1:22:55] God not and not that it itself is
[1:22:58] eternal but that but that God is and you
[1:23:02] won't be with
[1:23:07] him right so so so so it comes down to
[1:23:11] something we begin to recognize that
[1:23:13] hell isn't actually a punishment for
[1:23:16] those things that you've done wrong but
[1:23:18] hell is actually the choice that you
[1:23:20] have looked at God in the face and you
[1:23:22] said I know who you are I know what you
[1:23:24] want I I I know I know all about you but
[1:23:28] you know what I want to I do not want to
[1:23:30] be with you because brother brandham
[1:23:32] says God never sends anyone to hell you
[1:23:35] go there on your own you go over every
[1:23:37] roadblock that he puts in your
[1:23:40] way but ultimately he honors the choice
[1:23:43] that you have of do you want a
[1:23:46] relationship with him or don't you so
[1:23:49] you you and and here is here is where
[1:23:51] you make the choice we make choices in
[1:23:55] Edens Adam and Eve made a choice in the
[1:23:58] Garden of Eden we are in Satan's Eden
[1:24:01] and Eden is a place of choice you make
[1:24:03] choices of which tree to be with in an
[1:24:06] Eden and we are living in Satan's Eden
[1:24:08] and The Time Is Now for us to make the
[1:24:11] choice of which one do we want to be
[1:24:13] with and so we make you can make the
[1:24:16] choice to be with him or you can make
[1:24:18] the choice not to be with him and if you
[1:24:21] look God in the face and say I don't
[1:24:22] want to be with you I know all that you
[1:24:25] are and I but you know what I just don't
[1:24:27] want it then God says well God doesn't
[1:24:31] say
[1:24:32] fine then I'm going to send you to hell
[1:24:35] to
[1:24:37] burn that's not what God
[1:24:40] does you know the farmer you know we
[1:24:43] have the parable of the tears and the
[1:24:45] the wheat and the tears right and the
[1:24:48] chaff and you know the farmer he gets
[1:24:50] the he gets the grain
[1:24:53] and then he burns the
[1:24:54] wheat have you ever seen this Harvest
[1:24:57] process you know happen you know where
[1:24:59] they they gather all the wheat and it's
[1:25:01] like this is wonderful it's like okay
[1:25:02] well we have all this chaff and we have
[1:25:04] all these tears and you know we need to
[1:25:05] get rid of them they're kind of taking
[1:25:07] up some room so here we go here's the
[1:25:09] fire and we throw them in there
[1:25:13] and like an afterthought right like they
[1:25:17] don't there's no ceremony you know where
[1:25:19] it's like it's harvest time it's time it
[1:25:20] is now time for the for the burning of
[1:25:22] the tears and then they you know they
[1:25:24] start having a song and dance around the
[1:25:26] fire as they and rejoicing as all these
[1:25:28] things burn no it's it it doesn't
[1:25:31] matter this is the thing that matters
[1:25:35] that is not the thing that matters it's
[1:25:36] this thing we're rejoicing over
[1:25:43] thisise the a the atheists want to
[1:25:45] ascribe a whole bunch of anger to God
[1:25:47] that isn't there it is just Choice it's
[1:25:50] it's we I have set things up I do not
[1:25:53] desire to be alone I have create I have
[1:25:55] made it so that there that that you may
[1:25:57] have a choice to receive my love or not
[1:26:01] and those who accept the in the The
[1:26:04] Proposal that I have given to you to be
[1:26:07] my bride will come and be with me in the
[1:26:09] wedding chamber and those that have not
[1:26:12] I will honor their
[1:26:15] wishes if they want to be alone they can
[1:26:18] be
[1:26:21] alone and brings heaven and hell down to
[1:26:24] again Revelation or Genesis 2:18 is the
[1:26:27] predicate on which all of this is
[1:26:29] hanging in that it is not good for man
[1:26:32] to be alone which tells us that God did
[1:26:34] not want to be alone so the idea of the
[1:26:37] whole thing is do you want to be with me
[1:26:40] or
[1:26:41] not it comes down to love it comes down
[1:26:45] to relationship with
[1:26:49] him am and what that does is it re it
[1:26:53] rewrites our entire thinking and that's
[1:26:56] what this revelation of this message is
[1:26:58] doing for us when we begin to understand
[1:27:00] what he's telling us about hell here and
[1:27:02] there's no eternal hell and hell isn't
[1:27:04] just a burning place where God punishes
[1:27:06] you but it's actually just the state of
[1:27:08] being alone without God and that is the
[1:27:11] choice that you're making we begin to
[1:27:13] understand but then if I'm making the
[1:27:14] choice that I love him and I want to be
[1:27:17] with him even though I fail that's not
[1:27:20] the issue the issue is is H is has the
[1:27:23] love came into my heart and has it
[1:27:26] changed me because the power of that
[1:27:28] love is there to bring me into a new
[1:27:31] birth and to fill me with his Spirit to
[1:27:34] give me that those qualities and those
[1:27:36] properties that he wants to instill
[1:27:39] inside of me am amen so then it's it's
[1:27:43] like well am I there or not that's the
[1:27:45] issue and it has nothing to do with the
[1:27:48] daily minutia of all of the works that
[1:27:50] we try to do and all the failings that
[1:27:53] we we look at and we we we stress over
[1:27:55] and we obsess over and it's none of
[1:27:58] those
[1:27:59] things now if we love him we want to
[1:28:02] please him but that's what it comes down
[1:28:07] to like why don't I please him enough
[1:28:09] well maybe I should fall in love with
[1:28:12] him
[1:28:13] more
[1:28:15] hallelujah amen Lord so one of the chief
[1:28:20] characteristics of hell is being alone
[1:28:23] and I hope this isn't too dark here but
[1:28:24] we're we're headed somewhere here so so
[1:28:27] one of the chief characteristics of hell
[1:28:29] is alone being alone being with Christ
[1:28:32] and others in glory is one of the chief
[1:28:35] characteristics of heaven so then we
[1:28:38] begin to we begin to ask ourselves then
[1:28:41] how am I if I understand this then how
[1:28:44] am I expressing that which which one of
[1:28:48] those am I tending towards in my life
[1:28:52] life am I tending towards an expression
[1:28:55] of being alone or am I tending towards
[1:28:57] an expression of being with others and
[1:29:00] that could be an indicator of whether or
[1:29:02] not you're Desiring you know more
[1:29:04] hell-like Properties or you're Desiring
[1:29:06] more heaven-like properties to just you
[1:29:08] know say that very plainly you know so
[1:29:11] we can ask ourselves you know am I
[1:29:13] tending towards being
[1:29:20] alone because there's there's a lot of
[1:29:24] ways these
[1:29:26] days that we can be
[1:29:29] alone you knowy just a moment
[1:29:35] here got a
[1:29:38] text it's from my son I think that was
[1:29:40] before church
[1:29:42] hopefully
[1:29:45] okay no that's funny someone's streaming
[1:29:48] and it is the double slit experiment
[1:29:50] that I was talking about thank you
[1:29:52] brother Leonard anyway what else do we
[1:29:54] have here oh I'm sorry I forgot you all
[1:29:58] were
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:03] here
[1:30:05] brother that's right
[1:30:09] [Laughter]
[1:30:20] good
[1:30:26] um anyway oh what what you were
[1:30:30] saying this got really uncomfortable
[1:30:32] here we'll go back to the
[1:30:37] timer and we've all we've all talked
[1:30:40] about it we've all maybe even
[1:30:41] experienced it you know Thanksgiving at
[1:30:43] home and everybody's in the living
[1:30:48] room
[1:30:50] together
[1:30:53] on their
[1:30:55] phones watching their Netflix on their
[1:30:58] Facebook and their Tik toks and their
[1:31:00] Instagrams and their Pandoras and their
[1:31:04] Disney pluses
[1:31:07] and and and of course as we all know all
[1:31:11] of these things are evil and from the
[1:31:14] pits of
[1:31:20] hell kind of don't that that's right me
[1:31:24] too much there brother some of these are
[1:31:26] on my
[1:31:30] phone I mean yes and no and but and and
[1:31:34] I'm you know this sermon isn't saying
[1:31:37] like get all these these These are the
[1:31:39] apps that this that the minister this
[1:31:41] morning has decided that are terrible
[1:31:43] and that none of you as if you're a
[1:31:45] Believer you wouldn't have any of these
[1:31:46] apps on your phones now there are some
[1:31:48] apps that I could put up on this screen
[1:31:50] that I could say if you were believer
[1:31:52] you would not have this app on your
[1:31:53] phone those apps
[1:31:56] exist right but as a Believer who loves
[1:31:58] God you're going to have discernment on
[1:32:01] what what things could I do what what
[1:32:03] will what will is there benefits of any
[1:32:06] of these things or are they just
[1:32:08] completely no and some of them are just
[1:32:12] like like brother I'm going to have to
[1:32:15] have you explain to me how the process
[1:32:17] of discernment worked for you to tell
[1:32:19] you that that app was okay on your phone
[1:32:22] I just don't get how that's going to be
[1:32:25] profitable now there are some of
[1:32:29] those I I do I do wonder about Tik Tok
[1:32:32] but we're not going to get here and
[1:32:34] preach and preach brother Trevor's
[1:32:35] doctrines okay you know and we could
[1:32:37] have had Snapchat and we could have had
[1:32:39] all kinds of different things up here
[1:32:40] and all kinds of different apps hang on
[1:32:42] I just got a not I'm just kidding I
[1:32:43] don't have a
[1:32:48] notification and some of these are
[1:32:50] social platforms
[1:32:53] forms you see brother
[1:32:56] Trevor they're
[1:32:58] social so we're not actually being
[1:33:03] alone that's right that's right you
[1:33:05] don't brother Trevor you're not
[1:33:07] recognizing the friends that I
[1:33:10] have in my
[1:33:15] phone come
[1:33:19] through I have friends on
[1:33:22] in
[1:33:24] through
[1:33:29] there how you
[1:33:31] know and so I'm not I'm not alone and
[1:33:34] and and I will say like I I thank God
[1:33:36] that there are especially for our young
[1:33:38] people I thank God that there are ways
[1:33:40] in which that you can use technology you
[1:33:43] know to to to be able to connect in some
[1:33:47] ways with other youth but it the but it
[1:33:51] would be a sad sad sad use of Technology
[1:33:56] if you were to sit in your bedroom
[1:33:58] connecting with other message youth that
[1:34:00] are in your phone but their message
[1:34:03] Youth and if you never came out of your
[1:34:06] room but the some total of your
[1:34:08] existence and your experience and your
[1:34:10] connectedness with those other good
[1:34:12] little message kids in your phone were
[1:34:16] never coming out of your phone and going
[1:34:18] to a camp or a banquet or a Sur or a
[1:34:22] function or a whatever I would tell you
[1:34:25] you actually you not only are you alone
[1:34:28] unfortunately you're alone and don't
[1:34:30] even know it like you're the lead DEA of
[1:34:34] alone which is a
[1:34:37] problem so I thank God that there are
[1:34:39] ways that we can use these things to
[1:34:41] benefit Our Lives because you can get to
[1:34:43] know someone better and then the next
[1:34:45] thing that your function that you're at
[1:34:47] you have some shared conversation you
[1:34:49] have some things that's wonderful but if
[1:34:52] it stayed alone if it stayed in your
[1:34:56] phone you know if you're at a if you're
[1:34:59] dating one another you know you get to
[1:35:02] that point and you've
[1:35:07] met whatever that means you know and
[1:35:09] then you say hey let's go out and you go
[1:35:11] out and then you sit across from the
[1:35:13] table from one another
[1:35:18] and and then you Converse on the phone
[1:35:21] because that's what you're used
[1:35:24] to like she's so pretty but I just don't
[1:35:26] know how to say anything to her
[1:35:29] so cuz this is what I'm used to this is
[1:35:32] how I talk to
[1:35:34] her 95% of the time this is how that
[1:35:36] that the relationship is going and so
[1:35:38] then well can I just sit there and look
[1:35:41] at her and she's pretty and I'll just
[1:35:42] keep texting her because that's what I'm
[1:35:43] used
[1:35:45] to yes that's very
[1:35:48] sad that's a problem right
[1:35:52] and so if you can begin to recognize
[1:35:54] what's happening in our age and what the
[1:35:56] devil you know like I said we're living
[1:35:58] in Satan's Eden and what the devil would
[1:36:00] like to do is he would like to push you
[1:36:03] into the state of being alone because
[1:36:05] he's preparing his children for his
[1:36:09] environment and God himself is preparing
[1:36:12] his children for his
[1:36:16] environment and so the devil would like
[1:36:19] to take all of these things to push you
[1:36:22] into that and then and even you find the
[1:36:24] fruits of that though we have social
[1:36:27] networks and people have thousands of
[1:36:30] friends in their phones and they're more
[1:36:32] connected than they ever have been
[1:36:35] they're also more depressed
[1:36:38] scientifically proven study after study
[1:36:41] that
[1:36:42] says it's not
[1:36:45] working
[1:36:47] right why isn't it work it's no
[1:36:50] absolutely it is working it's doing
[1:36:53] exactly what the spirit of this age has
[1:36:57] influenced these creators to to to
[1:37:01] do and so if you get if you if you don't
[1:37:05] recognize the trend that's trying to
[1:37:07] pull you into Al loneness I mean how how
[1:37:11] sad is it to sit there in your bedroom
[1:37:13] and watch Netflix for hours upon hours
[1:37:16] upon
[1:37:20] hours who are
[1:37:22] you right no one
[1:37:26] knows because you're not
[1:37:30] expressing that's good because the slits
[1:37:33] of your life are all
[1:37:35] closed there's no one there to
[1:37:42] receive who am I brother
[1:37:45] Trevor well I could tell you if I was
[1:37:50] around you
[1:37:52] you and the things that you were doing
[1:37:54] were impacting my
[1:37:56] life if there was
[1:37:58] expression from you I could tell you how
[1:38:02] awesome you were if you were a jerk or
[1:38:05] not you know there were things in your
[1:38:08] life you could clean up if there were
[1:38:10] man you're you know I like being around
[1:38:12] you you
[1:38:14] know all
[1:38:16] right kind of need that
[1:38:20] right
[1:38:22] we'll just we're here and we're talking
[1:38:24] about media and things like that so
[1:38:26] we'll just talk about video gaming and
[1:38:28] things like that and also the apps have
[1:38:30] a lot of the apps have this kind of
[1:38:32] thing you know you've got your thumbs up
[1:38:33] you've got your powerups you've got your
[1:38:36] achievement
[1:38:37] unlocked how do you
[1:38:39] feel we'll just say guys because this is
[1:38:43] definitely more of a guy thing but
[1:38:44] sisters if you're into the video games
[1:38:47] and such you can you know your Candy
[1:38:50] Crush Saga or whatever I don't know like
[1:38:52] you that's probably terrible but
[1:38:53] whatever it is like how do you feel when
[1:38:55] you get this little bling you know BL
[1:38:57] bling it's like o just sounds good and
[1:39:01] it says achievement unlocked and you're
[1:39:03] like
[1:39:05] yes I have done
[1:39:08] something I
[1:39:10] have do you
[1:39:12] know how long it takes like do you know
[1:39:15] the percentage of the population of the
[1:39:17] world that gets to the what is it is it
[1:39:19] the gold sorry z i shouldn't use you
[1:39:23] like this but you know like it's just
[1:39:25] such a it's an example you know you you
[1:39:28] you know you've done the thing that like
[1:39:30] it's so hard to do and you have done
[1:39:36] it and you feel
[1:39:39] like I have
[1:39:41] achieved I got the gold
[1:39:49] thing you know I I I was um on our
[1:39:53] Pilot's forums and there was this they
[1:39:56] were discussing um because I work for
[1:39:58] this group of pilots and they were
[1:40:00] discussing that this this one kid he he
[1:40:03] he basically beat Tetris it was
[1:40:06] something that no human has ever done
[1:40:08] they thought only AI could do it and
[1:40:10] this kid did it and when the game
[1:40:12] finally flaked out because that's how
[1:40:14] you knew it you beat it because it
[1:40:16] stopped processing because it actually
[1:40:18] wasn't coded to ever get any further
[1:40:20] than that
[1:40:21] wow and and the kid beat this thing and
[1:40:24] then it glitched out and he was just
[1:40:26] like and the kid's like in
[1:40:29] tears and he's shaking my goodness can't
[1:40:33] believe this happened it's like my mom's
[1:40:35] at the store I just I can't even tell
[1:40:37] anybody just you know and there's like
[1:40:40] 10 minutes of video of this kid just
[1:40:43] sitting there just freaking out because
[1:40:46] of what he has
[1:40:49] achieved
[1:40:53] what has he
[1:40:56] achieved absolutely
[1:41:00] nothing if the game wouldn't have
[1:41:02] glitched out and told him you achieved
[1:41:05] he wouldn't have achieved right that's
[1:41:08] why we have things like thumbs up that's
[1:41:11] why we have things like achievement
[1:41:15] unlocked or the little BL
[1:41:17] bling tells you you've done something
[1:41:19] good and it gives you this little jol
[1:41:21] and you're like
[1:41:22] woohoo I've achieved and if you didn't
[1:41:25] have that you would never know you
[1:41:27] achieved so they have to embed in these
[1:41:30] things they have to embed things to tell
[1:41:33] you you have achieved because if you if
[1:41:36] they wouldn't have you wouldn't play the
[1:41:38] game because you would realize I haven't
[1:41:41] achieved
[1:41:42] anything so they have to literally tell
[1:41:45] you you have achieved so that you can
[1:41:48] know you have achieved
[1:41:53] wow you
[1:41:55] know Ben I want to ask you
[1:41:58] something um are you a house
[1:42:04] Builder he's not a house
[1:42:06] Builder I think why don't but I I don't
[1:42:09] I don't understand why you just wouldn't
[1:42:10] identify as that
[1:42:14] though you mean you've never expressed
[1:42:18] that you're a house Builder like if we
[1:42:21] wanted to say Ben was a house Builder
[1:42:22] like at some point in time he would have
[1:42:24] to achieve the status of billly it's
[1:42:26] like he knows he's not a housebuilder
[1:42:31] right because there is nothing tangible
[1:42:34] that can say he has achieved
[1:42:37] anything he's never expressed it there
[1:42:40] is no manifestation of that expression
[1:42:44] in any way and I'm not saying that it's
[1:42:45] always tangible but you know I mean
[1:42:48] there's not like I I hope I am impacting
[1:42:50] your lives right now but I don't like it
[1:42:53] would be harder for me to find like
[1:42:55] there's no house that's built per
[1:42:57] se but I hope that the word of God is
[1:43:00] being built in your house and and that
[1:43:02] in your lives and that you're
[1:43:03] recognizing who you are and coming
[1:43:06] closer to him and and that the church
[1:43:08] body is being developed and drawn closer
[1:43:10] to him by it there is an there has to be
[1:43:13] an impact when we're expressing and if
[1:43:16] we have to be told that you have an ACH
[1:43:18] you have achieved something you you
[1:43:20] really
[1:43:22] haven't there should be evident fruit oh
[1:43:26] my now we're somewhere in the Book of
[1:43:27] John of of the things and the characters
[1:43:31] and qualities in your life and if that's
[1:43:34] not found anywhere we'd say who are you
[1:43:38] and if Ben were to say I'm a house
[1:43:41] Builder and we'd be like I'm not so sure
[1:43:45] about that cuz there's no
[1:43:49] houses right
[1:43:54] so maybe sometimes in your life you've
[1:43:57] you've asked the question who am
[1:44:00] I and I'll tell you something a lot of
[1:44:03] times what we do when we want to find
[1:44:05] out who we are is we go and we go we get
[1:44:09] alone I gotta find myself you know a lot
[1:44:14] of times we try to do that in somewhere
[1:44:15] where there's nice weather you know
[1:44:17] people go to California to find
[1:44:19] themselves a lot there's a lot of nice
[1:44:20] weather there you know let's be
[1:44:21] comfortable while we're alone trying to
[1:44:23] find ourselves and when what are you
[1:44:25] going to find when you look inward to
[1:44:28] find yourself what are you going to
[1:44:29] find let's let's like God knew he was
[1:44:32] awesome God knew he was all of it God
[1:44:34] knew he was righteous God knew he was
[1:44:36] holy did he just continually wander
[1:44:38] through the vast expanses of Eternity
[1:44:42] trying to find
[1:44:44] himself no when God wanted to find
[1:44:46] himself and you again you you forgive me
[1:44:49] for putting God in very human fleshly
[1:44:52] tangible terms but
[1:44:55] God to show that he was
[1:44:59] loving
[1:45:01] created God did not needing achievement
[1:45:04] unlocked you have created no he didn't
[1:45:07] need that he could look he could see the
[1:45:10] fruit of who he was being expressed out
[1:45:14] before him and impacting others to know
[1:45:17] I he looked and said he didn't say
[1:45:20] achievement unlocked he didn't have to
[1:45:22] he said it's good amen I look at what I
[1:45:26] have done and I know who I am and I know
[1:45:30] that I am good right are we together now
[1:45:34] are we are we here so so the act of
[1:45:36] being alone when you begin to draw
[1:45:38] yourself into places and times when
[1:45:41] you're alone now and you might say well
[1:45:43] brother Trevor you know we'll get off of
[1:45:45] this slide here and you you look look
[1:45:47] brother Trevor you know Jesus went and
[1:45:49] got off by himself a
[1:45:56] lot was he going to be
[1:46:02] alone no Jesus had periods of time where
[1:46:06] he would where he would oh and we're
[1:46:07] going to get into this tonight so help
[1:46:08] me Jesus not too right now and he had
[1:46:11] periods of time where he would detach
[1:46:13] from the people around him to get alone
[1:46:17] with the father right
[1:46:21] yeah to develop he needed he needed
[1:46:25] things from someone he needed to be
[1:46:28] enriched he needed his Spirit to to be
[1:46:33] strengthened right so Jesus didn't just
[1:46:35] go to be alone to find himself he went
[1:46:38] to fellowship with the father and that's
[1:46:41] a very different that's a very different
[1:46:43] alone thing and so so what we begin to
[1:46:47] find you know is that we begin to look
[1:46:49] at it and we we begin to see are our
[1:46:51] lives mirroring what our future eternity
[1:46:55] is going to be are we being drawn into
[1:46:58] expression of ourselves as God himself
[1:47:01] expressed himself or are we being drawn
[1:47:03] into Al loneness into you
[1:47:06] know even even getting into bitterness
[1:47:09] because you know no one gets
[1:47:12] me
[1:47:15] well what is there to
[1:47:18] get you know with Ben's like I'm a house
[1:47:20] Builder like but no one gets me no one
[1:47:24] recognizes the raw talent that I have
[1:47:29] inside it's just so aggravating that no
[1:47:32] one gets me because I try to tell them
[1:47:34] and I have all these books you know and
[1:47:36] I've looked and I man I know how to
[1:47:38] frame a house and I try to talk to other
[1:47:41] builders and they don't seem to get what
[1:47:44] I'm trying to
[1:47:47] say and no one gets me
[1:47:52] so I I'm just you know what I'm going to
[1:47:53] do I'm just going to stop talking to all
[1:47:55] those people who say they're Builders
[1:47:57] because they're obviously not like
[1:47:59] me because no one gets
[1:48:02] me as a house Builder that I literally
[1:48:05] am not even though I think I am because
[1:48:08] I read a book one
[1:48:11] time I'm just going to
[1:48:13] stop I'm just going to shut that thing
[1:48:16] down cuz nobody's
[1:48:19] worthy of
[1:48:26] me and we like we do this in various
[1:48:30] ways in our lives not house building I
[1:48:32] get that it's a metaphor you connect the
[1:48:34] dots you put your life in there you
[1:48:36] begin to look in the mirror and you
[1:48:37] begin to say hey God where have I done
[1:48:40] this where have I said these people
[1:48:42] don't get me whatever even that means I
[1:48:44] tell you what what it is we are getting
[1:48:47] you man if you've read a book about
[1:48:49] building house houses and then you're
[1:48:51] talking about it with people who have
[1:48:53] built houses and you say they don't get
[1:48:55] me no they get you they know exactly who
[1:48:58] you are you are someone who believes he
[1:49:01] is a house Builder because he has read a
[1:49:03] carpentry book they get you loud and
[1:49:06] clear
[1:49:10] man because they the fruits are known
[1:49:14] the expression is known and when you
[1:49:17] begin to say no one gets me you you go
[1:49:19] to your parents to say no no one gets me
[1:49:22] and the parents are like hey it's an
[1:49:24] emotional time here we want to be
[1:49:25] supportive we want to
[1:49:27] help we really do we love
[1:49:30] you so we don't want to you know we we
[1:49:33] we don't want to be harsh you know it's
[1:49:36] it's it can be tough though and you're
[1:49:38] like no one gets me and then we're like
[1:49:45] honey we love you and you're just like
[1:49:49] stalling for time because you're like
[1:49:50] how do I say this I don't like what is
[1:49:52] it um what is it exactly you want them
[1:49:55] to
[1:49:57] get
[1:49:59] right well no one understands how I
[1:50:03] feel yes we do we understand you feel
[1:50:07] very down right
[1:50:10] now we get it loud and clear you are
[1:50:14] absolutely expressing everything that's
[1:50:16] with inside you
[1:50:19] outwardly
[1:50:22] and that can be a problem if you're not
[1:50:24] willing to be honest with
[1:50:27] yourself maybe you need to look at what
[1:50:30] me is because we all see what me is and
[1:50:34] if you don't see what me is and the IDE
[1:50:36] the re the way you see what me is is by
[1:50:39] looking at what me is doing because the
[1:50:42] scripture says even a
[1:50:44] child is known by his
[1:50:49] doings
[1:50:51] all right so my some of us you know we
[1:50:55] can be alone in a whole room full of
[1:51:00] people and the problem is is that we
[1:51:02] think people should you know should
[1:51:04] react to me in a specific way and they
[1:51:06] don't react to me in a specific way but
[1:51:08] the people on social media react to me
[1:51:10] in a specific way that I
[1:51:12] like because I can you know put a filter
[1:51:15] on me come on
[1:51:18] brother and I can't do in real life or
[1:51:21] it's a lot
[1:51:22] harder and people react to me and they
[1:51:24] give me thumbs up and hearts
[1:51:27] and you
[1:51:30] know I L
[1:51:33] ysms I love you so much
[1:51:37] um because it's so easy to do right it's
[1:51:39] so easy to be i i l ysm it's not that
[1:51:44] easy but it's sort of easy to type that
[1:51:46] you know and just tell someone how much
[1:51:48] they're so appreciated and Valu Val for
[1:51:50] their filtered you know photo of
[1:51:54] themselves or their food picture
[1:51:57] something like that you know um we don't
[1:51:59] have to get personal though
[1:52:02] um so so but what we need to begin to
[1:52:06] recognize again is like that the reason
[1:52:07] I want to bring this out is the spirit
[1:52:09] of this age is to try to bring you into
[1:52:11] being alone and is giving you Avenues to
[1:52:14] feel rewarded for being
[1:52:17] alone that's good and not it and and it
[1:52:21] doesn't have to be that and you think
[1:52:23] well but no one else like they don't get
[1:52:26] me they don't know who I am and it's
[1:52:28] like well maybe you should develop who
[1:52:30] you are a little bit right that's that's
[1:52:33] the harsh thing that we have a hard time
[1:52:36] saying to our children you're welcome
[1:52:37] parents um um because I'll leave
[1:52:40] tomorrow um you know and and but but
[1:52:44] maybe maybe you should be honest with
[1:52:46] yourself and say well who am I like who
[1:52:48] who really am I how am I being perceived
[1:52:51] and then look in the mirror what am I
[1:52:53] doing have I built a house or not
[1:52:55] because if I haven't built a house maybe
[1:52:56] I shouldn't be I'm a house Builder yet
[1:52:58] if I haven't done anything if I haven't
[1:53:00] you know but I'm such a nice person it's
[1:53:02] like really because I've never seen you
[1:53:07] smile you know it's like the um what's
[1:53:12] the what's the uh Joe teenager you know
[1:53:15] if if uh it's a little story that I read
[1:53:18] one time about Joe teenager and it's you
[1:53:20] know he was the greatest person you know
[1:53:22] had had a heart full of
[1:53:24] gold only nobody knowed it cuz he never
[1:53:27] let on if you imagine you know his
[1:53:31] funeral and somebody eulogizing him he
[1:53:34] like oh he was such a great person like
[1:53:35] people knew people knew Joe teenager
[1:53:37] they knew that underneath his
[1:53:39] disrespectful attitude and his constant
[1:53:41] frown and all of these things that he
[1:53:42] was just he had a heart full of
[1:53:45] gold like no he
[1:53:48] didn't cuz he never expressed
[1:53:52] it why wouldn't God Express who he
[1:53:56] was God wanted to express who it is who
[1:53:59] he was God wanted God knew he was
[1:54:02] awesome and wanted to express that out
[1:54:05] that others might know and if we're
[1:54:07] children of God if we're the family of
[1:54:09] God if we're the body of Jesus Christ
[1:54:12] filled with him filled with his Spirit
[1:54:15] born again in the same way that Jesus
[1:54:17] was born the first time was the first
[1:54:20] born among many Brethren when we have a
[1:54:23] new birth we fall into the same line and
[1:54:26] into the same birth that he himself had
[1:54:29] yes sir
[1:54:31] amen oh and and so that's so powerful
[1:54:34] and so if that if that then was God
[1:54:37] expressing himself and we have quotes
[1:54:39] but we also have like five minutes so
[1:54:41] we're we'll try to get through some of
[1:54:42] those but not all of those but if God
[1:54:44] him if God is then going to express
[1:54:47] Jesus because God God knew knew he even
[1:54:50] had to express himself physically so
[1:54:53] that he might be perfectly known how who
[1:54:56] he would be in the physical so God his
[1:55:00] his very thoughts and his very heart was
[1:55:03] to express himself in his
[1:55:07] creation not just by his creation but in
[1:55:11] his creation so God expresses himself in
[1:55:15] Jesus Christ that he could now impact
[1:55:18] the lives of each and every one of us
[1:55:20] that we might know who he is not just
[1:55:23] have heard about him not just have been
[1:55:25] told about him but that he would walk
[1:55:28] down the street Among Us in human flesh
[1:55:31] that he might impact our lives and what
[1:55:34] does it look like when God impacts lives
[1:55:37] through a body of Flesh well we know
[1:55:39] what that looks
[1:55:42] like but God through his his plan
[1:55:46] through his mind was not to just come
[1:55:48] and walk on the the streets of Galilee
[1:55:51] and through Jerusalem and walked down
[1:55:53] Hallelujah Avenue but he went to a cross
[1:55:56] so that he could further Express his
[1:55:58] love that says I know you can't do it so
[1:56:01] I'll die and make a way for you to do it
[1:56:04] but he didn't stop there because that
[1:56:07] wasn't even enough just to to cleanse
[1:56:10] you from your sins but then he goes down
[1:56:12] into a grave to rise again that he might
[1:56:16] pour himself upon All Flesh Hallelujah
[1:56:20] amen because it would be a sad oh come
[1:56:23] on now it would be a sad thing if the
[1:56:26] expression physically of Jesus Christ
[1:56:29] the the the physical expression of the
[1:56:32] characters of God stopped in 30
[1:56:40] ad but God said no I don't need I want
[1:56:43] everyone from here on out every single
[1:56:47] age I want them to f physically know the
[1:56:51] expression of the character of God in
[1:56:55] human flesh so if you want to identify
[1:56:59] not as a housebuilder but as a Christian
[1:57:02] as one who has the qualities and the
[1:57:05] presence and the life of Jesus Christ in
[1:57:08] your body then it would begin to express
[1:57:11] itself from the inside of you outward
[1:57:15] Hallelujah now that doesn't just happen
[1:57:18] in the blink of an eye you've got
[1:57:20] there's a lot of thing you know there's
[1:57:21] a lot of me that's getting got out of
[1:57:23] the way so that I can express him yes
[1:57:26] sir that's it yes sir and sometimes
[1:57:29] there people like I don't get you it's
[1:57:32] like well it might be just they don't
[1:57:34] want to get you cuz there's so much of
[1:57:36] you in the
[1:57:38] way and maybe there's things about you
[1:57:40] that hey they just got to I got to work
[1:57:42] on this I got to pray about this I got
[1:57:43] to peel these things
[1:57:44] back amen if no one likes having you
[1:57:48] around wow
[1:57:53] it might be
[1:57:58] you maybe that's something we can take
[1:58:00] before God yes
[1:58:05] good because God didn't make you to live
[1:58:08] alone God made you that you might be in
[1:58:11] that that you might be a a bearer of his
[1:58:14] own characters and qualities of his his
[1:58:17] own life his own his own everything that
[1:58:20] he wants you know God wants people to
[1:58:22] get him and the only way you're going to
[1:58:25] do that is when we see him in the lives
[1:58:28] of all the Believers and so as God
[1:58:31] expressed himself through Jesus Christ
[1:58:33] he's now wanting to express himself by
[1:58:36] giving you of his New Birth by giving
[1:58:38] you of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:58:41] that he might Express himself in human
[1:58:43] flesh again today and if you want to
[1:58:46] testify that I am a Christian I am I am
[1:58:49] a believer I am born again then that
[1:58:52] must be expressed because that's what
[1:58:55] God does because to be with God is to
[1:58:59] express yourselves to others to be
[1:59:02] without God is to be alone and not
[1:59:05] express yourselves to others so think
[1:59:07] about that for just a moment how lonely
[1:59:09] hell will truly be because there you
[1:59:12] will be alone and I've got a quote where
[1:59:14] brother it's so man it's the it is the
[1:59:16] most terrible quote I just read it again
[1:59:19] in there in the in the back room I
[1:59:20] thought God how terrible is is this
[1:59:23] truly you will be conscious for whatever
[1:59:26] time you are in Hell falling alone you
[1:59:29] will like the worst part is not the
[1:59:31] falling the worst part is conscious that
[1:59:34] I am alone there is no one around that I
[1:59:38] can express myself
[1:59:40] to and you think well I'll just sit and
[1:59:43] read a book no you
[1:59:45] won't there won't be a book there there
[1:59:48] won't be a party in hell with your with
[1:59:50] your buddies you're not going to smoke a
[1:59:52] cigar with the devil in hell that's not
[1:59:54] that's not a thing that's what you know
[1:59:56] all the drinking people at work say but
[1:59:58] that's man that's not what it
[2:00:01] is and I think that is I that to me is
[2:00:04] one of the most terrifying things I do
[2:00:05] not like to be
[2:00:07] alone you
[2:00:12] know if I'm alone let me be asleep
[2:00:17] man right right but hell won't be
[2:00:21] that cuz I'll be conscious it'll be like
[2:00:24] I'm asleep but I'm conscious I can't do
[2:00:27] anything and I can't impact anyone and
[2:00:29] no one can impact me
[2:00:31] right that's
[2:00:33] right I don't want that and God saved me
[2:00:36] from
[2:00:37] that not only has he saved me from that
[2:00:40] so I don't have to experience that but
[2:00:42] what he's actually saying is is I don't
[2:00:44] want you to have that I want you to have
[2:00:46] me I want you to have relationship I
[2:00:48] want you to never be alone because I
[2:00:50] said I'd never leave you I'd never
[2:00:52] forsake
[2:00:53] you I said that in the Old Testament I
[2:00:56] had it requoted in the New
[2:00:58] Testament I do not want you to be alone
[2:01:02] I long to be with
[2:01:05] you hallelujah thank you Jesus I want to
[2:01:08] be with you too I never want to be alone
[2:01:11] oh God and and and and
[2:01:14] furthermore God it's not that I just I
[2:01:16] just you know hey can I be with you me
[2:01:18] and you will just hang out for the rest
[2:01:20] of Eternity I mean that might be
[2:01:22] nice I can't even think of your name
[2:01:24] right now though what's your name
[2:01:26] brother Brian me and Brian we're gonna
[2:01:29] hang out in heaven is that cool you want
[2:01:32] to do
[2:01:34] that you think you're going to get sick
[2:01:36] of me ever in
[2:01:39] heaven what's that not in perfect bodies
[2:01:42] good answer good answer not when all the
[2:01:45] Trevor's out of the way I won't get sick
[2:01:47] of you not when all the Brian out of the
[2:01:49] way but but so so to be but to think
[2:01:51] through that right now like though like
[2:01:53] I don't even know
[2:01:55] him oh I don't want to get on tonight
[2:01:57] too much right
[2:02:01] but so do I want to be with him all the
[2:02:04] time but I know Jesus Christ right I
[2:02:08] know his qualities because they've been
[2:02:10] expressed and I want to be like I value
[2:02:13] him amen and I want to be with him and
[2:02:15] if I want to be with him then I want
[2:02:17] others to be with him if if I want
[2:02:19] others to be with him I better I better
[2:02:21] be expressing who he is to everyone else
[2:02:23] I better let his Spirit come into me so
[2:02:26] fully and I just I am so sorry there's
[2:02:29] so many amazing quotes that I'm just not
[2:02:32] going to get to don't say things like
[2:02:34] that I've been preaching for an hour
[2:02:40] now I'm on 22 of 67 that's that's a
[2:02:46] lot God's secret mystery he had before
[2:02:48] the world began began back part of God's
[2:02:50] mind there was something he was trying
[2:02:52] was going to achieve he had a motive in
[2:02:54] doing it in order to let himself be
[2:02:58] expressed because first there wasn't
[2:03:00] even a Moon Star atam molecule anything
[2:03:02] he was God but he exactly wasn't God at
[2:03:04] that time because God is an object of
[2:03:06] worship and there wasn't nothing to
[2:03:08] worship him so in his great mind he
[2:03:11] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[2:03:13] in him was
[2:03:15] love do you have love inside of you how
[2:03:19] do we
[2:03:20] know it's got to be expressed in him was
[2:03:23] to be a father in him was to be a son in
[2:03:26] him was to be a savior in him was to be
[2:03:27] a Healer all these great attributes that
[2:03:30] we see already expressed they were in
[2:03:33] God would we know this even through
[2:03:36] prophetic Insight would we know that God
[2:03:39] was all of those things if he had not
[2:03:43] yet expressed them no we wouldn't so God
[2:03:47] has already expressed these things and
[2:03:49] because he's expressed them we can know
[2:03:51] them and through prophetic Insight we
[2:03:53] can have all of these things identified
[2:03:55] and made known to us now God had to
[2:03:57] reveal himself and his attributes into
[2:03:59] this person called Christ in order to
[2:04:01] take death upon himself as Jehovah he
[2:04:03] could not die so he had to create
[2:04:05] himself a body and no woman could
[2:04:07] produce that body so his own character
[2:04:10] amen excuse me when I think of it his
[2:04:13] character
[2:04:15] projected the lovely person of Jesus
[2:04:17] Christen truly who he was was his
[2:04:21] character your character is who you
[2:04:24] are no woman could bring it Moses jocked
[2:04:28] Rebecca all these other women none of
[2:04:30] them could produce this type of
[2:04:31] character because it was come through
[2:04:32] sex by a fallen people but God projected
[2:04:36] his own body his Dwelling Place the
[2:04:38] reason he was the son of God cuz nothing
[2:04:41] else could project it but his own Divine
[2:04:44] character projected this Tabernacle to
[2:04:47] express himself in and yet he took
[2:04:49] himself away from the great thing that
[2:04:51] he was at his birth he could have come
[2:04:53] with a full Angel salute he could have
[2:04:55] come with the Chariots and angels of
[2:04:57] heaven but he come by way of a
[2:05:00] barn that's his love bringing himself
[2:05:03] down to the lowest now you study that
[2:05:07] character a little
[2:05:08] bit and then look at
[2:05:12] yourself and I look at and and when we
[2:05:15] say that now we have the context to
[2:05:17] understand what's going on here it's not
[2:05:19] to just go and get in your room and you
[2:05:21] know be a little bit introspective and
[2:05:23] who am I really well I believe I'm
[2:05:26] loving and good kind and you know I mean
[2:05:30] I stepped on that cat the other day but
[2:05:33] you know I really I'm really I'm kind no
[2:05:36] no no when you're looking at yourself
[2:05:38] look at the
[2:05:40] expression how are you expressing it
[2:05:45] amen but that's what he was that's who
[2:05:49] he was and that's why he was to save you
[2:05:53] so if you're going to look at yourself
[2:05:55] we look at the expression of Christ and
[2:05:58] we know what he was who he was and why
[2:06:00] he was and if you want to know who I am
[2:06:03] who am I what am I why am I look at your
[2:06:07] expression and if you don't like what
[2:06:09] you
[2:06:10] see then maybe that's something you
[2:06:12] should take to
[2:06:13] prayer instead of just being well nobody
[2:06:16] gets me so I'm just going to go alone
[2:06:19] find some friends in my
[2:06:22] phone who will like me for who I am
[2:06:29] filtered he become you that you might
[2:06:31] become him he took your load of sin now
[2:06:33] he was God's word expressed
[2:06:39] glory and if your perception of what's
[2:06:42] wrote in here doesn't match what you saw
[2:06:44] in Jesus
[2:06:45] Christ you got the wrong perception
[2:06:48] right
[2:06:49] little call back to Wednesday night come
[2:06:51] follow me he says what an opportunity
[2:06:53] that could have been Peter James or John
[2:06:54] one of them see the kid had been trained
[2:06:56] and brought upright been presented to
[2:06:58] Christ to use him all the potentials
[2:07:01] that he had in him you see you may have
[2:07:04] potentials Ben you may have the
[2:07:06] potentials to be a house Builder but
[2:07:08] you're not a house Builder until those
[2:07:10] potentials are
[2:07:12] expressed probably educated Young Rich
[2:07:15] influence where he could have presented
[2:07:16] the gospel yet turned it down
[2:07:19] what a rational thing was for that young
[2:07:22] boy and some of us are looking for
[2:07:25] purpose in our
[2:07:26] lives because that helps us to find out
[2:07:29] who we are and why we are what is my
[2:07:31] purpose what am I supposed to do well it
[2:07:34] may be presented to you and you may be
[2:07:36] turning it down because it doesn't fit
[2:07:38] the fantasy that perhaps you've created
[2:07:41] you know about being a um oh I'm trying
[2:07:45] to think of the world word you know um a
[2:07:49] marine
[2:07:50] biologist who works with whales at
[2:07:55] SeaWorld and that would be a cool job
[2:07:57] you know that like 10 people in the
[2:07:58] world have and so it's really kind of
[2:08:01] Niche and really hard to get that job
[2:08:03] but maybe you have you know ever since
[2:08:06] you were a four-year-old girl and you
[2:08:08] went to SeaWorld and you thought those
[2:08:12] those whales were the most amazing
[2:08:13] things ever and you wanted to dedicate
[2:08:15] your life to studying marine biology so
[2:08:17] that you could become you know someone
[2:08:19] who works with these whales and you're
[2:08:22] like that's who I am and then when you
[2:08:25] realize like you you know it's hard to
[2:08:28] get a job that only 10 people in the
[2:08:29] world have and you weren't selected as
[2:08:32] one of those 10 people and then you feel
[2:08:33] like I have who am I I have no
[2:08:38] purpose but maybe it's because the
[2:08:40] fantasy that you had of what your
[2:08:42] purpose was wasn't actually what your
[2:08:44] purpose from God was and maybe like the
[2:08:46] Rich Young Ruler your purpose is being
[2:08:48] presented to you even maybe right now
[2:08:51] that as someone who can who can who can
[2:08:54] project the lovely characters of Jesus
[2:08:57] Christ in your own life and through your
[2:08:59] own family and into your own you know
[2:09:01] your own marriage into your own children
[2:09:03] into your own you know workplaces and
[2:09:05] all of these things and and you can
[2:09:07] begin to and you think well that won't
[2:09:09] be rewarding I won't be splashed by
[2:09:10] saltwater and I don't know what else how
[2:09:13] you know I won't have a whale that loves
[2:09:15] me I'm trying not to really like I'm
[2:09:17] just try
[2:09:19] try not to make it sound stupid it's not
[2:09:20] stupid 10 people love their jobs that's
[2:09:22] great um and and and good for them but
[2:09:26] but but but there's opportunities
[2:09:28] presented to you and perhaps like the
[2:09:31] Rich Young Ruler you're you're turning
[2:09:33] down the very purpose that God has for
[2:09:36] you because God truly knows the
[2:09:38] potentials on the inside of you and you
[2:09:41] don't recognize that when you begin to
[2:09:43] allow God to to to when you allow
[2:09:45] yourself to get some of these fantasies
[2:09:47] out of the way and some of these things
[2:09:49] that you know you think people should be
[2:09:50] getting but they're not getting but they
[2:09:52] actually are and you just don't like how
[2:09:54] they're getting it and if you got some
[2:09:56] of those out of the way and allowed the
[2:09:58] purpose that God had for your life to
[2:10:00] begin to be expressed from the inside of
[2:10:03] you in the gifts and qualities and the
[2:10:06] uniqueness that God absolutely has
[2:10:09] placed on the inside of you and you
[2:10:11] begin to allow that to be expressed and
[2:10:13] then people actually begin to get that
[2:10:15] and then you're like whoa somebody got
[2:10:18] somebody got what I what I was trying to
[2:10:20] express here and it was so rewarding and
[2:10:24] so
[2:10:26] fulfilling and it's the best thing ever
[2:10:28] and a whale jumping in front of me could
[2:10:30] have never touched that although I
[2:10:32] thought that was going to be the
[2:10:34] greatest thing now I wonder why I ever
[2:10:36] even thought that because now the God of
[2:10:40] all creation is beginning to express
[2:10:43] himself through my life and I'm humbled
[2:10:46] by the fact that that one who was it who
[2:10:50] was awesome has has dained to come and
[2:10:53] put himself on the inside of me to
[2:10:55] express to someone else that they might
[2:10:59] be able to stand out of the muck and pit
[2:11:02] of sin that they might be able to come
[2:11:04] out of their misunderstandings and all
[2:11:06] of the problems that were facing in
[2:11:08] their lives to recognize the source of
[2:11:11] all of it can come and do the same thing
[2:11:14] on the inside of them and suddenly you
[2:11:16] begin to see who you are what you are
[2:11:20] and why you are and it's the most
[2:11:22] wonderful thing this Rich Young Ruler
[2:11:25] when he turned down the opportunity
[2:11:27] because he saw himself his fantasy was
[2:11:31] I'm going to be a rich man for you Jesus
[2:11:34] and Jesus said sell everything I just
[2:11:37] want you I don't want your riches I
[2:11:39] don't need your fantasy I don't need who
[2:11:42] you think you are cuz I know what's in
[2:11:44] there cuz I placed it on the inside and
[2:11:47] you have haven't been expressing it but
[2:11:50] through me you'll be able to express
[2:11:52] riches that you don't even understand
[2:11:55] right
[2:11:56] [Applause]
[2:12:00] nowall and this is what God has for you
[2:12:03] this is what God wants for you it's to
[2:12:05] express the awesomeness that he is
[2:12:08] through your very life but not that
[2:12:10] you're just some you know robot that you
[2:12:12] know or some puppet that God like I want
[2:12:14] you to say hi to the people and you're
[2:12:17] like
[2:12:20] it's like well that's not enjoyable God
[2:12:22] cuz you're just pulling the strings and
[2:12:24] I wave my
[2:12:26] hand no God wants to use
[2:12:30] you because he created you a specific
[2:12:34] way he put gifts and callings that are
[2:12:36] you in your life he doesn't just want
[2:12:39] puppets he doesn't just want robots he
[2:12:42] wants people like him that that man you
[2:12:46] like let's understand what we mean by
[2:12:48] that he wants people like him that
[2:12:50] aren't him they're attributes of him
[2:12:53] they're expressions of him but they are
[2:12:55] uniquely their
[2:12:57] own do do we understand that difference
[2:12:59] that that you are not you like when you
[2:13:01] give your life to Christ it's still your
[2:13:03] life yes sir he's using
[2:13:07] it that's it because you've yielded to
[2:13:10] him right but he's using what you are
[2:13:13] he's not just saying don't nothing just
[2:13:16] become empty brother brandom tells us
[2:13:18] not to do that you don't go to an altar
[2:13:20] and just try to become empty no but you
[2:13:23] say God this is who I am take all of me
[2:13:26] and use me because I am someone because
[2:13:30] you are someone and you created me in
[2:13:34] your image so then I am someone sir and
[2:13:38] I still have identity but I'm yielding
[2:13:41] all that my identity is not to erase my
[2:13:44] identity but that you might use my my
[2:13:48] identity oh my
[2:13:52] God Hall sir and I love that yes
[2:13:57] sir Hallelujah okay let's let's talk for
[2:14:00] a moment about this man and and I'm
[2:14:03] sorry I'm I'm going to I'm going to quit
[2:14:04] here I'm going to quit but just for a
[2:14:06] moment I want to talk about this man
[2:14:09] this man that had that had not fed
[2:14:12] Lazarus maybe it's even the same man
[2:14:15] brother brandham tells us this Rich
[2:14:16] Young Ruler and he pulls down his Barns
[2:14:18] and he builds bigger ones him and his
[2:14:22] barns good
[2:14:25] time yes sir it's just me and my bigger
[2:14:28] barns having a good
[2:14:32] time all
[2:14:34] alone and then he dies he doesn't look
[2:14:38] at Lazarus begging out in
[2:14:40] front and he finally dies and he goes
[2:14:42] down and there he is and there he is in
[2:14:46] in the regions of the Lost
[2:14:48] and we know the story he he screams out
[2:14:52] Father Abraham send Lazarus here to just
[2:14:55] put a cool water on my tongue and he's
[2:14:57] like yeah man there's a Chasm there he's
[2:15:00] like well let me go back and tell my
[2:15:03] brethren sorry you can't do
[2:15:06] that send
[2:15:09] Lazarus to tell my brethren he's like
[2:15:11] man they got the
[2:15:14] prophets let them hear them brother
[2:15:17] Brenham says then listen Adam he wants
[2:15:20] to be an evangelist then the call that
[2:15:23] Jesus had given him to follow him and to
[2:15:26] be a soul winner as a Young Man returned
[2:15:29] to him
[2:15:33] again he remembered it that he had five
[2:15:36] brothers and back on Earth he didn't
[2:15:38] want them in that place he said send
[2:15:40] Lazarus then back to my brothers not to
[2:15:42] come this way in other words accept the
[2:15:44] call of follow me but he said they they
[2:15:47] won't do it he said yes if one raised
[2:15:49] from the dead like Lazarus and and you
[2:15:50] and goes back and tell them the the you
[2:15:53] see it shows after we die you're still
[2:15:57] conscious he remembered Abraham said Son
[2:15:59] remember in your days you still remember
[2:16:01] you don't lose your memory you remember
[2:16:04] and you will know all the purpose and
[2:16:06] all the potentials that you had in your
[2:16:08] life that you chose not to express for
[2:16:10] him that you that you decided to to to
[2:16:13] squelch and to to to to that those those
[2:16:16] desires those rutes that those purposes
[2:16:19] that God placed inside of you and gifted
[2:16:20] you with and you wanted you just wanted
[2:16:22] to impact the world and be so sobody
[2:16:25] sobody so great but yet you never did
[2:16:27] and you sat in your room and you watched
[2:16:30] Netflix and you'll
[2:16:33] know while you're there alone like you
[2:16:36] were in your room that every purpose
[2:16:38] that you had in life you should have
[2:16:40] done and that you could have done and
[2:16:42] that it would have been
[2:16:43] amazing it would have been way more than
[2:16:46] whatever the Netflix special was
[2:16:48] that's really just not that
[2:16:50] amazing can we be
[2:16:55] honest it's time to not be
[2:16:59] alone musicians why don't you
[2:17:06] come God doesn't want you to be alone
[2:17:10] Hallelujah God wants you to live a rich
[2:17:14] full wonderfully expressed life but the
[2:17:18] only way that anybody the the only way
[2:17:20] that it can be expressed is when it
[2:17:22] impacts others and that means and and so
[2:17:25] so if we I don't I don't know what all
[2:17:27] to take from this sermon maybe but what
[2:17:29] I'm I'm trying to bring out to you is to
[2:17:31] look into to your life and watch those
[2:17:34] times that you are tending towards aing
[2:17:37] to being airing towards
[2:17:39] aloneness because that's not what God is
[2:17:41] looking for there are times and I'm I'm
[2:17:43] not I'm you know I'm not being extreme
[2:17:45] here or absolute saying if you're ever
[2:17:47] in your bedroom you know on social media
[2:17:49] for an hour that you know what are you
[2:17:51] doing just sitting there in hell I mean
[2:17:53] come on like let's go go witness to
[2:17:55] somebody I'm you know I'm I'm not being
[2:17:56] that extreme I I right okay we all
[2:17:59] understand
[2:18:00] that but that to look at the progression
[2:18:03] of your life to look at what God is
[2:18:05] doing in your life to look at what PE
[2:18:08] how people are responding to the things
[2:18:11] and events and the the expressions of
[2:18:13] your life and then to and to then check
[2:18:15] them with the word and say is this
[2:18:18] is this lining up with what I what I
[2:18:20] what I believe who of who I am and what
[2:18:24] people experience of who I am are those
[2:18:26] the same things because God went to
[2:18:29] Great Lengths so that people would know
[2:18:31] who he was and he wants
[2:18:35] you he wants you to be off the couch at
[2:18:38] times he wants you to come out of the
[2:18:41] bedroom he doesn't want you to
[2:18:44] experience aloneness and if you find
[2:18:45] yourself drifting towards Al loness he
[2:18:48] he's not looking for that in your life
[2:18:49] he wants more out of your life for sure
[2:18:52] but he wants you to have more out of
[2:18:54] your life because when you drift into Al
[2:18:56] loneness and I I get that some of us are
[2:18:58] more solitary and some of us are
[2:19:00] introverted and some of us are
[2:19:01] extroverted and God wants to use your
[2:19:03] extrovertedness God may even need to
[2:19:05] tone down your extrovertedness come on
[2:19:07] somebody we can look at the mirror a
[2:19:09] little bit and and and God maybe wants
[2:19:11] to turn up your introvertedness just a
[2:19:13] little bit you know and and say hey
[2:19:15] maybe you know it would be good that you
[2:19:16] talk to people
[2:19:18] [Music]
[2:19:21] but over in glory we're going to be with
[2:19:24] others over in glory we're going to be
[2:19:27] with
[2:19:29] him so why would we
[2:19:32] wait why would we wait to to experience
[2:19:35] what glory is if we're already seated in
[2:19:37] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then
[2:19:40] aren't we there with one another aren't
[2:19:42] we there try wouldn't we want to to pull
[2:19:45] others into that
[2:19:48] and so God has great purposes for you he
[2:19:50] gave you purpose and reason and meaning
[2:19:53] there's a who there's a what and there's
[2:19:54] a why of your life and if you aren't
[2:19:57] finding that in Jesus Christ or you're
[2:19:59] sitting there going I don't even know
[2:20:01] then I would encourage you to take
[2:20:03] seriously what we've talked about this
[2:20:04] morning and and take it to prayer and
[2:20:07] begin to analyze who you are meditate
[2:20:10] upon the scriptures and meditate upon
[2:20:12] your own desires God you've I know
[2:20:14] you've created me in a certain way and
[2:20:16] what is Fant Y in me in my life and and
[2:20:19] what is actually the gifts and callings
[2:20:20] that you've put there because God if
[2:20:23] there's a gift I I want to develop it I
[2:20:25] want you to be able to have full control
[2:20:27] of it these these young men that that
[2:20:30] that have gifts and in music and and
[2:20:33] have blessed our lives and that that
[2:20:35] look that there's an impact of these
[2:20:37] young men upon this whole church and not
[2:20:40] even on this whole church there's people
[2:20:41] that couldn't go to Service uh this
[2:20:43] morning because of cold and snow and now
[2:20:46] they're impacting people watch
[2:20:48] watching but how is it that that
[2:20:50] happened it wasn't because they sat in
[2:20:53] their room and looked at their phone all
[2:20:55] day but what it was is they recognized
[2:20:57] that there was a gift in their lives and
[2:21:00] they submitted themselves to the call of
[2:21:02] God and the the the the necessities of
[2:21:05] that gift and they practiced and they
[2:21:07] developed and they learned and they they
[2:21:09] grew and God has things in your life
[2:21:12] that he's looking for you to develop and
[2:21:15] grow and to practice and
[2:21:18] [Music]
[2:21:21] you
[2:21:22] know is it brother Shawn right was it
[2:21:27] Shane God has been dealing in brother
[2:21:29] Shane's life and then he comes to the
[2:21:32] pastor and says I'd like to hold to I'd
[2:21:34] like to do a worship thing and he's
[2:21:36] devel and we don't know what I don't
[2:21:37] know what that gift is but I know it's a
[2:21:39] man who stood up and said I want to try
[2:21:42] and maybe I'll fail and maybe it'll be
[2:21:45] you know two people will want to sing
[2:21:46] and one Tes and it'll be 15 minutes and
[2:21:48] kind of embarrassing that we all came
[2:21:49] out
[2:21:52] maybe I tell you what there's a sermon
[2:21:54] in my life that I told the pastor I was
[2:21:55] like
[2:21:57] look we should listen to a tape cuz this
[2:22:00] is going to be 5 minutes and I'm going
[2:22:01] to be
[2:22:02] done and I was scared cuz I didn't feel
[2:22:06] like I
[2:22:07] had something there I didn't have there
[2:22:10] to give but God used the gift amen and
[2:22:14] there are times when you're going to do
[2:22:15] well and there's times when you're not
[2:22:17] going to do so well and there are times
[2:22:19] when God's just going to come and show
[2:22:21] you like look see what see what I just
[2:22:23] did for your you in your life that you
[2:22:26] know that wasn't you you know that was
[2:22:28] me but I've given you a glimpse of the
[2:22:32] potential of what I've put inside of
[2:22:35] you and God is is willing and wanting to
[2:22:38] give you glimpses of who you are and the
[2:22:40] potential that you have if you're
[2:22:43] willing to give those things to him but
[2:22:45] it it's it's we don't just we don't just
[2:22:47] SED through Down the River of Life in
[2:22:48] the boat friends like God is God is
[2:22:51] asking us to be intentional and to be
[2:22:53] purposeful and to examine Our Lives to
[2:22:55] be used for his good glories and
[2:22:57] pleasures
[2:22:59] and and I can tell you that being alone
[2:23:01] is not one of those
[2:23:04] things Heavenly

[2:51:22] Lord Lord help us I pray father so
[2:51:27] many wonderful things that you spoke to
[2:51:31] our hearts
[2:51:32] Lord Lord even as we
[2:51:36] leave the service here this
[2:51:39] morning I pray that God as we take it
[2:51:42] and just to reflect
[2:51:45] and to
[2:51:46] ponder Lord to take the
[2:51:50] word Lord inviting that expression Lord
[2:51:54] as it comes in and through our
[2:51:59] lives Lord we think of the
[2:52:02] very beginning title of the
[2:52:06] service that you would lead the prophet
[2:52:08] to
[2:52:09] take before he would start into the
[2:52:13] seals that night he would speak on the
[2:52:16] breach but the morning he began with
[2:52:19] God hiding
[2:52:22] himself in
[2:52:25] Simplicity
[2:52:26] and revealing
[2:52:29] himself the
[2:52:32] same so Lord not only do you
[2:52:35] reveal but now once that Revelation
[2:52:37] comes it expresses through our
[2:52:41] lives Lord how clear how
[2:52:45] clear your Prophet would say it over and
[2:52:47] over you've never asked us to do
[2:52:49] anything that you yourself have not
[2:52:53] done no wonder lord it's within our
[2:52:56] hearts to come together and
[2:53:00] worship as it says forsake not to
[2:53:02] assemble yourselves together that's
[2:53:05] Godlike Lord help us in every area Lord
[2:53:09] Of Our Lives help us like you said here
[2:53:12] this morning to us
[2:53:14] may it become less of us and more of
