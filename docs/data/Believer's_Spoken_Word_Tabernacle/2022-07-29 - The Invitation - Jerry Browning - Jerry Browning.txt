and enlightenment we pray we give you praise and glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen while you're standing i'd like to read from luke chapter 14 begin at verse 16 through 24. then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and made many sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first senator to him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray they have me excused another said i've bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused another said i've married a wife and therefore i cannot come so the servant came and shew his lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said unto a servant go quickly into the streets and lanes of the city bring in hither the poor the maimed the halt and the blind and the servant said lord has done as thou is commanded and yet there is room the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper amen you may be seated i'd like to speak on tonight is the invitation jesus has given this parable which is of truth an invitation to a great supper and this is jesus is actually speaking in this in a spiritual way of what has actually taken place and has taken place all down through time every time that there was a message that god sent to be delivered to the people it was an invitation for them to to accept it for escape for uh salvation in the days of noah god gave a message to noah it's going to rain but the people rejected that message they had excuses for why they shouldn't believe it it's there's never been waterfall from the sky before brother branham said they could shoot rockets up into the sky and say there's no moisture up there and uh you know they you know they were of great intelligence back then we many times when they betrayed noah's time being portrayed as being very primitive but brother branham said they were really advanced and said that it was an atomic explosion that caused the earth to go off its axis and caused the the flood and uh but they they had excuses why not to believe noah in the days of moses they had excuses in the days of elijah they had excuses in the days of christ they had excuses of why not to believe it didn't he didn't come the way they thought he would they had took the the the word the prophecies and they had so molded them till they didn't no longer represent the truth and and they overlooked the little things that were the great things a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the sun sure they didn't understand it but the thing is it was still there and it happened they weren't even looking for it to happen and when when jesus came on the scene he was rejected and despised and they made excuses why they didn't have to accept him well he was illegitimate isn't he just the son of joseph a carpenter you know there's who's this man who is he to tell us they always make excuses people today make excuses why they can't come why they can't come to church well it's too hot well i'm too tired well i you know i've got this or that going on they don't come they find excuses just like they have all down through the ages religious systems in the day of brother branham they found excuses why not to accept his message he's illiterate he doesn't have any schooling or training the things he's saying doesn't make any sense according to our what we have in our religion it it we don't agree with that that's a bunch of nonsense people shouting and dancing and all this stuff remember his mother-in-law called him a bunch of trash people about like that but those are the ones that god speaks to according to this parable the nobodies the trash look how far brother branham said look how far the religious systems have sunk he said the baptists allow smoking take smoke breaks lebron was speaking to this in in 1963 what about today today the holiness move they wear pants to church and pant suits and and all kinds of ungodly clothes and they're supposed to be holy they're supposed to believe in holiness they've sunk why because they rejected the message when it was sent he said those that turned down the invitation they would never taste of his supper pardon me my mouth's a little dry tonight when god sends the holy ghost and knocks it a man's heart he deliberately turns it down one time he's going to turn it down for his last time it's going to be his last opportunity people go you know there are people who go and sit in church and they listen to the gospel and they agree with the gospel and and they might say well i know it's right but they never lift a hand or a finger to help it along and they they listen to it and they say well i believe it's right but that's just sympathizing with it they come they attend church they they do you know maybe they even give tithe an offering who knows but they never move in and actually have an experience with god they're just sympathizing with it what's the reason for not moving on in and actually accepting the holy ghost well i don't want to give up that and i don't want to give up this they don't want to come under headship headship not not of a man but headship of god it would be like i i would pick up this bottle of water and you'd say yeah i know that's water there and but you'd never drink it that's the same thing i know the gospel is right but you never really partake of it you never become one with it according to the book of revelations we're supposed to eat the book we're supposed to become one with the message we're supposed to become the message written epistles read of all men when you reject the random says when they reject their day of visitation it separates them from god they you know what what is it that is so great about their life or this world that they would turn down eternal life or do they think that well you know i think i can squeeze in it's like it's like some kids in school they never put forth no effort they think well if i can just squeeze through with a c some say well you know a d is still passing if i can squeeze through but it isn't going to be that way you're not just you're not just going to make it in you you've got to be sold out totally committed receive the invitation and i'll tell you something friends according to this parable as we'll looked and break it down they couldn't say well i'll tell you what i'll go some to somebody else's supper no they were bidden to this supper there have been to this message they are been to this word they can't say well i i'll go to this other denominational church that's not where the bidding was the bidding was come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her sins [Applause] well i don't i don't think i want to go to church here or church there so i'll just start my own church i'm gonna tell you something to get the cart before the horse i've seen many churches started by lay people god ain't in it that's not the way he does it that that's that's like having a chicken with no head as the brother said last thursday some kind of excuse but you know what this message it's been proven to be right it's been vindicated you know in the old testament if somebody was a slave every 50 years they had a year of jubilee and they would sound a trumpet and when they heard the trumpet they had been a slaver and servants who they they could be free but if they rejected the message then a hole was born in their ear to represent that no matter how many more times they might hear that they could not go free and that's the way it is in every age and the way it is in this age they reject the message then it doesn't matter no matter how many more times they hear it i know that god gives people like me like many of you he gives his opportunity after opportunity after opportunity but sooner or later the opportunities are going to run out you hear service after service you know what it is it you're being bitten to come to this supper we're going to a great suffer we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and every service you come what you're hearing is an invitation to come to that supper to come and be part of it be part of the rapture you refuse it says when when you refuse the seal of god you accept the mark of the beast and he said a lot of people are looking for the mark of the beast to come he said but it's already here the moment the holy ghost started falling the mark of the beast did too brother branham talked about his his uh hope's uh stepfather and the stepfather said to him said he didn't believe in that that stuff of the holy ghost and all that and he he said some awful things about it brother brown said he died immediately one day jesus is going to come and when he does all those that's rejected the invitation they're going to be left behind those that have received it been born again baptized in the holy spirit they're going to receive a body change they're going to be caught up and i'm going to tell you something friends they're going to be loved ones left behind there's going to be friends and associates left behind because they rejected to take the invitation i said just coming to church ain't enough you've got to become one with christ that's what the invitation is for today is the day of salvation god has never sent a message in any age what he didn't come down and vindicated but you know what happened in the days of noah god bid noah to come into the ark and god shut the door and then there was what was it seven days nothing happened he preached to the eternally lost now there was the invitation was over the door had been shut brother branham talked about that there would come a time when the door would be shut and the gospel preached and he said part of the god of the third pool was preaching to the souls that could no longer receive the invitation because they rejected it they rejected their day of visitation turn me to second thessalonians chapter two verse begin at verse three let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come of falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition we see people leaving the message we see not just people we see preachers preachers that people thought a lot of thought if anybody's got it they got it if anybody believes that they believe it churches entire assemblies leaving the message and i've been saying this will no longer be called a message church it's that falling away that's happening before the son of perdition is to be revealed it lets you know where we're at on god's timeline this is this is the time when people are turning their backs and falling away kids that have group people who have grew up as children in the message turning their backs and walking away go out and join some denomination why so they can cut their hair wear their makeup wear their pants and and their shorts and all these other things make statements like well you know if if there wouldn't be no message if there wasn't a william branham no kidding that's why god sent him and god god didn't send some intellectual he didn't send somebody with the lld or dd behind his name he didn't in the days of jesus christ either he sent a humble person he sent an uneducated person he sent a person look friends moses was educated but brother branham said god sent him out in the desert to beat the education out of him he had to forget everything he learned paul was an educated man but god told him and paul spoke of it he had to forget all that he learned god in this day sent a humble hillbilly as i said on sunday this message was not delivered with enticing words of men's wisdom but power and demonstration paul said that day will not come except they're coming falling away first before the man of sin be revealed he that seth in the temple of god holding himself all that's above god he has god forgiving sins on the earth and so forth but it can't happen until the falling away until the church begin to get away from the spiritual feast draw itself back and organize itself and then the revelation didn't stay with the church you know what it is you see you see these people who fall away from the message they were never born again i don't care if they were preachers i don't care how well knowing they were i don't care how many conventions they held or how many camp meetings they had they were never born again because if they'd had been born again they would have been in christ and they'd never never if you're born again you could never turn your back on the message you know what they are they're false teachers false anointed ones and you know what they bring brother branham said they bring false births among the people how in the world do you think a church people can sit there and get born again if the leadership isn't born again just saying the words born again don't mean anything we've seen that back in the what the 80s it became so popular to say born again and yet they went out and and and committed adultery and everything else got on tv and cried makeup running everywhere and they're born again the bride is going to be taken away before that man of sin is revealed before the incarnation of satan in a man the bride's going to be taken away friends i'm so glad that that there was an invitation given to me hallelujah i like that song that the young brother is saying he didn't have to open my eyes he could have easily passed me by for the age i was living in was wretched poor and blind but i heard recognizing your day serpent seed in perfect faith the breach the message of grace oh hallelujah they weren't just tapes they weren't just sermons that had been recorded of a man who was dead but it was life speaking word and he didn't die when brother branham died god sent a five-fold ministry and we still have the five-fold ministry we've got people who say well all of a sudden you know uh they're gonna get real religious they've known about the message been in and out of church but now all of a sudden they believe that joseph branham is a prophet so now they're going to gather together and they're going to sign on and hear the message played over in jeffersonville look friends i'm not against brother joseph or the message being played but i'm going to tell you something people saying they're going to form their own churches and going to whatever stream or satellite in that that's of satan they're blind and then and when the blind lead the blind they'll both fall in the ditch the bride leaves you think about it they're they're waiting around there's people waiting around friends look brother man i'm talking about the light in every age he talked about uh luther you know coming out of the catholic church martin luther and that was the light for the day but then the people after he left the people organized and they became a religion that is so similar to the catholic religion that you really can't even tell the difference and then then you had all the baptists and the presbyterians and all these other religions and brother branham said you know what they're not churches he said they're lodges and that's the excuse he says they give well i'm a baptist we don't believe in such things as that i'm pentecostal we don't believe in such things as serpent seed that's their excuse they they don't give excuse like necessarily like well i bought a cow and i gotta go see if if she'll work or give milk or whatever those are just examples i don't know about the man who got married and couldn't come i don't know what the problem was there maybe she told him he couldn't but they don't they don't give excuses necessarily like that but what they give is excuses of we've learned better than that i went to a wedding one time of a of a friend and heard the preacher that was performing the ceremony he got up and he read about as christ is the head of the church with the husband of the head of the wife and all that and then he took about 15 20 minutes to explain that that no longer applied that that was paul only said that because back then women weren't educated but today they are and he took that time to explain all that away friends look i don't believe the wives are your servants i believe you need to get in there and help out too i did we were having when we had children i got in and helped too it wasn't all thrown off on her they weren't her kids they were our kids i wasn't one of those men said well i go out and work and that's all i gotta do well i don't know where that came from turn me to second thessalonians chapter 2. ii thessalonians chapter 2 let's begin reading verses verses 10 through 12. and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they believe a lie that all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness they believe they're right you know what brother branham said he said they wanted they wanted something they wanted a delusion so god sent them one he sent he allowed me just like friends in the day when ahab and jehoshaphat were there and deciding whether they were going to go down to raymond gilead and the bible says that god said how can we get ahab to go down to rameth gilead that he might be killed and said a lion's spirit came up out of hell and said i'll go down and be a lie in their prophet's mouths and god sent that evil spirit down there to persuade ahab and god has allowed evil spirits to go into preachers to persuade the people bring a strong delusion to them about how well this didn't happen the thing with the bridge and the people that never took place the thing with the the halo brother man it being caught up in the cloud that never happened and the people are believing this and not only they believe it but they got to get on the internet and say all kinds of evil things about the message and you say well why are they getting on there doing that so that people can read it that are not part of the message but are sitting in message churches they can read it so they'll leave and paul said they went out from us because they were not part of us that's why god's allowed a strong delusion and they believe the right brother abraham said try to tell a woman that speaks in tongues you know believes that that's initial evidence the holy ghost try to tell her she don't got the holy ghost they believed a strong delusion said they're so blind rejected the truth the truth was set before them they walked away from it left it and now they've been given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned with it that's exactly what it is the antichrist takes all and the bible said he would deceive all a double l all upon the face of the earth whose names were not written under those seals from the foundation of the world i'm glad my name was wrote there i'm glad that when those chills was open god opened the revelation to me it called my name [Applause] it woke something in me friends look my parents came into the message when i was a little boy so for the majority of my youth i was raised around the message in message churches but i still needed a born to get experience it didn't matter what it doesn't matter what your mom and daddy had and i'm going to tell you something you're not going to get in because your mama loves you well i'll be all right my mama loves me and all and brother branham said all that you ever loved and never loved you is going to be there brother branham saw his horse and he saw his dog and then the spirit spoke to him and said all that you ever and he was surprised to see his horse and dog there he says all you ever loved and loved you is gonna be there and people turn that around to mean you can live like the devil but if your mama loves you you're gonna be there they take quotes like from uh the mother's day message where brother adam says your family will be with you gathered there but then brother brahms asked a question and questions and answers says uh will will my family be there he says if they come and receive this and born again yeah they will be they read the bible the same as any other man brother branham says this in the message of indictment but they turned down the spirit of god till the bible said they're given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it they actually believe they're right and the bible says they would believe it and be damned by the same lie that they believed to be the truth therefore i indict you by the word of god you are teaching the people in error and crucifying the principal christ of holiness and life above that the person might walk out in the street and be a different person we all know the parable of the foolish virgins the wise virgins and the foolish virgins brother madam said you all right you remember brother byron said watch when russia goes for the oil well we've seen that happen but brotherhood also said watch when the foolish virgins go for the oil speaking spiritually when they go to saying well you know what maybe we do need that holy ghost maybe we do need that experience and the bible says they'll come and say well give us some of your oil he said no not so but you got to go and get it to those who sell it brother branham says it this way he says if you want some go pray up there's a true bride the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every church age every time a message was sent forth the people believed and accepted it in all the light that it was and then they were sealed away until the day of redemption sleeping virgins are waking up brother venom says watch them that's left behind here on the earth what they'll have to go through with they'll be weeping and wailing and national teeth for the dragon rome spurted water out of his mouth to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that was left upon the earth after the bride was selected and took out and the dragon made war with the remnant they didn't want to come in and was hunted down the real church and the real church would go through that if it was possible you see but they're done under the blood by the grace of christ and it will not go through it have no tribulation period the next thing for the church is the rapture but there's going to be those that didn't receive it they were virgins in other words they lived a good life they were pure they were modest they were holy according to man's standards but failed to go all the way in and the great dragon will make war on them the prophet said they'll have to seal their testimony in their own blood because they didn't come under the blood to come under the blood friends it's not just to say i accept jesus as my savior but it's to believe the message that god sent it wasn't enough in the days of moses for him to say i believe what moses said no they had to come under the message of the hour which was put the blood on the doorpost the days of jesus brother branham says israel wouldn't believe it was said on sunday what good could come out of nazareth an evil place they didn't want to believe it but you know what the common people the bible says hurt him gladly brother brahms speaks about a time you're familiar with when he got an invitation to go down to mexico and hold meetings and he said there was a general valdena that had been up in the united states been in one of his meetings and humbly came down to the altar and accepted jesus christ and accepted the message of the hour and he went back to mexico and he kept pulling on brother branham wanting him to come and hold hold meetings in mexico finally brother branham saw a vision and and knew then he was supposed to go and so brother branham told him i'll come and so the general uh he went to the president of mexico and the president said yes let's bring him and so then uh a great bishop of the catholic church heard about it and he came and said what are you doing you can't this man's a protestant you can't bring him in here that's never been done by the government ever and the president said well we're going to do it now and he said you can't do that and he says look he says general this general vouches for this man and he says thousands will come out to the meeting and he says and the bishop said you know what kind of people it'll be that'll come out just the ignorant ones the ones that goes that's the ones that go here personal like that and the president said to him sir you've had them for 500 years why are they still ignorant so they brought brother branham in they they got a big arena and they had to lower him in by ropes to get him in there because he was still packed and he was there preaching night after night and had prayer lines people with prayer cards and there was a young lady brother branham said she was about 25 years old had her first child and it had died at nine o'clock that morning and she came that night and she was holding that dead baby and she was trying to get up to the platform and broth brother billy paul come to his brother brandon he says daddy says we've got 300 ushers down there and they can't hold this little bitty woman said she goes under the legs climbs over the top of them on while she's holding this baby and we can't keep her back said daddy we can't let her up here she doesn't have a prayer card so if we let her up here without a prayer card it'll start a ruckus among the people that's been waiting here night after night with prayer cards brother graham said i'll send brother moore down there you know he's ball-headed like me and maybe she won't know the difference and i'll send him down there and he can pray for and maybe that'll satisfy her so they were going to send brother moore down there and all of a sudden brother brown said he saw a mexican baby sitting there laughing saw a vision he said wait a minute he said let her up here billy said we can't do that daddy he said he said but i saw a vision let her up here and they let her through and she came up there and brother branham laid hands on that baby wrapped up in a blanket and said god i don't know what what i saw i don't know what's going to happen but i know that you wanted me to pray for this child and all of a sudden the blanket started kicking hallelujah and brother branham said the same thing that happened when brother wade fell dead in the service and laid hands on him said the same thing happened again and the baby came back to life and brother branham said i want he sent a brother brother espinoza said go down there to the doctor that she took that baby to and i want a sworn affidavit that that baby was dead and so they took him down there and got a statement from the doctor the baby had died been pronounced dead nine o'clock that morning from pneumonia and here it was some 12 hours later the baby had come back to life a baby that was dead 12 hours comes back to life because the little mama had faith if i can just get to the prophet if i can just get there she they didn't even speak the same language but she believed that she could get up their baby and come back to life and god honored her faith she was just a common person she wasn't some rich person she was a poor person hallelujah brother brown said they interviewed him because they couldn't keep this quiet after that baby had been brought back to life they interviewed him being a catholic nation they said do you think one of our saints could do this brother man says if they're alive brother brandon was interviewed by a news reporter a woman and she come and said i want to ask you questions about your religion and she told him she said if i had to associate with that bunch of ignoramuses up there i wouldn't even want to be a christian they say them people's going to rule the earth someday she said i hope i'm not here the other man said don't worry you won't be she was a catholic and said brother man i said wait a minute says you claimed to be a cavity said did you know the blessed virgin mary had to receive the holy ghost and speak in tongues and dance in the spirit the same way the rest of them did before god would receive her and you call her the mother of god she said that's nonsense he said wait a minute it says in the bible she said we're not supposed to look in the bible he said how are you going to know what's truth or not then say i take my church's word he said this is god's word right here and i challenge you to look at it and mary was with them in the upper room and received the baptism of the holy ghost like the rest of them did and you call her the mother of god then call that bunch of a bunch of trash and backwash don't worry you won't be there you don't have much to worry about that go out quickly in the streets and lanes of the city bringing hither the poor bring in the nobodies i'm glad to be a nobody tonight i might be a nobody my name might not be a great big name but i'm going to tell you something i'm part of the bride of jesus christ and that's a great big name [Applause] i might not be an important person i might not be real smart but i've received the invitation that was given i'm not rich as the song says in this world but i've got a father who owns cattle on a thousand hills when it comes spiritually i'm a millionaire hallelujah i'm a poor rich man hallelujah hallelujah nobody bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in i believe that's happening i believe it is still happening the rejects the outcasts the outcasts of society the outcasts of some families but god's bidding them come and drink of the waters of life freely hallelujah you know when they reject the message there's nothing left but judgment and judgment's coming judgment day is coming and you know what you would think that on on let me just draw you a picture if i can in a moment the great white throne judgment this is all the raptures took place the tribulation periods took place the the millennium has took place and at the end of the millennium comes the great white throne judgment and then the bible says that all the dead will come back to life the sea will give forth its dead the earth will give forth its dead and they all stand before the judgment seat of christ how could they stand there and offer an excuse for why they didn't receive the invitation in their day but the bible says they will he says they'll come up there and they'll say didn't we cast out devils in thy name you know didn't we go to church didn't we give our tithe didn't we give offerings and they're offering an excuse brother branham says the sky is going to be a great big screen and their life's going to be played before them the times that they set in the services heard the word and walked away from it the ones brother said that rejected the message we asked to give a reason what then they heard and they'll be asked to give a reason but then going to stand there just as certain as this book is written they're going to stand there and be asked for a reason the ones that rejected the message will be asked to give a reason someday the trumpet will sound for its last time the bible will lay closed on the pulpit and then they'll be asked to give a reason for what they've done with these treasures that's been sent to us spy our heads i know a lot of you here but there's some i i don't know i i i don't i'm not around i don't know where your life is or where your stand is what you do tonight and god does i want you to know the invitation that's been given the offer is open praise the lord young people i i don't know where you are with god but i know there comes an age of accountability when you've got an answer for yourself you might still be living at home you still might be under mom and dad but you reach an age where you've got to make the decision for yourself amen let's pray heavenly father lord the invitation has been given out over the ages down through every age down through every day lord
