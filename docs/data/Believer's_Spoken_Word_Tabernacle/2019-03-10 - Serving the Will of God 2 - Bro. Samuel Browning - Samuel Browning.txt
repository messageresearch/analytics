been going through a lot this is about nine months already she was going through so much pain in her body no doctors they couldn't figure it out no matter what test they did to her and so they even started thinking it was probably in her head and I said Lord and I put it before you all and you all put it before the Lord I says Lord you've got to direct me you got to help me Lord we don't know they're saying Lord she's going through pain and it was two in the morning and I remember the Lord just guided me I was looking at the iPad he was guiding me all of a sudden I read about the same kind of patient was going through the same thing with what the issue was and when I had seen that I jumped out of bed I told my daughter she had a mesh I said Amanda it's a mesh that's what's causing the problems well sure enough the Lord directed me exactly because then we were able to go to the doctor then go to and then be guided to what doctor to go to because we didn't know who to go to God just kind of led us to what doctor to go to after we were led to the doctor he led us to what the issue was the and and I'm giving this testimony because I just wanted sometimes you Amanda is still recovering she thanks you continue to keep her in prayer she's coming along really well but I tell you it's just God works miracles when we think that he's not listening and he led us to the doctor a doctor even the surgery was supposed to be four hours and brother Samuel Sister Kim were there and and and we were just talking thinking oh my God this is going to be a long day I think it had to be half hour that doctor came out and we were like he says it's done he goes he goes let me talk to you about it it's done he says actually he goes when I went in there because they were talking about being being complicated and it was going to be in the nerves and it was a mess and it could have been a mess for her could have been worse God had that theme floating on top God had the nerves right on top where they were able to get those nerves immediately Amanda was completely done in a half hour and it's like man we were just like shocked but To God Be The Glory thank you Lord Jesus thank you man I want to thank the visitors God bless you Brothers I thank God also zaki's home too right right well grandson's home [Music] Stan we're going to sing an Amazing Grace [Music] [Applause] hey

it's it's not hard to testify to that when we're on the mountain but you know when you've been on the mountain you've been in the valley there's always then the mountain then there'll be the valley then there's the mountain there's the valley but in the midst of it where you can stand and testify God is good all the time he's faithful he's faithful you know to think of it one time in the scriptures where that the enemy would vaunt himself lift himself up against that of Israel and said he's God of the mountains but he's not God of the valley God heard that God heard that when God heard that God said I will show that I am God of the valley and I'm grateful for that this morning we find that in our lives you see it throughout even the the book of Acts we go through trials we go through tests and you know that fruit itself is never it's never made or born on the Mountaintop The Mountaintop is only the expression that you've come through the valley but I'm grateful like David said yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil amen for in that same scripture in Psalms 23 is the same scripture where it speaks of how that the Lord leads us he leads us into those places even to the Mountaintop he's led us to the mountain we graze we feed we take in and then here we come right back down into the valley but you see in the valley it shows what you've been eating up on the good table lands you find as we said all through the times of the book of Acts and different times you you watch the word of how that it'll say the church was being tested and then it'll say and then the church has had rest there's always it goes in Cycles you know there's times where we want to abide under the nice palm trees Lord just another day just another moment Lord the Lord said no you got to keep moving it'll keep moving he knows what he's doing don't he amen amen the Lord is so good he's so faithful he's so faithful amen just like to say we like to welcome each and every one of you the visitors we have here with us amen God bless you brother Amos I recognize you amen God bless you brother Amos Burgess good to have him here with us amen blessed be the name of the Lord and good to have some of the those arrests of you that are here good to have all the regular folks some are out I know but good to be good to be in the house of the Lord amen uh real two things here is we're preparing to lift at the the email I sent out I trust that everyone um got that that we moved changed it from a missionary offering uh with a need that was presented here we changed it to that of a of a love offering this morning so we want to go ahead and do that and I want to say um May God richly bless you the we've on the missionary offerings and the things that's been raised that has been lifted even for the needs that were needed there in the Philippines the Lord provided even what was above and what was needed there for that so may God bless you for your your giving in that and we've already been in the process those things to uh you know get that moving for the brothers and things like that so um and Lord willing if I go even we're supposed to go to that area the Lord willing here in in the fall we'll make sure we also get pictures of that as well for you so you you all told me he was going to pray about that now that's an awful long flight as soon as I made the statement about having you all pray for it I got a text the next morning I don't even know if it waited till next morning I got a text from my brother hey wait a minute here what in the world you told me I said hey I said we're praying about it you know but uh so we just uh and it's a truth that's a long flight I don't mean to sound you know it just it's a long flight and and you know what you might say brother Sammy you sound weak well I don't profess to be a missionary I really mean that I I'm not you know I can't do the things like brother Monaco riding in on Horseback in the South America I thank God God gives somebody a burden for that God gives them the burden and the will and the strength and everything to be able to do that and that's why we're not all the same way right we're all different right some of you like your steak a certain way I like mine a certain way we're different but you know within that God takes those things and he uses it for his glory right I mean can you imagine if we're all we're evangelists where would the apostles be what if we were all Apostles where would the pastors be God knows exactly every one of us God has a need and to serve his purpose that's what we want so also if I could real quick after Brothers come on up so we can get the love offering taken up pray over that um also if I can just real quick in the conference area just to kind of meet with the young people just real quick after service uh just uh just a quick moment we'll do that amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus fathers we just Lord we're just so grateful Lord to be able to come Lord into your presence Lord to this building that you have given to us Lord and has been set aside for that purpose Lord we have no other reason of being here first and foremost and that's to meet with you Lord we love to be able to come together as brothers and sisters of like Precious faith it encourages the Lord with one another father as we know Lord God the labors and the sacrifice Lord and many times the tests and trials Lord and and yet within the midst of it Lord God to see as your children Lord many times offering a sacrifice of praise pressing beyond the feelings Lord in all of the discouragements and tests and trials of Life Lord we realize dear God that in ourselves Lord Jesus it's a greater a spring a greater Lord Force within us Lord that's moving us Lord and Lord we we just love you we want to say that we appreciate you for providing the Lord for every need in our lives Lord and dear God how that you

we pray speak your word it's true come speak your word speak your word into our hearts and have your way Hallelujah God bless you if we could let's turn in our Bibles we want to turn to Deuteronomy chapter 17. and we want to just by the help of the Lord just resume this morning just to continue a little bit in this thought we begin looking at last last Sunday on serving the will of God serving the will of God you know it's one thing when you think of the thoughts serving the will of God you realize it's always a choice in the beginning God made known his will and there was a choice whether they would serve his will and when you look at even when Abel and Cain they came to the time to worship and God moved down and God Vindicated able sacrifice with his presence and God showing that he had rejected Cain's sacrifice his presence did not come to confirm it and then to think how that God just simply made known to Cain at that time and he said why are you cast down why is your countenance so Roth he asked him that question and you know Cain Cain knew what the perfect will of God was when he saw the presence of God come down and vindicate Abel's sacrifice I want you just the Simplicity of it he didn't have to understand it he just had to see it and submit to it but Cain chose not to serve the will of God and that's a very something that very dearly in our hearts that when we are looking as Believers we know that God's presence will always accompany in his word and we want to be sensitive to the presence of the Lord I want to be sensitive to that so we just want the Lord that he would just come direct our thoughts this morning and not our thoughts but that his thoughts would be the ones that would direct us this morning so we just want to move under that canopy and that protection of our Lord Jesus Christ verse 14 I'm just going to read two verses and we'll let you be seated when when thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I will set a king over me like as all the nations uh like as all the nations that are around about me Thou shalt in any way in any way set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose that's a very important point you shall set over you whom the Lord thy God shall choose now you realize that God will actually give people and allow people to have their own choice he'll allow them to have their own choice this is why we always want our choice to be his choice this is where as brother bam tells us in the message the breach he says when we are redeemed we no longer want our own choice we want we have made him our choice and we want what he wants so Thou shalt in any way set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose one from among thy Brethren shalt thou set King over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother may God bless you bless the reading of the word is being seated there's much counsel that God goes through and gives concerning this in the book of Deuteronomy in this in this portion and gives the characteristic of what is to be had there with with the King that his objectives and all of the motives what what everything is to be set for and I believe you can sum it up in this measure that the king is to hold fast with one desire and heart and that's to obey the Lord to serve him to serve his word to serve his people and so when we when we look at this in the scriptures if we move ahead in first Samuel 8 we find where the people the people of God hear the children of Israel they've come into the land and as they've come into the land we find just as God himself made known to them when you come into the land and you begin to see the other nations that are around you that you would say let us set a king up over us like the other nations and the the problem with that is as we read here in just a few moments is that their purpose and their motive in doing it was that they were wanting to be like the rest of the Nations that they were beholding so I find here in first Samuel chapter 8 verse 4 all the Elders of Israel they gathered themselves together and they came to Samuel unto Rhema you you we realized that Samuel was God's gift and what I mean by God's Gift a channel that God himself would speak to the children of Israel that God himself might lead them there or continue to lead them by his word because remember the Bible tells us that before this time there was no open vision and yet the people when you would look at it it wasn't that the people themselves were not looking at the word but an open Vision it deals with a channel that is open to to be able to know God's Will and God's abiding presence to guide and direct the people in other words we just don't it's not just a people that are just going through the motions with things and just looking at things that were in their day where they were looking at the word they were looking over the law they were looking over those things but yet they were just kind of going through the motions and they they got their focus away and off of the Lord by looking at all of these other things and then when they would even begin to wonder why are we losing battles why are we not having Victory like we should be having and it always comes down to and we see that even when Israel entered the land you see with Aiken he got his eyes on the wrong thing and when any time the eye and the heart or anything gets set on the wrong thing it is just one little thing that that can enter in that can actually remove Victory from a heart and from a life and remove Victory from the camp and so we we recognize within that we we desire I believe I believe that every one of us would desire and I believe it's something we always have to stay before God and staying in his presence that Lord let every one of my desires and let everything be checked and let it be Lord God one with what your desire is if one I'm looking at is not your desire then Lord I don't want it and even if I can look at it and it looks wholesome there's nothing in the word against it but Lord you know you know what I have need of you know the timing you know all things so Lord you who have brought me from my mother's womb then Lord I'm trusting on you to guide me every step of the way as you've dealt with my heart you see it's the realizing that God has had his hand upon our life it's him that is leading us So within it it's things that as as here they came to Samuel and the Bible says in verse 5 and they said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased Samuel when they said it give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord oh my well that's a place to take it can you say amen and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee you see spirits never die Spirits never die it's just like how God would move you see it in the days of the judges here in Samuel himself not only a prophet but a judge and to see how that you know God would bring a Deliverance in Israel I think of how that Nehemiah you know under inspiration would say it he sent them saviors he sent them those who would be in contact with God and God would hear and respond to the Cry of his people and they would come in Deliverance but then you would find after a Deliverance that they themselves failed to maintain that that walk before God and they would form themselves right back into the very the very mold of what God had called them out from and so when here he goes on to say hearken unto their voice how be it yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them now you see here when we look at this the manner of the king that would Reign Over them to recognize that even based on their choice and what would be made then it's also going to reveal or be able to make known that the choice and the way that they have went about this that it makes known exactly what this king is going to be like who's going to Reign Over them you're going to know that because how can you tell that you can tell that by the desire and what is motivating within their heart so watch how that you know when we look at this we find that you know brother Brandon would identified in this manner that that Spirit of antichrist that was moving in here it's not new and and here you know now look how this moved in there the people themselves were in fear they were afraid and so because of fear why would they be in fear but you see when this little departure from the word even before then it brings fear and it's like they're trying to ensure their survival their protection and and they're fail to recognize wait a minute you didn't bring yourself out of Egypt you didn't bring yourself across to Jordan it is I the Lord that have brought thee that have brought you to where you are but you see in the midst of that time of fear then that's when the spirit of antichrist comes in now watch this he goes on to speak he says that's not that's something that came in through the church ages and he says now it goes against God and it takes over in the church uh and he begins to bring this out of the Old Testament and I'm just trying to move through this here a little bit we we just to kind of cover review a little bit here this morning he goes in and says that early church started out talking about there from the day of Pentecost the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles move the way their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation to which he was truly God now God had men listen to me God had men that he chose Vindicated by his presence and by his presence God would would we know would would direct the people but it wasn't the man himself directing the people but it was the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's the greatest that's the greatest uh reality and that is what is the most important is to have the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's more that's more important to have the presence of God through guiding and directing and moving us within the word that's more important there because it will always direct us into his word he supplied every need they had need of think about how how that God even when you look at where Moses is at and the burden would strike Moses to where he would say even in the time they're in Exodus and you find it there in numbers you find it in a Deuteronomy of how that Moses would even make and say Lord let there be a man that would stand before the people there Lord let them be one so they would have a Shepherd one that would be able to guide them but it wasn't a man but it was that one who would be in contact with God that God could speak to his people God would Minister to his people where did Moses get that desire from he got that desire from God he realized that our protection is the presence of God in Walking In obedience to his word think about it they went through a Wilderness there where people was all around them in different times they came out against them but who kept them they were not an organized Army they were not a great military come on somebody who was it that fought their battles the Lord fought their battles who wants it that kept them almighty God kept them and he was manifesting you see what God was doing let's say day one what God did day one was to build faith for day two what he does day two is to build faith for day 10 on and on it's to be there is to be an increasing and a building of Faith to where the people of God are resting more and more in his presence than their abilities no wonder David could say what time I am afraid I will trust in thee Hallelujah glory be to God we're not on that King yet but notice this but one day they got to looking around and they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them it cocked their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him yeah true God was going to do that but they got ahead of him but how because influence there was influence that came their way Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God the word do you realize is what I just referred to you about Cain brother random tells us in power transformation Satan knows the will of God he knows it but he refuses to do it he knows it but you see his objective is look for a people here he's not going to be able to pull these people away and say well the law is no good and and what you've got this word and this message of a prophet but what he has to do is he has to get them outside of the boundaries of protection where the presence of God let me tell you something friends the latter is not our protection it's the presence of God the person of Jesus Christ and let me tell you the person of Jesus Christ will never get outside the word he stays in the boundaries of his word there's a lot of things he can do Beyond his word but remember the real reality where we ourselves our confidence and where our trust and our rest is he performs his word and that's good enough for me now watch this has Satan had put that in the people's hearts trying to get them ahead so when we loan us with God's will because every one of us are faced with decisions every one of us and even though that to have a king over them was the plan of God it was the will of God but it has to be God's way in God's time that's the two key things God's will you know we don't have to fret ourselves about God's will when you're praying about something in your life you don't have to be anxious somebody help me preach now because we've got to battle that thing we got a battle yes sir but when we what it comes down to is US recognizing wait a minute if our heart is just in tune with God if God wants us to make a step here then as long listen as we are staying in step with him I I love the scripture as it says in the opening of Psalms 119 it said wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed to Thy word and it goes on to say in Psalms 119 that they who seek Him shall do no iniquity that's powerful brother let me tell you something when God is the focus of the life and you're seeking after God let me tell you something God when you come to a mountain he'll make a way through that mountain when you come to a river he'll make a way through that River be the main important thing is is stay in contact with his presence so when the unction moves you're ready to make a step when it's time to make a step lean not to your own understanding you know that's a powerful scripture and to think of it the very man who wrote that under inspiration eventually leaned to his own understanding are you with me I'm not going in that far this morning but to see where it is it's to abide we're under the presence of almighty God about now to thank you because you look the man it's not a man's word it's God's word so it the way in timing and this is why that God will always reveal his will in his season you know it's one thing you and I we can look at print you and I can look at print words quote scriptures and you can try to take that and just forcefully apply it and this is this way and this is that way but friends if you miss the leading of the Holy Spirit the presence of God to move down within that right time you have missed the very one who is the enforcer of the word God has never called you and I to be self-reliant self-willed he wants us to serve his will now watch this this way in timing this is why we need the ministry of the Holy Spirit we need that of the word for God to come down the life of ministry to be able to move down that the Holy Spirit not man I can't know how you know even if I know what's on your heart or what it is you're going through I still am reserved to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit sometimes that's the thing with the pastor you know sometimes as a pastor I can know sometimes the different needs maybe there's sometimes there's things that you've spoke to me or or other things like that but yet within it all you know and I thank God for you know the brothers and sisters that really protect me because I don't need to know all the business God himself is the one who needs to know he's the one who's been leading this church he's the one that that has to be the one to move within the situations and the different needs to settle troubled hearts to answer questions it has to be the Lord to do that but to recognize that how we need that word coming down and Discerning the very thoughts and intents of the heart we need that judgment seat of Christ so that because there's sometimes where we've been inclined in a certain way and the way that we've been inclined it seemed like this is exactly perfect this is what we need to do and yet when we find as we will just be sensitive to the Lord the Lord could say nothing in my word against it it's everything according to it's fine with my word but it's not for you to do it or it's not my will and he can go right down through that example when brother Brandon was standing there and preparing to enter into Israel was it not God's will his word that the that the gospel itself the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that has been poured out upon the Gentiles here down through the Gentile ages is it not so that God is going to visit his people wherein that the fountain in the House of David shall be opened he is indeed going to do that but he will do it in his way and in his time think of what God told the Prophet this is not your place this is not the time it's always what is God's time I believe with all my heart if we can be sensitive to God about everything whether it comes to buying a house he comes to buying a car it comes to every little aspect about our life I believe we need to see God what's your will on this it is so much maybe if it's ten dollars and you've got 30 well to praise God I've got the money to cover that may not be God's will we ought to seek for the will of God because it might be ten dollars and there'll be a day you only got five and if the God has made known that's his will it doesn't matter if it costs ten dollars and all you got is five you're able to say God has made known this is his will so if I'm in his will he is Jehovah Jireh that's the comfort that we receive in the times when pressure comes so if we find in the scripture here even we find in the opening part of the scripture Eve how that God came to eat he didn't come to Adam I mean how sorry how the how did Satan bear through the tool of the serpent he came to eat he didn't go to Adam and the very thing that he did he dealt with Eve and began to project to her you know God had already said you're multiply and replenish the Earth but God had not made known his will his timing all the way all the way that it would be in the season God had not made that known so where did Satan come to tempt and to test them out when it came not to say oh what God Said ain't the truth you know you ain't gone there's not going to be no multiplying that's not how he came and attacked it the way that he came and attacked it was is to try to get her to move ahead you know if Satan cannot keep people back from the word of God then he'll try to push them beyond the will of God same thing with Sarah we find you know what happened there with Eve then you find the same thing with Syria it's very important that we say that Sarah this is before before God came down and God identified himself with her by giving her of his of his letter of a that that Breath of God to where his presence there would have come to her life before that time it was sarri I am and so she I think my opinion my thoughts I'll tell you friends we don't have no business with our thoughts or our opinions our thoughts and our opinions ought to be before the prince of God that's the truth you know you don't want me preaching my opinions and I'm going to preach my opinions I don't want my thoughts I want what God wants because opinions and thoughts ain't gonna Rapture nobody it ain't gonna give no overcoming power to nobody but the one thing that'll give overcoming power and bring Deliverance is the word of God preached by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so to find out when you look at Sarah here she got ahead notice it was God's will think of this now it was God's will that there would be a seed that would come from the very loins of Abraham right but God has not revealed the pathway or the womb of who it was to be at that time although that Sarah was God's intended womb for Abraham's seed but yet Abraham's seed under that of the urging of Sarah under her voice under the timing under the way she said why don't you give your seed here to that of Hager a bonds woman now notice nothing wrong with Abraham's seed there's nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost it's just got to fall upon the right individuals come on somebody the Bible says in the last days that he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh and upon my servants and my handmaids God has an intended target for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost look what it did look what that seed did within Ishmael Ishmael himself could never come under the authority of the word yet he could say I am a son of Abraham but he never came under the headship of the word but look what the difference was when it actually came into the intended womb of Sarah and that Seed Life of Abraham moved in that time it was a seed life that God had allowed Abraham to dry up and become as good as dead and then God himself raised that back up God himself changed their their bodies and God himself is the one who actually brought the promise to pass it was not Abraham's strength it was the strength of Jehovah that brought forth his promised word and you look at Isaac here you find one then where that life has come it's one who's under the headship of the word it didn't mean that he didn't make mistakes but remember when the presence of God came to him he made whatever was wrong he made it right come on somebody you see this is why it's not our righteousness there's one who's the king of righteousness and that is our Melchizedek and that same life in us we're born of that we're born after the order of Melchizedek and then as he's the king of righteousness then that's what's exhibited in the kingdom of God is righteousness of almighty God Glory now watch us here just a few moments let's look at this example let me just show you here in the word or let the Lord just take us in the book of Exodus you find something here and I don't know if I'll read all these verses or just refer to them but you find here is Moses and here is something that takes place in verse 13 where Moses father-in-law Jethro is taking no notice of something and it came to pass on the morrow that Moses set to judge the people and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening and when Moses father-in-law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sidest thou by self alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even and Moses said unto his father-in-law because the people come unto me to inquire of God when they have a matter they come to me and I judge between one and another I do make them know the statutes of God and his laws and Moses father-in-law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good thou Wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou are not able to perform it thyself alone hearken now unto my voice and I will give thee counsel and and God shall be with thee be thou for the people to God's word that thou mayest bring the causes unto God now when you look on down in the scripture without me going through and reading it God here here uh Moses father-in-law he begins to lay down what needs to be done you teach him the ordinances you teach these men the statutes and so forth and then he says in verse 21 that Marvel Thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear God men of Truth hating covetness and and thus our place over them to be rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifty rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter that they bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee and he goes on to say you know if thou would do this and and verse 24 says Moses heart into the voice of his father-in-law key point he hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law his father-in-law made a good observation he could see the weariness that was upon Moses that there's no way I mean he's he's seen him you know whether he was staggering or whatever you was going on he did and he you know he could look at there's no way that you are going to be able to do this because here's what it comes down to if Moses Burns himself out what good are you for the kingdom that's why the Bible says be you not weary and well doing there Comes A Time to Say no here's there comes a time to rest come on somebody you see but what they were seeing because when you look at it he was letting it be known hey I'm seeing you need to rest you you need you can't be you can't be taking all this upon yourself what he has said to Moses it's good it's it's good uh counsel and all those things but the difference is is it's got to be of the Lord and let me tell you something when it's of God remember what's the whole objective here the whole objective that it shall be easier for thyself not that you have an easy way to go but that you yourself are not coming to a place of that weariness to where that you're not going to be able to serve true so let's see how this works out let's see if this is easier numbers 11 verse 14. here is Moses I am not able to the Lord I'm not able to Bear all this people alone wait a minute I thought he had all of these rulers enable men men of Truth men who hated covenants I thought he had all of them set up that he would be able to teach them and that through that right there he himself would not be so worried so even though he's got everything p's and q's he still feels alone he still feels old he's not supposed to feel this what was mentioned in the earlier part in Deuteronomy by his father-in-law was supposed to relieve this burden but it didn't and if thou deal look what look what Moses said if thou deal thus with me kill me he didn't even ask God say Lord give me a vacation he said you know what just kill me just end it I mean I I I can't take no more I pray thee out of hand if I have found favor in myself can you imagine that Lord if I found favor kill me and let me not see my wretchedness do you realize what's being said right here Moses himself you see God's burden within Moses he realizes this is the people of God though there's been times where they disobeyed but yet they are God's inheritance and they deserve the very best glory be to God they deserve the very best and Lord as he's saying right now Lord I can't give them the very best I am wretched I am weary I can't do this alone wow he's got all of this structure everything is lined up you know he's got the treasure the deacons the trustees all those things be it he's alone well y'all getting quiet you're wondering where I'm going and the Lord said unto Moses gather unto me 70 men of the Elders of Israel whom thou notice thou knowest notice who's together Moses whom thou knowest because there could have been ones in the camp that said tell you what I think brother so and so I'll make a good one hello somebody but see Moses no brother so-and-so Moses no brother so-and-so might be a little stubborn a little bit hard and not really moving with the rest of the vision good brother wonderful brother but just not really one who would work one with a vision now you know God don't like yes men how many all know that God don't like yes men but you bet at the reality of it God wants people who are in tune with his vision that's God's desire and there can be that reciprocal work of we're saying hey you think about this if you consider this but you see it works in harmony with the vision I'll tell you friends that's why it's so important that when even the choosing of a church that a church is chosen based on does listen this is what brother Ram gave us are they standing for the word and is the presence of God the supernatural there he never mentioned anything else you know why because every single church is sovereign one might take up the offering this way one might do it this way but everyone is Sovereign what makes it Sovereign you must find the leadership of the Holy Ghost for that group of people God don't want you to realize even to pattern pattern after this hold this assembly here or we'll pattern after this God don't want us pattern after nobody he wants us to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you friends that's why it's so important it's just like when you know a person can gather together all sorts of quotes and they can gather together all their scriptures and everything else but where it comes down to it is where does all of this get placed where's the presence of God within it all where does it all get balanced out foreign here's the difference gather unto me so Moses is going and Moses is bringing these 70 elders in but who's he following not Jethro's voice God's voice and it looks like he's bringing him to himself he's not he's Gathering them unto the Lord seventy men of the Elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the Tabernacle the congregation that they may stand there with thee and I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and I will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not alone you know what God was saying I will vindicate my word I was not saying away with order but what God was said I will vindicate my order in my time my choosing you realize even before they got the Holy Ghost they were already going to choose somebody else you know Judas is not with us no more uh so we got to choose somebody you know and so the Bible says the lot fell on the thighs like brother bam said that was man's Choice Paul was God's choice big difference right Matthias was minestrone brother say you don't read anything else about him but yet one thing was sure what was important he got the Holy Ghost right but he wasn't he wasn't used of God the way that the rest of them thought it ought to be but you see what it was it's kind of hard to know the program of God when you're outside looking in you've got to get into it and mainly the program of God get in you and when the program of God get inside of you then you know God's program by a personal experience oh yeah you can witness it out here the Lord Jesus told them in the Book of Luke he said your Witnesses this day but even though they were Witnesses of the supernatural reality of the resurrected power of the word but yet they themselves still had to go to the upper room and be born of a spirit of almighty God where that they would become Witnesses of that Living God we learn a very valuable lesson here seek the will of God not simple and you must have faith it's God's will because whatever has been revealed to be God's will you're going to be tested on it sometimes you're going to be testing on it and feel like it's not that's why the Precious Precious reality of when God Reveals His will there's something where you have given of your heart and you are submitted to that then you say Lord I don't understand this it looks like it's all going haywire but Lord this is what you said sometimes it takes a little bit for a person to come to that and where they themselves will settle down you know to wear that hey everything itself everything ain't going to go just peachy clean there's going to be tests and trials all sorts of things going to come out timing timing timing timing timing timing timing's everything in so not only got to be God's way so you could look at Jethro compared to this in numbers and say well what's the difference one key thing God's way God's timing even though maybe the ordering in the structure what's wrong with men of Truth nothing that's a wonderful thing what's wrong with selecting men who hate covenants nothing it's wonderful thing but it's got to be God's way timing timing timing this is where the Lord Jesus would mention to us in regards to patience over and over throughout the scriptures even Paul would refer to it the god of of patience Jesus would say impatience possess your souls in the book of Lamentations chapter 3 verse 24 the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord psalms 27 14 wait on the Lord be of good church now you know what if all these scriptures here we could go on and on if verse says wait on the Lord that means there's going to be times you're going to be waiting it means there's going to be times where the impatient part about us is going to be tested or let's say our patience is going to be tested but this is where the admonition of the word now you reckon that David was writing this right here just so you know sitting in the Ivory Towers and saying let me see what be good what be good words to a song hmm what be a good tune here let me try to get a new you know a new song I got to make sure the words rhyme no David was writing this by experience wait on the Lord David knew what he was to wait on the Lord and He also knew what it was not to wait on the Lord he's riding by experience wait on the Lord so notice and be of good courage why how are we of good Courage by by staying in his presence by feasting on his word by taking in from him he gives you an eye the strength and the expectancy like how the prophet would tell us in the dramatization of Abraham when Abraham himself and they would store up the diapers when God had told them you're going to have a child and yet here for 25 years God let the promise linger right a lot of things listen to me a lot of things came up in Abraham's life that the devil could have pointed out and said aha what about year two aha what about year five aha what about year seven do you realize all of those things the devil could have continually tried to put before him why where did Abraham get his strength he got his strength because he judged him faithful who made the promise Abraham rested I didn't call myself out that wasn't some kind of voice that just struck my head that wasn't my imagination that was the Lord God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I see on the Lord the Bible would tell us they did wait on the Lord Isaiah 40 31 they that wait on the Lord shall re-new their strength God moves us through the Redemptive stages of Grace it deals with a person's heart he convicts your life to where you recognize I'm undone I need a savior and he presents himself that I am your savior he lets you know I've already saved you but he wants you to recognize what he has already done for you and acknowledge that and say Lord forgive me of my sins Lord I'm a sinner I'm in need of your grace and then you walk on with him and the Bible says blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and so you begin to walk on feeding on that word taking in the word that God deals with your heart let this go uh watch this right here and and he's dealing with your heart upon things but you see the hunger The Thirst it has to be for him you know think about this when you're hungry what do you do do you go to bed when you're hungry I don't the worst thing to do when you're hungry is go walk through the grocery store now you all know that just from I mean they teach you that in school you don't ever do that you come out more junk in that cart you need than anything well it's a hard one you know I mean unless you're going to Sam's Club and they got all the samples out then you are right but if you're hungry blessed are they that do Hunger what should you do if you're hungry eat eat the right things Lord I want the Holy Ghost so that eat the right things Lord God I I'm so thirsty Lord Ben make sure you're drinking the right things impatience possess you your souls your patience is that what Lord this is your word I want to be one with you Lord I want your word Lord just so and fill my life and as you keep moving keep walking patience is is to know that God has never failed God will not fail God will perform his word and you keep moving along and watch how God will bring the final transformation and Captain a capping of Redemptive Grace and then you find your patience it'll just continue to grow it continues to grow foreign this is a time and an hour we need we we should be getting more patient and less impatient the world is different the world wants instant now that's the way the world is I know I hadn't graduated high school yet I know that I know I'm not talking about me I know I ain't graduated high school yet but I want a job that pays six figures okay so if we just get the right president and maybe they'll McDonald's will end up paying that amount of money some of you'll get that tomorrow that was free but you understand what I'm saying it's look out of time when this is an hour that requires patience and it's a time when people are becoming more impatient you realize it's its influences friends it's you say well it's demons I agree it's demons but remember there before demons could influence the people there in the days of Noah to get them in the spirit of destruction there had to be vessels channels that them demons could project themselves through that's why the Bible says in Genesis 6 that the Earth was filled with violence through them it was people who opened themselves up if I can say it this way to the spirits the media in that hour it was the Instagram of that hour the Facebook of that hour I tell you what what you feed on you will become what you feed on will dominate your life do you realize there are spirits there is not something that is spirit-free I know there's a lot of nonsense about fat-free sugar-free and this right here but there is nothing that is spirit-free are you with me it's the discernment of what spirit is motivating this it ought to be something in your life that you look on it is this drawing me closer to the Lord or is it causing a greater distance I kind of like that because there's nothing spirit-free that's the same thing with God's word when we can be in the channel of the Holy Spirit then the honor the glory the power that's in that word is poured out upon God's people God don't want a spirit-free word he don't want to fat free sugar-free word God likes a word that is come with power and demonstration Hallelujah it has the ability to take a life and live that life and break sins change who is that it takes more than a letter it takes the god of the word to come and vindicate his word [Applause] but you find Israel God had given them theocracy his leadership but Israel wanted democracy God gave him theocracy they wanted democracy come on somebody the Bible said Samuel told him all the words in first Samuel 18 of Unto the people that asked of him a king and they themselves he told them what manner of the king it's going to Reign Over You he let him know how I'm not going to read it today because you can read it when you get home he let him know and I think this is what's very key the very first phrase I'll read here in this scripture he will take your sons and a point for himself for his chariots and to be his Horsemen and some shall run before his church you go on and on his his his what's the difference listen was it that Israel did not come together and go fight battles in the past you know you can't fight battles in disarray come on somebody you can't fight battles with divisions so if you can't fight it with divisions you've got to know where you're supposed to be standing win that battle you got to know what ground you're supposed to cover come on somebody it wasn't that Israel you know was just a you know a bunch of people just walking around like well I'll tell you God's just leading us and they're walking around like they ain't got no direction in their life not so they had Direction in their life there was Direction there was captains there was Elders there was these things there was chariots there was all of that but the difference is is that God had orchestrated it not man but by their choice now it's the orchestration of man this is the difference like we looked at between Moses Moses father-in-law and the Lord the difference was the presence of the Lord right that's that's the great difference here and you see it just like how's that God would go on through Samuel he would warn the people and even after you know the thing that's different let me just point out to this this is different when you look at the difference between the theocracy and the Democracy the difference is with the theocracy it's God stirring the hearts of the people when it came time to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness Moses never had to tell one person now you give up your honest stones now you give up the gold hairs now you spin this together you make these garments you give it he never had to say that it's simply the vision was made known and those who had Onyx Stones surrendered they caught the will of God for their life nobody had to tell them because God through an open Vision had spoke lip to ear they were all here in the same sermon but yet God was speaking lip to ear ning it was the same way it was in the times you know when Cyrus rose up Cyrus began you know to call on them and different ones through the spirit of the Lord raised up to go back and then even in a time of Nehemiah you find that even when it came time for the offerings to be gathered for that of Solomon's Temple who was that that stirred that up God did it it wasn't something that had to be demanded it was God that did it it was God's leading you realize the prince of God is what balak and Balaam were blinded too you couldn't have put one finger listen to me now their sacrifice was perfectly in order perfectly in order fundamental to the Core but do you realize what was the difference Balaam although being a prophet he could not recognize the presence of God with those people couldn't recognize that and you realize how the devil did it he called him up and said here come look at the Honda parts because he even changed the position oh wait a minute you're just not seeing him in the ride you're not seeing them in the right light you need to come over here to my house I mean you need to come over here to the angle and let me give you a little bit of scoop well I give you a little bit of scoop about things of course I've got quotes to go with it as well when I do that you'll see the back Parts I tell you right now that kind of a spirit is an anointing from hell that is not the anointing of almighty God come on somebody it is not for the people of God to pick apart the people of God vultures pick apart one another not equals of God Eagles ought to encourage other eagles [Applause] Oh Glory but you see what was missing the presence of God they were fundamental fundamental everything is just fundamentally right everything is just exactly right we've got all of this just right but you're missing one thing what's that the presence of the Lord and that means everything here's Samuel let him know laughs but the people in verse 19 they refuse to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us you know I often wonder when Samuel was actually delivering this you know God told him he hearken to him and he said but I want you to protest solemnly I I wonder if when Samuel you know the presence of God coming down and Samuel was just ministering there and protesting Solomon I wonder if there's parts of it where he could see that maybe some of them was almost like a gripper they were almost moved in a certain way and here he is he just all of a sudden you know moves in that channel Lord here's one right here Lord God they look like they're moving and about that time then all of a sudden they would just pull back from it but you see as Samuel he was going and approaching this not as some formality he was taking this as though there could actually be a turning around but they said nay but we're going to have a king over us that we may also be like all the nations and that our King May judge us so well they wanted the Judgment of man they didn't want the Judgment of God and go out before us and fight our battles now they didn't want to stop being called God's people they still wanted to be called God's people but they wanted to do their own thing they wanted their own way are you with me they still wanted you yeah we you know we still want Miracles we still want manifestations we still want all those things and we still want the priests to go out before us but we just want the king himself to lead us out we we just we we still you know we love you Samuel there's nothing that that has been done that's been wrong you know but we just want a king who's one of us you know to lead us but they didn't recognize what they were doing do you realize friends that even as you and I we come here and we sit here in this place that God has given us do you realize who comes down service after service and deals with our hearts who is it that guides and directs the services and what's to be brought and wants to be said within that time he's doing that that's not something that a man puts together just because a man has a study program don't mean he's got a gift in his life it's going to be a gift there that surrendered to the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so it would see him within it how did it would come down and that same God that will deal with our hearts let me tell you something it ought to be something within our hearts not to pattern after the things of the world we want to live a life that's holy unto God at all times to where it's not just one day out of the week we come to the house of God and sense his presence but it ought to be something as you evaluate your life is his presence abiding in my life day after day is my life a reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you something you can work and have your workplace filled with people they pack a Bible just like you and let's say even they can pack a King James Bible just like you but there's got to be a difference they can come right here to this church just like you but there's got to be a difference there's one thing that's a difference and you might say well I believe God sent a prophet the Muslims believe in a prophet right a prophet is not what makes the difference what makes the difference is is the presence of almighty God Hallelujah to really recognize what God has done in the ministry in this hour is to make you and I aware of the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ to every single day when we're outside it ought to be a testimon do you realize all sorts of things can be presented your way certain things to try to draw you and try to attract you I'm telling you friends this is why the new birth it's not an option that you're born again you must be born again it's to be patterned after the Lord Jesus Christ to love him and say well you know I just I just love him you know it's my savior but he did more than just a savior from your sin he wants to cleanse you he wants to fill you with himself he wants to be the Lord of your life but the way so many times it is it's Lord I'll show up and do my duty I'll do my time and then on the other days of the week do what I want to do listen friends I've got to be honest with you that's a pattern Bound for hell you want to make it you do not want to go to that place you do not even want to be left here in the tribulation time you don't want to be left here do you realize when he appears even in his descent even into Israel and then as he would appear do you realize even the foolish virgin will be wailing at that time when he descends back from that marriage supper of the Lamb coming then with the armies then and Armageddon they will well and even the rest of the re of the living creation who has been tormented while God's visiting Israel they will cry for the rocks to hide them hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb it's a time now to run to the mercy of the Lamb let me tell you friends it don't matter how long you've known about this message here no matter how long you've come to this church the question still comes down have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed it don't matter how long and how much you know you can be around the message you can talk God all you want you can talk quotes and everything else but do you have the presence of God packing in your life is it Vindicated in your life so often friends we've got things all around us where people can hand out quotes and have no Divine Vindication in their life no backing in their life whatsoever of the presence of almighty God I'll tell you right now that's a sorry situation to be in but you don't have to stay that way you can actually have a power where you can have joy down in your soul you can actually have joy and enjoy serving God [Applause] y'all with me let's go like this it'll help me is to be transformed you see Israel wants to be a separated people from the world they were not to look like the world they were not to act like the world they were to be a separated people that's why over and over there's times Corrections needed the standard of the word is needed to be brought forth whether it's music whatever it might be whether it's it and there has to be a standard of the word when it's always set before and let me tell you something Holiness itself it ought to be Holiness on the outside and it ought to be a Holiness to match it on the inside it ought to be Holiness on the inside and Holiness on the outside a pattern a pattern A Life That's patterned after the word may God help us that was the one difference what was the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations the presence of God you take the prince of God away from Israel and they were like any other Nation you take the prince of God away from Samson he's like any other man the difference is the presence of almighty God this is why everything that we do God would tell you tell Samuel hearken to their voice hearken to him go ahead make the king this is where that we look at anything you know it's important sometimes is it really where it really takes the patience and the grace of God sometimes to know a person's heart a lot of times what I'm saying is that we don't all together know know a person's heart but you know how it is with your wife between you your wife and your husband if you're not married you just kind of have to take a word for it it would be like your mom or dad or if you're raised by your grandparents they get to know you you make mistakes there's things that in the midst of it maybe you've said something a little wrong and they can tell you I think you said that wrong but when they know your heart that's what makes a difference are you with me so when you when you look at this It's always important in knowing a motive and objective on things because the motive and objective that's what's going to be the determinant you know you and I can look at things well I'll just tell you I'll just tell you for myself I've learned to quit being like a Quick Draw McGraw pray for more you know God's God's taught me you know just shut your mouth and pray about it and wait sorry to be so plain but probably some of you got that I mean didn't have no acronyms to text that out to you because you know what I've come to find I need God's grace a whole lot too oh yeah I need his grace a whole lot too and sometimes when it is you know God has a way that's oh my it's Unique God can allow you to go through some of the same things and then you have a little bit more sympathy and empathy you can think why in the world that person act this way huh just wait just wait now you understand not that that's condoned but you'll have a little bit more understanding and Grace anybody want to be pastor in the Bible the first thing when we look at what we're ever going to do you look at it but the REM says the first thing I always want to try to find out is whether it's God's will or not to do a certain thing amen so first of all it's it's looking in his word is it God's will you give ourselves to God's will sometimes we're waiting on things for God to guide and direct us you know in his will sometimes I know that for myself and I no doubt each of you find that same way sometimes brother Brown says you know he says sometimes people feel like the pastor is a little slow on doing things he said he's the ox of the team the ox of the team got four feet on the ground he's not the prophet people still want a prophet we need what God has sent but God also has Ox to have four feet on the ground come on somebody and you can look in the heavenlies but the ox on the ground says yeah but I'm seeing what you're doing so you can't be flying as high as I think you're flying or you think you're flying they preach better Samuel preach Brothers Samuel why because the ox is looking and what is going on I mean that's when I you know the ox is doing it fourthly it's a slow guy you don't want an ox to run a race is that right but remember an ox is what they used on the Oregon Trail they didn't use horses horses won't endure listen what are you trying to say I'm not trying to say anything I'm just saying what you're giving me to say and Ox of the team would just hold it together because when they get to that land they've got to plow they're going to be plowing some hard ground and an ox is needed the event says a pastor is patient and believe me I remind him Lord you said I'm patient you said that lays Within Me Lord Lord help me praise the Lord that's the truth it's not it's not automatic it's see God makes known what's in us and then we say Lord help me help me help me what is that that's you bring forth what you put in Glory but the Bible says he said this is what I told Brother Collins he said I always want to know if it's God's will or not and then I test my motive towards doing it brother Brian he covers this beautiful power transformation many other places I just I like this particular one as well I like all of them but I just this is so it's just real simple then I test my motive towards doing it if I have no selfishness nothing and I know it's God's will and I'm doing it for that purpose because it's his will he won't fail you then so with no selfishness I know it's God's will and I'm doing it because it's God's will then he won't fail because why it's him making known his will giving us the strength to fulfill his will but if history look at this this is powerful but if it's his will and you got a selfish motive in it it's just the same as it not being his will that's right because it won't you mean something can be God's will yeah he said not being his will yeah when when when it's a selfish motive behind it this is where even hearts or motives and objectives in everything that we do you don't take for example how many times you hear Brother Brahm say the Joneses paint their steps green so it just Green's a new color It's The End God I have my steps painted green listen you telling me something's wrong with green paint not a bit are you telling me something's wrong with having my stuff's painted not a bit what's motivating you to do it are you telling me it's wrong for me to have you know my child's birthday party at Pizza whatever no what's your motive in doing it well I just wanted to have a good time or is it you're wanting to compete with the rest of everybody else at the school you know what as well as I know you've seen people that compete with one another in weddings come on somebody preach with me they want to outdo somebody else man and they don't care they're willing to go in debt it would be more important to invest on becoming one and you walk down the aisle Barefoot and he walked down the aisle with bibbed overhauls on and you walk out debt free and you'll be one in heart than to be in debt and Out of Love because it is not the greatness and the magnitude of the wedding oh did you see that dress nothing wrong with all of that but sometimes it's such the deadness of things please don't misunderstand me but sometimes the emphasis is placed on the wrong things and people are vexed anxious and yet there's nothing wrong if you can afford it and and you're doing it for the right reasons nothing wrong it's like radio broadcast that brother Monica seems to do a radio broadcast he used to didn't he I know of many Souls one out there is that right sister Caroline brother Stephen abali who was here you're a member of the Stephen from Uganda and you remember the testimony that he gave the amount of souls that's what's stirring in Uganda right now because the radio broadcast where they're going on they play a little bit of the message and then they come behind it and they preach there has been churches the the Baptist churches and other churches they can't keep up with it brother Stephen keeps sending me stuff they can't keep up with the souls that's coming out now I want you to think of this what if now I know there is I know there I know I know there is I know there's people that he'll bless God brother Branham was against radio broadcast really perhaps you need to read in a message a little bit more animals against that all that broadcasting stuff you need to read in the message a little bit more brother Branham himself supported he said I support radio broadcast he said I support A.A Allen's I said he went through a list of them and brother Branham would tell the people hey hey he said did you hear Brother Neville preached here the other day he said my goodness he said I'll tell you what you do the next time he said when brother Neville's getting ready to come on you get all your neighbors and bring them in your house and you sit down and turn on that broadcast so they can hear Brother Neville so if we take the attitude that radio broadcast is denominationalism then somehow we're missing the mark But Sam are you saying you're going to start a radio broadcast no because God ain't led me to do that what I'm trying to put out here is there's certain things that lay in the message that what the difference is look it don't matter if you have a radio broadcaster you don't have a radio broadcast that is not a qualification for the rapture come on somebody no more than if you take the offering at the beginning of the service or the end of the service that has nothing to do with the rapture come on somebody but you see this right here with these things the way brother Brown could go through it look at listen to brother Branham if you listen to what he said brother Ben there's many messages brother Brandon will give to us and say Hey I just heard this the other day on the radio broadcast brother Branham was not an isolationist are you hearing me he was one who believed in separation unto God but he said over and over I'm not an isolationist you see there's a difference between isolationism and separate isolationism draws apart us us and no more but separation says I'm separated unto the power of God and we can walk among people and we have hearts for people to know that that same power of God that's moving in our life all it takes is it to break on their life that's it amen that's what he said that's not my words those are quotes so it's separate unto the Lord even how many times that brother Branham would go on and on with these with the different things even with as I said with the radio broadcast and all that and even brother Brown just here just the other morning listen to the very beginning of sudden secret going away from the church now if you want on these quotes I've got them but if you look at sudden Seeker going away from the church brother Brandon even says on the opening part of that message he said now Lord he said there's some people that's unable to make it to the house of God this morning he said no doubt they're going to read their Bibles and they will listen to the ministers that will be on the radio that will encourage them and edify them what is everything to be done for the edification of the body if a specialist sung if a song or a testimony whatever it is it's to be done for the edification this is where motives and objectives are so needed to be tested and to say Lord let me just Reserve to you hello let me just Reserve to you because you remember brother Branham got into place one time where he was criticizing hey Alan criticized it was men word made flesh India trip and brother Brown says I want you to pray for me I've developed a critical spirit then at the end of the message he calls that critical spirit he said remember I want you to pray for me I've developed a selfish spirit he said I'm wanting to go around and tell everybody where they're wrong and he said that it's not that's wrong that's wrong he said that's not for me to do it they're God's men it's up to God I'm thankful for those examples in the word of God you see within when you look at how that Samuel would even come uh just I'm done when Samuel would come we'll just stop there when Samuel would come even before the people he'd let them know okay this is what you want okay but he could tell him this is how things are going to be how could he tell him how things are going to be because of the manner of the king he could tell him the manner of the Kingdom same way Daniel by inspiration could tell them and you see it's just like this this morning by the attitude that you take towards the word of God there's a lot can be said what will transpire in your life even From This Moment forward maybe this is the first time you you're hearing the gospel preached but if you and your heart is a hunger within your heart that attitude that you take to it say Lord what I'm hearing this morning I want to give my life to you I want to surrender my life and then as we hear it Lord I want I want to walk that separated walk it's not just because you know the preaching of the word we shouldn't dress this way we should do that but Lord want that on the inside of me where it's a difference on the inside of me because I want to please you this is your word that's been delivered this ain't brother Samuel's thoughts this is your word I want to line up with your word I want to line up with you I want to please you I want your presence I want my life across my heart to be welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome that's what I want Lord and you welcome him in continuing to welcome him in even in all of our lives Lord Jesus I want to walk pleasing my motives my objectives I need the word to check to discern I also need his I need his strength to wait to be patient sometimes you can feel pressures of this Abraham fell pressures Abraham you ought to be doing you can feel precious but remember make sure that you're not acting out of pressure act in obedience to his leading because if you act out of pressure imagine this if I acted out of pressure from one person in here guess what that opens it opens up a can of worms to then be open to everybody but if I'm open to one person and I don't mean to hurt your feelings but I'll take his leading any day over your leadings because I've got to give an account not only for my soul I've got to give an account for every soul in here sometimes there's times where we've got to wait on things wait on things to get just right and these things to be put in the right place but you know what God is faithful I've seen that time and time again God will always provide for himself don't you love him that's the truth friends he'll always provide for himself he's faithful don't let the things of the world if they've got a grip on your heart let God just loosen you let him have control you're a young person or old person give yourself to the Lord I mean really give yourself don't just come to the church give yourself to God feed on his word drink from him and talk to him ask him say Lord I I want to know you more Lord will you speak more to me speak to My Heart Lord Jesus not just the in church he wants to talk to you out of church he wants to be your lord he wants to be your buddy he wants to be your friend he wants to be the one that's the go-to person he wants to be the one that is your BFF your best friend forever except he's eternal he's your best friend you could ever have he stick closer than a brother glory be to God faithful let him be your king let him guide you he'll be faithful he is you love him let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer I wonder as we prayed here this morning is there any that you would like to maybe you don't you have men serving the lord maybe you'd like to accept the Lord Jesus Christ your savior is there someone here this morning that would like to you would raise your hand from your heart and say I want to accept that Lord Jesus you talked about this morning I want to accept him I want to receive his pardoning grace for my sins I want to accept him what he's already done for me if you do it just slip your hand up right now he'll meet you right there in your heart where he's already been dealing with you he'll meet you right there there'd be someone here this morning God bless that hand back here God bless you son God bless you maybe there's somebody else back here young man someone say I want that presence of God I want a holy ghost in my life that's what I need God bless your hand God bless your hands now listen you raised your hands his presence dealt with your heart and remember he didn't play and he's not playing with your emotions I don't it don't matter how many times that you may have your heart may have been inclined but I want you to set your heart on it right now that he made the promise with you in mind for as many as the Lord Our God shall call you're part of that word that promise if you've followed within the word you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ being identified in his burial identified with your sacrifice because with that comes repentance and you're surrendering your life and you're letting God the greatest is our Lord cleansing my life Lord I want to be filled then let me tell you that promise is for you this morning couldn't erased your hand if he hadn't dealt with your heart in an age where an age is so indifferent and so hard but yet when your hand being lifted up to the Lord there's a heart behind that that the Holy Ghost has touched this morning and I want you to know this I stand here as a messenger [Music] of that Holy Ghost [Music] his desire is for you [Music] and you you believe in the Holy Ghost is for me and you make preparations like Abraham and Sarah did you make preparations to receive it you go ahead and you start taking that word into your heart that is my promise he made the promise of the Holy Ghost with me in mind if there wasn't nobody else in this earth he himself would have come down to redeem me because I belong to him and I'm giving my heart you concentrate right now in your heart that everything else there's nothing that matters I must have his presence that Holy Spirit dwelling in the center of my life I need that more than anything else in the world you set your heart that way and you watch him come and do for you you may not feel one little thing but you set your heart to it and you watch there's a manifestation of his presence that'll move right and it'll bring the change in your life nobody will have to know that you've been changed and transformed and that there's a fire on the inside of your life but you won't only be a clean person you'll be a person who's on fire because the flame will burn inside of you [Music] I wonder how many before we go to prayer would say Lord I want to refill him of the Holy Ghost I want a rededication Lord a refilling [Music] if there's any patterns or anything anything in at all Lord burning out Lord there's one Focus I've got that's you I want to please you more than anything [Music] as we go to the Lord in prayer we're going to pray together and his sweet presence that's here right now that's been walking up and down the aisles and moving up and down in the hearts of your of his people that same God it's right here to move in with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's here to move in and sanctifying power he's here to move in in the refilling of the Holy Spirit right now and as we go to prayer you believe that and you make ready to receive that [Music] let's pray Lord Jesus [Music] father though we've come and we've set in a building that's located at a physical location off of Lake Breeze Road but father we've moved from this location your God Under The Canopy of your divine presence Lord Jesus you have come and you have ministered your word to deal with our hearts it's truth through the foolishness of preaching you chose that way and that order Lord God and father it's your presence not the word so much as it is your presence Lord that Lord would move those words into a place to where it discerns Lord where it breaks chains the Lord God where it dismantles holds where it lifts Faith Lord where it Lord God gives Grace Lord where father Lord it moves Lord hearts Lord God towards you it's you Lord and now Lord these hands that swim up but God from that little boy back there Lord God erased his hand he won't accept you as his savior he said I want that Jesus I want him to be my savior in the pardoning grace I pray father right now God and Lord is he praying Lord in his heart Lord God I pray father the Lord you witness that Lord God right there in his heart this morning Lord God that he senses that release Lord God of the burden Lord to know there has been one Lord that's his burden Bearer Lord one that has taken Lord his Lord and guilt of Shame Lord I Thank you for touching his heart Lord God before the world can get a hold of him Lord God you touched his heart Thank You Lord God may you continue to guide him Lord step by step Lord God only into the Waters of baptism Lord God granted father we pray this morning Lord there's hearts that are gathered here sincere and honest hearts then Lord God hands were up but it was actually Lord their heart that they were holding up their desire is that you would feel their heart [Music] I pray father right now if there be anything Lord that even would be brought Lord God to their mind right now Lord God I pray father that day Lord God will settle that with you right now that father to know Lord God that there has been a repentance of sin and Lord if there be anything Lord God that would hinder may I pray father has their Heart is Open Lord may you pour out God of your sanctifying power and

Revival let me be the Revival I pray this morning Lord grant him every heart Lord God as we recognize that day recognize our message Lord we are here Lord God abiding Lord in that house of David that
