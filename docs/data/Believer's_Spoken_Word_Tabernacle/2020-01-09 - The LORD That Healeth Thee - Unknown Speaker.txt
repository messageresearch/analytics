Trevor god bless just good to have you amen so we just so thankful for the mercy of God once again you all sound like you were having a wonderful time it's wonderful to come into the presence of the Lord it's a place of refreshing it's where the Brenham would call it in this oasis it's an oasis in this desert and a place that we can come you know we could come just to this building and it would still be a desert it's not the building that makes it it's him and you know what goes along with that is is the desire longing within our hearts through many dangers toils and snares I have already gone this grace that has brought me safe this farm it's great so safely take me home amen it's hearts its lives that welcome him you know the rapture itself is the product of the working of the word the person of the word in our life that brings forth a welcoming spirit it welcomes him back to this earth that's the kind of spirit I want where he feels welcome to come Amy let's just bow our heads before we open the Word of God tonight a matter you have a need on your heart you want to just make known to the Lord keep it up on your heart Heavenly Father or Jesus you are mindful of every single need Lord you've showed us in your word that there's no circumstance nor condition that's too small or insignificant you took Lourdes in this hour to show us Lord where the Prophet he was out fishing that little fish Lord brother branham described it as a fish he said that barely it was like skin over a hook they pulled that hook out God as brother Brown described it everything within that little fish came out it looked like the sentence of death had struck it there was no more life within it even one that stood there Lord in the boat and said little fishy I guess you've shot your last one but father at that moment Lord you moved down and you spoke little fishy I'll give you back your life you showed us Lord that beyond all false beyond what all that our minds could even conceive Lord the Word of God prevails there's an old situation there's no circumstance that's too great for you father we ask tonight that Lord that you would pass by our way that you would take your word to speak personally to our lives you know every need you know what we have need of an Lord you know just how to say it we pray the Lord and for every need Lord behind every hand and Lord he will move from a request a need to that of a testimony Lord God that would be edifying Lord not only to that believer with their hand lifted up but fathered to the entire body of Jesus Christ granite may you come and just speak to us through your word we give ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's go in the word tonight Bibles to Exodus 15 and I want to go back into this portion of scripture here see how the Lord will take us just for sake of time this just started verse 25 of Exodus 15 where the people are at the waters of Marah and they cried unto Moses what shall we drink verse 25 it says of exodus 15 and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved and said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that he loved thee amen we're in the scriptures that he God has never forsaken no matter what situation arises God is is present to deal with that situation our experiences in our life you know a testimony is not something that is given to any of us a testimony is not something that can be handed to us we receive truly the testimony of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost by the new birth but there is an outworking within our life it's a working of our own personal testimony where the life of Jesus Christ is present there's tests there's trials there's things that comes our way and all are part of those experiences where by God he will prove his faithfulness to his word to our lives there's things that maybe you can look back in your life and say why did I make this decision you maybe can see things in your life where you see a decision you made and you say well I don't see anything that is productive or that is godly or that really come out of that but if you can really be reflective in the manner to look into your life and see that has there been growth in your life to where now you're even more sensitive to the decisions that are left before you there's things that you've you've grown from in your life you can all you can as like many of us we could try to say well I wish I wouldn't have made this decision I wish I would have done this decision different we can spend our lives wishing we had never or we can simply accept the grace of God that all things work together not that all are good but all things work together for our good to where we can actually learn even as the Prophet would tell us in his life story and many other times he would trust that what he was sharing with us throughout all of his decisions and mistakes that he would speak of he said I'm trust that they would be stepping stones of God's grace for your walk and for your life and I believe that was something that as believers that we can look at that within you know one another's lives and lives around us for me personally when I can see something maybe there's something that I can see well maybe I wouldn't have made that decision I have made this decision we know it's always easy if I can say it like this some of you understand to set in the quarterback chair it's always easy to be the one sitting in the you know the lay-z-boy and stood out on the field you can always look at things and say well this person should have done that and they should have done this but you know within the midst of it what we want to see is that when God allows us to see different things say Lord just help me to stay sensitive help me to stay healed it to you that decisions that I have coming up I'm just as much mortal as the other person is mortal I need your leadership Lord help me not to rest upon my own self or my own knowledge or seeing this but things that you show me are to pray about and that I might give myself even more to you we find that within this journey that's there's what God is showing within Israel you know Israel's just come out of the the Red Sea and brother Branham would give that of the Red Sea as a shadow of Pentecost where every one of their enemies were were destroyed behind them and washed upon the the sea shores brother Branham would also give that example of the Red Sea and tie that in to the Book of Revelations of where we will stand on the sea of glass and we will sing the song of victory he would tie that in and and speak of how that also that the enemy was after them to destroy them and speak of how that that is the enemy coming even after our physical health after our body but he said noticed child that God intervened when the enemy would have taken us and destroyed us after God bringing us out but God stepped in and I believe that we can understand that not only has God stepped into our lives before he ever took a hold of our lives but even after God's taken a hold of our life it is his hand upon our lives his brother Bannon would put it so clearly he said Oh God don't ever take your hand from off on my life he said because once that hand is taken from off my life he said the enemy will take my life so we want God's hand upon our life and you know and having God's hand upon our life it works within the scripture that his hand is his word is his power is his authority is his life it's his presence his word and then it calls to you and I that we would humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and say lord I need you each and every moment within my life we find that as we were looking at here some weeks ago of how that in the midst of this time when they came to this situation of waters of Marah and we all have been there or are there or will be there it's part of the journey this is not punitive but it is God actually teaching us as his children that situations will arise within this life but yet I am always the ever-present God and God wanted this to be a statue it you see there's experiences in our life that don't ever just take the expense and just toss it over your shoulder it's an experience and that experience you might share it with somebody else and it may not have the same meaning to someone else but what's important is is that it is an experience that has meaning to your life and this is what God lets Israel know this is a statute and an ordinance that God would teach them there that in that if you will remain faithful to my voice if you'll follow my word then I will not put any of the diseases of Egypt upon you God you didn't say that we had to understand it but if you'll follow it if you let your heart be open to it you realize that many of the diseases that are upon the world today even when we look at that of the flu you realize the flu is a plague that was poured out upon England when England rejected the gospel visitation that was porn that was coming to them they rejected it and there was a vial that was poured out of influenza and yet we find within our lives that we experience you know influenza but yet he God made a promise when sickness comes your way I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases he shows that he is God and that there is the promise as Psalms 91 that no plague shall come nigh thy dwelling when any sickness comes your way God's letting us know you don't be afraid of sickness even as he would remind us in this generation of the cancer age he would speak to us through through His Prophet and will remind you and I don't ever fear cancer why because there's one on the scene that's greater than cancer amen there's one on the scene here to deliver us from behold and all of that demonic oppression and those diseases from that demonic realm that would come in we realize sickness sickness itself is demons that that comes in to attack our bodies and and so here God would take them to let them know by an experience and this direction that Moses is given is to look upon the a little tree that is there and brother branham would would called this little tree and say you know that little tree said was a hyssop Bush and he said you know the hyssop you can never separate that it's always to be together brother band goes in to tell us in that place he said people can separate the cross and say the crosses for this and the crosses for that he said but you can't separate Christ you you can't you can even though the world you know has wanted to make Christ and how different meaning they wanted to take the name of Jesus Christ without the living reality of the deity of his name but you see there is a people of God chosen of God ordained of God that they within their hearts and life had a longing for that deity of Jesus Christ to be displayed in their life because it's the only thing that could ever bring victory in our life we were born defeated we were born without a chance as a matter of fact the life that we were in and even that we had steal walk among this life is nothing more than the Prophet would say has like a burning rubbish dump but yet when life has come into our lives that's what is real life we realized that all the rest of that really wasn't life at all but it comes the manifestation that as Jesus said I'm come that you might have life and that you might have it beyond imagine a man and so when we see it here this hyssop Bush was to be taken not just a part of it but to take the whole hyssop bush to cut it down and to put it in that water and when they put it in that water then through the hyssop route it actually brought us sweetening there to that water showing that in every situation that we go through that Christ himself he is the sweetening to every situation in our life you know was also attacked because everything within the scripture there's compound meanings with it all in this scripture it also goes to express remember in the scripture God would step forward and he would begin to reveal one of his seven compound redemptive names and he would reveal himself to Abraham that I am Jehovah Jireh the Lord provided you see God revealed himself not just to be revealing himself brother Ram said God does not just he'll to show his power but God comes and what he comes to do he does with the purpose because it is intended for the children of God to recognize what it's all about to think about it many around the prophets meeting many received healing they would come across the platform but did they really receive the depth of healing and to understand the purpose of what God was doing in this generation many did not know we understand some is dispensational but yet to understand the grace of God that no you and I and I believe I can say it there's not one of us that was there within those meetings but yet the revelation of Jesus Christ has struck our heart and there is a greater healing that has taken place within our life amen and we recognize what God has done within this generation that it was with you and I in mind and the scriptures that God promised our names are written within there that characteristic of Jesus Christ to be revealed in this hour our hearts were tied to that promise that's why churches could never satisfy the longing within our heart that's why even knowing theology of the message could never satisfy our heart but there was a longing and a craving for the very person of Jesus Christ and he knew you had have that craving he knew you would have that longing and he Jehovah Jireh provided for himself what you and I would have meat of and so we find that every experience God will reveal the attributes of his name and Animas we're looking at that hissa bush' cannot be separated it goes to say that you know if he is Jehovah Jireh he is our Savior then he is also Jehovah Rapha our healer he is also java sitka new he is also Jehovah Shalom he is all of the seven compound redemptive name and he will reveal himself to you and me as we have need of it there's plans in our life we need that revelation of jehova sholom to strike our hearts when situations have a rose that is trying our faith and and we're being oppressed by situations and accusations we need that revelation of jehova sholom for that moment there's times and sickness arises and we need the revelation of Jehovah Rapha for that moment he might have revealed himself before as you're over alpha but we know in that moment that's when we need for that revelation to strike our heart and you know what God never gets time of revealing himself and his children never give time of him revealing himself as he makes himself known and the same yesterday today and forever amen you can't separate him to the believer he's inseparable a man he's our Savior he's aren't healer he's our righteousness he's our deliverer he is our all in all and we apply that to every situation no matter how the bitterness would arise he is the same yesterday today and forever now you realize that there's no way that when we look at you know the Ministry of the word that there can ever be just a ministering on the soul without including divine healing because they go there girl each go together if you think back to Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 remember when God in the beginning when he told his children he said that you're not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for the day you eat thereof that day you surely die we recognized that when when Eve when the fall had come look at this the fall came by her entertaining a word that was contrary to the Word of God how long did it go on perhaps days on in maybe weeks on in that he or she received visitation after visitation but when she stopped to reason that's when death set in and words she received a word that was against God's Word now God gave them that word and he never asked them to explain how it's going to be he never asked him how to figure out how that you're gonna multiply and replenish the earth but you see God gave them the same basis that he has brought you and I on here tonight and that is to believe his word without explanation faith does not look for an explanation by faith itself is a divine revelation of God's will faith gives sight where these eyes will say and let reasoning enter I don't know how it could be but faith looks beyond what the doctor says faith looks beyond what reasoning said that's why faith it is necessary that we walk by faith and not by sight and there's only one way that we can really walk by faith and that's to receive the anointing of the word upon our life for this generation a man that reveals what God's program and what God's will is for our life and so there's no way you know when you think of how that a word would come that would lead God's daughter away from that perfect love and perfect understanding of the Word of God and you had say well how could it be a perfect understanding of the Word of God and yet they did not know how that multiplication was going to take place you realize a perfect understanding it's not that we know and then understand every little part about every little scripture but it's to know the god of the word and to know that that God of the word is the one that unfolds that word in that generation and in that season that word hope' glory that word leaves from just being a word it becomes a place of abode I think how brother Branham would say in God God's Word calls for a total separate he tells us in prayer he says Oh God let the people as they come across this platform tonight realize that they are approaching the temple of God what does he mean by approaching the temple of God it is where that a word that has been promised has now become unfolded as the person of Jesus Christ it has become a dwelling place so that the people of God can pass through that word and coming out on the other side they are made whole because the virtue of the Son of God is there in that word to release what is needed to that life I'm telling you this word it is not just letter the inspiration we've received it's not the inspiration a man the seals have been tore off and the inspiration from heaven and with the opening of the seventh seal has been poured down upon the book and we're not looking at this through the eyes of a man we are not looking at it through the eyes of a man but our eyes have been anointed by the Lord Jesus Christ I high priest himself is present with us hallelujah that's why they call us our bones that's why that they can understand brother been said why we don't yo cup with them he said but what it is there is a power and a vision behind this message amen it is sent from God to get a people ready and in order for rapture there's no way you and I could put ourselves in order though having the Bible but God here by divine inspiration inspiration comes on the music sheet and it begins to bring the symphony in harmony with a program of God because things were out of beat things were out of step and God had to bring us back in step and back in harmony with himself what did that the mercy of Almighty God it's the mercy of God a man the Lord that is promise and made real to you and I I am the Lord that healeth thee amen you know we could go from church to church and from situation to situation but you realize but a church could never heal us religion can never bring healing but there had to be one come that could bring that healing that we needed hallelujah when elijah came on the scene he came to deal with the source you find that how that every time when you look even in the Book of Jeremiah and throughout you know in the Book of Isaiah you read about healing it'll speak of how that when the children of Israel they would you know go their own way they would begin to forsake the things of God and they begin to you know they a sickness was entering in to their lives you say sickness yes remember sickness has a lot of symptoms there's a lot of symptoms you know even sometimes when you just to think about it if what the Lord has you know been moving upon my body with and removing that bronchitis from my body I'll begin to think back and I thought not you know perhaps you know even weeks and in the middle of December some of that was working you know on my body there and a cough that it started you know I didn't know but little things begin to work and you know that's how a sickness is it can work little by little there are symptoms and it's important that we read iagnosed the symptoms by the Word of God amen you know when we look at this here Elijah is you know in the midst of I have a situation and I I think of this word that we read in the scriptures tonight of the very last word there in Exodus 15 16 for I'm the Lord that healeth II this is the first time that God would make known himself that I am Jehovah Rapha he wouldn't make known that I am the healer what was it it brought it about and experienced there was a need well there was a need that was within Israel when Israel had began to forsake jehovah and they begin to go after other gods they begin to go after other remedies and trying to find other needs within their life but god had a man on the scene by the name of elijah they have hated him he didn't want nothing to do with him but remember God by His Word had revealed to Elijah call him to a Mount Carmel showdown and Elijah comes to this place he allows them you know to build their altars and how they build them in you know they ran around the altar and they were my had a great emotional time but there was no answer no answer of fire a mountain but they the the the the the the choice or or the challenge was put forth but the Bible tells us here I love this in first grade first Kings 1830 then Elisha said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the word repaired is Rafa he ruffled he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down we saw Elijah's ministry was a ministry that would come with healing in it where Israel had been broken you see what the altar the altar was representative of the brokenness of the fellowship between them and God the only way to repair that fellowship was get back to the altar of God get back to the original sacrifice get back to the true atonement get back to that to wear a life that is lived to please the Lord and him alone and so he repaired not another altar but he repaired the altar of the Lord Elijah stood there on Mount Carmel he took the loose ends that were scattered and he brought those loose ends to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it was a pattern for any life that is broken when that life will come in harmony with God's Word cannot build that life stone on top of stone and when God is building that light stone on top of stone no matter how broken it is the brokenness didn't take the stones away but the God who is there can restore Jehovah rif and bring together what is broken he can bring it back together that his glory might return it fall upon your life afresh he is the Lord that he loved thee he's going to the source and Elijah makes the prayer let it be known that I'm your servant Elijah wasn't asking that that before self-glorification he's letting it be known let it be known that I'm your servant one who has your word why because God directs his children by his word we find out the fire fell God came and answered God answered by fire and by answering by fire the veil was taken off their hearts or their hearts were turned unto the Lord God God is faithful think about the you know if I can skip ahead just to look at it Elijah as well here's a situation in the Bible in second Kings 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 19 there's a situation in a city that's very bad it's a situation the Bible would say that the situation I want you to look at this in verse 19 this situation of this city is pleasant it looks very the city it looks very becoming more pleasant but there is a need that these men of the city recognize you can see it's pleasant but the water is not and the ground is bearing and and I just said bring me a new cruise and put salt there and how many knows its salt is used for that of the Covenant salt is to call forth the Covenant it's to seal that covenant away and here the salt he calls for a new crew not a crew that's used before but we want a new cruise amen God will send an old message God sends a fresh message amen God sends a fresh message from the throne of God is that right amen and that fresh message that God even has sent to us in this generation it was not somewhat of an old message repackaged but it is restoring us back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers restoring us back to that same power that same Authority that same word that same revelation that was preached by the early church that unfolding of election and on and on that we could go and hear a new crus the promise is when the enemy would come in like a flood that the Spirit of God would raise a standard up against the enemy bring me a new cruise and put salt in there not old theological ideas you see that's why the admonition from the Holy Ghost through the prophet in the message rapture would say you cannot bring that old leaven over here and try to mix it with this message you've got to burn it with fire I don't care how good the old ideas seem those all ideas cannot be mixed with this it has got to be that fresh manna fresh revelation that's why this message it is the fresh inspiration from the throne of God that has come upon the Word of God amen it's to bring life to our lives amen that's what it's become its life to you and I and they brought it to him and he went forth the Bible says in verse 21 he went forth unto the spring of the waters and he cast the salt in there and he said thus saith the Lord I've healed these waters and there shall not be from fence any more death or barren land so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of Elijah which he spake notice they let him oh the city it looks good it looks good but it's barren the water is the problem in Liza so Ashley calls for that new cruise and one fill it was salt but it lets them know we're not just going to deal with the problems we're seeing right now you take me to the source of the problem take me to the spring of the problem yet you see remember it was here the crus of salt but remember the crus of salt was only a symbol that represented of what God was doing back his word for Alaska said that's safer Lord these waters shall be healed that cruces alt was only a symbol of the of the effect of the word striking those waters let me tell you something waters it can symbolize the Spirit of God and yet waters themselves symbolize the thickness and multitudes of people you and I were in this generation here we were among the thickness and multitudes of people Amen there is that spirit of the great that was setting upon the fitness and multitudes of people that religion sending up over our lives I'm talking about the devil's religion where he says you can be a good Christian all you gotta do is confess Jesus as your Savior you just gotta go to church you don't matter how you live what is it it's a power that's trying to keep the people under bondage but God in this generation he has poured himself out upon the waters and there is a people who have within them the seed of Almighty God that received that touch in the very source of their soul we are no longer a parent people without fruit but life has come to us it is the life of God's Word I am the lord that heal Assyria Amen Jehovah Rapha to our lives he has been poured out upon our lives both I can only stop this let him pour out upon the source of your life you'll never be able to stop Bilson if I can quit this and I can quit but you said Lord pour in the salt into my life Lord let the word go to the lead me to the spring of these waters I don't you understand what I'm saying it's not just about I want rid of this habit or I want rid of this no it gotta go deeper take me to the spring of those waters and the word reaches its mark in our life it changes our life from a life of bitterness it changes it to the sweetness by the presence of Almighty God that's the effect of the word of the Lord in our lives hallelujah Oh glory be to God to think of God's unfailing mercy divine healing here was present and the Lord was showing here even to Israel he was showing that the healing of the body they would receive healing of the body and that healing of the body right in the Old Testament healing was always apart and he told him I'm the Lord that healeth thee this healing of the body was only a witness think about it when nothing could turn around in the body you might just think about a common cold and you might just think well my headache ER or this you know it's just going to get better you know that's faith but do you realize that it is the Lord that moves on our behalf I have often wondered that even the atheists and the infidel their own body is a testimony against them you can put penicillin on a cut if a man is dead that penicillin will never heal that cut why because life is the healer life must be present in that body is that right you could baptize them in penicillin it'll never turn him around but that healing of the body was only God's showing I'm gonna bring a healing to the soul and when I bring a healing to the soul that healing of the soul will lead to the healing of the body a man which will lead to the redemption of the body Oh Matt don't you love the Lord oh my this is what David would say familiar scripture in Psalms 103 oh my just in prayer this afternoon and it just struck me just as I was praying and the scripture come across my heart where David said bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name how many of you know that soul is the real gift of God here taken the quickening power of God even though that soul is the real gift of God but you and I could not bring ourselves into birth but it took Almighty God to bring his children in to birth that seed was lack of the egg but his life coming into that seed is a quickening power it brings forth a son and daughter of God it is that it's only sons and daughters of God or only bread backed by the Holy Ghost coming through the word it brings about a new creation and a change in the life we were sitting that's why man drinks that's why man loves that's why man goes after all those other things or whomever it's because they're sick they need a remedy they need a remedy they might go for a little bit and well I'm doing pretty good now and I'm doing pretty good that that's all wonderful but to realize for your soul you don't have to live in a temporary victory you can have a victory that lasts 24 hours a day seven days a week you can live in the holiest of holy in the innermost place Amen where your life bears the fruit of Jesus Christ that is prophesied within this hour your I cannot bear that fruit but in his presence what is US comes out he brings it out whoa hallelujah bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul David ain't repeating he ain't stirring he's making a statement here bless the Lord O my soul brother send your mock body don't feel like it he didn't say bless the Lord my body he said bless the Lord O my soul him I let the soul step up and say body shut up you are here for me not me for you you might receive benefits where you get weak and by the grace of God healing is brought to your life come on now bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits and it wonderful to remember his benefits hallelujah you might say I know that he is a healer gets sick again and then it comes to you you don't forget his benefits you look at that situation and say lord I need a brand new touch hallelujah God are unfolding a testimony after testimony verse 3 who forgiveth notice how the Lord brings us together who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases I'll just make it very simple I think of how FF boswer took this scripture brother Branham coming you know right around but if they're buzzwords were to take this and challenge people when when the healing was was being ministered he said if you can find that there is someone iniquity that he has not taken then there could be a sickness that he has not atone for but if he sealed and delivered you of all iniquities and that's the promise of his word then it also stands that he's the Lord that he lets all line diseases you can't have one without the other hallelujah Oh bless the Lord O my soul whoo if my feet could only match how my soul feels right now hallelujah third John chapter 1 verse 2 they love it look at this this is not just John this is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving through John beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health not just that you might be healed but being health brother man will come right around and say he said Satan is after your health he said that God desires you would be in health not just be healed but being health that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as to what extent even as that soul prospereth glory be to God brother Brownwood sent like this and the sudden secret going away of the church you said it's better to be ready I'd rather be a sick man ready with the Lord than to be a well man not ready to go with the Lord but however it be God is so willing that we be both well and ready soul and body for he forgives all of our iniquities and heals all our diseases he died for a compound purpose 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 24 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed but we were as sheep going astray but are now returned under the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls brother Brown would go to say said if God delivered you from sin how much more will he deliver you from sickness you see look reasoning is not bad when it's with God's Word as they are said by the Spirit of God come let us reason together here he is remember look Jesus he would he would call try to stir up the reasoning of the Pharisees remember reasoning is the gate of judgment right God never took away those gates in our life but like Nehemiah he restored them to their rightful position and working that's sure to keep certain things at bay right bars doors locks upon every gate except the Sheep gate you're to always let Jesus in are you with me he's always been a should always be freely to come in and move in our lives is that right well I don't have time for that but you understand think you may understand that very clearly in our lives of how better that that would be God had delivered us from sin to think about it the same God that delivered from the hole of sin and from where our hearts desire and beat out to be pleasing unto the Lord sin has lost its hold let me tell you if you can take that witness you know brother just wearing somebody else's testimony that's your testimony that you can stand on the word and say the same God that delivered me from sin is the same God to deliver me from sickness you see you've got the word of the Lord present in your hand Oh glorious almost forgot him sick he's able to take oh my he's able to take and change your nature and make you a new person why would you fear about any sickness if he can save your soul and change your nature change your motives change your ideas how much more can he change your sickness into hell and put it back in its right place again where it belongs holder and over how glod right here we don't have to go outside of this assembly where God has manifested divine healing right here and we don't have to go way back in history either there said sister Rita states for cancer completely healed who did that and the Lord that he loved thee the many other testimonies that could be gone through it Scott you know what it is it's God letting you and I know my presence has not departed I'm still the cloud of my word let me put it to you just a simple brother mom said he has to recognize the presence of God he said you can receive your healing in a cornfield just as much as you can in a church you recognize what this message came for you and I and the presence of God that's what Paul said when I'm gone and the services commenced that your faith would not rest in the enticing words of man's wisdom but would rest in your faith would rest in the power of God that when Satan would rear his ugly head you might be in your kitchen you might be in a hospital you might be in a Walmart or wherever it's at but when it can rear its head you've got a promise of a living God I'm the Lord that healeth thee and that flutter ation was to start I'm the Lord that he loved thee hallelujah glory be to God the same goddess Jehovah Jireh is Jehovah Rapha he's Jehovah Cheryl glory hallelujah oh my and to think of it how brother Branagh would bring it around and God of this evil age I love this he says I'm pray I pray Lord that she would heal them Lord but for the greatest of all healing if you heal their physical body from cancer I want you to listen this state now I know we know this if you heal their physical body from cancer TB and pneumonia something they'll get sick again no doubt how many times are living just pause here don't keep ringing on how many times we've seen people be healed and they want God to heal them but they don't want to surrender their life you know what I'm tired of going through life this way he don't work that way I've heard but now I see the Prophet ties it back into motive and objective he said you want God to heal you why do you want God to heal you why do you want he said so that you can go on and live the same life you've always left this cut things aren't it calls us to think sometimes we can be so interested in lifting a sickness that actually it would cause a person you might say they've been going like this for years but it might come to a family down to a place that they recognize there's a greater sickness that's in their soul that they need healed off I don't want to see nobody sick I'll be honest with you I don't I don't like sickness I'm not just talking about for myself I don't like seeing other people sick and that's just the truth how do lack seein people sick I thank God like brother BAM would say thank God for every doctor from all the surgeons from all the medicines there it's just God's gift to the people thank God for all of that but to think of this here that can be healed of cancer TB pneumonia but they'll get sick again if they live long enough for their body is still under sin the curse but you let them get the real divine healing the healing of the soul which makes a new creature it passes from death unto life and then waiting in this old Tabernacle somebody say this old Tabernacle yeah that's right you may not a'right reach the ripe old age of 25 and yours has weeping on back down to the dirt but you're still waiting in this old tabernacle for the redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed the soul has been redeemed healing has come to the soul hallelujah and this old tabernacle experiences sickness this old tabernacle experiences wounds the Branham standing and the message standing in the gap he said I'd been cut so deep done many of my friends those were not wounds that you could put stitches on those were wounds inside of his spirit but he's still the Lord that healeth II he specializes in healings I said he's a wound care specialist he knows how to treat that wound get all the debris out of that wound he knows how to look at that and say nope we can't bandage it up right now no we can't cover that up because it'll canker it'll fester it it'll have an effect on your life we gotta clean all of that out but once he gets it all cleaned out then as Jehovah Rapha he can begin to pour in oil and wine he begins to pour in his word and his spirit and he binds up the brokenhearted all glory he takes a lot that is wounded that can say I could never entertain the thought I have been so long in my life but Jehovah right but could say I am the lord that he loved me he can take what looks like no way he can make away whether looks like no way he's Joe Bereta and beloved that he loved me nor would be the gardener was a man but the RAM would extract you know express this over and over and he would say that the basis of divine healing is not on the same level of salvation we know it requires faith for both but here was a man who was one desiring healing in his body and his body he wasn't getting better it was getting worse so was having understand understanding he'd begin to question he said well if I don't have faith for my healing and I don't see the healing coming but maybe I don't got enough faith for my salvation either brother branham cat catches him as he is saying this and he let's see he lets the man know he lets him know that once you've been born again of the Spirit of God you can never die a man is satisfied for eternity this body can get sick come on now you know I'm talking to you the devil can play right on your mind I don't care how many times that God has come along and heals you you need a fresh experience and a fresh touch from Jehovah a flower sometimes a sickness or whatever can linger and can go on and it goes longer than what any other sickness has gone before that isn't that you're some weakling in Christ let me tell you something I can't deal with it tonight but everybody has given a measure of faith is to stand upon that word and like the Holy Spirit brought in and interjected or late for us last week be patient therefore after we've done the will of God be patient and stand with it when anything arises contrary to that word you stand upon that word and said this is contrary to the Word of God that's why brother Graham says cite and symptoms is faiths worst enemy don't entertain the symptoms don't entertain the sights don't google them rebuked that devil you're gonna feel your heart with something you might as well fill it with a promise of God's Word that job said I will wait to my chains comes I will wait on the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint teach me Lord teach me in order to wait [Music] hallelujah this body brother Branham would put it like this in that statement he said this body it gets sick weak and God helps us in heals us and we get sick again it's just temporarily until the journey is finished but salvation is permanent forever this guy he gets well feels better man I feel better this Thursday night didn't last Thursday I literally didn't know how in the world that I was going to even do anything last Thursday I feel a lot better and day by day I'm getting better it feels good to feel good but it's temporary you can be healed of pneumonia tonight and next week died with pneumonia they don't have nothing to do with your soul your soul is not a temporary fix your soul is a permanent heal a you were sick I was sick but we got an inoculation I don't believe in immunizations I do I do there's a sin epidemic on the loose and the church don't believe in that inoculations or immunizations either oh that's all wives tales you don't need those immunizations we need the immunization of the Holy Ghost amen the Word of God coming to bring a divine inoculation that lifts us above the sin question hey man he don't do a temporary fix you find that man or he might be he might be within as far in his body and his mind sometimes he gets worried but that soul is dwelling in the Shekinah of God your body sometimes you say ma I can't give wait till I get back to work and you know go to church I'm feeling a little sick and you know I can't wait till I get bored where my mind and I can pray you know like I used to pray but you know that's only temporary but that soul once it has passed from death unto life there's no more going back Paul would call this of what weird welling in in Romans eight he would call it this bondage of corruption this corruption good as we try to do and everything else it keeps going downhill whenever hand a lot of amens on that one but it's a truth if bondage of corrupt notice bondage of corruption but your souls already been set free your soul has already been set free and soon and very soon we are going to receive a body that matches the work of the soul hallelujah glory be to God I feel like preaching right now but I can't go no more the whole creation is groaning and travailing not only are they groaning it's for their look at all these earthquakes earthquakes in divers places you know if the earth the earth is groaning you know the earth the world the world is the system upon the earth the earth is longing for her vesture to be changed come on she's already received her water baptism the black has come down upon it she's waiting for that fire baptism that other part of sanctification to we're set up on this earth in that of the millennium and then into the future home she's longing for the manifestation of the sons of God glory be to God and the same thing as Paul said same thing with you and I that's received the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts there is a longing there's a longing why because there is the evidence there is a land beyond the river the evidence of the Holy Ghost the love of God has moved into our heart it is an evidence there is a land beyond the river and God permits you and I to get sick here and there in this situation to come up and this to rise why to declare to you and I that there is coming a redemption of the body when you feel bad and yet here he comes and he gives you strength he lifts you as you hold of a rifle he's lettin you know get ready there's a healing coming Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his means soon and very soon we're gonna see the king hallelujah this body is still under sin the body is but our souls already been redeemed Satan can come and try to flex his muscles on our body but remember you can't do nothing to you first get permission from Daddy may we be like Joel but Jill wasn't Joel chapter 1 when the affliction came the Bible says Jobe worshiped the Lord and then he said the Lord helped me to worship let me tell you I just tried to stop there tonight let me tell you how powerful worship is my life was dealing with the situation one night we couldn't get that we couldn't get the pain to subside now you say brother Sammy you don't believe in gonna Hospital no I believe him in the hospital I believe if you got a headache take an aspirin and go take a look you ain't proven nothing to nobody I don't mean to go on now on that tangent but I'm just telling you ain't proven nothing to nobody we've been delivered over that tradition of man come on now that even under Pride and this is your pastor talking now it ain't nothing but pride you know brother branham got criticized by a woman dis man preaching divine healing he runs his kids to the doctor when they get sick duh and ain't the medicine that heals the kids God's the healer somehow her faith was shaken within that's God that healed if you read your Bible you'll also find that God spoke healing through the mouth of Isaiah and he said go put figs and you'll recover that boil it wasn't the figs it was the word of the Lord I love when you get the devil in the corner you just work him over like a male press not me but the Spirit of God cuz you know why it's rise to take Liberty from God's children that's what it is and that's why listen friends I've met many people then they can make a statement you know people say well my faith keeps sickness from me my faith C keep sickness from it you ain't got nothing no different than anybody else but when it comes down to when sickness comes your way is to recognize that you ain't failed God but it's to recognize God there is permission from God to afflict your body come on somebody a man but to think how worship let me get back to this point with worship how powerful worship is my wife was riffing they're in pain I'm praying for she said go get me a ham go get me a songbook okay she took that songbook and she started reading the songs in it not singing them read them and she began to praise the Lord let me tell you what happened that pain went away he's the same Jehovah Rapha for every one of our situations you may not say others say no I don't feel like I got a song right now I don't feel like I can sing a song right now maybe you just got to get back in Zion but before you can get back inside Stratton rehearsing the promises of Zion amen strike rehearsing the promises and let him come and minister healing to your life he's still Jehovah Rapha tonight amen you love him let's bow our heads father thank you for your mercy oh dear God your mercies are new every morning great is thy faithfulness Lord for here gathered around tonight those that are here those that be listening Lord by way of the internet were archiving Lord father let there not be one the Lord would just live of anything temporary healing in our body temporary Lord that would get sick again let there not be one Lord under the sound of my

I shall be saved granite Lord may you come Lord and heal that soul tonight Lord one that's here wound and their life may be beyond it's not something on the outside there's no antibiotic there's no

can't get beyond this Lord may they let you come tonight clear out any debris feelings a lot of things maybe there could be justifiable but would be would you just rely let me think invite you tonight

Lourdes I'm the Lord that healeth II [Music] Granite Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Satan you're defeated you've been stripped of all your power and authority as sons and daughters of God we

that have been inherited through our natural family tree we will not just be young men and women again but we will be changed [Music] Oh Lord Jesus may there not be one Lord under the sound of my voice that would miss it may if there's anything they've got ahold of right now that would seemingly look like life or seemingly you look like pleasure maybe it quickly cast that aside and realize
