and we're gonna receive from his word this time amen I believe it god Bless You Saints sure good to be with you again it's been a little while and just appreciate the opportunity and the invitation from by the Samuel to be here and sure think a lot of my brother respect him very much he's a fruitful man a man a fruitful man and you're really blessed here they have such a man as your pastor yeah amen we just appreciate him thank you for the warm welcome this morning the brothers that made me feel at home this morning I just appreciate that very much and and just feel comfortable this morning to go right into the word amen excited for what the Lord has for us this morning it turns with me to Psalms 139 if you would and I have a little thought of my heart this morning that's I've been on lately simple little thought on eternity Amen not that eternity is something simple Amen but but we just want to administer a few thoughts along the lines of eternity this morning eternal life Psalms 139 and I believe we'll just start the first verse here and this this Scripture is dealing with election amen I love this beautiful has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising now understand this my thought afar off thou Compass's my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o Lord thou knowest it all together thou has beset me behind him before and has laid thy hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it but whither shall I go for my presence hallelujah from my spirit or whither shall I flee from thy presence if I send up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me come down to the fifteenth verse my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them amen turn with me also to revelations 21 we've read a chapter on election I want to read one on predestination amen we want to read about a future home that's waiting for us revelations 21 one through seven and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God you know that in this chapter here is all the heart desire of God is revealed here amen from the very beginning the Prophet said he desired in love family of his own he desired fellowship with his children amen and now we find the mind of God in the plan of God the perfect will of God is to bring about this future home amen where he'll be our God and we'll be his children amen and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end amen I will give unto him that his thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he will be my son amen aren't you glad for that let's just pray Heavenly Father knowing that we're not feeding on a dead letter Lord or philosophies of men but Lord it's the body word of the son of man father that's still speaking in our myths Lord though the body of our prophet even the body of our Messiah Lord doesn't walk the earth with us today but the same word Lord a man is tabernacled itself in this little bride Lord raised up gifts and callings and anointings Lord to minister to us father so lord whatever we have on our heart this morning Lord whatever the need of the people would be father and me myself Lord the needs on my heart Lord the needs in our in our Assembly father Lord I'm raising them to You Lord trusting father that something could be said this morning Lord that your Holy Spirit would so have control over the service Lord that you would say exactly what you want to say father Lord and that your will would be done here in our midst father Lord and we sacrifice to you now everything that would hinder that Lord every idea every opinion every agenda Lord every funny feeling Lord every discomfort lord or whatever would be on our minds Lord we've surrendered that to you father asking your Holy Spirit to take control of this service as we dedicate it to you now in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen amen god bless you may be seated and then once again it's just good to be with you we bring you greetings from the assembly there and Bluffton and and and which my wife and our new little baby could have been with me this morning but I'm sad to report that they stayed home so amen I'll just have to do amen but if you didn't know God has blessed us with our first little baby a little baby girl and and we're just real thankful for that amen but we're on this subject of eternity amen and and we know the Prophet talked a lot about about eternal life the eternal life that we have as children of God and eternity we know means that never had a beginning and it had an end amen it's something beyond our understanding it's something we really can't grasp is this notion or this idea of eternity amen and yet I like to think about it a lot about what was back there before the foundation of the world because you know we get too caught up in the happenings of the world around us the condition of the world and we look at its politics and its Wars and its diplomacy and and and just the great histories being written around us even before our eyes prophecies being fulfilled and everything happening around us and to us it's such a grand thing in a such a grand order of this earth and amen so many machinations so many workings of this world and and and and it to us it's so significant because we're living in this time to us everything has such a great meaning and such a great importance a man but you know you could roll it all back before there was a human being on the face of the planet amen and you can roll it back even further before there was a world and before even there was a son amen before there was light or matter before existence before the very creation in the world he could roll it back and back and keep rolling it back eternity through eternity back to the very beginning amen amen before there was an atom there would be nothing there for you to find and yet God was there amen amen where did he come from we don't know amen how how could he be we don't know we can't understand that amen Oh what was he thinking about there brother sister by the grace of God we have an insight we know what he was thinking about because the love of God amen has made available to us a revelation Amen that before the very foundation of the world back way back rolling into the mystery of eternity amen God was thinking about you and I amen our large a hobo Elohim before he was a god Amen he was thinking about his children amen there were thoughts in his mind and brother sister if you were in his mind before the foundation of the world we've had a prophet declare to us that you are just as eternal as God is eternal because every thought of God is he a man if a men it never had a beginning it could never have an end because it's just a much a part of him a man has anything else hallelujah amen but you find back their God alone with his thoughts and I just love to contemplate it I love to think about it how how that he always was and how he always will be and what a great mystery of that great Godhead amen amen and and and there was eternity in an eternity amen and and and but God was not content to remain alone with his thoughts he was not content amen but amen he had a desire it is hard to see those thoughts be expressed in a way Amen to where it could be experienced till it wasn't just a mystery up in his mind but it could be tangible it could be it can have a reality to it Amen it was God's desire hallelujah you know you talk about the love of God every Amen every little breeze that comes across our face every time we feel this earth beneath our heels amen every time we look out in his face and see the stars and the the grid lights and constellation everything amen at one time was a mystery in the mind of God Amen but Godstow desiring to have his thoughts Express Amen he stepped out one day a man he stepped out of eternity into a little body called time and he said let there be light let there be a man and there was nobody there there were no there was no Board of Directors there was no there was no group of scientists there was nobody that he had to run his opinion by and amen and get clearance he didn't have to go to the city architect Amen - Amen to get approval for his plans but God was along with his thoughts and then he believed his own word amen amen when he expressed his thoughts he believed it and it took farm amen how perfect is the word of God expressed all of creation all of time brother sister all that it is is a testing ground for God's thoughts to be manifested and expressed amen this time that we're living in it's just a testing ground for God's thoughts amen to bring out the right attributes to bring the right character to bring everything into the right order into the right shape amen amen and that's what our lives is brother Graham said in Christ the mystery said the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to people and he couldn't do it as a great Hova God who covered all of space and time and eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to people amen because it would be too mysterious John told us Addie said no man has seen the father at any time no man has seen the father at any time hallelujah amen no man escena he said how could that great being that never did begin and after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and out on into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all of that and he still is but what he wanted to do oh my he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man Holly just a think breath sister way back before all of matter exploded into existence and it scattered light out into space way back in the quietness of God's mind he was thinking about you he was thinking about his children he was thinking about you and his desire was to be a father to you to draw you to him self amen oh my he desired in love a family of his own amen in the church age his program said so when Adam was formed of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being was created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed and those eternal thoughts were now manifested and he said now down through the centuries we could go and we find a Moses we find a Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of those was God's eternal thought expressed into its season amen every every bit of it every bit of Revelation that's been poured out through history was in God's mind in the beginning but piece by piece he is he has made it available to us he has become something we can understand he's become a being that we can touch and we can have fellowship with a man where once he was a mystery hallelujah a man once she was a great Godhead up there somewhere Amen out in some existence that we could not even comprehend in our mortal minds hallelujah but it was not his desire to be unavailable to his children anybody had a love for his family I'm in the closet self-deport himself in the history any poor prophet after prophet out and messenger after messenger to make himself known to you and I revealed himself to us what is that Sun man ministry it takes the mystery of God and it makes it plain to us it expresses the word then what is he Express to his bride is nothing but mercy Grace and love judgment but he has come and he's pitched his tent with us to have fellowship with us to be our friend and our Father and our Savior Oh glory to God no wonder no wonder John a man looking into the Old Testament no wonder he got so excited he said no man has seen the father at any time he's a mystery to us we can't understand him hallelujah but he said the word became flesh we're able to look upon him hallelujah where once he was a mystery now we could see clearly honey we could have fellowship with our Savior praise God Oh what condescension amen and brother I said that was Jesus he was the logos or the word amen the expression amen he was the perfect and complete thought expressed the fullness of a godhead in a body amen amen and and he became known as the word and that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he hath chosen us in him Jesus amen he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and he said that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and that gives an eternal quality to the elect and you can't get away from that hallelujah Amen you can't get away from that you ought to tell the devil that this morning then you want to notify the devil this morning you know Romans 9 it said that what's gone brother our messenger Paul he said what if God willing to show his wrath will choose out of the same clay he'd make one vessel to dishonor and another one to honor out of the same clay ain't been no merit to the clay but he chose a certain a certain portion of clay and he decided to make it a vest of the rack or a vessel of Mercy and it was his election decision Amen Appel said what what if what if God amen you know we would say that a little bit different in our modern English we would say so what how you know the devil likes to come sometime and say why do you why would you think God I would ever choose you Amen with all of your failures and your mistakes and your past and your history Amen how could you believe that God would choose you amen amen with all these things well what about it so what Amen God hallelujah it is God that justifier Amen Oh amen Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated so what Amen aren't you glad for his election how the Umbrella have said that stormy skies are no signs of god's disapproval Amen but he said that his proof or his love for us is because he told us he loved us amen and he proved it by election it was an elective love it was not based on your merit it was not based on your life it was not based on your successes hey man right in the church age book brother branham made a plane to us than many people today they'd like to get rid of that book because of that paragraph right there that's what makes me keep it in amen hallelujah he chose us in him before the foundation of the world before there was time a man he chose each of his children hallelujah eternal quality you can't get away from it can't get away from a brother sister you might as well stop arguing with God you might as well stop complaining about your failures and your weaknesses and your inability God is the one who did the choosing Amen what right do you have Paul said who aren't that old man to question God who had a question is choosing and the church a drug brother Graham said that if it was the grace of God to elect one they meant it for his mercy and one for his wrath and he said if that's God's sovereign will then we who are we to argue who are you brother sister amen Oh am i we ought not to disrespect the grace of God like we do many times you ought to talk better about God's choosing even if it's you amen even if you're talking about yourself Amen you ought to have a respect for God's grace amen just like you have to respect your brother amen you might not like him you might not enjoy their company but God chose him he men and he puts you in that family amen amen and God chose you brother sister he elected you he chose you before the foundation of the world amen you ought to accept it this morning Amen you'll feel better you'll smile more power yeah but you know we're just thinking too much in our temporary terms think too too much in terms of time and what's going on down here amen but what we're not doing amen is looking back before the foundation of the world where he chose us amen amen like the man said we're not natural beings having a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having a natural experience to bring out the right qualities to bring out the right character in attributes amen and every child of God to make the picture perfect amen Oh hallelujah it's all the work of grace amen the baptized of the Holy Spirit program said did not Jesus tell them that they were with him before the foundation of the world but he said what it is your minds are blackened and dark to those things and he said we all are our minds are blackened and dark but he said I just love this we're not just some little coincidence happening here we are sons and daughters of God in the beginning of the creation of God and we have been dropped down here for a witness now watch now what are we here to witness he said we've been dropped down here for a witness to witness the grace of God that shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost we have an eternal spirit and he said no one and there's not a way to stop it God's church will be there just as sure as it can be sure but in a man before all the workings of this world began you were in his mind and he's not gonna let you slip away brother sister if he's chosen you he's predestinated you one cool brother Brad said that election it took care of all of your past all of your past all of your background where you came from the election took care of all of it and he said predestination as taking care of your future suspended between election and predestination fear not little flock amen fear not hallelujah the Word of God will not return void but watch now we have been we have been chosen as a witness of the grace of God you're not a vessel of Wrath brother brother sister you are a vessel of mercy you have been chosen to witness mercy you've been chosen to to experience mercy he's chosen you to failure with his mercy amen now there are children of this world chosen to receive his wrath and brother Graham said it or Paul said that it pleased God to make his wrath shown because he is a god of Wrath there's such a thing brother sister as sinners in hands of an angry god but the bride of Jesus Christ amen has not been called to receive wrath but she is totally a vessel of mercy chosen you to be a vessel of mercy no wonder after failure after failure amen a mistake after mistake no wonder you were not able to send away the grace of God why because of his election he chose you was a vessel of mercy that's what you are here to witness is His grace his mercy Amen do you believe that if your child of God that's absolutely right amen a vessel of mercy all my message people so many times they get feeding on the wrong they get feeding on the wrong angle of this message and they they fill themselves up with wrath until they don't pour anything out but wrath and judgment you know you hear people around this message talk almost like well this world I just can't wait for it to burn I just can't wait for just a little bit brother sister but you know what you've fallen short of the full revelation of what the Bride of Christ is the brother Graham said that the ministry of the bride matches the ministry of the bridegroom which is a ministry of redemption it's a ministry not a mystery of judgment now but a ministry of redemption amen what is the voice that has been committed to the bride today let him that his thirsty come Musa whether we'll let him come just come just this taste of his water amen we're not preaching a message of judgment we've had a prophet to do that amen now every time God declares his word over the earth hallelujah brother sister amen to the world this message was an indictment but to the bride it's Shalom amen it's Shalom brother sister peace be on to you hallelujah oh my he believed that too many times we give our tongues over to criticisms and to discourage men and Saul the seeds of negativity that's not what the bride of Jesus Christ was placed on the earth to be he said that he said that we would be the voice of God amen under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age a matter what that voice is calling you won't find a scripture in the Bible amen that puts up any other voice in the voice of the bride than mercy and let him come a man before the world burns let's find that final seed let's pull somebody to Christ oh my then to think of the people that were rubbing shoulders with in this world you know that your co-workers are your schoolmates or your friend or your neighbor amen if they die and go to a devil's hell let him go there having experienced the low a man we look to this world to be what we were created and called to be vessels of mercy amen fill up with mercy and overflowing with mercy for humankind value a peace on earth and goodwill toward man his mercy brother sister Oh hallelujah oh my you can't put this bride under a reproach you can't we're in a bride age brother sister we've come into a bride age hallelujah people want to put the bride under a layout of see in spirit she's not under than they oughta see on you miss bride is not naked she's not wretched or miserable she's not poor or blind with a sister she's a man blood wash spirit-filled hallelujah what a message what a message think of it as brother sister our eagle eyes we see too well sometimes because we've been given vision amen know that you know an eagle is a warlike bird and we've been given such a vision too you could take this message you anybody anybody could set a year under this message and take a take the co let's take the scripture and tear somebody apart Amen how would you want to somebody take this message and go line by line and judge your life Amen they could you could tear something you could tear somebody apart with this message but if you want to you could build them up amen you could build them up how they lead and that's what we've been called to do the end time evangelism is to build the bride it's to build her up brother sister you know when we get close to when the masterpiece is complete it's a lot less of a hammer and a little bit more of the chisel oh we're not here to tear people down we're not here to just to take the rug out for money a brother sister you're the bride of Jesus Christ amen any true ministry is here to to minister to you to serve you to encourage you amen to help you along because of who you are brother sister oh if we only knew who we are hallelujah we believe in correction but but you know some people build their whole ministry on just tearing and amen and pulling and smashing amen but I want to build for his kingdom I want to build somebody up I want to encourage somebody I want to empower somebody hallelujah amen where were we the Word of God will not return void it will not return void brother sister amen and if you were a thought of God now you've been expressed into time now you were the Word of God a spoken word of God that's what every child of God is if you were with him in the beginning hallelujah then today you're his word expressed Adam was a thought in the mind of God but when God breathed that body amen and brought him into creation he became the word he became a spoken word son of God amen amen and then that spoken word was no longer just a mystery but he could walk the earth and eat the fruit feel the breeze a man and dig his toes into the sand and enjoy God's creation it was God's will amen for that spoken word to come into a body amen and and and be expressed and and that's why I Paul said you are written epistles your written epistles now not written with ink amen you're not written with ink you weren't written in a Sunday school or a seminar somewhere for the sister now the book your life was not written there but you've been written the Bible says by the Holy Spirit upon your fleshly tables of your heart you have been written you see expressed you were a thought in his mind but today you've been expressed or written epistle read of all men and brother Ram took that in the unveiling of God and it's so powerful he said I translate he said I turned it around this way I'll just paraphrase here I turn it around he said your epistles that have been written in other words hallelujah amen it's the manifested Word of God you're the manifest Word of God and you can't add to it and you can't take away from the manifested Word of God don't you know brother sister that the devil would like to to add so many footnotes to the book of your life because he's been watching your mistakes and your failures and he's got all kinds of material he wants to add in there but because you're the spoken word of God because you're a seed child of God [Applause] to the book C of God that eternal quality that you can't get away from no matter what you do Hey many times we brother instantly backslide every day we get out that permissive will but he said something about the permissive will of God he said it always comes back to land for you but the perfect will of God will be done security oh my the manifested Word of God you can't add to it you can't take away from it in other words every elected child of God is just as infallible and divinely inspired as this Bible you are eternally inscribed on the Lamb's Book of Life only my father has given me amen no man shall pluck them out of my hand no weapon formed against you shall prosper Oh glory to God glory to God barely barely I say to you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life he hasn't Amen and he shall not come into condemnation but he's passed from death unto life what shall we say to these things it is God that justify hey man you shall not come into condemnation hallelujah why do you condemn yourself brother sister why do you allow the devil to whisper in your ear oh my I'd rather take the Word of God than any feeling any complex any fear or any uncertainty any frailty of this this body in this flesh I'm not looking at that I'm looking at the word man hey man now every word of God if you're the word of God then you have a purpose you have a purpose you are indispensable to the economy of God you are not insignificant rogram said you're not some coincidence you're not some mistake but every child of God is important vital because without if God would have lose one of his thoughts he would no longer be God his perfection would be would be transgressed but he's not going to lose the one of them hey man the Alette cannot be deceived she cannot fail God's church will be there just as sure as it can be sure just as Shores there's a world brother branham would say and he would say you know then you can take this earth you could take the dirt of this earth and science thinking they can take it and they can break it down into little pieces but not one little piece can be destroyed not one atom not one little iota of matter can be destroyed they can break it down they could burn this building and turn into actions scattered all over this world until I never be assembled again but you can't destroy one bit of it because it's the spoke how much more a child a seed the offspring of Jehovah cannot be destroyed she cannot piss away you could do a place like Saul where Saul was Beck's lived is such a point where he was consoling witches and he went to witch and he caught up the prophet Samuel that's the power of God's anointing he's choosing praise God hey man I believe in that kind of a grace I believe in it I need it hey man I'm resting on it praise God amen now every word of God has a purpose it has a part to play every joint of this body supplies amen amen it's a there's a dispensation for you now now God dispenses his word how many know that there's a dispensation brother Brad talked about there was a dispensation of Mosaic law and then a little bit more was dispensed amen and John the Baptist's and a little bit more was dispensed under Christ more was dispensed under church organization than the outpouring see dismiss the dispensation after distance' God's dispensing his work now but he's not just dispensing a message he's also dispensing his word in the form of a people to receive the message and live the message just as sure as God sent you Elijah the prophet god spoke you into this world to receive the message that Elijah was preaching amen he chose you to live it he chose you to fulfill it brother sister even now how can we say oh I can't live it brother sister I just I don't have enough faith I can't believe while you're believing what the devil's telling you [Applause] hey man brother I said when it comes to the gathering together at the end of the dispensation it'll be waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in that desk and say what's this world groaning for for an adoption for a rapture for a bride to come to maturity a church to form God to form himself a temple and inhabit his people that's what the world is groaning for they're not groaning for a message they're not groaning for a tape now they're groaning for a little bit of faith for this rapture for this reed ench full redemption for this adoption every little bit of it lies on the on the message amen it lies in there but it wasn't meant to stay there because there's a people that have been dispensed into time seeds of God dispensed into bodies of time to receive this word and take a transformation oh yeah hey man something in my heart says that's me that's me I'm identified by that word hallelujah amen and it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that he might gather all together all that has been brought into Christ he does the gathering he does the gathering oh my you know Isis fell shipping some brothers recently about adoption and how so many people have such a wrong picture about it about adoption because we're looking for a maturity we're looking for a character and many people get an attitude about it like well if I could just try harder if I could just be better somehow put more effort you know you know what I'm talking about if I could be dude if we could have more works that's the attitude that people have but brother we're not building this thing God's gathering it together God's doing the gallery hey man hallelujah we've been gathered he said he's gathering it all together all brought into Christ and what is Christ and how do we get into him by one spirit we are all baptized into one body now are we the sons of God amen which is the body of Christ and we've been made partakers of every gift and good thing that he's got amen we're the word that has been dispensed into this age to witness the fullness of time you are the first generation since Adam to witness that eternity and even now time is blending into eternity amen we're in a bride age and we're still in a body type called time but we're just on the threshold to be oh my what could this world offer to match that glory to be that eternal people to step across that threshold and say death where is your sting hallelujah oh my all creation has been groaning waiting for you brother sister waiting for this word but not just waiting for a sermon they're not waiting just for a message but they're waiting for a people sons and daughters of God creation groans for you brother sister every earthquake every cataclysmic event every disaster it's the world groaning for you amen to just wake up and then quit arguing with the grace of God just accept who you are possession of every promise amen because say what the word says about you has Authority amen adoption is not an achievement brother sister it's a gathering God building it up what's happening is the word is gathering itself together ain't meant way back in the beginning Amen God stepped out from time into eternity and stepped out into the form of glorified body and amen oh I stepped out in that fee of onic form and he began to break himself up and and he splits out fear amen that it would come forth and it would it would reveal the Word of God in a way that we couldn't experience it and understand it amen but now it's gathering itself back together dark illusions because all the light of God is coming together it's coming together so the God's bride can shine Amen as the body of Christ amen see he was the Alpha but the bride is the Omega but in his bride it's the Omega that's same [Applause] the mystery of God revealed Alou yeah all it wasn't God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church hallelujah he's the beginning and he's the end hey man amen Oh hallelujah he planted himself he sowed his seed that's not just some Sunday School it image of oh you know we plant nice thoughts a nice little devotional studies and nice scriptures and we plant that in your life and it makes you a nice good person and a good Christian Noah brother sister you were the seed that was planted you your life your character your attributes don't look at this fallen nature look beyond that brother sister see that eternal quality see that eternal city [Music] coming more into the image of the original seed a man he's reaping the fruit of his own life and his bride he's the Alpha she's the Omega s that same eternal life in a different form hey man a different mask it's an morph a a man whoa a man to think how at the beginning of time that logos came forth and to express the mystery of God's mind and by the end of the dispensation of time the logos has expressed itself on or earth in the form of that spoken word bride oh and now we see what God had in mind you know you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family you can't deny it you can't argue with it God is build himself a family and it's perfect approval the Bible says we are accepted in that beloved we are accepted enough you might be rejected in this world but in that beloved body of Christ you're accepted [Applause] under condemnation you're passed from death unto life Oh hallelujah there's an eternal quality in that eternal realm amen to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne and I'll say Oh even as I overcame and I'm sat down with my father in Solem brother Bram said set with me in my throne not on my throne in my throne in other words not just some chair up in space but it's his domain he's caught us truth he said he's called us to rule him in his domain and he said now his domain amen it reaches just as far as the boundaries amen and this one is from eternity to eternity think of it we've been predestinated to join them in that eternity when we get through this testing place brother sister we're going to an eternal place that's beyond our power to comprehend Bob Paul said that the struggles are the the sufferings of this life are not worthy to be compared to the glory that's waiting for us hey man the trouble is is your finite minds amen they're trying to grasp an infinite God see this is not reality it's not reality there's a future home that's waiting for us a place that's more real than this the trouble is our mind say man oh you know there is a great man named Plato and he was a great intellectual father a Greek and in that time men had become so intelligent and and so learned and they were beginning to discover things about mathematics in the order of the universe and how perfect at its foundation this world is amen but you know you began to look around as a man Plato and look at the suffering look at the sickness look at the wars and the failures and weaknesses and heal okay he said this can't be right he said that there must be we must be living in some lower plane and there must be a place there must be a perfect place an ideal place amen uh beyond all this imperfection amen because we see that the universe has such an order has such a purpose even the intellectual man today knows that things aren't right man knows that he's fallen from some what drives a human being what drives a man to work and sweat and toil and try to carve out a legacy and and build and conquer what drives a man to do it he knows that he's supposed to rule he knows these father's from somewhere no he knows he's dispossessed hallelujah Amen that's and so he's grasping for some kind of immortality what would make a man want to be President I mean seriously you look at look at the pictures now when they start and they come out why would somebody want to go through that why would someone else talking about why would somebody want to do that you know why because that's the closest thing to immortality they will ever have 2,000 years ago a man named Augustus Caesar rule over a third of this planet and it was under his direct rule amen and this morning you got up and you didn't think about him sat there on you ate your cereal and that great Caesar never crossed your mind no no never cross your mind this morning and in another thousand years nobody will ever remember he ever existed amen it's sobering when you begin to think about it the world has a saying that you die twice the first time is when your body goes in the grave and the second time is when the last person speaks your name here we have no continuing City but we're pilgrims and strangers seeking a city to come there's nothing here worth working for worth fighting for there's nothing there worth living for down in this realm but there's an eternal quality that causes us to look to another Oh My we're desiring it amen but but the thing is it just we just can't comprehend where we've fallen from but something is something is is pulling us in that direction but we can't understand that you see could I give you a better object lesson this morning yeah I just want you your mind now I want you to draw a line okay and just a line a horizontal line and it's going that way and it hits the wall and there and it goes through the wall and it just keeps going and going infinitely into eternity and it never ends and the same thing on this side it goes on and on and on and it never ends it just goes infinitely into eternity a line it doesn't have ends a line segment has ends but a line has no way that's a dimension it's a dimension we'll give it a name we'll call it X a man I blew my cover now you didn't think you're getting a math lesson this morning all right hang with me now you'll be all right a man that's the dimension and it goes on you know and I can go anywhere in this dimension I can measure from here to here I can I can measure from this point to this point I could take a dimension there but I can never measure the whole of it because it never has an end it's infinite it goes on for eternity what how how wonderful amen it it just stretches our mind even think of it these finite minds to think of that infinite line amen it goes on and on but now I want to add a second dimension a vertical dimension K becomes through this horizontal dimension and now that I've added a vertical dimension I could go anywhere on this infinite now see for every for all of this infinity there's a whole nother infinity and it just boggles the mind how much infinitely greater that second dimension is from from that first dimension and yet we can understand it now you see it goes on like a big sheet of paper but it has no edge it just goes on and on and on can you see it now you can you can kind of understand that because you're a three-dimensional being and so you have some way of grasping those two dimensions but you know brother Brad said one time that God dwells in the seventh dimension [Music] it's huge amen but but how much greater is God than you and I often that mysterious seventh dimension beyond our power to understand and it's just like my big figure in there you know he can go to school [Music] what a ball is but what you can't see is a circle a man a man and you'll never understand me but the more that I project myself the more that I can I can reveal myself to him hey man and if I could just pull them out of that dimension he's walking the aisles but he projected himself into our dimension [Applause] himself and he made himself touchable to his children how wonderful in one day amen the walls of this time of these three dimensions will break open and we'll step over into that place where he is and we shall know even as we are known we shall no brother sister we shall see him face to face you can't comprehend something in a higher dimension unless it comes and passes through yours oh and God has projected himself and brother sister you've got a theophany somewhere it wasn't so far away is a place waiting for us and there's a theophany there and brother sister you say I can't see it I can't feel I can't even comprehend it but every now the man you'll be under the preaching of the word [Applause] you're destined to go to that place it's waiting for you the place is already prepared Oh glory to God glory to God aren't you glad that we got a body waiting for us oh man but he said no he said I went to that young and without suffering without sadness [Applause] [Applause] Oh hallelujah you're a triune being Amen hallelujah oh we get so worried many time well what it'll what will it be you know what will my dog be there and will it be this and what about my great uncle and and we you know what I believe real sister I cannot comprehend it but I know that whatever it takes for it to be heaven will be there I'm gonna be there amen that's all that I know yeah hallelujah oh my oh my it's more real than where we are now amen but the thing of it is you got to get out of the menthe this mindset stop looking at this world stop locate the weaknesses of the flesh don't look at this place it's temporary hey man it's just uh it's just a byway it's a little resting place we're just ambassadors coming through this misery think of that place amen and being an American being in Ohio in it don't even touch it that sense of belonging that sense of identity just like Paul said he said it's that Jerusalem which is above the mother of the free the mother of us all that's my city Oh Lord God amen you know I have some relatives that live in Israel another part of my family they live over there in Israel some of you know them probably from years back and they live over there and they've lived over there for a long time and they got under that nationalistic spirit and it's a strong one yeah let me tell you if you've never been there it's powerful it gets on you and you know every single one I'm some don't even live there anymore they weren't born there they don't even live there some of them are farmers out of Minnesota somewhere but how much more amen the blood of Jesus Christ his children his teeth how much more we ought to feel that belonging that identity to know that we came from that place and we're going back Oh glory to God back into that eternity we got to get into that mindset here we don't belong down here nothing down here is permanent nothing down here is worth amen giving it our all for amen but that in Jerusalem which is above that Jerusalem the New Jerusalem that's my city the mother of the free amen amen brother sister how long is eternity long enough long enough you might be sitting here this morning and you're going through the worst trial you've ever had in your life you got such a question on your heart you know or such a suffering something you're just going through the fire right now eternity is long enough to forget about it all those cares of life eternity is long enough to forget about you might have that question gnawing at your heart you're caught between two opinions just can't get settled eternity is long enough to find the answer now the louia eternity is long enough where if we could get in that eternal mindset we wouldn't have all these squabbles and fighting and we wouldn't have church splits and we wouldn't have brothers talking against brothers because we would understand that eternity is long enough to get over whatever little petty thing a man is has given us ought against our brother if we could break into that eternal mindset you'd look at these people around you you want to look at their flesh anymore you looking at [Music] Greece me how people are so free to talk about one another talk bad about one another don't you know that that this assembly is the very blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but it's mercy so great that Oh hallelujah many times we ought to be destroyed for the way we treat one another thank God for His grace but if you could look beyond this temporary these temporary bottoms the bodies and brother have said you could get into such a place you said you'd get in that place he said you know your brother he's done something he said I'll have to paraphrase the quote now you brother might do something against he said he's done you wrong he's you've got the there's no question your brother's done you wrong he said don't mention it it's not worth it eternity is long enough to get over it amen don't mention it he said don't landship I said what you do is you go to pray for that brother you again before the throne of God go in that place he said don't do it in such a way well I'm supposed to do this I was afraid no instead he said get into the presence of God and if you would just get into that eternal realm that eternal mind said he said then you would look at your brother and you begin to see how Satan's been working on him how how he's had this in his life to make him this away and you'll have compassion for your brother hey man get in that eternal mindset oh how could how could there be marriage trouble when you get the real revelation of whatever what a real husband a real wife is a man for the seat of God what I was looking for even what I needed but God knew exactly what a man any worked out every little the orchestra never a little bit every little string he brought it all together and I did know that your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather was escorted by angels so that he wouldn't come to a sudden end so that the seed line could not be broken his foreknowledge he knows all about it brother sister he knows all about your little marriage problems he gave that one to you anyway you might have said you made a mistake he didn't make a mistake amen and if you look beyond the the circumstances at this time you would realize that's your eternal mate in glory in that way he said it's your eternal mate in glory you know people come to such a place in this life where they perfect right it's beautiful I think it's awful romantic hey man I don't really do Amen to have that eternal mate Oh hallelujah wasn't no accident it was no coincidence some er weren't even serving the Lord when you met one another but look what God has wrought look at God's plan for your life before you're even serving him he gave you that right one Amen place them in your life brought you together in a perfect representation hallelujah there's an eternal quality to it brother hey man hey man Oh hallelujah how the you might feel like you've been deprived in this life of whatever it is you know maybe marriage didn't work out or maybe your family's falling apart or you never got to travel have money and have nice things and nice clothes and good experiences or eat good food or whatever you've never got to experience this world you never got to go out and see this place and and all of its beauties and all of its pleasures and whatever you've been deprived of brother sister you're not deprived you're not deprived farther along with know all about it oh there's a place waiting for you brother sister that this isn't even worthy to be compared to you're gonna have a thousand years on this earth just to stretch your line before you step into eternity farther along we'll know all about it he turning he's long enough run sister it's just long enough you're a boy when I was a little boy I was afraid of immortality I said I don't want to live forever I'll get bored you know but that's just this finite mind we're always afraid of what we can't understand but don't be afraid of this word brother sister Oh don't miss that place it's gonna be so wonderful but even now we're in heavenly places even right this instant we've been translated into that Kingdom but just a little bit longer down here in time brother sister just a little more suffering just a little more striving a little more work but you might be tired this morning and worn down but just a little longer look at my precious friends in this congregation I I hope I could go out to eat with every single one of you and talk to you and and be a friend to you but you know as soon or later we gotta part ways and oh it brings such a sorrow I think of that old song blessed be to tie the binds and when we asunder part it gives us inward pain Amen but all my will be joined again brother sister [Applause] [Music] you've been parted from a loved one and you feel that pain because they've been stripped from your life and and you feel that lack you feel that agony of having that person that you love and they're gone and you can't be with them anymore and you can't you can't hug them you can't talk to them but eternity is long enough brother-sister will forget that we ever parted Oh glory to God do you love him don't miss that place brother sister don't miss that place amen don't overlook that eternal quality don't waste it do something for Lord in this time build for his kingdom make the most of this little time here you might suffer a little bit but it'll be worth it all it'll be worth it all glory to God let's all stand I trust they haven't kept you for an eternity this morning attorneys long enough so you don't worry amen hallelujah hallelujah what shall we sing now let's sing that
