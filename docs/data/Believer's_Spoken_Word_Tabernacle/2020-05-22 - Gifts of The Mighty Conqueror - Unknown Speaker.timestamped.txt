[27:23] and that's something that we we don't
[27:25] know by what we've read
[27:27] we know it by experience that over and
[27:30] over
[27:31] not only has god fulfilled to every
[27:34] believer
[27:35] what we have longed for the thirst that
[27:38] was in our life that we tried to satisfy
[27:41] with a lot of other things of this life
[27:44] sometimes even trying to satisfy with
[27:46] trying to be a better person
[27:48] but it didn't satisfy it we could be
[27:50] even a better
[27:51] morally person but it didn't satisfy it
[27:55] it's because there's only one that can
[27:56] satisfy it it's not
[27:58] something we can do but it's the one
[28:00] that we can yield ourselves
[28:02] to and then he comes in and he
[28:05] he quenches satisfies
[28:08] that thirst the satisfying of it it
[28:11] doesn't mean that we're never thirsty
[28:12] again
[28:13] it's just our thirst has been satisfied
[28:16] that we no longer
[28:18] are searching we have found the fountain
[28:20] of life
[28:22] we have found him that is the desire of
[28:25] all of our life
[28:27] so there is a thirst within our hearts
[28:29] we want more of
[28:30] him amen it's him
[28:33] that we love amen so glad to be in the
[28:37] house of the lord tonight good to be

[28:46] have
[28:46] have with that one purpose to know that
[28:49] god
[28:49] is mindful of our need he's not
[28:52] restricted by barriers
[28:54] he's not contained within a building of
[28:57] walls

[31:50] like to stand with me
[31:52] let's go to ephesians chapter four and i
[31:54] just want to
[31:56] just for the sake of time just to move
[31:58] right in here tonight
[32:01] from where we were drawing from last
[32:03] week
[32:04] and just seeing the the body of jesus
[32:08] christ
[32:09] and just looking upon this here in the
[32:12] scripture i want to begin reading in
[32:14] verse 4
[32:15] of ephesians 4 here tonight
[32:18] and the scripture says there is one body
[32:22] and one spirit even as ye are called
[32:26] in the hope of your calling
[32:29] one lord one faith one baptism
[32:34] one god and father of all who is above
[32:37] all
[32:38] and through all and in you all but unto
[32:41] every one of us
[32:42] is given grace according to the measure
[32:46] of the gift of christ wherefore he
[32:50] saith when he ascendeth up on high
[32:54] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[32:57] unto men now that he ascended what is it
[33:00] but that he also descended first into
[33:02] the lower parts of the earth
[33:04] he that descended is the same also that
[33:07] ascended up far above all heavens
[33:11] that he might fill all things and he
[33:14] gave some
[33:15] apostles and some prophets and some
[33:18] evangelists
[33:19] and some pastors and teachers for the
[33:22] perfecting
[33:24] of the saints for the work
[33:27] of the ministry for the edifying
[33:30] of the body of christ till we all come
[33:33] in the unity of the faith
[33:36] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[33:37] unto a perfect man
[33:39] and to the measure of the stature of the
[33:42] fullness of christ
[33:44] that we henceforth would be no more
[33:46] children tossed to and fro
[33:47] and carried about with every wind of
[33:49] doctrine by the slight of men and
[33:51] cunning craftiness
[33:52] whereby they lay and lie and wait to
[33:55] deceive
[33:56] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[33:59] up
[34:00] into him in all things which is the head
[34:02] even
[34:03] christ from whom the whole body fitly
[34:06] joined together and compacted by that
[34:08] which
[34:08] every joint supplyeth according to the
[34:10] effectual working
[34:12] in the measure of every part maketh
[34:15] increase
[34:16] of the body unto the edifying of itself
[34:19] in love amen may god richly bless the
[34:23] word and bless you as you're being
[34:24] seated tonight
[34:28] just as i mentioned to you last week on
[34:32] last thursday these are things that
[34:36] uh you know sometimes where i'm looking
[34:39] at it as a pastor and i look across
[34:42] and there's sometimes you can see
[34:44] certain things that are our needs
[34:47] and as you're looking at it you can see
[34:50] there's times where there's a need to
[34:51] bring
[34:52] certain teaching and approach certain
[34:55] things
[34:56] and yet within that it's things that you
[34:59] always you have to wait on god and to
[35:02] know when would be the right time what's
[35:04] the right approach
[35:06] how do we move within this we are
[35:09] looking at
[35:10] at things that are within the word as we
[35:13] we're just looking at the thought and
[35:15] how god began to direct us here
[35:17] off of that and through that in the book
[35:20] of philippians and seeing how paul
[35:22] was admonishing the people of god those
[35:26] churches that were within philippi
[35:29] and remember the very first birth the
[35:31] very first verse he admonished
[35:33] uh those the bishops and deacons and it
[35:36] was plural because
[35:37] there are there was many churches
[35:41] in that region of philippi let alone
[35:44] many churches as it would be written
[35:46] the churches that are in asia there were
[35:48] many local churches but
[35:50] we understand that the lord jesus when
[35:53] he
[35:54] made a declaration the very first
[35:56] mention
[35:57] would be where he would declare that his
[36:00] church the one that he would claim
[36:02] for his very own it would be that
[36:05] of his church that would be built upon
[36:08] this rock which the rock is a revelation
[36:11] and that revelation
[36:13] is of who he is and
[36:16] to to recognize that with within this
[36:19] that
[36:20] that would be the foundation of the true
[36:22] church of the living god
[36:24] and when we when we read here within the
[36:27] scriptures there are
[36:29] many things that we can we can see
[36:32] and look at and many things that uh here
[36:35] within the scriptures you know
[36:37] i just say it like this a lot of it when
[36:39] i i look at it i
[36:41] sometimes we we hear the different
[36:43] thoughts of
[36:44] of apostles prophets teachers um
[36:47] evangelists and pastors and for
[36:49] for maybe for some it just all looks at
[36:52] it that well they're all just
[36:53] that's just all all preachers but every
[36:56] gift itself
[36:57] is uniquely placed by god it's to
[37:00] accomplish
[37:01] a purpose that he has in mind and so
[37:04] sometimes we find i find this
[37:06] that where many things are not
[37:08] understood there's things that's in
[37:10] that are not understood what apostle is
[37:13] what a prophet is
[37:14] um what what a pastor is uh what a
[37:18] what a an evangelist is what a teacher
[37:20] is and because of that
[37:22] misunderstanding sometimes this is where
[37:24] uh people can
[37:26] uh they they look at things and just
[37:28] think well just assume well it's just a
[37:29] preacher
[37:30] but yet in the midst of it god has so
[37:32] gifted
[37:33] a life that he he achieves
[37:37] a purpose through that life for his body
[37:41] it's not about the man the gift that was
[37:43] placed in the man
[37:45] it's not about the man any true gift
[37:47] that god has given
[37:49] it is never to highlight any man nor
[37:52] draw
[37:53] anybody to one's person and i'm talking
[37:55] about even in the nine spiritual gifts
[37:58] as well
[37:59] there is nothing that god has placed in
[38:01] the body
[38:02] that should elevate any man any flesh
[38:05] but every gift and i say it like this
[38:07] even that of a gift that would be
[38:10] to play music even a gift that is given
[38:13] to sing specials even a gift that is in
[38:16] all those parts it
[38:18] is to um it is to exalt the lord jesus
[38:21] christ let me just say it to you like
[38:23] this
[38:24] when all of those things as it says that
[38:26] all things ought to be done
[38:28] unto the edification of the body the
[38:31] edifying of the body
[38:32] is not building people up but it is
[38:35] exalting
[38:36] the lord jesus christ that revelation
[38:39] because it is him that settles the
[38:42] hearts of his children
[38:44] it's him that comes that causes any
[38:47] doubts to vanish it's him that coming on
[38:51] the scene
[38:51] that that actually is exalted it's him
[38:54] being ministered that brings healing
[38:57] it's him
[38:57] being exalted that that brings life to
[39:00] situations
[39:01] it's him being exalted that gives
[39:03] direction when we are
[39:05] between two opinions it's him that
[39:08] that we that needs to be exalted in our
[39:10] midst so
[39:11] i want to take here tonight and just
[39:13] begin to look at this as we
[39:15] started to look at that part that it is
[39:18] christ
[39:18] that assembled the body the body of
[39:21] jesus christ as
[39:22] as a whole from around the world just
[39:25] like you would see as a congregation
[39:27] many different ones that would come
[39:29] and stand here from other assemblies in
[39:31] the united states or
[39:33] from even from around the world
[39:35] different uh
[39:36] brethren that we have that come here
[39:38] from africa
[39:39] and some of the central american
[39:41] countries and other places
[39:43] they are all part as we are of the body
[39:46] of jesus christ
[39:48] and remember we we don't get into that
[39:50] body by membership
[39:52] we come into that body by spiritual
[39:55] birth it is christ himself that inducts
[39:58] us
[39:59] into his own body and his body
[40:02] is that which takes upon that of the
[40:05] feminine form a reflection
[40:07] of him of the man christ jesus so
[40:11] his church is him being reflected
[40:14] through his body it's that
[40:18] which is set for his glory so i want to
[40:20] just begin to take a little thought
[40:22] or to look at this tonight as we begin
[40:25] breaking that down and moving it down
[40:27] even till we come
[40:28] to every little part within a local body
[40:31] but i want to look at this
[40:32] on the gifts of the mighty conqueror
[40:35] because these
[40:36] gifts that we have just read about when
[40:39] we
[40:39] read this here in ephesians 4 there
[40:43] this speaks that these gifts that have
[40:45] been set forth
[40:46] there's because there's a work to be
[40:48] done
[40:50] there's a work to be done there's a
[40:52] purpose to be served and we read through
[40:54] some of them scriptures
[40:55] let me just put it how the prophet put
[40:57] it he said it was a man-sized
[40:59] job it was a god-sized
[41:02] job it was that which only god
[41:06] himself could fulfill there was not a
[41:08] man
[41:09] upon the earth that could redeem you and
[41:12] i
[41:13] but yet remember how the fall came by
[41:16] man
[41:17] then god himself took upon the form
[41:20] of man in order to manifest the
[41:23] attribute of savior and redeem you and i
[41:28] in other words he became kinsmen
[41:32] he became kin folks with us is that
[41:34] right
[41:35] he did that that he might pay the price
[41:38] and then send back
[41:39] his own life into the church
[41:43] of the living god so it would not be man
[41:46] carrying the message but it would be the
[41:49] same god
[41:50] who brought the message of redemption
[41:53] through the prophets announcing it
[41:55] foretelling it
[41:56] and then fulfilling it in christ is the
[41:59] same one
[42:00] that now moves through sons and
[42:03] daughters
[42:03] that have been born of that same spirit
[42:06] that their lives
[42:07] cry out that redemption has come
[42:11] their lives our witnesses are our
[42:14] testimonies
[42:15] within themselves that indeed redemption
[42:18] has come
[42:18] in other words we have been made
[42:20] co-partners in redemption with him
[42:22] because
[42:23] god as the prophet would tell us he does
[42:26] not do
[42:27] anything outside of man he always works
[42:29] through a man
[42:30] he had to use a man a man is what he had
[42:33] to use
[42:34] to display his attribute of savior think
[42:37] of it it was
[42:38] man who fell in the beginning but now
[42:40] god here he comes
[42:42] and he makes and prepares for himself a
[42:45] body
[42:46] that then through him by that he might
[42:48] project that
[42:49] attribute of savior and pay the price
[42:52] for you and i
[42:53] and this is why brother brown would say
[42:55] it like this he says he turns right back
[42:57] around
[42:58] and makes the man a partner to him and
[43:00] does
[43:01] nothing except he does it through a man
[43:05] i want you to think of this right here
[43:07] there's things just like when a fire
[43:08] gets started
[43:10] you don't start a fire with a big old
[43:12] chunk of log
[43:13] but there is something that you use that
[43:16] gets a fire started
[43:18] but once that fire is started then you
[43:20] start putting chunks of wood
[43:22] on there and let me just put it very
[43:23] clearly the fire that fell
[43:26] on the day of pentecost is that same
[43:28] original fire
[43:29] down through the ages man would get
[43:31] cooled off but god
[43:33] always had a way that that original fire
[43:36] would come back
[43:36] and then in every age there would be
[43:39] ministry
[43:40] that would be born of that same original
[43:43] fire
[43:44] carrying that same original message and
[43:46] not just
[43:47] ministry but sons and daughters of god
[43:50] that were also co-workers and would
[43:52] carry that same
[43:54] message that has been brought from the
[43:56] beginning
[43:59] so it is the whole work of redemption
[44:01] how god condescending now
[44:03] look at this in the scripture hear the
[44:06] lord jesus
[44:07] these are some of the parting
[44:09] instructions
[44:11] the commissioning of his church before
[44:14] he is he is ascended up remember after
[44:17] he
[44:18] raised from the grave and he
[44:21] revealed himself and he came among his
[44:24] brethren
[44:25] remember the bible says in acts 1 he was
[44:27] with them
[44:28] for a period of 40 days
[44:31] instructing to them that there was that
[44:35] instruction
[44:36] of that which pertained to the kingdom
[44:38] among that was
[44:39] that they must needs receive the holy
[44:43] ghost
[44:44] is that right and there was also
[44:46] direction
[44:47] that was given so that they might know
[44:49] that life was
[44:50] coming to put them into action just like
[44:54] it did
[44:54] isaiah when isaiah came into the temple
[44:58] and after god had separated him from the
[45:01] influence of man
[45:02] then he saw god in a way he never saw
[45:06] god before
[45:07] but why was that because god had a work
[45:09] for isaiah to do
[45:11] so god made himself known to isaiah
[45:14] that's the same way he does for each and
[45:16] every one of his children
[45:17] god did not give you and i the holy
[45:19] ghost nor does he call you to receive
[45:22] the holy ghost
[45:23] so that you and i would just sit around
[45:25] there is a work to be done
[45:27] but you and i can't do that work we
[45:29] cannot fulfill the work
[45:31] it has to be christ in us fulfilling
[45:34] his own work oh glory so notice
[45:38] the commission very familiar words here
[45:40] but we want to read them
[45:41] in mark 16 verse 14 after he appeared
[45:44] unto the eleven as they
[45:46] set at me and abraded them with their
[45:48] unbelief and hardness of heart
[45:50] because they believed not him which had
[45:52] seen which had seen
[45:53] him after he was risen he said unto them
[45:57] go ye into all the world and preach
[46:00] the gospel to every creature
[46:05] every creature he that believeth and
[46:09] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[46:12] believeth not shall be damned
[46:15] and these signs shall follow them that
[46:17] believe
[46:18] in my name shall they cast out devils
[46:21] they shall speak with new tongues
[46:23] they shall take up serpents and if they
[46:26] drink any deadly thing
[46:27] it shall not hurt them they shall lay
[46:30] hands on the sick
[46:31] and they shall recover these
[46:34] are all accompanying signs
[46:38] of a living christ
[46:41] these signs accompany the gifts
[46:45] from the mighty conqueror these signs
[46:48] accompany
[46:48] the life of every believer
[46:52] it don't matter how old or how young now
[46:54] let me just say it to you like this
[46:56] remember we are a part
[47:00] of the body of jesus christ and not
[47:03] trying to get ahead of myself but so
[47:04] that you would understand
[47:06] in myself i don't have the gift to see
[47:09] visions i'm not
[47:10] a prophet but that gift is in the body
[47:15] are you with me that gift is in the body
[47:18] i i may not be an evangelist but that
[47:21] gift is in the body
[47:22] so i can say that i am where that gift
[47:25] is at
[47:27] it's not outside of the body so we want
[47:30] to just put it rest
[47:31] don't allow the enemy to trouble you and
[47:34] say well
[47:35] i haven't done this i haven't done that
[47:37] remember the foundation we are standing
[47:40] on
[47:40] of the baptism of the holy ghost is that
[47:43] your life
[47:44] has been changed by the revelation of
[47:47] jesus christ
[47:48] and you are abiding in the body of jesus
[47:51] christ
[47:52] you just want to be available if he
[47:55] wants to use you
[47:56] because let me just tell you something
[47:58] he does use you
[48:01] are you with me there's nobody a
[48:04] wallflower
[48:06] now let's look at this here in verse 19
[48:09] so then
[48:09] after the lord had spoken unto them he
[48:13] was received up into heaven
[48:15] and sat on the right hand of god there
[48:18] was a rightful place here
[48:19] is a positioning of power now verse 20
[48:23] and they went
[48:24] forth and preached everywhere the lord
[48:28] working with them
[48:32] and confirming the word with signs
[48:34] following
[48:35] amen so between that verse 19 and verse
[48:40] 20
[48:41] we know there was a trick to the upper
[48:43] room
[48:46] the lord accompanying them was he who
[48:49] said
[48:49] i not only will be with you i will be
[48:53] in you o glory no wonder he could tell
[48:57] joshua
[48:58] do not fear do not fear
[49:01] for there shall not be any man be able
[49:03] to stand before thee
[49:05] all the days of thy life fear not for i
[49:07] am with thee withersoever thou go
[49:09] that was a type of the antitype which
[49:13] is the holy ghost that would dwell in
[49:15] the life of the believer even when you
[49:17] don't feel it he's still there
[49:20] amen he's there he's been there the seal
[49:24] of the living god
[49:25] has come upon your life notice the lord
[49:27] was working with them and confirming the
[49:29] word
[49:30] with signs following who is it that
[49:32] performs the miracles he does
[49:36] he's the one that performs the miracles
[49:38] he's the one
[49:40] that that baptizes into the body he's
[49:43] the one that deals with the heart
[49:44] he's the one that'll inspire this area
[49:47] such as where
[49:48] paul could say when they were all
[49:50] divided in
[49:52] thought and paul could say hold on a
[49:54] moment we're all working
[49:55] under the same administration he said i
[49:58] have planted a policy of water but god
[50:00] gave the increase
[50:02] paul was letting him know this is not a
[50:04] divided body see
[50:05] the inspiration of the revelation of
[50:09] jesus christ
[50:10] does not promote division the revelation
[50:13] of jesus christ calls
[50:15] into unity of the revelation of jesus
[50:18] christ
[50:19] which never highlights a man it
[50:22] highlights
[50:23] jesus christ that's what gifts of the
[50:26] mighty conqueror do
[50:27] they reflect his victory in earth
[50:33] luke 24 46 and he said unto them these
[50:37] are also out of the gospel of luke
[50:39] parting words thus it is written and
[50:41] thus it behooves christ to suffer
[50:43] and to rise from the dead the third day
[50:46] and that repentance
[50:48] and remission of sins should be preached
[50:51] in his name
[50:52] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[50:56] remission that means where there's a
[50:58] complete release
[51:01] a person carrying the load and the
[51:03] burden
[51:04] of sin that they're under remission of
[51:06] sins is to
[51:08] recognize that through the preaching of
[51:10] the gospel
[51:11] it brings them to an awareness there has
[51:13] been one that has been
[51:15] accepted on your behalf
[51:19] by the sound of the gospel it overrides
[51:22] you don't know what i did you don't know
[51:24] how bad this was
[51:25] you don't know how much i've fallen
[51:26] short you don't know how much the gospel
[51:29] overrides all of that and the gospel
[51:32] calls you
[51:33] to a finished work that's already been
[51:36] done
[51:36] through the lord jesus christ and it
[51:38] lets you know
[51:39] this is why i went i went to calvary for
[51:42] you
[51:42] i came down from you i rose from the
[51:45] grave for you
[51:46] and i sent a message for you that's what
[51:49] the real
[51:50] work of calvary does those
[51:53] gifts from the mighty conqueror reflect
[51:55] that
[51:57] oh glory beginning at jerusalem god
[52:00] honoring his word
[52:02] and ye are witnesses of
[52:05] these things and behold
[52:08] i send the promise of my father upon you
[52:12] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[52:15] until you be endued with power
[52:19] from on high let me just say it like
[52:22] this the church
[52:24] was started or inaugurated on the day of
[52:27] pentecost
[52:31] wherein that the church of the living
[52:33] god what would separate
[52:35] and declare it to be his church is
[52:37] because he would be reflected by his
[52:40] life being present in it
[52:42] he would be the one leading them like he
[52:44] led
[52:45] the children of israel in the pillar of
[52:47] cloud
[52:48] and in that of the pillar of fire the
[52:50] light by day
[52:52] and the pillar of cloud by now hit that
[52:54] same god
[52:55] now leading the church of the living god
[52:58] not outside of
[52:59] man but inside a man that same
[53:03] god inside of the body that he
[53:07] has redeemed he's leading his church oh
[53:10] glory
[53:11] it's his work that he is carrying on
[53:14] all glory then to recognize that then
[53:18] even as we uh would read here in
[53:21] ephesians 4
[53:23] there was what we read of was that
[53:26] that was depicted when a one would
[53:29] conquer
[53:30] another country another territory when
[53:33] they would come back
[53:34] in from conquering that territory they
[53:36] would have
[53:37] um those treasures and that which had
[53:40] been taken
[53:41] and conquered and as they would ride
[53:43] through on a victorious
[53:45] procession they would actually begin
[53:48] there were gifts that were being
[53:50] given out and they were being given up
[53:52] you know what that was
[53:53] it was a reflection of the victory that
[53:56] the one
[53:57] had already won and they were partakers
[54:00] of it
[54:00] let me just say it to you like this god
[54:03] has seen to it brother
[54:05] that this is not like a parade route
[54:07] where they threw candy and there ends up
[54:09] being a piece of candy laying by the
[54:11] gutter
[54:11] i'm telling you when god subdivided
[54:14] himself by the baptism of the holy ghost
[54:17] god knew exactly where you would be and
[54:19] god dispersing that
[54:21] and releasing that the gift of christ
[54:24] he's releasing his life it's
[54:26] no accident that the word came across
[54:29] your pathway it's no accident that you
[54:32] heard
[54:32] and recognize that this is the truth of
[54:35] the living god
[54:36] it's no accident that your life has been
[54:39] changed
[54:39] it is an actual happening of the victory
[54:43] of calvary
[54:44] and the resurrection of the lord jesus
[54:47] christ that he has dispersed
[54:49] that same gift right here in this
[54:52] end time the same original life
[54:55] that manifests his victory brother your
[54:58] life
[54:59] is a reflection of the mighty conquerors
[55:03] oh glory i want you to think of this
[55:06] here
[55:07] in isaiah 52 7 how beautiful this is
[55:10] where paul would pick it from
[55:12] how beautiful upon the mountains are the
[55:15] feet of him
[55:16] that bringeth good tidings that
[55:19] publisheth
[55:20] peace that bringeth good tidings of good
[55:24] that publisheth salvation that saith
[55:27] unto zion
[55:28] that god reigned now remember
[55:31] jesus said i didn't come to bring peace
[55:33] i come to bring a sword
[55:36] what do you say what is he saying i
[55:37] didn't come to make a pact with the
[55:39] devil
[55:42] jesus come see the publishing of peace
[55:45] is to let one know
[55:46] that what the requirement between god
[55:49] and man
[55:50] has been met in the man christ jesus and
[55:53] the same one that fulfilled it in that
[55:56] body of flesh
[55:57] comes present in that word as it's being
[56:00] preached and brings conviction to that
[56:02] heart and
[56:03] draws it to a reality it's beyond
[56:05] anything that a man
[56:06] or woman can ever explain it's god
[56:09] taking hold
[56:10] upon his children publishing
[56:14] peace to where they don't have to be at
[56:16] war
[56:17] anymore with god because that first
[56:20] nature
[56:20] is enmity i don't care how good you try
[56:24] to dress up
[56:25] that first man it's enmity against god
[56:28] it is a product that came between satan
[56:31] and eve
[56:33] are you with me the whole glory be to
[56:36] god
[56:37] publishes salvation this publishing
[56:39] means
[56:40] not printing it that's not what this
[56:44] publishing means
[56:45] it ain't printing press is printing out
[56:46] salvation this
[56:48] publishing means preaching it
[56:52] that saith unto zion thy god
[56:56] reigneth
[56:59] oh glory be to god this is why
[57:02] jesus would say in acts 1 verse 8
[57:07] just a further rehearsing of luke 24
[57:10] what he said there
[57:11] but ye shall receive power
[57:15] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[57:17] you and you shall be
[57:20] witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and
[57:23] he goes through
[57:25] each of those parts so witnesses
[57:28] are lives that are expressions of that
[57:31] resurrected life of the lord jesus
[57:33] christ
[57:35] hallelujah a life that reflects him and
[57:38] his purpose he said the works that i do
[57:40] shall you do also because i live you
[57:43] shall live also
[57:44] so god trained men with a living
[57:47] experience
[57:48] witnesses now let me bring it on down
[57:50] witnesses men
[57:52] and women sons and daughters that have
[57:54] been
[57:55] fully baptized into the body of jesus
[57:58] christ
[57:58] that walk by the power of the
[58:00] resurrection in their life
[58:06] not the old man made over
[58:12] but a new man in christ jesus
[58:15] where all things are passed away and
[58:17] behold all things have become new
[58:20] that's how the bride is to bear the
[58:22] reflection of the bridegroom
[58:24] so is the life of every believer to bear
[58:26] the reflection of the mate
[58:28] christ jesus his life
[58:31] becoming preeminently reflected
[58:34] in and through that life as paul could
[58:36] say the life that i now live in the
[58:38] flesh he lived when a different kind of
[58:40] life before
[58:41] the life i now live in the flesh i live
[58:43] by the
[58:44] faith by the faith of the son of god who
[58:48] left me and gave himself for me notice
[58:51] the life i used to live but now what's
[58:53] happened
[58:54] now i'm not living that life how are you
[58:57] living
[58:58] by that personal reality he loved
[59:01] me he gave himself for me
[59:05] he became my sin offering
[59:08] that i might receive that life
[59:12] that is within that offering which is
[59:14] his own life
[59:19] these are gifts from the mighty
[59:20] conqueror
[59:22] a gift that does not reflect him as a
[59:24] mighty conqueror
[59:26] is not that which god is backing up
[59:31] come on now it must reflect him to be
[59:35] the same
[59:35] yesterday today and forever
[59:41] many gifts but god alliance gifts that
[59:44] are ordained
[59:45] for his elect are you with me
[59:49] hallelujah he ordains that no man
[59:52] as the scripture said can call jesus the
[59:54] christ but by the holy ghost
[59:57] nobody can call nobody can call him lord
[59:59] unless he's become the lord of your life
[1:00:01] by the holy ghost
[1:00:03] so it's a reflection of victory in the
[1:00:06] lives of the believers
[1:00:07] a living testimony a living oracle a
[1:00:10] written epistle that had been personally
[1:00:12] wrote by the overcoming power
[1:00:15] of the mighty conqueror hey listen when
[1:00:18] one conquers another nation what do they
[1:00:20] do they start to try to change that
[1:00:22] nation
[1:00:23] and little things they pick up and
[1:00:24] little things they do but that kind of
[1:00:26] conquering has
[1:00:27] never lasted it'll never work you can
[1:00:30] take a person and try to change them
[1:00:32] to the do's and don'ts and we do this
[1:00:34] and we believe that
[1:00:35] that kind of conquering don't last
[1:00:39] all that produces is hatred slavish fear
[1:00:43] it produces something that god's pleased
[1:00:45] with me if i do this or if i do that
[1:00:48] but brother if they can ever be brought
[1:00:50] into the contact
[1:00:51] of their maker of the one who has done
[1:00:54] the redemptive work so much that the
[1:00:56] holy ghost
[1:00:57] can begin to cause faith to rise to not
[1:01:00] try to perform
[1:01:01] something in themselves but to believe
[1:01:04] it and have faith
[1:01:06] and lay down the life and say i receive
[1:01:08] what you've done for me
[1:01:13] it's got to be received
[1:01:17] oh it comes to an overcoming life being
[1:01:20] reflected through overcomers
[1:01:22] by his spirit now i want you to look at
[1:01:25] this scripture here
[1:01:27] in psalm 68 18.
[1:01:31] david under inspiration would write
[1:01:33] remember in the
[1:01:35] psalms there's many messianic psalms
[1:01:39] and it goes through each of the part in
[1:01:41] the life of christ
[1:01:43] here in psalm 68 verse 18 it is speaking
[1:01:47] of the resurrection of christ i want you
[1:01:51] to notice the words
[1:01:52] thou hast ascended on high thou hast led
[1:01:55] captivity captive thou hast
[1:01:59] received gifts for men
[1:02:03] now there had to be a price that was
[1:02:05] paid
[1:02:07] right there had to be a price that was
[1:02:10] paid
[1:02:11] then here as he deposits unloads the sin
[1:02:16] being our sin barrier our scapegoat he
[1:02:19] unloads it there
[1:02:20] and then then what does he do he goes to
[1:02:22] paradise
[1:02:23] he man he ministers there at paradise
[1:02:26] by the expression of his life i am the
[1:02:29] one
[1:02:29] that they in type by revelation were
[1:02:32] looking to
[1:02:33] i have come the fulfillment of what they
[1:02:36] have waited on
[1:02:37] and paradise was emptied out and he led
[1:02:40] captivity captive
[1:02:41] he ascended he ascended now remember the
[1:02:44] resurrection
[1:02:45] here he comes walking upon the earth
[1:02:48] with his disciples with for 40 days
[1:02:50] he is with them instructing them in
[1:02:53] things concerning the kingdom of god he
[1:02:55] lets him know
[1:02:56] you must receive the holy ghost he
[1:02:58] commands them to do that
[1:03:00] he has right then gifts that he
[1:03:03] has received
[1:03:06] he has received these gifts already
[1:03:09] notice what the gifts were for
[1:03:11] he has received these gifts from men yay
[1:03:14] for the rebellious also that the lord
[1:03:17] god
[1:03:18] might dwell among them aren't you glad
[1:03:20] this is what the gifts are for
[1:03:22] is so that christ might dwell among us
[1:03:28] it's to reflect him he's the one that's
[1:03:31] reflected in the body
[1:03:37] that god that the lord god might dwell
[1:03:39] among them
[1:03:41] now let's pick up from our texts that
[1:03:43] same scripture
[1:03:44] now paul by the spirit of god notice
[1:03:47] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:03:50] on high he led captivity captive
[1:03:52] and gay gifts not received them gave
[1:03:54] them
[1:03:55] there was a receiving of the gifts but
[1:03:58] now when he ascended on high
[1:04:00] now there's the dispersal of those gifts
[1:04:03] brother there was a change from
[1:04:05] receiving them to dispersing them
[1:04:08] amen in the ascension of christ into the
[1:04:11] meditorial seed
[1:04:12] to take the place there as the true
[1:04:14] atonement there
[1:04:15] as one that is manifested in power
[1:04:18] and in glory and a triumph over every
[1:04:22] sin over every devil over every demon
[1:04:25] over every unclean thing
[1:04:27] brother he ascended on high and is set
[1:04:29] down at the right hand
[1:04:31] of authority and power and he sends back
[1:04:34] ministering gifts brother gifts from a
[1:04:37] mighty conqueror
[1:04:38] to announce the rights that belong to
[1:04:41] you
[1:04:41] as as believers there are redemptive
[1:04:44] rights
[1:04:46] you've got a right to claim it
[1:04:51] hallelujah he gave gifts unto men
[1:04:55] now he that ascended what is it but that
[1:04:57] he also descended first
[1:04:59] into the lower parts of the earth see
[1:05:01] how paul picking it up he that
[1:05:02] descendeth is the same also
[1:05:04] that ascended up far above all heavens
[1:05:07] that he
[1:05:08] might fill all things
[1:05:12] colossians 1 18 and he is the head
[1:05:15] of the body the church
[1:05:20] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:05:23] the dead
[1:05:24] who's the head he is he's the head of
[1:05:27] the body
[1:05:31] that in all things he might have
[1:05:34] the preeminence this
[1:05:37] is the goal this was the achievement
[1:05:40] this is what was
[1:05:41] lost in eden was preeminence his
[1:05:44] life now through calvary and the sending
[1:05:48] back of that life
[1:05:49] he is to gain preeminence
[1:05:52] this is an hour that we're living in of
[1:05:55] preeminence
[1:05:57] this is an hour where the bride has been
[1:05:59] built up
[1:06:00] to a place where the head has come to
[1:06:03] the body
[1:06:04] man by the token life of the holy ghost
[1:06:07] it comes down
[1:06:08] where the head has united with the body
[1:06:14] now the scripture says in revelation or
[1:06:17] romans 11
[1:06:18] 29 for the gifts and calling of god
[1:06:23] are without repentance
[1:06:30] this is why let me just put it in a
[1:06:34] simple term so everyone can
[1:06:37] understand it this is why
[1:06:40] that everyone that has had a gift in
[1:06:42] their life that god has given
[1:06:44] music gift gift to write songs
[1:06:48] even a gift to preach a gift to teach
[1:06:51] they'll give an account if it's not been
[1:06:54] used for god
[1:06:59] think of the things where many of them
[1:07:01] and the beatles wrote
[1:07:03] thousands of songs they didn't even
[1:07:05] record it
[1:07:07] their names are tied to that because as
[1:07:09] far as i know there never was any
[1:07:11] repentance
[1:07:13] give an account that's why everest
[1:07:15] presley will give an account
[1:07:17] the man was a gifted man are you with me
[1:07:22] gifted man now when you look at it
[1:07:24] remember
[1:07:25] just being a preacher even though it can
[1:07:27] be a gift
[1:07:29] a man can be a gift to go get things
[1:07:32] started or a gift to do this or even
[1:07:34] one of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:07:37] none of those things are signs that a
[1:07:40] person is
[1:07:42] truly born again
[1:07:46] because the spirit of god can move upon
[1:07:48] them to use that
[1:07:49] gift in their life and they can yield to
[1:07:52] the spirit of god
[1:07:53] for the purpose of using that gift but
[1:07:56] yet themselves
[1:07:57] never be a surrendered vessel to god
[1:08:01] a surrendered vessel is a life
[1:08:04] that has truly been born again by the
[1:08:07] spirit of god
[1:08:09] where that person man or woman is not
[1:08:12] resting on the gift in their life
[1:08:17] that gift is not their absolute that
[1:08:20] gift
[1:08:21] is not their token come on now that gift
[1:08:24] is not their evidence that their spirit
[1:08:26] born
[1:08:28] but the gift of the holy ghost it will
[1:08:31] identify
[1:08:31] a life that every part of that life
[1:08:35] will punctuate the word with a
[1:08:39] man that's what the spirit of truth is
[1:08:45] amen he'll lead and guide us into all
[1:08:48] truth
[1:08:51] gifts and callings are without
[1:08:52] repentance
[1:08:56] personally myself if all i can do is
[1:08:57] clap my hands i want to clap them for
[1:08:59] jesus
[1:09:02] i want to clap him because what he has
[1:09:04] done
[1:09:05] in my life he is worthy
[1:09:08] of all the praise
[1:09:11] if i can sing i want to sing for him i
[1:09:13] want to declare
[1:09:15] his redemption i want to declare
[1:09:18] who he is to me
[1:09:22] amen and if i preach i want to preach
[1:09:24] that living reality
[1:09:26] of who i know him to be
[1:09:30] with the desire of seeing others come to
[1:09:33] know him in that way
[1:09:36] you see it isn't reflecting to a church
[1:09:43] he's not reflecting to get somebody to a
[1:09:46] set of beliefs
[1:09:51] it's getting the people to
[1:09:54] the new birth the revelation of jesus
[1:09:57] christ
[1:09:58] it's getting them to where they meet
[1:10:01] jesus christ
[1:10:02] personally
[1:10:06] let's just be honest friends we've dealt
[1:10:08] many times
[1:10:09] i've dealt too many times run up
[1:10:11] headlong with people who know the
[1:10:13] beliefs of the message
[1:10:16] but they don't have a submissive heart
[1:10:18] that can be lead
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:21] ran into that too many times a sheep
[1:10:24] is willing to be led come on now sheep
[1:10:27] is not their own shepherd
[1:10:29] we have the chief shepherd are you with
[1:10:31] me now
[1:10:32] gifts and callings of god are without
[1:10:36] repentance now this is where brother
[1:10:40] branham would bring it down like this he
[1:10:41] said
[1:10:42] gifts and callings are without
[1:10:43] repentance that's how the message gives
[1:10:45] it's something that god by sovereign
[1:10:48] grace put into the church
[1:10:50] god does that himself it's a work
[1:10:53] and an act of god and by foreknowledge
[1:10:56] he predestinate these things to happen
[1:10:59] he goes on he says gifts and callings
[1:11:01] are without repentance
[1:11:03] god all through the ages has been
[1:11:05] represented on
[1:11:07] earth through his prophets through his
[1:11:10] kings
[1:11:10] and it's always been the spirit of god
[1:11:13] see he is represented through
[1:11:19] so let me just say it in the words
[1:11:23] that the prophet spoke it in he said if
[1:11:26] a healing campaign comes along
[1:11:28] and it reflects off into a denomination
[1:11:31] god never sent it
[1:11:35] where you say what do you mean
[1:11:36] reflecting where is it pointing
[1:11:39] the people too you see it takes us back
[1:11:43] to see
[1:11:43] where is the aim where is the direction
[1:11:50] you see when we can really get to look
[1:11:51] in the name and direction it helps us to
[1:11:53] see
[1:11:54] and have grace for one another because
[1:11:57] sometimes we might hit the wrong target
[1:11:59] but we've got the right aim the right
[1:12:00] desire the right motive
[1:12:02] the right objective we're trying to
[1:12:04] achieve the right thing
[1:12:05] that's why we need the discernment of
[1:12:07] the holy spirit
[1:12:10] are you with me so when we look at this
[1:12:14] it it is that reflection that it must be
[1:12:17] a reflection on to that of jesus christ
[1:12:21] because after our
[1:12:22] after all we are as stars of god we are
[1:12:26] to reflect
[1:12:27] his glorious light now paul would write
[1:12:30] it like this
[1:12:32] in another place now ye are the body of
[1:12:35] christ
[1:12:36] and members in particular
[1:12:39] and god hath set some in the church
[1:12:42] notice
[1:12:43] god hath set some in the church first
[1:12:45] the prophets
[1:12:46] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[1:12:48] teachers after that miracles
[1:12:50] then gifts of healing helps governments
[1:12:52] diversities of tongues
[1:12:54] now brother would liken it in this way
[1:12:57] over and over throughout the message
[1:12:59] it's a very uh very simple example but i
[1:13:03] like those
[1:13:04] things which god comes down and he use
[1:13:06] things to make it clear
[1:13:08] brother brown would take the example he
[1:13:10] said i'm going to speak of
[1:13:12] god being like a great master diamond
[1:13:15] and he talked about how that you know
[1:13:17] from when he was there in kimberley
[1:13:19] south africa and those different places
[1:13:21] of how that you know uh the the
[1:13:24] they have the diamonds you can ride
[1:13:26] right past one on the side of a road a
[1:13:27] matter of fact one of the
[1:13:28] greatest diamonds that was ever found in
[1:13:31] diamonds in the rough they don't look
[1:13:33] like much
[1:13:36] but in order for that diamond for there
[1:13:38] to be fire
[1:13:39] to be displayed in that diamond it's got
[1:13:42] to be cut
[1:13:45] but in order to cut it as in the case
[1:13:48] of the one great diamond they took a man
[1:13:51] years to study it because if he makes
[1:13:53] the wrong cut
[1:13:54] it'll mess that whole diamond up so the
[1:13:57] man had to study
[1:13:58] that diamond for a long time in order to
[1:14:01] know
[1:14:02] where to make the cut but when the cut
[1:14:06] was made
[1:14:07] and then everyone how the cuts then from
[1:14:10] there
[1:14:10] that'll come off of it there then when
[1:14:12] the light itself
[1:14:14] as the light would begin to show upon
[1:14:16] that diamond
[1:14:17] inside of that diamond would there would
[1:14:20] be that
[1:14:21] of a fire seemingly to glow in the midst
[1:14:24] of that diamond
[1:14:25] because where it has been formed by the
[1:14:28] fire
[1:14:29] now when that has been cut in order for
[1:14:31] that diamond
[1:14:32] it is cut and once it is cut in
[1:14:35] paragraph 106 of the oddball
[1:14:37] brother brown so when that diamond is is
[1:14:39] cut so that it will reflect what's on
[1:14:41] the inside of it
[1:14:43] the fire that's in that diamond it has
[1:14:45] to be
[1:14:46] cut to every little way every little
[1:14:48] shape
[1:14:49] three points you put the three points to
[1:14:51] a diamond and a light against the
[1:14:53] three-point object
[1:14:54] we'll give seven colors and he said now
[1:14:56] i want you to notice
[1:14:58] god was wounded for our transgressions
[1:15:01] bruised for our iniquities he was cut
[1:15:05] bruised that great diamond that from him
[1:15:09] might reflect the gifts to the church

[1:16:11] think anybody buys or gives a diamond
[1:16:14] and says
[1:16:14] here this diamond only served a purpose

[1:16:19] neither has god removed the ministerial
[1:16:23] gifts
[1:16:24] from the church of the living god and
[1:16:26] the real bride of jesus christ
[1:16:28] she's not ashamed of the ministerial
[1:16:32] gifts
[1:16:32] or the nine spiritual gifts she's not
[1:16:36] ashamed
[1:16:39] whether she has been united with him

[1:16:46] come to me and i'll show you in my
[1:16:48] little hope chest
[1:16:49] but all of this right here has already
[1:16:51] been fulfilled that ain't the bride of
[1:16:53] jesus christ
[1:16:54] the bride of jesus christ knows that
[1:16:56] he's still
[1:16:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:04] she's a living witness of this message

[1:17:37] not destroyed
[1:17:38] it's put to use many of them are made to
[1:17:41] victrola needles
[1:17:42] and those needles bring forth what
[1:17:45] that's been shipped from the diamond
[1:17:46] they bring forth music that's been
[1:17:48] canned
[1:17:50] into a record
[1:17:53] there have been many things god has
[1:17:55] canned in his word
[1:17:59] and every so often god
[1:18:02] would send forth a victrola needle
[1:18:07] and a prophet would come along and be
[1:18:10] able
[1:18:11] to reveal what's canned in the word
[1:18:15] what's been sealed whether that's when
[1:18:17] you can it oh my when something's canned
[1:18:19] it's been sealed
[1:18:20] but it takes a needle to reveal what's
[1:18:23] been sealed
[1:18:24] it's not the needle that does it but the
[1:18:27] needle there's a gift that's there
[1:18:29] that betrayal a needle that's able when
[1:18:31] it comes glory be to god
[1:18:33] when it comes upon that word that has
[1:18:36] been written or

[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:38] you're not a diamond isn't as though you
[1:19:40] made yourself a diamond
[1:19:42] but it has been that which has been
[1:19:45] revealed to you

[1:19:52] hallelujah gifts of conquering
[1:19:56] gifts that manifest his victory
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:03] you might not have a ministerial gift in
[1:20:05] your life but your
[1:20:06] life will preach sermons in places where
[1:20:09] no apostle
[1:20:10] prophet pastor evangelist or teacher can
[1:20:13] get to
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] hallelujah your life preaches sermons
[1:20:20] revelation that god has given in this
[1:20:24] hour and that revelation has been
[1:20:27] inscripted on your life
[1:20:29] you're not an epistle wrote by a man
[1:20:32] wrote by a church wrote by a set of
[1:20:34] creeds
[1:20:35] you are an epistle that has been written
[1:20:38] and manifestly declared by the spirit of
[1:20:42] christ
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] hallelujah
[1:20:48] not i that liveth christ liveth in me
[1:20:54] that's the way the gifts of the spirit
[1:20:55] is he goes on to say
[1:20:57] it's a part of that diamond it's sent
[1:21:00] been brought down and brought into a
[1:21:02] gift to interpret
[1:21:04] to preach to teach he said there's five
[1:21:07] spiritual gifts
[1:21:09] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:21:10] evangelists and they are all for the
[1:21:12] edifying
[1:21:14] of the body of christ it's an awful big
[1:21:17] statement
[1:21:18] and i don't have time to preach it
[1:21:19] tonight but just as sure
[1:21:22] as there is teachers pastors there's got
[1:21:24] to be prophets
[1:21:28] and it don't do no good to send a
[1:21:30] prophet if you ain't going to have
[1:21:32] apostles
[1:21:33] pastors teachers and evangelists
[1:21:38] they all work in conjunction
[1:21:42] because if you do away with one it's
[1:21:44] because you put the diamond away
[1:21:48] because that diamond is made to display
[1:21:51] the different types of light
[1:21:53] black light green light red light blue
[1:21:55] light it will
[1:21:56] actually display the different rays of
[1:21:58] light but every one of those rays
[1:21:59] reflect
[1:22:00] from the same and on to the same great
[1:22:02] master diamond
[1:22:04] oh glory aren't you glad that you've got
[1:22:06] a token that says
[1:22:07] i've not only been engaged i've been
[1:22:09] married
[1:22:11] i've got on the wedding band you know
[1:22:13] what the wedding band is it says that
[1:22:15] you yourself remember
[1:22:16] his word is right there in you you can
[1:22:19] speak
[1:22:20] the word that's what that means you've
[1:22:22] got the king seal
[1:22:23] you've got his name the wedding band of
[1:22:26] identification
[1:22:27] has already been placed upon you you are
[1:22:29] wearing it with authority
[1:22:31] thank god when we would come into a
[1:22:33] service brother danny or we come into a
[1:22:35] certain time
[1:22:36] and how the spirit of god will move
[1:22:38] right down and he'll take a gift and
[1:22:40] that man don't know nothing about you
[1:22:42] he don't know even the thoughts you've
[1:22:44] been taking he don't know what's been
[1:22:46] going through your mind
[1:22:47] and the spirit of god will take that
[1:22:49] gift in that life
[1:22:50] and he will reflect himself in such a
[1:22:53] way
[1:22:54] that you think who's been talking to him
[1:22:56] how did he find this out
[1:22:57] even though you know but it's just
[1:22:59] something you stand in awe
[1:23:01] how does he know that because he the
[1:23:03] master diamond
[1:23:05] is reflecting a ray of light through one
[1:23:07] of those
[1:23:08] chips that came off of him and brother
[1:23:11] he's right there
[1:23:12] to minister to our needs what is he the
[1:23:14] mighty conqueror
[1:23:16] reflecting himself and dispersing
[1:23:19] through the great rays of the diamond
[1:23:24] oh glory every one of those gifts
[1:23:29] every one of those rays or gifts
[1:23:32] they can be a little peculiar when the
[1:23:34] prophet himself
[1:23:36] when he was standing here he began to
[1:23:38] realize how people were drawing lines
[1:23:42] they were making differences now bear in
[1:23:45] mind the scripture even that we read
[1:23:47] last week or that you could recall to
[1:23:49] mind out of first corinthians 12
[1:23:51] because the hand is not the ear it
[1:23:54] cannot say i'm not part of the body
[1:23:56] or because the nose can say well because
[1:23:58] i'm not the foot i'm not the body
[1:24:00] but god took the example of the body of
[1:24:03] how all these things
[1:24:04] in the body are to work together
[1:24:08] to achieve one purpose is that right
[1:24:11] i need my eye i need my ears to hear my
[1:24:14] wife say it's time for dinner i need my
[1:24:16] eyes to find the seat
[1:24:19] or my eyes to say how about a little
[1:24:20] more right here
[1:24:22] and i need now listen to me my stomach
[1:24:25] is needing it but it ain't just my
[1:24:27] stomach that's needing it
[1:24:28] it's the organs of my body that are
[1:24:30] needing that food which are the cells of
[1:24:32] my body that make it up
[1:24:34] but you see the cells can't come out of
[1:24:36] the body and go into the pantry
[1:24:38] and take a little oatmeal pie and unwrap
[1:24:39] it
[1:24:41] i'm not advocating that for nutrition
[1:24:43] but you under you get what i mean
[1:24:45] the cells though they need it they can't
[1:24:47] do it
[1:24:48] there's got to be coordination on every
[1:24:51] part
[1:24:52] it takes every part to do what
[1:24:55] so that that cell can get the food and
[1:24:58] that cell doesn't say
[1:25:00] thank god for the hands boy your eyes
[1:25:02] sir couldn't do much
[1:25:03] no that's hell glory be to god that cell
[1:25:07] recognizes us if it had not been for the
[1:25:09] years hearing
[1:25:10] the nose smelling and there being eyes
[1:25:13] to see it and there had been a mouth
[1:25:15] that could be opened
[1:25:16] there would be teeth present to chew it
[1:25:18] and that there through that stomach
[1:25:20] there would be acids come upon that and
[1:25:22] break that down
[1:25:23] and then disperse that through the body
[1:25:25] and then it makes its way into the cell
[1:25:27] the cell knows every one of those parts
[1:25:30] have made it available
[1:25:32] that i'm sustained right here tonight
[1:25:34] let me tell you something
[1:25:36] it is because of the living god that has
[1:25:38] been and is still working through
[1:25:41] a many-membered body that the body of
[1:25:44] jesus christ
[1:25:45] is alive and standing on earth tonight
[1:25:48] in the resurrected power of his glory
[1:25:52] it's because lives that have been
[1:25:54] yielded
[1:25:58] is the eye more than the hand no
[1:26:04] the glory is i was able to be a part of
[1:26:08] what god was doing
[1:26:12] i was able whatever the little part
[1:26:14] could be
[1:26:16] that's how these different gifts and the
[1:26:18] prophet he picked this up of how
[1:26:20] that in this time how there were
[1:26:22] differences where people were
[1:26:24] they were making differences but it
[1:26:26] wasn't the people it's just they didn't
[1:26:27] understand
[1:26:28] they were saying brother adam here the
[1:26:30] spirit of god was picking it up where
[1:26:31] you could say
[1:26:32] one has the gift there you know of the
[1:26:34] teacher one's a pastor one's evangelist
[1:26:36] or one's speaking tongue or want to
[1:26:37] prophesy
[1:26:38] and he said because this one has this
[1:26:39] gift but the other one don't have that
[1:26:41] gift
[1:26:41] then then they said they start looking
[1:26:43] at it and it becomes differences
[1:26:46] well i can tell you right now that's the
[1:26:49] same way this is why we need
[1:26:51] the help of the spirit of god this is
[1:26:54] why god don't have every ministry
[1:26:56] that every ministry will go from first
[1:26:57] gear to fifth gear god has some ministry
[1:26:59] that'll stay in fifth gear and wear the
[1:27:01] devil out
[1:27:01] just as much as somebody who's going in
[1:27:03] fifth gear
[1:27:05] you understand it doesn't matter if it's
[1:27:07] first gear or fifth gear
[1:27:10] but sometimes what happens is is the
[1:27:12] misunderstandings
[1:27:15] teachers are not looked at to be that
[1:27:17] spiritual
[1:27:19] evangelists are looked at to be oh
[1:27:21] they're just radical they're just
[1:27:23] pastors are looked to be like well you
[1:27:26] know dad he's always here apostles
[1:27:33] it's just it's looked at in a manner
[1:27:35] well it's not this is
[1:27:37] but see what it is god has set
[1:27:40] for what he's needed for that time
[1:27:44] god doesn't want everybody to where they
[1:27:46] operate in fifth gear
[1:27:49] god don't want every time even that i
[1:27:51] preach that i operate within fifth gear
[1:27:53] some of the times i've fallen on my face
[1:27:55] maybe you don't know it but it seems
[1:27:56] like it's right out in the open
[1:27:58] it seems like when i've not got into the
[1:28:00] right gear and i feel like i'm fumbling
[1:28:01] and
[1:28:01] tripling all of myself and it's just a
[1:28:03] reminder for me you know what you're
[1:28:05] going too
[1:28:06] fast now that don't mean i'm going to
[1:28:08] slow down
[1:28:09] it just means i'll go this pace that he
[1:28:11] wants me to go when he wants me to go
[1:28:14] other times he gives it to me all i have
[1:28:15] to do my mind's not good my mind's not
[1:28:17] that good
[1:28:18] i have to just be yielded and let him
[1:28:19] speak so it flows it comes out and it's
[1:28:21] connected i have to give it or else
[1:28:22] brother carlos it leaves my mind
[1:28:25] because you all don't want me to stop
[1:28:26] and write notes up here do you and say
[1:28:28] hold on a minute
[1:28:28] i got a note for later on
[1:28:33] but everything it's a little peculiar
[1:28:36] but these lights
[1:28:37] are all gathered together to reflect one
[1:28:40] person
[1:28:42] now i want you to just to think of this
[1:28:44] here as we bring this
[1:28:46] on down every one of these lights
[1:28:50] and how that they the rays and how that
[1:28:52] they they shine
[1:28:55] every one of them brother branham would
[1:28:57] say like this in the message
[1:28:58] gifts he says these
[1:29:03] uh god is like a great diamond he just
[1:29:05] refers back to that
[1:29:06] then in the next paragraph i want to go
[1:29:08] he says and they lay that diamond they
[1:29:10] lay it in light
[1:29:12] great rays of light shines off from it
[1:29:16] and those are god's messengers
[1:29:19] gifts all of it comes back to the same
[1:29:23] self same god the gift of healing the
[1:29:25] gift of preaching the gift of
[1:29:27] prophesying
[1:29:28] all the spiritual gifts of the body are
[1:29:30] just
[1:29:31] rays or reflections off of the self-same
[1:29:36] god here's what they declare
[1:29:40] every one of those rays he says for one
[1:29:42] is to given
[1:29:44] knowledge for the brahman time that gift
[1:29:46] of knowledge he said is like a prophet
[1:29:47] like ezekiel
[1:29:48] can see far off and identify these
[1:29:51] symbols
[1:29:52] identify what this is and bring it
[1:29:53] present tense
[1:29:55] to another wisdom to another gifts of
[1:29:58] healing
[1:29:58] to another gifts of prophecy but all by
[1:30:01] the selfsame spirit the great diamond
[1:30:04] and the big rays of light that we see
[1:30:06] shoot this way shoot that way
[1:30:08] all declare one thing there is a god
[1:30:11] that lives and reigns
[1:30:15] and as long as you see those things in
[1:30:17] operation you know that that god is
[1:30:19] still the same
[1:30:22] amen opera as long as he's operating in
[1:30:24] one of those little rays of light
[1:30:25] there's still a god that lives and
[1:30:28] reigns
[1:30:30] now i want you to see this
[1:30:34] as we close
[1:30:38] this is not limited to just
[1:30:42] ministers it's not even limited to those
[1:30:45] that at some point in time if god ever
[1:30:47] operated one of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:30:49] it's not just limited to that
[1:30:53] these are love gifts from the mighty
[1:30:55] conqueror
[1:30:58] brother branham put it like this he said
[1:31:00] if i was god
[1:31:02] i gave you my word and you read it
[1:31:05] you didn't believe it that'd be all
[1:31:09] he said but not god he said god
[1:31:13] so loved that he sent five ministerial
[1:31:16] offices in the church
[1:31:18] and he said still if you don't get it
[1:31:22] he said now man would have said you
[1:31:24] still don't get it
[1:31:26] he said but not god god placed nine
[1:31:29] spiritual gifts
[1:31:32] what are we looking at the love of god
[1:31:35] god trying to get his message across
[1:31:39] i've witnessed where god has spoke his
[1:31:42] word
[1:31:42] right through a service and then it come
[1:31:44] right to the end of the service
[1:31:46] and i've witnessed how that the spirit
[1:31:47] of god would fall upon one
[1:31:49] and call somebody out and it called them
[1:31:52] out and the next thing you know they're
[1:31:53] standing right there at the altar
[1:31:54] it was not something general where they
[1:31:56] had to know it was in themselves
[1:31:58] god put their name on that
[1:31:59] interpretation and they were found right
[1:32:02] at the altar repenting and giving their
[1:32:03] life to god
[1:32:05] you say what is that i'm saying that's
[1:32:07] the love of god
[1:32:09] that's god's love the devil could have
[1:32:12] you know tried to play around well
[1:32:13] that's just you know
[1:32:14] that's just them they know about you you
[1:32:16] know it's just telling you about your
[1:32:18] life he knows about your life but let me
[1:32:20] tell you something
[1:32:21] when that steps on the scene even like
[1:32:23] that you know what if they wouldn't
[1:32:24] respond to the preaching
[1:32:26] god in his mercy will not be defeated
[1:32:32] what is that the love of god
[1:32:35] the gifts of the mighty conqueror
[1:32:37] reflect
[1:32:38] his love back into the church
[1:32:42] every special that sung is to reflect
[1:32:45] his love
[1:32:46] back into the church every gift is to
[1:32:49] reflect his love
[1:32:50] his love his life back into the church
[1:32:54] and so it comes down that it's not us
[1:32:57] it's not the gift though the gift
[1:32:59] of pastor is in my life but that gift
[1:33:02] i don't operate that gift
[1:33:08] god operates through that gift to
[1:33:10] minister to needs that come here
[1:33:13] and by revelation have been revealed to
[1:33:16] them
[1:33:17] that that's the man that god has put
[1:33:18] that gift of a pastor for my life
[1:33:23] to where you're not just calling me a
[1:33:25] pastor but in your mind you think of me
[1:33:26] just
[1:33:27] he's just a preacher but you recognize
[1:33:30] that man has been given a stewardship
[1:33:33] see this is why this is why it's not
[1:33:35] just something we just take haphazardly
[1:33:38] we're to pray over it and it needs to be
[1:33:40] spiritually revealed
[1:33:43] is that right because what there'll be
[1:33:46] times
[1:33:47] that you know what this can disappoint
[1:33:49] you there'll be times that things can be
[1:33:50] said
[1:33:51] you may not agree with but if there's a
[1:33:53] revelation just like in your marriage
[1:33:56] but if there's a revelation that's there
[1:33:58] that's greater than your feelings
[1:34:01] your ideas your opinions it's greater
[1:34:03] than anything
[1:34:04] it's what holds us that's why there must
[1:34:08] be
[1:34:09] a real revelation on these things this
[1:34:10] is what was spoken
[1:34:12] in the message
[1:34:17] gifts from the conqueror so it's your
[1:34:20] life
[1:34:20] my life places brother bill
[1:34:24] i never did walk in norsen's you did
[1:34:27] there's people in your family
[1:34:28] between you brother richard and
[1:34:30] different ones there's people in your
[1:34:31] family i'll never meet
[1:34:32] but your lives brother gomez people in
[1:34:35] your family i'd never meet
[1:34:37] brother danny sister sarah
[1:34:40] brother trevor there's people i never
[1:34:43] meet
[1:34:44] but after all he wouldn't do no good if
[1:34:46] i did meet him
[1:34:48] it has to be god moving on their heart
[1:34:54] but you see in your life you might think
[1:34:56] well i ain't that good at putting this
[1:34:58] together
[1:34:58] i ain't that good at explaining this or
[1:35:00] putting that together or putting this
[1:35:02] together
[1:35:02] just let go and let god use you
[1:35:07] maybe you may not be the one to set
[1:35:09] everybody down and go through this and
[1:35:11] go through that
[1:35:12] maybe that may not be the part that
[1:35:14] you're called to but listen
[1:35:15] you're a part within the body that your
[1:35:18] life can so testify
[1:35:19] that somebody can look and say what is
[1:35:22] it about your life that's different
[1:35:24] there's something different about your
[1:35:26] life i know of the christians
[1:35:28] but there's something different about
[1:35:29] your life and what happens
[1:35:31] it's christ in you reflecting his own
[1:35:34] life
[1:35:35] his victory that's getting a hold of
[1:35:37] that life
[1:35:38] what's been happening your life has
[1:35:40] preached a
[1:35:41] series to them sometimes just exactly
[1:35:45] that you felt like they're not listening
[1:35:47] they're not listening and
[1:35:49] so and so they're obscene or this or
[1:35:51] that but brother
[1:35:52] all along remember he has given gifts
[1:35:55] for the rebellious
[1:35:56] that the lord god might dwell among them
[1:35:59] what does the gift do
[1:36:01] it is a chip off of the diamond that can
[1:36:04] actually reflect
[1:36:05] that light
[1:36:09] we are witnesses
[1:36:13] over and over in the scriptures
[1:36:16] we'll just stop here tonight you find
[1:36:20] when paul would talk about the ministry
[1:36:23] paul would not there was only certain
[1:36:25] times paul would use
[1:36:26] the exclusiveness of what god had
[1:36:28] revealed to him but he always made it
[1:36:30] aware
[1:36:31] that god revealed it for us we are
[1:36:34] workers in this together
[1:36:37] paul would over and over use those terms
[1:36:40] over and over again
[1:36:44] same as the prophet did in this hour
[1:36:47] when he had the brethren gathered
[1:36:49] together there questions and answers
[1:36:51] 1959 i believe
[1:36:53] 16 one of those he has them called
[1:36:56] together
[1:36:57] he said brother you realize what i'm
[1:37:00] doing here
[1:37:00] this evening you are messengers
[1:37:04] in the same message with me
[1:37:07] let me just tell you you are messengers
[1:37:11] in this same message
[1:37:15] because the message it's more than a
[1:37:17] tape it's more than a book
[1:37:19] the message has got to be more than
[1:37:21] brother branham said
[1:37:22] it's got to be christ revealed to you
[1:37:24] personally
[1:37:26] to where your flesh is the actual
[1:37:29] garment that his glory is revealed
[1:37:33] through
[1:37:35] so who are we leading people to jesus
[1:37:38] christ
[1:37:40] jesus christ that's what the gifts from
[1:37:41] the conqueror does
[1:37:43] it leads it to jesus christ that's what
[1:37:45] every gift that's to me every gift that
[1:37:47] plays up here
[1:37:48] it ought to be a life that is
[1:37:50] surrendered to god
[1:37:51] in such a measure that christ can
[1:37:53] operate and reflect his life through
[1:37:56] not just up here but out everywhere we
[1:37:59] go
[1:38:00] it ought to be a mark that's a christian
[1:38:02] every special that sung
[1:38:04] every minister that sings hey listen
[1:38:07] we've got to bring it all the way across
[1:38:09] every minister that preaches needs to
[1:38:12] have a personal meeting with god
[1:38:14] and if every minister needs to have that
[1:38:16] then so does every part of this
[1:38:17] congregation
[1:38:20] what a glorious reality what a glorious
[1:38:24] reality
[1:38:25] we we have been an admin
[1:38:28] admonished by the spirit of god as
[1:38:31] reflections
[1:38:33] rays of light
[1:38:39] brother brahma said it like this he said
[1:38:41] like that nightingale
[1:38:43] he said i seen that nightingale he said
[1:38:44] it would sing and sing
[1:38:48] and he said would sing those songs that
[1:38:49] little birdie he said but then i come to
[1:38:51] realize he said
[1:38:54] the reason it would sing he said is
[1:38:56] because
[1:38:58] if they could see one star they would
[1:39:00] get their eyes on that star and they
[1:39:02] would start
[1:39:02] singing because they knew the light is
[1:39:06] shining in another place
[1:39:08] and that nightingale would just sing and
[1:39:10] sing and sing
[1:39:11] same way with that little spring brother
[1:39:14] brown would go and drink from
[1:39:16] be refreshed why are you doing this is
[1:39:19] it because i come and drink here
[1:39:21] it's because of the deer what is it
[1:39:24] he said if they could talk he would tell
[1:39:26] me
[1:39:27] it's not you brother branham but there
[1:39:30] is a force behind me
[1:39:32] that causes me to bubble up brother
[1:39:35] branham would take those two examples
[1:39:37] and place it how god uses his gifts
[1:39:41] in the body it's not you
[1:39:45] it's not me a gift is not given to me
[1:39:49] nor a gift given to you that we would
[1:39:51] take a hold of it
[1:39:52] but a gift is for us to yield
[1:40:00] aren't you glad don't you just want your
[1:40:04] life to be a reflection that
[1:40:06] oh it don't it don't point people
[1:40:08] necessarily even though people might
[1:40:09] want to know
[1:40:10] where do you go to church but it points
[1:40:11] them beyond the church
[1:40:14] it points them to a living reality it
[1:40:17] points them to something that they know
[1:40:19] there's something different i can't put
[1:40:20] my finger on it but there's something
[1:40:22] different
[1:40:23] about you what is it it's a life
[1:40:27] reflecting the mighty conqueror
[1:40:32] that's what we want to be don't we let's
[1:40:35] pray
[1:40:38] oh heavenly father
[1:40:42] lord tonight our hearts
[1:40:46] are truly stirred
[1:40:50] challenged lord of revisiting
[1:40:56] of the commission
[1:40:59] lord for every heart that's here for
[1:41:01] every life that's streaming
[1:41:04] father this is the desire the burden
[1:41:09] in our lives is that the mighty
[1:41:12] conqueror
[1:41:14] would be reflected the our lord no
[1:41:17] matter what situation who we come across
[1:41:21] there's things the lord that maybe in
[1:41:22] one person's life
[1:41:24] this other person maybe maybe never
[1:41:27] dealt with that
[1:41:28] but this other person lord you came on
[1:41:30] the scene
[1:41:32] maybe they were so entwined with certain
[1:41:34] things within the world
[1:41:37] but god you manifested your victory not
[1:41:39] just loosening from those things
[1:41:42] but to where the lord that you would
[1:41:44] become the very lord of their
[1:41:46] life you look through their eyes you
[1:41:49] speak through their mouth
[1:41:52] branches of the vine
[1:41:56] lord jesus their life
[1:42:01] is a testimony a written epistle a
[1:42:04] living oracle
[1:42:07] of the mighty conqueror it reflects
[1:42:12] that living reality of the victory day
[1:42:16] of calvary it reflects what that day was
[1:42:20] all about
[1:42:21] where the price was finished the work
[1:42:24] was finished
[1:42:27] then lord when you ascended on high
[1:42:29] after your resurrection and meeting with
[1:42:33] chosen witnesses that you would reveal
[1:42:37] yourself to
[1:42:39] send back the holy ghost and those gifts
[1:42:43] of the conqueror the mighty conqueror he
[1:42:45] would reflect
[1:42:47] that overcoming power that light right
[1:42:50] down into the church of the living god
[1:42:54] lord there's corners there's areas
[1:42:58] i think of that song that many of us
[1:43:00] know
[1:43:01] many times it would be sung when one
[1:43:04] would go out lord
[1:43:06] to take the gospel and yet it would also
[1:43:09] speak to us
[1:43:10] where we live where we work
[1:43:13] and our families brighten the corner
[1:43:16] where you are brighten the corner where
[1:43:20] you are let your life
[1:43:22] let your light so shine then men might
[1:43:26] see your good works and glorify your
[1:43:27] heavenly father
[1:43:29] for the candle is not lit just to be lit
[1:43:34] but one lights a candle and places it
[1:43:37] on a candlestick because as it's been
[1:43:40] lit
[1:43:41] it's raised up into a place that it can
[1:43:44] actually cast
[1:43:45] light throughout that house
[1:43:48] where others can see lord may our lives
[1:43:53] may our lives declare
[1:43:57] shine that light the glorious light of
[1:44:00] the gospel
[1:44:01] that others might see that same lord
[1:44:05] jesus
[1:44:06] maybe they wouldn't know what to call it
[1:44:08] maybe they lord do not know
[1:44:10] not even maybe having words but they
[1:44:12] know there's something about it there's
[1:44:14] something lord
[1:44:15] that begins to draw upon what's in their
[1:44:18] lives lord
[1:44:19] may our lives be lived in such a way
[1:44:22] that is salty as so to cause thirst
[1:44:26] among others help us lord
[1:44:30] among our families among our friends
[1:44:32] help us lord among our co-workers
[1:44:34] help us lord among one another
[1:44:37] lord god for even as we come here and we
[1:44:40] gather
[1:44:41] there's some lord that come here the
[1:44:44] lord they need a deeper walk with you
[1:44:46] and each of us lord we want to move
[1:44:49] closer
[1:44:50] i pray heavenly father may our lives
[1:44:53] lord god
[1:44:54] may it be a beckoning lord may it be a
[1:44:57] reflection lord
[1:44:58] when problems come up when questions
[1:45:00] lord when trials arise
[1:45:02] lord god when sickness is lord oh god
[1:45:05] and things that are so far beyond
[1:45:07] lord god want anything a medical science
[1:45:10] can do but yet lord god we've got the
[1:45:12] promise in your word
[1:45:13] i'm the lord that healeth all fine
[1:45:16] diseases
[1:45:17] may you manifest lord yourself lord god
[1:45:20] as the mighty conqueror lord god through
[1:45:23] your gifts lord god
[1:45:24] those chips off of the diamond lord that
[1:45:27] would reflect
[1:45:28] lord that same fire and would glorify
[1:45:32] jesus christ ready lord god
[1:45:36] oh father i pray lord god right now
[1:45:40] tonight
[1:45:41] for every need for every request or god
[1:45:45] may you just lord minister to that life
[1:45:47] that need that heart
[1:45:49] personally lord
[1:45:53] oh lord jesus that heart that's away
[1:45:57] from you lord
[1:45:59] may they realize lord it's just to
[1:46:02] receive
[1:46:05] what you've already done that's what the
[1:46:08] gifts refer they reflect back
[1:46:11] the finished work
[1:46:14] oh jesus how we love you lord
[1:46:18] as a bride oh lord jesus
[1:46:23] we love every one of your gifts

[1:46:38] to be

[1:46:46] pulpit maybe they've
[1:46:47] been somebody lord maybe they hadn't
[1:46:49] been called on to pray or something like
[1:46:51] that
[1:46:51] it doesn't mean anything less at all the
[1:46:54] lord god in their life
[1:46:56] when they would walk in that factory in
[1:46:59] that factory walks the son of god
[1:47:02] that's been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:47:03] lamb and their life when he walks in
[1:47:06] there lord it's a life
[1:47:09] where there's a sounding of the jubilee
[1:47:11] that goes forth
[1:47:12] freedom freedom freedom freedom
[1:47:16] sometimes the lord maybe there's
[1:47:18] co-workers that get upset at them
[1:47:20] and they can't even think why they don't
[1:47:22] know what what's been done why is this
[1:47:24] person against me it's not the person
[1:47:26] it's a demon that has them bound and
[1:47:29] that demon knows there's a call going
[1:47:31] out
[1:47:32] of freedom there's a freedom of liberty
[1:47:35] that's through that life and that demon
[1:47:37] is trying to keep them bound
