[0:06] you didn't know who you were but you are
[0:09] a Divine minority
[0:11] [Music]
[0:13] and how many of you know when you are a
[0:16] Divine minority with God you become a
[0:19] majority
[0:20] one man and God can Triumph for a
[0:23] thousand one man and God put Satan on
[0:26] the run so be careful weary pilgrims
[0:29] stand up for God and see one man and God
[0:32] can win the victory
[0:35] you may feel like a minority but you're
[0:38] a Divine minority when you're holding on
[0:42] to God
[0:43] when he's the one you refuse to
[0:46] use the jealous God
[0:48] start out to serve him you better not
[0:50] pick up other gods along the way for if
[0:52] you do the same God who ran after you
[0:54] will run after you
[0:57] [Music]
[1:00] the same God that did you right
[1:04] he knows how to bring hurt
[1:07] he knows how to consume you somebody
[1:09] said that's not New Testament it's Bible
[1:11] [Music]
[1:13] and it's not to cause you to fear God
[1:15] it's to cause you to walk in the fear of
[1:17] the Lord
[1:18] which is reverential fear
[1:21] you decide that you're going to pick up
[1:22] sin
[1:25] you're going to live your own life
[1:26] instead of The Godly life the way of the
[1:29] Lord you're going to find out that it
[1:31] hurts
[1:32] [Music]
[1:34] it takes you years to get to the end of
[1:36] you
[1:37] but if you were ever his in the
[1:40] beginning he'll find you
[1:42] come on now he'll chase after you
[1:45] he will have you
[1:48] will you trust that he is Sovereign
[1:52] will you trust him like brother Branham
[1:54] said that God will put a harness and a
[1:57] bit on your trouble
[2:01] he will restrain your troubles he will
[2:06] drive them like a man drives a chariot
[2:10] they will not overcome you they will not
[2:13] take you under they'll only bring you
[2:16] again and again and again and again to
[2:18] the foot of the cross can you trust a
[2:20] God Like That
[2:24] you see this is where the church world
[2:26] has it so wrong
[2:28] because they're so upset with how God
[2:30] has been presented that they are
[2:32] presenting a God that's not even the god
[2:34] of the Bible you seen anybody suffer did
[2:37] you know Christians get cancer
[2:39] did you know Christians lose loved ones
[2:42] did you know Christians go through some
[2:44] heartache and high blood pressure and
[2:46] did you know Christians go through some
[2:47] stuff can you still serve a God that
[2:49] would allow that to come on your life
[2:52] knowing that he has not allowed it to
[2:55] destroy you he has allowed it to bring
[2:57] you to the end of you
[3:00] so that you can surrender and let him
[3:01] take over in your life
[3:03] come on now
[3:06] thank you
