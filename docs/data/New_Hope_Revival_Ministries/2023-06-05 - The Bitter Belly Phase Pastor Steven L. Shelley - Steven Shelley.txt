the East Coast I flew they drove and uh God broke out in Revival in that little town where my wife is from in New Brunswick Canada God sent you Revival to our young people how many of you were in those meetings hold up your hand not many of us left but God poured out his Spirit Martha were you did you go you did didn't you yeah uh we had such a wonderful outpouring of the Holy Ghost I don't like to make public shows I don't but there was so much of the anointing of God we went to the restaurant after the service the spirit of God fell in the restaurant the pastor grabbed his no the pastor ran out the door and left his coat because he didn't want to fall apart in the restaurant waitresses were crying I walked out and there were young people laying out under the power of God all through the parking lot of the restaurant a black cord wood they had to pack them up and put them in the vehicle and take them back to the to the cat to the end where we were staying and I want you to know when we walked through that little town the business owners come out to shake our hand they said you're some of them that's having that meeting down there aren't you you know God there was no way to contain that you couldn't have done enough damage control to keep that undercut we we ought to just let the Lord have his way especially when we're in the house of God this is not your house this is his house amen I know you've been standing but would you would you remain just another minute would you thank god with me for these musicians their gifts thank you bars I know there's only one

back on YouTube and the app is working and we're we're not on Facebook but they will find us let me just mention uh the the camp meeting this year is Tuesday night October the 3rd through Sunday afternoon October the 8th we don't know the speakers yet but we know it's going to be a wonderful time in the Lord and I wish we would have to put out chairs and uh and run this place over I would like to see that and I know that God can help it be possible not so we can brag about the number but so that that many people can get under the wonderful presence of God all right open your Bibles I want you to go with me to revelation chapter 10. we are in a series and I I normally try to do something different in the little fellowship meeting but the Lord wouldn't let me so I'll just go back to this beginning in verse 8 Revelation chapter 10 I love the whole I love the whole book that whole chapter is so powerful because that that book that was sealed up for many many many years carried all the way over to the New Testament John on the Isle of Patmos you know I'm going to the Isle of Patmos one day I want to see it for myself I've had many friends to go there and I want to see it for myself just a little island off of off of the nation of Turkey and I want to see the cave that's there where it is believed that John received so much of this Revelation his physical body was there but but his Spirit man was caught up to the Lord's Day you know in that something to think about John seeing 2023 this is part of the Lord's Day and he saw it and I sure would like to be there and see that place for myself what a great Revelation he received now in verse 8 and The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth now remember in Revelation chapter 5 we read it this morning the lamb the voice said the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed they're waiting John braced himself for a lion to come walking out but instead it was a lamb slain it was a bleeding lamb took the book and opened the seals thereof now we're in Revelation chapter 10 and a mighty Angel none other than the Lord Jesus Christ has come down from heaven with an open book in his hand and now the the angel is calling to John the voice that I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up I want to hear you say eat it up you know what that means it doesn't mean just take a bite it doesn't mean take a few bites and leave some for somebody else no no no he said take it and eat it up totally consume the open book God's looking for a bride in this hour who will take this word and totally eat it up consume it until it becomes a part of Who We Are and it shall make thy belly bitter anybody ever had bitter belly because of this message you're allowed to say that here you're in Alabama you can say that yes but it shall be in thy mouth read it John said and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand guess what he did he ate it up he not only chewed it he swallowed it and it was in my mouth sweet ass honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter brother the last time we had a little Fellowship weekend some of us had some bitter bellies I I never had anything hit me like that hit me and no it wasn't the hamburger patties from Sam's it was a virus and it hit so quick and it it covered so much and I called brother Greeley that I know I'm reading the scripture he understands I called brother Greeley I said or text or whatever I don't know what I was able to do will you be able to take the service right then he was feeling okay and a few minutes later he wasn't feeling too Swift either so we didn't have a service that's that's just the first time anything like that it happened but it's okay so nobody has to spend time this morning explaining how it feels when your belly gets bitter you don't want to hold that poison in you got it you got the picture and he said unto me thou must prophesy again John your work is not finished you must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings and we hold that prophecy in our hands and close to our hearts today these years later we are reading the prophecy that was given to John but that is not enough because the prophet tells us that John is a type of the Bride if John had to eat it up you and I are not going to be able to casually snack on it may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated no need in both of us standing this is not a charcuterie board [Music] are you impressed that I knew that word I've heard it called all kinds of things that's what we call a picnic some of the Yankees that have been God has added to our fellowship they call it a potluck I said I don't believe in luck I want more than a pot of luck I want something in it and Ben you know he calls me a buffet we we've all gone along and like last night we just go along point to what we want somebody puts it on our plate but I want you to know John couldn't do that and the bride can't do that there are parts of this revelation of Jesus Christ that might be a little tastier to you than others but you don't get to say let me take the good things the things I like the things that settle well because you know we've come from so many denominations in so many different backgrounds and we bring our own Creeds and our own dogmas and our own thoughts and many try to make the message fit their mold but the message is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's a mold all to itself you don't get to bring your junk in here and adjust the word we must adjust help me a little bit we must adjust to the word there's room in here for us not to all look exactly the same I love this I love this I love the fact that we all may have our little bit different way of presenting ourselves we've got all different flavors of things represented here this morning and I love it I wouldn't have I wouldn't have you to do like me but the thought of never having to wear a necktie again is very appealing to me so I might do a little bit more I've been asking them could they make me a pair of them britches like brother elam's as big as as I am well they they it take enough cloth for three Amish men to even make me a pair but imagine never having to be all cinched up in a belt again uh my wife said very politely no well we broke the message mold I broke my own mold I come from holiness where you couldn't even have any facial hair then God sends us to Israel and if you don't have any facial hair there they have no confidence in anything that comes out of your mouth and so we had to make a little adjustment and we got talked about because some people are just blessed that way everything they do draws a lot of attention but you look around this room and you see the variations there's brother Levi Yoder and he has a style of beard that comes from his past with no well really a clean face he would have done well in holiness because his face is clean his beard is here you've got brother brother elim there that has a real one and then some of us more Mennonite folk you know we trim ours up a little bit but it doesn't matter some of you aren't old enough to grow one or could I ever have you to laugh but I won't I'm not going there I'm not going there I love 's word brings us together folks I'm not just saying this to take up your time I love the fact that this word brings people together from all kinds of backgrounds and we learn to get along because the one thing we have in common is this beautiful revelation of Christ of the Lord Jesus not just a historical figure but the Living Word living inside of us revealing himself unfolding himself until the word becomes flesh again in US and every now and again we could get together and we can Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness and then be back in our regular places oh what a blessing this is but don't ever think of it as a snack we're not grazing when we approach this word we've got to eat it all anybody want to help me come on it sets an order for the family it's not a wife driven home it's not a home that's governed by the wife God has so blessed that little lady and loved her so much that he has taken all that responsibility and pressure off of her so that she can serve her family it's the highest calling that any woman could ever have to be a real mother to her children it gets looked down on him the brothers work with people who don't understand they say to them you mean your wife doesn't work you know what kind of Life can you have but you know they have found out they can have a pretty good life that way because their house becomes a home when they come home they don't come home to a house they come home to a home that's been taken care of by a woman who loves her family and pours into her children a mother who doesn't send her children down to Egypt to get their education come on she sees that it is her responsibility feels insufficient she doesn't always feel like she has the ability to do it but she yields herself because she understands that the influences of Babylon and the influences of Egypt are so harsh and so controlling that they suck our children in and I have preached for years that when God led the children of Israel out of Egypt and put them out there in the wilderness in their intents they didn't wake up their children every morning and wash their faces off and send them by bus back to Egypt I'd like a little help I'll come down here I'll get my emails because the word says you teach you teach these precepts to your children and to your children's children and bind them like frontlets [Music] you've never been in a room of so many people that understood that as you are today because I've I've driven through Place Amish places where the horses have these frontlets on their eyes so that they can go down the road and hopefully your motor car doesn't disturb them they just quickly clock that's placed there to try to keep them looking ahead you're guiding the head of a horse trying to Blind them a little bit from some of the distractions because your precious family is sitting in that buggy let me tell you the Bible tells us buying these precepts of God's word the Commandments of the Lord bind them like frontlets to our eyes so that we see his word and we steer our children and Lead our families toward truth there is no confusion in that your gender is determined by your plumbing excuse me just a moment Amen brother preach brother Shelley I believe I will it's not what you think I think I'm skinny I identify as a very skinny person that's why I can jump and move around because I identify very fit [Music] it doesn't work that that because every now and again I have to look in the mirror to comb my hair and recognize it doesn't matter how I identify how I think how I feel I'm not a kitty cat I'm not a dog I'm a man God never makes mistakes you be careful how you compromise with that spirit somebody said I got a nephew I have a niece I have a neighbor I have a loved one you show them the love of Christ you accept them as a human being but you never have to accept the choices they make or the lifestyle that they choose somebody told me just recently said my my niece is in that place where she thinks she's a boy and her mother has sent out a note on the birthday invitation to only bring boys clothes what do you think I should do I said I think you should send your regards I think you should let them know you're not coming you can you can take a tub of ice cream over later you can do something for the family you can do something that that's uh gender neutral I guess but I wouldn't ever let myself be pressured into going along with the confusion of Babylon or the influence of Egypt if the church doesn't make a stand do you see where we're headed do you see where our nation is headed we've got to stand on the word and we've got to do it with love we've got to do it with love we've got to be able to accept people as Souls we don't have to like their lifestyle we don't have to celebrate it this is not a snack we take the whole book we eat it up because it changes us forevermore now I want to talk to you I spoke last night for just a moment about the the three phases of the Rapture Shout voice of the Archangel and the last Trump that is the word coming of Christ the bride coming of Christ and the bridegroom coming of Christ but there are also a couple of phases here when this little bride typed by John we take this book we take this message you you see the message of the hour has made the Bible a a fresh book for all of us and uh we read before and didn't always understand what we were reading as I mentioned last night we thought everything was a was a a blink of an eye and we're gone we didn't understand that the Lord is coming first in the fullness of his word with a shout and then a bride is going to be raised up under that message and then the Lord is going to appear in the air to receive his bride brother random said he comes the first time to redeem his bride he comes the next time to receive his bride he comes the third time with his bride he came to Bethlehem to save and redeem his bride at Calvary he comes the next time in the air to receive his bride at the last Trump and then he's coming again and you and I are going to come with him according to Revelation chapter 19. the armies of Heaven coming with him the redeemed of the Lord and I want you to know the devil's days are numbered then aren't they in that great coming with the bride if John is a real type of the of the Bride and John had to eat the book and if the scripture said that in his mouth it was sweet as honey in his belly it was bitter and then number three he had to prophesy again then I want to propose to you today that you and I are going to have to do the very same thing there are three phases of eating the book and the book is the revealed word the seals have been loosed and as I said last night brother Branham didn't loose the seals the lamb loosed the seals the Lord Jesus Christ loosed the seals and God allowed brother Branham to catch the symbols because the book of the Revelation is a book of symbols and God allowed that servant of the Lord to get those symbols and to see past just a symbol and he began to see what was represented under those symbols and God allowed him then to take the church ages and history and lay it over top the word and church history lay that right over and it becomes this beautiful picture of the end time somebody said I don't think we have to know uh what what things are about to transpire I believe that's wrong I believe it matters how you're baptized I believe it matters how you look at God how can you say you know a God that you don't know and I believe it matters how you look at the book of the revelation and you've heard many people even even those who are not full Believers of this message who have come here and spoken as friends of mine and have told you clearly that they understand that God gave brother Branham a perfect interpretation to the book of the revelation and they know that because it fits the scripture and because of its history and you've heard them stand here and say and when I come across someone else another book about the end time or a preacher preaching on the end time I judge everything I read are you with me I judge everything I hear by what I've heard brother Branham say because I don't believe that was a man I believe that was God giving him that I challenge you to do the same I tell you today you'll be in a whole lot less confusion if you'll come back to what God has given us in this day concerning the end time their wonderful fellowships out there I love the Pentecostals I love the charismatics I love some of their passion I love some of the things they teach and some of the things they understand but I don't believe the bride is being perfected by that I believe we can be encouraged sometime by that are you with me yes but I don't believe that there's any other message to perfect the bride of Christ than the revelation of Jesus that that we have received underneath the book that was one sealed the scroll is now re opened up and and we can see into that book I believe that our name is brother Greeley pointed out and in the song it said there's a name written and brother Greeley pointed out that it's not a new name it's been written there this not written there the nights you get saved it was written there since before the foundation of the world but I want you to know I believe the Lamb's roll call is going to be a whole lot shorter than that eyes I don't believe the lamb is going to have to call every name my goodness how many yoders are there in the world how many Millers are there in the world how many Fishers are there in the world why we would be there and take it take ten thousand years or more to get through the alphabet of all the Bride of all the church ages but I have a revelation from the word that you're not going to have to worry about your old name when you get there because to the Overcomer they're going to receive a new name I may not know every detail about it but I know part of it you're going to be standing there waiting on the Shelly to be called or Jesse to be whatever your names are uh uh Alias how do you say your last name well how many last names do you have well give me both of them yeah yeah I can't say either one of them I've been calling him Chaka no no it's not wrong it's not wrong it's it's either that or nothing I I I'll just say brother Elias uh you could never get through the roll call but you know what you'll be standing there waiting on Smith Jones like we did in school here present anybody ever been in an old calling School then there was always a smart alec I believe it was probably some of you president every other sent here and there was always that one usually a boy president you're gonna be way and it's not going to take eternity to call their own the lamb will just say we will now have the wrong call Mrs Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] your name is there don't you worry your name is there but in eternity you won't have to go buy your own worn out Earthly name you have a new name and you have a new identity you are now the Lamb's wife you are not just as a spouse bride you are his wife and you carry the full authority of Heaven didn't brother Branham tell us we come to that hour before we get there where your name on the check you just signed Mrs Jesus Christ into full authority of the banks an economy of Heaven is at your disposal when you step into that place of full adoption it's the TR are you with me it's the transition from uh this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell and over here the transition finishes and the voice says this is my beloved Son hear ye him when you come to Salvation when you come to this message of Truth God is pleased to dwell in you the same thing that was said about our Lord in his Earthly baptism could be said about you this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell but you have to go through some stuff you've got to eat it up you know I know people that have been following this Truth for 25 years never made it through the revelation of Jesus Christ series there was something before a church age book the actual sermons that went forth the revelation of Jesus Christ series if there's anybody here and you don't have access to it we have it on MP3 disc you can have we'll give it to you and you can go through those original Church ages but they're also on the app you can go through those original Church ages if you say that this is your message and you are a part of this bride and you don't take the opportunity when you can to eat that then you're no more than a snacker boy I didn't get no help you're no more than a snacker you go ahead I'll tell you there's going to be those who come in in the last hour that eat it all while you're still trying to figure out which tape to listen to while you're still trying to find title that appeals to you there's going to be a people that come in in the 11th Hour that are willing to eat it up because they realize that it changes us out of the vile image of the Flesh and into the new image of Christ he ate it up and in the eating of that book there are three phases that not only apply to John they apply to you it's going to be sweet in your mouth just like when one eats a food in the natural the first stage is putting the piece of food in your mouth and by the way sometimes we take way too much at a time you you can't properly digest what you don't chew properly this is not a an etiquette lesson but nobody is going to take the plate it's going to be there I catch myself sometimes eating in a hurry it's the most dangerous thing you can do for your own digestive system you you take a bite you you chew it up you don't have time to do that while you're in church because I'm giving you a buffet so says brother being you don't have time to chew at all that's why you can go back and catch it again I'm telling you listen to brother Brandon first you that are way behind in listening to The Prophet's message with his own voice you that are way behind you listen to him I don't care whether you ever hear a message that I preach or not I'm not I'm not here promoting what I've said but I'm telling you that just hearing at one time it's not digesting at all it's getting little pieces like brother Greeley was talking about but when we go back we're at a different place in our life we're thinking differently something shifted in our circumstances and sometimes we hear a message and it's entirely different to us and sometimes around here we say well what not sitting in that service how did I miss all of that because you can only choose so much at a time and remember you can't chew at all when you're sleeping preach on brother we need to get us some good Amish deacons in here is what we need with a big stick and a knob on the end like the pilgrims or something to wake some folks up sometime you cannot chew while you're asleep you'll choke but God has let us preserve these truths so that we can go back and we can take a abide and you know what I believe that food is to is to sustain and nourish and strengthen our body but there's nothing wrong with enjoying the taste of food that doesn't mean because the one piece of cake is good you can eat the whole cake but have you ever just had something so nice that you really wanted to slow down and enjoy the flavor and you just chewed it and really really tasted it that's that's required when we're talking about feasting on the word of the hour you just enjoy the flavor and The Taste and just like your natural food the spiritual food can be the same way and this phase in the bride is when the restored word is first partaken of and you first come into the message of the hour or you first start revisiting the the message that you say you believe it's a time of excitement it's a Time of Wonder it's a time of energy it's a time of sweetness the word tastes so good how many of you have ever feasted on a message and you thought that was so good now remember everybody doesn't doesn't feel the way you feel the two men that went into here brother Branham and one come out and said I don't like that man very much he called me a buzzard and the other man come out he said I love that man's preaching he called me an eagle same sermon two men one identified with a buzzard one identified with an eagle there are times that we can identify with a particular message more than others but it's all good for us the Bible said in Psalm 34 8 O taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him the new truths the new doctrines that we begin to hear become so fascinating when you've grown up your whole life believing that that Eve ate a banana or an apple or an apricot I read a whole scientific uh article some years ago that said no no it wasn't an apple it was an apricot and we're going to have to prove it we they go through all these scientific facts to help prove that it was an apricot brother random said if it were apples and eating those apples would help women to know they're naked pass the apples but it was so much more than that it was a seed of discrepancy there was something more vile than the natural Act I don't believe it's healthy for us to focus only on the natural part of the ACT because you didn't received the seed of discrepancy today without a natural Act of intimacy you receive a lie into the womb of your spirit this is what Eve did she received a lie into the womb of her spirit and it was mostly truth just a small portion of lie and that's all it takes to sow a seed of discrepancy into her life that caused her to doubt and to reason about the goodness of God if the enemy can bring you into a dark place and into a trial and you begin to wonder if God is really good you're in the same dangerous place that Eve was in it will be easy for you to receive a seed of discrepancy let me tell you today God is good let me look at you God is good God is all together good he is all together lovely my brother from Ohio said to me last night there are no mistakes God makes no mistakes [Music] that's one thing to say that when everything has always been good and you've been on a bed of ease but when you're standing in a tragedy like he was sharing with me and you can say there are no accidents in God you are shutting off the womb of your mind to any lie of reasoning that Satan would like to shoot you full of every time your answer is praise every time your response is hallelujah every time you say God is good all the time he's all together lovely he's sovereign [Music] every time you praise him and I don't like to say praise the Lord anyhow I know a lot of people I don't like to say praise the Lord anyhow because praise is not a half-hearted expression you don't have to say anyhow leave the anyhow off of it and when the bill is not yet paid you don't have to say anyhow you can just say praise the Lord my provider when the when the when the heart is breaking when the loss is great when the grief is deep and you can just raise your hands and say praise the Lord when the wounds are bleeding and the stripes are stinging but like Paul and Silas you can raise up your hands anyway and say praise the Lord every time you focus on the goodness of God and refuse to allow the enemy to shoot you full of poison and reasoning every time you do that you're saving yourself from a whole lot of heartache and trouble because when this mind starts reasoning against the word we'll never win somebody say we'll never win it's the same kind of thing that keeps people out of God's house they say well there's too many Hypocrites there and everybody talks about me you know what I would tell you this if you let a hypocrite keep you out of church the hypocrite stands closer to God than you do the Bible said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a man or some is and he said we ought to be together more as we see the day approaching not less come on now me am I out of the word you're not here to snack you're here to swallow all of it's good don't you let your excuses get in your way because there is an atmosphere where we can get and we receive the word and the different attitude when we get under the atmosphere brother random said it's all about atmosphere remember I read this last weekend he said it's he said I don't like joking in the Pulpit but but he said I'm going to tell this little thing that brother Bosworth used to say he said you can take a chicken egg and put it under a dog and hatch it out the egg doesn't know that that's not his Mammy it doesn't require the mother the DNA to hatch the egg it just requires the right atmosphere when we come together in corporate praise there is an atmosphere that is created that causes the word of God to go deeper into our inner beings am I too loud this morning sweet when we first get it all these new things Original Sin may not be exciting but it explains a whole lot it explains why it had to be blood instead of a fruit salad hello I used to preach a message under the tents when I traveled under the tents and I called it you can't get blood out of a turnip have you ever heard your mama say something like that you can't get blood out of a turnip well you know what Cain found out he brought the fruit of the ground I wished I had some help this morning he brought some fruit of the ground he brought beautiful vegetables to before the Lord but that wasn't what God was after he hadn't have nothing wrong with he's not against corn and turnips and anything like that pumpkins or whatever you have God's not against that but that's not what he wants is an offering it has to be blood because of original sin nobody told Abel that the Bible said Abel received that by Revelation brother Branham taught us that he heard the same stories that Cain heard but Abel received a revelation that it had to be blood to me it's kind of like a pounding you know we don't call it that anymore because it sounds a little violent but we used to call it a pounding and we would say you know bring groceries for a family not so that you could pound them with them but so you could bless them and there are there are all kinds of people in a little Church community and there are going to be those who take the name brand right off the front Shelf and they're going to be those that reach way to the back come on oh I'm preaching now [Music] because they're not cheerful givers they figure they figure well if they can if if if I can eat off-brand peas they can eat off brand peas yeah but you're you're pulling from the back of them off brand peas and missing those nice uh well let me just say this you're not going to get it I I only like one brand of of store-bought canned I don't like a lot of that stuff we don't eat a lot of canned store-bought vegetables but I only like one brand of English peas I hear you saying the brand I heard somebody just then whisper the brand if they're not fresh there's only one brand that I like I don't like those big old marbles they call English peas they taste green if I wanted grass I'd go out in the front yard for my lunch I like those little English peas early one that tastes so tender and so nice some of you don't like peas I can tell they taste so nice well now when it comes time for me to share peace with somebody I'm not going to give them anything that I wouldn't want to have for myself I'm not going to give them the 10 for a dollar can knowing that I only like one kind cost a little more I want them to have this is the truth and you better get this way God help me to be this way strengthen me to be this way I want to be able to share that Cain brought the best vegetables that he had but God wasn't after turnips Abel said the most precious thing to me is not a turnip but I've got a little pet lamb of all my sheep there's one that means the most to me I think he might have been a little runt or something Abel treated that little lamb like a member of the family almost held him in his lap it come time to give God an offering he didn't take the old mean stubborn sheep in his foe he said I've got to give God the best to me the best is my little lamb here that I've loved so much and brother Branham said he took some Grapevine dried Grapevine down and made him a little rope and put it around the Lamb's neck and let that lamb over to the altar had it been about a piece of fruit Cain's offering would have been enough but original sin was about blood able understood that it has to be a living offering because the New Testament would teach us that your bodies are to be presented as a Living Sacrifice a living offering unto God the prophet said he reached over and took a sharp piece of Flintstone and drew that little lamb up under his arm and he began to strike against the jugular vein of that lamb and when those main arteries were severed that blood began to spurred and A Tear began to run down Abel's face giving God the most precious thing to him and not only did The Little Lamb's wool become bloody so did the worshiper every heartbeat of that lamb pumped that blood all over Abel's robe and he looked like he'd been to war and God looked down and said it started this way and it's going to have to end this way because this little lamb was was a type of another lamb that would come a bloody Lamb slain before before Abel ever existed before there ever was an Abel there was a bloody lamb in the mind of God in that powerful and so he offered the right thing by Revelation you start eating on that a bit and you get that original sin down you start finding out that God is not three people it's so sweet in your mouth anybody who can remember that far back let me see your hand if you can remember how sweet the godhead was when God began to reveal it to you water baptism when you found out you had never been baptized the right way in Christian baptism you wanted to get to that water and be baptized and it was like you've been serving the lord all your life but you feel like a newborn baby that day because you were doing it right because you were doing it by Revelation and it is so sweet and so easy to enjoy and everything is so inspirational the Mysteries start being revealed and opened up in the message the anointed ones at the end time paragraph 262. brother Brown said notice the very day when this messenger when he starts on when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing the second pull prophesying third pool the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than Prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated it's not by clouds [Music] I'm going to preach till I'm done you might as well help me because you're not eating lunch until I'm finished Uber squeeze out little amen it's not because there was a Halo or a pillar of fire picture over his head I want to be honest with you I know the pillar of fire was there [Music] I know it was there whether he was photographed or not I know the pillar of fire was there I've seen the pillar of fire and I believe with all my heart that the pillar of fire was there that day hanging over by the Bantam and so now that they write articles about uh fluorescent lights and and all kinds of things that could have made it look like I don't care I want you to know today I don't care my soul is not Based On A Photograph I don't believe this message because there was a cloud somebody said what if that was Jesus Christ I know I'm not following a cloud when brother Perry green got off the plane in the Congo they came up to him and asked him are you one of those cloud worshipers because in Congo there are tens of thousands of believers who worship that picture who bow their knee to that picture they see that little image of Jesus in there and they use that like a Catholic icon you don't have to say a word I'm laying this out for you we don't Pastor that all over our walls even though we believe it's a supernatural sign but we're not following a cloud we are not worshiping a cloud picture it's not the signs and the Wonders and the Miracles and the discernment that we're after we're after the opening of the word and we're taking this message and laying it in the word we're checking it out because that's what he told us to do how many times did he say don't take my word for it it has to Dove tail with this word we're your amens now tale with this word so it's not signs and wonders and we believe it yes yes yes brother Shelly do you believe there's a voice that spoke out at the baptism and said as we I believe it with all my heart but that doesn't make me follow this message because the Bible doesn't say Believers will follow the signs the Bible says signs thank you sister Anna the Bible said signs will follow the Believers we ought to be so used to signs and wonders that we just say praise God praise God and keep going we ought to be a people but if the pillar of fire come and hung in this room as it has before and open our eyes were opened and people were able to see that Pillar of Fire hanging there it's only been just a few Services ago that someone sent me a clip and showed me what looked like a light appearing up there when and flashing like that we ought to be so so used to those things because we're Believers and signs follow Believers that we just give God praise and keep on going come on Church what's wrong with us we've gotten used to having no signs and no wonders but I want to see whatever God wants us to see hallelujah it's a supernatural message that we believe we're serving a supernatural God we're Supernatural people we don't have to follow visions of bridges and what if history doesn't bear it out I'm not I'm not following the history book I've had people challenge me before and tell me you're wrong I'm used to it and you know what the uses their source Wikipedia said you couldn't be preaching it right Wikipedia said and I said let me show you who Wikipedia is it's all the idiots in the world a few brainiacs thrown in a bunch of doofuses anybody can edit Wikipedia did you know that did you know you can go into Wikipedia and change an article you know an article can get changed multiple times a day did you know there are not many fact Checkers at work for Wikipedia and did you know they're always asking for money I said I'm not giving you a penny to give me bad information somebody said I read something negative about brother Branham do a search on Stephen Shelley [Music] Elliot sent me a article of a vision of of Patriarchs coming out of a well that I was supposed to have my name is on it it circulated all around the internet and I had nothing to do with it never saw it it was Neville Johnson a friend of mine who's dead but it went around with my name on it and there were people around the message that said he's lost it now finally he's lost it and I've had very unusual visions and I've seen the Patriarchs in the spirit and I'm telling you that out of my mouth now you don't have to read about it on Wikipedia and what I believe is the bride ought to be seeing Vision we ought to be seeing in the spirit and we can if we position ourselves to do so hello but you can't trust it because Google said it my goodness how many people have come through a prayer line asked me to pray for them and then told me what Google said they had are you going to listen to Dr Google are you going to come to the throne and believe that God can heal you you self-diagnosing somebody all you do it when you do that is looking for a place for fear to Lodge shut the door somebody said I can pray better when I have a name for it call it a devil you don't have to call it cancer You Don't Have To Call It by its official name just call it a devil and let's believe God to see the Miracles so we love these stories I met people who said I can't follow this message because there was no Silver Tip grizzly foreign there's been many Silverton Grizzlies anytime a Grizzly gets old his hair starts to turn gray on the tips there's been many they said that brother Branham said he was going to kill one and and he didn't get to kill that one and knowing he explains it he got swayed by the weather and the brethren that's all and he said it went right through me I wonder how many things have gone right through us because we said we were waiting on it but we never positioned ourselves to receive it and so somebody said I can't believe the message because there was a vision there that didn't come to pass like it was supposed to come to pass I want you to know I'm not following this message because brother Branham had a vision I saw my first Vision at 18 months old I'm not following this message because brother random saw a vision or because a voice spoke out of heaven and said your message is going to forerun the second coming Christ I believe it I believe it but that's not why I'm following this truth I'm following this truth because I can take this word that that we have on on tape I can hear it and I can read it and then I can take it over here and lay it in the word of God and watch how it dovetails and I know how sweet it gets in my mouth [Music] or taste and see the Lord is good and then I have been around long enough that it eventually gets down the esophagus and it gets to the belly people say things like you're a brand of Mite and starts feeling bitter and you're following a dead man and I'd always tell them everybody is he died before he lived I said Jesus was dead for three days you're going to quit following him and then they start saying that old serpent Seed doctrine that's of the devil I can't fellowship with people who don't believe hell is eternal I don't want anything to do with people that and don't they know that brother Brandon was the last prophet there will never be five-fold prophets anymore and they'll never be the gifts are done away with because the perfect all the stuff we've heard through the years and the belly starts getting so bitter and they put you in and they and they put you out and they put you in and they put you out and they take you in and they put you out it seems so much like a denomination and you know what the bride does she just keeps her eyes on the word he puts him front let's on her eyes and she keeps following Jesus focusing on Jesus Christ she's not following this truth because of a Wikipedia article she's not following this truth because of a vision of a bridge or a picture of a cloud or somebody got healed or didn't get healed well I hear people saying that every person brother Brandon prayed for got healed that's not what brother random said I can show you an article written by a man who claims to have been in the meeting and did not receive his healing do you think I'm going to let that one testimony that one book that will sit around among the United Pentecostal Church you think I'm going to let that one thing dissuade me from what my heart is telling me when I take this word back to the word somebody said did you know he told a story one time and put the wrong name there I'd like for you to find me somebody that's been preaching as long as he did that hasn't made that mistake brother random did not have the gift of perfect recall many gifts were operating in his life so I'm telling you if you get to the place that you want to find vault there will be fault to find if you want to reason you can reason and if you're looking for an excuse come see me because I can give you reasons and excuses why you should run the other way but if you are willing to stick with the word that bitter belly is there for a reason we are being shaped and molded and sculpted cracked We are Becoming crack pots because every vessel of Honor has to pass through the testing of the bitter belly phase those who are of another seed will never survive the bitter belly phase they'll fall by the wayside but there's going to be a people who finish they're not going to be puffed up with bride Pride they're not going to be puffed up I'm predestinated they're not going to be like that little girl so many years ago at the Ohio camp whatever it was 90 something in the early 90s who walked up to I said well sweetheart where do you go to church I think she's the one who told me that she couldn't hate the devil she said I just can't hate the devil she said my preacher's been telling me all to just hate the devil and and I just don't find it in my heart to hate him I said I hate him enough for both of us there are some things we ought to hate sin is one of them unbelief is one of them God hates some things oh yes he does he hates lying tongues [Applause] he hates those who saw Discord among the brethren there are some things you said to write in the book I said well honey you can hate the devil and be all right you can hate him and stay away from him I said if you don't like something you stay away you run as fast you can I said by the way who is your pastor she said brother Branham I said honey whatever do you mean she said yes he's my pastor you said our our we have a whole group and brother Brandon is our pastor I said well sweetheart brother Branham is dead who kisses the babies come on who buries the Dead who takes the midnight phone calls who spends their life on their knees praying who untangles the messes who pulls Brothers off of Brothers and Sisters of the sisters of time who settles the masses among you oh well well we have a minister there are people who get so out of balance and it doesn't make me want to get out of balance it makes me want to keep my balance in the scripture this word is the absolute tapes can only be an absolute when they line up with the word [Music] when the prophet preached he didn't preach from his own knowledge his own quotes his own sermon thoughts his favorite quote book he didn't go to the next sermon and say brother Brandon said brother random say it if he was going to quote it he said the word say it the Bible said you're going to have to get through that bitter belly stage that next state I'm closing in a moment that next stage wow how did it get to be 142. somebody said well it followed 141 that's how the next stage of partaking of the truth the food is uh it's so enjoyable and tastes so good it gets down in the stomach that's where the foods is digested and the acids start forming it goes through the main process of becoming part of you something's got to break down the food oh we really overwork our bellies don't we something's got to kick the fillers out the dies something's got to deal with the chemicals in the Plastics that we're eating because your food can't digest all that dye and all that stuff and so we're working and the acids are working and the digestive system is working and it starts it starts affecting you sometimes this is a stage that cannot be impersonated you can't just hang around the message and get through this you've got to swallow it all because when that word gets down in there and you start digesting it you start having to die out to self you have you have to start seeing yourself as you really are and your character starts developing you start ripening and changing and you start understanding that the Rapture is only for the overcomer Revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame it and sat down with my father and his throne and you start thinking Lord God I've got to overcome I've got to overcome I can't let any I don't care how bitter this gets sometime I don't know how I don't care how much against what I've been taught this gets sometime I don't care I don't care I don't care this is against what my daddy taught me My mama taught me different my church taught me different my pastor taught me different My Bishop taught me different My denomination taught me different but something tells me that I'm growing in the word [Music] so I'm going to keep eating now I'm going to keep depending on my spirit man to break it down to digest it to separate fact from fiction and I'm going to overcome and somebody said what do I have to overcome well it's real simple and it's real complicated it's not the drinking it's not the smoking give me just a minute and clean up let me clean up just a minute and I don't want the microphone to start shorting it's not the drinking smoking boy I came from Holiness and everything with sin no watch no ring no short sleeve no no sandal no open shoe no you that go barefoot you'd have been put out yeah not here we need you to help clean the carpet sister Jennifer's glad for you to come help clean the carpet like I told you the one preacher preached against Coca-Cola and he wanted to Double Cola to go with his chocolate cake one one church Preach you have to wear a hat the Sunday church one said it's a sin to wear it one said it's Pride not to and one said it was Pride too One Church said you can cut your hair as a woman as long as you put it under a covering and the other one said no you've got to have it long and the Bible said it's given you for recovery nobody could agree on anything and then I came to this message one day brother dawn and I was listening this sermon and brother Brandon said there's only one I laughed out loud I said to all that man I'm telling you he's missed it now they preached the sisters could only wear a round collar no they could wear a pointed collar no they couldn't have any collar the women were so confused they just about wore gunny sacks I remember you can't cut the back but you can cut the front that's why they all look like they had rooftops built up there on the front like an awning or something looks ridiculous you know Pentecostal poofs that were were chopped off you got even brother Branham can confuse you sometimes he's talking about putting manicure on your eyes and then one day I heard him say it's not smoking it's not cheating these are the attributes of sin it's unbelievable I said oh we gotta rewind this I've got to check this by the book there was no digital rewind it means stop rewind stop play no matter how many times I did it I could never get brother Branham to say that all these things were sin he kept saying it over and over again as I listen it's unbelief the rest are the attributes of unbelief you wouldn't struggle with what you struggle with if you could once and for all deal with the unbelief oh God help us somebody said I'm a Believer there's no unbelief in me let me tell you something though the man in the Bible said Lord I believe help thou my unbelief unbelief will creepy and help me doubts will creep in and you and I have to push them down every time because if we don't they will lead to the attributes of sin and we'll be picking up the habits and things of this world wait till I tell you I'm I'm coming to an end you that drove a mile to get here I'm preaching these that come a long way in a message called how can I overcome brother random tells you what you've got to overcome come on Cheaters read it don't wait on me to read it read it wish I could overcome that drinking I wish I could overcome that that wondering eye you can't you can you must you quit watching these sisters if you're a married man you look at your wife you quit looking at other people's your sister's mind the way you walk and mine the way you dress mind the way you carry yourselves and you men get you some bigger clothes because we don't want to do anything that would put a stumbling block in our brother's way when I preach those youth camps they didn't I didn't get to preach them too many times because I told some of those young girls you heard the prophet preach against uh high-heeled shoes so you all wear flats and I've never seen a more creative bunch of swingers and swayers it takes some effort to sway your hips in a pair of flats but I saw that spirit you can have the right kind of shoe wear preach brother and the wrong kind of spirit so sometimes we spend more time preaching on the kind of shoe to wear and we ought to be trying to deal with the spirit that causes a young woman to think that that's the way to catch a man's attention it's not all these little things that we have to overcome there's one big thing you have to overcome read it out Nathan is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him period and then watch the next sentence you've just got to stay in fellowship with the overcomer Jesus overcome for you so stay as close to him as you possibly can grab a hold of him and don't you let anybody talk you into letting go lay your head on his chest and listen to his heartbeat All In Love With Jesus Christ and love him more than you love yourself and you can overcome this wicked world and you can settle the indigestion in your spirit man bitterness speaks of death it's a hard stage where we have to die to self but it's in this stage that the that the character of Jesus Christ is in the people I'm nearly done how many times have I said that if I was telling the truth every time nearly nearly is a relative word I'm nearly done God hiding himself in Simplicity paragraph 14. he said now think it I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people brother brother Levi I know that's what you want to build is a place that's consecrated to the Lord I know that's what you Indiana Saints are constructing as a place I know that's what you folks there in Ohio what what you want is it is is is a place dedicated to to displaying the character of Jesus Christ for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church read it for me I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty in the church age book he said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign that's part of this oh that preacher got me that preacher knows something about me somebody told him what I was saying out there before service it makes our Billy our bit our billies makes our goats so much better makes our belly so bitter when we I get texts all the time did he tell you did she say something to you someone said just a couple weeks ago and said three things that were talked about in our home last night you preached all three of them were you listening in on us this is how God works would you want to come to a service and be so disconnected from all of it that you've got nothing at all out of it no you won't God have you ever asked Jesus to come to your house that's what he's doing when the word comes nigh you the reason he said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is the character simply musicians are coming I'm just speeding now the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is it's not a gift you're not going to just have character granted to you because you believe a message of truth you're gonna have to go through the fire you're going to have to go through the bitter belly you're going to have to go through spiritual indigestion sometime while you're trying to break this word down and live it on an everyday basis character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't drain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule are you willing to go through some more times of bitter belly syndrome if it'll bring you out on the other side with a character that's fit to rule with power and authority now I'm going to read this because this is what I wanted to get to it took me all this two hours to get here we need a Zeal in the land we need a Zeal in the church let me tell you what kind of zeal it comes from the laodicean church age the church age book be zealous and repent he said now this false church has zeal can you give me your undivided attention for just a few more minutes now this false church has zealed make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews John 2 17 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they're building something for themselves he said they have put the word out for their own ideas they deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person Jesus and make it about good works or even Church Conformity rather than good works but here's the Zeal the bride's got to have right now right now right now but God is calling for another zeal it is the Zeal to cry you whispered it I am wrong and God Is Right and I need to meet him [Applause] my ways are wrong my ideas are wrong my church entity is wrong but God's word is right I look out across this congregation and I see some who need to be delivered and we have prayed for you and prayed for you and prayed for you and prayed for you as a body we've laid hands on you we've tried to cast The Devil out of you we've done everything we know to do to see you free and you are not free what you need to catch this morning as I close is you are constantly to this day making excuses for your wrong Behavior and you are blaming other people including your pastor you say for your sin there are things on that are a water under the bridge you cannot undo the mess you made there's one thing I've learned about eggs you better get your order right when Mama's at the stove because once you say scrambled there ain't no sunny side up fried eggs mama can adjust it if you catch her in time if you need a little lighter or a little sunnier or a little done I don't know why anybody would want to eat a fried egg well done because you like rubber but I like mine with some juice and if you really want to talk lunch you put that on a burger and you let that golden beautiful stuff run down over that oh my god let's close but once they're scrambled sometimes my wife will say honey uh fried or scrambled and I'll say whichever is easier and she said well it really doesn't matter but she knows I'd rather have fried sometimes I insist on Scrambled to make it a little little because you can cook for everybody at one one time instead of making everybody individual ones but once those eggs are scrambled you can't come back and say no I believe I won't mind pull to the side and fried sunny side up and sometimes we scramble Our Lives by our own foolish decisions and then we expect other people to unscramble the eggs that we scrambled and it makes us somehow feel closer to God by making excuses for who made us do what we did but I'm telling you you do not I've asked God many times why some of you can't be free and I realize you're missing the right kind of zeal you can Praise Him you've got passion you you Faithful you come but you're missing something vital this morning and I'm telling you because I love you you are missing the grace I am wrong my religion has failed me I am wrong and God Is Right and I'm tired of blaming my my mama my daddy my brother my sister my old church my old Pastor my old Bishop my wife I'm tired of blaming my children for the life I'm living I am wrong now brother Brandon said now who's going to say that he is wrong what is it that all these denominations are based upon they claim to originality and that of God the the claim that they're right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they're white it's sepulchers full of dead men's bones they have no life they have no Vindication God never made himself known in any organization let's keep it loose let's don't organize it so God goes out he'll move out he'll move right out be very careful you can Church order God right out of the building I know message people that'll click to every claim and cling to every paragraph and every comma in church order [Music] and they will ignore all 500 quotes that tell us we need tongues and interpretation and Gifts in the church but they'll hang to one paragraph one quote because it suits their lifestyle and they they know that a church where the gifts operate is a cleaner Church [Music] just a minute Amen brother Shelley amen amen amen they need the Vindicated thus saith the Lord of God and they don't have it is that it he goes on but I don't think we have to go on with every bit of that God is calling in this hour for even you and I who follow the word to have another zeal not a Zeal to pray more we need to pray more not a Zeal to dance more we need to dance more but a Zeal to scream in his presence get on your knees before this day is over in the privacy of your home go find you there's 60 Acres of woods here it's not all Woods you go find you a spot you go find you a pine tree and you get down by that pine tree and you scream at the top of your lungs until you interrupt the volleyball game I am but God I Surrender yeah and he'll hear you you get up from that spot where the determination never to blame anybody else for the life you're living today we are not puppets you know what one of the precious little children in this church asked their parent this week are we like toys to God I can tell some of you aren't grandparents I'm just an adopted grandparent but I thought that was the most wonderful thing I'd ever heard we're not puppets this would be my answer no darling we're not like puppets where God is pulling the string but yes we are like toys to God in many ways because when we're children and we get a new little Purdy to play with we're not old enough to know that you don't love things you love people and we get those little pets or we get those little toys and we love them so much and we're so proud to have them and to hold them and to cherish them and I in in that way we're just like that to God the word in the scripture says we are A peculiar people that word peculiar is a word that comes from segula and the word secular is the most prized possession King we are his secular his most prized possession he loves us he wants to help us could we stand Benjamin come lead us in worship if I had a trophy I would hand them out and thank you for all your help today before sitting through this preaching father

before the Lord Lord here we are as soon as the burden of that word lifts off of me and I look across this congregation they look like the most perfect people that anybody could ever see when the burden of the word of the Lord is here sometimes it's rough but when that lifts and I looked across this room I just saw the beauty of the Lord on the Lord's beloved he loves you he loves you with an unconditional love he doesn't love you because you obey him he loved you before you were ever born he loved you when you were just a thought in his mind and he is for you and not against you he wants to call you into closer fellowship with him Lord we have spread our arms before you today to say we are wrong there's so many times that we're just wrong and I'm so glad that you don't just kick us you don't just sling us to the side because we're wrong you woo us and you draw us and you love us and you shine your light and you show us the way and so we spread our arms before you with holy hands and we thank you for your great grace would you thank him right now for the grace that he shows you in your everyday life would you tune us like instruments in your Symphony tune us Lord until the only sound that comes out of us is your sound let us be salty [Music] let us be filled with your light to a world that's dying may we come to love one another as you have loved us [Music] if you're here and you have a special need I want you just to lift your hand where you are you have a special need if there's someone around you would you just turn toward these that have a hand lifted up if you have a special need you just got your hand up see these see our young sister here and let the saints of God Minister one to another for just a moment your prayers are powerful your prayers are potent lay your hands on one another right now Lord I'm asking you to meet these needs some need healing some need some victory over the Mind battles some need to be able to feel your presence they struggle to surrender they find it difficult to yield show us how to yield Lord show us how to quit trying so hard and and yield to your presence everything that you have called us to be [Music] in the name of Jesus Lord you see these that lifted their hands and had needs I ask you to minister directly to these needs in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatever they are Minister healing push back the darkness the depression and those who stand here in need of leadership let the voice of the Lord be stronger and louder than the other voices that try to crowd our minds in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus brother Levi Yoder while there's a spirit of prayer here would you come and tell us about this prayer request that you presented to brother Greeley or I could read it but why don't you just tell it this is something we want to pray for as a body yes this morning as I felt that the Lord is here I just was reminded there's a lady in Amish lady in savemore Missouri who started reading about the life of William Branham she told me when I saw the song only believe for the first time in my life it just started ringing in my mind as I was about work she wrote me this letter and she said that after a while the lord gave me a tune for this song and I began to sing it and then I wondered is there anywhere attuned to this song and she looks through a himmel until she found the chorus and she said that the tune was almost exactly like she was singing and then her grandson was born I think an eighth child to her daughter and he was born with deformity on his head and the chiropractor said it's a very bad case he does not know whether it can be fixed it can be fixed or not but it's going to be very bad if it does not straighten out so she said that she just she was not planning on continuing to write me letters but she wrote me saying that the Lord put it on her heart that we can just believe for this healing and I just need to write you and ask you to ask all your friends such as pray and pray and pray for her grandchild and she said that he his name is Baby Petey which is Peter maybe Peter so she just asked for all my friends to pray and this morning that got on my heart and I just asked you all your own with this oh Jesus you just use precious Heavenly Father this this uh grandmother's heart was moved by you and Lord the deep is calling to the Deep Lord you revealed to me that it's not because that she wants that baby to be healed but it's because she wants you to be Vindicated in her family yes Lord Lord manifest yourself you said these signs shall follow them to believe and she believes and she believes that we believe Lord allow your sign to follow according to your promise and your word we just believe for a complete healing holy God hallelujah thank you Jesus we praise you we thank you we glorify your name Hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah just touch the baby touch the family touch the parents touch the grandparents and neighbors the community may this be your day Lord may this be your sign yes Lord may you have your perfect way may your sheep hear your voice yes Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let's go hold it one one moment brother deodorant these other brothers brother Elam they're humble brothers who don't brag and they're doing some things these These are precious people who are doing a work I I would like for him to lead us in prayer for the Amish communities I want to mention again the Millers who are here from Missouri the first time that they ever came they were they checked into a motel here at for camp meeting and they were treated terribly they were carrying in some of their food or something in the and the motel was offended by that and they were they thought it was something it wasn't and they treated them so bad and it it upset me so bad I wouldn't have had that to happen to them for nothing I fell in love with them and we talked for hours I sat in wet clothes after baptizing them and God gave them to this ministry as a seed of what he wanted to do and it gave me so much encouragement to keep praying for the Amish people and now we've met so many precious people that God has brought out and and I'll be honest with you Brethren I've told you I don't want people to leave the Amish faith and end up in another backslid denomination I don't want them to look like the modern Pentecostal world I want them to come to the message of the hour the truth for them and I believe there's a big bride I believe there is a many membered bride in the Amish and the Mennonite World among our anabaptist brethren and I felt led brother Elam you come over here all of you brothers that have come all of you that have come out of the Amish community some of them you'd never know you you you're looking at them you'd never know where they come from but I want these brothers to agree brother the older has the mic and then let brother elim pray too but would you all just do this for me you know some of you know how dear these people have been to me and I want us to ask the Lord to bring more out and in we don't want them just out we want them in to reveal the message and they're giving the the church in Ohio as has provided I think some Supernatural books brother Chad Lamb and the people there are providing they're the ones who reprinted the supernatural books and they're they're giving them to be given and there are Brethren here today that are believing the truth because brother Levi took him the supernatural books there's a sister here whose dad he didn't read this that's what we give people we want to break them in gentle we give them the supernatural books but somebody but you he took the church age book and he and there's a lot in the church age book that's a lot different than than most churches and he grabbed a hold of that and it spoke to him and it ministered to him and helped him so much so we just need to leave this up to God don't we how it gets witnessed pray brother like you actually share with us a little bit about sharing of the supernatural books I had this on my heart for over a year that I would like to advertise these books in a Amish newspaper oh I didn't know and and I was I was wanting to do it and I didn't quite understand why I don't just do it but I didn't just do it until one morning as I woke up this was just on my heart like you need to do it now and I said okay Lord now you asked me to do it when I really don't have the finances to do it but you said do it so we'll do it and that day brother Chad Lamb came to our house was a brother from Poland I can't quite say his I can't either but I know who you're talking about uh and and he and and I told them about that that I woke up the morning lord said do it and I didn't tell them that I was lacking Finance I said I'm just gonna do it I knew I could at least do a little bit right so um these brothers brother Jan and brother yasick brother yasik from Poland uh we're getting ready to leave and brother Yazi pulled some cash out and puts it in my hand and I don't look at he says this is for advertising those about these Supernatural books I put it in my pocket after he leaves it's 300 cash from Poland praise God and so I I go into the paper that afternoon I get these advertised and because of that advertisement they're Supernatural books in quite a few different states different parts of New York different parts of Pennsylvania different parts of Missouri and I can't quite name off all the different states Illinois there's one in uh there's an English man that read this Amish paper and ordered them out of uh what was that state you remember you know what was it Utah Utah Nevada yeah it was in Nevada and and he uh so they so what I advertised was just the first volume and then in that when we sent that volume out right through to church I don't even see the books they send them out when I asked them to we send out a paper showing that there's more available so he ordered more and he called me and talked to me my phone number's on the on the order form and he said is there any churches around today that believe this and I said there sure is and so we're still in contact you ordered more books and there's quite a few reorders of these books and it's not just one area it's not so there's people everywhere thank you Lord for the word going praying for truce and so let's just be encouraging yeah these people the word is spreading and I have felt the Lord putting in my heart it's time to put out more advertising just now not just this moment but I just felt that like when I get home it's time to do that again but yes let's pray for these people um Heavenly Father we thank you yes Lord for this this uh yeah put on our heart Lord for for the people so if you for your peace specifically the anabaptists that have not been reached by Brother Branham but are now being reached by Brother branham's Minister that you gave him Lord your ministry the Lord Jesus Christ being revealed in this day Lord oh yeah put the passion on our heart for them you have put the burden on us and Lord I just ask you that you just go out there and just bring fruits bring forth Jesus Lord that your Harvest would be and Lord continue to just show us the way show us where to put the books what to send to these people uh and and Lord I also ask that you bless the people from Lima there that have been contributing to this they've been contributing with tablets with books and Lord the word is just spreading And We Praise You Lord because you know where your sheep are and they are hearing your voice so I just praise you and just glorify your name just teach me to just be out of the way Lord and allow you to be glorified Lord for I ask these things in Jesus name amen Lord Jesus we've had a prophecy Lord a couple of years ago or so now it's time for the Amish to come I believe it oh Lord and Lord we don't want to see him just come out of the one system and go into another Lord sir or just lose all the good they had right right Lord we want to see him come into full truth and Lord we're praying crying out for more of that Lord yes Lord have your way work amongst them Lord let the convicting spirit of God move amongst them and draw their hearts and Lord if they do receive truth that they cannot that they don't just receive a small measure Lord but they can Plunge in all the way and walk in the righteousness and Holiness and the word that you are providing for them now and Lord we pray that this can spread throughout the nation in the name of Jesus many Souls can be brought into your kingdom in these last days in Jesus name let's praise the Lord together [Applause] Hallelujah

you God bless you God bless you Sister what about having your grandmother and your great-grandmother isn't that a blessing God bless you all thank you [Applause] brother Yoder you see there how how much uh advertising do you need to do what what kind of a cost you have no idea there's a lot of newspapers a lot of Amish papers huh do you think the uh do you think the church in Lima will keep providing the books because they have printed the books and they're probably getting them at a pretty good good cost much cheaper than we can buy them from them I would guess uh how many of you would like I mean three offerings in the service is against my religion but uh the the communion table is open here if you'd like to just come and put something there if you need to make out a check you can make it out New Hope Revival ministries and put Amish as a note uh and we will issue a check or you might make it out would would you take it directly if the check were made out to you Levi Yoder y-o-d-e-r if you don't want it to come through the church for any kind of record you can make it out and let's let's advertise let's do something more than pray let's put a little action now it's late and it's going to take thank you brother Robert for getting it started they were waiting on me to stop talking we don't want to hold you any longer I have no idea what that means when you point at your phone yes and in the notes you can Market Amish [Music] yes if you want to give online and Market Amish we will make sure they get every penny for advertising absolutely glory to God Glory yes brother let me see will you come in will you come and tell it can you tell the story this is what kept me up a little last night we were grinding meat um with the second time through hammered for a neighbor and usually I don't let the children help me with that except I I would like we have this grinder that has a six inch neck and anyway she helped me I I said all along one child to help me but just put it up here on the tree and uh anyway she ended up I I was turning to empty the bull and uh out of the corner of my eye I see her reach down into the hole and foreign ER I mean really I mean it isn't minor but it is I mean it's not a life but it's hard yes he's good he's good that song this morning exactly I mean I couldn't have said it better it's amazing it's harder now than it was to start with that doesn't really make sense but it was like God was there in every step of the way um I just grabbed the hand made so she couldn't see it and I told her I said um her brother screamed when he heard heard it or heard I I grabbed I lunged over and shut off the switch I mean it was just a second or two but um so thankfully I just grabbed the arm put my hand across the end of her hand so she couldn't see it because that was the first thought it was I don't want her to see it and I just grabbed her and I grabbed it hard enough I must have had a death grip on it it never bled and actually later that the doctor told me she said everything was so clean and so everything she said that just really helped to start with they said we're gonna have to do two surgeries and and do all so uh but anyway after we had the ambulance there and I was they life flighted her just they wouldn't have really had to but but uh they said they said it's not urgent since it's a clean cut off it's not like they're going to be able to put him back on so it's not like time is but they they ordered the Life Flight anyway but uh anyway so I'm going for the hospital and I'm I'm just being tempted to go back into my old rut of thinking of of just blaming myself and and just not getting over it then it was like God told me he said thank you Jesus he said it's you can stand in the way of oh yes yes it is all right he said you can stand in the way of my getting Glory or help me get the Gloria hear it and it was like all of a sudden that mind shift I mean that when God came it all of a sudden it turned around and it was like I was like she's going to get her fingers back not only am I going to do everything I can to make the devil pay he's gonna give back what he's stolen yes because that I I suddenly I realized Satan comes to kill steal and destroy and that was this was part of that process and that evening I texted Levi and I I text a different Brethren and said would you pray and uh it was funny because or God ordained there was three or four that sent texts back that said God can restore Limbs and and I and that was going through my mind before they texted me that and I said the devil's gonna pay and I'm going to I don't care if she doesn't get her fingers back on this side of Eternity I want her to get the fingers back and I'm I have faith in that I am trusting in that but if she doesn't I know she's going to have him on the other side yes but the other thing is God I mean it was just so plain like I have the choice to either stand in the way and block the glory of God that's it should get or or or or help and and anyway I just uh so I'm standing in faith that she will received her her limbs totally at um the hand is cut she's still got the little finger but it's cut like across here so so she doesn't have a thumb or the three longer fingers she's just got the pinky and but I I the thing that touched me later I mean it was like everything happened in the blink of the eye but she said am I going to die I said no I said Jesus can heal you and so she just [Laughter] cried out to God she said I need you now please heal me I need you now later when she had the cast she would say I think my fingers are starting to grow back listen listen um it's hard to so I didn't want to take that Faith away but I also wanted her to face reality but I was like I said you know you might not have those right away but I said I think you will have and I said you know God in other words I I don't remember all what I said but uh she's still she is still like we'll pray and we'll say you know God whenever you want to give her her fingers back and uh and she's she's still planning on that I believe it absolutely so isn't that wonderful anyway but I yeah I'd like to before you all go down listen at this I know you've already it's already been shared with you but maybe someone here would like to hear it in the message the fifth seal brother Branham said I believe I'm not going to speak in his name I'm going to speak in the revelation of my faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the other day I believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator I believe if he can make a squirrel appear here is a man or woman just got a part missing and that's complete in it in itself he is God I love him I believe that when sister Flo lost a little tip of her finger and I was torn to pieces and she was as calm as a cucumber she said pastor somebody had to be missing a limb before God could restore a limb so don't you worry about that let's agree did you want to say something else I just I just Revelation when I was driving for the hospital that if they're always really stuck oh if if God would have wanted her without those three fingers in the thumb he would have made her that yes that was the thing when I just all of a sudden realized whoa this this was yeah yeah yes yes that's the restoration part reach your hand toward Mom and Dad they have five children at home by the way reach your hand toward them and let's just believe for their faith to remain strong and let's begin to speak those fingers back father in the name of Jesus we stand in agreement with this beautiful family that your word is yea and amen the world might mock us and they might laugh at us and they might think that we've taken leave of our senses but here we are Lord standing on the promise of your word that you are a creator if you can create around me in a bush to type the coming Christ you are more than able if you can do it in the ocean every day of the year causing that starfish to grow back his arm or leg or whatever it's called surely Lord you know how and your power is more than able to restore fingers on little Mariah's hand may they have great grace to keep the faith strong may she not grow discouraged in waiting for that moment for that hour and even now we begin to speak it with the authority of Jesus Christ and we call those fingers in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we call for restoration of her fingers on her hand in the lovely name Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you brother God bless you thank you for sharing with the whole body amen my brother that I could receive that for advertising without saying oh all right do it thank you thank you everybody when we advertised we put them down at a price including shipping or if you do not have to funds ask for a free book most of them have been given out as free books so it's all right swear to church and Lima comes in they're giving them all for free they're buying them by the cases having them printed and buying them in and getting them out all right God bless you be seated a moment this is what you should know because they don't often tell this part of the story but God placed it on brother Perry Green's heart for the supernatural books to be printed he found out that brother Owen Jorgensen was working on the books brother Jorgensen was not a rider he had made a little written a little pamphlet one time in a little booklet one time but he was not a writer and he decided that God was leading him to write brother branham's life story in a way that it could be presented to the world not in a religious way but in a way that you could just read it and enjoy the story he actually saw it and believed that it would be on bookstore shelves and brother green went to Brother Jorgensen and asked him what his salary would be for a year and he paid him a salary to finish writing the supernatural books so had it not been for brother green and brother Jorgensen working together in the beginning we wouldn't have those books and then the Lima Church took the burden and they packaged him so much nicer as they begin to come out and I took those books all over the world to charismatics and Pentecostals when I was preaching in their conferences and I met a woman in Jerusalem Chad you might have been sitting at the table with me I think you were we were having dinner in the hotel in Jerusalem and a woman walks over and said I want to thank you for those Supernatural books I hated William Branham and I I mean I didn't hardly know what to say I couldn't imagine why she would hate him and she said I had some family that followed his ministry and they were constantly trying to put it down our throats and she said I built up a resentment and a hatred and she said but you made it possible for us to get these books and she said I just want you to know I love brother Branham big tears in
