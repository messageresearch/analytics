we can just get to you in faith we can roll it over off of our shoulders owned to you and you said you cared for us and you desired that we would cast it on you we acknowledge that we are weak at

when you look in the mirror look at yourself and say to yourself no matter how ugly you are how pretty you are how long your hair is how short it is or if people like the way you smell or not it don't matter tell yourself i am a masterpiece and then when you get through doing that be still and see what god will say to you i'm sorry but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for recovery so if it's a thousand hairs or two or yes right i told garbage junior i said if i get sick going to nursing home i don't care how ugly how bad how stinky i get don't cut my hair

that the longer i serve him the sweeter he grows this is current all right you may have your seats today we announced that we would receive a an offering on the principal to put on the principle of the mortgage of this property those of you that have not been here i cannot see all of the audience you that are here may god bless you all of you that are watching this service the lord bless you as well but we'll give a a quick uh summary of what we have been doing through the years the lord has made us promises that he would give abundance into this ministry to do the work of the lord that he would send wagon loads in abundance in the finance to be able to accomplish what the lord has called us to do prophetic words of of all sorts that the lord has promised to us and directed us and one day i was driving around the circle and complaining to the lord why lord where is it at i see these buildings they're just sitting idle it looks like they're in disrepair and needing work and there's no money to do it i felt like the lord spoke to me and said until a concentrated effort is made to get rid of the debt on this property you will not see the abundance or the wagon loads and so i came i gave that message and since then we have been uh taking a an offering on the first sunday of every month the lord has so blessed us thus far with one hundred and twenty seven thousand four hundred and twenty nine dollars and forty eight cents put directly on to the principle of this property well if you've already put that much on the principle how much do you owe well i can honestly tell you right at this moment i don't know but it's a lot it was a lot it still is a lot but i know the one who is jehovah jireh and he is able to provide every last penny of it last night as i was last night as i was uh working uh and and studying i was looking for something else and i happened to come to a website that uh had some of john wesley's messages uh his outlines on that website and the second message on that particular website was the title level was on money well this is good let me just take a quick glance at his outline so here is john wesley's sermon in three phrases gain all you can save all you can give all you can there's john wesley's message to you today so if you brought an offering today to give on the principle of this payment i know that there are some here you weren't aware of it that's okay god did not call you to pay his debts by going into debt don't want that we want to give according to what we have and so we're lifting our offering to the lord if you brought one with you i want you to hold it in your hand and i'm going to ask god's blessing over that offering and ask the lord to let abundance come back into your life father as we are here today and we hold our offering to you i believe that there are probably those that are on the other end of that camera who are also holding their offering in their hand so lord we corporately bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ and we want to thank you lord for a a marvelous offering to go against the principle of this property lord we want to thank you that you are doing the work this is not man's work this is your work and i want to say thank you lord for the blessing that you give to us that we can see this debt gone and we can move forward doing the work that you've called us to do now god made the people see the multiplication and the blessing come back into their home and we'll give you praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen david would you come and hold the offering bag i'm going to let the people come and give their offering today for the work of the lord for the extension of whatever he wants to do can i hear the key of f the battle's not mine said little david lord it's thine i'm in your favor i'm giving it all to you i don't know what to do i'm so glad you let me see you're really all that i need for the battle's not mine i give it to you lord

would you stand to your feet please turn with me if you will to genesis chapter 22. starting in verse one it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son that only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering laid it upon isaac his son took the knife in his hand or took the fire in his hand and a knife and they both went and they went both of them together pardon me verse 7 isaac spoke to abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god see and thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me abraham lifted up his eyes and looked behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and he said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates or the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba may we pray before you're seated our father we want to thank you that you still today are jehovah jireh and you are still proving yourself that you provide for every need that we have now lord we want to thank you for the grace and strength to be in your house today and we are now looking into your word and we want you to speak to us from your word god and that it would penetrate onto the inside and that it would become something lord that would give us grace and strength to to be able to secure the victory in our own lives lord you have already secured the victory for us but i thank you that we can secure the victory because we are in christ now lord let your plan unfold in this service we give you glory honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen lord bless you today you may have your seat verse 16 once again and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all of the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice for those that may not know i would like to in us to establish in galatians chapter 3 galatians chapter 3 verse 16. now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ verse 29 and if ye be christ's then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise all right so when god gave the promise to abraham it was a promise that was given to abraham for his natural seed but not to the natural seed exclusively but he was looking forward he was pointing forward to the seed of abraham which is christ our lord the one who would step out of eternity and would step into the realm of time and would stay he would he would uh come to this earth as as all other humans come in the womb of a woman but not through a sexual act god provided the egg and he provided the sperm seed it was nothing that man contributed to it except for god chose a woman to be uh as as brother branham called it the incubator the the warming of him the place where this child could grow but but we know through teaching from the word of god that this this baby had the blood of god it was not the blood of a man but it was the blood of god in this child and that when when god gave abraham the promise to the seed he was not talking about isaac he wasn't talking about jacob he was talking about the royal seed the royal seed of abraham starting out with jesus christ but we the body of jesus christ are a part of that royal seed that has been in the mind of god from before time ever to begin i'm a part of that royal seed i want you to see that you are a part of the royal seed and when god gave the promise to abraham it was not just to all of abraham's descendants in fact it was more to those that would come under the headship of the lord jesus christ and recognize that he was the lord of their lives and he was going to he desired to be the ruler and that royal seed will allow him to be the ruler now in the beginning before there was ever time the bible tells us that in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth when god created the heavens and the earth we see that the bible puts a period at the end of that sentence and then we don't know what happened in a span of time but as verse 2 goes on it says the earth was without form and it was void and god don't create that way god is meticulous so let's back up i'm going to say that before in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth because of the teaching that we have received before the heavens and the earth god sat alone with his thoughts and then as he sat with his thoughts he being god there was nothing or no one to worship him and so as these thoughts are going through his mind he begins to think i desire to be worshipped because he was god and so he began to create and and i don't know exactly the order of how things came but the bible as you read through the bible you know that he created an angelic host and in this angelic host there were mighty angels and there were cherubim and there were seraphim and all of these were created to worship the living god as i begin to think about these mighty angels the bible tells us about uh michael and tells us about gabriel these mighty warrior angels that were part of this heavenly host and as you read through the scripture i begin to think that lucifer must have been quite a mighty angel and the the scripture talks about how that is in his body were veals or sultry there was something about his body that that exuded perhaps music and then and he perhaps directed the music in in the heavenly realm but he was a mighty angel he had a lot of authority in that realm and if the word of god holds true the gifts and the callings of god are without repentance and so it once he was cast out of heaven and he took with him a third of those angels and drew them with him there is still gifts and callings in him that he is trying to usurp authority on anybody that he can usurp authority on and and then he has really pointed all of his weapons against the bride of jesus christ or the royal seed of abraham because he already knows that at this point in history he didn't get jesus and he knows that that jesus overcame death hell and the grave and so now he is pointing his guns at the royal seed you and me the bride of jesus christ and i want you to know today that he cannot take you out he can't take you out he might can bring some defeat he might bring some discouragement he might bring some down-heartedness in your life but he can't take you out so whenever you're discouraged you let him know you may buff in me but you can't take me out i am the royal seed of abraham so now in this heavenly realm god desiring to be worshipped and as the bible tells us in genesis chapter 3 that the cherubim these great warrior angels of some sort they're not little bad babies on clouds they're mighty warring angels and when the fall happened in the garden the bible tells us that these cherubim were placed at the gate to guard the way to the tree of life now when god placed let me not get ahead all right so then we also have seraphim and we we can read in isaiah how that the seraphim the they were six-wing creatures they were constantly crying holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy holy unto the lord and uh i don't know the sequence of when it might have happened but we can look in the book of revelation we can see that these 24 elders and they were there before the throne constantly crying unto the lord holy holy holy to the lord there's something that god desired he desired to be worshipped that god is bigger than a human being he is so much bigger than our little minds could ever comprehend but i'm so glad that on the on the other side in the ceaseless ages of eternity he's going to continue to reveal himself to us it does not yet appear what i shall be but i know when i see him i shall be like him for i shall see him as he is i expect that as i continue this journey i am looking more and more and more like my papa we see that there are people that are looking more and more and more like their mother every day these denominational systems they've gone off into balaam's error trying to build a kingdom for themselves but the bride of jesus christ wants to get right up under the right up under the arm of the living lord jesus because she knows that's where her strength comes from i don't have any strength of my own i just know my strength comes from him the joy of the lord is my strength so as all of this has taken place in the heavens and we see these angels and then the scripture tells us that the the earth was without form and void and we read in the fourth seal brother random said i don't know whether there was some kind of other civilization before this one but but said underneath of that water underneath of the waters there was seed that was already there and when god moved the waters and the light hit the seed the seed had to come and bloom forth as you listen to brother branham preaching about uh in the book of revelation and he talked about the symbols he said waters represents peoples and i began to think water was on top of the seed and many times we as human beings peoples [Music] peoples are hindering the light from getting to the seed that is inside of me and so i have to pull myself aside or the holy ghost has to quicken my heart to get out from under the waters get out from under the waters of the peoples that are hindering you they're stilting your growth you're stunting your growth and so you have to get out from under the waters but god he he moved the waters aside the seed was already there the light hit the seed and the seed began to bloom forth and as god is unfolding his creation the sun and the stars and the moon as the lesser light and then he creates the cattle and he creates the birds and the fish of the sea and he and he just unfolds all of this creation and then the bible says let us make man in our image what did we have the trinity having a round table discussion not at all not at all what we have is god with something still locked up inside of him that still had to be expressed and so the bible says that god created man in his own image in his image created he them now wait a minute how do you get them because as you look in the scripture there's only one and his name was adam but there was something locked up inside of adam that had to be taken out when adam was made he was made in the image of god the new testament tells us the image of god god is a spirit so when adam was created adam was created as god he was created in spirit form and he was also created with the masculine and the feminine inside of him then god saw that he wanted to he wanted to do something that was greater than letting adam be in spirit form because see all of the while this is about the royal seat of abraham see you go to the book of the revelation and you look into chapter five i believe and there was no one worthy to open the book and and they they cr john said i cried i wept because no one was worthy and and then we find that it's all of the sudden he says don't weave john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof then you read further over in the book of the revelation and you find out that that lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world and that lamb had a book the lamb's book of life and in that lamb's book of life i don't know about you but i found a revelation in the word of god there's something bubbling on the inside i have found my name in the lamb's book of life i have an assurance today that i can no more die than god can die because i'm of the royal seed of abraham and christ jesus lives inside of me let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought in not robbery to be equal with god oh preacher you're about to blaspheme oh no not at all i'm just telling you the word that i have found a place in jesus christ and he instructed me in his word that his mind could be in me his mind can be in you and then he goes on let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but he made himself a little lower than the angels we'll get there in a minute now as a adam in spirit form with masculine and feminine inside of him god is still working to bring his plan because he wants a people see the angels the angels that are in that heavenly realm they didn't tread now lucifer did he fell he he's already got a place prepared for him the bottomless pit that's taken care of but this these angels that are there in the heavenlies they'd never experienced humanity they've never come into this realm and god he he had something that he wanted to express and it was his desire even from before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain and the book was written and there was some names there mine included by god's grace yours as well but in those in that book the names see this is all a process of god he's bringing to pass his thoughts and his word and he's bringing it in now into the earth he had it he had it in his mind but he wanted to express it not just as a thought and and not just uh something that would roll around in his head or not just something that he wrote down on paper but there was a word that proceeded out of his mouth and said let there be and this man was created and in him the masculine and the feminine and it was still in a spirit form but that was not the end of god's plan god desired to to bring about a human race and so there came the time when god took some dust from the earth and he he created a human being and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life the very breath of god into his nostrils friend do you realize that that is the baptism of the holy ghost that is the very breath of god into your nostrils into your being into your inside the breath of god to bring about the purposes of god through your life in this end time and so god breathes the breath of life into this man now he is a human being he is he's able to walk and talk and hear and see and and in him still is the feminine part he is still masculine and feminine he would be the only one that i know of [Music] that might have an identity crisis because the masculine and feminine was in him but because he was so fresh from the fingertips of god he did not have an identity crisis but there came the time that god chose to put adam into a deep sleep and when he put him into a deep sleep he took something out of him the feminine part now we have two human beings they twain shall be one the bible says and as they are in the garden i'm i'm always fascinated by the fact that while the woman was still inside of adam god gave him instructions the instructions were not after she was formed from that rib the instructions were before but she got the instructions she knew them now i i preached this before i'll say it again remember at this point they're one name i believe it's chapter 5 of genesis says and their names were adam all right so we have these individuals they're put in the garden remember lucifer has already fallen he's taken a third of the angels with him and and and i as i began to ponder and think about what you know the bible does not go into great detail about what happened before in the beginning and about this angelic host and all of these things that go on that that went on in the heavenlies while god uh unfolded his plan and got to the part where the human beings were on the earth but there was something that happened in that heavenly realm that caused lucifer to the bible tells us isaiah 11 and he started talking about i will ascend i will do this and i will do that there was something that got into lucifer that caused him to want to be able to go up up up up in a power hungry desire to be the top one of all of creation he wanted to be the the very top the head he he had something in him did while lucifer was not rebelling these are just questions that started going through my mind did lucifer know about the lamb's book of life somehow i i think he probably did i i figured that he because of his rank there in the heavens he probably knew that that there was some discussion there was probably some things that maybe god talked about in the heavens i don't know but there was something in lucifer there was something about that old serpent the devil that wanted to ascend to a place where that he could have some kind of dominion over something he wanted a dominion and so he kept looking for an avenue he kept looking for a gate to be able to have access into something somebody's son i mean he already drug a third of the angels with him out of heaven uh his tail swept them out and so is he still he's still looking for something to possess so as these uh are in the garden the bible tells us that it was a tranquil place there was peace there and and god would come in the cool of the evening and he would talk to these these uh that he had made with his own hand and he would uh just have a lovely time of fellowship with them in the cool of the evening but all of the while satan is looking he's looking for an inroad he's looking for a way to get in the gate and he looks and he now sees that this individual this woman that has been taken out of the side of adam from that this man that has been made from the very fingertips of god he looks and he wonders to himself can i can i find access through her he knew he wasn't going to find access through adam i don't know how he knew that but he knew it and so he says can i find access to earth can i get access to this human race that i would be able to usurp some authority and so as as he's there he at this time the bible tells us that the serpent was an upright creature it was uh it was something that was very close to the human species and there we have indication in the scripture that that specie could talk with a voice remember the birds they don't talk the beasts the fish they don't talk they make some sounds and humans have learned some of their behaviors but they do not talk with a language like the human race but apparently the beast which was close to the human race yet without a soul the beast was able to communicate and somehow or another this this uh this that old devil pressed himself into this serpent and began to woo the woman his intention was to get to the seed and he was looking for an opening he was looking for a gate to be able to get the seed and so as he is uh talking to the woman he is seducing her he is wooing her and i don't know how long it took but somehow this serpent was able to make some uh some uh inroads into the mind of the woman that was the first gate he got through it was the gate he got through and we won't go through the rest of of all of this but we by revelation understand that he did not stop with the mind because he wanted to pollute the seed [Music] that was his desire from the start to pollute and stop the seed where he got this information i don't know but there was something about it that he wanted to stop the seed see the plan of redemption was already in god's mind it was already in god's mind and because god doesn't work in the realm of time hundred years thousand years four thousand years six thousand years what's 6 000 years in the realm of eternity it just doesn't matter to him the bible tells us in romans chapter 9 verse 22 what if god what if god let me get to it 9 22 what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afford prepared unto glory what if god willing to show his wrath see god is already he's infinite he doesn't operate in the realm of time it doesn't matter how much time it takes god had a plan that he was going to unfold in the earth as he's bringing uh the the all of the seed back to life out from under the waters and the the light of the sun hits that seed and it begins to come forth the seed already there but that old serpent the devil was looking for a way to possess the gate because at the gate there's a judicial system that goes on it's where people go in and out of and in and if you control the gate you're controlling the city you're controlling what's on the inside and the enemy knew that if he could possess the gate of the the reigns of the mind of the woman that he would have inroads into the city to be able to stop the seed but god adam already figured out god the one who created him knew this is going to be a vessel to destruction this is going to be a vessel he's already made his choice as to what he wants to be he's he's and i'm going to use him for my purposes and all of this purpose i'm going to unfold throughout the the the ages of span of time i'm going to unfold it and so god he allows all of this to happen and then as as satan finds his avenue into the mind of the woman and then it goes further than that because satan wanted to stop the seed he thought he could stop the seed but he'll never stop the seed and so god in his grace and in his love he put the he put the humans he put adam and the woman outside of the gate of the garden of eden the bible tells us that he positioned cherubim at the gate to protect the way to the tree of life to guard it lest they in their fallen condition would get to the tree of life and have to live in that miserable fallen state for all of eternity oh friends we think we've got it rough through 70 or 80 years of life in this fallen condition but can you just even begin to imagine having eternal miserable life horrible horrible and so god in his mercy put them outside of the garden of love of eden and he put their cherubim mighty angels and the flaming sword to guard the way to the tree of life so that they could not get access to that tree of life in their fallen condition because there had to be more that had to be carried out in order for the plan of redemption the royal seat of abraham to come into their position and so we go through the scripture and we get to this place where abraham uh formerly is named being abram he was called out of his land he had a wife sir eyes however you wish to pronounce her name before god changed her name and in the process of time she was one of she was the one that god chose to be with abraham she was a part of the predestinated plan of god that the seed would come through and and we read through the scripture that she was old and she knew that in her current condition she could not bear children and and god had already given this promise to abram and that he was going to have a son and after a while she came to him and she said now now abram i know that you've been holding on to this promise you've been holding on to this promise for a good many years now and and it just doesn't seem like i'm the one and so abram i'm offering to you hagar my maid let's see if god brings that son through her and so abraham heeds the voice of his wife and he goes to hagar and and and she conceives and brings forth the wild child ishmael and in ishmael he grows and then [Music] see friends watch the continuity of scripture you watch how god puts everything in in perfect order abram he was abram he went into the handmaid and he was uncircumcised when ishmael was born through the handmaid then god comes to abram and says abram i'm going to change your name i am going to breathe i'm coming to you as el shaddai i'm coming to you as the breasted one i'm coming to you as god who can do for you what you cannot do for yourself i am going to breathe into you the breath of life i'm going to breathe at home into you and if you look at the hebrew characters of the letter god did the same thing in abraham he did the same thing in sarah same exact character in the hebrew that god added to their name the breath the hay of god into their name and it didn't just do it into their name he did it into the very essence of who they were the being the physical body be and and abraham had to be circumcised in all of his house because god was putting in order everything to bring forth the promised son friends in order for us as the royal seed to bring forth the promised messiahs we have to be circumcised in the heart and the ears there has to be a circumcision in order to bring forth the fullness of god almighty into our lives so abram came abraham sarai became sarah god said i am going to visit you according to the time of life brought forth isaac when isaac was brought forth ishmael was still there but he was not the promised son and as we heard many years ago the mistake began to mock the miracle he began to mock isaac and sarah would have none of it she said abraham i am not going to put up with that you've got to get rid of him get him out of here i am not going to tolerate ishmael mocking our son and god told abraham put him out get him out see everything that is coming to your life there are things that are mocking your miracles they're hindering your walk with god they're hindering and satan is continually looking for access into your life he's wanting to possess the gate because he knows if he can possess the gate he can have authority in your life he can have some control over you he can manipulate you in certain ways and so friends the the scripture tells us that when abraham took isaac at the word of the lord to go to the mountain that i'm gonna show you of and offer your son your only son isaac now what kind of a wrestling match did abraham have with the lord over that i don't know i cannot even begin to imagine but somehow because as i look at this more and more and more i can see this i can see this foreshadowing calvary i can see this pointing toward calvary i can see as as as as isaac is carrying this load of wood on his shoulders this this as christ carried the cross i can see as as isaac now i don't know what age isaac was but if he was a teenager or up to maybe 38 40 years old i don't know exactly but this one thing i know that abraham was a hundred and something years old at this point however 100 plus however old isaac was and i figure that abram was probably losing some of his strength again i don't really know don't don't throw stones at me but somehow i think that isaac could have overpowered his father but as the lamb led to the slaughter as christ went to calvary he knew where he was going and he went willingly and i believe that this is the same kind of scenario here as isaac is carrying the wood on his shoulders and he's going toward this uh place that god had showed abraham of and they build the altar and isaac he just i see the altar and i got the wood where's the sacrifice and god comes back or abraham comes back he is jehovah jireh he is god that will provide for himself a lamb he's going to provide for himself a ram he is going to provide for him it's pointing forward and as he gets on that altar willingly i'm going to say willingly and abraham begins to prepare with this knife and he lifts his hand and the voice comes and said abraham i see that you are really you are really the one you you're you're after my heart and i recognize that you're willing to do this and and i'm going to i'm going to say he's free don't do any harm to him and abraham found this ram god had provided this ram in the thicket and then god says by myself i have sworn saith the lord because you have done this and you've not withheld your son your only son that in blessing i'll bless thee and in multiply and i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy [Music] now we already discussed the garden and now we see here that god has brought abraham to this point and given him a promise that this thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all of the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice now again this is not the natural seed this is christ the spiritual seed the seed of abraham this is the royal seed in thy seed shall all of the nations be blessed now again god does not operate solely in the realm of time and if he desired to take a long span of time he is carrying out the plan that was in his mind from before the foundation of the world now if in my 51 years i look at all of you and i try to intricately on paper put all of our lives together everything that you'll do everything that your neighbor will do everything that i'll do and try to mesh that all together and make it work i have trouble with just this one i can't do it but god saw down through the ages and he put everything in his divine order and it looks like that when god gave the promise to abraham it looks like that things would been settled just settled they were they were settled in the mind of god but there were some people that had to carry out their part hundreds of years of history of humanity having highs and having lows years of history of of of davids and solomons with all of their women and all of their good times and all of their mistakes hundreds of years of god dealing with the nation of israel and taking them into captivity and letting pharaoh beat on their heads for a while and all through that age all through those ages there was still that old serpent the devil who was looking to find a way to get control of the gate so he could get control of the seed because he was still trying to usurp his authority on humanity he has never quit trying to usurp his thoughts on humanity and he's still doing it today he's after you he's after me but i have the victory you have the victory here's the problem that we have we don't keep possession of the gate we've had seasons in our life where somebody would call come along and they'd preach about possessing the gate and we would get a hold of things and we would take possession of the gate again and then as time went along satan all the time looking for an inroad he's looking for a way to get control and so he keeps at you i i refer you again to the garden of eden the bible doesn't tell us how long that the that satan worked through that serpent to speak to eve to try to get control of her mind until that she doubted the word of god because when you are in the presence of the living god the more you stay in the presence of the living god the more you uh the more that you get absorbed in the scripture the more you get absorbed into the message of the hour the more that your mind is absorbed than that you are not giving attention to the devil like to tell you young people something and older people too get in those messages hear the voice that god gave in the end time to speak to the bride of jesus christ hear them they're accessible in many variety of ways they're available on our app they're available on the voice of god website they're available for you you don't have to have a big stack of tapes on the wall anymore it's easy to get access to it and i tell you there's something in that message of truth that you need to hear somewhere along the way the enemy gained access through a gate and deceived some of you young people and some of the older people too into thinking it was no longer necessary to listen to those messages but i'm coming to you today to tell you it is necessary for you to hear those messages to get a hold of what god is speaking to us in the end time because that message is more relevant in 2021 than it was when it was preached in the 50s and the 60s it is more relevant to the bride and as we keep the devil from gaining access into our minds the word will open up and become plainer and plainer and plainer to us hear them absorb them get in the scripture do as brother branham said to do and everything that he said lay it in the scripture i would advise you i would advise you as you're listening if you can't put it in the scripture don't throw it in the trash you lay it aside because i'm finding as i will go through this journey with the lord there are things that i would have said no way years ago but as god unfolds himself and you allow the holy spirit to have access and letting letting this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus i'm going to tell you can i 30 years ago if you would have tried to preach to me let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought and not robert to be equal with god if you to try to preach that to me and that that was going to be in the bride in the end time i'd have said you're way overboard but as god unfolds himself i realize that i've got i've got to become more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more like jesus christ in order for me to be raptured out of here i've got to have the mind of christ in order for me to have the resurrection power [Music] so true if jesus would have come to this earth and he'd had a mind like most of us have had and he'd have been put on the cross fighting all the way as he went struggling and saying god why are you doing this to me then all of a sudden he's dead and there's no resurrection power in him because he never stepped up to the place where that he who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god the resurrection life of jesus christ the resurrection power of the living god was in him so that when he was on the cross and i was on his mind and then he died and he was put in that tomb there was resurrection life there because he came into the fullness of everything that he was supposed to be and because that you and i are the royal seed of abraham we are the ones who are supposed to be coming into the full maturity of the believer yes sir friends all of that history that we can read in the scripture and see we can we can see the noah and all of the people that surrounded him there was rebellion of every sort and god said all right noah you go into the ark you you preach to him you've done what you're supposed to now go into that ark and i'm gonna save you and your house you're the ones that are in that ark i'm gonna save you and then they went above all of the destruction that was when they come out of the ark that wasn't the end of it satan was still there looking for a mind to inhabit then we had a tower of babel satan's still looking trying to find his power he's trying to gain access authority possess the gate of the minds of the people we go down through the ages and we see how that satan was still trying to get access into the minds of the people and we see through history there were people who overcame in the age that they were put because they kept access they kept the gate under security they kept satan from accessing their mind and they lived out their part of what they were supposed to live out there were others who they let satan have full access full authority we see where that they ended up they they ended up in destruction friends perhaps we don't preach on it a whole lot in right now i don't i don't know how god's seasons and timings work exactly and maybe we don't preach about hell a whole lot but i want you to know there is a hail and as i heard a preacher recently say hell was not created for human beings hell was created for the devil and his angels but there are human beings who have allowed satan to so grab a hold of their mind and so absorb them and their life that they're going there when god is finished with all of this time element and we go back into theophany bodies and into glorified bodies then satan will be loosed for a thousand years and then he is going to be cast into that bottomless pit and we're not going to have to deal with him anymore and there are people that are going to go there with him but it wasn't he god did not create you to go to hell god created you he wanted you to be the royal seed of abraham he wanted you to be in christ and he made a way for you to keep access to keep the way to possess the gate of your mind he made a way for you to possess the gate into your soul into your spirit he made a way for you to possess it how can i possess it most of you already know but i want to tell you the first thing that you've got to do is to repent the first step toward allowing the holy spirit to work in you is to repent to come see there's intellectual knowledge somebody may come to you and say you must be born again well what's that mean that means you've got to be born from above well what does that mean that means that you can no longer be yourself you can no longer operate uh with your own mind and your own thinking you have got to come under the headship the leadership of the lord jesus christ the one who died at calvary and shed his blood that i could have eternal life now all of the while that god is pricking your heart and saying to you you must be born again there's another spirit there that is trying to get access he's trying to get to the gate and he's trying to usurp the gate because he doesn't want you to understand about being born again and he doesn't want you to say those words to the lord i surrender he doesn't want that satan wants to control the gate but the royal seed will possess the gate of his enemy how can i possess the gate of my enemy it's easy christ already did it see how simple that was christ already did it jesus christ the royal seed he already possessed the gate of his enemies every one of them there is not one gate of the enemy or enemies however you wish to say it however many demon spirits there are there is not one of them today that has not been conquered by the lord jesus christ when he was on calvary and he had me on his mind he had me inside of him and i was released from his side so that the bride could come to into her position and then he descended into the lower parts of the earth the bible said that he ascended but before he ascended he descended into the lower parts of the earth he led captivity captive gave gifts unto men there was something that happened down there he took the keys of death hell and the grave he possessed the gate of his enemy death hell the grave because jesus christ the royal seed has already possessed hell got the key got the key i got the key to the gate of hell so now i have paid the price i shed my blood i have the key to that gate you don't have to go to hell the grave i got the key to the grave the grave is scary come down to the end of your life if you should go by the way of the grave that the grave may be scary it may because of the unknown the the thought about crossing chili jordan and not knowing what you're going to encounter and maybe scary i got the key i got the key to the grave you don't have to be scared about it i got the key to that gate too and and death hell and the grave death you don't have to be concerned about it you don't have to be concerned about death i got the key to it too uh see satan came the thief comes to kill steal and destroy that's his goal death hell in the grave that's his goal is to put you in a grave make you think you're going to hell that there's no hope for you and that the grave and death is the end of it you're finished but jesus comes along and says i got the key to the gate it's in my hand and i i i've got this key and somewhere along the way peter got a revelation and he's they they begin to he begins to ask them who demands say that i the son of man am some say elijah some say you're one of the prophets jesus says but who do you say that i am and peter says thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus says upon this rock i'm gonna build my church not peter not a church but upon a revelation and upon this revelation the gates of hell can never prevail against that revelation so you as the bride of jesus christ and as the royal seed if you can ever get that revelation thou art the christ but the revelation doesn't stop there let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought and not robbery to be equal with god now wait just a minute preacher you're going a little bit far now hold on here just a minute because when peter got that revelation and jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it do you know what jesus said to them don't tell anybody about this revelation don't tell anybody what i've just told you now why would he say that it wasn't necessary because it was going to unfold it was going to become very evident as jesus continued his journey to the cross and into the grave into that into that stone grave and he come up out of that grave and then he poured the holy spirit on the believers in the upper room it became very evident who he was it did not have to be written down on paper it did not have to be broadcast by human voices it became very evident who he was and friends as you the royal seat of abraham you take full possession of the gates death hell and the grave the keys of the kingdom as you take full possession of the gates of your mind you are not going to have to tell anybody i don't have to broadcast that i have the mind of christ i don't have to get on a radio or a tv station and say friends the bible tells me that i can have the mind of christ i don't have to broadcast that all i have to do is be letting his mind be in me and unfold what he wants to unfold through me through you keeping control of the gate thy seed as the musicians come thy seed shall possess the gate of her enemy of his enemies that includes you the royal seed you don't have to back down to the devil and cower to him and tell you you know you don't you don't have to you don't have to allow the enemy to put the wrong seat in you he's after that he's desiring to do that but friends the victory has already been accomplished for us it is already been accomplished for us i would like to read this since sister flo stood right here and she said i'm a masterpiece ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 you at the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus remembering tuesday night when brother shelley preached to us about our address that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast was this your verse sister flo for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that you being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances to for to make him himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity remember god told the serpent i'm gonna put enmity between your seed and her seed hostility hatred i'm gonna put enmity but god slayed the enmity thereby through the cross came and preached peace to you which were afar off unto them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father oh hallelujah preacher you've talked to us about a gate and i just really not grasping what you're trying to say well friends god gave you a mind as a human being he gave you an eye gate he gave you an ear gate he gave the gateway of the mind and the enemy is looking for any access whether it be through a worldly song whether it be through some kind of filth that you would view with your eyes whether it would be something that somebody said and you roll it around in your mind and you roll it around in your mind and it becomes out of hand and and you just continue to let it go on but i'm telling you as a part of the royal seed of abraham you are able to have access to the gates of your own mind god has given you of the authority over your own being to get to take the access to possess the gate as i was starting to say a while ago repentance is such a key in in that even after being born again a believer still comes back to the lord and and repents because we're still working through this process to let the mind that was in christ jesus be fully in us you see i have the mind of christ but there are days where i am still uh i get distracted or whatever happens and the enemy gains some kind of access into my mind and i entertain him a while and so i have to go back to papa and say lord i i'm sorry i'm sorry that i allowed that to happen and i am okay i'm taking access once again to my gates they belong to me you gave me authority over them we were also instructed that we should be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well what about matthew 28 19 to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost his name is lord jesus christ that's who he is that's no problem be filled with the holy ghost this promises to you and to your children and to them that are afar off moms and dads aunts uncles cousins brothers sisters if you've got some that are out of the ark of safety you just remind the lord have his word to him that is afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call i don't know who god is calling but i heard a prophet one time say that you had enough faith to call on god for yourself and because of that faith that you had to call on the lord for yourself and you walked as the royal seed of abraham and you were walking in in truth and in the word of god that there was something that could quicken on the inside of you that you could start calling in your loved ones holding the token the blood over them say their mind they belong to the lord they don't belong to the devil god did not god did not give me seed to belong to the devil he did not give me children and grandchildren to belong to the devil i have had faith to call on the lord for myself i'm going to call on the lord for them until they recognize [Applause] you can't repent for them they've got to do it for themselves but friends there's power in the word of god there's power in your voice decreeing over them i i didn't birth any serpent seed i didn't birth any seed of hell i birthed children of the living god and they may be wayward right now they may be away from god they may look like they're headed straight for hell but i'm a child of god and i'm holding the token over them in the name of jesus christ and they've got to come [Applause] they may not come the same way you did they may not live the same victorious life that god by his grace has given to you but they don't have to go to hell friends you they you you don't have to just uh blatantly watch your children go off into a devil's hell just take the word of the lord and hold it over them god you're a saving god and you already know the names that are in that book and i'm holding my children my grandchildren my nieces my nephews they're they're fighting one another they're battling one another but god i know that there's something somehow you can get a hold of them by your grace and after you're filled with the holy ghost and refilled with the holy ghost and refilled with the holy ghost and refilled with the holy ghost and refilled with the holy ghost okay broken record preacher what are you trying to say i'm telling you that some of it seeps out god gave it to me to give out to others god gave it to me to be like peter to walk down the street where my shadow would touch somebody and they would rise up and be healed but i've got to go back to the fountain of living water and be refilled with the holy ghost then because of the goodness of god [Music] because of his grace he lets me see some things in my life that at one time he could not uncover because he knew that i could not handle it and when he uncovers it and i repent of it i have to say lord come fill that void place because i sure don't want any demon spirits i don't want them to have any access possess the gate friends possess the gate you shall possess the gate of your enemies i'm telling you the enemy wants access to you he wants access to you but we have already access over death hell and the grave we have those keys through the lord jesus christ and we have the keys through the word of god to maintain control of this house that god gave to us you're the temple of the living god [Music] and he only wants to have access into your life we could all give horror stories of how we have allowed the enemy into our life and given him access but forgetting those things which are behind me i press toward the prize of the high calling in christ jesus what is that prize it is the gift that has been given to the royal seat of abraham that she possess every gate she possess every part of her being and she becomes so filled with resurrection life until she takes her flight out of here let's stand together today do you remember that course no ye not no ye not you are the temple

you be willing to bow your heads hallelujah jesus christ you bow your head and you would just ponder your life perhaps you would say brother i realize that i've called on the name of the lord i've even received the holy ghost and been baptized in his name but i've been having a real struggle keeping control of the gate and i would just lift my hand and say pray for me brother i ask you to pray for me that i'll get control would there be more hands i see hands all over this building you'd say i just want the i want the grace to be able to to keep control of the gate of my mind my heart my being until that the enemy cannot run me around in circles and caused me to go in ways and and open a gate in the eyes and in the ears and even with my voice that those gates would be open preacher would you pray for me perhaps you on the streaming whatever avenue you're watching this on you would say brother remember me i would like to have i would like to have the ability to keep access at the gate i know somehow in my heart i'm a part of the royal seed but i've not been possessing the gate as he said i would may god bless you those on the streaming now father you see all of these hands in this building and those that may have raised their hand across this streaming device whatever way it goes into their home whatever way they watch this service lord i pray [Music] in the name of jesus christ that you would give them the grace this day this day and in this hour to gain access once again lord we could all talk about the times that we [Music] forfeited and we lost at the access seemingly but god we again are forgetting those things that are behind us and we're reaching anew today to the finished work of calvary and once again letting this mind be in us which was also in christ jesus and we are taking possession of the gate the authority at the gate the authority over our being our temple i pray this grace in the name of the lord jesus christ for the glory of the lord
