TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and I want to welcome you to the Eagles cry I am sitting right now in Smith Station Alabama in the sanctuary of the New Hope Revival ministries and it is a real joy to be coming to you wherever you are in the world I know that this program is going across the Nations and that is possible because of the dedicated men and women who serve the Christian Network where you're watching this program let's remember to pray for these networks that God will sustain them and that he will continue to expand them and multiply them so that they can accomplish the vision that the Lord has placed upon their life if you've never taken the opportunity to write us at New Hope Revival ministries the information will be given to you on your screen and we would love to hear where you're watching from and if you have a prayer request it's something that uh I look at Daily I check the prayer request every day and when I go to prayer I take those prayer requests with me and often times we share them with the prayer warriors and the intercessors in our ministry and I can assure you that if you send in a prayer request there's somebody here that's going to lift it up to God now I believe there's power in your prayers but I think that it's a wonderful thing when we can bind together when we can join our faith together and believe God we need to have unshakable faith in this hour what that means is even when we don't see the immediate result of what we've been asking God for of course we're supposed to be praying according to his will and not our own whim or our own desire but we're trying to discover the will of God and the desire of God and pray for that but uh when we don't see the results as fast as we would like to we have to remember that God is Sovereign and he is faithful he knows how to do his business doesn't he uh and if we'll just wait and be patient and uh put our foot on the solid rock and not be shaken and moved by what we see or hear I know the answer will come just hold on uh I I like to to think about the the old song that says joy comes in the morning the darkest hour is just before the dawn and so it may look mighty dark right now in your life and you may wonder how your circumstances could ever be turned around and then Here Comes King Jesus walking on the water and he can change everything he certainly can he is the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not his word is yay and amen he is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should have need to repent if God said it that settles it so you let your faith be settled you let the issue be settled in your life to today and uh we're going to help you pray if you'll send in your prayer request we will and don't forget to give God praise he is worthy to be praised and uh you know we read in the New Testament about the 10 lepers that Jesus cleansed they all were healed they all were set free but only one came back to thank him don't you be like those nine lepers that that got healed but got so excited they ran away and never took the time to be thankful you be like the one leper who came back and bowed before the Lord and thanked him took time to show him his appreciation I believe there's power in prayer and I believe that there's power in Praise I believe that the Bible tells us in everything to give thanks I believe when the Praises go up the blessings of God come down so you be faithful to give God thanks just lift up your hands before him every opportunity that you you have and just give him praise he's worthy he's certainly worthy let's get back to our study for this week but I get excited when I talk about what prayer can do and I get excited when I talk about what praise can do but let's get to our subject for today all right we're talking about uh drawing closer to the Lord we're talking about the veil of Flesh being removed the last time we were together we talked about the fact that just before the children of Israel were crossing the Jordan into the promise that God had prepared for them it was at Harvest Time and the banks of the Jordan had overflowed and we talked about the fact that Jordan River represents flesh and death and that just before you and I begin to cross into to what God has called us to the the the fullness of our destiny in him being fulfilled uh the enemy gets in stirs up the Flesh and we ought to just take take advantage of that instead of letting it overwhelm us and overcome us we ought to just take advantage of that and let God dig in let God cut us free and set us free from some of those things that the enemy is trying to use listen God doesn't want you bound up he wants you to have freedom in him he whom the sun sets free it's not just free but free indeed God wants you to have real freedom to serve him the way your heart desires to serve him the flesh will oppose the flesh will rise up but thanks be to God there's victory in the spirit Romans 8:3 for what the law could not do what the instruction could not do in that it was weak through the flesh anytime man is involved in something it's there's going to be a weakness there when man touches something when man gets involved in something uh it it it weakens whatever that something is and so what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his only son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh we talked about uh the Flesh and how it's represented by a veil we talked about the veil of the temple being rent in two and uh I wonder sometime when we look at that when that veil was was ripped in two does anybody remember what was embroidered on the veil the Bible tells us that on the veil that protected or that covered the holy of holies there were cherubims that were embroidered on that Veil now where do we where do we see cherubims in the Bible Well we find out that in the the Book of Genesis when Adam and Eve were were driven out when they they were told they had to leave the Garden of Eden the way to the tree of life was guarded by Cherry beams and flaming swords and I find it very very interesting we see these cherubims there guarding the way keeping man from having uh total open access to the Tree of Life because there was something now that had to be protected because a way was going to be provided for man to be able to have access to eternal life or or the tree of life which is the Lord Jesus Christ so I find it very very interesting that when the veil was ripped and the way was opened up to the holy of holies that cherry beams were the very image or the very symbol that were embroidered on the Veil when it was ripped what do you think God was saying I think God was saying what I have guarded and protected and kept man from having open access to uh I have come uh he came God sending his only son in the likeness of sinful flesh to rip the veil to to uh tear aside or to tear away the very thing that God had placed there to keep man out and now the way is made and no Chariot beam and no flaming sword is going to keep you from having access because our great high priest the Lord Jesus Christ has entered within the veil Hebrews 10 tells us and sprinkled his blood there oh Hallelujah and made a way for us to go in unhindered unashamed not in our righteousness don't you misunderstand not because because we're good not because we're holy in ourselves the Bible tells us that all of our righteousness when compared to the righteousness of God is but filthy rags and tables filled with vomit so there that that lets me know right there there's no comparison with my righteousness and God's righteousness but he has imparted he has released his righteousness To Us by the word work that he accomplished on the cross my my my what a work has been accomplished what a way has been made for you and I to enter into the holy of holies now what does that represent it represents full access to God and to the things of God and to the spirit of God so that we can go in and receive Revelation uh impartation what we we need instruction whatever it is that we need to come out you can't live your whole life you can't live always on a mountain you can't always live in by the ark you've got to come out after you've received your impartation and you've got to go do the work that God has called you to do and when you need more when you need another another release Another Touch another taste you go right back in how why how is that possible because the veil is gone because the way has been made because the blood has already been sprinkled on The Mercy Seat the blood of a goat or a lamb or a dove is no longer required in this hour for the purpose of redemption Redemption has been paid for by the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ now if God is made a way for you you must be careful that you don't let the flesh rise up and cause you to be afraid to go in to the things that God has opened up for you you see if you allow fear fear will keep you captive now I believe in Godly reverence and I believe in reverential fear we walk softly before the Living God but that's not the kind of fear I'm talking about I'm talking about how the enemy will raise up fear in our flesh he'll cause us to be afraid to be obedient to what God tells us to do let me tell you something if God leads you to it he's going to bring you through it if God brings you into a situation in your life the grace is already available the grace package has already been made available and released to you to get you through that place regardless of what the opposition is I often tell my church here in Alabama if you think the devil is going to uh roll over and play dead like a dog somewhere while you begin to raise up and move into the stature of a perfect man as an adopted son of God and start calling those things that are not as though they were and speaking with the creative spoken word of God if you think the devil's going to lay over there in the corner and pretend to be dead while you do all that you're wrong he's going to howl he's going to huff and puff he's going to lie he's going to try to accuse you and condemn you and keep you out of what God has for you that dirty dirty devil but he will only be successful in the in the extent or to the extent that you allow him to be and I'm not going to allow the enemy to lie and keep me out uh of what God has called me to do and sometimes that comes in a direct lie and sometimes it comes with a just just a sense of unworthiness that paralyzes you let me tell you let's settle it let's settle this today we're unworthy there's no doubt about it we're unworthy in ourselves we are not worthy but God called us if you feel the spirit of the Lord pulling to you God is calling you and if God is calling you he knows who you are he knows how unworthy you are in your flesh but if God loves you enough to call you you ought to love him enough to surrender to that call step out of that place of of being being paralyzed by your own fear and by your own uh lack of selfworth and I'll just be honest with you in myself I am not worth very much at all but with the help of the Lord I can be more than a conqueror if I yield to the word of God he will take care of it won't he Romans chapter 88:9 but ye are not of the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell well in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his if you're born again of the spirit of God then the spirit of Jesus Christ lives inside of you and you are not after the flesh you are not motivated by the things of the flesh but by the things of the spirit now does that make it automatic and the flesh just lays down no the flesh is going to rise up but what we must remember is this is not a battle of Flesh and Blood this is a battle of principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places so what do we do when we know that we're facing something on that level of evil we run to the Lord because he said I have given you power over all the powers of the enemy now we don't take that casually we don't take that lightly we want to stay plugged into to Jesus he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you this is about Abid hiding this is about resting in the secret place and the secret place is not a geographical location it's not your closet somewhere the secret place is a revelation I'm telling you if you're hiding in a secret place with God you're hiding in a revelation something that God has made real to you that the devil can't steal and you don't just receive Revelation from your pastor of of course we do but God wants to make himself known to you as an individual he wants to reveal truth to you if you have a Hungry Heart before God tell him say Lord I'll be quiet sometime I will I will be still I will wait on you and I will position myself to receive Revelation it's a wonderful gift from God look at Galatians chapter 3 I don't have it here so I'll look it up real quick quick but let's let's look at Galatians chapter 3 because it talks about uh uh striving and and I don't I don't believe that it's the will of God for us to have to strive to receive what he has already made available to us as a free gift so let's look at what Galatians chapter 3 says oh foolish Galatians now don't think because that says foolish Galatians that it's nothing to us I think we can find ourselves in these verses who hath Bewitched you or seduced you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh you know what what this is saying to us quit striving In the Flesh to accomplish what can only be achieved by the spirit of God in other words we sometimes strive to become more lovable or more acceptable to God and listen he didn't accept you uh because you're good-look anyway or because you're smart or because you own a a a business or or because of what cast you're in let me tell you something that's not why God accepted you he accepted you because of the blood of Jesus that's what makes you acceptable in his sight and and sometimes when we get in this rat race of trying to fix ourselves and repair our damage selves it becomes striving it becomes fleshly it becomes our own uh uh motivation instead of letting God do it and God is saying to us through the words of the Apostle Paul if you start in the spirit how did you start out with the Lord you didn't know very much you you were just like a little spiritual baby weren't you but you knew enough to call on Jesus you heard the truth and you knew enough to call on him and he came in and washed you with his blood and he is still in the process to this day I've been a born again believer a long time 38 years or so and uh filled with the Holy Ghost that long and yet I am still being Washed by the Water of the word I am still being tweaked and adjusted or if you want to use the analogy of a musical instrument I'm still being tuned because I can get out of tune you take that guitar over there and you put it out in the element or you let it get too cold or too hot and that those strings will stretch or or contract and uh it will change the tune it'll take that guitar R Out Of Tune and you have to get it out and find the perfect pitch and adjust it and God is still adjusting me to this very day almost 40 Years Later by his word and you know what that's good news well don't you feel ashamed that you hadn't got it right yet I may never get it right in my flesh but I have somebody with me who loves me so much that he corrects me from his word he washes Me by his word he directs Me by his word he feeds me by his word he he strengthens me he balances Me by his word sometimes I could get in a big old m mess if it wasn't for the word of God directing me and leading me that's the goodness of God so quit striving In the Flesh to accomplish what can only be achieved in the spirit now I can speak to ministers also and I can tell you that if God gave you a vision for Ministry if God showed you something that you were supposed to do and you started out doing it by being led by the spirit what makes you think that you're going to be able to finish that VIs Vision or to complete that task by striving or by working with your hands or by doing it in your own ability or your own strength it will never happen that way if something starts out in the spirit it's going to be finished in the spirit I can say about the Church of America that it was by the spirit that God used to draw people to the house of God we didn't have any gimmicks we didn't have any contests we we didn't have a coffee shop we didn't have uh Seeker sensitive uh uh thoughts and programs and and a program for this and a pro we didn't have all of that in the day old days uh when I was just a boy in Pentecost we just had the spirit of the Lord and we depended on God now we invited people to church and they wanted to come because they saw a difference in our lives they saw what what God was doing among the people in the church and when they I I mean drug addicts delivered and alcoholics delivered and and and and and when they saw what God was doing in their life they wanted to come and see what it was all about today the church has began to think that we can do it in our own intelligence that we can set up some programs or make everybody comfortable or tell people you can come in your in your pajamas or however you know you don't have to dress up just just come like you are we we we've thought of all kinds of things that we could say to make people want to come something is wrong we're behaving like the foolish Galatians we're trying to finish something in the flesh that was started in the spirit it works on the corporate level and it works on the individual level I just feel like I'm speaking to somebody right now I mean I'm speaking to somebody specific right now and God wants to call you back to your roots and God wants to say to you you will never ever accomplish in the flesh what the what the will of the spirit is calling for you'll never please the spirit of God or please God by The Works of your hands now that doesn't mean that we don't have to labor we labor but we labor knowing that it is not up to what we do that the Harvest is going to be brought in the Harvest is a supernatural Harvest we make ourselves available we're willing to do whatever God tells us to do that's still Spirit work if God tells you to go to the farthest reaches of a n that's still the spirit work you have to work hard at doing it I'm not saying that there's not physical difficulty and sacrifice that we make and that we don't work at all with our hands of course we do but it's it's by obeying what the spirit calls us to do not by sitting around trying to think of good ideas if we sit around and try to come up with a good idea uh to serve the Lord and to work for God what's that going to be it's going to be a a product of our mind uh not of the spirit this is what happened to Abraham God said I'm going to give you a son by Sarah what did Abraham say I'm going to help you out a little bit Lord doesn't look like Sarah's ever going to give me a child I'll just take Hagar and and I'll get a child that way and so it was what was Ishmael then Ishmael was a product of Abraham's thoughts his mind his ideas not necessarily a product of the perfect and divine will of God now did God make a plan for Ishmael yes did God know what was going to happen in his sovereignty yes but it doesn't change the fact that this whole uh idea was something that Abraham thought not necessar something that God inspired now we want to be careful that when we start out to do something for the Lord that we're moving in the spirit I feel something on this today I know this is not a message for every person perhaps watching this program but I'm happy if God wants to use this little section to speak to one person I'm happy I'm happy about that let's pray father you see Lord whoever is watching this program that needs this this word today give them strength to lay still and let the spirit of God be renewed in them so that they can move forward in the spirit not trying to accomplish and finish things in the flesh that were started in the spirit if it's started by the Holy Ghost and Lord I'm counting on you to help us finish it by the Holy Ghost break whatever it is that the enemy is using using against the Servants of the Lord to get them caught up in that in that cycle of trying to do it in their own strength the joy of the Lord is our strength father fill the believer with Supernatural joy in this hour I pray in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah thank you for watching the Eagle's cry I'm just letting God speak I I'm just letting him lead and direct and I'll do my best to let him do that the next time we meet together right here on the eagle cry God bless you today byebye for [Music] now
