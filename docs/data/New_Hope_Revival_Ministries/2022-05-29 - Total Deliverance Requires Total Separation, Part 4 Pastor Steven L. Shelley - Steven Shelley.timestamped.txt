[45:44] return void but it accomplishes
[45:47] whereto it is sent and so lord as we
[45:50] come presenting ourselves sitting under
[45:54] the sound of the word today
[45:56] we're asking lord as our pastor comes
[45:59] and he takes the microphone and begins
[46:01] to speak of the word of god lord that
[46:04] there would be the pull and the draw the
[46:06] pull and the draw god i'm asking that
[46:09] the questions that we have could be
[46:12] settled the answers right on target lord
[46:15] i thank you that's who you are you god
[46:18] never miss the mark
[46:20] never you miss the mark

[46:42] coming with a high spirit but we're
[46:43] coming lord yielded to the purposes of
[46:46] god
[46:47] now get honor and glory out of the rest
[46:49] of this service lord you do what you
[46:52] want to do and you do it how you want to
[46:55] do it
[46:56] we'll give you glory honor and praise
[46:59] for it is in the name of the lord jesus
[47:02] christ that we pray
[47:03] amen amen amen
[47:06] can you give the lord a shout of praise
[47:08] today
[47:10] oh
[47:11] i praise you lord
[47:14] [Music]
[47:17] hallelujah
[47:20] you may have your seats today
[47:24] we're so glad to see you in the house of
[47:26] the lord
[47:26] [Music]
[47:28] it is such a blessing to
[47:31] be able to come and sit in the house of
[47:33] the lord to stand to worship in the
[47:36] house of the lord with fellow believers
[47:39] and we have some of our congregation
[47:41] with us today that we don't get to see
[47:44] every week but we're so glad to have
[47:46] sister terry lawler with her mother's
[47:48] sister sister gert hammond
[47:50] sister terry's daughter rebecca with her
[47:53] daughter maya
[47:54] sister terry's daughter hannah with her
[47:56] daughter natalie we're so glad that
[47:59] they're here with us today
[48:07] now if you forgot their names that i
[48:09] just spoke i want you to learn them
[48:12] because they are a part of this
[48:14] congregation though we may not see them
[48:17] every service they have driven 12 hours
[48:21] 10 hours eight hours eight hours to get
[48:24] here
[48:25] to be in one service to be in fellowship
[48:27] with us
[48:28] because behind that camera is not the
[48:31] same as being in fellowship with god's
[48:33] people and so i honor them today and i
[48:36] want you to fellowship with them we want
[48:38] to give them all the fellowship that we
[48:40] can while they're here want the spirit
[48:42] of the lord to just come down in this
[48:45] service heavier and heavier and heavier
[48:47] as this service progresses today until
[48:50] that every need that we have it can be
[48:52] met
[48:53] you know i was thinking as we were
[48:56] singing about
[48:57] being free in the spirit and and and the
[49:00] chains breaking off of us
[49:03] i was thinking i'm sorry but my mind
[49:06] went first to something very carnal
[49:10] i never had a television growing up but
[49:12] i had plenty of heathen friends
[49:15] and i remember
[49:18] the incredible hawk
[49:21] remember how he turned green and he got
[49:22] bigger and bigger and he stretched out
[49:24] of his clothes
[49:26] well then i got a little more spiritual
[49:28] and i began to think about samson
[49:32] when samson
[49:34] was laying in the lap of delilah and
[49:37] she
[49:39] listened to his voice and he talked
[49:41] about being wrapped up with a certain
[49:43] cord
[49:44] but as long as he did not reveal the
[49:47] secret of the lord
[49:49] when the spirit came upon him he was
[49:52] able to break out of those cords
[49:58] but when he finally revealed the true
[50:01] secret of where his strength came from
[50:05] he arose and he said out of his own
[50:08] mouth i will go out and be as i was at
[50:12] other times
[50:14] but because that he had yielded the
[50:17] secret
[50:18] to a heathen to an unbeliever he had
[50:20] yielded that secret
[50:23] then he could not break free
[50:26] of that thing
[50:28] that came upon him
[50:31] and he was
[50:32] then
[50:33] put as a workhorse
[50:36] to grind
[50:38] and be sport for the philistines
[50:42] then my mind went to the scripture in
[50:44] romans to whom we yield our members
[50:50] to whom wield friends we've got to be
[50:53] fully yielded every part of a spirit
[50:56] soul and body we've got to be yielded to
[50:59] the holy ghost and if we will yield our
[51:01] members to the holy ghost and not to
[51:04] this world
[51:06] when the enemy comes to try to put a
[51:08] chain or a confine of some sort on us
[51:12] the spirit of the lord if we'll yield to
[51:14] the spirit
[51:17] too many times we have allowed the enemy
[51:20] to keep us bound under that thing
[51:24] and when the spirit of god began to move
[51:27] we were willing to remain under the
[51:30] guilt to shame the condemnation of what
[51:33] had happened behind us
[51:35] rather than to come under the yielding
[51:38] of the holy ghost to let that chain fall
[51:41] i'm convinced that there are many times
[51:44] in life we have worn chains much longer
[51:47] than we needed to
[51:49] because we did not yield to the holy
[51:51] spirit
[51:52] but he's here today
[51:54] and he's calling us to yield to him
[51:58] and i want to yield everything that i am
[52:01] all that i am all that i could ever be i
[52:04] want to yield to the holy spirit so that
[52:06] no chain has the opportunity to stay on
[52:09] my life
[52:11] he's here
[52:13] he is here the holy spirit is here to
[52:15] move in our lives he's already moved
[52:19] among us
[52:20] and he's going to continue to move in
[52:22] this service we're just yielding to him
[52:25] saying lord
[52:26] you do
[52:27] in me what you want to do
[52:30] not every service is the same
[52:32] and if we tried to manufacture to make
[52:35] it the same then it would become common
[52:38] and we would lose what god wants to do
[52:41] but if we'll just say lord you do it how
[52:43] you want to do it i'm just yielding to
[52:46] you
[52:48] sometimes hallelujah
[52:52] sometimes praise the lord
[52:55] sometimes gently singing
[52:58] our hearts in one accord
[53:00] that's what he wants he wants us to be
[53:02] in one accord under the spirit of god
[53:05] so that he can do what he wants to do
[53:08] if you've come today with your tithe and
[53:10] your offering we want to give as giving
[53:12] unto the lord
[53:14] david will you come michael christian

[55:01] accord sing against

[57:28] you say amen are you with me this
[57:30] morning
[57:33] today is
[57:34] the 55th
[57:36] anniversary on the jewish calendar of
[57:38] the reunification of the city of
[57:40] jerusalem
[57:42] and i've had the blessing to be in
[57:44] israel on jerusalem day
[57:46] and it's one of the most exciting days
[57:48] of the year there are a lot of
[57:51] celebrations
[57:52] taking place in the city
[57:54] and there were many miracles that took
[57:56] place during that six-day war
[57:59] to place jerusalem back in the hands of
[58:01] the jewish people and so because
[58:04] tomorrow is memorial day i see people
[58:07] posting all the time about veterans day
[58:09] tomorrow but it's not veterans day
[58:11] tomorrow's memorial day and uh we are
[58:14] remembering those who gave their lives
[58:17] for our freedom
[58:19] and there were many men our apartment in
[58:21] jerusalem the church maintains apartment
[58:24] in french hill and french hill is just
[58:28] up the hill from ammunition hill
[58:32] and ammunition hill was one of the most
[58:34] important battles in that war
[58:38] to place jerusalem back in the hands of
[58:40] the jewish people so
[58:42] during this time of remembering those
[58:44] who gave their lives both for
[58:46] the purpose of god in the land of israel
[58:49] and for freedom in our nation we we just
[58:52] honor we do we want to remember those
[58:54] who paid the ultimate price it doesn't
[58:57] matter whether you believe in war or
[58:59] agree with war or all the principles of
[59:01] war
[59:02] men went trusting
[59:04] that their lives would make a difference
[59:07] and not knowing whether or not they
[59:08] would come home and i for one appreciate
[59:10] that sacrifice families lost loved ones
[59:14] and they also made a sacrifice so we
[59:16] want to honor that uh tomorrow is also a
[59:20] another very special day chad it's may

[1:02:42] let him know and it's also i know it's
[1:02:46] calendar's taking a long time this
[1:02:47] morning but uh sometimes we have no
[1:02:50] birthdays in a week but it's also heir
[1:02:53] shavuot and what that means is at
[1:02:56] sundown the biblical feast of shavuot
[1:03:00] begins
[1:03:01] and the church knows that better as
[1:03:04] pentecost so next weekend we celebrate
[1:03:08] the birth of the church
[1:03:10] the prophet is clear to tell us that the
[1:03:13] church was born on the day of pentecost
[1:03:16] he says it
[1:03:17] and he said she is a pentecostal church
[1:03:21] he said in fact any church that's not a
[1:03:23] pentecostal church by experience is not
[1:03:26] a real church
[1:03:27] he said because you've got a pattern
[1:03:29] like the original
[1:03:31] and so uh it's a wonderful time for us
[1:03:34] to to think about
[1:03:36] the goodness of god and what he's done
[1:03:38] for us
[1:03:40] and uh the jewish nation celebrates the
[1:03:42] giving of the torah the giving of the
[1:03:44] law on mount sinai took place during
[1:03:47] shavu time and we celebrate the baptism
[1:03:50] of the holy ghost
[1:03:52] there's a white bowl back there and
[1:03:55] i was going to tell them to just move it
[1:03:57] aside a little bit if they needed to
[1:03:59] because
[1:04:00] i know that mamaw would be very very
[1:04:02] happy to know that emily was sitting in
[1:04:04] her seat
[1:04:06] with that sweet little baby girl this
[1:04:08] morning
[1:04:09] and i wanted if they need to make room
[1:04:11] uh by moving that a little bit they can
[1:04:13] but
[1:04:14] for those of you who were able to be at
[1:04:17] sister tebow's funeral
[1:04:19] homegoing celebration here
[1:04:22] the lord his presence was real the
[1:04:24] building was was packed full
[1:04:26] and uh her family was uh
[1:04:30] just really really uh under
[1:04:33] uh a wonderful attitude and a wonderful
[1:04:36] spirit i know there was grieving but
[1:04:38] you know it it's uh it's hard
[1:04:41] uh to to just be broken in pieces all
[1:04:44] the time
[1:04:46] when you catch a thought or a glimpse of
[1:04:48] knowing how she had lived her life to be
[1:04:51] present with the lord and so there was a
[1:04:55] lot of joy there was sadness but there
[1:04:57] was also a lot of joy and there was a
[1:04:59] lot of witnessing that was taking place
[1:05:02] and uh
[1:05:03] i won't tell you this morning in the
[1:05:05] pulpit we'll tell it later if we're
[1:05:08] fellowshipping today but there was a bit
[1:05:10] of a celebrity here
[1:05:12] uh or at least the son of a celebrity
[1:05:15] and
[1:05:16] uh who was at the funeral and i didn't
[1:05:19] even know this until after the graveside
[1:05:22] but but at the graveside he walked up to
[1:05:24] me and he said i don't normally say
[1:05:26] things like this but he said you're real
[1:05:30] and this church is real
[1:05:32] he said i know this is real
[1:05:34] he said i know the difference and this
[1:05:36] is real well i thought that was nice i i
[1:05:39] said a little something and uh you know
[1:05:41] trying to respond and and he said a few
[1:05:44] more things that i won't mention just
[1:05:46] now
[1:05:47] then i get in the vehicle and i'm making
[1:05:50] some comment about it and they said well
[1:05:51] you know who he is don't you he's the
[1:05:53] son of a very famous comedian
[1:05:55] and i didn't know that doesn't matter
[1:05:57] he's the same as anybody else right
[1:06:00] but i just thought lord
[1:06:02] look at mamaw she testified her whole
[1:06:05] life telling everybody about the
[1:06:07] goodness of god
[1:06:08] and then she leaves us

[1:06:13] witness is still going out because if
[1:06:15] you heard brother billy's testimony

[1:08:06] all the time
[1:08:08] i want you to turn again to luke chapter
[1:08:10] 4 if you will
[1:08:12] i want to read verses 16 through 21.
[1:08:16] we're in the middle of a series here
[1:08:19] uh
[1:08:20] and we're talking about total
[1:08:22] deliverance
[1:08:24] but we understand by the word of the
[1:08:26] lord that total deliverance
[1:08:29] requires a total separation
[1:08:32] from unbelief
[1:08:34] and we're not all there yet
[1:08:36] but we're working to get unbelief out of
[1:08:38] our life
[1:08:40] because we want a total deliverance
[1:08:42] we're looking for that and i know we
[1:08:45] read this some services back but i want
[1:08:47] to just get this in the record again
[1:08:49] in luke chapter four and he came to
[1:08:51] nazareth where he had been brought up as
[1:08:54] his custom was
[1:08:56] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:08:58] sabbath day
[1:09:00] and stood up for to read
[1:09:03] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:09:05] book of the prophet isaias and when he
[1:09:07] had opened the book he found the place
[1:09:10] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:09:13] lord is upon me
[1:09:16] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:09:20] the gospel to the poor
[1:09:23] he hath sent me to heal the
[1:09:26] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:09:30] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:09:34] the blind to set at liberty
[1:09:38] them that are
[1:09:41] that are bruised to preach
[1:09:43] the acceptable year of the lord now we
[1:09:47] know that the acceptable year of the
[1:09:50] lord is the year of the lord's favor
[1:09:53] and it refers to in leviticus
[1:09:57] the jubilee year
[1:09:59] the 50th year
[1:10:01] pentecost is a 50th year it's a 50 it's
[1:10:05] a 50 we should say
[1:10:07] and so
[1:10:08] when he is standing up he is declaring
[1:10:11] that there will be a jubilee of jubilees
[1:10:16] when this scripture is fulfilled
[1:10:19] this is going to be the ultimate year of
[1:10:21] the lord's favor a season of real
[1:10:25] deliverance and of real jubilee because
[1:10:28] the one that is to bring
[1:10:30] all of this healing
[1:10:32] uh he will come from god
[1:10:35] and his ministry here's his mandate this
[1:10:38] is the ministry mandate of jesus to
[1:10:41] preach the gospel to the poor to heal
[1:10:44] the brokenhearted to preach deliverance
[1:10:46] to the captive sight recovering of sight
[1:10:49] to the blind and to sit at liberty them
[1:10:51] that are bruised
[1:10:53] so this is
[1:10:54] the ministry mandate
[1:10:57] and the model of our lord and he closed
[1:10:59] the book and gave it again
[1:11:01] to the minister and sat down and the
[1:11:04] eyes of all them that were in the
[1:11:08] synagogue were fastened on him
[1:11:10] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:11:15] this day remember it was not permitted
[1:11:19] for him to speak
[1:11:21] he made aliyah he came up to the bhima
[1:11:24] he read from the scroll of isaias his
[1:11:27] job now was to go sit down and be quiet
[1:11:30] perhaps another person would come and
[1:11:32] read another portion because there was a
[1:11:35] portion set aside for every sabbath
[1:11:38] and so he did something highly out of
[1:11:41] the ordinary
[1:11:42] as he's walking back to his seat he
[1:11:45] announces to all of those who were
[1:11:48] gathered in the synagogue that day this
[1:11:50] day
[1:11:51] it's powerful amen this day
[1:11:54] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:11:58] they begin to look around and wonder
[1:12:00] isn't this isn't this joseph's son
[1:12:03] isn't this boy just an ordinary boy the
[1:12:07] son of an ordinary man an ordinary
[1:12:09] carpenter and here he has declared i am
[1:12:13] the one about whom this scripture is
[1:12:16] written
[1:12:17] father we thank you today
[1:12:19] that you are indeed that one and you
[1:12:22] have gathered us in your name cleansed
[1:12:25] us by your blood filled us with your
[1:12:28] spirit sanctified us by your word
[1:12:32] today we are gathered in your name to
[1:12:34] lift you up and to exalt you and to
[1:12:37] declare again that you are the same god
[1:12:41] and that you are still setting captives
[1:12:44] free
[1:12:44] and that there is no reason why any of
[1:12:47] us should have to continue to labor
[1:12:50] under a load of slavery
[1:12:52] for you are the great emancipator
[1:12:55] and you have set us free from the law of
[1:12:58] sin and from the law of death we ask now
[1:13:02] that you would anoint our ears and our
[1:13:04] hearts to receive your word and anoint
[1:13:07] your servant to share it and we'll give
[1:13:09] you the glory and the honor and the
[1:13:11] praise for it's in the name of the lord
[1:13:13] jesus christ we pray and the saint said
[1:13:17] amen you may be seated
[1:13:19] we know from leviticus 25
[1:13:22] and they'll flash the list up there for
[1:13:25] you again
[1:13:26] that in the jubilee
[1:13:28] four things were to take place
[1:13:31] and that was number one all men
[1:13:35] were proclaimed to be free
[1:13:38] number two all the prison doors were
[1:13:41] opened number three all slaves were
[1:13:45] released
[1:13:46] and number four all returned to his
[1:13:49] original possession or his original
[1:13:53] inheritance what we have received in
[1:13:56] jesus christ is not just a jubilee
[1:14:00] but it is what the old testament tells
[1:14:02] in hebrew calls in hebrew a jubilee of
[1:14:05] jubilees
[1:14:06] we're talking about one that once it
[1:14:09] begins it doesn't have an ending
[1:14:12] now we who study the hebrew scriptures
[1:14:14] have learned that in the history of
[1:14:17] israel there is very little record of
[1:14:20] israel ever observing very many of the
[1:14:24] 50-year jubilee
[1:14:26] there was always something going on they
[1:14:28] were either in slavery they were in
[1:14:31] bondage they were occupied they were
[1:14:34] under some adverse circumstance and it
[1:14:37] seemed like every time the 50th year
[1:14:40] would come around that there would be
[1:14:42] some reason why they were not able to
[1:14:45] allow the land to remain fallow without
[1:14:48] any planting and without any any hoeing
[1:14:51] and without any work only to eat that
[1:14:54] which would spring up of itself from the
[1:14:57] ground and you know i find that to be a
[1:14:59] tragedy of sort we know that there were
[1:15:03] times that the jubilee was celebrated
[1:15:07] and there were some times in history
[1:15:10] that slaves went free but i also wonder
[1:15:13] if if maybe it wasn't for a reason
[1:15:16] because it always kept them looking
[1:15:19] toward the next
[1:15:21] i believe they said well this year we
[1:15:23] didn't get to but but next year next 50
[1:15:27] years
[1:15:28] next 50 years
[1:15:29] if i'm not alive to see it all
[1:15:33] possessions return to their original
[1:15:36] owners all inheritance given back to
[1:15:38] those who owned it in the beginning my
[1:15:41] children will see it
[1:15:43] and if if they don't see it in their
[1:15:46] time my grandchildren may see it
[1:15:49] and so they just kept looking to the
[1:15:52] next 50 years and the next 50 years and
[1:15:56] the next 50 years there were margins of
[1:15:58] fulfillment there were times that some
[1:16:01] of these things happened but very few
[1:16:04] times that all of the different
[1:16:07] aspects of jubilee actually take place
[1:16:10] and then one day
[1:16:12] all these years later in a little
[1:16:14] synagogue in nazareth stands a little
[1:16:17] humble man
[1:16:19] the son of a poor carpenter come on
[1:16:23] one that's very familiar to all of the
[1:16:25] people there this is his hometown and he
[1:16:28] gets up to make his aliyah he comes up
[1:16:31] ascends up to the bhima and he begins to
[1:16:34] read and walking down he says this day
[1:16:39] this day
[1:16:40] this scripture
[1:16:42] is fulfilled in your ears
[1:16:45] now you know what he's saying
[1:16:46] because it the acceptable year of the
[1:16:48] lord was absolutely referring to the
[1:16:52] jubilee
[1:16:53] now he said this day this scripture is
[1:16:56] fulfilled in your ears we have no
[1:16:58] history to tell us that that was indeed
[1:17:01] a 50th year
[1:17:03] we have no history to prove to us that
[1:17:06] that was indeed an actual jubilee and
[1:17:08] yet he would say jubilee is here
[1:17:12] jubilee deliverance is here
[1:17:15] healing for the brokenhearted is here
[1:17:18] sight for the blind is here and how many
[1:17:21] of you know then for nearly 2 000 years
[1:17:23] we can say jubilee is here
[1:17:26] hallelujah
[1:17:28] then why do we find ourselves slaving
[1:17:31] when he has done such a perfect work on
[1:17:34] our behalf
[1:17:35] why do we feel like we have to strive
[1:17:38] to see how good we can get
[1:17:40] when we realize there is nothing good in
[1:17:43] me
[1:17:45] i am not capable of doing good without
[1:17:48] the good one here who lives inside of me
[1:17:51] even the greatest missionary and apostle
[1:17:54] of them all the apostle paul he was
[1:17:56] struggling he had been in ministry for
[1:17:59] years and he said when i seek to do that
[1:18:02] which is right evil is present
[1:18:05] in my innermost being there is a warfare
[1:18:08] going on oh wretched man that i am who
[1:18:11] will deliver me from this
[1:18:15] now you know what paul was the first
[1:18:17] church age messenger
[1:18:19] and the church ages begin to unfold in
[1:18:22] his ministry and go on but according to
[1:18:25] the bible there's a seventh there's a
[1:18:27] seventh age
[1:18:29] there's a seventh atmosphere and that
[1:18:32] was laodicea
[1:18:34] and we find ourselves in the laodicean
[1:18:37] church age now
[1:18:38] and we find a church that isn't either
[1:18:40] hot
[1:18:42] are you with me
[1:18:43] neither cold
[1:18:45] but lukewarm
[1:18:46] and why don't we just go a little bit
[1:18:48] farther and say and in great need of
[1:18:52] deliverance great need of deliverance
[1:18:57] so so many of us
[1:18:59] were over there you know hoeing our way
[1:19:02] through religion
[1:19:05] in our respective churches
[1:19:07] doing all that we knew to do
[1:19:10] they're always putting something new on
[1:19:13] us
[1:19:17] always some new rule i'm not against
[1:19:20] convictions
[1:19:21] but i'm talking about rules and
[1:19:23] regulations
[1:19:25] and you know people would
[1:19:27] we would have testimony service and
[1:19:29] people would use the testimony service
[1:19:31] to say oh
[1:19:33] i
[1:19:34] i need to pray more
[1:19:36] that's not really a testimony
[1:19:38] it's a confession and we don't have
[1:19:40] booths
[1:19:44] it's i need to oh if i could just read
[1:19:47] the bible more
[1:19:48] oh if i could just pray more
[1:19:51] if i could just fast more if i could
[1:19:53] just do something else more and there we
[1:19:56] go just continuing to hoe down the road
[1:20:00] always in the grind
[1:20:02] trying to convince ourselves of god's
[1:20:05] love for us
[1:20:07] amen never feeling worthy
[1:20:10] we sing these old songs you know
[1:20:13] unworthy of
[1:20:15] unworthy unworthy a wretched poor law
[1:20:19] sinner
[1:20:21] and then we're afraid we get a little
[1:20:23] better and but we're afraid to tell it
[1:20:25] exactly like it is so then we say
[1:20:28] i'm just a sinner
[1:20:31] saved by grace
[1:20:33] you know this is a very strange
[1:20:35] identification to me
[1:20:37] sinner
[1:20:38] saved by grace
[1:20:42] i know this is kind of the 12-step way
[1:20:47] i understand this is 12-step mentality
[1:20:50] alway i'm an alcoholic always will be
[1:20:54] so i'm just always in recovery
[1:20:57] but i want you to understand that there
[1:20:59] came a day that the jubilee of jubilees
[1:21:02] was announced
[1:21:04] and jesus said that one that the
[1:21:07] prophets prophesied about here i am
[1:21:10] this day the scripture
[1:21:13] is fulfilled in your ears
[1:21:15] you don't have to continue to hold the
[1:21:18] role of religion
[1:21:21] never feeling like god has done a good
[1:21:24] enough work in you
[1:21:27] you know we're not only reflecting on
[1:21:29] ourselves when we have this mentality
[1:21:32] but we're actually also reflecting on
[1:21:34] him
[1:21:35] i want you to know he knows how to save
[1:21:37] us
[1:21:38] and sanctify us
[1:21:40] from the gutter most to the uttermost
[1:21:43] he knows how to take us from
[1:21:45] dysfunctional to super functional
[1:21:49] i don't want to just function normally
[1:21:52] the world is full of normal
[1:21:55] normal's overrated
[1:21:57] i want to function super naturally
[1:22:01] because we've been called to be
[1:22:04] a supernatural people
[1:22:06] if you believe that say amen
[1:22:08] all right now um
[1:22:11] let's go to the message jubilee year
[1:22:14] we're studying this this morning
[1:22:17] let's go to jubilee year paragraph 73
[1:22:21] and let's hit one of these little
[1:22:22] quotations that we have already used
[1:22:26] from the jubilee year
[1:22:28] now in these days
[1:22:31] when these priests
[1:22:33] they would take the man out there and
[1:22:35] maybe hoeing in the cornfield
[1:22:38] the master walking down whipping him
[1:22:40] with a whip we're talking about bible
[1:22:43] days
[1:22:44] whipping him with a whip hurry up there
[1:22:47] got to hurry up with this
[1:22:49] but just as soon as what what
[1:22:53] what trumpet is this this was the
[1:22:55] jubilee trumpet
[1:22:57] there is a sound to jubilee
[1:23:01] jubilee has a sound
[1:23:03] you got to know what sound is going
[1:23:06] forth
[1:23:06] you've got to recognize the voice that
[1:23:09] follows the trumpet
[1:23:11] and as soon as that trumpet sounded that
[1:23:14] man could throw his hoe down
[1:23:17] and he could say i won't hold with it no
[1:23:20] more
[1:23:22] and that taskmaster
[1:23:24] that slave driver was forbidden to touch
[1:23:28] him anymore
[1:23:30] simply because the 50th year had come
[1:23:33] and no matter what was remaining on the
[1:23:35] balance of the debt right the debt was
[1:23:38] cleared are you with me
[1:23:40] the inheritance went back
[1:23:43] to the hands of the original owner and
[1:23:45] he didn't have to hold any anymore for
[1:23:47] somebody else
[1:23:48] if he ever picked up a whole again he
[1:23:50] was doing it for himself to provide for
[1:23:53] his own family not to take care of some
[1:23:55] slave driver or some master out there i
[1:23:58] want you to know something god's people
[1:24:01] are not to be a bound up people
[1:24:04] we're not to be of depressed people
[1:24:07] i'm just being honest with you and you
[1:24:09] know my testimony and you know that i
[1:24:12] know what it means to struggle with
[1:24:14] depression but i want you to know
[1:24:16] depression cannot be my identity
[1:24:21] it can't be my anthem
[1:24:23] it can't be who i am
[1:24:26] i was depressed
[1:24:29] now i know that he has lifted me above
[1:24:33] and beyond my place of depression
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:37] it gives us a new identity
[1:24:40] it it removes our
[1:24:42] hoes it destroys our crutches
[1:24:46] it does away with our excuses
[1:24:50] and at some point we just have to take
[1:24:52] him at his word
[1:24:54] and say lord i'm free
[1:24:56] i'm not free because i feel free
[1:25:00] i'm free because he said i'm free
[1:25:04] and i'm clinging to his word
[1:25:06] you see we're literal christians here we
[1:25:08] believe the bible is true
[1:25:11] and that it can be interpreted literally
[1:25:14] even though it's a supernatural gospel
[1:25:17] and if god said i've come to set the
[1:25:19] captive free
[1:25:21] then i have to believe that anything
[1:25:23] that holds me back anything that binds
[1:25:27] me
[1:25:28] anything that ties me down i have to
[1:25:31] believe that if i can trust his truth
[1:25:35] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:25:37] shall
[1:25:38] it shall make you
[1:25:40] free
[1:25:43] now in the message of total deliverance
[1:25:46] are you ready to go there
[1:25:47] let before we do show me first
[1:25:49] thessalonians i know i got you jumping
[1:25:51] all around
[1:25:52] sister charity
[1:25:56] sister beverly said that's all right
[1:26:00] i'm waiting on charities that's all
[1:26:02] right
[1:26:04] first thessalonians 5 23 and the very
[1:26:07] god of peace
[1:26:11] the god of shalom
[1:26:13] sanctify you
[1:26:16] holy read it holy
[1:26:18] w-h-o-l-l-y
[1:26:23] holy and i pray god your whole spirit
[1:26:26] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:26:30] unto the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:32] now do you believe that's just a great
[1:26:34] salutation or do you believe that's
[1:26:36] possible
[1:26:37] it's a part of the word
[1:26:39] so i believe it's possible i believe
[1:26:41] it's the will of god to sanctify me to
[1:26:44] set me apart holy
[1:26:47] w-h-o-l-l-y my whole spirit
[1:26:50] my whole soul mind will and emotions and
[1:26:53] my whole body to be preserved blameless
[1:26:55] until the coming of the lord jesus
[1:26:57] christ i have to believe that
[1:26:59] entirely the new american standard says
[1:27:02] entirely the the complete jewish bible
[1:27:05] says completely holy
[1:27:08] completely set apart and that's not
[1:27:10] based on my holiness
[1:27:14] can i talk to you a minute about the
[1:27:15] bush
[1:27:17] did you know there was a mountain full
[1:27:19] of bushes
[1:27:21] there was a mountain full of bushes
[1:27:23] one day moses was walking along the
[1:27:25] trail of that mountain
[1:27:27] and god came down and crawled into a
[1:27:31] bush
[1:27:34] and a voice spoke out of that bush and
[1:27:36] said take off your shoes moses
[1:27:39] unless your sandals
[1:27:42] because the ground that you are now
[1:27:44] standing on is
[1:27:46] holy ground i want to know what made it
[1:27:48] holy
[1:27:50] i i want to know what made that bush any
[1:27:52] different than any other bush on that
[1:27:54] mountain
[1:27:59] there it is
[1:28:00] it was the god in the bush
[1:28:03] i want you to know that ordinarily if
[1:28:05] you look at our life compare it with
[1:28:07] somebody else's
[1:28:09] we're really in the natural in the
[1:28:11] physical no better than anybody else no
[1:28:14] more special
[1:28:16] not more intelligent or more talented or
[1:28:18] more gifted
[1:28:20] when god said i'm going to make you a
[1:28:22] holy people he meant i'm going to put
[1:28:25] myself on you
[1:28:27] i'm going to eventually live in you by
[1:28:30] the baptism of the holy ghost and that's
[1:28:32] what's going to make you holy
[1:28:34] i believe in coming out of the world
[1:28:37] i believe in mentally and emotionally
[1:28:39] checking out of this world and making
[1:28:41] sure that you have a different life than
[1:28:44] the world around you i believe in that
[1:28:47] i believe in that i believe that there
[1:28:48] are clear distinctions that god gives us
[1:28:50] in his word he said i want men to look
[1:28:53] like men
[1:28:54] and i want women to look like women
[1:28:57] and i want them to know the difference
[1:28:59] and i know we're living in an hour where
[1:29:01] there's a total confusion on the issue
[1:29:03] but god is not confused he just keeps
[1:29:05] doing it like he has always done it
[1:29:08] but i want you to understand that you
[1:29:10] could live like a monk
[1:29:13] in a little shack on the side of the
[1:29:15] mountain and eat cornbread and drink
[1:29:17] water the rest of your life and not be
[1:29:19] any more holy
[1:29:23] because it's not what you do
[1:29:27] that makes you holy
[1:29:29] that bush didn't do anything different
[1:29:31] than any other bush it did what it
[1:29:33] always did just stood there
[1:29:36] do i look like a bush
[1:29:40] it just stood there
[1:29:42] it just did what it had always done
[1:29:44] every day of its life and one day god
[1:29:47] said you're mine
[1:29:49] today you're my bush
[1:29:53] i created every bush on this mountain
[1:29:56] but today you're my bush
[1:29:58] i choose you
[1:30:00] didn't the word say you have not chosen
[1:30:02] me but i have chosen you says the lord
[1:30:08] so what he did he chose a bush he put
[1:30:11] himself in that bush he speaks out of
[1:30:15] that bush
[1:30:17] giving moses his commission and because
[1:30:20] god is standing there in that bush the
[1:30:23] ground
[1:30:24] becomes holy ground
[1:30:28] because god is there
[1:30:30] today you have become a holy people amen
[1:30:37] even brother greeley
[1:30:44] who had a lot of heathen friends
[1:30:52] i had i saw an episode or two myself
[1:30:55] he was my favorite
[1:30:59] my kids say sometimes he's still your
[1:31:01] favorite
[1:31:02] because of that uh one saying i
[1:31:04] remembered it all the way through the
[1:31:06] years you know you won't like me went on
[1:31:10] you won't like me when i'm angry
[1:31:13] that was right before the green
[1:31:17] and the clothes started popping off of
[1:31:19] him i'm we're talking way back now
[1:31:22] even brother greeley
[1:31:25] who come to instruct us this morning
[1:31:28] from the hulk
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:31] it's not about that
[1:31:35] we don't have a license to just fill our
[1:31:38] minds on everything the world has to
[1:31:40] offer
[1:31:41] but i want you to know you couldn't get
[1:31:43] secluded enough
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:49] you see i traveled with a friend who
[1:31:50] wore a saffron robe
[1:31:53] and it really got in our way
[1:31:59] i love my brother he's still my brother
[1:32:01] still my friend
[1:32:03] but when i traveled with him throughout
[1:32:05] india and him wearing the saffron robe
[1:32:08] everyone thought that initially when
[1:32:10] they saw him and his beard and his hair
[1:32:12] and his saffron rope they immediately
[1:32:14] thought that he was a hindu priest
[1:32:18] and so everywhere we went people wanted
[1:32:20] to be blessed
[1:32:23] and so he's blessing them all right
[1:32:28] they would kneel down and he said in the
[1:32:29] name of jesus
[1:32:34] and they would look at him like what
[1:32:37] i didn't want a blessing in the name of
[1:32:39] jesus
[1:32:43] i remember one time someone said i
[1:32:45] didn't know about this jesus he said you
[1:32:48] do now he just blessed you
[1:32:53] but it took so long to get anywhere
[1:32:56] traveling through the airport
[1:33:00] and i always told him when i really
[1:33:02] needed your holiness
[1:33:07] i really needed his holiness one day
[1:33:09] brother when we were on a helicopter
[1:33:13] in the in the foothills of the himalayas
[1:33:18] and we are flying
[1:33:20] from a small airport in northern india
[1:33:22] all the way up into the into the
[1:33:25] area of sukim the most northern province
[1:33:28] of india
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:30] we're doing that because it takes hours
[1:33:32] to get there by car
[1:33:34] and only about 40 minutes to get there
[1:33:36] by helicopter
[1:33:38] and i said to him he said i have a car
[1:33:40] waiting on you here
[1:33:43] if you'd like to go by car but he said
[1:33:45] we won't see you till tonight
[1:33:47] but he said you're welcome there's room
[1:33:49] and i'd like for you to go with me in
[1:33:50] the helicopter i said but i really don't
[1:33:51] like helicopters
[1:33:54] i said they move really funny
[1:33:57] i'm used to airplanes and i don't like
[1:33:59] little ones either but but i i
[1:34:02] but but he began to tell me he said the
[1:34:04] road
[1:34:05] is so curvy that you feel like you're
[1:34:06] coming back to meet yourself
[1:34:09] and he said every few miles sometimes
[1:34:12] feet
[1:34:13] you have to stop for the monkeys
[1:34:16] because he said they hear the car coming
[1:34:18] and they run into the road
[1:34:21] by the hundreds
[1:34:23] wanting a treat
[1:34:25] because they're sacred
[1:34:27] there's a god a hindu god looks like a
[1:34:30] monkey
[1:34:31] and he said there they'll run into the
[1:34:32] road nobody's going to run over them
[1:34:35] nobody's going to even scare them out of
[1:34:37] the way
[1:34:38] they're just going to slow down and
[1:34:40] throw some treats out and and he said so
[1:34:43] the more he talked the more i said let
[1:34:44] me in that helicopter
[1:34:49] and he said i'll pray with you i'll pray
[1:34:51] with you everything will be all right so
[1:34:53] we get in that helicopter and i want you
[1:34:55] to know it looks as though i can reach
[1:34:57] out
[1:34:58] the door of the helicopter and touch the
[1:35:00] mountaintops
[1:35:02] we are flying down in a narrow narrow
[1:35:05] narra
[1:35:09] and i i i got my eyes closed i'm trying
[1:35:14] to find peace
[1:35:18] and then it drops
[1:35:20] then it goes flying back up like that
[1:35:22] and then
[1:35:24] it looks as though we are disturbing
[1:35:26] vegetation
[1:35:28] we're so close to the sides of the
[1:35:30] mountain that i see the grasses blowing
[1:35:32] on the mountain from the spinning of the
[1:35:34] propeller i said this is dangerous
[1:35:38] this is dangerous
[1:35:39] brother brother i called his name i
[1:35:41] don't want to say it on here i said
[1:35:42] brother this is dangerous
[1:35:44] isn't it brother
[1:35:46] nothing
[1:35:50] and i turned over there look at him he's
[1:35:52] told me he was going to help me through
[1:35:54] this with prayer he is snoring
[1:36:00] and when we get off there i said when i
[1:36:02] needed your holiness
[1:36:04] there was none
[1:36:07] so i had to depend on my ability to call
[1:36:10] on the lord
[1:36:12] but he got me through
[1:36:14] it is not our holiness
[1:36:16] it is not our righteousness
[1:36:18] it is not our uniform
[1:36:21] it's because before the foundation of
[1:36:24] the world god saw a people in his mind
[1:36:28] that would choose him even way over in
[1:36:31] wicked laodicea
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:34] they would choose a different path to
[1:36:37] follow the mandate of the master come on
[1:36:41] and by that he allowed you to come in
[1:36:43] this hour and he because you've called
[1:36:45] on him he knew you would
[1:36:47] he saw you doing it before you did
[1:36:50] and he poured his righteousness on you
[1:36:53] just like he chose a bush not a special
[1:36:55] bush just a bush but it became the most
[1:36:58] special bush on that mountain because
[1:37:00] god crawled into it let me tell you in
[1:37:03] an upper room
[1:37:06] we'll talk about it next sunday but in
[1:37:08] an upper room
[1:37:10] pillar of fire divided itself
[1:37:12] into all those little licks of fire and
[1:37:15] hung over their heads
[1:37:18] and what was it it wasn't emmanuel god
[1:37:21] with us anymore it was now god in us
[1:37:25] by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:37:29] fire he's now living in
[1:37:32] us there's no reason why
[1:37:35] we can't walk in deliverance
[1:37:38] paragraph 80 of a total deliverance
[1:37:40] we're not getting very far
[1:37:42] that's on me
[1:37:45] pharaoh wanted to agree
[1:37:47] said moses you all can go
[1:37:49] but
[1:37:50] leave your children behind or leave some
[1:37:52] of your i know i read this tuesday night
[1:37:54] but i'm reading it again
[1:37:55] some of your cattle back here he said
[1:37:57] that's the way the devil wants a
[1:37:58] christian to come it'll be all right for
[1:38:00] you to join the church
[1:38:02] but don't never forgive jones
[1:38:05] it'll be all right if you can if you can
[1:38:06] go come on
[1:38:08] you don't have to give up your smoking
[1:38:09] drinking line stealing fault finding
[1:38:11] back body you don't have to give that up
[1:38:13] just join the church
[1:38:15] let me tell you something that's not
[1:38:16] what we're looking for
[1:38:18] we're not looking for the church to tell
[1:38:19] us we're all right
[1:38:21] the bible said you'll know you're saved
[1:38:23] by the coming of life by the quickening
[1:38:25] of life by the coming alive of your
[1:38:29] spirit amen your spirit
[1:38:32] he said but moses wasn't a compromiser
[1:38:34] he wanted
[1:38:36] say it for me
[1:38:38] complete
[1:38:42] not this
[1:38:43] get up and down roller coaster
[1:38:45] feel good don't feel good believe it
[1:38:47] don't believe it no no complete
[1:38:49] deliverance he said we'll not leave one
[1:38:51] hoof behind we'll take everything that
[1:38:53] belongs to us when we go to worship the
[1:38:54] lord
[1:38:55] hallelujah that's the way the church
[1:38:57] ought to be we'll take righteousness
[1:39:00] we'll take holiness
[1:39:03] we'll take the holy spirit
[1:39:05] we'll take a unified group when we go to
[1:39:07] the altar we'll be a real group
[1:39:10] folks that's what we want in this little
[1:39:12] house
[1:39:13] we want a real group we want a real
[1:39:15] family we want people who will go all
[1:39:18] the way to the altar together who will
[1:39:20] go into total deliverance together
[1:39:23] who refuse to settle or compromise with
[1:39:26] anything less than what the ministry
[1:39:28] mandate of jesus promised healing to the
[1:39:31] brokenhearted
[1:39:33] deliverance to the captive
[1:39:35] he said there won't be one hoof stay
[1:39:37] back here you know and people can pray
[1:39:38] in such a way till the devil will have
[1:39:40] to give in
[1:39:41] he does have to give up
[1:39:43] when he sees a people that won't turn
[1:39:45] here and there and everywhere and be
[1:39:47] persuaded by every wind of every
[1:39:49] doctrine and every thought on google
[1:39:51] he's looking for a people that'll trust
[1:39:53] him more than dr google
[1:39:56] he said that's the way moses and his
[1:39:57] group did they got over here and got
[1:39:59] under the blood
[1:40:00] i want under the blood
[1:40:02] i don't want you to leave today until
[1:40:04] you know that you are under the blood
[1:40:06] come on now
[1:40:10] he said you noticed until they got under
[1:40:12] the blood there was no
[1:40:16] moses himself he was a unified with god
[1:40:19] but israel wasn't
[1:40:21] the prophet got in first
[1:40:23] and the people followed
[1:40:25] always a forerunner there still was sin
[1:40:28] he said and they murmured against moses
[1:40:30] and they said why why do you do this you
[1:40:32] bring more trouble upon us because
[1:40:34] pharaoh just doubled their tally of
[1:40:36] bricks and so forth remember he said
[1:40:38] just because they're going to have to
[1:40:39] they're going to have to produce twice
[1:40:41] as many bricks
[1:40:43] he didn't like this this
[1:40:44] church talk
[1:40:46] he said that was moses he was completely
[1:40:48] in the hands of god
[1:40:54] the prophet told us he said the world is
[1:40:56] yet to see
[1:40:59] the world is yet to see what can happen
[1:41:01] what can be accomplished
[1:41:03] when one man totally surrenders
[1:41:08] i think he was the closest to that man
[1:41:10] that we would ever have as an example
[1:41:13] and yet he said the world hadn't seen it
[1:41:15] yet
[1:41:17] the heaviness of the mandate that god
[1:41:19] had placed on his life perhaps affected
[1:41:22] him i want you to know it was a hard
[1:41:24] journey
[1:41:25] he fought some of the same oppressive
[1:41:27] thoughts that elijah dealt with
[1:41:30] when elijah said i'm the only one
[1:41:32] brother branham struggled with that
[1:41:35] he was a human
[1:41:37] he struggled with that idea
[1:41:39] there were times that he wondered if
[1:41:41] there'd be a handful even get out of
[1:41:43] laodicea but i've got good news for you
[1:41:47] i want you to know there's a bride
[1:41:49] that's being gathered even in this hour
[1:41:52] and she's bigger than a handful
[1:41:55] it may be a handful here and a handful
[1:41:57] there and a handful over yonder and in
[1:41:59] every nation of the world here's some
[1:42:01] and there's some and another group but
[1:42:03] god is getting his people together and
[1:42:06] he's doing it without denomination
[1:42:09] there's only one thing gathering them
[1:42:11] and that's the word they're just
[1:42:14] gathering to the word
[1:42:17] oh hallelujah
[1:42:20] you know there was a cry that went out
[1:42:22] years ago
[1:42:23] from this place
[1:42:26] and it came from
[1:42:28] from nehemiah's day
[1:42:31] and the scripture was quickened in our
[1:42:33] heart
[1:42:34] and we sounded a cry
[1:42:37] that that produced
[1:42:40] a body
[1:42:42] some
[1:42:43] gone on their own way
[1:42:45] some have gone back to god
[1:42:48] who sent them to us in the first place
[1:42:50] but there was a cry that went out that
[1:42:52] gathered to people here from many
[1:42:53] different places anybody with me it
[1:42:56] surely happened
[1:42:57] and it was sovereign and the cry that
[1:43:00] went out said the work is very great
[1:43:03] and very large
[1:43:05] and we are separated on the wall
[1:43:10] that separation is hard sometimes
[1:43:12] but it said in whatsoever place ye hear
[1:43:15] the sound of the trumpet
[1:43:18] what trumpet the one we're talking about
[1:43:20] the one that gathers the people together
[1:43:22] in whatsoever place you hear the sound
[1:43:24] of the trumpet resort ye
[1:43:27] thither
[1:43:28] get there
[1:43:30] for our god shall fight for us
[1:43:35] there's nowhere i would rather be than
[1:43:37] under the sound of that trumpet
[1:43:39] i want to stay under the voice of that
[1:43:43] trumpet
[1:43:44] because my jubilee is promised in that
[1:43:47] voice is anybody with me
[1:43:50] we'll leave that there that's the way uh
[1:43:53] he was completely in the hands of god
[1:43:55] totally delivered from sheep herding
[1:43:57] to her god sheep he was totally
[1:43:59] delivered himself but the people wasn't
[1:44:02] delivered because there was still
[1:44:08] you're blessed
[1:44:10] because your pastor still murmurs
[1:44:13] and it's not all hanging on you
[1:44:17] they can't say about me what they said
[1:44:19] about moses
[1:44:20] that he no longer murmured and only the
[1:44:22] people continue to murmur i still
[1:44:24] struggle sometime with murmuring
[1:44:29] you know it's not my bank account that
[1:44:31] causes me to murmur
[1:44:35] anybody want to take a guess at what
[1:44:36] makes me murmur the most
[1:44:38] people
[1:44:46] people
[1:44:49] boy you all got related to that you you
[1:44:53] you really understood that because some
[1:44:54] of you
[1:44:57] are those people
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:03] but i don't know another group of people
[1:45:05] in the whole wide world
[1:45:08] that i'd rather be a part of
[1:45:12] you hear me
[1:45:13] than this group of people one of these
[1:45:16] days you're going to see you're going to
[1:45:18] see some of us move up a little higher
[1:45:22] and when you do you better get there as
[1:45:24] fast as you can
[1:45:26] because that's the way it works
[1:45:28] when you see leadership getting a little
[1:45:30] higher
[1:45:33] when you see them coming out of that
[1:45:35] murmuring place
[1:45:37] getting into a place where they're not
[1:45:39] noticing what they used to notice
[1:45:41] it doesn't even affect them like it
[1:45:43] affected them before then you get up as
[1:45:46] fast as you can because that's how we
[1:45:49] follow god's order
[1:45:51] i want i mean it i want it out of me
[1:45:54] i don't want to murmur i don't want to
[1:45:56] complain i don't want a bellyache i
[1:45:58] don't want to be that kind of i want
[1:45:59] total deliverance
[1:46:02] come on now
[1:46:03] well i
[1:46:05] oh some years ago i saw today when i
[1:46:07] woke up this morning but i didn't want
[1:46:09] to quite disturb the house and
[1:46:12] and i did get on up pretty early but
[1:46:15] i'm laying there
[1:46:16] in the bed and i'm looking i like to
[1:46:18] check my memories
[1:46:20] for this day
[1:46:22] i like to go back and relive
[1:46:24] some of the great things that i've seen
[1:46:26] the lord doing places that i've been and
[1:46:28] i think it was 11 or 12 years ago on
[1:46:30] this day
[1:46:31] i posted on social media three steps
[1:46:36] three steps to having
[1:46:38] uh you know to overcoming whatever it is
[1:46:41] you need of government
[1:46:42] number one keep your eyes on jesus
[1:46:45] and don't look at people
[1:46:47] number two keep your eyes on jesus
[1:46:50] and don't look at people
[1:46:52] number three keep your eyes on jesus
[1:46:54] and don't look at people
[1:46:59] how is something so simple
[1:47:02] so complicated
[1:47:04] because we're not walking in total
[1:47:06] deliverance yet
[1:47:07] but i believe it's possible are you
[1:47:09] telling me that you believe that there
[1:47:11] will be people in the earth in the last
[1:47:13] days who live above the temptations of
[1:47:15] this lot if i didn't believe that i
[1:47:18] couldn't say i believe the whole word
[1:47:22] i have to say that i believe that
[1:47:23] because i believe the whole word
[1:47:26] and we know that it won't be for a long
[1:47:28] drawn-out stretch of time
[1:47:31] we know that it'll be for a quick short
[1:47:34] powerful demonstration
[1:47:36] of god's authority in the earth
[1:47:39] and then it shifts
[1:47:41] and the gospel the the wooing of god
[1:47:44] goes back to to
[1:47:46] to israel
[1:47:48] the gentiles have
[1:47:50] then in that day the last gentile the
[1:47:52] last one that's coming has come
[1:47:54] and god has manifested himself in the
[1:47:57] way that he promised with full adoption
[1:48:04] i i i don't want to go there i'll i will
[1:48:06] at some point
[1:48:07] now let's read on
[1:48:09] and we've got to hurry too
[1:48:10] uh why see
[1:48:13] there still was sin and they murmured
[1:48:15] against moses and they said why why do
[1:48:17] you do this you bring more trouble on us
[1:48:19] pharaoh just doubled their tally of
[1:48:20] bricks moses total delivered from sheep
[1:48:23] herding to heard god's sheep totally
[1:48:25] delivered himself but the people wasn't
[1:48:26] delivered because there was still
[1:48:28] murmuring among him one night when god
[1:48:30] ordained that a lamb should be killed a
[1:48:32] type of christ and the blood was dipped
[1:48:34] in hyssop with just weeds calm and
[1:48:36] humble and put over the little of the
[1:48:38] door and on the post that's when israel
[1:48:39] became
[1:48:42] completely delivered with not a hoof
[1:48:43] left behind all that belonged to them
[1:48:45] was delivered all that belonged to them
[1:48:47] was delivered whoop somebody grabbed
[1:48:49] that all that but all that belonged to
[1:48:52] them was delivered
[1:48:55] see jubilee didn't just promise that my
[1:48:57] inheritance would come back it promised
[1:48:59] that my whole family
[1:49:04] every bit of it
[1:49:07] you know we discovered i mentioned it
[1:49:09] twice now this is the third time i hope
[1:49:10] you'll grab it
[1:49:12] we we we found out in a little bit of a
[1:49:14] research that there was one place
[1:49:17] where the decree of jubilee had no
[1:49:20] effect
[1:49:22] and the prophet kept talking about him
[1:49:24] walling themselves in
[1:49:26] building all these walls getting tucked
[1:49:28] in
[1:49:31] inside a wall city
[1:49:34] didn't matter how loud the trumpet of
[1:49:36] jubilee was sounding outside
[1:49:39] and how many slaves were set free and
[1:49:41] how much land went back to its original
[1:49:43] owner but inside the wall city
[1:49:46] everything remained the same that really
[1:49:49] has been bothering me
[1:49:51] and then i got to thinking on that a
[1:49:52] couple weeks ago when i was studying
[1:49:54] this on a saturday my mind i thought
[1:49:56] nobody but god has a strategy
[1:49:59] for how to get inside a wall city
[1:50:04] but he knows how
[1:50:06] anybody know how god discovered how god
[1:50:09] delivered a people
[1:50:11] that that that
[1:50:12] god promised them
[1:50:14] a land he promised them an inheritance
[1:50:18] he promised but yet some of the enemy
[1:50:20] had closed themselves in these walled
[1:50:22] cities one was named jericho
[1:50:26] god said i'm going to give you
[1:50:28] everything in jericho
[1:50:32] so even when we wall ourselves in god
[1:50:35] knows how to get us
[1:50:37] and deliver us
[1:50:38] he knows how to get inside the city and
[1:50:40] what did he use
[1:50:42] what did he use
[1:50:44] he used a praising army
[1:50:46] he used a people that marched around the
[1:50:48] walls of jericho silently
[1:50:51] until just the right hour
[1:50:53] just the right appointed minute and
[1:50:56] those trumpets begin to sound and the
[1:50:58] people begin to lift up a shout that was
[1:51:01] heard throughout the land and the bible
[1:51:03] tells us the walls fell flat
[1:51:07] so even when someone has closed
[1:51:10] themselves in if they belong to god he
[1:51:14] knows how to penetrate the wall
[1:51:18] city anybody got any loved ones living
[1:51:21] in a walled city
[1:51:24] hiding
[1:51:27] taking their refuge behind the walls
[1:51:31] where the sound of jubilee has no effect
[1:51:33] on them but god knows how to get them
[1:51:35] walls down
[1:51:38] you know the the uh
[1:51:41] the language of that i've told you this
[1:51:43] before the language of that is is pretty
[1:51:45] powerful
[1:51:46] because in english it says the walls
[1:51:48] fell flat doesn't it i think it says
[1:51:50] something like that
[1:51:52] and so in your mind you get this idea
[1:51:55] you don't have to go there stay with me
[1:51:58] research later do your homework later
[1:52:02] when i think of that i think the wall
[1:52:04] standing then like that then you got to
[1:52:05] climb up you'd still have to do some
[1:52:07] climbing and maneuvering to get all
[1:52:08] those walls but archaeologists say
[1:52:10] they've not been able to find those
[1:52:11] walls
[1:52:13] not even rocks from those walls we're
[1:52:16] talking about big old walls
[1:52:18] we're not talking about little thin
[1:52:19] walls we're talking about huge walls
[1:52:21] usually big enough for at least a
[1:52:23] chariot if not more than one
[1:52:25] that's how they built cities in those
[1:52:26] days so i don't know what happened i
[1:52:28] don't know if the ground just opened up
[1:52:30] and the walls went down flat inside
[1:52:32] that's what many scholars actually
[1:52:33] believe at least believing scholars
[1:52:35] believe that actually the ground moved
[1:52:37] back and the walls just went down in
[1:52:39] into the ground
[1:52:40] i don't know if that's what happened if
[1:52:42] it turned to powder but all i know is
[1:52:44] that everything inside that city now
[1:52:46] belonged to the people that god had
[1:52:47] given it to you
[1:52:50] hallelujah
[1:52:52] there was a lot of death and a lot of
[1:52:53] destruction
[1:52:56] but god found the one that was his
[1:52:59] didn't he
[1:53:00] didn't he do it
[1:53:02] didn't seem like she would would really
[1:53:04] count for much
[1:53:06] her lifestyle had not been so profound
[1:53:10] and so clean but she had given refuge to
[1:53:13] some spies
[1:53:15] hadn't she
[1:53:17] and do you know she's mentioned in
[1:53:19] scripture
[1:53:20] as part of the plan
[1:53:23] oh yes god knows how i've got some loved
[1:53:26] ones over in them walled cities
[1:53:30] and when i get my total deliverance
[1:53:34] nothing is going to keep them from
[1:53:36] coming out
[1:53:38] our faith is going to bring them him
[1:53:41] bring them to him
[1:53:44] we're not looking to get them to join a
[1:53:45] church
[1:53:47] we don't have a church for them to join
[1:53:51] we don't have any membership
[1:53:54] we don't have a roster
[1:53:57] we don't have a church role
[1:54:00] we don't give people the right hand to
[1:54:02] fellowship
[1:54:04] sometimes we have to give them a right
[1:54:06] foot of fellowship
[1:54:08] but not a right hand of fellowship it
[1:54:10] happens sometime
[1:54:12] it happens sometimes we ought to be
[1:54:14] honest about it
[1:54:15] there are times you just can't walk
[1:54:17] together
[1:54:18] that doesn't mean that god doesn't see
[1:54:20] both he loves both he cares for both
[1:54:23] just like he did the apostles who
[1:54:25] couldn't minister together
[1:54:26] he didn't quit blessing either one of
[1:54:28] them
[1:54:29] that's his grace
[1:54:30] that's his goodness
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:34] amen someone said i want to move my
[1:54:36] letter what
[1:54:40] what letter
[1:54:43] we don't have letters
[1:54:46] i remember being a boy and going to
[1:54:48] church with my mamaw
[1:54:50] and they would they would say
[1:54:52] at the end of the service they'd say you
[1:54:54] know who wants to trust jesus as your
[1:54:55] savior yeah and join the church and are
[1:54:57] there any here for they want to move
[1:54:59] your letter
[1:55:03] what they mean is they want you to bring
[1:55:05] your church letter and now leave your
[1:55:07] church and join their church
[1:55:10] and so constantly there was a stream of
[1:55:12] people going from church to church to
[1:55:14] church to church
[1:55:16] looking for the perfect one
[1:55:20] still do that don't they
[1:55:24] and it's perfect till they show up
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:28] man it's not perfect anymore
[1:55:31] there is no perfect church except his
[1:55:37] and his is not confined by walls
[1:55:40] his is covered with righteousness
[1:55:42] this is covered with his
[1:55:45] amen are you with me
[1:55:47] he said that's when the church shall be
[1:55:49] completely delivered paragraph 86
[1:55:52] when everything
[1:55:54] somebody say everything
[1:55:55] when everything come on comes under the
[1:55:57] blood when your sins come under the
[1:55:59] blood when you're smoking you're
[1:56:00] gambling you're cheating you're stealing
[1:56:02] when you're lying when everything is
[1:56:03] brought under the blood
[1:56:05] then there'll be total deliverance
[1:56:07] now we got to that place and that's when
[1:56:10] we started talking about
[1:56:12] my heart as a house
[1:56:14] and we started talking about those
[1:56:16] places where we don't really want the
[1:56:17] lord to get on tuesday night
[1:56:19] and and you know everyone's got
[1:56:20] something
[1:56:22] they've got a closet somewhere in their
[1:56:23] life some secret some something that
[1:56:25] they've never really surrendered to the
[1:56:27] lord
[1:56:28] and whether we realize it or not it
[1:56:30] affects our personality it reflects our
[1:56:32] relationships
[1:56:33] because we've allowed something to stay
[1:56:35] out from under the blood
[1:56:37] we've got to get it in his hands
[1:56:39] we've got to let the lord deal with
[1:56:41] those places in our life where we don't
[1:56:42] want to revisit
[1:56:44] i know that you're caring a lot of us
[1:56:46] are carrying pain and we're carrying
[1:56:48] heartache and we're carrying rejections
[1:56:50] and things from our past and from our
[1:56:51] life and we gave everything to christ
[1:56:54] when we trusted him for salvation except
[1:56:56] a few things we held back for ourselves
[1:56:59] and in this hour he wants us to be
[1:57:01] willing to lay it all down just give it
[1:57:02] all
[1:57:03] just give it all to him
[1:57:05] just let the blood cover it all
[1:57:08] just let the blood cover it all
[1:57:10] there are things that we need to make
[1:57:12] right
[1:57:13] and there are things that could never be
[1:57:15] made right
[1:57:17] we have to discover and discern the
[1:57:19] difference
[1:57:23] if you're allowing something in your
[1:57:25] past that has never been set right to
[1:57:27] condemn you you're going to have to
[1:57:29] discover through discernment what to do
[1:57:31] about that
[1:57:33] and it may be that you find out that
[1:57:34] there are just certain things there are
[1:57:36] certain eggs that can't be unscrambled
[1:57:38] in certain situations that can't really
[1:57:40] be changed so you throw yourself on the
[1:57:42] mercies of god
[1:57:44] and ask him to give you instruction and
[1:57:46] help if there's something that you need
[1:57:48] but whatever you do don't hold that back
[1:57:51] give it to him and let him cover it with
[1:57:54] the blood
[1:57:55] you know there are people that live
[1:57:57] under the condemnation of divorce
[1:58:00] god hates divorce
[1:58:02] it was never his idea in the first place
[1:58:06] but let me tell you something else god
[1:58:07] hates he hates to see people abused
[1:58:17] i know a little bit about abuse
[1:58:21] my second
[1:58:23] my mom's second husband my
[1:58:25] i mean i i never really thought of him
[1:58:27] as a stepdad because we didn't talk like
[1:58:29] that
[1:58:31] but
[1:58:32] really he had been more of a dad to me
[1:58:34] than my own dad
[1:58:36] but he beat my mom
[1:58:38] you know the story some of you do
[1:58:40] some of you don't
[1:58:42] i don't mean he slapped her around
[1:58:45] i mean he busted her head and put her in
[1:58:47] the hospital more than one time
[1:58:49] he moved us away from my family from my
[1:58:52] grandmother that preached from a
[1:58:54] pentecostal church that i got to go to
[1:58:56] on rare occasion and he moved us down to
[1:58:59] uh to brunswick georgia to uh uh over uh
[1:59:04] uh saint simon's island and sea island
[1:59:06] down on the coast of georgia some of
[1:59:08] you've been there
[1:59:09] and he moved us down there because he
[1:59:11] wanted my mom to be away from friends
[1:59:14] and family so that so that no one would
[1:59:17] discover his abuse
[1:59:20] he just just wicked if i but if i
[1:59:22] started telling you his story
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:26] if i started telling you where he come
[1:59:28] from
[1:59:29] you know i i you you would have to
[1:59:31] understand it's it's inexcusable
[1:59:35] god forbid that we would excuse abuse
[1:59:39] it's inexcusable
[1:59:41] but sometimes you get at least a little
[1:59:43] understanding when you find out
[1:59:46] what someone has been through
[1:59:50] unless god interrupts
[1:59:53] we let god interrupt the cycle
[1:59:56] abusers abuse
[1:59:58] and the abused will continue to abuse
[2:00:02] unless god interrupts the cycle
[2:00:07] when i go to the dentist
[2:00:10] in columbus
[2:00:11] river town dental
[2:00:14] i drive by
[2:00:16] hilton avenue
[2:00:19] and i look across there and see the
[2:00:21] apartments
[2:00:23] and i remember the night that my mother
[2:00:27] was being beaten
[2:00:29] until he passed out he wasn't always
[2:00:32] drunk
[2:00:32] when he abused
[2:00:34] but this particular night he'd been
[2:00:36] drinking he just kind of collapsed
[2:00:39] and she grabbed me i remember it well
[2:00:41] she came into my room and grabbed me out
[2:00:42] of bed and didn't even let me put on my
[2:00:45] clothes i went in my pajamas
[2:00:49] she drugged me down two flights of steps
[2:00:51] i couldn't hardly keep up with her
[2:00:53] because she was running for her life
[2:00:56] and we'd no more got in the parking lot
[2:00:58] but we looked back and we could see up a
[2:01:00] window in the top staircase of the
[2:01:03] hallway of the apartment and we saw him
[2:01:05] standing there and we knew he was coming
[2:01:06] after us and i remember running up
[2:01:09] hilton avenue with my mom
[2:01:12] and i remember how winded she was
[2:01:15] and if i tried for a moment i could hear
[2:01:17] her breathing right now
[2:01:20] you ever been in a situation like that
[2:01:22] you know how it gets written in your
[2:01:24] mind
[2:01:25] i remember begging my mama to be quiet
[2:01:28] i remember saying mama you got you've
[2:01:30] got to stop breathing so loud
[2:01:33] but she was so winded from fear and from
[2:01:35] running
[2:01:36] that we we hid in a bush she shoved me
[2:01:39] into a bush
[2:01:40] and she got down in that bush and and i
[2:01:43] knew that he would hear us
[2:01:46] and he heard us
[2:01:47] he found us there
[2:01:49] and he forced us back into the house
[2:01:52] but by the time we got back in the house
[2:01:54] he was calm enough
[2:01:56] and he had already gone into the second
[2:01:58] mode
[2:02:00] i'm so sorry
[2:02:03] i love you so much
[2:02:05] i'll never do this again
[2:02:08] and my poor mama was so starved for love
[2:02:12] that she believed his lie
[2:02:15] it was after that that that he moved us
[2:02:18] to brunswick and here we go with him
[2:02:21] she steps away from her job and
[2:02:24] everything that she had known and her
[2:02:26] mother
[2:02:28] it was a big rig of moroe because my dad
[2:02:31] was still alive and there was still
[2:02:32] divorce orders and visitation rights and
[2:02:35] all those kinds of things and we get
[2:02:37] down there and we don't even come back
[2:02:41] i only remember coming one time back for
[2:02:43] a visit on an airplane by myself and was
[2:02:46] very small i was less than seven
[2:02:50] and i remember coming back but my dad
[2:02:52] had retired from delta so
[2:02:54] they gave me very special treatment i
[2:02:56] was not afraid to be by myself or to
[2:02:58] travel by myself because there was not
[2:03:01] only a stewardess watching for me but
[2:03:02] one who sat with me the entire time it's
[2:03:04] the only time i remember coming home and
[2:03:06] i remember getting off the plane and my
[2:03:08] holiness granny
[2:03:11] was standing there waiting on me
[2:03:13] and she looked like god to me
[2:03:17] i'd been living in what i thought was
[2:03:19] hell and i know i didn't have it as bad
[2:03:21] as some because i was not abused
[2:03:25] it was only my mom who was being abused
[2:03:28] i go back and there are times that she
[2:03:30] ended up twice there in the hospital and
[2:03:33] i'm staying with neighbors that i don't
[2:03:35] even really know
[2:03:37] because he made no arrangements for me
[2:03:39] to have a place to stay
[2:03:41] and i prayed and begged god night after
[2:03:43] night after night to give her strength
[2:03:46] to be able to leave him
[2:03:49] so that we didn't have to live like that
[2:03:50] so i know that god's idea is not
[2:03:52] divorced i know divorce is not god's
[2:03:54] idea but i'm also telling you here today
[2:03:57] that being abused like that is not god's
[2:03:59] idea either
[2:04:02] i remember well the last time he beat
[2:04:05] her so bad
[2:04:06] so bad
[2:04:09] and um
[2:04:10] she was unable to go to work she
[2:04:12] couldn't go to work in that condition
[2:04:14] and he got up the next morning and went
[2:04:15] to work he smashed the television
[2:04:18] he had already killed a dog that
[2:04:20] belonged to me
[2:04:21] he was wild
[2:04:23] he'd already gone to work
[2:04:25] and we got up that morning and i
[2:04:27] remember that i had just had a birthday
[2:04:29] and i remember that mama wouldn't even
[2:04:31] let me take time to pack my birthday
[2:04:33] stuff
[2:04:34] that had been given to me
[2:04:36] she wanted to get out as fast as
[2:04:38] possible and i don't blame her
[2:04:40] and i remember walking away and being
[2:04:42] torn
[2:04:43] i want freedom but i sure would like to
[2:04:45] bring my birthday presents with me
[2:04:47] remember it wasn't even seven years old
[2:04:50] oh i sure would like to bring that stuff
[2:04:52] with me but but it was impossible to do
[2:04:54] that
[2:04:55] and my mama cried
[2:04:57] everything she throwed in the car part
[2:04:59] of our clothes whatever she could get in
[2:05:01] the car she cried every every step of
[2:05:03] the way she cried
[2:05:05] we got just outside her right at the
[2:05:07] edge of town we stopped at a mcdonald's
[2:05:10] for breakfast
[2:05:14] i remember what we ate of course it
[2:05:15] wouldn't be hard at mcdonald's there's
[2:05:17] not but a few choices to make breakfast
[2:05:21] my mama was quiet
[2:05:24] i said mama won't it be wonderful
[2:05:27] to be out from under that
[2:05:29] won't this be wonderful and i'll get to
[2:05:31] go to church
[2:05:33] you see i had got up sunday morning
[2:05:35] after sunday morning after sunday
[2:05:36] morning and stood at our second story
[2:05:38] window and watched the children getting
[2:05:40] on the assembly of god school bus to go
[2:05:43] to sunday school and i cried to go and
[2:05:45] beg to go but he hated the church hated
[2:05:48] the assembly of god especially hated the
[2:05:50] church
[2:05:51] and he wouldn't let me go and mama
[2:05:53] didn't want to rock the boat so she
[2:05:54] wouldn't let me go and i said oh it's
[2:05:57] going to be wonderful
[2:05:58] i'll get to go to
[2:06:00] church mama aren't you glad that we can
[2:06:03] be free and we don't have to live like
[2:06:05] that and you don't have to be beat up
[2:06:07] anymore you don't have to have a black
[2:06:09] eye
[2:06:11] you don't have to have stitches anymore
[2:06:14] and she was so silent
[2:06:17] and she said to me finally as we were
[2:06:19] finishing up our meal she said steve i'm
[2:06:21] going back to him
[2:06:26] it shocked me how could that be possible
[2:06:30] how how could she possibly take me
[2:06:33] how could she possibly take herself back
[2:06:35] into that she was bound
[2:06:39] it was an uh an awful soul tie
[2:06:44] and it was not love
[2:06:47] the world doesn't know what to call it
[2:06:50] but it was a soul tie
[2:06:52] it was the enemy trying to destroy her
[2:06:54] life
[2:06:55] and to keep me out of my destiny
[2:06:58] that's exactly what it was she said i'm
[2:07:00] going back i love him
[2:07:03] and i'm going back
[2:07:05] and she said we'll talk about
[2:07:07] maybe making a way for you to go and
[2:07:09] live in columbus if that's what you want
[2:07:11] to do but she said i'm going back and i
[2:07:13] said mama if we go back to him i don't
[2:07:16] want to live
[2:07:18] i mean i was pulling out all of sympathy
[2:07:20] stuff you know
[2:07:21] i said i'm going to ask the lord i'm
[2:07:23] going to pray she knew that i prayed i'm
[2:07:26] going to pray that he will that i'll die
[2:07:28] i don't want to live
[2:07:30] because i don't want to live if i can't
[2:07:31] go to church and serve the lord
[2:07:34] and i don't want to live if i have to
[2:07:36] live my whole life watching you be beat
[2:07:38] this way this is not what i want and she
[2:07:40] was silent
[2:07:42] and she put me we got in the car
[2:07:44] and we started and she never said a word
[2:07:46] and all this time i my chest is beating
[2:07:49] my heart is beating in my chest and i
[2:07:50] think that i'm fixing to see the
[2:07:52] apartments
[2:07:54] i think that we're heading back i'm not
[2:07:55] even paying attention and i'm just
[2:07:57] crying just really just sobbing
[2:08:01] thinking about going back to that
[2:08:04] and all of a sudden i look up
[2:08:06] get my tears wiped off or whatever
[2:08:09] and i look up and i see a sign
[2:08:12] that said so many miles to columbus
[2:08:14] georgia
[2:08:16] she never even told me that she changed
[2:08:18] her mind
[2:08:21] she just changed her mind
[2:08:23] and she was free from that forever
[2:08:26] now i want you to know something it
[2:08:28] wasn't the best situation
[2:08:31] but god wanted us out of that
[2:08:36] look at the bird
[2:08:42] god wanted us out of that
[2:08:48] i can't help but wonder if i'm supposed
[2:08:50] to tell
[2:08:51] the story about the dove do you all
[2:08:53] remember the story
[2:08:55] some of you remember the story about the
[2:08:56] dove
[2:08:58] there was a dove that came and laid
[2:09:00] little branches on my windowsill when we
[2:09:02] were living down there in brunswick
[2:09:05] he visited me every day
[2:09:07] and he brought little little uh sticks
[2:09:10] with no little branches just straight
[2:09:11] little sticks he brought and he lay them
[2:09:13] there one one on the first day he laid a
[2:09:16] little stick there
[2:09:17] and then he was gone and the next day i
[2:09:19] went back he brought another stick and
[2:09:21] laid it there and and before it was over
[2:09:24] you've heard me tell this some of you
[2:09:25] have before it was over he had laid
[2:09:27] seven sticks
[2:09:30] one two three four five six seven and he
[2:09:32] never came back again
[2:09:34] and the lord said write it down
[2:09:36] you're going to remember that one day
[2:09:39] years later i began to hear a message
[2:09:41] and all seemed like everything for weeks
[2:09:44] i would listen to tapes every day and it
[2:09:46] seemed like everything i could hear was
[2:09:47] brother braham saying 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
[2:09:51] i said i don't know that's what it is
[2:09:54] but god was somehow getting me ready for
[2:09:56] something
[2:09:57] maybe maybe there's somebody listening
[2:09:59] to this on a stream or something and
[2:10:01] you're living under condemnation of a
[2:10:03] divorce
[2:10:05] and and the enemy is telling you that
[2:10:07] you're not good enough or or that god
[2:10:10] can't bless you or help you because
[2:10:13] there's a mark like that on your life
[2:10:15] well i want you to know that's not the
[2:10:17] god i serve
[2:10:20] there is a divorce is not an
[2:10:22] unpardonable sin
[2:10:24] we don't believe in it and we're pretty
[2:10:26] strict on our teaching scripturally for
[2:10:29] remarriage
[2:10:30] but i want you to know my mama had a
[2:10:32] better life by herself
[2:10:37] than she had in that abuse
[2:10:39] and it wasn't
[2:10:40] easy it wasn't easy
[2:10:43] but we made it because of the grace of
[2:10:45] god
[2:10:46] i don't know why i'm on that
[2:10:49] but god knows why
[2:10:51] don't you let anything hang over you
[2:10:55] to keep you
[2:10:57] from your destiny
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:10:59] god has a plan
[2:11:02] oh i felt something then
[2:11:05] hallelujah thank you jesus
[2:11:07] he's got a plan for your life
[2:11:11] when the church shall be completely
[2:11:12] delivered that's when the church shall
[2:11:14] be completely delivered when everything
[2:11:16] comes under the blood when you're all of
[2:11:18] that all of that when everything is
[2:11:20] brought under the blood
[2:11:22] brought in submission or submissive to
[2:11:25] the kingdom of god then there'll be
[2:11:27] great
[2:11:29] real
[2:11:31] real
[2:11:32] deliverance
[2:11:33] anybody still with me
[2:11:35] i know it's late i want to read another
[2:11:37] quote i love this one
[2:11:39] from total deliverance it's actually the
[2:11:40] next paragraph
[2:11:41] i've preached this many times jesus
[2:11:44] paragraph 87 jesus was completely
[2:11:46] totally man
[2:11:48] anybody listening i know you're weary i
[2:11:50] i i can understand
[2:11:52] he could cry like a man he could eat
[2:11:54] like a man he could be tired like a man
[2:11:56] he was completely totally man in his
[2:11:58] physical being and in his spirit
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:03] he was completely totally god
[2:12:05] so he made his flesh submissive to the
[2:12:07] spirit that was in him
[2:12:10] why would he do such a thing as your
[2:12:12] example
[2:12:13] as my example
[2:12:15] so he made his flesh submissive to the
[2:12:16] spirit that was in him you see he was
[2:12:18] tempted in all manners
[2:12:20] like we are
[2:12:22] he was a man not an angel
[2:12:24] he was a man he had desires and
[2:12:26] temptations just like we do how many of
[2:12:28] you know that's just what the bible said
[2:12:30] the bible said he did he was a man not
[2:12:32] an angel above temptation hebrews 1 said
[2:12:35] that he was hebrews 1 4 he was made
[2:12:37] lower
[2:12:38] than the angels
[2:12:40] he was a man he was man completely man
[2:12:44] that god took a complete man to bring
[2:12:46] total deliverance and he filled him with
[2:12:48] his spirit
[2:12:51] the holy ghost was in him
[2:12:54] without measure
[2:12:55] he was tempted like we are like we were
[2:12:59] and he was completely god he proved it
[2:13:02] when he raised from the dead
[2:13:04] or when he raised the dead
[2:13:06] when he stopped nature the roaring seas
[2:13:09] and the mighty winds
[2:13:11] are you still here
[2:13:13] when he spoke to the trees and so forth
[2:13:15] they obeyed him he was god inside and he
[2:13:19] could have been man for he was man
[2:13:22] but he totally and completely delivered
[2:13:24] himself as a man
[2:13:26] he completely and totally he totally and
[2:13:29] completely delivered himself as a man
[2:13:32] into the hands of god
[2:13:36] that's right brother steve
[2:13:37] for the service of god
[2:13:41] amen
[2:13:42] i know somebody's thinking well that was
[2:13:43] jesus you know you don't understand
[2:13:46] he became what you are
[2:13:49] so that you can become what he was
[2:13:53] the fallen the the the son of god became
[2:13:56] a son of man
[2:13:59] that we the fallen sons of men might
[2:14:01] become the sons of god for as many as
[2:14:03] are led by the spirit of god they are
[2:14:06] the sons of god he totally and
[2:14:08] completely thanks david he totally and
[2:14:09] completely delivered himself as a man
[2:14:12] into the hands of god for the service of
[2:14:14] god now i don't know if that's sparking
[2:14:16] anything in you but it sparks me because
[2:14:18] that's part of my destiny
[2:14:20] remember when you hear a word and it
[2:14:21] quickens inside of you that's god
[2:14:23] letting you know that's a part of your
[2:14:25] calling that's a part of your destiny
[2:14:28] sister anna miller
[2:14:31] that little note you sent
[2:14:33] about something you were going through
[2:14:34] and listening to
[2:14:36] there's a sermon you were listening to
[2:14:38] and you felt identified you're you're
[2:14:40] trying to get your self around it your
[2:14:42] head around it i hope i'm not saying
[2:14:44] something wrong
[2:14:45] and and all of a sudden there could come
[2:14:48] to a certain part in that
[2:14:49] and there was a word that went out on
[2:14:51] that tape
[2:14:53] and
[2:14:54] something inter-identified with that
[2:14:56] he said we're a part of that
[2:15:01] we don't live by feelings
[2:15:03] but god gives us those things
[2:15:06] i feel quicken when i read this
[2:15:08] he said delivered himself totally
[2:15:11] completely as a man into the hands of
[2:15:13] god for the service of god
[2:15:16] wouldn't that be wonderful if every man
[2:15:18] and every woman here this morning and
[2:15:20] under the sound of my voice
[2:15:22] would make such a commitment i want it
[2:15:24] all under the blood i want it all under
[2:15:27] the blood
[2:15:29] i want to submit totally all that i am
[2:15:31] as a man all that you may be as a woman
[2:15:34] we want to give all of that to god
[2:15:37] paragraph 88 i'm okay i didn't fall
[2:15:40] [Music]
[2:15:45] he is our example
[2:15:48] we are men and women we're also
[2:15:50] christians
[2:15:51] if he's our example let us completely
[2:15:53] deliver ourselves
[2:16:00] into the hands of the holy ghost
[2:16:02] that we might be subjects
[2:16:04] of the kingdom of god
[2:16:06] [Music]
[2:16:09] he was totally man
[2:16:11] he was totally god
[2:16:13] but he surrendered his natural parts his
[2:16:15] physical parts his own thinking his own
[2:16:18] doing his own cares
[2:16:21] and i do only that which pleases the
[2:16:23] father
[2:16:24] you think that he was the only one that
[2:16:26] can have that kind of covenant i'm
[2:16:28] telling you
[2:16:29] he had it so that you could have it he
[2:16:32] committed himself that way so that you
[2:16:33] and i would find strength to commit
[2:16:35] ourselves that way
[2:16:37] amen
[2:16:39] there you are totally delivered from
[2:16:41] human beings
[2:16:42] the priests come to him the great men
[2:16:44] and said rabbi so-and-so and tried to
[2:16:45] bribe him into their affiliations and
[2:16:47] denominations but he was totally
[2:16:49] delivered because he trusted in god
[2:16:51] anybody with me in a message how can i
[2:16:54] overcome can you take a little bit more
[2:16:56] [Music]
[2:16:57] you see some folks said they drove was
[2:16:59] it seven hours or eight hours
[2:17:01] eight hours to be in one service
[2:17:05] shouldn't i give them a little bit more
[2:17:07] for making a sacrifice like that
[2:17:11] paragraph 104 how can i overcome look
[2:17:14] temptation was for him
[2:17:16] you know that the bible said he was
[2:17:18] tempted in all points like we are yet
[2:17:20] without sin tempted by drinking oh i
[2:17:22] love this quote
[2:17:25] this makes the religious choke
[2:17:34] hey they can't imagine jesus passing the
[2:17:37] bar
[2:17:39] and feeling a temptation
[2:17:45] he was tempted by oh let's don't leave
[2:17:47] this out
[2:17:48] he was tempted by drinking he was
[2:17:50] tempted by women i listened one time to
[2:17:52] a preacher trying to explain that jesus
[2:17:54] was a sexual asexual
[2:17:58] meaning neither male nor female
[2:18:01] so he had no he had no a pull
[2:18:04] toward
[2:18:06] sexual things
[2:18:14] freakish
[2:18:16] it's freakish
[2:18:18] he was tempted by drinking tempted by
[2:18:20] women tempted by everything that could
[2:18:23] be tempted by he was tempted by
[2:18:25] everything that we are he was a man and
[2:18:28] yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes
[2:18:31] sir
[2:18:33] overcome here is something so important
[2:18:36] to remember
[2:18:37] overcome means
[2:18:43] maybe you think overcome means to never
[2:18:45] be tempted
[2:18:47] then jesus was not an overcomer
[2:18:50] the real definition the prophet gave us
[2:18:53] of being overcome uh uh is to overcome
[2:18:56] means to recognize the devil
[2:18:59] in every one of his tricks
[2:19:01] now we're not all overcoming
[2:19:04] because sometimes he slips in
[2:19:07] we don't recognize him
[2:19:09] we start dealing with things around here
[2:19:11] and there's always some people that say
[2:19:12] oh
[2:19:18] really i didn't even know anything like
[2:19:21] that was going on
[2:19:23] well one of two things is true you're
[2:19:25] not here enough
[2:19:28] so you're not really connected to the
[2:19:30] body and you don't know what's going on
[2:19:32] or you're not recognizing the enemy
[2:19:35] in all of his tricks
[2:19:37] don't be discouraged
[2:19:38] don't be condemned by it just keep your
[2:19:41] eyes open
[2:19:43] lots of people say there is no devil
[2:19:45] it's just a thought don't you believe
[2:19:46] that there's a real devil he's just as
[2:19:49] real as you are anybody a real devil and
[2:19:51] you must recognize him real you must
[2:19:53] know he's the devil
[2:19:55] then the same time you you recognize him
[2:19:57] and know that he's the devil he's
[2:19:58] against you then to overcome
[2:20:01] you must recognize oh
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:07] we must seem like silly people around
[2:20:09] here
[2:20:11] to get excited about something like this
[2:20:16] you recognize him and know that he's the
[2:20:18] devil and he's against you then to
[2:20:20] overcome
[2:20:21] you must recognize that the god in you
[2:20:26] is greater
[2:20:28] and mightier than he is
[2:20:30] [Music]

[2:20:50] that the one that's in you has already
[2:20:53] [Music]
[2:20:56] already overcome him
[2:21:01] you see this is the best step i know
[2:21:03] toward total deliverance
[2:21:05] is to understand that he has already
[2:21:07] delivered us
[2:21:09] we just have to win this yes
[2:21:16] hey
[2:21:17] somebody said but what about the alcohol
[2:21:23] you'll win it here
[2:21:25] what the world are you trying to say
[2:21:27] that's where the greatest battle ever
[2:21:28] fault is
[2:21:31] you quit telling yourself you deserve
[2:21:33] something
[2:21:34] you've been through so much
[2:21:36] you need a release
[2:21:38] you need to relax you need something
[2:21:40] like that

[2:21:42] you find yourself in bondage
[2:21:44] because you made an excuse
[2:21:46] that battle is one right there
[2:21:49] pornography the battle of overcoming
[2:21:51] pornography this one right there
[2:21:55] right there

[2:22:21] you need to man up
[2:22:23] [Music]

[2:22:28] one right there it's one right there and
[2:22:30] any any lady any woman
[2:22:33] under that same thing it's wrong for us
[2:22:35] to think that only men fight the
[2:22:37] pornography battle it's wrong for us to
[2:22:40] think such a thing as that
[2:22:41] it's wrong for us to think that only men
[2:22:44] abuse their wives
[2:22:46] i want you to know there are men who
[2:22:47] have been terribly abused by wives
[2:22:50] some say i couldn't believe physically
[2:22:52] oh yes
[2:22:54] and it wasn't because the man couldn't
[2:22:56] overcome the woman it's because he chose
[2:22:57] not to it's because he stood there and
[2:22:59] let her beat him i want you to know i
[2:23:01] love my
[2:23:02] wife but she ain't gonna let me whoop
[2:23:05] her
[2:23:07] and i ain't gonna let her whoop me

[2:23:22] to say
[2:23:23] you'll never get too big for me to whoop
[2:23:24] you she was my mama
[2:23:26] she said i'll wait you go to bed at
[2:23:28] night and tie you to the bed and whoop
[2:23:29] you
[2:23:33] she didn't
[2:23:35] but i knew she would
[2:23:38] i remember the one time i picked up the
[2:23:40] phone and told her i was calling 911
[2:23:46] she said you better hope they're on the
[2:23:48] front porch out there
[2:23:50] [Music]
[2:23:53] because by the time they get here
[2:23:56] i'm gonna give you something worth
[2:23:57] calling them for
[2:24:00] that's not funny
[2:24:10] the god in you is greater and mightier
[2:24:13] than that enemy is that the one that's
[2:24:15] in you has already overcome him
[2:24:18] and i want you to read that i ain't
[2:24:20] going to read it and
[2:24:25] [Music]
[2:24:31] not because you're a good bush
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:35] not because you're different than any
[2:24:37] other bush
[2:24:39] it's the one that lives inside of you
[2:24:41] that makes you holy
[2:24:43] it's the one inside of you that makes
[2:24:45] you an overcomer
[2:24:48] you got to just make up your mind to
[2:24:49] drop your hoe
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:56] he'll drive a man back to the computer
[2:24:58] before this day is over unless he makes
[2:25:01] up his mind
[2:25:06] and for you for those young men around
[2:25:07] the world that think marriage fixes that
[2:25:10] addiction
[2:25:13] it certainly does not
[2:25:17] it destroys marriages it destroys lives
[2:25:21] because no godly woman can keep up with
[2:25:23] that kind of stuff come on
[2:25:26] hideous
[2:25:29] you're more than a match for him by the
[2:25:30] grace of god there's real overcoming
[2:25:33] when you recognize there's real
[2:25:35] overcoming when you recognize
[2:25:38] total deliverance when you get under the
[2:25:39] blood
[2:25:41] there's real overcoming when you
[2:25:42] recognize
[2:25:46] a total deliverance paragraph 53 we
[2:25:48] might stop i can't believe it
[2:25:51] but we mine
[2:25:55] and the member of the church he's called
[2:25:56] to be a member of this certain group
[2:25:58] then he would not compromise if the
[2:26:00] church believes that we should not
[2:26:01] gamble
[2:26:03] then the members should never touch a
[2:26:04] deck of cards
[2:26:06] we don't believe in drinking he should
[2:26:08] turn his head completely from drinking
[2:26:11] because you never know who you're going
[2:26:12] to run into
[2:26:25] if we do not believe in gambling or
[2:26:27] smoking the member this church should
[2:26:28] never touch such a thing
[2:26:32] god gives complete deliverance
[2:26:36] he'll do it if we'll completely
[2:26:37] surrender ourselves to him
[2:26:40] quit making excuses for herself
[2:26:48] and god can live in us if we will
[2:26:49] completely deliver wait a minute
[2:26:51] he will do it if we'll completely
[2:26:53] surrender ourselves to him if if we will
[2:26:56] completely deliver ourselves into his
[2:26:59] hand
[2:27:00] then god can live in us christ the hope
[2:27:03] of glory he can reflect himself from us
[2:27:06] as we get ourselves out of the way
[2:27:10] then reid our thoughts
[2:27:12] are
[2:27:14] brother branham knew where the battle
[2:27:15] was won
[2:27:17] he knew where it was one could you
[2:27:18] imagine christ smoking a cigar
[2:27:23] brother daniel i i've been i've been an
[2:27:26] invited announced speaker in conferences
[2:27:30] in the last years
[2:27:32] and offered a cigar
[2:27:35] in the green room
[2:27:36] before i went to speak to a pentecostal
[2:27:39] charismatic conference
[2:27:41] i said something's bad wrong up in this
[2:27:43] place
[2:27:50] they sometimes had wine on the table
[2:27:53] and whispered quietly if you needed
[2:27:54] something harder they could get that too
[2:27:58] the church is in a mess
[2:28:00] the church world's in a mess i'm telling
[2:28:02] you right now she's in a mess
[2:28:05] if your spirit is part of can you
[2:28:07] imagine christ smoking a cigar could you
[2:28:09] imagine christ drinking or playing cards
[2:28:12] playing a little poker with his friends
[2:28:14] on sunday night
[2:28:15] he said then if your spirit is part of
[2:28:17] his spirit
[2:28:19] i want you to notice the reference to
[2:28:20] spirit here
[2:28:21] if your spirit is part of his spirit he
[2:28:24] wants it to be upon your
[2:28:26] confession
[2:28:28] but you permit the devil to come in and
[2:28:29] take over
[2:28:31] but you permit the devil to come in and
[2:28:33] take over
[2:28:34] and all the time in your heart way down
[2:28:36] deep you know you're wrong
[2:28:39] when you do those things
[2:28:41] well that's holiness preaching i believe
[2:28:43] it
[2:28:43] and when one member would talk against
[2:28:45] the other member
[2:28:51] yeah he puts it in the same category
[2:28:55] with smoking drinking and poker
[2:28:57] talking about your brother and sister
[2:29:00] running them down with no intention of
[2:29:03] helping them up
[2:29:05] you're commanded to pray for one another
[2:29:07] not to talk against one another but to
[2:29:10] love one another
[2:29:11] and if someone is down
[2:29:18] let's pick him up
[2:29:20] help him
[2:29:21] help him
[2:29:23] that's good
[2:29:25] that's the word
[2:29:29] let's read on
[2:29:30] now that makes us a unified group of
[2:29:32] believers oh god that's what we want
[2:29:34] here
[2:29:36] now when we don't obey that and we don't
[2:29:37] obey god and we displease god and
[2:29:40] therefore our church our people cannot
[2:29:42] prosper
[2:29:44] the church cannot go on
[2:29:46] it's because we're disunified together
[2:29:50] disunified together
[2:29:53] as jesus said a little leaven
[2:29:58] leaven's alone
[2:30:00] being unified
[2:30:03] knowing that we all struggle
[2:30:07] but we're all desiring to please him
[2:30:10] and moving in the right direction
[2:30:14] setting the best example that we know to
[2:30:16] set
[2:30:17] because the world is watching us
[2:30:20] anybody with me
[2:30:21] let me read one more verse and we're
[2:30:23] done
[2:30:26] ii corinthians chapter 1
[2:30:29] verse 9 and 10 but we have the sentence
[2:30:31] of death in ourselves
[2:30:34] that we should not trust in ourselves
[2:30:38] but in god
[2:30:40] which raiseth the dead
[2:30:43] who delivered us
[2:30:47] from so great a death
[2:30:49] [Music]
[2:30:50] and doth deliver
[2:30:53] in whom we trust
[2:30:55] that he will yet
[2:30:58] deliver
[2:30:59] us
[2:31:00] in the amplified it says
[2:31:03] for it is he
[2:31:05] who rescued and saved us
[2:31:08] from a perilous
[2:31:11] death
[2:31:13] verse 10
[2:31:17] and he will still rescue
[2:31:20] and save us he did
[2:31:23] he did
[2:31:25] and he will
[2:31:27] he did save us
[2:31:29] and he will save us
[2:31:31] he did deliver us
[2:31:33] and he will deliver us he will still
[2:31:35] rescue and save us in and on him we have
[2:31:37] set our hope our joyful and confident
[2:31:40] expectation that he will again deliver
[2:31:42] us
[2:31:43] from danger and destruction and do what
[2:31:47] draw us to himself the greek word is
[2:31:48] sozo
[2:31:51] and it doesn't mean partial salvation
[2:31:56] sozo means complete
[2:31:58] total
[2:31:59] salvation
[2:32:01] like what we were reading about when we
[2:32:03] started here
[2:32:05] body
[2:32:07] soul
[2:32:08] and spirit
[2:32:10] it's a complete salvation it's a
[2:32:12] complete deliverance
[2:32:14] now here's what a lot of people don't
[2:32:16] quite understand and we'll pick this up
[2:32:18] tuesday night
[2:32:19] and that is
[2:32:21] deliverance and salvation is a
[2:32:23] progressive work
[2:32:25] but it is a total work
[2:32:27] it is a complete work
[2:32:29] and what we mean by that it's found
[2:32:32] in scripture and we'll go over those
[2:32:33] scriptures tuesday night our spirit has
[2:32:35] been
[2:32:37] i know there's
[2:32:39] other thoughts so if you're one of those
[2:32:41] our soul you can say our soul
[2:32:44] our spirit has been saved
[2:32:46] our soul is being saved
[2:32:50] that's our mind our will and our
[2:32:52] emotions
[2:32:53] we're still working on those
[2:32:55] he's still working on those come on
[2:32:58] that's not an excuse to continue to sin
[2:33:01] but it's a grace that says i will help
[2:33:03] you with your emotion
[2:33:06] i will help you with your stuff
[2:33:08] i'll bring you out from under the
[2:33:10] condemnation of your bad decisions in
[2:33:12] the past and let you be clean and clear
[2:33:15] before me not a sinner saved by grace
[2:33:18] but one who was
[2:33:20] a sinner old identity
[2:33:22] o creation
[2:33:24] now saved by grace new identity a new
[2:33:28] creation in christ all together isn't
[2:33:30] that what the scripture teaches
[2:33:32] so our spirit has been saved our soul is
[2:33:34] being saved as our mind is being renewed
[2:33:38] now that's a process
[2:33:41] it's a continual cycle
[2:33:43] and our body we have the promise that
[2:33:45] our body
[2:33:46] shall be saved
[2:33:48] our spirit is delivered
[2:33:51] our soul is being delivered
[2:33:53] mind will and emotions
[2:33:55] our body will one day be delivered
[2:33:58] from corruption
[2:33:59] into incur into incorruption
[2:34:02] do you believe that
[2:34:06] i want the musicians to come
[2:34:12] god bless you as you come
[2:34:43] i want you to play something softly
[2:35:08] i'm waiting on you to start playing
[2:35:10] something softly
[2:35:18] i want to share something with you as we
[2:35:20] close
[2:35:22] i thought maybe i wouldn't but this
[2:35:23] morning but save it but i think i will
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:42] i want to read you a portion of
[2:35:45] a vision
[2:35:53] it's called the great divide
[2:35:56] and it is
[2:35:57] transvision number seven
[2:36:01] took place in january of 1998 you say
[2:36:04] well couldn't possibly have any
[2:36:06] relevance it does
[2:36:08] [Music]
[2:36:09] in january of 1998 we were worshiping
[2:36:12] the lord the seventh transvision came
[2:36:16] our church and ministry had gone through
[2:36:17] a very difficult time the previous year
[2:36:21] and we were pressing in to take hold of
[2:36:23] the promise that god had made
[2:36:26] in a vision in another vision that came
[2:36:28] at the end of 1996
[2:36:31] we had been forewarned concerning the
[2:36:33] waters of separation that would flow
[2:36:34] among us
[2:36:36] we were still reeling from their effects
[2:36:38] and grieving the loss of relationships
[2:36:40] that had ended painfully
[2:36:43] in spite of the sadness i was filled
[2:36:45] with a sense of hope and destiny for
[2:36:47] many reasons
[2:36:49] one of which was the fact that god had
[2:36:51] brought a beautiful bride into my life
[2:36:54] and together we would face the unfolding
[2:36:56] plan for our future
[2:36:58] it was also a time of fresh visitation
[2:37:00] in our services
[2:37:02] there was a sense of importance in our
[2:37:04] being gathered together that night
[2:37:09] how many of you remember being there
[2:37:10] that night let me see the hands of those
[2:37:12] of you that were there
[2:37:15] there was a sense of importance about
[2:37:16] being gathered together that night
[2:37:19] the lord had spoken to us about the
[2:37:21] necessity of creating the right
[2:37:23] atmosphere with our worship
[2:37:27] and we were pouring out our hearts to
[2:37:29] him in song
[2:37:31] and i could both feel and hear the lord
[2:37:33] beckoning me
[2:37:35] i willingly went with him into the realm
[2:37:37] of the spirit
[2:37:39] and saw before me a beautiful river
[2:37:41] covered in a rising mist
[2:37:45] and even through the mist
[2:37:48] i could see the river bottom
[2:37:50] as it was not very deep
[2:37:52] a kind angel stepped up and said
[2:37:55] only a few have ever been called to this
[2:37:57] place
[2:37:59] i asked where is this place
[2:38:02] his answer seemed a bit strange
[2:38:04] if you always know where each journey
[2:38:07] will lead
[2:38:08] fear will attack your faith
[2:38:10] it is the great divide
[2:38:13] he added soon many will stand where only
[2:38:17] a few have previously stood across the
[2:38:20] misty river is the throne room of the
[2:38:23] most high god
[2:38:26] he further explained it as the seat of
[2:38:28] god
[2:38:29] and the throne from which the bloody
[2:38:32] lamb stepped forth
[2:38:34] he also said
[2:38:36] all who stand before this throne
[2:38:39] can say that they have seen the fullness
[2:38:42] of god
[2:38:43] his word seemed grand and a bit strange
[2:38:46] to me
[2:38:47] but i was filled with a longing to stand
[2:38:50] before the throne of god that i had
[2:38:52] never known before
[2:38:54] the mist was thickening
[2:38:56] and rising higher as we stood on the
[2:38:58] bank
[2:39:00] as though protecting what was on the
[2:39:02] other shore
[2:39:03] the angel said to me do not fear
[2:39:06] storms often arise in the middle of the
[2:39:09] river in the place where the waters run
[2:39:12] cold
[2:39:13] many have been called this far to cross
[2:39:16] this river but have turned back when
[2:39:18] they face the blackness of the storms
[2:39:21] remember many are called but only a few
[2:39:24] are chosen
[2:39:25] i began pleading my case before this
[2:39:28] angel
[2:39:29] in this holy atmosphere i quickly
[2:39:31] realized that i was still carrying hurt
[2:39:36] and unhealed wounds from what we had
[2:39:38] gone through
[2:39:39] in the church
[2:39:41] i explained my weariness and loss
[2:39:44] and expressed the fear that had made it
[2:39:47] difficult for me to go forward
[2:39:50] you must run on anyway he boldly said
[2:39:54] i asked about some of my companions who
[2:39:56] had become wounded in the fight
[2:39:58] and a few that appeared to be utterly
[2:40:00] defeated
[2:40:01] he said that not one would be lost from
[2:40:05] god's hand
[2:40:06] and for anyone who laid down their sword
[2:40:09] there would be three or more raised up
[2:40:11] to take their place
[2:40:14] he also said that a clear revelation of
[2:40:16] god's glory would be imparted and a
[2:40:19] perfect understanding of his person and
[2:40:22] character as well as revelatory truths
[2:40:25] would flow from his throne the bride was
[2:40:28] being summoned to the throne room of the
[2:40:30] lamb
[2:40:31] he was now standing on the other side of
[2:40:33] the river beckoning me to follow
[2:40:36] he explained that we were being summoned
[2:40:38] to the throne room on top of the
[2:40:40] mountain of god and across the wide
[2:40:42] river
[2:40:43] i remember thinking it sounded strange a
[2:40:46] river on top of a mountain but
[2:40:48] understood that this language was not to
[2:40:50] be contemplated with an earthly
[2:40:52] perspective but with spiritual insight
[2:40:55] zion
[2:40:57] the highest spiritual place
[2:41:00] represents the throne of god
[2:41:02] the abode of the fullness of his
[2:41:04] presence
[2:41:05] before this throne we experience more of
[2:41:08] the measure of his presence than angels
[2:41:11] have previously brought to us
[2:41:13] and this full manifested glory
[2:41:16] requires a protocol of reverence
[2:41:19] and deep respect
[2:41:21] the angel said that in order for us to
[2:41:23] move to the throne there would be other
[2:41:25] spiritual dimensions through which we
[2:41:27] must make our way
[2:41:29] the initial throme room visitation will
[2:41:32] unfold to you in three parts
[2:41:35] you will not be allowed to go the entire
[2:41:37] way the first time
[2:41:39] as there is a spiritual conditioning
[2:41:41] necessary to become acclimated to
[2:41:43] walking in these higher realms of glory
[2:41:46] you must first experience the full
[2:41:48] release of your earthly body
[2:41:51] on your next visit you'll be guided
[2:41:53] across the great divide to the far shore
[2:41:56] of the river from there you'll catch
[2:41:57] your first glimpse of the throne of the
[2:41:59] lamb you'll be permitted to come close
[2:42:01] enough to the throne to worship
[2:42:04] he further explained that after the
[2:42:05] third visit i would be sent back with a
[2:42:07] word of instruction that would be
[2:42:09] significant in bringing our entire
[2:42:11] fellowship into the throne room of the
[2:42:13] lamb
[2:42:15] i was overwhelmed with the desire to go
[2:42:17] immediately to the throne i wanted to
[2:42:19] experience the fullness of his person
[2:42:21] right then and there
[2:42:22] my gentle angel god reminded me that the
[2:42:25] holiness of god is revealed most often
[2:42:27] in threes
[2:42:29] and that i must remain patient
[2:42:32] the angel reminded me that i was living
[2:42:34] in a chosen generation
[2:42:36] that had previously received a
[2:42:38] significant word through a prophet he
[2:42:40] said that the full significance of what
[2:42:42] has been delivered in this past
[2:42:44] generation would be further understood
[2:42:47] by bridal throne room company now being
[2:42:50] prepared
[2:42:52] the angel told me to tell the people to
[2:42:54] prepare their hearts to stand in the
[2:42:56] throne room of god
[2:42:57] a new and more glorious strength the
[2:42:59] strength and might of the lord would be
[2:43:01] released to them this would cause a
[2:43:04] transition from knowing god to having
[2:43:06] the character of god
[2:43:08] to being like him
[2:43:10] every answer to every question lies in
[2:43:12] this place before his throne
[2:43:15] as we learn the bride's access to the
[2:43:18] throne room in the end time
[2:43:20] we'll be able to move in and out of this
[2:43:22] realm spiritually whenever a need arises
[2:43:26] she will then go forth with the covering
[2:43:29] of a sevenfold spirit of god
[2:43:32] as i narrated aloud to those in the room
[2:43:34] with me
[2:43:35] while my spirit was in trance
[2:43:38] a prophecy began to flow
[2:43:40] out of my mouth
[2:43:44] and i wanted to share with you the
[2:43:45] prophecy
[2:43:47] for such a time as this
[2:43:50] she is being summoned
[2:43:53] and esther feared for her life
[2:43:56] to stand before the king
[2:43:58] so will my wife come before my throne
[2:44:01] with fear
[2:44:02] and trembling and reverence
[2:44:05] but she will see my favor extended to
[2:44:08] her
[2:44:09] says the lord
[2:44:11] i will visit you according to my will
[2:44:13] and you will know that i have not
[2:44:15] forsaken this city of refuge
[2:44:18] neither my house of deliverance
[2:44:21] but from this place
[2:44:22] will i send forth a word to my people
[2:44:26] that will inspire
[2:44:28] and call her forth
[2:44:30] because of this work
[2:44:32] my fivefold ministry around the world
[2:44:35] will be inspired to stand with a greater
[2:44:37] anointing and an authority to do my last
[2:44:41] work in the earth
[2:44:43] for i am god
[2:44:45] and i would say unto thee that i have
[2:44:47] not stumbled at the words of evil men
[2:44:49] but i have counted them as nothing for i
[2:44:52] am god and i cannot lie and that which i
[2:44:56] have spoken i will surely bring to pass
[2:45:00] for yea and behold the best is yet to
[2:45:02] come
[2:45:03] for i have indeed saved the finest wine
[2:45:07] that supernatural wine of god's spoken
[2:45:10] word for this hour
[2:45:12] your lips have never tasted what i have
[2:45:14] reserved for you in the last hour i will
[2:45:18] bring forth my people to hear the word
[2:45:21] that i will put in my servants heart
[2:45:24] they will come again from the north and
[2:45:26] the south and the east and the west and
[2:45:29] i will manifest my presence
[2:45:32] and i would say unto thee i will give
[2:45:34] thee that which i have put in thine
[2:45:36] heart i will give it to you and you will
[2:45:39] build the very place that i have
[2:45:40] ordained wait on me saith the lord for i
[2:45:44] have not forsaken i have not turned my
[2:45:47] back on that which i have spoken though
[2:45:50] it tarry wait for it it will surely come
[2:45:53] to pass and you will know that i am god
[2:45:57] i want to give god praise
[2:46:01] let's stand together
[2:46:02] [Applause]

[2:46:12] may receive

[2:59:27] yet a little war going on
[2:59:30] in the atmosphere
[2:59:32] and you know i know what that's about
[2:59:34] you do too
[2:59:35] the enemy he does not like to be exposed
[2:59:39] and he does not want to turn loose
[2:59:42] if he places something on you some
[2:59:44] condemnation some guilt
[2:59:47] something that he can keep pressing that
[2:59:49] same button over and over again he does
[2:59:51] not want you to come to the place where
[2:59:54] you realize what he's doing
[2:59:56] because when you do you've overcome
[2:59:59] when you're able to recognize the enemy
[3:00:01] in all of his tricks you're already an
[3:00:03] overcomer that's what we read today and
[3:00:06] i just sense that i'm not trying to make
[3:00:07] something out of this service just
[3:00:09] whatever god wants is all right with us
[3:00:12] we can go now it's all right we've had
[3:00:14] we've had plenty of church
[3:00:16] but i just feel this just a little bit
[3:00:18] of war
[3:00:19] you're struggling and i don't want you
[3:00:21] to leave in that turmoil
[3:00:23] if you must go you're certainly
[3:00:25] dismissed you certainly can leave
[3:00:27] nobody's holding you here
[3:00:28] but if you'd like to see that little bit
[3:00:30] of turmoil settle you'd like to see that
[3:00:32] little bit of war settled this is how to
[3:00:34] settle it you just come into his
[3:00:36] presence and you begin to worship him
[3:00:39] and lift him up and exalt him and tell
[3:00:41] him what he means to you and he knows
[3:00:44] how to cause just shackles and feathers
[3:00:48] and chains and burdens
[3:00:50] and heaviness to fall right off of you
[3:00:53] it's the atmosphere that shifts things
[3:00:55] and worship and praise is what shifts
[3:00:57] the atmosphere have you got something
[3:00:59] else

[3:44:29] [Laughter]
[3:44:34] [Music]
[3:44:38] is it on
[3:44:41] now uh there's a deliverance that's
[3:44:45] needed here
[3:44:46] and i'm not i don't have much strength
[3:44:48] left
[3:44:49] so i'm calling on this body
[3:44:52] and this is the
[3:44:53] the holy ghost has called out some
[3:44:55] things
[3:44:56] and there's there's a list longer
[3:44:59] but i believe that uh if we'll bind
[3:45:01] together just now our sister can go free
[3:45:04] she does not have to be bound
[3:45:07] and she doesn't need your sympathy
[3:45:10] she needs somebody to speak deliverance
[3:45:12] into her life
[3:45:13] and i know that god is able to do it
[3:45:16] this is serious business
[3:45:18] and we're going to handle it in a
[3:45:20] serious way
[3:45:21] i want you to send your faith this way
[3:45:23] you you that are standing around that's
[3:45:25] wonderful but you don't have to move
[3:45:28] you can put your faith right here you
[3:45:29] can point your hand in this direction
[3:45:32] and we can believe the lord you know
[3:45:34] there comes a time where we've just got
[3:45:36] to be honest with god
[3:45:38] and i believe that her time has come now
[3:45:41] she has to just be honest with him
[3:45:44] and it doesn't matter what you think
[3:45:46] about her what matters is what god
[3:45:47] thinks about her and he calls her his
[3:45:50] own
[3:45:52] but it's time that she walked in
[3:45:53] deliverance
[3:45:54] and freedom
[3:45:56] and i want you to agree with me right
[3:45:58] now as that you all can sing that or
[3:46:01] something else or whatever you want to
[3:46:02] do you keep the music moving not because
[3:46:04] we have to have music but it keeps
[3:46:06] stirring the anointing in us
[3:46:08] and we're just going to keep praying for
[3:46:10] a little while longer and believe god
[3:46:12] but i want to tell you something this is
[3:46:13] a big need today it's a big need it's
[3:46:16] serious
[3:46:17] and only the lord can bring really the
[3:46:19] deliverance that's needed
[3:46:21] but he can
[3:46:22] if she's willing to cooperate with god
[3:46:24] he'll do his part
[3:46:26] i know he will so just reach your faith
[3:46:28] this way and begin to pray for our
[3:46:30] sister right now just ask the lord to
[3:46:32] set her free from the top of her head to
[3:46:34] the soles of her feet
[3:46:36] she's not the only one that needs to be
[3:46:38] honest with herself
[3:46:40] there's others that just need to be real
[3:46:42] honest about who you really are
[3:46:45] [Music]
[3:46:46] we're living in an hour right now that
[3:46:48] it's just kind of a serious season
[3:46:51] and i hear i hear things coming out of
[3:46:53] people's mouth that i know there's no
[3:46:55] more the truth and the man is in the
[3:46:56] moon
[3:46:58] we've got to be careful what we say
[3:47:00] we've got to speak the truth
[3:47:02] we don't have to embellish
[3:47:05] we don't have to exaggerate
[3:47:07] we don't have to add we don't have to
[3:47:09] twist details to make us look better we
[3:47:12] just got to be real
[3:47:14] in the presence of god
[3:47:15] if you find yourself falling into that
[3:47:18] trap repent of that today right where
[3:47:20] you are lord forgive me i don't want to
[3:47:22] add details
[3:47:24] i don't want to embelli i don't want to
[3:47:26] twist things to make me look better i
[3:47:28] want to be pure and holy and delivered
[3:47:31] and set free
[3:47:33] and little seeds planted i don't want to
[3:47:35] be somebody planting negative seeds in
[3:47:37] other people's lives about somebody else
[3:47:40] so let us all as we pray for our sister
[3:47:43] let's all also be honest with ourselves
[3:47:47] and if we can't tell the truth we should
[3:47:49] just shut up we should just be quiet
[3:47:51] don't talk
[3:47:54] just cause you know so much don't mean
[3:47:55] you have to talk so much how many of you
[3:47:57] know there comes a time where we just
[3:47:59] ought to be quiet
[3:48:01] amen amen if we can't tell the whole
[3:48:04] truth just be quiet
[3:48:06] now reach your faith this way saints and
[3:48:09] let's ask the lord to have his way and
[3:48:11] touch our sister

[3:48:34] that have made their move toward this
[3:48:37] that belongs to god
[3:48:39] and she has yielded to it she's given in
[3:48:43] to it
[3:48:44] she's found herself in the ditch with it
