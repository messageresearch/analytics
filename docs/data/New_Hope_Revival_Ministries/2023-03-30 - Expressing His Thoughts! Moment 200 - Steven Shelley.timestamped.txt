[0:00] because you're much older than the body
[0:02] you live in
[0:04] because Eternal God
[0:07] had thoughts about you
[0:10] you had them in eternity
[0:16] [Music]
[0:18] this getting into the presence of the
[0:21] Lord is to help us to understand
[0:25] he wants to have fellowship with us
[0:32] when we sow to the heavenlies
[0:36] when we worship into the heavenlies
[0:40] it creates
[0:43] a movement in the spirit that causes the
[0:46] heavenlies
[0:48] to Want to Break Forth Among Us
[0:50] [Music]
[0:51] because you and I need to understand
[0:54] that we are becoming the same
[0:59] with the word
[1:02] it's not just Jesus the word made flesh
[1:06] a prophet the word made flesh there is a
[1:10] people that show up in the end
[1:14] that I'm going to use my language that
[1:17] flesh out
[1:20] that give a body
[1:22] to the word
[1:24] not the word they carry the word they
[1:26] are
[1:28] you are
[1:31] preach for me you are a word
[1:37] you are a word sent from God
[1:41] because a word is a thought expressed
[1:44] before you were ever formed in your
[1:46] mother's belly you were in his thoughts
[1:49] and every page of your life was already
[1:52] written in his book
[1:56] so when you were a thought in his mind
[1:59] you were one with him
[2:02] and then you were expressed into the
[2:05] Earth and when a thought is expressed
[2:09] it's expressed as a
[2:11] word spoken
[2:14] you're here because you were spoken here
[2:19] a sex act brought a physical body for
[2:22] you to live in
[2:24] the biological systems that God put in
[2:27] place created for you a body to live in
[2:29] but that body is so little really it's
[2:33] so little in comparison to who you
[2:35] really are
[2:36] that's just where you live that's just
[2:39] your car you drive that's just
[2:40] transportation to get the real you where
[2:42] you need to go amen
[2:45] because you're much older than the body
[2:47] you live in
[2:50] because Eternal God
[2:52] had thoughts about you
[2:56] you had them in eternity
[2:59] had them outside of time
[3:02] so there is a part of you that is
[3:05] eternal
[3:12] the abiding is what you do and how do we
[3:15] abide we choose all the time to stay in
[3:18] him
[3:20] because the enemy Hallelujah
[3:23] because the enemy is all the time
[3:26] concocting ways to get you from him
[3:30] to get you distracted to get you
[3:32] burdened to get you worried to bring
[3:35] anxiety into your life and doubt and
[3:38] fear and who am I going to marry and
[3:40] will there be anybody left for me by the
[3:42] time I get old and all these things
[3:45] will I ever be able to pay my bills will
[3:48] it always be from from Payday to all
[3:50] this stuff the enemy wants to use
[3:53] anything and everything he can to pull
[3:56] you out of a of an abiding relationship
[3:59] with Jesus Christ where you are truly a
[4:03] branch
[4:05] living out of his life
[4:08] remember the Apostle said the life I now
[4:11] live is not my own
[4:12] that life died I'm living out of his
[4:16] life now
