[1:09:35] when you learn to have a praise life
[1:09:41] oh it just strengthens the union that
[1:09:44] you have with him you may be seated you
[1:09:46] look beautiful today it's so wonderful
[1:09:49] to see you in the house of the Lord
[1:09:51] and it's wonderful to feel his presence
[1:09:54] today amen and for those of you that
[1:09:57] were concerned they they caught the
[1:10:00] Tiger
[1:10:03] yeah the storm that came to troop County
[1:10:06] just a county over there fell through
[1:10:10] last night in LaGrange and uh Disturbed
[1:10:13] The Wild Animal Safari Park and two
[1:10:15] tigers were loose and they got one right
[1:10:18] away but while we were getting ready to
[1:10:21] start the service they caught the last
[1:10:23] tiger so they got the tiger by the tail
[1:10:26] forgive me I forgive me I had to say it
[1:10:30] please forgive me I should have stepped
[1:10:32] over there to say it right
[1:10:33] but they caught the tiger by the tail
[1:10:36] and everyone can be at rest today I
[1:10:39] wasn't really worried too much about it
[1:10:40] but anyway did any of you see those big
[1:10:43] hailstones that fell in the Grange last
[1:10:45] night huge some of them bigger like a
[1:10:48] like a size of a baseball
[1:10:51] and if you saw I saw some photos this
[1:10:55] morning of of vehicles I mean
[1:10:58] destroyed big big windshields knocked
[1:11:02] out and and dents maybe 40 50 dance
[1:11:06] since in the hood about that big around
[1:11:08] because the hill was so heavy and you
[1:11:10] know what we God was so good to us
[1:11:16] I can't help but think uh I don't know
[1:11:19] did it rain in the night did the wind
[1:11:21] blow did anything happen I don't know I
[1:11:23] don't know it's it's like my granny told
[1:11:26] my granddaddy you've heard me tell it
[1:11:28] she'd get up in the middle of the night
[1:11:29] and he'd say Mildred there's a tornado
[1:11:31] coming it's going to get us it's going
[1:11:32] to blow us away she'd say oh honey go
[1:11:34] back to bed she said go back to sleep
[1:11:36] she said if if it's your time to go it
[1:11:38] doesn't matter whether you're on top of
[1:11:39] the bed or under the bed you're going
[1:11:42] so she said you might as well sleep she
[1:11:44] said we're resting in Jesus
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] and I wasn't worried about you not being
[1:11:51] in church today I knew you'd come on
[1:11:53] anyway this there's no safer place to be
[1:11:56] than in God's presence with his people
[1:11:59] and you can bring his presence right
[1:12:00] there in your home and be safe and we
[1:12:03] all have so much to be thankful for is
[1:12:06] the anniversaries of the terrible uh
[1:12:09] tornadoes just passed you know some
[1:12:11] weeks ago the awful uh remembrances that
[1:12:15] we have the memories we have every year
[1:12:17] of of just how how close they were and
[1:12:21] how protected we are and any way we
[1:12:24] could just take all day today to say how
[1:12:26] many times God has has protected us and
[1:12:30] kept us and anyway we are glad to see
[1:12:32] you in the house of the Lord we're
[1:12:34] missing some today but we trust that all
[1:12:37] is well and we made it home safely
[1:12:40] yesterday afternoon about 4 15 when we
[1:12:44] were trying to Route our way home it
[1:12:47] kept warning us that we were going to
[1:12:48] maybe we should reroute because there
[1:12:51] were very strong thunderstorms around
[1:12:53] the Dothan area yesterday that had had
[1:12:56] done great damage in Mississippi some of
[1:12:58] you know that there was a whole stretch
[1:13:01] of towns wiped out in Mississippi Friday
[1:13:04] evening
[1:13:05] and my wife said well what should we do
[1:13:07] I said well we we just don't want to
[1:13:10] waste that 20 minutes to go around why
[1:13:12] don't we just go right through and just
[1:13:15] believe that the Lord and you know what
[1:13:16] we never saw anything but a few
[1:13:18] raindrops we just drove right through I
[1:13:21] don't know what happened to the awful
[1:13:22] storms that that Maps was warning us
[1:13:24] about but you know he takes care of us
[1:13:27] he takes care of his children
[1:13:29] we're going to get to the word in a
[1:13:31] moment but before we do let me also
[1:13:33] thank you for your prayers for me I came
[1:13:36] all winter long without any sickness
[1:13:37] went all the way through the winter it
[1:13:40] was in my home my wife had it three
[1:13:42] different times my children had it they
[1:13:46] had pink eye they had strep throat they
[1:13:48] had everything and I came all the way
[1:13:49] through all winter long without anything
[1:13:52] until this week
[1:13:53] I woke up not well not feeling well on
[1:13:57] Tuesday and then on Wednesday uh pretty
[1:14:01] pretty rough I decided that if I was
[1:14:03] going to be here for Sunday and and
[1:14:05] being that's one phone call I did not
[1:14:08] want to make
[1:14:10] I did not want to call Brother Greely
[1:14:12] and say well
[1:14:15] and uh so I went to the to the Urgent
[1:14:18] Care and your prayers is what brought me
[1:14:21] through I know that but the doctor there
[1:14:24] a real Precious doctor was really glad
[1:14:28] to meet her and to make her acquaintance
[1:14:30] and she told me that she almost came
[1:14:33] here to Smith Station this was her
[1:14:35] second choice and she almost came here
[1:14:38] to to practice and because of a friend
[1:14:41] of hers in Auburn who had invited her
[1:14:43] but anyway I had an opportunity to talk
[1:14:46] to her about some pretty serious things
[1:14:48] in the Lord he just opened the door and
[1:14:52] I realized that there was more than one
[1:14:54] reason for being there
[1:14:55] she's I said I've got to have this
[1:14:57] knocked out by Sunday and she said do
[1:15:00] you mind shots and I said well I've
[1:15:01] never ran and got in line for one but uh
[1:15:04] whatever it takes or a steroid shot in
[1:15:07] one hip and an antibiotic a shot in the
[1:15:10] hip and five prescriptions and lots of
[1:15:12] prayer
[1:15:13] or I wouldn't be standing here today God
[1:15:16] is good he cleared the infection in my
[1:15:18] eye and uh have a little coughing spells
[1:15:21] from time to time that's okay and I and
[1:15:24] as far as feeling I feel like I could
[1:15:26] run a marathon
[1:15:28] that is the goodness of the Lord that's
[1:15:31] his grace you said what's all that
[1:15:32] medicine in you no it's all the good
[1:15:35] exercise I've been getting
[1:15:37] 247 miles I've walked since February the
[1:15:40] 14th
[1:15:42] and you know that's for me a miracle
[1:15:46] a miracle and most of it I won't say all
[1:15:50] of it but most of it pain-free
[1:15:53] and uh it has been because the Lord was
[1:15:56] inspiring it and he gave the strength to
[1:15:59] do it and uh I'm believing to be able to
[1:16:02] do as much as possible to keep some of
[1:16:04] that up however let me say that walking
[1:16:07] down my road
[1:16:10] and walking around the loop here won't
[1:16:13] be near as much as my three miles of
[1:16:16] undisturbed beach that I've walked on
[1:16:18] almost every day for five and a half
[1:16:20] weeks
[1:16:22] I'm going to miss it I had many many
[1:16:25] many encounters
[1:16:27] on that beach over these last five and a
[1:16:30] half weeks and I'm so thankful for it
[1:16:32] and you'll hear more about some of it as
[1:16:35] time goes on God even sending us to
[1:16:38] people there were many days I walked
[1:16:40] that three miles and never saw but two
[1:16:42] or three people also walking and there
[1:16:45] were times that the Lord would send me
[1:16:47] to someone and as I walked there one day
[1:16:50] two young men from Clemson University
[1:16:52] walked over to me and they said we are
[1:16:55] Christians
[1:16:57] and we have committed two hours a day of
[1:17:01] our spring break to witness for Christ
[1:17:05] and they said we want to know if in
[1:17:07] three words two or three words can you
[1:17:10] describe your life
[1:17:11] and I said I'm very blessed
[1:17:14] and they said well what made you what
[1:17:16] would make you say that do you consider
[1:17:17] yourself a spiritual person
[1:17:24] I said well I guess I don't really think
[1:17:27] of my I mean you know but yes
[1:17:30] and and he said for how long I said
[1:17:32] since I was 18 months old
[1:17:37] and he said well you mean you remember
[1:17:39] 18 months old I said absolutely you have
[1:17:42] an encounter like I had at 18 months old
[1:17:44] and you'll remember it too
[1:17:46] I was quiet I let them do some of their
[1:17:48] talking and at the end of it they said
[1:17:50] this has just been as much for us as
[1:17:53] anything because you've been crying I
[1:17:55] said well they said well could we pray
[1:17:57] for you and I said absolutely I'm I'm
[1:18:00] really kind of struggling in my uh
[1:18:02] feeling today allergies or something I'm
[1:18:05] not sure what it is so I just put my
[1:18:07] hands right up in the air
[1:18:09] and I said just pray for me and they
[1:18:11] begin to pray and they did very well and
[1:18:13] when we got through I thought oh I'm not
[1:18:15] missing my chance
[1:18:18] I said fellas could I pray for you all
[1:18:21] and they said yes absolutely and I began
[1:18:23] to pray and speak into their lives and
[1:18:26] we begin to have wonderful a wonderful
[1:18:28] uh encounter you know that's just we we
[1:18:32] you and I are just light bearers
[1:18:35] we're just carrying the Light of Christ
[1:18:37] and to be honest with you these two
[1:18:40] young men don't know what we know but
[1:18:42] they had some light they they had met
[1:18:45] the Lord there's no doubt in my mind and
[1:18:47] I pointed them in the right direction to
[1:18:49] help them find everything they need to
[1:18:51] make a Rapture and let's just pray for
[1:18:54] them so anyway thank you for your
[1:18:56] prayers for us God is good and didn't
[1:18:59] brother Greeley do an out absolutely

[1:19:14] needed in the right moment and there's a
[1:19:16] lot of preparation that's being made in
[1:19:18] the spirit and the the word was clear
[1:19:21] and the worship was outstanding and the
[1:19:24] atmosphere that you created was
[1:19:26] commendable and and uh anyway we're just

[1:20:56] don't go
[1:20:58] don't go I want to sing this I I didn't
[1:21:00] want to do a lot of singing but I forgot
[1:21:02] I wanted to sing this one little one
[1:21:04] little song but I wanted the people to
[1:21:06] have a chance to sit down they've been
[1:21:07] standing there in an hour and I wanted
[1:21:09] them so can we stand and just sing just
[1:21:11] a little of this it was in my heart as
[1:21:14] we prepare for the word today I want us
[1:21:16] to sing there shall be light or there
[1:21:18] has been light in the evening time
[1:21:26] when the light
[1:21:28] began to shine as promised in this
[1:21:35] evening time when once again
[1:21:38] the son of man
[1:21:41] would be revealed
[1:21:46] all that has happened
[1:21:49] in our day
[1:21:51] no matter what
[1:21:54] the world may say
[1:21:57] bringing light to truth that once was
[1:22:03] concealed give me just a little more
[1:22:05] volume
[1:22:06] there shall be light
[1:22:09] in the evening time there shall be light
[1:22:14] here to lead the bride to that
[1:22:19] marriage supper in the sky
[1:22:27] where the bride
[1:22:29] parade in white
[1:22:32] sit at a table spread for miles
[1:22:37] and the Lambs shall wipe the tears from
[1:22:43] her eyes
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:47] now a prophet came in our day
[1:22:52] because the bride had lost her way
[1:22:58] in a world so full of darkness
[1:23:03] and sin
[1:23:07] but when she heard
[1:23:10] that eagle cry back to the word
[1:23:15] defended
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:19] eyes all the doctrines of the end but
[1:23:26] there has been light there has been
[1:23:29] light
[1:23:30] in this evening time there has been
[1:23:34] light
[1:23:35] here to leave the bride to that
[1:23:41] marriage supper
[1:23:44] in the sky
[1:23:48] where the pride
[1:23:51] parade in white
[1:23:53] City
[1:23:56] spread more miles
[1:23:59] and the lamb
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:05] foreign
[1:24:07] listen one last time
[1:24:10] for a prophet came in our day
[1:24:14] because the bride had lost her way
[1:24:19] in a world
[1:24:22] so full of Darkness
[1:24:25] and sin
[1:24:27] but here's what we did when she heard
[1:24:32] God's Eagle cry back to the word
[1:24:39] leave it behind
[1:24:42] all the doctrines
[1:24:46] of men
[1:24:49] there has been light
[1:24:52] in the evening time there has been light
[1:24:57] here to lead the bride Hallelujah to
[1:25:01] that
[1:25:02] marriage supper
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:15] we'll sit at a table
[1:25:21] and the lamp
[1:25:23] shall wipe the tears from
[1:25:27] her eyes think about this
[1:25:31] and the lamb
[1:25:33] shall wipe the tears from her eyes
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:52] don't we have something to be thankful
[1:25:54] for
[1:25:56] let's remain standing I'm going to have
[1:25:58] to spray you'll just have to forgive me
[1:26:04] I I've got a a smorgasbord for you this
[1:26:08] morning but it's not not connected
[1:26:12] have you ever had a disconnected one
[1:26:14] well you have if you've ever been to one
[1:26:16] because you'll get a little Mexican and
[1:26:19] a little little Seafood maybe if you eat
[1:26:21] it in a little a little Chinese you know
[1:26:23] they like to appeal to all audiences
[1:26:26] well I may not appeal to any
[1:26:28] but I didn't come this morning to be
[1:26:30] appealing I came to be accurate
[1:26:34] and I want you to know we're living in a
[1:26:36] time right now this is an hour to be
[1:26:39] living
[1:26:40] somebody said I wished I wasn't living
[1:26:42] now I there's no other time
[1:26:45] that I'd rather be alive in right now
[1:26:48] right now
[1:26:50] we're we're we're in the culmination
[1:26:54] and the consummation of the ages right
[1:26:56] now that little bride that the prophet
[1:26:59] talked about is emerging really emerging
[1:27:03] she's been building all these years but
[1:27:07] she's beginning to come out from behind
[1:27:09] the hiding post
[1:27:10] she's about to begin to to expose who
[1:27:14] she is
[1:27:15] Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:27:19] NADA NADA it certainly won't be a a
[1:27:23] worldwide Revival that's not what we're
[1:27:26] talking about we're talking about a
[1:27:28] third seal Revival
[1:27:31] the kind brother Branham talked about
[1:27:33] the bride has never had this kind of
[1:27:36] Revival he describes it to us in many
[1:27:39] places he said missing limbs would be
[1:27:41] restored
[1:27:43] oh man
[1:27:45] you're not going to get quiet already
[1:27:46] are you he also said there will be
[1:27:49] ananiasis and sapphiras laying around
[1:27:51] and a few of them
[1:27:54] he said it so how do we know you say
[1:27:56] well I thought all that had already come
[1:27:58] and gone no we hadn't seen those
[1:27:59] ananiasis since the fire is like we
[1:28:02] haven't seen the missing limbs restored
[1:28:04] like like has been promised for this
[1:28:06] great last manifestation of of the
[1:28:09] bridegroom in the bride but there are
[1:28:13] many things that are converging in this
[1:28:16] hour that help us to know the hour we're
[1:28:20] living in so I wanted to to continue
[1:28:23] from where I was uh when I was with you
[1:28:26] a few weeks or two Sundays ago and came
[1:28:29] home for the weekend and I will get to
[1:28:32] that if time will permit that's still my
[1:28:34] desire but I I want to share a few
[1:28:38] things with you that I think will be a
[1:28:39] blessing to you but it's going to be a
[1:28:41] little a little
[1:28:43] discombobulated in the sense that we're
[1:28:45] going to see a little clip of a video
[1:28:47] and then we're going to hear a little
[1:28:48] clip of an audio and then I'm are you
[1:28:50] okay with that these are the things that
[1:28:53] I would have been sharing to you over
[1:28:54] the last last five and a half weeks had
[1:28:56] I been here maybe on Tuesday nights and
[1:28:59] so I've got to get some of it in today
[1:29:02] because we're going into Passover time
[1:29:04] and I want to do a little bit of
[1:29:06] teaching for those of you who are not
[1:29:09] really familiar with why it is such an
[1:29:12] important event it's not important in in
[1:29:16] in historical context only it's
[1:29:18] important because our lamb
[1:29:22] because our Passover Lamb has come and
[1:29:26] he fulfilled that Feast to the letter
[1:29:30] dying at the very hour that the priest
[1:29:33] would have been killing the Lambs in
[1:29:36] Jerusalem and our Lord died at the very
[1:29:40] hour just a few miles from where the
[1:29:43] priests were killing the Lambs for the
[1:29:45] Passover sacrifice and their G and you
[1:29:48] know brother Branham describes it so
[1:29:50] beautifully he he talks about how that
[1:29:52] veil was rent from top to bottom and the
[1:29:56] Earth shook as the scripture declare and
[1:29:59] it was midnight in the middle of the day
[1:30:01] and he talks about all those things uh
[1:30:05] the veil being opened up and then he
[1:30:07] says one of the saddest things that kind
[1:30:10] of reminds me of the theme of the song
[1:30:12] that they were singing this morning he
[1:30:14] said and then the priest
[1:30:16] the religious men of the day took out
[1:30:21] needle and thread
[1:30:26] and began to mend the veil again
[1:30:30] and once again in our day we have seen
[1:30:34] that happen
[1:30:38] are you okay with that
[1:30:40] we have seen God come and unveil himself
[1:30:43] in his word and we have seen religious
[1:30:47] men around this message
[1:30:51] take out needle and thread and start
[1:30:54] sewing up the veil again to make sure
[1:30:57] that the people stand on the outside in
[1:31:01] some kind of reverence
[1:31:03] when the invitation was never to stand
[1:31:06] on the outside the invitation was always
[1:31:10] to come on the inside
[1:31:12] oh let us therefore now come
[1:31:17] boldly before the throne of grace so
[1:31:20] this is going to be a little odd so let
[1:31:22] me read a verse I didn't even and yeah
[1:31:25] David David Senna Texas said people
[1:31:29] don't relate I guess today to to
[1:31:31] Smorgasbord like they would a
[1:31:33] charcuterie board
[1:31:36] so I'm going to bring you this morning a
[1:31:38] charcuterie board
[1:31:40] and I don't know why but when I said
[1:31:42] that I thought of Emily brother just
[1:31:44] made me think of your sister uh when I
[1:31:47] thought of charcuterie because she likes
[1:31:49] all all things pretty and laid out and
[1:31:51] she's quite a foodie and uh so it made
[1:31:54] me think of her when that when I read
[1:31:56] that
[1:31:57] um I didn't even have these verses for
[1:31:59] you all up there
[1:32:00] and uh so
[1:32:03] someone is asking did you mean every
[1:32:06] other weekend or every other month I
[1:32:07] meant every other month every other
[1:32:10] month we have our fellowship meetings
[1:32:12] Okay so that is taken care of I want you
[1:32:15] to turn to two verses of scripture First
[1:32:17] Genesis chapter one you all don't have
[1:32:20] it but you can pull it Genesis chapter 1
[1:32:23] uh beginning in verse 14.
[1:32:27] through verse 19.
[1:32:32] and God said let there be lights
[1:32:37] in the firmament of the heaven
[1:32:40] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:32:44] them be for signs and for seasons and
[1:32:49] for days and years so let's let's
[1:32:52] rehearse that just a moment let them be
[1:32:55] for number one for signs
[1:32:59] see not only to give light
[1:33:02] but but their next most important
[1:33:05] responsibility is for signs
[1:33:08] and then for seasons and then for days
[1:33:12] and years so that we might be able to
[1:33:15] divide time
[1:33:17] it's very important to have these lights
[1:33:20] the sun and the moon the stars the
[1:33:22] planets the galaxies because they help
[1:33:25] us to discern the dividing of time
[1:33:28] now we have to have the Holy Ghost to be
[1:33:31] able to discern the dividing of
[1:33:34] spiritual seasons and the interpretation
[1:33:37] of spiritual signs it requires the Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost but the sun and the moon and the
[1:33:43] stars and the planets are given to help
[1:33:45] us to divide time all right the next
[1:33:48] verse and let them be for lights in the
[1:33:52] firmament of the heaven to give light
[1:33:55] upon the Earth and it was Soul so
[1:33:59] actually to give light was mentioned
[1:34:03] after the spiritual aspect of being a
[1:34:06] sign and God made two great lights the
[1:34:09] greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser
[1:34:11] light to rule the night he made the
[1:34:13] Stars also
[1:34:15] and God set them in the firmament of the
[1:34:19] heaven to give light upon the Earth and
[1:34:23] to rule over the day and over the night
[1:34:25] and to divide the light from the
[1:34:28] darkness and God saw that it was
[1:34:32] good and as you said Tove in Hebrew it
[1:34:36] was Tov and the evening and the morning
[1:34:39] were the fourth day just bow your head a
[1:34:42] moment father I am calling on you now uh
[1:34:46] feeling just a little bit nervous only
[1:34:49] because I I like to be able to to follow
[1:34:55] a little bit of a flow and yet I know
[1:34:57] that some of the things we're going to
[1:34:59] talk about in the beginning will be a
[1:35:01] little disjointed but I ask that you
[1:35:05] would come Lord and honor your your word
[1:35:09] today you you have laid on my heart to
[1:35:12] sort of set us a spiritual scene for
[1:35:15] where we are moving and I'm going to
[1:35:17] need your help to do it so we pray that
[1:35:20] no Spirit would be able to pull our
[1:35:23] attention away or distract us from what
[1:35:26] you might want to say to us today we
[1:35:29] pray that no physical infirmity in my
[1:35:32] body or in the bodies of the people
[1:35:34] would would prevent them from being able
[1:35:36] to focus and hear what you would say and
[1:35:39] we pray for the opening up of our human
[1:35:41] spirit so that you might be able to
[1:35:44] speak directly to who we are and we
[1:35:47] rebuke the Devourer in the name of Jesus
[1:35:49] we take authority over him and we
[1:35:53] declare that he has no legal rights
[1:35:57] he has no legal rights not in this house
[1:36:00] and not in our lives and we give you the
[1:36:03] glory and the honor in the name of the
[1:36:06] Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints
[1:36:08] said amen God bless you and God bless
[1:36:11] all of you precious folks who are
[1:36:15] sending messages from all over the world
[1:36:17] that you are watching and thank you for
[1:36:19] every one of you who have welcomed me
[1:36:21] back and I know that you've been blessed
[1:36:24] during this time and uh I don't want to
[1:36:27] begin to name the the Nations here but
[1:36:29] they are many God is good let me give
[1:36:32] you one more verse and this is in the
[1:36:35] New Testament
[1:36:37] and this is in the Book of Luke also you
[1:36:41] don't have it there chapter 21
[1:36:45] and verse 25.
[1:36:49] and and I'm reading this because I want
[1:36:52] to just call your attention to to the
[1:36:55] planetary parade that has been happening
[1:36:58] this week
[1:36:59] um it is an alignment of planets and
[1:37:03] there are various thoughts and and
[1:37:06] disagreeing concepts of interpretations
[1:37:11] um there are those who study science who
[1:37:15] tell us that it has no significant
[1:37:18] impact on the earth at all well brother
[1:37:21] Branham tells us differently
[1:37:24] he tells us that it marks something
[1:37:26] spiritually when these planets come
[1:37:29] together as they I I didn't even know
[1:37:32] about this until the other night uh we
[1:37:36] were eating it seems to me like we were
[1:37:39] having dinner and we were close enough
[1:37:41] to the sunset that we went out yes we
[1:37:45] walked across the street I was trying to
[1:37:46] think of where we were we walked across
[1:37:48] the street toward the beach access and
[1:37:51] we looked toward the sunset and just as
[1:37:54] the sun was going down I saw the Moon
[1:37:59] the Crescent of the moon was above the
[1:38:02] sun in alignment with the sun and I was
[1:38:05] able to make out four planets
[1:38:08] and it wasn't yet dark the sun just just
[1:38:11] going down by the Horizon and I said you
[1:38:15] know this is this is significant this is
[1:38:17] a significant thing to be able to see
[1:38:19] four so you a lot of you know that I uh
[1:38:23] when I'm sitting out here at volleyball
[1:38:24] with the kids I often take out my my sky
[1:38:28] watch app and show the kids a point that
[1:38:32] you can point it in any direction at any
[1:38:34] Star it'll tell you what the star is if
[1:38:37] it's a light and you don't know what to
[1:38:39] light you you point it it'll tell you if
[1:38:41] it's a planet so I was able to identify
[1:38:44] and I wasn't getting Mercury but I was
[1:38:46] getting all the other planets and I
[1:38:49] learned that it had not it was not quite
[1:38:51] time yet that was early in the week it
[1:38:53] wasn't quite time for you to be able to
[1:38:56] get all five but tomorrow uh night is
[1:39:00] the peak and so if you were to be able
[1:39:03] to be somewhere around sunset tomorrow
[1:39:06] evening and it was clear you would be
[1:39:09] able to see the moon and and five stars
[1:39:14] brother Branham calls that five the
[1:39:16] number of grace we'll play that for you
[1:39:18] in a moment in almost perfect alignment
[1:39:22] and they are within 50 degrees of sky
[1:39:25] space of one another which is an
[1:39:28] interesting thing because sometimes the
[1:39:30] planets will pass close to one another
[1:39:32] but it's very rare for them to be within
[1:39:36] 50 degrees of sky space so that you
[1:39:39] could measure out the sky like if you
[1:39:40] took a protractor and laid it on the
[1:39:43] horizon you're able within 50 degrees to
[1:39:46] make out all five planets and the moon
[1:39:49] uh in in I believe it was June of 2022
[1:39:54] these five planets showed up but they
[1:39:58] were in a far more a broad amount of uh
[1:40:03] sky space or or uh
[1:40:06] degrees of space
[1:40:08] and so I'll give you some statistics in
[1:40:11] just a moment these things happen all
[1:40:13] the time and I rarely mention them I get
[1:40:16] emails from people I get I get videos
[1:40:19] from people I get people talking about
[1:40:22] these things every time there is an
[1:40:25] eclipse every time there is any kind of
[1:40:28] alignment it's not uncommon that there
[1:40:30] would be two or three planets aligned at
[1:40:33] any time uh but I I just unless I feel
[1:40:37] it unless unless something in my spirit
[1:40:40] just kind of grinds I don't even mention
[1:40:43] it to you and you don't mention it to me
[1:40:46] and unless you're the one one of the
[1:40:48] ones who have sent me something because
[1:40:50] if it's not significant for us we just
[1:40:54] let it pass but when I saw that that
[1:40:58] evening and I don't remember exactly
[1:41:00] what evening it was I could look and see
[1:41:02] something in my spirit spoke and said
[1:41:06] this is marking something this time well
[1:41:11] that really got me to start thinking and
[1:41:14] praying a little bit and as I went to
[1:41:16] bed that night I prayed Lord if there's
[1:41:19] something that you want to to do if
[1:41:22] you're calling my attention to something
[1:41:25] I'm going to need some help because this
[1:41:27] is not my area of expertise and so the
[1:41:31] next morning I woke up and the brother
[1:41:34] Ron in the Philippines had posted an
[1:41:37] article that he had found about the five
[1:41:40] uh of planets coming together in
[1:41:43] alignment I thanked him for posting and
[1:41:46] I and I acknowledge to him that with a
[1:41:49] naked eye that's another thing that
[1:41:51] makes this small amount this small
[1:41:54] degree of of of area in space 50 degrees
[1:41:59] it's another thing that makes it so
[1:42:00] amazing is that you're able to identify
[1:42:03] those five planets with the naked eye
[1:42:05] you don't have to have telescope or any
[1:42:08] kind of of something that would give you
[1:42:10] a greater ability to view and I thanked
[1:42:13] him for posting and I told him I was
[1:42:15] able to view four of the planets that
[1:42:18] night with naked eye not even expecting
[1:42:21] to be able to do that
[1:42:23] and over the course of the next few days
[1:42:26] the Lord began to kind of churn in me
[1:42:29] something and uh I'll just share it with
[1:42:32] you without interpretation I'll let you
[1:42:34] begin to ponder on it in your heart and
[1:42:37] see if it's something that we should
[1:42:38] even be noticing but for me I I am to
[1:42:42] notice it because he said to me in my
[1:42:45] spirit I'm marking something this time
[1:42:48] something in the spirit is being marked
[1:42:52] during the alignment of these five
[1:42:55] planets and I'll show you something in a
[1:42:57] moment that might might give you a
[1:42:59] reason to believe that Luke chapter 21
[1:43:02] are you still awake
[1:43:05] and verse 25 Luke 21 25 and there shall
[1:43:10] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[1:43:14] in the stars and upon the Earth distress
[1:43:17] of nations with perplexity the Sea and
[1:43:21] the waves roaring men's Hearts failing
[1:43:24] them for fear and for looking after
[1:43:27] those things which are coming on the
[1:43:29] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[1:43:32] shaken and then shall they see the son
[1:43:36] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[1:43:40] great Glory I don't I don't know if you
[1:43:43] realize or not but but a a great
[1:43:46] fulfillment of this verse has already
[1:43:48] happened
[1:43:51] the son of man has already made himself
[1:43:54] known in a cloud with power and great
[1:43:56] Authority but there's going to yet be a
[1:43:59] physical fulfillment of this verse of
[1:44:01] scripture what I love about prophetic
[1:44:04] verse is that that it comes in phases of
[1:44:07] of fulfillment when I look at the seals
[1:44:11] we just celebrated the 60th anniversary
[1:44:14] of the preaching of the seals one of the
[1:44:16] things I love about the seals is is how
[1:44:19] they come around it wasn't just once and
[1:44:22] for all but brother Branham said these
[1:44:24] writers continue to ride
[1:44:27] and as they continue to ride we can
[1:44:30] recognize through the years that these
[1:44:33] Spirits begin to rise ebb and fall and
[1:44:36] things happen and shift geopolitically
[1:44:38] in the Earth because of what's going on
[1:44:41] and the truth we would have never known
[1:44:43] had it not been opened up for us under
[1:44:45] those seals are you following that it's
[1:44:48] a blessing to know that it just didn't
[1:44:51] ride and fall off the edge of the Earth
[1:44:53] but that spirit continues to ride and so
[1:44:57] we still see the effects of of all of
[1:45:00] those Horsemen we still are seeing the
[1:45:03] effects of them even in the hour that
[1:45:05] we're living in right now just like we
[1:45:07] see the the evils and the weaknesses of
[1:45:10] the church ages all culminated into
[1:45:13] laodicea everything that was wrong about
[1:45:17] all the other Church ages is still wrong
[1:45:19] with the church
[1:45:21] it just culminated in laodicea but
[1:45:24] remember what the Lord said he said in
[1:45:26] the same manner that all of the evils of
[1:45:29] every age gather together in the last
[1:45:31] Church age so did the overcoming portion
[1:45:36] Hallelujah
[1:45:44] Church age we can still take some of
[1:45:46] that in this hour
[1:45:48] it's just building and building and
[1:45:50] building and building until it came to
[1:45:52] the anointing of the flying eagle and
[1:45:54] the Flying Eagle he gets high enough up
[1:45:56] there that he gets to look down and see
[1:45:58] it all and whether you realize it or not
[1:46:00] the bride has been anointed not just the
[1:46:02] prophet the bride has been Anointed with
[1:46:05] that flying eagle anointing and we can
[1:46:08] get up above our circumstances sometime
[1:46:10] in the spirit and see what we need to
[1:46:13] see how many of you believe the higher
[1:46:15] you get the more the more different
[1:46:16] things look
[1:46:18] things begin to look different when you
[1:46:20] get up to Heaven's Vantage Point amen
[1:46:22] this is not a time for sleeping
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:27] I hope you get to take you a big Sunday
[1:46:29] afternoon nap if you're so so inclined
[1:46:32] but you're not going to use my time for
[1:46:34] that
[1:46:35] use your time okay let's go on and
[1:46:38] finish this verse and they shall see the
[1:46:41] son of man coming in cloud with power
[1:46:43] and great glory and when these things
[1:46:45] begin to come to pass then look up
[1:46:50] and lift up your heads for your
[1:46:53] Redemption draweth and I now are we
[1:46:55] there are we yet to a place where we
[1:46:58] should be able to lift up our heads
[1:47:00] because our Redemption draweth not I'm
[1:47:02] asking you a question
[1:47:03] we certainly are
[1:47:05] the key is keeping your head lifted up
[1:47:08] you're not to walk around with the
[1:47:10] Fallen countenance you're not to walk
[1:47:12] around like some bunch of beat up
[1:47:14] wounded broken sad messed up
[1:47:19] twisted up
[1:47:24] I almost said something else I'm glad I
[1:47:26] caught myself
[1:47:29] God is good
[1:47:32] no we're not talking listen the church
[1:47:34] is in the worst shape she's ever been in
[1:47:37] you can say Amen but the bride is moving
[1:47:40] into the best shape of her existence oh
[1:47:43] Hallelujah she's recognizing who she is
[1:47:46] she's about decided that she's going to
[1:47:50] start talking to some of these
[1:47:51] circumstances
[1:47:52] she's going to start speaking the word
[1:47:54] into some of these problems that she's
[1:47:57] been hiding from in the past
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:00] all right here we go and and when these
[1:48:03] things begin to come to pass look up
[1:48:06] lift up your head for your Redemption
[1:48:07] drawing nigh and he spoke to them a
[1:48:09] parable behold the Fig Tree and all the
[1:48:12] trees when they now shoot forth so you
[1:48:15] see and know of your own cells that
[1:48:17] summer is now nigh at hand so likewise
[1:48:21] ye when you see these things come to
[1:48:22] pass know ye that the kingdom of God is
[1:48:26] nigh at hand verily I say unto you this
[1:48:29] generation the generation that sees the
[1:48:31] coming to pass of all these things shall
[1:48:34] not pass away
[1:48:36] till all be fulfilled
[1:48:38] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[1:48:41] words shall not pass away
[1:48:45] now what I wanted to bring to your
[1:48:47] attention
[1:48:49] is that tomorrow evening March 28 excuse
[1:48:53] me that would be Tuesday then
[1:48:55] on the evening of March 28th five
[1:48:58] planets Jupiter Mercury Venus Uranus and
[1:49:03] Mars will gather within a small 50
[1:49:06] degree Sky sector that's the word I
[1:49:09] should have been using
[1:49:10] you you can start your observation soon
[1:49:13] after Sunset and it and and there's
[1:49:16] instructions it will tell you how to
[1:49:18] move up and look up and how many degrees
[1:49:20] if you've got some way of doing that and
[1:49:23] I I wanted to know how common this kind
[1:49:26] of a thing is and there are there are
[1:49:29] many times that there there will be what
[1:49:32] they call a mini planetary alignment
[1:49:34] three planets and sometimes there will
[1:49:37] be what they call a small planetary
[1:49:39] alignment four planets but a large
[1:49:43] planetary alignment is when five or six
[1:49:46] planets come together at the same time
[1:49:50] and uh just to give you a little bit of
[1:49:52] information here only one more time this
[1:49:56] year will there be such an event and
[1:49:59] that is on June the 17th
[1:50:02] a large morning alignment of mercury
[1:50:06] Uranus Jupiter Neptune and Saturn but it
[1:50:09] will be within a 95 degree Sky sector
[1:50:13] where what's happening this week is in a
[1:50:16] 50 degree meaning they're much closer
[1:50:18] and easier to observe by the naked eye
[1:50:22] now watch this
[1:50:24] the next time
[1:50:27] that these naked eye planets will come
[1:50:31] together in an unusual measure they will
[1:50:35] come together in 2014.
[1:50:38] in nine degrees of one another
[1:50:41] how many of you know that's pretty close
[1:50:43] somebody said well the Rapture will be
[1:50:45] and we won't have to worry about I'm
[1:50:46] just telling you what scientists are
[1:50:47] predicting that in 2040 those five
[1:50:51] planets will come together so close that
[1:50:53] it'll be a circle of nine degrees in the
[1:50:57] sky and about every 100 years six or
[1:51:01] more planets will line up and appear
[1:51:03] together within a small area of the sky
[1:51:06] so it is not as common as you might
[1:51:09] think
[1:51:10] for there to be five planets come
[1:51:13] together as these planets will do this
[1:51:16] week now one of the times that they came
[1:51:19] together was in February of 1962.
[1:51:24] in February the 4th of 1962 these five
[1:51:29] planets came together and they began to
[1:51:32] predict everywhere that the world was
[1:51:35] coming to an end anybody heard that
[1:51:38] and uh they they were telling it
[1:51:40] everywhere that that likely on February
[1:51:43] the 4th of 1962 the world was coming to
[1:51:47] an end because the planets were going to
[1:51:49] be so closely aligned almost as never
[1:51:52] before how many of you'd like to hear
[1:51:54] what brother Branham said about that can
[1:51:57] we play that clip of February the 4th
[1:52:01] 1962 brother Branham is in
[1:52:03] Jeffersonville he is preaching the
[1:52:06] communion message there and there are
[1:52:09] three paragraphs we also have it on the
[1:52:12] screen we also I gave those quotes also
[1:52:14] and they they probably pulled it in so
[1:52:17] if you'll take just a moment to see if
[1:52:19] you see those
[1:52:21] they had today's date on them and then
[1:52:23] we could see them as we hear them
[1:52:24] because I don't know how clear the audio
[1:52:26] is and that's paragraph 74 and 75 and I
[1:52:31] also gave you 76 in printed form I think
[1:52:36] it's interesting how brother Branham
[1:52:37] took this he he he he was stirred
[1:52:40] and I hope you can hear it in his voice
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:47] you
[1:53:55] remember the claim it was three stars
[1:53:57] hanging to the orbit when Jesus
[1:54:02] five and five is great
[1:54:05] the number of great three is the number
[1:54:08] perfect
[1:54:09] five is the number of Grace
[1:54:15] and so forth
[1:54:33] it was another Warfare was over yet she
[1:54:35] was
[1:54:36] about
[1:54:41] it
[1:54:44] 'll be his grace
[1:54:46] amen
[1:54:49] so I think
[1:55:01] I made in the eve of it
[1:55:05] now if a man
[1:55:09] yes
[1:55:14] If any man is thirsty let him come to
[1:55:18] Christ he quenches The Thirst he is
[1:55:23] he is the satisfier of all our thirst
[1:55:28] and hunger would you permit me this
[1:55:32] could I play that again
[1:55:34] let's look at it again
[1:55:39] I I feel like I'm boring somebody
[1:55:47] why are you all laughing in the sound
[1:55:49] booth
[1:55:52] in English this time
[1:55:56] she don't know her password to her
[1:55:58] Facebook
[1:56:02] and you all were playing that on
[1:56:04] Facebook
[1:56:05] I learned you something
[1:56:09] brother Brandon's voice is everywhere
[1:56:13] praise God praise God praise God praise
[1:56:17] God praise God I don't know why I feel
[1:56:19] it
[1:56:27] you see in this paragraph here brother
[1:56:29] man said in the early part of the first
[1:56:32] part of the month beginning on the
[1:56:34] second or the fifth or somewhere along
[1:56:36] this month
[1:56:38] he he doesn't even seem to realize that
[1:56:41] on the very day he's speaking is the day
[1:56:43] that it culminated
[1:56:45] you see now like what was happening all
[1:56:47] week you you could have seen it all week
[1:56:49] if you'd been in the right place they're
[1:56:51] saying that that that on the 28th it
[1:56:53] will be the culmination brother banham
[1:56:56] is not even realizing that he is
[1:56:57] speaking on the very day that all these
[1:57:00] planets made their combination and would
[1:57:02] have been easier to view by the naked
[1:57:04] eye he just remembers that it's it's
[1:57:06] about now now is about the time God
[1:57:09] doesn't make mistakes to me it's just
[1:57:11] another little sign there all right and
[1:57:13] it was Indian astronomers
[1:57:18] around this month
[1:57:20] the Indian astronomers predict the world
[1:57:22] to go to pieces
[1:57:31] the World's Gonna
[1:57:37] cost
[1:57:39] yeah one of these days
[1:57:51] holding
[1:57:54] over here
[1:58:14] remember the
[1:58:15] stars came into
[1:58:17] when Jesus
[1:58:21] Jesus died and five is great
[1:58:34] and so forth
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:52] Warfare was over here she was guilty
[1:58:55] Hallelujah
[1:59:02] God said
[1:59:08] so it may mean something I predict that
[1:59:12] there will be a change
[1:59:13] I don't know why it'll be
[1:59:17] happy we're on the
[1:59:20] Earth
[1:59:32] If any man is thirsty let him come to
[1:59:35] Christ he quenches The Thirst he is the
[1:59:39] satisfier of all our thirst and hunger
[1:59:44] I want you to notice that this is
[1:59:47] February of 1962 before the year is over
[1:59:51] before the year of 62 is over brother
[1:59:54] Branham is at sunset
[1:59:59] and a few months after that March of the
[2:00:03] next year the seals are preached
[2:00:05] remember that the the Angels Came months
[2:00:10] before the seals were preached
[2:00:13] so the visitation of the Angels took
[2:00:16] place within just a few months after
[2:00:18] brother random talking about the
[2:00:21] alignment of these planets and what did
[2:00:23] that visitation do and the Revelation
[2:00:25] that followed it opened up the word
[2:00:27] it became an entirely new book to a
[2:00:30] prophet and it became a new book to a
[2:00:33] people can anybody say Amen so how many
[2:00:35] of you would say that something
[2:00:38] spiritual came out of that a moment of
[2:00:43] those planets coming into alignment like
[2:00:46] that five together brother man said I
[2:00:48] wouldn't make fun of that he's pretty
[2:00:49] emphatic wasn't he I wouldn't make fun
[2:00:51] of that he said I don't think you ought
[2:00:54] to do that and then he said I I predict
[2:00:57] that this has a spiritual application I
[2:01:01] believe that it is the coming in of the
[2:01:05] issue of God
[2:01:08] that the great Revelations of the word
[2:01:11] will be open during this time how many
[2:01:14] of you believe that a few months later
[2:01:16] that is indeed exactly what God did now
[2:01:20] why are you bringing that out because I
[2:01:22] all I know is that there is yet
[2:01:26] something that has to open up from all
[2:01:29] that Revelation that God has given us
[2:01:31] we're looking to see the manifestation
[2:01:34] of that bride so in Union with the
[2:01:37] Messiah that whatever he says she
[2:01:40] announces that in the earth and the full
[2:01:43] manifestation of the sons of God becomes
[2:01:45] a reality
[2:01:47] how many of you believe that's when
[2:01:48] cancer leaves the bride body
[2:01:53] you mean you really believe there's
[2:01:55] going to be a people walking around yes
[2:01:57] I do for a quick short work I believe
[2:02:00] there's going to be a bride here on the
[2:02:03] earth fully manifesting the character
[2:02:06] and the nature and the authority of
[2:02:09] Jesus Christ
[2:02:11] I believe it's going to push the schisms
[2:02:13] and the isms in the other direction I
[2:02:17] believe it's going to silence many of
[2:02:19] the religious scoffers
[2:02:21] I believe it's going to be a revelation
[2:02:24] and an application and a and a
[2:02:26] fulfillment and a demonstration of the
[2:02:30] power and authority of the spoken word
[2:02:33] did you know brother Branham said in
[2:02:35] that day that bride will have thus saith
[2:02:39] the Lord or she will hold her peace does
[2:02:43] that sound like a broken down uh a
[2:02:46] wounded sick
[2:02:49] sickness torn weary
[2:02:53] bride dragging to church every Sunday
[2:02:56] can hardly get one foot in front of
[2:02:59] another or does that sound like a people
[2:03:01] who will come forth with deliverance and
[2:03:05] victory with the high praises of God in
[2:03:08] their mouth we're not celebrating our
[2:03:12] wounds we're not celebrating our
[2:03:14] weaknesses we're celebrating our God
[2:03:17] because he's the one that's given us the
[2:03:20] victory by the revealing of his word
[2:03:24] so much to thank him for we can say like
[2:03:29] no other people have been able to say we
[2:03:31] can look right at the Devil and say you
[2:03:34] have no legal rights
[2:03:38] yeah you're a squatter
[2:03:41] you have no legal rights I have repented
[2:03:46] and the grace of God is what's bringing
[2:03:49] me the help I need
[2:03:51] because my obedience can't always be
[2:03:53] there
[2:03:54] how many of you know when my obedience
[2:03:56] doesn't measure up his grace
[2:03:59] always extends Beyond that's no excuse
[2:04:04] not to live a Sanctified life help me
[2:04:07] preach a little that's no excuse not to
[2:04:10] live a life above sin
[2:04:13] the weslians were called to that if the
[2:04:16] last Church age was called To Live above
[2:04:18] sin surely the bride of Christ is called
[2:04:21] to live above sin as well if you believe
[2:04:23] that say Amen so just a few months later
[2:04:26] after those five planets were aligned
[2:04:28] the way they they were in a very in a
[2:04:32] very small uh Specter of sector of space
[2:04:37] then this great visitation took place
[2:04:41] you know there's this whole thing
[2:04:42] brother green used to talk about because
[2:04:45] there were these cosmonauts who were who
[2:04:48] were in a in a Space Capsule and they
[2:04:51] were flying over the Arizona desert and
[2:04:53] and they had they were they were
[2:04:55] Communists and they were atheists and
[2:04:58] they had this experience where they
[2:05:00] looked out the window and they saw these
[2:05:01] angels
[2:05:04] and and they said we we we don't know
[2:05:07] what it was but we know what we saw and
[2:05:10] we want to tell the world about it
[2:05:12] and brother green he believed that he
[2:05:14] had a revelation I I'm not making a
[2:05:16] Doctrine on any of this but he believed
[2:05:18] he had a doctrine that what they saw
[2:05:20] were those seven angels he believed
[2:05:23] that those Seven Angels were still
[2:05:25] somewhere in the atmosphere and that God
[2:05:28] let those atheists communists
[2:05:31] look out the window and see them and
[2:05:34] have to say there is something bigger
[2:05:36] than than science there is something
[2:05:38] bigger than communism in government
[2:05:40] there is something bigger than being an
[2:05:43] atheist or an agnostic and uh he
[2:05:46] believed that somehow God had allowed
[2:05:48] those angels that's why brother Brandon
[2:05:50] was not Disturbed when there was a a
[2:05:52] little I mean brother green was not
[2:05:55] Disturbed when there was a little
[2:05:56] conflict of dates
[2:05:58] you know about the cloud and whether
[2:06:01] Brother band was actually out there that
[2:06:02] day and was he citing the gun and was he
[2:06:05] in Texas or was he there and is that the
[2:06:08] cloud and all the all the controversy
[2:06:10] and brother green said I never got
[2:06:11] caught up in any of that because he said
[2:06:14] I I one time brother Brandon was talking
[2:06:17] about it and he said it could have been
[2:06:18] a day before it could have been a day or
[2:06:19] two after
[2:06:21] and he said I just always took it that
[2:06:23] way and he said in fact I I believe
[2:06:26] those angels somehow are still somewhere
[2:06:28] over that part of the earth somewhere
[2:06:30] out there in the heavenlies he said I
[2:06:32] believe there's something to it he said
[2:06:33] you don't ever know maybe one of these
[2:06:35] days we might be down there and look up
[2:06:37] in the sky and see them there now
[2:06:39] somebody said that's just too much for
[2:06:40] me to believe well I know
[2:06:43] but we serve a supernatural God
[2:06:47] we are called to be a supernatural
[2:06:49] people
[2:06:50] we're living in a supernatural hour
[2:06:54] 60 years
[2:06:56] 60 years the truth of the seals has been
[2:07:00] preached
[2:07:02] week after week in churches all across
[2:07:05] the world
[2:07:07] the truth of the Seven Seals is greatly
[2:07:10] established
[2:07:11] and yet we've got some things that
[2:07:13] brother Branham said about that seventh
[2:07:15] seal that we have not yet fully come to
[2:07:19] understand
[2:07:21] the bride has to
[2:07:23] she's got to get it it's not going to be
[2:07:25] from a preacher somewhere it's got to
[2:07:27] come from the word it's got to come from
[2:07:30] the message it's got to come from what
[2:07:32] he's already said you believe that don't
[2:07:35] you we're not looking for a new message
[2:07:37] we're not looking for a new messenger
[2:07:39] but we are looking for more
[2:07:41] understanding of what we've already
[2:07:42] heard and if you're not you're dead
[2:07:46] you're not only stagnant you're dead if
[2:07:49] you're not asking God quite regularly in
[2:07:52] your life give me more Revelation give
[2:07:55] me more understanding of the word
[2:07:57] now I can't tell you the the steps I
[2:08:00] made asking God up and down that beach
[2:08:02] Lord I want more understanding I want
[2:08:05] more revelation of your word and I want
[2:08:07] you to give me an understanding heart
[2:08:09] got to have it I realize I can't go
[2:08:12] forward in this hour without more
[2:08:15] Revelation and understanding of what
[2:08:17] your word is to be accomplishing in your
[2:08:19] people in this hour I want to discover
[2:08:22] what God's word is supposed to be
[2:08:24] producing in us and I want to yield
[2:08:26] myself to it I want to yield myself to
[2:08:30] it so that my opinion no longer matters
[2:08:32] so that my mind and my will and my
[2:08:35] emotion is surrendered
[2:08:38] to the perfect leadership of the Holy
[2:08:40] Spirit how many of you want his perfect
[2:08:43] leadership in your life
[2:08:46] some can't live today in the in the day
[2:08:49] in the now
[2:08:51] excuse me because they're living in the
[2:08:53] past
[2:08:55] they can't believe that God continues to
[2:08:57] update himself
[2:08:59] come on you see they refuse to
[2:09:01] acknowledge some of the things that
[2:09:02] brother Branham says concerning that
[2:09:04] seventh seal he said I did not
[2:09:08] understand it
[2:09:10] I could not make it out
[2:09:14] it went by me in an unknown tongue
[2:09:21] I'm just telling you what he said
[2:09:23] for all these years they've said say
[2:09:26] what he said say what he said say what
[2:09:28] he said I'm telling you what he said
[2:09:32] could it be
[2:09:34] could it be that there's enough hunger
[2:09:37] in the bride
[2:09:39] could it be that that if there's enough
[2:09:41] hunger in The Bride for such a time as
[2:09:44] this that God will come to US 60 years
[2:09:47] later and give us understanding of what
[2:09:50] we have already heard
[2:09:52] so that we cannot just understand it but
[2:09:55] manifest it
[2:09:57] I I I have to believe
[2:10:01] I have to believe I have to believe the
[2:10:03] voice that said I'm marking something
[2:10:05] this time
[2:10:08] 60 years
[2:10:10] and and then to show you the prophetic
[2:10:13] hour
[2:10:14] that we're living in
[2:10:16] let me show you this video
[2:10:18] from CBN this is
[2:10:21] Josh Alano yosway sent this to me
[2:10:24] but uh
[2:10:26] I'd already read the article but I
[2:10:28] hadn't seen the video
[2:10:29] I tried to get away from this but I did
[2:10:31] a Tuesday night not too many months ago
[2:10:33] about the red heifers remember
[2:10:36] you would you like to have an update on
[2:10:38] the red heifers watch this and I know
[2:10:41] this man this is Christmas
[2:10:43] undisclosed location in Israel plans
[2:10:46] include moving them sometime soon to a
[2:10:49] visitor's center in Silo where the
[2:10:51] Tabernacle of the Lord once stood for
[2:10:53] nearly 400 years the Book of Numbers
[2:10:56] explains that ashes of the red heifer
[2:10:58] are used to purify priests for their
[2:11:01] service in the temple now the Lord spoke
[2:11:03] to Moses and Aaron saying this is the
[2:11:06] ordinance of the law which the Lord has
[2:11:08] commanded saying speak to the children
[2:11:10] of Israel that they bring you a red
[2:11:12] heifer without blemish in which there is
[2:11:15] no defect and on which a yoke has never
[2:11:18] come you shall give it to Eliezer the
[2:11:20] priest that he may Take It Outside the
[2:11:22] camp and it shall be slaughtered before
[2:11:25] him it's awful shall be burned for the
[2:11:28] water of purification it is for
[2:11:31] purifying from sin these red heifers are
[2:11:34] now between one and a half to two years
[2:11:36] old to replicate the ceremony mentioned
[2:11:38] in the Bible they need to be at least
[2:11:40] three years old and within their time
[2:11:43] span they cannot have a blemish or
[2:11:45] anything that would disqualify them for
[2:11:48] the ceremony even one white or black
[2:11:50] hair according to those working on the
[2:11:52] project the ceremony of the red
[2:11:54] heiferate needs to be performed on the
[2:11:56] Mount of Olives and in a place that
[2:11:58] would have looked directly into where
[2:11:59] the temple stood the land I'm standing
[2:12:01] on bought 12 years ago fits both of
[2:12:04] those standards it's had to be exactly
[2:12:06] at the front of place that the priest
[2:12:08] that made this ceremony can see the holy
[2:12:11] of the Holy Place Rabbi Yitzhak Mamo
[2:12:14] owns the land here on the Mount of
[2:12:16] Olives and we hope that in a year and a
[2:12:19] half from today we can make here in this
[2:12:21] area the ceremony of the red heifer that
[2:12:24] actually will be the first step to the
[2:12:27] temple Mamo says the ceremony needs
[2:12:29] priests who have not been defiled by
[2:12:31] touching anything down said the temple
[2:12:34] Institute actually had nine pure priests
[2:12:37] they didn't born in hospital okay they
[2:12:39] born at home because they are placed so
[2:12:42] anyway they don't go to any cemetery and
[2:12:45] the parents keep them in a situation
[2:12:47] that they will not get to any cemetery
[2:12:49] and not going to other any problematic
[2:12:52] place and up here and they are waiting
[2:12:55] so we have the priest we have the red
[2:12:57] effort we have the land and we have
[2:13:00] everything ready we just need to wait
[2:13:01] another one and a half year so we
[2:13:04] believe that it's very likely that the
[2:13:06] ceremony would happen somewhere in the
[2:13:08] area of Passover 2024 out to possibility
[2:13:12] of Xavier 2024 somewhere in that
[2:13:15] timeline the cows would be old enough
[2:13:17] and it would be the proper timeline for
[2:13:20] that ceremony Byron Stinson of Bernay
[2:13:23] Israel helped find the red heifers in
[2:13:25] the U.S he says these would be the first
[2:13:28] in two thousand years and that the
[2:13:30] process toward a third Jewish temple
[2:13:32] began when the Jewish people started
[2:13:34] their return to the promised land from
[2:13:37] the four corners of the world
[2:13:38] culminating with Israel becoming a
[2:13:40] nation and then in 1948 and one day they
[2:13:44] were reborn as a nation and nobody said
[2:13:46] that could happen and then you could
[2:13:48] move forward and Israel continues to be
[2:13:50] this strong nation and all of these
[2:13:53] prophecies start fulfilling there's so
[2:13:55] many now have been fulfill it's just
[2:13:57] incredible the evidence of what God is
[2:14:00] doing with Jerusalem as the center of
[2:14:02] that and the temple is the center of
[2:14:05] Jerusalem and so how can it happen and
[2:14:08] how will it happen I don't think anyone
[2:14:10] really knows for sure Stinson believes
[2:14:12] the temple is meant to be a house of
[2:14:14] prayer for all nations you know in the
[2:14:17] Bible it says when Solomon built the
[2:14:19] first temple he said this is a house of
[2:14:22] worship for all nations that's what the
[2:14:25] temple is and I think a lot of people
[2:14:26] think it's just the Jewish temple but
[2:14:28] that's not true is for all the nations
[2:14:30] of the earth since and says they plan to
[2:14:32] invite everyone to the red heifer
[2:14:34] ceremony that may take place in Passover
[2:14:37] 2024. everything is in place now that
[2:14:41] the red heifers as long as they stay
[2:14:42] pure of one of them stays pure then we
[2:14:45] have everything in place including the
[2:14:47] priests mama says according to the
[2:14:49] Jewish age maimonides there were nine
[2:14:52] red heifers from Moses to the second
[2:14:54] temple it's not his way to write but
[2:14:57] suddenly he said the tent will made the
[2:14:59] Messiah we know that the Messiah will
[2:15:01] make the tent maybe we have the through
[2:15:03] Village to be one of these people that
[2:15:06] helps the Messiah to do it so we're
[2:15:08] waiting
[2:15:10] so Chris Mitchell CBN News the Mount of
[2:15:13] Olives Jerusalem
[2:15:18] yeah go ahead
[2:15:20] [Applause]
[2:15:27] somebody said I don't understand why
[2:15:28] that has anything to do with us brother
[2:15:30] Branham explained that we are the Temple
[2:15:33] of the Holy Ghost and what house will
[2:15:35] you build me and so this certainly
[2:15:37] couldn't apply to the bride don't forget
[2:15:39] folks brother Branham tells us the temp
[2:15:41] the Jews will rebuild the Temple
[2:15:47] tells us they will
[2:15:49] so it's going to be
[2:15:51] how many of you believe that let me ask
[2:15:54] you does anybody believe Los Angeles is
[2:15:56] going to the bottom of the ocean
[2:15:58] why why do you believe that
[2:16:01] because the Vindicated prophet of God
[2:16:03] Said So It lines up with the word it's
[2:16:05] been confirmed for many many years
[2:16:06] hasn't yet come to pass so it has to
[2:16:09] come to pass that same Prophet said the
[2:16:11] Jews will rebuild the Temple on the
[2:16:13] Temple mount
[2:16:15] how many of you believe that he that's
[2:16:17] exactly what the scripture tells us
[2:16:19] because remember Ezekiel prophesies
[2:16:22] about a temple that's larger than the
[2:16:24] Temple Mount that's the millennial
[2:16:25] Temple and then John talks about
[2:16:28] measuring the temple that he saw in the
[2:16:30] spirit and how that is transposed over
[2:16:32] the Earth so we've got the scripture
[2:16:34] we've got the prophets who have
[2:16:36] prophesied we've got that little unction
[2:16:38] in our heart we hear brother Brandon
[2:16:40] crying out watch Jerusalem watch Israel
[2:16:42] watch the Jews see what they're doing
[2:16:45] you've got that witness and anybody who
[2:16:48] has ever stood on that Temple mount
[2:16:53] it was my privilege to show brother
[2:16:56] green who had spent his whole life
[2:16:58] studying Israel and did not know that
[2:17:01] the foundation stone of the Ark of the
[2:17:03] Covenant was sitting on top of the
[2:17:05] Temple Mount and it was my honor to show
[2:17:07] him in the last years of his life and to
[2:17:09] stand with him there and show him the
[2:17:11] stone that was used in the in the in the
[2:17:14] temple and probably was there the day
[2:17:17] the the the veil was rent in Twain and
[2:17:20] he cried like a little bitty baby
[2:17:23] and he said I've known all my life that
[2:17:25] this was going to be and that God was
[2:17:27] going to let these Jews rebuild this
[2:17:30] temple one of these days he will not see
[2:17:33] it with his natural eye he has gone to
[2:17:35] to live in another place but you and I
[2:17:38] may actually be able to we may actually
[2:17:40] see it coming to pass
[2:17:42] physically and and and so a non-priest
[2:17:47] let's go over this nine priests studying
[2:17:50] at the temple Institute where brother
[2:17:51] Greely and I have been we've met the
[2:17:54] directors of the of the Institute my
[2:17:56] father-in-law was with me
[2:17:58] we have talked with them we've discussed
[2:18:00] all of the Holy ephods all of the
[2:18:03] instruments and implements are ready all
[2:18:06] everything that needs to happen is in
[2:18:08] place
[2:18:09] now we know there are non-priest born at
[2:18:12] home not in a hospital
[2:18:14] never been around the Dead
[2:18:17] and now there are heifers within a year
[2:18:21] and a half of being ready
[2:18:25] so that makes this a very exciting time
[2:18:28] prophetically
[2:18:29] because there are some things that have
[2:18:31] to take place before the mercies of God
[2:18:33] return to the Jews the Gentile numbers
[2:18:36] are finished
[2:18:38] something's got to bring the rest of the
[2:18:40] remnant Gentiles in
[2:18:42] what about a Revival in the bride what
[2:18:46] about a move in the bride of Christ
[2:18:48] what about dismantling the accuser
[2:18:51] putting his accusations down getting
[2:18:54] them under the blood repenting cleaning
[2:18:57] up our lives getting filled with the
[2:18:59] Holy Ghost getting ready to go home
[2:19:03] and then there's one more that was two
[2:19:06] of the three the Third
[2:19:08] then I'll preach for two hours
[2:19:13] I'm nearly done
[2:19:15] not preaching
[2:19:19] we're at Passover time
[2:19:22] and
[2:19:25] we don't celebrate Passover
[2:19:28] in the sense of keeping Passover
[2:19:32] it's it's near near to Impossible it's
[2:19:34] nigh to impossible to do it and totally
[2:19:36] unnecessary to do it in the way that the
[2:19:39] Jews are doing it just to be completely
[2:19:41] honest with you
[2:19:42] Jesus has fulfilled for us the Passover
[2:19:46] but it is such a beautiful picture of
[2:19:49] God's meticulous nature
[2:19:52] and how he is determined to fulfill
[2:19:56] everything that he has spoken
[2:20:00] and so when we spend a little time next
[2:20:02] weekend in one of the services spending
[2:20:05] a little time on on what Passover really
[2:20:09] means and how Jesus fulfilled Passover
[2:20:12] and what brother Branham had to say
[2:20:14] about Passover and he had a whole lot
[2:20:16] more to say about Passover and about the
[2:20:19] sacrificial lamb and about the
[2:20:21] resurrection of the Lamb than he ever
[2:20:22] did about something they like to call
[2:20:24] Easter
[2:20:27] all right
[2:20:29] you know what I mean eggs and bunnies
[2:20:31] and new frogs and new Bonnets and all
[2:20:34] the things that brother Branham said
[2:20:35] that people get caught up in that have
[2:20:36] nothing to do with the scripture help me
[2:20:39] a little bit
[2:20:41] even naming it you know even even the
[2:20:43] King James translators of the Bible
[2:20:45] choosing the name of a pagan goddess
[2:20:50] instead of the of the word that was
[2:20:53] actually in the original was pesach
[2:20:56] which is Passover
[2:20:58] and the and the King James translators
[2:21:00] under the great influence of the Roman
[2:21:02] Catholic system we now know
[2:21:05] they decided to to rename it because
[2:21:07] they didn't want the New Testament to
[2:21:09] sound too Jewish
[2:21:11] interesting isn't it
[2:21:14] so I try not to even use that word but
[2:21:16] not because I I think it's wrong to
[2:21:19] celebrate the resurrection
[2:21:22] but the resurrection is not a day
[2:21:25] it's not one Sunday out of 52 what is
[2:21:29] the resurrection the resurrection is him
[2:21:33] the resurrection is a person Jesus said
[2:21:36] I am the resurrection and the lie and we
[2:21:39] don't celebrate Jesus with an Easter egg
[2:21:42] or with an Easter Bunny or with an
[2:21:46] Easter basket or with a New Dress
[2:21:49] everyone trying to outdo one another
[2:21:52] on that's not what we're doing we're
[2:21:55] celebrating the resurrection of Christ
[2:21:57] every day
[2:22:01] but keeping that in mind there's
[2:22:04] something very interesting about this
[2:22:05] Passover
[2:22:09] I think the Lord drew me to it
[2:22:13] did you all know that brother Branham
[2:22:15] was born during Passover
[2:22:18] he was not only born which we've
[2:22:21] mentioned many times through the years
[2:22:22] he was not only born during Passover but
[2:22:26] he was born on the first full day of
[2:22:28] Passover
[2:22:30] now anybody who knows anything about the
[2:22:32] Jewish Day knows that it doesn't begin
[2:22:34] at six a.m in the morning does it it
[2:22:37] begins when
[2:22:38] Sunset the day before
[2:22:41] and so Passover in the year of uh that
[2:22:46] brother Brandon was born
[2:22:48] 1909
[2:22:50] it began in the evening
[2:22:54] on April the 5th
[2:22:57] and brother Brandon was born the next
[2:23:00] day
[2:23:01] on April the 6th the first full day of
[2:23:06] Passover
[2:23:08] Passover in 1909
[2:23:12] went from April the 5th to April the
[2:23:15] 13th on the Gregorian calendar
[2:23:18] it's always from Nissan 15 to Nissan 22
[2:23:23] on the Hebrew calendar
[2:23:25] but it's never the same
[2:23:28] rarely the same on the Gregorian
[2:23:31] calendar
[2:23:32] because the Hebrew calendar is a lunar
[2:23:34] moon calendar and the Gregorian calendar
[2:23:37] is a solar calendar that operates on the
[2:23:40] Sun how many of you understand that
[2:23:43] but this year
[2:23:45] this year
[2:23:47] just a few days after our meetings
[2:23:50] Passover will begin
[2:23:52] in 2023
[2:23:54] and it will be exactly the days
[2:23:58] that Passover was the Year brother
[2:24:00] Branham was born
[2:24:01] 1909. it will begin on Monday evening
[2:24:05] the first full day will be Tuesday and
[2:24:08] it will go exactly from April the 5th to
[2:24:11] April the 13th it did it in 1909 and
[2:24:14] it's doing it again in 2023 and the Lord
[2:24:18] spoke to my heart he said I want you to
[2:24:20] mark that
[2:24:22] now why he didn't say
[2:24:25] so that's what I'm doing this morning
[2:24:27] I'm marking it
[2:24:29] I'm marking it I'm marking that five
[2:24:32] planets are aligning in a 50 degree
[2:24:37] sector of the sky
[2:24:41] and that this Tuesday is the culmination
[2:24:44] of that I want to mark that I'm marking
[2:24:46] the fact that we are perhaps two years
[2:24:50] away
[2:24:51] from the first red heifer ceremony
[2:24:54] in 2000 years
[2:24:57] and I am marking the fact that we are
[2:25:00] about to enter a week of Passover
[2:25:03] celebrating Jesus
[2:25:05] his broken body
[2:25:09] you know a lot of people in the church
[2:25:11] fail to understand that we would have no
[2:25:13] communion
[2:25:16] if it weren't for Passover
[2:25:18] it was Passover that he was talking
[2:25:20] about when he was meeting with his
[2:25:22] disciples
[2:25:24] what the church likes to call Palm
[2:25:26] Sunday there would have been no Palm
[2:25:28] Sunday
[2:25:30] had there not been a need to get to
[2:25:32] Jerusalem
[2:25:33] so that he could celebrate the Passover
[2:25:36] with his disciples
[2:25:40] and he's actually going through the
[2:25:43] Seder of the Passover
[2:25:45] when he says to them this cup
[2:25:50] this cup of redemption
[2:25:53] not the first cup
[2:25:55] the cup of redemption this is my blood
[2:26:00] shed for you
[2:26:03] he was literally taking what we call
[2:26:06] matzah
[2:26:07] which was unleavened bread like we use
[2:26:10] in communion he was literally breaking
[2:26:13] in the Seder in the Passover
[2:26:16] he's breaking this unleavened bread and
[2:26:20] he's giving it to them take eat
[2:26:22] this is my body which is broken for you
[2:26:26] take drink this cup this is my blood
[2:26:29] this is the Covenant in the New
[2:26:31] Testament
[2:26:33] this is the updating
[2:26:36] not the replacing of an old Covenant
[2:26:40] but the updating of an old Covenant and
[2:26:44] then he said this do you
[2:26:47] foreign
[2:26:51] if we were to get technical
[2:26:54] and I'm closing
[2:26:57] there is no scripture that tells us to
[2:27:00] celebrate his birth
[2:27:04] there is no scripture
[2:27:07] that tells us to celebrate his
[2:27:09] resurrection
[2:27:10] we do it and we should and we should
[2:27:13] remember that he was born because if he
[2:27:15] hadn't been born he couldn't die
[2:27:18] we do it practically
[2:27:21] but he did tell us
[2:27:24] the scripture does tell us to remember
[2:27:26] his death
[2:27:28] this do ye
[2:27:30] in remembrance of me as oft as she eat
[2:27:33] it
[2:27:34] you eat it in remembrance of me
[2:27:38] and this you do until I come
[2:27:42] because one of these days I'm going to
[2:27:44] sit down with you in the New Kingdom
[2:27:47] come on
[2:27:49] brother man I'm talking about in this
[2:27:51] quote The Nearness of the kingdom of God
[2:27:53] I'm going to sit down with you in the
[2:27:55] New Kingdom and I'm going to drink this
[2:27:57] cup I'm not going to drink it again
[2:27:58] until I drink it with you in the New
[2:28:00] Kingdom he's prophesying of the marriage
[2:28:03] supper of the Lamb
[2:28:04] so I I just you know I I thought I would
[2:28:08] take a few minutes and and then preach
[2:28:09] but I'm doing I'm really done for today
[2:28:12] I don't think this is going to hurt any
[2:28:13] of us
[2:28:15] I would very much like for us to
[2:28:18] consider the season that we're living in
[2:28:20] what if we are approaching a time that
[2:28:23] God is going to answer prayer this
[2:28:25] little bride is cried out we want to
[2:28:28] Manifest this word
[2:28:30] we want to live a life that that is more
[2:28:34] in alignment with the truth that has
[2:28:37] changed us
[2:28:39] we want the flesh battle to come to an
[2:28:42] end
[2:28:43] we want all jealousies to be gone and
[2:28:46] resentments to be gone and during this
[2:28:50] season of Passover is when we search our
[2:28:53] lives for living
[2:28:55] if there's any Prejudice in me show me
[2:28:58] Lord
[2:29:01] if there's racism in me
[2:29:04] show me Lord
[2:29:06] if I'm carrying something against
[2:29:09] somebody
[2:29:11] show me Lord
[2:29:13] you see the more we search the more we
[2:29:15] dig the more we prepare ourselves before
[2:29:18] him
[2:29:20] the closer he draws us
[2:29:23] it's not our obedience that gets the job
[2:29:25] done it's his grace that's the balance
[2:29:29] but it behooves us it calls us to want
[2:29:33] to be closer to him
[2:29:35] that's one of the things that makes the
[2:29:38] the Fulfillment of the Feast of east of
[2:29:40] Bibles so beautiful
[2:29:42] it's because God gives us another way of
[2:29:46] connecting to him
[2:29:50] it's not a bunny
[2:29:53] it was a lamb
[2:29:56] when we begin to study these things 30
[2:29:58] 30 years ago
[2:30:02] when we begin to teach the church 30
[2:30:04] years ago the details of how Christ
[2:30:07] fulfilled the Passover there was never
[2:30:09] another communion service after that
[2:30:11] that I didn't I didn't remember I didn't
[2:30:14] feel more connected to communion than I
[2:30:17] had ever felt before because God used
[2:30:20] the Fulfillment of the biblical Feast to
[2:30:22] give me another way of connecting to him
[2:30:24] and understanding the language that he
[2:30:27] was speaking
[2:30:28] you see this seder of the second temple
[2:30:30] period this particular meal that had
[2:30:33] been celebrated in every Jewish Home for
[2:30:35] a number of years by the time Jesus was
[2:30:38] born it had a particular order
[2:30:40] and it was set and there's not to be a
[2:30:43] lot of additional uh paraphrasing and
[2:30:46] interpretation and Jesus just like he
[2:30:49] did that day in the in the in the temple
[2:30:52] in the in the synagogue of Nazareth he
[2:30:55] gets up and reads the scripture and then
[2:30:57] he said this day the scripture is
[2:30:59] fulfilled in your ears
[2:31:01] so here he is the last passover with his
[2:31:04] disciples and he begins to to go off
[2:31:07] script
[2:31:10] he begins to talk a little differently
[2:31:12] about the bread this is my body
[2:31:16] this is my blood
[2:31:19] and it connects us it connected the
[2:31:22] disciples to the Passover I promise you
[2:31:25] that the next Passover was was different
[2:31:28] than any they had ever celebrated before
[2:31:31] because they now saw the real meaning of
[2:31:34] what they had done mindlessly the Jews
[2:31:38] have mindlessly repeated these these
[2:31:41] things over and over again without
[2:31:43] understanding but you and I have been
[2:31:45] given an understanding that the lamb has
[2:31:48] come he has fulfilled every without
[2:31:51] blemish
[2:31:53] without spot you heard them talking
[2:31:56] about the examination of these red
[2:31:58] heifers if if in the next year and a
[2:32:00] half to two years one black hair appears
[2:32:05] one white hair appears that and they
[2:32:08] can't pluck it
[2:32:10] you say I would just be easy to pluck
[2:32:12] that one hair out they can't do that
[2:32:14] they're Bound by their own law and code
[2:32:17] if one little hair goes awry
[2:32:21] then that particular animal is no longer
[2:32:24] worthy for the red heifer sacrifice or
[2:32:27] offering red heifer offering and so it
[2:32:32] reminds us in this season as we're
[2:32:34] searching Our Own Heart Lord if if there
[2:32:36] be any wicked way in me
[2:32:39] if there's any resentment in me if
[2:32:42] there's any jealousy in me if there's
[2:32:44] anything in me that's not lining up with
[2:32:46] your word it seems like this is a
[2:32:48] prophetic season
[2:32:50] planets are lining up red heifers have
[2:32:53] been discovered again we're closer than
[2:32:56] we've been in 2000 years to seeing that
[2:32:58] become a reality and here we are at a
[2:33:02] Passover season that runs exactly
[2:33:04] consecutively with the one that brother
[2:33:07] Branham was born under
[2:33:09] and it causes us to just perhaps have
[2:33:12] this longing in our heart to understand
[2:33:15] everything that you have for us to
[2:33:17] understand Lord we're we're just just
[2:33:20] common men and women we can't get it all
[2:33:23] figured out but we come to you and we
[2:33:26] surrender our hearts
[2:33:28] we surrender Our Lives Before You Why
[2:33:31] Don't We Stand Together
[2:33:34] why don't we have the musicians to come
[2:33:36] and I I won't make any apologies for for
[2:33:39] this even though it's quite odd
[2:33:42] it's just what we need maybe I'm going
[2:33:44] to trust that and hope that that I
[2:33:46] didn't miss him
[2:33:54] oh that's nice sister Joyce
[2:33:56] you just said 30 I know she didn't do it
[2:33:59] for me to read it she didn't see it
[2:34:01] later but 30 years ago on their
[2:34:03] anniversary is when they visited here
[2:34:05] was that like the first time you were
[2:34:07] here 30 years ago for Passover they came
[2:34:10] 30 years ago for Passover meetings with
[2:34:13] us and it was on their wedding
[2:34:15] anniversary which which I was supposed
[2:34:17] to mention
[2:34:20] sister Doris's birthdays today would you
[2:34:23] all say happy birthday to Sister Doris
[2:34:29] Carter's birthdays today would you all
[2:34:32] say happy birthday to Carter
[2:34:33] [Applause]
[2:34:37] Tuesday brother and sister Greely will
[2:34:39] celebrate how many years of wedded bliss
[2:34:42] 32 years of marriage
[2:34:45] outstanding
[2:34:48] and on the same day our sister Greta
[2:34:50] Christensen in Norway has a birthday so
[2:34:53] we send her our love from Alabama we
[2:34:56] remember them and loved them fondly God
[2:34:58] bless you
[2:35:01] why don't we just talk to the Lord for
[2:35:04] just a moment it's the the musicians are
[2:35:06] getting a song and Benjamin's getting
[2:35:08] ready to lead us in worship all I all I
[2:35:11] want us to do
[2:35:12] is to make sure that the enemy has
[2:35:15] nothing
[2:35:16] that he can hold over our lives
[2:35:19] why don't I give you just
[2:35:21] why don't I give you just one little
[2:35:23] quote here
[2:35:32] Hallelujah
[2:35:39] I'm not always this scattered sometimes
[2:35:41] I'm worse
[2:35:45] thank you Jesus
[2:35:52] in the message expectation you should
[2:35:54] find that Austin may take you a minute
[2:35:57] it's in my notes
[2:35:59] paragraph 32
[2:36:05] brother Branham said I I said well
[2:36:07] that's up to them
[2:36:09] I don't know but I I said you never know
[2:36:11] no matter how much you scream how loud
[2:36:14] you scream how much you pray that
[2:36:16] Devil's got a legal right to stay right
[2:36:19] there and he will stay there too that's
[2:36:21] right he's got a right to stay there
[2:36:24] not only that but if you supposed to
[2:36:26] have done something and didn't do it he
[2:36:29] has a legal right of Disobedience so
[2:36:31] don't tell me because of the other quote
[2:36:33] your obedience doesn't matter
[2:36:38] it matters
[2:36:42] wouldn't it be wonderful if we could
[2:36:43] keep all the scriptures in Balance
[2:36:45] wouldn't it be wonderful we could keep
[2:36:47] all the quotes in balance
[2:36:50] not go too far off on anything but just
[2:36:53] walk right in the middle of the word it
[2:36:54] would be beautiful he said so that's
[2:36:56] what it is calming that person you find
[2:36:59] out just where the cause is
[2:37:02] then you know where to start for the
[2:37:04] Cure see
[2:37:06] it's unconfessed sin many times so you
[2:37:09] watch what you say stopping this one out
[2:37:11] and stomping that one out see that's
[2:37:14] right faith will move
[2:37:16] but not when he's got a legal right
[2:37:20] Satan knows what his rights is
[2:37:24] what he hasn't got a right to
[2:37:29] that's right clean yourself up before
[2:37:32] God and come before him how
[2:37:35] pure and holy ask then see and now
[2:37:40] search your life out he swore by himself
[2:37:45] the next one now by faith my brethren
[2:37:49] and my mother right move right into this
[2:37:52] blood cell
[2:37:54] with the Lord Jesus
[2:37:58] Now by faith my brethren and my mother
[2:38:01] move right into this blood cell with the
[2:38:05] Lord Jesus where all those Redemptive
[2:38:09] blessings are yours
[2:38:11] you're everyone Christians I presume and
[2:38:14] then if you are Christians you have a
[2:38:16] right a legal right
[2:38:18] for everything that Christ died for it's
[2:38:22] your possession you own it it's yours
[2:38:27] now the only thing that you can do is
[2:38:29] like Abraham
[2:38:31] after he had endured a fight he obtained
[2:38:34] the promise Satan just don't don't just
[2:38:38] let you take it easy
[2:38:39] you've got to have faith you've got to
[2:38:42] believe it somebody read the last one
[2:38:49] then one of my favorites gifts
[2:38:53] 1956.
[2:38:56] paragraph 83
[2:38:59] will you believe all over the building
[2:39:01] at this time
[2:39:02] is that the things he did when he was
[2:39:04] here on Earth then his healing never
[2:39:07] changes it's him do you believe now then
[2:39:10] then believe
[2:39:12] let us pray
[2:39:14] our heavenly father may all
[2:39:16] superstitions leave the people
[2:39:19] that devil tries to keep them in
[2:39:21] darkness and truly they're designed to
[2:39:24] be the Seed of Abraham and I ask that
[2:39:27] you go and send away this evil or give
[2:39:31] me the spirit of power Satan I wish to
[2:39:35] speak to you

[2:39:56] burial and Resurrection these people
[2:39:59] represent him you believe that
[2:40:02] and you got your demons all bound into
[2:40:04] these people and you think you can hold
[2:40:07] them but you're just a bluff you're
[2:40:10] stripped of every privilege you have
[2:40:15] you have no legal right Jesus stripped
[2:40:19] you of every Power you had at Calvary

[2:40:34] Doubt come out of this people in the
[2:40:38] name of Jesus Christ leave this people

[2:40:51] believe you'll believe right now rise

[3:15:17] Feast going on
[3:15:19] the bridegroom is pouring his love out
[3:15:26] love one another
[3:15:30] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[3:15:34] [Music]
[3:15:35] you're so I'm just not one who expresses
[3:15:38] love start doing it
[3:15:44] I'm not a hugger become one
[3:15:47] [Music]
[3:15:52] I don't like to get close to people
[3:15:55] change your way of doing
[3:15:57] [Music]
[3:15:58] this body of Christ it matters
[3:16:08] [Music]
[3:16:16] Worthy is the Lamb
[3:16:23] let me just say this to you when you're
[3:16:25] when you're standing up here
[3:16:28] don't use your time
[3:16:31] to say
[3:16:32] let brother Shelley speak to me or let
[3:16:34] brother Greeley speak to me or let some
[3:16:36] let them come and pray for me don't use
[3:16:38] your time that way okay
[3:16:40] God will hear you sometimes he'll honor
[3:16:43] you if that's your request but don't use
[3:16:45] your time for that
[3:16:47] you you don't need a word
[3:16:52] you just need to give it to him
[3:16:57] and sometimes there's so many doing that
[3:16:59] at one time
[3:17:02] there'd be no way to do it
[3:17:05] you don't need us for that you need us
[3:17:08] for other things
[3:17:11] but when you get in God's presence he's
[3:17:13] the one
[3:17:16] one of the sermons I preached that got
[3:17:19] me put out of the message
[3:17:22] was
[3:17:24] Two's Company
[3:17:26] Three's a Crowd
[3:17:30] and I preached 25 30 years ago and
[3:17:33] that's when they'd give me the boot
[3:17:36] that you can't go in that place of
[3:17:38] intimacy with you and brother Branham
[3:17:40] and Jesus
[3:17:42] you can't go in that Oneness with you
[3:17:45] and your pastor in Jesus
[3:17:48] Scott or your Apostle or whatever they
[3:17:50] have today
[3:17:51] are your five full prophet in Jesus or
[3:17:54] your evangelist indeed it's you and him
[3:17:57] and to be honest with you there's
[3:17:59] something in our nature sometime that we
[3:18:01] would rather have three
[3:18:04] than to face him
[3:18:07] than it just to be us have you ever had
[3:18:10] to go somewhere you want to take
[3:18:11] somebody with you to make it less
[3:18:13] awkward
[3:18:15] so sometimes people will cling to
[3:18:17] brother Branham
[3:18:18] because they don't really want to face
[3:18:20] Jesus on their own
[3:18:22] or they'll cling to their Pastor because
[3:18:24] they don't really want to have to have
[3:18:26] Jesus speak directly to them
[3:18:28] but let me tell you something the whole
[3:18:30] purpose of of God revealing himself
[3:18:32] through this message was so that you
[3:18:34] could have Oneness with Jesus Christ
[3:18:37] Oneness with him Union with him this
[3:18:40] invisible Union uh is invisible in bond
[3:18:45] but it's going to be visible in
[3:18:47] manifestation
[3:18:49] it's going to manifest itself in a
[3:18:51] visible way it's going to demonstrate
[3:18:54] itself in a visible way the sick are
[3:18:57] going to be healed the the oppressed are
[3:19:00] going to be set free
[3:19:02] the bride is going to appreciate the
[3:19:04] authority that God has given brother
[3:19:06] random said you may not have the power
[3:19:09] but you have the authority
[3:19:12] and the reason why you don't have both
[3:19:14] is because Jesus has the power
[3:19:17] and you've got to have him
[3:19:20] you've got a fellowship with him in that
[3:19:22] power you've got to be one with him in
[3:19:24] that power you can't leave him out of
[3:19:26] the equation it's not you and your
[3:19:29] Authority
[3:19:30] it's you and Jesus how many of you know
[3:19:33] that
[3:19:34] you've got to fall in love with him it's
[3:19:37] wonderful when you respect your pastors
[3:19:39] your leaders or those spiritual men that
[3:19:41] God has sent to help you it's right it's
[3:19:44] right to do it it's right to honor them
[3:19:46] it's right to appreciate them respects
[3:19:49] is a very important part of of the truth
[3:19:52] that God's delivered to us in this day
[3:19:54] brother bran I'm preaching often on
[3:19:56] showing respects but don't you get to a
[3:19:59] place where you are more connected to
[3:20:02] your leader Earthly than to Jesus Christ
[3:20:05] when you come up here you come up here
[3:20:07] knowing that he's going to meet you here
[3:20:09] and he's going to help you I'd like to
[3:20:12] hear the church say something
[3:20:14] amen
[3:20:16] amen amen amen amen little brother are
[3:20:20] we all right you're not offended at me

[3:21:23] microphone to a preacher
[3:21:25] but I but I wanted you to hear it and
[3:21:28] then you can't hear it without a mind
[3:21:29] but I know there's just something that

[3:22:13] but I got to Roanoke and I've counted
[3:22:14] lightning bolts hit two times or three
[3:22:16] times but as I came into Roanoke I saw
[3:22:18] lightning flashing this guy that I lost
