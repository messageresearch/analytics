[Music] love god i was listening to this song yesterday and i heard him the guy that wrote this song talk about where he wrote it from and he read this scripture then they drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying the man that receiveth sinners and eateth with them and he spake this parable unto them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that one which is lost until we find it and when he had found it he lay it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost and i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repented more than over 99 just persons which need no repentance yes there's nothing that god won't do to come after you it doesn't matter what you've done [Music] hallelujah

[Music] lord how we thank you for this never-ending and precious love that you have shed upon us lord every one of us have had our time in the wilderness every one of us have gone through times where we wandered away from the fold mindsets that we allowed to build up rebellions that we followed after thoughts that we yielded to o lord but yet you have come after us and you knock down the lies you climb the walls after us lord and we just want to thank you today for your love that bypasses all of those barriers that we have created and built up trying to hide from your presence but oh lord we remember david who told us that we could never hide from your presence we could not go deep enough in the depths of the water to get away from you we could not ascend a high enough mountain but you would find us lord and we just want to pour out our love on you today and say thank you for coming after us oh lord it was you that sought for us you sought for us lord we thank you that we can be in your presence and receive of your love [Music] oh how we give you praise lord how we give you praise thank you lord it's in this atmosphere lord where the doubts are settled it's in this atmosphere where bodies are made well it's in this atmosphere lord where we can reach up for the promises of god and see them fulfilled in our lives oh lord i pray for each one under the sound of my voice if they have not already reached up may they reach up in this atmosphere find the answer oh god i thank you that you are our answer thank you lord overwhelming precious love of god how we thank you how we thank you do you lift your hands into his presence one more time if you're able to reach both of them just lift them straight up in the air lord i receive i receive in this atmosphere what you desire to pour into me i'm creating a funnel for you to just pour it in i am opening wide every door and every window for whatever you want to pour into my life [Music] um [Music] hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord i bless you jesus i bless you jesus [Music] i bless you jesus i bless you jesus i've always been afraid to uh a lot of times we get things in our minds and we you know we speak them but i've always been afraid i just want to make sure that it's the lord and i i don't know i don't know the lord didn't give me one one thing to say before i got up here but i'm trusting him that this is him and that he's telling me to speak to you and tell you that he's real pleased with the worship and the lives that you're living these he's very happy about it because you're the cream of the crop there's not many people that he can depend on to be honest and clean like you are he said watch the little foxes it's not the big things that he that you're going to do you're not going out and you're not going to drink or run around on your wife or do wrong you young boys are not going to do wrong and the devil knows that but it's the little things he said be careful because every idol word every word that you speak you are sowing a seed and you will reap that seed and he doesn't want you to reach reap nothing but a good harvest he he's starting to drop in here he's here his spirit is here but he he wants to drop in here and he wants those things that he wants to do for each and every one of us uh we're chosen whether or not you like it whether or not you agree with it you are chosen to be here and and the lord is you're in training you're learning you uh you are uh if you feel uh and i'm going to tell you if you feel a little urge that god wants you to speak or something do it it's not an easy thing to do it's not easy to sing it's not easy to testify it's not easy to prophesy but if you feel that little urge move on it i i don't i don't want to do or say anything that god wouldn't want me to but i'm telling you the lord has really laid it on my heart heavy today watch the seed that you sow when you speak bad of a brother or sister or you i don't want to say you make fun of nobody i don't believe you do that but just be careful how you size people up because what goes through your eye gate it's in your heart don't plant any bad seed cause you don't want to reap any bad sin think about how you've lived this morning or how you've lived so far today think about it if there's anything that you've done that you think god is displeased with you can cover it with the blood of jesus you can cover it if you sow a bad crop you can stop it i love all of you god loves you he's the king of king and the lord of lords he's the creator of heaven and earth in every good thing he created you he's called you he chose you he saved you and i hope you're filled with the holy ghost but you're here for a reason let god use you love one another is the greatest thing worship worship does away with a lot of sin worship god he deserves it hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] making him as pure as pure can be [Music] then the voice of god said who go for us then he answered here am i send me speak my lord speak my lord [Music] speak and i'll be quick to answer thee [Music] speak my lord [Music] speak my lord speak and i will answer lord said sing the course again speak my lord speak my lord speak and i'll be quick to answer thee speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will answer lord send me hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah [Music] okay all right speak my lord [Music] speak and i will answer lord send me once again speak my lord speak my lord speak and [Music] [Music] speak my lord speak and i will answer lord [Music] when jesus was walking the face of the earth he told us that he did nothing until he first saw the father or heard the father saying it and if we will hear the voice of the lord before we speak the seeds that go into the ground [Music] will be the seeds of destiny the seeds of the voice of god working in the earth being planted we'll be planting his garden you want to talk about a garden of delight when we speak the words of the father that will be a garden of his delight growing up into a beautiful harvest if you can you can find your seats i'm trying to feel my way through here [Music] i'm going to ask shoshanna to come and sing and i know brother austin sister anna also have a song for the sake of time i'm going to receive the morning tithe and offering asking the lord to bless you as you give of your tithe and your offering unto the lord continuing to worship and let the spirit of the living god work among us and continuing to hear him as he would speak to us in in

the tithe and offering as shoshanna sings today hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus i haven't known bless you lord i haven't known where to put this testimony i haven't known where to share it i

independent person i don't like to ask for help i don't like to be weak i don't like to be vulnerable i don't like to let people in too far because i keep getting hurt because we're people and for four years we just had our fourth anniversary for four years i've been trying to find my place in this body and to some extent i hadn't found it but through the pregnancy and all the complications and through the labor and the birth and the past six weeks you all have been such i don't even know how to put it into words but i finally told my husband a few months ago i said i feel like i've finally come home i wanted to be in church so bad i felt so so inadequate because i wasn't able to make it to service needing so much help with the baby i've just i've been like lord i need you yes and i realized the other night laying in bed that if he hadn't made her the way you made her i wouldn't have needed you the way i've needed to and i wouldn't have been forced to say please help me over and over and over and over the nights the screaming and the baby being in pain and i haven't been able to help her ever heard this song over and over and over and the other night i had a dream i'd come into church i just wanted to come to church and the lord said you need to sing i wasn't going to do it this morning because i didn't feel led and sister flo said if you feel like to say something say it and he started singing that song that through my high school years that was that was my life verse send me lord yes so this is my testimony thank you jesus [Music] [Music] even though my spirit is low and it seems i can't hardly go but still i see a victorian [Music] many times i'm walking by blind faith cannot see what even lies me for [Music] you [Music] you may [Music] [Applause] [Music] sometimes the battle gets so hot and it seems like we're fighting a lot but still [Music] we're standing on the right [Music] i already know [Music] because i am [Music] but you've already lost this battle tonight remember can't cross the bloodline sometimes the battles get so hot and it seems like we're fighting a lot [Music] just give up [Music] you can't [Music] [Music] but you've is and you

now in verse 16. all right and not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification let's read on for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ one man's offense changed the world and one man's righteous sacrifice redeemed the world aren't we blessed to know that this morning therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous how many of you are partakers of the righteousness of god today right now you are partaking of his righteousness you are covered by the righteousness of the lord jesus christ let me see your witness amen god bless you as you are seated in the message the manifestation of the spirit in toledo ohio well let's not go there just yet let let me go back just a bit i think that we read several of these scriptures quotes and scriptures last sunday but i want to go to the breach if you can find that one for me uh paragraph 116. let's look at that before we get started good this morning we understand that adam held the title deed of planet earth it was entrusted to him in the garden he was given the authority to by the spoken word he was able to rearrange and have dominion over the entire earth is that right and last sunday we talked about how when if if there was a tree if if mrs adam or eve if she needed a tree moved or something made a little different in her back garden near the terrace adam didn't have to use the sweat of his brow originally to do that he could just do it by the spoken word he could just say tree be moved over here and the tree just picked itself up and moved somebody said that sounds like fantasy oh you've never lived in an earth that was controlled by the spoken word you and i have no way unless we we see it somehow like a cartoon or some animated adventure the only way we can even get our minds around the authority and the dominion that adam had in the earth we have to really use our imagination to even get to that place can you say amen everybody looking this way now we're going to pull together because we want to go somewhere in paragraph 116 he said now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god when adam took upon himself the sin of his wife eve adam not being deceived the bible tells us but he being a type of the christ that was to come the scripture said she did give to adam and he did eat also with eyes wide open knowing that this would be a way of taking her sin unto himself in that wonderful now he partook of sin he was pointing to another adam he was pointing to an ultimate redeemer that was to come but in that fall he lost possession of the title deed it left him and as brother branham is telling us here it went back into the hands of the original owner and who is that almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands oh i'm so thankful for that that satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner god himself hallelujah he said now we're going to find it just in a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed brother branham gets excited he claps his hands oh that makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life the abstract titled deed to eternal life when adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty god he said what a great thing now in the message when their eyes were opened in spindale paragraph 17 he goes on to say now i don't mean that he made one atonement for your sickness and one for your sins this is a powerful thing to note he didn't pay one price for healing and another price for redemption the healing of you of your body is a part of the one atonement hallelujah so the striping of his back and the shedding of his blood was sufficient enough to be bring both healing to your body and deliverance to your inner man oh what a good job he has done on our behalf he made one atonement and that was for sin and when you deal with sin you've got to deal with help me every attribute of sin now you now know what sickness is you might not have known it when you woke up this morning under the curse feeling some of that that hardship in your body you may not have understood that that is an attribute of sin but i've got good news for you today hallelujah the atonement is still in place the prize has still been paid the same blood that saves you can also bring healing and deliverance to your body somebody ought to give the lord a praise with me right now we're covered [Applause] it's sufficient to pay the price it he had a sacrifice in the atonement that deals with every attribute of sin he goes on to say the human race as we're taught in the scripture didn't have any sickness before sin came in my adam and eve would have lived in a body that would have never worn out that wasn't god's plan he just wanted to dangle that just a little bit so you and i could see what it can be what it will be what it is restored he said they didn't have any sickness before sin came in and when sin came in sickness was issued in as a attribute of sin which had to bring death because sickness leads to death death follows sickness he said sin is now that's why we can say from the message that there is no death in jesus christ none we don't die the saints of god don't die they just lay down this old house and they go right into the eternals right into the eternities hallelujah because death is is sin and sin is death and sickness follows sin uh what does this say here worry worry follows unbelief amen worry follows sin how many of you have a worry not a worry not a care because i know whose care i'm in but worries will creep in they slither in the enemy wants to bind us up in worrying about things that we cannot change anyway only sovereign god can make a difference and as we said tuesday night i think it was we worry maybe sunday we worry about things and most of the things that we so worry about never come to pass in the first place so we're burning up all this energy using up all these brain cells with what-ifs could'ves should'ves and would'ves and all this thing that the enemy uses to try to oppress us sin is death and sickness follows sin and worry follows sin did you ever notice what a horrible thing worry is and listen how he ends this sentence there's not one value in it at all you can't change one spot on the leopard you can add one cubit to your stature you can't change any circumstance of life with worry but how many of you know you can with faith you can with faith now i want to go to the manifestation of the spirit paragraph 17 and i'm doing this because i want you to see that adam has forfeited the title deed of the earth and in that title deed it lays the plan of all redemption now it goes back into the hands of the original owner but mankind is still lost he gave up he forfeited what he had now death has entered in by sin and there is no salvation to be found anywhere until the last adam comes and when the last adam came blessed be his holy name he took care of the sin problem i want to say this to you your sin problem has been taken care of it's done it's finished you've got to stay in fellowship now i knew that we would have to go a little slower this morning because we're tying together some things that we've just been hitting at over the last few services so thank you for staying with me because it helps us to be able to get through that i put too much work in this to just put it in the file i want to get it out there i want you to hear it i want you to get it in your spirit i want you to be reminded today of who you are and what you hold in your hand now in paragraph 17 he said now when jesus died at calvary look what he did he settled the sin question forever before the father you know these silly trinitarians silly people sometimes try to get me to believe or listen or follow some of these different things pass it ons and videos and clips and things that people pass on and sometimes i'm inspired but i can't get over the fact that if you don't know who god is how can i drink it your fountain right if you don't even know who he is i hear them trying to describe him and they say things like this the father is angry with you he's got white hair he's the judge he's got a gavel and he is ready to deal with the sin issue well i want to tell you something the sin issue has already been dealt with your father is no longer upset he's no longer angry because the price has been paid and jesus is the nice one father is the angry one the one who wants he wants judgment and justice and whatever else he can get and jesus is the sweet one and people say i have to pray to jesus because he's he's the sweet one somebody's very very very very confused hallelujah there would be no jesus had it not been for a loving father because god eternal he was loving you before the world was ever framed it was your father who had you in his mind before the foundation of the world and he said i have to go down and deal with this sin issue and so he came down in the form of a man the lord jesus christ brother branham tells us here now when jesus died at calvary he settled the sin question forever before the father because he was a you read it i don't know that don't always bother me but this morning it felt like a rattlesnake around my neck i'm getting rid of it for this morning is that all right because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin oh listen he was our whoo he had to be one of us god had to be one of us before he could pay the price for us so he came to be a kinsmen redeemer he said you bible scholars know what i'm talking about or speaking of like boaz he had to be a kinsmen redeemer to redeem the lost estate of ruth and remember that it was from it was from this connection that our lord has come to us this was not just a bible story but it's part of your story hallelujah naomi followed her husband and with her sons and went into a strange land because there had been some famine going on and they went out a little ahead of time you know had a good desire it was a noble thing that they wanted to do in taking care of their family but but they left they they left behind where god had promised to do some mighty things on their behalf they ended up naomi ended up losing her husband and both of her sons and decided i'll go back and throw myself upon the mercy of my own people and see if they will take me in she had two daughter-in-laws one was orpah i sometimes call her oprah orpah and naomi no ruth two daughter-in-laws miss orpah she she was affectionate she kissed and turned back she kind of represents a fling that's all some people want with jesus it's a little rendezvous just give me a little fling and make me feel good she kissed and she went back but there was one who wasn't just a kisser ruth said i'm a cleaner i don't care where you go i'm going with you i don't care what you believe i'll believe it too your god will be my god your people will be my people i'm not just going to kiss and turn back but i'm going to hold on do you know why because ruth had a destiny promise that she didn't even know anything about she didn't know why she couldn't turn naomi loose she didn't understand what was waiting for her back in the land that god had given to his people she just knew i have to go i don't know what it's going to look like when i get there but i know i have to go there may be no house there may be no food i can't guarantee what it'll be like but i cannot let her go by herself i must go with her and whatever befalls her will befall me come on now a gentile a gentile grabbing a hold of a jew and saying wherever you go whithersoever thou goest i will go and where you lodge i will lodge your people will be my your god will be my whoo thank you lord thank you lord for using the thank you for using the gentile too thank you for having a plan oh for the nations i know that you loved and honored and favored israel above them all but thank you that you didn't leave the nations out for from our mother the king came a gentile a moabitish woman from the other side listen when i'm in the dead sea i like to go to the dead sea i like to float in the dead sea and when i'm in the dead sea i look across there to those brown hills that come right down to the edge of the other side of the dead sea and i realize that i'm looking into the nation of jordan which is the land of moab and i've never lay there on that water but and looked over over into moab modern day jordan but what i thought about the dedication that it took for ruth to say wherever you go i'm going with you and she gets over here things are old i don't know maybe they found the old ranch sacked house where they where naomi had lived and began to try to put life back together i just love it not in my notes this morning but i love it anyway oh and naomi's just waiting on ruth she's just waiting on her to get ready she oh she's already caught a glimpse let me tell you something naomi was a righteous woman she was a woman who had some intuition by the spirit and she was already catching the picture she said i'll tell you what you do you wait until the evening you wait until the threshers are resting there by the grain that they have cut down in the day and and you'll find even the master of the harvest you'll even find boy first of all boaz sees them out there gleaning in the fields which was a biblical order according to the old testament but but boaz he wasn't satisfied with just ordinary protocol because he saw that one of those gleaners was more beautiful than all the rest he said i don't know if you fellers have noticed or not but that one over there is a knockout she nearly knocks my socks off and if you don't mind i'd like for you to leave a little extra if you're from alabama you might say extre leave a little extra in the edges of the field so that when they go in hand fulls on purpose it reminds me of those eagles that make it out of their moping period and they get all the way back to the top and their strength is renewed and they rejoice that their strength and youth has been renewed and the first thing they do is they go down and find a kill they find an animal somewhere and they kill that animal and they rip it apart and they fly back over that valley dropping fresh meat handfuls on purpose for those that are trying to start their journey back to the rock from where they were born and so she gathers this extra mother just filling up the house with all these handfuls on purpose and uh naomi's watching this oh they're sitting down for a good cup of tea in the evening and and uh ruth said to naomi mother he said mother i know bless be the memory of your dear son and his brother and his father blessed be his memory but i'm wondering mother did you notice the way that your kin was looking at me today in the field oh she said yes i noticed her smile took all the worry that ruth had ruth was sitting there thinking how am i going to broach the subject how am i going to tell my widowed mother in law that i also the widow of her son have found an attraction but when naomi laughed the laugh of a mother all the worry just melted off of she said yes i've noticed and i'll tell you what you do you wait until the harvesters are resting and and the lord of the harvest will be there as well and i want you to slip in very very quietly i want you to raise the skirt of his garment and i want you to lay as close to his feet as you possibly can now we know from bible times that a person's feet represents their nakedness it represents who they are in vulnerability there was nothing sexual in this event at all she just just raised up the borders of his garment maybe something covering him just raised it up a little bit and i want you to know she laid her cheek down on the ground and she just took her little delicate hand and she just laid it up there on his foot and when he woke up in the morning here is a beautiful maiden laying there with his with her hand on his foot and this was an obligation now i got to do something with this girl she's now in my care i didn't see it coming so quickly naomi must be working overtime oh yeah like sister whitaker when i was up there preaching in canada stacy wasn't serving the lord at that time but sister whitaker met me after the service and she had a had a a a picture album picture thing with a little you know how it comes down like a recording or something and she was showing me her daughter isn't she birdie she's not serving the lord right now pray for her matchmaker matchmaker see uh there was that was nowhere in my mind i doubt it was in her mind she just wanted to get a little prayer for her daughter who needed a good stirring in her life naomi was working overtime to try to bring this listen she was fighting this this goes so so deep it could go so long and i don't want it to go so long this morning but i want you to know she was fighting for destiny she wasn't just being a busybody she was looking for a seed she knew that her family was destined to be a part of something bigger than all that death and destruction and famine that had tried to wipe them out and so she began to try to arrange a certain way so that life could be different and i don't know maybe she knew there was a king maybe she knew there was a king coming i don't know she was perhaps a woman of intuition she began to realize that something was going on and now now boaz is obligated he's the he's not the nearest kin but the nearest kin didn't really want no part of this arrangement so he's the second nearest kin and he's willing to take on the responsibility and make her his now i want you to know that's redemption story right there most of all because she was a gentile that's what makes it so powerful and so precious is that he was willing to go against his own law she was not his kin she was married to his kin but for naomi he could step up and make her his and he did and there came an old bed there came a jesse there came a david and if you read the new testament there came a christ hallelujah through this glorious beautiful redemption of a kinsmen redeemer now where are we you bible scholars know what i'm speaking of like boaz had to be a kinsmen redeemer to redeem the lost estate of ruth and he had to make a public testimony and then everything that ruth had fell to him as he redeemed all of her possessions and he of course when he redeemed naomi he got ruthian which is a type of the gentile bride amen those who were not even a people are now a people of god how many of you got something to be thankful for which is a type of the gentile bride but he was a kinsmen redeemer now god who is in spirit unveiled himself in a body of flesh which was his son christ jesus and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself that's the godhead it's not an angry one and a happy one and an extra one just for fun hear oh israel the lord is one one spirit one eternal spirit in veiled himself in a body of flesh which was his son christ jesus and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and become kin folks to human beings to suffer the penalty that he had put on the human himself and he became kin folks you read the rest would you and a redeemer in other words like this i know you know this one i know you know this quote we was put in the devil's pawn shop the debt was owed you had a little bit of value not enough for the auction but enough for the pawn shop where people take their best junk the pawn shop and jesus walks in and pays the price and says to the devil you have no idea what's been sitting on your shelf all you saw was the dents and scratches all you saw was the warts and freckles you have no idea that that is the son of god that's been sitting there on your shelf and he is the most valuable thing in all of this pawn shop and today i'm making him mine and you never think of seeing him around here ever again we was put in the devil's pawn shop and jesus paid the price and brought us out just an old familiar relic on the auction block they decided to throw me away [Music] the auctioneer said who will take him the room was quiet and still then a stranger stepped forward and he said i will if you had known me before i knew him you'd understand why i love him if you had known me before i knew him you'd understand my love if you know it sing it if you had known me before i knew him you'd understand [Music] why i love him if you'd have known me before i knew him you'd understand my love [Music] who feels that way [Music] give him praise do it [Applause] now when jesus died at calvary he saved every sinner in the world or ever would be in the world as far as god was concerned how many of you know that's only part of the equation because the sinner has to make a choice and god already knew the sinner's choice but if you would have asked god if you could have had the privilege of interviewing god he would have said it is finished they're all saved they're all redeemed the prize has been paid for every one of them as far as god was concerned now you wasn't saved 10 years ago or two years ago or three years ago i wasn't saved 17 years ago i was saved 2 000 years ago but i accepted it 17 years ago he said now jesus didn't come down and die just for me or die just for you he settled the sin question but he'll never do us any good until we accept it it's your i want to know who accepts him this morning will you accept him as lord and savior and never turn your back from him ever again will you do that you watching this service right now will you with all the faith you have except him and his sacrifice on your behalf never to be lost again he said it's your accepting of him as your personal savior and it's by faith that you receive it and believe it he said in hebrews 3 1 the bible said that he's the high priest of our what what comes out of our mouth sister flo like you were prophesying exhorting us today now he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions for us you know he's only interceding on your confession oh yes he says it even plainer in other places he's only making intercession over what comes out of your mouth yes my my we covered that in the mind in the teaching the the the series on the mind where brother branham is very clear about our great intercessor the great high priest touched with the feeling of our infirmities whoever lives to make intercession for us brother branham said he's only the high priest of your confession so you better be careful my friend what you are confessing because that is what he bears before the father in your name so shauna was singing this morning about the battle the weariness of the battle and how that you get your eyes off of that and you begin to realize the authority that's been given to you by the atonement and here she is singing to us do what you got to do devil but you better know one thing you cannot cross this bloodline you see i can see the enemy on the other side of the bloodline [Music] growling at you mocking you harassing you but there's one thing for sure he cannot get any closer than the bloodline so you let the blood be your confession and you confess i'm on the inside i'm not on the outside where you are i'm on the inside sealed in here you remember the experience that i had many many many years ago where i was given caulking guns we were inside a house and the enemy was howling in the windows hideous faces hideous horrendous looking creatures and satan himself harassing and the door looked like the door was going to be knocked in and i was given these caulking guns and i looked down and somebody said well you know brother branham said there wasn't blood in a vision i'm not talking about your blood i'm not talking about my blood i'm talking about the blood of jesus christ and i've seen it more than once in a vision and i wouldn't dare back up on that not at all because he made it so real to me i saw the bloodbath on mount zion i saw that when the bride can't hardly go any higher you're going to receive a personal impartation we're going to understand the power that's in that blood in a way that we've never understood it before and begin to appropriate the life that is in that blood and overcome all things because of it you see we think we know all there is to know about the blood but god wants to make that so real to you and so personal to you a fresh revelation of that blood and i'm giving these caulking guns with the blood of jesus and we begin to seal the windows and go under the doors where you would normally block a draft and we are sealing under the doorway and the jam of the door we are sealing that up with the precious blood of jesus and you know what then we can just lay down and take a nap the blood doesn't cause him to quit roaring he will always roar he will always harass he will always lie and mock and try to distract you but what we do when we get a revelation of what the blood has accomplished on our behalf is we just take our rest it drives the devil insane did you know you can run him out of his head by just not listening to him anymore no fear no dread god's provided way of dealing with sin paragraph 38 and 39 are you still here oh it's just one o'clock we've got all day and i tell you jesus christ on calvary pulled the stinger out of death and sin amen and their sickness has no control anymore god's done suffered it in judgment anybody read that jesus took the stinger out of sin jesus took the stinger out of sickness jesus took the stinger off of satan he's a bee without a stinger so guess what he can do buzz [Music] hey buddy cannot sting you because jesus took out his bite jesus took out his sting sees as were you here tuesday night how many of you were here tuesday night how many of you heard the message from tuesday night you weren't here but you should hear it it was a rerun but you should go back and rerun it again you should hear it because it was fresh there was a fresh inspiration on it for the hour that we're living in right now i want you to know that old enemy is not a roaring lion he is like a roaring lion now i once heard them explain how how they deal with old lions brother aren't you from kenya he was if he would have been here tuesday night he would have been amending me but they tell me that that that these people who follow these lion prides around through the serengeti and all those different places they tell me that they have observed this from time to time that there will be an old daddy lion whose teeth are rotted out his voice is all gruff and he doesn't even have a uh a sharpness about him anymore his claws are are arthritic i guess and he couldn't take a little gazelle have you seen those little spring bucks you've seen those little antelope how fast they move you can't get an old lion who has trouble getting up in the morning you can't let him run out and chase the prey but he deserves to have a little bit of dignity i think and so they have found this several times in observing these lion prides there'll be a real alpha male who loses his alpha he's more like an alfalfa instead of an alpha you got the reference thank you and so so that he doesn't feel completely useless he goes up on a hill and the little young lions the ones that are agile and the ones that can catch the prey the young males they're down in the valley and when they see the herd of antelope passing through they let grandpa no teeth not much of a of a of a of claw but he still got a roar they let grandpa roar and oh the little spring buck and all the little antelope and gazelle whatever they are they all begin to do what run away from the roar and guess what happened the little young hunters the little young male hunting lions they're over there in the bush they're over there in the weed and so when those antelope when they run away from that roar the next thing you know they run right into the mouth of a hungry lion anybody follow my story i like my story you don't seem to be liking it like i like telling it so we have got to learn something we have to know the difference between the roar of the lion of judah and the roar of the imitator we've got to be able to discern the enemies will growl from the lion of the tribe of judah so that instead of running away from the buzzing of our enemy and running away from the hypocrite roar of our enemy we've got to run toward the roar did you know that if those little if those little bucks those little deer if they would just run toward the roar they'd overtake grandpa he couldn't gum him to death he's got to wait on the young ones to tear him a piece of something to eat they could run right past him and he might not be able to do one thing about it i want you to know your enemy has lost his teeth his stinger is gone all he's got left is his buzz or his roar depending on what analogy you're using here he said jesus took the stinger out of sin and tonight he's helpless hallelujah he can only bust and make a lot of fuss ezekiel joseph ezekiel ezekiel he can only bus and make a lot of fuss but read the rest he's got he's got no stinger jesus has taken care of him paul said oh death where is your sting grave where is your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen amen amen he pulled the stinger out 49 and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy of his enemy let's read this one he said then when he died down at the cross hell taken his precious soul the bible said his soul descended into hell that's exactly right hell captured his soul and took him down there anybody thought of it quite like that it's pretty interesting way of putting it isn't it but brother on that third day he possessed the gates of death hell and the grave and rose up the third day and overcame it all he took sickness death hell the grave and everything praise god praise god i believe he jerked the gate plum off the hinges he took them out rose on high ascended on high and tonight oh hallelujah hell i don't care i don't even care right now whether you feel like a conqueror or not because we are not talking about your feelings [Applause] we're not talking about a mama who's cried all night because of a crying baby that she can heal we're talking about a mama who can stand up here today and sing she might not have felt like a conqueror last night but when she was standing here this morning she was a conqueror it's not about our feelings it's about the truth of the word we are not just conquerors you want to hear that one i got another illustration i will use them all in one sermon i don't have many once upon a time there was a boxer and he loved the box and he had a wife that loved for him to box odd isn't it you think she'd cherish his brain cells but the problem was she cherished his paycheck i'm not going with you tonight honey but knock him out she goes upstairs in their beautiful home that knockout money has purchased she puts on fuzzy slippers silk pajamas nice chanel robe she crawls up in the middle of a big old king-sized bed she takes out the remote she flips on the television to get her a good view of her husband when he knocks out the enemy he goes over there he's trained for days and months he has trained so hard to keep up on his game to know uh what to do and he has to anticipate where the enemy is going to punch next so that he can figure out how to dodge and whiz and all the things they do to be able to win the victory and oh it gets serious in their blood flies spit goes out somebody's tooth lays over there in the ring you can see them how they do i've only seen one or two boxing matches in my life so i may not be doing it justice but there is really something to watch when they go they are striving for consciousness they are they know that there is a lot of money at stake some of them millions of dollars i guess lots of money anyway and uh she she she has her bowl of popcorn she's drinking sweet tea she's from the south she's drinking sweet tea she's eating her popcorn he is in the fight of his life he did not anticipate his enemy to be as strong as he is he has took some serious punches to the cheeks to the jaw to the forehead to the nose he is bleeding something happens and he turns on everything he's got and he lays his enemy right out on the mat cold why they could have counted to a hundred and he wouldn't budge they rush out onto that boxing ring and they hold up the hands of the champion they put on a robe around him you know uh float like a butterfly sting like a bee you didn't know i knew that did you look out i'm muhammad ali they celebrate his victory they bring out a check right out onto he wins let's just say 100 000 dollars earned every penny of it he goes in he showers he puts on his his casual jogging clothes or whatever and he gets in the limousine and drives home she has made her way out of bed now she's down at the door with his slippers or whatever she's going to welcome him you know and he opens she opens the door as the car pulls up he steps out upon to the porch she throws her arms around him and gives him a kiss and very quickly she says hand it over the big that he is he reaches down in his uh waistline and pulls out that check and hands it to her now listen folks that man fought a battle and won he is a conqueror the wife stayed home but she got the paycheck help me he fought the battle and won he's the mighty conqueror she stayed at home she still got the prize anybody here in my story if he was the conqueror what is she more than a conqueror he fought in one she stayed home she won anyway which where do you see you jesus said we're more the scripture we're more than a conqueror we've been made more than conquerors overcome in this life we've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of jesus christ we've been made more than conquerors we're overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ jesus went all the way to the cross and won the battle took the stinger out of death hell and the grave and hands you the prize here's the eternal life here's the pride here is the prize here is the prize you didn't have to go fight it all you had to do was receive it a b c accept it believe it anybody with me good glad to hear it and tonight you are more than conquerors his seed shall possess the gate gates of the enemy yes sir he possessed every gate he conquered every sickness he conquered every sin he conquered every temptation he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he possessed the gate of all of them and we in him are you don't need me to preach you preach more than conquerors hallelujah because he what oh we would never know what the true seed of abraham was what it really meant to us we wouldn't really understand it without this revelation god providing healing for this generation paragraph 29 the devil put us in the pawnshop but jesus redeemed us he's our kinsmen redeemer god made flesh kinfolks to us in order to redeem us from the curse of sin and sickness tonight has sent the holy spirit to dwell with the church and show signs and wonders of healing and salvation until he returns again are you still with me good i got two more i want to read but the first thing this is uh the breach between the church ages and the seals paragraph 301 and this is something you need to understand and get a hold of it today while we're here don't let this pass you by paragraph 301 of the breach but the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world so i would just like to humbly say that your salvation's price was paid and actuated in the earth around 2000 years ago but i would just like to humbly suggest to what he said in other places and that is that your redemption goes all the way back to the foundation of the world you didn't get saved 10 years ago your redemption was purchased for you before the worlds were ever framed when a lamb was slain in the mind of god aren't you glad for that understanding the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book glory he opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down this is it you're following the book yes where did it start it started in the hands of god who did god entrust it to adam what did adam do forfeited it where did it go back to the hands of the original owner but something has to happen because between revelation 5 and revelation 10 something has happened to the book in revelation 5 the book is still there sealed with seven seals in revelation 10 he comes down and what does he have in his hand a book that's no longer sealed that's why tabernacles is so precious to us because tabernacles is the feast of the open book this is the feast that celebrates the fact that the book is open and all who desire by god's elective can look in and see what john saw the revelation of their part of the redemptive plan of god he took the book glory opened the book and tore off the seals and what did you do with it now you're still following it right and sent it down to the earth now i know this will be a little chokey for some and he sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people amen now whether you're one of those who believes that brother branham was that seventh angel or whether you believe like i believe he was the messenger of that angel he was the earthly messenger of a heavenly angel somebody said why in the world would you say it like that because there are some other places there that you can't reconcile because that seventh angel is to be in the earth at the time of the second coming is that right amen so when when he has this glorious visitation of which we believe and wholeheartedly embrace that that what god had shown him previously it now begins to unfold in the arizona desert and he sees those little birds wait no they're not they're angels and he sees them coming in a constellation and they and they come right down to where he is standing and as he is looking on those angels a messenger you're with me is looking on those angels he sees them now i know there are some who say things like those were theophanies then the bible word is wrong the bible then the scripture is wrong because the bible didn't call them theophanies the bible calls them angels brother branham said an angel is a male messenger he says but the the truest definition of an angel is a messenger either of the earth or of the heavens we're just looking at it from the original language so here he stands a mouthpiece a prophet one who has the anointing and the call of the elijah spirit it's on him he is not elijah but the spirit and power of elijah has fallen on him amen and you know what i preach we need it to fall on us because it's a no compromise no nonsense anointing and we need a no compromise no nonsense anointing to overcome in satan's eden we need that i didn't mean to get into this but here he stands a messenger upon whom this the very uh and a a prophet of a of a biblical proportion because his ministry is prophesied about in the bible come on now i know when they're trying sometime to figure out who he is they say things like an old testament prophet then what is he doing in the new covenant it's really quiet i hear people saying things like he was a prophet of the old testament order then he came out of the covenant all you have to say is that he came with a ministry that was prophesied in scripture that makes him a biblical prophet it makes him a prophet with a biblical calling and commission it makes him more than a five-fold prophet of which there are still five full prophets in the earth in this hour as well as fivefold apostles pastors teachers and evangelists we need them all but they are not they don't have the same prophesied ministry that he had he is standing there looking at these angels and he says that one on my left did he say left or right i don't remember either meant more to me can we find that it escaped me i know that people watching this are saying it's this it's left it says right it's right left i thought it was that one on the left meant more to me can you give me the exact wording paragraph 275 of the fourth seal is that right no no seventh seal all right what does it say they were in a constellation be on a side and one on top one right next to me here counting from the left to the right would have been the seventh brighter meant more to me why because that was the angel that brother branham was representing on the earth now if you look that up in context with what we now know about the day this happened and the fact that the cloud was not even on the same day if you look that up then you'll come to the conclusion that brother greene came to when he said that brother branham told him that those angels lingered there in that desert and brother greene liked to point out the sighting of the russian cosmonauts who saw these angels and many felt like that they were catching a glimpse of this very very prophetic happening that had taken place there in that desert now why are you taking time to go into all of that because i believe it's very important to understand that the hand that the book went from the hand of god to the hand of adam to the hand of god to the hand of christ to the hand of a seventh angel give me the quote go back to where we were he took the book glory opened the book see he took the lamb so jesus had already done something with this book by the time it got to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people don't you ever be guilty of saying that brother branham opened the seals if he opened the seals the scriptures out of catered and we can't follow it anymore amen the lamb opened the seals brother branham was the one who caught the revelation of what was underneath those seals thank god he did thank god he did thank god that the seventh angel messenger caught the revelation and he began to do what to reveal it to that his is not a they didn't choose to put a small h which would mean a people of the angel they chose to put a capital h to his people now there is the there is the journey of the book anybody got it in your hand today you got it you got it let's do it again god the original gave it to adam adam forfeited it went back to the hands of the original owner the lamb took the book didn't it say the lamb took the book from him who sat on the throne john braced himself to see a lion but instead of a lion here came a bloody lamb the lamb took the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne which symbolizes the original owner and the lamb took the book and opened the seals thereof sent it down by the seventh angel revelation 10. sent it down open book seal's torn off and he sends that book down to the seventh angel messenger who has the revelation of what was underneath those seals we've studied them here before so that that truth may be revealed to the people and the reason why the bride had to have the revelation of what was underneath those seals is it was a transfer of authority amen amen sad come on you now have the authority that's been granted in the opening of those seals we are walking in that authority we may not be exercising it but we're walking in the potentials of it it's in us it's in us this is the whole journey you've got to take it all the way all the way you took the book let's go ahead and finish that one congregate oh my my my brother brandon i couldn't get mine to greatly rejoice this morning about it he said there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation can anybody read the brackets congregation continues to greatly rejoice because we now know who we are our destiny was revealed under those seals we had to know what this plan of redemption is all about total restoration that brings restitution all the way back and old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in the earth and everything in the sea heard him holler amen amen blessings honor and might and power be to him that lives forever and ever 303 talk about a happy time when those seals broke read it go back to revelation 5 read it all the way through 10. john must have looked in and seen a past the curtain of time and said there is john saw his name in the plan of redemption oh that god would anoint your eyes and my eyes today that we could look behind the veil and see our name written there in that plan of redemption brother if you could catch a revelation of that there's not enough demons in the underworld to talk you out of who you are in christ there's not a sickness broad enough there's not a trial hard enough to talk you out of who you are in christ once you know your name is there and brother you're looking at somebody who knows i know my name is there hallelujah i know i know my name is there the last one for this morning we're going to close just a tad earlier paragraph 99 of the easter seal he said they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickening how many of you have had a quickening in the word as you come to the first limb the second limb the third limb on up i hear the cathedral singing about the latter we're still moving up higher higher higher he said it just keeps quickening the spirit of god keeps quickening to you are you still here notice that pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received he said that makes me feel religious think now here was men fishermen tax collectors the humble little woman and just ordinary housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth they believed that when jesus died they believed on him and rose up again from the dead they believed that to be the absolutely testimony of god that he hath quickened him to life he said now they go up to the day of pentecost to receive their abstract do you know what an abstract is he said it's when a deed has been cleared oh my oh my oh my do you know you've got a free and clear title been cleared all the way back to adam he said and they become quickened or what a thrill they had bought the land been bought for them more than conquerors they had done what received it will you receive it will you receive it how many of you are with me all right now listen i came to you on resurrection sunday are you with me and and i give you a verse song of solomon i want to do it again song of solomon chapter 2 verse 10 through 12 my beloved spoke and said to me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land i brought you a quote do you remember from wade taylor let me explain this to you if you search the life of wade taylor you're going to find out that he had a fall you're going to find out that he made a grave mistake and it cost him something in his life and his ministry but god redeemed him all he had to do was come and say papa help me have mercy on me forgive me sinner saved by grace i didn't have to say that but i happen to know it i didn't mention it the other time i never got to meet wade taylor face to face but he reached out to me in email when when he had ran across some of my experiences in the spirit online he reached out to me and he said stephen i want to i want to hear more will you send me more and he actually had at his death about a 300-page document of of my experiences that i've had through the years in the spirit and from time to time he would come to one and he would write me and he would say i can't tell you how this ministered to me i can't tell you how this was on time for me as he began to write the books that he wrote i would think the last one was the secret of the stairs it was published in 2013. he passed away a few years after that but he was a human and he made mistakes you were here some of you were here when we had some other great speakers come through here from other realms from other other uh camps these were not perfect men some of them had fallen some of them had made big mistakes the one who was one of the most popular among them who has now gone to be with the lord he had some big falls big mistakes lost churches human beings sinners saved by grace let me tell you something you don't know how to fully appreciate the redemptive work of the cross until you need it i don't embrace jimmy swaggart's theology but i will tell you this he preaches the cross because if anybody publicly needed the cross he needed it nobody can sing the song like he can sing it let the blood of calvary speak for me let it write me down as righteous where no righteousness has been shielding me from wrath and judgment as it covers all my sin there is no good that i've accomplished nothing no deed that i've accomplished nothing good that i've done just let the blood of calvary speak for me so i honor that i respect the man's i i heard how they mocked it but it wasn't up to up to the church and it wasn't up to the media it was up to god and if god hasn't accepted his repentance it's not too late there's still breath in his body so if i wanted to mention jimmy swaggart in the pulpit it's none of anybody's business because if you want me to get personal i can name preachers among us i know message preachers that had affairs on their wives children out of wedlock i know them sons raised by women grown now probably my age sons but if they have come to god fully repented then i receive this great grace for myself and i can honor that they believe that god has forgiven them and given them mercy it may dictate their future in ministry because i do not believe in double married preachers in the pulpit i do not believe in that it may change the course of their ministry but they can be right with god if they've made it right so i quoted from my from my from from a mentor a precious man the bride has made a major breakthrough the winter is past and the flowers are beginning to appear a spiritual winter is a time in which the lord is seemingly absent and we feel little or no quickening presence the primary purpose of a winter season is to cause us to seek something further rather than remaining content with our past spiritual accomplishments he said during this time of winter we may not be aware that the lord is patiently waiting without but actively looking within oh church hear me now i need you that is so precious to me and then i quoted c.s lewis wrong will be right when aslan comes in sight at the sound of his roar sorrows will be no more when he bears his teeth winter meets its death and when he shakes his mane we shall have spring again now let me give you this disclaimer because i don't ever intend to ever do it again so you listen carefully brother branham told us that martin luther was a church age messenger to his day and god gave him the revelation the just shall live by faith martin luther was baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost martin luther was a beer drinker and martin luther believed that all jews should be damned for their part in the crucifixion of jesus christ his direct words are all christ haters be damned and he speaks about the jews and their role in the crucifixion of jesus christ which was certainly a part of even catholic theology in those days that they had forfeited their opportunity for deliverance we all know better so when we preach about martin luther we're not preaching about his messes or his misses we're not telling you that everything that come out of his mouth was theologically sound hey i gotta tell you a secret i've said some pretty stupid things before i i've said some pretty dumb things up here that had to backpedal straighten out correct a little bit anybody understand how that works so make sure that everybody under the sound of my voice knows because there was a big misunderstanding with some i am not here to raise up the life of c.s lewis i just know how god used certain things that he did said film that was made to do something really powerful for me if there's one thing i hate look at me i cannot stand a religious spirit and i ought to be an expert on on them because i had one for a long time and if you've been under the influence of a religious spirit you're you ought to have a little a little bit of uh history here to help you find one now i don't like how the enemy twists things and takes something that god was inspiring and doing and twist that so it's been told that i was up here quoting from a witchcraft book and little kids have told little kids in our church that i was up here preaching from a witchcraft book well i want you to know that's a lie i want you to know i don't agree with a lot of c.s lewis's theology or all of his analogies but all i know is if we can't let somebody say something good and celebrate the good so they sent me a video of of this guy who was who was preaching or teaching or railing really it was railing with a religious spirit and that's what i said to the person who i finally got it traced it down to where it come from i said this man is so religious this is the very kind of person who would be doing the same videos against brother branham now don't expect me to sit here and listen to this guy talk about something i tr i even took some of the quotes and checked them out and found yes indeed some of the things he said were said but we ought to give somebody the right of context amen you should at least read the context of where that was said how many of you know you can take things well so i have decided to move in an opposite spirit of that religious spirit and i've decided today to play you a clip because i want you not to miss the inspiration of this moment he took me and let me see in a dream a frozen moment in our lives a dark death-filled winter and under the fire of the breath of jesus christ in this experience i saw him breathing and we were unfrozen and let me tell you something this may gross you out then we begin to breathe on others and they begin to get unstuck remember what the bible said jesus breathed on the ummah they have lots to say about benny hen because he used to breathe on people i try to use breath mints but on occasion if you've been around long enough you've seen me lean in not make something big to do like benny hen would do but you've seen me lean in on people too and go well i don't get that let me tell you something if we all ministered the same and flowed the same and worship as i i caught myself in circles today i caught myself moving in circles and i didn't even realize i was moving in circles until i realized everything was moving i'm not going to apologize for the way the spirit moves on me i was born an intercessor who happens to be a preacher with some other callings in my life but the highest honor that i have in the kingdom is that he made me an intercessor to pray to release to bind what needs to be bound and loose what needs to be loose so i see some frozen people in my life stuck they don't want to be stuck but they are and they need to be set free nobody minded when i played the clip of the kendrick brothers in the movies that they make they're trinitarians as far as i know but i respect what they have done nobody's bothered by that so you really shouldn't get in such a wad and you that has video games in snapchat [Music] all that stuff that disney's cranking out now please let's not be religiously fanatic let me tell you something i was just recently playing with children's toys and i found myself talking to little children luke i hope i made some questions for you to have to answer because i did not even think about it it it never really crossed my mind what i was saying to these children but but i was explaining to to them that i have seen this in the spirit not in the natural but in the spirit realm i fought this and it was a pterodactyl which is a it's a the image that we have of a dinosaur bird and in the natural i'm not saying that that represents anything evil but in the spiritual it almost cost me my life i know this is over some of your pay grade so that is startling to me but i understand that in the natural it's one thing in the spiritual it represented another i have dealt in deliverance with spirits that live on land and that live on sea demons that that work in the land and demons that work beneath this water and i have stories to tell that can't really be told so just remember that there are times that things remind you and and and you hear sounds that remind you of wars that you fought in the spiritual realm and it's very very real to me and i tried to teach my children that these things were real how many of you know i did because they're over there telling the neighbor last night my daddy wrestled the devil to the ground and killed him in the hallway and the neighbor says well that would ruin your night because we talked about those things as though they were because they are so this scene had such an impact on me that i want to share it with you and don't mind me if you see me watching your face cause i want to see what we can stir up i've showed a mel gibson clip and it wasn't from the passion of christ it was from one of the greatest movies of all times and i'm not a big movie watcher and someone sent me someone who quoted this sister kathy sent me something just recently when we were having such a cry here in the spirit she said it reminded her of that scene with the flash freedom you just take it and take it and take it till you can't take it no more and you rise out and say enough it's enough is it now is it now [Applause] i don't want to die in the winter i want to see my springtime [Music]
