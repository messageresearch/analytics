[0:06] if you don't fight for your beans the
[0:10] devil will take your taco your burrito
[0:13] and your whole enchilada
[0:16] if we don't fight for what we have for
[0:19] what God has given us the devil will
[0:22] take it and he will never give it back
[0:25] until somebody dares to face him nose to
[0:29] nose and say devil give it back in the
[0:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ every
[0:36] person here has an enemy and it's not so
[0:40] much that you are his enemy but the Word
[0:42] of God that is in you is his enemy he is
[0:46] the enemy of God therefore he is an
[0:50] enemy of God's Word and the Word of God
[0:53] that is in you must come to fruition it
[0:57] has to come to maturity and expression
[1:01] and Satan opposes that so he steals it
[1:05] one beam at a time until there's no
[1:08] burrito left he doesn't just come in and
[1:12] snatch the whole thing all at one time
[1:15] because you would catch him and he knows
[1:18] that if you catch him he's really in
[1:21] trouble and here is something to
[1:23] remember you must never abandon your
[1:27] seed you cannot run off and leave it to
[1:33] grow on its own
[1:35] you cannot depend on someone who loves
[1:39] you to take care of your seed it's yours
[1:46] it is very very very personal you are
[1:52] represented in the seed that you sow I'm
[1:57] not just talking about the male seed of
[2:00] sperm either I'm talking about your gift
[2:02] your talent your time your finance you
[2:09] are represented in that seed so don't
[2:12] you get tired of waiting and walk off
[2:14] and holler to somebody else tend my
[2:17] garden it's your seed you are
[2:21] represented in that seed that you sowed
[2:24] and you've got to stay there and watch
[2:27] that seed
[2:28] if you can't war over the seed you've
[2:30] already planted you'll stop planting
[2:32] eventually it'll mean nothing to you
[2:36] being faithful to God's house will mean
[2:39] nothing to you being faithful in your
[2:41] giving will mean nothing to you having a
[2:45] right attitude and a right spirit when
[2:47] you come will mean nothing to you
[2:51] because the enemy has shut down with his
[2:55] with his crows he has shut down your
[2:59] your ability to see above and beyond
[3:03] your present circumstances I want you to
[3:07] know that a man who cannot see beyond
[3:09] today with hope and promise for the
[3:13] future is already dead he's a dead man
[3:18] walking he has no purpose for living if
[3:22] a man is convinced that he no longer has
[3:25] a seed to sow he has no reason to go on
[3:29] so you've got to take that back you've
[3:31] got to tell the devil he's a liar you've
[3:34] got to tell him God would leave you here
[3:36] one hour beyond your appointed time on
[3:38] this earth and if you're still kicking
[3:41] and breathing and moving and groaning
[3:44] you've still got a seed - so you still
[3:49] have value to release
[3:52] [Music]
