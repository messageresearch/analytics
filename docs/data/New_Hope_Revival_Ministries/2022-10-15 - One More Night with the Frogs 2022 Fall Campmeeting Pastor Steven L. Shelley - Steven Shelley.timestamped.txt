[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:03] Exodus chapter 8 and verse 1 and the
[1:11:07] Lord spake unto Moses
[1:11:10] going to pharaoh and say unto him
[1:11:16] saith the Lord
[1:11:19] let
[1:11:22] go
[1:11:24] that they may serve me
[1:11:28] you see God was jealous
[1:11:31] over his children
[1:11:33] he wanted them to be free to worship Him
[1:11:39] so he said you go to pharaoh and tell
[1:11:43] him thus saith the Lord let my people go
[1:11:49] that they may serve me and if thou
[1:11:53] refuse to let them go behold I will
[1:11:56] Smite all thy borders with frogs
[1:12:01] the river shall bring forth frogs
[1:12:04] abundantly
[1:12:07] which shall go up and come into thine
[1:12:09] house and into thy bed chamber and upon
[1:12:13] thy bed
[1:12:14] and into the house of thy servants
[1:12:17] and upon thy people and into thy ovens
[1:12:21] and into thy needing troughs
[1:12:25] and the Frog shall come up both on thee
[1:12:29] and upon thy people and upon all thy
[1:12:33] servants the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:12:37] say unto Aaron
[1:12:38] stretch forth thine hand with thy rod
[1:12:42] over the streams over the rivers over
[1:12:46] the ponds and cause frogs to come up
[1:12:50] upon the land of Egypt and Aaron
[1:12:54] stretched out his hand over the Waters
[1:12:58] of Egypt and the frogs came up and
[1:13:02] covered the land of Egypt and The
[1:13:07] Magicians did so with their enchantments
[1:13:10] and brought up frogs upon the land of
[1:13:15] Egypt may God add his Blessing to the
[1:13:18] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:13:19] this evening
[1:13:21] we go on to verse 8.
[1:13:24] then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron
[1:13:28] and said
[1:13:30] entreat the Lord
[1:13:33] that he may take away the frogs from me
[1:13:37] from my people
[1:13:39] I will let the people go that they may
[1:13:42] do sacrifice unto the Lord
[1:13:45] Moses said unto Pharaoh Glory over me
[1:13:49] when shall I entreat for thee for thy
[1:13:54] servants for thy people to destroy the
[1:13:58] frogs from thee and the houses that they
[1:14:02] may remain in the river only that's
[1:14:05] where I want them to be in the river
[1:14:07] I I want you to listen at this crazy
[1:14:10] answer
[1:14:14] it's a mystery
[1:14:18] why in the world would he go to all the
[1:14:21] trouble of calling up the prophets to
[1:14:22] get some help
[1:14:27] and then say uh well when would you like
[1:14:29] to get this help oh let me think about
[1:14:31] it a little bit
[1:14:33] all the time croak
[1:14:36] I know I don't make a good frog sound
[1:14:38] can anybody help me
[1:14:41] I can always depend on brother Daniel
[1:14:48] you do it one do it one more time
[1:14:54] I I'll just say croak
[1:14:56] my frogs speak English all right
[1:14:59] they just say crow all the time Croke
[1:15:03] Crow car
[1:15:05] is that Bender yeah
[1:15:08] that sounds like a goose or something
[1:15:10] don't it
[1:15:12] all the time and they're everywhere
[1:15:15] that they're hopping around him
[1:15:18] all around him and everywhere he looks
[1:15:21] the floor is just covered the land is
[1:15:23] completely covered with frogs and he has
[1:15:26] an opportunity to do something about it
[1:15:30] and for some strange reason he said oh
[1:15:34] let's see uh what about tomorrow
[1:15:39] it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[1:15:40] does it are you with me tonight
[1:15:43] and Moses said all right
[1:15:46] we can handle that be it according to
[1:15:49] Thy Word
[1:15:51] not one minute earlier
[1:15:54] not one minute later
[1:15:56] exactly as you have said it it will be
[1:16:00] that thou mayest know that there is none
[1:16:04] like unto the Lord our God
[1:16:09] he goes on here for just a few more
[1:16:11] verses
[1:16:13] that thou mayest know will stop there
[1:16:15] that thou mayest know that there is none
[1:16:19] like unto the Lord Our God now we have
[1:16:22] studied together about the plagues of
[1:16:25] Egypt and this is not Passover time but
[1:16:28] we will talk for just a moment about one
[1:16:32] particular plague and it's important to
[1:16:35] know that these were not just random
[1:16:38] things that God was doing there in Egypt
[1:16:42] every one of those plagues represented a
[1:16:46] God that was worshiped in Egypt they
[1:16:50] even worshiped the river and so when the
[1:16:53] river turned to blood that sturdum that
[1:16:56] caused them to be alarmed and and the
[1:16:58] LIE send them your Reign on the cattle
[1:17:00] and and all the hail and all the
[1:17:03] different plagues every one of them God
[1:17:06] was saying there there's a God bigger
[1:17:08] than your pretend Gods I want to remind
[1:17:11] you tonight that among the Gods there's
[1:17:14] one God who is Alive forevermore and I
[1:17:19] want to remind you that Jehovah of the
[1:17:21] Old Testament is Jesus of the New
[1:17:24] Testament
[1:17:26] that they're not two gods they're
[1:17:28] certainly not three Gods hear o Israel
[1:17:32] the Lord thy God is one
[1:17:36] the Bible said there are three that bear
[1:17:39] record in heaven the Father the word and
[1:17:41] the spirit and these three are
[1:17:45] one
[1:17:46] so it seems that while the church
[1:17:49] emphasizes that God is three the word is
[1:17:53] emphasizing that God is one
[1:17:56] well you've got a choice will you stick
[1:17:58] with your church or will you stick with
[1:18:00] the word
[1:18:03] I don't know about you but I'm going to
[1:18:05] take my stand with the word of God he's
[1:18:07] one
[1:18:09] one and he's able to do whatever we need
[1:18:12] him to do tonight
[1:18:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:18:18] today and forever he changes not if he
[1:18:23] ever delivered an addict he's still a
[1:18:25] deliverer
[1:18:27] if he ever healed the sick
[1:18:29] still a Healer so among all of those
[1:18:32] things those idols
[1:18:35] those you know Fables
[1:18:38] that men may call gods
[1:18:41] there is only one true Living God David
[1:18:46] expressed it this way in a pagan land he
[1:18:48] said among the gods
[1:18:50] there is no God like unto our god he's a
[1:18:55] he's above them all and I want you to
[1:18:57] know he's a jealous God
[1:18:59] he's a particular God and he wants our
[1:19:03] affection and our attention to be
[1:19:05] focused on him he's not looking for
[1:19:08] those who will serve him on Sunday
[1:19:11] he's looking for those that desire a
[1:19:14] relationship with him that's 24 hours a
[1:19:17] day seven days a week and he walks with
[1:19:19] me and he talks with me and he tells me
[1:19:23] that I am his own he's looking for
[1:19:26] Fellowship
[1:19:27] he's looking for relationship if you
[1:19:30] believe that
[1:19:32] you can give a witness here by saying
[1:19:34] amen so so we know that that the
[1:19:37] children of Israel they ended up in this
[1:19:40] whole mess because of their Rebellion
[1:19:43] because they wouldn't listen to God the
[1:19:45] way they needed to listen to God and so
[1:19:47] they ended up in slavery in Egypt and
[1:19:50] you know it was hard and if any of you
[1:19:52] have ever seen the Ten Commandments
[1:19:55] I CeCe will be the meal you you know
[1:19:57] it's a it's an amazing depictment of
[1:20:00] what what it might have looked like what
[1:20:03] we read in the scripture and I don't
[1:20:05] know if they've ever made a better
[1:20:06] depiction of of that story than than the
[1:20:10] historical film that we have uh the Ten
[1:20:13] Commandments and I don't know if there's
[1:20:17] ever been a Moses
[1:20:19] like Charlton Heston
[1:20:24] I I said that one time I I have a
[1:20:28] picture in in my
[1:20:32] in my uh of Charlton Heston as Moses
[1:20:36] and he's got his arms stretched out over
[1:20:38] me while I'm getting ready every day
[1:20:41] and and my my son saw it one day and he
[1:20:43] said Dad do you have a man crush on
[1:20:46] Charlton Heston I said I certainly do
[1:20:49] not
[1:20:51] but I think he did the best job at Moses
[1:20:53] that I've ever seen
[1:20:55] and when I meet Moses I'm going to tell
[1:20:57] him
[1:21:04] God allowed his people to go into this
[1:21:08] kind of of slavery because he wanted to
[1:21:10] work some things out of them
[1:21:12] and I will take the time tonight I I
[1:21:16] could actually just turn this part over
[1:21:17] to brother greedy and he could go
[1:21:19] through I'm telling you I've been so
[1:21:21] blessed as he went through detail after
[1:21:23] detail after detail this week giving us
[1:21:27] the reality of the of the story and the
[1:21:29] back story and the middle part of the
[1:21:32] story and the end of the story and and
[1:21:34] I'd like to do the same tonight but but
[1:21:36] it would take me way too long because I
[1:21:39] have some things that I have to say and
[1:21:41] I want to get them out so I'm just
[1:21:43] assuming that that you've read it in the
[1:21:46] Bible or you've watched it on film and
[1:21:48] you have some understanding that this
[1:21:51] was a horrible time and God was tired of
[1:21:54] his people not being able to worship Him
[1:21:56] He allowed them to go into this place of
[1:21:59] slavery their own Rebellion made them
[1:22:01] slaves in Egypt but it was time for a
[1:22:04] deliverer to come Hallelujah I'm glad
[1:22:07] that a Moses showed up
[1:22:09] I'm glad that God had a Moses that he'd
[1:22:12] been training and preserving for such a
[1:22:15] time as this
[1:22:16] you know he could have been crocodile
[1:22:18] food
[1:22:20] yeah because the Pharaoh was killing all
[1:22:22] the firstborn of the males of Israel and
[1:22:25] you know his mother
[1:22:27] she had this idea she said oh we got to
[1:22:30] do something we we can't just let Moses
[1:22:32] be cured on by precious boy with it
[1:22:35] wasn't Called Moses then but we can't
[1:22:37] let him be killed we've got to preserve
[1:22:39] him and she had this idea we'll make a
[1:22:41] little basket weave a little basket and
[1:22:43] we'll pitch it with tar and I'll lay the
[1:22:46] baby in that basket and I'll set it in
[1:22:48] that old Nile River and we will depend
[1:22:51] that the god of Israel will preserve his
[1:22:53] life
[1:22:54] if you've never heard brother Branham
[1:22:56] preach on the story of Moses you should
[1:22:58] hear him dramatize that story if I had
[1:23:02] time I'd play you a little portion of it
[1:23:04] because it really makes it live I want
[1:23:08] you to see the Nile River and all of the
[1:23:11] dangers of the Nile River we are told
[1:23:14] that there were whirlpools in the river
[1:23:16] that could have easily taken that little
[1:23:19] basket down to the bottom of the river
[1:23:21] and drown that little baby but God had a
[1:23:24] destiny
[1:23:26] he had a plan for Moses life
[1:23:29] and he wasn't going to let no Whirlpool
[1:23:31] take him out of God's plan I want you to
[1:23:34] know tonight God has a plan
[1:23:38] he has a destiny he has a purpose for
[1:23:43] your life
[1:23:45] and if you're wasting your life now you
[1:23:48] need to awaken yourself
[1:23:50] and you need to recognize you weren't
[1:23:52] born here to be who you think you ought
[1:23:55] to be
[1:23:56] you were born here to be who God created
[1:24:00] you to be which is above and beyond
[1:24:03] anything that you could ever think about
[1:24:05] yourself
[1:24:07] what God has called you for what God has
[1:24:10] chosen you for what God wants to do
[1:24:13] through you in this end time is bigger
[1:24:16] than anything we could imagine
[1:24:18] you say well I'm just a housewife how
[1:24:20] could God use me let me tell you
[1:24:22] something he knows how to use anybody
[1:24:25] that will yield themselves to him
[1:24:29] hey man you don't have to be a preacher
[1:24:31] to be used of God
[1:24:33] he'll use you wherever you go
[1:24:36] you just ask sister Flo if God won't use
[1:24:38] you wherever you go
[1:24:40] you'll just carry the light with you
[1:24:43] wherever you go somebody's going to want
[1:24:46] to know what's going on in your life so
[1:24:48] no Whirlpool could take Moses out of his
[1:24:51] Destiny plan
[1:24:52] and you know when I could go back here
[1:24:55] we go
[1:24:57] when his mother looked at him
[1:25:00] she said this is a goodly child
[1:25:04] this is a goodly child now now I don't
[1:25:08] know what that means to you and your
[1:25:10] understanding but as I have told you
[1:25:13] before through the years it comes from
[1:25:15] that Hebrew word tov
[1:25:18] and Tove t-o-v is sometimes translated
[1:25:22] good when God was creating the Earth the
[1:25:26] Bible said Andy and that and the evening
[1:25:29] in the morning were the first day and
[1:25:31] God saw that what he had created was
[1:25:34] it was told
[1:25:36] it was good so here is a mother who has
[1:25:40] brought forth a child and the first
[1:25:42] thing she says when she looks in his
[1:25:44] eyes is this child is Tove
[1:25:49] now I think every mother thinks that
[1:25:52] their baby is good
[1:25:56] I'm going to let you in on a little
[1:25:57] secret
[1:26:03] don't ask me if you don't want me to
[1:26:06] tell you the truth
[1:26:08] hahaha
[1:26:09] sister West who was playing the the
[1:26:11] keyboard up here her dad was a pastor
[1:26:14] brother Stuckey and he found an unusual
[1:26:17] way to handle those uncomfortable
[1:26:19] situations when the mother wants you to
[1:26:21] to kiss their their their homely baby
[1:26:27] and they want oh don't get mad
[1:26:30] we don't have any ugly children around
[1:26:32] here
[1:26:35] your aquatic God I just had to say that
[1:26:38] didn't I and they'd say oh brother
[1:26:41] Stuckey I want to show you my my
[1:26:43] beautiful baby my handsome baby born he
[1:26:46] said yes I've never seen another one
[1:26:49] like it
[1:26:55] that wasn't really saying much was it
[1:27:02] they don't always come here looking fine
[1:27:05] sometimes they've got stork bites
[1:27:09] sometimes they got a cone head
[1:27:12] yeah
[1:27:13] you ever seen it Egghead mama don't see
[1:27:17] it
[1:27:20] well if she sees it she don't tell it
[1:27:24] she just says ain't he handsome yeah
[1:27:27] she beautiful and you just say oh I just
[1:27:30] never seen another one like it
[1:27:35] yoga mat said he is a goodly child
[1:27:40] and that means more than a handsome boy
[1:27:42] that means more than than my own and I
[1:27:46] love him because he's mine it actually
[1:27:48] means that his mother was able to
[1:27:52] spiritually discern
[1:27:54] that this boy wasn't just an ordinary
[1:27:58] boy born in the household of Israel it
[1:28:02] actually means that with discernment
[1:28:04] when she looked in his eye she saw this
[1:28:08] child has a destiny this boy has a
[1:28:13] purpose and he's going to be a help to
[1:28:17] the people of God
[1:28:18] so she did everything within her power
[1:28:21] God gave her a creative Supernatural
[1:28:25] idea
[1:28:26] and she placed it tenderly into the Nile
[1:28:31] and the whirlpools couldn't get it and
[1:28:34] brother branham's preaching away and he
[1:28:36] said that little basket started floating
[1:28:38] toward one of those whirlpools and an
[1:28:40] angel came
[1:28:44] took his finger and pushed that little
[1:28:46] basket out of the way and it goes
[1:28:48] floating on down the river he said there
[1:28:51] lay a crocodile on the bank over there
[1:28:54] hungry
[1:28:56] smelt something that smelt like
[1:28:58] breakfast
[1:28:59] and he goes over and calls some of his
[1:29:01] kin and they go over they're fixing to
[1:29:04] have baby Moses one that would soon be
[1:29:07] Called Moses when his mother Drew him
[1:29:09] from the water uh they would just have
[1:29:11] that little baby for breakfast
[1:29:13] and brother Branham said no the angel of
[1:29:15] the Lord came
[1:29:16] those angels just came in thumped said
[1:29:18] he just thumped that crocodile right on
[1:29:20] the nose
[1:29:22] that crocodile didn't even know what had
[1:29:24] hit him all he knew was I'm not getting
[1:29:27] any breakfast from a basket floating
[1:29:30] down the water you know God has a way of
[1:29:33] protecting our destiny mm-hmm he has a
[1:29:36] way of watching over us when we don't
[1:29:38] even know we're being watched over I
[1:29:40] want you to know he was sitting with you
[1:29:41] on that bar stool
[1:29:43] I want you to know some of you he went
[1:29:45] with to the crack house with you
[1:29:49] I want you to know there are people that
[1:29:51] lay on the abortion table and Jesus was
[1:29:54] there with him
[1:29:56] somebody said I can't even imagine such
[1:29:58] a thing as that you just don't know how
[1:30:01] jealous over you he is
[1:30:03] he watched over you he wooed you he
[1:30:07] followed you he protected you even in
[1:30:10] sin
[1:30:12] that's my God somebody said how could he
[1:30:15] do that because he knew who you were
[1:30:19] he knew your purpose and your destiny he
[1:30:22] knew that you were his
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:25] before the foundation of the world the
[1:30:29] scripture said you have not chosen me
[1:30:32] you're with me
[1:30:34] you have not chosen me I have chosen you
[1:30:37] saith the Lord
[1:30:39] I told a little brother standing right
[1:30:40] up there I said you just might as well
[1:30:43] yield yourself
[1:30:44] because God's hand is on you and he's
[1:30:47] going to have you
[1:30:57] because he will win every time
[1:31:02] he's that jealous over you
[1:31:04] I want you to look at your neighbor and
[1:31:06] say God's jealous over me
[1:31:11] he's kicked more than one demon in the
[1:31:13] nose
[1:31:16] he's dealt with more than one crocodile
[1:31:18] he's pushed you out of more than one
[1:31:20] whirlpool
[1:31:22] to save your life
[1:31:25] I don't know how many times I've prayed
[1:31:27] for people through the years and the
[1:31:29] Lord would let me break through vision
[1:31:30] and begin to see times in their life
[1:31:33] where the enemy had come to kill them
[1:31:36] and all you have to do is just begin to
[1:31:38] tell just a little bit you don't have to
[1:31:40] give all the detail you just tell a
[1:31:42] little bit of that time and when they
[1:31:44] recognize that that is their life
[1:31:47] and that God was watching over them and
[1:31:50] he cared enough to come that night and
[1:31:53] remind them
[1:31:57] you see there's only so long in our life
[1:32:00] that we can have it like Burger King
[1:32:03] we can have it our way
[1:32:06] there's only so long that you can have
[1:32:08] it your way so it's what I tell people
[1:32:10] you just might as well Kick It Up
[1:32:15] I'm a crazy sounding preacher
[1:32:17] but I tell people sometime you might as
[1:32:19] well just kick it up
[1:32:21] because there's coming an hour
[1:32:23] when you're not going to be able to
[1:32:25] continue to kick against the pricks
[1:32:29] you see I preach and believe so much in
[1:32:31] the sovereignty of God that I believe
[1:32:33] God knows the hour
[1:32:35] that you're going to surrender your life
[1:32:37] to him I believe before you're ever born
[1:32:39] he knows the circumstance he knows the
[1:32:42] church house
[1:32:43] he knows the stool in your living room
[1:32:45] he knows the steering wheel you're going
[1:32:47] to be sitting behind when you call on
[1:32:49] the name of Jesus and all of your life
[1:32:52] up to that moment is him watching over
[1:32:54] you and wooing you and loving you and
[1:32:56] calling you
[1:32:58] and I I shudder when I think about some
[1:33:01] of the places we've drug him
[1:33:05] but he was committed
[1:33:09] committed I've drugging through some
[1:33:10] Churches
[1:33:14] where he was a stranger
[1:33:18] for he didn't recognize anything in that
[1:33:20] place
[1:33:22] he he didn't recognize himself in the
[1:33:25] stained glass windows and
[1:33:26] he didn't recognize himself in the
[1:33:28] steeple and he didn't recognize himself
[1:33:31] in the creeds
[1:33:34] come on
[1:33:36] he didn't even know in fact he's just
[1:33:38] like it's just like the scripture tells
[1:33:40] us where he's standing outside the door
[1:33:44] and you know we love this picture where
[1:33:47] Jesus is standing outside the door
[1:33:49] knocking Saltair is one of the ones
[1:33:51] there's several who who did different
[1:33:53] Renditions of Jesus standing outside the
[1:33:56] door knocking and we preachers when
[1:33:58] we're giving off the calls we like to
[1:34:00] talk about that being the heart's door
[1:34:03] and there's no doubt in my mind that
[1:34:06] you've got a door to open or close
[1:34:08] I believe that there's no doubt in my
[1:34:10] mind he is not going to override your
[1:34:12] choice
[1:34:15] you've got free will
[1:34:17] but here's the thing God knew your
[1:34:20] choice
[1:34:22] before you ever made your choice
[1:34:26] he already represented represented
[1:34:29] himself in your life way before you ever
[1:34:31] chose him if you believe that's amen but
[1:34:35] that's not the heart's door that John
[1:34:37] was talking about in The Book of the
[1:34:38] Revelation it's the door of the church
[1:34:41] house
[1:34:43] read it read the context he said behold
[1:34:46] I stand at the door not if any man
[1:34:49] can you imagine Jesus standing on the
[1:34:52] outside of his own church
[1:34:55] got his name up over the door
[1:34:59] got his picture in the stained glass
[1:35:06] and he don't even have a key to get in
[1:35:08] his own church
[1:35:09] they've got it locked out
[1:35:12] come on
[1:35:14] they've got their crowds they've got
[1:35:15] their music they've got their
[1:35:17] entertainment they've got their programs
[1:35:19] they've got their committee meetings
[1:35:23] they've got their denominational ideas
[1:35:26] man-made stuff
[1:35:28] Jesus can't even get in his own church
[1:35:30] to really save the lost the only
[1:35:33] invitation that's given sometime is will
[1:35:36] you come move your letter
[1:35:38] I don't even know what a letter is
[1:35:41] I don't have a letter
[1:35:43] I don't have anywhere to move my letter
[1:35:45] from or two there's only one way to join
[1:35:49] the church that I'm a part of
[1:35:53] and that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:35:55] moving the letter
[1:35:56] don't have anything to do with the right
[1:35:58] hand of Fellowship you've got to be
[1:36:01] borned into the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:36:03] it's a spiritual bird
[1:36:06] you must be born again
[1:36:09] that's it
[1:36:10] the only way you can join the church of
[1:36:12] the Lord Jesus Christ you're born into
[1:36:14] it by spiritual experience
[1:36:17] so somebody said I don't know about all
[1:36:19] that feeling let me tell you something
[1:36:20] when Heaven comes down and rocks your
[1:36:22] world you're going to feel something
[1:36:26] thank you
[1:36:27] that tiny little pill can give you a bus
[1:36:30] what do you think is going to happen
[1:36:31] when you grab a hold of the King of
[1:36:32] Kings and the lord of the Lord
[1:36:36] if a few sips of that liquor is going to
[1:36:38] make you feel different what do you
[1:36:39] think is going to happen when Jesus
[1:36:41] comes and starts living inside of you
[1:36:43] calling you his own
[1:36:45] come on now you're going to feel
[1:36:48] something
[1:36:49] you're going to have a little life
[1:36:51] you know I think there's so many people
[1:36:53] that are in love with their church but
[1:36:55] they're not really in love with the Lord
[1:36:57] and you don't need to be that way I
[1:37:00] don't want you to be in love with your
[1:37:01] pastor and not be in love with the Lord
[1:37:02] I don't want you to be in a level what
[1:37:05] you believe and not be in love with the
[1:37:07] Lord because Doctrine is a person
[1:37:10] somebody said how could you say that
[1:37:12] because Jesus said I am the way I am the
[1:37:15] truth I am the life so truth is not a
[1:37:18] church
[1:37:19] truth is a person
[1:37:22] come on just like Resurrection is not a
[1:37:25] Sunday
[1:37:27] it's not one Sunday out of the year one
[1:37:28] out of 52. Resurrection is is life
[1:37:33] and it's what God does for every one of
[1:37:35] his children and Resurrection is a
[1:37:37] person
[1:37:38] because remember what Jesus said he said
[1:37:41] to to Mary Mother I am
[1:37:47] come on now I'm surprised that somebody
[1:37:51] didn't say well where's the bunny
[1:37:54] are you gonna get quiet now
[1:37:57] where's the bunny
[1:38:00] where's the basket
[1:38:04] Jesus said I am
[1:38:08] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:38:11] he's a reality folks you believe that so
[1:38:15] God Was preparing and protecting and
[1:38:18] covering Moses as he floated down that
[1:38:20] River and it was God who guided that
[1:38:23] little basket into the right spot so
[1:38:25] that so that the daughter of pharaoh
[1:38:27] would be down there just the right
[1:38:29] moment bathing and somebody would see
[1:38:31] and and if you see in the Ten
[1:38:32] Commandments it depicts his mother and
[1:38:35] his sister following along in the Reeds
[1:38:37] real little clandestine so that nobody
[1:38:40] will notice and it just so happens that
[1:38:42] that when they draw that little nursing
[1:38:45] baby out of the water
[1:38:46] come on the way it's portrayed in the
[1:38:49] movie well there's his mother she's
[1:38:51] already got everything he needs to eat
[1:38:52] and so it's as though she just turns and
[1:38:54] says hey I I need someone to help take
[1:38:57] care of this baby so we don't know if it
[1:38:59] happened exactly like that but it's a
[1:39:01] it's an unbelievable thought
[1:39:03] that God was protecting this little baby
[1:39:06] boy because one day he was going to rise
[1:39:08] up and be the deliverer of the children
[1:39:10] of Israel
[1:39:11] I want to tell you something your
[1:39:13] destiny might not be that big it might
[1:39:15] not be that elaborate it might not be
[1:39:18] that colorful but it's precious
[1:39:22] and it's valuable
[1:39:24] and nobody's going to do for God what he
[1:39:26] called you to do for God
[1:39:29] we need to stay in our own lane
[1:39:32] we need to find what God has called us
[1:39:35] to do and do it with everything that is
[1:39:37] within us
[1:39:39] everybody's not going to feel the pulpit
[1:39:41] and everybody's not going to sing and
[1:39:43] everybody's not going to do one thing or
[1:39:45] another but there's something that God
[1:39:47] has preserved you for and that is that
[1:39:50] you might serve him in spirit and in
[1:39:52] truth
[1:39:53] now I want to just read you this real
[1:39:55] quick as we move along in this in a
[1:39:58] message
[1:39:59] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:40:01] brother Branham said something about
[1:40:03] this that I find to be a very
[1:40:06] interesting perspective uh the mind of a
[1:40:09] prophet is an amazing thing how God gave
[1:40:13] him some insight if you read it there in
[1:40:16] the text it just sounds like that
[1:40:18] billions and billions and billions of
[1:40:20] frogs just happen to be swimming in the
[1:40:22] river
[1:40:23] because it says just raise your hand
[1:40:25] over the river and out of the river came
[1:40:28] these frogs well the problem with that
[1:40:30] is there weren't that many frogs in all
[1:40:32] the now
[1:40:33] so those frogs had to come from
[1:40:35] somewhere
[1:40:36] you and me so in in paragraph 470 he
[1:40:40] said he can do whatever I want to remind
[1:40:43] you of this he can do
[1:40:48] whatever he wants you you're going to
[1:40:50] tell God how to do his business
[1:40:52] he can do whatever he wants to he can
[1:40:56] create how many of you believe God can
[1:40:58] create well he sure can
[1:41:01] he can do anything
[1:41:04] he's God the very same God that creative
[1:41:07] life you see that's in you you're a
[1:41:09] prisoner
[1:41:11] you can't speak it till he says speak it
[1:41:16] listen
[1:41:18] but when you spoke
[1:41:20] it's God's word he's Vindicated it to be
[1:41:25] so this is the authority that God wants
[1:41:29] to place in his end time bride
[1:41:33] an authority to speak the word of God
[1:41:37] and draw back and watch God preform that
[1:41:41] word
[1:41:42] somebody said didn't all that stop with
[1:41:44] the apostles it absolutely did not he is
[1:41:48] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:41:50] we've already established that and so if
[1:41:54] God was ever creative he is still
[1:41:56] creative and if his word was ever
[1:41:58] creative his word is still creative
[1:42:02] he's just building a people that he can
[1:42:05] trust with that kind of authority
[1:42:08] you know we don't know what we're facing
[1:42:10] yet in this nation
[1:42:13] we we've had it easy
[1:42:17] you know we complain about gas for high
[1:42:20] gas price
[1:42:21] let me tell you some folks have real
[1:42:23] problems
[1:42:25] I'm not making light
[1:42:27] but you see it didn't stop most of us
[1:42:29] we found a way where there's a will
[1:42:31] there's a way we just kept putting gas
[1:42:33] we flinched every time we complained
[1:42:36] every time but by God's miraculous help
[1:42:39] we always filled it up or if we couldn't
[1:42:42] fill it up we got enough to get us till
[1:42:43] we could fill it up again or put some
[1:42:45] more in it I don't know how you were
[1:42:48] raised but I was raised on five dollar
[1:42:49] gas stops
[1:42:51] I've been with my mama when she had two
[1:42:53] dollar gas stops of course please
[1:42:56] remember that two dollars could take you
[1:42:58] a whole lot farther than than it can
[1:43:01] take you now
[1:43:03] I remember talking to my mother one time
[1:43:05] and and she said to me that she was
[1:43:07] nearly uh in her late 30s
[1:43:11] in her late 30s before she ever
[1:43:13] remembered filling up her gas tank
[1:43:19] so you know this is not anything new
[1:43:22] and we get all bent out of shape but
[1:43:25] folks we're facing some more serious
[1:43:27] troubles than that
[1:43:30] this nation's in trouble
[1:43:32] and there's only one answer
[1:43:36] it's Jesus
[1:43:38] there's only one answer and that's you
[1:43:41] getting enough of him in your life
[1:43:43] that you can jump on in here and fulfill
[1:43:46] your destiny
[1:43:48] because the sooner you do
[1:43:51] the sooner he comes and gets those that
[1:43:53] are his
[1:43:55] if you don't have any other
[1:43:59] who could get your eye on Eternity for a
[1:44:02] change and you could say my the quicker
[1:44:04] I get up and do what God has called me
[1:44:06] to do the quicker I can go on to be with
[1:44:08] him
[1:44:09] you let the devil have what's left here
[1:44:14] it's all going to burn up anyway
[1:44:17] Hallelujah but you're not going to miss
[1:44:19] a beat if you have eternal life
[1:44:21] anybody with me all right he goes on
[1:44:24] he's Vindicated everything else is right
[1:44:26] and he knows when that spoke is not it's
[1:44:28] got to be so Moses took his rod and said
[1:44:30] let there come frogs because God said
[1:44:32] let there come frogs
[1:44:34] the important thing is to make sure
[1:44:36] you're saying what God's saying you
[1:44:38] don't want to be saying something God's
[1:44:39] not saying in a wrong time or or even
[1:44:42] the wrong word he just transmitted it on
[1:44:45] out that's right and look what happened
[1:44:48] frogs was in everything everywhere was
[1:44:50] frogs where did they come from nobody
[1:44:52] knows they wasn't there before but the
[1:44:54] Creator God working through a Man
[1:44:56] created things a living species does
[1:45:01] anybody believe that he said the very
[1:45:03] God that made the first frog
[1:45:05] foreign
[1:45:10] the second frog he makes all for Oma you
[1:45:13] see what I mean made the first squirrel
[1:45:16] the second squirrel make any does that
[1:45:18] remind you of anything
[1:45:20] where do you want it
[1:45:23] why do you want the squirrel
[1:45:25] God not only created squirrels he asked
[1:45:28] the servant of the Lord where he wanted
[1:45:29] the squirrel to be created
[1:45:31] now somebody said well that was a
[1:45:33] prophet well I want you to know that
[1:45:34] Prophet was a forerunner
[1:45:36] of what God wants to do in his end time
[1:45:38] bride there's going to be sons of God
[1:45:42] men and women who are sons of God
[1:45:45] men and women who are the bride of
[1:45:48] Christ
[1:45:49] that are going to need some of that
[1:45:50] authority over the creative
[1:45:52] because we're going to get in some fixes
[1:45:54] and we're going to need God's
[1:45:55] Supernatural help so I'm not going to
[1:45:57] find myself with a bunch of people that
[1:45:59] don't believe that God is still able to
[1:46:01] help us today
[1:46:05] somebody said well you know he did all
[1:46:08] those things in the Bible there because
[1:46:09] that was perilous times
[1:46:12] and they really needed to get the truth
[1:46:14] established let me ask you to look
[1:46:16] around
[1:46:18] what what does this look like to you
[1:46:20] we're coming out of a great Falling Away
[1:46:22] these are perilous times even the church
[1:46:25] is falling away
[1:46:27] even the churches locked the king out
[1:46:32] uh she's she's more busy with with her
[1:46:34] donut shop and her tattoo parlor and all
[1:46:37] the other things that churches are doing
[1:46:38] these days come on
[1:46:42] come off of her Destiny and and on to
[1:46:45] how we can make it more friendly
[1:46:48] let me tell you something I don't want
[1:46:50] to create such an atmosphere that you
[1:46:52] get comfortable in your sin
[1:46:55] I want to create such an atmosphere that
[1:46:57] when you get in that presence the first
[1:46:59] thing you want to do is give it all to
[1:47:00] him
[1:47:02] that's why we worship the way
[1:47:07] we know if we can lift him high enough
[1:47:08] he'll come in here
[1:47:11] he'll come in here and he'll do the same
[1:47:13] thing today
[1:47:15] and he did when he walked the shores of
[1:47:17] Galilee Are you still with me all right
[1:47:19] there were frogs everywhere frogs frogs
[1:47:22] frogs
[1:47:23] when Pharaoh sent his maids in to bake
[1:47:25] the biscuits
[1:47:30] there was frogs in the needing Bowl
[1:47:35] Mama raises the lid off the double and
[1:47:38] frogs is in the dough Bowl
[1:47:39] and frogs are in the buttermilk
[1:47:45] and frogs are in the cornflake box
[1:47:51] frogs were everywhere
[1:47:53] I don't believe there was refrigerators
[1:47:55] but they had been in there if there had
[1:47:56] been refrigerators frogs everywhere so
[1:47:58] frog frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs
[1:48:03] and when old fat Pharaoh took his robe
[1:48:05] off
[1:48:06] and give himself a dip in that pool that
[1:48:09] tub there to take a bath
[1:48:11] he had to do it with frogs swimming
[1:48:13] around
[1:48:15] and some of us have been in that kind of
[1:48:17] water
[1:48:18] we fought the snakes off to swim
[1:48:20] and we fought the frogs I've I've thrown
[1:48:23] rocks and alligators to swim
[1:48:27] we got out on little shift boats on the
[1:48:31] lake in Africa
[1:48:32] little little tiny little handmade boats
[1:48:35] where the hippopotamuses are
[1:48:38] and the hippopotamuses are scary enough
[1:48:41] because they like to tip them little
[1:48:42] boats but them them you know 50 or more
[1:48:45] crocodiles laying up there on the bank
[1:48:48] and there will be little black children
[1:48:50] swimming right underneath those
[1:48:51] crocodiles
[1:48:53] I said now that's getting a little brave
[1:48:55] for me
[1:48:56] and they said well you don't have to
[1:48:58] worry about it because there's so many
[1:48:59] fish in this lake lake Bulgaria while
[1:49:01] they they just the crocodiles just eat
[1:49:03] the fish and they don't care nothing
[1:49:04] about the children and I just told them
[1:49:05] right front I said they've never seen a
[1:49:07] supper like me
[1:49:12] they look at those little skinny
[1:49:17] chick but I said I'm Mighty concerned
[1:49:19] that when they see me
[1:49:22] they may decide they want more than fish
[1:49:24] for dinner
[1:49:28] true story right frogs everywhere frogs
[1:49:32] in the kitchen frogs in the bed chamber
[1:49:34] frogs in the Outhouse frogs in the
[1:49:38] living room frogs in the closet indoor
[1:49:41] and outdoor frogs and on The Lawns frogs
[1:49:44] and in the gardens frogs there were
[1:49:46] frogs everywhere and everywhere there
[1:49:49] were frogs
[1:49:50] I want you to see it I want you to
[1:49:52] picture it in your mind everywhere they
[1:49:54] walked
[1:49:55] yeah
[1:49:57] squash
[1:50:04] I just got sick
[1:50:09] who did
[1:50:10] they said Oh Sister Frozen sister Anna
[1:50:15] there I'm sure are you cold you're
[1:50:16] probably cold too
[1:50:19] did that make you a little nauseous
[1:50:21] what about you go to eat a biscuit
[1:50:23] you've got a frog leg in it
[1:50:33] y'all we don't need any extra hamburgers

[1:50:40] minutes and there'll be a lot of folks
[1:50:42] giving up supper tonight
[1:50:48] squash everywhere they walk frogs frogs
[1:50:51] frogs brother Branham said they were
[1:50:54] piled up maybe 40.
[1:50:57] or 50 feet high
[1:51:02] so many frogs
[1:51:05] you know all them frogs didn't come out
[1:51:06] of the Nile
[1:51:07] never created
[1:51:10] because that's who God is
[1:51:12] he's a creator
[1:51:14] can you imagine places where they had
[1:51:16] piled them up 40 and 50 and they're just
[1:51:18] wiggling
[1:51:21] just working and wiggling and grossing
[1:51:24] everybody out
[1:51:26] I've seen some of you folks when a
[1:51:28] little tree frog gets on your glass door
[1:51:31] it's about that big and you scream
[1:51:35] like it like it's an iguana or something
[1:51:40] some of you folks would have never made
[1:51:42] it in Egypt that day
[1:51:44] everywhere frogs frogs frogs but God was
[1:51:49] trying to get the attention of pharaoh
[1:51:54] some years ago whether I was preaching
[1:51:56] in a youth camp in South Carolina are
[1:51:59] you still with me good because I'm not
[1:52:01] done
[1:52:02] preaching in a youth camp in South
[1:52:05] Carolina and I made some boys mad
[1:52:08] I know you can't imagine me making
[1:52:10] anybody mad as mild as I am
[1:52:14] but I made some boys mad they were
[1:52:16] strutting around there like roosters
[1:52:19] like they thought they were God's gift
[1:52:21] to the Youth Camp
[1:52:22] and I got tired of the way they were
[1:52:24] strutting around
[1:52:26] and I just walked by one day and I said
[1:52:28] you know what you fellas are a bunch of
[1:52:29] phonies
[1:52:31] you talk about getting their attention
[1:52:34] they said preacher what do you mean you
[1:52:35] were a bunch of phonies I said you
[1:52:37] realize before you got here you wasn't
[1:52:39] nothing
[1:52:40] but you made up your mind you was going
[1:52:43] to make everybody think you thought you
[1:52:44] were something
[1:52:45] but the truth is you're miserable
[1:52:50] your life is a wreck
[1:52:52] and you know that you're not ready to
[1:52:55] meet God
[1:52:56] and you strut in and out of the altar
[1:52:58] service like it's not affecting you but
[1:53:00] I know
[1:53:02] that it's affecting you
[1:53:04] I know God is talking to some of you and
[1:53:07] we don't have but about four more nights
[1:53:10] and I plan to pray with every one of you
[1:53:13] in the altar when you give your heart to
[1:53:15] the Lord Jesus Christ and they they
[1:53:17] weren't real rude they snickered a
[1:53:19] little bit and they said well we'll
[1:53:21] we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see
[1:53:24] if that happened or not
[1:53:26] and so the next night I preached a
[1:53:28] message called one more night with the
[1:53:30] frogs
[1:53:32] I've been preaching on this for 40 years
[1:53:35] and so I watched them boys
[1:53:39] they weren't paying much attention to
[1:53:41] anything that I had to say that didn't
[1:53:43] matter there was about 250 other young
[1:53:46] campers that were in there with me and
[1:53:48] when we give the altar call the altar's
[1:53:50] filled up and I noticed them boys all
[1:53:53] going out
[1:53:55] and I thought you know too bad there's
[1:53:57] not somebody standing at the door to
[1:53:59] drive them back in there because they
[1:54:01] really need to be in that atmosphere and
[1:54:03] you could tell by the way they were
[1:54:04] slinking out of there that they were
[1:54:06] going for meanness
[1:54:08] little did I know
[1:54:11] that I was going to be the object
[1:54:14] of their meanness
[1:54:17] those boys about eight of them they went
[1:54:19] out through the woods
[1:54:24] and they gathered some frogs
[1:54:28] I don't mean them little kind about like
[1:54:31] that
[1:54:32] I mean frogs
[1:54:34] how many of you know not frog a frog
[1:54:38] anybody know the difference that's a
[1:54:41] frog
[1:54:42] these were frogs
[1:54:45] big old hand frogs
[1:54:51] they got all kinds really the truth is
[1:54:53] they had two or three big ones and a lot
[1:54:55] of little ones
[1:54:57] and those hoodlums
[1:55:00] slipped into the staff cabin where I had
[1:55:03] a room by myself
[1:55:05] and they turned those frogs and them
[1:55:08] frogs loose
[1:55:10] in my room
[1:55:12] while I was praying in the altars
[1:55:17] by the time a snack bar was done and we
[1:55:19] were back in the room
[1:55:21] them them frogs and them frogs had
[1:55:23] already found their place to be
[1:55:25] so I walked in I didn't see anything
[1:55:27] different
[1:55:32] I walked in the little bathroom to brush
[1:55:35] my teeth
[1:55:37] and I heard a noise
[1:55:39] and it was a frog
[1:55:42] in the bathtub
[1:55:45] I said ma how'd that thing get in here
[1:55:50] I said well I'm gonna brush my teeth
[1:55:52] before I get him out and I reached up
[1:55:54] for my glass to get my toothbrush out of
[1:55:57] it and there was a little bitty frog
[1:56:00] and I'm standing there thinking that
[1:56:01] must be the baby of that one that's over
[1:56:03] there in the tub
[1:56:06] so I go over and raise the wind and I
[1:56:08] throw those those little two little two
[1:56:11] ones out a big one and a little one out
[1:56:12] and as I'm going back over to get to the
[1:56:15] bed
[1:56:16] I flopped down I sit down on the bed
[1:56:19] going to take off my shoes gonna get
[1:56:21] ready for bed and I see one under the
[1:56:24] little twin bed on the other side of the
[1:56:25] room looking at me big eyes
[1:56:29] singing like brother Daniel was singing
[1:56:31] a minute ago
[1:56:36] the truth is
[1:56:43] it the last two I didn't find till the
[1:56:45] lights were out
[1:56:51] foreign
[1:56:52] if you've never had one crawl up the
[1:56:54] inside of your leg
[1:57:02] I was so aggravated agitated by that
[1:57:06] time
[1:57:07] I don't know if it was number 10 or
[1:57:09] number 15 that made me realize somebody
[1:57:12] has done this to me
[1:57:15] but I was pretty pretty hot
[1:57:18] and I made up my mind that I was going
[1:57:21] to preach boy when I get back to that
[1:57:23] Pulpit tomorrow
[1:57:25] I'm going to preach hell hotter than I
[1:57:27] have ever
[1:57:29] before
[1:57:34] I didn't have 40 or 50 feet of frogs I
[1:57:38] only had 25 or 30. so I can't begin to
[1:57:41] understand how Pharaoh felt
[1:57:44] but all I know is that I could have come
[1:57:47] up with a better answer
[1:57:49] come on come on
[1:57:52] if the camp director would have opened
[1:57:54] my door and said brother Shelley when do
[1:57:56] you want us to help get rid of these
[1:57:58] frogs I promise you after finding one in
[1:58:01] my bed my answer would not have been
[1:58:04] [Music]
[1:58:05] um
[1:58:07] tomorrow
[1:58:11] I'd had all the frogs I could take
[1:58:13] come on now
[1:58:15] there's some reason why Pharaoh wanted
[1:58:19] one more night with the frogs anybody
[1:58:22] with me
[1:58:23] frogs everywhere
[1:58:25] everywhere
[1:58:28] the show that God was in control
[1:58:31] Moses asked pharaoh to name the time he
[1:58:34] wanted the frogs removed when would you
[1:58:37] like for me to get those frogs out of
[1:58:38] the way you and I would have said
[1:58:40] yesterday
[1:58:42] and if we wouldn't have said yesterday
[1:58:44] we'd have said right now
[1:58:47] but Pharaoh said tomorrow
[1:58:50] Pharaoh could have this terrible plague
[1:58:52] come to an end and all those frogs
[1:58:55] removed from the land any time he chose
[1:58:58] the prophet put it in his hands and his
[1:59:02] answer was tomorrow
[1:59:05] can you figure it out for some morbid
[1:59:07] sick twisted strange reason Pharaoh
[1:59:09] wanted one more night with the frogs so
[1:59:12] Moses gave him what he wanted
[1:59:14] one more night with the frogs it is
[1:59:17] likely that Pharaoh did not really
[1:59:18] believe that the god of Moses had
[1:59:20] actually caused this plague
[1:59:22] he probably thought this situation had
[1:59:25] been caused by a natural phenomenon
[1:59:27] wanted one more night for the situation
[1:59:29] to kind of change on its own without
[1:59:31] God's help
[1:59:33] maybe he thought they'd just all die at
[1:59:35] one time or go away on their your own or
[1:59:38] maybe he was hoping that before Daybreak
[1:59:40] his magicians
[1:59:43] who also conjured up a few frogs maybe
[1:59:46] they maybe would be able to solve the
[1:59:48] problem then he could keep his slaves
[1:59:51] and he wouldn't have to deal with
[1:59:53] pharaoh and the children of Israel
[1:59:55] and the god of Moses
[1:59:58] then he wouldn't have to acknowledge
[2:00:00] that there was a god higher than the god
[2:00:02] of the lies or the god of the plagues or
[2:00:03] the god of the boils or The God
[2:00:06] nevertheless and for whatever reason
[2:00:09] Pharaoh chose to spend one more night
[2:00:11] with the frogs therefore allowing time
[2:00:13] according to scripture for his heart to
[2:00:16] begin to harden even more
[2:00:19] I want to ask you tonight and I want to
[2:00:21] get serious as we as we move into the
[2:00:23] Final Phase of this tonight what do
[2:00:25] these frogs prophesy to us today
[2:00:28] I don't know if you've ever heard a frog
[2:00:30] prophesy but I want some frogs to
[2:00:32] prophesy to us in this house tonight
[2:00:35] and I want to know what it is that you
[2:00:37] would choose
[2:00:39] to spend one more night with if I could
[2:00:44] guarantee you that there was a deliverer
[2:00:46] in the house
[2:00:48] I want to know what it is that you would
[2:00:51] choose to spend a little more time with
[2:00:54] have a little longer in your life

[2:01:06] about past

[2:01:15] when the waters are troubled even when
[2:01:17] there's a going in the top of the
[2:01:19] mulberry tree and God is showing himself
[2:01:21] mighty
[2:01:22] even when there's a whisper among the
[2:01:25] people God is moving God is moving we've
[2:01:28] been saying this for months God is
[2:01:30] moving something's happening around here

[2:01:44] you can sleep through my stories but I
[2:01:48] want you to hear that there's got to be
[2:01:51] something somewhere that's causing some
[2:01:53] of us
[2:01:55] to choose to spend another night with
[2:01:58] our vice
[2:02:00] when the waters are troubled when the
[2:02:03] angel is stirring the top of the trees
[2:02:04] when the word has come forth as it has
[2:02:07] come forth the last three nights and we
[2:02:09] just halfway enter in we just halfway
[2:02:11] enter in just to appease our own
[2:02:13] feelings I want to know why some of you
[2:02:16] haven't made your way to the altar

[2:02:20] waiting what were you waiting on to be
[2:02:22] called did you need a special invitation
[2:02:27] are there people here that won't move
[2:02:29] unless you sing just as I am
[2:02:32] or is it rather there are things that we
[2:02:35] are not quite ready to be free from
[2:02:41] are you still here
[2:02:43] this is not to be ugly
[2:02:45] it's not to be cantankerous
[2:02:48] tell you that there's something that
[2:02:50] holds us back sometime when God has come
[2:02:52] and he wants to pour out life on us and
[2:02:55] we're afraid we're going to have to
[2:02:56] commit well I want to tell you something
[2:02:58] we don't have church membership here you

[2:03:02] enough money to join this church
[2:03:06] you can't pay your way in here
[2:03:09] come on there's only one way to be a
[2:03:13] part of his church which is much bigger
[2:03:15] than the four walls of this building
[2:03:17] we're talking about his universal church
[2:03:19] and The Only Name on that church is the
[2:03:21] Living Word Jesus Christ
[2:03:23] you you'll find that his church is not
[2:03:25] called Baptist or Pentecostal or
[2:03:28] Methodist
[2:03:29] his church is not even called message or
[2:03:32] charismatic or Episcopalian
[2:03:35] I'm talking about the Jesus church
[2:03:38] I'm talking about the one that lifts him
[2:03:41] higher
[2:03:42] than they left anything or anybody else
[2:03:48] we're not singing in here tonight about
[2:03:50] Sabino Canyon
[2:03:54] we're singing it here tonight I speak
[2:03:58] the name of Jesus over your anxiety
[2:04:03] over your depression
[2:04:06] who in the right mind would want to live
[2:04:09] another night
[2:04:11] in depression
[2:04:13] with anxiety
[2:04:15] when there's a way that's been made for
[2:04:16] you want to help me just a little bit
[2:04:19] I want to know what these frogs are
[2:04:21] prophesying to us tonight what is it
[2:04:23] that we're holding on to when God is
[2:04:25] sending a Word of Deliverance to us
[2:04:28] you heard the preacher
[2:04:31] frogs of unforgiveness
[2:04:33] frogs of bitterness
[2:04:35] you want to hold on to your anger One
[2:04:38] More Night
[2:04:39] because you want to make somebody else
[2:04:41] pay for what they did to you don't you
[2:04:45] know that's like acid in your soul
[2:04:48] don't you know that withholding your
[2:04:50] forgiveness is not affecting that other
[2:04:52] person nearly as much help me preach
[2:04:56] nearly as much as this affecting you
[2:04:59] you're the one that's forming cancer
[2:05:01] cells
[2:05:03] you're the one that's harming heart
[2:05:04] disease you're the one that's getting
[2:05:06] high blood pressure somebody said you're
[2:05:08] just making that up absolutely not
[2:05:11] absolutely not I have a research that
[2:05:14] says that nearly 90 percent of all
[2:05:17] disease
[2:05:18] is emotional
[2:05:20] now wait a minute that doesn't mean made
[2:05:22] up in your head
[2:05:23] it means the product
[2:05:25] of something that was going on in your
[2:05:28] life emotionally so you can make fun of
[2:05:31] that and dismiss it as Hocus Pocus
[2:05:33] but I want you to know the brain
[2:05:35] research is there
[2:05:37] that you know there's power in even
[2:05:39] looking positively when you're looking
[2:05:40] death in the face the statistics will
[2:05:43] tell us
[2:05:44] that lives are expanded and quality of
[2:05:49] life is expanded when people have the
[2:05:52] right attitude about what they're going
[2:05:54] through and when somebody gives them a
[2:05:57] death sentence when they gave my
[2:05:59] grandmother a death sentence
[2:06:02] she looked right back at the doctor and
[2:06:04] she said Sir with all my heart I
[2:06:06] appreciate you
[2:06:07] and I'm going to need you
[2:06:09] and the last thing I want to do is
[2:06:11] offend you but she said there's one
[2:06:13] thing you need to know about me I'm not
[2:06:15] going to die because you've told me to
[2:06:17] die
[2:06:19] he started laughing she said I know that
[2:06:23] you're telling me to the best of your
[2:06:24] knowledge but you said she said but I
[2:06:26] don't believe that even my body dictates
[2:06:28] the day of my death
[2:06:31] she said I don't even believe my disease
[2:06:33] is going to choose the day I die no she
[2:06:35] said I believe God's going to choose the
[2:06:37] day I die and I'm not going to die
[2:06:39] because the doctor told me to die so she
[2:06:42] said don't you be offended
[2:06:44] but I'm holding on to something and you
[2:06:46] know God extended her life and gave her
[2:06:49] better quality of life and let her be
[2:06:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:53] Christ
[2:06:54] long after the doctor said said she
[2:06:57] wouldn't make it
[2:07:00] he knows how so don't tell me the toxic
[2:07:04] thoughts don't have an awful horrible
[2:07:06] effect on the physical form of the body
[2:07:08] disease I'm telling you I have research
[2:07:11] here that says somewhere between 72
[2:07:13] percent and 90 percent of all disease
[2:07:17] is caused by toxic emotions that have
[2:07:20] never been dealt with that have been
[2:07:22] held on to because somebody said
[2:07:25] I'm going to spend another night with my
[2:07:27] unforgiveness I'm going to spend another
[2:07:29] night with my bitterness
[2:07:32] come on
[2:07:34] I don't know what to say to Thrill you
[2:07:36] but I didn't come tonight to Thrill you
[2:07:38] I came tonight to get this out of the
[2:07:41] way
[2:07:42] I won't this out of the way I want every
[2:07:45] person that God might speak to tonight
[2:07:46] to make up your mind that it doesn't
[2:07:49] matter what your frog is
[2:07:51] you don't have to wait till tomorrow to
[2:07:52] get rid of it
[2:07:54] you can get rid of it now
[2:07:56] frogs of anger do you know anger is
[2:07:58] killing people
[2:08:00] it's eating them alive it's causing them
[2:08:02] to go insane anger holding on to anger
[2:08:05] some people are angry husbands angry
[2:08:07] fathers angry mothers angry
[2:08:10] hi
[2:08:12] nurse is angry School teachers angry
[2:08:15] preachers angry
[2:08:20] and if you don't learn how to deal with
[2:08:22] that and throw it on the one who can
[2:08:24] help you with it
[2:08:26] it'll affect every phase of who you are
[2:08:28] it'll shut you out when the blessings of
[2:08:31] God are flowing all around you when
[2:08:33] others are entering into the deep Waters
[2:08:35] of the spirit you'll stand on the shore
[2:08:37] only wishing you could feel a little
[2:08:39] touch of God or a little feel of his
[2:08:41] grace or his presence you say no
[2:08:43] preacher I don't need a feeling no no
[2:08:45] it's not a feeling but it's feeling
[2:08:47] sometime that we're holding on to so
[2:08:49] that we can't encounter him
[2:08:52] frogs of addiction frogs of lust
[2:08:55] you mean one more look
[2:08:59] one more look is worth
[2:09:01] letting that water that's troubled and
[2:09:03] that that tree that's stirring and a God
[2:09:06] in the Mist who says I want to help you
[2:09:07] you mean one more look at that smut
[2:09:13] you mean somebody would choose one more
[2:09:15] night with pornography
[2:09:18] when they could be free
[2:09:20] because Jesus died to free us all is
[2:09:24] anybody with me frogs of rebellion frogs
[2:09:27] of authority issues
[2:09:29] let me tell you there's people in this
[2:09:31] room tonight you've just got a problem
[2:09:32] with any kind of authority but your own
[2:09:35] well I want to tell you something you
[2:09:37] have to learn one of these days brother
[2:09:39] sister
[2:09:40] that every one of us answer to somebody
[2:09:43] at some time in our life
[2:09:46] and I'm not saying this because we have
[2:09:48] a civil servants here and people who
[2:09:50] serve the community but I think it's
[2:09:52] absolutely insane for somebody to think
[2:09:55] that we can have less protection
[2:09:59] and and create a safer world
[2:10:02] we need more officers we need more men
[2:10:05] and women that'll help protect us from
[2:10:07] the wildness of this old world
[2:10:10] we need a whole lot more of that because
[2:10:13] there's a lot of insanity around us
[2:10:15] I want you to know we're living now in a
[2:10:18] place I thought this used to be a safe
[2:10:19] place to live
[2:10:23] just this week they come in and kill a
[2:10:25] grandmother and a little little tiny
[2:10:26] baby over here across the river just
[2:10:28] this week
[2:10:34] the world is in trouble
[2:10:36] and the church is not doing what the
[2:10:38] church ought to be doing because we're
[2:10:40] over here stroking our frogs
[2:10:44] we're petting our feelings
[2:10:47] we're petting our addictions
[2:10:49] frogs of greed frogs of rebellion frogs
[2:10:53] of authority issues frogs of addictions
[2:10:55] pills alcohol food
[2:11:04] Red Bulls
[2:11:06] come on
[2:11:09] addictions
[2:11:11] you don't think I'm gonna preach on a
[2:11:13] food addiction and not talk about a Red
[2:11:14] Bull addiction do you
[2:11:20] yeah my mother got addicted to chapstick
[2:11:24] I didn't want her to be bound but
[2:11:26] chapstick
[2:11:28] I don't believe it's God's will for you
[2:11:30] to be bound to anything but the word of
[2:11:33] God
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:35] I don't believe there's anything that
[2:11:37] ought to have power and control over our
[2:11:39] lives but the holy spirit of God and the
[2:11:42] word of truth I don't think we ought to
[2:11:44] be a slave to the coffee cup
[2:11:47] anybody knows I really do enjoy a cup of
[2:11:50] coffee in the morning
[2:11:52] and I am not very talkative without it
[2:11:54] I'm honest I'll be honest I don't drink
[2:11:56] it all through the day
[2:11:58] but that's because I know that in excess
[2:12:00] is certainly not good for me but I don't
[2:12:02] want to be a slave to that
[2:12:04] because some days I don't get the coffee
[2:12:06] and I still have to function I don't
[2:12:09] want anything to hold me that way is
[2:12:11] anybody with me frogs of guilt
[2:12:13] condemnation
[2:12:16] guilty past the enemy trying to lie to
[2:12:20] you and keep you from accepting God's
[2:12:21] grace because of something you've done
[2:12:27] insecurity
[2:12:31] are people who'd rather sleep with the
[2:12:33] frogs of insecurity
[2:12:34] than to let Jesus just remake them with
[2:12:37] confidence and boldness and strength of
[2:12:39] who he would want them to be let me tell
[2:12:41] you something God can remake you
[2:12:44] he can pick up our broken twisted
[2:12:47] affected
[2:12:49] dysfunctional lives
[2:12:52] and fill us with so much life that our
[2:12:55] own family doesn't recognize Who We Are
[2:12:58] today
[2:13:00] you let old Jesse over there on the
[2:13:02] front row hold up your hand Jesse when

[2:13:07] work in his life I want you to know it
[2:13:09] made enough it made us a a speech it
[2:13:11] made an effect it spoke I'll get it out

[2:13:16] sides

[2:13:19] just have parents and and their new
[2:13:21] companion stepmom and stepdad and and
[2:13:24] brothers into I want you to know look to
[2:13:26] me like the whole Community come out
[2:13:30] to watch Jesse be baptized because they
[2:13:32] were so proud
[2:13:34] so thankful so affected by the fact that
[2:13:38] God had made such a difference in his
[2:13:39] life somebody wanted to celebrate it
[2:13:41] with him they didn't all get baptized
[2:13:44] they didn't all join the church but they
[2:13:46] wanted to celebrate with him that God
[2:13:48] had made a difference in his life come
[2:13:50] on go all the way around this room it
[2:13:51] happened the same way I gotta hurry
[2:13:54] frogs of of Shame
[2:13:59] frogs of apathy indifference
[2:14:03] frogs of worry
[2:14:04] frogs of fear
[2:14:06] there's things going on in our lives
[2:14:08] right now that at one time caused our
[2:14:11] heart to tremble and our knees to bow
[2:14:14] things that we once bragged about how we
[2:14:16] could handle them are now handling us
[2:14:20] one more night with the frogs
[2:14:23] urges that we once controlled
[2:14:27] are now controlling us
[2:14:29] how many more nights you want to spend
[2:14:33] out of control because you've let some
[2:14:35] little pill control your life
[2:14:38] or you've just let some Unholy desire or
[2:14:41] unnatural desire control your life
[2:14:44] you really want one more night with it
[2:14:46] when Jesus is standing here tonight to
[2:14:49] say if you'll trust me with your love I
[2:14:52] will set you free from the top of your
[2:14:53] head to the souls of your feet
[2:14:56] somebody said but it's not always
[2:14:58] instantaneous you're right but he don't
[2:15:01] turn loose of you
[2:15:03] once you commit to him he's going to
[2:15:06] hold on to you
[2:15:09] brother Branham lost his wife
[2:15:12] he lost his little precious baby girl
[2:15:15] Sharon Rose
[2:15:17] in the Ohio flood and the and the
[2:15:19] pneumonia and the tuberculosis and all
[2:15:21] the diseases that affected those people
[2:15:23] because of the of the Ohio river that
[2:15:26] that flooded Louisville Kentucky and
[2:15:28] Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:15:30] he's standing over his little baby girl
[2:15:34] jerking and
[2:15:35] terrible fever and dying and
[2:15:38] sister hope his wife is buried
[2:15:41] later they go and open up the grave and
[2:15:43] lay that little casket down on top of
[2:15:45] Mother's casket because brother Brandon
[2:15:48] made a promise that if that happened
[2:15:49] that way he would bury her in her
[2:15:51] mother's arms
[2:15:53] here he's a preacher here he has given
[2:15:56] his life for God
[2:15:58] God was calling him to some things that
[2:16:00] he wasn't quite willing to do
[2:16:03] and God knew how to knock on his door
[2:16:06] and I know that makes some people mad
[2:16:09] that's not judgment
[2:16:13] that's Grace
[2:16:15] as love
[2:16:17] that's love
[2:16:18] hope had a home
[2:16:20] she had a place to go Sharon Rose had a
[2:16:22] place to go brother Branham standing on
[2:16:25] the side of the highway his body's
[2:16:27] shaking with tears
[2:16:29] is he standing there day after day
[2:16:30] grieving over the loss
[2:16:33] and an elected official in the in the
[2:16:35] place in the in the community comes by
[2:16:37] and sees him standing out there and he
[2:16:39] said now's my chance to stop and see if
[2:16:41] I can say a good word to Bill and
[2:16:43] encourage him somehow and he walks up to
[2:16:45] the Grave some of you have been there I
[2:16:46] I have been right there on the side of
[2:16:48] the road sister hope is buried not too
[2:16:50] far from the edge of the road there and
[2:16:53] he walks up that little Knoll
[2:16:55] and stood there beside brother Bannon
[2:16:57] put his arm around him bill
[2:17:00] I've been thinking about you
[2:17:02] they talk on a few minutes and he said I
[2:17:04] want to know something how have you held
[2:17:08] on to your religion
[2:17:10] we know it's not religion it's faith
[2:17:13] but this is how he was talking how have
[2:17:16] you held on to your religion I've been
[2:17:18] wondering how you've been holding on to
[2:17:19] it he said oh no
[2:17:22] you need to understand I'm not holding
[2:17:25] on to hit
[2:17:28] I'm not holding on to my religion or my
[2:17:31] faith it's holding on to me
[2:17:36] that's what faith does
[2:17:39] we've grown so accustomed to our frogs
[2:17:41] anybody still here
[2:17:43] we're so familiar with our frogs
[2:17:46] until they become a part of our identity
[2:17:49] you know I've actually met people that
[2:17:50] didn't want to be healed because they
[2:17:51] were going to have to walk right
[2:17:56] it can be an emotional bondage
[2:18:00] I've met people that didn't want to get
[2:18:02] rid of some of the things that were
[2:18:03] tormenting them because they would have
[2:18:06] to discover who they really should be
[2:18:08] that's what fear will do that's what the
[2:18:10] enemy will do
[2:18:15] we're serving a God who said old things
[2:18:17] have passed away
[2:18:18] behold what
[2:18:20] all those things become new we've grown
[2:18:22] so accustomed so familiar with our frogs
[2:18:24] that even when we have an opportunity to
[2:18:26] be free from them sometime we choose
[2:18:28] them
[2:18:29] we choose them
[2:18:30] again and again and again we've played
[2:18:33] so long and we've cuddled with what
[2:18:36] seemed like a little harmless baby worm
[2:18:38] so long
[2:18:40] until now it's revealed itself as a
[2:18:42] Viper that's out to destroy our lives
[2:18:44] and we don't know how to put it down
[2:18:46] because we've cuddled it for so long
[2:18:49] some of these frogs
[2:18:51] some of these things that are out to
[2:18:53] destroy that are out to torment we've
[2:18:56] known too long what we needed to do we
[2:18:58] needed to get rid of those things we
[2:19:00] needed to ask the Lord for help we
[2:19:02] needed Deliverance
[2:19:03] but instead we've chosen another night
[2:19:06] petting our hurt feelings
[2:19:09] waiting on somebody to come and
[2:19:10] apologize to us
[2:19:15] that's Pride
[2:19:18] you're going to have to learn by the
[2:19:20] grace of God as we all learn to forgive
[2:19:23] whether anybody ever gets around to
[2:19:25] saying I'm sorry or not
[2:19:28] unforgiveness is not a frog you want to
[2:19:30] hold on to I tell you what just get to a
[2:19:33] place where you can just forgive because
[2:19:35] you know it's the right thing to do and
[2:19:38] keep walking
[2:19:39] we keep putting off what needs to be
[2:19:42] dealt with now
[2:19:45] people will say I'll get my heart right
[2:19:46] in the next Revival when camp meeting
[2:19:48] comes I'm going to really enter in
[2:19:51] the preacher certain preacher I like
[2:19:53] when he comes I'm really gonna make up
[2:19:55] my mind then
[2:19:58] but instead it's like it's like the
[2:20:00] scripture said in Acts 24 when Paul is
[2:20:02] standing before Felix and he's
[2:20:04] witnessing to him and Felix is Almost
[2:20:07] Persuaded he's almost ready but right
[2:20:11] about the moment that he would accept
[2:20:12] this truth
[2:20:14] he said go thy way for this time when I
[2:20:18] have a convenient season I will call for
[2:20:21] thee
[2:20:22] I'm told a story can I have 10 more
[2:20:24] minutes
[2:20:25] I'm told a story about an eagle
[2:20:28] that was circling and frozen tundra
[2:20:32] and saw a little broken
[2:20:35] piece of ice
[2:20:38] with one little lamb on it
[2:20:40] a piece that had broken off and carried
[2:20:44] this little stray lamb away from the
[2:20:45] safety of of the fold of the other lambs
[2:20:48] and hear this little piece of ice was
[2:20:52] floating down the river
[2:20:54] just enough water that wasn't Frozen
[2:20:58] to carry right out in the middle of the
[2:21:00] river to carry that little piece of ice
[2:21:02] down the river and just be on
[2:21:06] was a real waterfall
[2:21:11] and is that eagle looked down and saw
[2:21:15] that little lamb there
[2:21:18] it purposed in its own instinct
[2:21:23] he certainly had the Vantage of being
[2:21:26] able to see what was ahead
[2:21:28] anybody that knows anything about the
[2:21:31] nature of an eagle knows it's a very
[2:21:33] intelligent bird
[2:21:35] it certainly must know that danger was
[2:21:38] just ahead but this Eagle was counting
[2:21:40] on the fact
[2:21:42] that he would be able to swoop down and
[2:21:45] and have that little lamb for a meal
[2:21:50] just before that little piece of ice
[2:21:53] went over the waterfall
[2:21:56] and so he landed on that little piece of
[2:21:59] ice
[2:22:00] as it was floating very slowly along
[2:22:03] and he began to make his feast
[2:22:05] on that little lamb that was destined
[2:22:08] for death anyway
[2:22:10] when he recognized by the sound of the
[2:22:14] water
[2:22:15] that he was about to go over the fall
[2:22:19] he said now's my time to exit so to
[2:22:22] speak
[2:22:23] and you just raised up his wings and he
[2:22:26] began to Flap and those wings that had
[2:22:29] lifted him out of danger hundreds of
[2:22:31] times before failed him in that moment
[2:22:37] you see the warmth of his body
[2:22:40] the very heat of his Talons had melted
[2:22:43] the ice enough
[2:22:45] that he was adhered to the ice
[2:22:49] melted enough to hold him there as the
[2:22:52] temperature caused the ice to freeze
[2:22:54] over his Talons and what he thought
[2:22:57] would save him because it had saved him
[2:23:00] many many many many times before it
[2:23:02] failed him now
[2:23:04] because he did not anticipate
[2:23:08] the unexpected he thought he had jobs
[2:23:12] just enough time
[2:23:15] you know a knowledge of this message
[2:23:17] without a born-again experience is one
[2:23:20] of the most dangerous things you can
[2:23:21] possess
[2:23:26] because you know so much
[2:23:28] about how things are going to unfold
[2:23:30] that you keep telling yourself I got
[2:23:33] more time I got a little more time in
[2:23:36] order how much time but I got a little
[2:23:37] more time why in the world would you
[2:23:40] bargain for a little more time so that
[2:23:42] you could spend one more night with the
[2:23:44] things that have made you so miserable
[2:23:46] anyway I'm gonna tell you something
[2:23:48] unbelief is misery addiction is misery
[2:23:53] doubting the word is misery
[2:23:56] unforgiveness and bitterness is misery
[2:24:00] lust is Misery all addiction misery
[2:24:04] there's no joy in it it's only a moment
[2:24:08] of ecstasy only a moment of satisfaction
[2:24:11] sin can never satisfy
[2:24:15] but for a moment
[2:24:18] the reason why I wanted to tell that
[2:24:20] those stories because we've been told by
[2:24:22] the word of God that the Overcomer is an
[2:24:24] eagle
[2:24:25] and that's the reason why I said it's
[2:24:27] one of the most dangerous things you can
[2:24:28] possess is a knowledge of this truth
[2:24:32] because you start bargaining with what
[2:24:34] you've heard the prophet say
[2:24:36] and you say wait a minute this hadn't
[2:24:38] happened yet so
[2:24:44] you're not playing Monopoly children
[2:24:48] you said in the game of of life
[2:24:51] on the board game
[2:24:54] this isn't jumping spaces and buying
[2:24:57] hotels and no no no this is eternity
[2:25:00] that we're playing with
[2:25:03] you see like Moses you've got a Destiny
[2:25:06] and a call on your life and you are
[2:25:08] going to serve God I want to tell you
[2:25:10] something there are people under the
[2:25:11] sound of my voice right now that are not
[2:25:13] serving God you're going to serve God
[2:25:17] how do you know because I know he's
[2:25:19] jealousy over his children
[2:25:21] and I want to just be honest and I am
[2:25:24] not anybody that knows me knows I'm not
[2:25:26] some
[2:25:27] to call in fact to be honest with you I
[2:25:30] rarely give them
[2:25:33] you don't hear me telling Sam had
[2:25:35] stories
[2:25:36] to try to get people to move it's very
[2:25:39] unusual for me so I was very shocked
[2:25:43] after after we we the tone was set last
[2:25:46] night
[2:25:48] and I come in here and God has asked me
[2:25:51] to preach in Evangelistic message
[2:25:55] so I thought and I struggled and I
[2:25:57] wrestled
[2:26:00] but I realized that we've got two more
[2:26:03] services
[2:26:05] and we need to go somewhere
[2:26:07] because some of you are going home
[2:26:09] in a day or two
[2:26:11] and God forbid you go back the way you
[2:26:15] came
[2:26:16] somebody said all right preacher I'm
[2:26:18] doing pretty good I know that
[2:26:21] I know you're getting high but I don't
[2:26:24] want anybody to go home tonight exactly
[2:26:26] like they came in
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:29] everybody to have encountered this touch
[2:26:31] I want everybody if you haven't felt him
[2:26:34] I want you to at least be able to say I
[2:26:36] saw him yeah I saw him moving on others
[2:26:39] maybe you didn't feel it for yourself
[2:26:41] but you must have known there was a
[2:26:43] shift in the atmosphere when his
[2:26:45] presence began to move in here
[2:26:48] the truth is
[2:26:50] he comes without the drums
[2:26:53] he comes without the song
[2:26:56] it comes when we invite him
[2:26:58] come on now
[2:27:00] the enemy will use all kinds of
[2:27:02] distractions to keep us
[2:27:05] from recognizing Our Moment our hour I
[2:27:07] think my 10 minutes is about up
[2:27:09] I want to tell you that delay is
[2:27:11] dangerous
[2:27:13] it was for the eagle
[2:27:15] I want to tell you that procrastination
[2:27:17] leads to infestation
[2:27:21] because if I know anything about frogs
[2:27:23] they have more than one or two babies
[2:27:26] frogs just reproduce and they rep
[2:27:29] anybody had a swimming pool
[2:27:31] that the frogs got in
[2:27:35] you go out one day there's not a there's
[2:27:37] not an egg Sac anywhere you go out the
[2:27:39] next day and they have I'm talking about
[2:27:40] salt or chlorine what have you got
[2:27:43] they didn't taste the water they just
[2:27:45] laid their eggs there
[2:27:47] and you see these big old stringy sacks
[2:27:49] of eggs and you better do something
[2:27:51] about them
[2:27:53] because they're going to hatch
[2:27:56] and when they do you're going to have
[2:27:57] some frogs and you may end up like us
[2:27:59] with some frogs
[2:28:01] oh do we got some big ones that like to
[2:28:03] get in Irish from time to time
[2:28:05] procrastination leads to infestation
[2:28:08] frogs beget frogs if you don't deal with
[2:28:11] the frogs they just keep having frogs
[2:28:13] not tomorrow no musicians are coming
[2:28:21] now
[2:28:26] out your frogs
[2:28:27] leave this place without your frogs
[2:28:31] roll them on him
[2:28:34] make up your mind that God is a god of
[2:28:37] change
[2:28:39] you know we're pretty famous for our
[2:28:40] promises about tomorrow
[2:28:42] what we're going to do tomorrow I'll do
[2:28:45] that tomorrow we pledge to start eating
[2:28:47] better tomorrow thinking better tomorrow
[2:28:50] exercising more tomorrow organizing our
[2:28:53] closets better tomorrow cleaning out the
[2:28:56] garage
[2:28:57] tomorrow watch me I'm preaching they're
[2:29:00] just walking they're not interesting
[2:29:04] to worry less
[2:29:06] tomorrow
[2:29:13] seems that our designated moment
[2:29:15] to always start our personal
[2:29:17] transformation
[2:29:19] it's tomorrow
[2:29:21] tomorrow
[2:29:23] I love you
[2:29:25] tomorrow
[2:29:26] you're always a day
[2:29:29] away
[2:29:32] we love tomorrow
[2:29:35] but the word of God says in Hebrews 3 7
[2:29:38] and 8 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith
[2:29:41] today
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] if you will hear his voice
[2:29:49] his voice hard to not your heart
[2:29:53] pharaoh and choose another night with
[2:29:55] the frogs
[2:29:58] if this Jesus is real and you know he is
[2:30:01] and if he can really help me with my
[2:30:03] stuff why not give it to him tonight why
[2:30:06] not try what do you got to lose somebody
[2:30:08] said I don't want to be embarrassed
[2:30:10] let me tell you life is full of
[2:30:12] embarrassments
[2:30:16] I had a little embarrassing moment
[2:30:18] earlier today but I just made up my mind
[2:30:21] I'm going to do this
[2:30:23] because it's the right thing to do
[2:30:27] and we have to do that sometime
[2:30:29] even if it puts us out there a little
[2:30:31] bit I want to tell you something you may
[2:30:33] not know this is a safe place
[2:30:36] we've seen a lot of things
[2:30:40] we've seen mascara run
[2:30:45] I don't know why you'd want that stuff
[2:30:51] you get under that presence of God and
[2:30:53] the first thing happened to some rolling
[2:30:55] down your cheeks
[2:30:58] that don't scare me
[2:31:00] I've seen spiders fall off of people's
[2:31:03] eyes
[2:31:04] when they got emotional
[2:31:07] that didn't scare me
[2:31:09] I knew they had glued them on
[2:31:13] I've seen fingernails come on I've seen
[2:31:15] people get under the spirit of God in
[2:31:17] the wig drop
[2:31:22] I've seen people speaking tongues and
[2:31:24] their teeth fall out
[2:31:27] that didn't scare me
[2:31:29] you know what them folks did they just
[2:31:31] reached down got them deep
[2:31:34] I've seen preachers do it I've been in
[2:31:36] Services where they popped out hit a
[2:31:37] metal foe hit the pulpit hit a metal
[2:31:40] phone and chair flew up through the air
[2:31:42] in the preacher went
[2:31:45] that didn't scare me
[2:31:49] I've seen people wallow around and Alder
[2:31:51] into their blouse was untucked
[2:31:55] elastic skirt come that didn't scare us
[2:31:58] no
[2:31:59] no we know how to help you
[2:32:01] We're not gonna let you be indecent
[2:32:06] this is a safe place
[2:32:08] I'm not saying you do any of that you
[2:32:10] might stand like a stoic Soldier and
[2:32:13] never show you the emotion none of that
[2:32:16] matters to me
[2:32:17] you don't have to act like I act to get
[2:32:20] help
[2:32:21] I have to worship like I worship to be
[2:32:24] right
[2:32:25] it'll be a Holy Roller to be right but
[2:32:27] there ain't nothing wrong with Holy
[2:32:28] Rollers
[2:32:29] I'll tell you that right now some of the
[2:32:32] finest folks I know
[2:32:34] Are Holy Rollers
[2:32:36] I remember when the power of God used to
[2:32:38] fall and people couldn't hold themselves
[2:32:40] up
[2:32:41] I've seen denominational people who
[2:32:43] didn't believe in the Holy Ghost get
[2:32:44] under the power of God and do some
[2:32:46] pretty outlandish exciting things
[2:32:49] but the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's
[2:32:52] not here to embarrass you you may not
[2:32:55] even move forward you may sit at your
[2:32:57] seat and call on the Lord it does not
[2:32:59] matter to me how you touch him tonight
[2:33:01] but I must tell you that I came here
[2:33:05] knowing that somebody had to call an end
[2:33:08] to the frogs
[2:33:10] somebody has got to make a move deny
[2:33:13] toward God and say Lord it'll be a
[2:33:16] journey but I'm starting
[2:33:19] I don't know how long play something I
[2:33:21] don't know how long it'll take me
[2:33:24] to get to where I want to be
[2:33:26] but I'm starting this journey tonight
[2:33:30] I don't know how long it'll take me to
[2:33:32] get rid of the pills
[2:33:35] I don't know how long it'll take me to
[2:33:37] get rid of the nicotine
[2:33:39] I don't know how long it'll take me to
[2:33:41] get rid of the alcohol
[2:33:44] I don't know how long it'll take me
[2:33:47] to control my chocolate cake urge
[2:33:54] because we all know it's hard to stop
[2:33:56] with one piece
[2:34:00] I don't know how long it'll take me to
[2:34:02] get to where I'm going
[2:34:03] but I got to start somewhere
[2:34:07] I don't want no more frogs
[2:34:11] when do you want to get rid of those
[2:34:13] things
[2:34:19] [Music]
[2:34:22] we'll feed you if it's midnight
[2:34:27] well I don't have to give up that boy
[2:34:29] friend
[2:34:31] I want to tell you something I don't
[2:34:33] care if he's tagged with gold
[2:34:37] he's not worth your soul
[2:34:39] I wish somebody help me right now
[2:34:42] some young man said I'd like to serve
[2:34:44] God but I'd have to give up that whole
[2:34:46] trampy girl I run with
[2:34:50] did you just say that yeah
[2:34:52] and I cleaned it up for visitors
[2:34:56] I want to tell you something I don't
[2:34:58] care how she Wiggles her tail
[2:35:00] she is not worth your soul
[2:35:05] foreign
[2:35:09] they're not the only fish in the sea
[2:35:12] God's got somebody for you
[2:35:15] I believe God's got somebody for you if
[2:35:17] you have to compromise who you are to
[2:35:19] hold on to
[2:35:24] I don't understand the spirit that gets
[2:35:27] on young women and now now middle-aged
[2:35:29] women and they're looking for bad boys
[2:35:33] I don't know what's going on in your
[2:35:35] life or in your childhood that attracts
[2:35:37] you to losers like that
[2:35:38] [Music]
[2:35:40] I'm preaching now
[2:35:42] you better make up your mind
[2:35:44] you need somebody that'll love God and
[2:35:46] let me tell you something says you want
[2:35:48] a man that'll love God more than you
[2:35:52] if you've been telling yourself I want a
[2:35:54] man that'll love me more than anything
[2:35:56] else in the world he don't exist
[2:36:00] let's be brutally honest he doesn't
[2:36:01] exist because he if he doesn't love God
[2:36:04] he loves his self
[2:36:07] and his stuff his Budweiser yeah
[2:36:12] and his boat
[2:36:15] and he may love you when he needs you
[2:36:17] but that's not near enough
[2:36:20] to satisfy the longing in your soul
[2:36:23] fast the woman at the well she had all
[2:36:25] kinds of men
[2:36:27] she had a rich one and a poor one and a
[2:36:29] fat one and
[2:36:31] a smart one and a dumb one and yeah
[2:36:35] she had a James Dean one and a Chris
[2:36:38] Pratt one and I don't even know who some
[2:36:39] of these people are just heard their
[2:36:40] names
[2:36:45] and none of them satisfied until she met
[2:36:47] the seventh man
[2:36:48] Jesus said you've well said you're not
[2:36:50] married you've had five husbands and the
[2:36:52] one you're living with right now is
[2:36:53] number six
[2:36:55] and everything she needed was in the
[2:36:57] seventh one and he was standing right
[2:36:59] there that said you drink this water
[2:37:01] you'll thirst again
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:06] the man dissatisfied that long and in
[2:37:08] your soul but if you let me I'll give
[2:37:11] you water
[2:37:13] I'll give you water to drink and you'll
[2:37:16] never want any other will
[2:37:19] the run back after Harry
[2:37:22] or dick or Larry or whatever name is
[2:37:25] once you taste this water Jesus said
[2:37:28] you'll find what you're looking for
[2:37:32] higher
[2:37:40] he's better than the thrill
[2:37:42] the the no The Knowing of eternal life
[2:37:45] is better than the thrill of sex
[2:37:48] it's better than the thrill of the
[2:37:50] pillar or the liquor or anything else
[2:37:53] that gives you even a half a moment of
[2:37:55] goodness or feeling or
[2:37:58] releases some chemicals in your in your
[2:38:00] body I'm telling you nothing can say
[2:38:03] especially
[2:38:04] because he saw you
[2:38:10] but but I've so disappointed the Lord
[2:38:12] yeah
[2:38:13] we have
[2:38:14] but you didn't take him by surprise
[2:38:19] he knew you before the foundation of the
[2:38:21] world he knew you were he knew you were
[2:38:23] gonna go look in here and you're gonna
[2:38:24] go look in there he knew that and he
[2:38:27] loved you anyway
[2:38:29] I'm not doing just yet but almost
[2:38:31] he loved you anyway
[2:38:34] and he came looking for you
[2:38:36] so nothing you said well if he just knew
[2:38:38] if he just knew do you know what we're
[2:38:39] talking about now we're not talking
[2:38:40] about the priest
[2:38:42] or talk about the Lord Jesus
[2:38:44] you don't you don't know anything he
[2:38:45] don't know about you you've never done
[2:38:47] anything he don't already know you've
[2:38:48] never been anywhere he didn't see you
[2:38:51] oh but nobody know he

[2:40:39] squatted down in that culvert
[2:40:43] he said my that's strange
[2:40:45] and so he went over to the cupboard and

[2:41:00] in a culvert yes sir he said
[2:41:03] if my daddy could find me he'd kill me
[2:41:07] and the police said well I guess I'd
[2:41:08] make you want to live in a a covert if
[2:41:10] you're dad was wanting to kill you he
[2:41:13] said but what makes you think
[2:41:15] that he wants to kill you well I ran
[2:41:17] away
[2:41:18] I was ashamed
[2:41:20] of some things I'd done and I ran away
[2:41:22] and my dad told me if I ever run away
[2:41:24] and he found me he would he would kill
[2:41:27] me and the police officer said how about
[2:41:29] I reach out to your dad oh no I don't
[2:41:31] want you to do that he said no I have to
[2:41:33] I can't leave you here like this

[2:41:38] said sir I'm calling to tell you I found
[2:41:40] your teenage son oh you you found him
[2:41:45] we've been looking everywhere for him
[2:41:49] he's been gone two weeks
[2:41:54] we've not been able to locate him
[2:41:56] anywhere
[2:41:57] he said well sir I'm sorry to tell you
[2:41:59] he's been living in a culvert down on an
[2:42:02] empty lot in downtown no telling the
[2:42:05] conditions that he's had to live and I
[2:42:07] he doesn't even look like he's had a
[2:42:08] good good meal and he said I'll be right
[2:42:11] there
[2:42:12] the police officer said so you're not
[2:42:13] mad at him he said oh no if I was mad at
[2:42:16] him I couldn't be mad at him now
[2:42:18] I want to know that he's safe I want to
[2:42:21] know that he's all right
[2:42:23] that's all we ever wanted to know was
[2:42:25] that he was all right we were scared to
[2:42:26] death
[2:42:27] here come a man and his wife they jumped
[2:42:30] out of the car and they ran over there
[2:42:32] to the police officer and they grabbed
[2:42:34] that boy they wrapped their arms around
[2:42:36] him and they wept
[2:42:37] and the police officer he said to
[2:42:39] himself this doesn't look like a an
[2:42:41] abusive situation
[2:42:43] no
[2:42:45] the little boy had just made up in his
[2:42:47] mind
[2:42:51] though there were some Angry Words
[2:42:52] exchanged daddy said some ugly things we
[2:42:56] daddies can do that from time to time
[2:42:58] but it doesn't mean we'd ever want any
[2:43:00] harm to come to our own
[2:43:03] he said you mean to tell me that
[2:43:05] you're going to take your boy you're
[2:43:07] ready to take him back and oh yeah I
[2:43:09] said his bed's there waiting on him and
[2:43:11] and there'll be a warm meal for him he's
[2:43:14] ours we want to take care of him and
[2:43:16] we've wanted to all along and the law
[2:43:19] officer looked at the boy and he said oh

[2:43:42] there was a bedroom with your name on it
[2:43:44] and a warm meal and a mom and a dad who
[2:43:46] loved you but you had made up in your
[2:43:48] mind

[2:43:51] were going to cause your harm and you
[2:43:53] know what
[2:43:54] that's like we do sometime

[2:44:06] arms but I want you to know he stands
[2:44:09] in eternity tonight with his arms

[3:23:49] she
[3:23:51] knocked on death door and

[3:24:17] down there at that Tabernacle and she
[3:24:20] was just a bag of bones
[3:24:22] I hadn't eaten in days
[3:24:25] couldn't hold anything down
[3:24:27] we brought her up to the top of the hill
[3:24:29] right here where the church sins
[3:24:31] and she ate a hamburger
[3:24:35] now God had really touched her life
[3:24:38] where is Casey Hannah
[3:24:41] that's a miracle girl right there
[3:24:44] her story's been written up in medical

[3:25:06] what were your four
[3:25:09] years old
[3:25:12] her legs
[3:25:14] were nothing but bones
[3:25:17] and skin
[3:25:19] there seemed to be no muscle
[3:25:21] who saw it
[3:25:23] hold your hand if you were here that
[3:25:25] night
[3:25:27] a fungus
[3:25:29] that all of us come in contact with she
[3:25:32] had had leukemia
[3:25:34] and was doing okay you know they can
[3:25:37] treat it
[3:25:38] but that fungus took a hold
[3:25:41] and it began to eat the bone
[3:25:44] that her brain sat on in her skull
[3:25:48] and the night that she was here she
[3:25:51] blowed her nose and pieces of bone came
[3:25:53] out of her nose from that plate the
[3:25:56] doctors were doing everything they could
[3:25:58] they even gave her veterinarian medicine
[3:26:01] treated her like a horse to try to help
[3:26:03] her
[3:26:04] but we know where the healing come from
[3:26:07] God heard God heard prayers prayers was
[3:26:10] going up everywhere
[3:26:13] we're not taking any credit Jesus did it
[3:26:17] they told him not maybe they shouldn't
[3:26:19] bring her down there because her
[3:26:20] breathing in and what she had been
[3:26:22] through
[3:26:23] under that dust where the sawdust was
[3:26:27] and brother Garvis is just holding this
[3:26:28] little
[3:26:30] honestly it would break your heart to
[3:26:32] see her
[3:26:33] God began to turn things around
[3:26:37] you know he's the same yesterday
[3:26:40] today and forever
[3:26:42] Casey wouldn't take anything on her
[3:26:44] stomach she wouldn't eat anything and

[3:26:48] you want to eat something she said I
[3:26:49] want a hamburger
[3:26:52] I don't know if that'd be my first meal
[3:26:54] if I hadn't eaten anything but she ate a
[3:26:56] hamburger right under that tent

[3:27:26] still the same yesterday today and
[3:27:29] forever
