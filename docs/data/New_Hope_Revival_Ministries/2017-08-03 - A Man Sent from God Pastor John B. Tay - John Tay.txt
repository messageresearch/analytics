TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everybody. I'm Pastor Shelley again and I'm still here with my good friend for many years now since the early 90s, Pastor John B. Taye from Ghana, West Africa. I tell you, we have had some amazing times worshiping the Lord in his church. You've never lived until you've been to a church like that that is so founded, grounded on the word of God and so full of the Holy Ghost and fire. And I'm telling you, those people don't worship with their hands folded and their heads bowed. When they when it's time to worship God, they know how to worship him. And uh we could use a little of that in the United States and maybe wherever you're watching this little blog. Oh, [Applause] [Music] I could use a little of that fire, too. Well, it's in you. But I asked Pastor Tay to sit with me a little while longer because I wanted to mention two other things that he spoke to us about uh at our church on Sunday that I felt were very powerful. And uh we mentioned in the last blog that he was teaching us the importance of speaking and then expecting to see what we speak. So we should be very careful what we speak. um if we keep speaking about the darkness and keep speaking about the bad circumstances, they're going to hang around and they're only going to get worse. But if we will take the spirit of God and the word of God as our example when God saw the darkness and the chaos, he just spoke into it and uh he didn't speak about it. He spoke into it. Amen. And he said, "Let there be light and there was light." And then God saw the light and it was good. And so we enjoyed that uh little segment so much that I wanted you to share with us, Pastor Tay, uh what you spoke to us about Adam. You know, we we we're familiar with this uh scripture in the Bible, but you just brought it out in a in a very powerful way in Genesis where the animals were brought before Adam. And I'd like for you just to to share a little of that with us if you would. and just take the time you need. I'm grateful, Pastor Shelley, for another time. The Bible has the answer. Yes, sir. God created Mhm. And the Bible says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he will call them. God created them. And he didn't give them names. So he wants Adam. Oh my. His son created in his image. That is his portion. Now this is going to show us that God has what he must do and what we his children must do. Mhm. For example, today if demon is troubling somebody and you stand there, oh God, come and cast out this devil out of this lady, God will not even hear you. Oh, because that is your job, right? There you go. He said you must do the casting of that demon. Hallelujah. Oh God, come and lay your hands on my sick boy to get healed. He'll be watching you. You must lay hand on the sick and they shall recover. Wow. So God is showing us we are laborers together with him. So Adam, I have done the creation. That is my portion. You do the naming. And the Bible says whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof. Wow. Adam had a little creative power in him. Yes sir. Because that is one of the characteristics of the Lord of God. Amen. So that is it. God is showing us that he has his part to play and we have our part to play. That's so powerful. God created the animals and he didn't name them on purpose. He he he did not name them on purpose because he was giving this assignment to his son who was made in the very image and the very likeness of God. Because it will not be God who will be watching over them. It will be his son. It was going to be Adam to be taking watching the animals. Wow. So I guess in some way Adam was reaching into the thoughts of God. He was reaching in to the mind of God because I feel like there must have been an agreement when he named them. We don't read where God said no no that's not what I was going to name it. And that was the name thereof sanction settled period on the end. M so I think uh I think we should be careful then what kind of name we put on something. If you give yourself the name cancer you give your name the you give yourself the name diabetes right that that is what you're naming it then the name shall it shall be that thereof that's it taken captive you are ens snared by your own words. Wow wow wow wow wow wow. So we want to name it something else. We want to we want to name it healed. If cancer comes, give cancer is your name. Yes. Yes. Give him the greatest name. Jesus. Okay. Okay. That's all. That's the solution. I'm filled with Jesus. Hallelujah. Jesus is taking over my life. I'm yielding myself to him. The name of Jesus is above your name. Cancer. Yes sir. M m so in that wonderful name out in the name of Jesus get out of my body you are a trespass because the spirit cancer is a spirit and they know they know that you when you should ask them to go in the name of Jesus they have to go right does this work they have to go does this work for the elderly as well as the young people because sometimes people say well uh the old those who have old age they're going to get sick sickness is just a part of being old. Do they have to accept it because they're age? Why do we become sick? Like you need personal experience with salvation when you are a sinner. Yes. One of the attributes of the Lord is Yahweh Rafa. Mhm. So you need personal experience of his healing power. Yes sir. And that can only come when you are sick. Okay. So when you call upon him and he heals you, then you can come to the church and say, "This is my personal testimony." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is indeed a healer. Amen. I've heard, but I've experience it. Amen. So then this sickness does not have to be my end, but rather it's an opportunity for God to display manifest his attributes to manifest and display one of his redemptive names. Yes. That he is the healer. Maybe somebody of yours passes on. Mhm. He has an attribute of being a comforter at that time. You need his you don't need him as a savior. Right. You don't need him as a healer. You need him as a comforter. Right. Right. Oh, that is so wonderful. It's so wonderful. Now, the other thing I wanted you to mention is is uh it's kind of a different subject entirely, but I was so touched by the way you brought this out. You were talking to us about the anointing of David by the prophet Samuel. And uh we know that the Bible speaks of Samuel as being a very particular kind of prophet. Yes. Because the Bible saidnone of his words, none of his words fell to the ground. I love that. And so we look at Samuel as a very highlevel prophet of God. Amen. And yet you showed us in the word where Samuel was about to make a mistake perhaps just based on what he saw or what he was thinking. Would you talk about that just a little bit? Because we believe there is a danger in the world today in the body of Christ. especially where people could speak presumptuously in the name of the Lord. And uh you know there's this whole thought that that that some prophets are infallible and there there's just a lot of things here and I think it's important to see Samuel as a man that God was using in a mighty way. So just speak about that a bit. Every man of God, every prophet of God. First of all, they are all a man sent from God. There you go. That's good. And not God sent from God. Right. Another thing about our God is that he will not share his glory no with any man. So any minister you come to a place where you are trying to glorify yourself, God will take you off the scene. Yeah. Let me give you an example. There was a great vision in Matthew 17 when Jesus was transfigured before the people and Moses and Elijah were speaking to him, right? You know what happened? Peter and the Peter and the rest said, "Lord, to be frank, let's make three tabernacles. One for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah. Where do you want to put Jesus in the same category? In the same tabernacle like Moses and Elijah?" No. Right there a voice spoke. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. Hear him. What happened to Moses and Elijah? Right? They just faded. And when they woke up of the vision, they saw no man. They didn't see Moses. They didn't see Elijah. Jesus only. Right from Genesis, every man of God made mistake. Yes. People are afraid to say the word mistake. Mhm. You miss and you take something. Yes. That is mistake. Yes. You are taking man to be God. Yes. H only God is infallible. He will allow everyone of his servants to make mistake so that we his children will not put our trust in any man but put our trust in God alone. Amen. Amen. We said it rightly. Samuel. Mhm. Here is Samuel in the scriptures. A prophet of God. Yes. And divine commission. Amen. To begin with, he was afraid to go. But God in the Old Testament is not a fearful God. He's not afraid. So you see the man's side of Samuel. If Saul Saul hears this, I'll be in problem. Is it God speaking? No. No, sir. So he went there and in the 1st Samuel chapter 16 and Jesse made his sons and called them to the sacrifice. And it came to pass when they were come that Samuel the prophet, right? You see, Gentiles, we are crazy people. The Jews, they will stone their prophets. But we Gentiles will worship prophets. Oh my. Gentiles are crazy people. M m Samuel looked an unaliable and he said surely surely the Lord's anointed is before him. So you cannot say that every word from the mouth of Samuel is that say yes the Lord I believe it all. No. No. It's dangerous. It's dangerous. This is on Samuel's tape. Mhm. Yes. And has been printed. Yes. And it was said by Samuel. Yes. But the Lord said unto him, "Look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him." There it is. A prophet. God does not show his prophets everything. No sir. Only God is omnisient. No prophet is all knowing up to today. Right? And if the Lord carries tomorrow, right? I believe you. And no prophet is infinite. Only that glory goes to the Lord. Amen. Who came in the flesh. Amen. Called Lord Jesus Christ. Right? So he was refused. Now they started coming somewhere is not careful. It's a lesson in the Bible. From that moment on, he didn't start speaking before he heard. He waited to hear. Thank you for that. Here is King David. Apart from being a king, he was also a prophet. Mhm. He had his heart's desire. And the Bible says the Lord will give you the desire of your heart. Yes. I want to build a tabernacle to the Lord. Mhm. Nathan, come. Uh-huh. Prophet come. This is my heart's desire. Yes. And Nathan just went and said, "Oh, perform it." Nathan said, "Yes, go do it." Mhm. It seemed good to Nathan. It was recorded on Nathan's sermon book. Yes. Yes. Yes. and printed for distribution. Nathan went back. Now God came down to tell Nathan, "No, go and tell David a different story." These are all examples for us to realize to make man man and God God. So the prophet's opinion is not necessarily thus saith the Lord. Every prophet is human. Mhm. Mhm. They have their opinion to express on any issue. Right. Sure. Let's realize that every prophet is a man, right? Sent from God. Right. Right. Let's permit them to express their human side. Let's permit them. Otherwise, they can't live on earth if everything is not they are humans, right? Of course. And but Abraham is no exception. No, he made it clear. Yes, he did. He made it clear. He certainly did. And because we believe that there are still prophets today according to the five-fold ministry, there are prophetic offices and gifts in the body of Christ. So, anyone who feels that they have this this prophetic insight or the gifts of the Holy Spirit operating, they should be very careful. If you should say something in the name of the Lord which the Lord has not spoken, but Abraham said you should go to hell for that. That's serious. Realize that you are operating within your own spirit. There you go. Good. Good way of explaining the enemy spirit and the spirit of God. Wow. Wow. So care must be taken when we are speaking in the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much for that wisdom. It was so effective in our church. And uh that's why I'm so thankful to the Lord again for uh letting you be in my life in our lives. We can learn from you. And uh I'm not going to tell people your age. I'm not going to do that. But I'm going to tell them that you have many more years experience on this earth than you look like you do. How about that? Amen. I'll just say that Pastor Tay is a good bit older than what he looks and he has many years of experience and I think we can learn from these powerful words that have been spoken. So again, we were honored to hear from you, pastor. Thank you so much for sharing with us. Thank you for the opportunity and God bless you. God bless you, sir. I'm grateful. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. [Music]
