[35:52] For I'm trained in my shackles
[35:57] for a glorious
[36:01] song.
[36:03] I
[36:05] praise the Lord. Free at last.
[36:10] [Music]
[36:12] Oh,
[36:14] I'm free
[36:16] from the fear
[36:19] of tomorrow.
[36:21] [Music]
[36:24] And I'm free
[36:27] from all the guilt of my past.
[36:36] For I'm trained
[36:38] in my shackles.
[36:41] For a glorious
[36:45] song,
[36:49] praise the Lord.
[36:59] Oh Lord, we just want to thank you for
[37:03] the freedom that you have given us
[37:05] through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[37:08] Christ. The price that you paid for us
[37:12] on Calvary that we could go free from
[37:16] all of our past. We do not have to carry
[37:20] it as baggage with us. You set us free
[37:24] from it. And we praise you today. That
[37:29] he whom the son makes free is free
[37:32] indeed.
[37:36] Lord, you don't have to die again. You
[37:39] don't have to pay another price. You did
[37:42] it once and for all. God, I thank you. I
[37:47] thank you that I identify in that price
[37:49] that you paid at Calvary. and I can walk
[37:53] free from guilt and condemnation and
[37:55] sin.
[37:57] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[38:00] I bless you.
[38:04] Praise the Lord.
[38:07] Hallelujah.
[38:11] He set us free.
[38:14] He set us free.
[38:22] Shake off the shackles.
[38:26] Drop the chains.
[38:29] Quit dragging them around.
[38:33] Free. Free indeed.
[38:36] Hallelujah.
[38:39] We have the opportunity to take our
[38:41] needs to the Lord today.
[38:44] He gave us such a privilege
[38:47] to carry our needs to him. That's right.
[38:50] And leave them.
[38:53] Do you have a need you want to make
[38:54] known by the lifting of the hand? All
[38:57] across the house today, out over the
[38:59] stream, the needs that you have, the
[39:01] Lord sees what they are. He knows best
[39:03] how to meet the need. Oh yes. He knows
[39:06] exactly what your need is. He knows
[39:08] every detail. We don't have to know, but
[39:11] he knows. We take them to him. Would you
[39:15] remember the believers youth camp in
[39:17] Fortville, Indiana this week? Many of
[39:20] the our friends are there the helping in
[39:23] that camp. We want to remember the young
[39:25] people of the camp asking the Lord that
[39:28] they would have a real breakthrough in
[39:30] the Holy Ghost. One, a breakthrough in
[39:33] the Holy Ghost that will not just carry
[39:35] them this week, but it will carry them
[39:38] on into the future.
[39:40] Let's pray for their pastors. they'll
[39:43] get set on fire. Amen. So that when they
[39:46] go home, they'll have an environment
[39:48] that will keep them going. Pray for some
[39:51] of the leaders who won't won't go in and
[39:53] won't get out of the way. That's the
[39:55] thing. It's getting very serious in
[39:58] these last days, isn't it? Uh would you
[40:01] pray for all those traveling? We have uh
[40:04] almost 40 people missing uh today. But
[40:08] look what a crowd we have anyway.
[40:10] Blessed. Isn't God good? God is good. Uh
[40:13] pray for all those who are traveling. Uh
[40:16] some will be home for next Sunday and
[40:19] some may not be. Some are leaving this
[40:22] week to go away. Uh we appreciate the
[40:25] fact that God is making a way for
[40:27] different ones to be with their family.
[40:29] There's a quite quite a group that's in
[40:31] Indiana this morning uh worshiping the
[40:35] Lord with the saints there. Pray for
[40:37] that service. Pray for those who are
[40:39] gathered there. Let's ask the Lord to
[40:42] continue to stir in us in a very deep
[40:46] place. Uh no more shallow. We don't need
[40:49] any shallow feelings. We need something
[40:52] deep. As we sung this morning, we need a
[40:55] move. And there is a move going on in
[40:59] me. And I'm asking the Lord to to
[41:02] increase it. And may it increase in all
[41:05] of us. Uh they tell me that sister Jada
[41:08] is still with her family today and for
[41:10] the next few days. Pray for them that
[41:13] God will keep them and uh comfort their
[41:16] hearts and give them strength to move
[41:18] past uh the loss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[41:24] Let's take all of these needs to the
[41:25] Lord today.
[41:29] In peace
[41:31] like a river
[41:36] attendeth
[41:39] my way.
[41:42] When sorrows
[41:46] like sea,
[41:48] billows
[41:49] roll.
[41:55] Whatever
[41:59] my lot
[42:02] taught
[42:04] me to say
[42:07] it.
[42:10] Brother Hawk, will you come and pray
[42:12] today, please?
[42:14] With my soul,
[42:21] it is well
[42:24] [Music]
[42:28] with my soul.
[42:34] It is well.
[42:38] It is well
[42:41] with my soul. Sing the first verse
[42:45] again.
[42:48] With peace
[42:51] like a river
[42:56] attendeth
[42:59] my way.
[43:02] When sorrow
[43:05] like sea belows
[43:09] grow.
[43:14] Oh, whatever
[43:19] my lot
[43:21] thou has taught
[43:24] me to sing.
[43:27] It is well.
[43:34] with my soul.
[43:41] It is well
[43:44] [Music]
[43:48] with my soul.
[43:54] It is
[44:02] [Music]
[44:14] Yes, Lord.
[44:18] We can say it because our heart is in
[44:22] your hands.
[44:24] All is well.
[44:30] I'm just so grateful today, Lord.
[44:36] I've been overwhelmed all morning
[44:40] to realize that you have called me,
[44:44] called us to be one with you.
[44:51] Sometimes we forget what the promise is,
[44:56] what the future holds. That's right.
[44:58] It's oneness.
[45:00] Amen.
[45:02] That was the plan all along.
[45:06] And also for some of us,
[45:10] we need to realize that you put all
[45:13] knowledge,
[45:15] all wisdom, all strength
[45:19] into Christ and then you put Christ
[45:24] into us. Hallelujah.
[45:27] May every stronghold that keeps that
[45:30] reality bow down be broken down in
[45:34] Jesus' name. And may the life of Jesus
[45:37] Christ rise up within us and reign and
[45:41] rule within our heart and the kingdom of
[45:44] God be established within the children
[45:47] of God for the glory of Jesus Christ. Oh
[45:52] God, would you come and make your
[45:56] Make your glory known
[45:58] [Music]
[46:00] in people that have been redeemed by the
[46:04] blood of the lamb of God. And that lamb
[46:07] was the king of kings. And he's taking
[46:10] his place in the people that he had in
[46:14] his mind from the foundation of the
[46:16] world. They're going to be humble.
[46:20] They're going to be full of love.
[46:22] That's going to be the motive of what
[46:25] everything they do is his love reigning
[46:29] and ruling in them.
[46:32] Oh God, what a plan.
[46:38] You gave them power to be a witness.
[46:42] Hallelujah.
[46:44] That witness in the Greek is martyr,
[46:48] living dead.
[46:50] The Holy Ghost ruling and reigning. Yes,
[46:55] that is what we long for. We were united
[47:00] with you in your death. We are united
[47:04] right now
[47:06] with you in resurrection.
[47:09] It's your life. It's the only thing that
[47:12] can satisfy the longing of our heart is
[47:15] your life. Everything else is deception.
[47:19] That's it.
[47:21] So we just refuse temptations, lies
[47:26] of the enemy. We want you, Jesus. We
[47:30] want to know you. We want to see you. We
[47:33] want to follow you. We want to obey you.
[47:36] We want to honor you with our lives. So
[47:39] come, oh God, do what you do. You're the
[47:43] God of wonders and miracles. There is
[47:46] something in my innermost being
[47:50] that is stirred when I hear these words.
[47:53] Father, come and do what you do in us
[47:57] and then through us for the glory of
[47:59] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:04] Thank you, Lord.
[48:07] Hallelujah.
[48:09] [Applause]
[48:12] Hallelujah.
[48:13] [Applause]
[48:17] Glory, glory, glory. You may have your
[48:20] seats today.
[48:25] We're blessed to be in the house of the
[48:27] Lord today.
[48:30] Happy to see all of you. Jessica, it's
[48:33] nice to see you today. The Lord bless
[48:35] you. We're glad that you're here. Maya
[48:38] Goss, it's good to have you back from
[48:40] traveling. May the Lord bless you today.
[48:44] Brother James Yantis, it's nice to see
[48:46] you. May the Lord bless you today. We're
[48:49] just glad to all be gathered together.
[48:51] Brother Daniel and Sister Anna made it
[48:53] through their nine states and back home
[48:55] safely. We're grateful to the Lord for
[48:58] that. God is good to us all the time. We
[49:03] want to receive the tithe and the
[49:05] offering today. We want to give as
[49:07] giving unto the Lord. Uh, so, Brother
[49:10] Elas, can I call on you and brother
[49:13] Austin Hodgeges, we're going to let
[49:14] these brothers come to you today and I'm
[49:17] going to do something just a little bit
[49:19] different. Brother Cade's going to sing
[49:20] after we take the offering. He didn't
[49:22] bring us this far to leave us. That is
[49:24] so true.
[49:29] He didn't bring us this far to leave us.
[49:34] Hey,
[49:36] he didn't teach us to swim, to let us
[49:40] drown.
[49:44] He didn't build his home in us, to move
[49:48] away.
[49:52] He didn't lift us up to let us down.
[49:56] [Music]
[49:59] He didn't bring us this far to leave us.
[50:07] He didn't teach us to swim to let us
[50:10] drown.
[50:11] [Music]
[50:14] He didn't build his home in us to move
[50:18] away.
[50:22] He didn't lift us up to let us down.
[50:29] He didn't bring us this far to leave us.
[50:35] [Music]
[50:37] He didn't teach us to swim, to let us
[50:40] drown.
[50:44] He didn't build his home in us, to move
[50:48] away.
[50:51] [Music]
[50:52] He didn't lift us up to let us down. one
[50:56] more time.
[50:59] He didn't bring us this far to leave us.
[51:07] He didn't teach us to swim, to let us
[51:10] drown.
[51:12] [Music]
[51:14] He didn't build his home in us, to move
[51:19] away.
[51:22] He didn't lift us up to let us down.
[51:29] [Music]
[51:31] Aren't you thankful?
[51:34] Thankful that he didn't start a work in
[51:37] you just to drop you,
[51:42] come and save you just to lose you in
[51:45] the end. That isn't who he is.
[51:50] He started it because he's big enough to
[51:53] finish it. He started it because he knew
[51:57] the entire predestined path of your
[52:00] life. And he knew that you would be able
[52:03] to make it through every twist, every
[52:06] turn, every detour, every mountain,
[52:09] every valley. He knew that he was strong
[52:12] enough to bring you through every one of
[52:15] them. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[52:20] Brother Cade, take us on into the
[52:22] preaching of the word today. Let's
[52:24] worship together with him. Hallelujah.
[52:34] [Music]
[52:44] It was such a lovely day.
[52:49] [Music]
[52:51] And the sun was shining
[52:54] bright.
[52:59] A gentle breeze
[53:01] was blowing my way.
[53:06] Not a storm cloud inside.
[53:09] [Music]
[53:13] Then suddenly,
[53:15] without a warning,
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] a storm surrounded
[53:24] my life.
[53:28] But even in the storm,
[53:33] I can feel the calm.
[53:36] And here's the reason
[53:39] why.
[53:44] I know the peace
[53:48] speaker.
[53:51] I know him by name.
[53:58] And I know a peace
[54:02] speaker.
[54:05] He controls the winds
[54:08] and the wind.
[54:13] when he says peace be still.
[54:19] Oh yes, they have to obey
[54:27] and I know the peace.
[54:34] Oh yes, I know him by name.
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] There's never been
[54:44] another man
[54:47] [Music]
[54:49] with the power of
[54:52] this bread.
[54:56] By simply saying, "Peace be still."
[55:03] He can come the strongest
[55:06] wind.
[55:08] [Music]
[55:11] So now I'll never worry
[55:16] [Music]
[55:18] when storm clouds come
[55:21] my way
[55:25] because I know that he is near
[55:29] to drive away my fear. And I can smile
[55:35] and
[55:36] say
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:40] that I know the peace
[55:44] speaker.
[55:47] Oh yes, I know him by name.
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:55] Oh, I know the peace
[55:59] speaker. Yes, I do. He controls the wind
[56:05] and the waves.
[56:08] [Music]
[56:09] And when he says peace, be still,
[56:14] [Music]
[56:16] will they have to obey?
[56:24] Cuz I know the peace
[56:28] speaker.
[56:30] Oh yes, I know him by name.
[56:35] [Music]
[56:39] And draw me nearer,
[56:44] nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where
[56:50] thou hast died.
[56:55] Draw me nearer.

[57:40] name.

[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:53] Thank God for peace,
[1:01:58] glorious,
[1:02:01] wonderful, magnified, multiplied
[1:02:04] peace.
[1:02:07] Woo.
[1:02:09] God bless you as you're seated today.
[1:02:13] We're so thankful for the wonderful
[1:02:15] presence of the Lord that's here. Amen.
[1:02:19] We certainly miss all of those who have
[1:02:22] traveled this weekend, but we are so
[1:02:25] grateful for the wonderful presence of
[1:02:28] the Lord. He was here during praise. He
[1:02:31] didn't leave us in worship and he's been
[1:02:34] with us ever since in the prayer, in the
[1:02:38] special song, and in every part of this
[1:02:41] service. He's here. He's real. He's God.
[1:02:45] He He's worthy. He deserves the highest
[1:02:48] praise.
[1:02:49] This is not an hour for the attitude any
[1:02:52] old praise will do. It won't. It won't.
[1:02:56] This is not a hallelujah anyhow hour.
[1:03:00] This is a hallelujah because he deserves
[1:03:03] a hallelujah.
[1:03:05] Amen. And uh even in the treading, even
[1:03:09] in the crushing,
[1:03:11] he deserves a shout.
[1:03:14] Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] The vintage shout.
[1:03:18] Aren't you glad? Hallelujah. Uh the Lord
[1:03:22] is with us. Let let me get a few things
[1:03:24] out of the way and we will uh do one
[1:03:27] more thing that I feel like the Lord has
[1:03:30] asked us to do. I want you to not just
[1:03:33] hear these requests for travelers and
[1:03:37] and not pray. I want you to pray because
[1:03:40] they're moving around quite a bit.
[1:03:42] They've driven a lot of them are in
[1:03:43] Indiana and then will make their way to
[1:03:45] Missouri and some are going
[1:03:48] in various other places. And so we want
[1:03:51] the Lord to be with them because I'm
[1:03:53] finding that in the four miles that I
[1:03:57] drive to church, to work, to to my
[1:03:59] office, I'm seeing craziness
[1:04:04] in four miles.
[1:04:06] People are on their phones. They're
[1:04:08] texting. They're digging something out
[1:04:10] of the floorboard. They are pulling out
[1:04:13] in front of people. They've built that
[1:04:15] nice barrier there at Bleecker on the
[1:04:18] other side to keep people most dangerous
[1:04:20] intersection on the highway to keep
[1:04:23] people from going straight across when
[1:04:25] there's not enough time to do so. So,
[1:04:27] what do you think the people are doing?
[1:04:29] I've seen four different people now pull
[1:04:32] to the right all the way around the
[1:04:35] barrier and then merge force themselves
[1:04:38] into the flow of traffic to stop and
[1:04:40] turn right. And uh you know that's
[1:04:43] pretty determined and it's pretty
[1:04:46] stupid.
[1:04:48] There's a spirit of stupid in the land
[1:04:51] and uh you've got to be on on guard. So
[1:04:55] if if I see things like that and and
[1:04:58] these Sedona people over here at Sedona
[1:05:01] Ridge,
[1:05:02] uh it don't matter to them whether
[1:05:05] you're coming down their 250. They own
[1:05:08] it, you know, and doesn't matter whether
[1:05:09] you're need to use it or not. they will
[1:05:12] pull right out in front of you. You
[1:05:13] better be watching for folks. Now, you
[1:05:16] say, "Why are you going through that?"
[1:05:18] Because I've seen what can happen. I've
[1:05:20] seen it in the spirit and I know what
[1:05:22] can happen if we're not being very
[1:05:24] careful. So, I want to give you that
[1:05:26] little uh prophetic warning just a tad
[1:05:29] that you would be very careful on the
[1:05:31] highway. If you don't if you need to be
[1:05:34] doing something else, do something else.
[1:05:37] Don't drive and do something else. And
[1:05:39] these folks are going hundreds of miles
[1:05:41] as brother Daniel and sister Anna have
[1:05:44] just covered nine states. Uh uh that's a
[1:05:46] lot of miles. It's the great I tell you
[1:05:48] you we ought to thank God
[1:05:51] after I've seen some of that craziness.
[1:05:53] I've been thanking God every time I get
[1:05:55] home safe from here.
[1:05:58] And maybe that's what it's about. Just
[1:06:00] to give us a reminder that we need to
[1:06:02] praise him. And so I would like for you
[1:06:05] certainly to do that and keep that in
[1:06:07] mind. Um, even as others are leaving
[1:06:10] this week to go away for for this time
[1:06:13] when you got time off work. Well, then
[1:06:14] of course that's a time people need to
[1:06:16] go and we understand that and we're but
[1:06:19] we're covering them. We don't forget
[1:06:21] about them. Somebody said, "Well, oh,
[1:06:23] it'd be so nice, you know, to go where
[1:06:25] there's hardly any cell phone service
[1:06:27] and uh, you know, no nothing really
[1:06:30] pressing and you just can just relax and
[1:06:33] and and and so forth. I don't know that
[1:06:36] life. I don't even know what that means.
[1:06:39] I've never understood that. Uh because I
[1:06:42] can't do that. I better have my phone
[1:06:45] handy because somebody somewhere may
[1:06:47] need me.
[1:06:50] You understand? And so we have to find
[1:06:52] our relaxation in another place. You
[1:06:55] know where I find mine? In his presence.
[1:06:58] In his presence. He can do more for us
[1:07:01] in just a few seconds in his presence
[1:07:04] than uh than we could get in a a
[1:07:06] Caribbean holiday. Amen. There'll be
[1:07:10] time for all that relaxation in eternity
[1:07:14] because there will be no expiration date
[1:07:16] on eternity. Aren't you glad? This is a
[1:07:19] busy week and our dear uh sweet Natana
[1:07:24] uh in in the Netherlands has a birthday
[1:07:27] today. How did she get to be 24 years
[1:07:30] old? I think that's right. How in the
[1:07:33] world did that happen? We want to wish
[1:07:34] her a very happy birthday. Today, uh,
[1:07:38] tomorrow on Monday, June 30th, is Sister
[1:07:42] Rebecca Goss's birthday. And when I was
[1:07:45] just for my own record, not not to
[1:07:47] mention it, I'm not going to mention it,
[1:07:48] but for my own record, I was just adding
[1:07:51] up the years. I gave you I I spared you
[1:07:54] a decade. And I said, "How is she just
[1:07:58] that?" And then I recounted,
[1:08:02] "Uh, but you're still young and and red
[1:08:05] this morning. Now she's really red."
[1:08:08] I didn't mean to make her turn tomato
[1:08:10] color, but uh and it's also Benjamin and
[1:08:14] Jenna's wedding anniversary. Uh we
[1:08:17] should really bless Jenna because she
[1:08:19] certainly deserves it. And lots of
[1:08:21] prayer. Three years. God bless you all
[1:08:25] this week.
[1:08:29] I guess that means Nana and Pap get to
[1:08:32] have the baby girl for one evening while
[1:08:34] you all go out and celebrate. And then
[1:08:37] on Wednesday is Sister Alita's birthday.
[1:08:40] She's away and uh we want to wish her
[1:08:43] safety and uh pray over her and uh also
[1:08:47] wish her a happy birthday. And she
[1:08:49] shares a birthday with Sister Jeffrey
[1:08:51] who's not in here at the moment. She's
[1:08:53] probably with a twin somewhere, but uh
[1:08:56] she's got a birthday and and it's one of
[1:08:58] those that has a zero on the end,
[1:09:00] Jennifer. But uh I'll let you I'll let
[1:09:03] you all figure that out. God has been
[1:09:05] good. Sister Jeffrey is a hardworking
[1:09:10] lady and has been a long time. Let's
[1:09:14] see. I've I've known her over 30 years
[1:09:18] and she has worked hard during that
[1:09:21] time. It has been the grace of God.
[1:09:24] Sister Beverly, she shares a birthday
[1:09:26] with our nation.
[1:09:28] She's not quite as old as our nation.
[1:09:32] Thank the Lord for that. But her,
[1:09:36] we're not talking about feeling. We're
[1:09:37] talking about real age.
[1:09:40] But uh you'll never be able to forget
[1:09:43] Sister Beverly's birthday. It's July the
[1:09:45] 4th and people are always uh shooting
[1:09:48] fireworks off to celebrate her birthday.
[1:09:52] all over the country. And uh my kids are
[1:09:55] already talking about where they're
[1:09:56] going to go and watch them. And I I want
[1:09:59] you to know I am uh not just a Scrooge
[1:10:02] at uh holiday time in December, but I'm
[1:10:05] one in July 4th, too, because for me, if
[1:10:09] you've seen one explosion,
[1:10:12] you've sort of seen them all. But they
[1:10:15] sure do get excited about about watching
[1:10:17] it. Uh, I'm a little noise sensitive
[1:10:20] myself and uh I don't enjoy uh what
[1:10:24] sounds like I'm being shot at. You know,
[1:10:26] it's just not pleasure for me. But God
[1:10:28] is good.
[1:10:32] Saturday, July the 5th is Kendra's
[1:10:35] birthday, and I asked her husband how
[1:10:37] old she was going to be, and he told me,
[1:10:39] and then his next two words were,
[1:10:41] "That's old."
[1:10:45] And and and I, "Well, what about you?" I
[1:10:47] said it. And and at least she has her
[1:10:50] hair.
[1:10:54] It's also Brother David Gosman's
[1:10:56] birthday. A very faithful streamer on
[1:10:59] Saturday, July the 5th. And did he turn
[1:11:02] red at all? A little. A little. A
[1:11:05] little. God bless all of you. And this
[1:11:10] is a birthday week for the Jacksons. We
[1:11:12] love them. Brother uh Dwayne and Sister
[1:11:14] Heather both have birthdays this week.
[1:11:16] and we want to uh remember them in
[1:11:19] prayer that God will use them for his
[1:11:21] glory. Well, I want you to stand again
[1:11:24] real quick
[1:11:26] and I want to do something. I want to
[1:11:29] sing something that we would never sing.
[1:11:31] Let's have Mirabth back and you you give
[1:11:33] me some good old B3 uh over there. And
[1:11:39] this is a song we just would never sing
[1:11:41] on a Sunday morning. But I'm singing it
[1:11:43] for a reason. And I'll tell you what
[1:11:46] that reason is in just a minute. I'm
[1:11:47] going to the enemy's camp.
[1:11:50] Let's sing. Been a long time, but let's
[1:11:53] everybody sing it. Well, I'm going to
[1:11:57] the enemy's camp. I'm going to take back
[1:12:01] what he stole from me. I'm going to the
[1:12:05] enemy's camp to proclaim my victory.
[1:12:10] I've got him under my feet. Under my
[1:12:15] feet. Under my feet. Oh, he's under my
[1:12:19] feet. I'm claiming
[1:12:22] the victory.
[1:12:24] Let's sing it. Well, I'm going to the
[1:12:29] enemy's camp. I'm going to take back
[1:12:33] what he stole from me. Well, I'm going

[1:13:11] proclaim my victory. I've got him.
[1:13:17] Where is he?
[1:13:19] Oh, under my feet. He's under my feet.
[1:13:23] I'm proclaiming
[1:13:25] the victory.
[1:13:28] I'm not going to do it till it feels
[1:13:30] right. When I'm going to the enemy's
[1:13:34] camp, I'm going to take back.
[1:13:39] Well, I'm going to the enemy's camp to
[1:13:43] proclaim my victory. I've got him under
[1:13:48] my feet. Under my feet. Under my feet.
[1:13:53] He under my feet. I'm claiming.
[1:13:58] Woo!
[1:14:00] Yeah.
[1:14:01] Let me hear you sing without me. Oh, I'm
[1:14:04] going.
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:11] Well, I'm going
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:32] You obviously need my help. So, here
[1:14:34] I'll help you do this time. I'm going to
[1:14:37] the enemy's camp. I'm going to take back
[1:14:42] what he stole from me. Going to the
[1:14:46] enemy's camp. I'm going to proclaim
[1:14:50] right in the devil's face. Got him under
[1:14:53] my feet. Under my feet. Under my feet.
[1:14:58] He's under my feet. Claim it.
[1:15:03] You got to announce something when you
[1:15:05] get there. You got to tell him, "Well,
[1:15:08] I'm going to the enemy's camp. I'm going
[1:15:12] to take back.
[1:15:16] Well, I'm going to the enemy's camp to
[1:15:20] proclaim my victory.
[1:15:24] I got him under my feet.
[1:15:28] Under my feet.
[1:15:32] Oh, claiming
[1:15:34] victory
[1:15:36] glory land.
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:16:10] I said I'm going to the enemy's camp. I
[1:16:15] plan to take back what he stole from me.
[1:16:19] I'm going to the enemy's camp in Jesus
[1:16:22] name to proclaim my victory.
[1:16:26] I've got him under my feet. Under my
[1:16:30] feet. Under my feet. He's under my feet.
[1:16:35] I'm claiming
[1:16:39] one last time.
[1:16:42] Oh, church. Let's go now to the enemy's
[1:16:45] camp and take back
[1:16:50] Oh, I'm going to the enemy's camp to
[1:16:54] proclaim
[1:16:56] my victory. I've got him under my feet.
[1:17:03] Under my feet.
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:11] Yeah.
[1:17:13] I said I'm claiming
[1:17:16] the victory to
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:31] Hallelujah.
[1:17:34] I said I'm claiming
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:39] the victory
[1:17:42] to
[1:17:48] one last time. I'm claiming
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:53] the victory
[1:17:56] to
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:00] re
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:03] I am. I am
[1:18:08] Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:18] Did you know the Bible tells us
[1:18:22] in Proverbs chapter 6
[1:18:26] and verse 31
[1:18:30] concerning a thief?
[1:18:33] But if he be found,
[1:18:38] that means caught right, identified,
[1:18:42] exposed,
[1:18:44] he shall restore
[1:18:47] sevenfold.
[1:18:50] Praise God. Somebody say, "That's a
[1:18:53] lot." That's a lot. And that is
[1:18:55] completion and perfection. Cuz even if
[1:18:59] the enemy just stole $100,
[1:19:02] he owes you seven times that back.
[1:19:06] Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. Not just one fold.
[1:19:11] Sevenfold.
[1:19:13] He shall give all
[1:19:16] the substance of his house.
[1:19:19] Amen.
[1:19:21] Uh uh if you were to look at that in in
[1:19:25] some of the other versions, it even gets
[1:19:28] a little bigger.
[1:19:31] Uh
[1:19:34] one version says giving up all his
[1:19:38] property which is in his house.
[1:19:42] One said he must give up all the wealth
[1:19:44] of his house.
[1:19:46] One said he must give all the riches of
[1:19:49] his house, all the wealth that he owns.
[1:19:53] Complete Jewish Bible, Derby, all the
[1:19:57] substance of his house.
[1:19:59] One translation says, "Give up
[1:20:02] everything he has until he has paid back
[1:20:08] sevenfold."
[1:20:10] That's not my word.
[1:20:12] That's what the Bible said. Don't get
[1:20:15] tough, tight, or whatever. It's just
[1:20:18] what he said.
[1:20:20] Uh, in other words, if he has to give
[1:20:23] everything he's got, all of his wealth,
[1:20:27] all of his property to pay back seven
[1:20:30] times what he has stolen, the Bible said
[1:20:33] he has to do it.
[1:20:36] And that's any thief. Anybody who steals
[1:20:39] what doesn't belong to them. Well, the
[1:20:42] enemy is a thief. That's right,
[1:20:45] isn't he? He's the one that inspires
[1:20:47] others to steal.
[1:20:49] No doubt about it. And the Bible tells
[1:20:51] us that he comes to steal.
[1:20:56] Cleptes.
[1:20:58] Kill. To steal. To kill and what?
[1:21:02] Destroy. To destroy. He doesn't want
[1:21:04] just gnaw your arm. He wants to devour
[1:21:08] you. Yes, sir. He wants you to be lunch.
[1:21:12] Hallelujah. Yeah. Till there's nothing
[1:21:15] left. But if but if you realize
[1:21:18] where the thief is and who the thief is,
[1:21:21] you serve notice on him, then you got to
[1:21:24] pay back what you've taken. And not only
[1:21:27] onefold, but sevenfold. Some people say
[1:21:31] that's just seven. Other people say
[1:21:33] that's really eightfold because you have
[1:21:36] have to the laws of restoration are
[1:21:39] you've got to pay back what you took.
[1:21:42] The laws of restitution are you add to
[1:21:45] it the portion that is required. So it's
[1:21:48] somewhere between seven times and eight
[1:21:51] times that the thief has to give back.
[1:21:54] Has anybody in here ever had the devil,
[1:21:56] the enemy, the the original kleptomaniac
[1:22:00] steal anything out of your life?
[1:22:04] Yes, sir. Well, now he has to give it
[1:22:06] back. And and and maybe you think it has
[1:22:09] to be exactly what he took, but that's
[1:22:11] not the way that works.
[1:22:15] He may have taken money right out of
[1:22:17] your pocket, but but doesn't matter.
[1:22:19] Maybe it's a house.
[1:22:21] May maybe it's it may not come in the
[1:22:24] currency
[1:22:25] with which he took it. That's right. But
[1:22:28] it has to be the value
[1:22:31] seven times or eight times. And uh if
[1:22:35] you don't serve notice on him, I'm
[1:22:37] telling you, if you don't tell him to
[1:22:38] pay up,
[1:22:41] how many of you have ever been in
[1:22:42] business and you've had to go looking
[1:22:45] for somebody?
[1:22:48] Ever had to call anybody? You ever had
[1:22:50] to text anybody and remind them what
[1:22:52] they owe?
[1:22:54] Well, you know that's what you're going
[1:22:56] to have to do with the devil. You You'll
[1:22:58] have to tell He is never going to just
[1:23:01] feel good one morning and bring you what
[1:23:03] he would like for you to have. He don't
[1:23:05] want you to have anything. He didn't
[1:23:07] want you to have that. That's why he
[1:23:09] stole it from you. Wasn't going to do
[1:23:11] him any good, but he didn't want you to
[1:23:13] have it. And so therefore,
[1:23:17] uh you've got to serve the notice.
[1:23:19] You've got to go to the enemy in in
[1:23:21] authority and tell him, "Look, you're
[1:23:23] caught.
[1:23:25] You are in a between a rock and a hard
[1:23:27] place and and I want it now. I want now
[1:23:31] what you have owed." And there are es
[1:23:33] and flows. There are seasons of
[1:23:36] restoration. There are seasons of
[1:23:38] restitution. Somebody say, "Where did
[1:23:40] you get that?" The Bible, book of Acts.
[1:23:44] It talks about the restitution of all
[1:23:47] things. And remember, restitution is not
[1:23:50] just restoring what was stolen, but it's
[1:23:53] that added portion on the top. And
[1:23:56] that's what the last day bride has been
[1:23:58] promised. Not just a restoration of what
[1:24:01] has been stolen through the church ages,
[1:24:04] but also a portion on top of that for
[1:24:07] her sorrow, for her trouble, for her
[1:24:10] heartache. Have you ever paid somebody
[1:24:12] what they what they uh charged you and
[1:24:15] then you give them a little something
[1:24:17] and say uh this is for your extra
[1:24:19] trouble or this is a tip or something
[1:24:22] like that. Uh you know there's certain
[1:24:25] places you go with me and you'll watch
[1:24:28] people uh uh break their neck to get to
[1:24:30] my table.
[1:24:33] A and and I promise you that is because
[1:24:35] they know
[1:24:37] that I believe in giving somebody a
[1:24:40] little extra portion especially if they
[1:24:43] give me e extra service but remember
[1:24:46] what brother Brandham told us we give it
[1:24:48] whether we get the service or not
[1:24:50] because we don't know what that person
[1:24:52] is going through and you can sit there
[1:24:55] with a pompous attitude and say well the
[1:24:57] the employer ought to pay them and and
[1:25:00] I'm not responsible for pay aren't you
[1:25:02] glad that people don't treat you that
[1:25:04] way. Say amen. And then invite them to
[1:25:08] church after you've stiffed them out of
[1:25:09] a tip. Huh? I don't think they're going
[1:25:13] to be running after you for anything.
[1:25:16] Now, uh there are some folks that have
[1:25:19] worked hard over the past few months and
[1:25:23] have not been paid.
[1:25:27] And I want you to know that I didn't
[1:25:29] know until in the evening last night
[1:25:32] that the enemy was in this mix. I
[1:25:36] thought it when I prayed, I felt some
[1:25:39] resistance. And I've mentioned it uh
[1:25:42] recently,
[1:25:44] but I didn't know just what it was like.
[1:25:47] But in in prayer last night, I saw that
[1:25:50] there is a thief in the mix
[1:25:53] who wants his hand in it.
[1:25:56] And and the way some of these kinds of
[1:25:58] things work is it gets filtered down.
[1:26:02] You know, you've got all these people
[1:26:04] working above you who who who are
[1:26:06] brokers, you know, and it's like that in
[1:26:09] a lot of different situations
[1:26:11] and and they get money just for their
[1:26:14] trouble, just for arranging things. And
[1:26:16] then it comes down and they're
[1:26:18] contractors and subcontractors and and
[1:26:21] whatever else. And I saw uh uh somebody
[1:26:25] in the mix who who has determined to
[1:26:29] steal what doesn't belong to him for
[1:26:32] some of these folks that I know in this
[1:26:34] body haven't been paid. And it took a
[1:26:37] while before it started affecting the
[1:26:39] church finance. But it has now this last
[1:26:43] month has been the hardest month we've
[1:26:45] had in several years. But God's grace
[1:26:49] has brought us through. just been a
[1:26:51] little slower, a little slower paying
[1:26:53] the bill. Nothing past due. Nothing on
[1:26:56] the due date, but few hours away. God's
[1:27:00] made it. He's taken care of it because
[1:27:02] it finally caught up with us. It takes
[1:27:04] some time, but it finally caught up with
[1:27:07] us. But that wasn't what got me moving.
[1:27:08] I was praying way before it started
[1:27:12] affecting the the church and my family.
[1:27:15] But in this experience, I saw that it
[1:27:20] wasn't everybody who was crooked. In
[1:27:23] fact, I saw there were good-hearted
[1:27:25] people involved that were just as
[1:27:28] desperate for there to be a move in that
[1:27:31] as others. But I saw one who had already
[1:27:35] hatched like an egg a plan to steal some
[1:27:40] of what h he had nothing to do with. He
[1:27:43] has inserted himself
[1:27:45] in a situation that he shouldn't be in.
[1:27:48] And boy, folks will do it to take
[1:27:49] advantage. I want you to pray with me
[1:27:52] right now. Somebody said, "Well, it
[1:27:53] doesn't affect me." Well, it affects
[1:27:55] people you love. And I'm not going to
[1:27:57] tell you who they are. Maybe some of you
[1:28:00] already know by their own testimony, but
[1:28:02] I'm not going to say their name. I'm not
[1:28:04] going to embarrass them. But I'm going
[1:28:07] to tell you that it has now ro rocked on
[1:28:10] and rolled on and uh they h they have
[1:28:14] they have been in a in a a a jam
[1:28:18] be because when you when you do a job I
[1:28:21] know you're standing if you're able if
[1:28:22] you're not sit but uh when you do a job
[1:28:25] like that you sometime have to put up
[1:28:28] upfront expense money rent equipment or
[1:28:32] whatever and look you you can't always
[1:28:35] tell uh brother Joe Blow over there, you
[1:28:39] can't always say, well now they're going
[1:28:40] to pay me soon
[1:28:43] and so just let me have this until such
[1:28:46] and such. There used to be a day we're
[1:28:48] not in that day anymore and everybody
[1:28:50] needs their money, right? And so there's
[1:28:53] a lot of expense that is involved and
[1:28:55] that makes me so mad at the devil how he
[1:28:58] would not only try to hold up here. I
[1:29:01] thought most of the time we're praying
[1:29:02] for these people against a holdup. And
[1:29:06] and and I was told that's exactly right.
[1:29:10] But not a hold up, a hold up, you know,
[1:29:15] and let's pray right now. Let's come
[1:29:17] into agreement that the thief will be
[1:29:20] exposed
[1:29:22] and that that money will be released to
[1:29:25] these dear people of God who have done
[1:29:29] the work and done a good job at it.
[1:29:31] Father, we stand right now on behalf of
[1:29:36] our brothers who have labored and
[1:29:39] labored and sacrificed
[1:29:42] and have not been paid. Lord, we knew uh
[1:29:47] began to know that the enemy was holding
[1:29:50] things up, but we didn't know that it
[1:29:52] was more or less like a mask and a gun
[1:29:56] that the enemy had so trespassed
[1:29:59] that he intended to try to steal
[1:30:02] something that he had not worked for.
[1:30:04] But today in the authority of the word,
[1:30:08] in the authority of the blood of Jesus
[1:30:12] Christ, we expose the thief.
[1:30:23] in the name of Jesus.
[1:30:27] I It's not up to me to bring him to
[1:30:30] justice, but it is up to me to to loose
[1:30:35] what has been held up so that those
[1:30:39] brothers can have what is coming to
[1:30:42] them. And I am asking Lord that it would
[1:30:47] not only be the the do but that somehow
[1:30:52] some way there would have to be
[1:30:55] something on top of that. Whether it
[1:30:59] comes in in a monetary way or in a way
[1:31:02] of favor. It doesn't matter to me how it
[1:31:05] comes. But I am taking as a body of
[1:31:08] believers. We're joining together to
[1:31:10] take authority over the works of
[1:31:12] darkness
[1:31:14] that have desired to destroy.
[1:31:20] Wasn't just to hinder, but it was to
[1:31:23] bankrupt.
[1:31:24] The enemy wanted somebody to lose
[1:31:29] what was theirs. And so we stand in the
[1:31:33] name of Jesus Christ believing
[1:31:37] that it has to be loosed
[1:31:41] and we're calling that in
[1:31:44] in the exposing. And if justice is
[1:31:47] required then grant it. If it's
[1:31:51] necessary
[1:31:53] for full exposure, grant it. Whatever is
[1:31:57] necessary. And now because I felt very
[1:32:01] strongly this morning that there are
[1:32:02] others in this room who have situations
[1:32:05] that I am unaware of where the enemy has
[1:32:08] stolen and and it's just hung and hung
[1:32:11] and hung. So, I'm going to I'm just
[1:32:13] going to hop on the anointing of that,
[1:32:16] and I'm going to pray for any person
[1:32:19] under the sound of my voice, whether
[1:32:21] it's local or on the stream that has had
[1:32:24] something stolen from them in whatever
[1:32:28] form. We are taking authority over the
[1:32:32] lies of the enemy and his thiefy, the
[1:32:36] way that he connives and hatches out
[1:32:39] plots and plans.
[1:32:42] And we are approaching a a a season on
[1:32:47] the calendar where we have uh
[1:32:49] traditionally watched the enemy uh steal
[1:32:53] and suck the life out of those who have
[1:32:57] laid their shoulder to the plow. Not
[1:33:00] quite there yet, but let's get some
[1:33:02] business done today. In the authority of
[1:33:06] the word of God, we say give it back.
[1:33:11] In the name of Jesus,
[1:33:14] it's the hour for the bride to have not
[1:33:18] only restoration
[1:33:20] but restitution.
[1:33:23] Oh, shake insurance companies if that is
[1:33:27] required. Shake government agencies if
[1:33:31] that's what's required. Lord, it doesn't
[1:33:34] matter to us how you do it.
[1:33:40] But we want it done
[1:33:43] because it's not only hindered
[1:33:46] individuals and their uh private
[1:33:48] affairs, it has been uh a stress to the
[1:33:53] work of God. And that really really
[1:33:57] ought not to be. So we thank you Lord. I
[1:34:02] I just uh feel like singing but I need
[1:34:05] to preach but I just about feel like
[1:34:07] singing. The windows of heaven are open.
[1:34:10] Hallelujah.
[1:34:12] Arabah in Hebrew. Arabah.
[1:34:16] Aruba.
[1:34:18] Loose those slle gates.
[1:34:22] Open up the windows of heaven
[1:34:26] and loose what is owed.
[1:34:31] Let it be for others right now in this
[1:34:34] house.
[1:34:36] In the name
[1:34:38] of Jesus,
[1:34:40] may we be better stewards. May we be
[1:34:44] wiser in our decisions.
[1:34:48] May we always put your kingdom first
[1:34:52] because all these things shall be added
[1:34:55] to us. If first we seek the good of the
[1:34:59] kingdom. If first we desire the good of
[1:35:03] the kingdom. If first we pray for the
[1:35:06] good of the kingdom, all these things
[1:35:09] shall be added. Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] Sevenfold.
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:16] On top of that, we claim in the
[1:35:19] authority of Jesus.
[1:35:22] Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] Even for streamers, I have to keep
[1:35:32] saying that. Even for streamers.
[1:35:36] Hallelujah. We believe it.
[1:35:39] Thank you, Lord. Sing with me twice
[1:35:41] through. Oh yes, the answer's on the
[1:35:43] way. I know this is a strange Sunday
[1:35:45] morning. Sing this. Oh yes, the answer's
[1:35:49] on the way. This I know.
[1:35:53] Jesus said, I believe.
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:57] Our heavenly father knows the need.
[1:36:00] Before we pray,
[1:36:02] you can rest assure the answers on the
[1:36:05] way.
[1:36:07] Oh yes, the answer's on the way. I know.
[1:36:12] Jesus said, "And I believe in adance.
[1:36:17] Our heavenly father knows the need."
[1:36:23] And I say twice, I mean three times. Oh
[1:36:26] yes, the answer's on the way.
[1:36:30] I feel it moving
[1:36:33] and it's
[1:36:36] our heavenly father knows the need
[1:36:38] before we pray.
[1:36:40] And you can rest assured the answer's on
[1:36:43] the way.
[1:36:45] And you can rest assured the answer's on
[1:36:48] the way.
[1:36:50] And you can rest assured the answer's on
[1:36:53] the way.
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you. We thank
[1:37:00] you. We thank you. We thank you. We
[1:37:03] thank you right now. We praise you.
[1:37:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:12] We praise you,
[1:37:16] Lord. This people have they've never
[1:37:18] been a money-driven people. This has
[1:37:21] never been a money-driven church because
[1:37:24] you have always supplied our needs.
[1:37:28] But if there is business that needs to
[1:37:30] be taken care of, I want to hear it and
[1:37:35] do something about it. Glory be to God.
[1:37:39] Would you thank the Lord for these
[1:37:41] musicians?
[1:37:43] No.
[1:37:45] Labor of love.
[1:37:50] Jeremiah 48
[1:37:52] and 11. And I'll try to keep in mind
[1:37:55] that
[1:37:57] uh we've already taken some time.
[1:38:05] Moab
[1:38:07] hath been at ease
[1:38:11] from his youth. I want just a tad more
[1:38:15] in the monitor. Just a tad.
[1:38:19] Moab
[1:38:21] hath been at ease from his youth, and he
[1:38:25] hath settled
[1:38:28] on his leaves
[1:38:31] dregs,
[1:38:33] and hath not been emptied
[1:38:36] from vessel
[1:38:38] to vessel, neither hath he gone into
[1:38:42] captivity. Therefore, his taste remained
[1:38:46] in him.
[1:38:49] It's not enough.
[1:38:52] And his aroma, his scent is not changed.
[1:38:57] He stinks of the flesh. He smells
[1:39:03] of the sin of his forefather.
[1:39:06] He has not cooperated
[1:39:09] with God's program
[1:39:12] to leave behind
[1:39:14] the pain, the ugliness,
[1:39:19] the attitudes of the past. So he just
[1:39:23] keeps taking it with him on this journey
[1:39:27] and it has bittered his wine
[1:39:31] and it has affected his aroma.
[1:39:35] And if you go on to read, God said, "And
[1:39:38] that's why I'm going to have to deal
[1:39:40] with him the way I'm going to deal with
[1:39:42] him." And he raised up Babylon, Persia.
[1:39:47] You know where Persia is? He raised up
[1:39:51] Babylon
[1:39:53] Do you know where uh the gates of
[1:39:56] beautiful gardens of Babylon were? Do
[1:39:59] you know where these things took place?
[1:40:02] Right in that region of Iraq and Iran.
[1:40:06] So it's just even today
[1:40:10] this thing is repeated again and again
[1:40:13] and again. And God uses everything. The
[1:40:17] scripture said everything in that Old
[1:40:19] Testament, everything in the newer
[1:40:21] testament is for our instruction.
[1:40:26] It's there. Somebody said, "I'm not a
[1:40:28] moabitete." Well, first of all, you
[1:40:30] don't really have any way of knowing
[1:40:31] that. But but spiritually we can be
[1:40:35] under that kind of an influence because
[1:40:38] we feel so entitled
[1:40:41] that we don't let God put us in his
[1:40:44] shaker and shake us and blend us and
[1:40:48] drain us and purify us. And we think the
[1:40:52] whole economy of God revolves around us,
[1:40:55] our whim, our desire, our children, our
[1:40:58] this, our that. And we miss this thing
[1:41:01] sometime. But I want you to know the
[1:41:03] kingdom is bigger than you. It's bigger
[1:41:05] than your house. It's bigger than this
[1:41:08] church.
[1:41:10] It's even bigger than this message.
[1:41:14] Amen.
[1:41:16] And we've got to find out if there's
[1:41:18] something that we need to do. So,
[1:41:20] Father, we thank you for this precious
[1:41:23] body of Christ that is gathered here
[1:41:25] today. We're not trying to make up for
[1:41:28] anybody that's not here. We're just
[1:41:30] trying to be at our place, our post, our
[1:41:34] position. We thank you, Lord, that you
[1:41:36] didn't take a holiday. That you stayed
[1:41:39] with us. Your presence has been here.
[1:41:42] You've been helping us do your bidding
[1:41:45] and your business. We thank you for the
[1:41:47] anointing to get it done in the name of
[1:41:50] the Lord Jesus Christ. And we ask today
[1:41:54] that you would speak to us,
[1:41:57] not someone who's not here. But talk to
[1:42:01] us first, Lord. We're here and we need
[1:42:06] your voice and we need your leadership
[1:42:09] and your guidance. I still feel
[1:42:11] something on what we were praying about
[1:42:13] a minute ago. I think there are more
[1:42:16] connections in that kind of an
[1:42:18] assignment than what we realize. So if
[1:42:21] you didn't get your request in, your bid
[1:42:24] in, get it in, get your bid in now. If
[1:42:27] the Lord brings something to your mind
[1:42:29] during this service where you believe
[1:42:31] the enemy had then you put that be it in
[1:42:35] and believe that God will give you
[1:42:38] hallelujah not only restoration but
[1:42:42] restitution be with us now in the
[1:42:45] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:48] and for his glory. The saint said you
[1:42:50] may be seated. Brother Brent is here
[1:42:53] today. He expected to be here with his
[1:42:56] wife and son, but they were a part of
[1:42:59] that over 600 flights that were
[1:43:01] cancelled yesterday because of weather
[1:43:04] and hail damage all across the nation.
[1:43:07] So, we're believing that they will come
[1:43:09] in this evening, this afternoon. And uh
[1:43:13] they were they said there were more
[1:43:14] people sleeping in the floors in Atlanta
[1:43:17] than have been in the airport than have
[1:43:19] been in a long time because how quickly
[1:43:21] the weather rolled in all the way across
[1:43:24] the mid part of the United States. These
[1:43:27] are unusual times that we're living in.
[1:43:30] But none of it, let me say it again,
[1:43:32] none of it catches God by surprise.
[1:43:36] All things are for a reason. When it
[1:43:39] touches you, it's already touched him to
[1:43:43] get to you.
[1:43:45] It's already touched him. You're the
[1:43:48] apple of his eye. You are the reflection
[1:43:51] in his eye. If you could see his eye, do
[1:43:54] you know what you'd see in his eye?
[1:43:55] You'd see you. Because that's what the
[1:43:58] apple of the eye is. It's the mirrored
[1:44:00] reflection of the person that's being
[1:44:03] looked at. So, if you are the apple of
[1:44:06] his eye, guess what it means? He's
[1:44:07] looking at you
[1:44:10] and you're showing up in his eye. You're
[1:44:13] on his radar. He knows your address and
[1:44:18] he knows your name and he knows your
[1:44:20] need. Hallelujah. And he knows how to
[1:44:24] deliver it to your address.
[1:44:27] Praise be to God. I'm a little wild
[1:44:29] feeling. Glory be to God.
[1:44:35] Marabos.
[1:44:37] So we are how
[1:44:44] we're talking about the journey from the
[1:44:48] from the vineyard
[1:44:50] to the chalice
[1:44:53] of the king, the king's cup. There is a
[1:44:58] process to get the grape all the way
[1:45:02] through so that it ends up emptied
[1:45:08] skin left behind. How many of you want
[1:45:12] to leave your old tough hide,
[1:45:16] tough skin, bad stuff? You you have
[1:45:20] hardened because of the circumstances of
[1:45:23] your life. And that hard skin keeps you
[1:45:27] from being pliable and moldable in the
[1:45:30] service of the Lord. So he wants you to
[1:45:32] leave that junk behind and only the
[1:45:35] juice, that's the good part of who you
[1:45:37] are, goes on to the next step, the next
[1:45:39] step. And one day, bless God in the new
[1:45:42] kingdom. You become and even now we
[1:45:46] become the a gift in his hand. We become
[1:45:48] a vessel in his hand. We become the wine
[1:45:51] that he drinks. It's what the scripture
[1:45:54] talks about. We sung it. It's giving of
[1:45:57] our life. Listen, he wants more than
[1:45:58] your amen. He wants more than your
[1:46:00] hallelujah. He wants more than your
[1:46:02] lifted arm. He wants more than your sway
[1:46:05] to the music. He wants you to be
[1:46:08] emptied.
[1:46:10] The Bible talks about Enoch. He walked
[1:46:13] with God and he was a was not.
[1:46:19] He became a was not. Not an astronaut,
[1:46:22] not a cosmonaut, but Enoch became a
[1:46:25] wasnot.
[1:46:27] And if you look at that in the literal
[1:46:30] sense of the language, it means that he
[1:46:33] was emptied.
[1:46:35] He was so emptied that he could have
[1:46:39] fellowship with God.
[1:46:43] I like the way the old-timers used to
[1:46:45] describe it. They say that just like God
[1:46:48] came down in the cool of the evening to
[1:46:50] Adam, God would come down and have
[1:46:53] fellowship with Enoch and they would
[1:46:56] walk together in the realm of the
[1:47:00] spirit. Don't knock it until you've
[1:47:02] tried it. They walk together in the
[1:47:05] realm of the spirit. And that one day uh
[1:47:09] he just papa just said, "Well, Enoch,
[1:47:12] we've been walking along." Now, I hope
[1:47:15] some of you sisters experience this when
[1:47:17] you're on your exercise stroll that you
[1:47:20] lose sense of time and how many steps
[1:47:22] you've made and the next thing you know,
[1:47:24] you've gotten a lot more in than you
[1:47:26] realized and you're not near as sweaty
[1:47:29] as you could be and and all that. But
[1:47:32] that's kind of how it was. They just got
[1:47:34] further along seemingly than anybody
[1:47:37] realized. And and the old-timers used to
[1:47:39] say, "Well, then Papa just looked at
[1:47:41] Enoch and said, "Well, we're closer to
[1:47:43] my house now."
[1:47:46] Come on. Than we already are, son. Why
[1:47:50] don't you just come home and spend the
[1:47:52] day? Well, where is Enoch? He He's
[1:47:55] spending the day because there is no
[1:47:58] night. Right. You You mean you really
[1:48:01] believe that he walked with God and was
[1:48:04] not and God took him and he didn't die?
[1:48:06] I absolutely believe it. I absolutely
[1:48:09] believe it. And I believe he showed up
[1:48:12] again
[1:48:13] on the on the mount. I believe that he
[1:48:16] that he will show up again in two
[1:48:19] witnesses.
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:26] That's Moses and Elijah.
[1:48:30] That's a that's a Pentecostal
[1:48:32] interpretation
[1:48:34] of Enoch. But I'll tell you, he
[1:48:37] represents a a spiritual
[1:48:41] company of people, the bride,
[1:48:45] the bride, those who will not go
[1:48:47] through. Brother Brandham typed the
[1:48:49] Jewish actually at one point to to the
[1:48:52] ark
[1:48:54] and he typed the the bride being
[1:48:57] raptured out as the Enoch generation.
[1:48:59] Let it be so. Let it be so. Are you with
[1:49:02] me? Amen. God is so good. So, we're on
[1:49:07] that journey process process one thing
[1:49:11] right after another. And we talked about
[1:49:13] uh for two services that we didn't
[1:49:15] choose this thing. The grape don't just
[1:49:18] jump in the press on its own. That
[1:49:20] somebody has to choose. The juiciest,
[1:49:24] the brightest. You may not have found
[1:49:26] yourself that way or thought of yourself
[1:49:29] that way, but he did. In Ephesians,
[1:49:32] let's just get that one scripture in as
[1:49:35] we move forward. Ephesians 1 3 and six.
[1:49:38] said, "No, that's not what I told you,
[1:49:40] Mariah." But, uh, look forward. There
[1:49:43] you go. Blessed be the God and Father of
[1:49:46] our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[1:49:50] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:49:54] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[1:49:58] he hath
[1:50:01] He hath chosen us in him before the
[1:50:04] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:50:06] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:50:10] love, having predestinated
[1:50:13] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:50:17] Jesus Christ to
[1:50:20] according to the good.
[1:50:24] Why did he do it? Because it pleased him
[1:50:26] to do it to the praise of the glory of
[1:50:28] his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:50:32] accepted in the beloved. Go to
[1:50:34] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse one. to
[1:50:37] everything.
[1:50:39] There is a
[1:50:41] say it season and a time to every
[1:50:45] purpose
[1:50:47] under heaven. Everything. Everything.
[1:50:51] And if you don't believe it, read the
[1:50:52] rest of the chapter. Time to be born, a
[1:50:55] time to die, a time to plant, a time to
[1:50:57] pluck, a time to, you know, pluck up
[1:50:59] that which is planted. A time to mourn,
[1:51:02] a time to to rejoice, a time to for
[1:51:05] everything there is a season. And there
[1:51:08] are sons of God prepared by the
[1:51:11] revelation of Jesus Christ message to be
[1:51:13] able to discern what time is it,
[1:51:18] what season is it? Because you don't
[1:51:21] want to be planting in a season that God
[1:51:24] has decreed and declared as a harvest.
[1:51:27] And you don't want to be trying to
[1:51:29] harvest in a season that God has decreed
[1:51:32] it's time to plant. So there's a time to
[1:51:35] plant. And there is a time to harvest.
[1:51:38] And by the way, you may not have
[1:51:40] noticed, but the se the grass seed have
[1:51:42] began Friday. I could only find a few
[1:51:45] little sprouts. But thank God for the
[1:51:49] rain that came yesterday that didn't
[1:51:52] wash the seed away, but it gave a drink
[1:51:55] because the same spot that I looked at
[1:51:57] Friday afternoon and saw only a few
[1:52:00] sprouts had had many sprouts today. God
[1:52:05] is good. God is good. There is a time.
[1:52:09] There's a season. And so you can't get
[1:52:12] grapes when there are no grapes to get.
[1:52:15] And you can't make wine, not the kind of
[1:52:17] wine we're looking for out of grapes
[1:52:20] that have not yet reached their
[1:52:21] maturity. You want as much moisture in
[1:52:24] the grape, as much juice in the grape as
[1:52:27] you can possibly get in there. And when
[1:52:30] it comes time to harvest them,
[1:52:32] particularly wine grapes, their skin is
[1:52:36] almost bursting on its own pressure
[1:52:39] because it's so full. That was you.
[1:52:43] That was you. full of fluid,
[1:52:46] full of juice, and in your season, in
[1:52:49] the season, in the time frame of God's
[1:52:53] choosing, he plucked you. Amen.
[1:52:57] He not only plucked you, he cut you
[1:53:01] from the vine.
[1:53:04] He didn't do it one day too late.
[1:53:07] Listen, one day can mold.
[1:53:11] one day can cause a mold on a on a on a
[1:53:15] wine grape that reminds you of that uh
[1:53:19] that fungi that gets on a corn cob when
[1:53:23] when you've seen it when it pops up at
[1:53:25] the top and and it's ugly. It's yucky.
[1:53:29] And one day over can cause a reaction
[1:53:33] like that that brings a mold looking
[1:53:36] substance on those grapes and they're
[1:53:38] they're not usable. And so, uh, it takes
[1:53:41] somebody who's got some skill and some
[1:53:44] wisdom to know in what right moment to
[1:53:47] bring you in. Although you were always
[1:53:51] his. Is that right? From where? From
[1:53:53] before the foundation of the world, but
[1:53:56] in a right season, in a right moment, he
[1:53:59] took you. Thanks be to God. The ripening
[1:54:02] of the grapes in the land of Israel took
[1:54:05] place as early as June in the Jordan
[1:54:08] Valley, but on the coast not until
[1:54:12] August. And in the hills, it would be
[1:54:16] September going even into early October
[1:54:20] on the Gregorian calendar. So, you know,
[1:54:23] where you're planted,
[1:54:26] where you're planted can determine when
[1:54:28] you're ready.
[1:54:30] Oh God, get us ready.
[1:54:34] I don't know if we're June grapes or
[1:54:37] August grapes or September, October
[1:54:40] grapes, but whatever we are, get us in
[1:54:43] the right moment at the right time and
[1:54:46] let the process begin. Aren't you glad
[1:54:49] it has? Aren't you glad he plucked you
[1:54:52] out of your comfort zone? Praise God.
[1:54:55] Pruned you right out from where you had
[1:54:58] been planted. In whatever month,
[1:55:01] however, the coming of the vintage was
[1:55:04] the signal for the villagers to leave
[1:55:07] their homes in Bible times in a body, in
[1:55:11] a community, in a group, in mass, and
[1:55:14] they would encamp in booths or tents
[1:55:18] erected in the vineyards much like the
[1:55:22] booths that are used in Sakote, which in
[1:55:26] some regions of Israel could overlap.
[1:55:29] out. They no longer lived in their home.
[1:55:33] They had to be in the vineyard. It was a
[1:55:36] long work day and they would just as a
[1:55:39] group. It almost sounds like fun if the
[1:55:43] work wasn't so hard. But they would camp
[1:55:46] in booths erected in the vineyard. There
[1:55:49] would be someone in the watchtowwer
[1:55:52] because even in a grape vineyard there
[1:55:54] was a watchtower and someone would be
[1:55:57] watching day and night because as we
[1:56:00] address Oh, hallelujah. I I'm sorry, but
[1:56:03] I'm not sorry. But as we address this
[1:56:06] morning, there's always a fox. There's
[1:56:09] always a thief. There's always a coyote.
[1:56:12] There's always something somewhere.
[1:56:16] I come out this morning. Joshua has been
[1:56:19] out more than once. Mariah has already
[1:56:22] gone out and neither one of them see
[1:56:25] what I saw. I come out next and there
[1:56:29] laying on the front porch is a peach pit
[1:56:34] planted. It looked like laid positioned
[1:56:38] right there so anybody could see it. if
[1:56:41] you've got a watchful eye.
[1:56:45] I said, "Neither one of you all saw
[1:56:47] that." And all around it, Jason, there
[1:56:49] were there were uh there was peach meat,
[1:56:54] just bits and pieces of peach and we
[1:56:59] don't know. We had some peaches at the
[1:57:01] house, but the only pits and were in the
[1:57:05] garbage and and and and we don't know.
[1:57:08] It looked like it could be a raccoon.
[1:57:10] That's a raccoon for southern folks like
[1:57:13] us or a a opasum or something,
[1:57:18] but it had gone in and gotten it. Now, I
[1:57:21] wasn't mad because I don't think it'd
[1:57:23] come in the kitchen and got one. I think
[1:57:26] it got it out of the trash, which meant
[1:57:28] that most of it had already ended up on
[1:57:31] my yogurt.
[1:57:34] So, I didn't mind him having the pit,
[1:57:36] but I didn't appreciate the mess that he
[1:57:38] made on the front porch. But there is
[1:57:40] always and there will always be an enemy
[1:57:43] in crouching,
[1:57:46] hiding to come and steal the vintage, to
[1:57:50] steal the fruit of your labor. I want
[1:57:53] you to get some of that. You see, the
[1:57:56] enemy is always out to take your
[1:57:58] harvest. He's got that spirit of the
[1:58:01] Philistines.
[1:58:03] And every year, where were the
[1:58:05] Philistines when it was time to plow the
[1:58:08] field and clear the field? They weren't
[1:58:10] anywhere to be found. And where were
[1:58:12] they when it come time to plant the
[1:58:14] peas? Nowhere to be found. And where
[1:58:16] were they when it was time to ho the
[1:58:19] rose and do all the labor of getting the
[1:58:21] peas so that they would produce a
[1:58:23] maximum harvest? And where were they?
[1:58:26] Nowhere to be found. But you just let
[1:58:28] them come to maturity.
[1:58:30] And every year, they come to steal the
[1:58:34] harvest of shama. Is that right? But I
[1:58:37] want you to know he'd finally had
[1:58:39] enough. Yes, sir. And one day he said,
[1:58:41] "You have come and stole my peas, my
[1:58:45] lentils the last time."
[1:58:48] And he stood up. And God honored his
[1:58:50] standing up. God will honor you. He'll
[1:58:53] honor you if you stand up this morning
[1:58:55] in the spirit. He'll honor you if you
[1:58:58] stand up in the spirit and say, "Wait a
[1:59:00] minute. You've touched my children long
[1:59:02] enough. You've had them in your
[1:59:04] compromising grip long enough. But I'm
[1:59:08] holding up a banner. I'm holding up a
[1:59:10] blood stained banner. And I'm giving a
[1:59:13] victory shout that says, "You can't have
[1:59:15] them. God has given them to me. They're
[1:59:20] part of my inheritance.
[1:59:22] And you better go." And you know, God
[1:59:24] used one man and he ran that whole bunch
[1:59:27] of Philistines right out of the way. And
[1:59:30] so there's somebody in the watchtowwer
[1:59:32] in the vineyard making sure that the
[1:59:35] enemy Listen, Nathan could tell you, ask
[1:59:38] him about it. He worked in the uh in the
[1:59:41] uh vineyard in in just across there in
[1:59:45] Shiloh in Shilo. And uh they have to
[1:59:49] watch everything they plant. Even the
[1:59:52] even the olive trees are uh abused,
[1:59:56] stolen. They come in and steal the
[1:59:58] olives. And u because they don't seem to
[2:00:02] have a sense of future, they will
[2:00:05] sometimes chop up the tree and set it on
[2:00:08] fire. So, not only do they steal the
[2:00:10] harvest, but these poor Jewish settlers
[2:00:13] then have to deal with the aftermath of
[2:00:16] destroying the tree. This doesn't make a
[2:00:20] whole lot of sense to me. They'll come
[2:00:22] in and just break big limbs off, pick
[2:00:25] the olives, and set the rest on fire.
[2:00:28] And even in that very place, that family
[2:00:31] vineyard where Nathan was, they would
[2:00:33] come in and steal the grapes. They would
[2:00:35] come in and steal the olives. There's
[2:00:37] always an enemy who's out for your
[2:00:39] inheritance. And if you lay down and
[2:00:42] play dead, he'll rob you of everything
[2:00:44] that is yours. But if you catch him in
[2:00:47] the act,
[2:00:57] too late. You as a grape, you as fruit
[2:01:01] in his vintage must be harvested in
[2:01:04] season. You come in in the right hour,
[2:01:07] in the right moment when he calls you.
[2:01:11] His perfect timing. Somebody say, "His
[2:01:14] perfect timing." His perfect timing. So
[2:01:16] they are picked in season. If they're
[2:01:18] too early, they're bitter or sour. If
[2:01:21] they're too late, they've already
[2:01:22] started to rot or mold. Harvesting was
[2:01:26] often by hand because it is such a
[2:01:30] serious and careful um affair with
[2:01:35] careful intention. Uh every believer
[2:01:38] also has a divine appointment in the
[2:01:41] timing. The truth reaches you in a
[2:01:45] moment that you are ready to receive it.
[2:01:48] If it comes too early, you will
[2:01:50] initially reject it. If you listen to
[2:01:53] some people, they'll tell you you'll
[2:01:55] never have another chance. It's
[2:01:57] according to how far you've gone in your
[2:01:59] rejection. Because I've watched the Lord
[2:02:01] come back around and what you hated, you
[2:02:05] now begin to hunger for.
[2:02:08] He's just good like that. He's just good
[2:02:11] like that. So, uh, every time someone
[2:02:14] threw a book at me or a tape at me, uh,
[2:02:16] and I don't mean, uh, um, symbolically,
[2:02:20] I mean they really did literally. Uh, I
[2:02:24] didn't mark them off, call them seed of
[2:02:27] the devil, cousins of Cain, and all the
[2:02:31] things you hear people say, unsavable.
[2:02:34] I just said, Lord, you know their
[2:02:37] address. You know how to go get them in
[2:02:38] the right season. Amen. There's only one
[2:02:42] real full whole truth.
[2:02:45] And if you're ordained for it,
[2:02:49] you can only run, but you can't hide.
[2:02:53] That's the grace of God. That's the
[2:02:55] goodness of God. Are you with me? Oh, he
[2:02:58] knows when to move you forward. He knows
[2:03:00] when to put you in a holding pattern.
[2:03:04] He knows when you're about to lose the
[2:03:06] future. And so that same God that's been
[2:03:09] gently uh easing you, he'll come and put
[2:03:13] his foot in the middle of your back.
[2:03:16] Anybody ever had God shove him? Have you
[2:03:18] ever had the Lord drag you? He'll drag
[2:03:20] do whatever he has to do to get you
[2:03:22] where you needed to be. Somebody said,
[2:03:24] "My feelings are hurt." Oh, poor you.
[2:03:27] If he doesn't go after you, you were
[2:03:29] never his in the first place. If you
[2:03:31] don't ever make a trip to the woodshed,
[2:03:33] you are illegitimate, the Bible said. So
[2:03:36] we take whatever we can get because we
[2:03:39] know he's a redeemer.
[2:03:41] Oh, is he a redeemer? Amen. He knows
[2:03:45] when to get you ready for your next
[2:03:46] phase. He won't crush you before your
[2:03:49] time.
[2:03:53] And he almost always warns us
[2:03:56] before he skins us.
[2:04:02] Aren't you glad?
[2:04:04] Now, the grapes are usually harvested by
[2:04:06] cutting a whole cluster off the vine
[2:04:09] with what was called in Bible times,
[2:04:12] first and second temple period time, a
[2:04:15] pruning knife.
[2:04:17] And then these clusters were were
[2:04:20] gathered into baskets.
[2:04:22] This pruning knife was a small knife
[2:04:28] that had a small blade that was shaped
[2:04:32] similar, not quite as drastic, but
[2:04:36] similar to a sickle. So you could call
[2:04:39] it, but it would be only about that
[2:04:41] size, but ve mostly blade, very sharp,
[2:04:46] almost like a uh a sickle. But it was
[2:04:51] referred to in Hebrew as a mazar. And it
[2:04:55] was also a pruning hook. It was also
[2:04:59] called a pruning hook. A pruning knife
[2:05:03] or a pruning hook. And this is an
[2:05:07] interesting tool because it's used in
[2:05:10] the Bible, not only in the culture of
[2:05:13] the vine, but it's also used uh a small
[2:05:18] enough to be made from uh a piece of
[2:05:22] metal
[2:05:24] uh that would be used as the point of a
[2:05:28] spear.
[2:05:30] And this is interesting because there
[2:05:32] are multiple scriptures that talk about
[2:05:35] the the transformation. Listen of a
[2:05:39] pruning hook.
[2:05:43] Are are you with me? Do you remember
[2:05:46] this? In Isaiah 18 and5, he said, "For
[2:05:50] before, excuse me, for before the
[2:05:53] harvest, when the bud is perfect and the
[2:05:56] sour grape is ripening in the flower, he
[2:06:00] shall both cut off the sprigs with
[2:06:03] pruning hooks and take away and cut down
[2:06:07] the branches." Now, this is speaking of
[2:06:10] judgment. It's speaking about taking the
[2:06:13] grape before it's time to spoil the
[2:06:17] possibility of a vintage of a wine. Now,
[2:06:21] God deals and uses these words
[2:06:25] concerning the vineyard, the vocabulary
[2:06:27] of the vineyard. We might say he uses it
[2:06:30] in in miscellaneous ways throughout the
[2:06:34] writings of the prophets. Look at Isaiah
[2:06:36] 2:4. I don't even know if I gave this to
[2:06:39] you, Mariah, but it says, "And he shall
[2:06:41] judge among the nations and shall rebuke
[2:06:44] many people, and they shall do what?
[2:06:47] They shall beat their swords into
[2:06:49] plowshares
[2:06:51] and their spears into pruning hooks."
[2:06:56] So from an instrument of war to an
[2:07:00] instrument of harvest. Amen.
[2:07:04] This is prophetic concerning the
[2:07:07] restoration of the people of God, the
[2:07:10] nation, the Hebrew nation. But it is
[2:07:14] also prophetic concerning the new man
[2:07:17] where one day our spiritual warfare
[2:07:21] comes to an end. And what we have
[2:07:24] learned, what we have learned in waring
[2:07:28] against that realm of darkness, we use
[2:07:32] that authority to bring in the final
[2:07:36] harvest of both Gentile and Jew. Ain't
[2:07:40] that interesting? So, what was once a
[2:07:43] spear head has now become a a little
[2:07:47] pruning knife or a little uh pruning
[2:07:51] hook to be able to bring the harvest to
[2:07:56] the king. Oh my. Joel 3:10, ble beat
[2:08:01] your plowshares into swords and your
[2:08:03] pruning hooks into spears. That is the
[2:08:06] opposite. Let the weak say
[2:08:10] that's where we are. That is
[2:08:12] prophetically the hour that we're in
[2:08:15] now. We are utilizing what's in our
[2:08:17] hands to reap, to fight rather, to
[2:08:21] fight, to war, to break down, to pluck
[2:08:24] up it. It's an hour of having to use the
[2:08:28] authority of the word, the blood, and
[2:08:31] the name to defy the forces of darkness.
[2:08:34] Satan is is knowing and sensing
[2:08:36] according to scripture that his days are
[2:08:39] short. And so he will anoint and use and
[2:08:43] utilize whoever, whatever, usually the
[2:08:46] ones we love.
[2:08:50] How many of you are just tired of being
[2:08:51] used of the enemy? I don't want to be
[2:08:54] the one. And you can read Micah 4:3
[2:08:58] later where it talks about swords into
[2:09:00] plowshares and spears into pruning
[2:09:03] hooks. Now once the grapes have been
[2:09:07] gathered in cluster uh with the pruning
[2:09:10] hook now in a basket they are carried to
[2:09:14] the wine press. And I have gathered a
[2:09:18] little collection of photos. I'm not
[2:09:20] going to show them this morning, but I
[2:09:22] will show them to you sometime when they
[2:09:24] when it just feels like the right time
[2:09:27] because even to this day, they are still
[2:09:31] uncovering wine presses from the time of
[2:09:35] Jesus all across the land of Israel. And
[2:09:40] one of them is happens to be the largest
[2:09:44] wine press operation in the entire world
[2:09:48] that has been discovered is down in the
[2:09:51] Gaza
[2:09:52] of Israel nearing to the Sinai
[2:09:56] Peninsula. And I it's interesting to me.
[2:10:00] I visited many of them. And when you're
[2:10:03] there, you will get an understanding uh
[2:10:06] of what it took to get that grape to the
[2:10:11] king's cup. What a process it was.
[2:10:16] grapes before they're crushed or washed
[2:10:19] in baskets or in flowing water to remove
[2:10:25] three things: dust,
[2:10:29] insects,
[2:10:30] and impurities, which might be sticks,
[2:10:34] small sticks, stems,
[2:10:38] or small stones.
[2:10:41] Nobody wants a pebble in their wine.
[2:10:45] Nobody wants a a a wood chip or a beetle
[2:10:53] in their wine.
[2:10:55] When you see these pictures of uh these
[2:10:58] wine presses, you will identify both
[2:11:01] rectangular and round stone cleaning
[2:11:05] basins,
[2:11:07] sometimes
[2:11:09] amazingly carved right out of the stone.
[2:11:13] So that's why we can still see them
[2:11:15] today because they weren't built above.
[2:11:18] They were carved out of some of them
[2:11:21] were plastered. In fact, some of the
[2:11:24] wine presses in Kuman, which is uh just
[2:11:30] I guess it would be just south perhaps
[2:11:34] southwest of Jericho to this day in the
[2:11:39] ruins of Kuman where the Essenes were,
[2:11:43] you'll find not only wine presses but
[2:11:47] that are still plastered the plaster to
[2:11:51] to to retain the moisture, to retain the
[2:11:56] juice. It's still plastered just like it
[2:12:00] was 2,000 years ago. I mean, that to me
[2:12:05] is is a almost unimaginable
[2:12:09] when we live in a society where
[2:12:11] everything is wood and decays so quickly
[2:12:14] and falls down. This was the society of
[2:12:18] stone. And so it it's amazing. There
[2:12:22] were these rectangular or sometimes
[2:12:26] circular cleaning basins and there are
[2:12:30] also troughs
[2:12:32] that are dug right into the stone with a
[2:12:36] slant
[2:12:38] so that they're stomping the grapes here
[2:12:42] and the juice is running first through a
[2:12:45] filter.
[2:12:47] Now, I'm not just talking about washing
[2:12:49] the grapes, but even after they're
[2:12:52] crushed, again, filtered.
[2:12:55] There is a serious
[2:12:58] amount of effort that goes in to making
[2:13:02] sure that before the process of
[2:13:05] fermentation has taken place, there has
[2:13:08] already been a cleansing.
[2:13:11] Now, that's what happens when the new
[2:13:14] birth begins.
[2:13:16] There is a cleansing that takes place in
[2:13:20] us when we meet him. I mean really meet
[2:13:24] him. It's the process of sanctification
[2:13:28] and and so much of that old nature is
[2:13:31] washed right out of us. Not all of it,
[2:13:34] unfortunately. It's a journey to get it
[2:13:37] down, to get it under the blood, to get
[2:13:39] it all killed. Amen. Did you did you
[2:13:42] notice the words of the song that we
[2:13:45] were singing this morning? Oh, I want to
[2:13:47] see him uh singing about the arrows from
[2:13:51] without.
[2:13:53] From without.
[2:13:56] Poetic for without and within. The
[2:13:59] enemy's got arrows trained on you from
[2:14:02] without.
[2:14:03] And there are arrows that rise up in us
[2:14:06] from within. But we're in a a a serious
[2:14:11] season. Thank God. Uh maybe you maybe
[2:14:16] you like where you've been, but I'm
[2:14:19] disgusted with where I've been. I'm
[2:14:22] ready for something more. And I'm not
[2:14:26] demanding anything of God. I'm not
[2:14:28] asking for any shortcuts. I want the
[2:14:32] process to continue until the victory is
[2:14:35] ours. Amen. Whatever it takes.
[2:14:38] So, wash me in the basin and then filter
[2:14:42] me in the trough.
[2:14:44] I don't care. It doesn't matter anymore.
[2:14:47] Why would it matter? Why would we think
[2:14:49] that we have some reputation to preserve
[2:14:52] or some spiritual persona to put on for
[2:14:56] somebody else? My God, shift us and sift
[2:15:00] us and crush us and do whatever you have
[2:15:04] to do.
[2:15:06] because it's your vintage.
[2:15:09] It's your juice.
[2:15:11] Whatever I have is is of you. And to get
[2:15:15] it out is is is it's Thank God. It's not
[2:15:18] all my responsibility. Are you still
[2:15:20] here? Let's see. It's 11:12. Plenty of
[2:15:24] time. Let me have a little water.
[2:15:32] So both basins
[2:15:36] and troughs,
[2:15:40] both designed for washing grapes, have
[2:15:43] been discovered at various
[2:15:45] archaeological sites across Israel.
[2:15:47] These cleaning basins remove dust,
[2:15:49] insect, and debris, ensuring that only
[2:15:53] clean grapes entered the pressing stage.
[2:15:57] You might, if you do a little research,
[2:15:59] you might also find sources that say
[2:16:01] that the grapes were left unwashed to
[2:16:04] preserve the yeast on the skins
[2:16:08] rather than to slow down the natural
[2:16:10] process of fermentation. However, what
[2:16:13] they're not taking into account is the
[2:16:16] seriousness of the dietary laws of the
[2:16:19] Jewish culture, especially for wine that
[2:16:22] is used in festivals or other religious
[2:16:24] ceremonies.
[2:16:26] And therefore we know because we found
[2:16:29] they have found the basins and the
[2:16:32] troughs and they know that especially
[2:16:35] wine being prepared for the service of
[2:16:37] the temple for the for the use of the
[2:16:40] priest and for any sort of religious
[2:16:42] festival or ceremony the grapes were
[2:16:45] washed first. How did the fermentation
[2:16:48] process take place? It was slower. it
[2:16:51] was slower because the natural yeast of
[2:16:54] the skin of the grape had had somewhat
[2:16:57] been reduced by the washing. Now if if
[2:17:01] that is the the kind of wine making that
[2:17:05] our Christian journey is most relatable
[2:17:09] to then it means unfortunately
[2:17:15] I have to tell you that it's a slightly
[2:17:18] longer process
[2:17:23] because you don't want to spoil
[2:17:27] you want to sweeten
[2:17:30] God only knows how desperately some of
[2:17:33] you need it.
[2:17:36] Some of us,
[2:17:39] we need it. You You can't jump from the
[2:17:42] vine to the cup.
[2:17:45] You know, the king can't get it down if
[2:17:47] it's still in the skin. So, something's
[2:17:50] got to happen.
[2:17:52] So, the washing takes place before the
[2:17:55] crushing. It's sanctification before
[2:17:58] service. God has to clean us so that he
[2:18:02] can use us. He has to clean us before he
[2:18:06] can bring us even into a process of
[2:18:09] separating us off to the side for his
[2:18:11] service. Are you willing? Yes, Lord.
[2:18:16] That wasn't extremely convincing other
[2:18:18] than the right other than the front row
[2:18:20] of the of my left hand side. What about
[2:18:24] the rest of you? Yes, sir. Or should for
[2:18:27] for you north of the Mason Dixon line,
[2:18:29] should I put an S on the U? What what
[2:18:31] about the rest of you's?
[2:18:35] What about you?
[2:18:38] Don't you think you might need some
[2:18:40] more? I do.
[2:18:42] Washing represents separation,
[2:18:45] cleansing, and preparation.
[2:18:48] This is the heart of sanctification. to
[2:18:51] be made holy, to be set apart, and to be
[2:18:55] prepared for the use that you were
[2:18:58] created for. God had a design in his
[2:19:01] mind before you were ever born of how
[2:19:04] your life would matter, how it would be
[2:19:06] used for the service of his kingdom in
[2:19:09] your uh in your respective lifespan.
[2:19:13] And he's getting us there. Oh, it's
[2:19:16] rough sometimes. It's rough because we
[2:19:20] think, you know, we're already there.
[2:19:23] We think sometimes we've arrived.
[2:19:26] And that's why the apostle had to say,
[2:19:29] you know, I uh uh not that I have
[2:19:31] already apprehended.
[2:19:34] Sometimes I think I've already won it.
[2:19:37] And then I'm reminded, God brings
[2:19:39] something to remind me that I have not
[2:19:42] apprehended anything. I'm just running
[2:19:44] towards something. Praise God. And you
[2:19:48] know what? You won't apprehend anything
[2:19:50] until you've been apprehended.
[2:19:52] Until God arrests you. You won't be able
[2:19:55] to lay your hands on anything else for
[2:19:58] his kingdom's sake. Lord, arrest us.
[2:20:03] Lord, may we never get so occupied with
[2:20:06] our pet projects
[2:20:09] that we forget the kingdom.
[2:20:13] It matters.
[2:20:16] matters, church. It matters. It matters.
[2:20:19] Just as grapes had to be washed of dust
[2:20:22] and insects and impurities before they
[2:20:24] could be crushed into wine or into juice
[2:20:27] to be later fermented into wine, we must
[2:20:29] be cleansed so that we can be poured.
[2:20:32] Remember, our goal is to be poured for
[2:20:35] the master's delight, for the master's
[2:20:38] pleasure. Cleansing comes before
[2:20:41] usefulness.
[2:20:43] Sanctification is the removal of any
[2:20:46] spiritual defilement. Generational
[2:20:49] iniquity is included in that defilement.
[2:20:52] Sanctification is the foundation of our
[2:20:56] transformation.
[2:20:58] Sanctification is a doctrine not often
[2:21:01] preached anymore.
[2:21:03] In fact, around the message, we're more
[2:21:06] times reminded that that nature is here
[2:21:09] to stay
[2:21:11] than we are told that there is a process
[2:21:15] if we so choose to cooperate where God
[2:21:18] will wash some of that gunk and junk out
[2:21:21] of our life. And what he can't wash out,
[2:21:28] he knows how to cut out. Are you here?
[2:21:31] Yes, sir. He knows how to surgically
[2:21:34] remove it. It's very, very difficult,
[2:21:37] you know, to get people to shout over
[2:21:40] testings and trials. But I'm going to
[2:21:43] tell you something in a minute. I'm
[2:21:45] going to help you scripturally to
[2:21:46] identify what your posture and your
[2:21:49] attitude and your behavior has to look
[2:21:51] like. in the crush.
[2:21:55] God is so specific that he even has a
[2:21:57] has a desire and a design for how we
[2:22:01] respond
[2:22:04] and and saying ouch isn't included.
[2:22:08] When somebody's big foot
[2:22:12] is coming down on your head,
[2:22:16] you generally would want to scream, "Get
[2:22:18] off of me, you big dummy.
[2:22:22] But since you understand that it's part
[2:22:24] of God's process, your response can't be
[2:22:28] get off of me. It has to be yes.
[2:22:37] Yes.
[2:22:39] Praise God.
[2:22:42] Hallelujah.
[2:22:44] Every crush, every squeeze is to bring
[2:22:48] out the maximum
[2:22:51] recognition and acknowledgment that it's
[2:22:55] all for a reason. It's all for a
[2:22:57] purpose. You know, if people don't
[2:23:00] understand and believe in the
[2:23:01] sovereignty of God, they'll never bring
[2:23:04] the right response.
[2:23:07] You know what the church likes to do?
[2:23:08] The devil. Oh, it's a devil. Let's
[2:23:11] rebuke the devil. I'm in a squeeze.
[2:23:16] I hear it. Especially among the
[2:23:18] charismatics. there's an assignment
[2:23:20] against me and Satan is trying to kill
[2:23:23] me and he's squeezing me and he's on my
[2:23:26] job and he's it you know I've even
[2:23:28] recently I've even recently heard people
[2:23:32] define uh a trial
[2:23:36] as the misdelivery of an Amazon package
[2:23:44] attempt of Satan
[2:23:47] to harass and to stall Oh, have you ever
[2:23:51] considered the fact
[2:23:54] and can I tell it? Should I tell my
[2:23:55] little story?
[2:23:57] Monday of this week, I hate to see how
[2:24:00] some of you folks would respond.
[2:24:03] I have kept in my mind the difference
[2:24:06] with between and I and it may be the
[2:24:09] other way around. So, I'm not in any way
[2:24:11] saying something critical about Nathan
[2:24:13] because he's one of the most dependable
[2:24:15] uh uh precioushearted people that I
[2:24:18] know. So, this is no negative reflection
[2:24:20] on him, but his response to the strange
[2:24:24] uh driver that we had a few weeks ago
[2:24:26] was entirely different than mine. And as
[2:24:29] I said, it could be different the next
[2:24:32] time. He he may uh you know, make him a
[2:24:35] peanut butter and jelly sandwich and
[2:24:36] invite him in and I may throw a rock at
[2:24:39] him to try to get him off the
[2:24:40] campground. So, I'm not in any way
[2:24:42] saying, but uh I would love to have seen
[2:24:46] your response to what happened to us.
[2:24:48] We're sitting in the den, my wife and I
[2:24:51] and the girls. I think it was on Monday
[2:24:54] evening. It could have been on Wednesday
[2:24:56] evening. And uh one of the girls said,
[2:24:59] "Who's here?" And nobody knew. And
[2:25:02] somebody said, "Well, it may it's just a
[2:25:04] Jehovah witness, you know, I'm sure."
[2:25:07] and and uh somebody said, "Oh, no, it's
[2:25:09] not a Jehovah Witness cuz they're in
[2:25:11] shorts."
[2:25:12] Now, I never seen a Jehovah Witness come
[2:25:14] to the door in shorts. And uh I said,
[2:25:17] "Well, they can ring the doorbell and so
[2:25:20] forth." And we were almost a year
[2:25:22] without a glass door because my adorable
[2:25:26] uh yard man uh shattered the glass door
[2:25:29] with a with a um uh weed eater. and he
[2:25:34] is actually a long he follows in a long
[2:25:37] line of others who have shattered the
[2:25:40] glass of the front door of my home. It's
[2:25:42] happened multiple times. One time a BB
[2:25:45] gun and Katie Ellsworth watching our
[2:25:48] boys was involved and then another time
[2:25:50] it was one of our precious brothers who
[2:25:52] was on holiday this week. And moving
[2:25:54] right along,
[2:25:56] we finally got it replaced. And boy was
[2:25:58] that an effort.
[2:26:00] Nothing's easy anymore.
[2:26:02] You can't just go to Lowe's. You can't
[2:26:04] just you it's all so complicated these
[2:26:08] days and they they half do the job and
[2:26:11] you have to beg somebody to send them
[2:26:13] out. You know what I mean? So the the
[2:26:16] front door, the wooden door, hard door
[2:26:18] wasn't quite closed all the way, but the
[2:26:20] glass door was. And here comes somebody
[2:26:23] uh up on the porch, a woman in in in in
[2:26:26] shorts that she ought to know better.
[2:26:28] Old woman in she ought to know better.
[2:26:31] Nobody wanted to see those veins popped
[2:26:34] out like that. Uh she ought to had on
[2:26:37] some clothes, but anyway, she's there at
[2:26:40] the door and she's just banging on
[2:26:42] whatever she can get her hands on. And
[2:26:45] and uh well, it just startles us. We're
[2:26:47] just not used to people wanting to see
[2:26:50] us that bad.
[2:26:52] And so she opens the glass door
[2:26:56] like she's going to come in.
[2:27:00] And uh what really I think was happening
[2:27:02] Mariah is she was going for the door
[2:27:05] knocker.
[2:27:07] Unfortunately, it's this pastor Steven.
[2:27:09] So I had to be a little careful or
[2:27:10] pastor Shelly had to be a little careful
[2:27:12] how I how I behave because there was the
[2:27:15] door knocker. And Mariah is so so
[2:27:18] startled by the fact that she's opened
[2:27:19] the door to come in that Mariah just
[2:27:21] slams the hard door
[2:27:24] closed on her.
[2:27:27] And you think that discouraged her? It
[2:27:29] would discourage a normal person, but
[2:27:32] she just starts banging the door
[2:27:33] knocker. And I don't mean I mean like a
[2:27:36] wild woman. And I've had enough about
[2:27:39] the third time. And I I opened that door
[2:27:41] so fast that she went back like that and
[2:27:44] I said, "What are you doing?"
[2:27:50] She said, "You have my Amazon package."
[2:27:58] And I said, "I guarantee you, I assure
[2:28:01] you, I don't have your Amazon package."
[2:28:07] My wife comes around to save me. And she
[2:28:11] said, "Oh, yes, we did have an Amazon
[2:28:14] package that arrived, but it came by the
[2:28:15] postal service, so we put it in the
[2:28:17] mailbox so that they could pick it up."
[2:28:19] And she just I I I said to her, uh, you
[2:28:24] know, you could be shot.
[2:28:31] I wouldn't,
[2:28:33] but there are folks,
[2:28:36] somebody open the front door and start
[2:28:38] in their house. I don't I don't think
[2:28:40] I'd have to throw very hard to hit
[2:28:42] somebody today.
[2:28:46] That might at least wave one around.
[2:28:52] I said, "You just can't do that.
[2:28:56] You you you you can't do that. I can
[2:28:58] clearly see that you're upset, but you
[2:29:01] cannot come banging on someone's door
[2:29:04] like a wild woman. We're living in a
[2:29:07] world where you just can't behave that
[2:29:09] way, particularly especially over an
[2:29:12] Amazon package.
[2:29:15] It it I wondered if it was insulin or
[2:29:17] whatever was in it. Know some
[2:29:19] photographs that she needed to send to
[2:29:21] Texas. The next morning, my wife comes
[2:29:24] out. Normally, I'm the nicer one.
[2:29:28] My wife comes out, walks her down to the
[2:29:30] mailbox, and opened up, gets it. The the
[2:29:32] m Let me tell you what the mail lady's
[2:29:33] doing. She's come back with mail. We
[2:29:35] hadn't had no mail. It's night time now.
[2:29:38] Had no mail. She takes the package out,
[2:29:40] puts the mail in, and instead of taking
[2:29:42] the package to its rightful address, she
[2:29:45] puts it back in there on top of the
[2:29:47] mail. Nobody wants to do their job right
[2:29:52] now. I wouldn't have been surprised
[2:29:54] because I had a friend this week who
[2:29:56] wrote a big article, a big write up on
[2:29:59] social media. I I wouldn't have been
[2:30:00] surprised if I would have read somewhere
[2:30:02] that that woman decided that that was
[2:30:04] some kind of attack of the devil on her
[2:30:07] by misdelivering her Amazon package. I
[2:30:10] had a friend who said as much. If you
[2:30:13] get that bent out of shape because your
[2:30:16] Amazon package goes to the wrong door,
[2:30:19] somebody is in for a whole lot more
[2:30:25] smashing.
[2:30:27] Yes.
[2:30:29] Amen. And you're going to be smashed
[2:30:32] until you can say, "Praise
[2:30:35] God, you're working in me a greater
[2:30:41] glory."
[2:30:42] [Music]
[2:30:45] So that I can not only be wine, but I
[2:30:47] can be wine that is not bitter or
[2:30:51] smelly,
[2:30:53] crushed.
[2:30:55] We've got to have this cleansing. 2
[2:30:58] Corinthians 7:1,
[2:31:01] having therefore these promises, dearly
[2:31:03] beloved, let us cleanse ourselves.
[2:31:06] That just means cooperate with the
[2:31:09] process.
[2:31:10] There are certain things you can change.
[2:31:13] There are certain things you can't
[2:31:15] change without his help. But you can
[2:31:18] cooperate with the process. He wants to
[2:31:22] clean you up. Listen, you don't have to
[2:31:23] go to this church to understand that
[2:31:25] modesty is a requirement
[2:31:28] of godly people. Amen.
[2:31:33] It's just a requirement. I don't care if
[2:31:35] you're Baptist or Methodist. you you
[2:31:38] ought to at least be modest because
[2:31:40] we're living in a world that is so
[2:31:43] perverse and so lust driven that you
[2:31:47] don't want to participate in anybody's
[2:31:50] uh uh uh wrong inherent thought process
[2:31:54] or behavior.
[2:31:56] You brothers ought to buy bigger sizes
[2:31:59] on your britches.
[2:32:01] You sisters ought to have bigger sizes.
[2:32:04] Somebody said, "I don't like the
[2:32:05] number." You need to come to a place
[2:32:07] where you don't care what the number is.
[2:32:10] You care whether you're covered and
[2:32:13] whether or not everything you got is
[2:32:15] available for view.
[2:32:19] That's what we ought to listen. We We
[2:32:22] can't get looser.
[2:32:24] Not in this hour. We're not legal. We
[2:32:27] can't be legal. It's not by modesty
[2:32:30] you're saved. It's by grace.
[2:32:33] But anybody that's scoured out on the
[2:32:35] inside ought to know that you've got to
[2:32:39] present the outside in a way that draws
[2:32:43] somebody to the to the preciousness, the
[2:32:46] value of being filled with holy oil,
[2:32:50] holy touch of God on your life. If if
[2:32:53] that's all that God requires of you to
[2:32:55] to cover up your stuff,
[2:32:59] that ought not to be too much to ask.
[2:33:01] Yeah. Nobody wants to see your inner
[2:33:04] thigh. Nobody wants to see under your
[2:33:06] arm. Maybe your husband uh and he can
[2:33:10] have that his turn his time. But uh when
[2:33:13] you're when you're in in public view,
[2:33:17] you want to get all that taken care of.
[2:33:19] And if that offends you, I I don't have
[2:33:22] anything to say.
[2:33:24] I I don't even have an apology in me.
[2:33:28] uh certain knits and stretchy material,
[2:33:32] you know,
[2:33:36] toothpicks maybe can uh pull it off, but
[2:33:40] uh you can't.
[2:33:45] You say it doesn't matter. Oh, yes. It
[2:33:47] matters.
[2:33:48] It matters. Matters.
[2:33:51] I used to go back to the judge.
[2:33:54] Now, I've made a lot of people mad with
[2:33:56] this illustration, but I used to go back
[2:33:57] to the judge. I read the story myself
[2:34:00] about a judge, a young woman taking
[2:34:03] advantage of
[2:34:05] riding around in a in a convertible
[2:34:08] and instead of using the door, she threw
[2:34:11] her leg across the the top of the
[2:34:14] convertible door to get out and and and
[2:34:17] and flashed whoever was in the parking
[2:34:20] lot. the fact that she didn't have on
[2:34:22] proper underclo.
[2:34:25] The judge
[2:34:27] sentenced, he did what he was supposed
[2:34:29] to do, but not until he sent a very
[2:34:32] stern message to that young woman and it
[2:34:35] appeared in the Associated Press, "You
[2:34:39] did have a role to play."
[2:34:42] Can you imagine a judge today?
[2:34:45] He said, you did have a role to play.
[2:34:49] You could have used the door and you
[2:34:51] could have used underwear.
[2:34:56] Oh, they're shouting. I know everybody.
[2:34:58] I know you streamers can't hear it, but
[2:35:00] they're just running down the aisle
[2:35:02] shouting for holiness. But it's true.
[2:35:05] It's the inner. I know it's the inner. I
[2:35:07] know it's the inner. I know it's the
[2:35:09] inside. I understand it. I know that man
[2:35:13] looks on the outward app. Oh, he does.
[2:35:17] Exactly.
[2:35:19] He does. You're not trying to win God to
[2:35:22] God. You're not trying to be a testimony
[2:35:24] to God about God. You're trying to be a
[2:35:27] testimony to those who look on the
[2:35:29] outward appearance.
[2:35:31] Oh, just a minute. Amen.
[2:35:36] You see, this good sanctifying power
[2:35:38] works on the inside
[2:35:41] and it works its way to the outside.
[2:35:44] I'll tell you the best thing I ever did
[2:35:46] do when I took off the old robe and put
[2:35:48] on the new. And when God dresses you in
[2:35:51] his righteousness, I'll tell you, it'll
[2:35:53] dictate choices and decisions that you
[2:35:56] make in the closet. Amen. Having
[2:35:59] therefore these promises, dearly
[2:36:01] beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
[2:36:02] all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.
[2:36:05] Amen. Perfecting.
[2:36:08] Say it again. It's not an ugly word.
[2:36:11] It's not a legalistic word. It's not a
[2:36:14] word about rules and regulations. It's a
[2:36:17] word that describes the touch of God on
[2:36:20] somebody's life.
[2:36:23] Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[2:36:26] Let's hurry.
[2:36:28] The Amplified says it like this.
[2:36:30] Therefore, since these great promises
[2:36:33] are ours, beloved, let us cleanse
[2:36:36] ourselves from everything that
[2:36:38] contaminates and defiles body and
[2:36:41] spirit, and bring our consecration to
[2:36:45] completeness
[2:36:47] in the reverential fear
[2:36:51] of God.
[2:36:53] This is not, uhoh, it might come above
[2:36:56] my knee, God's going to kill me. This is
[2:36:59] Lord Jesus. I want to honor you with
[2:37:01] everything that I do. I want my
[2:37:05] consecration to be complete. I want my
[2:37:08] sanctification to be birthed in
[2:37:10] reverential fear. I'm not afraid of your
[2:37:13] sledgehammer. I'm afraid of breaking
[2:37:15] your heart.
[2:37:19] I don't want to break your heart. I
[2:37:21] don't want to disappoint you.
[2:37:24] I don't want to bring any any shame to
[2:37:27] your name. It's already happened enough.
[2:37:30] John 17:17 in the amplified said,
[2:37:33] "Sanctify them." Jesus red letter.
[2:37:37] Purify. This is him talking. Purify,
[2:37:41] consecrate, separate them for yourself.
[2:37:44] Make them holy by thy truth.
[2:37:49] Your word is truth. The word is the
[2:37:52] water that washes
[2:37:55] the residual
[2:37:58] yuck off of our skin. This cleansing is
[2:38:02] not optional. It's preparation. No
[2:38:05] defilement can enter the king's wine.
[2:38:07] There must be a cleansing. What is John
[2:38:10] 15 about? The vine and the branches.
[2:38:12] Amen. John 15:4 talks about abiding in
[2:38:16] the vine. John 15:3. Look at what John
[2:38:19] 15:3. Now ye are clean through the word
[2:38:24] which I have spoken unto you. Jesus red
[2:38:27] letter. He's saying my word is what I'm
[2:38:31] sending to clean you. This is the season
[2:38:34] to let God sanctify you. Not just
[2:38:37] forgive you if you're starting your new
[2:38:40] Christian journey, but cleanse you and
[2:38:42] separate you and prepare you for what
[2:38:45] comes next. Somebody said, "I don't wear
[2:38:48] I don't want to wear a bun."
[2:38:51] Nobody said you had to wear a bun.
[2:38:57] You've just got to obey the word.
[2:39:00] And somebody might say, "Well, that's
[2:39:01] not my church."
[2:39:03] We're not talking about what a church
[2:39:05] requires.
[2:39:07] I don't think I've ever told anybody in
[2:39:09] this house that that's what we required.
[2:39:12] But I can tell you what the word says.
[2:39:15] This is a season to let God do a deep
[2:39:18] work in the cleansing part of who we
[2:39:20] are. Psalm 24:3 and4, who shall ascend?
[2:39:24] We all know Psalm 23, but the psalm
[2:39:27] after it says, "Who shall ascend into
[2:39:29] the hill of the Lord?" If you have no
[2:39:31] desire to go with him in spiritual
[2:39:35] places,
[2:39:36] you can stay just like you are,
[2:39:38] uncrushed, unwashed.
[2:39:41] But if you desire to go with him into
[2:39:44] the hill of the Lord where the secrets
[2:39:47] of the kingdom are revealed,
[2:39:50] truths are shouted here. Secrets are
[2:39:53] whispered there. Who shall ascend into
[2:39:56] the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand
[2:39:58] in his holy place? He that hath clean.
[2:40:03] Thank you, church. Clean hands and a
[2:40:06] pure heart. Pure heart. You can't have
[2:40:07] clean hands without a pure heart. who
[2:40:10] have not lifted up his mind, will, and
[2:40:12] emotion unto vanity,
[2:40:15] nor sworn
[2:40:17] deceitfully,
[2:40:20] undercover,
[2:40:22] underhanded,
[2:40:25] secretive,
[2:40:27] [Music]
[2:40:30] telling half the story because the other
[2:40:33] half might incriminate you. Just trying
[2:40:37] to live under the radar.
[2:40:39] But this is not total honesty before the
[2:40:41] Lord. And then we come to Isaiah 53:5.
[2:40:45] And I want to tell you something. He
[2:40:47] became our example in the crushing.
[2:40:51] How do you know I have to be crushed?
[2:40:53] Because he was. Isaiah 53:5. But he was
[2:40:56] wounded
[2:40:58] for our transgressions.
[2:41:00] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[2:41:04] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[2:41:07] Somebody read the rest.
[2:41:11] And with his stripes
[2:41:15] we are healed.
[2:41:17] Oh, our example went before us. Luke
[2:41:20] 22:44. And being in agony, he prayed
[2:41:23] more earnestly, and his sweat was as it
[2:41:26] were great drops of blood falling down
[2:41:29] to the ground.
[2:41:31] In Isaiah 63:3,
[2:41:34] grapes are often crushed by foot, or
[2:41:37] sometimes
[2:41:38] there are wine presses that utilize the
[2:41:41] weight of heavy stones.
[2:41:44] Neither one sounds pleasant if I'm the
[2:41:46] grape.
[2:41:48] 63:3 I have trotten the wine press
[2:41:51] alone, and of the people there was none
[2:41:54] with me, for I will tread them in mine
[2:41:56] anger, and trample them in my fury.
[2:41:59] Their blood shall be sprinkled upon my
[2:42:01] garments and I will stain all my
[2:42:03] raignment constantly, consistently. The
[2:42:07] language of the vineyard is used
[2:42:09] throughout the Bible. It speaks many
[2:42:13] times about the release of the joy and
[2:42:16] the celebration. At other times, it
[2:42:19] speaks about the wrath and judgment of
[2:42:22] God.
[2:42:24] This was a mystery, a bit of a mystery
[2:42:26] to me, but I I've done enough study
[2:42:28] through this that I understand God's
[2:42:31] reasoning.
[2:42:32] He uses an analogy that we can relate
[2:42:36] to, one that brings some warmth, some
[2:42:39] some uh you know fondness to our mind.
[2:42:44] He takes what we are familiar with in
[2:42:46] the positive and sometimes uses the the
[2:42:50] verbiage to present another side of the
[2:42:54] coin. This is the nature of God's word.
[2:42:58] Pressed, crushed to release their inner
[2:43:02] juice. There is no glory
[2:43:06] without pressing.
[2:43:08] The press is painful, but it's where the
[2:43:12] wine begins.
[2:43:14] Hallelujah. Wine doesn't begin in the
[2:43:16] fermentation. It begins in the crushing.
[2:43:19] The press equals pressure, trials,
[2:43:23] betrayal, grief, loss, misunderstanding.
[2:43:29] The outer skin
[2:43:31] has to be broken.
[2:43:35] I don't embrace the full theology of
[2:43:38] watchman knee by any stretch of the
[2:43:42] imagination
[2:43:44] but I will tell you that watchman knee
[2:43:47] had an amazing understanding
[2:43:51] of the breaking of that outer part of
[2:43:53] the soul life to release an inner
[2:43:57] character from the spirit.
[2:44:00] his spirit that has taken possession of
[2:44:05] a fallen human spirit and he has
[2:44:08] regenerated that spirit with his own
[2:44:11] life. I heard h praying about that
[2:44:15] release of his life. It's not without
[2:44:20] you.
[2:44:21] It's within you. It has to be released.
[2:44:25] So there is a breaking of the outer part
[2:44:29] so that the sweetness and the reality of
[2:44:32] the inner part can come forth. Oh God, I
[2:44:37] thank you for it. Lord, the process of
[2:44:39] wine making begins with emptied grapes,
[2:44:42] not full ones. Emptied grapes are what
[2:44:45] the king uses to make his wine. Even
[2:44:49] Jesus pressed
[2:44:51] in Gethsemane, which the very word
[2:44:54] Gethsemane means olive press. So it
[2:44:57] shouldn't be a mystery to us that even
[2:45:00] our Lord struggled in the press in
[2:45:04] Gethsemane when he cried, "My spirit is
[2:45:09] willing.
[2:45:12] My flesh is weak." And he could have
[2:45:14] easily said, "My soul is hung in the
[2:45:16] middle." Because that's the reality. If
[2:45:20] he if you were not made up of also mind,
[2:45:23] will and emotion, but only flesh and
[2:45:26] spirit, the battle would be won. The
[2:45:28] spirit could easily tackle the nature of
[2:45:31] the flesh and give you victory. But it's
[2:45:33] when mind, will, and emotion starts
[2:45:36] getting in the middle. And yet without
[2:45:39] that, we would have no connection. We
[2:45:41] would have no connection to those parts
[2:45:42] of who we are. There had to be the
[2:45:44] middle ground. I preached on the middle
[2:45:46] ground. on. It had to be that way. God
[2:45:48] knew what he was doing. He didn't curse
[2:45:50] you with mind, will, and emotions. He
[2:45:53] gifted you with mind, will, and emotion
[2:45:56] so that you could learn how to surrender
[2:45:58] mind, will, and emotions to his will.
[2:46:02] Are you still here? Now, I'm going to
[2:46:04] take a few more minutes. Musicians are
[2:46:06] getting ready. I won't do this justice,
[2:46:08] but just a little piece of this.
[2:46:10] Deuteronomy, if you'll go there just a
[2:46:12] moment. I found something interesting
[2:46:14] this week that I've never used in this
[2:46:17] subject before. Deuteronomy 26 20 verse
[2:46:21] 6. And what man is he that hath planted
[2:46:26] a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it?
[2:46:30] Let him also go and return unto his
[2:46:34] house, lest he die in the battle,
[2:46:38] and another man eat of it.
[2:46:42] This is an interesting verse. Would you
[2:46:44] agree? If it's lifted out of context,
[2:46:48] you'll never know what it means. But if
[2:46:50] you read it in the context of the
[2:46:52] chapter, you'll find out that
[2:46:55] Deuteronomy chapter 20 is a chapter
[2:46:58] where God is giving instructions to
[2:47:00] Israel about how warfare is to be
[2:47:03] handled, particularly the the drafting
[2:47:07] of a soldier. Before going into battle,
[2:47:10] the officers were commanded to make
[2:47:13] certain declarations that would release
[2:47:16] certain groups of men from military
[2:47:19] service at least on a temporary basis.
[2:47:23] These were not cowards.
[2:47:26] They were men with specific Listen,
[2:47:29] these were men with specific unfinished
[2:47:34] responsibilities
[2:47:37] that tied deeply into covenant law and
[2:47:42] cultural life. Why is he spared from the
[2:47:46] battle?
[2:47:47] Why is a man who planted a vineyard and
[2:47:50] have not yet eaten of it spared in the
[2:47:52] battle? I'll tell you why. because he
[2:47:54] swed in faith. And God
[2:47:58] God is passionate
[2:48:00] to let that man enjoy the fruit of his
[2:48:06] planting.
[2:48:08] I I'm amazed. I never knew this. I I
[2:48:11] read the verse and didn't didn't quite
[2:48:13] understand what it was saying because
[2:48:16] you catch it. If you don't look at the
[2:48:18] context, you miss it. He was spared in
[2:48:21] battle because God is passionate. He saw
[2:48:24] the man sewing in faith. What man plants
[2:48:27] a vineyard without expectation
[2:48:30] of picking grapes and making wine. Now
[2:48:34] there's a war and he's drafted to come
[2:48:37] and fight and he may never he may die.
[2:48:41] He may never eat the fruit of his own
[2:48:44] labor. And God said in the instructions,
[2:48:48] "Send him home."
[2:48:51] I don't want him fighting in the army of
[2:48:53] Israel
[2:48:55] until he has been rewarded
[2:48:58] for the labor of planting. I want to
[2:49:01] assure you that your planting has not
[2:49:04] been in vain. God may have changed your
[2:49:08] geography. He may have he may uh have
[2:49:11] taken you out of your own vineyard where
[2:49:15] you were familiar. You may have sowed
[2:49:17] here and sowed there and swed somewhere
[2:49:20] else. And each time God moved you
[2:49:22] somehow before you were able to enjoy
[2:49:25] the fruit of the labor that you had
[2:49:28] extended. But I'm telling you
[2:49:30] prophetically that God is passionate for
[2:49:34] those who sew in faith. and he will let
[2:49:38] your harvest follow you.
[2:49:42] That's how much he loves you. It was not
[2:49:45] in vain. It was not wasted labor.
[2:49:49] Your harvest is kept. It's recorded in
[2:49:52] the mind of God toward you.
[2:49:55] My according to Levitical law, I'm I'm
[2:50:00] preaching.
[2:50:03] According to Levitical law, a man who
[2:50:05] planted a vineyard couldn't eat its
[2:50:07] fruit for the first four years.
[2:50:14] Four years you plant a vineyard and four
[2:50:17] years go by, you can't even eat a grape.
[2:50:23] So when Deuteronomy 26 says he hasn't
[2:50:25] eaten of it yet, it's not because he was
[2:50:27] lazy or or or because something was
[2:50:29] delayed. It's because he was doing
[2:50:31] what's called obedient waiting.
[2:50:34] I'm waiting, but I'm not waiting as
[2:50:37] punishment.
[2:50:38] I'm waiting in obedience.
[2:50:41] I want to tell somebody that you're
[2:50:44] waiting is not punishment from God.
[2:50:48] It's it's your He's teaching us how to
[2:50:51] wait in obedience. Waiting in obedience
[2:50:54] is not passive waiting. It's active
[2:50:57] waiting. It's doing they that wait upon
[2:51:01] the Lord shall renew their strength. And
[2:51:05] this kind of waiting is not doing
[2:51:07] nothing.
[2:51:08] This kind of waiting is serving. And
[2:51:11] that's why you call the man who pours
[2:51:13] your tea a waiter. Come on. And the
[2:51:16] woman who gives you a napkin, a
[2:51:18] waitress,
[2:51:19] not because she's doing nothing for you,
[2:51:23] but because she's serving you. Waiting
[2:51:26] in obedience is where most of us are
[2:51:30] even in this hour.
[2:51:33] God is not going to allow your harvest
[2:51:38] to be lost
[2:51:40] because there has been delay
[2:51:44] in eating the fruit of what you've sown.
[2:51:48] He's not going to let you lose the
[2:51:50] harvest because it's taken a little
[2:51:52] longer for you to get to a place

[2:52:16] She did a whole lot of living
[2:52:19] and she did a whole lot of sinning.
[2:52:22] That's what sinners do.
[2:52:27] That's nothing. In fact, it's a
[2:52:30] compliment
[2:52:32] because it would be absolutely
[2:52:34] ridiculous
[2:52:36] not to fully surrender to God and not
[2:52:39] enjoy the life.
[2:52:43] If you're in sin, you're going to enjoy
[2:52:46] the life of sin. And you know how long
[2:52:49] that lasts?
[2:52:51] Not very long.
[2:52:53] Because the pleasures of sin are so
[2:52:56] temporal,
[2:52:59] she experienced hurt and pain and
[2:53:01] rejection and abuse and mistreatment
[2:53:04] because she was searching like the woman
[2:53:06] at the well
[2:53:09] for something that could satisfy.
[2:53:14] So when the news came, I want you kids
[2:53:16] to hear it. When the news came that
[2:53:18] Brenda has surrendered her heart to the
[2:53:20] Lord,
[2:53:22] there was a part of me, of course, my
[2:53:24] first reaction. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:53:29] But, but in total transparency, I think
[2:53:32] it's important for you to know there was
[2:53:34] a part of me that said, "Oh my."
[2:53:39] Because she had made that decision more
[2:53:41] than one time in her life.
[2:53:44] I wanted to be quiet. I'm not upset.
[2:53:49] But I want you to know something.
[2:53:52] This time,
[2:53:57] it was way more than a New Year's
[2:54:00] resolution
[2:54:02] or turning over a new leaf
[2:54:05] or another false start
[2:54:08] or another come to Jesus moment.
[2:54:12] I don't know why. I don't know what what
[2:54:15] took.
[2:54:17] I don't know what the difference was.
[2:54:20] But this time, she didn't just run to
[2:54:22] church.
[2:54:24] She ran to him and she ran to his word.
[2:54:30] And this is not to pull your emotions.
[2:54:33] It's just the fact. And and I can never
[2:54:35] get away from it. It's something I think
[2:54:37] of very often. I shared this testimony
[2:54:40] with someone most recently.
[2:54:44] When it took it took when her mind was
[2:54:47] made up, her mind was made up.
[2:54:51] And to this day, I can pick up a spoken
[2:54:55] word book
[2:54:57] because when she made up her mind,
[2:55:00] Sister Flo, to go all the way. She
[2:55:03] ordered every sermon book.
[2:55:06] I want them all. I want them close. I
[2:55:08] want to be able to read them. I want to
[2:55:10] be able to understand them.
[2:55:12] She ordered all of the spoken word
[2:55:15] books, had the new version, the new
[2:55:18] covers,
[2:55:20] and I only had old covers.
[2:55:23] And when she passed away, these books
[2:55:26] were given to me.
[2:55:29] And to this day, I can open up one of
[2:55:32] those books. The next time it happens,
[2:55:34] I'm going to save it for you.
[2:55:36] But I can open up a book and there
[2:55:39] between the pages is a long black
[2:55:43] dark hair
[2:55:47] about that long. She didn't put it there
[2:55:50] to keep her place. It fell off of her
[2:55:53] head and it remained in that book as a
[2:55:56] testimony, as a memorial
[2:56:00] that she wasn't just churchified.
[2:56:04] But even when she wasn't in church, she
[2:56:07] was pursuing the word.
[2:56:11] It's it's lifech changing. It's what
[2:56:14] makes the difference. If you get Sunday
[2:56:18] religion and Tuesday religion, it will
[2:56:21] never be enough. But if you'll chase the
[2:56:24] word on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday
[2:56:28] and Thursday and Friday and Saturday and
[2:56:32] Sunday,
[2:56:33] I'm not boasting on myself. I'm trying
[2:56:36] to encourage you. Last Sunday afternoon,
[2:56:39] you know what I did? Last Sunday
[2:56:41] afternoon, I do what I I did what I do
[2:56:44] almost every Sunday afternoon. I started
[2:56:46] on my sermon.
[2:56:49] I don't I don't think, okay, you've
[2:56:52] preached two hours, you've studied all
[2:56:53] week, you you ought to have a break. I
[2:56:56] can't help myself.
[2:56:58] I love this word. It is life to me. It's
[2:57:02] the reason I was born. It's what I get
[2:57:04] up in the morning for. It's why I go to
[2:57:07] bed at night to get a little rest for my
[2:57:09] mind so I can get up and chase that word
[2:57:12] again. And it makes a difference. She
[2:57:16] was at a place, a stage in her life
[2:57:18] where she could have some freedom to do
[2:57:20] that. She took it serious. And that
[2:57:22] word, not the preacher,
[2:57:25] that word that she ran after day after
[2:57:27] day,
[2:57:30] it changed her.
[2:57:36] And he took her
[2:57:39] and he took her.
[2:57:42] There was no real reason why
[2:57:45] she could not have survived and overcome
[2:57:48] what had come against her.
[2:57:52] It was doable. It was possible. She was
[2:57:54] not old. He had physical problems.
[2:57:59] But she could have. But God said, "No,
[2:58:01] no, no, no.
[2:58:03] I didn't take you when you were
[2:58:04] half-hearted."
[2:58:07] Amen. I didn't take you when you went to
[2:58:09] church on Easter.
[2:58:13] I've got a picture of Brenda at the old
[2:58:15] church on either Easter Sunday or
[2:58:18] Mother's Day Sunday where she came and
[2:58:20] some of the kids are with her and I got
[2:58:22] a picture on a yellow had on a yellow
[2:58:23] jacket or yellow dress standing out in
[2:58:26] front of the old church and it was so
[2:58:27] always good to see her. Always good to
[2:58:29] be around her. Always thankful that she
[2:58:32] came. But that's not when God decided,
[2:58:34] hey, I'm picking you. You know, I'm
[2:58:37] taking you now. He didn't do it when she
[2:58:39] was just a church on Easter or just a
[2:58:41] church on Mother's Day or here or there
[2:58:43] or or just, you know, partially. She
[2:58:46] knew what was right. Her mother had had
[2:58:48] lived it and taught it and walked it and
[2:58:50] and so forth. And she and she attended
[2:58:52] church in in the Graange for many, many
[2:58:55] years. I don't want to make her an awful
[2:58:57] terrible person except to tell you that
[2:58:58] she was undone without God and religion
[2:59:01] wasn't enough to change her life. But
[2:59:04] God didn't take her when she was in that
[2:59:06] place. Listen, he could have to I'm just
[2:59:08] on these I'm just on uh I'm just on the
[2:59:11] family, I guess. But he could have done
[2:59:12] the same. Jason could have left us any
[2:59:15] time. All the sinning and all the life
[2:59:18] that he's lived on that on that uh
[2:59:21] souped up bicycle that he drives
[2:59:30] with a head so hard he didn't barely
[2:59:32] need a helmet.
[2:59:36] Oh,
[2:59:40] could have gone, but no, Siri,
[2:59:44] God was preserving him for certain
[2:59:47] things in a certain season. And God
[2:59:51] said, "Brenda, you you you found me now,
[2:59:55] and I'm not going to leave you in the
[2:59:57] struggle
[2:59:59] with regret
[3:00:01] that chases us when we come to the Lord
[3:00:03] like that. I'm taking you to me."
[3:00:07] I know that if she could have had a
[3:00:09] choice, she would rather stayed with her
[3:00:10] family. I I I know that. I know that.
[3:00:15] But she must have known that Sister Flo
[3:00:18] would do enough threatening over the
[3:00:20] family for for her and everybody else in
[3:00:22] the county. And she just went with him
[3:00:25] when he called. Trophy. A trophy. A
[3:00:29] trophy. I can't wait to find another
[3:00:32] hair in the book because it tells me
[3:00:35] what her focus was on.
[3:00:39] How'd you get on that? Musicians are
[3:00:41] coming.
[3:00:45] obedient waiting. God honored that
[3:00:48] patient obedience by relieving him from
[3:00:50] battle. Send him home. He was allowed to
[3:00:53] go home and enjoy what he'd sown.
[3:00:56] I want you to see this. I'll I'll touch
[3:00:57] it more on Tuesday if the Lord will let
[3:01:00] me. But under Levitical law, a
[3:01:01] vineyard's fruit could not be eaten for
[3:01:03] the first three years, and only in the
[3:01:06] fourth year could its fruit then be
[3:01:09] taken and given, dedicated to God.
[3:01:13] And it was only in the fifth year
[3:01:17] that the man who planted the vineyard
[3:01:19] could have a grape.
[3:01:22] Five years
[3:01:24] and he finally gets a grape.
[3:01:29] God honored this investment.
[3:01:33] Gave such men an exemption from battle
[3:01:35] until their season of fulfillment had
[3:01:37] arrived.
[3:01:38] going to war and dying before eating
[3:01:40] from your vineyard meant another would
[3:01:43] reap what he had sowed. And God said,
[3:01:45] "Oh no, there is one fixed law that I
[3:01:49] will never forsake, and that is
[3:01:52] whatsoever a man seweth,
[3:01:55] he shall also reap." And that's in the
[3:01:58] good and in the bad. And I want you to
[3:02:01] flash Leviticus 19 up and and we're
[3:02:03] done.
[3:02:05] Leviticus 19 23-25. And when you shall
[3:02:08] come into the land, and shall have
[3:02:10] planted all manner of trees for food,
[3:02:12] then you shall count the fruit thereof
[3:02:14] as uncircumcised.
[3:02:17] Three years shall it be as uncircumcised
[3:02:20] unto you. It shall not be eaten of. But
[3:02:24] in the fourth year, all the fruit
[3:02:26] thereof shall be holy, to praise the
[3:02:29] Lord with all, dedicated to God, not
[3:02:34] consumed by the by the owner. And in the
[3:02:37] fifth year you shall eat of the fruit
[3:02:39] thereof, and it that it may yield unto
[3:02:42] you the increase thereof. And look how
[3:02:45] he signs off. I am the Lord.
[3:02:50] I am the Lord your God. I was your God
[3:02:54] when you were breaking the ground. I was
[3:02:57] your God when you were planting the
[3:02:59] vineyard. I was your God when you were
[3:03:02] chasing away the serpents. I was your
[3:03:05] God when I spared you from from dying as
[3:03:08] a soldier in the army. I am your God
[3:03:11] when you give me the fruit on the fourth
[3:03:15] year and then enjoy it for yourself on
[3:03:18] the I am the Lord your God. God makes
[3:03:21] room for the planter. He honors the
[3:03:25] investment. He wants you to taste the
[3:03:28] fruit
[3:03:30] of what you've labored for. My, you
[3:03:33] don't even know. Some of us, let's
[3:03:35] stand. Some of us don't even know the
[3:03:37] magnitude of the harvest that's coming.
[3:03:41] Amen.
[3:03:44] Because the enemy has told you over and
[3:03:47] over and over again, you've swn in vain.
[3:03:52] You've swn in the wind and you'll reap
[3:03:55] the whirlwind.
[3:03:57] You've swn in vain. You've messed up
[3:04:00] your life. You've made poor decisions.
[3:04:04] It's all over. It's finished. It's done.
[3:04:07] You'll barely get in.
[3:04:12] Barely. The enemy has told some of you,
[3:04:15] you'll barely get in by the skin of your
[3:04:18] teeth.
[3:04:20] But I want you to know that God has not
[3:04:23] lost the record of your sewing for him.
[3:04:28] That might be your tithe.
[3:04:31] It might be your witness.
[3:04:37] You be careful what kind of attitude you
[3:04:40] have toward brother Shaw
[3:04:45] and these brothers who have been a and
[3:04:48] Jerry is a you you don't know this but
[3:04:51] he is a social media sensation.
[3:04:56] He preaches on social media and people
[3:04:59] watch. They listen
[3:05:03] and on the street.
[3:05:06] You think you think you ought to have
[3:05:08] something positive to say about I think
[3:05:11] you should
[3:05:14] where are all the people? Look,
[3:05:16] uh that's up to God. Where he puts them,
[3:05:19] where he plants them.
[3:05:23] Because you don't see them this morning
[3:05:25] doesn't mean that they're not out there.
[3:05:29] Doesn't mean they haven't heard
[3:05:30] something they've never heard or seen
[3:05:32] something they've never seen
[3:05:35] or considered something they've never
[3:05:37] considered.
[3:05:39] You may not feel called to do what they
[3:05:41] do,
[3:05:43] but you ought to bless them and you
[3:05:46] ought to pray for them.
[3:05:48] It do some of us good to go with them.
[3:05:53] It might help us sometime to to to uh
[3:05:56] evaluate whether we really are believing
[3:06:00] what we believe or whether we're just
[3:06:02] slightly embarrassed.
[3:06:05] Listen, those two
[3:06:08] dark-kinned boys that met us the other
[3:06:10] day coming out of Chili Thai restaurant
[3:06:13] a few weeks ago and they start
[3:06:14] witnessing to me about their faith,
[3:06:17] inviting me to a Bible study, giving me
[3:06:20] a pamphlet. I took their pamphlet. I
[3:06:23] researched their faith. Their faith is
[3:06:25] based in Asia. Didn't know we had
[3:06:27] anything like this in America. It's a
[3:06:29] it's a supposedly a Christian church.
[3:06:32] They study the feast of Israel and do
[3:06:35] some things right. But one of the basis
[3:06:38] of their faith is is both father God, a
[3:06:42] father god and a mother god. God is a
[3:06:45] father and God is a mother. Not the same
[3:06:48] not the same expression.
[3:06:51] But there is a father and a mother.
[3:06:55] And uh I dug a little bit because I
[3:06:57] wanted to see the the sincerity of these
[3:07:00] boys was obvious.
[3:07:02] They were determined to be a witness and
[3:07:05] to be a light. But but what are they
[3:07:07] bringing people to? Some foolishness.
[3:07:12] So off the word perhaps making a someone
[3:07:16] a a a proelite. All right. but a
[3:07:19] two-fold child of hell. So why shouldn't
[3:07:22] somebody be a light?
[3:07:27] Why shouldn't everybody be a light? You
[3:07:30] You're not sowing in vain.
[3:07:33] Every coworker you've witnessed to,
[3:07:36] there's a record of it.
[3:07:39] God's not going to let somebody eat the
[3:07:41] the fruit of your labor. He's keeping a
[3:07:44] record.
[3:07:46] There's a reward. The Bible said for the
[3:07:49] faithful, for those who keep sowing,
[3:07:53] even when they don't see results, they
[3:07:55] keep praying, they keep doing, they keep
[3:07:58] preaching. God bless the little preacher
[3:08:01] who's preaching to a dozen this morning.
[3:08:04] May he keep doing what he's doing. May
[3:08:08] he pray a little bit to try to consider
[3:08:10] why he's only preaching to a dozen. But
[3:08:13] may he not stop
[3:08:16] because that's good enough. That's what
[3:08:18] the devil would like to paralyze
[3:08:21] somebody from sewing. So
[3:08:28] live this in front of your family. I
[3:08:30] can't get one of my family members to
[3:08:32] come all the way. Live it. Live it. Live
[3:08:34] it. Live it anyway. Live it anyway. Live
[3:08:38] it anyway. Sew anyway. When you have the
[3:08:40] opportunity, without judgment, without
[3:08:42] prejudice, without intent, without a
[3:08:45] hidden motive or or some mean, just do
[3:08:48] it because you love the Lord with all of
[3:08:51] your heart. Let him wash us. Let him
[3:08:54] crush us
[3:08:56] with his own feet.
[3:09:00] Gets pretty intense.
[3:09:03] Some of these uh wine presses had ropes
[3:09:08] tied above them.
[3:09:11] The traditional
[3:09:14] wine treader in Israel, grape treader,
[3:09:17] was not a woman. It was a young man,
[3:09:19] young teenage man upward from from even
[3:09:24] up in his early 20s.
[3:09:27] These young men were the ones that were
[3:09:29] generally chosen because they had some
[3:09:31] strength. They were coming into their
[3:09:33] strength
[3:09:34] and it wasn't like I don't mean I don't
[3:09:37] mean any harm or try to be carnal, but
[3:09:39] some of you are thinking about Lucy and
[3:09:40] Ethel and I it wasn't that kind of
[3:09:44] treading. They weren't Italians. This
[3:09:46] was uh this was Bible days. And it
[3:09:48] wasn't just some, you know, fun
[3:09:52] flip-flop kind of jumping around in a
[3:09:54] vat. This was serious business. And
[3:09:57] these young men would have to hold
[3:09:59] themselves up at times on the ropes
[3:10:01] because they weren't they weren't just
[3:10:03] using stepping pressure.
[3:10:07] They were using stomping pressure. And
[3:10:10] in the stomping they would lose their
[3:10:11] balance. And so they had these ropes.
[3:10:14] Sometime they would hold on to these
[3:10:16] ropes so they could keep some. And wait
[3:10:19] till I tell you what else they were
[3:10:20] doing. The Bible says they were shouting
[3:10:26] the whole time
[3:10:29] shouting.
[3:10:30] The word is not singing. Sometimes it
[3:10:34] was translated singing, but the but the
[3:10:37] Hebrew root word was not singing. It was
[3:10:40] shouting. It was a loud chant
[3:10:44] in unison to give God praise and to keep
[3:10:47] the rhythm of the stomping.
[3:10:51] Hallelujah.
[3:10:53] And when the shouting stopped, the joy
[3:10:56] stopped and somebody grew concerned.
[3:10:58] That's when they went to check on them
[3:11:00] to see if somebody passed out because
[3:11:03] the labor was intense and the work was
[3:11:05] hard and and they found that even in the
[3:11:09] hard labor, they could shout his praise.
[3:11:12] Hallelujah.
[3:11:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:11:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:11:20] Hallelujah. Despise not the chastening
[3:11:23] of the Lord.
[3:11:25] No, no, no. Embrace the process. Embrace
[3:11:29] and cooperate and participate in the in
[3:11:33] the process of of your perfection.
[3:11:37] Hallelujah. Your maturity.
[3:11:41] You're growing up.
[3:11:44] Oh, grow us up.
[3:11:47] Hallelujah.
[3:11:48] because we need
[3:11:51] we need authority.
[3:11:53] Oh yes, we need to understand our
[3:11:55] position. Let's worship the Lord. I know
[3:11:58] it's late 2009. I'd like to point out to
[3:12:01] someone who mentioned that we're getting
[3:12:04] out of church at 3. I would like to
[3:12:06] mention that it's 2:09
[3:12:09] and we ain't out yet.
[3:12:12] Come and worship. Worship, Pinky.
[3:12:21] who knew no sin
[3:12:24] that we might become
[3:12:28] his rightousness.
[3:12:31] He humbled him. He humbled himself
[3:12:36] and carried the cross.
[3:12:38] [Music]
[3:12:42] Love so amazing.
[3:12:49] Love so amazing.
[3:12:57] Jesus Messiah,
[3:13:00] [Music]
[3:13:04] the name above all
[3:13:08] names.
[3:13:11] The blessed redeemer.
[3:13:18] You are Emmanuel.

[3:20:20] You deserve the glory.
[3:20:25] You may not be able this morning to
[3:20:27] identify where you are in the process,
[3:20:31] but how many of you can say, "I know I'm
[3:20:34] in process.
[3:20:36] I'm somewhere. I'm either in the
[3:20:38] crushing still or I'm being poured from
[3:20:41] vessel to vessel each time leaving
[3:20:43] behind the dregs. But I know I know that
[3:20:46] I know that I know that I've been chosen
[3:20:49] as the vintage of the Lord. I'm his. I'm
[3:20:54] part of his inheritance.
[3:20:56] Hallelujah. I'll bring glory. My life
[3:21:00] will bring glory to the king. Do you
[3:21:03] believe that about the call of God on
[3:21:05] your life? If you believe that you're
[3:21:08] born to bring glory to the king, I want
[3:21:10] you to witness to it somehow raising up
[3:21:12] your hand or something waving at me or
[3:21:15] something by faith. I believe that I'm
[3:21:18] here for a purpose greater than just a
[3:21:21] being a a a pew warmer or or a Christian
[3:21:25] only nominal in this in these last days.
[3:21:29] I I I know where the answer is. The
[3:21:32] answer is in participating and
[3:21:34] cooperating with the process and that is
[3:21:37] a thousand times easier in his presence.
[3:21:41] If we can learn to get in his presence
[3:21:43] as often as possible,
[3:21:47] it'll make a difference. I want you to
[3:21:49] sing this with me. It's in my heart
[3:21:52] really strong. I want you to sing into
[3:21:54] thy chamber with me just a moment. This
[3:21:57] is This is the answer. It's hard. It's
[3:22:01] hard
[3:22:02] for some of us to find that place
[3:22:04] because life demands so much out of us.
[3:22:12] But we must.
[3:22:16] We must. Somewhere between
[3:22:19] fathering and grandfathering,
[3:22:22] mothering and grandmothering, whatever
[3:22:24] it is we do,
[3:22:27] serving in whatever capacity,
[3:22:30] we've got to find this place. It will it
[3:22:33] will bring the it'll bring us to wine a
[3:22:36] whole lot quicker than not cooperating.
[3:22:40] Somebody ought to surrender this
[3:22:42] morning, this afternoon, in a way you've
[3:22:44] never surrendered before. Lord, I will.
[3:22:46] I will. I will. I will.
[3:22:50] Into
[3:22:53] the chamber.
[3:22:56] Be free. Holy
[3:22:59] Spirit.
[3:23:02] Speak to me gently
[3:23:07] as I
[3:23:13] heaven. Godly
[3:23:16] lover,
[3:23:18] let thy presence
[3:23:22] cover.
[3:23:24] [Music]
[3:23:36] Come my
[3:23:38] beloved,
[3:23:41] be my Lord
[3:23:44] and Master
[3:23:47] as I yield
[3:23:50] myself
[3:23:53] unto
[3:23:55] me to thee.
[3:23:58] Let thy holy word wrap around me.
[3:24:04] Wrap around me. Sorry. I plead
[3:24:08] my defense,
[3:24:11] protection,
[3:24:14] and covering
[3:24:18] me.
[3:24:20] Oh, into
[3:24:23] thy chamber.
[3:24:25] [Music]
[3:24:30] See if you can connect with the words.
[3:24:33] Speak to me gently
[3:24:38] as I close
[3:24:40] the door.
[3:24:42] Heavenly lover,
[3:24:50] this would change your life. I'm here to
[3:24:53] tell you today, this will change your
[3:24:55] life.
[3:25:00] is all I long for.
[3:25:06] Father,
[3:25:08] I worship
[3:25:11] you out of my spirit,
[3:25:17] blessing
[3:25:19] and thanking
[3:25:22] you in our own way.
[3:25:28] Your heart
[3:25:31] I command,
[3:25:34] Lord, your will
[3:25:36] and purpose.
[3:25:39] So into
[3:25:42] submission
[3:25:44] I surrender.
[3:25:48] Will you do it
[3:25:51] into
[3:25:53] thy
[3:25:56] be free?
[3:25:58] [Music]
[3:26:00] Be free. Holy Ghost,
[3:26:03] speak to me. Speak to me
[3:26:07] as I close
[3:26:11] the door.
[3:26:14] Heavenly.
[3:26:16] [Music]
[3:26:17] You don't know what God's doing. Some of
[3:26:20] you don't even know what he's doing for
[3:26:22] you right now as you yield to him.
[3:26:26] Shakina.
[3:26:27] in
[3:26:30] all.
[3:26:34] Here's the last verse. Now on my
[3:26:39] journey,
[3:26:41] the wine press falls heavy,
[3:26:46] but it's bringing
[3:26:49] forth only
[3:26:52] the best
[3:26:54] of the world.
[3:26:58] So I pressed to
[3:27:01] the mark for
[3:27:03] the prize of my calling to be a part of
[3:27:12] that beautiful
[3:27:15] lady.
[3:27:19] [Music]
[3:27:21] into
[3:27:25] be free.
[3:27:30] I will not restrain you.
[3:27:35] I will not limit you, spirit of God.
[3:27:39] [Music]
[3:27:54] Shine up.
[3:27:57] [Music]
[3:28:04] If it's appropriate to do so, take the
[3:28:06] hand of someone near you. Father, here
[3:28:09] we are.
[3:28:11] We must have surrendered a thousand
[3:28:13] times,
[3:28:15] 20,000 times,
[3:28:18] and we meant it each time. But here we
[3:28:21] are again today, Lord. This is a very
[3:28:23] prophetic moment.
[3:28:26] And so in this moment, in this season,
[3:28:28] in this hour, we want to surrender
[3:28:30] again.
[3:28:32] But this time, we want to do it with a
[3:28:34] knowledge that there will be no limit.
[3:28:37] There will be no restraint. There will
[3:28:40] be no restriction placed on you.
[3:28:43] We want to enter into that chamber, into
[3:28:46] that crushing, and we want you to
[3:28:49] accomplish all that is in your heart to
[3:28:51] accomplish.
[3:28:53] We may squirm and we may we may moan,
[3:28:56] but we we commit
[3:29:00] that we will not wiggle our way out from
[3:29:03] under your foot. We will not navigate or
[3:29:07] negotiate our way. Harosa,
[3:29:11] we will not negotiate our way out of
[3:29:15] your plan,
[3:29:17] out of your preparation. We will say yes
[3:29:21] again and yes again and yes again.
[3:29:29] Jonathan, raise up both of your hands.
[3:29:31] There's something in this for you right
[3:29:35] now.
[3:29:38] The Lord was reminding me of the sewing
[3:29:40] you've done
[3:29:44] on the journey and ways that there there
[3:29:47] are people here that have no idea the
[3:29:50] ways that you have sown.
[3:29:53] And we know for sure that Satan didn't
[3:29:56] like it.
[3:29:57] But we're thankful that God has kept a
[3:30:00] record of the seed. Hallelujah.
[3:30:04] And I feel like telling you to be
[3:30:06] encouraged in the Lord because he has
[3:30:09] kept a record and the harvest is secure
[3:30:14] and the obedient waiting that you're
[3:30:17] doing right now is being recognized. It
[3:30:20] has caught the attention of the father's
[3:30:23] purpose in your life. A and he just
[3:30:26] wanted you to know that it's coming. The
[3:30:28] harvest is coming. It's coming. It's
[3:30:32] coming. You're not one seed. Not one
[3:30:36] seed fallen to the wayside. Not one
[3:30:40] seed. Even in all the turns and twists
[3:30:44] of life, in all of the strengths and
[3:30:47] weaknesses of life, in all of the poor
[3:30:51] choices and good choices in life, he's
[3:30:55] jealous over his seed. He's jealous over
[3:30:58] his word.
[3:31:00] and he will perform everything that he
[3:31:03] has promised to perform. His word will
[3:31:06] not return unto him void. Maybe somebody
[3:31:10] else would like to get in under the
[3:31:11] skirts of that and you'd like to claim
[3:31:14] that in your own life for the times that
[3:31:17] you have done what God placed on your
[3:31:19] heart. You're not here telling God he
[3:31:22] owes you anything. The harvest is not
[3:31:25] yours. It's his harvest. you get
[3:31:29] benefits and blessings from it. But it's
[3:31:32] the harvest of the Lord that we're
[3:31:35] talking about. So, put yourself under uh
[3:31:38] that banner right now, your feet under
[3:31:41] the table, and say, "Lord, I'm believing
[3:31:45] for the harvest of every seed sown in
[3:31:49] faith and reward for the obedient
[3:31:52] waiting.
[3:32:00] Get serious about the king. Would you do
[3:32:02] that? Get serious about the kingdom. Now
[3:32:06] on
[3:32:08] my journey,
[3:32:11] the wine press
[3:32:14] falls heavy,
[3:32:16] but it's bringing forth
[3:32:20] only
[3:32:22] the best of
[3:32:25] the world.
[3:32:27] So I press
[3:32:30] toward the mark
[3:32:33] for the prize
[3:32:38] to be a part
[3:32:42] that beautiful.
[3:32:45] We're joined together in faith, Lord,
[3:32:47] right now that nothing will stop it.
[3:32:50] That nothing will stop the process. We
[3:32:53] are yielding to you in every way that we
[3:32:56] know how. We say yes even under the
[3:33:00] heavy steps. Even under the heavy feet
[3:33:03] of the Lord, we say yes
[3:33:08] for your glory.
[3:33:10] For the king, for the king that the lamb
[3:33:13] may receive the reward of his suffering.
[3:33:32] once more into thy chamber
[3:33:36] into
[3:33:38] [Music]
[3:33:40] be free.
[3:33:44] Will you free him? Will you loose him?
[3:33:48] Will you let him do it his way?
[3:33:54] Maybe he's just trying to cut you loose
[3:33:56] from it.
[3:34:01] Maybe he's just trying to cut you loose
[3:34:05] from the responsibility.
[3:34:16] [Music]
[3:34:22] Sweet Jesus.
[3:34:25] Sweet Jesus.
[3:34:29] Sweet Jesus.
[3:34:35] This is the most that some of us have
[3:34:37] been in a week.
[3:34:42] May we not miss one whisper.
[3:34:47] Not even one glance of your eye. May we
[3:34:50] not miss any of it.
[3:34:53] May we recognize every nudge to be of
[3:34:55] you.
[3:34:57] And may we thank you for grace and
[3:34:59] strength to be obedient in all things.
[3:35:02] My God, you're
[3:35:12] empty us.
[3:35:14] Empty us. You filled us. Empty us.
[3:35:20] I want to be poured out.
[3:35:23] We stand today with the desire to be
[3:35:26] like Mary's alabaster box, broken and
[3:35:30] poured out for the master.
[3:35:33] Nothing else matters.
[3:35:35] What people think or say does not
[3:35:37] matter.
[3:35:40] What they understand and don't
[3:35:41] understand does not matter. But to
[3:35:45] please you matters. Lord, to please you
[3:35:47] matters.
[3:35:50] To please you in all things matters. Go
[3:35:52] with us today. Keep us, oh God, with a
[3:35:56] hunger for your word.
[3:35:59] thirsty for more of your spirit,
[3:36:03] surrendered and submitted
[3:36:06] to not only your voice but every signal.
[3:36:11] You said you would direct us with your
[3:36:13] eye.
[3:36:15] May we discern and know your will. May
[3:36:18] we may we come out of that place where
[3:36:21] we think it's all about us
[3:36:24] and find and discover a place where it's
[3:36:27] nothing is really about us. But
[3:36:29] everything is about you.
[3:36:32] We'll be thankful. Heal the sick. It's
[3:36:35] just that simple. We believe. We believe
[3:36:37] that every stripe on your back paid the
[3:36:40] price for our healing. And we refuse
[3:36:43] symptoms. And we resist the affliction
[3:36:46] of the enemy. And we stand on the
[3:36:48] promise of of the fact that you are
[3:36:51] still
[3:36:52] you are still Yahweh Rafa. You are still
[3:36:56] the healer.
[3:37:01] I didn't get to it in my note, but you
[3:37:03] are still Yahweh Sabo.
[3:37:07] You are still the God of angel armies.
[3:37:10] You are still the God of the heavenly
[3:37:12] host.
[3:37:14] And we surrender and thank you for your
[3:37:17] for everything that is at your disposal,
[3:37:19] everything that is at your command.
[3:37:22] You send and assist.
[3:37:25] You equip
[3:37:27] and you provide.
[3:37:29] And we go in the great revelation
[3:37:33] that it's in your hands.
[3:37:38] You're dismissed to go after you've
[3:37:39] loved one another. But we're going to
[3:37:42] sing this. It's already done. As you as
[3:37:45] you greet one another, I just feel it. I
[3:37:48] didn't It wasn't in my mind, but it's in
[3:37:50] my heart now.
