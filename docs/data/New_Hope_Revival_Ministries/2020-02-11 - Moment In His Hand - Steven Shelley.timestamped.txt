[0:00] but I want you to know when God has a
[0:01] thought about you it's done
[0:10] in his mind before the cross he already
[0:14] paid the price in in our earthly realm
[0:19] of time it had not yet happened yet but
[0:23] from the first moment he thought it in
[0:26] that eternal realm it was done now God
[0:32] had to speak it into time for it to
[0:35] happen in our dimension in our realm but
[0:38] I want you to know when God has a
[0:40] thought about you it's done all the
[0:44] variables that will come come in the
[0:47] realm of time but in the realm of
[0:50] eternity when God thought about you and
[0:52] saw that you would have that that grace
[0:56] that that desire to choose him from that
[1:01] moment you were saved salvation was
[1:06] secured we're going to experience
[1:09] something in our life maybe that we
[1:11] recognize that in our flesh we could
[1:13] never be saved in our flesh we could
[1:16] never pay enough price in our own
[1:18] righteousness we could never be accepted
[1:21] in his sight but because of what he has
[1:24] done and I'll tell you how valuable you
[1:28] were to him he didn't just think this
[1:31] ugly bloody messy painful plan he lived
[1:35] it he became flesh so that he could
[1:40] secure it with his own life with his own
[1:45] blood by his own sacrifice what God in
[1:51] his right mind according to the thoughts
[1:53] of man would come up with a plan that
[1:56] would cost him so much that would be so
[2:00] much pain and suffering and agony and
[2:04] yet he did you tell me a God's gonna go
[2:07] to the trouble that he went to to bring
[2:09] salvation to us to walk in a man's body
[2:11] to shed God's blood to suffer in crime
[2:14] in agony like he did and then let your
[2:17] inability to hold on to him determine
[2:24] your eternity I don't believe it no man
[2:30] shall pluck him from my hand
[2:36] [Music]
