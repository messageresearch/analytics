[0:00] Jesus is Alive he hasn't lost his power
[0:04] he's still able to heal the sick and
[0:06] raise the Dead He's Alive this time in
[0:09] his church he's not in a one-man body
[0:13] anymore he came because of shavat he
[0:16] came there they were gathered together
[0:19] in the upper room they had some business
[0:21] to take care of his promise that promise
[0:25] that he made I will not leave you
[0:27] comfortless I will come to you you shall
[0:30] be ued you shall be infused with power
[0:35] from on high and that wasn't a third
[0:38] person in a
[0:39] trinity you need to know that there's no
[0:42] such thing that's the very same spirit
[0:46] that overshadowed Mary and she conceived
[0:50] as a virgin that's the very same spirit
[0:54] that spoke and created everything that
[0:57] we know in creation same spirit and this
[1:01] time it fell on a body of Believers I'm
[1:05] so thankful to be a a a
[1:09] beneficiary of the outpouring of the
[1:12] holy spirit it's the Living Word it's
[1:15] the living Christ inside of you that's
[1:18] going to move the enemy and he will move
[1:21] he how do you know cuz he has he does
[1:25] and he will you can speak to symptoms
[1:27] you can speak to your neighbor you can
[1:30] speak to your wife you can speak to your
[1:31] children I know I'm whole I know I'm
[1:36] Healed and he's able he said if we would
[1:39] make the right confession that's not a
[1:42] thought a confession may start with a
[1:45] thought but a confession is something
[1:47] that comes out of your mouth with some
[1:50] vocal cords some tongue action amen he
[1:54] said he was able to make your your
[1:58] body your body all the bones and the
[2:02] muscles and the blood vessels and the
[2:05] capillaries all the all the systems and
[2:09] organs of your body that make up this
[2:11] flesh body that you live in he said he
[2:14] is able to make your body obey your body
[2:19] it's part of creation and therefore it
[2:22] has to submit itself to the authority of
[2:25] the
[2:26] Creator is that right now what if you're
[2:29] confessing I'm
[2:31] dying what if he makes your body obey
[2:33] your
[2:37] confession what if you're confessing
[2:39] this is killing
[2:41] me my toe is killing me is it is that
[2:46] the message you want him to Bear Before
[2:48] the Throne that's the great high priest
[2:50] of your confession that your toast
[2:52] killing you you're looking at me funny
[2:55] on tell the Bible said we're snared not
[2:58] by what we think
[3:00] we're snared by the words of our mouth
[3:03] you can think the wrong thing and pull
[3:04] it down before it ever becomes words but
[3:08] once it comes out of your
[3:11] mouth there's an
[3:14] obligation to that word that comes out
[3:16] of your mouth Lord I'm here to Bear uh
[3:19] my brother's testimony my sister's
[3:20] testimony to
[3:22] you they've got so much anxiety they can
[3:25] barely come to the house of God
[3:30] he is the high priest
[3:34] of sometimes you have to be willing to
[3:36] be a little
[3:39] uncomfortable to obey his
[3:42] word there's power in obeying God's word
[3:46] I wouldn't want that to be my
[3:48] confession I'm so nervous I'm just about
[3:51] to fall to
[3:52] pieces somebody's going to have to pick
[3:54] me up I've been there so you rewire your
[3:58] mind by grabbing a hold of the promise
[4:00] of God and saying I have already
[4:04] overcome anxiety by the blood of the
[4:07] lamb and by the word of my testimony I
[4:11] testify that the work is done it's
[4:15] finished and I'm not going to wait till
[4:18] I feel
[4:20] it to move in the opposite
[4:24] Spirit I'm going to do it now I'm going
[4:26] to put myself out there now what
