[0:00] The reason for the misunderstanding
[0:04] is to get you ready for the tabernacle.
[0:06] &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the tent.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the pavilion.
[0:13] It's to get you ready for the hiding
[0:15] place
[0:17] &gt;&gt; where he can set you up on a rock and
[0:18] let you sing the high songs of Zion
[0:21] &gt;&gt; no matter what's going on around you.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Did you know heaven knows you by name?
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Did you know hell knows you by name?
[0:31] You're known in both worlds. You're
[0:34] known in both dimensions. And yet, the
[0:37] promise of God's word is, I want to hide
[0:39] my people in a place where they are
[0:42] undetected
[0:45] &gt;&gt; by the one who has come to destroy.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Now, what have you got to do to get in
[0:50] that place? You've got to go through the
[0:51] vessel
[0:53] &gt;&gt; of misunderstanding.
[0:55] You've got to drink the dregs
[0:57] &gt;&gt; of rejection.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to go through that place of
[1:02] being scrutinized.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Everything you do, criticized,
[1:07] &gt;&gt; misunderstood.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't like it. I don't
[1:11] know anybody that does like it. But if
[1:13] on the other side of that, I can hide in
[1:16] the folds of his tent. If I can find my
[1:18] shelter in his tabernacle,
[1:21] &gt;&gt; if he'll give me a pavilion where I am
[1:23] undetected from the enemy,
[1:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; It's talking about a heavy glory.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; It's cavode
[1:34] kabod.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; It's a heavy glory. It It's what the
[1:38] old-timers used to call shakina
[1:41] &gt;&gt; shakana.
[1:43] It's a heavyweighted
[1:45] glory of God. And when that heavy glory
[1:48] comes down, you may not be able to
[1:50] scream.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to dance.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; You may just only be able to open your
[1:56] mouth and say, "Oh,
[2:01] &gt;&gt; I stand in awe
[2:04] &gt;&gt; of the beauty of my God."
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful?
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. Is Jesus
[2:11] beautiful? Is the Messiah beautiful?
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful to look on now?
[2:17] &gt;&gt; There was a time he wasn't beautiful to
[2:19] look on. No one desired to see him.
[2:21] Isaiah prophesied no clumliness was
[2:24] found in him. He was misfigured.
[2:27] He was misshapen by in by sin, by
[2:30] iniquity, so that no one desired to look
[2:33] on him. And the reality is his little
[2:35] bride that's transitioning in this hour
[2:38] from bride to wife, all we want to do is
[2:40] look at him. Because to us, he's
[2:43] beautiful.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Here is his beauty.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; It's unveiled. It's revealed. He is
[2:54] standing now out in front of the
[2:57] lattice.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; He's near enough to smell his presence.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what the Song of
[3:05] Solomon says.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; The Song of Songs.
[3:10] Who is this
[3:14] that I see coming up out of the
[3:16] wilderness?
[3:21] &gt;&gt; What's the rest?
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Leaning. Leaning. Come on. Lean.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Leaning on her beloved.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; It goes on to tell us she smells.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Like he smells.
[3:38] Amen.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Because she's been leaning on him.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; You lean on him, brother, sister. Lean
[3:45] on him, brother, sister. And you'll come
[3:47] out smelling like him
[3:50] &gt;&gt; because you've been with him.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Because you know him,
[3:56] &gt;&gt; because you've been in the tent,
[4:02] &gt;&gt; under the pavilion,
[4:04] &gt;&gt; under the tabernacle,
[4:07] He's not looking for a a a badger skin
[4:10] tent anymore. He's not looking for a
[4:14] sanctuary of the cedars of Lebanon
[4:17] anymore.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a temple, a tabernacle,
[4:21] a shelter of flesh.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a body.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; It's in Christ where the bride becomes
[4:32] wife.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] It's in the word
[4:38] &gt;&gt; where the bride becomes wife.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to be engaged to Christ.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; It's another thing to be his wife.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; A lot of church people have flings, one
[4:51] night stands with the bridegroom.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a for just a lover.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a wife.
[5:04] So, there's something about this
[5:06] pavilion. There's something about this
[5:08] tabernacle. There's something about this
[5:11] shelter, this covert, this refuge.
[5:15] There's something about this rock.
[5:18] There's something about this hiding
[5:20] place.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; That speaks of of rapture.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; It speaks of translation.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; It speaks of a change.
[5:34] It speaks of a difference that the word
[5:37] makes.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; It speaks about something that takes
[5:42] place in privacy.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Not in the public view,
[5:49] &gt;&gt; not a public show,
[5:52] &gt;&gt; the door is closed.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Enter into thy
[5:59] closet.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Or chamber. Amen.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Close the door.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going to talk to you.
[6:07] That's where you're going to find your
[6:08] refuge.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; That's where the change is going to take
[6:12] place.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; That's where you'll go in one way and
[6:14] come out another. Did you hear that?
[6:18] &gt;&gt; You'll go in one way and come out
[6:20] another way.
