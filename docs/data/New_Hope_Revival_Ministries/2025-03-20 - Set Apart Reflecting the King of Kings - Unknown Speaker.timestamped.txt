[0:00] you see the daughters of Zion forgot who
[0:02] they were
[0:04] representing they weren't just
[0:05] representing their Soldier husbands but
[0:08] they were representing the god of Israel
[0:12] The God Who dwelt in Zion and so they
[0:14] were not just reflecting on their
[0:17] families or their parents or where they
[0:20] came from but they were actually
[0:22] reflecting on the god of History the god
[0:25] of Israel the God who brought his
[0:28] children out of Egypt The God Who fed
[0:31] him with Mana who fed them with Quail
[0:33] The God Who allowed water to come out of
[0:36] a rock when they were thirsty and when
[0:38] the water was bitter he made a way for
[0:40] the water to be sweet and when the ocean
[0:43] kept them back he opened up the sea and
[0:46] made a way for them to pass through
[0:49] that's a God who loved his
[0:51] people a God who was faithful to them
[0:55] and a God who wanted a people who would
[0:58] walk before him in
[1:00] humility in meekness in humbleness of
[1:04] heart both genders men who would not be
[1:08] so proud of their military might that
[1:11] they didn't give God credit for his
[1:13] strength and courage women who wouldn't
[1:16] be so proud of their beauty that they
[1:19] would uh pick up the ways of Egypt and
[1:22] the ways of the amalekites and the ways
[1:24] of the Canaanites because he wanted a
[1:28] separated people if God said I don't
[1:31] want your peas and your corn to grow in
[1:34] the same row he wanted even their Farm
[1:37] to be identified as belonging to a child
[1:41] of the king of kings Jehovah God and so
[1:46] if he cared about that so much that he
[1:49] even told them under that ceremonial law
[1:52] that your clothes could not be made of
[1:54] mixed fiber and there were all kinds of
[1:57] added Securities played
[2:00] on how they would dress and how they
[2:02] would live how they would worship how
[2:05] they would bring offerings unto the Lord
[2:07] it was a very organized and a very
[2:10] meticulous plan that God had created for
[2:13] his people how it must have grieved his
[2:18] heart when he saw them beginning to put
[2:22] on the bracelets and put on the anklets
[2:25] and put on the all of the different
[2:27] things the twistings of the hair and the
[2:30] ways that they would try to make them
[2:32] it's not that God wanted his women to be
[2:36] ugly it's not that God cared if the
[2:38] Israelite women uh were beautiful he he
[2:42] made them beautiful he just didn't want
[2:45] them taking on the appearance of the
[2:49] women of of
[2:51] heathenism the women of
[2:54] paganism the way the women of false
[2:57] religion he said they can be beautiful
[3:00] but they don't have to put on and Trust
[3:02] in changing of garments and and all of
[3:06] these mirrors and all the time do you
[3:09] know that even in Victorian days women
[3:12] use mirrors as part of their outfit and
[3:15] they used fans as part of of their
[3:18] outfit and they would walk around
[3:20] looking at themselves this is a spirit
[3:23] of Pride and God said I'm going to have
[3:26] a people and they're not going to be
[3:28] necessarily homeless
[3:30] they're going to be a beautiful people
[3:32] I'm going to beautify them with
[3:34] salvation they're going to walk
[3:36] differently they're going to talk
[3:38] differently they're going to dress
[3:40] differently they're going to definitely
[3:43] differentiate between the genders but I
[3:46] don't want them picking up too many of
[3:50] the
[3:51] habits of the other
[3:53] nations because if they do there's no
[3:57] stopping place it's the slippery slope
[4:01] and if it was only out there we could
[4:03] lock ourselves away in some little box
[4:06] somewhere but it's not just out there
[4:09] it'll creep right in among
[4:12] us if we don't make a stand and you
[4:16] ought to aim in the word if you have to
[4:18] follow it with an oh
[4:19] me is this the thing that matters the
[4:22] most no it doesn't matter the most what
[4:25] matters the most is are you born again
[4:28] are you washed in the blood of Jesus
[4:31] Christ baptized in his name Sanctified
[4:34] by the word filled with the Holy Ghost
[4:37] that is the main thing but there are
[4:41] other things that follow the main
[4:43] attraction and these are those things
[4:47] come out from among
[4:51] themen and be separate sayth the Lord
