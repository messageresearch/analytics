TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I'm coming to you again today from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming today in partnership with the gospel channel I'm so grateful to the Lord for giving us this opportunity to continue in the word with you in a series that we've been working on for some time we started on schemes and devices of the enemy and then we transitioned into demonic doorways we've been getting a tremendous amount of response I think it's because people can relate to being in the heat of the battle but I want to remind you today that no matter how hot the battle gets no matter how intense the warfare seems in your life Jesus is the victor Yeshua our Messiah has won the victory and because of his victory we can have the victory because he overcame the world he gives us grace he grants us the strength to also overcome any obstacle or any attack that the enemy would try to use against us in this hour one of the ways we know that you have been able to relate to the program's lately it's because of your tremendous response and this is a folder and these on top are the most recent prayer requests that have come in and I would say 99% of them 98% 99% of them have come in from the television broadcast which is so encouraging to us we have some correspondents through the website and contacts that we have around the world but lately the majority of these requests have come from those of you who watched the program and some call back and some feel comfortable enough to share really sometimes the details and the struggle that they're going through and and I believe it's because somehow you have sensed through the program that we care about you I I always so I often let me say it this way I often feel insufficient in many many areas of ministry but there's one area that I really don't feel insufficient in because it's shaped my life and that is in the arena of Prayer I learned as a small boy serving the Lord and with a precious praying granny I learned the power of prayer and prayer changes things and so it is a great honor and a great privilege for all of us at New Hope revival ministries to join with you over your prayer needs so some call and some send in emails and we even get an occasional letter in the mail and we just want to be in contact with you I don't think I mentioned lately maybe the last couple of broadcasts that if you miss an episode especially if we're doing a series and you miss an episode all you have to do is look for us on YouTube we have a youtube channel that is growing and it is expanding in fact if you will just click a button that says subscribe then you'll have an opportunity to be updated and notified when we add new programming new materials not only can you watch the programs that we do for the gospel channel but you can also see other encouraging bits and pieces of what the Lord has called us to do there there's some music there there are there's one section that's rather new that I think you might be blessed by and it's called new hope moments and it's just very short clips that are taken out of live services here at the River sinner and I think and I believe that God is using them to encourage people they're getting shared they're getting out there and we're getting feedback that says you know sometimes when I can't listen to an entire sermon well I can click on new hope moments and I can catch something that's inspirational and and truly that's part of what we want to do is to encourage you and to inspire you there is a lot of bad news there's a lot of darkness there's a lot of ugliness that goes on around us in the hour that we're living in and so if we can find something that reminds us to look to Jesus to go to the word for our strength and for our help then by all means we need more of that in our life so I invite you and strongly encourage you to visit our youtube channel also our website revival dot org it's a real joy to be able to hear what the Lord is doing around the world in this late hour I believe the hour is late I believe that we're living in the last of the last days and I believe that it's a good thing it really is a good thing because we have now come to the hour where I believe that God desires to have relationship with his people and in a way that I think we could almost say an unprecedented way because we need him we are depending on him for our help and our strength you know the church well she got sort of puffed up and pride through the years through the great waves of revival and she began to be maybe a little overly confident and she began to build her structures and her programs and maybe well not maybe let me be honest let me be Who I am she began to trust in those things just like Israel in the Bible we read about how God miraculously super naturally moved for the children of Israel time and time again and even throughout the prophets of the Old Testament how that they would rehearse before the people the goodnesses of God to the nation of Israel but so many times the rebuke would follow you began to trust in these things you began to feel like that the power was in your hand and the strength was in your hand you begin to mix yourself with other gods and you begin to feel invincible by yourself and so this brought great turmoil and great heartache upon the children of Israel the nation of Israel down through the years it seems like the same thing happened in the church world there there they came to a place where they were seeing great prosperity and these waves of revival were coming in the ebbs and flows and more people were interested and engaged and so forth and and so more structure had to had to follow and more programs and more seeker-sensitive christianity and let's don't rock the boat let's don't say anything that might offend somebody in their sin and the next thing you know Jesus is standing you've heard us say this here before Jesus is standing on the outside of his own church the Church of Laodicea knocking on the door let me in let me in If any man would would let me in open the door I would come in and sup with him and he with me and this is the hour this is the season of the Lord's Supper of the Lord's fellowshipping he desires to come in to have you and I to close the door as he enters in we closed the door behind him and we sit down and we fellowship with who he is sometimes in that moment we can't ask for another thing because we're so overwhelmed with the goodness God all that he would come all that he would acknowledge me or that he would desire to have fellowship with me we get overwhelmed in the Lord's choosing I want you to know the Bible is clear he chose me before I ever had the opportunity to say yes to him thanks be to God he said yes to me he called me he claimed me as his own and I'm just blessed I'm blessed because I was able to recognize that call as a small boy and dedicate the biggest portion of my life to him but maybe you're in your elder years you're in your senior years and you have not yet responded to the call of the Lord in your life and you're just overwhelmed with your position in life right now let me tell you there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother there is someone who desires to have fellowship with you and to have you to want to have fellowship with him that we would depend on him that we would not trust in our own strength but that we would say Oh Lord we can't do it without you I pray that the church around the world would have once again recognized as an entity as a body we can't do this without the Lord how vain it is for us to even try how prideful it is for us to assume that we can do church without the one who loves the church without the one who gave himself for the church and yet we we do it it happens so may the Lord just stir us and may we respond to the stirring of the Lord let me thank you again for your time with us and though there are many people who say I never miss an episode and we have people who say when I when I turn it on and it seems to be a repeat of the program for the week I often sit and watch the whole thing again because I don't want to miss anything well I can't even tell you what that means to us I don't have words to express to you enough how much we appreciate your dedication and your faithfulness to us and I just pray that we can continue to be a help to you on your journey for the Lord so part three of demonic doorways that's what we're going to talk about today when we left you the last time I don't usually say this but I had on a bright red shirt so maybe you will remember that as part two because I mentioned that because we had an interview that played the week after that and so if you have forgotten the order again go to youtube and you can you can check that out but when we were together the last time we were talking about the three phases of falling short of the glory of God the Bible tells us that really this is the definition of sin for all have sinned for all have come short of the glory of God but there seems to be what the scripture defines as progression in the area of falling just how far away from God and from his glory are we falling at the present moment and and what are the influences what are the things around us that we yield to can we recognize that there are even demon spirits that are assigned to push us farther and farther away from the glory of God if we can recognize some of these things then we can come and submit them we can we can plunge them beneath the redemptive blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and we can be set free from these influences I believe that you and I have the power through the truth through what God has already done for us and by accepting that and fellowshipping that with faith I believe we can shut down the devil's voice in our life you know I might not be able to shut him down in your head but I believe I can have power according to the Word of God I can have power to shut down the devil's voice in my own head and his temptation you know he can glamorize dirt he can take the most common thing and make it so glamorous and desirable and and boy you bite the Apple you you fall for the enemy slick trick and the next thing you know you you recognize I am so far away from who I really am I have fallen so far away from who God created me to be but in that moment we must we must recognize that there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother in that moment we must recognize that God is for you not against you and that he desires for you to win for you to make it I recently was looking over some notes that I used of preaching the funeral of a great general of God who passed away just a few years ago now and on my computer I was trying to put things in folders and organize my life a little better and I found those notes and and I clicked on them and I read over them and it just came to my mind in that moment one portion of what I read and and and it was so true about my friend it was so true about this general of God I made this statement he was the kind of man who wanted people to make it he wanted people to make it he was I think that people would have called him a tough sort of man a leader and he had a tendency to see it his way you know many many times and and convinced others you know to see it his way and to move forward and and yet when someone would slip when someone would fall and people would maybe be roasting that person you know maybe in a conversation oh look what he did look what she did this brother this friend of mine would always step in and and and and bring the conversation back to the to the truth to the reality that we all fall we all make big mistakes and sometimes wrong choices and yet the Lord is gracious he has such tender mercies toward us and he wants us to make it in other words he's not trying to get you to miss heaven he he wants you to cooperate with him and if you will cooperate with him his desire is to give you what you need to overcome what more can he do he shed his precious blood to set us free from the power of sin and from the power of death he prepared a place for us that that one of these days when this life is over real life begins this is it's a good life but it's not the real life there is a real life and that is with him in eternity and he wants us to be successful and so he provides everything that we need just like my my precious brother my precious friend and you know he was the sort of guy who would call and and reach out to people who everybody else was beaten down and and he'd say just to remember you know that you can make it by the grace of God you call on the Lord you get up and you keep going on and he would try to find a way to to bring that person back in to the fellowship draw them back in instead of seeing them out and this is the Ministry of Jesus Christ this is what he desires for you and I so I don't know who I'm talking to right now but maybe you're sort of in a disfellowshipped place right now you you have maybe failed you have somehow lost your way and you're paying the price for it and you may be hard on yourself and and listen you need to make it right if you have sinned against God you need to make that right I'm not here to to give you an excuse but what I am here to tell you once again and I'm gonna tell it every chance I can failure isn't final with Jesus Christ all praise the Lord he allows you turns and he gives us opportunities to get out from under the hold of sin of transgression and of iniquity psalm 32 and 5 is through the scripture we were reading the last time we were together and it mentions all three seeing transgression and iniquity in the same verse and this is the psalmist we assume it was David and he says I acknowledged my sin to you and I did not cover my iniquity I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the iniquity of my sin I just love this transparent moment in the psalmist's life he said Lord I just want to remind you that I didn't dig a hole and try to bury my shortcoming my sin my transgression my iniquity I came before you and laid it open I laid it bare before you because I knew you were the only answer you were the only solution and you heard me and you forgave the iniquity of my sin and I want you to know if you cry out to the Lord even in this moment he will hear you and if you come through the blood of Jesus your sin your transgression your iniquity will be forgiven I'm absolutely confident in that we talked about the fact that sin that that even the Greek concept from the New Testament of the word sin is from archery to miss the mark to draw back the bow to release the arrow with aim you know trying to reach the target but somehow the arrow veers and it doesn't make the bullseye and God says this is sin this is unbelief and and and there's a remedy for that you can do something about it and then we looked at the word iniquity and in the Hebrew the word iniquity is a bending or a twisting or a distortion or perversion of what God has asked of us and so this is why when we were talking about the fact that the iniquity of the father's is visited on the sons it was because iniquity is a choice and so what happens is if the generation before us continues to make that choice right in the face of God to do what is ungodly and what is what is unrighteous and against the instruction of the Lord then then the influence of that sin and the demons even that were assigned to help keep that as a stronghold in our fathers lives for fathers lives they may come after the next generation the influence is already there the predisposition is already there the bending is already there and then I believe that those demonic spirits will do everything they can to try to make the reality of the past generation our present reality and that's where we have to understand there's deliverance for that you just have to continue to say no because when we know what to do when we know what is right we shoot the arrow and it doesn't quite make the target and and we say lord have mercy help me forgive me that's one thing but when we recognize if I keep doing it this way I'm gonna miss the target every time but I like it and so I'm gonna keep doing it well that's what the Bible calls transgression it's a willful act of disobedience against the Lord and then the next thing you know as you continue to make that wrong choice disregarding not even caring that you're sinning against God's Word then it becomes iniquity then it gets deeper than the surface of the skin it gets down in us and it begins to make us to remake us to remote us into something that God has not intended for us to be and those are the kinds of things that we need to understand just because our our forefathers had a problem does it mean that we necessarily have to have that problem but so often we have even mentioned in the last time we were together that science is now confirming that that these tendencies become a part of the DNA and that DNA is passed down to the next generation and so that's when we have to race up and say wait a minute I know God didn't intend for that thing to continue even though the scripture said it can visit the 3rd and the 4th generation we read in the Book of Ezekiel this thing needs to come to an end we need to bring this thing to an end these generational cycles etc so to understand the difference between just sin missing the mark and an iniquity now remember transgression is in between transgression is when we choose to miss the mark to go against what God's Word has said we choose it even though we know that we're going to displease the Lord and we've all we've all done that we've all committed willful sin willful acts of unbelief by the decisions and choices and behaviors of our life when we look at the the full expression of what the word iniquity means in the Bible it's big because it it talks about not only what is carried out but it also talks about what what is lingering beneath the surface what is the motivation what is the driving force what is the inspiration for you to continue to make those choices of transgression and what is the attitude behind it and and what we often find the scripture was clear when one generation makes a decision we will not serve the Lord the next generation is going to be affected by that decision and we have to recognize it that's what we're doing together here and we have to draw the bloodline and we have to say as we have been teaching for three weeks three different lessons already we have to say enough is enough I have been bought with a price thanks be to God because iniquity works like an attitude that comes down for instance the strong opinions of one generation the racism of one generation the political influence of one generation so often comes down and visits the next generation and because of that it's something that kind of lingers beneath the surface and we don't always realize that instead of choosing God's Word we're choosing something that has come down that has passed on to us from the influence from the attitude of another generation and unrighteousness can work that way in racism and and lawlessness all of these things that word iniquity can also mean an injustice which means by making choices to yield to that influence that takes us totally out of the path that God has chosen for you and I to walk I believe many of you believe as I do God has a path for us and we've got to stay in that path no matter what happens because it's only on that path where we're going to experience the blessing and the favour of the Lord and I want you to know you don't want to live without the favor of the Lord you don't want to live without the blessing of the Lord on your life I can almost guarantee that you're not going to want to experience what life is like when we choose to disregard and say hey doesn't matter whether I get the favor of God or the blessing of God on my life I tell you if you've got a business if you're in a career if you've got a family you need the blessing of the Lord and the favor of the Lord in your life so because iniquity can operate like an attitude in our life it's not just covered over by the blood we know we just cover that over and we never have to deal with that again sometimes that thing is so deep beneath the surface that it has to be dealt with not only by pleading the blood of Jesus Christ and applying the blood of Jesus Christ but so recognizing where that route came from that we replace that wrong attitude we replace that that tendency to continue to make the wrong choice and we do that by consciously choosing the way of the Lord by consciously choosing over and over again I'm going to obey God here was David praying he had a heavy heart but he had the right spirit he said Lord I'm just laying it all out there for you and you know in case you we mentioned last time we were together it can get a little technical when you're trying to talk about the different definitions of sin and iniquity and transgression but what if I just summarized it one more time I've said this several times what if we just summarize it by saying it doesn't matter there is a remedy there is a deliverance and I want to share that with you for just a moment here it's such a powerful of powerful truth I say a fifty three verse one who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him this is Isaiah's prophecy concerning the suffering son the suffering Savior it's so very very powerful he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not and this was certainly the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ surely he had borne our griefs verse 4 and carried our sorrows now listen any grief that you have in your life maybe some of you are still dealing with the loss of a loved one the loss of a family member the loss of a marriage maybe the loss of a job or the home the flat where you lived that you enjoyed so much I don't know what your losses and your griefs have been but I say a prophesied that there was coming a savior there was coming a son who would bear our griefs and carried our sorrows and I want you to know I've met him I've met this suffering son I've met this one who was to come who came and who lives in my heart he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten of God and afflicted really Isaiah is saying it will be so easy to disregard him it will be so easy to ignore him you're going to have to make a choice to acknowledge him in your life because even though he has done so very much for all of us we have to believe that we have to receive it and we have to obey what the Scriptures have asked of us here's verse five one of my favorite verses in the entire Old Testament but he was wounded for our transgressions these transgressions this is our willful choices to sin to disregard the truth of God's instruction and all of us have made those transgressions we have made those choices we have lived in that place of just not caring whether it is right or wrong just doing whatever feels good to our flesh but he was wounded for our transgressions which ones can you tell me which ones of our transgressions he was wounded for I'll tell you every one of them every one of them the lie to the murder you hear me I believe that's what the word says every one of our transgressions he was wounded for them and he was bruised for our iniquities those things that lie beneath the surface you know a bruise in the natural is when an injury has taken place sometimes you don't even know what you did but you just look the next day I mean it really happens and you don't have to be old for it to happen either you you bump yourself you're working in the yard or working on the car or whatever you're doing and you don't even recognize that you've done it at the moment and the next day you look and there is a bruise sometimes it can be so angry it's indicating that there has been an injury and and it was it was it was superficial in the sense that that it wasn't a it wasn't a cut but tissue has been damaged beneath the surface and the blood has rushed to that part of the body in that area I love the fact that here the words are broken down for us the different meanings of the words come out when we look at the Hebrew and Jesus took care of all of it our willful sin our transgressions he was wounded for them our iniquities those things that have this have been visited upon us in generational cycles they've laid deep beneath the surface we may have either chosen to agree with them or not agree with them if we agree with them they become our transgressions and if we continue in transgression it becomes iniquity and that is even more deeply rooted in our lives it's harder to get out of that but listen at what it says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed he was wounded he was bruised he was striped everything that we need all of our sin all of our transgression all of our iniquity every bit of it he paid a price and it would do us very very well to accept that beautiful price that he paid at Calvary's cross on our behalf can you say Amen it's so true it's so true we we find out these let me just give you another verse of scripture here in Ezekiel and this is talking a little bit about that old enemy of our soul the one who really is fighting against God and he hates everything that God loves and so guess what that's you that's me the enemy is not against you because of you he's a you because of who loves you the God of all eternity loves you and the Bible describes Lucifer the created being cherub of the Lord in ezekiel 28:14 you were perfect in all your ways from the day you were created till iniquity was found in you by the abundance of your trading I think the King James says traffics you became filled with violence within and you sin see that underlyings something underneath the surface your heart was lifted up because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor you defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities by the iniquity of your trading see Satan this created being of God was perfect until iniquity was found in him and this is one of the ways why I tell you he wants to to trap every one of us in that cycle of sin transgression and iniquity you know I found this verse of scripture to be helpful through the years in Hebrew Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 he talks about the sins that so easily beset us and that we should lay them aside and and I have looked at that on the surface you know we do that sometime we just read it and we think we know what it means I want to read it to you and tell you it's a little bit deeper than what I thought it was Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I was going to stop there but you better get in that second verse because this is where the power comes from looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross I don't know about you but when I read about the crucifixion I'm not seeing a lot of joy I'm not seeing a lot of reason to be joyful but if I would have continued to read and I say a53 a few verses down there's a verse that talks about him seeing his seed he saw those who would follow him even while he was on the cross he had that group of people on his mind those who would serve Him and love him and dedicate their hearts and lives to him that was the joy that was the joy there was no joy in the crown of thorns there was no joy but with the spear and his side or the whip and the stripes on his back there was no joy in the nail prints in his hands and feet there was no joy in the vinegar and in the gall and in the plucking of the beard and the smiting of our Lord with a reed none of these things brought joy then why is it that the Apostle said looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross the joy was you and I the joy were those who would believe him who would serve Him who would follow him even those same ones that the Lord had on his mind before not just at Calvary but before the foundation of the world I want you to say right now I am the lord's joy I am the one who has brought the Lord joy that's how much he loves me now I have brought him shame and I have brought him disappointment and I have brought him hurt I'm sure of that along the way but he saw not only my beginning but he sees my end and he sees the in-between and he knows about us that we're going to make that final surrender to him I I didn't know that I was going to do this but let's go back to Isaiah 53 where we were reading he was wounded for our transgressions and let's go down to verse 10 it says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him you know this this was really a great reality when we look at this there is a great reality here we know that the high priest the religious leaders among the Jews of that day played a role in our Lord's crucifixion and death we know that that the Roman leaders of that day played a role but the Bible tells us it was the spirit of the Father it was the Eternal Spirit of God who chose the path of suffering for Jesus Christ the Living Word of God made flesh there was a divine plan bigger than our Messiah I it was in the heart in the very thoughts of the Father that he would be bruised that he would suffer in this manner and when you understand who Jesus is not just who he was but who he is he is the Living Word of God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word not was like God was God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory so when you understand who Jesus is and who he was in his death then you understand this was a divine plan and Jesus was in on it it didn't make it all easy but it was for you that he went all the way yet it pleased the Lord verse 10 to bruise him he had put him in grief or to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed there it is looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross it goes on to saying in hebrews 12:2 i got two places going at one time he endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god and when we go back over to the finish verse 10 he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand oh my can't you want me to read the rest he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities all of them all of them all of them generational iniquities and cycles all of them the iniquity in my own life that has been produced by my decisions to yield to the bending the bending remember we talked about the bending and the twisting that general that generational iniquity can bring into our life the times that I chose to yield and to transgress the law of God every bit of it to justify many for he shall bear their iniquities he did for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross what was he doing he was bearing our iniquities therefore while I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors think about it he who knew no sin he who was altogether lovely the Word made flesh the Eternal Spirit of God now living inside of an earthly body yet he became sin yet he bore our iniquity and our transgression and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors my we got it all he took it all all of ours missing the mark all of our transgressions when we choose even knowing that we're going to to do what is not pleasing to him and all of our iniquities he bore them all he took it all and he did it for the joy that was set before him and that joy was having a people in the end time that would come into union come into relationship with him and be completely yielded that he might occupy our lives that we might live the Christ life the god-given life that we might be the reflectors I want to be a reflector I fall short many times but I want to be a reflector of the organic life of Jesus Christ I'm telling you every one of our lives when we look at the joys and the highs and the lows there's no life possible on planet earth that can compare with living the god life the life that we have he has chosen for us to live our life becomes hid in Christ and his life steps forward to take the forefront and therefore no matter what purse no matter what kind of cycle no matter what kind of addiction tries to take a hold of your life you must continue to call upon the name of the Lord for there is the promise of Sal vation just by calling on his name now this hebrews 12:1 i talked about understanding that by setting sin and sometimes through the years i would just sort of liken that to the little foxes that spoiled the vine you know he said let us therefore lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and i'm just thinking that it's like you know taking up extra weight in your life little little things that you need to get straightened out i remember one time i was standing in the valley of elah in Giroux in israel with my family and we were going to go up and climb climb a little hill there and look out over the valley of elah and we were going to rehearse the story of how god moved so mightily in the life of little david standing against this Philistine giant this old goliath and who was boasting himself against the armies of the Lord and mocking God and and while we were on our way up we paused at the dried brook of Elon we started picking up little smooth stones and and I had on cargo pants and I put them all in my pockets just ever every kid had a stone four or five five stones most of them I my wife had five and I had and I'm just filling up my and then we walk we walk up the hill I get to the top and I'm thinking why in the world did I not empty my pockets to climb the hill here I have climbed the hill and it was you know a little bit more than a molehill and I've done it with all this extra weight I could have lightened my load a little bit and so when I think of that scripture I think of picking up some extra cargo that you didn't have to carry but when I look at that word in the Greek it really sort of shook me because that word beset the the sin that does so easily beset us it comes from a Greek word that means ensnaring obstructing constricting now we think about the bowl that which ambushes or in circles and I I when I really saw that by setting means more than just a little what some people have called the no harm sin or the little foxes that spoil the vine and yet the word doesn't mean that at all it means the very thing that takes you by ambush the thing that wants to encircle you and constrict you and obstruct you and ensnare you and boy when I saw that I said lord I want to search my life not only for the weight that I'm carrying up the hill that I don't have to carry I might as well lay aside the weight so that I can run but I also want you to show me those sins those attitudes those places of doubt that lie in wait that lie in wait to ambush me when you start examining that you can usually put your finger on some things that the enemy has used against you in the past and when I begin to recognize those things I called out to the Lord and I will again I'll call out to him again because I want to have all my pockets emptied so I can run to the top of the hill in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I don't want to to step into the trap I don't want to be constricted I don't want to be ensnared or ambushed and one that when it says in circles you know that reminds me of the of the movies I saw us a little boy where they tie up tie up the guy wrap him around in the rope from his head to his toes and you know the enemy will operate like that in our lives he will wrap us and wrap us and wrap us until he controls us but I'm so thankful to God he bore it he paid the price you go tell somebody before the day is over tell somebody Jesus bore it all all to him Oh sin had left a crimson stain he washed it why there's snow you know that may sound like to maybe a modern generation that may sound like some old dusty you know relic of the church let me tell you something it's older than the church it's the truth that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world there is freedom for you and I thanks be to God sin this kind of this kind of a setting sin or the iniquity that we were talking about it's like having a chain around your ankle which which constantly hinders you it trips you up and causes you to slip to air to keep missing the mark but it doesn't stop there iniquity will continue to defile your character and it'll give you a crooked arrow to start with so here you are trying to shoot the arrow and you realize I'm missing the mark and missing the mark and missing the mark and I don't even know why it's because these iniquities if they're not dealt with and we don't come before the Lord in in repentance and put the blood on them and then replace them with truth you know it's not just rubbing the blood over them and continuing in them we've got to replace them with the victory of the resurrection he didn't just die for our sins but Christ was risen he overcame death hell and the grave I'm gonna fellowship with that I'm not just gonna fellowship with the blood that he that he was wounded for my transgression Bruce from our iniquities but I'm also gonna fellowship with the fact that he overcame death itself and he came forth with the keys of death hell and the grave and because he overcame I can overcome also blessed be the name of the Lord we've got the victory that we need and I want to remind you of that again and again and again because that's the truth that and storms that's the truth that gives us the strength we need to get through the daily battle of life once again I want to thank every one of you who have shared your life your heart and your needs with us and I want us to close this program with a word of Prayer for you who are watching and for those of you who set your needs in that God will move for you in such a way that you will know
