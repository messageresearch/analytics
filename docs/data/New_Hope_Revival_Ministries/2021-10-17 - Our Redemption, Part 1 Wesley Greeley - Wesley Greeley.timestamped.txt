[45:56] hallelujah
[45:57] [Applause]
[45:59] [Music]
[46:01] you may have your seats
[46:03] today
[46:07] once upon a time
[46:11] there was a widow lady that called me
[46:13] late at night
[46:17] and there was a disturbing
[46:19] beeping sound that was happening in her
[46:22] home and she had a neighbor and they
[46:24] could not figure out how to get rid of
[46:26] it
[46:29] and we had that same beeping sound here
[46:32] today
[46:33] what did you all do with that thing
[46:38] there's another one back here making the
[46:40] same sound as i walked out it's beeping
[46:45] anyhow i said disconnect it and throw it
[46:47] out in the yard apparently these things
[46:50] go bad
[46:51] and it's time that after
[46:54] 16 or 17 years here in the church they
[46:57] need to be replaced and we'll do that
[46:59] right away so that we have safety here
[47:02] in the building but we don't need
[47:04] distractions this morning there's enough
[47:06] that the enemy uses as distractions to
[47:10] keep us from hearing the word of the
[47:11] lord and uh i'm just grateful that
[47:16] god made a way for us to bring ourselves
[47:19] back into line to hear
[47:22] and that is we have to consciously bring
[47:25] our minds and say lord i'm going to
[47:27] focus on you i'm going to worship you
[47:30] and just begin to whisper his name
[47:33] jesus jesus there's something about that
[47:36] name

[52:44] the lord
[52:47] i'm asking you o god that
[52:51] you would hide
[52:52] this vessel
[52:54] and i pray lord that you will speak
[52:57] through lips of clay
[53:00] god i'm asking you to even bypass my
[53:03] mind and you speak
[53:05] you speak lord
[53:08] let there be years to hear what the
[53:10] spirit would say to the church today
[53:14] god may we be receptive
[53:17] to hear your voice
[53:22] thank you lord that you are
[53:25] working
[53:26] moving

[53:46] that we pray
[53:48] amen
[53:50] thank you lord thank you lord
[53:53] would you give our musicians a a
[53:58] hand of
[53:59] applause today
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:12] you may look at them and say they filled
[54:15] in today but i want you to know that
[54:17] their job was harder
[54:20] than those that do it on a regular basis
[54:24] because they're not used to it
[54:26] and i appreciate every one of them for
[54:29] stepping up and helping us
[54:31] and even at a request of the preacher
[54:33] learning a new song to bring to the
[54:35] people i appreciate it so much
[54:39] if you have your bibles today will you
[54:41] turn with me to first corinthians
[54:43] chapter one
[54:48] first corinthians chapter one verse 18.
[55:00] this subject has been on my heart and
[55:02] mind for some weeks now i can't get away
[55:04] from it
[55:06] for the preaching of the cross
[55:09] is to them that perish
[55:12] foolishness
[55:14] but unto us which are saved
[55:18] it is the power
[55:20] of god
[55:22] let me read it once again
[55:25] for the preaching of the cross
[55:28] is to them that perish
[55:30] foolishness
[55:32] but unto us which are saved
[55:34] it is the power of god
[55:38] may the lord add a blessing to the
[55:39] reading of his word you may have your
[55:41] seats
[55:50] some of the revised versions
[55:54] read but unto us which are being saved
[55:58] it is the power of
[56:00] god i'm gonna stick with the king james
[56:04] today because i believe that it is a
[56:07] finished work
[56:09] i am walking it out
[56:11] but as far as he's concerned and i as
[56:15] far as i'm concerned today
[56:17] i'm saved
[56:20] i can no more be lost than god can be
[56:23] lost because i was a part of him from
[56:28] the beginning and he saw me from the
[56:32] beginning and he said that one's mine
[56:36] and you may say
[56:38] well
[56:38] are you preaching a message of
[56:41] predestination
[56:43] yes in fact i am preaching a message of
[56:47] predestination because i serve a god who
[56:51] is so big and he knows so much that he
[56:55] looked from the beginning all the way to
[56:58] the end of time and he saw every single
[57:01] person and he saw what person would say
[57:04] yes
[57:05] and he saw the person that would say no
[57:08] and by that he could give them a destiny
[57:11] that was already prefixed
[57:14] as i
[57:16] ponder the thought
[57:18] of predestination and i ponder the
[57:21] thought of the millions and billions and
[57:25] trillions of people through the ages of
[57:28] eternity and i think about how god would
[57:32] take and put individuals in a certain
[57:35] age and he would he would make them to
[57:38] be able to mesh with the the rest of the
[57:42] people that were in that age and make it
[57:46] all work
[57:47] and then people want to say we started
[57:50] from an amoeba
[57:57] sometimes our minds ponder this whole
[57:59] thing and think what a fairy tale that
[58:02] we live in but i'm telling you it is not
[58:05] a fairy tale it is a meticulous
[58:08] god who was able to put it all together
[58:12] in such precision and such meticulous
[58:16] order that everything would work just
[58:19] right
[58:21] you say well this one fell and that one
[58:24] fell and that one walked away after
[58:26] serving the lord for many years it's
[58:29] still god's meticulous plan
[58:33] any that belong to him he will not lose
[58:36] them
[58:38] i don't care whether they served the
[58:40] lord for 20 years and walked away for 20
[58:43] and on their deathbed they recognize
[58:46] what a foolish mistake that they made
[58:49] god will not lose one that belongs to
[58:52] him god is not sitting around wondering
[58:56] will this one ever get right with me no
[58:59] he already knows and he knows who's
[59:02] going to be in the right position at the
[59:04] right time to speak the right word of
[59:06] encouragement or the right word of
[59:08] correction or the right word of
[59:10] chastisement god knows exactly what is
[59:14] needed to get a person in the right
[59:17] place at the right time to get the right
[59:19] word
[59:21] but the preaching of the cross
[59:24] is through the years there have been
[59:26] those that are perishing
[59:31] i am not here to preach a universalist
[59:34] gospel to you or to anybody else i do
[59:38] not believe that the devil is going to
[59:40] be saved and i do believe that there is
[59:44] a hell
[59:45] there is a lake of fire and it was
[59:48] prepared for the devil and his angels
[59:51] and there are human beings who are going
[59:54] to go to that place these are the same
[59:58] ones who think the preaching of the
[1:00:00] cross is foolishness
[1:00:04] they don't understand it they don't have
[1:00:06] a mind to comprehend it and you may say
[1:00:10] well why didn't god he's the
[1:00:12] all-powerful god why didn't god make
[1:00:16] them and help them to understand it god
[1:00:19] already
[1:00:20] saw that even if they could understand
[1:00:23] it they would still reject it
[1:00:27] because he's all powerful and he's all
[1:00:30] seen and he knows exactly your yes and
[1:00:34] your no
[1:00:35] now i or you as a believer have we ever
[1:00:38] said no to the lord of course we have
[1:00:42] but god saw that eternal yes that one
[1:00:45] that counted and he knew that even
[1:00:48] though at one time or another we may say
[1:00:51] no to a certain thing he came back
[1:00:54] around and he offered it once again
[1:00:56] because he knew that you were rooted and
[1:00:59] grounded in him and that you would grow
[1:01:02] up into the seeds of righteousness that
[1:01:05] he had already pre-allowed to be
[1:01:09] so the preaching of the cross
[1:01:12] is to them
[1:01:13] that perish
[1:01:15] foolishness
[1:01:17] but unto us
[1:01:20] which are saved
[1:01:22] it is the power
[1:01:25] of god
[1:01:27] turn with me if you will
[1:01:29] to hebrews chapter 12.
[1:01:34] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore
[1:01:37] seen we also
[1:01:39] this is after the great faith chapter
[1:01:41] hebrews 11
[1:01:43] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:01:45] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:01:49] let us lay aside every weight
[1:01:53] and the sin
[1:01:55] which doth so easily
[1:01:58] beset us
[1:02:03] why does it so easily
[1:02:05] beset us
[1:02:08] now i want you
[1:02:10] as you look at this i want you
[1:02:13] because we say well i've overcome this
[1:02:15] i've overcome that i've overcome
[1:02:18] this sin and that sin and the other sin
[1:02:20] and all of those things that were a list
[1:02:22] once upon a time but i want us to put a
[1:02:25] different word in there for rather than
[1:02:27] sin i want us to put in the word
[1:02:29] unbelief
[1:02:31] and the unbelief with which doth so
[1:02:34] easily beset us
[1:02:38] when we are in a position
[1:02:40] where the enemy catches us at a weak
[1:02:42] moment
[1:02:43] the unbelief so easily besets us all
[1:02:48] right so
[1:02:49] we are compassed with a great cloud of
[1:02:51] witness let us lay aside every weight
[1:02:54] and the unbelief for the sin which does
[1:02:56] so easily beset us and let us run with
[1:03:00] patience the race that is set before us
[1:03:05] looking unto jesus
[1:03:08] the author and finisher
[1:03:11] of our faith
[1:03:13] we know that he started it
[1:03:15] he was the author of it and he is the
[1:03:17] one who is going to finish it up
[1:03:21] who for the joy
[1:03:23] that was set before him
[1:03:26] endured the cross
[1:03:28] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:03:31] the right hand of the throne of god
[1:03:34] now we know that uh the in reading the
[1:03:37] scripture that there are people who have
[1:03:40] gone on before us
[1:03:43] the great cloud of witnesses we call
[1:03:45] them
[1:03:46] those who have already run their race
[1:03:49] with patience
[1:03:51] and they were laid down to sleep
[1:03:54] those that are in christ they do not die
[1:03:58] that uh they are they are as much alive
[1:04:01] or more alive today than they've ever
[1:04:04] been they are just resting waiting for
[1:04:07] the rest of us to catch up to them
[1:04:11] so we continue to run our race and it is
[1:04:15] our responsibility to lay aside all of
[1:04:17] the weights and all of the unbelief that
[1:04:20] so easily besets us we have to run this
[1:04:24] race with patience
[1:04:27] what is this
[1:04:28] what do they say rome wasn't built in a
[1:04:30] day
[1:04:31] and your walk with the lord is not going
[1:04:34] to be finished in one day
[1:04:36] it's going to take your whole span of
[1:04:38] your lifetime and and and maybe you
[1:04:41] won't be as close to the lord as you
[1:04:44] want to be when you're at your last day
[1:04:47] on this earth but run your race with
[1:04:49] patience
[1:04:51] and you lay aside all of the unbelief
[1:04:53] all of the weights that are so easily uh
[1:04:57] causing you to be beset and you look to
[1:05:00] jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:05:02] faith now
[1:05:04] because that he is the author and the
[1:05:06] finisher of our faith
[1:05:09] he is the one
[1:05:11] that decided that
[1:05:15] you could not redeem yourself
[1:05:19] there was no way for you to redeem
[1:05:21] yourself
[1:05:24] but you were part of him
[1:05:27] and he wanted you back
[1:05:29] he did not want you to remain in your
[1:05:32] fallen condition he did not want to be
[1:05:34] separated from you
[1:05:37] so the scripture says who for the joy
[1:05:40] that was set before him endured the
[1:05:43] cross what is that joy that joy is you
[1:05:47] and me
[1:05:48] i was the joy that was set before him
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:55] this is
[1:05:56] way
[1:05:56] too elementary
[1:05:58] but i i just had this glimpse
[1:06:01] of a child that is learning to walk
[1:06:05] and something is put in front of him to
[1:06:07] entice him to make steps
[1:06:12] i and you
[1:06:14] we were the ones that were put before
[1:06:17] the lord jesus we were the joy that was
[1:06:20] set before him that he was willing
[1:06:24] to endure the cross now i want you to
[1:06:27] recognize here
[1:06:28] that it was not joy for him to be on the
[1:06:31] cross
[1:06:35] it even says that he despised the shame
[1:06:40] naked before the entire world
[1:06:45] he was he
[1:06:46] was he despised that shame and he
[1:06:49] endured the cross he was willing to be
[1:06:54] on that cross he was willing to stay
[1:06:57] under the load
[1:07:00] oh what a load that he carried on behalf
[1:07:04] of me and on behalf of you this load of
[1:07:07] sin and condemnation and guilt and shame
[1:07:11] and all the things that go with it
[1:07:14] through life he
[1:07:16] he endured it he he stayed under that
[1:07:19] heavy load to go to the cross because of
[1:07:22] the joy that was set before him
[1:07:26] despising the shame
[1:07:28] and he went through all of it and he's
[1:07:30] now set down at the
[1:07:33] right hand of the throne of god he is
[1:07:36] now sitting in the place of authority
[1:07:39] all right now i want us to go to
[1:07:41] colossians chapter 2.
[1:07:45] colossians chapter 2 starting with verse
[1:07:47] 6.
[1:07:54] colossians 2
[1:07:56] verse 6 as you have therefore received
[1:07:59] christ jesus the lord
[1:08:02] so walk ye in him
[1:08:05] rooted
[1:08:06] and built up in him
[1:08:09] and established in the faith as you have
[1:08:12] been taught
[1:08:14] abounding therein with thanksgiving
[1:08:17] we so often forget the part of
[1:08:19] thanksgiving we're to be rooted and
[1:08:21] built up in him and established in the
[1:08:23] faith as we have been taught and
[1:08:25] abounding in with thanksgiving
[1:08:28] beware lest any man spoil you through
[1:08:30] philosophy
[1:08:32] and vain deceit how many people through
[1:08:34] the years have you seen that that were
[1:08:38] that they became spoiled through
[1:08:40] philosophy
[1:08:45] they they they accepted a gospel of
[1:08:48] philosophy
[1:08:50] rather than this bloody gospel
[1:08:53] they they took a gospel that uh was was
[1:08:57] uh philosophical in it
[1:09:00] it was really the intellectual mind that
[1:09:03] was coming up with some of the things
[1:09:05] that they were doing but this uh paul is
[1:09:08] warning the uh colossian church to
[1:09:11] beware that you don't get spoiled
[1:09:14] through philosophy and vein deceit i'm
[1:09:17] telling you there are plenty of
[1:09:19] philosophies out there there are plenty
[1:09:22] of of the people who are preaching a
[1:09:24] gospel and it is not a gospel or the
[1:09:28] gospel according to the lord jesus
[1:09:30] christ it is not the gospel that will
[1:09:33] save a man from his sin it's a gospel
[1:09:37] that will make him feel good
[1:09:39] to get through the days of hard times
[1:09:43] but i'm telling you when you are rooted
[1:09:45] and grounded in the lord jesus christ
[1:09:48] you go through trials and tribulations
[1:09:52] you go through some things that are
[1:09:54] going to hurt they're going to bring you
[1:09:56] some pain they're going to cause you to
[1:09:59] wonder why did i start this journey but
[1:10:02] again he that started this work in you
[1:10:06] is able to complete it
[1:10:10] you have to keep coming back to the well
[1:10:15] so don't be
[1:10:16] don't let a man spoil you through
[1:10:19] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[1:10:21] tradition of men
[1:10:24] after the rudiments of the world and not
[1:10:27] after christ now you've got to remember
[1:10:29] that paul preaching here he's dealing
[1:10:32] with all of these jewish believers who
[1:10:35] have been under the under the rulership
[1:10:37] or under the leadership of of the
[1:10:39] pharisees and the sadducees and the
[1:10:42] sanhedrin they've been under this uh
[1:10:45] leadership for so many years and these
[1:10:48] men through the years have taken god's
[1:10:52] word and they've added there too and
[1:10:54] they've they've come up maybe with some
[1:10:56] philosophies they've come up with some
[1:10:59] vain traditions they've come up with so
[1:11:01] many things that
[1:11:04] are really the traditions of men and
[1:11:07] they're after the rudiments of the world
[1:11:09] and not after christ so
[1:11:13] he is warning them to be careful
[1:11:16] so now he says in verse 9 for in him
[1:11:19] who's him we've got to go back to verse
[1:11:21] 6 christ jesus the lord for in him
[1:11:25] dwelleth all of the fullness
[1:11:28] of the godhead
[1:11:30] bodily
[1:11:33] so we have
[1:11:35] for those that may not be familiar
[1:11:37] either here or watching this service the
[1:11:40] eternal spirit of god the creator of all
[1:11:43] things he knew that he could not send
[1:11:46] somebody else in his place therefore he
[1:11:49] chose to come to earth as a human being
[1:11:53] this child born of a virgin mary
[1:11:56] she did not supply the egg a man
[1:12:00] on the earth did not provide the sperm
[1:12:02] this was all created by god and he
[1:12:05] created the child and then he stepped
[1:12:08] into this body john 1 the word became
[1:12:12] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:12:15] for in him christ jesus the lord
[1:12:18] dwelleth all of the fullness of the
[1:12:22] godhead bodily or in bodily form in a
[1:12:25] body
[1:12:28] now if you stop right there that's great
[1:12:31] but go to the next verse
[1:12:33] because now we're bringing us into the
[1:12:36] picture and ye are complete in him
[1:12:41] which is the head of all principality
[1:12:44] and power
[1:12:47] he
[1:12:48] christ jesus the lord
[1:12:50] is the head of all principality and
[1:12:53] power now we look at this word
[1:12:56] principality and power and we
[1:12:58] can
[1:12:59] look in the the greek language and try
[1:13:02] to figure out what this mean in its uh
[1:13:05] basic meaning the principality and power
[1:13:08] as leader but then you get the head he
[1:13:11] is the chief
[1:13:12] of chiefs
[1:13:15] he is the supreme one christ jesus the
[1:13:18] lord is the supreme one and i am
[1:13:22] complete in him and he is the head over
[1:13:25] principality and power
[1:13:28] that means because i am complete in him
[1:13:32] i also have been given an authority
[1:13:37] over the principality and power because
[1:13:41] i have been made partaker joint heir
[1:13:45] with christ jesus and that means i'm
[1:13:48] joining him in being chief over
[1:13:50] principality and power
[1:13:53] unless you make unless you think i'm
[1:13:55] trying to make me out of something this
[1:13:58] human flesh is rotten to the core
[1:14:01] it is no good it is worthless but i have
[1:14:04] chosen by the grace of god the seed that
[1:14:07] was in me i have received into me christ
[1:14:11] jesus the lord the very spirit of the
[1:14:14] living god the very spirit of the
[1:14:16] godhead bodily is now dwelling in this
[1:14:19] body
[1:14:22] and he's given me
[1:14:24] power over the principalities and powers
[1:14:29] because the chief lives in me
[1:14:35] in whom verse 11
[1:14:37] in whom also you are circumcised with
[1:14:40] the circumcision made without hands in
[1:14:42] putting off the body of the sins of the
[1:14:45] flesh by the circumcision of christ
[1:14:49] buried with him in baptism
[1:15:00] when jesus
[1:15:02] died on the cross
[1:15:04] he was buried
[1:15:09] and we just read that
[1:15:12] we are complete in him
[1:15:15] because we were in him we were with him
[1:15:18] we are identified with him so when we go
[1:15:21] down in baptism in the name of the lord
[1:15:24] jesus christ and we're buried in water
[1:15:28] in baptism this is symbolizing that we
[1:15:32] are we are recognizing by faith that we
[1:15:36] have been buried with him
[1:15:39] we are
[1:15:40] we are uh
[1:15:42] carrying out a symbolism of something
[1:15:46] that happened
[1:15:48] while we were identified in him and so
[1:15:51] then we also are risen with him through
[1:15:55] faith of the operation of god
[1:16:02] sometimes
[1:16:04] this seems such a fantastic
[1:16:06] thought that we can't wrap our minds
[1:16:08] around that we were in him when he died
[1:16:12] that day at calvary and we went with him
[1:16:16] through this process of identification
[1:16:18] and maybe i don't have all the right
[1:16:20] vocabulary to describe it just right but
[1:16:23] i know that i was identified in him as
[1:16:26] he was there
[1:16:28] in the tomb and as he descended into the
[1:16:30] lower parts of the earth and he took
[1:16:32] away the keys of death hell and the
[1:16:34] grave from satan as he went and he spoke
[1:16:38] to those in paradise i was identified in
[1:16:41] him and when i became when i came to the
[1:16:44] earth as a human being
[1:16:46] god wanted me to have identification
[1:16:50] with his death burial and resurrection
[1:16:53] and so he made a way through the
[1:16:56] operation of god and i put faith in the
[1:17:00] operation of god and so i was buried
[1:17:03] with him in baptism when i was baptized
[1:17:07] in the name of the lord jesus christ i
[1:17:09] was
[1:17:10] identifying with his death
[1:17:12] all of the sins that he bore of mine to
[1:17:16] calvary i now as a human being recognize
[1:17:20] that he bore those sins to calvary and
[1:17:23] he died on my hand behalf so when he was
[1:17:26] buried in baptism i am now by faith
[1:17:30] recognizing the operation of god
[1:17:33] and as i come back up out of that water
[1:17:36] i am rising up with him i am again
[1:17:40] identifying that he did not stay in the
[1:17:43] grave but he arose and he came up out of
[1:17:46] the grave triumphing over death hell in
[1:17:49] the grave so when i come up out of the
[1:17:51] water i am by faith recognizing the
[1:17:55] operation of god this is the way that
[1:17:58] god operates by faith
[1:18:01] that is the only way that you can ever
[1:18:04] get to god that is by faith
[1:18:10] it is not likely that you are going to
[1:18:13] see the living god in a bodily form like
[1:18:16] you see me
[1:18:18] perhaps you will i know the scripture
[1:18:20] says no man has seen god at any time why
[1:18:24] is that because god is a spirit
[1:18:28] and then god's spirit he chose to create
[1:18:33] a body in the lord jesus christ and that
[1:18:37] spirit came and dwelt in jesus on a body
[1:18:41] of flesh on the earth and as brother
[1:18:43] shelley was preaching to us in all
[1:18:46] manners was tempted as we are
[1:18:50] yet without sin so through this
[1:18:53] operation of god by faith i'm buried
[1:18:57] with him identifying in his burial i
[1:19:01] come up out of the water and i'm risen
[1:19:04] through faith of the operation of god
[1:19:07] who hath raised him from the dead now
[1:19:11] remember
[1:19:12] that this
[1:19:14] is
[1:19:15] a
[1:19:17] let me get it right i believe brother
[1:19:19] branham called coming up out of the
[1:19:21] water this rising is a type
[1:19:24] the antitype is when we come up in the
[1:19:28] resurrection at the last day
[1:19:31] when we rise to meet him in the air this
[1:19:35] is what we have been given but by faith
[1:19:38] we are seeing that jesus christ arose
[1:19:41] from the dead
[1:19:43] i rose with him and now all that sin is
[1:19:47] dead
[1:19:52] you may say
[1:19:55] if
[1:19:56] if sin is dead
[1:19:58] and i'm a believer
[1:20:00] why am i having to deal with these
[1:20:02] things
[1:20:03] on a day in and day out basis
[1:20:06] sin didn't go away
[1:20:10] the attributes of sin and the sinful
[1:20:13] nature
[1:20:15] are still on the earth but the power of
[1:20:20] that stuff
[1:20:22] all of it
[1:20:23] he was in every manner tempted as we yet
[1:20:26] without sin
[1:20:28] and he walked it out
[1:20:30] and now we as believers are walking this
[1:20:33] thing out because we have been given the
[1:20:37] same spirit that jesus was given we have
[1:20:41] been given the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:44] to be able to walk this walk out and we
[1:20:48] do not have to walk under the
[1:20:50] condemnation of sin
[1:20:53] it may come to us but we do not have to
[1:20:57] participate with it we do not have to
[1:21:00] entertain it we can tell it to leave in
[1:21:03] the name of jesus christ
[1:21:06] all right so we are buried with him in
[1:21:08] baptism whereas where in also
[1:21:11] you are risen with him through the faith
[1:21:13] of the operation of god who hath raised
[1:21:16] him from the dead
[1:21:18] and you being dead in your sins and the
[1:21:20] uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:21:23] hath he quickened together with him
[1:21:26] having forgiven you
[1:21:28] all your trespasses now i want you to
[1:21:32] look at the last part of that because he
[1:21:34] has quickened
[1:21:36] he
[1:21:36] has quickened together with him you
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:42] have been quickened together with him
[1:21:45] and all of your trespasses are forgiven
[1:21:51] blotting out
[1:21:53] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:21:55] against us
[1:21:57] which was contrary to us
[1:22:00] and took it out of the way
[1:22:02] nailing it to his cross
[1:22:04] now when paul was speaking this and he's
[1:22:08] talking about the blotting out of the
[1:22:10] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:22:11] against us
[1:22:13] he was talking about he's he's dealing
[1:22:15] with circumcision and uncircumcision
[1:22:18] he's dealing with people of the law and
[1:22:20] he's talking about all of these
[1:22:22] ordinances that were that were written
[1:22:24] and added uh to to
[1:22:27] to try to make fences for the people
[1:22:29] till that they didn't go too far away
[1:22:31] from god
[1:22:32] and and he's talking about these
[1:22:35] handwriting of ordinances that the
[1:22:37] people were living under the guilt of
[1:22:39] these things they're living under all of
[1:22:42] the weight of this law that they can't
[1:22:44] possibly keep
[1:22:46] it's just too big for them
[1:22:50] there was no way that man could keep
[1:22:53] every letter of the law and when he came
[1:22:55] every year to offer a sacrifice whenever
[1:22:58] he came to offer a sacrifice it was
[1:23:01] never enough
[1:23:04] to get rid of the sin
[1:23:06] it was never enough to get rid of the
[1:23:08] sin nature
[1:23:10] and so
[1:23:12] man kept living under the weight of all
[1:23:16] of these ordinances
[1:23:18] every year every year every year he's
[1:23:20] living under the weight of these
[1:23:22] ordinances
[1:23:23] and i just started thinking about the
[1:23:26] handwriting of ordinances that were
[1:23:28] blotted out and i began to think about
[1:23:31] you know we talk about our names being
[1:23:34] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:23:37] and they can't be blotted out we talk
[1:23:39] about a book
[1:23:41] that uh
[1:23:43] he said that he would he made
[1:23:46] remembrance of us he kept a record of
[1:23:49] those that spake of him often he kept a
[1:23:51] record of it and i just started thinking
[1:23:54] about uh you know i figure satan has a
[1:23:56] few books too
[1:24:00] and i figure
[1:24:02] that there have been times in our life
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:06] he had our name written down
[1:24:09] and he saw us fall or fail
[1:24:13] oh
[1:24:15] these guys say they're believers and
[1:24:20] why
[1:24:22] he's a thief
[1:24:24] he just stole banana off the shelf
[1:24:27] i'm gonna write that down
[1:24:31] i'm gonna keep recording track of that
[1:24:34] oh yeah there he goes
[1:24:36] he's
[1:24:38] that guy over there he's he says he's a
[1:24:40] believer
[1:24:41] and he's fornicating with other women
[1:24:43] we'll write that down
[1:24:45] that's a mark against him because i
[1:24:48] already know the scripture that says
[1:24:49] fornicators that they they don't have no
[1:24:52] part with god
[1:24:53] and and what about what about those that
[1:24:56] he hates his neighbor
[1:24:58] uh yeah i'm gonna write it down and see
[1:25:00] satan's keeping track of all this stuff
[1:25:04] keeping track i just wonder what kind of
[1:25:06] book he has
[1:25:08] but as i saw this verse this morning i
[1:25:11] saw that book
[1:25:12] that he had written all about me
[1:25:15] and i expect that he's probably still
[1:25:17] taking notes today
[1:25:19] but no matter what's in that book that
[1:25:22] saint might have i see a nail to the
[1:25:24] cross and all that's in that book that
[1:25:28] he's kept a record of satan's kept a
[1:25:30] record of
[1:25:32] it's all nailed to the cross
[1:25:38] so every time that
[1:25:40] the devil tries to remind me of it
[1:25:43] i say oh no it's already been nailed to
[1:25:46] the cross it's been blotted out see my
[1:25:49] name can't be blotted out of the lamb's
[1:25:52] book of life
[1:25:53] it can't be
[1:25:54] so that means it's got to be blotted out
[1:25:56] of some book brother richard
[1:25:59] some book is going to get a blotting
[1:26:01] somewhere it's going to be wiped out and
[1:26:03] it ain't going to be the book of life so
[1:26:05] that means christ jesus my lord he has
[1:26:09] already taken all of the marks against
[1:26:11] me
[1:26:13] along with all of the law that couldn't
[1:26:15] be kept because no man could ever keep
[1:26:17] it
[1:26:18] and he nailed it to the cross
[1:26:22] he took it out of the way nailing it to
[1:26:24] his cross
[1:26:32] and having spoiled principalities and
[1:26:35] powers
[1:26:36] now again i
[1:26:38] want you to look at the principalities
[1:26:40] and powers because these are the same
[1:26:43] words that i uh
[1:26:45] brought up in verse 10 that he is the
[1:26:48] head of principality and power now in
[1:26:52] verse 15 it says he spoiled
[1:26:54] principalities and powers he made a show
[1:26:57] of them openly triumphing over them in
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:03] so jesus christ christ jesus our lord he
[1:27:07] took everything that was against you and
[1:27:09] against me and he nailed it to the cross
[1:27:13] the problem is that many times we do not
[1:27:18] take advantage of what he nailed to the
[1:27:21] cross
[1:27:23] what he took to the cross see everything
[1:27:26] that is a part of your life that brings
[1:27:29] you down
[1:27:31] everything that discourages you
[1:27:34] everything that causes your health to
[1:27:37] decline everything that causes your
[1:27:40] spiritual state to decline he took it to
[1:27:43] the cross and it was nailed to his cross
[1:27:47] i want us to turn to isaiah chapter 53
[1:27:54] isaiah chapter 53.
[1:28:02] who hath believed our report
[1:28:06] and to whom
[1:28:08] is the arm of the lord
[1:28:10] revealed
[1:28:13] now
[1:28:14] the arm of the lord
[1:28:18] as you would take
[1:28:21] this phrase the arm of the lord
[1:28:24] and you trace it back through the old
[1:28:26] testament scripture
[1:28:28] many times
[1:28:30] when the arm of the lord was
[1:28:33] mentioned
[1:28:35] it was god doing battle through his
[1:28:38] stretched out arm
[1:28:43] who has believed our report
[1:28:46] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:28:50] revealed
[1:28:53] i believe when you recognize that jesus
[1:28:58] christ has died for your sins and that
[1:29:01] you
[1:29:02] desire to be under his lordship that the
[1:29:06] arm of the lord is just beginning to be
[1:29:09] revealed to you
[1:29:11] there are many people who want him to be
[1:29:15] savior
[1:29:17] but they don't want him to be lord of
[1:29:19] their life
[1:29:22] they want him to be savior so they can
[1:29:24] escape hell
[1:29:26] but they don't want him to be the lord
[1:29:29] of their life
[1:29:31] but when you see the arm of the lord
[1:29:34] revealed and you see that he is the
[1:29:37] mighty god of battle and you can see his
[1:29:40] track record through the scripture that
[1:29:43] by his mighty stretched out arm
[1:29:47] he conquered armies
[1:29:54] you know
[1:29:55] you can read back through the old
[1:29:57] testament
[1:29:59] and how that god
[1:30:01] it could almost become comical at times
[1:30:04] how that man really thinks he's
[1:30:06] something but if god took his hand off
[1:30:08] of it
[1:30:10] man would be dead
[1:30:13] but when god is in it and god gives
[1:30:15] instruction to a man and he can tell him
[1:30:18] no you've got too many in your army
[1:30:21] gideon
[1:30:22] you just got too many
[1:30:26] what kind of battle strategy is that
[1:30:29] the more men i've got the more men i can
[1:30:31] whoop
[1:30:34] no
[1:30:35] that wasn't god's battle strategy
[1:30:37] because man is not going to get glory in
[1:30:40] god's battle strategy
[1:30:43] so god can take thousands of men and
[1:30:46] reduce it to just a few hundred men by
[1:30:50] the way that they drink water
[1:30:52] now how comical is that
[1:30:55] just go down by the water and i'm gonna
[1:30:57] watch to see who drinks water a certain
[1:31:00] way and we're just going to dismiss all
[1:31:02] that don't drink water the right way
[1:31:06] what kind of battle strategy is that
[1:31:10] it's god's battle strategy
[1:31:13] what about when david he tells his men
[1:31:16] he says when we get up here and
[1:31:18] god tells him when you hear the rustling
[1:31:20] in the mulberry tree
[1:31:23] that's your signal
[1:31:25] well what kind of signal is that how do
[1:31:27] i have any confidence that you're gonna
[1:31:30] send that signal to me god never goes
[1:31:32] back on his promises when god has a
[1:31:35] battle strategy and he wants to show his
[1:31:37] strong right arm he knows exactly how to
[1:31:40] do it
[1:31:41] so who has believed i report that's the
[1:31:44] first thing you've got to do you've got
[1:31:45] to believe the report of the lord is
[1:31:48] this even something that see friends
[1:31:50] it's all by faith
[1:31:53] it's all by faith
[1:31:56] i can present something to you
[1:31:59] and if you're under a philosophical
[1:32:01] gospel you may say you've got to prove
[1:32:04] it to me in a stronger measure than just
[1:32:06] to tell me it's by faith
[1:32:10] i don't know how to
[1:32:14] that is why you can explain the godhead
[1:32:16] to some people when they get it and some
[1:32:17] they can't
[1:32:18] because it is god who opens up the eyes
[1:32:20] of a believer
[1:32:22] it is god who opens up the eyes of
[1:32:24] understanding that you can be
[1:32:26] enlightened to understand what is the
[1:32:28] hope that lies within you
[1:32:30] all right so who has believed our report
[1:32:33] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:32:35] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:32:37] as a tender plan and as a root out of a
[1:32:39] dry ground he hath no form nor
[1:32:42] comeliness and when we shall see him
[1:32:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:32:47] him he is despised and rejected of man
[1:32:59] would it have been easier to go to the
[1:33:00] cross
[1:33:03] if he'd had people behind him patting
[1:33:05] him on the back saying oh brother this
[1:33:07] is the right thing to do this is what
[1:33:10] you got to do you gotta
[1:33:12] it's the only way that mankind can be
[1:33:14] saved
[1:33:16] but that wasn't
[1:33:18] how that jesus christ walked this earth
[1:33:21] he was despised
[1:33:24] and he was rejected of men
[1:33:26] the disciples even walked away
[1:33:29] they didn't know what to do things got
[1:33:31] out of hand for them they just didn't
[1:33:34] know what in the world was happening it
[1:33:36] was a horrible time in their lives and
[1:33:38] they didn't know how to respond to it
[1:33:41] and so he was despised and rejected of
[1:33:44] man a man of men a man of sorrows and
[1:33:48] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[1:33:51] were our faces from him
[1:33:54] he was despised
[1:33:56] and we esteemed him not
[1:34:00] verse 4 surely
[1:34:02] he hath borne our griefs
[1:34:06] i want us to pause right here
[1:34:10] because
[1:34:12] jesus christ
[1:34:14] went to the cross
[1:34:17] not just for the saving
[1:34:20] of your soul
[1:34:24] jesus christ
[1:34:27] bore our griefs
[1:34:29] our maladies our anxieties
[1:34:34] and even our calamities
[1:34:37] he bore our griefs
[1:34:41] when he went to the cross
[1:34:43] he recognized that there were going to
[1:34:46] be times in your life where you were
[1:34:49] going to carry anxiety because the
[1:34:52] pressures of life were going to be too
[1:34:54] great for you to carry and so he chose
[1:34:58] to carry your griefs every one of them
[1:35:02] your maladies your anxieties and even
[1:35:06] your calamities
[1:35:08] oh mercy the calamities that i have been
[1:35:13] that i have been a
[1:35:15] part of that i helped to create
[1:35:19] ones that calamities said i'm
[1:35:22] embarrassed about calamities that make
[1:35:24] us want to crawl in a hole and forget
[1:35:27] that we were ever born we don't want to
[1:35:29] see people's face
[1:35:31] friends he bore it to calvary
[1:35:34] so that you don't have to carry the
[1:35:37] grief or the shame of it
[1:35:41] he carried
[1:35:43] our sorrows
[1:35:46] our pain
[1:35:48] our sorrow pain
[1:35:51] our physical pain
[1:35:53] and our mental pain
[1:36:00] there are many people today
[1:36:04] who are in physical pain
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] but there are far more people
[1:36:11] who are in mental pain
[1:36:16] every morning they wake up
[1:36:20] and they face some kind of a pain in
[1:36:23] their mind people that that have lost of
[1:36:26] a loved one through suicide
[1:36:30] and and they're contemplating it maybe
[1:36:32] themselves but oh friend god chose to
[1:36:36] carry that to calvary and to relieve you
[1:36:39] of your mental pain so that you don't
[1:36:42] have to carry it you say well brother
[1:36:45] how do i get rid of it lean on jesus
[1:36:49] christ oh you say that's so easy
[1:36:52] ah i don't know how to tell you
[1:36:55] any better than that
[1:36:58] to lean on jesus
[1:37:00] and when
[1:37:01] let's just let's just take for instance
[1:37:04] david david was a man
[1:37:08] who
[1:37:08] he
[1:37:09] he was a great king
[1:37:13] but there came a springtime
[1:37:16] where that he chose not to go to battle
[1:37:20] and instead he remained home and sent
[1:37:23] his soldiers out rather than going to
[1:37:26] battle
[1:37:27] and while he was sitting at home he one
[1:37:30] day he goes out onto the rooftop
[1:37:36] and he sees a woman
[1:37:38] over on another roof taking a bath
[1:37:42] the spirit of lust rises up in david
[1:37:45] and he says i want that woman and he
[1:37:48] brings someone brings this woman into
[1:37:51] his home she is another man's wife who
[1:37:55] is out fighting a battle now david is on
[1:37:59] and now david has has spent time with
[1:38:02] this woman he slept this with this woman
[1:38:05] and she is carrying his child now what
[1:38:08] does he do
[1:38:10] david he he
[1:38:12] he sends word to bring her husband back
[1:38:14] home he wants to try to cover his sin
[1:38:17] and make uriah go and then lay with his
[1:38:21] wife so maybe his sin can be covered
[1:38:24] over but uriah spends all night at the
[1:38:27] king's door he says how can i go have
[1:38:29] pleasure with my wife when my friends
[1:38:32] are out on the battlefield fighting
[1:38:34] now david says what am i gonna do he
[1:38:37] didn't go home and sleep with his wife
[1:38:39] he had no pleasure with his wife and
[1:38:41] she's carrying a child how am i to cover
[1:38:43] this up so now david has to do something
[1:38:46] even bigger of a sin and he sends word
[1:38:49] to his captain and he says i want you to
[1:38:51] put uriah in the forefront of the battle
[1:38:54] so that he gets killed
[1:38:59] and sure enough
[1:39:01] this woman's husband is killed david
[1:39:04] takes this
[1:39:05] takes this
[1:39:06] uh woman bathsheba into his house now
[1:39:10] and she becomes his wife
[1:39:12] but the sin is still there and this
[1:39:14] child is growing in her womb and when
[1:39:17] it's born it
[1:39:18] it dies and now david is weeping but
[1:39:22] somehow
[1:39:23] god sends a prophetic voice to david and
[1:39:26] helps him to recognize his sin now david
[1:39:30] is in mental anguish he is in a mental
[1:39:32] pain and this is the kind of pain that
[1:39:35] people are in today because they they
[1:39:38] their sin all around and rather than
[1:39:40] coming under the leadership of the lord
[1:39:42] jesus christ and and and though the
[1:39:45] temptation may come
[1:39:49] putting a stop to the temptation and
[1:39:51] saying
[1:39:52] that's not mine that doesn't belong to
[1:39:55] me
[1:39:56] jesus bore that to calvary and that's
[1:39:59] not a part of my life that is not who i
[1:40:01] am that is not who i've called to be i
[1:40:04] am not taking that into myself but see
[1:40:06] david partook of all this stuff and
[1:40:08] that's what people do they partake of
[1:40:10] all this stuff and then it pushes them
[1:40:12] to the brink
[1:40:15] where they want to commit suicide
[1:40:18] and they carry this mental anguish this
[1:40:20] pain they don't know what to do with and
[1:40:23] then then they have to take appeal and
[1:40:25] then
[1:40:26] oh friend
[1:40:29] it may be in that book that satan keeps
[1:40:32] a record of
[1:40:33] but jesus already nailed it to his cross
[1:40:36] he already nailed it to his cross the
[1:40:39] pain the sorrow uh the physical pain and
[1:40:43] the mental pain all of it was born to
[1:40:46] calvary yet we did esteem him
[1:40:50] stricken
[1:40:52] smitten of god
[1:40:54] and afflicted
[1:40:57] but he was wounded
[1:40:59] for my transgressions
[1:41:02] all i'm doing is i'm trying to let you
[1:41:05] see what the cross did for us what the
[1:41:08] cross really paid for how that we can
[1:41:12] apply it to our lives he was wounded for
[1:41:14] my transgression is there anybody in
[1:41:17] here that has ever transgressed the law
[1:41:20] of god
[1:41:22] every one of us i you don't have to
[1:41:24] raise your hands i know the answer
[1:41:26] before i ask because everyone all have
[1:41:30] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:41:34] god
[1:41:35] all have transgressed all have
[1:41:37] trespassed but he was wounded for our
[1:41:40] transgression that means that every
[1:41:44] wound that he carried
[1:41:47] it was for you
[1:41:49] it was for me
[1:41:50] for the transgressions that we
[1:41:53] were going to commit because this this
[1:41:56] is the
[1:41:57] what christ did at calvary it was able
[1:42:00] to reach forward to every human being
[1:42:03] and every sin that it would ever commit
[1:42:05] it was able to reach backward and get to
[1:42:07] every sin that any man ever committed
[1:42:09] before that he was wounded for our
[1:42:11] transgressions
[1:42:14] he was bruised
[1:42:16] for our
[1:42:17] iniquities
[1:42:20] bruised
[1:42:27] our human body
[1:42:31] we have all
[1:42:32] received a bruise at one time or another
[1:42:38] some of them are painful
[1:42:41] i bruise easily and my wife off
[1:42:43] oftentimes asks me where did that one
[1:42:45] come
[1:42:46] i don't know
[1:42:48] because i brew so easily
[1:42:50] many times i i get a bruise i bump
[1:42:52] myself and i don't i don't realize that
[1:42:55] i have hit hard enough for a bruise
[1:42:58] and then as we get older and our skin
[1:43:00] gets uh more fragile then then we begin
[1:43:04] to bruise and you know we we watch our
[1:43:06] elderly people sometimes when they have
[1:43:09] to go in the hospital and they they try
[1:43:11] to put these needles in their veins and
[1:43:14] their whole hand becomes bruised all of
[1:43:16] that bruising that we get you think
[1:43:19] about i just have a a mental picture
[1:43:22] that because of our iniquities his
[1:43:25] entire body was a bruise
[1:43:28] what was not a wound was a bruise
[1:43:31] it was just a bloody mess some of it
[1:43:34] under the skin some of it on top of the
[1:43:36] skin some being down the road as he
[1:43:39] walked and it was for our transgressions
[1:43:42] and for our iniquities the chastisement
[1:43:45] of our peace was upon him friends
[1:43:48] how many days do we live without peace
[1:43:56] things come along to steal our peace
[1:44:00] and we leave it as that
[1:44:04] we fail to return to peace
[1:44:08] we fail to return to shalom but the
[1:44:13] chastisement of our peace when jesus was
[1:44:16] chastised he didn't deserve any of it
[1:44:19] but he did it so that you could have
[1:44:22] shalom
[1:44:24] he carried all of that upon him so that
[1:44:28] you didn't have to carry your
[1:44:30] transgressions
[1:44:32] you didn't have to carry your iniquities
[1:44:35] you did not have to carry uh
[1:44:38] the place of of unrest and no peace
[1:44:42] he did it so that you could have his
[1:44:44] shalom
[1:44:46] and with his stripes
[1:44:49] we are healed
[1:44:51] now in the 50s and 60s during the great
[1:44:54] healing revival
[1:44:56] when a.a allen and
[1:44:58] oral roberts and brother branham and all
[1:45:01] of these healing evangelists were on the
[1:45:04] earth
[1:45:05] we have the privilege of these uh
[1:45:07] recorded sermons of brother branham uh
[1:45:10] where that the majority uh when he was
[1:45:13] out in the field the majority of his
[1:45:16] ministry was praying for the sick
[1:45:18] and god chose to use the praying for the
[1:45:23] sick as as a um
[1:45:27] i'm gonna call it a shadow
[1:45:29] a shadow of things to come it was it was
[1:45:32] him helping us to recognize that you
[1:45:35] could grab a hold of something by faith
[1:45:39] and you could see it as tangible so if a
[1:45:42] person come into a prayer line and there
[1:45:44] was a border hanging off of their neck a
[1:45:47] goiter hanging off of their neck then
[1:45:51] by the pronouncement of healing
[1:45:54] many times people saw with their eyes
[1:45:57] that goiter fall off of a person's neck
[1:46:01] because it was something visible
[1:46:04] now how did it happen
[1:46:06] it happened by faith
[1:46:12] and he kept telling the people it's your
[1:46:14] faith
[1:46:15] it's your faith your healing is because
[1:46:18] of your faith
[1:46:20] now many times perhaps people went away
[1:46:24] and they saw no physical manifestation
[1:46:28] remember his story so often that he told
[1:46:31] about john ryan who came into the prayer
[1:46:34] line he was blind he was led by somebody
[1:46:37] else he was blind he was catholic he
[1:46:40] sold newspapers uh and then he came into
[1:46:44] the prayer line
[1:46:46] and
[1:46:47] brother branham pronounced him healed
[1:46:50] go your way you are healed
[1:46:54] now
[1:46:55] for a skeptic
[1:46:58] who had watched goiters fall off of
[1:47:00] somebody's neck and they were still a
[1:47:02] skeptic
[1:47:03] and they heard the pronouncement that
[1:47:06] somebody had been healed of their cancer
[1:47:09] and they were still a skeptic and they
[1:47:11] heard somebody uh that
[1:47:14] had arthritis and they were pronounced
[1:47:16] healed and the skeptic was still a
[1:47:18] skeptic now they see this man come
[1:47:21] through a prayer line he's blind
[1:47:24] and he comes out the other side after a
[1:47:26] pronouncement of healing
[1:47:28] and the skeptic says it's just as i
[1:47:30] thought
[1:47:33] so now this man circles back around and
[1:47:36] comes through the prayer line again
[1:47:40] and he says to brother branham you told
[1:47:43] me that i was healed
[1:47:46] brother branham said yes and you said
[1:47:49] you believed me when i said you're
[1:47:51] healed
[1:47:53] i do believe you
[1:47:55] i believe i'm healed
[1:47:58] and then he asked brother branham what
[1:48:00] should i do
[1:48:02] because he still couldn't see
[1:48:04] brother branham gave him the instruction
[1:48:08] you go confessing
[1:48:10] your healing
[1:48:13] that was the instruction
[1:48:17] what was the purpose behind it
[1:48:20] was john ryan's faith not yet big enough
[1:48:23] for the manifestation of the miracle to
[1:48:25] happen i don't know but that was the
[1:48:28] instructions that brother branham gave
[1:48:30] to john ryan go your way you're healed
[1:48:33] you profess your healing so the man goes
[1:48:36] out and he says praise the lord he's
[1:48:38] healed me i can see
[1:48:41] and so now
[1:48:43] he goes back to the street corner
[1:48:45] selling his newspapers because he still
[1:48:48] can't see
[1:48:49] and he says extra extra read all about
[1:48:52] it jesus healed me i can see
[1:48:59] now what does that produce
[1:49:01] it now is producing more critics
[1:49:05] because they're saying
[1:49:06] you're a looney bird
[1:49:08] you are one more of a quack
[1:49:11] you can't see no more now than you did
[1:49:14] before you went to that faith healer
[1:49:16] what kind of a reproach are you bringing
[1:49:18] to the gospel but john ryan there was
[1:49:20] something on the inside of him that
[1:49:23] didn't matter how many critics he had
[1:49:25] heard that he was supposed to continue
[1:49:27] to confess his healing that he was
[1:49:29] healed and it was his faith that was
[1:49:32] resting in the promise of god
[1:49:34] and he continued to extra extra read all
[1:49:37] about it
[1:49:38] thank god he's healed
[1:49:40] me still blind
[1:49:44] so the story continues one day he goes
[1:49:47] into the barber shop
[1:49:49] and the barber shop being uh the barber
[1:49:51] being a critic
[1:49:53] john i hear you as down at the faith
[1:49:55] healer
[1:49:57] i heard you got healed
[1:50:00] john says yeah thank god i have been
[1:50:03] healed i can see my eyes are open
[1:50:07] he said at that moment his eyes came
[1:50:09] open and he come up out of the barber
[1:50:10] chair with half of a shave half of a
[1:50:13] haircut with the barber's apron still on
[1:50:15] him and he run down the street seeing as
[1:50:17] good as anybody else why because it was
[1:50:20] by faith that he held on to the promise
[1:50:23] i can see
[1:50:24] so with this stripe see all of that
[1:50:27] faith healing movement and the word of
[1:50:29] the lord that we have the blessing of
[1:50:32] him being able to hear still today was
[1:50:34] pointing us to
[1:50:36] walking this walk by faith
[1:50:41] wasn't just about healing
[1:50:43] healing is still yours with his stripes
[1:50:46] we
[1:50:47] are healed
[1:50:50] it's a done finished work as much as the
[1:50:54] chastisement of our peace upon him as
[1:50:58] much as being bruised for our iniquities
[1:51:01] is upon him as much as being wounded for
[1:51:04] our transgressions
[1:51:09] but i can still look and see that i
[1:51:11] can't see
[1:51:13] my eyes still aren't open
[1:51:16] but i can look and see that i still am
[1:51:19] i'm carrying around this guilt and this
[1:51:22] shame
[1:51:23] by faith
[1:51:26] by faith
[1:51:28] look away by faith
[1:51:31] this is a walk of faith
[1:51:33] now
[1:51:37] god knew
[1:51:40] that humanity
[1:51:42] can be awfully stupid sometimes
[1:51:45] just ignorant
[1:51:48] we just
[1:51:50] we can be told over and over and over
[1:51:52] again
[1:51:56] you know sister flo
[1:51:58] the same things that you and me deal
[1:52:00] with
[1:52:01] today
[1:52:03] they dealt with in the time of jesus
[1:52:07] same kind of mind battles
[1:52:10] you know in the time of moses they still
[1:52:14] had the same
[1:52:15] kind of
[1:52:16] mind battles and
[1:52:18] quarrels with one another
[1:52:22] they still quarreled with their pastor
[1:52:25] in moses time
[1:52:28] yeah
[1:52:30] moses he led the people
[1:52:32] for so many years
[1:52:36] and there was once upon a time that
[1:52:38] they're walking
[1:52:40] around and around in the wilderness and
[1:52:42] they got thirsty
[1:52:43] they wanted something to drink and there
[1:52:45] was no water and so they chided moses
[1:52:49] moses he goes to the lord and the lord
[1:52:51] said smite the rock
[1:52:54] water comes out of the rock
[1:52:58] how many times that they
[1:53:00] were there in the wilderness and things
[1:53:02] weren't going the way that they thought
[1:53:05] to go
[1:53:06] and they would come to moses and they'd
[1:53:09] give moses a hard time about it
[1:53:13] and moses would go to the lord and the
[1:53:16] lord would give the answer moses would
[1:53:18] come back pray for the people we'd give
[1:53:21] them what they needed but this
[1:53:23] particular time
[1:53:25] the bible said that the people
[1:53:27] were chiding against god
[1:53:30] and against moses
[1:53:34] and god said
[1:53:37] i've had enough of it
[1:53:39] and so he sent fiery serpents among the
[1:53:42] people
[1:53:44] and when he sent fiery serpents among
[1:53:46] the people the people
[1:53:48] were bitten
[1:53:51] now something come to me
[1:53:54] the people
[1:53:56] were spewing venom
[1:53:58] and god chose venom
[1:54:01] to take care of the problem
[1:54:06] and so is these snakes
[1:54:10] fiery serpents are spewing venom
[1:54:15] the people come to moses moses you gotta
[1:54:19] do something about it
[1:54:22] moses goes to the lord
[1:54:25] now i suppose that the people were
[1:54:27] hoping
[1:54:28] that moses could go to the lord
[1:54:31] just as he did
[1:54:33] when pharaoh kept calling him back
[1:54:38] and saying all right moses
[1:54:40] i've had enough of the frogs
[1:54:43] get them out of here i've had enough of
[1:54:44] the flies
[1:54:46] get them out of here i've had enough of
[1:54:47] this no
[1:54:49] that's not the way god chose to do it
[1:54:51] this time he told moses
[1:54:53] i want you
[1:54:55] to create
[1:54:57] a brazen serpent
[1:54:59] i want you to put it on a pole
[1:55:02] and i want you to put it up before the
[1:55:04] people
[1:55:06] and if the people
[1:55:08] will look on that brazen serpent
[1:55:12] they'll live
[1:55:13] now these fiery serpents that were
[1:55:15] biting the people they were dying
[1:55:19] because of the venom that was going into
[1:55:21] their veins
[1:55:23] and i just wonder
[1:55:25] remember brother branham called him at
[1:55:27] times dr moses
[1:55:30] i wonder in all of his
[1:55:32] study in egypt
[1:55:34] if along the way uh there weren't some
[1:55:38] men or women there were doctors and
[1:55:41] nurses in the camp who had treated other
[1:55:44] snake bites along the way but this time
[1:55:47] their remedies did not work
[1:55:51] and so god chose to tell moses you make
[1:55:55] this brazen serpent
[1:55:58] and you put it on a pole now brother
[1:56:00] branham instructed us that that serpent
[1:56:04] were represented sin that was already
[1:56:07] judged
[1:56:10] remember he judged the serpent in the
[1:56:12] garden put it on its belly
[1:56:14] because the serpent was an upright
[1:56:17] creature it was uh more subtle than any
[1:56:20] creature of the field it had an
[1:56:22] intelligence
[1:56:24] and it was
[1:56:25] most likely a good looking creature
[1:56:28] but when it uh when in the garden it did
[1:56:31] beguile the eve
[1:56:33] god judged that serpent and said on the
[1:56:35] rest of your days you'll be on your
[1:56:37] belly so now the serpent is on the pole
[1:56:43] and all the people had to do in order to
[1:56:46] live
[1:56:47] was look
[1:56:56] now some of us
[1:57:00] have had
[1:57:01] coveted
[1:57:04] and the couch
[1:57:06] became a comfortable place
[1:57:13] and i just have a feeling
[1:57:17] these people that were bitten by a
[1:57:19] serpent
[1:57:20] and that venom that had gone into their
[1:57:22] veins
[1:57:24] they carried them into their tent and
[1:57:26] they were laying on their palate
[1:57:29] and all of the sudden somebody comes in
[1:57:31] and said
[1:57:32] hey
[1:57:34] asher
[1:57:38] you've been bitten but moses said
[1:57:40] that god instructed him to put this
[1:57:43] brazen serpent on a pole
[1:57:47] and all you have to do is go and look
[1:57:50] and you can live and you can be saved
[1:57:52] from this snake bite
[1:57:57] why that's the dumbest thing i've ever
[1:57:59] heard
[1:58:01] i'm too sick to get off of this couch
[1:58:05] that's idolatry
[1:58:07] we know that moses has already preached
[1:58:09] that that kind of stuff was idolatry and
[1:58:12] and and i don't feel good enough to get
[1:58:14] off this couch
[1:58:16] i'm going to lay right here
[1:58:18] and and
[1:58:20] you know what
[1:58:21] how many of them laid right there and
[1:58:23] died
[1:58:29] because the venom
[1:58:32] was in their system
[1:58:35] and doubt swirling all around them
[1:58:40] and
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:41] memories of sermons that moses had
[1:58:44] already preached about idolatry and this
[1:58:47] looks like idolatry it looks so out of
[1:58:49] the question it looks
[1:58:52] like such a strange idea but here it is
[1:58:55] moses was instructed
[1:58:59] believe me people
[1:59:01] there were people in the camp who were
[1:59:04] just like i was on the couch who refused
[1:59:08] to get up off of the couch because they
[1:59:10] thought it was a dumb idea because they
[1:59:13] thought it was a foolish idea because it
[1:59:16] was not the way things had always been
[1:59:18] done they laid right there and they died
[1:59:25] and i'm convinced
[1:59:27] that when jesus died at calvary which
[1:59:31] became the the type of the shadow of the
[1:59:35] brazen serpent where all they had to do
[1:59:38] was look and they could live because it
[1:59:41] was an act of their faith to get up off
[1:59:44] of the couch and go look on the brazen
[1:59:46] serpent
[1:59:48] the sin that was already judged
[1:59:53] then christ jesus
[1:59:55] was put on the cross of calvary for my
[1:59:59] deliverance and for your deliverance
[2:00:02] and it wasn't just to save me from my
[2:00:05] sin
[2:00:09] that is the glorious part of this whole
[2:00:12] thing that jesus christ died to save me
[2:00:16] from my sin
[2:00:18] and i don't have to go to hell
[2:00:26] that isn't the whole story
[2:00:30] i
[2:00:32] am complete
[2:00:34] in him
[2:00:37] and just
[2:00:38] being saved from sin
[2:00:41] is not completion
[2:00:46] just being healed in the physical body
[2:00:50] is not completion
[2:00:53] he was wounded for my transgressions
[2:00:58] he was bruised for my iniquity
[2:01:02] the chastisement of my peace was upon
[2:01:05] him and with his stripes we are healed
[2:01:09] everything that i face in this life
[2:01:14] if i can look
[2:01:17] by faith
[2:01:19] to the cross of jesus christ
[2:01:22] to them that perish
[2:01:24] this preaching is foolishness
[2:01:28] but to those of us who are saved
[2:01:32] it is power to us
[2:01:35] it is dunamis to us
[2:01:38] it is something on the inside of us that
[2:01:42] excites us and it ignites us to go once
[2:01:46] again and look by faith into the word of
[2:01:49] god
[2:01:50] that he was wounded for my
[2:01:52] transgressions
[2:01:54] i don't have to keep paying for my
[2:01:57] transgressions
[2:01:59] you're not catholic
[2:02:01] i'm not catholic
[2:02:03] we don't have to do penance
[2:02:11] friend
[2:02:13] you don't have to do penance
[2:02:18] you have to do repentance
[2:02:21] and once there's repentance
[2:02:24] you can come back and once again look by
[2:02:27] faith at the cross and say he was
[2:02:30] wounded from my transgressions
[2:02:33] where i have transgressed the law of god
[2:02:36] all that stuff that the
[2:02:38] the the devil had written down in a book
[2:02:41] against me
[2:02:42] all of it was nailed to his cross and i
[2:02:45] don't have to carry it i am one who
[2:02:49] believes that the more than i can look
[2:02:53] to the cross then now
[2:02:55] understand
[2:02:58] when i say look to the cross i do not
[2:03:01] mean
[2:03:02] the execution poll
[2:03:04] i am looking to the finished work of
[2:03:07] calvary
[2:03:08] when jesus died at calvary he died for
[2:03:13] me he died for you
[2:03:15] so that i did not have to carry my
[2:03:18] transgressions i didn't have to carry my
[2:03:21] iniquities i don't have to go through
[2:03:23] this life without peace i don't have to
[2:03:26] go through life with a broken down body
[2:03:32] why are there so many people
[2:03:35] who are walking around with
[2:03:37] infirmities
[2:03:38] in their body
[2:03:42] i don't really know how to answer that
[2:03:47] but i know that jesus christ
[2:03:50] is still the healer
[2:03:53] and that when i pass from this life into
[2:03:55] the next one i'm not carrying any of
[2:03:57] that diseased body with me
[2:04:00] none of it is going with me because in
[2:04:02] that place there is only peace and joy
[2:04:06] and ecstasy of all kinds when we're
[2:04:09] there and and
[2:04:11] we we think
[2:04:13] we live in this life musicians can come
[2:04:16] i just want to say that we live in this
[2:04:18] life
[2:04:19] and we think about all of the enjoyment
[2:04:23] that we have in this life things that we
[2:04:26] do
[2:04:26] in this life
[2:04:28] that brings us
[2:04:30] enjoyment
[2:04:32] and and i heard a story yesterday
[2:04:38] brother brannan was relating a story
[2:04:39] about him hunting with charlie cox and
[2:04:42] how they loved to go squirrel hunting
[2:04:44] and
[2:04:45] brother cox asked brother branham do you
[2:04:47] think that we'll go squirrel hunting in
[2:04:49] the millennium
[2:04:51] and brother branham said no i don't
[2:04:53] think so brother cox says well we enjoy
[2:04:56] it so much here i
[2:04:58] wondered if maybe we would
[2:05:00] do it in the millennium and brother
[2:05:02] branham said well first off there will
[2:05:03] be no blood
[2:05:05] and second he said brother cox
[2:05:09] if
[2:05:10] perhaps
[2:05:11] when you were first created
[2:05:14] you were created as a hog
[2:05:18] and then somehow by
[2:05:23] whatever
[2:05:25] you
[2:05:26] progressed until you became a human
[2:05:29] just given a what if scenario
[2:05:31] if you started out as a hog and you
[2:05:34] became a human he said would you ever
[2:05:36] want to go back to being a hog
[2:05:42] he said that's the way it'll be when we
[2:05:43] step into that realm
[2:05:46] all of this stuff we had as humans that
[2:05:49] we enjoyed here it'll feel like hog
[2:05:52] and we're stepped into a new place where
[2:05:55] none of that will even matter friends
[2:05:57] all of these things that we experience
[2:06:00] down here that's exactly the way that
[2:06:02] it's going to be but i am here preaching
[2:06:05] to you that the cross of jesus christ
[2:06:08] the finished work at calvary was for us
[2:06:11] to experience the goodness of god to
[2:06:14] humanity while we live in a human body
[2:06:17] otherwise there would have been no need
[2:06:19] for him to come and suffer like that in
[2:06:21] a human body he did it so that he could
[2:06:24] experience it he could relate it to us
[2:06:27] he
[2:06:28] wanted us to know that he was wounded
[2:06:31] for our transgressions he was bruised
[2:06:34] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[2:06:38] our peace was upon him
[2:06:40] with his stripes we are healed he bore
[2:06:43] our griefs he carried our sorrow and as
[2:06:46] we look with greater faith toward the
[2:06:49] finished work of calvary it's still
[2:06:52] foolishness the preaching of the cross
[2:06:55] is still foolishness
[2:06:57] to those that perish
[2:06:59] but day by day the preaching of the
[2:07:02] cross the finished work of calvary all
[2:07:05] that it represented all that it entailed
[2:07:08] all that it brought for the believer it
[2:07:10] to us it is power it is it is power
[2:07:14] stacked on top of power stacked on top
[2:07:16] of power on top of power because we
[2:07:18] recognize that jesus christ did it for
[2:07:21] us because he desired that the very life
[2:07:25] of jesus christ would be evident and
[2:07:28] displayed on the earth once again
[2:07:32] let's stand
[2:07:36] let's try to sing
[2:07:38] he knew me
[2:07:40] oh praise god
[2:07:43] by faith friends
[2:07:45] look to calvary
[2:07:48] i'm not on
[2:07:51] an ego
[2:07:52] trip i'm nothing
[2:07:56] on my own
[2:08:01] i
[2:08:01] make mistakes
[2:08:04] i
[2:08:05] often slip just
[2:08:08] carbon
[2:08:10] flesh and bone
[2:08:14] but i'll prove
[2:08:16] someday
[2:08:18] just what
[2:08:20] i say i'm of
[2:08:24] a
[2:08:25] special kind
[2:08:29] when he
[2:08:31] was on

[2:09:35] was on his mind
[2:09:41] [Music]
[2:09:45] the look of
[2:09:47] love was on
[2:09:50] his face
[2:09:52] the
[2:09:53] thorns were on
[2:09:55] his head
[2:09:59] the blood was on
[2:10:03] that
[2:10:04] scarlet robe
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:07] stained
[2:10:09] crimson red
[2:10:13] though his
[2:10:15] eyes were on
[2:10:17] the crowd
[2:10:19] that day
[2:10:21] he
[2:10:22] looked ahead
[2:10:25] in
[2:10:26] time for when he
[2:10:30] was on
[2:10:32] the cross
[2:10:34] [Music]

[2:10:38] was on

[2:10:40] mind yes he
[2:10:44] knew me

[2:10:52] loved me
