meeting right now to make some decision on what kind of response Israel will make our our weak sick president is pressuring Israel not to make much of a step back the problem with that is it just teaches them they can do whatever they want to with no no retaliation we just have to pray that God will step in yes pray that God will strengthen the leadership of Israel they need American money but let's pray that they'll be strong enough to do what has to be done without fear without intimidation right right we may feel small in this little congregation but when we put our faith together with the faith of congregations around the world Our God does mighty things brother RJ will you come and pray over these request today sing this course once again as he's coming to pray as your presence

the house of the Lord today God is certainly been with us and he's so faithful to us I know Sister Flo's very happy to have her granddaughter Brandy with her today and her grandson Jason and

you're back in Alabama we're remembering brother Daniel as he's on the dangerous highways going north south east and west we just want to remember him to the Lord while he travels uh we're we're certainly glad that we could gather in the house of the Lord today and we want to receive the tithe and offering we announced last Sunday that we would receive a special offering for the building fund uh Down Under The Tabernacle we'll receive that in just a few minutes uh brother Hawke are you back in the sound booth I'm going to ask you to come and get ready to share uh while we're receiving the tithe and offering today uh brother Hawke is going to share a testimony with us and we'll allow him to do that and I I think that you can share while they're giving their tithe and offering so come on and brother ellias if you and Austin Yantis will go to the congregation if you have uh if you have saved an envelope and you already put your building fund offering in the envelope with your tithe and offering that is okay but we are going to come to you in a few moments to receive the building fund offering brother Hawk we're so glad that you have a testimony and we we we like to hear the power in a prophetic testimony yeah do you have the video ready yeah I just want to take a couple of minutes to uh share what I experienced in Ghana I really was not expecting to go to Africa when brother shell asked me to come along uh I really was not expecting it but it was my first T time to Africa and uh it was an incredible experience I wasn't really I had heard I wasn't really realizing what I was getting into you hear a lot of stories about the praise and the worship and about the passion but until you are in the meetings then you realize what it is uh they took so such good care of us it and um and one thing that I noticed about just how they treated brother Shelly Benjamin and I they treated us so well and there was so much respect and they honored Pastor shell like as a man of God and and even Pastor Tay who was over the ministry he showed so much honor the whole time they're not allowed Pastor is not allowed to carry his own Bible and they wanted to carry my bags too and and I actually it touched me the honor that showed and uh and you can see it in the video video because uh Benjamin mention mentions it it is uh an interesting feeling when you are driving towards the church and you're quite a bit a quite a bit away but the worship is just sounding all through the area and it kind of moves you yes and then walking into the building and seeing the passion on the people it was incredible and and so I'm trying to take it all in I'm watching and taking everything in what I'm experiencing seeing the people everybody smiling they were so happy and also I noticed that the worship that they were doing unto God it was life to them and I knew that when they were getting into the presence of God they were getting something just to keep on going and and that is probably one of the most valuable thing that we have when God is everything we need and I and and I was treated very well and a loved being around the people and I got to know uh Isaac Tay Pastor Isaac Tay who is I think the oldest son and uh and I actually when Pastor wasn't with us I would ask him a lot of question and get to know him very well and he was uh an amazing brother and when I was quizzing him you know then I found out that Pastor met him in Holland and gave him a prophetic word that changed the direction of his life and I think pastor had forgotten about it and now he has a flourishing Church in the UK and is also helping his dad like in Ghana I think I asked him uh how often do you come and I think three or four times and spend one month at a each time um and and in the meetings I could see that people were really receiving the everything went so smooth from when we started traveling and all the meetings everything was very well organized and they had great facilities and also what I was seeing in my mind just I'm seeing this big buildings but uh but what I had been hearing it didn't start like that it used to just be a small chart it's church but today it it it's many times bigger than this building and and the meetings were full um one thing that kind of touched me that happened is one of the time and it kind of made me a little bit proud to have a pastor like we do is he gave uh a an alter call and it was about pornography and lust and so he's a visiting minister in a big convention but he couldn't get away from it I could see it he it was heavy on him and he gives an altar call and you would think maybe a handful of people would come but it was a huge crowd but often people don't have the boldness to give a word like that it's a hard word to deliver and there's a lot of Shame around pornography and lust but when the Holy Ghost is there he wants to set us free from these things um and so we are going to play a video and I always have it in my heart I've always wanted to do is to do to do like a little bit of video so we can see what a mission trip looks like and I just took with me the church bought a tiny little camera and the whole thing is just filmed on a tiny little camera because my camera is kind of big and some of the church's cameras are big with a big uh like a Gimbal and I didn't want to you know look too obvious and be in people's faces with a huge camera but it turned out pretty good quality-wise and uh and so I hope you can see a little bit what went on and I hope you enjoy footage ever got on a mission trip yeah maybe turn off the lights quality is incredible but the artistic ability of our brother is [Music] [Music] outstanding to wear banana from [Music] oh [Music] many at times we have a lot of men of God and they feed the congregation and sometimes if I say when we we take it to food we can eat so much rice but we need somebody who will come and add flavor and vegetables to it with a unique Ministry and that is what Pastor Shel has brought into the message and into Bible Believers Fellowship he has brought a balance in the word mixing the prophetic with teaching and and and demonstration of power Miracles SS and wonders and this has really transformed the ministry and and and expanded the work of God down here in Africa it's opened our eyes to many things that God can do not only a one-sided Ministry but a prophetic has G giving us insight to who God is and what God has given to us and how we can bring the Kingdom of Heaven upon this Earth to walk the kingdom mandate just a few short days ago dad Hawk and myself lered in Ghana West Africa we've taken a short drive over to TMA where our hotel is and where the meetings are going to be held just just a short distance over there we're really excited to be here the expectation of the people is high and we're also expecting for ourselves this is my third time here and every time it seems to get better and better the atmosphere of the building is electric when you pull onto the property and then you go inside and it's even more electric with the worship we're just super excited for what the Lord is going to do h s man of God all the way from Alabama and there there's there's a new I learn today to describe him the word is super [Music] [Applause] cagis and in just a few weeks I'm going to be a great [Applause] receive the ministry of our pre [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] BL [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is Isaac Benjamin K I met Pastor Shelly when I was a teenager when he came he first came to Ghana we had this major convention and I was a tiny little boy playing keyboard and backing him on songs and I used to shiver when he's playing cuz I was scared of the crowd but with time I I got over rap [Music] [Music] and along the way um I met Pastor Shelly again in Amsterdam and he gave me a word of Prophecy that you are pursuing business management but the Lord has a higher calling for you and afterwards about 3 years later the Lord began to speak I moved out of Holland to UK and um through UK I've been to many cities but when the right time came the Lord relocated me to wampton specifically to start the ministry God to him PR Center and the Bible Believers Fellowship son but many sons are coming to maturity under the Dynamics of the resurrection power of [Applause] Jesus hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah I declare that in Jesus name it is possible I will recover all that Satan has stolen from me in the name of Jesus [Applause] [Music] Christ hallel I receive I receive it and when I was after I received the Holy Ghost I started ministering at 7 and I was pastoring at 17 so you are never too young to be used of the Lord and I want to encourage every one of you to give your lives to Jesus now my name is David shishi AA I am the youth pastor at bible Believers Fellowship teror I believe that that generally people who came in for the convention everybody would go back with a personal testimony I have had my personal testimony because there are many questions on my mind the Lord has answered now the spiritual side I've received a great impartation I'm going back into Ministry with greater knowledge um a higher spiritual level and I believe it is so for many other people too now many people came from different parts of Ghana and the testimonies they are going back with the healing of the infirmities in their bodies then the deliverance from um demonic forces oppression and all of these I I believe it's been a great an awesome time in the presence of God you know we know that nobody comes into the presence of the Lord and Lees the same we know that but at Easter 2024 meetings we saw [Music] it there was an overflow of Joy where people could express the the Liberty they have in Christ they could dance without thinking of what others think about them they could scream and shout and I tell you Bible Believers and the Easter meetings we had shouting dancing jumping clapping was our daily dose of medicine it was awesome we had pastors from Kenya ruanda Togo Nigeria myself from United Kingdom we had um Brethren from USA we had um Pastor Shel himself and the wonderful team from USA and we had another servant of God from the USA and a few across the continent of Africa I will say that they travel to honor the unique gift that God has placed in this end time in the early church the disciples traveled to Jerusalem because there was something unique there and when it comes to Pastor Shelley he's a unique gift to the body of Christ and he is very scarce he's a red gem we say he's one in a million so when we get the opportunity for him to come down because we are in close proximity we have to travel to come and benefit from his ministry and that is why we all troop in to sit under his ministry to be empowered to be ignited and to be set on fire for the Lord [Music] praise the Lord amen we are blessed to be a part of this unique Ministry and we're blessed that we can send him to the world I was there one time and it is a lifechanging experience and uh we don't want to make you African but we want you to Worship the Lord and we sure don't want to make them like the American church I mean I've traveled enough to know pastors that that's what they want to do they want to make everybody as dead as their church and I don't want that I want there to be freedom in the spirit why don't we give the Lord a praise for this testimony for what God did and continues to do he is continuing to work um Mariah did Charity give you you a few pictures that we can show um turning our mind now to the project down below can you um is that the first one we got that's with who was working yesterday I wanted you to see the how many do you have we're going backwards there I want want you to see that it it's not just slapping some metal on the side of the building um first the the the uprights and then the uh boards that go sideways with the uh foil foam panels that go in there and then the metal panels that go on over top of that and so the entire front of the building uh that we wanted to complete there which is 2/3 because we don't know what we're going to do yet with the thirdd so that is now got the metal completely across it and so we just want you to know that work goes on there many days of the week beautiful even though it uh you may not see what is happening but work is happening and so we're just so grateful for what the Lord is providing and so we want to come to you today for an offering to uh our next big step is to be able to spray foam into this into the roof the ceiling of the building uh it will do much better at uh prohibiting the heat penetration that comes through that metal roof more so than the um fiberglass that typically gets put in the in the ceilings so we want to spray 5 and 1 12 Ines into the ceiling the roof of that building and then it has been recommended that we also uh spray a fire retardant paint over top of that and so it's going to cost in the vicinity of $10,000 and I only say in the vicinity because we added 3et I don't know what those extra square feet are going to cost there is approximately $7,000 in that account right now so if you brought an offering today we want to give you an opportunity to give that and uh before I call on somebody to hold the offering bag we want to mention that uh brother Shelley's birthday is coming up uh on April the 28th but some of his family is going to be gone so he is we are postponing the picnic for his birthday his birthday celebration to the following Sunday of May the 5th so May the 5th after the morning service there'll be a birthday lunch and celebration for brother Shelley who is is going to have another number added to his birthday I mean by the time it gets there it's only three weeks from now you know he's pretty near to it [Laughter] and oh praise the Lord all right all right you're you're moving out of 55 and I'm moving toward it brother Austin Hodges will you come and hold an offering bag as the people come to give to the Lord today we are giving this as unto the Lord this is not for uh a Ministry this is not for a man this is to for the Lord and it is for our benefit because we are going to have a place to Fellowship there under the Tabernacle that the Lord blessed us with many years ago we're just updating it father I want to thank you for your people I Want to Thank You Lord that they keep Covenant with you and giving of their tithe their offering and as we bring a special offering today I want to thank you Lord for all of your provision I thank you Lord that your checkbook never runs dry your bank account never goes below a certain point I thank you for that

very glad to see you in the house of the Lord this morning there's nowhere on the earth I would rather be than right here among the saints and uh I know this is where God has placed his name and where his name is that where I want to be amen I don't want to be caught Anywhere But Where God would desire for us to be in such an hour as this this is the last days we are living in the last days we may never finish that that Fellowship Hall May Never finish we're that close to the coming of the Lord you can say Amen or oh me but the Bible is what's telling us the truth did you realize that we are that close that what has transpired overnight could I don't believe it's going to just yet but it could absolutely lead us into World War I which will not be a normal War it'll be a nuclear war and uh I want you all to know that the east coast of the United States would be a Target anywhere from Pensacola to Fort Benning to the to Air Force again in near Atlanta we are we are in the Target Zone and we don't need to be fearful we need to be faithful we need to know that we know that we know that we know that we don't have to go to somebody in the middle of the night and repent we've repented we've asked forgiveness of one another we've got everything under the blood I you know I was sitting there thinking uh our life testifies the life that we live I wouldn't want to be be here this morning looking back over my life and realizing I had lived for myself we're that close to the coming of the Lord I would want to know that I have lived it for the Lord and if you haven't you can you can start now and you can give God your everything he's not going to take your leftovers no he's not interested in your leftovers he wants to be your first love if you'll make Jesus your first love and you'll love him and you'll love his house and you'll and you'll love his people and you'll love his word you'll come out on top every time every time how do you know because I've lived it and I know what God can do I want to say again Hawk you did an outstanding job hours of footage hours of footage to be able to reduce it to 11 minutes and show you what you saw this morning we are extremely blessed reach over and get your bibles if you will and and turn with me there's just so much that we would like to to cover this morning but we we know we don't have time to do that uh there were couple people who had special songs and we apologize to you that we weren't able to use those songs this morning we knew that with the special offering with the video and the presentation of Ghana that we wouldn't be able to do that but please don't take it personal it's always a blessing to us when people want to sing for the glory of God we're blessed by it especially when they have had time to to meet with the band because it's more than a piano it's it's keeping the Rhythm and the bead and the drums and the guitars and and everything and uh we're just thankful this morning that when someone is out like Ben was out today with his family on a little holiday we're just so thankful that Josh can step up and David can step up and different ones can move up to another instrument and do whatever they need to do uh to make it and we're believing that soon we're going to have another keyboardist among us we have been blessed over a period of time with our brother I won't even call his name now I'll let him do do his own testimony but God has moved for him this week he's had a miracle this this week and uh the Lord spoke prophetically you may not know it was prophetically but he knew it the Lord spoke prophetically last Sunday and within four days God had done his part that's the God we serve so it may not be as outstanding as we would like yet but we can say Bible days are here again we're going to have a book of Acts Church we're going to have a book of Acts Church and uh we do have but not the fullness yet you heard the song This bride is not walking in her total Victory yet amen I thought when they called brother Austin up here to to hold the offering bag he's about to be a dad again within a few hours maybe a day or so sooner the better for sister Anna she's ready God has performed miracles for her every time there has been an alarm prayer has been offered up they have believed God and God has moved every time the doctors have been extra cautious because of what she has gone through uh with Gwyn and uh could have been could have been life altering for all of them it was in fact really life altering but God has moved each time we know he's going to move this week if this is the week then we know that God is going to be with them uh to Tuesday is Sister Sandy man's birthday so let's say happy birthday to Sister [Applause] Sandy we love her our love for her increases even though she decreases she's not near Brother David she's not near the woman she was but God is good and she's feeling healthier and that's what matters and we're thankful for that Wednesday is is brother Yos Alano Josh Alano's birthday on the 17th what H how old will you be you can 33 you know that's still so young again I I I saw a pair of socks in my drawer this week I'm quite sure they're 30 years old or more and uh I I've got ties that are 50 years old so you're just you're just young and uh we're just so thankful for him and and we wish him a happy birthday Moses where's Moses Moses has a birthday this week how old are you going to be 7 years old wow going on 17 or or 27 I'm not sure which sometime happy birthday to [Applause] Moses that's also sister Beth and brother Steve's wedding anniversary that day too so we wish them a happy anniversary and sister Gabriella a a longtime streamer in Germany who's in the hospital we we have had prayer for her blood pressure she's got a birthday on Friday so sister Gabriella when you see this we wish you a very very happy birthday she's been with us in Ministry a long time she even flew from Germany here for our wedding and that was a long time ago and so she's been with us and we love her and we ask the Lord to move for her that blood pressure is a lot to deal with uh Isaiah chapter 52 if you'll go back there I know the time is getting away from us I'm very aware of that uh but we're here for the word that's the reason why we gather and uh what a weekend we had last weekend Oh My we had some a couple of pretty profound testimonies that came in from our visitors we were full the church was full doesn't that bless you to see the church full and uh when it's not camp meeting time I think we had more here last Sunday than we had at camp meeting this past year and we had to put out chairs uh Saturday and Sunday and God was good and we had a wonderful Fellowship we had wonderful food and we had a testimony come in that God moved for one brother who was Des desperate to have a touch from the Lord and God ministered to him and it was a profound nature and we're very thankful all the glory Belongs to the Lord amen so much to thank him for Isaiah 52 beginning in verse one awake awake put on your strength oh Zion put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean we'd like to say neither your ballistic missiles or your drones nothing we woke this morning to a picture of the of the leftover of a missile floating in the Dead Sea that's a good place for it causing no harm to anyone but floating there in the Dead Sea not too far from from from inbo kick kick kick or kick where we have been many times God's looking after his people amen the next verse Shake Yourself Shake yourself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus says the Lord you have sold yourselves for nothing and you shall be redeemed without money I want you to go with me to Isaiah 49 verse 14 through 16 and then we'll we'll let you have your seat but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me have you ever felt that way be honest be honest can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget thee do you hear that yes it's possible that a nursing mother be able to forget her sucking child but God says to Israel I will never forget you that's to Natural Israel and to spiritual Israel I will never forget thee behold I have Graven Thee I have engraved thee that's not a tattoo by the way I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hand the word actually means carved I have carved you upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me God is saying if I wanted to forget you I can't every time I see my own hand I see you and I think of you don't we have something to be thankful for now Lord we need you today you came to us last SU Sunday our time is a little more limited today but you're not limited you can come in the time that we have and you can show yourself God almighty God strong God the same still able to deliver still able to save still able to set free and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated the word for walls if you'll put that verse up the word for walls thy walls are continually before me it literally means joined to a wall God is telling us he's telling natural Israel he's telling spiritual Israel now when we refer to spiritual Israel we're referring to one new man you see God says to us in the New Covenant there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Jew nor Gentile in the New Covenant in the New Covenant We Are All One new man that means that we have become sons of God and of sons of God he no longer deals with the redeemed under another Covenant he has made a covenant and fulfilled filled every requirement of the law by sending us Messiah that doesn't mean that we throw away the Commandments of the Lord it doesn't mean that at all in fact Matthew tells us that Jesus did not come to destroy the law he came to fill it up let me tell you something he's enough I'd like for somebody to say Jesus is enough we love this time of year we love Passover we love everything that it symbolizes but it's Jesus in every part of it when you hold the matah in your hand it's both pierced and striped isn't it and that tells us our Messiah according to Isaiah's prophecy would be both pierced and striped when when a piece is hidden and later brought out the aacom it represents our Lord being hidden away in the grave coming back fulfilling the Feast of first fruits with the Resurrection Life waved over the heads of the people we will at some point I don't know that we'll get to it this morning we'll refer to the red heer offering and Jesus is there the Scarlet the hisp the blood of the red heer that's that's Messiah every offering every sacrifice every element of both Tabernacle and Temple points us to the reality so remember when you hold on to the type you must also embrace the reality you don't do away with typology or symbology but you don't reject the Fulfillment either you you closly love and affirm who Messiah is in our lives and so we as a part of the one new man we Are Spiritual Israel that's not replacement theology by the way there's not even a small part of our doctrine that says that the church has replaced Israel that's actually Baptist Doctrine it's actually Methodist Doctrine but it's not Bible Doctrine the church did not replace Israel neither natural nor spiritual but according to Romans chapter 11 we were what grafted in to the Commonwealth of Israel so all of the life that God has promised to Israel you and I are also the beneficiaries so we Are Spiritual Israel so God is saying to us through the prophet Isaiah that I have joined myself to you that word walls there means joined to a wall God is telling us that he has joined himself to us even in our captivity Even in our sin Even in our Rebellion how many of you know he was watching over us on drugs on in sin promiscuous life and yet he said I've joined myself to you you're mine you were always mine you will always be mine that's the Word of Promise To Us and so a as brother gley mentioned I think this morning that old past or or or the prayer someone mentioned this morning that old life RJ I think that old life is so far gone it's so far removed from who we are today that that the Bible actually tells us and then the message of the hour came along on top of that and said you you never did it in the first place what Grace is is that that it's completely wiped out of the memory of a God who cannot forget unless he chooses to forget how many of you are glad that he has chosen to forget some stuff sir you're not shouting out like people who are grateful I'm going to tell you what they tell people in Ghana your amen is not born again you need to get your amen born again this morning God has chosen to forget a whole lot of things he knew about you Hallelujah Redemption is more than just forgiveness of sin Redemption is to be taken back to the original thoughts of God concerning your life so no matter what you've done or how long you have spent spinning your wheel no matter how long you spent on the gerbal wheel of performance trying to earn your salvation God looks over all of that he said you didn't need to waste those days but I'm a redeemer of time so as soon as you come to the revelation of who I am you'll re you'll you'll also have a revelation of who you are because of who I am yes sir come on and I will redeem the ears we're blessed people yes we are the word has set us free yes sir so he says to us I am joined to you like a wall so when it feels like the walls are closing in on us he is experienced ing the same thing that we are experiencing somebody said I need that in the New Testament I'm glad you do the New Testament says he is touched with the feelings yes sir of our infirmities so when you hit a roadblock he does too yes sir that doesn't mean he can't move Beyond he's the only one that can but it means he feels your roadblock when you get stuck in the BL he feels you're stuck come on when you get weary and discouraged he feels your weariness yes sir he feels your discouragement the good thing is he's not a job's comforter he didn't just come to tell you why you got to where you are he came to do something about it aren't you glad you serve a god who's able to do something about it [Applause] he's touched with the feeling of our infirmities all through the word we see God joining himself to the struggles of his servants even his disobedient Servants of which there must be some among us because if there's ever been a time in your life that you have not obeyed the Lord you've been a disobedient servant and you can wallow around in your sorrow and in your in your discouragement in your condemnation or you can choose like a captive Daughter of Zion get up awake awake put on your strength o Zion Shake yourself from the dust so God is always joining himself to the struggles of even his disobedient servants it's the one it's one of the most comforting and encouraging pictures that we have of the care that God has for his children and we have it all the way through the Bible are you with me consider Jacob you remember Jacob Yakov he later became Israel he was a very disobedient child of God he was an anointed servant whose sins brought him and his family to rock bottom bottom it was at bethl that God appeared to him supernaturally it was here that he saw a ladder reaching into the heavens and Angels who were both ascending the ladder and descending the ladder is't that good yes sir God's got your prayers going up and the aners coming down even in Jacob's Disobedience God wanted him to know I still hear you I still see you I'm still aware of what you're going through now get up yes sir get up get up you you see that greasy Grace Church they want a savior who comes with sympathy and and kind of leaves you in that place of of just existing but the god of the Bible the grace message of the Bible is not one that wants to leave you in your place of sympathy he doesn't want to leave you in your pity party he said hey I've come to you I joined myself to you and now I want you to get up I want you to get up yes cuz I'm here for you you're not alone when you're down and you're not alone when you're getting up I'm with you through your Downs setting I'm with you through your Uprising I'm with you when the bills are paid I'm I'm with you when the when the decline when you get the decline sir when they say sorry ma'am yes sir your card has been declined God's still there he's still God come on he was God when you were overspending now you don't have what you need he's still God he said if you'll give me my part that's all I'm asking God said if you'll give me my part not when you can afford to on now not when you paid everything else first God said you give me my part first and I will pour an oil on everything that is left amen somebody said but we don't have a temple God does have a temple and you're the temple you are the temple so you give God what belongs to God and he promises to take what's left and make it more than what it was in the beginning and many of us can testify without any stutter that God is faithful oh he's faithful even brother Daniel was testifying to me this week on the telephone that that in all this that's gone on in his life and this loss and this accident and what could have been but God was in the arrangements and he's working to recover sir and as you if you heard if you heard the preacher say on the video we're serving a God who says you can recover all give God what's his and keep your spirit right you want to know the favor of the Lord you want to know the blessing of the Lord number one give God what belongs to him number two keep your rotten Spirit right correct yourself let him restore to you the joy of your salvation serving God is where it's at I mean with everything you've got yes sir so Jacob had some things to learn he saw the Lord in Genesis 28:15 he saw Angel the ladder and Angels descending and ascending he heard God speak to him in an audible voice which is profound and precious God said in 28:15 I am with thee I think you might have that I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest yes sir it's a backslider God said I'll keep you I'll go with you wherever you go I will bring thee again into this land I will not leave thee listen here I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken of thee everything I told I'm going to do it you're in no position to receive it right now but I'm going to bring you back to the land I'm going to bring you back to the promise so here's what God did God Jo joined himself to Jacob even in Jacob's backslidden condition God joined himself to Jacob his enslaved son and pledged he would never be dissuaded from fulfilling his word concerning Jacob I'm going to keep my word you're not doing like you ought to do but I'm going I'm going to do like I ought to do in Genesis 2 8: 16 and 17 it says and Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place uh you read the rest I knew it not I wonder how many Sundays I wonder how many Tuesday nights I wonder how many prayer meetings the Lord has showed up and you didn't come on brother EXA the Lord was here waiting on you I'm just going to preach waiting to keep his promise to you and you didn't even show up you had a runny nose you had allergies someone recently gave me the excuse I had allergies well let me tell you something so do I come on and I'm allergic to people who make excuses I'm not talking about fever I'm not talking about uh situations that could be more severe but how many of you know that allergies are not contagious they don't feel good but they're not contagious God showed up here to keep his promise come on on a and I'm not just talking about physically showing up I'm talking about those times when your body comes to church oh yes that's exactly right but your heart don't show up your mind don't show up you praise are praise the Lord anyhow if I don't do that come on the preacher will preach on me Benjamin won't like me so I'm going to praise the Lord anyhow oh I'm not me mean to be disrespectful here I'm not trying to come unhinged before you I'm just trying to tell you like it is you know thank you for going through the motion but to God he really wants your heart a a and I don't care what you're going through if you can't take a moment away from your heartache and just say Lord I love you I don't feel like Nason but I I've got to tell you I love you I I don't feel like screaming it out come on I I may want to come back next Sunday but today I've just got to tell you oh Jesus I just want to like like the song that says uh I didn't come here today Lord to ask you for anything you've answered a million prayers or more that I forgot to thank you for so Lord I just came to to tell you that I love you I I just came Lord I just came how what's the words to it I just came to talk to you Lord I didn't come to ask you with my Santa Claus list of things that my family needs they do they need all that we need everything but today I I I I don't seem to find the faith to to trouble you or all those things I just have enough to say oh Lord I love you you've been good to me you've been so faithful to me Jacob awak out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place bael the house of God surely the Lord has showed up in his house and I didn't even know it I had missed it I had taken it for granted I had wallowed in my sorrow and miss my opportunity to say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away we've all been there but this is not a message to condemn you this is a message to tell you that God joined himself to you in your heartache in your sorrow in your pain in your loss in your mistake he joined himself to you in your backsliding in your lukewarmness sir when you grew cold he was still joined to you when you cared about him and when you didn't care about him he was still joined to you and he's got an appointment He's got an appointment for you at the house of God he's got an appointment for you at badeel he wants you to get down to the house of God remember you're the house he just wants you to acknowledge that you're his house and he wants you to corporately meet with Believers you'll never This Modern church will never ever ever ever convince me that being in church somewhere is not important it's more important than a Sunday drive it's more important than family reunion see your family evid L doesn't know you like my family knew me evidently your family doesn't know you like they knew my grny like her family knew her she had a much bigger family than I did and they just knew that a birthday dinner on Sunday meant one she was going to skip one day of the week oh it's quiet in here one day of the week on we didn't bury our dead on Sunday no sir come on we we we didn't go to this or that or that we on on that day they knew that she was going to be in the house of the Lord amen and God was going to meet her there she didn't just go for show she went for a purpose for a reason some of you came this morning not just to cheer Nanny you came for a reason for a purpose and God sees that you don't have to tell nobody but he sees that it's more than just you know passing by he gets it sir he gets it sir 20 long year Jacob awake out of his sleep he said surely the Lord is in this place and I know it not this is none other but the house of God next verse and this is the Gate of Heaven powerful isn't it yes sir 20 long years went by following this experience years of trial and sorrow wouldn't you have thought if you'd have been Jacob that his life would turn around that day that he'd have never been the same old worm how many of you have had some days where you thought this is my caterpillar changing moment I'm about I came in here a worm but I'm going to leave out of here with wings and a year goes by tell us holy ghost a year goes by 18 months goes by two years go by half a decade goes by a decade goes by 20 years went by for Jacob God comes down and meets him at the house of God meets him at the Gate of Heaven and for 20 more years he he crawled around like a worm in the dust remembering God when he couldn't when he didn't have anything else the when the when the NASCAR wasn't on come on when the Braves weren't playing come on brother when the god of college football wasn't being worshiped don't you see him nothing wrong with having a little team spirit but don't you see them Saturdays in the Deep South come on driving down the highway with their Flags flapping on their cars come on oh some of them went to church this morning folded their little hands in their lap and preacher preaching his heart out but next Saturday they can wave their Flags scream for their God but they come if they get to church at all can't squeeze out an amen come on this world's in trouble folks it brings me no pleasure if you think it brings me pleasure to preach like that it brings me no pleasure at all to have to preach like that the world around us is in trouble we have no excuse to be like them we have no excuse to follow the ways of the world we have no excuse to follow Babylon we have no excuse to be caught up in the Pagan mess around us and only think of God when times are tough on when we get bad news on when there's nothing else to think about wow 20 years he wormed around God said I'm going to bring you back to this land I'm going to keep my promise to you doesn't it sound like he'd have been the first to get in line hey I want it all give me the mountain give me my promise give me my inheritance but he crawled away from bethl and spent 20 more years worming his way through life I think that reality hit me this morning as I was sitting here I couldn't stand my listen I am 50 six years old might as well say and if you are 56 and you're not in touch with your mortality it's time for you to get in touch with your mortality it's time for you to realize that you're not promised to be 85 you look around and see sister uh Flo and sister Willams and sister ger and and they're living toward 90 and you you know you just assume well I want you to know that you have you do not have the the promise we don't know if we're going to make it that long a former Deacon of this church passed away this week unexpectedly at the age of 65 far as I know the the obituary now reads unexpectedly brother AER Danny AER one of the sweetest men I ever knew 65 years a far as I know without disease may be a heart attack says unexpectedly so that leads me to believe there was no horrible diagnosis from the doctor nobody was tending to his bedside feeding him in sure it just sounds like said with his family with his in his home in the comfort of his home is how the obituary read so if I were to look at that at 56 and and look at 65 and think of the reality that I could only have 9 years or less on this Earth and and you think for one minute that I'm stupid enough to want to spend that nine years worming around and leaving the promises of God on the vine when they're mine for the picking [Applause] no sir I want everything that God has promised me in my life yes sir hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and I don't just want it for me I want it for you so I ask you will you worm around no sir for 20 years this marvelous experience Heavens open open up ladder comes down Angels going up Angels coming down and God Almighty creator of Heaven and Earth speaking audibly he wasn't hearing it in his Spirit he heard it with his ear audibly telling him what I want to do for you in 20 years went by Jacob un unchanged years of trial and sorrow but through all those 20 years God was still joined to Jacob yes he was like he was joined to the wall if this wall moves God said I'm moving too I love the reports coming out of Israel this morning Israel survives I I loved yesterday some of these men on Fox News who who talk about Israel I've met them I've shaken shaken their hand excuse me I've shook their hand when APAC sent me to Israel uh in 2012 I I met a lot of the I I met Mark re reev who is the who at that time was the was the close uh counselor advisor to to president Netanyahu uh to prime minister n y we had private conversation so I get kind of excited when I see Danny Elon and others on on Fox News and and their story is always the same we survived open up the history book and read in every generation in every generation since Abraham the enemy has raised up yes sir a leader an army a nuclear power in every generation not just Pharaoh Pharaoh was just a beginning but many many after pharaoh and and here's what they're testifying God has always kept his word even Hitler couldn't destroy the promises to the seat of God [Applause] even a musolini couldn't destroy the promise come on you think the God who has stood by Israel day and night forgets you sir or turns his back on you because you keep warming around sir but there's a day coming God himself says my Mercy is extended and extended and extended won't you hear won't you turn don't you make up your mind to quit worming around and let me meet you again at the house of God let me meet you again at bael at bethl let me meet you again after leaving bethl Jacob settled down in apathy you ever heard that word before having forgotten the glory of his night with the Lord most amazing night of his life he had become cold backslidden lustful again God appeared and spoke to him again Genesis 31:13 I am the god of bethl just reminding you hey hey hey remember bethl on on God's done the same for you you remember the altar you remember the night the pillar of fire hung in the church you remember the night you remember the altar call you remember what Dwayne Jackson said do you remember what I isah Brooks said you remember that night you remember that night you made remember I'm the god of bethl I was your God that night and showed up on your behalf yes sir remember the Deliverance said God give you me come on remember the youth Mee remember how God I'm the god of bethl here God comes right into Jacob's life says remember I'm the god of bethl oh he didn't say I'm the god of Jerusalem because Jacob didn't have a Jerusalem experience he didn't say I'm the godd of Miss Station Alabama because Jacob didn't have a Smith Station Alabama experience he said I'm the god of bethl because God was reminding him of his own encounter we got to hurry we got to hurry sir come on now where you made a vow this is Genesis 31:13 and I'm just hitting the highlights so I may not have I am the god of bethl where thou anointest the pillar and where thou vest a vow unto me you got real spiritual remember Jacob remember Jacob you got real spiritual how many of you remember the time you got your little bottle of oil out anybody in this house ever got so stirred up in your spirit that you got your little bottle of cooking oil

bottle of all anointed your your your doors and windows and anointed your children you know this going to be a new new homeschool year no more yelling in this house we're giving ourselves to the Lord come on God said I saw you when you Anointed The Stone you took that Little Rock pillar little pillow the one you'd rested Your Head On You anointed that and you said this is the memorial that God still meets with man and I heard you Jacob when you vowed a vow unto me now somebody read them next two words now I'm coming to claim what was mine you gave me your life 20 years ago worm you anointed your pillar with oil you're pillow with oil you you you you you vow to vow now get up I know that's not the image you want you want to come to Papa Jacob darling come on you sweet oh Papa's Got You no no that was the god you had for 20 years while you were worming now God said I'm gonna be a different kind of God to you moving forward same God but I'm going to be a different kind of God I see that you have taken advantage of my sympathies I'm just being honest I see you playing around cuz you knew I loved you unconditionally and you took full advantage of Mama's prayers come on you took full advantage of granny's prayers you took full advantage of pastor's prayers but you kept laying in the dust that's truth so I'm ready now to have you get up woo I'm tearing things up get up now arise get the out from this land yes [Music] EXA right and return unto the land of thy Kindred I told you where I would meet you you don't have to check the address book you don't have to tune in the GPS you just get back to where I told you I'd be waiting on you sir come on oh that was God saying remember how I touched you remember the promises I made to you now go back to bethl get back to your altar you remember those times you laid those rocks in the wood you made you a little altar like one of the Old Testament and you met God there around that rock altar God says I'm coming to look for you oh wow come on now and I'm not coming to I'm not coming to uh uh to to NASCAR to find you I'm not coming to ww whatever it is to find you come on I'll I'll meet you if you want me I'll tell you where to find me I'll go right back to where I'll meet you right where I told you I would be now the Holy Ghost is preaching you've got anything good to say say it about him you've got anything bad to say say it about me but I think you know that the Hound of Heaven is after us all because he loves us remember go back to the altar go back to bethl you know what instead wouldn't you have run don't you tell me what you'd have done on wouldn't you have run to bethl well did you are you still dealing with the same sin 15 years later well you didn't get back to bethl brother I'm I'm your evangelist this morning you didn't get back to bethl sir you didn't deal with your stuff you see there comes a time that you've got to meet the dinosaur right where is Ezekiel as he asleep ezekiel's got to deal with his dinosaur he can't always sleep with his sister he came in this morning and and told us that he where where they said tell pat p where you slept last night I think it was last night said slept with sister nothing wrong with that oh Lord have mercy in a few years when they can barely stand each other won't it be wonderful to remind them that that's where you used to find your I just love the little things that she says the little little uh crumb snatcher was back there this morning and he reaches up on my desk can snatch you as him a protein bar and Joshua got on to him and I said no you can't have that that's not a candy bar that is a protein bar and you're not getting it and tally says don't worry Zeke I'll use my money and buy you one no wonder he want to sleep with her I would too if you know well tell pep p why you didn't sleep in your own bed there's a big old dinosaur there I hope you're hearing me you can't sleep with your sister forever sometime or another you're going to have to go back to your bed and deal with the [Applause] monster yes sir you're going to find he's not there you're going to find he don't exist the thing that's keeping you away from your bethl is a farce it's not even reality the enemy is trying to tell you it'll cost you too much no 20 more years of worming is what's going to cost this little bride if she chooses that kind of a life if she chooses another lap around the mountain I'm I'm going to be very real and very honest I'm fearful for you come on because I don't know if your generals have another 20 years I'm just being real my family gets mad they don't like for me to talk that way but it's reality I I hope that if if for some odd strange reason Jesus terries I hope I'm the strongest 90y old preacher the world has ever seen but I'm not promised of that and you're not either and I'm fearful for this little bride because I see her generals getting older and sicker it's not just one out there dealing with cancer but now several cuz you got to go if God calls you you're go with something I I I'm worried I'm worried if you can't make it with your Generals in the land what will you do Jacob remember how I touched you and you know where Jacob went in Genesis 33 not back to bethl he went to sheam one of the worst mistakes of his life do I have another hour she means two things it means going back and it means a place of burdens so Jacob chose rather to go back to a place of burdens than to an altar of Deliverance we're going to have a book of Acts church but we're not going to find it running back to our burdens we're going to find it running back to the altar Amen brother Amen brother he had to go back and Sheck them he got in all kinds of trouble do you remember on his house was Dishonored one one of his daughters was raped he didn't obey the Lord and it cost him The Virginity of one of his precious little girls and his son committed murder what horrible burdens Jacob had to carry because instead of going back to bethl he went to Sheck he went back to his burdens back to his sins back to his hardship yet not one time this is the most awful thing I know yet not one time did he even begin in scripture we don't know but in scripture we have no indication that he ever reckoned his troubles to being out of God's will he did like some of you have done remember I love you remember I love you tell the TRU he's done like like some of you have done on the devil's after me I'm under spiritual attack no no no no no no you're getting what you paid [Applause] for you're reaping what you sowed that ain't the devil trying to kill you come on that's God trying to kill you on cuz he knows the only way you're going to serve him is if you have a [Music] death I'm not talking about a natural death for some it means that I can show you in the message where brother brandom tells us about the Parson who fell away from the Lord bitterness and hurt with the church and so forth fell away from the Lord and he wanted all he wanted was cigarettes brother brandom said I've been guilty a lot of things but I've not been guilty of taking cigarettes to The Parson you read a little bit into that story and you'll find out that brother Bram later said and he died God took him before he totally by the way brother brandom indicates to us he he went to God now you won't get a revelation of that the Pentecostal Church you got to be a little bit Baptist to get that Revelation you got to know a little bit about election and predestination to understand how that's even possible you don't believe that do you brother Shelly with all my heart I Can't Hardly Wait was his name Ramsay what was his name I I did know his name I think I with all my heart I want to shake his hand and tell him you you ins your life inspired me because brother BR said God took him God took him to himself before he con completely destroyed I'm paraphrasing the testimony that he ever had for Jesus so even a even a physical death was better for that Brother come on oh I'm under so much attack and the devil's trying to kill my family come on brother and we can't make it and my son is that and my daughter and this and that and the other and it's the devil cuz we we belong to God and the devil Jacob Jacob had a reason that's right Jacob had a reason for everything bad that happened and none of them had anything to do with bethl he didn't he never never acknowledged that your suffering your trouble your trials not only on you but on your daughter raped your son guilty of murder because you're out of God's will you're being you're at the wrong place at the wrong time I called you to bethl and instead you went to sheam in Disobedience had we been there how would we have you know we'd have tried to straighten Jacob out and oh sir you're in this mess because of the disobedience in your heart and if you'd have done right well only old people have the courage to correct people that way this Mambi pambi group of of generation xers weak weak limp wristed weak come on a gener generation turtleneck wearing generation men with bangs no socks the prophet said describing that beat generation no belt Brites sagging too sorry to S it up flashing everybody with where the Lord split them you know what I'm saying drawers hanging you expect this generation to tell anybody you're dealing with what you're dealing with because you wouldn't obey the Lord no you got to be old and don't care you've got to come to a place where it doesn't matter to you what people think about you at the end of the day you're tired of compromising with somebody else's sin and you just make up your mind to say Jacob quit blaming the devil for what you've done you did this H get out of she grab your children and get out I wasn't coming back to this this morning I got I mean I had 10 pages left but I wasn't coming back to this this morning he dealt with me last night like you dealt with me last Saturday night I woke up this morning I fought all night over the borders this was spiritual I fought all night over the borders of this Campground all night long it's spiritual it's not natural not a single word you have disobeyed God look at the shame and sorrow you've brought on yourself and your family how differently our patient God handled Jacob not a single word was spoken to him about sh or about being out of God's will not a word about all the pollution and the murder and the uncleanness no reproof no guilt no trip no guilt trip no condemnation just like the Fallen daughter the captive Daughter of Zion laying there God didn't condemn her didn't say you know come here he he he didn't condemn her for her what she allowed he didn't show a tremendous amount of sympathy he just said get up from there does anybody remember what God Said to Jacob in 351 if if you don't have it would you put it Genesis 351 you realize how far we've come through Genesis with the same old worm and God said unto Jacob I know what I'd have said to Jacob you you're worse than an Infidel you're reaping what you've sown God never mentioned the Disobedience the suffering or the pain he just said arise get up to bethl and you don't need a Sunday visit on once a year you need to get there and stay there yes sir and remember how to build an altar you built one one time at bethl now I'm telling you get up go back to bethl dwell there make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fled from the face of Esau th my brother do you remember when I met you there I want to meet you there again God had every right to scold him why did you ignore my instruction why are you so disobedient so weak why do you refuse to Listen and Obey wow would I ever like to say that to folks this morning but God didn't you see I'm not nearly as far enough along as I ought to be he simply said go back to bethle go back to your vow go back to where I met you you remember the Rocks you poured oil on do it again no guilt no condemnation no why do you refuse to Listen and Obey go back to the altar simply go back to your first love are you still with me I'm I'm hurrying along go back to your first love and guess what it's struck the target 20 plus years later 20 plus years later lot of Sorrow this is going to be rough for some streamers but you daddies think of this have you ever thought about how it would break your heart to see one of your little girls wearing a pair of blue jeans I realize that's not the worst thing she could ever do I realize that's not the grossest sin she could ever do but it hangs over me sometime the thought I think a backslider ought to show respect I think when you go to Mom and Dad he the least you can do put on a skirt some people condemn her for doing it some people condemn her for not doing it some people condemn a mom and daddy for not letting them come back unless they do some people condemn them for letting them come back if they don't you can't really win with people but it it hangs over me sometime I don't know I'll be honest with you I don't know I have a feeling I wouldn't handle it very well I wouldn't handle it very well if one of my daughters walked in my house one of these days with their hair bobbed off because they know better just like you folk know better but the thought of your daughter being raped because you took her to the wrong City because you hung out in the wrong place the guilt of that I don't know how you could get above that hardly I don't know how you could rise above that I know it's getting tight in here but finally yes it struck Jacob yes sir I've tried it all I've tried everything else I've worn my way everywhere else I could go so he just decided to get rid of all of his idols Bible said Bible tells us he he'd become an idol worshipper gathered up his family went back to bethl aren't you glad he did cuz Jacob wasn't always going to be Jacob sir he was going to have a name change he could have had it 20 years earlier than he did did get get up get back to bethl this time he responded he gathered up his family went back to bethl there he was restored and God was joined to him until the victory was won we too are being called in this hour to lay down our Idols to put on new clothes to get back to the altar of repentance come on I need an amen Jacob's not the only example of God's persistent faithfulness to his children look at the New Testament example of Peter yes sir what could possibly be worse than a reputation for denying the Lord poor stumbling failing cowardly Peter out in the boat fishing trying to soothe his troubled conscience on the shore was the one he had denied Jesus didn't come to Peter to condemn him he came to give him dinner yes sir folks I can't fathom a god like this think about it if you think you've got God figured out I assure you you do not doesn't it seem like Jesus would have slapped Peter senseless come on but instead he came and cooked him fish he made him a little meal Peter's out there trying to clear his head going back to what he knew fishing and all of his failure and all of his denial trying to get his mind cleared trying to get out from under the condemnation Jesus comes to the shore built a little fire cook some fish and calls out to Peter come and D come and dine come and D come and dine Peter comeing nine you see I can't tell you how long this will go on before you really pay all I know is if you belong to God he's persistent enough I cannot tell you what it'll cost you but one day you'll give him everything you see there's a lot of folks I don't worry about this going to hell I worry about how much it's going to cost them to get to heaven I don't live in fear of my loved ones going to hell I've got a promise I know what the word said I don't lose my mind over you going to hell I know where you're going most of you I've got a word I've got a problem PR I've got a personal revelation for many people in this house but what I do worry about is what it's going to cost you before you find your way back to bethl come and d i I love Peter I do I love everything about Peter I love his temper I can resemble that I I mean I his Humanity the fact that he couldn't really lie cuz even the chicken towed on him I mean there's some of you your destiny is so big in God you can only get so far and even the roost ERS will start telling on you come on now some of you had mamas like roosters and Daddy's like roosters and Grandma's like roosters and you go out and pretend to do a certain way and and God God just come by and tell Granny on you tell mama on you tell Daddy on you tell you come on come on come on come on and God loved Peter so much and and one of the reasons why I like the Chosen and I face a little criticism because I do but one of the reasons why I like the chosen is because of Peter he has short people syndrome kind of like a little Banny rooster got amazing biceps for such a little shrimp he don't mind to show his knees if he has to you know he's used to working hard fishermen couldn't wear uh robes to the ground you know they had work to do I like his struggles I like his loyalty in the chosen I'm talking I like his loyalty he don't understand everything he don't pretend to understand everything but he's always trying to help somebody keep the right attitude can you imagine with the temper like him above sa and yet he wants to make sure he's worried about Thomas he wants to make sure everybody keeps the right attitude God's talking to somebody Jesus says come and D have you failed the Lord have you disappointed him have you done despite to his grace have you lived a life like a slave in the dirt when you could have been living in the victory are you afraid of God's Wrath are you in turmoil because you think God Wants Revenge then look at the savior's example here come and DME I got a fish sandwich for you I'd like to choke you with a bat you've hurt me but I've got a fish sandwich for you because your destiny is ever before me he's saying I'm joined to you Peter it'd be easy in the natural to cut you off yes sir but but in the spirit I'm join to you can't get away from you yes sir believe in you yes sir hello the Lord fed Peter he lovingly showed him the root of his problem it was though Jesus was saying to Peter I enjoy fellowship with you did you know that if you and I could get that Revelation today that he doesn't just want you to cower he wants to fellowship with you he wants to spend time with you he doesn't just want your blind obedience he wants to fellowship with you he likes you he doesn't just love you he likes you he wants to have a meal with you he leaves the church world to condemn you come on he just wants to feed you yes sir John 2115 so when they had died Jesus said to Simon Peter lovest thou me more than these this was the acts being laid to the root Peter's real problem all along had been Pride before he fell Peter had thought of himself as someone especially holy Pious strong in wisdom and full of character remembering his boast remember his boast he said though all others fail not I he genuinely believed he loved the Lord more than any of the other disci do you hear me do you hear what I'm saying sir Peter really believed that nobody loved Jesus like he loved him and that's why he had to go to Rock Bottom and he didn't deny him before Kings and potentates he denied him in front of a dishwasher he had to see himself he considered himself a bit more sober more sincere more zealous more concerned with the kingdom it's in such a circumstance that God allows sin to serve his holy purpose hear me he will let a Christian's Pride be severely tested by overwhelming Temptations some of you have fallen where you have fallen because Pride was your problem God opened the door and allowed the enemy to tempt you he allowed you to fall right in the middle of it he allowed you to to slop around in the poop because you thought you were such a Jew so holy so holy you Pharisee come on brother and you ended up in the pig pin the most hated thing and here the prodigal props his head on a mother s the Bible said he would have vain filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat he was ready to not only eat a pig he was ready to eat pig food but one day Jacob heard the call go back to bethl Peter heard the call come and dying The Prodigal heard the call my father has servants that are eating better living better than I am I'll just go back and apologize I'll just go back and tell him how sorry I am and I won't even ask to be a son I'm not worthy to be a son I've already spent my inheritance I've already shamed my father hear me I'm nearly done I've already shamed my father but he said I'll just let ask him could I be a slave could I be a servant could I be as one of your hired servants once God got to the root of Jacob's problem he was living in an alternate reality he thought the devil was attacking him and he realized I'm paying the price for not doing what God called me to do Peter had to learn that he was living in an alternate reality and it was his pride that was costing him everything the prodal had to learn that he too was consumed with with pride sir and he was lustful of the pleasures of the world he wasted his inheritance on riotous living there's something wrong with somebody that'll spend $5,000 for a three-day ticket to watch a golf game and that's where that's the world we're living in the whole world has descended this weekend on Augusta for the Master's tournament and they may sell you a Pino and cheese sandwich for $150 but you've done paid $5 $5,000 or more to be there for the weekend my God they ought excuse me that wasn't the right way to say it my goodness they already give you the sandwich and there's a lottery in only 20,000 people because they've already got people who have tickets every year there's only 20,000 tickets available and there's a lottery and there's usually 75 to 100,000 people on the list waiting to spend to watch one of the most boring games in the entire world to watch Joshua River Shelly you may thoroughly enjoy playing it but watching someone else it's about as exciting as tennis at least with football oh they keep falling down basketball is about as I'm telling you it's kind of dull too to me I know some of you get real excited the only thing that can keep my attention for more than 10 or 15 minutes is baseball and that's only because there's so much going on at one time and and and and it's not just a ball back and forth it could go anywhere usually up usually over there the most exciting part of watching a baseball game is watching people catch the ball out in the stand and then hold it up as though no one saw them catch it people spend all that money to experience something like that never care that you were born with a destiny with a higher purpose exactly right God has a message he wants to deliver to peters's and Jacob's and prodigal sons and captive Daughters of Zion what message does the Lord want to deliver not revenge or wrath or judgment no he will add no sorrow to that brokenhearted howling hurting woman lying in the dust rather he chooses to comfort her with these words Isaiah 5 27 I'm closing musicians are coming I'm not done but I'll stop let me read Isaiah 527 this is what he what he says to the Fallen Daughter of Zion this is how he Comforts her this is how he wants to comfort Jacobs and pull them back to their Destiny and prodigal sons back and Peter's back and Fallen Captive Daughters of Zion how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith UND Zion thy God reth your beauty is not in your pride your beauty is not in your ability to buy $5,000 tickets do you think you've arrived you're ability is not to flash your Dollars around that that that's not what makes you who you are the most valuable thing about you is the call of God on your life to comfort Zion that's right to shout the good news you can run yourself ragged in your studies and miss the reality of a relationship with Jesus Christ if you've missed a relationship with him you're a religious fool you can be a fool an educated and religious fool if you miss your opportunity to have an intimate personal relationship with Jesus Christ yes you believe that say amen I want to read you one more place in closing Isaiah 5289 thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion Break Forth into Joy sing together ye waste places of Jerusalem for the Lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed Jerusalem naturally speaking it's not an Iron Dome I stood there as a guest of APAC and saw the first Iron Dome that was installed in Jerusalem when when you hear Iron Dome you may wonder what it looks like I saw it with my own eyes I touched touched it with my hand I know the reality of it it works amazing on Kasam Rockets which are homemade Rockets but it in no way has the ability to deal with what Israel dealt with last night so there's two more levels of security Israel has the the greatest technology for weapon defense in the world and if you if if you are one of those uh Loosey Goosey Democrats who sees America funneling money to Israel as though they're just giving it away no that's what we're doing in the Ukraine but what we're doing in Israel is investing in somebody who has the ability to protect our nation right because the technology for those weapons and missile defense uh strategies is now ours it now belongs to us and we may need it before this thing is over I've told you before Israel has three levels of defense and all three actually four but two are are cousins of one another top level I don't remember the name the second level is is called David sling you've got Iron Dome David sling does anybody remember the name of the of the of the two cousins arrows and they got numbers after that don't they they're cousins they're they're very similar systems and for the first time in the history of Israel all three of those weapon defense missile defense units were used last night Israel has always had a problem problem with pride look the book read the book that's not an awful accusation it's the truth she's always had a terrible problem with pride that's why God didn't allow her to amass in the beginning the weapons and support that she has today that's why her most successful victories have been dropping mov cocktails out of airplane windows did you know strategically by the Numbers Israel's victory in the Sin when the nation was being founded was more successful by the Numbers I've been on the airplanes that the malov cocktails were you know what that is don't you gasoline fuel in a in a Cocola bottle with a rag hanging out the end that's about what it is they were taking out not only armies but they were taking out weapons of hundreds of thousands of dollars of value with Cocola bottles full of fuel why would God do something like that why would God show up on the Temple Mount just before Moshe Diane gave the Temple Mount uh into the authority of the of the Jordanian walks Moshe Diane you'll know him by his one eye patch he was a a great Statesman but a quite a compromiser why would why would God do the things that he did on that Temple Mount where uh uh Jordanian soldiers have testified that it wasn't the few little Israeli soldiers that scared them that's not what caused them to run out of their sandals it was that army of white that showed up on the Temple mount I have spoken to the eyewitnesses of the event now you can read it in a book and say hm but when you're sitting there with someone who experienced that brother gy and I and brother brother West and brother Whitaker and you hear them tell the story themselves or or his his personal test gersan Solomon's personal testimony of how God spared him after the Jeep ran over him it was the army of white that sh showed up that gave them the victory so let me say this we're thankful to God for iron domes and David's slings and all the other technology that that God has blessed Israel with but we really know that it's the hand of God's provision and Providence over Israel that's bringing her the survival that she has today and the success isn't that amazing and God he just humbled her and he will again if she won't serve him right the the the event that started all of this was was what we would call a rave in this nation a wild worldly party where people were half-dressed banging their heads on one another celebrating peace between Jews and Arabs it wasn't a holy ghost tent meeting it was a horrible awful hideous unprovoked Massacre but God speaks in all things I don't know if you've seen the pictures of how Israel ran out of her shoes on October the 7th not because of an Angel Army but because an of an invasion from hate-filled people and their shoes remain people are going and visiting the site the bloody clothes are are are are left for people to see the enemy is to blame but God's always talking to his people without me you're nothing you're not even keeping the Commandments that I've given you much less turning toward a coming Messiah but she will the Bible tells us all Israel will be saved Only a God like ours could pull that off let's stand in oh Jacob oh Peter oh prodigal go back to bethl go back to your first love Peter oh prodigal go home to Papa everything you have need of is waiting on you he has no condemnation no guilt no judgment he's just
