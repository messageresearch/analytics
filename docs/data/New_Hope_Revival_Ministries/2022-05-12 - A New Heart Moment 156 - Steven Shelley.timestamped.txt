[0:00] now why did he give you a heart of flesh
[0:03] [Music]
[0:11] now when moses
[0:13] came down off of the mountain
[0:15] what did he have
[0:18] he had two stone tablets
[0:21] hard
[0:22] stone tablets
[0:26] that god had written on
[0:29] now we know that when he came down off
[0:30] the mountain and there was a noise of
[0:33] war in the camp and he says what is
[0:35] going on and and and he ended up
[0:37] breaking those stones
[0:39] but on that was
[0:41] the commandments of the lord and god
[0:44] wrote them on that but god knew that man
[0:48] could never keep
[0:50] that commandment of the lord as long as
[0:53] their heart was as hard as the stone
[0:56] tables that the original commandments
[0:58] were written on he knew that when man
[1:01] was hard-hearted that he could never
[1:03] receive the seed word of god so he had
[1:06] to take our heart and make it a heart of
[1:09] flesh something that could be written
[1:12] upon
[1:13] he knew that all of those commandments
[1:16] that he gave to those people he knew
[1:18] that the people could never fully
[1:21] 100 percent
[1:23] obey them
[1:24] he knew it what he gave him
[1:29] because
[1:30] he knew that it was only the shadow of
[1:33] what was to come
[1:36] his purpose his plan
[1:39] was not for people to try within
[1:42] themselves to be good enough to present
[1:46] themselves before a living god
[1:49] because he knew it was impossible
[1:51] because the endemic nature was still in
[1:54] them but he knew that there was coming
[1:57] that uh that perfect one that he was
[2:00] going to step into the body of human
[2:03] flesh and he was going to present
[2:05] himself as the spotless lamb the lamb
[2:08] that was slain from before the
[2:10] foundation of the world and all of those
[2:12] things that could not be kept by the
[2:15] human race all of those things that
[2:18] looked too hard to attain
[2:21] he did
[2:25] he did
[2:27] and because he did
[2:28] i did
[2:31] who do you think you are
[2:32] i'm in him
[2:34] that's all i know to tell you i'm in him
[2:37] he he did it
[2:39] and he beckoned me to come and be a part
[2:42] of that
[2:44] final work of the spirit of god in in
[2:47] the human race
[2:49] and he wanted me to be so much apart
[2:51] till he made a way for me to get to him
[2:53] and he says i'm going to take that stony
[2:55] heart out of your flesh and i'm going to
[2:57] give you a heart of flesh now why did he
[2:59] give you a heart of flesh god wanted it
[3:02] to be so written right down here until
[3:05] that there was no way that we could ever
[3:08] get away from it if if we forgot our
[3:11] bible somewhere or if we were in a
[3:13] position and maybe in a prison somewhere
[3:16] where they wouldn't let a bible come to
[3:18] you the word of god already inscribed on
[3:21] the inside and it doesn't matter whether
[3:23] they take your bible away from you it
[3:26] doesn't matter what they take away from
[3:28] you because god did not give you a stone
[3:31] tablet that you needed to carry
[3:33] everywhere but he gave you a heart of
[3:36] flesh a fleshly table of the heart and
[3:38] he's inscribing his word on that
[3:42] so that it is a very part of your life
