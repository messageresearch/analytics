TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and I'm coming to you again today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson and all of the fine folks at the gospel channel you know I don't know if you have missed me or not but I have certainly missed my opportunity to come to you we have had a few weeks of break now and I think some of the programs have been rearing and I hope we're not getting on your nerves by that but would you believe that consistently while we were away not taping regular programs with you we were all the time still receiving prayer requests and testimonies and contact and I want to tell you how encouraging it was and you know sometimes when you call and if it's during our business hours our working hours here someone takes the call and they will often make a note in the computer that they could hear the program in the background and I can't tell you how encouraging that is to us when we come here we come in the name of the Lord and we come to be a blessing we want to teach we want to preach the truth of God's Word but we also just want to be an encouragement to you and this morning earlier I was watching I don't normally do this but sometimes if there's been a break it's a it's a good idea for me to go back and hear the last few minutes of the last program that we recorded and I have to tell you that I really sense the anointing of the Lord coming down at the end of that program as we begin to talk about some of the miracles that we have been blessed to see with our own eyes through the years and a time of prayer that ended the program that was just a real blessing to me and I could sense the anointing of the Lord on it and that was also very encouraging I'm just thankful so many of you wrote to say that you enjoyed the inner used with brother Gerald Hicks his testimony a life that was you know destined really for ruin and failure but by God's grace sometimes we say but God and you know that's what it is we can see that his life would have certainly been different but God he had a different plan I'm just delighted to serve a god like that I am I consider it a real joy to know personally to be intimately acquainted with a god like that who loves us so much and who is so jealous for our destiny that he would do for us for brother Gerald Hicks providing someone to rescue his life as just a little baby to prepare and preserve him for the greater things of God when I look back over my own life and my own testimony and I don't often share anymore the the personal details of my testimony because I realize that in doing so I have at times not with purpose but hurt some of the people who are involved in my life perhaps even including my parents and I wouldn't want to do that but but I can tell you that though the hand of God was on my life from the very beginning there were a lot of heartaches along the way a lot of disappointments a lot of things that could be considered forms of perhaps emotional abuse or but but God he had a plan and he has been faithful and by His grace I want to be faithful to him our lives are different I was told when I was just a small boy by the Lord that my life would be different and that I would experience things that would be difficult to walk through in my younger years but that God would use that he spoke to me I will use the testimony of some of those things and in those earlier years when I felt a little more free to go and speak to young people about my testimony there were Red's maybe thousands of young people who would come and say you know I realize if you could walk through some of the things that you walked through maybe going through the public school system being very very different having strong biblical convictions and you made it by the grace of God coming from a broken home and living through the second marriage of my mother who married a very abusive man and I watched her many many times being beaten almost to the point of death and yet the grace of God preserved me and preserved her because he wanted us to have that opportunity to serve the Lord and to share truth with others and so in those earlier years as I could share that very freely many many people would say this is an encouragement to me and you know what you've got a testimony you've got a testimony you that are holding on to Jesus Christ you've been through some real stuff how do you know that you don't know me well I may not know you personally but I know life I do I understand being a pastor for so many years I'm telling you that your problems may be much different than the one next to you but everybody who's living life on planet Earth we have our difficult trials we have those situations of loss and grief with Hope deferred disappointment and discouragement many of you watching this program have dealt with perhaps most of your life even with heavy depression and it's all you can do to keep pressing through that just to be able to put a smile on your face and sometimes it's a phony smile but it's the best that you can do and yet you survive and in many cases overcome because you have learned to lean on the Lord Jesus Christ and to depend on him and I'm so thankful that we have him I'm so thankful that we're not left here on planet Earth to have to get through to scrape by but God gives us the power of the overcomer if we trust him and we trust his word so let me just say to you know whether you've missed me or not I've really missed you and I'm feel very blessed to be able to come today again and represent the gospel channel what a wonderful work of God is going on through the Ministry of the gospel channel reaching across Europe and all of Scandinavia and I tell you we don't know sometimes really just how far that program is reaching out but we know that many many countries have access and we also believe that through the internet and through YouTube and all of the different media formats that we have today that this ministry the gospel channel we're able to be a blessing to people that we may never meet on planet earth face to face and so today I just want to begin to talk to you I know we won't cover the subject today thoroughly but I'd like to lay a bit of a foundation and I want to talk to you about a series or a subject that I have called schemes and devices you know I believe that there is a literal heaven I believe that God has prepared a place for those of us who trust his grace and who live in surrender to the Scriptures I believe that I believe we who are born again filled with the Holy Spirit of God he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be there also and I don't believe that that is a imaginary place or it is a symbolic place I believe there is a literal dimension where God has built a home for those of us who trust him I believe it's not too late if you're watching this program and you have not yet trusted the Lord in real repentance for your sins the sins that Jesus has already died for shed his own blood for the remission of those sins but maybe you've not come to him asking for forgiveness and accepting his gift of salvation and if you've not done that yet now is your opportunity because there is a place prepared beyond this life the scripture said if in this life only we had hope we are of all men most miserable and I have to be honest and say that I enjoy life I enjoy living the Christ life even with the aches and the pains and the attacks and and and the heartaches that come along with everyday life but I enjoy serving the Lord you know I sing all the time it's been it's been a little tool that that I have used since I was just a small boy and sometimes when stuff is so you know haywire it just you feel like you're being pressed in the phone calls won't stop and the needs are great and you just don't know how to get through so sometimes I'll just start singing a song there was a song that was particularly a blessing to me many years ago when I was in I would say the darkest trial of my life it was an old hymn of the church some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood God leads his dear children along and he does he is faithful to lead us through so maybe I don't know why I said that maybe I said that for somebody who's watching this program right now and you're in a dark trial and you're thinking how I'm ever going to get through it why don't you just belt out a song you don't have to be a great singer the Bible said make a joyful noise and to the Lord well what will people think about me well they'll just have to deal with it you may not be able to do it if you're sitting at your desk at work but your family will just have to put up with you you know for many many years the Lord has given me a gift and that is I wake up every morning with those lyrics of a song running through my mind and you'd be surprised sometimes I will get out of bed and write the words of the song down just to little bit of it and you'd be surprised how many times through the day my mind goes back to that song and I think well that's the reason why that was on my heart you know the Bible talks about the Lord singing over us so I just believe that in every temptation in every dark trial in every situation that we go through the Lord offers us a way of escape oftentimes it's prayer oftentimes it is simply remembering and rehearsing the faithfulness of God so God has definitely provided various ways to help us get through the storms we can pray we can praise we can sing you know we can even dance I'm telling you there are times when the battle rages that it is not a bad idea just to dance before the Lord like the psalmist said you can do it right in your living room just throw up your hands and you know just dance a jig unto the Lord it's a way to praise Him it's a way to say my mind is going to be focused on you Lord no matter what's going on around me I may be distracted by my circumstances but I'm not going to be arrested by my circumstances I think one of the ways that we can overcome in this hour is to learn the ways that the enemy brings attack against us in our lives and so I want to begin this subject and you know I know that there's a lot of people who really they think if if we if we start examining the ways the enemy works that we're just kind of opening up our life or more attack but I don't look at it that way at all because the scriptures are clear we need to know what's going on and we need to be able to recognize what's happening is this just my emotions or is this a spiritual attack that I need to to be on the defense against that I need to do to go to prayer that I need to dig the word and overcome this situation you know the scripture talks about our adversary and how he operates and I'd like to look at a scripture with you in first Peter chapter 5 verse 7 and 8 and I know you're going to be familiar with these verses of Scripture casting all your care upon him that's easier said than done but all what relief what relief we can experience when we obey this verse of scripture casting all your care upon him for he careth for you the Amplified Bible takes verse 7 and translates it this way casting the whole of your care all your anxieties all your worries all your concerns once and for all on him hallelujah for he cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully can I read it again casting the whole of your care all your anxieties all your worries all your concerns once and for all on him for he cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully isn't that encouraging that he's inviting me to take all of my care my worry my anxiety my deep concerns and cast them this is a physical word cast them on him and I think that perhaps the writer used this word cast because it's not an automatic thing it's not just shaking ourselves and expecting that all of our worries are gonna fall off of us I think it's intentional I think it requires focus and intent to be able to wrap those cares anxieties worry troubles all up into one package and totally throw them on the shoulders of the Lord I believe that it's a powerful phrase here once and for all because I believe ultimately that's what we have to do but I've got a feeling that we're going to feel them again at times we're going to be reminded of them at times in fact we're gonna try to pick them up and carry them again even though we've given them to the Lord to bear the burden to carry the weight I have a feeling that as situations continue to squeeze we're gonna find ourselves again overthinking trying to sort it out even sometimes trying to tell God how to do it and we'll have to be reminded again perhaps by the Holy Spirit or maybe we will write these words on our bathroom mirror or on our refrigerator at least we need to hide them in our heart so that we can be reminded of them again his desire his love his care his concern for us compels him to want to carry every one of our cares I believe it's well placed the next verse in the King James the next verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour your adversary the enemy of your soul life the one who wants to ultimately cut you off from the goodness of God and because our enemy is full of intention full of purpose full of ambition he has a plan already calculated against us the scripture is admonishing us to be sober to be a word to be awake it's easy sometimes to fall into a place of complacency but in this hour we're living in the end time and the attack of Satan against the believer seemingly has intensified in this hour and there is no nap time spiritually there's no time to take a spiritual siesta we've got to stay awake and alert and watch for the ways that the enemy is moving against us in this hour remember this brother sister we do not face our enemy alone I have a feeling that in our own ability most of us would fall short being able to completely push back encounter the enemy but thanks be to God we're not doing it on our own it's not in our own power it's not using our own giftings or intelligence it's with the strength of the Lord the Amplified Bible takes verse 8 like this be well-balanced temperent sober of mind be vigilant and cautious at all times for that enemy of yours the devil roams around like a lion roaring in fierce hunger seeking someone to seize upon and devour thanks be to God though he cannot if we learn who our warrior is the Lord Himself will go to battle on our behalf if we get out of his way we put our trust in him we have to learn to take our hands off the situation sometimes you know there's a great temptation to be a problem solver in every situation I just want to fix it Lord just help me fix it but sometimes I'm operating out of my soul my mind my will my emotions and I'm not all operating out of the holy spirit that has transformed my human spirit he sits on the inside of the inside desiring to rule and reign through my soul and body and sometimes we get caught up in the swirl of what we're going through and again we're busy busy trying to sort it out and fix it telling everybody what to do and how to do you go there you do that you need to do the other when really it would be of our best interest to just let go sometime and let God give us leadership and guidance I don't know about you but I've experienced that so many times in my life and then looked back and thought to myself that's not how I would have handled it and look what a mess it would have been but because I trusted in the Lord I put my confidence in him I did everything I could to cast it on him and leave it there not pick it up and try to do it myself again and because of that often times I've been able to say blessed be the name of the Lord look how God moved in and took care of the situation and then back to the King James verse 9 first Peter 5:7 9 says whom resist that's that adversary who operates as a roaring lion now notice he's the counterfeit here because there is a lion there's a true lion in your life the Lion of the tribe of Judah don't you remember in Revelation chapter 5 when the the book is in the hand of the one who sat on the throne and a search was made in heaven for one who would be worthy to take that book and loosed the seven seals thereof and John was weeping the elders were weeping where where will there be one found and all of a sudden a voice cried out the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and from the midst of the throne appeared a lamb and I will want you to be fooled by that lamb that lamb was the sacrificial lamb but your lamb is a lion Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah our lamb is the lion he is the lion the Lion of the tribe of Judah and I'm telling you when things get really rough in your life and you surrender to him sometimes you're weeping and sobbing and just pouring it out before the Lord you just wait there are times that your lion looks down and sees what you're going through and he roars and I want you to know that when the lion the king of the jungle the natural lion when he roars I want you to know that everything in that jungle runs from the roar it shakes the jungle when the lion roars and you just wait until your lion the lion of the tribe of Judah wait until he roars into your situation breathes his spirit life into your situation watch and see if demons won't flee watch and see if they won't scatter watch and see if your situation won't begin to turn around because I'm telling you when the Lion of Judah roars the angels of God are dispatched from heavenly places to begin to move in unbelievable ways sometimes ways that we can't really see with our eyes but we can perceive in our spirit the angels of the Lord are moving I don't have to say that I don't believe in worshipping angels venerating angels looking up to angels but I want you to know I give thanks to God I'm not ashamed to tell you I give thanks to God today for holy angels that he has created to assist and serve the Saints I want to thank the Lord that he has angels that are commissioned to move when the children of God are crying out to him in prayer he said he would give his angels charge over us to watch over us and keep us lest we would even - our foot against a stone can I just tell you I'm getting pretty excited here can I just tell you that you're not alone in this fight you are not alone on this journey of life it's true you've got an enemy Satan is your adversary it's true that their demon spirits imps of hell that are dispatched against you from the kingdom of darkness but you are not alone and you are not facing the darkness alone you serve the only true Living God there is no other god but our God the God of the Bible the god that we call in English Jehovah I want you to know he is bigger than any name that we can give him any description that we can give him but he is the Lion of the tribe of Judah Lord I I ask you right now for those watching this program that seemed overwhelmed that feel overwhelmed by the darkness I'm asking you Lord to look upon them now see their heart see their life hear their hearts cry to you and I'm asking you according to your will would you please roar into that situation would you release your spirit life into that home right now where sickness has prevailed where bondage addiction has prevailed where depression has prevailed I'm asking you old great God roar against the enemy as you promised that you would we thank you for it Lord we thank you for it Lord again verse 9 tells us whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world that may be of little comfort to you right now but you're not the only one that has an X of painted on your life you're not the only one marked you're not the only one picked out to be picked on I want you to know that these afflictions are common to the lives of the children of God because there's a battle going on that's bigger than a political battle or a racial battle there's a battle that's going on in the heavenlies between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness between the one true Living God and his adversary I want you to know that when we boil all of this down the devil we always say you know he's our enemy he's our adversary but when we boil this down he is the adversary of God and I'm telling you he comes up short against the God that I know and yet he continues to rage and isn't it amazing that our God the one who has manifested himself as the Lion of the tribe of Judah his enemy operates as a roaring lion can you see that counterfeit can you see that imposter that impersonator why don't you call him out right now in your life why don't you recognize what he's trying to do he's trying to stand between you and the true lion of the tribe of Judah he's trying to distract you with his house but he is not the roaring lion he only operates as a roaring lion and we have this promise if we are steadfast in the faith we can rest assure we're not the only one going through this kind of a battle our brethren the saints of God around the world in every nation of the world we're all experiencing our portion of this warfare but I just like to tell the atmosphere Jesus Yeshua the Messiah is the victor he is the victory no matter what the battle is he is the victory we sometimes say and some people think it's kind of a corny statement but it still means a lot to me I've read the back of the book I know how this story ends I know how the enemy is bound I know the bottomless pit he tumbles in for a thousand years I know that he gets that second short little chance at the end where he's loosed a short time against the nation's but I also know that ultimately he is cast in to hell I also know that as a created being I don't want to upset your theology but I also know that as a created being there comes a time that he no longer exists so his time is limited he has an expiration date no wonder he moves with such fierceness no wonder he howls and moans and roars no wonder he throws every fiery dart and arrow against you that he possibly can but the purpose of what we're going to study is not to glorify the enemy it's not to exalt him but it's so that we might have understanding of how he operates and how we can walk in victory that has already been acquired for us it is not up to you and I to win the victory it's up to you and I to appropriate the victory Jesus is the victor Jesus is the Lamb who was found worthy to open up the book and reveal the whole plan of redemption the enemy is one player Satan Lucifer that old devil whatever you want to call him whatever name you want to give him Beelzebub Lord of the Flies whatever your your thought process is in giving him a name I came from old fashioned Pentecost and some of the old Saints would would call him souffl it I remember one preacher coming and he knew his name to be Lucifer and he preached all fifteen minutes of his sermon talking about how wicked Lucy was he'd just give him a nickname and called him Lucy well I want you to know that didn't go over too good you know why this was an evangelist preaching do you know what the pastor's mother-in-law's name was Lucy and so when that preacher was getting up and he was talking about how good-for-nothing Lucy was well everybody had a hard time to hold steady and not fall in the floor laughing because they knew that was the pastor's mother-in-law so I I advise you maybe to choose another more biblical name for the devil but whatever you call him he is defeated and he's just one little part of this whole economy of God I love what William Branham said a great healing evangelists and truly a prophet of God one generation ago he said Satan is a tool in the hand of God to perfect the Saints I love that it shrinks the enemy in my mind when I hear that statement when I recognize that he is only allowed to do what God decides he his power is limited and did you know that some of that power that we see the enemy operating in in fact is power that we have relinquished power that we have handed over to him because we didn't know how he was operating here's a scripture if perhaps you're thinking I don't want to hear two or three programs on the schemes and devices of the enemy I'd rather hear about the Lord well I think that's wonderful I'm gonna try my best to speak and teach and preach about the Lord in these programs but I here's the scripture to consider second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 lest seyton should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices if we are ignorant if we fail not to learn or to understand if we decide I'm going to pretend like the devil doesn't exist I'm going to shut my eyes and plug up my ears and I'm going to pretend like there is no devil I know there are people who don't believe that there's a literal Satan these are the same people who don't believe there's a literal hell and many of them don't believe there's a literal heaven and some of them they're not even sure that there's a literal God but I don't understand I'm honest and sincere when I say I don't understand how someone could look at creation even the human body and not believe that there is some divine creator there is an intelligence that is way beyond what we know as mankind a divine creator the Living God the God of the Bible who knows who sees and who understands the enemy again a piece of the plan a piece of the puzzle a part in the endtime drama but not the main focus however if we are not learning alert aware of how the enemy works then we are in a position where the enemy can get advantage or take advantage of us lest Satan should get an advantage of us we are not ignorant of his devices we must understand his schemes we must understand his seductions we must understand his devices do you remember the precious saint of God from the wonderful book and movie the hiding-place mrs. Corrie ten Boom do you remember her story do you remember how that her family was locked away in the concentration camps because they were hiding precious Jewish people from being exterminated and Bessey's father died in the concentration camp her sister Bessie died in the concentration camp other members of the family died in the concentration camp but by the grace of God Corrie survived and not only survived lived many years teaching a message of forgiveness going all over the world even helping in a movement to turn some of those concentration camps of Europe into beautiful homes of healing and help to care for the sick and for the elderly and she wrote some beautiful books some beautiful poetry sir beautiful stories I have several books written by Corrie ten Boom including part of her life travels her life story called a for the Lord and she said something about the enemy that I think's really really good and I'd like to share that with you she said it's a poor soldier indeed who does not recognize the enemy it's a poor soldier indeed who does not recognize the enemy I think that anyone who has ever read perhaps a book about war a book about military movements maybe the life story of a great general a great leader I think you would know that it's often mentioned that part of winning the battle part of winning the war is studying the enemy learning how he thinks how he operates you know the one thing we can thank God for about our enemy is he only has one bag of tricks and he may he may change the color of some he may change the characters in in the drama but really he does not have an endless what would you call supply he doesn't have an endless supply of ways to move against us in our lives in fact it's very limited there's nothing new under the heaven he just does the same thing that he's always been doing and really situations are different and again the actors and the drama are different sometimes it's our close family members that we love sometimes it's folks on our job it's all kinds of things you know and the enemy wants to get us focused on the on the people that are being used instead of the spirit the force that's behind that's the enemy again that's one of his tactics if he can get us focused on fighting one another then we're not fighting against him we're not pushing a back against the enemy and so Corrie ten Boom was helping us to know you if you're gonna if you're gonna defeat the enemy if you're gonna be a true soldier in the army of the Lord it's a good idea to know who your enemy is and how he operates because it's a given that we must know where our victory comes from it certainly comes from the Lord one thing that most of us have learned on our Christian journey is that Satan hates exposure he will go to any extreme to remain hidden in every situation and circumstance of our life and that's why he often has us focusing on how we were raised how we were brought up everybody's against us you know how wronged we have been and so we put names on it and we blame family members or bosses on our job or our people that wouldn't give us a chance and and what happens is the enemy just hiding in all those circumstances if you would recognize that we are not fighting flesh and blood we are not fighting one another but rat the principalities and powers spiritual wickedness in high places turn your attention against the enemy the true enemy pray to God cry out for help resist the enemy rebuke him use the Word of God against him if we would begin to do that shift our focus from the people involved and and the circumstances of the battle and put our focus on defeating the enemy through the blood through the word and through the name if we would do that we would begin to overcome I mean real overcoming power I truly believe that right now on planet Earth there is an elected remnant bride that we are being dressed in the spirit we are being dressed with the garments of the overcomer the fine linen of the saints which is the righteousness of God and as we yield more and more to the Lord in every circumstance of our life every test every trial every moment in the fiery furnace we are being raised up higher and higher and higher into him and so if the enemy can keep us you know occupied with all the little pieces and the details you know I don't know why I'm saying this but the enemy would like to get you hung up in the middle of he-said she-said remember what you did remember what you said remember how you acted back then you remember what what you that's his trick and then he just sort of sits over in the corner and we're mad at each other and we're not fighting the real enemy my god saints of God let's rally ourselves let's let's have our eyes open today let's begin to put the name of Jesus against that enemy and say you're defeated you filthy imposter you take your roaring somewhere else I'm calling on the line of the tribe of Judah I think most of you know of the great CS Lewis who wrote many many profound statements many profound books a lot of you are familiar with with the the Gauri's of of the narnia you know the the series about narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe etc I know that some Christians resist and they they don't completely understand the purpose of those books but I tell you there is a lot of truth that's that's hidden in that writing it was written that way for a purpose but I think a lot of you are familiar with the book that SIA CS Lewis wrote entitled the Screwtape Letters and in that book he said this Satan's cleverest trick is to convince the world that he does not exist I'm telling you that is simple and yet very very profound what a clever enemy he has convinced so many people that he doesn't exist I've heard many people say there's no real devil there's no real enemy that's just that's just the the nature of man is is there's evil in the very nature of man and that just comes out and that's why men hate and that's why men murder and that's why men kill well I want you to know there's truth to the Fallen nature of man absolutely but there is a driving force behind the Fallen nature of man there is an enemy who operates in hatred who operates in murder who operates in in jealousy and strife he operates that way and he anoints just like we know there is a true anointing from the Holy Ghost of God the enemy also anoints people influences people to operate on his behalf I want you to know the enemy will use anybody and everybody that's willing to be used he's not just using people in mass murders and in terrorism and so forth he'll use your loved ones he'll use people that love you people that you care about to bring attack to your life we're so quick to cut people out of our lives not recognizing that it's not flesh and blood we're fighting here it's something much much bigger than that and so here's this clever sneaky devil convincing people that he doesn't even exist by perpetuating this lie that there is no devil that he doesn't exist he's able many times to sneak up behind God's creation and whisper accusations that cost men and women to blame each other and to blame their circumstances instead of turning their their wrath against the one who is really responsible for what's going on the enemy so who is your enemy it's not people it's not your government it's not some political party your enemy was once a created cherubim that covereth he was once a part of heavens angelic hosts but now he is Satan and here are some scriptures that you can look at if you want to just put them down Isaiah 14 verses 12 through 14 Ephesians 6:12 2nd Peter 2:4 and Jude verse 6 we may look at some of these verses at another time but I thought you might want to have them and look over them for yourself though when we looked at Webster's dictionary concerning the word enemy it is defined as a hostile force or power that has destructive effects when we look at the word enemy that's used in our Bible the Hebrew word for enemy in the Old Testament can mean a foe an enemy one who is awake and that's that's evermore the reason why you and I have to be awake because the enemy is awake that's why we have to be watchful because the enemy is watchful he's not laying down doing nothing in this hour he is busy it also means from the Hebrew an adversary or a de-stressor one standing against or hating an observer or one who is critically watching and I guarantee you the enemy your enemy Satan the devil is critically watching your life he's waiting for you to manifest unbelief he's waiting for you to speak out of your mouth your own doubt he's waiting to take advantage of you in that vulnerable moment when you feel overwhelmed when you feel like you're not going to be able to press on and you begin to confess that you know in the south we have so many expressions and some of them we need to absolutely cut out of our vocabulary here in the in the southern part of the United States we say things and you say well that's just it is just an expression but because the Bible says there's a power there's life and death and the words I think we need to I know I let me just say me let me preach to me let me help help myself a little bit here we need to be more careful in the South when someone just say for instance their feet are hurting they'll say oh my feet are killing me all my head is killing me and I know it's just an expression and I know sometimes a headache and especially painful feet can make you feel near to death but that's not the truth your headache is not killing you it's not pleasant it's not something you want to welcome invite in your feet may be painful they may be sore you may feel like you need to sit down and rub them or soak them or whatever but they're not killing you there's power in your words I believe when we begin to recognize that our enemy is watching very critically very fervently critiquing watching waiting for you and I to express some bit of unbelief some bit of doubt in God in God's Word to agree he's constantly speaking lies into our lives and he's waiting most of the time the enemy come with a lie and we disagree we disagree no that's IIIi refuse that I reject that I will not come into agreement with that but when the pressure is on when the furnace is turned up seven times hotter in your life the enemy knows he keeps he keeps working hoping that you will be overwhelmed and that you will begin to confess with your mouth what what is stirring around in your emotions and in your soul life and you'll begin to confess with your mouth doubt in God's ability to get you through this thing I'm not going to make it I can't take listen here's one that we often say and maybe maybe even across the pond maybe you're watching this program and this is an expression that you would use you know I can't I'm not gonna make it I can't make it I can't take this anymore I just I won't be able to go on like this I want you to know that I understand and I can empathize with that kind of an emotion I can't take it anymore I can empathize with that thought with that feeling and with that emotion but I want you to know that is a lie of the devil a lie from your enemy you couldn't take it in the first place but greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world no matter how dark how hot how how pressure do you feel right now if in this moment of test you can cast this care on the Lord because he cares for you you will make it he will strengthen you he will undergird you he will encourage you and he will see you through so we have to keep reminding ourselves sometime who the enemy is and that he is watching and listening to every action and every word to catch us in that moment where we agree with him instead of the truth of God's Word because once that happens he gets the advantage he gets what we call the upper hand as long as you're standing on God's Word and confessing the truth of God's Word that enemy is shrunk in the situation he shrunk but when we agree with him I want you to know he just gets larger and larger and he takes more and more Liberty in our lives even in the army of god soldiers often will fight against each other churches against one another of people against one another even in the body of Christ and what we're doing when we're fighting each other instead of penetrating the enemy's camp to deliver hostages who are bound by the yoke of oppression and floundering in his hopeless den of darkness and what is the church doing fighting one another this is not a time to fight one another this is a time to stand together on the promises of God's Word there was a famous Indian chief in the history of the United States his name was Chief Joseph many people believed that he was a traitor to his own people because he made a league with the with the government of the United States to help bring the Indians into their into their places of reservation because there was such battles going on and we all know that the Native American people were treated very unfairly in the history of the United States we acknowledge that completely part of my heritage is from the tribe of the Cherokee Indians and and we know from history but there were many proud strong brave Indian tribes in America we couldn't say Native American tribes in this nation and they were strong they had strong leadership and many of them were hostile many of them carried out deeds that were we vicious but but many of them are fighting for survival their land was being taken etc and when Chief Joseph was appointed to to be a chief of the nations to be a representative of all of the different fragments of the Native American tribes he said this very important statement and it could also be said about the body of Christ unfortunately we were once a proud Braves strong people of many different tribes but United in in our desire to preserve but we fought too many insignificant Wars battles among ourselves so that when the real enemy came which in this case was the was the the pioneers and the American government and the founding of the new nation what they would eventually do to the Native American people when the real enemy came he said we were too weak to stand against the enemy and I'm telling you this is such a true statement it has become the truth also concerning the body of Christ that we have fought against one another instead of searching out the truth for ourselves we have held on to traditions that are anti word and fought those who desire to take us back to the word we have denominated ourselves divided ourselves and fought against one another until in many cases and in many places the body of Christ has spent more effort fighting each other so that we have allowed our enemy to set in the corner somewhere not realizing he's the one to blame if we're fighting one another then we're not fighting the real enemy I would just encourage you in this hour that we live in right now to recognize the schemes and devices of the devil stand strong in the power of God word pray for one another minister to one another realize that you are not going under if you're holding on to the strong hand of God we prayed spontaneously earlier in this in the program but let me just pray again just encourage you again with this prayer father in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ I thank you for every person watching this program right now and I ask that you would give them strength to stand against the real enemy of their soul may they not be distracted by the bickering of of one another may they not be caught up in the family feud's may they not be caught up in political arguments until the the real enemy is allowed to just overwhelm them and overpower them but may we each and every one by the revelation of the Spirit begin to recognize our enemy and turn the weapons that you have given us your word your blood your name may we turn those weapons against the one true enemy of the child of God and stand united in this hour because you O Lord are our victory we ask this grace and strength in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah I don't know about you but I feel strengthened by the Word of God today yes you've got an adversary as a roaring lion but you've got another lion on
