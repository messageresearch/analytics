Description:
The ‘Shout’ is the message calling the Bride together.  The Voice of the Archangel is the Voice of Christ, the Voice of the Resurrection, the Chief Cornerstone.  That vindicated Voice speaking the vindicated Word is the same Voice that will call the Bride forth out of the grave.  His Voice, the Voice that called Lazarus out of the grave.  It is the Voice of Jesus, also the Voice of the eternal Spirit of the Father.  Jehovah of the Old is the Lord Jesus Christ of the New Testament.
