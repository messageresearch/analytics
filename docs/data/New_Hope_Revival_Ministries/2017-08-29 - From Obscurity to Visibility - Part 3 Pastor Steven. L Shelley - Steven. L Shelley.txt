TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they shall smile reasonable praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I welcome you to the broadcast today and I hope that something has been said in a previous broadcast that's encouraged you to go on to keep on keepin on for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and if this is the first time that you've seen the Eagles cry then I pray that something will be said today that will be a help or an encouragement to you in your life I want you to know the whole theme of this ministry as Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever you see I just simply believe that Jesus is exactly today what he was yesterday and tomorrow he's going to be exactly the same he changes not his word is true what he was able to do to perform on the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago I believe he's able to do that and even greater you say well how could he do greater because he tells us in his word that greater works than this shall you do those who follow his disciples the believers those who trust in his saving and keeping power and I'm glad to say I'm one of them I realized that this program goes into places where there are many cultures many religions many faiths and I honor you where you are I honor you and thank you for watching this program but I want to I just have to submit to you with all love and respect I have to share with you the faith that's in my heart and that is that Jesus Christ Yeshua is the only way I really believe that he has come into this world to redeem us back to our Father back to where it was that we should be in the mind of God way back from the foundation of the world old I believe God had a plan and that plan is being carried out in our lives in this hour so I just want to encourage you dig dig a little deeper if you don't know the Lord Jesus if you don't follow him I'm not advertising the church the church because the church is full of men and women the church is flawed so I'm not here trying to present to you that the church is perfect but I'll tell you our Savior is perfect and he is working a work of perfection in those of us who follow him closely by the leadership of the Holy Spirit and so I just want to encourage you to dig a little bit pray a little bit read a little bit and see if perhaps the light of the gospel will shine into your life and give you joy and then I know that there are multitudes of people who follow the Lord Jesus and watch this program and I want to be able to encourage you too because we're coming in as the body of Christ as the bride of Messiah we're coming in to the greatest days of our lives our ministries our callings our destinies oh we're being launched I believe that with every fiber of my being so I welcome you again to this program and I want to encourage you to visit our website its revival dot o-r-g there's lots of wonderful resources available to you to bless you to equip you to encourage you on your journey for the Lord at our website you can also send us a letter or even phone call your prayer request in and we'll be more than happy to pray with you I believe in the power of prayer I believe in the power of agreement and it's my joy to agree with you over your requests just be faithful and let us know when the answer comes we're getting praise reports already some have been remarkable about how God is healed and how God is delivered and so if you send in a prayer request and God moves let us know what's happening we want to share if we share with your burden we want to share with your joy amen and so stay in touch with us and if God should lay on your heart to partner with us financially on a monthly basis to help us continue to do what we're doing and expand then there are many ways that you can do that and one of them the easiest one perhaps is through the website so you can go there and find out about our partner link and how that works but I want to get right into the Word of God today we're in a little series that we're in titling from obscurity to visibility alright and we're in I say a chapter 58 and I'm not going to go back and read all the previous verses that we've read and enjoyed all along the way to get us to where we are today but I will read verse 10 and verse 11 I think we were moving into 10 and 11 the last time we were together I say a 58 and 10 and if thou wilt and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday hey something's going on there's a transformation in this promise and I think one of the most important keys to what God is saying here through the Prophet I say is very simply stated bloom where you're planted use the authority that God has given you in the arena in the area where you've been called the minister use that to the fullest it's like God said to Moses hey what is that in your hand and and more it's a rod Moses said it's a rod and God said that's exactly what I'm going to use to deliver my people and so I believe essentially that God has already sewn into us planted in us what we need the equipment that we're going to need to spiritually fulfill and walk out our destiny it's in us but sometimes we're hoping and believing for the greater things and we step right over the present will of God the will of God for today in our lives what would God have you to do now what is he called you to do now what doors has he opened for you now be faithful in those doors be faithful in that level of ministry and then believe God for expansion I believe it's very important to be faithful because he says that if we are faithful over the few things he's going to make us ruler he's going to give us dominion over many things Chuck Pierce who is a prophetic voice in America has described this new year on the Jewish calendar we're already there now 57 68 and as we're in this year he said that one of the spiritual significant truths 457 68 is the word Dominion God wants to bring his people into a new level of authority and Dominion and somebody said dominion over what well we need to take authority and dominion over the Prince of the power of the air over demonic spirits in the second heaven we need to come against by the authority of Jesus Christ the oppressive demonic spirits of Hell that are holding back our loved ones that are attacking and controlling our neighbors I mean we need to be able to stand in the authority of God speak the word amen and watch God perform his promise hey God has never given us a reason to think that he will not be faithful in fact the the opposite is true God's track record is perfect it's absolutely perfect everything he said he was going to do he has done so we have no reason to doubt that he's going to do the things yet in the future that he has promised so let's do what we can now while we are believing God for even bigger and greater things I like this phrase then shall thy light rise in obscurity now that word obscurity is an interesting word in the Hebrew language it means a lack of clearness a lack of clarity we're talking about something that's a little bit fuzzy or a little bit blurry do you understand what I mean something that is a little bit difficult to be understood it also means the condition of being unknown if something is obscure it's unknown if someone is obscure they're relatively unknown it also can mean a little-known person or place it can also mean darkness or shade so God says I'm going to let your light rise in obscurity so there's many many spiritual applications using the root meaning of that word obscurity if God says I'm gonna let your light rise in obscurity let's go back and make sure of how its worded then shall thy light rise in obscurity then what is God saying well one thing he's saying is you have had a lack of clarity and I know that that has been true in my own spiritual life there have been times that the words on the page were blurry so to speak I couldn't quite discern the mind of God I couldn't quite discern the will the perfect will of God now I know this is old teaching but it's still right God has a perfect will and plan the highest order is God's perfect will but he asks what we have come to call a permissive will he will sometimes allow us to do certain things that may not have been in his original plan for us but he loves us and we therefore find ourselves in the permitted wheel or the permissive will of God God is allowing it but I find out have found out and continue to find out that the highest blessing it's not in being in God's permissive will or what he will permit me or allow me to do but if I am expecting and believing for the highest blessing the highest level of anointing and authority then I need to contend I need to do to fight for the perfect will of God the perfect mind of God and so one of the promises that I'm claiming in this new season of the Lord is that the blurriness of my understanding that it would become clear that there would be no issue with hearing the clear voice of God is that also your desire I think it is I think we can claim the promise of the Old Testament where the prophet of God said that there should be a we let it let our clarity be like this that that we could hear a voice behind us saying this is the way walk ye in it now I don't mean to sound dumb but I feel sometimes like I really need God to draw it out very plain hey you this is the way to walk get in it this is what I would have you to do get in it and okay that's alright you know I don't mind confessing to you that I need some time but the leadership to be that clear my understanding can get blurry and especially if we if we don't spend enough time developing our devotional life if we're not praying enough if we're not feeding our spirit man enough on the Word of God you see a lot of times we feed our soul the soulish part of man but we're not feeding the spiritual part of man and so at the deepest level you are a spirit man and that spirit man has to be fed and if we're not doing that then our life is suffering devotionally our spirit is suffering and so it can become increasingly more difficult to have a clear word from the Lord so we need to hone in we need to sharpen up our skills and we need to present ourselves to the Lord and then we can stand on this word and say hey Lord I need my light to rise in obscurity I need more clearness I want to get rid of this difficulty in being able to understand what you're trying to show me in your word or what you're trying to reveal to me about my next step what you would have me to do I need the divine clear plain leadership of the Lord and let's face it sometimes he speaks like a trumpet but other times he speaks in a still small voice I want and I believe that's also your desire to have enough sensitivity in the spirit that we can discern not only the trumpet voice of God but that we can also know and have grace to obey the still small voice of God also I believe this condition of being unknown I believe that the greatest players in this next move of God the the you know I hate to say it that way I hate to say the greatest vessels are the greatest instruments because we need to understand there are no big eyes and little use in the kingdom of God you know sometimes we think oh there's a few chief people a few key and there are often times key men and women that God uses for specific purposes but we all have greatness in us because we have Jesus in us when you have the Holy Spirit in you you have the spirit of excellence and you have the spirit of greatness and we want to develop that and the way to develop this in in our lives the way to develop greatness the way to develop excellence is through obedience by obeying him and remember we want to obey Him in the little things we want to be sensitive to obey in the little things so that we can be trusted even with the bigger things what I believe God's going to do though is he's going to bring unknown men and women yo Bob Jones who is also great prophetic voice in America had a visitation I've I think I've referred to it before here on the Eagles cry where he had a visitation from a group of angels one of the Angels the the most significant of the angel as far as the one who spoke was breakthrough and he had this great visitation but the rest of these guys I think maybe there were 11 other angelic beings that came to him in this visitation and they would have hardly been recognized as angels they were dressed in ordinary street clothes slightly different styles different body you know some big some small some tall skinny fat whatever short and that was one of the things that was spiritually significant in this visitation was they were ordinary how ordinary they were God is about to use ordinary people in a very unordinary way he's about to use some very natural people in a very supernatural way that's God it's not only God it's his track record I mean you look at the men and women that we would call heroes of the Bible or heroes of the revivals of the past centuries and they were very ordinary men and women I mean their lives were simple and poor and uneducated in most cases until God elevated them so don't give up on the fact that God is going to do great things in your life because we're going to experience new seasons of acceleration and elevation we're going to see God bringing us out of this place of obscurity he's kind of hidden a lot of people he's hidden a lot of people in the cocoon like the caterpillar he's hidden a lot of people in that cocoon so that he could transform us by the spirit of change and you know change is not comfort say men change it's not comfortable but that's what God sins change for to make us uncomfortable to move us out of our present comfort zone to stretch us you know what I've been saying about stretching God stretching us lately that's a good thing because the the bigger he stretches us the it increases our capacity for him and if I'm going to be stretched to a big vessel I wanna I want to be big enough to contain more of God that's what we're after that's what we're hungry for more of you Lord more of your spirit more of your leadership and so this great change this metamorphosis that's taking place there's a lot in this phrase then shall your light rise in obscurity God says I'm not only going to give you a clearness I'm gonna take away some of that difficulty that you have had in understanding my voice and in understanding my will but I'm also going to take you from that little unknown secret place and I'm gonna launch you forth into your community into your nation into the world to do something for me I'm gonna bring you out of the shadows and into the light because there's an unveiling remember the experience I think we shared with you that God gave me some months ago and the final announcement that was given as I saw all of this beautiful fruit coming quickly to maturity it started off as just a sort of a bear and piece of land but immediately after it had had risen up out of the of the ocean what looked like the ocean I saw little blades of grass and then quickly I saw shrubs and then trees appear and then very very quickly leaves and blooms and fruit buds and fruit luscious mature fruit and I said what is this and the voice said this is the revealing of the sons of the kingdom God said I'm getting ready to reveal my sons getting ready hallelujah to bring my son's out of obscurity into visibility I'm going to show this old wicked world what I meaning the Spirit of Truth the Spirit of God what I can accomplish through my sons and when we say sons we mean sons and daughters because this thing that we're talking about now is genderless and it goes back to that age-old thing we preach a lot about the sons of God the sons of the kingdom we preach a lot about the Bride of Christ and women may struggle just as much being a son of God as men may struggle being a Bride of Christ and the fact of the matter is we need to quit struggling about all of it because if God says I'm gonna be his bride I'm ready I want that and if God says I'm gonna be a son and my wife is gonna be a son of God then she desires that that's what she wants so you know when I'm preaching on the bridal message I often say to the brothers you you know you need to lay down some of your ego and and this overly macho thing that you got going on where you struggle with the concept of being with the Lord Jesus being his bride being his wife because the Bible talks about the Lambs wife and how she has made herself ready don't trip yourself on vocabulary just get in there and ask the Lord to let it manifest in you amen a lot of people trip over the trappings they trip over the vocabulary and what we need to be doing is we need to be on our faces before God saying lord help me to come into that place where I can manifest that I'm your son help me to come into that place where I can bring forth the manifestation and the proof and the token that I am your bride that I have been with you in the Hupa in the Holy of Holies in the secret chamber the bridal chamber of the Lord we want to be able to come forth with the character of Jesus Christ and so don't stumble over vocabulary get in there and get what you can okay God said I'm going to let your light rise and obscurity and your darkness be as the noonday Oh some years ago God just spoke very sweetly very plainly in our ministry and he said I'm gonna bring you from obscurity to visibility so that's when I started pondering on these scriptures looking up these definitions so we know what obscurity means they mean I think I have enough time I can read it again a lack of clarity or clearness difficulty in being understood and you know that works both ways because we want God we want to be able to understand what God is saying we want to be able to understand his voice we want to be able to discern his will but also the enemy wants to muscle us he wants to tie our tongue and he wants us not to be able to articulate and to express you know that's one of the weaknesses of my life that I have before the Lord often I often come to the Lord and say Lord I lay before you my inability to express what you give me I know what you give me is right I know what you give me is real and I know it's powerful but I feel sometimes so inadequate in so weak in having the gifting to be able to express it and to articulate it so this word is big if God says I'm gonna bring you from obscurity to visibility he's not only saying I'm gonna give you a greater understanding to know my voice to know my will but perhaps he's also saying I'm gonna give you a greater anointing and a greater gifting to express with clarity what I'm giving you oh I like that I claim that one I need that one and perhaps you're listening and you need that one as well and then also it means the condition of being unknown or relatively unknown a place or even a person who is sort of in the shadow or in the darkness and God said I'm gonna bring I've got some real champions Oh hallelujah my fealty anointing I've got some real dread champions that I've been working on behind the veil underneath the covering in the secret chamber in the closet I've been working on some real dread champions and I'm getting ready hallelujah to open the door and kick them out I'm gonna push them fourth I'm going to launch them as forerunners hallelujah to establish the kingdom of Jesus Christ in the earth what are they going to do they're going to give sight to the blind they're going to raise the dead they're going to cleanse the lepers they're going to cost the lame to get up and walk again they're going to speak words of deliverance that will set the captives free break every heavy yoke and every burden the dread champions of the Lord are arising the sons of the kingdom are arising this Bridal company is arising this company of doves this company of eagles all of this spiritual vocabulary that God's been sending in this hour to help us to express to us what he wants to do through us and before you can do anything through us we have to let him do some big stuff in us now in closing the definition of visibility is the condition or quality of being distinct distinguishable visible the capability of being seen so God said I'm gonna bring you out into a into a spotlight now don't let that go to your head and get puffed up with pride and get boastful that's not what God's saying he's just saying what I'm doing for you in secret what I'm doing for you in your prayer time what I'm doing for you behind the scenes and you feel so discouraged sometime because you haven't accomplished as much as you'd like to accomplish in ministry everything you've been going through from the day you were born until now was preparation God is preparing us Oh hallelujah he's preparing us building us shaping us molding us making us to the image conforming us to His image so that we can go forth work the works of God get this thing done get it over with and go home I mean who loves this world enough to want to stick around here for any period of time we want to get out of this old pest house we want to get home we want to go back to our heavenly home we want to go back to the place that God has created for us in the beginning but before we do that we got to get some work done so I'm asking the Lord right now to anoint you to see clearly to hear clearly to articulate clearly I'm asking the Lord to accelerate the bringing you forth to bring you forth out of the darkness out of obscurity into visibility into the light and Lord we just ask for a release of maturity on the body of Christ let us grow up quickly because we know that we're not yet to that stature where you've called us to be so help us Lord to grow up quickly and we release healing because we know healing is the children's bread so father right now just touch your people in the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen any man we love you contact us if you get the chance thank you for watching and I hope you'll tune in again to the Eagles cry god bless you bye bye for now you
