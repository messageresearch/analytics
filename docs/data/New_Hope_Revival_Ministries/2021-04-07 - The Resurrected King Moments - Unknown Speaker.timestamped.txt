[0:00] there's a king who's sitting on the
[0:02] throne
[0:04] [Music]
[0:12] you as an attribute of god you are
[0:15] you are stamped with who he is
[0:21] that's the seed you
[0:24] came here with a fingerprint
[0:28] you came here with the thumbprint of who
[0:31] he is
[0:33] even in your fallen nature you came here
[0:37] as an attribute an extension a
[0:39] reflection
[0:41] of who he is and what he likes and what
[0:43] he prefers
[0:44] and what he cares about and what he
[0:46] thinks about you were
[0:47] already here representing some of that
[0:50] you just didn't know it
[0:52] now that's not all we were because we
[0:54] came here with a fallen nature
[0:56] and so we were much quicker to manifest
[1:00] the fallen nature
[1:01] than we were the seed that was within us
[1:04] anybody with me
[1:05] and that's where the battle begins oh it
[1:08] begins and it's an
[1:09] awful battle and how many of you know
[1:11] it's still rages today
[1:13] there's a battle still going on between
[1:15] the spirit and soul of man
[1:17] striving to do what's right and when i
[1:20] want to do what's right wrong is present
[1:22] and
[1:22] i try to oh it's just all wretched man
[1:26] that i am who can deliver me i tell you
[1:28] who can deliver you
[1:30] the resurrected king the resurrected
[1:34] king
[1:34] who desires to rule and reign from the
[1:37] throne
[1:38] of your life from your spirit he desires
[1:42] to move out of you to move through you
[1:44] to move out of you
[1:46] to reflect himself and not who you are
[1:50] because that fallen nature it has to die
[1:54] everything the flesh desires has to die
[1:56] everything the soul man would like
[1:59] has to die and only who he is i'm
[2:02] telling you it may look like an
[2:03] impossible task
[2:04] except for one thing there's a king
[2:08] i want to look at you there's a king
[2:13] there's a king who's sitting on the
[2:16] throne
[2:18] if it was up to me to get holy i
[2:20] couldn't get holy if it was up to me to
[2:22] get righteous
[2:23] i couldn't get righteous i if i had to
[2:26] get perfect in myself and complete in
[2:28] myself
[2:29] i would not have what it takes but
[2:31] remember church
[2:32] there's a king who's sitting in here
[2:35] hallelujah
[2:36] and he already saw exactly what it's
[2:39] going to take
[2:40] to bring us into the perfect reflection
[2:43] of his image
