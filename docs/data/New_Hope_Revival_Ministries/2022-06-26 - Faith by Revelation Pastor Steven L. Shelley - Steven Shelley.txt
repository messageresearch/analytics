the lord today we want to remember michael christian to the lord he's hurt his back on his job we want to ask the lord to touch him and also crystalline we want to ask the lord to help her ginger sent a request this morning for brother simrock in tucson she has a lot of fond memories of him as her teacher in the second through the fourth grade from what i can tell from this text he's at the er he felt this morning his blood pressure and oxygen low and he's dehydrated and he has developed pneumonia so let's remember this brother simrock in tucson let's ask the lord to touch him was on my heart this morning you mentioned that already your dad if you'll give a little report about your dad so that we can pray for him and then all of those traveling this week some by airplanes some by car far as i know i've only heard from a couple of them of course i know everyone who has left for texas so far has arrived safely without any problems yes amen chad will you come and pray over these requests while you're coming i'll just give you a quick report about dad uh daddy is home the uh they were very pleased with what they saw concerning no more bacteria growing and so we're so very thankful for that they took him before he went home the hospital where he's at is two hours away from where they live so they took him to have this infusion this antibiotic confusion so that mom doesn't have to administer through the picc line every day so they're very thankful for that so in 10 days he has to go back to kingsport tennessee to have another infusion of this antibiotic treatment but he is home last night was a better night than the night before so we're very grateful for that would you remember him and his church today he's um i know that it bothers him very much to not be able to be a pastor but one of the brothers in his church has passed uh and uh yesterday morning and so that's another weight on him that i know it's weighing heavy because he can't do anything about it he can't minister at the funeral he can't go to the family because dad has been a goer he he goes all the time but he's confined to home so would you remember that church family to the lord sister veronica keith is is the widow um i know she is hurting but at the same time relieved because her husband's been suffering dementia for a couple of years and he had become a little bit violent and it was very difficult for her and her family so would you remember that family this morning i also had an old friend from the valley from the freedonia community holiness church i've known them my whole life and her husband passed away yesterday from a brain tumor he had had some ups and downs along the way they were married to 51 years i think it was and her name is sister angie and uh literally i've known her my whole life i'd like for her to be lifted up to the lord in prayer today let's pray this morning thank you jesus father we love you god and we thank you for the privilege the opportunity to be gathered again in your name we thank you lord for the presence that's in this house this morning god we thank you for the favor that you've given upon us and the ones that have traveled already lord thank you for your protection that has surrounded all that i've already gone lord we ask that you would come and surround us as we will leave this week let your angels just line the highways god give us divine appointments on the way that we could be a light to those that we come in contact with lord let us when we walk into the rooms let the atmospheres change god everyone that we meet lord everyone we speak to let them see you in us oh god father we ask the lord that you would continue to be with us in the remainder of this service i ask you meet every need that was represented here this morning it was mentioned out loud heal those that are hurting in their bodies god papa greely would you go and touch him lord surround him with your presence father lord how it must be uh somewhat painful to not be able to be there to minister to your sheep lord a shepherd has to be there to minister but god i pray that you would strengthen him surround him with your presence and your love o god we thank you for all the blessings that you've given to us in our lives we ask you again that you would just be with us and remain in this service and have your perfect will in your perfect way in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen hallelujah praise the lord you may have your seats today we're certainly happy to see you in the house of the lord each one we are so glad that you are here my wife and i are glad to be here the presence of the lord to all of you that are watching this service by way of the stream today we greet you in the name of the lord and we're glad that you've tuned in to be a part of this service god is faithful faithful he is we're going to call on brother daniel and sister anna miller to come and sing this morning while they're getting ready nathan would you come and brother austin hodges we're going to let these two brothers come to you for the tithe and offering let's just pray over it before they come to you today father i want to thank you that you continue to supply every need we just honor you because we know you are the source in the supply now lord as we give of our tithe and our offering today we ask that it would be blessed and multiplied for the purposes of the kingdom may there be a witness lord of how that you pour your blessing back into the homes of the believers we give you glory and honor for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen the lord bless you as you give to the lord today just want to report 226 583 dollars and four cents as of today given toward the mortgage of this property the principal we're so grateful for that i have been waffling back and forth what to do because the first sunday we're back together after we're all gone we'll be together on that tuesday night july the 5th but when we're back together on uh july the 10th then that would be the first sunday we're back together for the principal and i'm back and forth about what to do so i'll try to keep you updated about that because i know there's a lot of expense in travel and so forth but i also know when you get momentum you don't want to lose it and so uh i i'm leaning more toward whatever you can give we don't want you to go in debt for it we don't want you to have to carry credit card expense or anything like that but perhaps we can still come and give an offering maybe it'd be a little bit smaller maybe a bit a lot bigger god knows how to provide so i'm leaning toward receiving that offering on the 10th you got off okay [Music] where do i go when there's nobody else to turn to and who do i talk to when nobody wants to listen who do i lean on when there's no foundation stable i go to the rock i know he [Music] well i is to the rock of my salvation i run to the stone at the building i run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me [Applause] when earth [Music] when the storms of life are raging who do i turn to when the winds of sorrow blow is there a refuge in the time of tribulation i go to the rock i go to the rock of my salvation i run to the stone the builders reject it run [Music] when i need a friend i go to the rock y'all mind if we practice that one more time

consolation i go to the rock i go to the rock of my salvage i go to the stone that the builders reject i run to the mountain and the mountain he stands by me when earth all around me is sinking sand

back together be a lot of traveling we want to just cover one another in prayer and believe that the lord will take us to our destinations and bring us safely back home that he will watch over and protect each one [Music] the disciples were getting concerned the wind started violently [Music] and we're so afraid but jesus rose when they called him and said to them where is your faith [Music] oh

name hallelujah praise the living god you may be seated this morning for a few moments it's wonderful to be in the presence of the lord we appreciate brother miller helping us out in the guitar we appreciate joseph helping us on the drums we were running we thought on a skeleton crew but look what happens you just pulled together and we had good special singing and we had good worship today with ben leading us and we're well we've got some empty pews but we do on occasion anyway so we're doing all right i did a quick scan and counted 68 people and you know how in your mind you get you get to thinking well that one's gone and that one's gone and that one's gone and you think well there there'll be about 20 of us well we did better than that didn't we amen i'm thankful for you being here and the most important thing is jesus is here well how do you know that because not just because i feel him but because i brought him with me and even if i didn't feel him that doesn't mean he wouldn't be here it's not by feelings it's by what we know about his promise it's about his faithfulness to us so real quick we'll leave the musicians where they are for just a moment in case we should need them but we will make some quick announcements and uh we will move forward brother greeley has already mentioned to you there will be no service here tuesday night or next sunday morning and i would ask that the brethren would prepare a sign for the door in case some people don't follow our services by social media they would be able to come and see and that's nothing that we want to do it's nothing that we like doing but we're in a circumstance this time where we really need to do it that way uh if you would like a suggestion for a message to hear next sunday if you're looking for a suggestion i would like to give you the suggestion of the sermon blasphemous names and um i can give you the the address of that if you want to jot it down you don't have to listen to that on sunday you can listen to it during the week it's 1962. it is november the 4th in the morning of 1962 blasphemius names and it was preached in jeffersonville indiana and uh but you i don't know how long the tape is i didn't look to see how long it was so you might want to hear some of it during the week but the reason why i'm suggesting it is because i found some quotations that i will use this morning from that sermon that struck me in a way uh that they have never struck me before and i'm very curious now to go back myself and hear the entire message we focus on the theme of the message and he was using the importance of meeting in the name of jesus and how that churches will name themselves after after jesus without having any real revelation of who he is he said well that's just like blasphemous names mentioned in the book of the revelation but he was also speaking a little bit about the stature of the perfect man and he was talking about their being we know there's more than one kind of faith i'm going to preach about that this morning but he was talking about all the virtues and he was mentioning that there are two kinds of each of these virtues they can be produced in the earth earthy and they're all right they're virtues they're good things it's good to have mental faith it's good to have it that's where all faith starts but he said when that that is above that faith that is above when it comes down i'm about to preach now he said when that comes down and and meets your faith your carnal your let's say mental or intellectual faith when it comes down and meets that he said then you've got the faith that you've got to have for the sealing of the bride and boy that answered something for me i know i've heard that but it just it just really stuck out and i regretted that i didn't have more time yesterday to go and get the whole thing i would like to listen to all of it so i thought well i'll mention you you might go and get over just listen to all of it it's good but when you get over that part you might pay special attention because if it spoke out to me like that maybe it will do the same for you so that is this tuesday and the following sunday and then as brother greeley mentioned we'll be back together on the on tuesday evening july the 5th and uh we have a few uh events this week or things to remember and one is that kendra and ben are having a wedding anniversary on monday uh how many years is it now nine years well in that wonderful praise god they made it nine years i remember it like it was yesterday i i it their their their wedding had a profound impact on me and i don't know why well i was just glad they were married i was tired of trying to keep them apart and i was just glad they were married and they could smooch and do whatever it is they needed to do but it it got me i felt so emotional in all of that i don't know why it was almost like my own children growing up for something to be married and and i they were getting ready to go away on their honeymoon and i uh slipped a little money in his poc and i sobbed i stood on the porch as they're driving off and everybody else including the family is so happy rejoicing just so glad to have it done and i am just sobbing the tears are just i said i don't even know what's wrong with me i don't even know why i'm crying but it just had an impact on me and maybe the lord was showing us that they were going to have beautiful children that would be an important part of our lives and i don't know what it was but i will never forget it so happy anniversary and i pray that there's not a repeat performance of my emotions this week i pray that i can keep all of it together i don't want to be standing on the porch saying i don't know i'm crying nothing manly about that right but anyway uh happy anniversary to them and uh on tuesday of this week sister elita's daughter angela has a birthday and she still means so much to us even though they're not with us in service they mean a lot to us and we want to pray for them and her especially on her birthday and on that same day uh brother garvis and sister pam have a wedding anniversary so we'll send out a sister flo can tell them that we greeted them on their birthday uh sis on their anniversary sister uh my wife has been talking to sister green a little bit this week and um she's slowing down a bit and we'd like to see her lift it up to the lord in prayer today perhaps streaming this service and uh i try to reach out to her when i can on on july the 1st because that was brother green's birthday and uh that would be on friday of this week we can't help but think about that and then the next day the second saturday two sisters in the church have a birthday sister elita has a birthday and sister jeffrey has a birthday on saturday so let's say happy birthday they're sitting right in front of one another they're birthday sisters [Applause] and uh someone reached out to remind me that we wouldn't be here next sunday so i should mention that that on monday the 4th is independence day that is also sister beverly skipworth's birthday so we say happy birthday to her also sister kendra's birthday she wanted to get married uh her for her birthday i reckon because her birthday is on tuesday the fifth of july and uh you don't have to tell us your age we know you're creeping on up there and brother david gossman a very faithful streamer his birthday is also that day i'm hurrying i'm hurrying trying to get it all in i wasn't thinking about the week of being gone and on thursday of that week sister audrey has a birthday we can't miss wishing her a happy birthday on the 7th of july and i believe that will do us until until we get back on that sunday july the 10th if you uh know of a birthday and anniversary that i missed you want to call it out i like to mention these when we can all right it's not on purpose i have three or four calendars here and they don't always sync together so i i miss that sometime uh let's get ready for the word let's thank god for the musicians i think they have worked faithful and we will dismiss them to go let's stand together as i said earlier we have quite a few people that have already made the journey to texas and uh have gone with safety and a lot of them left in the night and they traveled they had kids i guess some of them and and found it better to go in the night and get there early in the morning and and uh they said some of them weren't all that tired they just went and enjoyed their day the next day i'd have been having to go to bed myself but uh others leaving this week we appreciate your prayers for safety for benjamin and jenna jenna especially and her family who still have i'm sure many things to do to have ready for the wedding on thursday evening let me mention to those of you who have asked i've had i don't know over a dozen texts already asking about being able to view this the service the wedding and what time is the wedding honey thursday uh 6 central so 6 central on thursday which is 7 o'clock thursday night here eastern time and we will try to let you know if you watch if you keep up with facebook we will try to let you know it is our intention brother hawk is carrying equipment hoping that there is an internet signal there strong enough to be able to if not then we will try to get someone to facebook live on their phone and use their phone signal but this is in midlothian texas and i don't know how close it is to town i'm i'm not sure exactly i don't know anything about the area so we will get the word back to you and if there's someone here you know is not on facebook and wouldn't be able to see and they'd be interested in knowing maybe you'll help me get the word around but one way or the other god willing if there is signal we will either be streaming through our normal platforms using the laptop or a facebook live and we would be blessed if you were able to join us and again to all of the streamers i tell you we have a host of streamers today and quite a few a precious people from newfoundland who are streaming today some for their very first time god bless each and every one of you and i have great fond memories of my time in newfoundland and many of the saints that i worshipped with back then are already in the presence of the lord so it's so wonderful to make the acquaintance of others and there are quite a few prayer requests here and we will go over each of these prayer requests and we will pray with you and join our faith with yours no matter where you're watching across this country canada uh israel trinidad south africa friends in tucson in ghana in kenya and that's just on facebook it goes on let me take just a moment here and um and mention that there are saints netherlands god bless all of you in the netherlands several groups there um [Music] british columbia i'm sure it's a little cooler there than it is here god bless all of you united kingdom god bless the gillards there wonderful thank you for being with us and may god just meet needs that are represented by those names are you ready for the word genesis chapter 4 beginning in verse 1. i need a little time and i need you to help me pull i just believe god will help us a little bit today you may think when you listen to this that we are leaving our our theme of deliverance but we're not we're just taking a little little side trip here because we're learning again that everything that god gives us it comes to us by revelation and even deliverance is a revelation not a feeling not a feeling deliverance is a revelation once you get it once you get a revelation i've been freed then it manifests because your thoughts are shifted your behavior shifts your worship goes up to another level because you got more to praise god for he set you free now let me ask you are there any people here today that god has i don't just mean from the from the thought concept of sin but i mean from the real attributes of unbelief is there anybody here that can say i've been set free from some stuff god has delivered me from some things in my life and so these are real living live testimonies of god's power to deliver and it came of course there were probably hands laid on some of you and prayers made over some of you but all of that was just to get you to a place where you could open up your heart of faith and receive the revelation of what christ had already done for you he'd already done it if you're ever going to be delivered you always were he already paid the price hallelujah genesis 4 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear came and said i have gotten a man from the lord all life comes from the lord this is not telling us who the father was it's telling us where life comes from amen life comes from the lord from god and so the life that was enabled came from god the life that was in cain the breath that was in cain came from god right we read on and she again bore his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground we're going to read all the way down to verse 8. and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect now just for future reference i want you to think about he neither respected the man this is unusual language yes god neither respected the man or the offering that he brought so god's problem was not just with the offering the problem was also with the man he said but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell so he got mad and then he got depressed you ever had that happen to you all right at least you're honest and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth what have you got to be mad about and why is thy countenance fallen why why'd you got your pouty face on he said if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him interesting language i wished i had time to talk about it and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him now god did not respect cain because he saw something in cain that was not of him amen he recognized that there was a seed in him that was not a seed of god now that's that's an origin that's an origin thing that goes all the way back to his conception and god was was was you know not confused about this situation he knew very well what was going on and he recognized if there was a seed in cain that was not of god and that and that cain was capable of things that only a non-seed we're capable of this was murder we're talking about chapter four we're still at the beginning of the book all right and so when they were in the field cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and that doesn't mean it knocked him down it means he killed him all right and then before you before you're seated if you'll go to hebrews chapter 11 and verse 4 i would like to read a little bit about abel and cain again hebrews 11 4 by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain more excellent higher than the offering that cain brought cain brought what was from the ground he had some attachment but it was just vegetables but abel brought something that he loved i i i don't think that that cain had a love affair with turnips how could you in my family we ate the greens and throwed most of the turnip away we just chopped up a little bit for bitter flavor to add to the green the rest went out out in the garbage and and you yankees that come you know you i understand somewhere up through there they eat to turn them throw out the greens what's wrong with you people true story i'm sticking to it and you you throw out most of the vi anyway amen by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and gain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous he got a testimony of being righteous because he brought a god-honoring and excellent sacrifice powerful god testifying of his gifts there's a law there and by it he being dead yet speaketh did you know abel's prophesying to us today he's talking to us today may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated now other than the fact that cain the new testament tells us cain was of that wicked one his representation was not in the attributes of god as brother branham showed it on the board dot dot dot dot dot dot dot he said now these were the attributes of of one heavenly attributes but the attributes of the other were of the earth of the base nature of the nature of unbelief this was a product of a different seed now i cannot take the time to talk about the difference between the seeds today but i can tell you that everything we know about this story came out of the seed that they carried and from the beginning of time from the garden all the way through to this day the enemy is always there to mess with the seed he wants to destroy the seed and if he cannot the seed of god and if he cannot destroy the seed of god he wants to mix it that great hybrid his whole concept hybriding his whole concept mixing up the seed contaminating the true life and character of almighty god bringing in that base nature of lost and fallen humanity a seed now you know i was reading recently where the prophet was talking about adultery and he said you know eve could have never uh she could have never yielded herself i'm going to paraphrase just just a bit but you'll get it you can find it and i can tell you where to read the word for word uh eve would have never given herself let's say to that to that uh adultery had she not made a decision the seed of discrepancy tells us some of these things she made a decision up here and she she took another truth see the enemy was there to sow a seed of discrepancy we're talking about a mental thought he was there to sow a mental thought a seed a thought of the mind that was contrary to the absolute of god's word in fact i think it may be in the message absolute that i'm that i'm talking about this particular thing and i hope you're paying attention i hope you're not uh passing notes i hope you're right here with me because this is where we have to be for this moment this is where we have to be right here right here because god wants to help us with something i know he does i'm sure of that i'm convinced of that so i want you to to not focus so much on the natural part of this as we would the spiritual part of this because the churches of our world today are also committing this same kind of spiritual adultery because many of them are embracing ideas that do not have their foundation in the word of god so they're an alternative truth they're an alternative seed not of the original not of the thoughts of god not of the zoe life of god but some kind of imitation or a substitute or an imitation and the enemy is always there trying to insert that into the mind of people and when you receive that in order to receive the faults the seed of discrepancy you have to reject the truth that's what makes it adultery that's what makes it a form of adultery you are rejecting your own husband the word to believe a lie to believe a counter-truth an alternative truth and in doing so there's only one spirit that can follow that kind of behavior it's confusion the spirit of this age laodicea is about people's rights we know that from the scripture it's the day the age of people's rights and isn't that what everybody is so tremendously disturbed about in our nation even now i want to say i don't care what cost me i want to say thanks be to god that a 50 year old wrong has been made right in this nation yes and when we say that we we don't even have to say it from a scriptural standpoint we can say from a constitutional standpoint our constitution has once again been honored we don't get to just write things and make them up as we go along we have an obligation to stay with the constitution of this nation and i am appalled at some of the comments that people start making and you know some of the little things that capture my attention so much over the course of the last few days is simply this have you ever seen an hour where people were so upset about saving innocent lives saving innocent life have you ever thought you'd be living in an hour where people would be more concerned about saving a dog a pet than they are human life i tell you that is a real confusion isn't it what a spirit of confusion in our land today people posting all the time all the time don't forget it's hot remember your dogs there's nothing wrong with that it's right it's right why don't you take just a little bit of your influence every now and again and say as some of you have lives are sacred let's not forget the unborn remember i asked the lord some years ago before an election what is on your heart what are the things that matter to you now now you can say god doesn't care anything about politics well i'm just telling you what i asked him i said lord what is on your heart and he gave me the list of things that meant the most to him in that moment one of them was the sanctity of human life the second one was the sanctity of human marriage real biblical concept of marriage one man one woman for life that's the bible concept and then carrying and supporting and standing by the nation of israel and you know this nation rises and falls on those three things again and again and again and again so yes we have something to thank god for we can say that a bit of the confusion has been brushed off and yes people get all upset and they're marching and they're screaming and they're rioting and they're carrying on because they're just manifesting the spirit of this age which is demanding our rights we want our rights we've got to have our right let me tell you something what about what god wants who's interested in discovering what god cares about what does he love and this is vitally important in this hour now i want you to know because i'm not going to stay on this very long i i have to move on for today but i want you to understand that caney did a good job he he didn't bring the rotten taters he brought the best taters that he had he he bought the he brought the prettiest turnips and the best squash whatever it was that had come from the fruit of his labor in the earth he brought the best of that he knew better than to bring the crooked carrot whoa his carrots were straight as a board so he brought the best of what he had to offer but but there was one thing and again we're putting aside the fact that he had a different seed right now we're looking at his offering and what kind of god would would just reject and refuse somebody bringing the best they had to offer i mean it seems a little cruel doesn't it seems a little hard to understand that god would do such a thing as that just remember that god disregarded he who he was as a person and the offering that he brought so god was looking at the seed and he was also looking on the fact that cain had no no revelation he followed the trends stay with me he followed the trends he was religious in following the trends but he had no revelation and without a revelation all that he could do would be to bring the best that he thought i i think that god should be very happy to receive these vegetables he reasoned just like his origin and and he said i just can't imagine a god that wouldn't like these carrots these are just the most amazing carrot this is the best tournament my my god's going to be so happy i want you to know he walked to the place of building an altar just like abel did with confidence that god was going to be pleased with what he had to offer there's going to be a whole lot of people that that wake up to a sad reality one day that all the years of your religious fervor have not given you one second of eternal life because eternal life doesn't come out of religious fervor or out of religious loyalty it only comes from being born again born again of the spirit of christ when we look at that in the greek we find it to be born again brother donovan what does it mean to be born again born from above isn't that wonderful news to know that even though i had a birth from below born into this earth this fallen society my mother my dad came together in intimate relationship each providing their part of the equation god breathed life into me i'm going to say a very dangerous thing even though some would have seen me as only a ball of twitching muscle and sinew because that's some people's favorite quote god saw me so much more because as the scriptures say he saw me before in fact it says he saw my unformed substance before i had nose before i had hands before i had legs way before i had eyelashes he saw me in my unformed substance in my mother's womb and he gave me a destiny he knew me he knew me he knew my name and he knew my choice and before i was ever born before i ever breathed the first breath of life on my own god already knew who i was who i was going to be my failures my sin he knew it my strengths my accomplishments my trophies he knew it and none of that had anything to do he was only looking at my choice he saw that i would choose him and because of that foreknowledge he gave me a prefix destiny that all the hordes of hell may march against but they cannot change who i am they cannot change who you are he saw you he knew you he brought you to this place in time to serve a purpose so you've got to lay every quote like every scripture in balance of the other you see my mom provided a part of who i am my dad provided a part of who i am but it was god who gave me what i really am it was god who gave me life it was god's breath who made me a living soul hallelujah and so don't forget that when my heart began to beat god already knew who i was for a mother to make such a decision that that heartbeat doesn't matter is against everything i know about the nature of god so be careful how you pick your little quotations and your little things and go forward please understand that i am compassionate and understanding of those who are in horrible circumstances of life but i am so blessed when i hear a testimony of someone who says my mother chose maybe maybe it's not a mistake that i saw bobby connor who's been right here who spoke from this place maybe it's not a mistake that his testimony was making it's it's circular again this week on social media because he probably shared some of it with us here in service if he didn't i've been with him many times in many places around the world i've spoken with bobby in singapore i've spoken with bobby and israel i've spoken with bobby in in switzerland i've spoken with him in california and in many other places and he has said to me personally that he has a memory you say i don't believe that it doesn't matter what you believe he believes it and and if he don't have anybody else to believe it i believe it he said he remembers the the effort let me just try to say it clean as possible the effort that his mother was making to try to take his life he saw the hand of god felt and experienced the hand of god in his mother's womb push him aside and hold him over to the side so that the coat hanger couldn't take his life [Laughter] somebody said i can't i can't even believe in such and so fantastical as that well then you don't know what god's purpose was in bobby connor but his purpose and his destiny god was so jealous over that that he said you will not win in taking what i have chosen and you know god is saying that let me tell you something why it's so important in this hour it's because the last seed of god has not yet been expressed in the earth you hear me gentiles the last seed of god has not yet been expressed in the earth and i don't know who it's coming through i don't know when it's going to come but one day the last seed that's going to have eternal life is going to be born into planet earth and when it does that's it the mercies of god leaving the gentiles and returning quickly to the jews because god is not a bueno who breaks his covenant with man he made a covenant with israel the people and israel the dirt and he will not break that covenant but you and i have been given this glorious opportunity as the nations the of the world to come to christ and know eternal life not as a second thought but a part of god's original plan of grace for the nations he didn't just love israel he loved israel above the other nations but he loved the earth and he loved the nations of the earth and he made a way for even the gentiles to come to god yes and we helped bring the jews in in the last days isn't that a wonderful thing god has allowed us to have a part in yes it is so uh where were we whoo uh so god did that for bobby he's done that for many uh who is this amazing blind musician i know there are many say it again other than stevie wonder i think he's marvelous no keep moving all these men are wonderful andre how do you say his last name botticelli i think i may be wrong botticelli is that right bocelli burticelli do you all know who i'm talking about spaghetti that's the only italian i know if i'm not mistaken i may be mistaken but i think there was a testimony that came out about his own life that his mother made a decision knowing that something was terribly wrong with her child she made a decision to keep him around and i think there are many other testimonies that we have heard through the years of great performers and men and women who have shined who whoever really uh seeming excelled in life who were here because someone decided broken but valuable maybe not perfect but mine and i'm going to choose for life and look what the world has received because of it now back to the garden cain is there and he is laying his sacrifice out and i was in korea preaching in the pentecostal churches and i was so amazed that at so many of the pagan practices that some of them were still carrying over into christianity and one of those pagan practices was they decorated the altar every sunday they made made like a diorama on the altar and they laid beautiful flowers and beautiful fruits and all kinds of things on the altar and they were clear in telling me that they weren't giving them to god they were just beautifying the worship atmosphere and they also rang a bell to bring the holy spirit in and they rang a bell to dismiss him and i just i just enjoyed their traditions the best i could because i like kimchi you'll do a lot of things for kimchi but as i began to be more familiar with them i i realized that i had a little authority i had a little voice in their life and so i waited to that part of the service when they were gonna ring the bell to send the holy spirit out and i said stop a very orderly service and i was the one who screamed this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears i said stop and and they all look the pastor it's name i remember his name today was iwan bark he was the leader of the assemblies of god in korea he was dr cho's pastor he was the one dr cho answered to and he said reverend stephen what what in the world is wrong and i said i just can't stand to see him go i've enjoyed him being here so much until i just can't stand the thought of sending him back out into eternity somewhere let's stay a while and worship god and enjoy the presence of the holy spirit i have a card in my desk where where that where pastor ewan bart wrote me later and he said i want you to know we have now stopped the ringing of the bell at the end of the service he said we still ring it in to make sure he's welcome but we don't ring it at the end to send him out too many churches dismiss the holy ghost just before he has an opportunity to do what he has come to do let's not do that let's welcome him here oh god made this eagle's refuge holy this campground new hope revival ministries may it always be a place where the holy ghost is welcome to come to stay with us as long as he will to move among us as he desires bless the name of jesus so cain is doing it he's decorating he's laying the carrots in a row he's making it beautiful can i have a little water i'm screaming i need some support and the prophet tells us abel was a loving shepherd he cared for his sheep but there was one he had a pet lamb he had one that he loved above the others and when it come time to offer an offering to god he wanted to give god something that meant something to him cain couldn't care less about the carrots he was proud of him because he'd done a good job growing them but oh abel loved the slam this was the sweetest lamb the most special lamb the most beautiful eyes of any lamb that abel had ever raised in his flock and when it came time to build an altar and offer a sacrifice to god he didn't want to give god just one of the crowd just one of the group he wanted to bring to god something that meant so much to him why would he do that why would he do that it's real simple abel had a revelation that one day the blood of an innocent lamb was going to cry out on behalf of the sins of the entire world the bible calls him a prophet he was prophetic in the sense that he caught a revelation of how my redemption was going to come and he was a type of what was to come the innocent spotless lamb of god behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world out from the midst of the of the throne came a lamb as it had been slain from the very foundation of the world and abel caught up oh abel got english is my language of choice he got caught up in the glory of the revelation and he said if my offering is going to be a a type a symbol of the offering if my little lamb is going to be a prophetic representation of the great lamb of god powerful then it must be the finest lamb the most beautiful thank you son the most beautiful lamb and it must be the one that means the most to me brother branham said he strips down a grape vine rips it down off the vine and he begins to make himself a little rope braids him a little rope and he ties that rope around the little lamb's neck and he begins to lead him over to the altar that he has built and he sits down around that altar and he lays that lamb down and how many of you know if a little animal like that doesn't want to lay down he's going to try it's best to get up again and he's just trying his best without being cruel you say cruel he's about to kill the lamb please understand if that lamb could no more redeem and cleanse abel it's not that animal life that was going to bring able to complete redemption but this was a shadow of what was to come under the law of moses that provided a covering for sin that would later lead to a total remission of sin when the blood of the spotless lamb of calvary was shed you follow the type right he lays sets down and he lays that uh lamb down on the on the ledge or the edge of that altar and there is no sharp knife are you with me there is no smith there is no sharp knife but the branham said he just picks up a a jagged rock and he says i've got to make this as quick and as painless as possible somebody said when you tell stories like that it turned my stomach i hope it turned your stomach so many ways i i do i hope i hope that you have to swallow before i'm through telling it because i want you to understand the magnitude of the revelation that abel had received and then i want to tell you how do you and i think that we can get by in this last hour without a revelation how can we survive how can we overcome without a personal revelation of the lamb of calvary and what he has done for us how can we live without the power of the holy ghost within us how can we keep moving on without total deliverance when it's promised to us in the same sacrifice and so as quickly as possible jennifer he takes that jagged rock he takes one to hand and he begins to feel with his left hand he's feeling the neck of that lamb to find the jugular vein and with the right hand he raises that sharp jagged rock and with just two or three strikes he rips through the hide through the through the fire the fleece i'll get it right in a minute the fleece of the lamb he rips through the skin of the lamb he begins to tear through the muscle tissue of the lamb and he reaches that jugular vein and with one thrash of a jagged rock he severs the jugular vein all the while bathing himself don't you see it like a little sprinkle the jugular vein doesn't sprinkle blood megan has worked as a nurse in the surgical unit of a hospital and she can tell you what happens when you get a major like that it just every time that little lamb's heart would take a beat the blood would thrust from that severed jugular vein like a fountain whoa bathing the altar bathing the ground around the altar and more importantly than that bathing abel in the blood [Music] bathing able in the blood of his own offering of his own sacrifice how could god have been moved by the blood of a turnip come on i used to preach under the tents you can't get blood out of a turnip how could that juice veggie juice have moved god when he was giving a revelation that it had to be blood and this blood would only be a covering and a type with antitype of the reality of the real blood that was going how did abel how did abel know brother branham said that adam and eve they picked their children up they put them on their knee they told them the stories of god and how he had come down in the cool of the day and how these things had happened cain heard the same stories that abel heard cain heard the same sermons cain attended the same services sung the same songs went through all the religious program that abel went through but he did not have a revelation of where the blood is what the blood does he did not have a revelation of what had to be shed now listen was it unfair of god to expect something let me tell you something he had heard cain had heard how god himself came down in genesis 3 when adam and eve had sinned discovered their nakedness and god came down in the cool of the day to visit with them again this time instead of adam and eve being standing standing there waiting to receive their guests they're hiding over there in the bushes naked who told you you're naked they'd been naked all along but now they were no longer covered with the glory light of god's great creation he created them with with coverings of light how do you know because i've seen them that he covered them with with glory and light like garments so that their nakedness they had no idea because through that through that they saw one another through the glory that covered them it's an amazing thing and now that is gone in the in the disobedience it's gone and they're standing there hiding from god because they think the father has come down to kill him now i want to tell you emphatically that papa did not come to kill them he came to clothe him amen he came to cover up their sin to cover up their nakedness and the bible said that he slayed the lamb he slayed the animals god himself slew the animals and made them coats of skin and cain and abel heard the stories both of them heard how god himself had come and made these clothes of skin for adam and eve to wear to cover their nakedness but but abel when he heard that story something within his inner being the seed of god lived within him whoa abel said hey there's a whole lot more to this story and cain said you know his mind is thinking oh how disgusting can you imagine walking around with bloody hides bloody skin slapping against your legs can you imagine putting on something filthy like that and walking around calling yourself in the presence of god but i'm not able are you awake not able he said this is the most glorious thing i've ever heard in all my life and that's why when it came time to praise when it came time to worship when it came time to give god an offering abel knew what to give him and cain didn't know what to give him there's a lot of cain still trying to give god something force him to take it force him to accept it force him to receive it he didn't want anything to do with him now i want you to look at hebrews 11 1. we've got to hurry it's already 10 to 1. and i have to move on i want you to look at hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance i want you to understand that faith is not an emotion it's not just a feeling it's not something like a cloud or a mist or oh no no faith is the substance of things hoped for and it is the evidence of things not seen when you know that you know that you know that you possess the evidence of things that you cannot see with your natural eye that's faith and when you know that you hold the substance of things in your spiritual hand that you can only hope for in your heart that's faith and when you like a bulldog grab a hold of the promise of god and even though there is no change in the circumstance and there are no changes in the situation you are holding on to a promise holding on to the substance of a promise holding on to the evidence of things that you can't see but you will not let go you have put your teeth down you've let that jaw like the bulldog's jaw you let the bone slip down in the dip you you've locked down in there and you're holding on and you're that's faith you that say i believe god one day for something and the next day you're not sure that's not faith that's wishy-washy that's that's not even as good as the faith that we can bring you know kind of conjure up in our own intellect in our own mind we're talking about a faith that says i don't care what it looks like i don't care what it smells like come on stay away i don't care what it sounds like god said it i believe it it's settled whether i believe it or not it's settled because god said it i want you to go with me to the mount of olives i know i don't know why some of you are so sleepy this morning we're up too late or something i'm not sure my i can't sleep i've got a job to do so you try to stay awake and help me do it matthew chapter 26. i got plenty of things i could be doing just to be honest with you i i still got a lot of things that need to be done before i leave on an airplane tomorrow but i didn't want to be nowhere else i wanted to be here i want to give god thanks for every one of you that are here today i want to especially thank luke and brother luke and sister megan for being here in the service leaving after the service driving to texas and i appreciate that they would do that that way they could have left early when the kids were still sleepy but they had a desire to come and be a support and help this morning i appreciate that very very much and all of the rest of you that are here that will be leaving later in the week i appreciate it so much matthew chapter 26 beginning in verse 30. if we get too sleepy then i won't go too far into this but i'll try to get a little of it out and when they had sung of hymn they went out into the mount of olives and then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i'm risen again i will go before you into galilee you see they knew they knew they have no excuse for not knowing they knew he said he was going to raise again they knew he said he was going to meet them in the galilee they knew it they just let carnality get a hold of him when he died when they saw the brutality of his death they let they let faith slip they let carnality rise up in them and they said how can it be it's gone they'll never be back they forgot about his words but after i'm risen again i will go before you into galilee what a promise and peter answereth and saith unto him and said unto him though all men i want you to listen peters i want every one of you peters to listen peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended i don't care what others do i'll never leave my church i don't care what others do i'll never leave my pastor i don't care what other listen folks it sounds good and you mean it at the moment so did peter though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended you believe peter meant what he said i do i believe he meant what he's saying jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice three times and peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said you read it for me all the disciples peter led them i'll never be offended with you lord everything you say i'm i embrace it and everywhere you go i'm going with you and and all the disciples they thought that sounded so good that they jumped right in and they said yes yes yes we feel the same way we'll never never never be offended with you we will not deny you jesus goes on to say well that's all for now peter could not believe that he could possibly be the one that would deny the lord in that moment he could only see his strength he could only see his resolve his own will not to deny he did not have the faith necessary to live out his confession because there's two kinds of faith he had faith in his ability to make the right choice he had faith in his ability to stand when things got tough when things got rough but he didn't know just how rough it was going to be and he didn't know the circumstances that were about to unfold he did not fully understand what was to come i want to read luke 22. i've read these verses in this context to you before but i want you to hear them again in luke chapter 22 verse 31-34 jesus had already thus spoken this to peter peter had already heard what i'm about to read and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as sweet but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and what else did he say and to death and he said i tell thee peter the shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me peter's clear i'll go all the way to the death i'll go to prison i'll go all the way to the death i'm determined that never to betray you never to fail you now the reason why peter had never failed in this manner before is because he had never been faced with that situation or with these particular circumstances before in his life new situations and new circumstances can often put us in a vulnerable place and in those moments of new circumstances and new temptations and new testings and new siftings and shiftings it's in that moment that we must never rely on what we think we know about who we are we must always rely on what we know not what we think we know but what we know and what we know comes by by revelation doesn't come by instruction doesn't come by education it doesn't come by more information it only comes by revelation i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know you know we sometimes say i don't care how bad it gets i don't care what they do i don't care what what happens as they begin to set up the mark of the beast just just as we're getting ready to leave here i don't care how our freedoms are taken away i i know what i'll do i know i'll stand we we all like to think that if you know someone soldiers or someone should come in today with a loaded weapon and say will you deny we like to all think that we have right now the resolve that it takes to stand and to say no matter what you can take my life you can lay my head on the chopping block and chop it off you can shoot a bullet through my heart but i will never deny that jesus is my lord and savior every one of us would like to believe and we think we know about ourselves that we possess the strength the courage the fortitude the power the guts excuse me to say no matter what you say no matter what you do i will never deny him peter was the same no matter what happened i'll go to prison i'll go all the way i'll never leave you i'll never be offended at you i'll always stand for you peter liked to think that he would be always what he should be what he was supposed to be you and i would like to think the same thing about ourselves but there's only one way to ever really know isn't there and that's to come down to be tested somebody said well when is that going to happen it's already happening you're already standing before the judgment seat of christ the only judgment seat you'll ever stand before is the bride of christ is the one you're standing before now you're already being sifted and tempted and tested the word is already trying you in this hour somebody said well nobody has a bullet to my head and asking me to deny no but when you check your receipt and find out that you haven't paid for all your items and you don't make the extra effort to go back and make it right you're failing the test when you pick up something that's not yours without any regard for who it belongs to you you're failing the test when you cheat when you lie when you when you when you uh show yourself uh in some false way portray yourself in some false way spend all your time bragging about how how good you are and how wonderful you are and knowing all along that you're living a secret life double life you're failing the test you say who are you preaching to anyone who can relate to the words that's coming out of my mouth when you happen to be watching something and you don't take the time to turn off the vulgar to rush through the vulgar or to get rid of the vulgar or to shut the whole thing off altogether every time every time you make the wrong decision you're being tested you're being tried and so when we get to thinking so good about ourselves come on now when we click on the click bait we know we're not supposed to click there we know exactly the danger we know exactly what could possibly happen when we do it but we do it anyway we're being tested now we're being tried now we're being judged now by the word the bride doesn't stand before the great white throne judgment of the lord jesus christ we're being judged even now by the things that we face in our life when somebody cuts us off in traffic all the things that happen where our morality and our integrity and our honesty our uprightness is being tested and we don't choose to take the high road we're failing in those things we need not think we possess the courage necessary to stand in the hour that the gun when there's a discussion going on and and you're almost a part of the discussion and you just let it continue on without ever speaking up for the name of christ somebody damning god's name and you don't take the opportunity a man women you better not but a man had the opportunity to become say i sure wish you wouldn't say that about my lord i've said it hundreds of times in my life i sure wished you wouldn't talk about my lord that way [Music] i've embarrassed my own family before because sometimes they're big and burlier and meaner and look like they could pinch my head off just pluck it off like a worm's head but i want you to know there are just times that we just cannot be silent i've turned around in booths and said fellas i wish you all wouldn't talk like that in front of my wife my wife is a lady i wish you all wouldn't talk that way there with their wife sitting right beside them i don't think that you ought to go looking for trouble i think you should only speak up when you know that it's the right opportunity and the right moment to do it it'll be an impact you see i remember sitting on the beach one time with my kids we were dressed decent and we had no idea that there was going to be a time that that there would be a lot of school kids there and behind us that big large group of college kids were there and they were doing things i didn't want my children to see and saying things i didn't want my children to know anything about and we were just about ready to pack up and leave and all of a sudden i thought wait a minute this is my beach my god created this he gave this to me for beauty and i just got up my wife hollering down please don't please don't do that please don't do that please don't do that the children cry don't don't no no daddy don't go and i said do i do do you think i'm gonna look intimidating you'll see all those guys they can knock me down without any trouble and they may but i'm going to go down telling them that they ought not to talk like that and i walked back up and i said excuse me folks took me a while to get their attention because they're having such a good time excuse me all a lot of girls on boys my family is just right there and we were first we got there first we're just just right ahead of you all and and we know this is public and we know everybody has a right to hear but your language is so offensive my wife has never heard language like that my children particularly have never heard words likes coming out of your mouth i would so much appreciate it if you all would tone it down have a good time enjoy life enjoy yourself but could you do it just a little more respectful of the others around you we don't talk like that and we don't do those things and you know what one by one of course they're stunned first i've told this before they're first they're all going with everything in them they wanted to curse with everything in them they wanted to be mad at me and tell me where i could go and what i could do but they couldn't because they were arrested and my wife can tell you before the day was over here come one of them down he said would you all mind just a college kid would you all mind if i sat with you all for a while i said no go ahead there's a chair right there yeah help yourself he said my daddy's a church of god preacher he said i know he'd be ashamed of me if he knew what i was doing down here how i'd been acting he said your words cut through me like a knife listen that was not me just trying to be ugly because sometimes you've got this feeling that you want to just be invisible in a moment like that i've had it you don't want to say nothing you don't rock the boat you don't want to be shot but in that moment where you know that you've got to speak up for what is right i just had to in that moment and so glad i did because when that young man finally left us that evening afternoon he said pray for me i don't want my daddy to be ashamed of me neither do i want to stand before god and have him to be ashamed of me one day look folk we're living in a world where tolerance is what's preached but there's just so much of that that we can we can live with there's just so much of that we can take and then there's those moments that we have to stand up for what we know is right peter thought he had what it took because he had a mental concept of faith he had an intellectual faith in his ability to stand but he did not have what it takes from on high to come down and anoint that faith with the revelation oh no he didn't i said a moment ago let me just read my notes the reason why peter never failed in this manner before is because he had never been faced with this situation or these particular circumstances before new situations new circumstances can often put us in a vulnerable place in those moments we must never rely on what we think we know we must only rely on what we believe our revelation of the word by faith what do you believe my revelation on the word by faith what god has revealed to me from his word by faith i believe that by faith i accept that by faith i receive that nobody has to prove it to me my faith has chosen to embrace that because it came by revelation peter was leaning on his intellectual concept of faith and it failed him and it caused him to fall his intellectual faith was not enough to hold him but his revelation but his revelation was enough to pull him back to the truth you see he didn't have a revelation of faith like he needed but he did have a revelation matthew chapter 16 go there quickly i'm on page 2 of 20. i need to hurry when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom to me and say that i the son of man am and they said some say they are john the baptist some elias others jeremiah or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter simon peter simon peter said thou art the christ the mashiach the anointed one the messiah the son of the living god he had a revelation he didn't have all the revelation he needed but he had a revelation and it was that revelation that pulled him back when he failed when he denied the lord i wished i had time to read it when he denied the lord and the cop the rooster told on him you know how we talk about preachers loving fried chicken because we're always trying to get revenge on the chicken for what they did tell it on peter cock-a-doodle-doo that's a sick rooster is that a little better three times as peter denied the lord in luke 22 deny the lord do a little dishwasher oh yeah i know who you are your speech betrays you i don't even know what you're talking about come on he failed he lied he failed he wouldn't have made it but that revelation that he did have pulled him back until he could get the revelation that he needed to stand remember one day jesus in matthew 16 can i just give it to your notes like that you go read them in matthew 16 21-23 do you remember jesus turning to him one day i'm not going to read it but remember he turned to him what get thee behind me satan looked at peter get thee behind me satan for thou savers not the things that be of god you're not running after god like you should you're not running after revelation like you should you're spending too much time on facebook and not enough time with your face in his book come on get thee behind me you're going to have to have a little something else to be able to stand in that hour oh peter was still concerned about his reputation his standing in the community but when the rest when the rooster preached the sermon peter knew what he had done when peter needed what peter needed was the upper room he needed to be filled with the very life of god he needed jesus on the inside he had jesus around him see a lot of people had the prophet with them in the sleeping bag and in the tent and on the trip and all the wonderful hunting things all the beautiful experiences they had with random but what they needed was the god of william branham on the inside of them they needed to have in them what he had in him and it's still the same today anybody with me oh he needed power he needed power revelation to stay on the journey to stay in the word the infilling with the life of jesus leads us onward to all truth now let me let me do this before i make a quote here i wish i had time james 2 19 thou believeth that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe in tremble did you know the devil has a better revelation of who god is than 90 of the churches in the world today because they're not sure how many gods there are he said thou believers that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe in tremble let me tell you something the devil know how many knows how many gods there are the devil knows that baptism in the name of jesus christ is the only baptism for scripture the devil knows the new birth is not complete without the baptism of the holy ghost the devil knows that god's going to have an overcoming bride in the end time with the same signs and wonders and miracles following her that jesus talks about in mark 16. the devil knows that the devil knows that god sent a prophet a voice in the wilderness to prepare bride to call us back to the word god the devil knows that now if demons believe the bible said and devils demons believe and tremble now what kind of belief do you think devils have in order to have a belief you've got to have faith what kind of faith do devils have what kind of a belief system does a demon have he only has the knowledge that was spoken to him he only has the information he only has the knowing that has been passed to him but i tell you there's not a demon that has a revelation by the holy ghost of who god really is so this helps us to see there's a different kind of faith the kind of believing that a demon does is not the kind of believing that the bride of christ is going to be required to do in the last days anybody following me you see our faith is more than intellectual faith our faith must be more than a mental concept of faith we must have faith by revelation which only comes as an experience revelation is an experience don't tell me you don't need an experience with god revelation is an experience revelation is an encounter with god and once you receive a revelation it affects your dna both naturally and spiritually when you receive a holy ghost revelation from the lord you are never the same and so if you can be talked out of that you had a feeling but no revelation [Applause] you don't want to mistake a feeling for a revelation when you have received a revelation you are willing to reorder your whole life everything is reordered everything is rearranged and adjusted to accommodate the truth that god has quickened to your heart you leave the denominational systems and thought patterns and church age mentalities and behaviors behind it's one of the reasons why some people put all their emphasis in the church ages because that's as far with god as they're going to be able to go because they're hung up in church age mentality and behaviors the bride doesn't have a church age mentality the bride will have a bride's mentality which is the mentality of the bridegroom you see we're walking in a simultaneous lap over because there are many of us who are beginning to taste the fruits of another age isn't that amazing that god would let us begin to taste now the promises of a new age a new hour we could say that there's part of the millennium dawning in our hearts even in this hour as we were raised up to sit together with christ in heavenly places i know i'm quit i know i'm moving quickly and but i want you to know it i wanted to get in you this this demon faith this demon belief is not enough it's got to come by revelation in acts 16 30 31 let me just give you this although this is so elementary and you know it very well acts 16 30 31 i'm on page four i'm doing better and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved they said and i want you to know they said hasn't changed this is still the message for salvation believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house believe now that's not the demon belief that's a mental belief that's just mental faith believe in tremble they're even affected by what they believe but it's not by revelation that they believe it they accepted it because it was told them don't you accept it because it's told to you don't you be satisfied with somebody else's uh understanding of what salvation is you keep pursuing christ until you experience the birth from above for yourself and you know that you know that you know that you have been born from above anybody with me and let me tell you something there will be those who are not a part of the elected bride of christ who will be saved in the last days as as part of the church simply because they believed on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved let me tell you something however there will not be anyone living in eternity with eternal life that has not believed on the lord jesus christ to be saved so just because someone has been good to you or kind to the bride does not give them biblically a salvation a new birth an experience with god it must be those who believe on the lord jesus christ those are the ones who shall be saved and also given a promise for their house i claim the promise you should claim the promise for your family anointed ones at the end time paragraph 53 are you with me what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you there it is this is an intellectual faith or mental faith that's something told you and you said i believe that when you were a little child in sunday school the sunday school teacher said jesus died on the cross to forgive your sins you said hmm i believe that i trust this woman i trust my teacher seems to have done her good i believe this that's not all it takes that's just a mental that's just an accepting of facts someone tells you something you say i i think that's right that's not the kind of faith it's going to take to overcome in the end time you're going to have to have more faith than that what what what is above the faith from above is going to have to come down and meet with your faith your mental faith every man is given the measure of faith another writer to every man is given a measure a measure and b measure you've all got a faith given to you when you come here but that's a that's that develops into a mental faith or a or an intellectual concept of faith it's when the when the revelation of faith comes to you that you have something to stand what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet you haven't seen the evidence you haven't held the substance but something in you says it's mine [Music] but you believe it will be are you still with me faith is what why don't you read then i'm tired faith that's what faith is it's a revelation of the will of god so by revelation and the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation well aren't we in trouble then aren't we in trouble then how can we overcome how can we do the greater works of jesus christ how can we be mark 16 in action how can we be one with the word how can the bride and the bridegroom become one in total union because all of these things come not by more preaching amen they come by revelation so if you don't ever revisit the things you hear you may never receive the adequate revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system by revelation abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous amen oh i like this he goes on i hope you see that see where we're living see the hour i was talking to a gentleman not long ago a christian scholar a gentleman he said other places brother branham said he was a baptist scholar he said mr branham we refuse all revelations i think that there's message people that believe the same we re we just you know nobody can have a dream nobody can have a vision god don't talk to nobody today he only talked to brother branham lost his tongue in 65 no encounter then you have to refuse jesus christ go back to 54 please paragraph 54. he said mr brandon we refuse all revelations all right i said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh so if you're part of a church that says that god doesn't reveal himself today you have to reject the very fact that jesus is who he says he is because you have to refuse if you do that you refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh unless you see it somebody read that for me [Music] it don't matter if jesus is is one or if jesus is the third member of the trinity or or if jesus is well that don't matter and it doesn't matter who you who you think jesus is just call on his name and it doesn't really matter if you understand that when he said i if you've seen me you've seen the father that he meant what he said those things aren't really important they must be because a vindicated prophetic voice said unless you see it for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh who is jesus god revealed in human flesh unless you see it you're lost well i want to see it because i don't know about you but i want to be found jesus said except you believe that i am he you will die in your sin he is the revelation of god the spirit of god revealed in human form if you believe that say amen i believe it with everything that's within me amen he said you can't believe that you're lost you put him a third person second person or any other person besides god you're lost except you believe that i am he you will die in your sins that's jesus he's quoting jesus a revelation it takes a revelation revelation can hold you when god's not talking he talks he's a walking talking god he talks he gives dreams he gives visions let me just help you a little bit with what joan of arc discovered sometimes god's doing a lot of talking and sometimes he ain't and you've got to live the same sustained con consistent life when he's not talking that you're living when he is talking are you following me it's vitally important that we are living the same life when he's not talking he talks but there's times that he's silent and when he's silent that's the moment that only faith by revelation can hold us to him i want to tell you a story that i love to tell i'm going to read you a story that i love to read it'll take me just a moment to do it and then maybe we will just stop it's in a message called an absolute phoenix arizona paragraph 228. he said in the times of my trouble back there when i lost my family most of you know there may be some listening that do not brother branham lost both his wife and his little daughter sharon rose in the in the uh pneumonia and all the disease that followed the great flood that caused the ohio river to rise there in jeffersonville and and caused the loss of so many lives brother branham lost the love of his life his wife hope and also his little baby girl sharon rose he's referring back to that when i lost my family and my life almost was taken from me some of you might remember that after that brother branham tried to take his own life and was unsuccessful in doing so my little girl died and me praying for her and after i had been on the streets day and night preaching and praying and trying to do what was right you've heard my life story many of you read it and my had come to a place i see my wife die and me holding her hand my little baby took sick a few hours after that and i got down there and prayed and uh with all was in me looked like a black sheep let down and refuse to answer my prayer anybody listening and then satan comes to me and said this is the point i want to make as i prepare to read this it seems like in those moments when god's not talking guess who he is the enemy will always take advantage of those moments when you can hear from god and he will fill your ears and your mind with all of his lies just like he did here to brother branham he said you see you're only about 20 years old and hear you what all you've done and you've neglected yourself and you've done all these things you forfeit all your young life about when you should have been out having a big time like the rest of the young folks and here you stood on the street corner crying and praying you went all night of time in the hospital hour after hour and when it come to your own blood and flesh he refuses to hear you isn't that just like satan you prayed and prayed and prayed and god heard your prayer neal many but when you really needed god when you were facing death the death of your own family where was your god then brother brandon said that was one time i was tempted let's go on but i happen to remember back i got an absolute like job though he slay me yet i'll trust him i don't care what comes or goes now folks when you read a story like this it ought to help you not to complain so much about your little circumstances and situations in life this is a big one this is a biggie isn't it he said i don't care what comes or goes let's go on the state senator of indiana sam eisler he come too he come come he's come to the tabernacle he's deceased now about two years fine man he was coming down the road and i was going up to pray up at the grave where wife and baby were laying it was right after the 37 flood and i had on a pair of boots and i was walking up the road crying little billy my son was just about to die too the doctors had done said there's not hardly anything more to do for him he had some kind of dysentery they couldn't stop an infection and i was crying praying and i thought well i was still holding on to god i was going up the road crying [Music] i thought i'd go up and listen i used to sit up there of an evening by the grave i'd hear an old dove come down there and go to singing i'd hear the pines blow and the winds through the through the pines rather and it sound like they would say there's a land beyond the river they call the sweet forever and we only reach that shore by faith's decree one by one we gain the portal there to dwell with the immortal when they ring those golden bells for you and me do you hear what he was saying in my lowest moment when i couldn't hear and satan was in my ear talking all the time and i'm walking down the road crying it seemed like i could hear the wind and the pines singing when they ring those golden bells for you and me i've been there i've sat in the old rocking chair ready to see my life over with even as a young man so broken and so much in trouble and i could hear the rocking chair rocking out the words some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood god leads his dear children along god uses music like that sometimes to speak to us all right let's read on a minute he said i'd stand there cry and look up and i'd say to my wife and baby i know you're not laying here this is just where i planted the remains that i held in my arms but somewhere beyond the river you're there so i was going up to that place one day to set up at the grave and had on a pair of boots walking along an old car came up beside me stopped it was mr isler the state centered and he jumped out of the car and pulled around and come back put his arms around me and said billy i sure feel sorry i said that's all right brother isler and he said i ought to have stopped he seen i was weeping and i said that's all right mr isa and he said i'm going to ask you something son i said all right go ahead and ask me he said i've seen you stand there in that pulpit till i thought you'd die said i've seen you fast till you'd be so peak and i felt sorry for you and said in and out and in and out day and night he said and then your wife and baby in there see you look at them things and he said what does christ mean to you now and i said thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have i on earth beside thee or whom in heaven but thee i didn't answer see i had found that absolute you don't find the absolute church without revelation you don't get it by just getting more information you don't get it just by hearing another sermon you only find the absolute when the holy ghost reveals to you who he is amen see i'd found that absolute that something that held me when the storm was on let's go on someone said to me billy did you keep your religion during the time of your trouble you you know i know they probably meant well it almost sounds mocking doesn't it oh billy did you keep your religion when you were going through all that trouble he said no [Laughter] no it kept me why because it wasn't just religion he didn't have just a mental concept of faith or an intellectual concept of faith faith had been made live it had been made real to him by the power of the holy spirit god had given him a revelation of what could hold him in times like this he said no no no no it kept me see that's what i said that's what it was i was tied to him in the hours when my strength was gone and there's nothing i could do my anchor held my god help us my anchor held within the veil of his word see it's a revelation see it's a revelation god reveals it he makes it really quickens it to you my anchor held within the veil of the word out yonder where sometimes i don't understand it listen sometimes i don't understand it sometimes i think what makes me do the things i do there is something with inside me listen you ever had it you ever felt that life of christ you mean brother are you yes really yes i'm asking you have you ever really felt that life of christ on the inside of you pulsating inside of you some of you buried your loved ones some here buried their husbands some buried so many that they loved and cared for some faced with such awful circumstances of life and in that hour how did you get through how did you hold on to your religion you didn't you didn't hold on to nothing jesus was holding on to you i know you know that it was that life brother branham said i don't understand why i do the things i do there's something with inside me pulsating me it's the life of christ moving in us quickening us he said i can't keep from doing it brother i have to yield to that life that is within me is anybody here i i i oh my i'm going to close i want to share one other thing this is one of my favorite things to share i brought some of this to you in 2003 i looked up to see and i brought some of this to you in 2013. either way i think it's long enough we could have a little rerun this morning pull two thoughts together from from some notes but god inspired me i felt like he inspired me to do it and i don't want to ruin it this is what i like to close with but i'm going to i'm going to close today with it and not not the message i'll bring some more of this later it's one of my favorite stories to tell i'm going to read it because i want to get every detail and i want you to understand that sometimes we look at our faith and we look at it and see it entirely different than god sees it i know that sometimes things happen in our life and we don't understand them and we could say today without trying to bring any extra pain but we could say sister anita sitting there we don't understand how how we hoped and prayed and believed and how we wished it could be different nothing would make me any happier in this world than to have brother steve over there helping me preach like i've preached today him over there on that or i could have really preached with him on that organ today i could have really preached if he'd been backing me up on that organ just a young man right at my age believe me that's young already in the presence of the lord and the enemy says if you'd have just had more faith you would just use a little more oil you'd just pray a little longer if you're just fasted another meal that's not how it works that's what the enemy uses to beat us up and run us crazy god has a plan you're not going to change god's plan you're going to learn to adapt to god's plan that's what believers do i want to read you this little story of little deborah statscliff i just noticed sister weems not here today but sister weems knew the statscliff family and some years after she came here she gave me some books that belong to brother julius statscliff i treasure them to have something that belonged to him man of faith and he wrote the book that has gone around the world a prophet visit south africa and this is his story the little baby deborah brother branham says in paragraph six of the message of the messiah i just let a little woman coming in from germany just left a little woman coming in from germany a few weeks ago she lost a baby she was standing near in california once when they brought in a little baby had been dead died one morning about three or four o'clock parents had drove all day and it was about three or four or five o'clock six o'clock in the afternoon 12 hours or more had passed with a little dead baby in their arms let's go back the mother sitting in the back of the car holding this little cold form in her arms all right and when they come to the place where i was at san bernardino they took the little baby and brought it to where i was standing and i said oh how long has the baby been dead she said since this morning early and i picked up the little cold form it was already stiffened and these people standing around sister statscliff was one of the ones that was there in that meeting in san bernardino she saw this these people standing around i held it in my arms and started praying to our precious lord i felt the baby getting warm think of it just kept holding it just a few minutes and it started kicking and crying and i hand it over to his mother i believe it you don't have to but i believe it enough for both of us because i've encountered that god who can do us exceedingly and abundantly above i've encountered the god of the impossible he takes the impossible and makes it possible i have no no hardship no problem whatsoever believing that god raised this little babies this little dead baby to a life in brother brown's arm and i hand it over to his mother so then when all right go go to paragraph eight so then with this little mother standing here she her baby died over in germany so i want you to understand because we did leave out a paragraph there sister statscliff saw this miracle she knew about this miracle so over in germany where he was serving in the armed forces when she heard when she when her little baby got sick she remembered what she saw and she wanted the same miracle for her little child my mind got distracted because i saw i saw the sign just as clear as day i don't know why i saw it because i've been just outside the gate i've seen the sign in the natural natural lamb stool that's where that's where the plane was uh on the runway ready to come and get brother branham and i don't know why in the world but just clears just just before me i saw the the sign uh welcoming people there to the the great uh base it remains today one of our places in germany if you know anything about those injured in in the wars they're brought many of our service men were brought to landstuhl through the years to be cared for and nursed back to life and he was serving as a chaplain over this whole area but anyway i i don't know why they came her baby died over in germany her husband's a chaplain and they called up long distance about five times through a day and night to ask me to come said they know that god would raise that little baby up how did she know because she'd seen god do it and it became a revelation to her that god is still able the same yesterday and today and forever you couldn't talk her out of it little mother's standing there all right let's go on i said let me go pray and i went and prayed and prayed that afternoon and that night and i'll show you whether the doctors believe or not when she'd already give the doctor my book to read i believe called prophet visits africa it was a prophet visit south africa it was the book that her husband had already written something like that so the doctor the little baby had already read this book had already seen the miracles that book if you've never read it you should i gave every family a copy of it uh oh sometime back now and i have a few copies i'll be glad to give you the miracles in that if you've never if you don't have one in your home you can certainly have one the miracles in that book what god did in those meetings in south africa oh my i i have a book in fact i have a book back there signed by the mayor of of johannesburg who was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ my brother sidney jackson and brother stan esterhausen am i throwing too many names out brother stan esterhouse and introduced me to him and uh and gay and he sent me this book with a picture of himself being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ just a secular man but he became so moved by what he saw god do in those meetings and uh so anyway forgive me he said let me go pray i went and prayed all right let's go on and when she said god will raise the baby up the little mother said god will raise the baby up and the baby had been dead before they knowed it about four or five hours and so they got the father word down to the base where he was and the baby had been dead died in the night and so the doctor said all right tell you what i'll do i'll slip over and turn the oxygen back on now listen at a doctor like that and he let the baby lay there for two days with the oxygen turned on waiting and i was over here praying they were going to fly me across with a jet i could leave here with an army jet and be back the same day to germany now when he tells a lot of the details i don't know if it's here for another place he said the jet was actually on the runway in germany ready to take off to come and pick him up it had already been commissioned and sent and permission had already been granted and one morning about daylight i got up and the wife went out of the room in fact in another place he tells it he said she kept knocking on the door bill we've got to tell those people something we got to tell them something we got to tell them something but he didn't have anything to tell him he just said you i can't tell him i don't have anything to tell him he was just putting them off because he hadn't heard from the lord and one morning about daylight i got up and the wife went out of the room it just waked up i just waked up laying there a little bit directly i heard something coming into the room and i looked there was something moving in the room and i jumped up and i said lord what would you have your servant know and he said do not rebuke that that's the hand of the lord see brother branham was looking for an answer of whether he should go to germany and pray and see that little baby raised from the dead he had no doubt that god was able to do it he'd seen god do it sister stats brother julius they had no doubt that god was able to raise that baby but hear the word of the lord come don't rebuke that that's the hand of the lord how could it be how could it be the hand of the lord for that little baby that high coach god has a purpose and a plan that we don't always know don't know about huh he has a purpose he has a plan i can't see how that could be look folks sometimes it's not for us to see it's for us to trust i tell you what god will do he'll harness trouble won't he he'll put a harness on trials and on troubles and tribulations and he'll bring us to our knees he said do not rebuke that that's the hand of the lord see so i got her on the phone and i said no can you imagine the call so i said no god has called your baby and so when she come over to see us that night the night and and he's talking about a period of time has passed the stats now come to the states and one of the first places they want to go is the jeffersonville where brother branham is and they have an arrangement made to meet him in the in the den and she's there waiting for an answer her at the house when i left yesterday she said what was it brother branham my weakness of faith see how the enemy had been talking to that mama if you'd just had more faith that baby would oh i tell you i despise the lies of that filthy devil aren't they already grieving their cells into a dither haven't they suffered enough loss for that dirty lord down souffle to come along and say if you'd have just had more faith [Music] in that just like the devil who could listen to his filthy dirty lies he only picks on us when we're broken when we're weak when we can't hardly stand up takes advantage of our sorrow and our pain he said brother random was it my weakness of faith i said you have great faith days weeks had gone by in fact a couple of months had gone by and every day she was tormented by the reality this this slow sinking feeling if you would have just had faith but the man who said you prayed for your baby you and your husband held on to it god to raise that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best how did brother branham know that she had great faith well he could have discerned it he could have seen it in the spirit he had that kind of gift operating in his life but here was the evidence he knows what's best and still you love him you know how i know anita curry's faith is real you know how i know april mcfarland's faith is real you know how i'm able to look around this room and see a room full of people that i know their faith is real because they have faced those moments it's not just death it's all kinds of tragedies and all kinds of heartaches and all kinds of betrayals and all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of hope deferred all kinds of misunderstandings that could have caused every one of us to throw in the towel throw up our hands and say i don't want nothing to do with god i don't want nothing to do with church i don't want to have nothing to do with church people but you're here and even without a whole band brother shane we were lifted our hands to worship god and to give god praise and with so many of our people missing we weren't i kept saying to everybody who said to me this is what a pastor has to do to keep himself encouraged people said well we'll hardly have nobody there sunday won't hardly have nobody there i'll be there i say it we'll be there most of all god will be there and he's the one that counts i just kept saying that over and over again and you you surprised me this morning so many here we're here not because we've never had a trial i've given you my testimony i've seen my mother beaten to the floor the blood running down her face i saw my own natural dad pick up my little grandmother in such anger and pick her up and throw her down the hall like a bowling ball and she went flying down the hall could have broke a hip could have broke a back i saw them walk out and crush the windshield with a concrete block just rage and so much anger so much hurt and so just so much disappointment just before i was five right at five i remember the day my dad left i can see it just like i closed my eyes i don't even have to close my eyes to see it anymore i'm holding on to his leg i've got both of my arms wrapped around his leg and i'm standing on his shoe and he's dragging me all the way to the car with his suitcase to leave our family for a woman that he's already chosen i can it doesn't take much to bring the memory up finally he saw that i wasn't going to turn loose and i wasn't i was not going to turn loose and he just did i don't mean i don't mean to make you think he ill of him he was he was arrested by an enemy he was possessed by a devil he was doing things out of his own head he didn't even know the consequences of the sin that he was involved in but just for my own safety perhaps and his own sanity when he when he squatted down to start to get in the car he took took his hand and with a little bit of pressure pushed me pulled me off of his leg and and and push me away like you would a dog trying to climb your leg i know what hurt means i know what disappointment is i'm just i'm just here so i get to tell mine you don't have the opportunity to tell yours but we could go around this room and this is a room full of hurting people this is a room full of people that have seen a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and we made a lot of bad decisions and we paid a lot of hard prices this room is it can easily hold us but this room couldn't hold the disappointment and the heartache and the pain and the sorrow and the loss that that could fill up this room just from the people in this room not to mention those who are streaming this service and yet we're here and our feelings are not on our sleeves and we're not bitter to our god we've decided that he's worth serving we've decided that he is life to us that there is no hope and no peace and no joy and no reality in anything but knowing jesus and serving him with every father of our being no church our religion didn't hold us we didn't keep our religion it was god who held on to us in those very difficult times and it wasn't a lack of sister statscliff's faith that caused her to lose her little baby in fact it was god's trust in her he saw he refused to do it because he knew he had a better plan and he knew that she would still love him and still serving she may have questions she might have to get to america to talk to the prophet but she would not waver he shall handle boho he come to my eye musicians are coming she would not waver she would hold on let's read it on that's real faith he said anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not you let things be tested you let things be shifted you let things get out of order oh you let some disappointments come so misunderstand him that's when you'll know whether you've got real faith or not not just a mental concept a revelation of faith anybody with me i know you're weary so am i now he said every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried of god so remember our trials work patience and patience worse hope and so forth would you read that for me so what do we do what do we do we just hold on to god how can we do that because he's holding on to us whether he blesses us or not whether we see the answer to every prayer or not we are right there to believe him anyhow because he's promised it and to see how he does how many of you trust him i trust him would you stand with me oh ben let's sing uh let's sing what we were singing before in the service the old hymn uh great is thy faithfulness let's sing that somebody in here somebody streaming this service needs to be reminded that you are serving a great big faithful god even when you don't feel him he's working even when you don't see him he's moving even when you can't tell that he's making a difference in your life he is just hold on whatever you do hold on can you say man whatever you do hold on don't let the enemy knock you off come on ben come out here and sing sing this with him i want us to sing it with greater fervor more determination than we sung it earlier let's sing it to the glory of god and that's worship why don't we come you that are able i know many of you have to make a pit stop but those of you who are hearing good come on let's worship as we sing it let's come forward this is our last family time together now for a couple services let's come and sing this in worship to our king [Music] great is thy faithfulness oh god [Applause] [Music] thou change is not thy compassions they fail not as thou hast been is [Music] is thy [Music] faithfulness i see [Music] [Applause] provided great is thy faithfulness [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to thy great

hast [Applause] [Music] yes i hallelujah [Music] [Music] i want us to pray together this morning this afternoon before we close we may sing that a little more we may sing something else ben but i want us to pray right now and i want us everyone who see the need of having a revelation of faith you know i believe that it can come in layers i do i believe it can come in in layers and in levels i would like to have a greater revelation of faith i would like that all that heaven has to come down on the faith that i have been able to put together i would like to be carried into new levels and dimensions and depths of faith to believe god for the greater for the things that look impossible to man i'd like to see the greater fulfillment of mark 16 wouldn't you i'd like to see the greater works that jesus promised so why don't we pray together right now individually for ourselves that god would come that he would give us the revelation that we need to stand in this hour that he would pour out the holy ghost on the truth that goes forth that that we dig through that we search through that we listen to that the holy ghost would come and quicken it and make it alive until it become a part of who we are a revelation that can never pass let's pray together right now that god would grant that to each of us father here we stand today in your presence lord you've been with us today and you're talking to our hearts and lord we we need it we recognize that there there are there must be greater faith there there must be higher dimensions and revelations of faith that that is available because there's a deep crying out in us to have that revelation of faith that refuses to move based on circumstances lord the supersense of faith that the prophet talked about lord that's the kind of faith we want to operate in in the last days and that that servant of the lord he made the connection between perfect faith and perfect love and so lord we're after that we desire that with you today so we reach up right now every one of us is individual believers and we say lord would you pour the holy ghost out on the faith that we have would you anoint it would you give us revelation so that it becomes a deeper part of who we are and lord we not only look to faith today but we look to every one of those virtues that are promised in the stature of maturity and the stature of the perfect man we look to every one of those virtues today and we pray that what heaven has would come and join together with what we are able to to operate in in this hour and that it would become supercharged and that it would become a revelation and that it would be power and authority lord that you promised ye shahayah that you promised that this little bride would be able to flow through in the last days lord we believe in the full manifestation of the sons of god we believe in the power of the creative spoken word we believe it is our inheritance we believe lord that it is ours for the asking so we stand before you right now and say oh may the holy ghost take us to deeper depths may the holy ghost take us to higher heights may the holy ghost grant deeper greater revelation of what you are and what you have already provided you are the faithful one oh god maybe you just lay your hand on someone right next to you and you'd pray the same sort of prayer over them my brother my friend my neighbor oh god would you let faith become a greater reality would you let these virtues become more manifold and more manifested in each of these lies my god would you give each one of these saints the strength to resist the lies of the devil we just rebuke and resist the enemy's lies right now in the name of jesus every time that enemy would come and say if you'd have just had more faith if you'd have just been more faithful if you'd have just done it this way or that way and the enemy tries to discourage and break us down i pray lord that you will come hallelujah that you will come and we will remember your faithfulness even through the hardship and even through the sorrow and even through the losses we will remember who you are and we will thank you that the goodness of the lord has been following after us that the goodness of the lord has been what we've lived in and what we have thrived in lord you are faithful and you are good we bless your name today we thank you for the fulfillment of every promise we thank you for healing manifested in the lives and the bodies of those who are sick and needy this day you're the healer you bore the prize on your back and we have seen you heal we've watched you heal you are jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever would you release healing across this body would you release healing to those watching this service right

able you are more than able you are more than able hallelujah hallelujah we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory you are worthy lamb worthy lamb worthy lamb let's worship him just a little bit more i want you to soak this in i don't mean to be dramatic but i want you to soak this in because it's an unusual circumstance that we have two services and we're gonna miss being together i want you to soak in this moment right now and let the spirit of god just saturate your life he goes with us we're going to celebrate him every day and praise him every day and some of us will be in church next sunday with uh brother mcgary there but we we won't all be together there'll be some of us missing from both ends so may we just take this moment to soak in the goodness of god i mean get it in us and go out of here really praising the lord there's one thing we don't have to worry about we don't have to worry about somebody falling away because we didn't have a service [Music] because

hallelujah hallelujah don't we have so much to praise him for come on don't we have so much to thank him for it's been wonderful to be in his presence let's take him with us let's not leave him here let's take him with us as we go out i know you're weary and body tired you've been here for quite a while and you've listened thank you for every faith pull thank you for every amen thank you for every effort it's in times like this that we we really should reflect and think about all that goes in to making this possible to continue to do what we do for the lord i thought about the fact that hawk came over here last night i normally don't have my notes finished until sunday morning but hawk i knew that charity had offered to do them friday well they certainly weren't ready friday to put in the computer and hawk came over here and spent an hour and a half last night just putting in somewhat i didn't even get to but we never know what i'm going to get to i appreciate that appreciate him doing that and and these that have filled it on the music i know it's not easy because if you're not playing a song all the time you you know what you're just kind of thrown into it i just appreciate what every person does you that run the equipment and the streaming and and everything you do to give your prayer you who come early and pray and sanctify the atmosphere wave your flags and call on god to come and help us i appreciate that you that given the offering and pray for your pastor and pray for the work of the lord to continue just being here this morning we appreciate you so much very very much now i hate to even mention this but i'd like to just put this in as just a little bit of a reminder because i i'm also in charge of all the bills because there will not be a service here tuesday night and because there will not be a service on the first sunday just be mindful of that would you would you be mindful when you give online when you use our app it takes one to three weeks for us to get that money depending on your bank and the agreement that you have with our with our processor one to three weeks and so it could be that the first of the month would be a little difficult for us because the bills come to whether we're here having service or not so whatever the lord would put on your heart to put a little early or do do whatever whatever i just had to mention the fact that not having two services can make a real difference in church income you be mindful of that and i know you will because you are faithful i don't know that we could find more faithful people than what is represented here in this body i want to thank you one other little thing let me say this and i'll i'll remember to do it again when i get home but everything you've done for benjamin and jenna i want to thank you their cupboards are just filled i want to thank you for that thank you for bringing the food for them i want to thank you for the shower gifts and what the brothers give and for for our get-togethers for them we try to do the best we can for all of these young couples but i i really as a pastor and as a dad stacy and i we want to thank you for what you've it seems that you've gone a little beyond worked a little harder all the labor that's gone into transforming maw's mobile home that smelled like sam or dog into transforming that in into a nice place that they can live and you volunteered your time and your effort and sometimes your money because sometimes people ran to the store and got stuff and wouldn't even wouldn't even bring a receipt wouldn't wouldn't even be paid god sees every bit of that and every prayer you've prayed for them and every effort it's terribly expensive for those to go to texas who who have made that decision to help in that way may god give it back to you i know that it's a a wedding but you're giving it is unto the lord because you're doing it to honor the work of god here and i appreciate you doing that very much so may god give it back to you press down shaken together and running over you've made a dad's heart very very happy and pleased let's pray for those who are not able to go that they will be covered in peace and in the wonderful care of the lord and that in just a few days we'll be united again may we meet together in a higher place than what we say goodbye in today amen father go with us and keep us in the center of your love and care your presence has been here in an unusual way and i want to honor you and thank you for what you've done and thank you for your word thank you for the atmosphere and for every part that someone played in making this service what it has been to the or to the honor and to the glory of god we give you the praise for it and for those who will be traveling keep them safe and in the favor of the lord and to those who are not able to go along we pray god that you will minister to them that you will visit with them in their home that they will sense your presence and know that you are ever more alive that you will keep the hearts and minds of men and women encouraged and ready to go forward in the work of the kingdom we ask for these graces and blessings in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and the church said amen you are dismissed to go today in the lovely name of the lord god bless you thank you to everyone who has offered to take us to get us to the airport several have offered we're just going to take a vehicle and leave it simply because there will be a staggered schedule for coming home and some of you won't even be here when we come home and and so we're just doing it that way but thank you so much for every effort god bless you how about a hug oh my girl god bless you so [Music] up his hand he would be available to help us brother billy could help brother david mann is there so when she first asked me my mind is blank and i didn't know what to tell her but now you've helped out thank you so much these brothers are here in case there's an emergency and they could help take care of anything that needed to be taken care of all right so [Music] so [Music] you
