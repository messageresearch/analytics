blessed be the name of the Lord oh I love that scripture where brother Brenham said job said in Job 38 where were thou when the sons of God shouted for Joy amen I don't know about you when I was there before the foundation of the world amen and brother if you shouted there you will shout here tonight amen blessed be the name of the Lord there's no way you can stop me from shouting you see I was there before the foundation I was shouting there already and there's no way you going to stop me on this Earth from shouting the glories of God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah Psalms 150 says everything that have breath Must Praise the Lord amen about you but if you are breathing tonight you ought to praise Him amen praise God because that's what the Bible says amen that's the purpose why we are breathing is there somebody breathing here tonight amen then you ought to praise him praise the name of the Lord I like Ezekiel Hezekiah when he told him to get your house in order you're going to die amen he turned and he said Lord the death cannot worship you you know what God changed his mind worship can change God's mind he told the prophet Isaiah turn around and add 15 years of breath for him just to praise me amen hallelujah I'm telling you co couldn't stop us from praising the Lord hallelujah we know the purpose of breathing amen hallelujah so we give God all the honor the praise and the glory Matthew Chapter 2 the wise men came they said we came to worship him I don't know about you is here somebody that's wise here tonight that said I Came To Worship the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord I just want to quickly go to a quote there that brother Brenham says amen uh when David's wife he was dancing and shouting when he saw the ark amen the word of God Amen and he was just jumping and shouting and his wife told him she was ashamed of him amen BR B says many people are ashamed of shouting and praising God Amen and his wife said that she was angry to the king because how can the king dance and Shout like that amen and I like what brother Brenham said what David told her he said tomorrow I will do better tomorrow I will shout better let me tell you last night we were shouting we were dancing we shouted amen but tonight we have to shout better every service you ought to do better is that right amen blessed be the name of the Lord and he said David said tomorrow I will do better amen and you your praise has got to be better amen because God takes us from glory to glory amen there God only promotes his his anointing is a promoe of anointing God never moves backwards amen he moves forward amen is that right so every service just take us from glory to glory blessed be the name I like what the what the Rabbi says about the latter rain they said the letter rain is seven times greater better stronger than the former Reign so if the letter Glory will be seven times better your amen your Hallelujah your dancing and shouting should be seven times better is that right oh blessed be the name of the Lord you ought to Sout better than David you ought to outd dance David am and all the Visions dreams and Revelations God gave in the Old Testament in the former Reign season in the latter reain we should do seven times better we should be seven times greater Hallelujah so brother the singing the shouting the dancing ought to be seven times greater and better is that right amen hallelujah so we're just excited there's another quote amen that where brother bam says he says you cannot go to a dance unless you come in the spirit of dancing amen he said you cannot go to a ball game unless you come in the spirit of the ball game and then he says you cannot amen you cannot have Revival unless you come in the spirit of Revival is there somebody coming in the spirit here tonight amen hallelujah and that will bring and produce a Revival blessed be the name of the Lord you may be seated tonight amen I just wanted to get rid of all that nerves amen praise the name of the Lord I just want to shake me loose amen hallelujah so so excited to be here amen and what an honor and privilege to be in the house of the Lord I want to greet uh the New Hope Revival family in the beautiful name of Jesus Christ I also bring special greetings from brother raus and his his wife sister Rona from Cape Town South Africa they have a lot of friends here tonight amen and they said I must just give my special greeting and they love to you uh they wanted to be here but I believe their hearts is with us here tonight I believe they're watching the service tonight so may God also bless them where they are and then from my church Brides Revival Ministry I also bring greetings it's also in Cape Town South Africa and I believe some of them also are watching tonight um in South Africa now it's 2:00 3:00 is it a.m. morning hours a.m. so it's 2 3:00 a.m. and there's some of the Believers that's up they said they can't miss the services they so desperate and that's what we need we need desperation amen is that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah we need to become desperate in this and time praise the name of the Lord so may God richly bless them all and a special greetings to Pastor Steven shy and sister Stacy from me and my wife we are so excited to be here uh um we are just thankful for them and being faithful to your calling if you were not faithful sir many many people would have never came to the knowledge of the message of the hour and we just want to say thank you to Pastor shy and sister um Stacy uh for standing on that calling um and being faithful to that calling because I'm one of them that basically got the revelation of the message when while Pastor sh was preaching I still had a tape amen it was called the prodical son in 2001 2002 I've listened to that tape and that was my final confirmation that this message is nothing but the truth amen and when when Pastor Shel was preaching about a prodical son I could see myself in the scripture amen you never became a son you were always a son always you were just lost I could see the whole message in that I could see spiritual Amnesia I could see predestination adoption I could see the manifestation of the sons of God I could see the plan for the Jews and the Gentiles because the youngest youngest son is the Jew is the is the Gentile and the Elder son that was never lost that was always in the house of the father is the Jews and so we were so excited and I'm telling you that blessed me and changed my life completely amen and I came in a message I'm so thankful I came that way in the message so I came in a supernatural way and I'm telling you I heard tapes and sermons like the transition from bride to wife for and letter rain and and all that type of sermons I'm telling you it changed my life it totally changed my life and it was a dream for us after 22 years we dreamed to be here you know the Bible says God make all things beautiful in his time not according to our time in his time and I'm so excited I have so much to tell you so much to say but but for the sake of time and we are here for the purpose to be a blessing and all those stes and you know we never had we we didn't have any money brother we didn't even had a dollar but your ministry sended all those tapes all over the world we received it for free we didn't have money and I've listened to those stes and it blessed me it changed me it made me a preacher that I am today and Cape Town is so blessed and many people we have over 250 people in our church it's not about about numbers but listen if one man can do his job like Pastor shy and stay faithful to his calling amen only if you bring one person but preach a sermon door indoors you are a door for somebody amen and by that and by Pastor sh's Ministry look how blessed our city is in Cape Town uh God is blessing us and I'm telling you our people is getting dreams and visions and amazing the supernatural the nine spiritual gifts is working the F we believe in the fivefold ministry and I'm telling you God is just blessing us but we never forget to put honor where honor is needed to be placed amen and but we only worship one person it's our Lord Jesus Christ is that right praise the name of the Lord I immediately want to go into the word of God and I just want to be a blessing if we can stand for the reading of the word of God we're going to go to the Book of Exodus chapter 3 Exodus chapter 3 I just want you to stand for those one scripture and I will read the other scriptures as well can you Exodus chapter chapter 3 we're going to read verse verse 6 Hallelujah are you happy to be here tonight I hope you're under expectation amen God is a god of variety oh yes oh brother gy Pastor sh was a blessing and like what he said last night be yourself amen praise God let's read verse six moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob I want you to see that and Moses hide his face for he was afraid to look upon God yes amen let's Us close our eyes for a word of prayer great Eternal heavenly father Jesus we come tonight with Revelation to you knowing who you are yes we are calling and pray praying to the god the author of the greatest book on the earth amen the word of the Lord amen and Lord this word is not just a written word but you are this word is a person yes we pray that the person of this word will come tonight yes and step out of this Bible and make yourself known to your people we pray that you will bless the the the word tonight and you will bless the servers heal the sick Lord God meet the needs of the people yes and so and prove yourself that you're still the same yesterday today and forever bless your word Bless the people tonight I'm asking it in Jesus name amen and amen can we say amen amen you may be seated I just want to read that again um it says moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abram the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob now I want you to follow real close here now because God is really revealing something to Moses here right God is speaking something and I want you to catch it I want you to see it because God is actually telling Moses I am I am God I am which means that I am a present tense God Amen praise the name of the Lord that um there is no past tense or future tense here he's telling us that he's a present tense God and he wants to be a present tense God you don't only want to be a god of History amen and there's a nice quote where brother Benham says people like to praise and worship God for what he did and they always look and praise and worship God for what he's still going to do in the future he said but they forget what God is doing right now and I'm talking about the I am God the present tense God and God is here tonight amen and the prophet says whenever he comes something good will take place do you believe it praise the name of the Lord but what here amen praise God so Moses I am the god of Abram Isaac and Jacob how can God be the I am God with people that's not I am that's people that's was right because you need to understand now God is telling him I'm a pleas tense God but I cannot be an I am God with the Ia servant right because Abram is no more right right Isaac is no more Jacob is no more these men are dead and God Is Yet God is saying I am the god of Abram Isaac and Jacob now if the sister can go to Matthew 22:32 I didn't put it up there but you can see something there and I want you to catch it tonight because Abraham is no more right Isaac is no more Jacob is no more they are all dead right so how can God God be an I am God with dead people right he cannot be a present tense god with people that's history I hope you see it these people are history they are no more present tense in the days of Moses they were already Abram Isaac and Jacob were already in the graveyard right but how can God be a I am God with the iash people he cannot but got to catch it now God is speaking to Moses now and God is speaking to Moses and in Matthew 22 uh 32 Jesus is also dealing with this he said did you hear that uh I am the god of Abram Isaac and Jacob and then he says I'm not the god of the dead right I'm the god of the living so what God was actually trying to tell Moses is I cannot be I am with Abram Isaac and Jacob because they are no more amen but Moses you are here oh my Moses you are alive Moses you are breathing and I cannot be I am God with people that's in the graveyard I need somebody that's alive oh I want you to see that I want you to see that because here's something deep here here's something deep here and I don't want you to miss it I want you to catch it you see there's people that would that that is trying to make God I am God with people that no more and God cannot manifest himself prove himself to be I am God with Abram Isaac and Jacob because they are history they are history brother and sister and and and you got to see this now I want that to soak into you you see Moses I was I am in in the days of Abram right I was I am in the days of Isaac I was that I am in the days of Jacob but for 400 years I was not that I am God because I couldn't find me a servant and he's actually asking Moses I would love to be I desire to be but I need somebody that's available to say yes Lord and amen for God to prove himself to be I am God for this day oh I hope you see it he he's looking for a bride he's looking for somebody he's looking for somebody in Atlanta or in Alabama Amen in Smith Station he's looking for somebody that can be a vessel amen that can say Amen Lord use me amen I need to be you want to be a present than God Amen I'm available to you oh my now watch you Moses he came to Moses now he said Moses um I need to become an I am God but I need a servant to prove to my people that I am still alive that I am the same yesterday today and forever that the god of Abram is still I am God the god of Isaac is still I am God the god of Jacob is still I am God you see brother and sister Moses my people need to I am God for Exodus there's no Exodus God first had to be I am God and if first had to be I am God to somebody God have to start somewhere God have a starting point God have a point on a place where he begins amen now watch here and he started with Moses he says Moses there cannot be an exodus with I was God but I can produce an exodus with if if I can become I am God hope you see it now now follow quickly now now my people Moses needs a I am God a present tense God for the present tense problems listen there's there's things that we have to deal with now there's things that Moses had to deal with that Abram never had to deal with ABR never had to go come on out to face Pharaoh Abram never had to go and to face amen janas and Jess he never had to go amen for a showdown and to challenge them now listen there was a present tense problem and God we needed a present tense God who a God that you've never experienced in that way they knew the testimony of Abram what God did through Abraham and what God did for Abram and what God did for Isaac and Jacob but listen we God is about to reveal another part of himself he's about to prove himself the god of the Exodus listen every problem we have today started in Genesis brother B says so every sickness every disease you're not the first one sometimes you feel you're the only one suffering or you the first one you're not the first one hello amen hallelujah all the problems you face today started in the Book of Genesis every devil every disease every trial every tribulation somebody in the Bible already went through it God already took somebody through [Applause] it oh come on now come on now now watch here now the devil and even God in the beginning couldn't do anything listen how the Bible starts in the beginning so after the word in chaos came and let me explain it before the word in the devil did nothing before the word in God did nothing so what I trying to say preacher amen whatever you go through you allow the devil to come in because only after the word in there was chaos Darkness now watch here now God told the devil you came in my Genesis and you started sicknesses diseases and problems so every problem came from the book of Genesis but God was about to reveal his second book and he said I'll call my second book Exodus so for every Genesis I will have a Exodus and exodus means I'm bringing you out you are coming out so whatever the devil put you in my God can take you out Hallelujah whatever sickness whatever Tri whatever storm whatever problem you are in my God is the god of the [Music] Exodus you will experience the I am God and you cannot have an exodus God works in three without the book of leius now Leviticus is a Levi a man sent from God I hope you see it so for so you cannot have listen now so for every Genesis there is an exodus and for every Exodus you need the Book of Leviticus so you need the Leviticus to give you an exodus out of your Genesis so whatever Genesis you are in tonight God can give you an exodus by the preaching of the word oh can somebody shout amen you got to you better prophesy I'm coming out I'm coming out whatever the devil put you in amen God is about to bring you out woo Lord now watch here now watch here Moses and he started the revealing to Moses brother say he he revealed to Moses the original sin he said Moses I cannot bring my people out as a historical God I cannot bring them out as a past tense God and I cannot bring them out as a future tense God I need to be a present tense God I need for the this I need to be I am now watch here for the I am for the present tense problem present tense sickness listen we have we are dealing with things in this last days that brother Bram never had to deal with that's right there's some new things the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise a standard I hope you are seeing it Amen brother never had to deal with cell phones and there's certain uh uh uh sicknesses and tactics of the devil although brother Brenham says the devil have nothing new right right oh my I hope you see it so there's things that we have to deal in the present tense right and I am God will not help you I was God cannot help you you need to know that I am God what God is doing right now where the move of God is and brother bam says God have a bride somewhere in the rising of the sun he says God there's Church and churches bride and bride but there's got to be a real bride somewhere and a brother he's using his bride that's why the last chapter in the Bible is Revelations chapter 22 and the last Ministry in Revelations 22:17 is the spirit and the bride say come so if you want to hear the spirit of God you need to find the bride you need to find the bride for your day you need to find the bride in your city you need to find the bride in your country you need to find the bride oh my now watch you I want you to see this um I cannot give you an exodus as I was God I need to be I am God and I want you to see that that's very very important for you to see so Abram Isaac and Jacob is history although brother brandham says history means it's his story all right it's still his story but history is history and then brother Brenham turns around he says but we have to take God out of history and that's what God wanted to do in Moses day he said listen Moses to my people I'm just a historical God they've heard what I did for Abram that's history in Moses day they've heard all the stories the supernatural stories how the supernatural God made himself known as Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa they knew all the stories oh my I want you to see it but yet they were in captivity they knew all the stories how God do powerful God but let me tell you a powerful historical God cannot help you all the quotes that they had about Abram Isaac and Jacob couldn't help them all the beautiful stories of this great God couldn't help them because they had a new challenge A new challenge and brother BR says God likes a man that can take the challenge and God was asking Moses I can you take this challenge I will be with you Moses amen and obviously amen they had a deal there Moses said listen God but what will I do this and what will I say who are you and this and this how will the people believe me and there was there was an agreement that God was about to prove himself as that I am God I want you to see this now watch yeah so I want you to see this now so God had a problem God had a big problem imagine because Abram was dead imagine Isaac was in the graveyard Jacob was in the graveyard and God had a problem because at that stage he was not a I am God to the people he was I was God he was a great historical God I want you to see that he said listen he said but I want you to understand I have a problem here Moses my problem is a I am problem isn't that the same problem we have in the message isn't it the same problem you know people are leaving the message people are falling this side this way people are asking questions you know where's the god of William Brenham yeah oh brother Brenham gave us an answer you need your personal experience I believe God is in the bride but he knows sometimes how to hide himself maybe it's God in Simplicity maybe he too simple for people and yet people can miss the great God in Simplicity that's why before the seals the great seals was revealed he preached a sermon called God hiding himself in Simplicity and God revealing himself in Simplicity he said sometimes people cry out God God where are God and they don't even know that God is in every blade of grass they're Hawking over God God is all around them and yet they miss God come on now I want you to see this I want you to see this so God had an I am problem God had the I Am problem and I cannot be I am what with I was servants I was people I was bride God is looking for a present tense bright brother you better know who you are in this day in this hour you better you better know where amen where God is moving in this day you better find out amen you better do some research and praying and seeking God you better seek God oh because people thought they had God and after 40 50 years they realize they never had God right you see bra says every day with Jesus is a new experience oh I need I need to know the god of today is not God is not good enough for the God for tomorrow right you see I need God every day every minute I need God I need him to be I am because every day you're going to have present tense problems I like what Jesus said Jesus said leave yesterday's problems for yesterday right today's problems is enough for today right no one day Paul he told Paul he said Paul my grace is sufficient for you you see for every problem there is Grace but sometimes we can mess with Grace because God can give you Grace for that day but if you take your problem to the next day there's no Grace for it why the Bible says his mercies are new every morning oh so for every problem of every new day God do have great and mercy for that day you need to embrace it and take hold of it and here God came to Abram he says listen Abram I cannot be I am God with Abra with Abram with Isaac and Jacob because they are history now follow quickly quickly I'm going to be quick I want to be quick and that means I want to be a I am God not a historical God oh I hope we don't have a historical God in the message I hope we don't have only a historical God and and and and and make museums and stuff what God did in in the 40s and 50s and 60s we honor God for that we even go so far back to the beginning we still honor God for Genesis right we still honor God for Abram which is the father of the faith we honor every man of God we ever we honor all the servants the seven Church eight Messengers we honor we honor each and every one of them but I'm trying to tell you what does God look like today not the god of yesterday because brother B says he revealed him in every Church age right in a certain way right oh my god there was a reward for every Church age right you need to understand the characteristics of God you know many people used to preach uh it's your season it's your season it's your season well you can be in a different season and I can be in a total other season so by preaching uh uh um it's your season it's your time it's your blessing am mean it doesn't always work like that right because our personal journey is not the same right maybe you're just coming out of Egypt and there's some people that's at kadis fer and there's a certain group of people that's already about to cross the Jordan right so there can be different seasons like Paul had to deal with Corinthians Ephesians Philippians different people on different levels yeah brother B says your personal walk is is in Shadow type is with Abram and your church walk is what how Israel came out of Egypt you see that that's a different walk your personal walk with God and your walk together as a church right you got to understand the seasons so God spoke to me and he said Don't Preach it's your season and he said preach finding God in your season there you go you need to understand how God looks in your season listen because sometimes you can look at another brother and it's all going well with him he's blessed his ministry is going forward everything is going everything he touches prosper and but with your life everything is going backwards and another brother next to you are so blessed he's got he's get he get promotions he's got a nice house he's got a nice car and yet but you go you lose everything it's because you in a to little different season and now you desire God to do for you what he's doing for the next brother but you see it doesn't work like that you need to understand how God looks in your season how God smells in your season how God talks in your season oh I hope you see it praise the name of the Lord you in a season where God normally take yourself right but there's coming a season where God is giving you back with job you know why all hell broke loose with job let me tell you now something let me tell you something the devil cannot attack you he needs permission from God brother says the devil have to go to the throne and ask God for permission to attack you you see sometimes the devil attack you then it's [Music] illegal you need to understand when the devil is legal and when he's illegal because he needs permission to attack you and you know what happened why all hell broke loose on Earth with job because God was bragging about job in heaven oh I wonder brother and sister when all hell breaks loose in your life just remember maybe God just bragged about you in heaven that's why all hell is breaking loose on the earth amen can God break about you in heaven praise the name of the Lord Brother says God had confidence in job although job had no confidence in himself but yet God trusted job the level of your trial tells me God is trusting you on that level now watch here so watch here I want you to see this so they had the historical God Amen and he said I cannot help them as a historical God and he came to Moses he says Moses my people is in trouble they have problems they are in sickness they in captivity Moses and I want you to understand Moses I need to be I am God I always want to be an I am God the all present God he wants to be present now watch here so Moses amen take me out of History take me out of the books take me out of the tapes bring God in plain view and God was about to manifest himself now watch here now God says listen I'm not a historical God I make history but I'm not history you better understand the difference between making history and God is Not history God make history but he not history he's always a present T God now watch here I want you to see this wow oh my Lord I make history I'm not history now BR says in a nice quote he says if God takes his man he never takes his Spirit that's right don't make the mistake don't make the mistake I I I um rebi once said the reason nobody knows where Moses was was buried is because if if Israel knew where God buried Moses they would have spent a lot of time around his grave yes they would have wasted a lot of time you [Applause] see you see God made Moses a amateure God and I want you to see that what they saw in Moses it was so close to worshiping Moses and God didn't have time to deal with that that's why God never revealed to them where he buried Moses brother don't waste your time sitting by a graveyard day and night because God can take his man but in never takes his Spirit he said his spirit will stay on the earth he will just find himself another servant and I'm telling you God do have a fivefold Ministry to produce I am God don't misunderstand me I respect the graveyard of the Prophet I went there in 2019 I do respect it amen but don't waste too much time listen we must be careful because God never wanted them to make that mistake when God put Moses in the graveyard it didn't mean they put God died with the man and that's what brother B said he said when when Wesley passed on he said they they organized around the man and God walked out that's he says he says uh uh Wesley will turn in his grave to see what his people is doing that's right he said and God divorced them and God moved on to Pentecost that's what he said and they organized them around Great Men listen God gives us powerful men and we thank God for powerful men but the powerful person is the Lord Jesus Christ he's not just the angel he's the mighty Angel he's the greatest Angel whoa brother and sister let me tell you something amen there don't don't make the mistake amen I hope we didn't made the mistake when we put the prophet in the grave that we put god with him in the grave we don't want I am God or I was God I don't know how you feel but I don't wonder I was God I need I am God there's different levels of exoduses that we need in our lives we need an exodus I don't know about you and to get the Exodus you need I am God brother amen watch here so God had a problem and God said Moses I need you to show the people that I am I am God and not the I was God now watch here Moses I need a I am servant a living servant right and I want you to see this because Israel had the eye wise God and the church as many times is sitting with the eye wise God when you go to many churches you will see in that church they they do the same thing for the last 100 years nothing new nothing changed like brother B says building in a straight line but when it comes to turning the corner you need a skill Mission we are changing Brothers it's it's it's uh it's times changing it's dispensations that's changing and we need to know how to turn the corner sir brother says when you listen to the to the rabbis I listen to another Rabbi and he said you know the pillow of fire brother says when the pillow of fire mov you need to move when the cloud move you need to move said he said yesterday's manner can be poisoned the next day give this day our daily bread that's the prayer Jesus said we ought to pray that's right and the rabbi said this he says he says why they moved in the in the during the day under a cloud was because the desert can become the hottest place right and they need it sa to travel so God was the cloud by day to protect them from the Sun and the rabbi said that cloud was like a air conditioner in the desert he said but but in the evening times the desert can become the coldest place on Earth and that's why he was a pillow of fire he was a heater in the evening but in the day he was a air conditioner so if you don't stay under the pillow of fire you die if you don't move you die oh the move is on sing the move is on my Lord the move is on move when the P of fire move move when your God move that's why many bride churches is divorced say if if the husband wants to go with his wife and she refuses him he can divorce her how many churches he said God divorced the westling Church yes he divorced he divorc the church if you don't allow him amen if uh to come into you because I mean he's your husband so you got to move when he wants you to move brother and sister now watch I need to be quick I need to be quick praise the name of the Lord uh he need to be I am God yes sir now watch here why amen why because the bride has some sicknesses that she have to deal with there's some sufferings there's some problems the bride is in chaos and the bride needs a I am God to read about the God that was will not help us says you need to find the word for your day the promise for your day the prophecy for your day the scripture for your day because the scripture for your day gives the anointing for your day amen that's why Jesus open the book read the portion of scripture and he said and the anointing is upon me yes this day this day so he read the scripture for his day and let me tell you Malachi 4 4 and 5 is beautiful and I thank God that he folded I thank God for Luke 17:30 I thank God for Matthew 17 I thank God for Revelation 10:7 but that was brother Brenham scriptures that's past tense come on but the bride needs to find her scripture her identity because you can only find it in this book brother let me give you one scripture Revelation [Music] 2217 the spirit and the bride say my are you ready to move the spirit is the I am God but there need to be a I am bride that says Lord I'm Available use me on oh I need to be quick we need that we need that we need that Lord we need that so he said I was I am I was I am God in Abraham's time I was I am God in Isaac's time I was I am God Amen in in in Luther's time in Wesley's time I was I am God in the Pentecostal dispensation I was I am God when I sent the seventh angel right right but tonight that's all I was God wants to be I am again on I hope you see it he want he wants to introduce himself again not as I was God he never introduces himself as I was God but he always introduced himself as I am God now watch here oh my Lord I'm excited I'm excited he's he's getting ready to introduce himself in 2023 will you be that vessel will you be that bright member to say Lord use me I need a manifestation of a I am God the god that's Hebrew 138 the same yesterday today and forever but let me quickly now watch now watch what the I am God does now I'm going to read a few scriptures to you watch what's happening let's go to Exodus chapter 5 I just want to I just want to show you something here Exodus chapter 5 W let's follow now Exodus chapter 5 if they can put it up amen Exodus chapter 5 let me just see here praise the Lord Exodus chapter 5 let's read it quickly and afterwards Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh thus say the Lord God of Israel this is after he said I am God and he's about to reveal himself he says let my people go before that nobody could could face pharoh and say Pharaoh let God's people go and I hope you see it I'm not going to continue there because uh he said let my people go that they may hold the feast I don't know if you know but the but but God took them out with the feast God continued The Exodus with the feasts the the the feast is our Exodus it's our Redemption and brother says the seven feasts is the type of seven Church ages listen the church started with the feasts right and the church WIll Church ages will end with Feasts amen don't miss it now you mustn't Miss God's Feast sir amen because God is keeping his people together with his Feast he knows how to bring his people together with his Feast amen and I want you to see that I don't want you to miss that praise the name of the Lord watch here watch here and the feast the word Feast we know means appointment right Pastor s show does that the feast means God's appointment and God had seven appointments with Israel and he had seven appointments with the seven Church ages I hope you see it I hope you see it yes sir oh and and he's the I am he says I am the I am of the Feast of Passover I am the I am of the feast come on now yes of UNL bread I am the I am of the feast amen of first fruits yes I am the I am of the feast amen of Pentecost and God already fulfilled those four feasts and he still fulfill it brother bam says Jesus always keeps his appointments God always keeps his appointments you got to discern the seasons and the times you got to discern the seasons and the times God always keeps his appointments now listen he's he's he already fulfilled the the Feast of Passover right but he still fulfilling the Feast of Passover that's right because there's still people coming to the blood exactly there's still people applying the token and listen my God is still fulfilling the Feast of Passover he already fulfilled it in the first CH but he's still fulfilling it he still keeps his appointments because there's still people that needs to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so God is a god of his appointments he never misses his appointments but I want you to see the scripture watch here you can put it up again my sister uh he says let my people go and I want us to prophesy tonight prophetically we want God we want to tell Phar for of this day right whatever level fu is in your life whatever f is in your family whatever f is in your church whatever f is in your company whatever phars there are in the message God wants to deal with all the Phar of this day now watch here he says let my people go and I want you to pronounce it in whatever level in whatever are area in your life where there's a pharaoh ruling you prophetically tell him let my people go maybe your daughter your husband there's a Phar that's holding your husband your daughter in captivity but tonight we pronounce and we say Let My People Go but we want to go further than that let the bride goes I don't care what church is holding the bride captive I don't care what son is holding the bride captive tonight prophetically we say let the bride go now watch here put the other scripture on my sister watch you let my people go that's Exodus 5 let's go to Exodus 11 Exodus 11 verse1 and the Lord said unto Moses yet will I bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt afterwards he will let you go listen now so I want you to catch it it's from let my people go go to he will let you go he will let you go I hope you see it listen it's from for six times I was I was studying the scripture six times God sent Mo sent Moses to pharaoh to tell him let my people go six times but the seven time he went in in Exodus 11 and he said listen Fu you will let my people go so we want to take it from let my people go and we want to prophesy you will let the people go listen God is a god of warning there's there's always warning before judgment so for six times God warned Phu but the seven time God brought judgment he said you will let my people go and I want to prophesy your husband will come your daughters will come the devil cannot hold them back God will redeem [Applause] them watch [Applause] here so it's Let My People Go Let My People Go God was nice God said let my people go let my people go God gave a plague Pharaoh didn't listen he says let my people go and then God says you will Moses tell Pharaoh this time he will let my people go and I'm telling you tonight the devil will let the bride go wherever and in whatever sin whatever fu is holding them captive God will set them free let my people go so watch here now amen let my people go so Moses you need to understand Let My People Go means can I have 10 minutes Pastor just 10 minutes let my people go means it this is what it means Moses not everybody in Egypt is my people that's it that's exactly right not everybody that's that's on this world or on this Earth is God's people that's right not everybody that goes to church is God's people and not everybody in the message is God's people remember Moses my focus is God's people we know ABR made that mistake brother picked it up God asked Abram to go he took lot with him right A Time waster right one day I preached on the angel is dealing with time Wass where the where the Bible says in Revelation 10:4 time shall be no more in Greek it means without delay without wasting of time right God needs to deal with some time waster in your life God have a calendar God have a watch God have a schedule and you need to keep up with the schedule you cannot allow any family member any brother in church any circumstance or any sickness to hold you back from moving when God moves and God is now dealing with some time Wass in the message Hallelujah do it he's dealing with some phara in the message now watch here let's go let's go let's go quickly so Moses you need to understand that not everybody in Egypt is my people not everybody in the church world not everybody in the message is my people I I can only be I am to my people I will never be I am God to people that's not mine like brother says he didn't even die for the world he died for those names that was in the Lamb's Book of lifea where did you get that scripture in John 17 where he says father I pray for them that's in the world not not for the world so he prayed before he went to the Cross he never prayed for the world oh brother God is not wasting one drop of blood God is not wasting time but right now God is dealing with time wasters in the message in your life at your job y your family members your circle of friends wherever they might be God is dealing with some time waster God came to Moses said Moses I have a set time tell Phu I have a set time an appointed time I allowed him to rule over Israel but his time is up oh the handwriting is on the hall hallelujah oo the gentle desination is coming to an end let me just quickly go quickly quickly quickly now what Moses not everybody in the message so Moses tell pharaoh to let my people go and prophetically we are doing that tonight amen let God's people go oh my watch here my God and that is for the bride I

Fu go ask Fu nicely go ask Fu please let God's people go please please please we need to be bold like a lion listen Moses went in there with the I am God he had confidence he experienced the I am God he saw the I am God and he had confidence to go in there he had boldness to face F he never asked him God never said go ask Fu God said go tell Fu and tonight we don't ask the devil we tell the devil we're not asking sickness to leave we don't ask the devil to leave we are telling tonight we are telling the devil you get out of here let God's people go whatever DRS whatever situation whatever sickness they in you let the Bride of Jesus Christ go let the people go let my bride go amen no F no stronghold I don't care how big your power or big the country Egypt was how powerful it was the I am God said let my people go and brother you better give away he never said go ask he said telling him let my people go to worship me with the feast let them worship me with the feasts that's good watch here that's good let them worship me in spirit and in truth that's it and that was the feast that's it m oh because all they know was worldly feasts the Egyptian feasts but God introduced God's feasts to them and here we are in our appointed time amen isn't it amazing that we that God gave me this Revelation that I am God and we are in the Feast of Tabernacles where God is present God is tabernacling in his bride God Is With [Applause] Us oh in that song that Pastor sh always sing you might not feel him but he's here you might not see him but I'm telling you he's here he's here oh I can feel him I can experience him amen and I know he's here so watch here I want to come to a close I want to come to a close but watch here watch here watch here watch here amen don't ask him tell him and I'm telling every Pharaoh that's holding the Bride of Jesus Christ in captivity whatever Problem whatever stress whatever sickness whatever sorrow whatever pain whatever problem I'm prophesying let God's bride go we're not asking you we demand you in the name of the Lord and we prophesy you will let the bride [Applause] go amen we're not in a business deal with the devil we're not in we not doing a business deal with the devil oh Jesus already had business with him on Calvary right right and now we can look back to Calvary and just claim so we're not asking we are commanding right we are commanding them let God's people go now watch here I'm going to end off here let my people go prophetically means two things when Moses went to pharaoh and said let my people go it meant they were in the wrong place right right you cannot tell somebody let that person go where to so it means that Israel was in a place where they're not supposed to be that's right that's right so when he went to Pharaoh he said let God's people go it means God's people people is in a place where they're not supposed to be and tonight there's bride members that's in places and they don't belong there and prophetically we want to release that word and wherever they are tonight and whatever Pharaoh is there we want to tell them we want to tell the devil these people don't belong here because what Moses was actually telling them is God's people don't long here how can you say let God's people go it means they're in a place where they're not supposed to be and they are also in a situation where they're not supposed to be we can preach all day about that and they are also in a condition that they're not supposed to be in I mean look at the condition of the Bride look at the situation that the devil is putting you in so whatever place the devil is holding you captive in whatever situation he's holding you captive and whatever condition you in brother Brenham told us to never live under our god-given privileges so tonight we we declare let the bride [Applause] [Music] go so listen we're not in a place where we should be we're not in a condition and situation where we ought to be he says Satan he says Fu my people this is not my plan this is not the place where I want my people this is not the situation that I want my people to be in God have a permissive will and God have a perfect will for them to be in Egypt and where they are is only permitted that's right but it's not God's perfect will but brother Brenham says when the perfect will of God comes the permissive will must give away now watch here we have the perfect will of God this is the season this is the time it's the Feast of Tabernacles God wants to be in the midst of his people and God wants his people to worship Him in spirit and in [Applause] truth now watch here so Point number two so Point number one my people is in a place where they're not supposed to be so I hope it s's in My bride is in a place where they're not supposed to be the devil is putting my people in places you might you might you might have a job it's not that's not what God meant for you that's not the best God have for you you might live in a house now I'm going to take this in every level now in every level you might drive a car that God never intended you to drive with a a car with a lot of problems you might stay in a small house but that's not God's perfect will come on you work a job where you pay a salary that can you cannot live with it you cannot survive with it so so you in a place in a condition in a situation where the devil put you in and God wants Satan to let God's people go you see God have a better job the devil is holding you back he's holding your promotion back he's holding your salary back the increase on your salary he's holding your new house back he's holding your new car back he's holding your business back but tonight we prophesy let the bride [Applause] go we have a inheritance we want what God have in store for us we have to have faith to claim it I hope somebody can claim it tonight don't love under your god-given privileges Lord you know we were in an old Pentecostal Church Old Pentecostal people believed you to be humble you need to be poor you cannot be rich otherwise you will you will leave God but listen let me tell you before God is going to Rapture his bride he's going to bless his bride he's going to prove to his bride I am means I am means whatever you need me to be I can be that if you need food I am the bread of life if you need water amen I am that auor oh I hope you see it I'm the living Au whatever you will need God to be he's the he said I am that that's why he never said I am this and this he just said I am so whatever you need God tonight to become if you want God to be a Healer I am the Healer if you want God to be the Redeemer I am the Redeemer if you want God to be the provider I am the provider oh come on bride we need to praise him for that that I am God the musicians can [Applause] come oh so my people is in places the M can come they're in situations conditions the devil put you in conditions places situations it doesn't mean that's God's perfect will for you it doesn't mean that that's your destiny because our destiny is adoption right and adoption is why Christ speak right amen whatever you need you can speak right even when brother Brandon wanted to squir oh he could have he could speak it into existence whatever you need God through the spoken creative word that's our inheritance amen your God given privileges amen so Point number one when he says Let My People Go it means they're not in in the wrong place they're in wrong conditions wrong situations and point number two it means god do have a place and God do have a situation for you and there is certain conditions that you need to be in but not what the devil is having what the devil put you in and I want you to see that it's absolutely important to see that God have a place for his bride he does God God needs wants to put you in a different situation in a Godly situation where every day you find yourself in a god situation in a god condition in a Godly place so you say Let My People Go they know they not in they're not in a place where they should be and you are holding my people back and there's a set time and I can feel by the spirit of the Lord New Hope Revival it's time for you as a forerunning church yes it's time the set time is now the devil cannot hold back those promotions those breakthroughs that promised Revival where we there will be no sicknesses in the bride yes we will need nothing yes we will lack of nothing that place that God have in store for us but listen Fu lastly if you don't let my people go I will destroy your country they can play something softly if it's okay I want to tell you this God will destroy every Pharaoh in your life I don't care how big how powerful how rich I don't care how big that church is I don't care what message Church it is I don't care whatever pharoh there is I'm not talking to every message church I'm talking to people that playing a role of a Phu withholding the people of worshiping God in spirit and in truth yes amen keeping the people away from their inheritance keeping them away from the Feast of Pentecost keeping them away from their Pentecostal experience keeping them a way of all the feasts of God where God wants to redeem them the feast is God God give you exodus by his fa by his Feast the Feast of Passover was The Exodus and the other Feast is to call you together to keep you the continuation of The Exodus happened with the feasts and that's why Israel although naturally but it have a spiritual meaning to us yeah different levels of Revelation in those feasts yes sir but says God is fulfilling the Feast of Tabernacle in the seven seal and he's still going to fulfill it so there's different levels of the Fulfillment whatever God have in stored for me I want that brother I want to tell you I don't care how big how strong that Pharaoh is God will destroy a country he destroyed Germany for the Jews God destroy he will destroy a city if you don't let his people go God will destroy a community if you don't let his bride go God will God will destroy a church if if you don't let the bride go God will destroy a message church if you don't let his bride worship the way she should worship God don't hold my people back don't hold God's people back Jesus and I'm honest now I'm finishing off here Pastor shy I'm finishing off with this let God's bride go you see the serpent in the beginning what he did so I'm taking it from let the people go let Israel go to letting God's bride go because Israel and the church goes together the journey is the same the journey is the same the prophet says it now watch here I want you to see this so he says let God's bride go what the serpent did he never came for for for for Adam he came for Adam's bride he took Adam's bride in captive he had her in captivity and God I want you to see it and that's why from there the devil came to Abram's bride and he took her in captivity with unbelief right I want you to see what the devil is doing he's after the bride jiah's bride was in the prostitute house he hold her in captivity they even wanted to hold Isaac's bride back that's the plan of the enemy is to hold the bride back and I'm telling you the devil is after Jesus bride amen he's after the Bride of Jesus Christ he's trying to hold her in captivity he's trying to hold her back from a god-given privileges now watch here but tonight we pronounced that let God's bride go you know what God did he came down he came for a for for Adam's bride and he said let Adam's bride go God came down to the King when he wanted to sleep with Abram's bride God came in that bedroom and he said let Abram's bride go come on God told oiah to go to the prostitute house and knock on the door and said let my wife go and I'm telling you in this end time Jesus himself is knocking on the door Jesus Christ himself is here Jesus Christ himself is saying let my bride go Satan will not asking you in the name of the Lord we telling you whatever wrong situation wrong condition wrong place God's bride is in we pronounce they are free tonight they are delivered tonight
