Description:
"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled." 2 Corinthians 10:4-6

single service and his presence came and we're very thankful for that jesse washington i'm glad to see you lord bless you we're glad that you're here i kept hearing rumors and here you see it they tell me this is sister jada's parents back here we're so glad that they're with us today the lord bless you [Applause] glad that they're among us we're glad to be uh home now the hawkson's got home since i've been here and and so i welcome them i know they've already been welcomed but we're glad that they're back and then i see austin and stephen and i'm glad to see them today the lord bless you all of you that are here i'm glad to see you i'm glad to be among you all of you that are streaming we send the lord's blessings to you and anything that you need i know the lord is our provider god bless you praise god this song that i'm about to sing it's been on my heart for a long time and sunday i felt confirmation that i should sing it and i'mma give a little bit of a maybe an exhortation and explanation at the same time when brother shelley was reading and preaching out of numbers 14 this verse verse 9. i'm gonna read seven through nine but verse nine was a confirmation for me because of a verse in the song that i'd been you know kind of struggling with and it says and they spake unto all joshua and aaron talking spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to spy it out is it exceeding good land if jehovah delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it unto us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not against jehovah neither fear ye the land neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is removed from over them and jehovah is with us fear them not and i have a feeling i was just pondering this all week i texted pastor and told me i want to sing this and i was pondering this verse and i have a feeling that joshua and caleb knew what report they were going to give before they even left before they even came back you know before they were sent they they knew the word of the lord and they went in with faith you know and that's how we have to be you know our battle starts when we enter the land and that's when their battle started and they didn't care i don't think that they would have mattered even if the report was that they were grasshoppers i feel like joshua and caleb would have said the same thing you know and then this thing about giants i was reading in samuel as well and david goliath wasn't the only giant that david and his men killed he had more than one giant to kill and samuel 21 22 second samuel 21 22 says these four warriors were descended from the giant in gath and they fail by the hands of david and his servants and i feel like i've had giants to fight in my life and i feel like we all have and i'll just like to encourage you to keep pressing on and keep fighting [Music] so [Music] for battle [Music] [Music] for [Music] you're an army just [Music] they are mighty through [Music] [Music] [Music] you're an army [Music] you're an army [Music] [Music] we [Music] we [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] he's [Music] we are [Music] you're an army [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah just a little softer i want to tell you something while they just keep the beat just keep that going just a minute david didn't tell you this but he was scheduled to be gone with ashley for a few days holiday for texas and they have to take it when ashley can get it and he was so convinced that he was supposed to sing this song that they canceled their vacation trip to texas there's a whole other story that we won't get into but the enemy really fought them in another way to discourage them they thought well i'll just tell it they thought well we'll go camping for a couple days and they get out on the highway and one of the horses they call dogs jumped out of the jumped out of the vehicle and ended up fracturing a part of his leg and will have perhaps have to have surgery so i believe that that kind of proves to us that he was being obedient we've been talking about radical obedience now i don't read this lightly but this is a scripture here that is baffling to me but i believe the lord wants me to read it into the atmosphere this is psalm 74 hallelujah psalm 74. god is my king verse 12 for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the waters thou breakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gave us him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness sing it again [Music] so [Music] [Music] you're an army [Music] you're an army [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] we got off the giant foreign [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] take the land [Music] take the land take the land you see i i believe what the lord is saying is that leviathan in the bible it's the same same kind of intimidating spirit that was on those giants and you know leviathan represents a twisting spirit that twists the truth that tries to pervert the truth and i believe i heard the lord saying that what was meant to take you under [Music] what the enemy has sent to take you under god's gonna give you the victory over it if you'll just claim it i don't care what it is i don't care if it's depression or suicide or some kind of sickness or lying spirit or some kind of addiction or doesn't matter what it is i believe the lord is saying that what the enemy intended to take you under god's going to let you stand on top take that victory that belongs to us it's ours it's ours [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah good job david thank you for sharing that with us and we're thankful to the lord that he's got it and he's put us right in the middle of this battle and he gave us all of the armor that we need to cut off the giant's head amen you may have your seats once again today we're going to receive the tithe and the offering part of our worship unto the lord the tithe belongs to him and then he offers to us a declaration to prove him by giving of our tithe and offering and we want to do exactly that we're demonstrating to him that he is our provider and he demonstrates to us that he is and so we want to give of our tithe and offering today we want to thank you that as of right now you have given two hundred and thirty eight thousand five hundred and twenty four dollars and seventy eight cents toward the mortgage of this property toward the principle of the mortgage of this property we want to thank the lord for that now while i was away i was told a pastor told me that there was a man that he knew that had bought a business for a million dollars and he worked it for several years and he sold it for four million dollars and he paid off this pastor's house and he paid off the church i believe that by our obedience we're going to see the same kinds of things i believe this so i thank you that you have pressed in with us the the mortgage renews next month uh and so we are still giving to this if you have anything that you want to give you can give it at any time we will again take an offering on i believe it's the 4th of september but we're just going to receive the tithing offering today and allow you to give as unto the lord while i'm mentioning this there has been an event that has been put in motion for labor day weekend and i'm calling for laborers on labor day weekend brother joshiantis has already put in motion the equipment that is needed so that we can get the water rerouted to quit running across the asphalt parking lot all those red stains that you see because the ditches have filled up with sediment and so forth and it's already been put in motion the equipment has been donated as long as joshua is operating it and we want to thank the lord for that but we need laborers that sometimes you can look like a state worker just leaning on a shovel but there'll be other times that he's going to need you to operate that shovel so he doesn't have to get on and off the equipment so if you are a a man in this church and you can help us on saturday maybe starting friday night i don't know but saturday and monday of that weekend we would surely appreciate it and if you sisters that may bring us lunch to uh so that we don't have to run off we can eat something kind of light and keep right on working but we want to everything for that event has been paid for so that's taken care of all right so we just want to thank the lord for that as soon as we know that that is taken care of by god's grace we would like to be able to get money together before camp meeting to have this the surface of this parking lot redone and repainted i'm looking to the lord to provide for that i'm looking for the lord to do that because we're we're we're maintaining what he has given us that's what we want to do we're maintaining what he has given us so if you brought your tithe and offering with you today we want to give you that opportunity to give to the lord david will you help me brother austin hodges will you help us well we'll let these brothers come to you let me pray over it our father i want to thank you for faithful people the ones that are here the ones that are on the stream lord people that we don't even know that send uh gifts into this ministry because their lives have been touched by the word of god i thank you for it now lord as they give today as your people give today lord we want to bless them i know that there's been giving all week online and we bless your people in the wonderful name of jesus christ i pray lord that you will pour it back in and may what is given be multiplied for the purposes of the kingdom of god will

hallelujah god is good well uh joseph stand up let everybody see you today is joseph's birthday he turned 13 years old today let's say happy birthday to joseph benjamin uh did such a fabulous job leading worship today he put everything in it stand up so everybody can see you again get up he turned 24 today my our baby turned 16 yesterday sorry someone is calling me from africa and i accidentally accepted the call so i'm i've just rudely deleted so i didn't mean to do that i wasn't sure exactly how to handle that but anyway uh our baby turned 16 yesterday and our oldest turns 24 today and this is his first birthday as a married man and he looks like he's managing it pretty good and and jenna they're making it so uh happy birthday to him i know all you parents feel the same way it seems like yesterday you know when our kids were little all the seniors and older ones sorry brother can't talk uh all the seniors and the older ones would come over to the table in the restaurant and they would say you know hug them love them while they're little you know they're going to grow up so fast and that would kind of get on my nerves at times you know it would just just constantly they're saying that you better love them now they're going to grow up it's going to go by so quick but in that moment you're so you're so thrilled and you you don't even want to think about them growing up and you know what now i'm that person now i go around to the tables when i see a sweet little family and i say hold them tight they grow so fast and it's just the truth you know as parents we only get one opportunity just one chance to raise them right to raise them in church to raise them in the things of god and we can't lead them with our words we have to lead them by example so may god strengthen every parent to do just that because the the hour is short we we are certainly approaching the coming of the lord i i wanted also to to say that on tuesday of this week is ashley's birthday and she was playing the piano isn't it wonderful to see her stepping up into her talent and helping like she did this morning god bless you it's also brother richard ellsworth's birthday on tuesday and we still love him and we miss him and we pray for him and it's also the lewis's wedding anniversary brother donovan and sister audrey and i i haven't told you all but uh maybe we made some mention of it but brother donovan was on his way to texas for benjamin and jenna's wedding and i don't know if you know this or not but his motor blew up on his car and he called from shreveport and he said pastor i i've been out on the highway all day stranded and and there's no way i'm going to make it to the wedding i'm just trying to figure out how to get home and uh you know it was just a real a real interesting thing god sent two men finally to to pick him up and take him to their home and give him a little something to eat and some refreshment and let him use the phone and you know that just this seems like that don't happen that often these days he began to talk to him about coming out for the wedding and disappointed he wouldn't get to be there and he began to testify to him about the lord and the next thing you know he tells them about our ministry and the app and he's watching them download the app you know you don't ever know why people meet the way they do but you know we really it really bothered us and we went to prayer and we began to say to brother donovan we're going to believe god to make this thing right well i want you to know it was eventually made right he had to wait a while to get it made right but it has now been made right and uh kia the dealership there working with the manufacturer they they flew brother donovan back to shreveport to pick up a vehicle put a brand new motor in that vehicle under warranty and he said brother shelly that vehicle drives better than it did when it was brand new so you know god took care of that he took care of that for him he was so happy oh my that's just the goodness of the lord we haven't seen brother matthew and sister caleb a little bit now but brother matthew drost has a birthday on wednesday of this week so we want to say happy birthday to him i saw on my calendar where brother george smith has a birthday on friday so any of you that have have a way of harassing him on friday i encourage you to do so uh i certainly do every year and and will and then on saturday is uh it's talia's birthday where where is where is tally stand up well we can't see you but she's standing up how old is talia going to be five years old we mostly call her tally but since i had the privilege of watching pollyanna movie with her i call her taliana and so she turns five on saturday so let's say happy birthday to taliana also sister naomi in the netherlands uh originally halls has a birthday on saturday and they're often streaming our services and support the ministry here so we want to say happy birthday to them and we're just thankful to be a family even though the miles separate us i want you to stand if you will i know you've been up and down i want you to thank god for the musicians and everything the giving the worship leading playing the guitars and pianos and aaron on the camera and luke and levi back there and joshua and sister charity and brother austin has been up there working and brother hawk you know we just appreciate what you all do for the services and the streamers appreciate it we have a host of people i i couldn't take the time to call the nations that are represented here this morning but if i'm looking right there's there's over 25 nations that are represented in the stream just a handful of us here but several handfuls across the nations watching the service and we are thankful for that god is just good isn't he would you turn in your bible to second corinthians chapter 10 i want to begin reading in verse 4 and i don't want to disappoint anybody but the the spirit of god just arrested me over the weekend and and i i'm not able to go forward in what we were starting but we will as soon as we have the release of the lord to do so we will do some more teaching on the gifts of the spirit and specifically uh the administration of the gift of of tongues we know that god uses these things and we believe in them and we just want what god wants you know there are a lot of churches that believe that all these things are over with but but my bible tells me that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever it says he changes not and if god ever did it he's still able to do it today he still heals the sick how many of you has ever healed your body you know i mean he's baffled the doctors for some of you in your life the doctors say i have no explanation there's sister beth back there dead on the table and god gave her her life back so she's going to tell you that he's still a healer and you just put your trust in him and it'll be all right but the lord wouldn't let me go any further and i'm going to go back into at least one service today on a subject that that i think will be helpful to you if you were here when we brought it originally uh let me ask you this has anybody ever seen a an episode of andy griffith more than one time oh my goodness my children memorized them you'd have to tell them to hush because they'd be doing barney's lines you know or or the waltons or little house on the prairie we've turned the lights off at night and said good night john boy you know and so if you've ever how many of you have ever had a film watched a film more than once a movie more than one time all right so you don't have anything to complain about that i'm going to go back and give you a little bit of the word that i have already shared with you second corinthians chapter 10 verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare somebody said i don't understand that warfare talk what's that boy doing up there waving a sword around and talking about eating giants that just grosses me out well we're in a warfare there's a battle that's raging between the forces of good and the forces of evil and i got good news for you church the little bride of jesus christ she wins she wins if you don't believe that read revelation 19 we're coming back with him one day the scripture said so for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing has your imagination ever run wild you know it's not a curse to have a vivid active imagination but it has to be sanctified because that imagination will take you to all kinds of places you don't need to go right this is why pornography's stealing our nation that's why it's plaguing our churches that's why it's destroying marriages because people haven't learned to sanctify their imagination and they're letting fantasy take them right into the very dregs of sin you've got to sanctify your imagination you've got to live in reality you can't live in that video game all the time anybody going to say amen you got to live in reality the word of god casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity i want to hear you help me with that next those next two words i want to hear you say them every every thought that's all all means all that's all every one of them bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ you crazy thought you are going to bow your need to the sovereignty of jesus christ when the enemy lies to me i'm going to have to grab a hold of that and wrestle that down and submit it and subject it to the truth of jesus christ bringing into air into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience but that's not all it says when your obedience is fulfilled you better make sure you're obeying the lord before you call someone else into accountability come on now we're not judging one another's motives in this hour it's not our place we can we can judge behaviors but we can't judge motives when jesus said judge not that you be not judged you look at that in the greek he is telling you you cannot tell what's in somebody else's heart and when you think you can tell what's in somebody else's heart you're you're absolutely going against the commandments of jesus christ now i want to give you one more verse before you're seated and they don't have it i didn't give it to them but i want to read galatians 5 and verse 1. i thought of it while i was here on the platform and i i grabbed my bible and they got it quicker than i could even find it here it says stand fast stand fast therefore in the liberty somebody say liberty we're with christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage i want to read it all again stand fast therefore in the liberty where with christ have made us free i want to know if i'm preaching to any free people here today no longer slaves free why because of the blood of jesus christ no longer slaves to sin why because of the blood of jesus christ redeemed how why by the blood of jesus christ not by my goodness not my by my works but only by the blood of jesus stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage how many of you can see that old yolk that they were putting on the ox in years gone by driving them into the field that old heavy heavy log laid across their shoulder i'm telling you that's a heavy burden to bear it is not the will of god for you and i to bear that heavy burden we have been set free by the blood of the lamb and it is up to you and i to maintain the liberty to maintain the freedom that christ has purchased for us how many of you follow your preacher this morning father in the name of jesus christ we thank you for that liberty we thank you for that blood lord we we didn't deserve it we still don't deserve it but salvation is not of works lest any man should boast it is the gift of god we are saved today because you gave us the gift and lord we ask that you will help us to maintain the freedom and the liberty that you have given us by the blood of the lamb we ask for grace to deliver your word to your people in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated just as i was ending that prayer my eyes fell on a greeting here from the capital city of zimbabwe we greet you brother in the name of the lord in harare zimbabwe god bless you thank you for joining us today i want you to know that freedom is paid for by the blood of jesus christ he whom the son sets free is what free indeed that doesn't mean just a little bit free free indeed is an ultimate freedom you don't have to be a slave to anybody or anything there are people that we bump into every day in our lives that are slaves they're slaves to something they're driven by something or by somebody and because of the blood of jesus you do not have to be a slave to your emotions you don't have to be a slave to your thoughts you don't have to be a slave to your imagination you don't have to be a slave to your circumstances you don't have to be a slave to addictions or habits he whom the son sets free is free indeed you can have a clean mind you don't have to live in the gutter you don't have to live in the fantasy of pornography i'm going to hit it again you can live in reality god can give you a satisfaction in your sex life if you're a married person that you don't have to dig into that filth and if you're a single person the lord can give you the victory that you need to possess your vessel in sanctification there's no good excuse for pornography it it binds people it pushes people with guilt and with condemnation you do not have to be a slave to inferiority complexes you don't have to be a slave to any complex you don't have to be paranoid that everybody hates you let me tell you something somebody does you're living in la la land if you think everybody likes you preach brother everybody don't like you i don't care how likable you are somebody don't like you so you just need to go ahead and accept that and keep walking on for jesus come on you're not waiting on somebody to like you or to give you their vote of approval for you to serve the lord you're just going to serve him because he's been so good to you [Music] and you're going to tell somebody because you just can't keep it to yourself and you know you're not going to be haughty you're not going to be arrogant but you need to sometimes make up your mind if if he doesn't like me that's his problem he don't want my fellowship that's his problem i don't mean to get arrogant i don't think you should get haughty but sometimes you just have to say that's her loss somebody said don't that sound a little hot it can so don't get under that don't act like you're somebody because without him none of us we're not worth the salt papa used to say they're not worth a salt on their bread you're not worth a salt on your bread if you don't know jesus christ your life is a wreck without him now i'm not talking about sunday religion i'm not talking about christmas and easter religion i'm talking about a day-to-day salvation a day-to-day walk of redemption and talk about surrendering your life to the lord every single day desiring to please him you don't have to be a slave to anger you don't have to live in a house with holes in the wall because you can't control your anger hello you can be free i don't want to live in that you don't have to mistreat your wife you women don't have to abuse your husbands i'm just going to drink me some water up in here because we're free the blood of jesus frees us you don't have to be a slave to your past who is that i don't even know who that man was who are you talking to me i don't even remember that guy hallelujah all things have passed away paul said behold all things have become new that's what jesus is doing in people's lives you're sitting in a church today where there are former hookers where there are former drug addicts where there are former alcoholics i don't want to go any further but let me tell you some more than that is represented except for the fact that those people don't exist anymore there are testimonies in this room right now that can never be told i know some oh that makes me want to jump off this platform and fly that's what jesus can do he can save you from such a wrecked filthy life that you can't even tell anybody how far he's brought you because you don't want to run the risk of of hindering them in their relationship i don't believe in glamorizing sin i used to tell some of the old preachers that would get up and tell about their moonshine days and their and their thunder road days running from the law and and i'd say to them come on fellers i even spoke to spoke to bootlegging billy andrews one time and i said brother billy you ought to see them kids on the front row when you talk about running from the law their eyes get big and it sounds like excitement i want you to know there's no excitement in having to look over your back everywhere you go afraid that somebody you've done wrong is going to blow your head off there's no freedom in the hat there are people in this room and represented on this stream that have been in gangs that have run guns that have run drugs or you're just making this up i'm not there are people represented here that have touched things they should have never touched taken things they should have never taken said things they should have never said come on but we are not those men and women anymore because we are freed by the blood of the lamb saved by the blood we're not who we are because we join the church because church will fail you preachers will fail you pastors will fail you sunday school teachers will fail you denominational structures will fail you but jesus never never ever fails hallelujah he will never make you a promise that he can't keep if he said it whether you believe it or not if he said it it's true it settles it he's just as alive today as he was in mary's womb he's just as alive today as when he raised the dead when he called lazarus from the grave after his body was already stinking and rottening he's just as alive and able today to heal and to help and to bless as he was when he walked the shores of galilee and cleansed the leper and caused blind eyes to be open he's the same god and he is not a god of eternity he's not a god of somewhere out there in history he's a personal savior he's a personal god i wonder if my friend i have a friend here i mean we're not friends i don't know him but i've got somebody that's been after me a couple weeks now for yelling so i thought i'd just start off yelling today he said do you have to yell no i don't have to do a lot of things i don't have to change socks but it feels good i don't have to shower every day but it feels good and sometimes it just feels good to let it out brother sister he has been so good to me i could never tell at all he reached down and comforted my heart in my childhood watching my mother be physically abused and running at times for our life and the goodness of god protected me and kept me he filled me with the holy ghost when i was seven years old and he kept me from a life of sin i only ever had to punch one person in my life aren't i blessed only had to and i was already preaching the gospel when i did that oh i can hear the critics now let me come see if any of them typing to me i did i i was in i was in school and this i i i would i would call his name but he might see this because we're friends on facebook he and i we're friends with big hurt frank thomas i'll call frank's name some of you might know him if you don't you can look it up he was a sports star and this young man we were mutual friends i was of a different race as either one of them but we nothing mattered you know and this guy decided that he was gonna he was gonna have me to take a pill he said you can't even say you have experienced life until you have tried what is out there and he was going to force me to and he harassed me and he made fun of me and he laughed at me and he pushed at me and he caught me one day in the bathroom in school and he said i'm you are too he said i've got a i got a bottle here and you're going and i want you to know the truth is i'm embarrassed to tell this i better get out of the pulpit to tell it i've closed my eyes and i said lord jesus help me to knock him out and you know what he did when i realized that he was unconscious i throwed myself down on the dirty bathroom floor and started praying lord jesus help him oh god oh lord i didn't mean to kill him he began to arrive come true like this we we shook hands they called us down to the principal's office and i had an unfair advantage because my principal's name was mr jenkins and i had won him to the lord he had called me to his office to pray the sinner's prayer with him because i had spent some time witnessing to him and his wife my teacher at the time had been to my revivals where i was preaching because i started preaching at seven and she had been her name was mrs fike it hasn't been too long ago i saw her at at olive garden but she's getting on up there in years when it come time to go down to the office my my buddy walking with me the boy i just knocked out we're walking down side by side and he said this is not fair he said because the principal likes you better than he does me and i said well the truth is you had no business treating me that way you know i took it and took it and took it and took it until i couldn't take it no more he said i don't even blame you that's my one big fight we get to the principal's office he goes in first he comes out and he looks at me and he says i'm i'm suspended he said i'm out for three days he said i think he's gonna do the same to you i said that's all right i can take three days at home that's not gonna be no problem for me i went in there and mr jenkins said steve shelly he said i'm embarrassed son he said i can't believe you let him push you like that i said sir i can't either i said but just to my defense i i prayed as sincere for him to come back to consciousness as i have ever prayed for anybody in my life mr jenkins cackled and he said i'm sure you did he said now i cannot have you knocking people out in my school but he said just go right on back to class and don't ever let it happen again when i walked out jeff somebody's parents were picking them up and he looked at me and he said you buzzard he said you're going back to class aren't you i said three days later he come back and we were the best of friends until i went to another school in high school you know god was good to me this is not just a career choice for me this is a lifestyle i i don't i don't have the same testimony that some of you have of how god delivered you from this or that or the other but i can testify that the same god who reaches way below the bottom to deliver and to save is the same god who filled me with his spirit and who kept me from making many many many stupid decisions along the way that's the god we serve that's the god we serve i want you to know he did everything for us all we have to do is with faith believe that it's a finished work the blood has forgiven all of our sins he has delivered us from all oppression but we have a choice to make and that is a decision to walk in freedom freedom is a gift but to walk to continue to abide free or with liberty is a conscious decision that you and i have to make on a continual basis if god has set you free from a complex you have to choose to stay away from that complex don't ever let the enemy take you into entanglement with that same thing again how do i do that by making up my mind to recognize the tricks of the enemy we are not ignorant of the devil's devices we know how he operates how many of you have learned enough about about how the enemy operates in your life you know him when he comes you know him when he shows up and if you'll always live on guard you're always live ready to pull down your imagination and to subject every thought to the obedience of christ then you can walk in freedom from lying you can walk in freedom from addiction you don't have to be a slave to your past you don't have to be a slave to the guilt of your past or the condemnation of your past you can realize i'm not that man again anymore i'm not that woman anymore now i want to give you a quotation from testimony and this was a testimony that brother branham gave of raising the dead boy and i i'd love to tell that story but we don't have time to do that this morning but i want to read this from that same message if you ever want to go back and check this message it's a good one it's 1953. that's a long time ago but the truth is just as real today as it was then he said you've got to go do it and you've got to fight for every inch it's not automatic walking in freedom walking in deliverance is not automatic god will always do his part but you have a part to play anybody with me don't get quiet yet everybody has a part to play here he said and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have he said every man in here that's born again of the spirit of god knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground toe the mark with satan somebody said well i'm no match for him let me tell you something greater is he greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world without christ you are no match for satan in christ you are more than a match your anger does not have to dictate your decisions you can be out from under that but it's a day today today you know one of the biggest hindrances to walking in freedom is the spirit of religion i find it to be one of the most difficult demonic powers to deal with is the religious spirit because people will get a little bit of freedom in their life and they will want to police the church they will want to police everybody else's life come on they'll want to interview everybody to make sure they're doing like they think they ought to do and they will become so arrogant and so religious and so untouchable that they lose all connection with the grace that brought them out of their own mess if you ever forget where god brought you from you're in danger of religion when you remember that you don't have to remember the guilt you don't have to remember the condemnation you are remembering the hand that reached way below the bottom and pulled you out you must never forget how far the lord has brought you from you must remember what it was like to be angry hawk i want you to come here i'm sorry i know you'll turn red won't be the first time what'd he say what he said doesn't matter match your hair turn around i want everybody to see who you are because some have come while you over in iceland and you may not have this this this is his testimony i'm going to give this part of his testimony to you i cannot believe it if i didn't know that he was a man of truth and not a liar i would say he's a liar he tells me and has told you that will listen that he was the most angry person that he had ever met i don't believe it i do believe it because he said so and i don't believe he would lie to me but i cannot imagine him being angry oh i've seen him a little perplexed perturbed with me but not angry when the lord saved him he so gloriously so gloriously saved him that he made him a completely different person am i making this up have you not said you were the most angry person one of the most angry people you had ever met possessed with rage how old were you when you found the lord a little bit after my 20s just past his 20s i want you to thank god for hawk's life i don't want to make him stand here no more [Applause] when i met him we kid with him about being a red-headed viking because he's from iceland and when david was singing figuratively about eating giants the the past of some of those vikings was not figuratively they literally ate their enemies and so i have had a lot of fun poking with hawk because he's from iceland and when i met him i found him to be one of the most gentle and sincere men that i had ever met in my life and yet he is sitting there telling me i was possessed with rage what fixed that it wasn't counseling he didn't have a pleasant growing up experience only knew those things i don't know if i ought to tell this or not but his dad was famous in iceland for some very unsavory things you want to make the newspaper for something good you've brought into the country not for something filthy you brought into the country but when god reached down to save and deliver hawk's dad the same newspaper that packed the filth that he brought to the nation packed the story can i tell you what the headline was from porn king to king of kings [Music] is that all right to tell [Applause] who did that jesus did that jesus did that but i want you to know hulk's dad and hawk and me and you we have a decision to make we have a choice to make because it would be easy sometimes to give up and to float back into a life that god had delivered us from but we make a daily sometimes hourly decision to walk in freedom ever go back i don't ever want to go back i don't ever want to go back i refuse to go back a daily choice a choice to walk in freedom come on now it wasn't a personal relationship with benny hinn or a personal friendship with billy graham that changed those men's lives it was the lord jesus christ come on now we have folks in this ministry that ran ran with buddha they wanted peace so they ran with buddha trying to find some hope and buddha couldn't help them mushrooms couldn't help them you know what i mean i don't mean on your steak mushroom couldn't have white powder couldn't help them heroin in the veins couldn't help them and i'm telling you i know somebody i know somebody i saw on facebook where my friend aaron evans and his wife jill marie just celebrated a wedding anniversary and brother aaron was here once or twice some years ago and aaron was in prison for murdering a man and jesus walked into his jail cell somebody said i don't i don't i don't even believe it don't you think anybody asks you what you believe did you hear any of us ask you we're talking about a man that was in jail for murder and according to his testimony he was not falsely accused that's what he said i'm not down here talking bad about him he said i was not falsely accused i did what i was condemned for doing and one day jesus walked into the to the jail cell and spoke to aaron and said i'm not a black man but aaron's black he said i'm not a black man and i'm not a white man but i'm the right man you better serve me somebody said i don't even believe that i believe it because i know what jesus did in his life whoa i'm not a black man i'm not a white man he said i'm the right man you better get on your knees and serve me and aaron said yes sir i'll serve you every day of my life i'll make you the lord of my life you're the only one that can make a difference in my life come on now i know people so addicted to nicotine that they didn't just smoke a pack of cigarettes a day they smoked three cartons of cigarettes a day do you know that's enough to kill you and they didn't just do it for one one week or one month they did it for years it's a miracle beyond miracle how can anybody even consume that many cigarettes in one day three cartons literally had to have one in their hand all day long would wake up in the night to smoke now there were some that burned out in the ashtray while they were running their mouth but had one lit at all times could not be free multiple times said i'll never do it again throw them away i'll never do it again my own grandfather struggled so bad that he would get under conviction in a baptism and he would run down to the river and be baptized and would throw his cigarettes up into the woods and and a few hours later they would see him going through the leaves and the limbs trying to find that pack of cigarettes that he threw away it felt good in the moment he thought i'm doing the right thing but he was depending on the lord to do all of it and he will meet you at the point of your need and he will deliver you with his blood and he will meet you right where you are you don't have to get clean enough or holy enough or good enough he will come right down to the gutter where you are and have fellowship with you but you will have to make the choice to get out of that gutter to quit allowing the life of sin to drag you back to the pit where you once were freedom is a choice and it's going to cost you because it's going to be an everyday affair fighting toe-to-toe with satan fighting for every inch of ground that you take somebody said how do i know it's worth it it's eternal life it's the difference between heaven and hell you've got to make up your mind to fight your way through until you reach that place where these things have no hold on you and they have no pull on you i want to make sure that everyone hears me today i believe there's a place we find in christ where we have total deliverance where we no longer have to fight against the same spirits and the same lies and the same habits we walk out in freedom and we choose to remain in freedom and god strengthens our decision you don't have to make this decision by yourself he will strengthen your decision if you'll lean on him anybody here all right i want to read this to you in the message a deceived church by the world he said remember we're not on a picnic i think the church has this idea that we're we're having a big celebration here well i want you to know while people are going to hell in a hand basket is not exactly the time to have a big celebration the world's dying and going to hell around us and we don't have time to be borderline believers we got to go all the way because the one thing the world don't want none of is your religion they only want some of your reality they don't want to hear you that can talk the talk but can't walk the walk i hope you're listening to me your your life your decisions the way you behave can undo your testimony at the speed of light you've got to be able to walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk because people are looking for something that brings reality that brings fulfillment they're not looking for religion they're not looking for a bunch of hypocrites however let me tell you this your pitiful excuse if you're listening to this service and you've got that pitiful excuse i would go to church but there are so many hypocrites well may i tell you that if you're letting a hypocrite keep you from church that hypocrite is standing closer to god than you are they're standing between you and god so you better get your eyes off of hypocrites and determine not to be one to make up your mind i'm going to serve god all the way i'm going to give my children an example to be proud of i'm going to show my children that it's a it's possible to overcome anger it's possible to overcome violence it's possible to overcome addiction i'm going to show my children that jesus listen they better hear it you better show them because the world is going to make the same pull for them that it made for you and if we love our children we want to spare them from walking down the same road i don't understand groups of people who believe that young people have to go out and sin to understand and appreciate salvation i don't believe that for one moment i won't let that be preached around here that's not the grace of god the same grace of god as i said a moment ago that can save you it's the grace of god that can keep some of you from ever have i don't i don't want my children to have to know what it's like to be out of their minds with alcohol i don't want them to ever have to understand what some of these things are and it will only be the grace of god it's nothing it's not some trophy to brag about it's the grace of god that we celebrate he said remember we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefield he said many people just think when they become christian that's all they need to do that that settles it forever as they're a christian and everything's going to come easy if i am selling that forgive me because i believe what david said your battle begins once you cross over if some of you think you've fought to be where you are you've been fighting that hard on the other side of jordan what are you going to do when you make the crossing you're going to have a lot more to defeat on this side of the river than you had on that side of the river because if you think satan is going to lay down and play dead while the bride of jesus christ takes her position and authority in the earth as adopted manifested sons of god speaking forth the creative word of god then you'd be a little crazy in the head because satan is not going to lay down and play dead he's going to fight you every step of the way tooth and toenail to discourage you he's going to try to pull you out of church he's going to try to spoil your faith he's going to inspire you to be a thief and a robber instead of giving god what belongs to him he's going to tell you the word of god is archaic and has no relevance today he's going to tell you the church is dead and there's no hope he'll tell you all kinds of tales but you've got to make up your mind to listen to something a little bit higher than the enemy he said okay it goes on he said don't never get that in your head it's not a party it's not a bed of ease he said for i become a christian to do what to fight if you're becoming a christian because you want to coast you just want to soar through life with no battles you know jesus was a lot of things and one thing he was that he was reasonable and fair he said i would that thou art either hot or cold jesus said i'd rather you be off or own own or off i'd rather you serve me or not serve me but the most dangerous place i'm paraphrasing the most dangerous place to live your life is the in between we call that the borderland anybody with me are you listening i'm just starting so don't don't rush me if you need to slip out no one is going to be offended at you for doing so but neither are we going to rush through a service because you had something else to do anybody with me we're not a seeker sensitive uh friendly people when it comes to those kinds of things we you are welcome to come in and out as you need to leave when you need to leave but don't come thinking you're going to rush us through a service because this is life to us the strength that i get today is not just going to carry me till this afternoon the strength i get today is going to bring me through to the next week and to the next week that don't mean that i'm not going to have to you know engage him and fellowship him and worship him and read the bible but many times the anointing that falls on us corporately on a sunday carries us all week we just keep going back and chewing did you know there's people here that'll watch a service on sunday that they sat in they'll watch it at least three times before they come back next sunday you can hardly get through it once come on i know you love me you can hardly get through one and yet there's people that'll go back and watch it three times you know why because they realize you can't catch it all right you're still reeling from one statement that's made and god slips something else over here for us and we have to feed we are literally feeding on god's living word and that's what's sustaining us and keeping us in this battle he said now listen he said i'll become a christian to fight fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get in the battle in the battle lines he said we're christian soldiers and we've got to be trained that's why we're here today that's why we're here this morning we're being trained to fight the good fight of faith trained and brought up and know all the techniques of the enemy because we need to know how to fortify how to prepare our position how to entrench ourselves so that the enemy is not able to advance in our lives we cannot be ignorant in this hour just because you refuse to pay attention to what the enemy is doing does not mean that he's not actively involved in trying to take your mind the enemy doesn't just want to cause you to stub your toe he wants to destroy your life he's out for blood somebody said you're making it sound pretty serious it is serious it's a life-or-death event that's why some people satisfy they settle for religion because they don't want to get in the fight amen if you're here this morning and you don't want to get in the fight you're going to be miserable around us because we don't believe in passive christianity we believe the only way to take the kingdom the only way to advance the work of the lord jesus is to stand against the wiles of the enemy to expose him to call him out put the word on him to rebuke him to resist him the bible excuse me the quote goes on to say we got to be trained and brought up and know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify and to know how to fight the fight god help us we want to know how to fight the fight and we can only do that look at what it says you can only do that as the holy spirit will what reveal it to us we're here to learn something we're here to have something revealed to us you do not have to be a a slave to a controlling spirit you don't have to control everything around you god's a big god he wants you but he doesn't have to have you to keep things going he's got somebody come on some people just need to understand what their place is in the kingdom of god get their hands off of other people's lives if you want to help somebody go to your knees pray like a wild man be so full of the holy ghost that everybody's attracted to what you've got to offer but don't find yourself stepping into a metron that's not yours and a metron is a greek word used in the new testament for spiritual jurisdiction and it is not everybody's place to pastor a church it's not everybody's place to deal with some of the problems and to train the people for war but god's got somebody he always has somebody to do the job you've just got to recognize that somebody he said we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas so to speak all right we've got to know what the holy spirit is saying we've got to know what god would have us do he said but we've got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the what the commander-in-chief of the army of the christians let me tell you something your commanding officer will give you the orders if you've got a humble spirit and you can say yes sir lord i'm ready to do whatever it is that you've called me to do let me tell you something what god's looking for out of us stay with me do you know what god's looking for out of us obedience he wants a people that will obey him he wants a people that will choose to walk in freedom in a message called the pool of bethesda you still here a whole lot of moving around going on i hope you'll be mindful that we're having service but the battle is on right against wrong skepticism against the word of god faith against unbelief oh father may the angels i love this one may the angels of god wave their white flag the banners of the cross and may the holy spirit rise tonight may signs and wonders be done we give you all things believing them this is where we are lord we believe that you can help us to overcome whatever it is that the enemy throws against us let me give you the verse i quoted earlier ii corinthians 2 11. this is what we have to keep in mind second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 last satan lest satan should get an advantage of us for we do have it for we are not ignorant of his devices listen we're not naive people we've been through the fire hawk how long have you served the lord now 20 years we didn't just get in this thing ben ellsworth how long have you served the lord i know everybody's counting in their head anticipating that i may ask them 14 years brother greeley how long have you really served the lord 35 years are you 35 years old 35 years brother reid how many years have you served the lord 45 years well we may not have trophies we may not have accolades to hand out but i just wanted you all to know we are not ignorant that the devil will use anybody and anything it's not by coincidence that that david sung the song he sung and the lord gave me reminding me of the scripture because that leviathan that twisting serpent that the psalmist talks about that is a spirit that desires to cut you off from your life source he doesn't want you to believe the whole truth and nothing but the truth he wants to pollute and contaminate and pervert truth he wants to twist the way things are spoken in your ear so that you will take it in an entirely different way than what it was intended do you know most disagreements that happen among families and friends is because of a spirit that desires to twist things it's nobody to blame it's the enemy to blame but it's all of us to blame if we don't recognize that it's him we're not ignorant of his devices there have been times even in my family it's been some time ago but there have been times in our family when we would be having a real knockdown drag out kids up in the air dad up in the air mom up in the air just bickering with one another i don't think we were physically throwing down or anything like that because we all know i would have sat on them in one but we were yelling i remember time sitting in the kitchen table around the kitchen table and we were just bitterly disagreeing about something and but you said but you did i know i'm just blowing your image of our family life totally forgetting who we are totally forgetting what was going on and one of my kids usually joshua one of my kids would stand up and say wait a minute we need to recognize that this is the devil this is not god he is not pleased with the way we're carrying on we need to turn our attention on the enemy instead of blaming one another now how do you keep fighting in an atmosphere like that where one of your kids is raised up to rebuke you i didn't exercise my authority as a dad and say sit down and shut up you don't know what you're talking about because i knew he didn't know what he was talking about and was just happened to happen to be the most sensitive in that moment to catch that this is the enemy and we can stop this thing right here we don't have to argue another five minutes we can get the victory over this we can turn our prayers to god we can turn our anger toward the enemy and we can love one another out of this mess how many of you understand what i'm trying to tell you we have to be able to recognize this isn't us this is the enemy trying to destroy us and he will unless we raise up and turn our attention against him that spirit that once tried to destroy the saints of god twisting truth and trying to take them under the water and drown them in the depths of the sea can become bread it can become strength it can become sustenance to us in the battle that rages we have to make up our mind let me tell you something your pastor can't cut that thing off in your life without your cooperation your god won't even do it you've got to come to a place where you realize this is the enemy trying to twist my emotions anybody with me he's trying to destroy my family he's trying to destroy my relationships and instead of putting a name on it like my friend my brother my sister i need to turn my attention on the one that's out to kill me and say no more enemy are you with me good i just need a little more of your time not much in a message called christianity versus idolatry you still here good that's right he said you've got to know the word this is the only way to walk in the victory this is the only way for freedom to become a choice this is the only way for freedom to become a mindset is we have to choose freedom and we choose it by staying on the word he said see the great battle is at hand now we've played church for years and years but the hour has come now that when jamborus and janice will withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be spiritual battle imitator against genuin that's what he wants to do it's going to be spiritual battle conflict there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into domination and go on the way it goes but i mean listen close the real true believer is coming to that battlefield and you had better be versed and know what you're doing listen listen listen i know there are visitors here but i'm talking to this church he said or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know you've got to be versed in the battle you've got to understand what the enemy is out to do and you've got to realize that even as a child of god you can come under a wrong spirit this is not demon possession this is just taking on a wrong spirit this is taking on a wrong attitude some people pout all the time that's a wrong spirit i'll just be honest with you that's a wrong spirit i don't have time for that i'm going to sound a little ugly here don't have time for that i don't have time for powders powders or doubters and going to be do withouters we didn't put up with our children patent and we're not going to put up with adults pounding you get under that poutine spirit and everything and everybody will make you pooch out your lips you'll be 45 years old 40 55 65 years old acting like a little three-year-old in a corner well your nose stuck in the corner like some little child being disciplined just pouting and pouting and pouting always got your feelings on your sleeves and always hurt with somebody about something there comes a time folks that we grow up a little bit in the faith and we recognize that spirits want to use us they want to ride in on us they want to utilize us he said you can if you're not versed in these things and know what you're doing you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it if it's always condemning someone it's contrary to the word if it's always trying to control someone it's it's contrary to the word if it's always trying to manipulate a situation selfishly it's contrary to the word anybody with me and if it's contrary to the word don't believe it you stay with that word because freedom is a choice let me tell you what god did up here for brother joshua llano is real and it is genuine and it is powerful and it is potent and god wants to do that for every one of us who need to be free he has met many of us but it's going to be up to him and it's going to be up to us to continue in every situation at all times in the heat of the battle when all guns are turned on him and they will it's going to be up to him to choose free freedom is i am freedom i am freedom i'm not coming under bondage to what you think about me or what you say about me or how you perceive me i'm not coming into bondage by what the enemy says about me i choose to be free i didn't come to this thing totally ignorant i know you you're you're recognizing what the enemy tries to do and you begin to take authority over him he said the real true believer coming to the battlefield you better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy or not no if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with the word second corinthians 3 17 i need about 15 more minutes second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 now the lord is that spirit we're not talking about some strange spirit we're talking about adonai we're talking about the spirit of the lord now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is i don't like going to churches where they get loud you know you're gonna have a problem my old granny used to say this is the quietest world you're ever going to live in it's going to get louder from here on out because if you go to heaven if you think i'm going to go to heaven and act like some presbyterian i'm pentecostal all the way if you don't like shout and stay off of my cloud my cloud's going to be the loud crowd i've got something to praise the lord for i'm not no hypocrite i'm not going down to the ball game and get excited if i can't come to church and get excited and on occasion i'm not a big sports fan but i have when my boys were batting i've been known to be a little loud just a few people here could verify that boy i've had some i had kind of stay away from it because you know how we soccer moms can be come on you sorry pitcher that's my youngin you're pitching to surely you can do better now i'm not going to get excited out there about a pigskin going down the green grass and then come to church and fold my hands no no no no no i'm not going to tomahawk for the braves and then come to church and can't even raise my hands to praise the lord anybody with me let me tell you something serving god is the best decision that i've ever made in my life loving jesus i've never regretted it and i don't believe there's anything wrong with doing it with all your heart with all your might i don't believe the days of miracles are over i believe everywhere jesus went noyes went to bartimaeus they had to tell him hold your peace hold your peace you're going to have to hush now you're getting out of hand he couldn't help himself at times his the joy of the lord here they come out of the temple and here's such a crippled man and and they're they're asking oh he's asking alms and he's reaching out they looked at him and said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth get up and walk [Music] and the bible said he quietly reverently dignified gradually rose from his place of prostration and wiggled his big toe in his sandal no no no no no that's not what the bible said it all it said he went leaping leaping jumping leaping hallelujah i was a but i'm not a anymore he went walking and leaping and praising god [Applause] why because he had nothing to be ashamed of let me tell you something his noise his noise was greater than the preacher's sermon because everybody had passed by and seen his broken condition he was well known in the community he had been sitting there begging for money for years they saw his withered feet they saw how he had to be drug into position and drug out a position but not this day oh he was walking and leaping and giving praise to god let me tell you something there are people that would tell you that miracles ended with the apostles they're lying to you you hear your preacher they're lying to you they're not good men telling you those lies the bible said he is the same will you give the lord a shout will you give him a praise right now well you lift up a shout do you believe he's the same [Applause] [Music] do you believe he's the same i'm closing the message go tell broke every slave belt listen to this paragraph 80 and we continue a moment with the slaves in our thought there was a proclamation emancipation of the proclamation that was signed you remember the story brother brown tells about the blind man weeping because he saw a drop of abraham lincoln's blood abraham lincoln wasn't a slave a slave man abraham lincoln wasn't his savior but he's the one that gave him his freedom and he was so moved by seeing a stain of abraham lincoln's blood that it moved him to tears that man got more excited over the blood of abraham lincoln than christians get about the blood of jesus christ are you listening to what i'm saying don't you be guilty he said and the slaves was going to be free upon a certain day you you don't know how if you've never met christ you never know what it means meant to be to them slaves you may have never been a slave in the natural you may have never been under that kind of oppression like many people have been but many of us experienced slavery in another realm of spiritual slavery he said when it went the message throughout the land you're going to be free on such a such a day at daylight you're going to be free you'll not have to wear slave belts anymore neither will you get any more weapons but you're free and you're a citizen of this great united states you are no more a slave after daylight on a certain morning oh with great anticipations they waited if the sinner could only see that if the sinner would only hear the true gospel not the joining of a church but the preaching of the gospel that you can be free from sin and that you can be free from your sickness at a certain certain time that's the time you believe you know those slaves were so excited and under such anticipation waiting for the hour that they would be free until they tell me they gathered at the bottom of the hill mothers and little children all gathered and some of the old and they climbed up to the top of the mountain around midnight they knowed when that day broke and the sun come up that they would be free [Music] it couldn't take over one half a minute to shine the sun from the top of the hill but some of them was up on the top of the hill watching they didn't dare stay at the bottom and wait for the sun to top the mountain some of them wanted to be the first to see it i don't know how i'd have made it up there but i believe i'd have been one of them not one half a second more in slavery than i have to have not one extra minute as a slave to the enemy when jesus comes to liberate us and set us free why would you want to live another day choosing bitterness or anger or jealousy or resentment when every bit of that can be taken oh he said some of them was up on the hill watching watching oh when the sun rises we're free he said that was the s-u-n let's go on but when the s-o-n rises one of these days and when the s-o-n rose some 1900 years ago he broke every slave belt i want to ask you how many of you have ever been a slave to sin come on hold up your hand did you know jesus christ has broke every slave belt if you've accepted him as your lord and savior he set every captive free he healed every sickness he gave freedom to those who are in bondage how we ought to climb and watch and when the sun peeped up first the man was at the highest saw it and be shouted he shouted down to the next man we are free and the next man shouted to the man further down the hill we are free until it come to the camp we are free for the sun was arising they were waiting waiting waiting for that hour musicians are coming how much more ought we to be waiting today for the son of god we are free from sin help me now we are free from the shackles we are free from habits we are free from smoking and drinking and carousing because the essential of god hallelujah has raised from the grave and has broke every fetter while they're getting ready let me finish this one all condemnation is gone the debt has been paid the penalty is paid the sins are washed away and we're free oh we're free people slavery freedom when the son of god rises with healing in his wings the last quotation i want to share with you is from god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning in paragraph 40. he said now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to god someday for every man that come on the face of the earth has to answer to god for a responsibility we are responsible to maintain the freedom that has become ours through the free gift of deliverance and salvation and how do we do that one decision at a time one choice at a time the world is always there to try to get you to swallow their appeal you're going to need the lord's help to knock them out you're going to need the lord's help to take that threat out of the way we're talking spiritually now don't get in the trouble i got in spiritually you're gonna have to make a decision that i'm gonna be free he set me free he made me free and now i'm gonna walk in freedom i want you to stand in this place i want you to sing i'm i want you to sing i'm free from the fear of tomorrow we're

to help us so we've got so much to be thankful for but it seemed like every uh uh attack seemed like every tart they become a real target and every weapon of the enemy is formed against them in one way or another there's healing taking place in their marriage and in their relationship and they're they're coming together in a way that's gonna i tell you it's gonna defeat a lot of devils and it's gonna help a lot of marriages it's going to help a lot of people one of these days i'm sure that but i want you to stretch your hand toward them right now i want everybody in this room to take just a moment and ask the lord they need favor they need grace they need provision and they need to be surrounded they need to be surrounded and we can do that in our prayer we can do that in our prayers we can surround them right now and help shield them from the target that's painted on their back it's because of the depth of the testimony it's because of the depth of the deliverance that the enemy would like to continue to harass and target them but we are believing god today i want to obey the lord i don't want to make anybody uncomfortable but i want to obey the lord i want brother austin where is austin hodges and anna i want them to come i want you all to come stand behind them would you would you i don't want to make this awkward at all they have a friendship that the enemy likes to attack i tell you when god gets through he's laid a call on austin's life god's healing him they're a kingdom couple you're looking at two kingdom couples i i don't think you ought to judge people based on how smart they are but i got to tell you these are some of the smartest people i know they are there there's a level of intelligence that they carry but i marvel at i mean all four of them and i want us to cover them right now i've just prayed over sister rebecca there but but i want us to cover them right now i i called austin and anna to stand there as support but as soon as i did i realized that it's the will of god that we just surround all four of them right now iron sharpeneth iron they are not in a pleasant uh situation having to learn to live in community [Music] but it's because of the greater purposes of god it's because of the great deliverances that are represented in that four right there i'm telling you i feel something rising up in me right now i might lift off the ground i feel something rising up through my legs to strengthen me right now and i know that it's just the power of the and the anointing of the holy ghost i want this church to cry out for for uh for a real hedge to be built around them right now to protect the gifts that are in their lives they're not only intelligent but they're gifted and they're under an attack [Music] the enemy doesn't want them to walk in freedom [Music] the enemy doesn't want them to be the kingdom couples that they've been called to be but i tell you he's a liar i tell you he's a liar and the father of all eyes lord these are not for perfect people because i don't know four perfect people but these are four people that are surrendered they left everything behind to follow your voice and i know that the reward is coming i know the blessings are coming because of the sacrifice they made we just bind them together right now we just hold them together lord [Music] hadabushi river [Music] lord as individuals cleanse them from the top of their head even to the soles of their feet cleanse them as individuals and then as couples cleanse them strengthen the bonds of their marriage strengthen the bonds of their marriage strengthen their vows to each other and then lord his brothers and sisters together strengthen them right now to do much damage i'm not calling them into ministry together i'm calling them into service [Music] against the darkness [Music] lord let no lie prevail in their life let them never respond to the lies of the enemy that are spoken over them into them let let truth prevail right now ushbahaya ikandala mahaya sister hope turn around here just a minute i don't i don't mean embarrass you but i want to pray for you i didn't do that i got got excited the lord said i'm showing you my strength in you thank you jesus you have not really seen yourself in times past as strong but i'm showing you who you really are the lord said i'm showing you who you really are i'm showing you the strength of grace and i'm showing you the strength of forgiveness and i'm showing you my strength [Music] even my strength is being perfected in your weakness says the lord and i'm going to open the well i'm going to open the well in your life and i'm going to pull from the gifts that i have placed in you and i'm going to cause you to rise above it all you shall ride even as a psalmist saith the lord and i shall anoint what comes out of you because it will be the fruit of the seed that i have planted in you says the lord focus on full surrender focus on allowing my thoughts to become your thoughts and my words to become your words for i am bringing you through you will surely not go down in defeat for i am the lord and i have held thee by thy right hand and i have called thee forth for such a time as this [Music] behold i will do surgery saith the lord i will use the sword of my word to cut out anything that grows in the womb of your spirit that is not of me saith the lord all that you have carried in life and and the hurt and the misunderstandings that go all the way back to the time that you were just a little girl and you seem to be passed over so many times and be lost in the noise the lord said you will not be lost in the noise i will not allow you to be lost in the noise i will bring forth your voice and it shall roar it shall roar because it will be my voice it will be my voice the voice of the bridegroom it will be my voice says the lord so release everything to me in this moment because you have consulted my word because you have surrendered to my word because you have chosen my word over your own feelings because you chose to respond according to my word i will restore and i will give you new tata is somebody praise the lord with us right now hallelujah [Music] [Applause] let me reach here i just want to confirm for you the call of god on your life and and i want to tell you that what you are today what you stand here before me today is barely barely a small portion of what god desires to make of you the healing that you have testified about the fullness of that healing is coming it's coming it's coming it's coming you're going to have to be patient it's coming because there's some roots that the holy ghost wants to dig out of your life to give you the healing that you need and god said i'm going to give you the marriage that you have desired to have because i'm going to help make you a new creation and i believe the lord is going to do the same for our sister anna the lord says i see the hurt that you carry and i see the cloud of darkness that tries to overtake you at times and i see you in those moments that you would desire to run and never stop never even turn or look back but i am the lord and i have sustained you and i will bring about the deliverance that you desire i will open your understanding in a way that it has never opened before you will not just walk on the knowledge and the intelligence that i have given you but you will soar on revelation says the lord thank you for i will bring you to a new level as you surrender it all to me give it up i hear the lord say give it up do not carry it anymore cast it on me for i surround you even this moment with my love your mind you are mine and i made you thus i have created you with strength saith the lord and i will redeem that strength and i will redeem who you are in the natural and i will use that for the building of my kingdom saith the lord i will increase your usability as i transform your spirit thank you jesus christ i see a

they will not in any way be affected by the stress or the strain i pray that they will feel safe always in mom and daddy's care i pray lord that you will make them aware even at this age of the angels that are assigned to them lord if it would even be your will i would i would so love it if you would open their eyes and even let them see the presence of the angels that you have assigned to care for their lives oh i loose you in the name of jesus christ to be who god has called you to be [Music] i break off any generational stuff that the enemy it's illegal he has no right [Music] you will wear no label yes what was it was he early was he early it was gwen that was born early was there was there complications at his birth oh the tongue tied i thought there was something and i just couldn't quite you will wear no labels you will wear no label but a born-again child of god we break every assignment of the enemy against you loose him lord to be everything you've created him to be i i just i'm on purpose not using words whoa yeah that's good you are too cute oh god's good here let's give him praise i'm no longer a slave [Music] is she here where is maya come here i don't want to embarrass you but we might as well get it all over with you all right get your good embarrassment i know what the lord did for you and i don't want the enemy to try to close you down it's too soon i don't want you to have to fight battles now that should be way off over there somewhere and so i want the lord to loose a praise in you i also feel that you are a called praiser you're called to worship i know you're quiet by nature all that can change if god wants it to if he don't lord knows there's a man somewhere that's going to need a quiet wife they're very few and far between so don't feel like you have to be anything but what god created you to be but i don't want you to hold back in your praise i want you to be absolutely free to raise up your hands because you are just like god wants you to be you're standing right now right where god would have you and i don't want anything to interview so just raise up both hands and if i have embarrassed you i just trust you'll forgive me i believe you will father in the name of jesus oh josiah the minute i laid my hands on you i saw a sword propped on your shoulder and i believe the lord wants to give you a praise that routes the enemy i believe god wants to give you a praise that pushes back the darkness so i'm going to call on that to begin to bubble i'm going to call on that to begin to bubble up on the inside of the inside oh whoa lord you see anything and everything that the enemy would use to hold her to hinder her to intimidate her to strike fear can i just tell you that jesus is the best friend that you will ever have he's the only daddy that i've ever known i didn't really know my daddy but he told me that he would be my father and he has been faithful [Music] i believe he wanted me to tell you that he will be faithful to you as your papa he wants to reveal himself to you as your papa some people are uncomfortable even using that language but the psalmist said abba father and abba is a word that means papa it means daddy it's a term of endearment and i know christians that have been serving the lord for years that wouldn't dare use a term like that but he has revealed himself to me as a papa and he wants to reveal himself to you as a papa and we just seal that right now and we just say the enemy is defeated there's going to be peace reigning in her life and she is not going into a shell she's coming out of that she's not going backwards she's going forward in the name of jesus god's going to give her a voice to praise and advice to speak true hallie i condya we just seal that in right now hallelujah no fear [Music] just tell him you love him you can just do it inside it doesn't matter to me how you do it just let him know you love him hallelujah i'm no longer oh i am a child of god and i'm no longer [Music] oh [Music] oh i am a child of god a slave to fear oh i am a child of god [Music] a child of god [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh i am a child of god lord we thank you that you are god sovereign and supreme you have set us free from the yoke of sin and from the bondage of this life we thank you lord for everything that you have done in us today we thank you for those that you have ministered to personally i pray lord that it will bring no confusion to them but that clarity would come i pray that if they should ask for understanding you would give them understanding lord we lift up brother daniel and sister anna today we love them and we miss them some things shifted and they weren't able to be here as their trip had to start a few hours earlier than what they thought but lord wherever they are most likely streaming this service unless they're already on an airplane lord i pray for them right now that you will strengthen them that you will guide them and direct them lord and that you will heal them we are ever more aware of the journey of their life and what they carry the gifts that you have placed in them and we see how the enemy opposes them and how he would desire to attack their life the wounds that they carry lord only you can kiss them better you're the only one that can kiss them better and i ask you to do that right now as only you can jesus we pray lord over every person into the sound of our voice that would have liked prayer maybe in a special way that you would come right now and minister strengthen lord their life refill them with your spirit heal the sick whatever you desire to do in this lord we want to be surrendered to you go with us today in grace and keep us until we meet again i'm no longer [Music] i am a child of god sing it again [Music] a child of god and i'm no longer [Music] oh i am a child of god one more time [Music] of god i want us just to we're not going to embarrass them but i want us just from where we are it is strange for a family to come visit the first time and sit here this long i would have anticipated you all exiting about half an hour ago while we were praying and it's touched my it's touched me that you are still here i don't know your needs but jesus does but i know you have needs because you're human and you're breathing i want you just to raise your hand toward them i hope it won't embarrass them too much but right now it wouldn't hardly matter because i feel the presence of the lord lord i don't know this precious family i don't know why they passed our way today but i'm so thankful that they did yes and i don't know why you brought it out in my mind like you just did lord but i think it's outstanding if i was a first-time visitor and the service ran this long i most likely would have already made my exit but something lord i don't know if it was respect i i don't know what it was but they've lingered to the last minute and i just wanted to bless them i just want to ask you to touch their lives i just want you to surround them with your love i just want you to provide for them whatever they need strengthen them strengthen them i pray in the name of jesus may they know your love in a tangible way lord healing i thank you that you're a healer and you know where the sickness is heal as only you can lord if it would be your will i pray they'll be courageous enough to visit this house again in the name of the lord jesus christ bless them good amen you are dismissed to go every one of you in the name of the lord please listen carefully you home folk there will be no service here tuesday night at seven o'clock but there will be service here sunday morning at 11. may god move in a mighty mighty way you say i can't go a week without church yes you can you

leave just a few hours earlier than what i had planned to leave to be out of town would you pray for our family that god will help us and protect us and keep us this week this is a much needed break
