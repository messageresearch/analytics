[1:08:15] where were thou when the sons of God
[1:08:18] shouted for Joy amen I don't know about
[1:08:20] you when I was there before the

[1:08:25] if you shouted there you will shout here

[1:08:31] Lord there's no way you can stop me from
[1:08:33] shouting you see I was there before the

[1:08:40] on this Earth from shouting the glories
[1:08:42] of God Amen blessed be the name of the
[1:08:46] Lord oh Hallelujah Psalms 150 says
[1:08:50] everything that have breath Must Praise
[1:08:52] the Lord amen about you but if you are
[1:08:54] breathing tonight you ought to praise
[1:08:57] Him amen praise God because that's what
[1:08:59] the Bible says amen that's the purpose
[1:09:01] why we are breathing is there somebody
[1:09:03] breathing here tonight amen then you
[1:09:05] ought to praise him praise the name of
[1:09:06] the Lord I like Ezekiel Hezekiah when he
[1:09:10] told him to get your house in order
[1:09:12] you're going to die amen he turned and
[1:09:14] he said Lord the death cannot worship
[1:09:16] you you know what God changed his mind
[1:09:18] worship can change God's mind he told
[1:09:21] the prophet Isaiah turn around and add
[1:09:23] 15 years of breath for him just to
[1:09:25] praise me amen hallelujah I'm telling
[1:09:27] you co couldn't stop us from praising
[1:09:29] the Lord hallelujah we know the purpose
[1:09:32] of breathing amen hallelujah so we give
[1:09:35] God all the honor the praise and the
[1:09:37] glory Matthew Chapter 2 the wise men
[1:09:39] came they said we came to worship him I
[1:09:42] don't know about you is here somebody
[1:09:43] that's wise here tonight that said I
[1:09:45] Came To Worship the Lord amen praise the
[1:09:48] name of the Lord I just want to quickly
[1:09:50] go to a quote there that brother Brenham
[1:09:52] says amen uh when David's wife he was
[1:09:54] dancing and shouting when he saw the ark
[1:09:57] amen the word of God Amen and he was
[1:09:59] just jumping and shouting and his wife
[1:10:01] told him she was ashamed of him amen BR
[1:10:04] B says many people are ashamed of
[1:10:05] shouting and praising God Amen and his
[1:10:08] wife said that she was angry to the king
[1:10:10] because how can the king dance and Shout
[1:10:13] like that amen and I like what brother
[1:10:15] Brenham said what David told her he said
[1:10:17] tomorrow I will do better tomorrow I
[1:10:21] will shout better let me tell you last
[1:10:23] night we were shouting we were dancing
[1:10:26] we shouted amen but tonight we have to
[1:10:28] shout better every service you ought to
[1:10:31] do better is that right amen blessed be
[1:10:34] the name of the Lord and he said David
[1:10:36] said tomorrow I will do better amen and
[1:10:40] you your praise has got to be better
[1:10:41] amen because God takes us from glory to
[1:10:44] glory amen there God only promotes his
[1:10:47] his anointing is a promoe of anointing
[1:10:49] God never moves backwards amen he moves
[1:10:52] forward amen is that right
[1:10:54] so every service just take us from glory
[1:10:56] to glory blessed be the name I like what
[1:10:58] the what the Rabbi says about the latter
[1:11:01] rain they said the letter rain is seven
[1:11:03] times greater better stronger than the
[1:11:06] former Reign so if the letter Glory will
[1:11:08] be seven times better your amen your
[1:11:11] Hallelujah your dancing and shouting
[1:11:13] should be seven times better is that
[1:11:17] right oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:19] you ought to Sout better than David you
[1:11:21] ought to outd dance David am and all the
[1:11:24] Visions dreams and Revelations God gave
[1:11:26] in the Old Testament in the former Reign
[1:11:28] season in the latter reain we should do
[1:11:31] seven times better we should be seven
[1:11:33] times greater Hallelujah so brother the
[1:11:36] singing the shouting the dancing ought
[1:11:39] to be seven times greater and better is
[1:11:40] that right amen hallelujah so we're just
[1:11:43] excited there's another quote amen that

[1:13:28] greetings to Pastor Steven shy and

[1:13:33] so excited to be here uh um we are just
[1:13:36] thankful for them and being faithful to
[1:13:38] your calling if you were not faithful
[1:13:40] sir many many people would have never
[1:13:42] came to the knowledge of the message of
[1:13:44] the hour and we just want to say thank
[1:13:46] you to Pastor shy and sister um Stacy uh
[1:13:50] for standing on that calling um and
[1:13:53] being faithful to that calling because
[1:13:55] I'm one of them that basically got the
[1:13:57] revelation of the message when while
[1:13:59] Pastor sh was preaching I still had a
[1:14:01] tape amen it was called the prodical son
[1:14:04] in
[1:14:05] 2001 2002 I've listened to that tape and
[1:14:08] that was my final confirmation that this
[1:14:11] message is nothing but the truth amen
[1:14:15] and when when Pastor Shel was preaching
[1:14:16] about a prodical son I could see myself
[1:14:18] in the scripture amen you never became a
[1:14:21] son you were always a son always you
[1:14:23] were just lost I could see the whole
[1:14:25] message in that I could see spiritual
[1:14:27] Amnesia I could see predestination
[1:14:29] adoption I could see the manifestation
[1:14:31] of the sons of God I could see the plan
[1:14:34] for the Jews and the Gentiles because
[1:14:36] the youngest youngest son is the Jew is
[1:14:38] the is the Gentile and the Elder son
[1:14:40] that was never lost that was always in
[1:14:42] the house of the father is the Jews and
[1:14:45] so we were so excited and I'm telling
[1:14:47] you that blessed me and changed my life
[1:14:50] completely amen and I came in a message
[1:14:52] I'm so thankful I came that way in the
[1:14:54] message so I came in a supernatural way
[1:14:57] and I'm telling you I heard tapes and
[1:14:59] sermons like the transition from bride
[1:15:02] to wife for and letter rain and and all
[1:15:06] that type of sermons I'm telling you it
[1:15:07] changed my life it totally changed my
[1:15:10] life and it was a dream for us after 22
[1:15:13] years we dreamed to be here you know the
[1:15:15] Bible says God make all things beautiful
[1:15:18] in his time not according to our time in
[1:15:21] his time and I'm so excited I have so
[1:15:23] much to tell you so much to say but but
[1:15:25] for the sake of time and we are here for
[1:15:27] the purpose to be a blessing and all
[1:15:29] those stes and you know we never had we
[1:15:32] we didn't have any money brother we
[1:15:34] didn't even had a dollar but your
[1:15:36] ministry sended all those tapes all over
[1:15:39] the world we received it for free we
[1:15:41] didn't have money and I've listened to
[1:15:43] those stes and it blessed me it changed
[1:15:45] me it made me a preacher that I am today
[1:15:48] and Cape Town is so blessed and many
[1:15:50] people we have over 250 people in our
[1:15:52] church it's not about about numbers but
[1:15:54] listen if one man can do his job like
[1:15:56] Pastor shy and stay faithful to his
[1:15:58] calling amen only if you bring one
[1:16:01] person but preach a sermon door indoors

[1:17:23] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[1:17:26] father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:17:29] Isaac and the god of

[1:18:31] asking it in Jesus name amen and amen
[1:18:33] can we say amen amen you may be seated I
[1:18:36] just want to read that again um it says
[1:18:39] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[1:18:41] father the god of Abram the god of Isaac
[1:18:43] and the god of Jacob now I want you to
[1:18:45] follow real close here now because God
[1:18:49] is really revealing something to Moses
[1:18:52] here right God is speaking something and
[1:18:54] I want you to catch it I want you to see
[1:18:56] it because God is actually telling Moses
[1:18:59] I am I am God I am which means that I am
[1:19:03] a present tense God Amen praise the name
[1:19:07] of the Lord that um there is no past
[1:19:09] tense or future tense here he's telling
[1:19:12] us that he's a present tense God and he
[1:19:15] wants to be a present tense God you
[1:19:19] don't only want to be a god of History
[1:19:21] amen and there's a nice quote where
[1:19:23] brother Benham says people like to
[1:19:24] praise and worship God for what he did
[1:19:27] and they always look and praise and
[1:19:29] worship God for what he's still going to
[1:19:31] do in the future he said but they forget
[1:19:34] what God is doing right now and I'm
[1:19:38] talking about the I am God the present
[1:19:41] tense God and God is here tonight amen
[1:19:44] and the prophet says whenever he comes
[1:19:47] something good will take place do you
[1:19:50] believe it praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:52] but what here amen praise God so Moses I
[1:19:55] am the god of Abram Isaac and Jacob how
[1:19:59] can God be the I am God with
[1:20:04] people that's not I am that's people
[1:20:08] that's was right because you need to
[1:20:11] understand now God is telling him I'm a
[1:20:14] pleas tense God but I cannot be an I am
[1:20:17] God with the Ia servant right because
[1:20:21] Abram is no more right right Isaac is no
[1:20:24] more Jacob is no more these men are dead
[1:20:29] and God Is Yet God is saying I am the
[1:20:32] god of Abram Isaac and
[1:20:36] Jacob now if the sister can go to
[1:20:38] Matthew 22:32 I didn't put it up there
[1:20:41] but you can see something there and I
[1:20:42] want you to catch it tonight because
[1:20:44] Abraham is no more right Isaac is no
[1:20:47] more Jacob is no more they are all dead
[1:20:51] right so how can God God be an I am God
[1:20:54] with dead people right he cannot be a
[1:20:57] present tense god with people that's
[1:21:01] history I hope you see it these people
[1:21:04] are history they are no more present
[1:21:07] tense in the days of Moses they were
[1:21:10] already Abram Isaac and Jacob were
[1:21:13] already in the graveyard right but how
[1:21:16] can God be a I am God with the iash
[1:21:20] people he cannot but got to catch it now
[1:21:24] God is speaking to Moses now and God is
[1:21:26] speaking to Moses and in Matthew 22 uh
[1:21:29] 32 Jesus is also dealing with this he
[1:21:31] said did you hear that uh I am the god
[1:21:34] of Abram Isaac and Jacob and then he
[1:21:35] says I'm not the god of the dead right
[1:21:38] I'm the god of the living so what God
[1:21:41] was actually trying to tell Moses is I
[1:21:44] cannot be I
[1:21:46] am with Abram Isaac and Jacob because
[1:21:50] they are no more amen but Moses you are
[1:21:54] here oh my Moses you are alive Moses you
[1:21:59] are breathing and I cannot be I am God
[1:22:02] with people that's in the graveyard I
[1:22:04] need somebody that's
[1:22:07] alive oh I want you to see that I want
[1:22:09] you to see that because here's something
[1:22:11] deep here here's something deep here and
[1:22:13] I don't want you to miss it I want you
[1:22:14] to catch it you see there's people that
[1:22:17] would that that is trying to make God I
[1:22:20] am God with people that no
[1:22:25] more and God cannot manifest himself
[1:22:29] prove himself to be I am God with Abram
[1:22:34] Isaac and Jacob because they are
[1:22:39] history they are history brother and
[1:22:41] sister and and and you got to see this
[1:22:44] now I want that to soak into you you see
[1:22:48] Moses I was I am in in the days of Abram
[1:22:54] right I was I am in the days of Isaac I
[1:23:00] was that I am in the days of Jacob but
[1:23:04] for 400
[1:23:09] years I was not that I am God because I
[1:23:13] couldn't find me a
[1:23:15] servant and he's actually asking Moses I
[1:23:19] would love to be I desire to be but I
[1:23:22] need somebody that's available to say
[1:23:25] yes Lord and amen for God to prove
[1:23:28] himself to be I am God for this
[1:23:32] day oh I hope you see it he he's looking
[1:23:35] for a
[1:23:36] bride he's looking for
[1:23:38] somebody he's looking for somebody in
[1:23:40] Atlanta or in Alabama Amen in Smith
[1:23:43] Station he's looking for somebody that
[1:23:46] can be a vessel amen that can say Amen
[1:23:48] Lord use me amen I need to be you want
[1:23:52] to be a present than God Amen I'm
[1:23:54] available to
[1:23:55] you oh my now watch you Moses he came to
[1:24:00] Moses now he said
[1:24:02] Moses um I need to become an I am
[1:24:06] God but I need a
[1:24:08] servant to prove to my people that I am
[1:24:13] still alive that I am the same yesterday
[1:24:16] today and forever that the god of Abram
[1:24:20] is still I am God the god of Isaac is
[1:24:23] still I am God the god of Jacob is still
[1:24:26] I am God you see brother and
[1:24:29] sister Moses my people need to I am God
[1:24:33] for Exodus there's no Exodus God first
[1:24:37] had to be I am
[1:24:39] God and if first had to be I am God to
[1:24:43] somebody God have to start somewhere God
[1:24:47] have a starting point God have a point
[1:24:49] on a place where he begins amen now
[1:24:52] watch here and he started with Moses he
[1:24:54] says Moses there cannot be an exodus
[1:24:57] with I was God but I can produce an
[1:25:00] exodus with if if I can become I am God
[1:25:04] hope you see it now now follow quickly
[1:25:06] now now my people Moses needs a I am God
[1:25:11] a present tense God for the present
[1:25:14] tense
[1:25:17] problems listen there's there's things
[1:25:19] that we have to deal with now there's
[1:25:21] things that Moses had to deal with that
[1:25:24] Abram never had to deal with ABR never
[1:25:26] had to go come on out to face Pharaoh
[1:25:30] Abram never had to go and to face amen
[1:25:33] janas and Jess he never had to go amen
[1:25:36] for a showdown and to challenge them now
[1:25:39] listen there was a present tense problem
[1:25:42] and God we needed a present tense
[1:25:46] God who a God that you've never
[1:25:49] experienced in that way they knew the
[1:25:51] testimony of Abram what God did through
[1:25:54] Abraham and what God did for Abram and
[1:25:56] what God did for Isaac and Jacob but
[1:25:59] listen we God is about to reveal another
[1:26:01] part of himself he's about to prove
[1:26:04] himself the god of the Exodus listen
[1:26:07] every problem we have today started in
[1:26:13] Genesis brother B says so every sickness
[1:26:16] every disease you're not the first one
[1:26:19] sometimes you feel you're the only one
[1:26:21] suffering or you the first one you're
[1:26:23] not the first one hello amen hallelujah
[1:26:27] all the problems you face today started
[1:26:29] in the Book of Genesis every devil every
[1:26:32] disease every trial every tribulation
[1:26:35] somebody in the Bible already went
[1:26:37] through it God already took somebody
[1:26:40] through
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:43] it oh come on now come on now now watch
[1:26:46] here
[1:26:48] now the devil and even God in the
[1:26:51] beginning couldn't do anything listen
[1:26:54] how the Bible starts in the beginning so
[1:26:57] after the word in chaos
[1:27:00] came and let me explain it before the
[1:27:03] word in the devil did nothing before the
[1:27:06] word in God did nothing so what I trying
[1:27:09] to say preacher amen whatever you go
[1:27:11] through you allow the devil to come in
[1:27:15] because only after the word in there was
[1:27:17] chaos Darkness now watch here now God
[1:27:21] told the devil you came in my Genesis
[1:27:24] and you started sicknesses diseases and
[1:27:26] problems so every problem came from the
[1:27:28] book of Genesis but God was about to
[1:27:31] reveal his second book and he said I'll
[1:27:33] call my second book Exodus so for every
[1:27:37] Genesis I will have a Exodus and exodus
[1:27:40] means I'm bringing you out you are
[1:27:42] coming out so whatever the devil put you
[1:27:45] in my God can take you
[1:27:48] out Hallelujah whatever sickness
[1:27:51] whatever Tri whatever storm whatever
[1:27:54] problem you are in my God is the god of
[1:27:56] the
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:27:59] Exodus you will experience the I am God
[1:28:02] and you cannot have an
[1:28:04] exodus God works in three without the
[1:28:07] book of
[1:28:09] leius now Leviticus is a Levi a man sent
[1:28:13] from God I hope you see it so for so you
[1:28:16] cannot have listen now so for every
[1:28:19] Genesis there is an exodus and for every
[1:28:22] Exodus you need the Book of
[1:28:25] Leviticus so you need the Leviticus to
[1:28:28] give you an exodus out of your
[1:28:31] Genesis so whatever Genesis you are in
[1:28:35] tonight God can give you an exodus by
[1:28:38] the preaching of the word oh can
[1:28:40] somebody shout amen you got to you
[1:28:43] better prophesy I'm coming out I'm
[1:28:46] coming out whatever the devil put you in

[1:29:05] cannot bring my people out as a
[1:29:07] historical
[1:29:09] God I cannot bring them out as a past
[1:29:13] tense God and I cannot bring them out as
[1:29:16] a future tense God I need to be a
[1:29:19] present tense God I need for the this I
[1:29:22] need to be I am now watch here for the I
[1:29:25] am for the present tense problem present

[1:29:30] dealing with things in this last days
[1:29:33] that brother Bram never had to deal with
[1:29:34] that's
[1:29:35] right there's some new things the Bible
[1:29:39] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:29:41] flood the spirit of God will raise a
[1:29:44] standard I hope you are seeing it Amen
[1:29:47] brother never had to deal with cell
[1:29:48] phones and there's certain uh uh uh
[1:29:51] sicknesses and tactics of the devil
[1:29:53] although brother Brenham says the devil
[1:29:55] have nothing new right right oh my I
[1:29:58] hope you see it so there's things that
[1:30:00] we have to deal in the present tense
[1:30:02] right and I am God will not help
[1:30:05] you I was God cannot help you you need
[1:30:09] to know that I am God what God is doing
[1:30:12] right now where the move of God is and
[1:30:16] brother bam says God have a bride
[1:30:18] somewhere in the rising of the sun he
[1:30:20] says God there's Church and churches
[1:30:23] bride and bride but there's got to be a
[1:30:25] real bride
[1:30:27] somewhere and a brother he's using his
[1:30:29] bride that's why the last chapter in the
[1:30:31] Bible is Revelations chapter 22 and the
[1:30:34] last Ministry in Revelations 22:17 is
[1:30:37] the spirit and the bride say come so if
[1:30:41] you want to hear the spirit of God you
[1:30:42] need to find the
[1:30:44] bride you need to find the bride for
[1:30:46] your day you need to find the bride in
[1:30:48] your city you need to find the bride in
[1:30:50] your country you need to find the bride
[1:30:53] oh my now watch you I want you to see
[1:30:55] this um I cannot give you an exodus as I
[1:31:00] was God I need to be I am God and I want
[1:31:04] you to see that that's very very
[1:31:05] important for you to see so Abram Isaac
[1:31:08] and Jacob is
[1:31:10] history although brother brandham says
[1:31:12] history means it's his story all right
[1:31:16] it's still his story but history is
[1:31:19] history and then brother Brenham turns
[1:31:20] around he says but we have to take God
[1:31:23] out of history and that's what God
[1:31:26] wanted to do in Moses day he said listen
[1:31:28] Moses to my people I'm just a historical
[1:31:33] God they've heard what I did for Abram
[1:31:36] that's history in Moses day they've
[1:31:39] heard all the stories the supernatural
[1:31:41] stories how the supernatural God made
[1:31:45] himself known as Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[1:31:49] Rafa they knew all the stories oh my I
[1:31:52] want you to see it but yet they were in
[1:31:56] captivity they knew all the stories how
[1:31:59] God do powerful God but let me tell you
[1:32:02] a powerful historical God cannot help
[1:32:07] you all the quotes that they had about
[1:32:10] Abram Isaac and Jacob couldn't help them
[1:32:13] all the beautiful stories of this great
[1:32:16] God couldn't help
[1:32:18] them because they had a new challenge
[1:32:22] A new challenge and brother BR says God
[1:32:25] likes a man that can take the
[1:32:28] challenge and God was asking Moses I can
[1:32:32] you take this challenge I will be with
[1:32:34] you Moses amen and obviously amen they
[1:32:36] had a deal there Moses said listen God
[1:32:38] but what will I do this and what will I
[1:32:40] say who are you and this and this how
[1:32:42] will the people believe me and there was
[1:32:44] there was an agreement that God was
[1:32:46] about to prove himself as that I am
[1:32:49] God I want you to see this now watch
[1:32:51] yeah so I want you to see this now so
[1:32:54] God had a
[1:32:57] problem God had a big problem imagine
[1:33:00] because Abram was dead imagine Isaac was
[1:33:02] in the graveyard Jacob was in the
[1:33:05] graveyard and God had a
[1:33:08] problem because at that stage he was not
[1:33:11] a I am
[1:33:13] God to the people he was I was God he
[1:33:17] was a great historical God I want you to
[1:33:20] see that he said listen he said but I
[1:33:23] want you to understand I have a problem
[1:33:25] here Moses my problem is a I am problem
[1:33:28] isn't that the same problem we have in
[1:33:29] the
[1:33:30] message isn't it the same problem you
[1:33:33] know people are leaving the message
[1:33:34] people are falling this side this way
[1:33:36] people are asking questions you know
[1:33:38] where's the god of William Brenham yeah
[1:33:41] oh brother Brenham gave us an answer you
[1:33:44] need your personal
[1:33:49] experience I believe God is in the
[1:33:53] bride but he knows sometimes how to hide
[1:33:57] himself maybe it's God in Simplicity
[1:34:01] maybe he too simple for people and yet
[1:34:04] people can miss the great God in
[1:34:07] Simplicity that's why before the seals
[1:34:10] the great seals was revealed he preached
[1:34:12] a sermon called God hiding himself in
[1:34:15] Simplicity and God revealing himself in
[1:34:18] Simplicity he said sometimes people cry
[1:34:21] out God God where are God and they don't
[1:34:23] even know that God is in every blade of
[1:34:25] grass they're Hawking over God God is
[1:34:28] all around them and yet they miss
[1:34:31] God come on now I want you to see this I
[1:34:34] want you to see this so God had an I am
[1:34:36] problem God had the I Am problem and I
[1:34:39] cannot be I am what with I was servants
[1:34:41] I was people I was bride God is looking
[1:34:44] for a present tense bright brother you
[1:34:47] better know who you are in this day in
[1:34:50] this hour you better you better know
[1:34:52] where amen where God is moving in this
[1:34:54] day you better find out amen you better
[1:34:57] do some research and praying and seeking
[1:35:00] God you better seek
[1:35:03] God oh because people thought they had
[1:35:06] God and after 40 50 years they realize
[1:35:10] they never had God right you see bra
[1:35:13] says every day with Jesus is a new
[1:35:17] experience oh I need I need to know the
[1:35:20] god of today is not God is not good
[1:35:22] enough for the God for tomorrow right
[1:35:24] you see I need God every day every
[1:35:26] minute I need God I need him to be I am
[1:35:30] because every day you're going to have
[1:35:31] present tense
[1:35:32] problems I like what Jesus said Jesus
[1:35:35] said leave yesterday's problems for
[1:35:38] yesterday right today's problems is
[1:35:41] enough for today right no one day Paul
[1:35:44] he told Paul he said Paul my grace is
[1:35:47] sufficient for you you see for every
[1:35:50] problem there is Grace
[1:35:52] but
[1:35:54] sometimes we can mess with Grace because
[1:35:58] God can give you Grace for that day but
[1:36:01] if you take your problem to the next day
[1:36:05] there's no Grace for
[1:36:09] it why the Bible says his mercies are
[1:36:12] new every
[1:36:15] morning oh so for every problem of every
[1:36:19] new day God do have great and mercy for
[1:36:22] that day you need to embrace it and take
[1:36:26] hold of it and here God came to Abram he
[1:36:28] says listen Abram I cannot be I am God
[1:36:31] with Abra with Abram with Isaac and
[1:36:33] Jacob because they are history now
[1:36:36] follow quickly quickly I'm going to be
[1:36:37] quick I want to be quick and that means
[1:36:40] I want to be a I am God not a historical
[1:36:44] God oh I hope we don't have a historical
[1:36:47] God in the
[1:36:49] message I hope we don't have only a
[1:36:52] historical God and and and and and make
[1:36:54] museums and
[1:36:56] stuff what God did in in the 40s and 50s
[1:36:59] and 60s we honor God for that we even go
[1:37:03] so far back to the beginning we still
[1:37:05] honor God for Genesis right we still
[1:37:07] honor God for Abram which is the father
[1:37:10] of the faith we honor every man of God
[1:37:12] we ever we honor all the servants the
[1:37:15] seven Church eight Messengers we honor
[1:37:17] we honor each and every one of them but
[1:37:19] I'm trying to tell you what
[1:37:21] does God look like
[1:37:24] today not the god of yesterday because
[1:37:27] brother B says he revealed him in every
[1:37:30] Church age
[1:37:31] right in a certain way right oh my god
[1:37:36] there was a reward for every Church age
[1:37:38] right you need to understand the
[1:37:41] characteristics of
[1:37:44] God you know many people used to preach
[1:37:47] uh it's your season it's your season
[1:37:48] it's your season well you can be in a
[1:37:50] different season and I can be in a total
[1:37:52] other season so by preaching uh uh um
[1:37:55] it's your season it's your time it's
[1:37:57] your blessing am mean it doesn't always
[1:37:59] work like that right because our
[1:38:01] personal journey is not the same
[1:38:04] right maybe you're just coming out of
[1:38:06] Egypt and there's some people that's at
[1:38:08] kadis fer and there's a certain group of
[1:38:10] people that's already about to cross the
[1:38:11] Jordan
[1:38:13] right so there can be different seasons
[1:38:15] like Paul had to deal with Corinthians
[1:38:17] Ephesians Philippians different people
[1:38:20] on different levels
[1:38:23] yeah brother B says your personal walk
[1:38:25] is is in Shadow type is with Abram and
[1:38:29] your church walk is what how Israel came
[1:38:32] out of
[1:38:33] Egypt you see that that's a different
[1:38:35] walk your personal walk with God and
[1:38:37] your walk together as a church right you
[1:38:40] got to understand the seasons so God
[1:38:42] spoke to me and he said Don't Preach
[1:38:44] it's your season and he said preach
[1:38:47] finding God in your season there you go
[1:38:51] you need to understand how God looks in
[1:38:53] your
[1:38:55] season listen because sometimes you can
[1:38:58] look at another brother and it's all
[1:39:00] going well with him he's blessed his
[1:39:02] ministry is going forward everything is
[1:39:04] going everything he touches prosper and
[1:39:07] but with your life everything is going
[1:39:08] backwards and another brother next to
[1:39:10] you are so blessed he's got he's get he
[1:39:13] get promotions he's got a nice house
[1:39:15] he's got a nice car and yet but you go
[1:39:17] you lose
[1:39:19] everything it's because you in a to
[1:39:21] little different
[1:39:22] season and now you desire God to do for
[1:39:25] you what he's doing for the next brother
[1:39:28] but you see it doesn't work like that
[1:39:30] you need to
[1:39:32] understand how God looks in your season
[1:39:36] how God smells in your season how God
[1:39:39] talks in your season oh I hope you see
[1:39:42] it praise the name of the Lord you in a
[1:39:44] season where God normally take yourself
[1:39:46] right but there's coming a season where
[1:39:48] God is giving you back with job you know
[1:39:51] why all hell broke loose with job let me
[1:39:54] tell you now something let me tell you
[1:39:56] something the devil cannot attack you he
[1:40:01] needs permission from
[1:40:05] God brother says the devil have to go to
[1:40:08] the throne and ask God for permission to
[1:40:10] attack you you see sometimes the devil
[1:40:13] attack you then it's
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:18] illegal you need to understand when the
[1:40:21] devil is legal and when he's
[1:40:23] illegal because he needs permission to
[1:40:27] attack
[1:40:28] you and you know what happened why all
[1:40:30] hell broke loose on Earth with job
[1:40:33] because God was bragging about job in
[1:40:38] heaven oh I wonder brother and sister
[1:40:40] when all hell breaks loose in your life
[1:40:42] just remember maybe God just bragged
[1:40:44] about you in heaven that's why all hell
[1:40:47] is breaking loose on the earth amen can
[1:40:51] God break about you in heaven praise the
[1:40:53] name of the Lord Brother says God had
[1:40:55] confidence in job although job had no
[1:40:57] confidence in himself but yet God
[1:41:00] trusted
[1:41:01] job the level of your trial tells me God
[1:41:04] is trusting you on that level now watch
[1:41:08] here so watch here I want you to see
[1:41:10] this so they had the historical God Amen
[1:41:13] and he said I cannot help them as a
[1:41:15] historical God and he came to Moses he
[1:41:17] says Moses my people is in trouble they
[1:41:20] have problems they are in sickness they
[1:41:22] in captivity Moses and I want you to
[1:41:25] understand Moses I need to be I am God I
[1:41:28] always want to be an I am God the all
[1:41:31] present God he wants to be present now
[1:41:34] watch here so Moses amen take me out of
[1:41:38] History take me out of the books take me
[1:41:41] out of the tapes bring God in plain view
[1:41:45] and God was about to manifest himself
[1:41:48] now watch here now God says listen I'm
[1:41:51] not a historical God I make history but
[1:41:54] I'm not
[1:41:57] history you better understand the
[1:41:59] difference between making history and
[1:42:02] God is Not history God make history but
[1:42:04] he not history he's always a present T
[1:42:07] God now watch here I want you to see
[1:42:09] this wow oh my Lord I make history I'm
[1:42:12] not history now BR says in a nice quote
[1:42:15] he says if God takes his man he never
[1:42:18] takes his Spirit that's right
[1:42:22] don't make the mistake don't make the
[1:42:25] mistake I I I um rebi once said the
[1:42:28] reason nobody knows where Moses was was
[1:42:31] buried is because if if Israel knew
[1:42:35] where God buried Moses they would have
[1:42:38] spent a lot of time around his grave
[1:42:42] yes they would have wasted a lot of
[1:42:46] time you
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:49] see you see God made
[1:42:53] Moses a amateure
[1:42:55] God and I want you to see that what they
[1:42:58] saw in Moses it was so close to
[1:43:01] worshiping Moses and God didn't have
[1:43:04] time to deal with
[1:43:06] that that's why God never revealed to
[1:43:09] them where he buried
[1:43:11] Moses brother don't waste your time
[1:43:15] sitting by a graveyard day and night
[1:43:18] because God can take his man but in
[1:43:20] never takes his
[1:43:22] Spirit he said his spirit will stay on
[1:43:24] the earth he will just find himself
[1:43:27] another servant and I'm telling you God
[1:43:29] do have a fivefold
[1:43:32] Ministry to produce I am
[1:43:36] God don't misunderstand me I respect the
[1:43:38] graveyard of the Prophet I went there in
[1:43:41] 2019 I do respect it amen but don't
[1:43:44] waste too much time listen we must be
[1:43:47] careful because God never wanted them to
[1:43:50] make that mistake when God put Moses in
[1:43:52] the graveyard it didn't mean they put
[1:43:55] God died with the
[1:43:58] man and that's what brother B said he
[1:44:00] said when when Wesley passed on he said
[1:44:03] they they organized around the man and
[1:44:06] God walked out that's he says he says uh
[1:44:09] uh Wesley will turn in his grave to see
[1:44:12] what his people is doing that's right he
[1:44:14] said and God divorced them and God moved
[1:44:16] on to Pentecost that's what he said and
[1:44:18] they organized them around Great Men
[1:44:21] listen God gives us powerful
[1:44:23] men and we thank God for powerful men
[1:44:27] but the powerful person is the Lord
[1:44:29] Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ he's not just the angel he's the
[1:44:33] mighty Angel he's the greatest Angel
[1:44:38] whoa brother and sister let me tell you
[1:44:40] something amen there don't don't make
[1:44:42] the mistake amen I hope we didn't made
[1:44:44] the mistake when we put the prophet in
[1:44:47] the grave that we put god with him in
[1:44:49] the grave
[1:44:53] we don't want I am God or I was
[1:44:56] God I don't know how you feel but I
[1:44:58] don't wonder I was God I need I am God
[1:45:01] there's different levels of exoduses
[1:45:04] that we need in our lives we need an
[1:45:06] exodus I don't know about you and to get
[1:45:08] the Exodus you need I am
[1:45:11] God brother amen watch here so God had a
[1:45:14] problem and God said Moses I need you to
[1:45:18] show the people that I am I am God and
[1:45:21] not the I was God now watch here Moses I
[1:45:24] need a I am servant a living servant
[1:45:28] right and I want you to see this because
[1:45:30] Israel had the eye wise God and the
[1:45:33] church as many times is sitting with the
[1:45:35] eye wise
[1:45:37] God when you go to many churches you
[1:45:40] will see in that church they they do the
[1:45:42] same thing for the last 100
[1:45:45] years nothing new nothing
[1:45:49] changed
[1:45:51] like brother B says building in a
[1:45:52] straight
[1:45:53] line but when it comes to turning the
[1:45:56] corner you need a skill
[1:45:58] Mission we are changing Brothers it's
[1:46:01] it's it's uh it's times changing it's
[1:46:03] dispensations that's changing and we
[1:46:05] need to know how to turn the
[1:46:08] corner sir brother says when you listen
[1:46:12] to the to the rabbis I listen to another
[1:46:13] Rabbi and he said you know the pillow of
[1:46:16] fire brother says when the pillow of
[1:46:19] fire mov you need to move when the cloud
[1:46:21] move you need to
[1:46:23] move said he said yesterday's manner can
[1:46:27] be poisoned the next
[1:46:29] day give this day our daily bread that's
[1:46:33] the prayer Jesus said we ought to pray
[1:46:35] that's right and the rabbi said this he
[1:46:38] says he says why they moved in the in
[1:46:41] the during the day under a cloud was
[1:46:43] because the desert can become the
[1:46:45] hottest place
[1:46:47] right and they need it sa to travel so
[1:46:52] God was the cloud by day to protect them
[1:46:55] from the Sun and the rabbi said that
[1:46:57] cloud was like a air conditioner in the
[1:47:00] desert he said but but in the evening
[1:47:03] times the desert can become the coldest
[1:47:05] place on Earth and that's why he was a
[1:47:08] pillow of fire he was a heater in the
[1:47:11] evening but in the day he was a air
[1:47:13] conditioner so if you don't stay under
[1:47:15] the pillow of fire you
[1:47:18] die if you don't move you
[1:47:22] die oh the move is
[1:47:25] on sing the move is on my Lord the move
[1:47:27] is on move when the P of fire move move
[1:47:30] when your God
[1:47:33] move that's why many bride churches is
[1:47:39] divorced say if if the husband wants to
[1:47:41] go with his wife and she refuses him he
[1:47:43] can divorce
[1:47:44] her how many churches he said God
[1:47:47] divorced the westling Church yes he
[1:47:49] divorced he divorc the church if you
[1:47:51] don't allow him amen if uh to come into
[1:47:55] you because I mean he's your
[1:47:58] husband so you got to move when he wants
[1:48:01] you to
[1:48:02] move brother and sister now watch I need
[1:48:05] to be quick I need to be quick praise
[1:48:07] the name of the Lord uh he need to be I
[1:48:10] am God yes sir now watch here why amen
[1:48:15] why because the
[1:48:16] bride has some sicknesses that she have
[1:48:18] to deal with there's some sufferings
[1:48:21] there's some problems the bride is in
[1:48:25] chaos and the bride needs a I am
[1:48:31] God to read about the God that was will
[1:48:35] not help us says you need to find the
[1:48:38] word for your day the promise for your
[1:48:40] day the prophecy for your day the
[1:48:42] scripture for your day because the
[1:48:44] scripture for your day gives the
[1:48:47] anointing for your day
[1:48:49] amen that's why Jesus open the book read
[1:48:51] the portion of scripture and he said and
[1:48:54] the anointing is upon me yes this day
[1:48:57] this day so he read the scripture for
[1:48:59] his day and let me tell you Malachi 4 4
[1:49:03] and 5 is beautiful and I thank God that
[1:49:05] he folded I thank God for Luke
[1:49:08] 17:30 I thank God for Matthew 17 I thank

[2:06:07] right right and now we can look back to
[2:06:09] Calvary and just claim so we're not
[2:06:10] asking we are commanding right we are
[2:06:13] commanding them let God's people go now
[2:06:15] watch here I'm going to end off here let
[2:06:18] my people go prophetically means two
[2:06:22] things when Moses went to pharaoh and
[2:06:24] said let my people go it meant they were
[2:06:27] in the wrong place right right you
[2:06:31] cannot tell somebody let that person go
[2:06:34] where to so it means that Israel was in
[2:06:39] a place where they're not supposed to be
[2:06:41] that's
[2:06:43] right that's right so when he went to
[2:06:45] Pharaoh he said let God's people go it
[2:06:47] means God's people people is in a place
[2:06:49] where they're not supposed to
[2:06:51] be and tonight there's bride
[2:06:55] members that's in
[2:06:57] places and they don't belong
[2:07:01] there and prophetically we want to
[2:07:03] release that word and wherever they are
[2:07:05] tonight and whatever Pharaoh is there we
[2:07:08] want to tell them we want to tell the
[2:07:11] devil these people don't belong here
[2:07:14] because what Moses was actually telling
[2:07:16] them is God's people don't long here how
[2:07:19] can you say let God's people
[2:07:22] go it means they're in a place where
[2:07:24] they're not supposed to
[2:07:26] be and they are also in a
[2:07:29] situation where they're not supposed to
[2:07:34] be we can preach all day about that and
[2:07:37] they are also in a condition that
[2:07:39] they're not supposed to be
[2:07:43] in I mean look at the condition of the
[2:07:45] Bride look at the situation that the
[2:07:47] devil is putting you in so whatever
[2:07:49] place the devil is holding you captive
[2:07:52] in whatever situation he's holding you
[2:07:55] captive and whatever condition you in
[2:07:58] brother Brenham told us to never live
[2:08:01] under our god-given
[2:08:03] privileges so tonight we we declare let
[2:08:07] the bride
[2:08:08] [Applause]
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] go so listen we're not in a place where
[2:08:16] we should be we're not in a condition
[2:08:18] and situation where we ought to be he
[2:08:20] says Satan he says Fu my people this is
[2:08:24] not my plan this is not the place where
[2:08:26] I want my people this is not the
[2:08:28] situation that I want my people to be
[2:08:30] in God have a permissive will and God
[2:08:34] have a perfect
[2:08:35] will for them to be in Egypt and where
[2:08:39] they are is only permitted that's right
[2:08:42] but it's not God's perfect will but
[2:08:44] brother Brenham says when the perfect
[2:08:46] will of God comes the permissive will
[2:08:48] must give away now watch here we have
[2:08:51] the perfect will of God this is the
[2:08:53] season this is the time it's the Feast
[2:08:55] of Tabernacles God wants to be in the
[2:08:58] midst of his

[2:13:07] is having what the devil put you in and
[2:13:09] I want you to see that it's absolutely
[2:13:12] important to see that God have a place
[2:13:15] for his bride he does God God needs
[2:13:19] wants to put you in a different
[2:13:21] situation in a Godly
[2:13:24] situation where every day you find

[2:13:35] they're not in a place where they should
[2:13:37] be and you are holding my people
[2:13:40] back and there's a set
[2:13:43] time and I can feel by the spirit of the
[2:13:46] Lord

[2:14:37] church
[2:14:39] is I don't care what message Church it
[2:14:42] is I don't care whatever pharoh there is
[2:14:46] I'm not talking to every message church
[2:14:48] I'm talking to people that playing a
[2:14:50] role of a Phu withholding the people of
[2:14:53] worshiping God in spirit and in truth
[2:14:54] yes amen keeping the people away from
[2:14:56] their
[2:14:57] inheritance keeping them away from the
[2:14:59] Feast of Pentecost keeping them away
[2:15:02] from their Pentecostal experience
[2:15:04] keeping them a way of all the feasts of
[2:15:05] God where God wants to redeem
[2:15:09] them the feast is God God give you
[2:15:12] exodus by his fa by his Feast the Feast
[2:15:14] of Passover was The Exodus and the other
[2:15:17] Feast is to call you together to keep

[2:15:23] happened with the feasts and that's why
[2:15:25] Israel although naturally but it have a
[2:15:28] spiritual meaning to us yeah different
[2:15:30] levels of Revelation in those feasts yes
[2:15:32] sir but says God is fulfilling the Feast
[2:15:35] of Tabernacle in the seven seal and he's

[2:15:45] want that
[2:15:46] brother I want to tell you I don't care
[2:15:51] how big how strong that Pharaoh is God
