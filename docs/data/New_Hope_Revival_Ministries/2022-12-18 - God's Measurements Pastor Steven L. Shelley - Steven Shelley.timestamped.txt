[57:33] start taking their tradition from them
[57:38] I'm telling you old grandmas that love
[57:41] everybody and kiss everybody and pet the
[57:44] kittens
[57:46] you start taking Traditions from them

[58:08] will help you there were two quotations
[58:11] particularly that I missed last night I
[58:14] will not take the time to read them this
[58:16] morning if you can't get the picture in
[58:19] three and a half hours two more quotes
[58:22] wouldn't make a difference but they were
[58:24] some that can somehow sometimes be used
[58:27] to be a little more maybe a little more
[58:29] positive one is from 1949 forgive me for
[58:33] missing that I figured that he said so
[58:36] many things after that that what he said
[58:39] in 49 really might not have been uh
[58:42] necessary to take your time but what we
[58:45] are going to do is we're going to add
[58:47] them to the sheets of quotations that go
[58:49] on the app that go on the website I am
[58:53] going to try to find out brother RJ is
[58:56] not here he's in Kansas with his family
[58:58] but I'm going to try to find out I think
[59:01] that I can also put a PDF
[59:05] uh Hawk do you know if when they put the
[59:08] quotes on the app is that a PDF do you
[59:11] know I'm not sure what it is
[59:14] if it is a PDF uh since the the book
[59:20] mystery Babylon
[59:22] ancient and modern is out of print I
[59:26] don't feel bad
[59:28] to to put that on the app and make the
[59:31] whole book it's too much to print
[59:33] remember I showed you and I had only
[59:36] printed out two chapters and it would it
[59:39] would be several hundred pages of paper
[59:42] and ink if I printed you a copy of that
[59:45] and we're not going to be able to do
[59:46] that we actually don't have the staff to
[59:48] do that and I have some other things I
[59:51] have to keep busy at so we will if if
[59:54] we're allowed we will put that on the
[59:56] app
[59:57] we will put it on the website for sure
[1:00:00] so that you could download the whole
[1:00:01] book and read it it's interesting
[1:00:03] history
[1:00:04] and we will also
[1:00:07] um
[1:00:08] put it on the New Hope private Facebook
[1:00:11] page I know that we can put files there
[1:00:14] and you can download that and have that
[1:00:17] and it's a gift really it's a blessing
[1:00:19] since it has been out of print for so
[1:00:21] many years that's because the interest
[1:00:24] has waned
[1:00:25] people aren't as interested as they were
[1:00:28] at one time I want to say today to uh
[1:00:33] all of you again thank you for being
[1:00:35] here last night thank you for your
[1:00:36] support we want to wish Sister Janet
[1:00:39] Miller a very happy birthday today God
[1:00:42] bless you Sister that's brother Daniel's
[1:00:44] mother and we want to just greet you and
[1:00:47] and let you know we love you and we pray
[1:00:49] for you all and think about you
[1:00:54] [Applause]
[1:00:55] I have a couple of different dates for
[1:00:57] Sister Louise when is her real birthday
[1:00:59] do you do you own a it's in July uh
[1:01:03] somehow on Facebook it got off and it
[1:01:05] and it was listed as tomorrow but I
[1:01:07] remembered from last year that that we
[1:01:09] said the wrong thing but Tuesday of this
[1:01:12] week is brother Greeley's birthday he's
[1:01:15] a a few years north of 50 but not not as
[1:01:19] far north as I am let's wish him a happy
[1:01:22] birthday this week
[1:01:25] Tuesday night
[1:01:30] you know we ought to have him preach on
[1:01:32] his birthday shouldn't we
[1:01:35] and work out
[1:01:37] so let it be written
[1:01:39] so let it be done
[1:01:43] Hallelujah
[1:01:46] you don't get no time off around here or
[1:01:48] birthday or not okay
[1:01:51] okay so we do think we can add a PDF
[1:01:54] that's not what we use now but we think
[1:01:56] we can add a PDF to the app so you could
[1:01:59] have the notes the quotes and also the
[1:02:03] book so that is really great also my
[1:02:07] friend brother Caleb Deron shares a
[1:02:09] birthday with with brother Greely and I
[1:02:12] mentioned that because I know he would
[1:02:13] appreciate our prayers in the church
[1:02:15] there and then on Friday is RJ's
[1:02:18] birthday we want to say a very happy
[1:02:21] birthday to him and although we don't
[1:02:24] get to see Matthew Shepard his birthday
[1:02:26] is on Friday Also and so let that be a
[1:02:29] good day to pray for him he needs the
[1:02:31] Lord and the Lord wants him and we'll
[1:02:34] just pray that God will give him the
[1:02:36] best birthday present ever that he'll
[1:02:38] reveal himself to him I I certainly know
[1:02:41] that God is able to do that and let me
[1:02:44] say to you happy Hanukkah or Hanukkah
[1:02:49] tonight we those who remember the Feast
[1:02:53] of dedication as our Lord did in John
[1:02:56] we will light the first candle this
[1:02:58] evening and we will spend a week
[1:03:00] focusing on the fact that in a very very
[1:03:04] very dark world
[1:03:06] the light has come
[1:03:08] it was once uh once a light that was
[1:03:11] born in a little humble Place
[1:03:13] uh now in one little baby but now that
[1:03:17] light shines in a bride all over the
[1:03:20] world and we have something to celebrate
[1:03:23] this is not the time to make you jealous
[1:03:26] but I have to say that we have breakfast
[1:03:30] brought different sisters Bring
[1:03:32] breakfast for the musicians and the
[1:03:35] pastor
[1:03:36] I'm not a musician but I get a little
[1:03:39] something too and they all do a
[1:03:41] marvelous job they do a wonderful job
[1:03:43] but sister Ashley and David today helped
[1:03:47] I think too
[1:03:48] um he likes to think of himself as a
[1:03:50] cook
[1:03:51] and uh he is the Fried Chicken King that
[1:03:56] I'll tell you it's Hanukkah hint hint
[1:03:59] I'm available a few nights this week

[1:04:09] a Latka is you are not Jewish if you
[1:04:12] don't know first of all and there's a
[1:04:13] lot of people that are not and you're
[1:04:15] not from the south because although we
[1:04:18] never call them latkes or lakis some
[1:04:21] people say in the South my granny called
[1:04:24] them potato pancakes
[1:04:27] and I have to say that Ashley brought
[1:04:29] some of the best ones I've ever had
[1:04:30] today uh homemade and uh that is a
[1:04:34] potato pancake did you what did you have
[1:04:37] onion in it did you not well that was
[1:04:39] one thing missing
[1:04:41] foreign
[1:04:43] Hawk did a good job dressing mine up
[1:04:46] crunchy and uh sour cream and applesauce
[1:04:50] on top
[1:04:52] oh my that ought to make anybody hungry
[1:04:56] but anyway thank you all for doing that
[1:04:58] it was a nice uh surprise to see that as
[1:05:02] we begin a week of of thinking about the
[1:05:05] multiplication of the oil and the
[1:05:08] Miracle working God
[1:05:10] the Jewish people and those who are
[1:05:12] Messianic or those who follow the
[1:05:14] festivals and dedications of the Bible
[1:05:17] they call this a season of Miracles and
[1:05:22] God is still a miracle-working God and
[1:05:25] we still need miracles in our life and
[1:05:28] so there will be lots of donuts consumed
[1:05:31] this week
[1:05:32] and they will not be baked
[1:05:36] they will be oiled very well and I saw
[1:05:40] the dough already being made at my house
[1:05:42] this morning so I'm looking forward to
[1:05:45] that I'm so thankful that the Lord has
[1:05:47] given us one more opportunity to look at
[1:05:50] his word today let me announce that
[1:05:53] there will be a service here Tuesday
[1:05:54] night as you heard at seven o'clock with
[1:05:56] our associate pastor preaching up a
[1:05:59] storm
[1:06:00] for his birthday
[1:06:03] just before they leave sometime toward
[1:06:06] the weekend to go be out of town
[1:06:08] and uh there will be a Hanukkah
[1:06:11] celebration for those of you who want to
[1:06:13] help participate or be with us it's just
[1:06:16] a fellowship that's what it is we just
[1:06:18] fell a ship together it'll be at the
[1:06:20] Tebow's house Friday night at what time

[1:06:42] understand some of you will already be
[1:06:43] out of town and that will actually we'll
[1:06:47] miss you we will miss you but it'll
[1:06:48] actually make it a little easier to move
[1:06:50] around in the house
[1:07:00] but it can really get crowded the last
[1:07:03] time we had it at the Greeley's house uh
[1:07:06] they have a lovely home a beautiful home
[1:07:09] but I was so nervous the whole evening
[1:07:11] because it was so crowded in there and I
[1:07:15] need a little Elbow Room and a little
[1:07:16] breathing space how many of you feel
[1:07:18] that way sometime when the walls start
[1:07:20] closing in on me I don't enjoy myself
[1:07:22] after that but we will certainly miss
[1:07:25] you and next Sunday morning December the
[1:07:28] 25th there will be Sunday service here
[1:07:30] at 11 o'clock just like there would be
[1:07:33] any other Sunday and I'll never forget
[1:07:37] the the uh December 25th that we spent
[1:07:41] was it Roofing or what what was going on
[1:07:43] on the at the church on that time it was
[1:07:45] the roofing the roofing was going on and
[1:07:49] uh there was a big crowd that showed up
[1:07:51] here nobody had anything else to do
[1:07:56] so there was a big crowd everybody was
[1:07:58] off work and that was one of the
[1:07:59] greatest work days we had that morning
[1:08:01] and got a lot accomplished so God is
[1:08:04] good all the time
[1:08:06] and what about that total
[1:08:14] my
[1:08:19] we already were blessed because we
[1:08:22] thought we had a an exceptionally good
[1:08:24] offering last week for it and then this
[1:08:28] 25
[1:08:29] 000 offering came in and we thought my
[1:08:31] now that that is uh about a 31 32
[1:08:35] thousand dollar payment going in this
[1:08:37] month

[1:10:53] to us and we thank God we know there's
[1:10:56] plenty of choices to stream and we thank
[1:10:59] you so much that you chose to be a part
[1:11:01] of our service this morning are you
[1:11:03] ready for the word
[1:11:05] are you 19 verses ready
[1:11:08] can I read that many while you're
[1:11:10] standing I'm going to try to do good
[1:11:12] today
[1:11:13] and uh and be and be briefer
[1:11:19] I'm going to try my best to be briefer
[1:11:22] than last night
[1:11:24] briefer than last night
[1:11:27] and there was given me a read like unto
[1:11:30] a rod just a little more in my Monitor
[1:11:32] if you can and the angel stood saying
[1:11:35] rise and measure the temple of God and
[1:11:39] the altar
[1:11:41] and them that worship therein now I want
[1:11:45] to read that again I'm not going to read
[1:11:47] them all again but I want you to notice
[1:11:51] all that is being measured
[1:11:54] and there was given me a read like unto
[1:11:57] a rod and the angel stood saying rise
[1:12:01] and measure number one the temple of God
[1:12:05] number two the altar of God the altar in
[1:12:10] the temple and number three measure them
[1:12:14] that worship therein
[1:12:18] now we don't often think about people
[1:12:20] being measured we think about buildings
[1:12:23] being measured dimensions and so forth
[1:12:26] width and height and length but we don't
[1:12:29] often think about people but the angel
[1:12:31] said to John get up take this Reed
[1:12:35] and measure also the temple The Altar
[1:12:39] and the people that worship therein
[1:12:41] let's go but the court which is without
[1:12:44] the temple leave out
[1:12:46] and measure it not for it is given unto
[1:12:49] the Gentiles or we could say to the
[1:12:52] Nations and the holy city shall they
[1:12:56] tread Under Foot 40 and two months
[1:13:00] meaning the Gentiles will tread the city
[1:13:04] they will have dominion over the city 42
[1:13:07] months and I will give power unto my two
[1:13:11] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[1:13:16] thousand two hundred and three score
[1:13:18] days clothed in sackcloth and we could
[1:13:22] say like the prophets of old who wore
[1:13:26] sackcloth and who uh rubbed ashes on
[1:13:30] their body as a sign of mourning these
[1:13:33] are the two olive trees remember the
[1:13:36] ones we read about in the writings of
[1:13:38] the Prophet Zechariah and the two
[1:13:41] candlesticks standing before the god of
[1:13:44] the earth and if If any man will hurt
[1:13:47] them fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[1:13:51] and devoureth their enemies and if any
[1:13:54] man will hurt them he must in this
[1:13:58] manner be killed they these have power
[1:14:01] to shut Heaven that it rain not in the
[1:14:04] days of their prophecy like Elijah and
[1:14:08] have power over Waters to turn them to
[1:14:10] blood like Moses and to Smite the Earth
[1:14:14] with all plagues as often as they will
[1:14:18] verse 7 and when they shall have
[1:14:21] finished their testimony the Beast that
[1:14:23] ascendeth out of the bottomless pit
[1:14:25] shall make war against them and shall
[1:14:29] overcome them and kill them they will
[1:14:34] eventually die and their dead bodies
[1:14:37] shall lie in the street of the great
[1:14:39] city which spiritually is called Sodom
[1:14:43] and Egypt where also Oh Our Lord was
[1:14:48] crucified we know it as Jerusalem and
[1:14:51] they of the people and kindreds and
[1:14:53] tongues and Nations shall see their dead
[1:14:56] bodies three days and a half I want you
[1:14:59] to know that in the time of John it was
[1:15:02] absolutely impossible for that to be
[1:15:04] fulfilled this scripture said kindreds
[1:15:07] meaning generations and tongues and
[1:15:11] Nations shall see their dead bodies
[1:15:13] three days and a half how many of you
[1:15:15] know it's very possible in the hour that
[1:15:17] we live in today satellite television
[1:15:20] streaming over the Internet the whole
[1:15:23] world will see the dead bodies of these
[1:15:25] two we you won't
[1:15:27] foreign
[1:15:28] hopefully
[1:15:30] hopefully you've gone with me
[1:15:33] cause I'm leaving in the first boat
[1:15:36] when the dead in Christ rise first we
[1:15:39] which were alive and remain are going to
[1:15:41] be caught up that's that's Rapture for
[1:15:43] us that's for the bride of Christ
[1:15:46] halfway through what we know as that
[1:15:49] last week of Daniel or the seven weeks
[1:15:51] of tribulation uh seven years of
[1:15:54] tribulation the day of the people in
[1:15:57] kindreds and tongues and Nations shall
[1:15:58] see their dead bodies three days and a
[1:16:01] half and shall not suffer their dead
[1:16:03] bodies to be put in Graves
[1:16:07] they that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:16:09] rejoice over them and make Mary
[1:16:16] and shall send gifts one to another
[1:16:18] because these two prophets tormented
[1:16:21] them
[1:16:22] that dwelt on the earth doesn't that
[1:16:24] sound a little eerie
[1:16:26] did you know this kind of thing goes on
[1:16:28] all the time it happened last week in
[1:16:30] Israel
[1:16:31] when there were some Jewish men murdered
[1:16:34] did you know that the Palestinian people
[1:16:37] there celebrate and they go out into the
[1:16:39] streets and give candy
[1:16:41] I saw pictures of uh of of uh soldiers
[1:16:45] of the Palestinian Authority handing out
[1:16:48] candy bags to the adults and to the
[1:16:51] children celebrating the death of a Jew
[1:16:53] this happens right now in our world and
[1:16:57] so I don't have any problem believing
[1:16:59] that it'll be one big celebration these
[1:17:01] two old-timey preachers have been killed
[1:17:04] in the streets and I don't doubt that
[1:17:07] people will rejoice and be happy because
[1:17:09] these two prophets tormented them that
[1:17:11] dwelt on the earth which means they're
[1:17:14] they're preaching perhaps will be
[1:17:16] broadcasted out to the whole earth and
[1:17:19] after three days and a half the spirit
[1:17:21] of life from God entered into them and
[1:17:24] they stood upon their feet and great
[1:17:27] fear fell upon them which saw them what
[1:17:30] about it if you'd have been there giving
[1:17:31] away candy and present celebrating their
[1:17:34] death and all of a sudden you're
[1:17:36] standing on the street corner and these
[1:17:37] two men that have been laying there
[1:17:39] three and a half days should stand up on
[1:17:41] their feet raised to Life by the power
[1:17:43] of God you talk about people realizing
[1:17:45] that's it you're it this is the end of
[1:17:47] it now and they heard a great voice from
[1:17:50] Heaven saying unto them come up hither
[1:17:52] and they ascended up to heaven in a
[1:17:54] cloud and their enemies beheld them just
[1:17:58] like the bride leaves in Revelation
[1:18:00] chapter 4.
[1:18:02] same kind of call
[1:18:05] and at the same hour there was a great
[1:18:07] earthquake and the tenth part of the
[1:18:10] city fell and in the earthquake were
[1:18:12] slain of men seven thousand and the
[1:18:15] remnant were afraided and gave glory to
[1:18:19] the god of Heaven the second war is
[1:18:22] passed and behold the third wool cometh
[1:18:25] quickly and the seventh angel sounded
[1:18:28] and there were great voices in heaven
[1:18:30] saying the kingdoms of this world are
[1:18:34] become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
[1:18:37] his Messiah of his Christ and he shall
[1:18:41] reign forever and ever
[1:18:44] and the Four and Twenty Elders which sat
[1:18:47] before God on their seats fell upon
[1:18:50] their faces and worshiped God saying we
[1:18:53] give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty
[1:18:56] which art and washed and art to come
[1:18:58] because thou Hast taken to thee thy
[1:19:01] great power and Hast reigned couple more
[1:19:05] verses and the nations were angry and
[1:19:08] thy wrath has come and the time of the
[1:19:10] Dead that they should be judged and that
[1:19:13] thou shouldest give reward unto thy
[1:19:15] servants the prophets and to the Saints
[1:19:17] and them that fear thy name small and
[1:19:20] great and should this destroy them which
[1:19:23] destroy the Earth and the temple of God
[1:19:27] was opened in heaven
[1:19:30] and there was seen in his Temple the Ark
[1:19:34] of his testimony the Ark of the Covenant
[1:19:37] and there were lightning say it with me
[1:19:40] Lightnings and voices and thunderings
[1:19:45] and an earthquake and great hail may God
[1:19:49] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[1:19:51] word you may be seated I want to
[1:19:54] minister in in uh in the time that I
[1:19:57] have this morning I appreciate where we
[1:20:01] were last night but we're not there now
[1:20:03] we're in a new place and we have laid it
[1:20:06] out and now we go on I want to preach to
[1:20:09] you this morning measured by God's
[1:20:12] pattern I want you to know that he has a
[1:20:15] pattern
[1:20:16] I feel a little emotional here because
[1:20:19] of that scripture reading God has a
[1:20:21] pattern and and we are being measured
[1:20:24] even worshipers are being measured in
[1:20:27] this hour it's a prophetic thing and
[1:20:30] you're not going to be measured by the
[1:20:32] church's pattern
[1:20:33] you're not going to be measured by
[1:20:35] denominational pattern you're not going
[1:20:37] to be measured by CNN or Fox news's
[1:20:41] pattern or the writers and great
[1:20:43] philosophers of Our Generation but you
[1:20:47] and I along with the rest of the world
[1:20:49] all of us we are going to be measured by
[1:20:52] God's pattern amen by God's pattern
[1:20:56] now we know that the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:00] Christ will never stand before the great
[1:21:03] white Throne Judgment of Our Lord we
[1:21:06] will stand with him and judge the
[1:21:09] nations of the world the bride is chosen
[1:21:12] to be judges with him but every person
[1:21:16] who is not a part of that bride of
[1:21:18] Christ will stand before the great white
[1:21:21] Throne Judgment of the Lord and
[1:21:23] everything that they have ever done in
[1:21:25] this life will be brought up
[1:21:27] and even the things they did in the name
[1:21:30] of God will be brought up and their
[1:21:33] motive even will be judged not only evil
[1:21:36] things they did but things they did in
[1:21:39] the Name of Christ will also be judged
[1:21:42] and their motive will be sifted through
[1:21:44] now why do you say the bride doesn't
[1:21:48] have to stand in the Judgment that day
[1:21:50] because whether you recognize it or not
[1:21:52] your judgment is now
[1:21:55] the little bride is being judged now
[1:21:58] somebody said how is that we are being
[1:22:01] sifted we are being tested we are being
[1:22:06] tried we are being squeezed around the
[1:22:10] corner we will know some persecution we
[1:22:13] have known hardship we have known the
[1:22:17] bitterness of failure we've known what
[1:22:20] it's like to start out and miss the mark
[1:22:23] and have to go back and recalibrate and
[1:22:27] re-aim so that we don't miss the Mark we
[1:22:30] have stood strong and at times we have
[1:22:33] fallen short but God's grace His
[1:22:38] Marvelous Grace His Amazing Grace Has
[1:22:43] Lifted us every time from the pit that
[1:22:45] we found ourselves in can anybody say
[1:22:48] Amen when we failed he saw us and he
[1:22:52] loved us with an everlasting and eternal
[1:22:54] love he didn't love us less when we
[1:22:57] disobeyed him he loved us more when we
[1:23:01] failed because he knew that we would
[1:23:03] allow him to work his work of redemption
[1:23:06] in US what you find ugly God looks down
[1:23:10] and he says Oh What a Beautiful work
[1:23:14] they're allowing me sister April is
[1:23:17] allowing me to do a beautiful work of
[1:23:21] redemption in her life and it pleases
[1:23:24] the Lord he's not pleased with her
[1:23:26] failure but he's pleased that even in
[1:23:29] her weakness
[1:23:31] she submits herself to him in submission
[1:23:34] and obedience and he gets to come with
[1:23:36] this silver Redemption and work his work
[1:23:39] like a like a mother needs the doe he's
[1:23:42] needing her heart
[1:23:44] he's needing he's doing it for David
[1:23:46] Brother David he's doing it for all of
[1:23:49] us
[1:23:49] and he's needing our heart and he's
[1:23:52] working in us a beautiful and great work
[1:23:54] of redemption so the bride does not
[1:23:57] Escape
[1:23:58] she just has a different season
[1:24:03] and this is our season
[1:24:05] we're being tested and tried
[1:24:07] we're going to have to get it right
[1:24:10] it is as though the angel of the Lord
[1:24:13] Has Come
[1:24:14] with a reed like unto a rod and he's not
[1:24:18] only men measuring the things that be of
[1:24:20] God
[1:24:21] but he is measuring the people of God
[1:24:24] and he is reminding us that through the
[1:24:27] years we have picked up so many times
[1:24:30] the cockovers you know you walk through
[1:24:33] through a grassy field and you you don't
[1:24:36] even know until you've come out the
[1:24:38] other side that you've picked up the
[1:24:40] cockleburs I don't know about you but
[1:24:43] sometimes I get out of my vehicle and I
[1:24:45] go on in the house and I look down in my
[1:24:48] pants are muddy and it hadn't even
[1:24:50] really been in the mud but you know what
[1:24:52] I did I don't know why I do it maybe you
[1:24:55] don't do it I don't know why it happens
[1:24:56] to me so much but I drag my leg when I
[1:24:59] get out of the vehicle and any mud
[1:25:02] that's still wet on my on my running
[1:25:04] board it'll get on the on the leg of my
[1:25:06] jeans when I go to get out of the
[1:25:08] vehicle now sometimes I find myself how
[1:25:10] did I get that on me and then I remember
[1:25:12] that it was on the running board and so
[1:25:15] I didn't even realize when it happened
[1:25:16] or the cockle bird got a hold of me
[1:25:19] didn't even realize when it did a
[1:25:21] blemish a stain how many of you have
[1:25:23] never passed by a mirror and say why
[1:25:25] didn't somebody tell me that I have
[1:25:27] breakfast in my beard
[1:25:30] we didn't even know it was there
[1:25:33] last night I went home I prayed for
[1:25:36] those of you who went to to Taco Bell
[1:25:38] through the drive-through after a
[1:25:40] service like that who in the world could
[1:25:42] eat Taco Bell
[1:25:44] anytime
[1:25:45] but who could eat it after a meeting
[1:25:47] like that I went home and they made me
[1:25:50] scrambled eggs with cheese
[1:25:52] and Olivia I didn't know it it was so
[1:25:54] good I probably did eat kind of fast
[1:25:56] hadn't eaten in a while and and was
[1:25:58] ready for something and Olivia said dad
[1:26:00] you got cheese hanging out of your beard
[1:26:03] so I just had to reach up and somebody
[1:26:05] said that's so gross well I can't help
[1:26:07] it it's just the way life is things get
[1:26:09] on us
[1:26:10] and we don't even know there
[1:26:12] but the wonderful
[1:26:14] grace of God comes with the word and he
[1:26:18] measures us
[1:26:19] he brings conviction to our heart and he
[1:26:22] lets us know you've got off course and
[1:26:25] we have nobody to blame
[1:26:27] but ourselves
[1:26:29] most of the time
[1:26:31] now I'd like to read a scripture that I
[1:26:34] missed last night
[1:26:35] and they don't have it up there and uh
[1:26:38] so they may not even get to pull it up I
[1:26:41] don't know Austin is on the computer and
[1:26:43] you know what that means we're very
[1:26:46] blessed to have his help
[1:26:47] Jeremiah 16.
[1:26:50] 19 through 21 of course he showed up in
[1:26:53] my office this morning he said brother
[1:26:55] Shelley said charity took a break and
[1:26:57] she said he's right here and then you
[1:26:59] got up and pulled something from over
[1:27:01] there somewhere and I didn't have it up
[1:27:03] it didn't matter what ounce one bit I
[1:27:06] appreciated what they did did you know
[1:27:08] that when I finished last night just
[1:27:10] before I finished in the last few
[1:27:12] minutes charity was still putting the
[1:27:14] information in
[1:27:15] still trying to get it in there so that
[1:27:17] we could show it on the screen there was
[1:27:19] that much that had to be put in don't
[1:27:21] you think she's almost a hero for that
[1:27:23] work let's thank God for her
[1:27:26] hey do better than that
[1:27:30] and all these Austin too and Mariah too
[1:27:34] and Jennifer Stark too and
[1:27:36] whoever helps with that
[1:27:38] Jeremiah chapter 16 verse 19 through 21
[1:27:42] just let me insert this here and you
[1:27:45] think about this this will kind of get
[1:27:47] you
[1:27:47] oh Lord my strength way to go
[1:27:51] oh Lord my strength and my Fortress and
[1:27:55] my refuge in the day of affliction
[1:27:58] the Gentiles shall come unto thee from
[1:28:01] the ends of the Earth and shall say
[1:28:03] surely our fathers have inherited lies
[1:28:13] it's easy to blame people
[1:28:17] it's easy to blame those who've gone
[1:28:19] before us but just remember that they
[1:28:22] too inherited lies from their fathers
[1:28:28] passed them down and now you have come
[1:28:31] on the scene and you have inherited some
[1:28:34] lies
[1:28:35] surely our fathers have inherited lies
[1:28:38] vanity and things wherein there is no
[1:28:41] Prophet can you say man shall a man make
[1:28:44] Gods unto himself and they and they are
[1:28:46] no Gods therefore behold I will once I
[1:28:51] will this once cause them to know my
[1:28:55] hand and my might and they shall know
[1:28:58] that my name is the Lord
[1:29:02] there's coming an hour that truth is
[1:29:06] going to be known whether people have
[1:29:08] faith to receive it or not now I'm
[1:29:10] talking about in judgment I'm talking
[1:29:12] about at the end of this thing aren't
[1:29:15] you glad that God works with his people
[1:29:17] in this hour and he brings us to truth
[1:29:20] now and we don't have to wait until an
[1:29:22] hour that it is too late
[1:29:25] so I want you to notice that John was
[1:29:28] told to measure the temple and the Altar
[1:29:31] and them that worship therein not just
[1:29:34] the building not just the furniture but
[1:29:37] also the people were to be measured the
[1:29:40] worshipers to measure is to determine
[1:29:44] the dimensions of a particular something
[1:29:48] to ascertain the size the amount or
[1:29:53] degree of something by using an
[1:29:57] instrument or device
[1:30:00] marked in standard units
[1:30:03] or by comparing it with an agreed
[1:30:08] standard if I were to come as I I did
[1:30:12] one time and brought a a fold out I
[1:30:15] think Nathan might have been the one
[1:30:16] helped me a fold out measuring stick one
[1:30:20] that unfolds like that I think maybe
[1:30:22] brother Greeley had used something like
[1:30:24] that too and we always sing about
[1:30:25] brother George bringing his level and
[1:30:28] and putting it up here to measure when
[1:30:30] something is in Balance but to measure
[1:30:33] you can't just measure by your thought
[1:30:36] or by your opinion there has got to be a
[1:30:39] standard absolute
[1:30:41] there's got to be something fixed
[1:30:45] if we're going to compare one thing to
[1:30:48] another thing we've got to measure it by
[1:30:50] a standard and both things have to be
[1:30:53] measured by something that is agreed
[1:30:56] upon as a absolute or as a standard unit
[1:31:02] God also measures his people
[1:31:06] to determine Conformity to his pattern
[1:31:09] his will and his purposes God is very
[1:31:14] specific
[1:31:17] waiting on you
[1:31:19] God is very specific when he gives us a
[1:31:23] pattern or a standard for something that
[1:31:25] he desires for instance in Genesis
[1:31:29] chapter 6 and verse 14 through 16 and
[1:31:35] the Amplified it says make yourself an
[1:31:39] ark of gopher or Cypresswood making it
[1:31:42] rooms stalls pins coops nests cages and
[1:31:47] compartments and cover it inside and
[1:31:51] outside with pitch are our bitumen is
[1:31:56] that right yes bitterman and this is the
[1:32:00] way you are to make it the length of the
[1:32:03] Ark shall be 300 cubits its breadth 50
[1:32:08] cubits and its height 30 cubits that is
[1:32:13] 450 feet by 75 feet by 45 feet I want
[1:32:19] you to know that Noah hold that up there
[1:32:21] the next verse we're going there in just
[1:32:24] a moment I want you to know that Noah he
[1:32:27] didn't wake up one morning God said
[1:32:29] build me an ark any way you want to
[1:32:33] you design it nor I trust you you make
[1:32:36] the ark however you like oh no God was
[1:32:39] very specific
[1:32:42] I wanted to be so many cubic times so
[1:32:46] many cubits long and so many cubits wide
[1:32:49] he said You shall make a roof or window
[1:32:51] a place for light for the ark and finish
[1:32:56] it to a cubit which is at least 18
[1:32:58] inches above and the door of the Ark you
[1:33:02] shall put in the side of it and you
[1:33:04] shall make it with lower second and
[1:33:08] third stories I want you to know it was
[1:33:11] as though an architect
[1:33:13] yes
[1:33:14] had drawn it out an engineer had drawn
[1:33:18] it out in their mind and delivered this
[1:33:20] word to Noah now I want you to know Noah
[1:33:23] was held to the standard of measurement
[1:33:26] that God gave him
[1:33:27] I want you to know Noah would have found
[1:33:30] trouble in his relationship with God if
[1:33:33] he would have shorted the arkhiness
[1:33:38] because God didn't just suggest it
[1:33:42] how many of you know the Ten
[1:33:43] Commandments are suggestions
[1:33:47] they're Commandments
[1:33:49] so was how the ark was to be built and
[1:33:52] to shorted one inch could have got Noah
[1:33:55] in some trouble you and I come short of
[1:33:58] this word one inch
[1:34:03] and it can cause us some trouble why
[1:34:05] because God knows what he wants
[1:34:08] he knows what he loves he knows what he
[1:34:11] requires is anybody with me
[1:34:14] then there came a time that God said I'm
[1:34:17] going to dwell in a in a mishkan in
[1:34:20] Hebrew we say mishcon I'm going to dwell
[1:34:23] in a tabernacle now a tabernacle is not
[1:34:27] a permanent place of dwelling a
[1:34:29] tabernacle is a portable Place usually
[1:34:31] that's what it means in the Bible a
[1:34:34] place that can be transported from one
[1:34:37] spot to another let's go to Exodus 25
[1:34:40] and read verse 8 and 9 and let them make
[1:34:44] me a sanctuary that I may dwell among
[1:34:47] them this was God's desire he wanted to
[1:34:51] come and be with us
[1:34:53] he wanted to go to church with us
[1:34:56] he wanted to fellowship with us he
[1:34:58] wanted to dwell with us and he goes on
[1:35:01] to say according to all that I show thee
[1:35:05] after the pattern of the Tabernacle and
[1:35:10] the pattern of all the instruments
[1:35:12] thereof even so shall ye make it now I
[1:35:18] want you to look at the reasons why
[1:35:20] there was a need for the Tabernacle of
[1:35:22] Moses do you have those
[1:35:28] number one
[1:35:30] so that God might dwell among his people
[1:35:35] number two so that God might teach his
[1:35:40] people of his holiness
[1:35:42] number three so that God might teach his
[1:35:47] people of their sinfulness now I want
[1:35:50] you to know notice the order
[1:35:52] cannot understand sinfulness
[1:35:55] until you understand righteousness or
[1:35:59] Holiness so God said I'm going to have a
[1:36:02] house built and I'm going to come down
[1:36:04] and dwell and fellowship with man and
[1:36:07] I'm going to reveal to them my
[1:36:09] righteousness and my Holiness And when
[1:36:12] they see my Holiness they will recognize
[1:36:16] their sinfulness
[1:36:19] when they see my righteousness they will
[1:36:22] recognize their unrighteousness anybody
[1:36:26] with me now I know this is going to be a
[1:36:28] little slower has to be has to be
[1:36:30] because I didn't want to go anything
[1:36:32] into anything you know uh we've done
[1:36:36] done heavy we did Heavy last night
[1:36:39] so I I want this is pretty heavy but I
[1:36:41] wanted to do something a little simple
[1:36:43] so I want you to stay with me just a
[1:36:45] moment and then number four so that God
[1:36:48] might teach his people to approach him
[1:36:50] with offerings
[1:36:53] this had to be revealed there was no
[1:36:55] Temple there was no sacrificial system
[1:36:57] there was no offering system God is
[1:36:59] about to begin to reveal that so let's
[1:37:01] look at those four reasons again number
[1:37:03] one so that God might dwell among his
[1:37:06] people number two so that God might
[1:37:08] teach his people of his Holiness see God
[1:37:11] didn't want to just come and visit and
[1:37:13] go back
[1:37:14] he'd been doing that
[1:37:17] he wanted to come and hang out with his
[1:37:19] people is that okay to say God was
[1:37:21] revealing something already about his
[1:37:23] nature number three so that God might
[1:37:26] teach us his people or teach his people
[1:37:28] of their sinfulness and number four so
[1:37:31] that God might teach his people to
[1:37:33] approach him with offerings now Moses
[1:37:36] notice in the scripture Moses had to go
[1:37:39] somewhere to get the pattern
[1:37:44] he had to go up
[1:37:46] he had to get a little higher if you
[1:37:49] want to know what God wants you to know
[1:37:50] you're going to have to get up above
[1:37:52] what you think
[1:37:55] you're going to have to get up above the
[1:37:57] comfortable
[1:37:58] and you're going to have to come up into
[1:38:00] the cloud where God reveals himself look
[1:38:03] at Exodus 24 verse 16 through 18 and the
[1:38:08] glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount Sinai
[1:38:11] and the cloud covered it six days and
[1:38:15] the seventh day he called unto Moses out
[1:38:18] of the midst of the cloud and the sight
[1:38:20] of the glory of the Lord was like
[1:38:23] devouring fire on the top of the mount
[1:38:25] in the eyes of the children of Israel
[1:38:28] and Moses went into the midst of the
[1:38:32] cloud and got him up into the mount and
[1:38:36] Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40
[1:38:39] nights how many of you know that was
[1:38:41] causing some trouble back down in the
[1:38:42] camp we read that last night Moses
[1:38:46] literally had to come up out of Earth's
[1:38:48] environment
[1:38:49] he had to come up out of his comfort
[1:38:51] zone he had to go into the presence of
[1:38:54] the glory Cloud for God to begin to
[1:38:56] reveal to him his pattern and his plan
[1:38:59] you will not discover God's will for
[1:39:02] your life dwelling in
[1:39:06] in hello
[1:39:07] you got to get up and that's why worship
[1:39:10] is so important sometimes people talk
[1:39:12] about us because we emphasize praise and
[1:39:15] worship as though it was some mighty
[1:39:17] weapon that's exactly what it is it is
[1:39:20] because it delivers us out of our
[1:39:22] present circumstances it gets us above
[1:39:25] our feelings
[1:39:26] if we keep going high we get above our
[1:39:29] opinions
[1:39:31] and God starts revealing himself to us
[1:39:34] how many of you really care what God
[1:39:37] likes
[1:39:41] sister Ruth used to say what in the
[1:39:43] world would happen if you spent your
[1:39:47] whole life
[1:39:48] making God a cherry pie
[1:39:52] and found out that he really preferred
[1:39:54] Apple
[1:39:58] wouldn't you be embarrassed
[1:40:03] well let me go ahead and tell you I
[1:40:04] prefer Apple
[1:40:09] I'll eat your cherry but I have
[1:40:11] preferences just like everybody else see
[1:40:15] now you don't want to spend your whole
[1:40:16] life baking God the wrong kind of pie
[1:40:19] so there's a standard
[1:40:21] his word
[1:40:23] the message of the hour and the standard
[1:40:27] of the local church
[1:40:29] you know I hold them all pretty equal
[1:40:32] I know some people don't but I hold them
[1:40:35] all pretty equal I believe the message
[1:40:37] of the hour is is very vitally important
[1:40:41] for us just like the word
[1:40:44] to understand what God is looking for
[1:40:46] from his people in this hour and I also
[1:40:50] believe that the standard of the church
[1:40:52] serves a very similar purpose in our
[1:40:55] life
[1:40:57] I believe our pastor has authority to
[1:41:00] establish such a standard if he has been
[1:41:03] in the cloud just be honest with you if
[1:41:06] he spends time in the cloud he ought to
[1:41:09] be able to step out of the cloud and say
[1:41:10] God wants this church doing it this way
[1:41:14] and if that lines up with the message
[1:41:17] and that lines up with the word guess
[1:41:20] what you got to do
[1:41:21] you've got to line up
[1:41:27] I'm not going to set a standard in this
[1:41:29] church apple pie over cherry pie
[1:41:33] I'm not going to get up here and say
[1:41:34] thou shall not bake cherry pie
[1:41:40] but if what I get up and declare to you
[1:41:43] can be lined up with the word
[1:41:46] and lined up with the message of the
[1:41:48] hour you don't get a choice
[1:41:51] I don't have a choice I have to say not
[1:41:54] my will Lord but your will be done well
[1:41:58] I don't get courtship I don't get the
[1:42:01] way you all do things here but does it
[1:42:03] line up with the word does it line up
[1:42:05] with the truth that has been established
[1:42:08] to us then that's how we're going to do
[1:42:09] it
[1:42:12] because God has a set measuring standard
[1:42:17] and this is how we are being measured in
[1:42:19] this hour
[1:42:20] I tell you the church is lost out
[1:42:23] the bride can't afford to lose out in
[1:42:26] this I'm not going to get no more
[1:42:27] specific than that
[1:42:29] come on if my pastor gets up and says I
[1:42:32] want you sisters to make your skirts
[1:42:34] longer because you're getting shorter
[1:42:36] and shorter I think with I really
[1:42:39] believe this you pray for me if I'm
[1:42:40] wrong I really believe that's exactly
[1:42:42] what you ought to do
[1:42:44] because the message teaches it
[1:42:46] and the word of God teaches modesty is a
[1:42:49] standard I don't think there ought to be
[1:42:50] any more discussion about it I think
[1:42:53] people just say okay
[1:42:56] we don't have to pay no attention to
[1:42:57] that but if it lines up with the word
[1:43:00] and it lines up with the message I gotta
[1:43:03] line up with that
[1:43:04] God's pattern for living it's
[1:43:07] established by his book is am I with me
[1:43:10] I didn't mean her to be taught
[1:43:13] we're getting tied and I didn't leave
[1:43:15] her to get tight
[1:43:17] come on
[1:43:19] if my pastor were to get up and say you
[1:43:21] need to spend less time on them video
[1:43:23] games and more time with your children
[1:43:27] I believe that lines up with the message
[1:43:28] I believe that lines up with the word
[1:43:33] you know God didn't give us these
[1:43:35] children just to get them off of our
[1:43:36] income taxes dependents
[1:43:43] he gave them to us to disciple
[1:43:50] now here's my problem
[1:43:53] someone mentioned and I and I did leave
[1:43:55] out that little quote I'm not gonna go
[1:43:56] deep I'm not going to mention much I'm
[1:43:58] very delicate here because I don't want
[1:44:00] to go back to that subject
[1:44:02] someone did mention to me about a
[1:44:04] statement that he he made about the
[1:44:07] little kitties you know doing this for
[1:44:09] the little kitties he did say something
[1:44:10] like that a couple times doing a little
[1:44:12] something for the kitties but here's the
[1:44:13] problem with that when are we going to
[1:44:16] wean the kitties
[1:44:19] how are we going to wean them off of
[1:44:21] these little pretty things
[1:44:23] put up a tree because your little
[1:44:25] children are small how are you going to
[1:44:27] decide one day they're old enough to
[1:44:29] know better
[1:44:30] I feel that way when I see you putting
[1:44:32] your little girls in these britches and
[1:44:34] rompers and things like that yes
[1:44:37] I feel that how in the world are you
[1:44:40] gonna know when it's time well you'll
[1:44:42] know maybe I hope you will I hope you'll
[1:44:44] finally eventually discover when it is
[1:44:46] but I want you to know that I'm seeing
[1:44:48] them now on Facebook on Instagram that
[1:44:51] tall
[1:44:52] in little Bridges
[1:44:54] a little skirt about right there
[1:44:56] britches down the bottom and Ruffles
[1:44:59] down around the legs of the britches
[1:45:00] what do y'all what do you call them I
[1:45:03] don't know what you call them
[1:45:04] no these aren't quite leggings because
[1:45:06] they're they're they're they do fit kind
[1:45:09] of like a leggy but they've got Ruffles
[1:45:10] that go down on the bottom they don't go
[1:45:13] up they go down on the bottom they're
[1:45:14] riches
[1:45:16] let's just call them what they are
[1:45:18] they're riches and I see the little
[1:45:20] girls doing that now what in the world
[1:45:22] how if they're if they're in the babe in
[1:45:25] the arm
[1:45:25] somebody said well I'd be all right now
[1:45:27] they're walking
[1:45:29] and now they're standing This Tall
[1:45:32] next to that who is going to have the
[1:45:34] courage
[1:45:36] somebody's going to have to say okay
[1:45:38] you've reached the age who knows the
[1:45:40] Bible doesn't tell us what age
[1:45:42] the Bible just said we shouldn't wear
[1:45:44] that which pertaining to a man so how
[1:45:46] are we going to know the aid do you
[1:45:48] understand
[1:45:50] that this is how compromise has begun
[1:45:53] nobody really knows what age to stop
[1:45:56] them
[1:45:57] okay now we mentioned last night the
[1:45:59] little bangs that they that sister
[1:46:01] Branham put on the little girls Rebecca
[1:46:04] and Sarah
[1:46:05] she ought not to done that
[1:46:07] somebody said you ought not to speak ill
[1:46:09] of the dead I'm not judging her she's
[1:46:11] with the Lord but she ought not to done
[1:46:14] that two reasons she knew what the word
[1:46:16] said number one
[1:46:18] and she knew what her husband said
[1:46:21] shouldn't that be enough
[1:46:24] whoa this is getting rougher than I
[1:46:26] thought it was going to get
[1:46:29] now how how is she going to know
[1:46:33] if somebody doesn't tell her how is she
[1:46:35] going to know when they get old enough
[1:46:37] to know that they ought not to be doing
[1:46:39] such a sad
[1:46:42] so we we want our kitties to be taken
[1:46:45] care of
[1:46:47] we want them to be celebrated I do I
[1:46:50] mean it I mean I want them to I want
[1:46:52] them to know that they are loved not
[1:46:55] only by their parents and their
[1:46:57] grandparents but their adopted
[1:46:59] grandparents
[1:47:01] I want him to know that pat pat loves
[1:47:04] them
[1:47:05] and I want them to know that they're
[1:47:07] surrounded by Community of Faith that
[1:47:10] loves them and we don't want them to do
[1:47:12] without anything they they need and we
[1:47:16] want them to have a lot of what they
[1:47:17] want
[1:47:18] because we appreciate the fact that we
[1:47:21] have them
[1:47:23] but how are we going to be able to
[1:47:26] discern when they get old enough to
[1:47:29] start changing the standard for them
[1:47:32] you see here's the problem my wife grew
[1:47:35] up in a wonderful message home with
[1:47:38] parents that loved her very much she
[1:47:40] eventually rebelled and had to have her
[1:47:42] own experience with God and come back to
[1:47:45] God but one of the problems was Revival
[1:47:48] meeting they had no Fellowship they
[1:47:49] lived way away from any of the churches
[1:47:51] at the ever fellowship with and there
[1:47:54] were times growing up that the TV would
[1:47:56] go out of the home and come back into
[1:47:58] the home and go out of the home and come
[1:48:00] back into the home and go out of the
[1:48:02] home and come back into the home
[1:48:04] and so that becomes very confusing
[1:48:08] how are you going to teach your children
[1:48:09] you ought not to sit in front of that
[1:48:11] thing if you get weary
[1:48:14] from lack of fellowship and you set it
[1:48:16] down in front of them again
[1:48:21] there must be a standard
[1:48:25] there must be a measurement an absolute
[1:48:29] so that we can raise our children in the
[1:48:33] faith did you just happen to have it in
[1:48:36] your pocket
[1:48:37] oh thank you I wouldn't have been
[1:48:39] surprised
[1:48:41] if Nathan would have told me that that
[1:48:43] was in his pocket I wouldn't have been
[1:48:44] shocked
[1:48:47] the boys got 50 Keys all the time
[1:48:51] somebody told him one time must have
[1:48:53] told him Marquis you have the more
[1:48:55] important you are and so he cares just
[1:48:57] about every key got two or three knives
[1:48:59] uh probably strapped pistols somewhere
[1:49:03] anime
[1:49:04] animistic
[1:49:08] so that we don't just have to say yay
[1:49:11] not that long
[1:49:12] we can say exactly how long
[1:49:16] because God has a pattern and a standard
[1:49:20] and an absolute and some of that is not
[1:49:24] open for interpretation
[1:49:26] because we can't get the art one it's
[1:49:29] shorter than it's supposed to be cause
[1:49:32] the giraffe may live on the third story
[1:49:36] and if he does his neck's got to be up
[1:49:38] there
[1:49:39] God saw all of that even when Noah
[1:49:41] didn't see all of it he had to follow so
[1:49:44] it come down to the Tabernacle and God
[1:49:46] began to give very very specific
[1:49:49] instructions about the Tabernacle
[1:49:52] with Moses to go over his desires
[1:50:01] he even had an idea about how long the
[1:50:04] tent pegs
[1:50:06] should be made
[1:50:08] can you imagine
[1:50:09] wouldn't it have been enough to say now
[1:50:11] Moses that Tabernacle is a tent it's
[1:50:15] going to have to have tent pegs
[1:50:18] you make them out of such and such
[1:50:21] seem to me like common sense
[1:50:23] you could figure out in a hurry about
[1:50:25] how long a tent Pig ought to have to be
[1:50:28] to hold down a tent
[1:50:30] but Moses might not have been an
[1:50:32] engineer see
[1:50:34] and God wanted to give him every
[1:50:36] instruction and even told him how many
[1:50:38] inches we're going to say inches for the
[1:50:40] sake of interpretation how many inches
[1:50:43] the tent Peg should be now that means if
[1:50:46] there were to be 300 tent pegs and God
[1:50:48] wanted them all just say 15 inches long
[1:50:51] all of them had to be 15 inches long and
[1:50:54] what happens is if you bring God a tent
[1:50:55] Peg that's 13 inches when he told you to
[1:50:58] make him 115 inches he's going to reject
[1:51:01] the one that don't fit the measure
[1:51:04] why wouldn't you if you were a boss man
[1:51:07] on a job and you told a man to go saw
[1:51:09] some planks and you told him exactly how
[1:51:12] many feet to make every one of them and
[1:51:14] bring them back and he brought you two
[1:51:15] too short and three too long wouldn't
[1:51:17] you ask him if he knew what he was doing
[1:51:20] do you need to go back on unemployment a
[1:51:23] while
[1:51:24] cause I'm about done with you
[1:51:26] it's time for you to get this right
[1:51:29] Moses could not have just built it the
[1:51:31] way he wanted to or even the easiest way
[1:51:34] he thought it could be built and then
[1:51:36] asked God to approve it he had to build
[1:51:38] it God's way
[1:51:40] by God's Design By God's measurements
[1:51:44] Moses had to go right up into that Glory
[1:51:47] Cloud to get the divine revelation in
[1:51:50] the divine presence of God and I want
[1:51:53] you to know the will of God and the mind
[1:51:56] of God concerning his word still comes
[1:51:58] to the bride by divine revelation if you
[1:52:01] believe that same man if we read all of
[1:52:04] Genesis 25 God gives very specific
[1:52:07] instructions concerning all the
[1:52:09] measurements and all the various
[1:52:10] Implements of the Tabernacle
[1:52:13] it appears as we make our way through
[1:52:15] the next chapters from Exodus 25 all the
[1:52:19] way to Exodus 31 that God gives
[1:52:22] extremely meticulous and detail he gets
[1:52:24] extremely meticulous and detailed in his
[1:52:27] material choice
[1:52:29] make it out of this
[1:52:31] his color choice
[1:52:36] now Lord
[1:52:38] I got some beautiful gray cloth on sale
[1:52:41] last week
[1:52:47] I don't know why sister Joyce came to
[1:52:49] mind
[1:52:51] because she is not a compromiser but she
[1:52:54] is a bargain shopper
[1:52:57] did I say it all right
[1:53:01] I believe if God said purple she'd make
[1:53:04] purple
[1:53:05] but you couldn't come and say now Lord
[1:53:08] why do I need to make it purple when I
[1:53:11] found some beautiful material last week
[1:53:15] on sale
[1:53:17] just enough it must be God
[1:53:25] I hear people doing that gotta be God
[1:53:30] just like the man who sat in my office
[1:53:31] some years ago and told me after already
[1:53:34] being married a time or two that God had
[1:53:36] given him a wife and I gave him the word
[1:53:39] and I gave him the message of the hour
[1:53:41] but it was too late
[1:53:43] because God had already told him he
[1:53:45] could marry this wife well he's not with
[1:53:46] her now
[1:53:51] see
[1:53:52] God must be God got to be God
[1:53:55] because somebody showed interest in me
[1:53:59] come on
[1:54:01] it's got to be God because we like the
[1:54:03] same things
[1:54:06] got to be God because we're hungry for
[1:54:09] truth
[1:54:10] no no no no not because you got it on
[1:54:13] sale not because it's close enough to
[1:54:16] purple that you can get by with it God
[1:54:18] was very specific I wanted out of this
[1:54:21] kind of material I wanted this color I
[1:54:24] want it sewn with this color thread
[1:54:27] and I want to tell you how to decorate
[1:54:29] it
[1:54:30] he said I want you to embroider uh
[1:54:34] Cherry beams
[1:54:36] I want you to uh he told us what to put
[1:54:39] on the drapes
[1:54:41] what to put on the curtains
[1:54:43] God didn't know about The Farmhouse
[1:54:45] trend
[1:54:48] so sister Megan yovich he didn't paint
[1:54:51] everything White
[1:54:54] he had his own color palette
[1:54:57] he had his own material list
[1:55:00] he had his own design plan and anything
[1:55:04] less than what pleases God
[1:55:07] and it will not draw his presence
[1:55:12] if we want the presence of God Among Us
[1:55:15] we've got to follow the pattern
[1:55:19] nothing less
[1:55:21] not even anything more just what God is
[1:55:24] asked of us
[1:55:26] and then we read in First Kings
[1:55:30] chapter 6.
[1:55:32] verse 1 through 14 in the Amplified
[1:55:36] Bible
[1:55:37] in 480 years after the Israelites came
[1:55:41] out of the land of Egypt in the fourth
[1:55:43] year of Solomon's Reign Over Israel in
[1:55:46] the second month ziv he began to build
[1:55:49] the Lord's House
[1:55:50] the length of the house Solomon built
[1:55:53] for the Lord with 60 cubits its breath
[1:55:55] 20 and its height 30 cubits the length
[1:55:58] of the vestibule in front of the temple
[1:56:00] was 20 cubits equal to the width of the
[1:56:03] house and its depth in front of the
[1:56:05] house was 10 cubits for the house he
[1:56:08] made narrow lattice windows
[1:56:11] against the wall of the house he built
[1:56:13] Chambers running around the walls of the
[1:56:15] house both of the Holy place of the holy
[1:56:17] of holies and he made side Chambers all
[1:56:20] around where did he get these ideas he
[1:56:23] got them from the Tabernacle
[1:56:28] he was allowed some Liberty by the
[1:56:31] leadership of the Holy Spirit but but
[1:56:34] the the the bones the structure the the
[1:56:38] measurement the the way it was to be
[1:56:42] designed with three chambers it had to
[1:56:45] be according to the pattern
[1:56:48] against the wall of the house he built
[1:56:51] Chambers running around the walls of the
[1:56:52] house both of the Holy place and of the
[1:56:54] holy of holies and he made side Chambers
[1:56:56] all around the first story side Chambers
[1:56:59] were five cubits wide those of the
[1:57:02] middle story six cubits of the third
[1:57:04] story seven cubits for around the
[1:57:06] outside of the wall of the house he made
[1:57:08] offsets in order that the supporting
[1:57:10] beam should not be thrust into the walls
[1:57:12] of the house what was Solomon's
[1:57:13] profession
[1:57:15] he was a king
[1:57:18] sounds like an engineer
[1:57:20] sounds like he had some Divine
[1:57:22] instruction sounds like God was with him
[1:57:25] come on
[1:57:27] when the house was being built its Stone
[1:57:29] was made ready at the Quarry and no
[1:57:31] Hammer that's according to the
[1:57:32] instructions of the Lord and no hammer
[1:57:35] no ax or tool of iron was heard in the
[1:57:39] house while it was building can you
[1:57:42] imagine
[1:57:43] there's nothing any worse than renting a
[1:57:45] condo at the beach for a week of
[1:57:47] vacation getting there to find out
[1:57:49] there's construction on the condo next
[1:57:50] to you
[1:57:52] been there done that
[1:57:58] you're sitting out on the balcony
[1:58:00] wanting to enjoy the sound of the waves
[1:58:03] and the Cool Breeze blow in
[1:58:12] did I do good
[1:58:16] well that wore me out
[1:58:20] God said I don't want anything to
[1:58:22] disturb the presence
[1:58:24] I'm in this building project
[1:58:26] I want the stones to be brought in here
[1:58:29] and by the time they get here there to
[1:58:32] be laid on top of one another without
[1:58:34] any chiseling
[1:58:37] out here in the Quarry is where the work
[1:58:40] must go on because once it begins to
[1:58:42] come to be built no Hammer no ax or tool
[1:58:45] of iron was heard in the house while it
[1:58:49] was in building I find that outstanding
[1:58:52] the entrance to the lowest side chamber
[1:58:54] was on the right or the South side of
[1:58:56] the house and one went up winding stairs
[1:58:58] into the Middle Chamber and from the
[1:59:00] middle into the third and it goes on so
[1:59:03] Solomon built the temple building and
[1:59:05] finished it and roofed the house with
[1:59:08] beams and Boards of cedar
[1:59:10] verse 10 then he built the stories of
[1:59:13] Chambers the lean to against all the
[1:59:15] house each story five cubits high and it
[1:59:17] was joined to the house with Timbers of
[1:59:19] Cedar so the word of the Lord came to
[1:59:21] Solomon saying
[1:59:23] concerning this house which you are
[1:59:26] building
[1:59:27] if you will walk in my
[1:59:34] statutes
[1:59:36] execute my
[1:59:39] precepts
[1:59:41] and keep all my Commandments to walk in
[1:59:46] them
[1:59:47] then
[1:59:51] you're with me
[1:59:53] then I will fulfill to you my promises
[1:59:56] which I made to David your father
[1:59:59] and I will dwell among the Israelites
[2:00:01] and will not forsake My People Israel
[2:00:07] so Solomon built the house and finished
[2:00:11] it
[2:00:12] the approval of God came down to Solomon
[2:00:18] and said Son you have done well but
[2:00:22] you're not finished just yet I want you
[2:00:26] to walk in my statutes I want you to
[2:00:30] execute my precepts and keep all my
[2:00:34] Commandments to walk in them and then I
[2:00:37] will fulfill every promise in First
[2:00:40] Kings chapter 6 the rest of the chapter
[2:00:42] he goes on to give very specific
[2:00:45] instructions and details about the
[2:00:47] building of the inner chamber and the
[2:00:50] holy of holies in First Kings chapter 6
[2:00:53] the last two verses of the chapter 37
[2:00:56] and 38 he says this in the fourth year
[2:00:59] the foundation of the Lord's House was
[2:01:01] laid in the second month zeeve in the
[2:01:05] 11th year in Bull the eighth month the
[2:01:08] house was finished throughout according
[2:01:10] to all its specifications so he was
[2:01:12] seven years in building it I want you to
[2:01:16] know it was some kind of a house for the
[2:01:19] Lord to dwell in
[2:01:20] seven years in the making
[2:01:23] oh what Glory was to fall on that house
[2:01:27] we draw the conclusion after reading
[2:01:30] these chapters concerning the
[2:01:32] construction design and building of the
[2:01:34] Holy Temple that God is deeply concerned
[2:01:38] with the details of the place where he
[2:01:40] intends to dwell with his spirit
[2:01:44] the Tabernacle
[2:01:46] then the
[2:01:49] what came after the Tabernacle
[2:01:52] where did God dwell after the Tabernacle
[2:01:56] what are we talking about now
[2:01:59] the temple
[2:02:01] first the Tabernacle
[2:02:03] then the temple
[2:02:05] and then
[2:02:07] us
[2:02:08] me
[2:02:10] Acts chapter 7.
[2:02:13] 45 through 50. let's read it quickly
[2:02:16] which also our fathers that came after
[2:02:18] brought in with Jesus into the
[2:02:21] possession of the Gentiles whom God
[2:02:23] drave out before the face of our fathers
[2:02:26] under the days of David who found favor
[2:02:28] before God and desired to find the
[2:02:30] Tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[2:02:33] Solomon built him a house how be at the
[2:02:36] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[2:02:38] with hands as saith the prophet Heaven
[2:02:41] is my throne
[2:02:42] what was what was the Apostle saying in
[2:02:45] Acts he was saying that building is
[2:02:47] magnificent but it's not great enough
[2:02:51] big enough expansive enough to contain
[2:02:54] the Living God God said Heaven is my
[2:02:58] Throne the Earth is my footstool have
[2:03:01] you ever tried to see him that way
[2:03:04] I've tried to see him that way great old
[2:03:08] big God sitting up there in eternity
[2:03:13] with his feet his ankles crossed and his
[2:03:17] feet propped up on the Earth
[2:03:19] like a footstool like you pull an
[2:03:22] ottoman up and that's how big he is you
[2:03:24] could never contain a God Like That
[2:03:26] Heaven is my Throne the Earth is my
[2:03:30] footstool what house will ye build me
[2:03:35] saith the Lord or what is the place of
[2:03:40] my rest hath not my hand made all these
[2:03:44] things the question remains for us
[2:03:48] what house
[2:03:50] will you build me
[2:03:52] will you do it in your own way or will
[2:03:54] you do it in God's way
[2:03:57] will you live according to your own
[2:03:59] thoughts every man doing what is right
[2:04:02] in his own eyes or will you do it
[2:04:04] according to the measurement will you
[2:04:07] take time to find the standard
[2:04:08] measurement will you take time to find
[2:04:11] the absolute which is the word of God
[2:04:13] and the message of the hour placed in
[2:04:16] the word of God are you still with me
[2:04:20] the bride of Christ in our day is to be
[2:04:22] measured by God's ideas his designs and
[2:04:25] his standards his absolute requirements
[2:04:28] have been preserved for us in the Old
[2:04:31] Testament
[2:04:32] in the newer Testament even the message
[2:04:36] of the hour and the teachings of our
[2:04:38] pastor because they must also be based
[2:04:41] on God's pattern as he has revealed it
[2:04:43] in his word we do not have to guess or
[2:04:47] assume to know what the pattern is it
[2:04:49] has been outlined for us carefully and
[2:04:52] preserved for our guidance can anybody
[2:04:55] say Amen in Ezra chapter 8 I want you to
[2:04:59] stay with me for the last part of this
[2:05:00] message and I'm I'm moving into that
[2:05:03] direction right now
[2:05:05] just for those of you who are interested
[2:05:08] page six of of ten somebody said what
[2:05:11] does that matter for you because you
[2:05:12] could spend all day on page six but I'm
[2:05:15] not going to
[2:05:16] in Ezra chapter eight there's a word
[2:05:19] that comes from the Lord to gather the
[2:05:21] people together and to number them or
[2:05:24] measure them for the journey and we find
[2:05:28] that Ezra gathered 50 000 people toward
[2:05:33] the river of ahava now if you know
[2:05:37] anything about modern Hebrew you know
[2:05:39] that ahava in Hebrew means anybody love
[2:05:45] it's love
[2:05:47] 50 000 men have been gathered by the
[2:05:50] word of the Lord and they are being sent
[2:05:53] toward the River of Love the river of
[2:05:56] ahava because they're going to be going
[2:05:58] home they have been exiled and now in
[2:06:02] Babylon and now they're going to be
[2:06:04] driven back to Jerusalem and they're
[2:06:06] going to re-establish
[2:06:08] reconsecrate and rebuild the city and
[2:06:11] rededicated unto God
[2:06:13] Ezra 8 15 says and I gathered them
[2:06:16] together to the river that runeth to
[2:06:18] ahava and there Abode we intense three
[2:06:22] days and I viewed the people and the
[2:06:25] priests and found their nun of the sons
[2:06:29] of Levi I don't think you're listening
[2:06:31] I want you with me for this latter part
[2:06:33] if you can possibly be
[2:06:35] I viewed the people Ezra said
[2:06:38] I viewed the priest and I quickly
[2:06:41] calculated that I couldn't find any of
[2:06:44] the Levites among the priests there were
[2:06:46] other priests other Priestly families
[2:06:49] the Levites had a very particular job to
[2:06:52] do as priest unto the Lord they were the
[2:06:55] ones who bore the holy vessels of God
[2:06:57] they were the ones who carried the
[2:06:58] Tabernacle from place to place and so
[2:07:01] here we are finally leaving prison
[2:07:05] finally leaving captivity
[2:07:08] and 50 000 of us are ready to go and
[2:07:11] Ezra the prophet of the Lord
[2:07:13] is looking across the crowd and he said
[2:07:16] we got a problem here I find some priest
[2:07:19] but I don't find any Levites how are we
[2:07:22] going to move forward without the
[2:07:23] Levites who was Levi Levi was one of the
[2:07:27] 12 sons of Jacob one of the twelve sons
[2:07:29] of Israel Joshua 21 tells us that there
[2:07:32] were 48 cities that were inhabited by
[2:07:35] the sons of Levi 48 cities that was a
[2:07:39] crowd of folks it wasn't a handful of
[2:07:41] levitical priests it was cities full of
[2:07:45] levitical priests
[2:07:46] they count the closest to the Tabernacle
[2:07:49] how many of you remember that they
[2:07:51] surrounded the Tabernacle when it moved
[2:07:53] to its next location when the pillar of
[2:07:55] fire would move they moved with it in
[2:07:58] Joshua chapter 3 verses 3 and 4 and they
[2:08:01] commanded the people saying when you see
[2:08:04] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your
[2:08:05] God and the priest of the Levites
[2:08:07] bearing it then you shall remove from
[2:08:09] your place and go after it yet there
[2:08:11] shall be a space between you and it
[2:08:13] about 2 000 cubits my measure come not
[2:08:16] near unto it that you may know the way
[2:08:18] by which you must go for ye have not
[2:08:20] passed this way heretofore it was the
[2:08:23] responsibility of the Levites to
[2:08:25] maintain the cords to maintain the
[2:08:27] curtains to maintain the poles to
[2:08:30] maintain the boards to maintain the bars
[2:08:33] to take care of the badger skins and
[2:08:35] even carry the sacred furniture
[2:08:39] Deuteronomy 33 9-10 who said unto his
[2:08:43] father and to his mother I have not seen
[2:08:46] him neither did he acknowledge his
[2:08:48] Brethren nor knew his own children for
[2:08:51] they have observed Thy word and kept thy
[2:08:56] Covenant they shall teach Jacob he's
[2:08:58] talking about the Levites they shall
[2:09:01] teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy
[2:09:03] law they shall put incense before thee
[2:09:06] and Holbert sacrifice upon thine altar
[2:09:09] what is being said here
[2:09:11] in the Tyndale Bible commentary I just
[2:09:13] chose Tyndale it was the first one I had
[2:09:16] access to and I grabbed it
[2:09:18] the tribe of Levi set their duty to
[2:09:20] Yahweh above all the claims of their
[2:09:23] Kindred this led them to devote
[2:09:26] themselves to the service of Yahweh so
[2:09:29] that in times of national crisis when
[2:09:31] people turned aside to other gods they
[2:09:34] administered Swift and severe punishment
[2:09:38] to evildoers whoever they were whether
[2:09:41] members of their own family or not when
[2:09:44] God chose the tribe of Levi he chose
[2:09:48] them because he saw in them the strength
[2:09:51] of character not to compromise
[2:09:56] not even for their own parents
[2:10:01] not even for their own children
[2:10:05] are their own family members
[2:10:08] many many men have lost their Ministries
[2:10:11] because they lost their family
[2:10:16] many pastors have lost their influence
[2:10:19] because they compromise with their own
[2:10:22] children God said I've got to have a
[2:10:25] priesthood that will lay the word out
[2:10:28] guard the standard of God guard the
[2:10:32] precepts of God
[2:10:34] you can take a pig and dress it up in a
[2:10:37] long skirt and take the ear Bobs off
[2:10:42] but it's still a pig
[2:10:44] until it has a nature change
[2:10:47] you can't bring your children to God by
[2:10:51] dressing them up and putting them in
[2:10:54] service
[2:10:56] it's a heart issue
[2:10:59] it's a matter of the heart
[2:11:02] sometimes I think about my wife I
[2:11:05] mentioned to you about her straying year
[2:11:08] uh in University and I think about her
[2:11:11] sometime her parents loved her so much
[2:11:14] and they worried over so much that's how
[2:11:16] I met her I met her in a picture
[2:11:19] when her mother
[2:11:21] showed me her picture I was preaching
[2:11:23] for brother Ivan Carr and she comes up
[2:11:26] like so many mothers did in those days I
[2:11:29] I I I I was considered a catch back then
[2:11:34] boy how things change
[2:11:37] and sister Whitaker come up like other
[2:11:39] mothers and she just unfolded her
[2:11:42] picture you know how you
[2:11:44] know how you
[2:11:48] and she just put them pictures up and
[2:11:51] she said this one right here's my
[2:11:52] daughter remember her she really needs
[2:11:55] the Lord
[2:11:57] well I just go and said her never you
[2:12:00] know it's so strange
[2:12:03] I never in a million years would have
[2:12:06] thought I'm praying for my wife
[2:12:11] your sister Whitaker and her
[2:12:12] sister-in-law said here's our family I
[2:12:14] want you to pray over our family and
[2:12:16] pray for my daughter right there I would
[2:12:18] have never known
[2:12:19] and when my wife was going through a
[2:12:21] dark time in her life her parents wanted
[2:12:23] to do everything they could to get her
[2:12:25] around other young people
[2:12:27] because some people think that all the
[2:12:29] young people of this message are just
[2:12:32] really Superior and
[2:12:35] oh I've seen so much cruelty
[2:12:40] so much mocking one another
[2:12:42] calling one another names
[2:12:47] around the young people of this message
[2:12:49] so that when I hear they're having a
[2:12:52] youth camp or when I hear they're having
[2:12:53] a move of God I Rejoice with everything
[2:12:56] that's within me because I know that the
[2:12:59] same devil out there that's after the
[2:13:01] world is after them
[2:13:03] and they're not they're not perfect
[2:13:05] because they're brought up around this
[2:13:07] message because many of them inherited
[2:13:09] lies from their parents
[2:13:12] and they're in the same bad shape but
[2:13:15] but my my in-laws they thought if we
[2:13:17] could just get uh Stacy to be with some
[2:13:19] of the young people and so brother
[2:13:21] George and sister Rebecca were going to
[2:13:23] Europe
[2:13:24] with a big group of young people and
[2:13:26] they were going to be in Germany and
[2:13:28] several places sister Laurel was on that
[2:13:30] same trip and they sent my wife and my
[2:13:33] wife had a nice time she met some nice
[2:13:35] people she enjoyed the science but that
[2:13:37] didn't change her life it didn't make
[2:13:39] her want more of God it didn't make her
[2:13:41] want more a church
[2:13:45] right we get real crafty sometimes
[2:13:50] you think because you drags a young
[2:13:52] person to a meeting
[2:13:54] that's that's going to make the
[2:13:56] difference in their life let me tell you
[2:13:57] something sometimes you'd be doing a
[2:13:59] better service to him to spend extra
[2:14:01] time on your knees and prayer for them
[2:14:03] that when they're ready to come God will
[2:14:05] draw them
[2:14:06] I don't mean not invite them but I mean
[2:14:08] Dragon them is not always the answer now
[2:14:11] they live in your house
[2:14:13] you know how I feel about that
[2:14:18] we're going to church
[2:14:20] you eat my cereal eat my eggs and drink
[2:14:23] my milk you're going to church too
[2:14:26] and God's been mighty good to us
[2:14:28] we can be so thankful to say that we
[2:14:31] never had to call our children twice to
[2:14:33] get them up and get them ready for
[2:14:34] church I pray that as they get out on
[2:14:37] their own at some point in life that
[2:14:39] they don't have to be drugged I pray
[2:14:40] Jenna never has to shake Benjamin and
[2:14:43] beg him to go to church
[2:14:50] I pray that Olivia never one of these
[2:14:53] days 30 years from now
[2:14:55] I pray she never has to shame her
[2:14:58] husband
[2:15:00] to try to get him to come to church
[2:15:02] I pray that it's instilled in them now
[2:15:05] while we have this opportunity listen
[2:15:06] their parents here that miss their
[2:15:08] opportunity and they grieve over it
[2:15:10] don't you young parents make the same
[2:15:12] mistake that others have made you live
[2:15:15] this in front of them instill this in
[2:15:17] them don't compromise with sin and then
[2:15:20] expect them to take the high road when
[2:15:23] you won't take the high road
[2:15:25] so these were men chosen specifically
[2:15:28] because they were going to guard the
[2:15:31] word of the Lord no matter what Mom and
[2:15:33] Daddy did no matter what their children
[2:15:35] did they were going to stand and Tyndale
[2:15:38] said they were chosen for that
[2:15:40] particular reason
[2:15:42] and they were if and I'll show it to you
[2:15:44] in Exodus 32 quickly
[2:15:50] verse 25 Exodus 32 I like this it goes
[2:15:53] along with what we were scripture we
[2:15:54] read last night
[2:15:56] and when Moses saw that the people were
[2:15:58] naked
[2:16:01] not only were they worshiping a golden
[2:16:03] calf they'd stripped their clothes off
[2:16:07] sounds like a Christmas party around
[2:16:08] around the world today don't it and when
[2:16:11] Moses saw that the people were naked for
[2:16:13] air and had made them naked under their
[2:16:15] shame among their enemies
[2:16:17] then Moses stood in the gate of the camp
[2:16:19] and said who is on the Lord's Side
[2:16:22] let him come unto me and all the sons of
[2:16:26] Levi gathered themselves together unto
[2:16:31] him
[2:16:32] somebody say all
[2:16:35] every one of them ran
[2:16:38] to the aid of the prophet
[2:16:41] said unto them thus saith the Lord God
[2:16:43] of Israel put every man is sword by his
[2:16:46] side go in and out from gate to gate
[2:16:49] throughout the camp and slay
[2:16:53] every man his brother
[2:16:56] and to every man His companion and every
[2:17:00] man his neighbor
[2:17:01] [Music]
[2:17:04] and the children of Levi did according
[2:17:07] to the word of Moses
[2:17:09] and there fell that day about 3
[2:17:13] 000 men
[2:17:15] for Moses had said consecrate yourselves
[2:17:18] today to the Lord even every man upon
[2:17:20] his son and upon his brother that he may
[2:17:23] bestow upon you a blessing this day I
[2:17:27] want you to know the sons of Levi were
[2:17:29] loyal to the word
[2:17:32] they weren't just loyal to the scripture
[2:17:34] they were loyal to the prophet right and
[2:17:38] the prophet said put your sword on
[2:17:40] and go through this community gate to
[2:17:43] gate
[2:17:45] he didn't say
[2:17:47] cut off their welfare
[2:17:49] or take their food stamps from them
[2:17:52] he said you slay them
[2:17:54] what was their crime dancing naked
[2:17:56] before that golden calf
[2:17:59] trying to mix paganism with with their
[2:18:01] faith
[2:18:03] trying to worship the Living God in a
[2:18:06] way that other gods were being worshiped
[2:18:08] God didn't want any part of that and the
[2:18:11] sons of Levi were very loyal and very
[2:18:13] faithful and second chronicles 17 and 9
[2:18:17] it says and they taught in Judah and had
[2:18:20] the book of The Law of the Lord with
[2:18:21] them they went about throughout all the
[2:18:23] cities of Judah and taught among the
[2:18:25] people so they weren't just soldiers in
[2:18:27] the Lord's army they were also teachers
[2:18:29] they not only guarded the word they
[2:18:31] broke the word down and they began to
[2:18:34] teach people how many of you know it's
[2:18:36] one thing to preach it's another thing
[2:18:37] to take time sometime and and just teach
[2:18:40] people on a one-on-one just sit down
[2:18:43] with people and share the word of the
[2:18:45] Lord with them that's what the sons of
[2:18:46] Levi did but when it finally came time
[2:18:49] to leave exile
[2:18:53] to leave the land of Babylon behind
[2:18:56] where were the sons of Levi then
[2:19:00] when it comes time to turn the people
[2:19:03] back toward Holiness where are the sons
[2:19:06] of Levi now
[2:19:09] when it comes time to call out paganism
[2:19:11] in Christianity where are the sons of
[2:19:15] Levi now we need them
[2:19:21] the holy priesthood of God
[2:19:24] we have everything and everyone else we
[2:19:27] have Innovative new programs we have
[2:19:29] coffee shops in the church we have cell
[2:19:32] groups we bait everybody with Donuts to
[2:19:35] get them to a service we have recovery
[2:19:37] classes of every kind
[2:19:40] we have musical entertainment
[2:19:42] we have big conferences with big gun
[2:19:45] speakers to draw the crowds
[2:19:48] but where are the sons of Levi
[2:19:51] who will take an unpopular stand for the
[2:19:54] word of God for the people for the
[2:19:56] instructions and the patterns that God
[2:19:59] has outlined for the people music is not
[2:20:02] enough
[2:20:03] glossy brochures are not enough smoke
[2:20:06] machines are not enough
[2:20:08] they're not going to get the job done
[2:20:10] come on colored lighted backgrounds and
[2:20:14] acrylic see-through pulpits
[2:20:17] will not get the job done we need the
[2:20:22] sons of Levi
[2:20:24] who will teach patiently
[2:20:27] the Oracles of God
[2:20:30] but who are also willing to arm
[2:20:33] themselves with a sword and execute the
[2:20:36] Justice of the Living God
[2:20:39] sometimes preaching is In Love sometimes
[2:20:42] it's with a sword but I'm telling you we
[2:20:45] need that love and we need the humility
[2:20:47] of teaching and sometimes we need the
[2:20:50] sword of preaching and sometimes we need
[2:20:52] a pastor who will stand up at the end of
[2:20:55] the service and say I need to talk to
[2:20:57] you all about some of the things I see
[2:20:59] coming in the church
[2:21:02] you say I don't think you ought to talk
[2:21:04] about yourself somebody's got to tell
[2:21:05] you
[2:21:07] we need that sometime
[2:21:10] we need somebody who'll sit around the
[2:21:12] table with us and answer our sincere
[2:21:14] questions
[2:21:16] but we also need someone who will come
[2:21:19] up here brother like a brother Greeley
[2:21:21] who will stand here and open his mouth
[2:21:26] wasn't afraid
[2:21:29] when God gave him this mandate
[2:21:32] it was a rebuke
[2:21:35] we're raising money because it's the
[2:21:37] right thing to do
[2:21:39] but it started with a rebuke
[2:21:42] I can't trust you with what you got
[2:21:45] and here you are believing me for more
[2:21:49] I'm paraphrasing I'm just paraphrasing
[2:21:52] and he did he wasn't afraid he he you
[2:21:54] know said a little something to me
[2:21:56] uh uh maybe just before but I had no
[2:21:59] idea the message that he was going to
[2:22:01] bring and how that was going to go out
[2:22:03] he stood here without fear of man he
[2:22:07] stood here because he know that knows
[2:22:09] that I have placed confidence in him and
[2:22:12] you have placed confidence in him and he
[2:22:15] must have known enough about my heart to
[2:22:17] know that I wasn't going to be offended
[2:22:19] or take it personal but I was going to
[2:22:22] take it to heart he must have known that
[2:22:24] somehow you were not going to walk out
[2:22:27] of here with a fence but you were going
[2:22:29] to take it to heart and how many of you
[2:22:31] know
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:34] don't hear you
[2:22:40] [Applause]
[2:22:42] what was nearly a half a million dollars
[2:22:45] has come down to
[2:22:48] 188 42203
[2:22:54] because we didn't just need somebody to
[2:22:56] come and tell us how good we've been
[2:22:58] doing
[2:22:59] we need that sometime
[2:23:02] we need that sometime
[2:23:04] but we needed somebody to come and tell
[2:23:06] us if you want God to trust you with
[2:23:08] something else if you want to see their
[2:23:10] us whoa
[2:23:18] if you want me to trust you with
[2:23:20] something else and see the rest of this
[2:23:22] Vision fulfilled
[2:23:25] why do you continue to labor under such
[2:23:27] a heavy load when if you trust me I'll
[2:23:29] help you get out
[2:23:32] sister Flo already had a burden
[2:23:35] she already had a vision
[2:23:38] she wanted us to put up a box
[2:23:41] I think what we chose to do work better
[2:23:43] than the box but she said do whatever
[2:23:45] you have to do if you had to put a box
[2:23:47] out there and lock it up and say put
[2:23:49] your put money in it toward the
[2:23:50] principle of this property let's just
[2:23:52] get that done
[2:23:54] so he brother Greeley wasn't the only
[2:23:55] one that had the burden but the burden
[2:23:57] began to move and begin to stir when it
[2:23:59] come time to raise money for the studio
[2:24:00] and it hadn't it hasn't by any means
[2:24:02] reached its potential
[2:24:04] of what God's going to do with it I I
[2:24:07] I'm not in the least bit discouraged but
[2:24:09] I'm not going to say anything until I
[2:24:10] know what I'm saying
[2:24:11] but he's going to use every bit of that
[2:24:13] for his glory and when it came time that
[2:24:16] we had a choice to make between one set
[2:24:18] of equipment and another set of
[2:24:19] equipment it was some of these ladies
[2:24:21] that stood up in the prayer meeting
[2:24:22] later in the service and said let us not
[2:24:25] sell God short
[2:24:28] if the vision is from God the provision
[2:24:31] will come from God
[2:24:35] let's type one at home
[2:24:38] let's save money here and there let's do
[2:24:40] what we have to but let us not give God
[2:24:43] anything less
[2:24:45] than the very best
[2:24:48] there's something about that kind of a
[2:24:50] mindset
[2:24:51] that will help you break out of poverty
[2:24:54] when you start seeing your giving to God
[2:24:57] as a way out of your own trouble and
[2:24:59] trial instead of begrudgingly holding on
[2:25:02] I must be preaching to a streamer I'm
[2:25:05] certainly not preaching to this body
[2:25:09] because we're uh looking this morning
[2:25:11] I'm standing here before a Congregation
[2:25:13] of people that don't even have to be
[2:25:15] asked
[2:25:17] they just feel the burden
[2:25:19] and they see the need
[2:25:21] and the need is met
[2:25:23] and there's more
[2:25:27] along the way there were some who
[2:25:29] streamed the services there was a
[2:25:30] substantial offering that came in
[2:25:33] from a group of people that come in
[2:25:34] fellowship with us here from time to
[2:25:36] time who's watching archive every
[2:25:38] service and a Pastor said I wanted to
[2:25:41] send a leader of the group said I wanted
[2:25:43] to send some money here because you're
[2:25:45] helping to feed the people my people
[2:25:47] you're blessing my people and I want to
[2:25:49] send something to help your need there
[2:25:53] the need just started reaching out and
[2:25:56] God started doing
[2:25:58] that's who he is
[2:26:01] where are the Levites
[2:26:04] who won't just hold our hand
[2:26:08] did Us in the hospital
[2:26:10] but will lay before the Lord to have the
[2:26:12] mind of God
[2:26:14] when they stand in this Pulpit or when
[2:26:17] they minister to you we need them we
[2:26:19] need them we need them
[2:26:20] Ezra said wait a minute we got to have
[2:26:22] the Levites all these other things are
[2:26:24] not enough and so in in Ezra 8 21 and
[2:26:28] we're nearly done
[2:26:30] then I Proclaim to fast there at the
[2:26:33] river of ahava that we might humble
[2:26:35] ourselves before our God to seek him to
[2:26:38] seek from him a straight in a right way
[2:26:40] for us we've got to find the pattern
[2:26:43] something's wrong that the Levites don't
[2:26:45] show up when we when we put out the call
[2:26:47] to go home to Israel somebody's gotten
[2:26:50] too comfortable over here in Babylon
[2:26:53] somebody likes it too good
[2:26:57] somebody's got it to God in slavery in
[2:27:00] bonding because by now they weren't
[2:27:02] living like slaves they were living like
[2:27:04] the elite of the land
[2:27:06] they were living with prosperity
[2:27:10] who'd want to go back to Dusty Old
[2:27:12] Jerusalem all broken down and the walls
[2:27:15] torn down and the house of the Lord
[2:27:17] falling in
[2:27:19] when they've got everything they need
[2:27:21] right here in Babylon
[2:27:23] but then I proclaim the fast there at
[2:27:24] the river Ava that we might humble
[2:27:26] ourselves before our God to seek from
[2:27:28] him a straight in the right way for us
[2:27:30] our little ones
[2:27:35] and all our possessions
[2:27:38] for I was ashamed
[2:27:42] for I was ashamed to request of the king
[2:27:45] a band of soldiers and Horsemen to
[2:27:48] protect us against the enemy along the
[2:27:50] way
[2:27:51] because we had told the king the hand of
[2:27:54] our God is upon all them for good who
[2:27:56] seek him but his power and his wrath are
[2:27:59] against all those who forsake Him
[2:28:02] brother Greely I just had a flashback
[2:28:05] I know we don't have women pastors and
[2:28:08] believe in women preachers but I can't
[2:28:11] help it I had the best granny I had the
[2:28:14] best woman preacher for a granny there
[2:28:16] ever was
[2:28:18] when this message came she heard the
[2:28:20] word and obeyed the word but she served
[2:28:23] God with all she knew until that day
[2:28:25] come and I'm proud of the fact that she
[2:28:28] said yes to what she believed the Lord
[2:28:30] was calling her to do and I'm proud of
[2:28:32] the fact that when he showed her it was
[2:28:34] time to do different she obeyed him
[2:28:36] but all of a sudden I could hear my
[2:28:38] granny preach that message I've heard it
[2:28:41] I could hear her saying
[2:28:43] they were ashamed
[2:28:46] they were embarrassed
[2:28:49] to ask for help from a king
[2:28:53] when they had already told everybody how
[2:28:56] big their God was
[2:28:59] I could just hear I've heard a preset
[2:29:02] multiple times several times through the
[2:29:04] year and it's a truth write the word
[2:29:07] we we we hated to ask the king for
[2:29:10] soldiers to get us get us back when we
[2:29:13] told him that our God was big enough to
[2:29:15] handle everything
[2:29:17] and so
[2:29:19] the hand of our God is upon all them for
[2:29:21] good who seek him but his power and his
[2:29:23] rather against all those who forsake Him
[2:29:26] so what what did we do we fasted
[2:29:29] and besought our God for this and would
[2:29:33] you read the end of that verse
[2:29:37] you reckon he does
[2:29:39] you reckon he hears a people when they
[2:29:41] get serious
[2:29:43] you reckon when a people get serious
[2:29:45] before the Lord and fast and pray and
[2:29:47] call on his name you think maybe he gets
[2:29:49] to moving on their behalf
[2:29:52] the priesthood was needed to handle and
[2:29:54] weigh out the silver and the gold
[2:29:58] and so Ezra looked out among those
[2:30:00] Levites that were now beginning to
[2:30:02] gather in and he chose 12 priests who
[2:30:04] would handle the silver and the gold the
[2:30:06] sacred vessels of God something precious
[2:30:08] and of great value
[2:30:10] in Ezra chapter 8 verse 25-30
[2:30:14] in the Amplified let me read it to you
[2:30:16] and wait out to them the silver the gold
[2:30:18] the vessels the offering for the house
[2:30:20] of our God which the king his counselors
[2:30:22] his Lords and all Israel there had
[2:30:24] presented their present had offered I
[2:30:27] weighed into their hands 650 talents of
[2:30:30] silver silver vessels valued at 100
[2:30:31] talents and a hundred talents of gold
[2:30:33] also 20 basins of gold worth uh one
[2:30:37] thousand darics and two vessels of fine
[2:30:39] bright bronze precious as gold and I
[2:30:41] said to them You Are Holy to the Lord
[2:30:46] he was making Levites
[2:30:50] out of priests
[2:30:53] he was calling ordinary men
[2:30:57] to do an extraordinary work
[2:31:01] he said You Are Holy to the Lord the
[2:31:05] vessels that you carry Are Holy also
[2:31:08] and the silver and the gold are a free
[2:31:10] will offering to the Lord the god of
[2:31:13] your fathers
[2:31:15] guard and keep them until you weigh them
[2:31:19] before the chief preached and Levites
[2:31:21] and heads of the father's houses of
[2:31:23] Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of
[2:31:26] the house of the Lord whatever you do
[2:31:28] priest
[2:31:30] don't you let loose
[2:31:33] don't you turn loose of these precious
[2:31:36] weighty valuable things that I'm
[2:31:39] committing into your hands if thieves
[2:31:41] come you guard this stuff with your life
[2:31:44] and don't you turn loose of it until
[2:31:46] you've made your way all the way back to
[2:31:48] Jerusalem and laid it before the priests
[2:31:51] that are waiting on you there
[2:31:53] don't compromise on the way don't get
[2:31:55] sack on the way
[2:31:58] so the priest and the Levites receive
[2:32:00] the weight of the silver the gold and
[2:32:03] the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem
[2:32:05] into the house of our God where there
[2:32:08] were not enough Levites to do the job he
[2:32:10] chose from among the priests
[2:32:12] and consecrated them to serve as Levites
[2:32:16] now I want to tell you something
[2:32:18] we need that kind of dedication
[2:32:21] we need to understand that God is not
[2:32:24] pleased to dwell in a tent anymore or in
[2:32:26] a in a building that we build with our
[2:32:28] hands anymore he's looking for a house
[2:32:31] to live in he's looking for a people to
[2:32:33] dwell in and he doesn't want to dwell in
[2:32:35] you in portion
[2:32:37] he wants to dwell in you in fullness and
[2:32:40] he wants you and I to make all the room
[2:32:42] possible for him he don't want us to
[2:32:43] give him the back porch
[2:32:46] he wants the back porch and everything
[2:32:48] else he wants all of you can somebody
[2:32:51] say he wants all of me
[2:32:54] he wants all of me
[2:32:56] and so if there's ever been a time
[2:33:01] to consecrate ourselves
[2:33:04] to discover the holy pattern
[2:33:07] that God's word outlines that the
[2:33:09] message of the hour outlines that the
[2:33:12] fivefold ministry that God has given to
[2:33:14] us outlines
[2:33:16] Now's the Time
[2:33:19] as the sun goes down tonight
[2:33:22] we remember
[2:33:25] Jesus
[2:33:26] remembered
[2:33:28] you read John 10.
[2:33:31] you will read this not only the fact
[2:33:33] that he was there but you'll read the
[2:33:36] message that he preached
[2:33:37] he preached in the temple
[2:33:40] he preached in the courts of the temple
[2:33:42] read that
[2:33:43] read it this week
[2:33:46] I want you to think about a time
[2:33:49] when Mighty armies
[2:33:51] were marching against Jerusalem
[2:33:54] and when the Holy Temple that had been
[2:33:56] set up for worship to the one true
[2:33:58] Living God men Greeks
[2:34:02] broken
[2:34:04] tore down the holy furniture
[2:34:07] rip down the holy curtains the holy
[2:34:10] implements
[2:34:12] went before the holy Altar and slayed a
[2:34:15] pig
[2:34:17] and offered the blood of a pig on an
[2:34:20] altar
[2:34:21] dedicated to Yahweh
[2:34:25] now now here's what I want to say now
[2:34:27] I'll do a little more about this Tuesday
[2:34:29] night but here's one what I want to say
[2:34:31] how could I not remember it
[2:34:37] first of all there's no mention of the
[2:34:39] word Christmas anywhere in the Bible and
[2:34:41] there's nothing in the Bible that tells
[2:34:43] us to remember his birth but John the
[2:34:45] gospel of the New Testament tells us
[2:34:47] that Jesus remembered the Feast of
[2:34:49] dedication
[2:34:50] so how can I not remember it do I make
[2:34:53] it a Jewish Christmas of course not
[2:34:55] do I try to make myself a Jew of course
[2:34:58] not although I have Jewish blood
[2:35:01] do I teach others to be judaizers I do
[2:35:04] not that's not what I'm talking about oh
[2:35:05] but how could I not remember it sister
[2:35:07] April
[2:35:08] when I know Jesus remembered it he went
[2:35:11] to the temple specifically at that time
[2:35:13] somebody said is that the only time he
[2:35:15] went to the temple no he went hundreds
[2:35:16] and thousands of times to pray Brother
[2:35:18] David Mann but the Bible didn't talk
[2:35:19] about any of those other times but the
[2:35:21] time that he went to remember the Feast
[2:35:23] of dedication the Bible records it could
[2:35:26] you pull that up for me
[2:35:28] John 10 20.
[2:35:30] John
[2:35:32] 10 22 I thought I had the chapter wrong
[2:35:35] there for a minute
[2:35:37] let's just look at it we'll do a little
[2:35:39] more of this Tuesday night
[2:35:42] it is 1 30 if we were to get out in the
[2:35:44] next 10 minutes we'd be breaking all
[2:35:46] records
[2:35:48] it ain't gonna happen
[2:35:54] somebody said oh no don't let him sit
[2:35:56] down he's good for three and a half
[2:35:58] hours when he sits
[2:36:01] oh Austin come on honey
[2:36:08] there are certain people I love so much
[2:36:10] and I'd rather pick on them
[2:36:13] almost rather than eat pie
[2:36:18] oh sufganio
[2:36:23] you've never lived until you've walked
[2:36:25] the chilly streets of Jerusalem at
[2:36:28] Hanukkah time
[2:36:29] and and
[2:36:31] had real fresh warm sufganiot
[2:36:37] and stood and eat your jelly donut and
[2:36:41] look up on that mountain and know that
[2:36:42] once upon a time
[2:36:44] there said a holy Temple where God met
[2:36:47] with his people
[2:36:49] and where Jesus himself walked and it
[2:36:51] was at Jerusalem the Feast of the
[2:36:54] dedication and it was winter
[2:36:58] we even know the season what does the
[2:37:00] next verse say
[2:37:03] and Jesus walked in the temple in
[2:37:07] Solomon's porch
[2:37:08] I don't have a picture to show you maybe
[2:37:10] I'll get one Tuesday night but I can
[2:37:13] show you the uh the Promenade that that
[2:37:16] went along the southern end of the
[2:37:19] Temple Mount closest to the old fail
[2:37:22] and I'll do you one better if you'll go
[2:37:24] with me I'll take you God willing and
[2:37:26] show you right where it stood
[2:37:29] there's nothing in the world like
[2:37:31] thinking about being right there in the
[2:37:33] spot sister
[2:37:34] Green's daughter Karen brother Green's
[2:37:37] daughter Karen sent me a picture this
[2:37:39] week of brother green and I standing on
[2:37:41] the Temple Mount and it just blessed me
[2:37:43] so much made me think of how privileged
[2:37:46] and blessed I've been to be able to
[2:37:48] stand there
[2:37:49] and here's Jesus
[2:37:51] doesn't say anything about all the other
[2:37:54] times he went
[2:37:56] but it particularly mentions that he was
[2:37:58] here in the winter at the time of the
[2:38:01] Feast of dedication I like to call it
[2:38:03] the Feast of rededication
[2:38:05] because the temple had already been
[2:38:07] dedicated but now it had been desecrated
[2:38:11] by paganism
[2:38:12] by false worship can you imagine going
[2:38:15] into a holy place like that and taking
[2:38:18] uh something that is so offensive to the
[2:38:21] Jews the pig
[2:38:23] that was never given by God for food it
[2:38:26] was given by God to clean up the slop of
[2:38:28] the world
[2:38:30] kind of like the bottom feeding fish
[2:38:34] it shall be nameless
[2:38:38] in gutting it
[2:38:41] and pouring its Blood Out on the holy
[2:38:43] altar where God had commanded that pure
[2:38:46] blood of spotless lambs and spotless
[2:38:48] animals be offered as an offering unto
[2:38:51] God
[2:38:53] kicked over the holy menorahs
[2:38:56] not just one but a whole host of
[2:38:59] menorahs that sat in the Holy place of
[2:39:02] the Temple
[2:39:04] poured out the vials of of oil
[2:39:07] that were used that first pressing of
[2:39:10] olive oil
[2:39:11] the Jews were so determined to offer God
[2:39:15] only the best that when they put the
[2:39:18] least amount of pressure to the olives
[2:39:19] and took the purest clearest greenest
[2:39:23] oil
[2:39:25] that was the only oil that could be used
[2:39:27] in the temple
[2:39:28] God didn't want the dregs
[2:39:31] he wanted the first fruits do you
[2:39:33] understand that concept you treat God
[2:39:36] that way you'll be blessed
[2:39:38] you give God what's his and keep what
[2:39:41] what is left for yourself and you'll be
[2:39:44] blessed he'll multiply it back to you
[2:39:46] time and time again
[2:39:47] kicked over the holy menorahs
[2:39:50] put the swine's blood on the
[2:39:53] forbade any observance of Sabbath
[2:39:59] the dreidel that the little children
[2:40:01] play with is something that they
[2:40:03] invented to distract the soldiers
[2:40:07] because they were forbidden to light the
[2:40:10] Sabbath candles and they were forbidden
[2:40:12] to make any separation between the holy
[2:40:15] and the profane and any observance of we
[2:40:19] say Judaism but it was it was Bible
[2:40:24] they were just doing what the Bible told
[2:40:26] them to do remembering pesach and
[2:40:28] celebrating Sukkot right it was Bible we
[2:40:32] made it Jewish
[2:40:34] the Bible made it Bible
[2:40:37] and they were forbidden to do all those
[2:40:38] things under this heavy occupation of
[2:40:41] both Greek and Roman influence
[2:40:43] and a little family that lived out in
[2:40:46] moda in I have to say it carefully
[2:40:48] because sometimes I have said mohedin
[2:40:51] moed is a holy appointment
[2:40:54] a dress rehearsal a feast of the Lord
[2:40:56] but the town is called modain just
[2:41:00] outside of Jerusalem do you remember
[2:41:02] where it is brother Greeley
[2:41:04] it's on the it's well we call it the
[2:41:06] Moda in Road
[2:41:08] it's just past what is the Palestinian
[2:41:11] town where there was always so much
[2:41:13] trouble going on there and Ramallah
[2:41:16] it's just past Ramallah on the road to
[2:41:19] the airport and load
[2:41:21] and it's that little bitty heel area out
[2:41:24] there and I've been to the graves of The
[2:41:25] Maccabees it's a special place and I
[2:41:27] took my children the last time we were
[2:41:29] there we went to a Biblical park there
[2:41:31] showed them some olive presses and
[2:41:33] things that survived from the time of
[2:41:35] The Maccabees and and hear a little man
[2:41:38] and his boys raised up and said we've
[2:41:40] had enough
[2:41:44] these Syrian armies Etc had marched in
[2:41:47] there with elephants
[2:41:50] can you imagine
[2:41:53] facing off with a few
[2:41:55] zealots of Israel and thinking that you
[2:41:59] had to bring elephants to help you win
[2:42:00] the battle
[2:42:02] talk about intimidation methods
[2:42:06] and they marched in with all these
[2:42:08] weaponries that only one family and a
[2:42:10] few who would follow
[2:42:12] said we may die right here
[2:42:16] with Jerusalem in sight
[2:42:20] but we will not lay down
[2:42:23] and watch you continue to defy the
[2:42:26] Living God of Israel
[2:42:29] and God as he has done so many times for
[2:42:32] his Chosen People Israel
[2:42:35] he miraculously gave them victory
[2:42:38] took some years to come
[2:42:40] a lot of battles a lot of loss of lives
[2:42:43] The Maccabees didn't win the battle and
[2:42:45] it'd all be over with
[2:42:47] but there came a Time
[2:42:49] that it was over
[2:42:51] and somebody said now we've got to go
[2:42:53] back to the temple and we've got to
[2:42:54] scrub off the swine's blood
[2:42:59] the human feces history tells us that
[2:43:02] they had used it for for a latrine
[2:43:05] somebody's got to grab the shovels and
[2:43:07] who and shovel out the poop
[2:43:12] somebody's got to turn up
[2:43:14] right side the holy menorahs and
[2:43:17] polish them off and clean them up
[2:43:21] somebody's got to come up with some oil
[2:43:23] because we've got to light the holy
[2:43:25] Menorah in the in the in the presence of
[2:43:29] God and we've got to clean the Altar and
[2:43:30] we've got to see the curtains back up
[2:43:32] and we what a work they set out to do
[2:43:35] and God honored them and blessed them
[2:43:38] and that's where the tradition comes
[2:43:40] many historians say that there's no
[2:43:42] written record in history it became a it
[2:43:45] became Something Told by mouth to ear
[2:43:48] Legend a myth perhaps
[2:43:52] but I like to mention it anyway because
[2:43:54] to me
[2:43:56] it may not have happened exactly like
[2:43:58] this but it sounds just like God to me
[2:44:02] The Story Goes they found one little pot
[2:44:04] of holy oil
[2:44:06] in the midst of all the rubble
[2:44:09] not even enough to hardly light one
[2:44:11] Menorah for one night
[2:44:15] all the rest of the menorah sat without
[2:44:17] oil
[2:44:18] it would be it would be some time
[2:44:21] before there could be enough oil to be
[2:44:24] used to light all the menorahs because
[2:44:26] it had to go back through this whole
[2:44:28] process of first first pressing and then
[2:44:32] it had to be Sanctified and prayed over
[2:44:33] and blessed by the priest
[2:44:36] so it would have been days before they
[2:44:38] could have had enough oil to do it but
[2:44:40] The Story Goes they took the little pot
[2:44:42] of oil that they had and they lit the
[2:44:43] holy Menorah and instead of it lighting
[2:44:46] for one night not even enough oil to get
[2:44:49] it lit for one night all the way through
[2:44:51] but instead the legend Goes The Story
[2:44:54] Goes we should say it burnt for eight
[2:44:57] solid nights
[2:45:00] I wasn't there I don't know if it
[2:45:02] happened that way but again sounds just
[2:45:05] like something my God would do
[2:45:08] take a little bit of oil
[2:45:12] musicians are coming
[2:45:14] take a little bit of oil
[2:45:17] sounds just like what he did in Elijah's
[2:45:20] day
[2:45:22] little witty woman who had just enough
[2:45:24] oil and just enough meal
[2:45:29] you know I like how the Jews tell the
[2:45:31] story
[2:45:32] they don't believe from the original
[2:45:34] language that the that the that the meal
[2:45:37] Barrel filled all the way to the top and
[2:45:39] the oil
[2:45:40] failed all the way to the top they
[2:45:42] believed that the original language
[2:45:44] indicates that each time she went there
[2:45:46] was just enough
[2:45:50] doesn't that sound like God
[2:45:54] just enough God's people have rarely
[2:45:57] been the wealthy majority
[2:46:00] but they've always had
[2:46:03] just enough
[2:46:05] the little Mama went back and she said I
[2:46:07] know there won't be none I emptied it
[2:46:09] out the last time
[2:46:11] she opens a lid oh
[2:46:15] just enough
[2:46:17] just enough
[2:46:19] so whether it happened that way or not I
[2:46:21] don't know but I'll tell you what Jesus
[2:46:25] Vindicated validated and confirmed the
[2:46:30] thought
[2:46:32] of the Holy Temple
[2:46:34] being rededicated reconsecrated
[2:46:38] God's not looking for a tent Chad
[2:46:42] he's not even looking for a church
[2:46:44] building
[2:46:46] he's looking for you and I
[2:46:49] to be his Temple come Lord
[2:46:58] I I've let I've let some things
[2:47:02] turn over in my life
[2:47:05] I've neglected some things like brother
[2:47:08] Greeley was talking about natural
[2:47:11] I've neglected some things spiritual
[2:47:14] I've let some furniture fall over
[2:47:18] let some pots burst in the cold and
[2:47:23] let my garden get Full Of Weeds again
[2:47:25] and
[2:47:27] now is a perfect season and a Time
[2:47:31] to weed my garden it actually is
[2:47:37] to get my Menorah turned right side up
[2:47:40] again
[2:47:41] to re-light my lamp
[2:47:44] to reconsecrate my altar
[2:47:47] oh Lord
[2:47:49] I find that selfishness
[2:47:52] has crept in and
[2:47:56] my love for people is more shallow than
[2:47:58] it has been at certain times in my life
[2:48:02] and my patience is most definitely
[2:48:04] thinner than it's ever been
[2:48:09] and Lord I want you to clean me
[2:48:14] actually I don't
[2:48:16] I actually want you to help me clean my
[2:48:19] own house
