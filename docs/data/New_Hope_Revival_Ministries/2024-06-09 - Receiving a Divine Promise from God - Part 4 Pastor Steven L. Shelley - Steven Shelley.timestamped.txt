[55:49] musicians thank
[55:54] you God is good
[55:57] amen if you need to go to the washroom
[56:00] go now so that you don't have to come in
[56:02] and out so much during the preaching of
[56:05] the word unless you have a little baby
[56:07] and you have to see to those needs but
[56:10] there's a lot of movement that takes
[56:12] place even in the worship service today
[56:14] so much movement and it seems so many
[56:17] just walking around in the vestibule
[56:19] don't don't do that if you can help it
[56:22] come back in here especially carrying on
[56:24] conversations out there that that's very
[56:26] distracting to those of us who are
[56:28] trying to build a service in here it
[56:31] takes every one of us
[56:34] concentrating pulling together in faith
[56:38] for the Lord to move among us the way
[56:40] that he wants to move because we have so
[56:43] many distractions in life is that right
[56:47] I I'm I'm not getting on to you I'm just
[56:49] doing my
[56:50] job and I'm doing it in a good spirit so
[56:54] far and so I just want to ask you to be
[56:59] mindful you may not be on the platform
[57:01] but your responsibility is huge because
[57:05] we're coming together to be in one mind
[57:08] and one Accord and you don't want
[57:11] anything to you don't even want your
[57:13] child to hinder you if you can possibly
[57:15] help it but we understand that you have
[57:17] to you have to meet those needs but
[57:20] thank God we have uh we have the archive
[57:24] and you can go back and hear a section
[57:26] perhaps that you missed but we we want
[57:28] to see what God will say today the um
[57:33] the the text started coming in fever
[57:35] fever sick fever and uh the there was a
[57:39] voice I'm not going to say where it come
[57:41] from but there was a voice that said you
[57:44] really want to keep preaching this theme
[57:46] because it seems like that uh if you're
[57:49] preaching this then the people are
[57:51] really tested well okay that's all right
[57:54] the word is still the word
[57:57] and he is still the Healer and he is
[58:00] still able to do exceedingly abundantly
[58:03] above that which we could even ask or
[58:05] think we thank God for every streamer
[58:08] today may the Lord bless you I glance
[58:11] just a moment ago and and you are
[58:14] joining us from all over the world and

[59:19] Ohio River he was baptizing the 17th
[59:22] person when a light came down on the
[59:25] river and spoke a commission over his

[1:00:02] observations of that time but if you're
[1:00:05] in Jerusalem that's when you're going to
[1:00:06] celebrate it you're going to celebrate
[1:00:08] it on those two days and uh I've been
[1:00:11] blessed to be in Jerusalem on those days
[1:00:13] and celebrate first the giving of the
[1:00:16] law and second the giving of the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost um and then on Saturday uh one

[1:00:36] going to be six really you're five now
[1:00:39] let's say happy birthday to
[1:00:42] Nora
[1:00:44] six I knew you weren't 11 I knew that I
[1:00:48] was kidding you're supposed to smile and
[1:00:51] laugh a little
[1:00:52] bit would you remember the families of
[1:00:55] two very well-known ministers around
[1:00:58] this message who went home to be with
[1:01:00] the Lord this week one was uh Reverend
[1:01:03] Ewald Frank from cyfield Germany 90
[1:01:07] years old still preaching and um and um
[1:01:13] well God knows he knows I'm so thankful
[1:01:18] that there is deliverance and uh there
[1:01:20] is redemption under the blood amen and
[1:01:24] we pray for his family as especially his
[1:01:26] son Bernard and and their family we've
[1:01:30] had great fellowship with him we ask the
[1:01:32] Lord to be with them and then uh Pastor
[1:01:36] Leonard barudi passed away you may not
[1:01:38] know that name but he is very well known
[1:01:41] he's from the Congo in Africa French
[1:01:44] Africa and um he has had the blessing of
[1:01:48] pastoring the largest church in this
[1:01:50] message for many years now he was the
[1:01:53] father of bringing the message ACR
[1:01:55] Across the Nation of the Congo there are
[1:01:57] more Believers of this message in Congo
[1:02:00] than any nation of the world and on a
[1:02:03] conservative Sunday he has 20,000 people
[1:02:07] in his
[1:02:08] congregation and when they have
[1:02:10] Fellowship meetings together they have
[1:02:13] 55,000 people gathered together in the
[1:02:16] Congo and uh now because of they're
[1:02:19] being so many who believe and follow
[1:02:21] this truth there are members of the
[1:02:24] government all the way up to to the to
[1:02:26] the Palace who who believed this truth
[1:02:30] and uh so the impact of his going home
[1:02:33] is going to be great for many people and
[1:02:36] we want to remember uh he was in Canada
[1:02:39] when he passed away and it was a very
[1:02:42] difficult process you can imagine to get
[1:02:44] him home and and his church is very very
[1:02:47] grieved today unexpected really and so
[1:02:50] we want to pray that God will Comfort
[1:02:52] them Mark 11 let's read these two verses
[1:02:56] again before we take our
[1:02:58] seats uh for this service God is good
[1:03:03] he's good all the time he never
[1:03:06] fails he's always right on time never
[1:03:09] misses an appointment if he said it you
[1:03:12] can believe
[1:03:14] it for verily I say unto you that
[1:03:18] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:03:21] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:03:24] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:03:27] but shall believe that those things
[1:03:31] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:03:34] shall have
[1:03:36] whatsoever he saith now that is just you
[1:03:40] know uh no mistranslation there that is
[1:03:43] what it says and uh that's in red and it
[1:03:47] means uh it was spoken by our Lord our
[1:03:50] Messiah Our Savior I believe every word
[1:03:53] of it and uh if you got the little text
[1:03:56] on Friday you you heard us referring
[1:03:58] back to something brother brandom said
[1:04:00] he said we expect things to happen
[1:04:02] instantly he said doesn't always happen
[1:04:05] instantly but he said don't you say it
[1:04:07] didn't happen because he said if just
[1:04:10] one little grain of sand turned loose
[1:04:13] roll down the other side then you know
[1:04:15] The God Who loosed that one grain of
[1:04:18] sand to move that mountain is able to
[1:04:20] move the rest of it and and really
[1:04:23] that's kind of like we were talking
[1:04:24] about the tingle in the finger one
[1:04:27] little sign of promise and if you see no
[1:04:31] sign if you see no improvement you still
[1:04:35] praise God and and really if we follow
[1:04:39] this truth and the scripture we don't
[1:04:41] even ask
[1:04:42] again we come back to praise the next
[1:04:45] time Lord I Thank you that I'm Healed I
[1:04:48] thank you that it's done do you follow
[1:04:50] me let's go a little further in this
[1:04:53] lesson and I wouldn't really call these
[1:04:55] sermons this is a uh this is a study in
[1:04:58] God's word and in the message concerning
[1:05:01] some powerful truths you can have what
[1:05:04] you say I believe it I believe there is
[1:05:07] uh power and authority in our mouth on
[1:05:11] uh on Tuesday night we talked about
[1:05:14] nevertheless at Thy word I'm going to
[1:05:16] take you at your word I've already tried
[1:05:19] fishing didn't catch anything I'm ready
[1:05:21] to go to the house but if you say to
[1:05:23] stay and go out a little bit deeper
[1:05:25] that's exactly what I'll do would you
[1:05:27] say it was worth Peter's time I believe
[1:05:30] it was I want you to go to Revelation 12
[1:05:33] and verse 11 just one verse and uh this
[1:05:37] will be the next section of this study
[1:05:39] Revelation 1211 and they
[1:05:43] overcame
[1:05:45] overcame done it's done now in this in
[1:05:48] this context and they overcame him
[1:05:51] that's Antichrist Spirit by the blood of
[1:05:55] the
[1:05:56] lamb and by the word of
[1:06:00] their
[1:06:01] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:06:06] unto the death for some in in Great
[1:06:11] Tribulation in for some that will mean
[1:06:14] physical death but for others it is a
[1:06:18] spiritual death we die to flesh and our
[1:06:22] own will and ambition but that doesn't
[1:06:26] mean that there won't be those who give
[1:06:28] their natural life they absolutely will
[1:06:31] and if you think it can only happen in
[1:06:33] Great Tribulation uh the time the ending
[1:06:36] of the time of Jacob's trouble you're
[1:06:38] you're wrong it can happen now we're
[1:06:40] living in a wild wild
[1:06:43] society and so may God add his Blessing
[1:06:46] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:06:48] seated they overcame him there's
[1:06:51] something about the blood and the word
[1:06:54] that comes out of your mouth when your
[1:06:58] word what you say what you testify what
[1:07:02] you witness to If It lines up with the
[1:07:05] finished work of the cross that was
[1:07:08] purchased for us by the blood that
[1:07:11] finished work is a transaction of Grace
[1:07:15] that took place with a token price and
[1:07:18] that token price was the blood had to be
[1:07:22] blood somebody say it had to be blood
[1:07:25] and there there is an overcoming portion
[1:07:27] there's an overcoming anointing there's
[1:07:30] an overcoming power a quickening unction
[1:07:33] for those who will keep their testimony
[1:07:37] on the
[1:07:38] word remember he said don't ever have a
[1:07:40] negative one you got to keep a positive
[1:07:43] one what comes out of your mouth matters
[1:07:46] the whole scripture tells us that we we
[1:07:49] are to uh we are to speak truth and and
[1:07:53] uh we have to be careful because the
[1:07:55] enemy wants us to be uh thermometers and
[1:07:59] we don't need somebody to tell us how
[1:08:01] bad it is or what the temperature is we
[1:08:04] need a thermostat we need somebody who
[1:08:07] can affect the atmosphere with their
[1:08:09] words and with their faith is that right
[1:08:13] all right let's go on in the message uh
[1:08:16] the angel of God Toledo Ohio I like this
[1:08:20] one he said and friends if I had time I
[1:08:23] could talk from here till week after
[1:08:25] week and never tell you a third of what
[1:08:28] I've seen him do of the Great and Mighty
[1:08:32] things now that's a lot of things that
[1:08:34] brother brandom experienced and at
[1:08:36] nighttime I just wonder which what to
[1:08:39] say that he'd want me to tell you of
[1:08:42] some of the things he's done just as a
[1:08:45] testimony and he said I believe we
[1:08:49] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[1:08:53] the testimony is that right he's the
[1:08:58] Prest he's the high priest of Our
[1:09:02] Testimony we finished out on Tuesday
[1:09:05] night talking about the fact that he is
[1:09:07] the high priest of our confession which
[1:09:10] is the same as testimony what comes out
[1:09:13] of our mouth if you could just go back
[1:09:16] with me to we have found him come and
[1:09:19] see and I want to go down to just
[1:09:21] paragraph 23 for those of you that
[1:09:23] weren't here on Tuesday night and won't
[1:09:25] check the archive I don't want to do the
[1:09:27] there you go that was quick thank you
[1:09:29] but when you believe you have you say
[1:09:34] yes I am then you believe you're a
[1:09:37] Christian you can't show nothing that
[1:09:39] you are but you believe you are you
[1:09:42] believe you are and when and then when
[1:09:45] you confess that you are and when you
[1:09:48] confess him and he confesses you he's a
[1:09:53] high priest working on what not on your
[1:09:57] crying not on your repenting not even on
[1:10:01] your faith he's working he is working
[1:10:04] off of he is interceding based on
[1:10:09] your your
[1:10:11] confession no matter how much Faith you
[1:10:14] got it'll never do you any good this is
[1:10:17] powerful till you do what you put works
[1:10:22] with it you put words with it for faith
[1:10:26] without works is dead is that right now
[1:10:29] look at 24 this is I believe this with
[1:10:32] everything that I am he can only do as
[1:10:36] you
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] say we limit God a limitless God and yet
[1:10:43] we limit him in his capacity to impact
[1:10:47] our individual lives and how do we do
[1:10:50] that with what we say and quite often
[1:10:53] what we say is based on on the level of
[1:10:55] our faith but there's sometimes when our
[1:10:58] faith is low we can get somewhere by
[1:11:02] confessing something
[1:11:04] stronger than what we're
[1:11:06] feeling even when you feel that your
[1:11:09] faith is weary you're tired of waiting
[1:11:12] you're worn out instead of confessing
[1:11:14] I'm weary I'm tired of waiting I'm worn
[1:11:17] out you can confess it's already done
[1:11:20] the work is done the price is paid and
[1:11:23] when you do that church he promised to
[1:11:27] be a high priest of what we confess of
[1:11:30] what we testify we have overcoming power
[1:11:34] that's Anchored In The Blood and the
[1:11:36] word of our witness the word of Our
[1:11:40] Testimony and he's there before the
[1:11:42] presence of the Majesty to make good
[1:11:44] anything that his Redemptive blessings
[1:11:47] call for his sacrifice that's what he
[1:11:51] paid for and standing there to make good
[1:11:54] to you
[1:11:55] anything that you say isn't that what we
[1:11:58] just read somebody said I'm not sure
[1:12:00] about that isn't that what we just read
[1:12:02] that what Jesus said absolutely whatever
[1:12:06] you say you can have what you say if you
[1:12:09] speak it without
[1:12:10] doubt now that that's that's where the I
[1:12:13] mean that's where we that's where we get
[1:12:15] bottlenecked that's where we come to a
[1:12:17] screeching halt but we've got to we've
[1:12:21] got to practice speaking Faith according
[1:12:24] to the word I'm I'm going to wait for
[1:12:25] your amen faith in action is the next
[1:12:29] message that we wanted to look at in
[1:12:31] this study paragraph 64 when that great
[1:12:34] redeemed host stands around the Throne
[1:12:37] of God waving The Palms in their hands
[1:12:41] and the white robes washed in the blood
[1:12:44] of the Lamb will tell the story how
[1:12:48] we've overcome how did we overcome by
[1:12:51] the blood of the lamb and there
[1:12:55] testimony what they speak Hallelujah he
[1:12:59] said well what is their testimony there
[1:13:02] it is Jesus there's your testimony
[1:13:06] there's your testimony he lives Messiah
[1:13:10] lives Jesus is Alive he hasn't lost his
[1:13:14] power he's still able to heal the sick
[1:13:17] and raise the Dead He's Alive this time
[1:13:20] in his church he's not in a one man body
[1:13:24] anymore he came because of shavat he
[1:13:27] came there they were gathered together
[1:13:30] in the upper room they had some business
[1:13:32] to take care of his promise that promise
[1:13:36] that he made I will not leave you
[1:13:38] comfortless I will come to you you shall
[1:13:41] be in what's the word indued you shall
[1:13:46] be indued you shall be infused with
[1:13:50] power from on high and that wasn't a
[1:13:54] third person in
[1:13:55] Trinity you need to know that there's no
[1:13:59] such thing that's the very same spirit
[1:14:03] that overshadowed Mary and she conceived
[1:14:07] as a virgin that's the very same spirit
[1:14:10] that spoke and created everything that
[1:14:13] we know in creation Same Spirit and this
[1:14:17] time it fell on a body of Believers I'm
[1:14:21] so thankful to be a a a benefit
[1:14:25] officiary of the outpouring of the Holy
[1:14:28] Spirit he said oh let it ring out
[1:14:31] through the mountains to the hills send
[1:14:33] the message far and wide what's our
[1:14:36] testimony Jesus Lives he's not dead but
[1:14:41] he's alive I'm so happy to stand here in
[1:14:44] one of the major cities of the world
[1:14:46] Chicago and claim that Jesus Christ
[1:14:49] raised from the dead and by his grace
[1:14:54] listen we can prove it to you how can we
[1:14:58] do that because we're a Mark 16 group of
[1:15:01] Believers there's a New Testament Church
[1:15:04] rising up and all that means is
[1:15:06] fulfilling Jesus commission they shall
[1:15:10] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:15:12] recover they shall cast out devils and
[1:15:16] if they drink any deadly thing or take
[1:15:18] up serpents they'll not be harmed that's
[1:15:21] what the word said and that needs to be
[1:15:25] Our Testimony how is that possible
[1:15:27] because he's the same because he's alive
[1:15:30] because he's not dead because he now
[1:15:33] lives in a corporate body of Believers
[1:15:36] filled with the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:15:39] even have the completion of the new
[1:15:40] birth without the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost you need him not it you need him
[1:15:48] in your life especially in this hour
[1:15:52] especially in times like this he said
[1:15:54] I'm so happy all right and and by his
[1:15:57] grace can prove it to you amen he said
[1:16:01] then let your sin cease what is sin
[1:16:05] unbelief take the idols from your hearts
[1:16:08] and Believe on the Living God and accept
[1:16:13] the blessings that he died for praise
[1:16:15] God how many of you want to accept the
[1:16:18] blessings that he paid for they're mine
[1:16:21] they got my name on them they've got
[1:16:23] your name on them
[1:16:26] except the blessings that he died for
[1:16:28] and here's really powerful phrase and
[1:16:32] appropriated for you he found a way to
[1:16:36] get the life of the word inside of you
[1:16:40] he did it by the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:42] Ghost he didn't want you just to trust
[1:16:44] in a book knowledge just that printed
[1:16:47] page of the word a lot of people get
[1:16:50] very hung up on the printed page but I
[1:16:52] want you to know that's only a written
[1:16:55] record of a living
[1:16:57] word the word became flesh the word
[1:17:01] didn't become a book the word became
[1:17:04] flesh in our Messiah and he is all God
[1:17:09] you can say that all God the Bible tells
[1:17:13] us that in him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:17:19] godhead bodily so if there was a voice
[1:17:23] it was from the God that was within him
[1:17:25] if there was a dove it visited from the
[1:17:28] God that was within him there may be
[1:17:30] other physical signs and manifestations
[1:17:33] but here o Israel the Lord thy
[1:17:37] God not
[1:17:39] three he's
[1:17:41] one now he goes on to say take those
[1:17:44] Idols from your heart believe on the
[1:17:46] Living God same quote and accept the
[1:17:48] blessings that he died for and
[1:17:50] appropriated for you and here is the
[1:17:53] phrase that I want you to grab a hold of
[1:17:56] put your
[1:17:58] faith put your faith into action how do
[1:18:03] we do that by believing and by
[1:18:06] testifying that we believe I believe
[1:18:09] well who am I talking to anybody that'll
[1:18:11] listen sometimes I'm talking to my
[1:18:16] symptoms lying vanities he told us they
[1:18:19] are you know sometimes we pray against
[1:18:22] the symptoms and the symptoms aren't the
[1:18:24] problem
[1:18:25] there's a root in there we want to just
[1:18:28] not only speak to the symptoms but we
[1:18:30] want to speak to the root of it and we
[1:18:33] command you I command you to die in the
[1:18:36] authority of Jesus Christ
[1:18:39] cancer remember what he said if if you
[1:18:42] can get the people to believe you
[1:18:44] nothing will stand before you not even
[1:18:46] cancer well you might say that's because
[1:18:49] he was a prophet but I will say it's
[1:18:52] because he was a representation of the
[1:18:54] Living World
[1:18:55] word cancer couldn't stand before him
[1:18:58] not because of his prophetic office but
[1:19:01] because he
[1:19:02] represented the Living Word the same
[1:19:06] Christ and so therefore it's not your
[1:19:09] office that's going to shake the devil
[1:19:12] it's the Living Word it's the living
[1:19:14] Christ inside of you that's going to
[1:19:17] move the enemy and he will move he how
[1:19:20] do you know cuz he has he does and he
[1:19:24] will
[1:19:25] you can speak to symptoms you can speak
[1:19:27] to your neighbor you can speak to your
[1:19:29] wife you can speak to your children I
[1:19:31] know I'm whole I know I'm
[1:19:35] Healed and he's able he said if we would
[1:19:38] make the right confession that's not a
[1:19:41] thought a confession may start with a
[1:19:44] thought but a confession is something
[1:19:46] that comes out of your mouth with some
[1:19:48] vocal cords some tongue action amen he
[1:19:53] said he was able to make your your body
[1:19:57] yes your body all the bones and the
[1:20:01] muscles and the blood vessels and the
[1:20:04] capillaries all the all the systems and
[1:20:07] organs of your body that make up this
[1:20:10] flesh body that you live in he said he
[1:20:13] is able to make your body obey
[1:20:19] conf your body it's part of creation and
[1:20:23] therefore it has to submit itself to the
[1:20:26] authority of the
[1:20:27] Creator is that right now what if you're
[1:20:31] confessing I'm
[1:20:32] dying what if he makes your body obey
[1:20:35] your
[1:20:39] confession what if you're confessing
[1:20:41] this is killing
[1:20:42] me my toe is killing me is it is that
[1:20:47] the message you want him to Bear Before
[1:20:49] the Throne as the great high priest of
[1:20:51] your confession that your toes killing
[1:20:54] you
[1:20:55] you're looking at me
[1:20:57] funny the Bible said we're snared not by
[1:21:00] what we think we're snared by the words
[1:21:03] of our mouth you can think the wrong
[1:21:05] thing and pull it down before it ever
[1:21:08] becomes words but once it comes out of
[1:21:11] your
[1:21:12] mouth there's an
[1:21:15] obligation to that word that comes out
[1:21:18] of your mouth
[1:21:20] hallelujah hallelujah you're not
[1:21:23] starving to death
[1:21:25] you're
[1:21:28] hungry Speak
[1:21:31] Life it makes a difference somebody say
[1:21:33] I don't think that really matter what
[1:21:34] you
[1:21:36] said it it does matter most of us have
[1:21:40] tested it and proven it to be true and
[1:21:43] we're putting our faith in in action
[1:21:47] that message is faith in action 55 you
[1:21:50] should hear it in the great warrior this
[1:21:53] great warrior Joshua he goes on now now
[1:21:56] why didn't he go over there and clean
[1:21:58] out all the Philistines and so forth God
[1:22:02] and I'd say come on you got something to
[1:22:04] do too God just don't poke things down
[1:22:08] your
[1:22:10] neck you've got
[1:22:12] to believe it here is where we really
[1:22:16] don't like it we like those ripe
[1:22:19] cherries falling on us from a tree we
[1:22:22] really don't want to work for what we
[1:22:24] get
[1:22:25] it but he said you've got to do some
[1:22:28] fighting you've got to push down some
[1:22:31] thoughts come on it's like I told you
[1:22:34] about a a diagnosis last week this
[1:22:37] certain kind of of there we have white
[1:22:40] blood cells that fight disease and
[1:22:42] infection and inflammation in our body
[1:22:44] and and we thank God for them we really
[1:22:47] do because when we speak our a word of
[1:22:50] faith if you read that quote something
[1:22:52] happens in the cells of our body when we
[1:22:54] speak the truth it responds to the sound
[1:22:57] of our voice that's what the word tells
[1:22:59] us it teaches us that but you get this
[1:23:02] diagnosis I because your your certain
[1:23:05] kind of white blood cells are elevated
[1:23:07] so I go look it up and and it says you
[1:23:09] know you if if this is the case you you
[1:23:12] you need treatment you need further
[1:23:14] evaluation but keep in mind that it can
[1:23:17] be anything from a seasonal allergy to
[1:23:22] cancer I want to one more time time
[1:23:24] point out the big
[1:23:26] gap between a snotty
[1:23:29] nose and something eating you from the
[1:23:31] inside out so you can't just Google your
[1:23:37] symptoms and know your
[1:23:39] condition come on you got to be careful
[1:23:43] what you
[1:23:44] read well I got a little blood I see
[1:23:47] blood I have blood well I want you to
[1:23:49] know that's something to pray about for
[1:23:50] sure but you can't just go to Google
[1:23:55] cuz it'll have you ready to you you know
[1:23:57] uh a little message might pop up and say
[1:24:00] you need to make your final
[1:24:02] Arrangements you know a funeral home
[1:24:05] might advertise right on the Google
[1:24:07] thing and tell you you know whatever you
[1:24:09] do do quickly go ahead and make your
[1:24:11] plans listen folks we don't have to
[1:24:14] listen to something like that we've got
[1:24:16] Authority God's not going to poke it
[1:24:18] down our neck he's not going to force us
[1:24:20] to believe anything we got to do some
[1:24:23] fighting yes fighting doubt hello
[1:24:26] fighting
[1:24:27] lies it goes on it goes on I'm getting a
[1:24:31] little help as Peter
[1:24:34] cartright said to the drunkard that day
[1:24:36] many of you has read this told him said
[1:24:39] what are you going to do here said I'm
[1:24:41] going to hold a meeting said who told
[1:24:44] you the Lord said you'd got to whip me

[1:24:50] Rouser what are you doing here to the
[1:24:53] preacher Peter cartright surely you've
[1:24:54] heard of the name and said what are you
[1:24:57] doing here I'm going to hold a meeting
[1:24:59] who told you the Lord and the old man
[1:25:01] was foolish enough to say well you going
[1:25:03] to have to whip me first Peter cartright
[1:25:06] said well if that's my next
[1:25:13] job you can smile you can laugh glad you

[1:25:19] next all right undone his
[1:25:23] coat beat him

[1:25:29] beat him up got on top of him and and
[1:25:31] got beat him in the
[1:25:37] face some of you like that too
[1:25:39] much said I must oh I like this listen
[1:25:43] what he said this is his famous quote he
[1:25:45] said I must fight if I should
[1:25:49] reain increase my courage Lord he beat
[1:25:53] the guy up said you got enough he said
[1:25:56] to the guy you got

[1:26:07] saved anybody with
[1:26:10] me oh I like it if I I must fight if I
[1:26:14] should
[1:26:15] Reign we we are excuse
[1:26:20] makers we make so many excuses for
[1:26:25] ourselves the Bible said Thou Art
[1:26:28] inexcusable oh man no excuse is going to
[1:26:32] suffice you've got all the power that
[1:26:34] you need and all the authority that you
[1:26:38] need by this Living Word if you'll just
[1:26:41] take God at his word and do something
[1:26:44] about it he said that's just what we
[1:26:47] need you you got to do some fighting not
[1:26:49] with your fist let me say that again not
[1:26:53] with your fist
[1:26:55] unless necessary for Peter cartright it
[1:26:58] was necessary for brother sheffy it was
[1:27:01] sometimes
[1:27:04] necessary whatever's needed but this is
[1:27:08] not the kind of fighting we're
[1:27:09] encouraging you to do because really
[1:27:11] it's not your fellow that's your enemy
[1:27:13] your enemy is what's going on in your
[1:27:15] own body in your own life it's a man in
[1:27:18] the
[1:27:20] mirror the Henson wrote an unbeli I
[1:27:22] think it was the Henson Goodman sung it
[1:27:24] I think the hens wrote it an
[1:27:26] unbelievable song many years ago that
[1:27:29] said I saw the man that crucified the
[1:27:33] Lord and the verse says I happened by
[1:27:35] chance to to face an old Looking Glass a
[1:27:39] mirror and there he was staring back at
[1:27:42] me I saw the man that crucified the Lord
[1:27:46] our our worst enemy sometime little
[1:27:50] sister Wright Evelyn Wright from our
[1:27:54] church in Columbus she was there from
[1:27:57] the start she sang in a trio with my
[1:28:00] grandmother she worked at Crystal until
[1:28:02] she retired her whole life that's what
[1:28:05] she did she she was a woman who
[1:28:09] struggled sometime to keep the right
[1:28:10] attitude but a precious lady she had
[1:28:13] been grossly mistreated in life she
[1:28:16] would stand up to testify she would say
[1:28:18] I want to thank the Lord for saving me
[1:28:22] sanctifying me and filling in me with
[1:28:24] the Holy Ghost he's never done me any
[1:28:27] way but right he's never been the
[1:28:30] problem my problem has always been this
[1:28:34] woman living between these two
[1:28:37] elbows she's the one I have to struggle
[1:28:40] with I dare say that you and I struggle
[1:28:44] the most with the one who lives between
[1:28:46] our own
[1:28:47] elbows God's not the problem even faith
[1:28:51] is not the problem sometimes it's what
[1:28:53] we say
[1:28:55] he that becomes the problem you got to
[1:28:58] go do some fighting not with your fist
[1:29:00] but with the power of God with your
[1:29:03] testimony that's how you overcome by the
[1:29:06] blood of the
[1:29:07] lamb and by your
[1:29:10] testimony with your testimony thank God
[1:29:13] for it that tell the devil tell the
[1:29:16] devil here's somebody else you can talk
[1:29:19] to somebody said brother Shelly you were
[1:29:22] praying talking to God and all of a you
[1:29:24] started talking to the devil so they
[1:29:26] know who's
[1:29:30] who neither one of them are
[1:29:33] confused I promise you when I'm talking
[1:29:35] to the Lord he knows I'm talking to him
[1:29:38] and then when I start rebuking the devil
[1:29:40] in the middle of my prayer the devil
[1:29:41] knows I'm not talking to the Lord the
[1:29:43] Lord knows I'm not talking to him the
[1:29:44] devil knows I'm talking to him it's all
[1:29:47] right to talk to him sometime get Jesus
[1:29:50] did Jesus did get thee
[1:29:54] behind me Satan somebody said well that
[1:29:58] was cause Jesus was God that's not what
[1:30:00] brother brandom told us he said by
[1:30:02] inspiration he didn't use those Powers
[1:30:05] against the devil that day he didn't use
[1:30:07] the authority of who he was he wasn't
[1:30:10] using any of that messiahship he used
[1:30:13] the only thing that ever defeats the
[1:30:16] enemy he said it is
[1:30:20] written the word of God will defeat thee
[1:30:24] enemy tell the Devil he's got no strings
[1:30:26] tied to you you put this disease on me
[1:30:30] but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he
[1:30:34] promised
[1:30:36] it to me to
[1:30:39] me that's in the great warrior Joshua
[1:30:42] and no wonder it's called so powerful in
[1:30:45] a title like that what about what
[1:30:47] hearest thou Elijah he said now listen
[1:30:50] when you're watching for the Holy Spirit
[1:30:52] now there's nobody believe this is a
[1:30:54] good one very good one he said now
[1:30:56] listen when you're watching for the Holy
[1:30:57] Spirit there's nobody believes in
[1:30:59] shouting and rejoicing in the spirit any
[1:31:01] more than I do because I believe that
[1:31:03] anything's got
[1:31:05] life has
[1:31:08] emotion so if we have a Revival they're
[1:31:11] calling it a Revival of emotion well if
[1:31:14] emotions are being revived and coming
[1:31:17] back to life and being quickened it must
[1:31:19] be because the word's doing something in
[1:31:21] US it must be because our religion is no
[1:31:24] longer dead it must be because we're
[1:31:27] living by faith now and not by religion
[1:31:31] and if your religion hasn't got some
[1:31:32] life in
[1:31:34] it you'd better bury it instead of
[1:31:38] telling people it's
[1:31:40] Superior you're settled now you've got
[1:31:43] the fullness of the word it's dead he
[1:31:46] said it brings emotion sure it does but
[1:31:50] while we're coming to god let's come
[1:31:53] reverent ly this is powerful quietly
[1:31:57] listening to see what he will say and
[1:32:01] then when he does something for us
[1:32:04] that's the time to let the glory of God
[1:32:08] rain from our hearts brother brandom is
[1:32:11] instructing people about the pearline
[1:32:13] because the the the Methodist and the
[1:32:15] Baptist and the pilgrim Holiness and the
[1:32:18] Nazarene and some of those conservative
[1:32:21] Christians would come to be healed and
[1:32:23] brother brandom meetings line up by the
[1:32:25] thousands to be prayed for and when they
[1:32:28] came to be prayed for in the prayer line
[1:32:30] they'd come very reverently very quietly
[1:32:33] sometimes the Pentecostals because they
[1:32:35] are excitable and they're used to
[1:32:37] expressing more emotion in their in
[1:32:39] their contact with God they would come
[1:32:41] up and before brother brandham could
[1:32:42] ever speak to them they were already
[1:32:45] manifesting and brother brandham was
[1:32:47] trying to explain to them what you need
[1:32:49] to do if you're coming to God with a
[1:32:50] need you come reverently quietly
[1:32:53] listening to see what he will say you
[1:32:56] you come through the pearline and and
[1:32:59] then you know these days somebody wants
[1:33:02] to tell you everything that's wrong with
[1:33:03] them they you've got to listen to the
[1:33:06] whole doctor's prescription before you
[1:33:08] can even pray how many of you know God
[1:33:11] knows he knows sometimes people will
[1:33:14] tell you something it's not even what
[1:33:16] they come for God knows he said you come
[1:33:20] reverently to hear what God might say
[1:33:22] and then when he does something for us
[1:33:24] and that's always when we believe that's
[1:33:27] the time to let the glory of God rain
[1:33:29] from your hearts then you can do some
[1:33:32] manifesting be reverent watch and if out
[1:33:36] in the meeting at any time listen
[1:33:38] anytime out in the meeting you feel that
[1:33:41] God has spoke to your heart while the
[1:33:43] lines are going through raise your hands
[1:33:46] and say thank you Lord Jesus for healing
[1:33:50] me
[1:33:53] it wasn't about being prayed for by the
[1:33:56] prophet having your need
[1:33:58] discerned having your doctor's name
[1:34:01] revealed it was about the atmosphere of
[1:34:04] Faith doing that was like a hook it
[1:34:08] caught the people's attention it
[1:34:11] inspired their faith you don't have to
[1:34:14] have hands laid on you to claim the
[1:34:16] promise of the word you may be right in
[1:34:18] the middle of a sermon sometime and
[1:34:20] something might strike your heart that's
[1:34:22] mine that's when you throw up your hand
[1:34:25] and say thank you Lord that's mine I
[1:34:27] claim that I take
[1:34:30] that and it matters because that's part
[1:34:33] of your testimony and that's how we're
[1:34:35] overcoming not just those in the
[1:34:37] tribulation great day but even now
[1:34:40] that's how we're Overcoming By the blood
[1:34:42] of the Lamb that cleanses us from all
[1:34:44] unrighteousness and by the word of our
[1:34:46] witness he's the same he's a resurrected
[1:34:49] Christ are you still
[1:34:52] here then he said tell somebody sitting
[1:34:54] by
[1:34:57] you we're having a prayer line up here
[1:35:01] Faith strikes your heart you claim your
[1:35:03] promise where you are in your seat he
[1:35:05] said just reach over and tell somebody
[1:35:07] what the Lord's done he just healed me I
[1:35:11] just felt his promise and as I said see
[1:35:14] how quiet it gets see I said the other
[1:35:16] day we're afraid to testify because
[1:35:18] we're afraid it'll come
[1:35:20] back that's not how this thing works you
[1:35:23] can't be afraid to give God praise he's
[1:35:26] worthy of Praise whether your symptoms
[1:35:29] play around with you a little while or
[1:35:31] not he's worthy by the blood of the lamb
[1:35:34] and their testimony they overcame is
[1:35:36] that right you overcome by the blood of
[1:35:38] the lamb and by your testimony if we can
[1:35:40] just have faith and believe in the Lord
[1:35:43] God that he
[1:35:46] will I believe him anybody else
[1:35:50] expectation oh God hear the prayer of
[1:35:53] your servant and as this is closing our
[1:35:55] services on this tour for this beautiful
[1:35:57] wonderful God save America it was a a
[1:36:00] tour he said oh God send the angels of
[1:36:03] God down tonight and may there be such
[1:36:05] an outpouring of the Holy Ghost or the
[1:36:09] Holy Spirit to literally every person in
[1:36:12] the building be healed Grant it Lord you
[1:36:14] know that sounds so outlandish so
[1:36:17] farfetched so unbelievable so grandiose
[1:36:21] but I happen to believe that if the
[1:36:24] right atmosphere is created and you put
[1:36:26] doubt out of your life I I happen to
[1:36:29] believe we can have a service like
[1:36:32] that where every person in the room
[1:36:35] takes a hold of God's word and receives
[1:36:38] their healing I believe it I believe
[1:36:41] it's the bride's inheritance please hear
[1:36:43] my prayer God as I try to serve you
[1:36:45] pleading everything I've got God while
[1:36:47] we're trying to do something for you
[1:36:49] help me dear Jesus to be your servant
[1:36:51] and and may many many many people people
[1:36:54] uh in this building tonight everyone
[1:36:56] that's sick and Afflicted be made
[1:36:58] completely well I I'm reading this
[1:37:00] because this was his faith The God Who
[1:37:03] heals the individual is God to heal he's
[1:37:06] God to heal the whole kitten Kaboodle
[1:37:09] he's God enough to heal them all
[1:37:12] hello well some things don't turn around
[1:37:15] God can turn anything around God can
[1:37:18] turn dementia around God can turn any
[1:37:21] situation around if we have faith to
[1:37:24] believe that's what he said you know
[1:37:28] they the blind man testified he was
[1:37:29] healed and they mocked him they made F
[1:37:32] of him I'm Healed hear ye hear ye I'm
[1:37:36] Healed oh crazy man crazy crazy man
[1:37:41] healed blind as a bat just as blind as
[1:37:44] he ever was tapping along getting in
[1:37:47] everybody's way telling everybody that
[1:37:49] God healed him at the
[1:37:51] meeting but he kept doing cuz that's
[1:37:53] what brother brandham told him the rest
[1:37:55] of the story is he went through the
[1:37:56] perline more than
[1:37:59] once he came back through at least twice
[1:38:02] maybe three times some people say and
[1:38:04] brother brandham told him every time I
[1:38:06] said you're healed I told you you were
[1:38:08] healed go now you're
[1:38:10] healed and he still has to be helped off
[1:38:12] the stage that would be pretty
[1:38:14] discouraging to us to him he finally got
[1:38:18] it second or third time he must mean it
[1:38:22] he must not just mean generally he must
[1:38:24] be mean me individually so that's when
[1:38:27] he started testifying as he sold the
[1:38:29] papers here you here I'm
[1:38:32] Healed sitting down in the barber
[1:38:34] remember you know this story Church of
[1:38:36] Christ Barber days of Miracles are over
[1:38:39] No more healing today hahaa I hear you
[1:38:42] were down at the meeting the other day
[1:38:43] he said yes and the Lord healed
[1:38:47] me and his eyes popped open
[1:38:50] Hallelujah he said I can see
[1:38:54] and brother random said they come back
[1:38:55] and told he he jumped out of the
[1:38:57] barber's chair and run down the street
[1:39:00] with the Barber's apron on him the cape
[1:39:03] on him and here come the Church of
[1:39:05] Christ Barber behind him clapping his
[1:39:07] hand he's healed he's
[1:39:10] healed I thought you just said that he
[1:39:14] didn't heal
[1:39:17] anymore there's nothing like a seeing it
[1:39:19] to make a Believer out of you if you've
[1:39:22] ever seen God do something like that I
[1:39:24] have it's easier for you to believe that
[1:39:26] he'll do it again I said he'll do it
[1:39:30] again oh Lord how happy we'd be we give

[1:40:26] Divine promise from God overcome how by
[1:40:29] taking the word the promise in humility

[1:40:53] standing here trying to take your word
[1:40:55] and explain to the people that was a
[1:40:57] short one by the way trying to take your
[1:40:59] word and explain to the people how to
[1:41:01] overcome you told us how it's done you
[1:41:04] didn't only tell us but you showed us
[1:41:05] how it was done you led us you led us
[1:41:11] hallelujah thank God you showed us how
[1:41:14] to do it here it is here's the
[1:41:17] prescription receive the word inside of
[1:41:20] us and be sure to hold of that word you
[1:41:25] can't hold to the word with your hands
[1:41:27] you hold to the word with your faith
[1:41:30] it
[1:41:32] is in every temptation but be humble
[1:41:35] walk humbly then we have conquered
[1:41:38] through you through your power which is
[1:41:41] already this is good this is good folks
[1:41:45] which has
[1:41:46] already
[1:41:48] conquered already conquered our enemy
[1:41:53] and the only thing we have to do is just
[1:41:55] walk humble with faith believing that
[1:41:57] and our Badge of
[1:41:59] identification of the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:02] guess what has to happen Satan has to
[1:42:05] move does anybody believe
[1:42:07] that do you believe what the Bible said
[1:42:10] whosoever humbleth himself under the
[1:42:12] mighty hand of God him will God exalt in
[1:42:14] due time resist the
[1:42:18] devil possessing all things look what
[1:42:21] Satan did when Jesus laid the word down
[1:42:23] on him it's also written he jumped away
[1:42:26] from the from that wire as I said the
[1:42:28] other night yes sir then what after you
[1:42:33] overcome how do you overcome could you
[1:42:36] ever do it by yourself no make sure you
[1:42:40] understand
[1:42:42] no no no I've just got so much
[1:42:47] anxiety I can barely come to
[1:42:50] church do you really want Jesus
[1:42:54] to confess that before the right hand of
[1:42:57] power and authority Lord I'm here to
[1:43:00] Bear uh my brother's testimony my
[1:43:02] sister's testimony to
[1:43:04] you they've got so much anxiety they can
[1:43:07] barely come to the house of
[1:43:11] God he is the high priest
[1:43:16] of sometimes you have to be willing to
[1:43:19] be a little
[1:43:22] uncomfortable to obey his
[1:43:24] word there's power in obeying God's word
[1:43:28] I wouldn't want that to be my
[1:43:30] confession I'm so nervous I'm just about
[1:43:33] to fall to
[1:43:34] pieces somebody's going to have to pick
[1:43:37] me up I've been there I know exactly
[1:43:40] what that feels like if I talk about it
[1:43:42] too much I can feel that way right
[1:43:44] now once you've ever gone through that
[1:43:47] kind of a place and you begin to talk
[1:43:49] about it or hear somebody else talk
[1:43:51] about it you can almost feel that thing
[1:43:53] working on you again but I know there's
[1:43:56] an answer to get us through it's not put
[1:43:58] on somebody said I don't even believe it
[1:44:00] it's real folks it's real panic attack
[1:44:03] real anxiety real all that real OCD real
[1:44:10] but remember what we learned it's all in
[1:44:12] your mind it's real it's real but it
[1:44:15] Reigns only in your
[1:44:18] mind it has no Authority anywhere else
[1:44:22] so you rewi your mind by grabbing a hold
[1:44:25] of the promise of God and saying I have
[1:44:28] already overcome anxiety by the blood of
[1:44:32] the lamb and by the word of my testimony
[1:44:35] I
[1:44:36] testify that the work is done it's
[1:44:41] finished and I'm not going to wait till
[1:44:43] I feel
[1:44:45] it to move in the opposite
[1:44:49] Spirit I'm going to do it now I'm going
[1:44:52] to put myself out there
[1:45:01] now
[1:45:04] well that got
[1:45:10] exciting how do you overcome could you
[1:45:12] ever do it by yourself
[1:45:14] no somebody went before you remember
[1:45:19] tempted in all manner
[1:45:23] as we are yet without sin you think his
[1:45:27] heart ever nearly exploded with
[1:45:29] anxiety I would think
[1:45:32] so you think he ever got nervous in the
[1:45:36] flesh I think he would remember 100% God
[1:45:39] 100% man that's a
[1:45:42] lot everything that a that a man
[1:45:45] everything a woman go through everything
[1:45:47] you go through in your mind he went
[1:45:48] through in his
[1:45:50] mind the word said in all manner
[1:45:53] does that mean he was ever tempted to be
[1:45:54] jealous the Bible said in all
[1:45:57] manner yet without
[1:45:59] sin he understood that just because a
[1:46:02] thought comes does it mean I have to act
[1:46:05] on that thought does it mean I have to
[1:46:07] entertain that thought he knew exactly
[1:46:10] how to push it down you can't overcome
[1:46:12] by yourself but somebody went before you
[1:46:15] and
[1:46:16] overcome for you it's Christ it's the
[1:46:19] Messiah it's the anointed one and where
[1:46:22] is he now living in is believer living
[1:46:24] in the body of Christ it's Christ I'm
[1:46:27] just an heir of it I I don't have to do
[1:46:30] anything I'm an heir of the promise the
[1:46:32] only thing I have to do is put my
[1:46:39] faith that's a big question isn't it
[1:46:42] sister Flo do you see
[1:46:44] it do you see it well you said you did
[1:46:47] last
[1:46:48] Sunday and you said you did Tuesday
[1:46:50] night but I wasn't with you on Monday

[1:47:02] to get amen that's no accusation that's
[1:47:06] just just instruction that's where we
[1:47:08] got to
[1:47:09] get when we hear the word we hear the
[1:47:11] quote we we get it yes sir I believe
[1:47:14] that but when you go home your head's
[1:47:19] throbbing do you believe it
[1:47:21] then well I think I'm coming down with a
[1:47:24] cold you can if you want
[1:47:28] to must be the flu it can be if you want
[1:47:34] it see do you see it you see what you've
[1:47:39] got to see somebody say what do I have
[1:47:40] to see what do I have to look to what do
[1:47:43] I have to keep my eyes on the finished
[1:47:46] work the finished
[1:47:48] work oh Hallelujah the finished work
[1:47:54] I want you to go quickly I I don't need
[1:47:55] much more time you're going to be
[1:47:57] shocked maybe I don't need a lot of time
[1:48:01] um but you know what I forgot to put the
[1:48:05] scriptures back in my notes I gave them
[1:48:07] to you the first scriptures in Hebrews
[1:48:09] there I think I'm not sure exactly what
[1:48:11] I I guess I could pull it up
[1:48:16] here I forgot to go back and plug them
[1:48:18] in my notes I I put them in your notes
[1:48:26] uh yes thank
[1:48:31] you yes just two places looking under
[1:48:35] Jesus this is Hebrews 12:2 looking un
[1:48:39] Jesus do you see it do you see it here's
[1:48:43] what we're going to see looking under
[1:48:45] Jesus the author and
[1:48:48] finisher the author and finisher
[1:48:53] remember he gave every one of us a
[1:48:55] Measure of Faith that's that's the
[1:48:57] beginning of our
[1:48:58] faith that's the beginning of our faith
[1:49:00] the author he's the author because he
[1:49:02] put it in US you you didn't just you
[1:49:05] know it's not just a regular attribute
[1:49:08] God placed in you a Measure of Faith you
[1:49:12] were born with a Measure of Faith that's
[1:49:15] God the author of your faith he put it
[1:49:18] there but but that's not enough the same
[1:49:22] God who placed the origin the embryonics
[1:49:25] of faith in your life is the god who
[1:49:27] knows how to bring that Faith full
[1:49:29] spectrum and finish it
[1:49:34] out now what is completed finished Faith
[1:49:38] or super Faith that's calling those
[1:49:40] things that are
[1:49:43] not that's being able to say what you
[1:49:46] don't see like brother was singing I'm
[1:49:48] so glad he sees what I don't see
[1:49:52] and so I've got to I've got to hope to
[1:49:55] see what I don't see and how do you do
[1:49:59] that by looking to the Unseen remember
[1:50:02] the message looking to the
[1:50:04] Unseen I've got to find out how to poke
[1:50:07] my head up above what I can see and look
[1:50:11] off to Jesus in the midst of the pain
[1:50:15] and believe that's big looking unto
[1:50:19] Jesus author and finisher of our faith
[1:50:21] who for the joy
[1:50:23] remember in the series on Joy who for
[1:50:25] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:50:27] the cross did you know that was you that
[1:50:31] was you as an overcoming end time
[1:50:33] believer that placed that Joy within his
[1:50:35] heart the Old Testament Prophet said he
[1:50:37] looked and saw his seed he saw what was
[1:50:40] to come he saw the finished work of
[1:50:43] faith in the hearts of end time
[1:50:45] Believers and it brought joy to him in
[1:50:49] the midst of his greatest suffering when
[1:50:51] he was on the cross you and I were on
[1:50:54] his mind he endured the cross despising
[1:50:57] the shame and is sat down at the right
[1:51:00] hand of the Throne of
[1:51:04] God not sitting by the first person of
[1:51:07] the Trinity sitting with his
[1:51:10] father in The Throne the right hand of
[1:51:14] God is the right hand of power and
[1:51:16] authority he's both the author and the
[1:51:20] finisher now here's another one you know
[1:51:22] this well
[1:51:23] come on stay with me just a little while
[1:51:25] longer this is Hebrews 10
[1:51:28] 10-14 but by the wit write that down
[1:51:31] Hebrews 10
[1:51:32] 10-14 by the which we will We excuse me
[1:51:37] by the which will we by the by the which
[1:51:41] will we are Sanctified through the
[1:51:44] offering of the body of Jesus Christ how
[1:51:48] many times how many times did he have to
[1:51:51] be offered one
[1:51:56] months that was that was nearly 2,000
[1:51:58] years ago second temple
[1:52:00] period was that for only people who were
[1:52:03] alive
[1:52:04] then no as long as the world shall
[1:52:08] stand that was
[1:52:10] once for all that's good let's go on
[1:52:14] what does all mean well you know don't
[1:52:15] you and every priest standeth daily
[1:52:18] ministering and offering often times the
[1:52:21] same sacrifice
[1:52:23] is you ought to hear
[1:52:26] this which can never take away sins it
[1:52:31] never
[1:52:33] did and it never can it didn't take away
[1:52:38] sins in the old
[1:52:39] Covenant it didn't take away sins in the
[1:52:42] Tabernacle of the Wilderness it was only
[1:52:44] a covering for sin when Messiah came
[1:52:47] bled and died resurrected from the dead
[1:52:50] he didn't do all that to cover your sin
[1:52:52] he became the
[1:52:54] propitiation the ultimate
[1:52:57] reconciler of our sin his blood does
[1:53:00] more than cover his blood
[1:53:05] remits his blood
[1:53:07] justifies and justification just if I'd
[1:53:12] never
[1:53:13] sinned but this
[1:53:15] man God man after he had
[1:53:20] offered that was all needed
[1:53:24] because it had always been the blood of
[1:53:25] a lamb blood of a goat blood of a turtle
[1:53:28] the blood of this and that of the other
[1:53:30] now it was the blood of God now it was
[1:53:33] the blood that God specifically created
[1:53:36] for the Redemption of all the world no
[1:53:38] wonder you overcome by the blood and by
[1:53:41] the word of your testimony but this man
[1:53:43] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:53:45] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:53:49] of God the right hand of power and
[1:53:51] authority
[1:53:53] unless you're
[1:53:56] Tunis from henceforth
[1:54:00] expecting from that moment till now till
[1:54:04] his
[1:54:07] enemies be made his foot stol it's
[1:54:11] coming it's
[1:54:15] coming for by one
[1:54:17] offering for by one
[1:54:20] offering he hath
[1:54:23] perfected completed
[1:54:27] forever one day when this little bride
[1:54:30] is
[1:54:33] perfected are you going to be a
[1:54:35] thermometer your whole
[1:54:38] life one day when everybody gets it
[1:54:43] right I I got a feeling confessing the
[1:54:46] right thing over your life will help you
[1:54:49] a whole lot more than anything else to
[1:54:51] get it right
[1:54:53] for by one offering he hath perfected
[1:54:56] forever them that are set apart them
[1:55:01] that are
[1:55:02] Sanctified we're not Sanctified by
[1:55:06] following any
[1:55:07] tradition we are Sanctified and the New
[1:55:10] Testament tells us we are Sanctified by
[1:55:14] the
[1:55:15] washing of the water of the the word
[1:55:21] that places Us in the the Waters of
[1:55:23] Separation the washing of the water of
[1:55:25] the word sanctifies us and sets us apart
[1:55:30] the blood purchases US as an agent of
[1:55:34] Grace We're purchased by the blood thank
[1:55:37] God forever more and then Sanctified set
[1:55:41] apart by the washing of the water of the
[1:55:43] word not by our natural seed it's not
[1:55:46] because of any natural seed you possess
[1:55:49] it's because to the believer we carry
[1:55:51] the Royal seed
[1:55:53] it's a seed of Faith the Royal Seed of
[1:55:56] Abraham and This Promise is good also to
[1:55:58] the Natural Seed of Abraham because
[1:56:01] we're promised that there is there shall
[1:56:03] be in the last days in the end time one
[1:56:06] new
[1:56:07] man and if the New Testament is correct
[1:56:10] I believe it has to be it simply says
[1:56:11] neither Jew nor
[1:56:16] Gentile so many would like to interpret
[1:56:19] that to me that everyone would be a Jew
[1:56:22] or become a Jew or or identify as a Jew
[1:56:25] that's not what the word says one new
[1:56:27] man neither Jew nor Gentile don't get
[1:56:30] too carried away it also says neither
[1:56:33] male nor
[1:56:38] female do I have to tell you that
[1:56:40] there's a part of you that is neither
[1:56:42] male nor
[1:56:46] female there's a part of you that is
[1:56:49] eternal and it pre-exists gender
[1:56:53] distinction don't get me wrong don't
[1:56:57] misunderstand what I'm
[1:56:59] saying as Adam was both in the beginning
[1:57:03] both male and female god reached in and
[1:57:06] separated one part from the other now
[1:57:09] what do you see I see the finished work
[1:57:11] of Calvary and let me give you a couple
[1:57:13] of quotations and
[1:57:16] close he said now in in Jesus Christ the
[1:57:19] same yesterday day and forever
[1:57:23] paragraph 18 that goes we're back to the
[1:57:26] notes now the
[1:57:28] original now the only thing I think we
[1:57:31] are now the only thing uh that a Divine
[1:57:36] gift can do is to stir your faith to
[1:57:40] that that's all the Divine gift doesn't
[1:57:43] heal you the Divine gift stir your faith
[1:57:47] uh ministers he said uh can do excuse me
[1:57:51] now the only thing that a Divine gift
[1:57:53] can do is to stir your faith to that
[1:57:55] ministers preach the gospel which is
[1:57:57] just as good as anything else could be
[1:57:59] done better now if a person can just
[1:58:05] take
[1:58:08] God at his
[1:58:14] word and see the
[1:58:18] work finished there at Calvary do you
[1:58:22] see it and accept
[1:58:25] it in their own
[1:58:30] life it's not I believe he died for
[1:58:33] everybody
[1:58:34] else I believe he paid the price for all
[1:58:37] the
[1:58:38] world you can't whip the devil on that
[1:58:41] Revelation but you can whip him on this
[1:58:44] Revelation I believe he paid the price
[1:58:46] for my full salvation he is the captain
[1:58:50] of my salvation he is the author and
[1:58:52] finisher of my
[1:58:55] faith is that right let's read that
[1:58:58] again if a person can just take God at
[1:59:00] his word and see the work finished there
[1:59:02] at Calvary and accept it in their own
[1:59:04] life that settles
[1:59:06] it right
[1:59:09] there that's all is
[1:59:11] necessary then God in his goodness after
[1:59:14] that has sent gifts besides that into
[1:59:17] the church to manifest his love and his
[1:59:19] promises to the people see what I mean
[1:59:21] but every individual must look where to
[1:59:25] Calvary there's there's where it comes
[1:59:28] from is
[1:59:31] Calvary and that's further back than one
[1:59:34] generation ago we're looking all the way
[1:59:36] back now it's just like this put the
[1:59:39] blood of Jesus Christ in a deposit box
[1:59:41] at Calvary to heal all manner of
[1:59:44] sickness and diseases and give every
[1:59:46] believer a checkbook with his name
[1:59:48] signed on the bottom of it that's that's
[1:59:52] good the only thing you have to do
[1:59:58] is and send it
[2:00:01] in
[2:00:03] for any Redemptive blessings that Jesus
[2:00:06] Christ died for you believe that he said
[2:00:10] don't be afraid are you still here the
[2:00:15] living Christ The Living Jesus Christ
[2:00:17] paragraph
[2:00:19] 39 now the thing is to get the
[2:00:21] difference between what is the spirit of
[2:00:23] God oh and the spirit of the devil woo
[2:00:28] that's a big
[2:00:30] e you're not going to listen to one
[2:00:32] message of demonology and have it all
[2:00:34] figured
[2:00:36] out oh no it's a reality like I told
[2:00:40] someone on the phone this
[2:00:44] week when God chooses you to
[2:00:47] see you don't get to choose what you
[2:00:50] see right you just are chosen to see and
[2:00:54] you know anybody in the room would
[2:00:56] volunteer to see The Good The Godly the
[2:00:59] the light angels of the Lord you know uh
[2:01:03] milk and honey flowing from the river
[2:01:06] and all the good things you can
[2:01:08] see but you don't get to only see the
[2:01:11] good you've got to see it all this week
[2:01:15] is the anniversary of a vision that I
[2:01:17] had many years ago uh being in a
[2:01:20] minecart
[2:01:22] and there were many things that God did
[2:01:24] for us in that Vision one included
[2:01:28] moving obstacles and hindrances out of
[2:01:31] our way by the authority of the spoken
[2:01:33] word what what we had accomplished with
[2:01:36] a shovel in the first place could now be
[2:01:40] accomplished by a word spoken and the
[2:01:43] and the obstacle and the hindrance had
[2:01:45] to move itself off of the track that ran
[2:01:48] through the Mind those things are
[2:01:51] powerful because they remind us of the
[2:01:53] Redemptive blessings but there there are
[2:01:56] parts of that you don't get to choose to
[2:01:58] see the the light and not the dark there
[2:02:00] are parts of that very very dis ve very
[2:02:04] uh uh dark in in the sense and and um
[2:02:09] you know negative in the sense that
[2:02:11] there were
[2:02:12] preachers who had an opportunity to go
[2:02:15] ahead and let the bride be what she was
[2:02:18] destined to be in the end time instead
[2:02:21] of holding her back
[2:02:23] and some were given an opportunity in
[2:02:25] that experience to go ahead and take the
[2:02:28] whole word take it all for our day
[2:02:31] instead of believing that some of it had
[2:02:33] already finished and had come to pass
[2:02:36] you see the spirit that brother brandom
[2:02:37] had to fight against was the days of
[2:02:39] Miracles are over the spirit that the
[2:02:41] bride is fighting against in this hour
[2:02:43] is not so very different from that
[2:02:45] Spirit we have to fight against a spirit
[2:02:47] that says the gifts are over the
[2:02:49] supernatural's
[2:02:50] done nobody's getting the Holy Ghost if
[2:02:53] you believe a prophet you've got the
[2:02:55] Holy Ghost
[2:02:56] hogwash then the devil has the Holy
[2:02:58] Ghost because the devil can tell you
[2:03:01] who's an apostle and who's a prophet
[2:03:02] who's a pastor teacher and evangelist he
[2:03:04] knows that doesn't give him the Holy
[2:03:07] Ghost come on on and uh so God in that
[2:03:11] dream extended Mercy uh to those
[2:03:14] seasoned in this thing and gave them an
[2:03:17] opportunity and and one would not would
[2:03:22] not take any kind of help and I saw him
[2:03:26] going over the edge of the minecart into
[2:03:30] total darkness you don't choose uh what
[2:03:34] you see if you want to see Angels
[2:03:37] everybody would sign up but sometimes
[2:03:39] you see Darkness first there's a realm
[2:03:42] that's more real than the one we live in
[2:03:45] it's not a million miles away it's it's
[2:03:48] moving Among Us this morning according
[2:03:50] to this message it's mov moving Among Us
[2:03:52] right now in in a different dimension
[2:03:55] than the one we're walking in because
[2:03:57] dimensions are aren't stacked on top
[2:03:59] like a lot of people have described
[2:04:01] they're parallel dimensions in this
[2:04:03] universe and that's why he tells us that
[2:04:05] one day our loved ones are going to I'm
[2:04:08] going to paraphrase it by saying they're
[2:04:10] going to move toward us and we're going
[2:04:11] to move toward them and he said meet in
[2:04:14] the
[2:04:16] middle my he said our loved ones are not
[2:04:19] very far away from us right now he said
[2:04:22] they could be identified as in this room
[2:04:25] just in another dimension than the one
[2:04:26] we're living in my my my that puts
[2:04:30] things in a little different
[2:04:32] perspective that's not out of sight out
[2:04:34] of mind and so may God grant us all to
[2:04:38] be aware of the difference between the
[2:04:40] spirit of God and what the devil's
[2:04:41] trying to
[2:04:43] do unsanctified Mercy is not a work of
[2:04:47] God it's not a work of
[2:04:49] Christ to compromise with sin to pretend
[2:04:53] to show
[2:04:56] Mercy is absolutely
[2:04:59] ridiculous unsanctified Mercy will
[2:05:02] absolutely shut you
[2:05:04] down from your spiritual giftings
[2:05:07] somebody said what does that mean that
[2:05:09] means there's a mercy that you can show
[2:05:12] that is not of
[2:05:14] God we're supposed to be extending God's
[2:05:18] mercy to
[2:05:20] all some Christians have this idea
[2:05:23] because I'm a Christian I have to be run
[2:05:25] over I have to be mistreated because
[2:05:29] that's my lot as a Christian I can't
[2:05:31] speak up for what's right or myself or
[2:05:34] my
[2:05:35] family now remember speaking up for your
[2:05:37] family doesn't include hitting somebody
[2:05:39] in the head with
[2:05:41] something speaking up for your family
[2:05:44] speaking
[2:05:46] hello but sometimes we show Mercy by by
[2:05:49] letting people off the hook
[2:05:53] when they don't need to be let off the
[2:05:54] hook they need to be
[2:05:56] accountable because if everybody gives
[2:05:58] everybody a
[2:06:00] pass then who would appreciate the
[2:06:03] reality of the Lord's
[2:06:05] Mercy we had a situation in Jerusalem
[2:06:08] where someone was squatting in our
[2:06:10] apartment and they refused to leave many
[2:06:13] years ago this woman she just refused to
[2:06:16] leave and she threatened to take us to
[2:06:19] law if we if we put her out and and the
[2:06:23] Lord challenged me well who wants to put
[2:06:26] someone out we have it there for
[2:06:28] believer who who wants to do something
[2:06:30] like that the Lord challenged me and he
[2:06:32] said don't show her unsanctified mercy
[2:06:35] she doesn't trust
[2:06:37] me she used to trust me she doesn't
[2:06:40] trust me anymore she's depending on what
[2:06:43] you've given her now she needs to depend
[2:06:46] on me because you may not always be
[2:06:48] there for her so what you call showing
[2:06:51] her Christian Compassion is really
[2:06:53] unsanctified mercy and the Lord said I'm
[2:06:55] calling you
[2:06:57] out now that'll that'll wake you up
[2:07:01] hello you don't have to always lay lay
[2:07:04] down and let somebody walk all over you
[2:07:06] to be a Christian you got to Tred a time
[2:07:09] or two
[2:07:12] usually you got to
[2:07:14] forgive but sometimes we have to call
[2:07:16] people out and and attention and say
[2:07:19] wait a minute wait a minute net this is
[2:07:23] a little bit over the
[2:07:25] top I think sometime people don't
[2:07:27] understand that this is not a catchall
[2:07:31] place I'm not interested in just filling
[2:07:34] up a Pew it never was about that it
[2:07:37] didn't start out to be that I don't ever
[2:07:38] want it to become
[2:07:40] that am if we wanted to fill up every
[2:07:43] Pew all we would have to do is start
[2:07:45] giving out food once a week and we could
[2:07:48] fill up the Pew by having Pantry for
[2:07:51] people God has certainly called
[2:07:54] Ministries to do that and to serve
[2:07:57] people but this is not a
[2:07:59] catchall there's a specific work that's
[2:08:02] being done here that doesn't make it
[2:08:04] greater than any other place even though
[2:08:06] it is that doesn't make it any greater
[2:08:09] than any other place it just means it
[2:08:11] has a specific calling and if this is
[2:08:14] not the place where God's doing it I'd
[2:08:16] like to know where the place
[2:08:19] is hallelujah thank God there are many
[2:08:22] places thank God he's moving all over
[2:08:24] the world he he is for those who won't
[2:08:27] deny the word thank God for your name at
[2:08:30] the bottom of that check amen let's go
[2:08:32] back to that quote I got to
[2:08:34] stop did that only take me five minutes
[2:08:38] wow that was a valuable five
[2:08:40] minutes now the got to get the
[2:08:43] difference between the spirit of God and
[2:08:45] what is the spirit of the devil and then
[2:08:47] by the atonement in Calvary the devil is
[2:08:50] cast outo woo and I'll assure you if the
[2:08:54] believer will come and believe right
[2:08:56] here presently no matter what's wrong
[2:08:58] with it it'll take
[2:09:01] place right
[2:09:04] here right here that's right you've
[2:09:08] never seen it fail and it won't but now
[2:09:12] if you go out of here and
[2:09:18] disbelieve or just with a little weak
[2:09:20] faith
[2:09:24] we make sure you read this it'll come
[2:09:26] right back on
[2:09:32] you even worse than what it was in the
[2:09:37] first place you know the devil wants you
[2:09:39] to lose your
[2:09:41] testimony you go out of here with a
[2:09:42] little bit of doubt you may be 100%
[2:09:44] whole you go out here with a little bit
[2:09:46] of doubt and it Delights the enemy to
[2:09:48] put symptoms back on you see I told you
[2:09:51] shouldn't have
[2:09:52] testified oh no for the unclean Spirit
[2:09:55] goes out of a man now listen that's not
[2:09:57] just demon possession disease is an
[2:10:00] unclean
[2:10:02] Spirit anxiety is an unclean
[2:10:05] spirit all right so that you don't have
[2:10:08] to be demon-possessed for the devil to
[2:10:09] go out and walk in dry
[2:10:12] places is that right he said then he
[2:10:14] returns back and if the good man of the
[2:10:16] house isn't there to keep him away you

[2:16:09] quoting today that's all
[2:16:11] right
[2:16:13] mm I see Visions over the people but I
[2:16:16] can't say they're
[2:16:19] healed until until he tells me they're
[2:16:22] healed and he can't
[2:16:26] tell I've already used this quote but I
[2:16:28] put it in this section two he can't tell
[2:16:32] till your
[2:16:33] faith actually
[2:16:36] acts faith without works this is Faith
[2:16:38] with works and your faith
[2:16:43] acting your faith attaching to the
[2:16:46] promise will bring God's word to pass
[2:16:50] you've got to
[2:16:52] this is God's order this is Bible order
[2:16:54] for the promise You' got to believe
[2:16:57] it accept
[2:16:59] it and testify
[2:17:02] it
[2:17:04] oo my my
[2:17:07] my you say I receive it now Lord and
[2:17:11] that settles it forever no matter what I
[2:17:13] feel like nothing about it I'm going to
[2:17:17] believe
[2:17:19] it anyhow
[2:17:22] Lord I
[2:17:24] believe when I pray I pray Lord I
[2:17:27] believe help thou my unbelief but Lord
[2:17:29] when we get that first part of the verse
[2:17:32] there if we if we can speak it with no
[2:17:36] doubt in our heart you promis to give us
[2:17:40] what we
[2:17:42] say we're not asking for something
[2:17:44] outside your
[2:17:46] word we're not asking to win the lottery
[2:17:51] we're not asking for Ed McMahon I guess
[2:17:53] he's dead now maybe we're not asking for
[2:17:56] the publisher sweep Stakes to knock on
[2:17:59] our door
[2:18:00] tomorrow we're asking according to your
[2:18:03] word the promises of your word you did
[2:18:06] say you would provide for our every
[2:18:10] need and we claim that
[2:18:14] promise you did say children is the
[2:18:16] healing healing is the children's bread
[2:18:20] and we're
[2:18:23] children you've called us that
[2:18:27] yours your PE your peculiar
[2:18:33] treasure let's stand together Lord we
[2:18:38] believe there are things that in our
[2:18:41] lives physical
[2:18:44] things symptoms that
[2:18:47] linger there's a root in that there's a
[2:18:49] root there
[2:18:53] sometimes we're making terrible
[2:18:55] choices and our body
[2:18:58] responds then we not only have to stand
[2:19:01] in faith we have to find the will to
[2:19:03] make better choices
[2:19:08] Lord having faith does not
[2:19:12] eliminate the the
[2:19:15] necessity of
[2:19:17] honoring this body that that you've
[2:19:21] given
[2:19:22] us Lord we are a people who have seen
[2:19:25] you
[2:19:26] move I'd say almost everyone in this
[2:19:29] room has seen a
[2:19:31] miracle we've watched what you can
[2:19:35] do we seen you heal broken
[2:19:39] backs people take off braces and
[2:19:42] run we've seen you Lord open blinded
[2:19:46] eyes unsto deaf ears
[2:19:50] Lord with these eyes you give me I've
[2:19:53] seen cancerous tumors fall off after
[2:19:56] prayer goers
[2:20:01] disappear I know you're the same
[2:20:04] God you have not
[2:20:07] changed surely your word
[2:20:10] works for a lingering
[2:20:14] headache for high blood
[2:20:17] pressure for sugar problems
[2:20:22] it's not just physical needs we have
[2:20:24] Lord we need
[2:20:26] freedom from worry and
[2:20:30] doubt anxiety
[2:20:33] and the spirit of supposition that makes
[2:20:37] us always suppose that we know what's
[2:20:40] happening what's going on what a
[2:20:42] situation is when sometimes we just
[2:20:45] don't really get
[2:20:47] it regardless of what linger and weighs
[2:20:51] us down and hinders us Lord we believe
[2:20:55] that taking your word using faith we can
[2:20:59] speak to every bit of
[2:21:02] it and it has to
[2:21:04] go we speak to
[2:21:07] confusion to memory
[2:21:13] loss all of these things that trouble
[2:21:16] your
[2:21:17] people we we speak to them
[2:21:21] believing that you have provided you
[2:21:23] don't have to die again you don't have
[2:21:25] to do anything else you've provided for
[2:21:28] healing in the
[2:21:30] atonement for calm nerves in the
[2:21:37] atonement OCD can't
[2:21:41] stand
[2:21:43] autism all of its many variations on the
[2:21:48] scale none of that can
[2:21:52] stand your word promised us
[2:21:57] wholeness and healing
[2:22:00] depression is a is a destiny
[2:22:04] robber it can't come from anywhere but
[2:22:07] the
[2:22:08] thief we know Lord that that by Your
[2:22:12] Word we have authority over
[2:22:15] that insecurities and inferiorities and
[2:22:22] some of us need Deliverance of our
[2:22:24] overactive
[2:22:29] imaginations father we just want to be
[2:22:31] whole
[2:22:33] people we we're not wanting to be
[2:22:37] Fanatics unless it's for
[2:22:40] you we don't mind being a nut as long as
[2:22:43] we're threaded to the right bolt and
[2:22:45] that would be you Lord we don't mind
[2:22:47] what the world I put put a quote in the
[2:22:50] note
[2:22:51] for for the next few Services where you
[2:22:54] your Prophet talked
[2:22:56] about those who believe in the
[2:22:58] Supernatural and take God is at his word
[2:23:00] are often identified as
[2:23:03] neurotics Lord I don't mind being a
[2:23:05] neurotic if it's that I'm taking you at
[2:23:07] your
[2:23:09] word and some of us are oppressed in our
[2:23:12] finances and if we have been
[2:23:16] faithful if we have been faithful to do
[2:23:19] our part
[2:23:21] we have every
[2:23:23] right to claim that you will multiply
[2:23:26] the seed that we have
[2:23:28] sown and open Windows of Heaven our Rah
[2:23:33] and pour out blessings that we don't
[2:23:36] have room enough to contain we we turn
[2:23:39] our umbrellas upside down and claim the
[2:23:43] promises of God that rain down upon us
[2:23:46] we are positioning ourselves to receive
[2:23:50] Vital Inheritance in every area of our
[2:23:54] life Hallelujah can anybody take some
[2:23:57] Faith now and agree with that I'm
[2:24:00] claiming Bridal inheritance in every
[2:24:03] area of my
[2:24:05] life I I I'm resisting the spirit of
[2:24:10] poverty and I'm reaching for the
[2:24:12] abundance that the word has promised to
[2:24:15] the
[2:24:16] believer I don't plan to live the rest
[2:24:19] of my life from paycheck to paycheck I'm
[2:24:22] not asking to be a rich beyond my my
[2:24:25] mind's dream I'm just believing that if
[2:24:28] we are
[2:24:30] faithful in Covenant with you that you
[2:24:33] will bless the
[2:24:35] seed that we have sown if anybody tries
[2:24:38] to misunderstand that Lord I I ask you
[2:24:41] to convict their heart it's just simple
[2:24:44] promise we don't sow uh uh sparingly we
[2:24:49] we seow generously because we believe
[2:24:52] that our Harvest is
[2:24:55] proportion to our
[2:24:58] sewing there are just so many areas some
[2:25:01] of us need some peace in our homes we
[2:25:04] need some order with our children we we
[2:25:08] want to be whole in every area of our
[2:25:12] life so today we take these Divine
[2:25:15] Promises of God and once again let our
[2:25:18] faith grab a hold of them
[2:25:20] and we don't say one glorious day uh in
[2:25:24] the by and by in the Sweet By and By we
[2:25:27] say what the word says it's
[2:25:30] already paid for it's already
[2:25:35] done we stand on
[2:25:38] it hallelujah hallelujah in the name of
[2:25:44] Jesus in the name of
[2:25:47] Jesus we thank you for authority over
[2:25:50] angry moles and
[2:25:54] growths in the name of Jesus we thank
[2:25:58] you for
[2:26:00] Authority I remember asking on a Tuesday
[2:26:03] night concerning a growth on my body
[2:26:07] that had double tripled in
[2:26:10] size and uh the People Prayed and we
[2:26:13] agreed and within just a short time half
[2:26:16] of it f fell off and I could hold it in
[2:26:20] my hand and it wasn't much longer that
[2:26:24] every bit of it was gone Lord we're
[2:26:28] thanking you for authority over angry
[2:26:31] moles and growths and skin tags and and
[2:26:36] and even deeper tissue lumps and your
[2:26:40] word is greater than than any a
[2:26:45] symptom thank you Jesus hallelujah
[2:26:49] hallelujah
[2:26:51] oh my just real soft play something very
[2:26:56] very soft while our faith is being

[2:27:03] take God we want to take God at his word
[2:27:07] right now Hallelujah Lord
[2:27:11] Jesus not only can you make
[2:27:14] malfunctioning kidneys function but you
[2:27:18] once showed me a table in another realm
[2:27:21] where there were shiny new
[2:27:24] organs and you said that in that last
[2:27:28] day there would be those who would reach
[2:27:30] up in faith and take a hold of a new
[2:27:32] organ for their body it's not impossible
[2:27:35] for you to give somebody new kidneys or
[2:27:38] a new liver or new
[2:27:41] lungs you created the ones we have now
[2:27:45] maybe that's too much for somebody but
[2:27:47] that's not too much for your bride

[2:28:01] hip Lord I'm asking you to touch eyes in
[2:28:05] this room today whose vision is not
[2:28:08] improving but seemingly getting worse
[2:28:13] you are a God who is more than
[2:28:17] able we've prayed for people who
[2:28:21] went through a healing process of
[2:28:23] walking backwards in their
[2:28:25] prescription until a day they didn't
[2:28:28] even need a pair of
[2:28:30] glasses you're the god you're the
[2:28:35] God I've seen you do dental
[2:28:44] Miracles I don't know what your people
[2:28:46] need but you
[2:28:48] do come Jesus
[2:28:56] it's not our faith in a church or our
[2:28:59] pastor or a prophet or a movement it's
[2:29:02] our faith in
[2:29:04] you that we're activating
[2:29:08] now Lord move among

[2:29:15] put your mind right on him and just
[2:29:18] where you are just just thank him

[2:29:22] presence if you will thank him for his
[2:29:24] presence he'll come closer to you Lord I
[2:29:27] Thank You for Your Presence among us

[2:29:38] together increasing the magnitude of
[2:29:41] your presence Among Us corporately Lord

[2:31:44] needs and we're bringing them to the
[2:31:47] Lord we're coming in you know position
