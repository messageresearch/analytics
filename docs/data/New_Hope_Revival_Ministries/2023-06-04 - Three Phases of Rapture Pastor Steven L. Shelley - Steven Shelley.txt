quietest World you'll ever live in whoo if you get there I guarantee you it's not going to be a Catholic service we try to have one I'll be the one running circles my old great aunt used to sing a song said if you don't like shouting you better get don't get on the cloud with me [Music] the Bible tells us that hell is a place of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth there'll be no nerve pills there'll be no heroin to shoot up there'll be no mushrooms to have even the noise itself will be a torment and in eternity when the redeemed of the Lord we're gonna of course we're going to Bow reverently at his feet but that's not all eternity is going to be it's going to be the greatest celebration that that we've ever experienced in our lives the redeemed of all the ages the bride out of

oh this is just what heaven me to me [Music] there's so many things to think about when we think about heaven I think the most amazing thing is going to be to look upon the face of our precious Lord who paid such a awful price that we would be redeemed back to God's original thoughts about us but I like most of you have been a victim of misunderstanding sometimes I misunderstood and sometimes I was misunderstood if I had to pick for myself the second most wonderful thing about heaven it would be verse two the fact that there will be no more misunderstanding we'll be won together no more Church fights no more shunning oh no we'll just be one together with him whoa give him praise [Music] it's a place where there is no misunderstanding thank you Lord and from all enmity and strife

this is just what heaven means to me [Music] what a place he has prepared I don't know about you but I appreciate anointed musicians and would you thank God for these singers [Applause] praise the Lord this is just a wonderful atmosphere it reminds me of that old course we used to sing This is Just Like Heaven to Me we've crossed over Jordan the canaan's fair land it feels that way sometime when we get in God's presence I realize we have visitors here tonight and you're most welcome whether you've joined us in person or or on the Stream we did our best I hope to worship God just like we normally would I think we should I don't really know how to put on errors if I did I might would do it so I never learned to put on air so I'd rather just be who God made us to be but I'm I'm a happy man tonight because I got to meet some more precious friends today from Ohio and I didn't have anything to do with it except prayers I'm so thankful to see years of prayers being answered as God is gently leading many people out of the Amish church and not only into into free salvation but also into the truth the truth the message for this hour I could jump over this Pulpit tonight you might have to pick me up when I got on the other side it just makes me that happy to have prayed all these years uh brother Elam I'll tell on him again he's very easy to pick on just to weave we fellow there and he's easy to pick on I said brother Elam I want to meet those Ohio people I want to meet them I mean I may have to go up there and meet them in Ohio but I'd like for them to come well brother I don't know they're you know they stay close to home they're busy they've got the farm they've got everything and I said well we're going to pray we're going to pray and you know I thought well somewhere often that you you better know what you're doing when you pray God will surprise you and answer you he did it I I'm I'm taking that I'm taking that as a as a testimony uh I didn't know it would be this weekend but God answered prayer we've got to meet four of them and we're looking forward maybe to having an opportunity to meet more and you heard the testimony here how long ago was the baptism two months yeah yeah I know you you you just baptized some of these very recently didn't you they were just Baptist look at the back row back there these are recent baptized Brothers Hallelujah Hallelujah in Ohio that the baptism took place and how many were baptized that day 17. praise the Lord [Applause] uh somebody said does it matter how you're baptized are you kidding me [Music] you just asked their forefathers if it matters about baptism they only had us a portion of Revelation concerning baptism the anabaptist people only knew that infant baptism was not right and that sprinkling was not right some of them began to see that some of them they didn't know anything about baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so they died many many many died for a portion of the truth you and I ought to be careful how we handle the truth because people died for a portion of the truth we used to crack ice on the on the lake to baptize people in titles because we didn't know any better than that so we ought to be very thankful that God has revealed this true Christian baptism by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in running water yeah yeah because no matter where we are we run it in and run it out they told me they said well you can't baptize people in the bathtub you can't baptize people in the cow trough you can't baptize people in a swimming pool I said you get out of my way I'll baptize them anywhere I can get enough water to dunk them when I when I turn on the fossil sound that's running water [Music] oh I need to preach but I'm having such a good time would you turn with me this evening to first Thessalonians chapter 4. and we have been there as a church body for a few weeks now and I'm going to have to do a a really quick review just a tad down on the monitor here I know you never hear me say that but just a tad do you know what a tad is I'm going to have to do just a little quick review for those who are have not been with us these last few weeks I asked the Lord for something catchy and I asked the Lord to give me a Revival style message and I I wanted to just do that when you all come to fellowship with us but the Lord just arrested me and uh this afternoon I thought I could wiggle out of it but he re he really arrested me and I think it's very very important for us to know where we are in this great economy of God and and I just I'm so thankful anyway first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself not a prophet not a bishop not a pastor for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout a message to awaken the bride with the voice of the Archangel the chief Angel the voice of Jesus in a mini-membered bride and with the Trump the last Trump the final Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord let's pray together for just a few moments father we have come into this place tonight to exalt your name to worship you because you alone are worthy we have come to enter into your presence and therefore we welcome the angels we welcome the heavenly host in our midst as brother Branham would often call them to come and take up their position around the walls and on the ends of the pews we thank you that they have come because the redeemed of the Lord are here they are here because we are here and we give you the praise we have come now to a part of the service that brings change it's not our feeling it's not our worship it's not our enjoyment of the songs it's not a sensation or a feeling in our physical body that brings true change it's only your word and even your word can come as a dry letter unless the spirit comes and anoints us to hear that word we're not asking you to anoint your word your word is anointing your word is spirit life we're asking you to anoint the lips of your servant to bring it and we are asking that our ears would be anointed to hear it and that it would execute change in our lives now Lord many here are tired in physical body having worked today and some having traveled many miles to be here in this service tonight but we cannot afford to waste these moments that we have together so I ask you to help us to be alert I ask you to help us to pull upon the gift of God that you might come and answer questions in this room that you might come and speak directly to the needs of your people I pray Lord that you will help your people even now to use their pool of Faith their faith pool to pull the word of God in their direction that it might bring change that it might bring life that it might bring Direction Lord we are thankful to be living in the last of the last days we are thankful that you have preserved the remnant bride in this hour of great apostasy we thank you that you have reserved Truth for us and Truth is not a Doctrine but a person and you are that person and we thank you for who you are and what you have done in US and through us we thank you for authority over every demon power and we command every opposing and distracting Spirit to Bow right now to the authority of Jesus Christ The Living Word who walks among us tonight and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen God bless you as you take your seats this evening we're talking about Rapture anointing we're talking about a faith for rapture you you can't catch Rapture Faith from a magnetic recording but you can hear truth on a recording that strikes your heart and causes an intellectual bit of information to drop down from your head to your heart and all the way down to your feet so that you can walk it out we don't have a problem in this bride of of uh of of a lack of the word we have the word we have heard the truth the truth has been stored for us and we're thankful for spiritual food in due season but I want you to know that if you're not careful you can become educated and you can even become an educated fool so smart you don't know how to apply anything you know and it takes a revelation for this word you know the the problem is is about 12 inches or 18 inches long it's about the distance from here to here if we can get it out of our heads and into our heart then it can go to our hands and our feet and we can live it before a world that's dying and going to hell a world that needs Jesus with skin on him I want you to know the reason why a remnant bride has been called out is so that Jesus can have skin again on this Earth and we may see one another's flaws and we may see one another's warrants and we may see one another's pimples but I want you to know there's a way to look at each other where we're seeing Christ in each other and what the Living Word is producing in lives in this room tonight is worth celebrating what God is doing Among Us and among his people around the world is worth celebrating the word is becoming flesh again you understand this was what the message came to do not only in brother branham's flesh but in your flesh and in my flesh so what do we do we cry out for it we position ourselves to receive it we come out of dead dry formalism [Applause] and we plug into the real power of God because there's power in this little bride there's enough power in this little bride gathered here tonight to raise the dead and heal the sick open blinded eyes and cause the lame to get up and walk it's here and we must recognize that it's here and we must treat him as something so precious and so valuable that we don't want to do anything to offend the Holy Spirit we want to be conduits and we want to be vessels for the Holy Ghost to flow through is it too loud out there you're sure if it is let them fix it it seems Mighty loud in here to me maybe that's because you're so quiet I feel good I don't know if I feel like preaching or not but I feel good hallelujah it's not a Feeling I know what it means to feel like you're in the throes of despair come on I know what it feels like to sit in the corner and want to eat worms because nobody loves you and everybody hates you and I've been down that Journey I've sat under a juniper tree I know what it feels like to be under the gourd Vine you better be careful how much time you spend under the gourd Vine because God will send a worm to each a gourd Vine out of the way he'll crack you on the head but that gourd won't he and tell you to get up and do something for him obedience is better than sacrifice God's looking for an obedient people in this hour if you believe that same man so what we've been studying is when we came out of Pentecost many many years ago they emphasized to us that the Rapture was was a a a a blink of an eye it was a it was a twinkle of an eye thing you never knew when it was going to happen and if you called your loved ones and they didn't answer the telephone you thought the Rapture had taken place so disqualify us and lie to us and try to steal the joy of Salvation from us and I'd call my sainted granny on the phone and she wouldn't answer the phone she always answer the phone she wouldn't answer the phone and I think oh I've missed it because I knew that it was according to what the church was teaching it was a very quick thing boom boom and it's over with just in a twinkling of an eye it never seemed quite right to me but I had nothing else to go on until I heard a messenger quoting the word I'd read this verse of scripture as much as any of the other verses of scripture but I never saw the process until God sent a prophet to pull that process right out of the pages of the word and show me that it's three phases of rapture hello the Lord is descending first in a shout and that shout is a message and that message is not William Branham that message is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ you see we don't have to have Brother branham's picture up in here to remind us that God sent a prophet in our day it's why we're gathered here this way we know what God has done and we honor that and we make the quotation and we constantly say what he said and try to do as he was doing but I want you to know that's not all that we've got to be concerned about in this hour because it's not a prophet coming down that we don't want to miss it's the Lord himself coming down in a shout and the message is not a Doctrine and the message is not at another denomination and the message is not this or that or the other the message is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he's no longer behind the lattice he's no longer hidden behind the ladders he has stepped out from behind the lattice and he is making himself known to his little bride all the little turtle doves are cooing the springtime is coming I I look across this landscape in the spirit and I can see as the scripture said I can see the little bride coming out of the wilderness oh just a minute ah [Music] I can see that little bride coming out of the Wilderness and she's not leaning on a prophet ing on her pastors she's not leaning on a five-fold Ministry that little bride is leaning on her beloved who is this that I see coming out of the Wilderness this the songwriter wrote It's that lovely bride of Jesus Christ she's leaning on her broad group you know why because she can't walk it by herself I want to go ahead and tell you you can't live this life by yourself you can't toe the line by yourself you can't work your way to the Revelation I'm preaching about tonight it's not about striving to get there it's about yielding did you know it's easier to strive than yield it's harder work to yield somebody said how could you say it's harder work to yield because the Apostle tells us that in the book of Hebrews he said you've got to strive to rest that means it's hard work to get to rest but how many of you want to find that place of rest in him where you can call no matter who and if if they don't answer the phone you don't have to worry about missing the rapture you see I came on into the revelation of the message and begin to understand that I was born I was created for the rapture have come to the Revelation as brother Branham did there will be no rapture it'll get quiet now half the Cradle amen the other half there will be no rapture without me oh doesn't that sound like bride bride well it could be but some of you remember you spent many years of your life in a faith that taught you you couldn't even know you were saved because to know you were saved was Pride oh that breaks my heart sister Martha Knowles brother Truman knows it's one of the first things I ever discussed with them many years ago when I met them that's what breaks my heart it breaks my heart to think that you you ride in a horse and a buggy all your life you don't even plug in oh my I don't know how to I don't oh I must be the worldliest of the worldly I don't know how I could make it without a car to get where I need to go I don't know how I can make it without electricity but here I met these people that that wouldn't have a frilly curtain in their window only a green shade and and living not even a button on their clothes some of them pinning their clothes because a button might be prideful and then you begin to talk to them about salvation I'm in a little buggy I'm riding in a little buggy in Lancaster County with a man and I began to talk to him and witness to him he lost his whole family in a kerosene fire he left the Amish Faith because his whole family burned to death and I've been getting a witness to him and tell him you can know you are saved you can know that you've been born again her hope doesn't lie in the church your hope lies in the savior said but we've been taught all of our lives that you can't even say you're saved and I said well it's a shame because the Bible said you can the Bible said you can know you're saved by the coming alive King James says quickening of your spirit the quickening in your spirit it's a resurrection that takes place and because you know the old man is dead and the new man has come to lie you can know that you're saved you get a revelation of this message and you can know you're not going to miss the rapture I love to say this especially to newbies brother random said you can come to that place of Revelation where you realize that you could no more be lost [Music] that's a long way brother Elam Fisher that's a long way from not knowing you're saved to come all the way over here and say I could no more be lost than God be lost somebody said well what was between that it wasn't a false Doctrine it was a revelation of a word a word that taught us that before this world was ever framed God knew it all he knew it all I said God knew it all and by his foreknowledge by what he knew he knew who would choose him and who would not choose him and those that would choose him he said hey I'll give them a prefixed destiny I'll send them on a journey through life with Hills and Valleys smooth places and lots of rough places I'll bring them in one church and out of that church and into another church and out of that church and through another group and out of that group and they'll stick with me for the ride you know why you're where you are today because God knew you wouldn't jump off the coaster he knew he knew that you would stay the course when he the spirit has come he will lead us into what oh truth so we begin to hear from a prophet that this Rapture right out of the scripture it's it's a revelation more than an event more than an event more than a event let me say it goes I can't hardly say an event more than an event it's a process it's a revelation it's it's a message a shout coming down that awakens the sleeping people to understand that church is not satisfying that longing in our heart and even Community is not satisfying that longing in our heart because when Jesus was hanging on the cross the prophet of the Old Testament said he will see his seed when he was dying suspended Between Heaven and Earth he saw his seed he saw his elect he saw you and I anybody with me tonight he saw he saw it and he knew we would be broken people and he knew we would fall and we would and we would stumble and he knew that we would get discouraged and he knew that we would become depressed at times and we would have to fight our way through but he knew that he was going to be there to help us he was going to shelter Us in his arms and he was going to be there for us to lean on him here she comes leaning on her beloved she doesn't smell like the world anymore she doesn't smell like denominational system anymore she doesn't smell like a trinitarian lie anymore smells just like her bridegroom her fragrance is his fragrance her vocabulary must become his vocabulary the power of the spoken word must be in her mouth even as it was in his mouth because the prophet said that we will have that little bride will have the saith the Lord or she will hold her peace and so we are on a process as a process is unfolding before us and a message is gathered us we know and I've gone through this we that have been here we understand Malachi 4 5 and 6. we understand Matthew 17 9-13 we understand that he came in a shout which was a message to gather the elect back to the word of God back to God's original thoughts about us well that's good to call them from the denominations her Creeds and dogmas to bring them where to the word this is the written record of the word this is precious to us because it is the written record of the word but our change doesn't take place only by holding on to the written record of the word it's the Living Word Jesus Christ come on it's the it's encountering the Living Word that releases us to us the authority in power what else do you have I forgot you even had that is that all well I don't have to preach I can just read we understand the Midnight Cry we understand Matthew 25 and at the midnight verse 6 and at the midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom coming go ye out to meet him we've heard that we've heard Revelation 18 and 4 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her hey yes yes come on you can't read that like come out of her no you've got to read it like it was come out come out here my people that should be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not of her plagues I don't want any part of that Babylonian system I don't want the paganism of Rome to influence my faith today can anybody help me so we've rejected pagan gods and we've rejected Pagan baptism we've rejected pagan holidays [Applause] we've come now into the fullness of the word and we're being changed we haven't arrived yet God's still working on us because once you eat this book there's some more stages that have to take place in your life because what's originally sweet in your mouth is going to get bit bitter in your belly you're going to have some proving to do we understand how God sent that Prophet Messenger to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers how John the Baptist fulfilled a portion of the Malachi prophecy how brother Branham was sin of God to fulfill the second portion of that prophecy and we understand how important it is to listen to the prophets because Acts chapter 3 verse 23 tells us and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people God's real particular about hearing His prophets anybody with me we've come to understand that the message unlocks the gospel of the Kingdom but what we have not always understood is what brother Branham tells us in questions and answers on the seals paragraph 252. and finally one day he said behold there he is this is John the Baptist this is the one chosen to fulfill the first portion of Malachi's prophecy behold there he is there is a lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he didn't say there's my cousin he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and then he said and my time is up now [Music] John the Baptist tell us I must decrease because he's coming along to increase same thing here the prophet is telling us he said I must decrease now I must go off the scene just like John the Baptist went off the scene he'll oh my God I remember sitting all night in Tucson Arizona with brother Perry green first time I met him in the early 90s we never went to bed we had a good service that night when we got through we went and got a bite to eat when we got through that we came back to his to its office I was staying in brother Sydney Jackson's apartment in the back of the Tucson Tabernacle and brother green began to share stories with me one right after another about three o'clock in the morning he said don't you expect we ought to go to bed we got to do this again tomorrow and I said not not a chance I'm not going anywhere I'm going to hear the rest of this and he began to continue to share stories with me in about five o'clock I don't know the sun was up and it was breakfast time in fact I think maybe we went and ate breakfast before we ever laid down it's because these things are so precious and he began to describe to me what it felt like all of a sudden to realize that brother Branham was gone it reminded me of how the disciples must have felt following and seeing these Miracles and signs and wonders and now one of the most used most used Ministry in a whole generation believing and brother Brandon was constantly talking about what was coming and what was coming and what was about to happen and the and and and my new ministry he talked about and when the fullness of that third pool and he was constantly pointing to the Future and then all of a sudden he was gone my brother green tells the story of sitting in the airplane hangar alone with brother branham's casket and he said I'm not ashamed to tell you that several times through the night while we were waiting on the next flight out I laid my ear over against that casket hoping to hear brother brand I'm saying brother Perry let me out of here I chuckled said I know it sounds funny but it wasn't funny I was that serious I could not see how we could be left like this how would we ever get through how would we ever make it how would we ever learn what we needed to learn and hear what we needed to hear and receive what we needed to receive and I said well brother green I I I appreciate this this is the most wonderful testimonies I've ever heard in my life but I said I just need to remind you of something that I read that today that brother Branham said and I read him this very quote we didn't have phones we couldn't pull it up on our phone I had it printed out and had it in my Bible and I reached over and got my Bible and I read him this quote and this was the part that quickened both of us heal take over from here if God leaves a generation without a prophet messenger you can rest assure it's because he plans to take over help me now it's Jesus Among Us it's Jesus with us it's Jesus in US [Music] and I remember preaching in the Christmas meeting that year and stepping down you know I often joke about my friend uh Jim diff and durfer who went to be with the Lord just he was running the lights and I would step down to the bottom platform and the light would pop on I'd step back up behind the pulpit and that light would go out and that really bothered me I it distracted me and finally I said would you just leave the lights on or off I'm trying to preach down here and because of that we became very good friends I remember what I said that night the last time I stepped down and the lights went off now remember this was a meeting that was called to commemorate brother branham's homegoing every year the December meetings in Tucson Tabernacle they always started on the night of the wreck and ended on the night of brother branham's death and so this had been a tradition and the bride was coming from all over the world and I was the new kid on the Block I was only three years four years in the message and I had been invited to preach this convention I didn't know this was going to come out of me I didn't know I was standing before return Ministry people and people that believe brother Brandon was going to raise from the dead and have a tent meeting and I didn't know half of what was in that room that night all I knew is the Lord had said to me as a little boy you open your mouth and I will fill it and I opened my mouth that night and I stepped down to that lower level and a voice spoke out of me it was sounding like me but I don't know where it come from and that voice said I God would have never taken his servant there's not an accident there was not a car accident that was not a death there was not a disease that could have taken brother branham's life had God not have been finished with what he sent him here to do and when I said it it shocked me and I caught myself like that I looked up there at brother green and he goes oh yeah I said brother green am I wrong did I say something wrong am I going to get in trouble for it he said I didn't do that because you were wrong I did it because I had never thought of it myself he said I've still been asking God why why did you why did he have to go now why did he have to go in the car accident why did it have to be why did it have to be that way and he said all of a sudden when you said that it was like a light bulb come on God never makes a mistake he took him because he knew that if he left brother Brandon here the people would continue to cling to him it would have become a bigger cult today than it already is in some places the reason why God was able to take brother random is because he knew that he was coming him take care of business because if you get this Living Word in the people yeah if you get it out of their heads and into their hearts by revelation then it's Jesus Among Us oh you got to help me [Applause] you've got to learn to look beyond the badger skins brother the badger skins will fail you your pastors will fail you your leaders will fail you but there's one living in your shoe leather or or are living in your bare feet brother there's one living in you that'll never fail you [Applause] there'll not be a Rapture without you in it if God saw you before the foundation of the world and you were in his mind he gave you a prefix destiny he intended to take care of whatever he has to take care of to get you to that place so when the Trials come be careful how you murmur when the heartaches come be careful how you complain [Applause] because God harnesses the prophet said God harness his troubles he takes them by the reins and pulls them in so that they can transport you and I changed we're being changed he said I've introduced you to him I must decrease now I must go off the scene he'll take over from here the Millennium will be on right away see the time is at hand and then the spoken word is the Original Seed and I've got to hurry paragraph 119 brother random said my mission that I believe that God has called me for he said I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do see and tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is is what is to forerun [Music] you see brother random knew what was following him he knew that once that word gotten to people you understand what I'm saying when that Living Word comes inside of you he gives you full Authority yeah somebody said I'll be so glad when the power of the spoken word is restored I thought that's what the truth came to do I thought it was restored the power of the spoken word is restored God's just building a house to live in right now he's just getting the people ready so that when he speaks she speaks for him did you know the voice of the archangel it's the voice of Christ in a many membered bride did you know it's prophesy again did you know it's not enough to say that a prophet has brought us the word now a people has to produce the proof that she has been with the bridegroom you see there was a time we could say well I go to that church I belong to that church that man is my pastor I'm following that but how many of you know we've come to an hour now where none of that means anything it's going to be who's been with Christ who's been in the tent with him [Music] yes who has known him in an intimate way don't don't be vulgar understand what it means to be in to be intimate with Christ do you know the word no in the Bible is a word that is used for knowing a man it's also the same word that's used for receiving a revelation of Truth and so we understand that as our bridegroom we We join ourselves with him we must go into that Bridal canopy that veil has to fall behind us the prophet said shutting out the world shutting us into the glories of Christ how many of you are willing to go behind the veil with him I've got many friends who want I've got many friends who want because if you call them to anything higher they want to turn around and see if they can take brother Brandon by the hand or they want to see if they can turn around and get their Pastor or preacher by the hand and pull him in but I want you to know that two is a company and three is a crowd there is a place in Jesus Christ that only you and him can go did you know a husband can't go there for his wife and a wife can't go there for her husband and God has no grandchildren each one of us may have must have our own personal experience with Jesus Christ we must all be changed we must all be Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and filled with the earnest of the Holy Ghost until we come to the ceiling so here he goes on to say my Ministry is to forerun the coming word and then if you've got any any concern about what the coming word is he tells us it's not it's not a book it's not an app it's not a tape the coming word is a person you sure you see that he said the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the millennium so you bring Christ into the People by the power of the Living Word brother Branham comes to forerun the coming word then the coming word steps on the scene which is which is Christ in plain view out from behind the veil out from behind the lattice and then he steps into his people by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and by doing so the Millennium is in Christ so when Christ comes into you he brings the hope of the millennium somebody give me some example of what the Bible there is a millennium by the way there's a literal devil it may not be Eternal but there's a literal hell you see the only way to have eternal life is to be born again isn't that right didn't the scripture say The Souls of sin it shall surely die brother man said I don't know how long hell this is I I don't know it could be a million years or a thousand years or ten thousand years nobody knows but he said the scripture said the soul that Sinners shall surely die the only way to have eternal life is to have Jesus Christ Living inside he brings Zoe life which is eternal life and you get all of that in you but but yes there's a literal devil yes there's a literal hell yes there is a literal millennium but there's also a principle and concept of millennium and when you get Christ when you receive the Living Word into your life he brings all that the Millennium is with him so can somebody tell me something the scripture says about the millennium give me an example I'm opening the floor what what what are what are some verses that that tell us about the coming Millennium and what it would be like to to live and reign with Christ a thousand years what is the description of what that will look like it is Sabbath it is rest what I'm looking for tonight is this this verse that we get the song from the lion shall lay down next to the lamb a little child shall lead them a little baby a little infant playing on the whole of the asp one of the most poisonous snakes the the wolf shall be tame you know why because the curse is removed it's not that sink in the curse is removed that's one of the greatest things about the Millennium is there's no more curse so the animal the animal kingdom functions as it was created to function in the beginning there's no dangerous animal they all love one another they roll around can you imagine oh my goodness I guarantee you I'm going to lay down on a lion I guarantee you I'm going to lay my big old head right up against a big old beautiful roaring lion and he'll never look at me like a snack or is like Ben says about me a buffet oh yeah end up being so they gonna see who you are the boy who dares to call me that he he will love me and I will love him the wolf will lay on my lap there will be no need to break the ground I know the farmers in here be thankful for that there will be no reason to till the land anymore or plant the seed or or this is my part I'm I've never run a farm I have worked a little bit as a boy on my grandparents farm and what I hated the worst was getting the weeds oh my goodness and and you know what the sometimes little kids around here they don't know what happens and they they'll come in they want to help you pull weeds and they'll get them and shake them real good so all the seed go right back in the ground you know we've got those little see those little weeds we get around here that's got the the spores underneath like a fern and they're just shaking them like that and you so it's just a constant effort to get them out but I'm telling you in the Millennium the Earth is no longer under its curse the animal kingdom is no longer when Christ comes to live inside if brother Branham could move out of the way if John the Baptist could move out of the way so Christ could step in if brother Branham could move out of the way when God was finished with his commission so that Christ The Living Word could step inside of his bride when he comes in he brings the Millennium with him he brings Eternal peace with him he brings Sabbath rest with him he brings no more curse with him right if there's no more curse there's no more condemnation if the curse is finished and the laws are changed and there is therefore now help me a little bit no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus come on now so if something condemns you it's not Jesus doing that the Holy Spirit Will convict you and when conviction comes it comes with hope that all you have to do is call on him and he'll roll that thing out of your life when condemnation and guilt comes you know it comes from Satan because there's no hope attached to it say what I heard a brother say today it was just one cycle just just one thing after another pulling myself up and out and back down up and out and falling down and up and down that that's what happens when we don't understand what Christ has really come to accomplish in us and brother Branham had to move out of the way in order for the bride to be able to come into the fullness of what was promised to her this doesn't mean we don't need conviction we need more conviction today than we've ever had because the world is creeping in Among Us these sisters around the message sometimes their skirts are getting shorter they're walking around with no sleeves they've got so much jewelry on the men wear their jeans so tight that there's nothing to the imagination if someone wanted to imagine come on they have Christmas trees in every room including the bathroom that's what's happening around the bright Church we're not even talking about denominations we're talking about what's happening in some of our own camps oh my have we ever do we ever need the living Christ The Living Word to step on the scene do we ever need to let brother Branham decrease Christ can increase [Applause] Christ has the Millennium and has everything right here because he is the word now in that powerful and so first the first coming in that shout was the word coming the word coming of Christ I want you to say that the word coming of Christ that was Christ coming in the fullness of the shout in the fullness of the word in the fullness of the message and then number two is the bride coming of Christ that takes place under the voice of the archangel which is Christ it's his voice but it's being echoed by a people a people who have laid their head on his shoulder [Music] a people who have longed to know his heartbeat you see the church out there they think that the heartbeat of God is filling the pew God could care less about your filled pews the denominations around here they'll offer people a big screen TV if they bring the most people to church it's a good thing you brought people to church because we're going to give you something that will take you right into hell if you if you feed on all the filth of that thing but they use that to attract people not to Christ to their Church to their Pew to their organization Christ is not looking for your Pew to be packed he's looking for your life to be packed with the word it's not how much of the word of God you go through no it's how much of God's word goes through you are you eating are you eating the book are you feasting on the Living Word are you hearing the shout we must we're changed when we hear it there's something on the inside the seed of God responds it reacts you that just saw the podcast you'll remember little brother Cleveland who brought me those tapes six cassettes for two sermons the spoken word is the Original Seed he hands them to me in a brown paper bag and my Church of God Deacon says you better stay away from that man he's a good man I worked with him at the fiberglass plant but he believes crazy things about even the rattlesnake said you better stay away from him I noticed that many of you laugh you know my little hole in his mind I was raised in in Holiness and uh I didn't even wear a short sleeve in those days a watch or any of this the light I wanted to please the church in everything and now this man tells me that that this preacher believes something strange About Eve having relationship with a rattlesnake my mind there's no way my mind could have got around that I said that ain't for me that couldn't be for me that sounds like pornography that couldn't be for me you see it's sometimes it's how things are presented I don't mean any harm I'm not much of a Preacher but there's two things that make me want to preach when I hear a preacher who can and when I hear a preacher who can't that's why I like to sing I'm not much of a singer but when I hear people that can and people that can't it makes both of them inspire me to want to sing and when I hear preachers that can't preach I want to preach it really makes me want to preach and I'm going to be completely honest with you when I hear some of the crazy ways people present this truth I am more convinced every day that it's my election because there's no way in the world some people could have ever swam through the mess of preaching to get to the reality of the truth of this message but because that representation was in them they ignored the craziness of the presenter and they starved for a little nugget of Truth [Applause] if you thought we started early so that we could get out early thank you thank you I said well I don't want any of that so I put it up on the top shelf that was first time I boxed it up I actually boxed it up twice but the first time I boxed it up I boxed it up because of how someone presented to me what someone else believed don't do that find out for yourself [Music] do you know why some folks are here tonight we've got a brother who streams every service from Uganda I read his letter to you he sends me a screenshot of every service from Uganda so so I'll know he's on or that I know he's watching the archive and he said I mentioned your name because I remembered you coming you've gone to many years ago and he said they all warned me to stay away and not to follow anything to do after you and he said which made me all the more curious [Music] you see that's the difference between a child of God and religion the religious would say oh my denomination doesn't sanction that preacher remember what TLD and Daisy Osborne sent the Assemblies of God told them not to go here brother random in fact T.L didn't go the first night Daisy found an old woman in the church who said I'm too old to care what they say about me that's what she said she said I'll go with you to hear Brother Branham and were they ever glad that they got to see Jesus on display and so the first time so I put it up there and then things really went awry and in the little church where we were things began to get all messed up and shifting and friends and preachers that I'd preached with for years said we we don't want anything to do with you we hear you're coming into some strange Doctrine and I said I don't even know what that could be I didn't even realize it was somebody had told them that I had the tapes that traveled across that City so fast every preacher in the county knew that that someone had given me brother branham's tapes and I didn't even know what I had I just thought I heard must be some strange ideas if Eve had a fellowship with a rattlesnake I'm I got my head on my desk and I'm I am crying I'm boohoo and I'm sobbing I'm not ashamed to tell you and I said Lord I've been following you all these years and and I'm in a mess I I'm not happy I I I'm miserable and I need an answer from you and that same voice that had spoke to me so many times through the years spoke to my heart and said the answer to all of your problems is in that brown paper bag up on the Shelf I heard that voice I knew that was his voice so I got up and climbed got up in the chair and took that down and I remember unraveling that bag and and I took out the first tape spoken word his Original Seed spoken words original scene spoken word is original C spoke on Words original C six times I said why that man is more long-winded than I am I what I really said was I said he either has one sermon to preach or he's more long-winded than I am that was my attitude aren't you glad God looks over your ignorance sometimes I got an old cassette player down and I put that tape in and I began to hear but remember now I'm I'm listening from a place of a little bit of fear because of what had been said so I heard every haint I heard every not that I was an English scholar but I heard all the murdering of the English language I heard all the stutters sometimes brother Brandon would sound like an engine getting started you know I heard all that I don't hear it now but I heard it that day but it wasn't long until I wasn't listening to brother Brandon anymore it's true it's true that Kentucky English didn't bother me anymore oh excuse me uh some of your neighbors to Kentucky aren't you there Arkansas where they speak the same language now we Alabama People we're refined here oh you're from Kentucky you know the language don't you or did I ever dig deep that time I began to hear everything my heart was longing for amen I didn't hear the I didn't hear the stutters anymore I didn't hear the haints and the Ants and the tizens and the and all that anymore I didn't begin to hear that just faded off in the distance somewhere and I sat right there until I heard it all [Music] a stick of dynamite under my office chair couldn't have moved me when I realized the hour my mother was off work from the bank that day she was living with me in the parsonage of the church that I was pastoring in South Carolina and I ran in and I'll never forget it she was standing at the stove frying okra and I went in and I did something I'd never done before I I hugged her and I spun her around in the kitchen almost like a dance and my mother looked at me she said what in the world is wrong with you anybody know my mama anybody believe she said it just like that Steve no no no Stephen Lamar Shelley what's wrong with you I said oh mother I don't even know how to begin to tell you I have heard the voice of God today speaking through a man she said well isn't that what we hear every time we hear preaching is the voice of God speaking through a man and I said but mother it's like this never a man spake like this man every question I ever had in my heart he was answering as though he was reading my heart remember folks I didn't even know that brother random was dead when I got through listening those tapes I got Brother Cleveland on the phone and said take me to him I don't have to meet him I I don't have to have an audience with him I just would love to shake his hand but I've got to be where he is even if it's just for a few moments and brother Cleveland's laughing in the other end of the phone oh oh he said brother Shelley brother Branham died in 1965. I screamed awesome three years before I was ever born he had already come and gone there came a time in my life that I thanked God on my knees that he took brother Branham before I was born but I couldn't thank him right that moment there was a time later that I said Lord I know what I'd have been I'd have been a brand of mine I just slept on his porch hoping that I could have got a little of that unction on me and so I'm blessed I'm blessed because you took him before I was ever born and I can see what he came to do he came to introduce me to you so don't ever think that we're taking away from the man or the ministry but we must obey what he said and we must understand that he came to forerun the coming word that's not another preacher's Ministry oh no that's Jesus in you that's the hope of glory in you that's Christ form in you little children a travailing verb for you until Christ be formed in you you stand a better chance in this message than anywhere else of Heaven Christ formed in you not because you're sitting under the preaching of the word but you're sitting in the presence of the Living Word and he brings change is anybody with me and so we come to the word coming of Christ and then the bride coming of Christ and there's nothing left then but what we read in Thessalonians the bridegroom coming of Christ when he comes himself to receive a little bride in Revelation chapter 10 we're moving into the to the last phase for for now 10 10. and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up you better be eating this book it was once a sealed book can I show you all something can you pull that down and put up something else can you put up Daniel 12 4. in King James and then in the Amplified but thou old Daniel just watch this for a moment I'm all over the place that's what happens when I try to review and move on to something else but thou old Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end you're still with me many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased how's that possible with a shut book with a sealed book well Revelation 5 tells us how that book that was once sealed is no longer sealed not because brother Branham took the book and Lucia seals are of because the lamb took the book and lucifield Jesus Christ took the book and Luther seals her up and gave the revelation of what was underneath those seals by symbol first to his servant brother Branham who was the voice of the seventh angel there's no doubt about it I heard this so this verse for so many years in such a negative way the book is sealed people are going to run to and fro they're going to get all all spark smart with head knowledge and and this is going to be a terrible time in the end I began to look at that in Hebrew and I'm not a scholar people send me things all the time wanting me to interpret Hebrew letters and I have to Google it just like you do but I have studied the language the ancient Biblical Hebrew quite a bit I wished I could retain more I wished I would have taken the time to learn more but I know how to get a hold of the tools and I know how to use the tools that we have available in this hour and that helps me so much so I decided one day many years ago I would take Daniel 12 and 4 and I would take it to to the original language and I would see what it said and then I found a version that actually captured the original of Daniel 12 4 the Amplified and I want to read it to you and I want to want you to see that it it reached entirely different because this is based on the original language it says but you owe Daniel shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end then many shall run to and fro and search anxiously come on well I thought the book was sealed you see somehow God let Daniel know you seal it up because one day I'm going to send one that's going to be there when the book is opened and this now he's describing the end times then many shall run to and fro and search anxiously through the book and the knowledge of God's purposes as revealed by His prophets shall be increased and become great now that's what come out of looking at the originals at first I broke it down myself using each word that actually appears in the Hebrew language and then after reading it I said well this is saying something quite different than what I'm picking up from King James so I began to search through 30 plus versions to find one that expressed most closely what was being said in the original language and you know what I believe our day is being spoken of right there I believe there are people in this room right now that are the Fulfillment of what was being spoken of in Daniel chapter 12 4. the book is no longer sealed and we are now a people searching anxiously through that open book and because of that our knowledge of the purposes of God is increasing we are understanding who he is and who we are because of who he is the greatest mystery that's ever been revealed the mystery of God the mystery notice Revelation 10 7 is not plural it's not the Mysteries this is how brother Branham often quoted it but he tells us to take what he says back to the word so we go back to Revelation 10 7 and it doesn't say and the Mystery should be finished it says what and the Mystery so I looked at that in the original language and it's a singular word it's not a plural word it's a singular word and so we go searching what is the mystery that is supposed to be finished when the seventh angel begins to sound his voice in Revelation 10 7 and guess where the answers found in the message of the hour uh because brother Branham comes and tells us two things he tells us that the most important revelation is that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament now somebody said that doesn't seem so profound I guess it does if you've been in a trinitarian church all your life I've had trinitarian Pentecostal tell me well that's what I believe I said well you may believe that but that's not what your church teaches your church doesn't teach that Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new your church teaches that Jesus is the second person of the trinity the second person of the godhead and the reality is Jesus is the only person of the godhead the eternal spirit of the father is there which also overshadowed Mary and she conceived our Lord but there's only one person in that godhead and that is Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testament is indeed Jesus Christ of the New Testament so we take that as part of the mystery and then we hear this amazing message in fact I'm not sure but I think that's the message where brother Branham tells us we've come to the end of the second pool I may be wrong but I think it's in this message that brother Branham says that we have come to the end of the second pool the third pull is is at hand yes in this glorious message if you've not heard it I challenge you if you have heard it I challenge you to hear it again if you heard it yesterday I challenge you to listen to it again Christ is the mystery the mystery of God revealed this is the greatest mystery to know that Christ is the mystery of God revealed we didn't know that until God sent a prophet we didn't fully understand the Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus of the new anybody with me here am I pr am I preaching some false Doctrine here have I fallen off the wagon here and didn't know it but here's the greatest part it just keeps growing if Christ is the mystery of God revealed who is the mystery of Christ revealed who did Brother Branham say I'm I'm forerunning he said I'm for running the coming word so if if Christ is the mystery of God reveal the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed oh yes if Christ is God manifested in the Earth then who is the bride to be Jesus Christ The Living Word manifested in the earth same signs same wonders say miracles he even dealt a speaking in tongues amen which by the way is not a curse word Pentecost is not a swear word speaking in tongues is not a curse word I'm with Paul he said I speak in tongues more than you all to have a little Joy with his when you when you don't know how to pray when you know not how to pray as you should he the spirit doesn't make intercession for you you're never going to let me go let me let this go right out on the stream you're never going to talk us out of tongues you're never ever ever ever ever ever ever going to talk us out of that because we understand that it's for our day how many Church ages are there you're sure there's not eight are we still then somewhat in laodicea the bride is living a course in that little app over period we could call it the beginning of the bright age but isn't the church world out there still caught in laodicea there's no eighth messenger there's no eighth Church age wasn't the laodicean church age about the restoration of Pentecost wasn't it about the restoration of the gifts somebody said yes but didn't brother Brandon say when that which is perfect is coming the perfect is the word he said it but you know what else he said he said when that which is perfect is come his perfect love come on now I hear the word but I'm looking for the perfect love I'm still looking for it I see it when I look at Christ but when I look at my own life I still recognize at times and my love is prejudiced it's still easier for me to love someone whom I feel loves me you caught my work didn't you it's still easier at times to love to really love to deeply love when you know that someone loves you in return that's not perfect love I want to have such an outpouring a birth into the virtues of perfect love sister West you're sitting here would you hold up your hand her father-in-law brother Arnon West passed away and brother Billy Paul Branham came with brother borders is that right to the funeral brother Roy borders who was the founder of the spoken word that has become the voice of God and brother Billy Paul Branham the oldest son of brother Branham came to the funeral and he's speaking to them on the porches he's about to leave will you correct me if I say something wrong and he's emotional brother Billy Paul he's the most humble man that you could ever meet and when you hear people say about brother Branham that he had a gift of making you feel like you were the important one I never experienced that but I experienced that in brother Billy Paul brother Billy Paul said to me there in the Netherlands I met him at the at the southern gospel don't let me forget what I'm telling about sister West I met brother Billy Paul in Louisville Kentucky at the southern gospel singing convention they I kept running into Believers there and they kept saying to me brother Billy Paul is here brother Billy Paul is here brother Billy Paul's here and finally I ran into one who was a DJ of a radio station he said brother Billy Paul is here and he wants to meet you I said hi I don't know why brother Billy Paul want to meet me but I really want to meet him and he said well he said for me to bring you up to where they are and he's sitting up on the mezzanine and he and sister Lois are there and he'll bring her out my mom was with me and some other folks and we went up to to meet brother Billy Paul and I had an album in my hand a brother of the happy Goodman family that's where I practiced my high tenor parts I could see the excruciating look on some of your faces when I was hitting those tenor notes and I had that album there and that was when Vestal had all that hair on her head that wasn't all real but some of it was hers and I know that because I knew them and I had that old album they were selling old LP albums and I didn't even have a way to play it but I wanted it and I'm holding it there and brother Billy Paul comes out with sister Lois and introduces us and he said oh brother Shelley I've been listening to your singing tape and he said I enjoyed it so much he said they ought to have you up there singing instead of some of these boy I really went almost went through the floor he said them folks right there they sung at the Tabernacle I said the happy Goodman family sang at the Branham Tabernacle he said they sure did twice and I can remember and he said brother Branham he said they cut that off the tape but he said brother Branham comes to the pulpit and he says now that was real gospel singing that made me feel so good because I had come to believe from message people that music had to be mournful it's got to be a hundred years old anything after Fanny Crosby couldn't be anointed come on now and if we hadn't been singing it since the 50s the anointing couldn't possibly be on it I've sat through services like some of you where there wasn't you couldn't clap there was nothing sung fast enough to clap you're waiting for the beat and you realize there really is no beat he said oh yes Dad loved that kind of singing he really loved that kind of singing and I noticed as I continued to talk to brother Billy Paul that I began to feel like he was honored to be talking to me he said you know I want to thank you for the cassettes that you sent me he said I ordered them and you would let me pay for them and he said I gave them to the whole family at Christmas and he said they all they all have listened he said you know what my favorite song on that on your tape is I said I'm thinking to myself what would it be maybe it would be they're mending it again or the eagle you know something real messagy what did he say he said oh my favorite song on your album is the Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing [Music] you can learn a lot can't you but I noticed as we went to leave his his uh uh eyes teared up and he was sad I said brother Billy Paul you've paid good money for these good tickets and we we need to go on and get out of the way and let you all enjoy the good singing in there and and it was hard to leave I wanted to leave because I wanted to leave him alone but he didn't want us to leave and I walked away and my mother said I've never felt more like a celebrity in all my life she said did you realize he treated us like we were stars and he was just an ordinary man which he was of course an ordinary man he said you pray for me don't you I said yes sir I pray for you often he said please don't forget to pray for me always I ran into him many years later in at the opening of the voice of God headquarters in the Netherlands I'd never met Brother Joseph it's a different experience than meeting brother Billy Paul and I'd never met Brother Joseph and we go into this place and I'm the odd bird as we got out of the car I could hear the people whispering that Shelly that's Shelly hey did you see Shelley what's he doing here well you know that don't really make you feel welcome does it but I just decided I had every right to be there if they did I just raised up my head and walked right in too we got in there and they were all crowded around brother Billy Paul all wanted to talk to him I'm telling this for some of these visitors that haven't heard it and uh they were all wanting to talk to him and I I just come in and I started trying to find a place to stand because it was very crowded in there a few people were with me your Daniel was with me sister Beverly and several others and all of a sudden brother Billy Paul not a real tall fella but he saw me through the crowd I'll never forget this it meant so much to me he said oh right over the Roaring of that crowd he said oh brother Shelley it's so good to see you he said come over here brother I want to hug your neck the crowd parted it was like the Red Sea and I walked in he grabbed me and give me the best bear hug and then I heard him say Well that's brother she isn't it amazing an hour before out there getting in trying to get in the building it was there Shelly what's he doing here but all of a sudden brother Billy Paul was glad to see me that's brother well he's from Alabama yeah yeah I've heard of him and he got real loud he got so loud that everybody in the room could hear what he was saying and he said I've been waiting on a chance to thank you brother shall for how you pray for me every day he said you know I was down in South America he told me the country I don't remember now he said I went out I ought not to done it but he said I went out before dinner and I was going to get a battery or something and he said they mugged me shot me with a stun gun and stole my watch he said and I nearly died he said laying there on that ground I nearly died before anybody even knew I was missing he said whatever that shock was it affected the rhythm of my heart and I could not get it to come back and he said the thought came to my mind I bet now he didn't mean bet I bet brother Shelley's praying for me he said just like that he's saying this loud and people are going oh I bet brother Shelley's praying for me and about that time one of his handlers said brother Billy Paul we've got to go brother Billy Paul we've got to go we got to go and there's people waiting on you there's people that have appointments for you he said oh no they can wait he said tell them they can wait he said I've promised brother Shelley years ago I would introduce him to Brother Joseph and he said that's exactly what I'm going to do now that's the kind of humble heart that brother Billy Paul had he's standing on the porch was it uh was it brother brother and sister West's home was it the place I visited one time on the highway or did they live somewhere else same place and he said oh I want to tell you something I wished I could tell you something is that right I really wished I could tell you something but he said I I promised daddy that I wouldn't tell it but he said it has to do with perfect love and that moment he was talking about being together again one day that's what inspired him losing brother Arnon West being together one day and then he said oh I I wished I could tell you something but I promised Daddy I wouldn't but it's it has to do did I leave anything out just remember perfect love well we know what perfect love somebody said what is it it's Jesus it's father forgive them for they know not what they do it's love without prejudice it's loving someone who is unlovable it's loving someone who plucks out your beard it's loving somebody who despitefully uses you and it's not that old phony love I love you anyway anybody ever had you that I love you all right but I'd sure like to fix you that's not love that's religion and when I realized when I I have had let me say this I don't know why I'm even doing this tonight but I realize that there have been times that he filled my heart he flooded my heart with a perfect love I remember a few times that he flooded my heart with pure compassion and I saw past the makeup in the bobbed hair and the ear bobs and I saw a woman in pain a woman who had bitterly opposed our ministry in Jerusalem but I didn't see her anymore in that moment it was him it wasn't me it wasn't me it was not me all of a sudden I saw her pain it was more than just a look on her face I saw I felt pain for her pain and love for her that she had never returned she had never shown me any love but all of a sudden I was overwhelmed with the perfect compassion and a perfect love and I thought to myself I must never step out of this I must never lose this but life is tough and circumstances are hard and Moses knew what to do he knew God said the word is in your mouth speak to it but he struck it anyway and I recognized so many times I've I've asked the Lord I don't believe it's something you can manufacture I've asked the Lord I want to love people like you love them and he's tested me a few times you heard me tell about going through some of my stuff and finding a gift that someone had given me that had later tried to destroy my life and I picked that gift up and I walked over to the trash can and I tossed it in and I thanked God to be rid of those people in my life thank God I don't have to deal with him anymore and he got me he said now you will go back and you'll take that out of the trash can and I went over there and I picked it up out of the trash can and if I would have dropped something I cared about it would have smashed to a thousand pieces but this thing was perfectly intact even though I had a little righteous indignation when I threw it away it was just perfect and I said Lord what must I do with this I don't even like it and all of a sudden it was like a movie on in my head I remembered how much I liked it when it was given to me now why didn't I like it now because I was prejudiced prejudiced anybody hear me I said what must I do with it I'm sure I can find a box for it after all it came out of a box I'm sure I can find a box for it and the Lord said um you will place it in a predominant spot on your desk and you will look at it every day until you can pray for them like I would pray for them wasn't easy there were times I would look at it and I'd go right down on my knees with a burden for those people there were times I looked at it and I thought hmm I have church people who love me that need my prayers those people would never think of me praying for them why should I pray for them they'll never even think of me praying for why should I waste my time praying for them and the Lord would take you right it was like you started over okay you must really like looking at it I remember the day I remember what I had on I remember what I had for lunch the day I walked into my office and I saw that there and my compassion and my love for them was beyond me I fell down on my knees and I prayed and when I got through praying the Lord said now I had you to pray for them because nobody else was I know this I know what it means to struggle with prejudice you see my problem is not racial that's not the kind of prejudice I'm talking about I'm talking about remembering or wrong until we can have that kind of birth explosion perfect love filling us we can pray for one another without prejudice look folks uh uh get him Lord is not a qualified prayer it's the one who just how to draw it's up to you and I to let him fill our hearts with that perfect love I truly believe as brother Branham has told us it's going to take that perfect love to make the rapture so the word has come and the Word was perfect but I have the quotes where brother Brandon said that which is perfect it's perfect love and I don't believe that that perfect love is predominant in our life I know it's not let me just judge me it's not predominant in my life and I I've got to have it when you hear me cry out we've got to have you we do we've got to have him we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have a hymn we've got to have the attributes we're being birthed from one virtue to an a it's not easy I mean excuse me it's not difficult to love somebody who loves you back you're not being tested to love somebody who's good to you the test is being able to love someone who despitefully uses you and wants to see you destroyed and yet you can pray for them because you see them as a soul that needs to come home to Christ let's have the musicians to come boy it's late it's the word coming of Christ it's the living Christ The Living Word coming into his bride it's we must take the book John typed the bride John had to take the book and chew it up you and I must eat this Living Word we eat the Living Word by by eating how it is identified it's identified in the message of the hour it's identified in the written record of God's word we've got to hide ourselves in the Bible we've got to hide ourselves in the tapes and the sermons in the messages not just our favorite preacher we've got to get in that so that everything promised there can be birthed and formed in US then we can say okay we don't need gifts anymore we don't need tongues anymore of course that's the rapture but until then that press play and Obey people who don't think we need the fivefold ministry the Bible says we do the Bible says we're going to need them until we all come to the unity of the faith until we all come to that stature of a perfect man we're going to need the fivefold ministry if every preacher preached just a light we'd never have any Perfection going on Among Us it takes every you can't bottle your ministry after somebody else's Ministry they tried they petted me on the head 30 years ago can I pet you on top of your head embedded me on top of my head 30 years ago and said he'll come down he's new to the message he's new to it now but he'll calm down why would you want to calm down I've seen what death produces more death I've seen what lifeless religion produces why would you want any more of that we've got to have more of him [Applause] there's a man in here to this evening who was testifying I'm not going to identify him but he was testifying to me today about all the times the enemy had tried to destroy him destroying his mind and how religion had failed him legalism and Rule keeping had failed him and how he finally had that birth experience if for no other reason you and I have to keep pressing in so that we can find someone else like that brother who still held in a bondage somewhere who doesn't know what it means to be free and to be totally delivered this bride has to manifest Jesus because there are more people out there who don't know the freedom that the word can produce in our life and they're not going to know it until we produce it we can't just talk about it we've got to go in that tent and come out like him am I telling you the truth this evening let's stand I I uh I think I apologize I think I do Lord I'm hungry for you Jesus we are so hungry for you when we think we know so much we know so little if somebody would have told me 30 years ago I'd still be struggling to laugh I would have never been able to believe it yet here we are somebody right now in this house is thinking how can that man be so transparent because that is the only way to grow we have to be honest and transparent with one another we're fighting the same great battle Lord we're so ready to win this mind battle in Christ we're so ready to manifest every virtue and to operate in that perfect love so that when we recognize who we are we can speak and that creative spoken word comes out of our mouth and missing limbs are restored as your Prophet told us this bride's Revival would produce the restoration of missing limbs he also told us that it would produce ananiasis and sapphiras because in that day you the you would not tolerate lying to the Holy Ghost as fearful as that may seem we'd rather have that full manifestation of who you are among us than to continue to play Church Lord we don't want to be found playing Church you didn't deliver us out of denominations to die on the vine to go through the motions And the emotions and miss the mark so we as a body are crying out to you tonight to come and fill us with who you are we confess before you our weaknesses and our failures and our slacknesses and where we need to measure up and we do it without any condemnation because we know that we're not qualifying ourselves it's you who justifies it's you who qualifies us so we can just pour out our heart we can just tell you what's going on in our lives knowing that you are not there to condemn rather you convict us and fill us with such hope that this bride her greatest days are not behind us as some predict but are ahead of us as we become so desperate and so hungry to Manifest this Living Word Isha or abandon foreign Spirit of the Living God we want you Jesus we want you Jesus we want you Jesus now about this time we would normally have some worship here and we will in just a few moments but I want to ask you if you're here in the time we have left together if you're here and any of this has spoken to your heart if you are able to to relate to it and your heart is somehow crying out for what we're talking about here I want you to come and join me and stand if you must kneel you can you're free to but we'll have more room if you come and stand sisters here brothers are here I would just like for us to come just like we are no no just as I am music to get us down here just to desire to meet him in a more profound way what I'm looking at tonight is the cream of the crop you may not feel like the cream of the crop but you're the chosen of the Lord come in close come in close you're the chosen of the Lord he knows you better than anybody could ever possibly know you and he loves you so much he knows your strengths and he knows your weaknesses he knows your shortcomings and he knows those places where you measure up and he just loves you he just loves you won't you surrender everything to him if there's any place in your life you just play softly now if there's any place in your life that you have yet to surrender to him would you consider doing that tonight we'll have a very different service in the morning if we lighten our load tonight if there's something you need to roll off on him his shoulder is strong enough to carry it his right arm is powerful enough to hold whatever you're tired of whatever you're weary of and you would like to just roll it over on the Lord he's here do you know he's here do you know he's here he's here because you brought him with you you brought him with you when you came we know he's here there's such a peace that desires to settle down over this place right now as we just recommit our life to him we just recommit we just say All of Me Jesus take all of me I don't want to hone anything back in this late hour I want to give everything to you I want to make lots of room in my life for you to come and fill it I don't want it filled with the world oh I don't want it filled with the filth of this whole life I want every empty place in me to be filled with more of you put your finger Lord on any place
