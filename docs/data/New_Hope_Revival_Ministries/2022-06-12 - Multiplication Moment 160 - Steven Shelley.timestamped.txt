[0:00] has 120 jesus to stumble out of the
[0:02] upper room filled with the same life
[0:05] that jesus had on there come on
[0:11] [Music]
[0:14] the gospels have come to an end and the
[0:17] earthly ministry of our lord has come to
[0:20] an end in his own personal body do you
[0:22] understand that and now the ministry of
[0:25] jesus is about to multiply
[0:28] amen
[0:29] it's about to explode it's about to
[0:32] explode
[0:33] because instead of one jesus
[0:38] look out preacher
[0:40] that old devil standing over there in
[0:42] the graveyard he's jumping around and
[0:44] carrying on
[0:46] he thinks he's defeated the son of god
[0:49] he's knocked him out for the last count
[0:52] three days and three nights he's guarded
[0:55] the tomb jumping up and down having
[0:57] himself a party
[0:59] because he feels like he has defeated
[1:01] the gospel
[1:04] even the mother of jesus is weeping
[1:07] the disciples who loved him the most
[1:09] they're discouraged
[1:10] they're all hiding out in the house over
[1:12] there somewhere
[1:14] afraid of going to jail
[1:16] there's not much victory in the church
[1:18] at that time
[1:20] everybody's down in the mouth
[1:22] except the enemy he is dancing with glee
[1:25] i've stopped this thing
[1:27] come on i couldn't stop the seed
[1:29] [Music]
[1:31] couldn't stop him from coming
[1:33] couldn't stop him from living couldn't
[1:35] stop him from dying
[1:38] but i can hold him here
[1:40] because i alone have power over the
[1:42] grave
[1:43] and death is in my hand the old enemy
[1:45] thought and he is having himself a time
[1:48] but what he doesn't know
[1:50] [Music]
[1:52] is that before jesus left his earthly
[1:54] body left left his earthly ministry he
[1:57] said to them you better get up to
[1:58] jerusalem now
[2:00] because there's going to be an infusion
[2:02] of power that's going to come from on
[2:05] high and you're going to have to have
[2:06] that to stand
[2:09] so whatever you do don't miss your
[2:10] appointment with me in jerusalem
[2:13] get there and wait on the promise of the
[2:16] father this was a time that 120 had
[2:19] gathered in the upper room and they were
[2:22] in one mind and one accord and their
[2:25] desire was to receive the promise of the
[2:28] father got to have him got to have him
[2:31] got to have him can't leave without him
[2:33] going to stay here till he comes and
[2:36] that's exactly what happened on the day
[2:37] of pentecost jesus came to his church
[2:40] no wonder they call it the birth of the
[2:42] church
[2:44] no wonder they call it the beginning of
[2:46] the church
[2:47] because jesus came to his own house
[2:50] and he filled a hundred and twenty with
[2:53] the same life that he carried on the
[2:56] earth while he walked among being
[2:58] hallelujah and no wonder the enemy said
[3:00] one two
[3:02] three jesus four jesuses five six seven
[3:05] eight nine fifty seventy five jesus's
[3:09] what will i do a hundred oh
[3:11] hundred and ten
[3:15] he's about to lose his mind as 120
[3:19] stumble out
[3:20] [Music]
[3:23] has 120 jesus to stumble out of the
[3:25] upper room filled with the same life
[3:28] that jesus had on there come on
[3:31] deliverance that we need
[3:34] is found in that anointing
[3:37] it's found in that presence
[3:39] don't you settle for a dry dusty
[3:42] experience with god you get one that has
[3:45] life in it
