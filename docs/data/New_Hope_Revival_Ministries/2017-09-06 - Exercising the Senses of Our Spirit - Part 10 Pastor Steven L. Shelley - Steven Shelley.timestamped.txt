[1:29] an encouragement to our ministry to know

[1:35] thank God for gospel channel and I thank
[1:38] God for Angel TV and I thank God that
[1:41] he's using the internet that we can
[1:43] stream and podcast and all this stuff
[1:46] that I don't even understand the
[1:48] technology of how it all works but I
[1:50] thank God that we can redeem it and use
[1:53] it for spreading the good truth of God's
[1:56] kingdom I want to get right into the
[1:59] study we're talking about exercising the
[2:02] census of our spirit it's been a long
[2:04] study so far week after week we've been
[2:07] looking at these scriptures I pray that
[2:09] you're not growing weary of the subject
[2:11] but that you're as excited about it as I
[2:14] am because I believe it's an invitation
[2:16] it's really an invitation it's not just
[2:19] information it's an invitation to come
[2:22] and walk in a higher place in the Lord
[2:26] Jesus Christ so let's look right to
[2:28] God's Word together okay in second
[2:30] Corinthians today in chapter 4 2nd
[2:35] Corinthians chapter 4 I have a problem
[2:39] some time knowing where to start because
[2:42] I pick out a verse that goes with what
[2:45] the Lord is speaking and then I read the
[2:48] one above it and the one below
[2:50] and I like them all and so I'm going to
[2:53] start in verse 11 second Corinthians
[2:56] chapter 4 verse 11 says for we which
[3:00] live are all wadded up to death for
[3:04] Jesus sake that the life also listen to
[3:08] this that the life also of Jesus the
[3:13] life of Jesus might be made manifest in
[3:18] our mortal flesh now that is a powerful
[3:21] promise so then death worketh in US but
[3:25] life in you we having the same spirit of
[3:30] faith according as it is written I
[3:33] believed and therefore have I spoken we
[3:36] also believe and therefore speak knowing
[3:39] that he which raised up the Lord Jesus
[3:42] shall raise us up also by Jesus and
[3:46] shall present us with you for all things
[3:50] are for your sakes that the abundant
[3:52] grace might through the Thanksgiving of
[3:54] many redound to the glory of God for
[3:59] which cause we faint not but though our
[4:03] outward man perish verse 16 yet the
[4:07] inward man somebody say the inward man
[4:10] the inward man is renewed day by day
[4:17] this renewing of the inner man is what
[4:21] we're teaching about the exercising of
[4:24] the senses of our spirit renewing the
[4:28] inner man inward man or inner man day by
[4:34] day for our light affliction those
[4:38] things that we suffer which is but for a
[4:41] moment all of the hardships and trials
[4:44] of life worketh for us a far more
[4:49] exceeding and eternal weight of glory I
[4:53] love that promise all the stuff that we
[4:57] go through in our life is temporal it
[5:01] may feel eternal that situation that's
[5:04] set of circumstances that you're going
[5:06] through right now it may feel eternal
[5:08] but its temporal and it is working in
[5:11] you and for you a far more exceeding and
[5:17] eternal weight of glory in simple terms
[5:20] one of these days I don't care how dark
[5:23] that trial is right now how forsaken
[5:26] have forgotten how rejected you feel how
[5:29] depressed or discouraged you are at the
[5:31] moment there will come a time because of
[5:34] the promise of Jesus Christ that you
[5:36] will be able to exclaim it was worth it
[5:40] all every heartache it was worth it all
[5:43] every trial it was worth it all because
[5:46] there is being worked in you a far more
[5:51] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[5:55] verse 18 says while we look not at the
[5:59] things which are seen that's the earthly
[6:02] realm but after things which are not
[6:05] seen that's the spiritual realm the
[6:09] heavenly realm for the things which are
[6:11] seen are temporal temporary but the
[6:17] things which are not seen are eternal
[6:21] you know this really teaches me
[6:25] something because the enemy what does he
[6:28] do he wants us always focusing on what
[6:32] we're going through right now what we're
[6:36] experiencing right now he wants us to
[6:38] get our eyes on that he wants to
[6:40] distract us with the temporary so that
[6:45] we miss focusing on that which is
[6:49] weighty that which is eternal that with
[6:52] just changing us from glory to glory so
[6:56] we've got to do something about it we've
[6:59] got to get ahold of ourselves so to
[7:02] speak wake up and we have got to say to
[7:07] the enemy I'm not going to focus on that
[7:12] which is temporal that which is
[7:14] temporary I'm going to keep my eyes
[7:17] on the Lord Jesus Christ now we were
[7:21] talking about how to nourish how to care
[7:25] for the spirit man we talked about
[7:28] cleansing we have to cleanse and bathe
[7:31] this physical body and also the spirit
[7:36] man the inner man has to be cleansed how
[7:40] is the inner man cleansed well the
[7:43] outward man is cleansed with soap and
[7:45] water the inward man is sanctified or
[7:49] cleansed by the washing of the water of
[7:53] the word by the revelation of god's word
[7:57] the Holy Spirit taking the word and
[8:01] applying it to those places of our
[8:05] spirit man that need attention that's
[8:08] what revelation is it's the Holy Spirit
[8:11] taking the word and applying it and
[8:14] causing it to activate in those areas of
[8:19] our spiritual life where we need
[8:22] attention in that grace isn't that the
[8:25] love of God isn't that the grace of God
[8:27] have you ever been sitting in a service
[8:30] somewhere and the preachers preaching
[8:31] away and all of a sudden it's like his
[8:33] sermon changes and he starts speaking
[8:35] right into your problem right into your
[8:38] situation right into your trial what's
[8:40] what's going on here that's the Holy
[8:42] Spirit that's the grace of God
[8:45] ministering by the spirit the word that
[8:48] you need at that particular moment
[8:52] that's why the gifts of the Spirit are
[8:54] so important because God uses the gifts
[8:57] of the Spirit to deliver to us the Rhema
[9:00] the Living Word of God present the
[9:03] present word what we need in our present
[9:06] set of circumstances well then we have
[9:09] to also nourish this physical body by
[9:12] eating that's how we went off the air
[9:13] last time talking about eating the right
[9:16] things and a lot of research says that
[9:20] we are physically ill because we eat
[9:22] dead food we eat processed food that is
[9:27] very dead nutrition
[9:29] this no nutrition no nutritional value
[9:33] processed highly highly processed in a
[9:36] factory and this is not you know I mean
[9:40] I'm not going to tell you that we don't
[9:42] like some of these things I have four
[9:43] children and and and they're prone to
[9:46] want them and we have to eat them in
[9:49] moderation I mean for instance something
[9:51] like what we call macaroni and cheese
[9:53] you know it is highly processed food
[9:57] noodles are processed and so forth Adam
[9:59] and Eve didn't eat macaroni and cheese
[10:01] in the garden it wasn't living food they
[10:04] were eating that which God gave them
[10:05] from the ground and the body does
[10:08] there's a high level of inflammation in
[10:11] the human body today because of some of
[10:14] these things so as we try to choose
[10:16] carefully what we eat to nourish the
[10:21] natural body we've got to be very
[10:22] careful as Eagles what we eat to nourish
[10:27] the spiritual man we have to be careful
[10:31] where we feed and a lot of people get
[10:33] their their nutritional value for the
[10:36] inner man by what they see on television
[10:38] and everything on television is not
[10:41] beneficial for the inner spirit man so
[10:45] we need to be discerning and we need to
[10:48] be careful and we need to be disciplined
[10:50] because God wants us to be fully alive
[10:55] in our spirit man he wants us to be able
[10:59] to have all of the senses of our spirit
[11:02] man fully exercised fully functional
[11:07] fully operational so that we cannot walk
[11:10] after the flesh or after the will of the
[11:13] soul but after the will of our spirit
[11:18] that has been renewed regenerated by the
[11:23] Holy Spirit of God interesting isn't it
[11:26] and then for the physical body they also
[11:29] tell us the importance of rest rest God
[11:33] instituted rest in the Sabbath this is
[11:38] why he taught why he arrested himself
[11:42] the Bible tells us
[11:43] in the Torah in the first books of the
[11:46] Bible he rested and he instituted a day
[11:50] of rest now Jesus the Messiah is our
[11:54] Sabbath he is our rest so we're not
[11:57] talking merely about keeping a day but
[12:00] we're talking about being wise and
[12:02] resting the body having an adequate
[12:05] proper amount of sleep it's a good thing
[12:09] for the physical body so is resting in
[12:13] the glory in the spirit of the lord
[12:15] worshiping God waiting on the Lord in
[12:20] worship in moments of consecration and
[12:24] dedication pulling yourself away I know
[12:27] it's easier said than done pulling
[12:30] yourself away from the hustle and the
[12:33] bustle of everyday life even if it's ten
[12:36] minutes in a closet with God I believe
[12:40] it's one of the ways that we're going to
[12:42] be launched into living life out of the
[12:45] spirit instead of out of the flesh of
[12:47] the soul by soaking in the presence of
[12:51] God gets some good worship music sing
[12:53] along with it lift your hands before the
[12:55] Lord weep in his presence just be still
[12:59] be still be quiet we need to spend
[13:04] quality time doing nothing before the
[13:07] Lord religion says do do do do do you've
[13:12] got to do you've got to work you've got
[13:13] to become you've got the you know you've
[13:15] got to be busy changing yourself but the
[13:19] truth of the matter is it's not within
[13:22] our power to change ourselves it's only
[13:26] as we yield to the Holy Spirit we give
[13:30] our will to God and we say Lord let your
[13:32] will be done your kingdom come as we
[13:35] spoke about in an earlier broadcast
[13:37] quality time time as we have taught of
[13:41] intimacy in the Hoopa where it's just
[13:43] you and Jesus just you and your lover
[13:46] you and your Messiah a good place to
[13:50] start when you're reading looking for
[13:52] scriptures to read in your
[13:54] own time is read some of the Psalms
[13:57] their worshipful their the pouring out
[14:02] of David's heart before God and when you
[14:07] read them read them from you as a love
[14:11] letter to the Lord from you this is so
[14:14] important it may sound so simple it's
[14:17] too simple it's too simple to work
[14:19] oftentimes we make things so complicated
[14:22] that when we do reflect in simple
[14:27] moments with simple methods we touch God
[14:30] I believe it's very very important this
[14:32] soaking in the presence of the Lord
[14:34] worshiping drawing oneself away for a
[14:38] season of refreshing my David did it
[14:43] remember we just talked about that but
[14:44] but I'm coming to the thought of of the
[14:48] 23rd psalm he leadeth me beside the
[14:51] still waters he restoreth my soul this
[14:59] is how God wants to operate for us and
[15:03] we have to make the effort some time to
[15:06] do nothing not an effort to do something
[15:09] an effort to do nothing isn't that
[15:11] amazing that it's harder for us as
[15:13] believers to do nothing than it is to do
[15:16] something that's because of the way
[15:18] we've been programmed by religion
[15:20] religion has programmed us we've got to
[15:22] do more do more read more pray more
[15:24] study more work harder invite more
[15:27] people to church oh that's good I'm not
[15:30] against any of that but God's really
[15:33] after your heart he's more after your
[15:36] heart than he is your works and the only
[15:39] way that your works honor God is when
[15:43] they your works become the overflow of
[15:48] your affection toward god that's worship
[15:52] that way everything you do becomes
[15:56] worship because it flows out of a heart
[15:59] a spirit man that has been transformed
[16:03] wow this is what God's after he's after
[16:06] you remember the little story I've told
[16:07] you before about the American Indian
[16:10] many years ago who heard the missionary
[16:12] preach and he wanted to serve God and so
[16:16] he went into the into the brush Arbor
[16:18] where the meeting was going on and he
[16:20] lay his blanket on the altar and Lord
[16:24] here take my blanket i'm bringing you a
[16:26] gift and there was no word and and he
[16:28] said well I i guess i could give you my
[16:30] horse he goes out leads his horse in
[16:32] ties it to the altar and he says oh lord
[16:35] here's my horse i want to give you my
[16:37] horse and here's nothing from the lord
[16:39] and then he tests well i'll go take down
[16:41] my tipi you know these these TP triangle
[16:45] looking things that that the Native
[16:47] American people lived in at one time he
[16:50] takes that down and poles and skins and
[16:53] all and comes and lays that in in in
[16:55] what is like a church the brush Arbor
[16:57] and he says okay Lord here's my tepee
[17:00] but here's nothing from God he in
[17:01] exasperation he just can't go on anymore
[17:04] he just crawls up on top of the prayer
[17:06] altar and he lays down and he says okay
[17:08] Lord I've given you my blanket and you
[17:11] say nothing and I've given you my horse
[17:12] and you say nothing and I've given you
[17:15] my tepee and there's nothing left so
[17:17] I'll just lay here Lord and I'll just
[17:19] give you me because that's all I have
[17:21] left and he hears in his spirit of voice
[17:23] it says that's what I was after all the
[17:26] time and I want to tell you something
[17:28] that may seem you know just ridiculously
[17:31] silly to you but it's God's heart he
[17:34] wants you he's after you and when you
[17:40] make that full surrender to Him you come
[17:42] into that place of union and intimacy
[17:45] with him then what you do honors God
[17:48] that's a way to change your behavior
[17:50] change your life is to take those
[17:53] moments of reflection in the spirit with
[17:55] him because we've been trained to look
[17:59] at the things that we can see with the
[18:00] natural eye and now we're asking the
[18:03] Lord to bring us into a new training
[18:04] that we can also begin to see that which
[18:07] is beyond the veil open our spiritual
[18:10] eyes anoint our eyes with eye salve Oh
[18:14] father
[18:15] help us to see beyond that which is
[18:18] temporal that which is natural you see a
[18:20] natural person one who has been not been
[18:23] redeemed unredeemed we would say that
[18:26] person can only relate to the earthly
[18:29] realm I said a few programs ago that's
[18:31] why people are so caught up in the New
[18:33] Age and witchcraft and all kinds of
[18:36] mysticism and eastern religions and so
[18:38] forth because people are looking for
[18:40] inner peace but they're not able to find
[18:43] it because their connection is only with
[18:47] the earthly realm because their spirit
[18:49] man is dead when you come to Jesus
[18:52] Christ and you're born again hear me
[18:54] you're born again of His Holy Spirit
[18:56] your spirit man comes alive and that's
[19:00] how we have access to the heavenly realm
[19:04] to the spiritual realm the world is
[19:07] looking for a counterfeit what they
[19:08] don't know they're looking for a
[19:09] counterfeit they're looking for the real
[19:11] thing but they're finding some
[19:12] satisfaction some satisfaction in the
[19:15] counterfeit why would you settle for the
[19:19] counterfeit witchcraft and the New Age
[19:22] and a lot of this kind of stuff is just
[19:24] a counterfeit of the real it's like what
[19:27] Janice and jam breeze offered and the
[19:29] magician's of Moses it's just the
[19:32] counterfeit why would you settle for
[19:34] that when you can have real spirit life
[19:37] you can be a dual functioning person you
[19:41] can function both in the earthly realm
[19:43] and in the heavenly realm you can live
[19:46] in the earthly realm you can live in the
[19:48] spiritual realm that's how you were
[19:50] created Adam was created in the
[19:53] beginning to function that way how was
[19:55] he created Genesis 126 and God said let
[19:58] us make man in our image number one
[20:03] after our likeness number two and let
[20:08] him have dominion number three how was
[20:10] Adam created in the image of God in the
[20:13] likeness of God and to have dominion he
[20:17] was created to have dominion he
[20:20] forfeited that right of authority he
[20:24] forfeited that right of being in the
[20:27] image and in the likeness of God
[20:29] because of what happened in the fall
[20:31] their areas are three areas of life that
[20:35] God desires for us to develop as
[20:38] Christians and to function in the image
[20:41] of God the likeness of God and to have
[20:45] dominion this is what the Lord is
[20:47] calling us to as believers in this power
[20:50] let's examine this if Adam was made in
[20:53] the image of God but he lost some of
[20:55] that because God is three distinct
[20:59] personalities functioning as one God
[21:02] Adam was one man with three very
[21:06] important facets parts spirit soul and
[21:10] body he lost some of that in the fall so
[21:13] he lost some of that being in the image
[21:15] being in the lightness and having
[21:17] Dominion being in the image means
[21:20] created natural and spiritual potential
[21:25] you not only have potentiality or great
[21:29] potential in the natural to be something
[21:32] you've got great spiritual potential
[21:36] because you are made in the image of God
[21:40] we educate ourselves in the natural so
[21:44] that we can be fully we can we can kind
[21:48] of come to our full potential in the
[21:51] natural so we study and we learn and we
[21:53] educate and we do all of these things
[21:55] but how much time have we spent finding
[22:00] ways to reach our spiritual potential to
[22:05] be restored back to functioning in the
[22:10] image of God the likeness of God that
[22:14] speaks of developing natural and
[22:16] spiritual capacity and abilities so our
[22:20] potential our capacities our abilities
[22:25] our giftings the things that speak to us
[22:30] I heard a man of God a great man of God
[22:36] teaching from Australia Neville Johnson
[22:42] and he said you know you're sitting
[22:43] sometime in a service and you hear the
[22:47] preacher saying something and something
[22:49] inside of you leaps and he said that's
[22:52] because what that preacher is preaching
[22:55] is part of your destiny it's part of who
[23:00] God made you you are to have some part
[23:03] in that that he's being mentioned so it
[23:07] quickens you it awakens you in some way
[23:11] this is the truth we have abilities
[23:16] potential destiny that is inside of us
[23:20] that God wants to awaken some people
[23:23] have artistic abilities to draw to paint
[23:26] and that is a natural gift but that same
[23:30] gift God can use that in the spirit
[23:33] realm for you to be able to express what
[23:38] you receive in the spirit realm I know
[23:43] people who are prophetic artists who
[23:45] paint prophecy who paint the mind of God
[23:50] that which God is thinking that which
[23:52] God is emphasizing in a particular
[23:54] moment they're able under the anointing
[23:56] of the Holy Spirit to put it on a canvas
[23:58] now I would be right now unless I
[24:02] developed something than that I didn't
[24:04] know I had it would be very difficult
[24:06] for me to do that but God's given me
[24:08] other ways to express natural giftings
[24:12] and abilities and spiritual giftings and
[24:15] abilities find out brother sister find
[24:18] out my friend what some of your
[24:20] potential is potentials are your
[24:23] abilities are your spiritual giftings
[24:26] are natural giftings are see how you can
[24:29] develop them how you can exercise them
[24:33] how you can practice hearing from God
[24:37] and expressing it whether it's the dream
[24:42] having spiritual dreams are seeing
[24:45] visions are prophesying in the name of
[24:48] the Lord our art our music some people
[24:51] can sit down and and play a song have
[24:54] inspired inspired of Evan inspiration
[24:59] that comes from the Holy Spirit and I
[25:02] could sit down and maybe pluck out a
[25:03] little song it wouldn't sound like
[25:05] anything but someone else who God has
[25:08] given them that gifting in the natural
[25:10] not for the benefit of the natural only
[25:13] but for the benefit of the spiritual
[25:15] Kingdom to play and sing and lead us in
[25:18] worship and so forth and then if we see
[25:21] our natural and spiritual potential
[25:25] developed and our natural and spiritual
[25:28] capacities abilities and gifts develop
[25:30] then what happens is we move into that
[25:33] realm of Dominion Adam was made in the
[25:35] image of God the likeness of God and to
[25:38] have dominion and God is looking for a
[25:42] people who will function in the
[25:45] authority of God having Dominion having
[25:52] dominion what is Dominion its spiritual
[25:55] authority which is the result of a
[25:58] process of testings trials and spiritual
[26:03] growth you don't wake up all of a sudden
[26:07] and have dominion dominion is a process
[26:10] God is bringing us through a process I
[26:14] remember brother branham William Branham
[26:16] teaching about the power of the spoken
[26:19] word oh my what a subject the power of
[26:23] the spoken word now that doesn't just
[26:27] mean your words but but speaking the
[26:29] words of God speaking the mind of God
[26:33] expressing the heart of God very very
[26:38] powerful and very creative the spoken
[26:43] word of God is very creative he spoke
[26:46] and the world appeared he spoke and said
[26:49] let there be light him there was like he
[26:51] spoke and the sea was separated from the
[26:54] land so if you come into that place of
[26:56] speaking the Word of God the mind of God
[27:00] the will of God for that present season
[27:02] then the word that comes out of your
[27:04] mouth is creative why is that important
[27:07] because God's going to have a people who
[27:09] function in that authority and dominion
[27:11] so that we speak the Word of God
[27:15] expressing the mind in the will of God
[27:17] and we see circumstances changed we see
[27:21] healings take place we see deliverances
[27:24] take place because we're speaking the
[27:27] will of God and the creative Word of God
[27:29] is accomplishing the mind of God the
[27:32] will of God this is important now why do
[27:36] we not see that functioning info
[27:38] capacity in the body of Christ because
[27:40] he's still testing us we're still going
[27:43] through some trials we're still being
[27:46] honed in and remember that your trials
[27:50] can make you bitter or better and part
[27:53] of the problem is we've allowed the
[27:55] enemy to cause us to become bitter about
[27:58] what we're going through I just pray
[28:01] that the Lord will help us to get the
[28:03] full benefit of our trials and that we
[28:07] allow the Lord to polish us as jewels
[28:11] for his kingdom because he wants to use
[28:14] us he wants to flow through us I want to
[28:16] pray right now father in the name of
[28:18] Jesus I thank you for your word I thank
[28:22] you for hope I am full of hope about
[28:26] what you're doing through your word and
[28:29] in your body and with your people in
[28:32] this hour and we just surrender right
[28:34] now before you we just surrender we just
[28:37] say yes Lord come have your way in our
[28:40] life use us father help us to allow
[28:44] these testings and trials to bring us to
[28:47] maturity so that we also exercise that
[28:51] the spirit man and nourish the spirit
[28:54] man so that we can live out of the
[28:55] spirit man and not out of that natural
[28:57] carnal soulish man father I thank you
[29:02] for healing you are the healer I thank
[29:04] you for deliverance you are the
[29:05] deliverer just go forth and work your
[29:08] mighty works in and through your people

[29:17] anointing of the Lord has been here I
[29:19] pray that God we
[29:22] just show up in your life and you'll
[29:24] recognize him and let him do the things
[29:26] in you and through you that he desires
[29:28] thank you for watching the Eagles cry

[29:33] way or the other tune in again next time
