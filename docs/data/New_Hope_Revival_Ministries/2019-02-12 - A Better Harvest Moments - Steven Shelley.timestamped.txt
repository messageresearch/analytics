[0:13] I'm just wondering tonight Lord how long
[0:16] it's going to take before my better seat
[0:18] starts producing a better harvest so I'm
[0:22] ready to trust you as a redeemer
[0:24] if you promised in your word that you
[0:26] can redeem time I believe you can also
[0:29] read my sowing and reaping and
[0:32] harvesting cycle and I'm going to ask
[0:35] you Lord to redeem I've got to see some
[0:38] redemption in this because you're a
[0:39] redeemer you're sitting there in such
[0:41] desire to redeem because that's who you
[0:44] are and I have got a truckload of rotten
[0:47] fruit and I can't swallow it all so I'm
[0:51] coming to you as my Saviour and that's
[0:54] my Redeemer Lord helped me to sow better
[0:57] seed help me to examine the seed i daily
[1:01] so but lord will you redeem some of this
[1:04] rotten harvest because I really need to
[1:08] be able to move on for the kingdom of
[1:10] God I really need to be able to see the
[1:14] favor of the Lord in my life I really
[1:18] need to begin to see the favor of the
[1:20] Lord in my relationships I really need
[1:23] to begin to see the favor of the Lord on
[1:26] my job in my community in my church huh
[1:30] I really need to see this thing turned
[1:32] around
