over the years we've been in order and I've obeyed God I hope I'm not out of order I hope I'm obeying God but excuse me When you mention Tracy Borden I know all those Folks up in there you know I've been knowing them I've been knowing her all of her life um I know you don't know her and you may not remember this but I think that we should share things like this with our young people so they'll know you know and then when things happen you know they'll appreciate the Lord allowing them experience it but this Tracy Borden as a young woman she's had a bunch of kids a lot of kids um don't talk proper song they're kids but um her mother was in one of your meetings one time I don't know if you remembered or not when we were on Creek Road I knew her very well she was sitting in the middle row here about middle ways and I had invited her to come and visit us she lived in LaGrange all of her life so she come and visit us because she was on her way to the prison to visit her son who's in Columbus brother Shelley didn't know that but I did so brother Shelley you know the service went on to brother Shelley said that woman in the middle right there I don't know you I've never seen you before you don't know me do you she said no not till today I was invited to come to the service he said you're on your way to visit your son that's in prison now he didn't know that but she knew it and I knew it and that really I believe with all my heart that prepared her to meet the Lord because it wasn't long after then she passed away but prayed for her you called her up and you prayed for her and you asked God to give her peace in her heart which I've never seen a mother no more tormented about a son being imprisoned than she was that one she was so tormented and he prayed for her and asked God to give her peace and God did so many wonderful stories like they teach you young people need to hear about and it increased your faith in him yeah you know what if this is what God give me this morning brother Shelley he is my light you know that if you don't have a light you're in darkness then you run into things yeah you hurt yourself but here's your light don't matter where you're at how dark it gets now listen he is your salvation yes he's your salvation yes hang on to that that's the most wonderful gift anybody can have as a Salvation yeah listen who who government enemy who

them up every Sunday and bring them to church and have a Tuesday and bring them Church all the way from Lagrange sometimes three times a week when we had service on Saturday you think you we were old folks but we couldn't wait to get him so one time brother Shelley got up and he was preaching he said now listen I want some of y'all to be very careful what you're saying in your cars and in your home he said cause sometimes God will ask me to hear what you say well that really pulled a spark in us we didn't hardly say nothing coming to church yeah yeah you may have your seats Megan you can be ready to come on and sing for us this morning these days if Jesus tarries some of these who have seen so much yes sir will be in his presence yes sir so we sure ought to take every chance we can to hear not because he's a god of yesterday no but because he's a god of today yes indeed he's the same he is the same and you know days like today where we're gathered together to eat our lunch that's an ideal time to just sit down and share a testimony the goodness of God is so faithful and so good we're sure happy to see sister Judith Chappelle's back with us God bless you Sister Judith I don't see them I see Emily back there but we're glad that RJ and Emily and the children are back we've bless them in the name of the Lord Felix came in this week he heard there was a lot of fun going on down here apparently and he decided to jump on a plane and come on down Felix we're glad to see you the Lord blessed you I see a bunch of pointing so I'm I'm afraid I'm missing somebody they need these two microphones all right well before I give them these microphones I want to I want to receive the regular tithe and offering while they're singing so I'm going to call on Josiah and let's see Austin Hodges will you two brothers go to the people today and receive the tithe and offering we'll receive the special offering in just a few moments but we want to worship together as we're giving unto the Lord of our tithe and our offering and we want to worship as these young people sing Hallelujah yes [Music] Springfield [Music] Redemption [Music] give us power [Music] ful [Music] day [Music] come here [Music] Jesus [Music] freedom s [Music] fall down [Music] okay [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] crushed the darkness [Music] now we can play [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Mommy [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen amen miracles in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ victory in the name of Jesus Christ healing in the name of Jesus Christ walls of doubt and unbelief fall down in the name of Jesus that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow every tongue confess every unhealthy body Bow Down every demon Bow Down at the name of

receive our deliverance you do not have the power but if this the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies if that Spirit dwell in you Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah now at the at the end of each of those stanzas as they sang there was a proclamation an agreement that we as the people give amen let it be so albeit come upon me as I have agreed with the word oh I don't think we really understand the power of an amen the agreement with the word of God while there is singing while there is a testimony while there is preaching the power of an amen to go with that Proclamation I agree with that word and I don't just agree with that word I agree with that word for my life myself Hallelujah Give the Lord another Shout oh somebody shout the walls down [Music] shut them down let all the unbelief go let all the doubt go [Music] [Music] you felt like a stick in the mud all week and you shouldn't seem to let out a shout you couldn't seem to let out a Hallelujah you couldn't seem to let out a glory to God well while we're all here making noise today it's a good time to just get right in the flow and let out a Hallelujah praise the Lord Hallelujah Glory Glory [Music] he hasn't failed you he hasn't let you down so let your faith loose he's here he's here hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Glory Glory Glory mm-hmm horrible [Music] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus [Music] we give you glory Lord foreign I receive from you Lord I receive from you Lord [Music] the city Hallelujah thank you Lord yeah yes [Music] we are his weapon we are his weapon and we are his workmanship Hallelujah Glory Glory just had a small picture Flash in front of me and it looked like a it looked like a belt it's like you would hold your pants up with it but it looked like that it was being let loose for something that was strapped to you that you didn't need just Just Let it Loose Let it Loose let it fall behind you let it fall behind you the doubt the criticisms the divisions [Music] the the the Dual Visions the division let it go let it fall behind you today because all of these things that you literally allow to remain strapped to you they hinder the the octane of the word of God from being as effective in our lives with it as it would be without it so if we'll just let it fall behind us I don't know what you battle with you're a human being so I know that you do but just let it fall behind you today so that the octane the the Dynamics of the word of God mixed with the mechanics of the word of God can be the complete combustion engine that it needs to be to move us forward in the things of God Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we bless you Lord if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell in you with the same holy spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell in you on it will Quicken your mortal body if that Spirit dwell in you hold it will Quicken your mortal body give that Spirit dwell in you oh if the same Holy Spirit praise Christ from the dead dwell in you the same holy spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell in you oh it will Quicken your mortal body tip that spear well in you oh it will quick God your mortal bodies give that Spirit dwell in you oh we will quicker on your mortal body if that spirit oh it will Quicken your mortal bodies give that Spirit dwell in you [Music] can anybody testify to the quickening power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh yes Hallelujah that same Holy Spirit can give you energy when you don't think you have any Hallelujah we're going to receive this special offering today usually on the first Sunday of the month we receive the special offering for the principal of the mortgage of this property and we told you on Tuesday night that we have a uh insurance payment that is due on the 5th we need to make sure that this property is insured uh and of course we all know that product has gone up everything has gone up and so our insurance has also increased by 700 every six months but I would like to report to you that on Tuesday night that 700 was given in an offering so we want to thank the Lord for that so that means we need 3 738 dollars three thousand seven hundred thirty eight dollars to take care of this insurance payment for six months to take care of this property we want to give as we're not giving as uh trying to make sure that this building insured although that's where it's going we want to give as giving unto the Lord because this is our place of worship this is a ground that we feel comfortable to come and and to worship and to play and to have Fellowship one with another this is what God gave us and we want to do our part so if you have an offering that you brought for this purpose I would like for you to bring it and drop it in the offering bag today David would you get the other offering bag we'll let the saints come if you have it with you in your hand I would like for you to uh just hold it up and I would like to ask God's blessing anything above we'll go for principle I I it was already going through my mind if anything is above what is needed for the insurance it will go straight to the principal I believe that God is that kind of a provider he is he is one who goes above and beyond it was a promise of his word so if you brought your offering let's hold it in uh into the Lord father I want to thank you for faithful Believers Lord faithful to church faithful to worship and faithful to amen the word faithful to bring tithe and offering to you Lord I want to bless them now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as they have brought a special offering today Lord we're believing for multiplication I'm asking you God that you will just let blessings pour back into their homes and may you get Glory and Honor from our giving I pray Lord that if someone has given sacrificially today it looks sacrificial for them at this moment God I'm asking you that they would be able to see the blessings of the Lord even this week and that it's made up and they don't even feel the pinch of it I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and pronounce this blessing over your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen just mark it offering on the app anything above and beyond the insurance payment will go straight to the mortgage God bless you as you give to the Lord today if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead well in years dwell in you if the same holy spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you well in you it will pick God your mortal bodies if that spirit Spirit dwelling well and you boy it will Quicken your mortal body [Music] same holy spirit that raised Christ dwell in you dwell in you if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell in you it will quick on your mortal body [Music] it will Quicken your mortal body if that spirit amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise praise God you may be seated isn't the Lord wonderful oh you know the presence of the Lord was so real during worship I I can't tell you how long it's been since I I literally just lost my breath in his presence it just left me and I caught myself gasping to get a breath of air maybe I was breathing in Heaven's atmosphere and had to catch a little oxygen to stay alive but I don't care it was just it was so real and so tangible and if you missed it I'm so sorry you missed it those of you who are at home streaming who could have been here I'm sorry for you because I know you get a good blessing and you can experience his presence there but I don't care what people say there's nothing there's nothing like being in the corporate presence of God so I'm so thankful for streaming uh sister Judith can tell you how helpful it is to have streaming it has been the only church that her parents have had for nearly 30 years and it's vital to be able to have some contact with a body of Believers we're all supposed to be connected to a body somewhere amen but there's nothing like being in that presence of the Lord for yourself we should never take it for granted I'm just kind of waiting on you to get your attention back to me we should never take it for granted we should always give God praise and thank him and so we wonderful just seems like it's been so long since we were in church and we were just here Tuesday night and thank you for thinking of us and praying for us we just went two nights Thursday night and Friday night to North Georgia it had been a long long time many years since I had been in Helen in that area if you've never had a chance to visit it it's it's it's up again there were some years that it kind of went down and it just wasn't it wasn't all that particularly nice but it's nice again and the weather you know the weather we just watched the weather change we were supposed to get some of the rain and wind because of where we were and it just passed and you had nice weather here too didn't you God was so good to us that doesn't mean that we don't pray for those who have gone through such horrible loss it is a price it's a horrible price to pay but we're so thankful that God is helping people and so many have gone to to render Aid and uh we just pray I've prayed every day I know you have that God will make a way for those people especially those who are grieving the loss of loved ones you know folks property can be replaced it may not be your your old stuff but it can be replaced but lives that that's where the grief really lies so we want to lift those Folks up to prayer I'm waiting on Michael is he coming back in all right why don't we just I'm not going to sing we've had an hour of singing and worship let's just thank these musicians and these singers for everything that they have given you might want to listen up here for some of the announcements that we

ago that brother Magnuson is coming from Iceland we're excited about that we haven't been able to see him in a few years and there are some other streamers who are coming and uh you know this is a special camp meeting it's different than any we've had in a long time but it just feels good there's something about it that God has ordained it to be this way this year it's a little embarrassing for a pastor to be speaking in his own meeting but when I say that it reminds us of the old days because we used to have two weeks of camp meeting I preached every night the first week and then we had a special speaker or two in the SEC can you imagine just be honest were we crazy or just anointed or just young we were just young Sunday to Sunday to Sunday and sometimes morning Services too a couple times three day three days a week we had morning the first camp meeting we had morning Services every morning and uh I don't know how God was just good to us those were fat wouldn't you love to have the strength to commit to that again I've already only two of us don't you pretend like you already have it you know you're already weary you've been worshiping an hour and 27 minutes and you're already pooped I'm gonna have to drag some of you to the word this morning but you know God strengthened us he helped us it was hot July our first camp meetings were July under the 10 top Tabernacle the first year a hurricane a spun a tropical storm that they call the great deluge God said that which he had given us a prophecy and said that which man has borrowed from the Beavers will explode and you know there were dams that broke All Over Georgia up through even in Alabama and all up the East Coast and uh something that had come from camp meeting the interstate flooded in Georgia the interstate was flooded and uh we had put out some grass seed and God said I will protect this place and he did and did you know the hurricane rains we had a lot of rains but did you know it never even washed the grass seed off the hill God was that good and did he ever do some outstanding things so we it should it'll be kind of small and a little intimate but it's going to be a great blessing and we have so many who've never experienced a week of meetings here that are with us now and we're going to have the tents up and we're going to feed people we'll let you know again how many nights we think we can pull that off because we want these visitors to be to be treated with great hospitality and we want you to get in on the fellowship what brother Greeley was saying today is so important that we hear these testimonies I mentioned that a few weeks ago we went down and took dinner when Hawk and Maribeth were in Iceland we took dinner down to Sister Weems and sister Royale and we had a meal our whole family had a meal feel there and I wanted her to give her testimony of how God had brought her here and and even our kids who had probably heard us share it at some point it was new to them all over again and it was wonderful to hear and sister Flo sharing this this morning was a real blessing to me and you know God is the same he is the same and I can't help but but remember that today is brother biscoll's birthday and uh he is 88 years old today we should pray for him he is not strong as he once was but we should pray for him that God will continue to strengthen him and help him tomorrow is Sister Kate Dane's birthday we want to say hello an old time streamer of a friend of ours we want to say happy birthday to our sister in Florida and uh we just are thankful for the history that we have with her and Luke yovich who was up here doing some mighty fine singing while ago he has a birthday tomorrow so we want to say happy birthday to Luke amen and then on Wednesday Caleb his son has a birthday and uh he's the only other boy only other male around there and he deserves a little extra attention on his birthday is he in oh there he is standing up right there in the middle right behind sister Beth happy birthday Caleb Caleb John sometimes I call him John Caleb but he answers anyway Caleb John and then on Thursday they're not in here right now but I've seen them this morning is RJ and Emily's wedding anniversary so we want to say happy anniversary to them we want to say welcome home we have missed them so much [Applause] we want to say thank you for the wonderful breakfast that you brought to the musicians and the pastor this morning we appreciate that I wanted to make sure that they knew that we were not just glad to have their breakfast we were glad to have them and then on Friday of this week our oldest daughter Olivia who is not in here right now she's gone down but she has a birthday and Maya did she ever buy herself a nice birthday present she has zero credit zero she has no credit rating at all the boys we let them get a little credit card we kept saying we're going to get her a credit card we never did but how many of you know cash talks she has done an amazing job at saving a substantial amount of money uh twenty five thousand dollars you know that's I know it's private business but I'm pretty proud of her she took her birthday her Hanukkah her graduation and she walked in and when I told my friend Assad uh her story he said preacher he said there's not a finance company around here that's not going with this because she didn't have to finance much and when they find out that they're more than willing and they were bidding for her business and so they told her they said you went from a zero credit score today to a mighty Goodwin in six months so she got the vehicle that she wanted he called and said uh that there was one and we'd have to put a deposit on it site unseen that could be refunded I said we will no problem it's done five salesmen tried to buy it out from under him they were they were circling the desk while I was sitting there talking to them they were circling the desk these vehicles are popular and hard to come by and the the manager called him in and said you know that we always Mark these because of the of the value I mean the desire for these vehicles we always mark them and sell them five thousand dollars over invoice and the uh the the salesman looked at him he said I can't do that he said that's preacher he said that man prays for me every Friday and God hears his prayers he said I'm salesman of the month again this month because of preacher he said there's no way in the world that I can charge him and he said for the first time since I've been working here preacher my boss man looked at me and said do whatever you want to he said I'm going to sell it on the sticker like like he said I'm gonna make I'm gonna make nothing on it but he said I don't need to because I've made plenty of money on preachers prayers now that's his testimony it's God who did it he is not a message believer but I sent him the same text since the day he sold me my vehicle I sent him the same Friday text that I send you and I mean to tell you he comes up with some comments in all this time now he has never failed to answer me on a Friday every Friday he answers me and during the week he caught he'll text and say preacher I need prayer about this or that or the other or I've got some problem or my family's it and and I stop and pray for him one of these days he's going to walk through here I believe it I believe one day he's going to walk in here and give his testimony of how God is helping him and we kept noticing the whole day we were there we were just celebrities everybody wanted to say hello to us you're Assad's preacher friend you know God gives favor and we thank him so she bought her own birthday present this year you can wish her a happy birthday Yom Kippur begins Tuesday night as the day of atonement I'll talk to you about it Tuesday night if you're here and then next Sunday night Begins the week of Tabernacles and that's why our camp meeting begins on Tuesday night of next week we like to have it during the week of Tabernacles for those of you who like to ask when camp meeting is I have the dates for 2023 would you like to write it down and we'll try to get you a better speaker for 2023 than this year but October the 3rd through the 8th Tuesday through Sunday if Jesus tarries and we're still here October 3rd through the 8th and if he doesn't tarry we'll be having the best Tabernacles we've ever had in the presence of God in eternity can you say man Michael I'm going to do this now instead of at the end because you know how bad I am to forget Michael has a testimony you can tell us how God's touched your back and then if you've got any other thing you other news you want to share with us you can okay uh let's see about I guess be about three months ago now yes three months ago now I woke up one morning and I could hardly walk and uh I guess the greatest well there's nothing great about it it hurt but the greatest thing about having to go through all that is that my face never really wavered yes uh and all of it the God would uh heal me and I never got a not for lack of believing I promise you that I never tania's but I just a few times I got discouraged but most of the time I just did not feel that way right um and uh I've noticed uh once several times in life and on things like this and where I was sick or I've never had an injury where I couldn't move I've just like a broken ankle or so something like that it's usually a cold that puts me out for a little while but um I remember uh I would be directed I I keep a collection of um Bible movies which that's a broad term it may not necessarily be the Bible but uh it could be something like Overcomer or courageous in one of those movies but um I keep a collection of those and I don't know why but I always feel when I'm in a situation like that drawing to them for a specific reason sure and um this time going through this I felt really compelled to watch the old series Jesus of Nazareth yes from the 70s and uh I watched that through once again saw through that um I went back and watched The Passion of the Christ again I know Mel Gibson's not the most moral individual in the world maybe but his movie is the best unprecedented yeah it is it really is but um also looked into something I never looked into before um I have never listened to Billy Graham ever never even felt compelled to uh uh well you know listen to blood Graham you watch Billy Graham I did and I think the reason I was directed towards those movies and to watching him was actually how he put it he always lifted up the cross yes always stood and mostly he was preaching to people you know he needed to know the Lord to get saved but he left up the cross you also lift up the healing power amen so all I thank the Lord that no it wasn't pleasant having to go through all of that and having to be out of work for about two months I learned a lot about myself and spiritually about how to really trust the Lord and how to handle things yes and yes Crystal and I have an announcement uh Kim is a little bit of a surprise to us should be around June 5th of next year we will be expecting a baby so no you're You're Expecting now I'm not expecting it we're expecting it now but he or she will be here right God bless you God bless you [Applause] please don't wait until June the 5th to expect it it is on the way as of now and and will arrive sometime around that time and you're going to want to be ready to catch it uh they're also telling me yes and I I I actually meant to say something they're telling me that yesterday and since we didn't maybe didn't do birthdays last weekend they're telling me that yesterday was Sister Lydia whitmire's birthday I'm not giving her age but it's on up there sister Alfreda is outing you it's 87. and yourdis is going to be 97. yesterday so sister Lydia and sister jordis had a birthday yesterday and we're talking about big birthdays so let us say happy birthday to them that's worth mentioning let's stand for the word oh he's good he is so so good I'm just gonna have you to to go again to Second Corinthians chapter 10. verse 3 through 6. I hope you have some strength to pull on the word and the gift today let's believe that God will move and help us this is an important uh portion of scripture to kind of finish out maybe finish out the series sister green texted me this week and she said I'm I'm ready for part two of Tuesday nights she enjoyed the the talk that we did on the red heifer and uh so we'll keep you updated on that as things continue to transpire for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal where the shaw yelled out in inspiration to us that that we are his weapons and true we're filled with his name we're filled with his word we're filled with the spirit we become the weapons we also become the plowshares that he uses for the Harvest no doubt about it for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but what Mighty through God to the pulling down of of strongholds casting down imaginations this is a work of effort it is not an automatic deal it's something you have to consciously do by living in the present by staying in the moment casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity putting in prison every thought to The Obedience of Christ I want you to get this this thought this is literally binding every thought to Christ binding it to Christ and remembering his obedience it goes on and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled spend a little time around your own back door making sure that you have obeyed God before you worry about someone else's obedience isn't that good may God help us Lord we look to you today if we went home right now we would say we have surely been in the presence of the Lord but every moment up until this moment prepares us to receive an installment of your word not by letter only but by the anointed living breathing moving ever active word of God so we ask that you would Inspire each one of us to receive that word and that you would Inspire us to obey this word and that you would remind us to do it in a on a daily basis when our busyness of life would cause us to forget the importance of binding every thought to The Obedience of Christ we call out for your help help today we ask for you to help us now as we work together in your anointing and we ask for this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory and the Saints said amen you may be seated because the enemy's ultimate desire is to cause death the Bible said the thief has come to steal to kill and to to steal to kill and to one more time to steal to kill and to destroy and we don't want to give him any praise we don't want to brag on the enemy today but we want to say this he's very busy very diligently stealing killing and destroying but Jesus said in the next place John 10 10 he said but I am come enough of what the devil has come to do I have come to to bring life to give life and that they might have it I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly you know that's not survival that's overcoming life that's not just barely getting by till Friday come on now that's living a Victorious Life the one that we sung about this morning that's echoing the authority of Christ that's echoing the victory of Christ how many of you want to live that kind of alive how many of you want to offer that kind of Praise of Praise that Echoes the authority of Christ a praise that Echoes the victory that we have in Christ it's ours because it's paid for by the blood so the enemy is constantly busy Desiring to cause death to our visions to our our dreams to our desires he's the greatest dream thief of them all when the Holy Spirit plants an inspiration in your life the enemy is always standing by to discourage you from it to destroy your faith in it and to cause you to give up somebody's got to hold on when everybody around you is giving up somebody has to take a hold of God's word and say I refuse to surrender one inch of ground I'm on a stand on this truth and I'm going to hold on to the promises of God his desire to cause death to ruin Visions to steal dreams to take hope to destroy our ability to stand in faith produces what we call death structures in our life I want us to look at slide 40 real quick we're going to go over these because we hit them very quickly at the end of a service death structures can be built over both individual lives and even whole congregations and Ministries you know sin is contagious if a church turns a deaf ear and a blind eye to divorce and remarriage the next thing you know it becomes a stronghold over a Congregation of people somebody's got to stand on the word if a church ignores what pornography is doing in marriages today never addresses it or even homosexuality and the things that are going on around us if it never gets addressed if holiness and modesty is never addressed the enemy will build a structure over a whole body that becomes a stronghold that will intimidate the preacher it's not they don't notice it it's that the enemy is there to raise an intimidation so that they won't even mention the things that matter to the heart of God and the scriptures are clear these things matter so we can't allow any stronghold any false Paradigm any death structure to keep us from the truth we have to keep fighting for the truth because it's ours amen so the enemy uh he's constantly trying to to build these structures over our lives our congregations our Ministries our region our state our nation in slide 41 helps us to see whatever is not releasing or producing life it's a death structure if we get out of balance with law and Grace it produces a death structure come on if we get out of balance with the inward light and the outward light it produces a death structure if we get out of balance with sickness and healing and we start backing off our our faith and backing off what brother Greeley was releasing up here over us just a few minutes ago to just take I tell you what I was claiming my healing I was thinking about you too but there while we were worshiping earlier I was claiming my healing God showed me this week again and reminded me again that he is a Healer I left here Tuesday night not even knowing that I was about to have an attack in my foot and in the night Tuesday night and Wednesday morning an attack came on my foot and when I went to get up in the night I could hardly get to the bathroom couldn't put any weight on it at all by Wednesday midday I was on a walking stick and I had to put the weight on the stick and I mean it was swelling and it was hurting and we were supposed to go away for two days and I thought well I could put something on Facebook have all a privately and have all the church people praying but all of a sudden I had this inspiration that I would just reach out to the young people and I want you to know I depend on the older people's prayers I live by them so this wasn't any anyway any segregation or or Prejudice but it was just inspired I said I don't want everybody to know I'm struggling like this so I'm just going to reach out to the young people and I want you to know they begin immediately to say we're praying Pastor we're praying I don't know if everybody prayed that said they were praying but somebody prayed and somebody touched the Lord because when I woke up Thursday morning I had no pain in my foot whatsoever I put the cane in the vehicle just in case but I never even took it out of the vehicle while I was away and not only that I went down 310 steps and walked up 310 steps and Hike that day four and a half miles on my tracker for somebody that couldn't even walk hardly the day before you know that was faith that was touching God that was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever vitamin C can't do that supplements can't do that it takes a long time for that stuff to get in your system and I highly recommend you supplementing vitamins and minerals I don't want you to think I don't but anybody who's ever done those things knows it takes a while for that to build your levels up no but when God does it whoa he can like Michael said he doesn't always heal us instantly but he can and he did and I'm claiming all that I have need of and I hope you will take advantage of an atmosphere like we had this morning to take that claim stake your claim tell the enemy that you refuse to let go of the promises of God so when we keep revisiting over and over those things that bring us back to doubt and death the thoughts the accusations the suppositions that keep bringing us back to doubt and death when we keep revisiting those things ignoring the fact that the that the Mind conversation never turns out well it always turns out negative it always turns out anointing your doubt instead of your faith so we have to recognize I got to stay out of that place let me give you Romans 7 5 again real quick slide 42 when we were living in the flesh mere physical lives the sinful passions that were awakened and aroused us up excuse me and aroused up by what the law makes sin we're constantly operating in our natural powers in our bodily organs in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh so that we bore fruit for death now as Sinners it is expected that we Bear death fruit but as Believers it's a trick of the enemy to cause us to be to be passing out death fruit Our Testimony our lifestyle even the way we worship is supposed to be like giving somebody Juicy Fruit come on fruit that's healing fruit that's liberating and there's delivering power in it not death and depression Webster's Dictionary defines a structure as the manner of which something is constructed as a building or a bridge a framework so when we use the term death structure then it helps us to see it's the enemy building a framework over our lives board by board piece by piece nail by nail until he can climb up on the top of it and Lord over our emotions Lord over our thoughts how many of you know we will if you let him but we're taking him down we're taking him down and we're taking his structure down we're taking his platform out from under him because we don't want to have have we don't want him to even have a place to stand second Corinthians 3 and 6 in the Amplified said it is he who has qualified US making us to be fit and what Worthy and what as ministers and dispensers of a New Covenant of Salvation through Christ not Ministers of the letter of Legally written code but of the spirit for the code of the law kills but the Holy Spirit does what it makes alive so we just say by the grace of God we want to tear down every structure structure of death it's clear that if we are led by the law the doctrines of men religious systems or even Traditions that make the word of God none effective we're going to experience More Death than we are life if we as individuals are corporately in our churches begin to build our faith on either of these foundations rather than the pure truth of God's word as revealed by the Holy Spirit we will be caught up in structures that tend to produce death and not life it is going to be imperative that we who are a part of the remnant bride must actively seek with discernment to overthrow all of the death structures in our lives and in our churches and in our church slide 45 God has an established framework that we must hang Our Lives upon and that one is built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets it is the holy word of God Ephesians 2 21 and 22 I read this to you already let me share it again in him the whole structure this is the structure we want to be a part of it's joined bound welded together harmoniously now let me talk to you just a minute about Harmony was someone talking to us recently about Harmony who was that somebody was that brother Dwayne yeah it was he was talking about Harmony let me tell you something about Harmony Harmony is not everybody singing the same note there's a lot of good singers there's a lot of groups that can sing but I notice that a lot of times they're all singing the same note that gets old with me in a hurry that's singing in unison singing the same word and the same note that's not Harmony I want you to know God is after Harmony he's not after uniformity he's after Harmony and Harmony is everyone singing a note that complements the other note and it starts building one voice upon another voice upon another voice and it Blends together to make a harmonious sound that's almost one voice but so full that one Voice couldn't possibly make such a full note you hear musicians sometimes bragging about family Harmony now I'm sorry to tell you every family doesn't have family Harmony I know there are people who think every African-American person can sing that's kind of a Prejudice thing or some kind of what do you call it a stereotype but that's not true I met some That Couldn't and it's possible to be in a family where everybody sings but you now you can break that and claim it you can ask the Lord to give you a voice but if you get a few from one family who have a gift of song and you lay their voices together there is no Harmony any sweeter in all the world than family Harmony When God's people begin to release the right note I'm preaching I need some help when God's people begin to release not sit in the corner with their arms folded like some bullfrog who swallowed buckshot not like somebody's sucking on a persimmon not somebody who drank pickle juice with their Corn Flakes but somebody that's found the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength it's what I it's what gives me the strength to keep moving on it's when he releases a bubble of Joy a joy bubble down into the inside of the inside of the inside catch up now some of you are offended because I told you you might not be able to sing foreign why don't you forgive me and just come on back let's listen what I tell people everybody can sing in the shower let's get in the shower shut the door sing your heart out your family may be in the other room doing like this but your papa is looking over the balcony of Heaven saying to the angels listen up my boy singing for me it doesn't have to be beautiful to be unto God you just let out a song to him and it's always pleasing in his ear so you all forgive me now can we catch up and move on the Lord give me a an experience one time I don't want to go too deep into it because it seems nearly impossible that it could be played out the way that I saw it oftentimes we see things with the characters that we are presently with it does not necessarily mean we'll always be with the same characters people die people go on to other things people walk into fellowship and they walk out of fellowship and so I think the Lord was saying something more much higher to me in this than who was actually involved but but what was happening was I I we were standing together uh some Ministry friends of ours my wife and I were standing together with them and strangely enough I don't think I could put my hand on the little toy but brother Kevin heard me tell them this and he went on eBay and bought me one of the toys because it reminded me of a toy that I played with when I was a child how many of you remember those little pianos that you press the button and they had these little creature little singers they were happy looking happy looking elves or something you know I don't know not anything hideous but they had little heads that stuck up on the piano when I'm describing it sounds creepy but it wasn't creepy at all I'd have to get it out and show it to you it had little heads and when you press one button that one of the mouse would open up ah and you're president of all it'd make little sounds and this is was the experience that I saw in the spirit we were standing in Heavenly places and every single voice the sound of that voice because every person that's born again of the spirit is given a sound in the spirit so I don't want you to be making fun of someone sound be very careful when the spirit of God starts moving some people say whoa leave them leave them some people say ciao leave them be careful I hear we find it so easy to kind of make fun of people like that little sister Craighead when she wrote the song My theophy and when she sung it she she had a note she would hit and every time she hit that note in the song her shoe and foot would go she go oh that was her sound I'm not making fun of her sound I'm telling you it was her anybody know what brother Shaw's sound is we honor you we're not making fun of you we honor you hey hey you don't know what happens when somebody discovers their reaction to the spirit I don't make fun of people's motions with their hands because we have called angels to attention by the way by the way we move our hands or by a sound that comes out of our mouth oh if you've never been caught up into the Heavenly places you can't imagine how it moves but it moves to a different it's the atmosphere is not the same and the way things are done prayer doesn't even look the same in the spirit as it looks in the natural we were traveling with brother what's his name the black brother who saw Aaron Evans who Jesus appeared to him in the jail cell where he was put there for murder and Jesus appeared to him in that prison sailing and said to him hey I'm not a white man and I'm not a black man but I'm the right man you better fall down on your knees and worship me that was his testimony someone said I don't believe that happened well all I know is his life the fruit of the thing ought to show it his life turned around he came off of prison and out of death row and whatever else he was bound by and began to go across the world and preach the gospel so somebody showed up and we traveled with him a little while we were out in the tri-states of Washington in a meeting and uh Jill Maria's wife when the spirit of God would move she'd say how h o I'm not going to make fun of that because in this experience everybody had a sound and Josiah when when I released a sound in this experience I saw a certain division or kind of angel raise up to stand at attention and when that's [Music] and when that sound stopped I didn't stop it it just stopped I saw those angels shrink back to their place my wife was standing with me in this experience and she released the sound and I saw another type another ranking of angels when that sound began to come out of her mouth and she threw her head back like that like a wild woman and that sound began to come out of her mouth I saw this entirely different I don't want to say race but rank or kind or or or or a division of angels they raised up in brother they were ready and when that sound stopped out of her mouth they just folded right back into their place just a very reverent stand and the two other individuals that were with us as each of them began to release their sound they called up an entirely different there wasn't one of those four voices that caused the same kind of angel or rank or or description of Angel to come to attention not one in the same but all four caused a different kind to raise up and when I describe that to Kevin he he he opened up those little gifts opened up the little mouths and put pictures there for me to remember about the sound and each one had a sound one of the pictures he placed there was brother green because brother green certainly had a voice in my life and I honor him for that and there were others there you if you made your little piano you you would know a voices that have had a a place in your aren't you thankful I know we're just kind of talking this morning aren't you thankful for every voice that God has used along the way there may be some that you wouldn't go back and seek out to hear their voice again because their time in your life has expired and you have moved on but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't honor the times that God used that individual to speak into your life this is how the kingdom operates Church says they're not with us anymore so nothing they ever said or did matters no some of you are holding on to dreams that were interpreted for you and prophecies that were given to you by people that we no longer walk in fellowship with don't throw the baby out with the bath water don't get rid of the Cherry Pie because you found a pit and for whatever say for for for all that's good please don't get rid of the fried chicken because you hit a bone you take the bone out so God uses these people but let me tell you this I didn't mean to take this much time I should have read it if I was going to take this much time I could have read you the description of the experience but all of a sudden all four of us begin to let out our sound now when I heard those four individual sounds they didn't sound anything alike very unique very distinct very different tones but all of a sudden God began to use us like puppets and he began to let that Roar that sound begin to come out of all four of our mouths and brother when when that happened it made Harmony just like it makes in here come on now I want to say one more time I know everybody don't get the flag waving even though it's all through the Bible somebody said where'd that come from the Bible have you got time there's over 40 places see but if you're not used to that then you you might you might it might be easier for you to be critical than to investigate but I'm the kind of person I want to investigate and see what it's all about so everybody's not a flag waiver everybody's not a dancer everybody's not a what was brother Shaw's some of you go to bed at night you can hear it everybody don't do this but oh what Harmony I begin to hear as those four very unique sounds out of our four mouths begin to blend and this is the truth if I've ever told it I saw a kind of Angel raise up from the midst of that choir what looked like a choir of angels I saw a a a a a division a kind a race of angels to raise up like I had never in my life seen before and I screamed out oh in my experience in the room I cried out oh even though in the heavenlies the sound was still being played through me and I said I don't know any way to describe them except terrible they were terrible in the King James version sense of the word I am telling you they were the mightiest Warriors that I had ever seen in my life and I knew that they were ready brother to do the king's business there was a wildness Oh I don't believe there's any wild worry you ought to see the ones that go before me sometime when I get myself in trouble and they have to go fight for me they're pretty bad to the bone themselves and by women but I want you to know these raised up with surgery I knew they were ready to take off the devils and as soon as that sound ceased from coming out of our mouths I saw those huge Angels they raised up bigger taller brighter than all the others and I saw them just kind of fall back into play God was teaching me something he was teaching me that every Angel is not the same there are different kinds of ranks and divisions of Angels the Bible tells us there are different principalities and powers and if their spiritual wickedness if there's Variety in spiritual wickedness in high places there is variety in righteousness in high places remember anything the enemy is doing over here in darkness he is copying he is imitating what he has experienced over here in the light you understand that don't you and so it's a lot bigger than what we realize and I learned in that moment that there's nothing like the harmony that is formed when God calls people to stand together in a particular hour for a particular cause for a particular purpose and what if I told you we're at that moment we're there we're there now when I left here Tuesday night was a week ago after speaking 10 to 20 minutes on the standard of this church and I spoke especially to new newer ones who might not know how we have done things there were those who were not here if you if you do if you were not here you're taking anything you hear second-handed because no one would intentionally misrepresent something that I have said but they might do that and if Leviathan raised his ugly head he knows how to twist it to the hearer you better be on that twisting serpent you better watch how he operates to twist to try to cause you to get your little feelings hurt so that you reject the truth of the word that's how he operates isn't it you've watched him we play we play that game we played it not too long ago on a Saturday night at Luke and Megan's and it'll crack you up somebody Whispers something in the ear of one but they got to do it very very quietly where you can hardly hear them so you repeat what you think they said and then it got all around the room how many of you were there some of you a lot of you okay good your Witnesses and the next thing you know when it got all the way around the room you could it was it was nothing sometimes not even the same words sometimes the words that were used in the beginning were never even showed up in the end results that's just human error but you get a spirit behind it trying to twist things so I knew I knew when I left here that Tuesday night that the enemy was mad and I anticipated an ugliness and he produced One but he was defeated and he is defeated and I'm here today not backing up one half an inch because when I went to bed I felt like I'd been beat up kind of like last Sunday night when I went home and went to bed I felt like I'd been spiritually abused beat up it'll wear you out and so I felt that way that Tuesday night but he came and he came in such a sweet way that I told my family I said he he said I said he said we did the right thing so when the little twists and concerns begin to come and things got a little out of whack I realized that that was nothing but confirmation to the fact that he said listen I'm not working for you I love you I'm fighting with you but I don't work for you I work for him and when he told me it was all right and he said because of that you were about to go to a higher level as a body he said I'm going to raise you up to a higher level as a body and I told my family the next day or the next I said he's he's going to raise us up and we're not going to badge on holiness we're going to stand right there on that line because he's going to raise us up honey what night was it do you remember what night it was that I asked you it was a few nights after that that the Lord came in the bedroom again while we were sleeping the Lord came he came so preciously and raised up the bed got nothing good that's why you don't ever have them brother Madam said so he said you know why people don't see Angels they don't believe in them well I choose to believe in them and they come I believe in spiritual experience my faith is not built on that it's built on the land but he confirms his word still today in our lives you remember what night it was it might have been Saturday no no no no no I think it was Sunday night I think it might have been Sunday night well we went to bed Sunday night so early Monday morning or it could have been Saturday honey I don't it might have been Saturday the spirit of the Lord came in and he lifted the bed and not only did he lift the bed he Lifted Me and I tell you I I'm old now and I have a lot between between here and here and I don't I can't just sit straight up in the bed no more I have to roll out of the bed because of my sciatic and so when I go to get up I just turn out of the bed like that with my leg I don't know how long I've been late wind in the world I've been laying flat on the bed and sat straight up I know I didn't do that in my own strength I know he did that for me when I came to when I woke up when I came out of that experience I was sitting up in the bed like someone had set me up in the bed and I looked and the bed was lifted up off the floor and the Lord confirmed to me he said I told you I was Raising you all up raising you up raising that place up to a higher level I'm here to confirm that it's a confirmation somebody said well what does it mean it means we're going to higher places in his word it means he wants to heal our bodies and Deliver Us from oppression it means he wants to save our lost families [Music] he wants to give us souls for our labor he wants to deliver those who need Deliverance we don't have to stay down here there's a voice that says come up higher I want to show you something [Applause] give him praise and I wasn't going to share all that this morning I believe it was Saturday night a week ago last night I believe because I wanted to share it Sunday and when I woke up the Lord had given me something else to share remember before brother Dwayne came so I didn't share it now I believe it's the right time how many of you believe God never makes a mistake he's always right on time are you still with me this isn't a vote of confidence for me honey I'm not we're not voting this is to show you that God is more he's alive and well oh he's alive and well my wife woke up she raised up she looked over she went right back to sleep I asked her the next day honey did you realize that the bed when you woke up like that did you realize the bed wasn't even sitting on the floor She said she just kind of turned red she said no I didn't even realize it I so wish that I'd you don't know in those moments when the presence of God's so real I didn't know whether to poke her or not you don't want to scare somebody she has lived through some real things I'm telling you she's lived through some real experiences I'm glad to have her it didn't bother me that she didn't maybe recognize what was going on all of that I shared all of that because of the scripture there in him the whole structure is joined bound welded together harmoniously may we come together in worship because remember that's that's I know people think we emphasize that that hour a little too much but remember that's what God showed us that sound that he gave me for a new building a building we're not in now remember that sound that he gave me in that moment was a sound that roared from worship and that created an atmosphere for The Living Word to walk in Among Us and when that Living Word is raised from the pages of history and becomes a living reality to a people of Faith he begins to do the very same thing today that he did yesterday and it's in that atmosphere that brother Branham said creative Miracles would be done and ananiasis and sapphirus would fall to the ground he said it missing limbs would be restored he said does anybody still believe that's what happens when people are working together harmoniously I don't care if you have to fight one another tooth and toenail in the natural whatever you do don't give up on each other don't give up on each other because we will not be able to create the sound that roused that group of warring angels like I've never seen before with missing sounds Among Us it'll take everyone that God has ordained to be here and you know why we haven't seen it yet because they all ain't got here yet they're not all here yet I'm prophesying to you now they are not all here yet but when they get here [Applause] we should have some of our backyard scraps all worked out families fight they fall out they have some difficulty brother Branham said but we do that scrapping in the backyard when we come around to the front yard we're all branhams that's what he said my brothers we get around to the front yard and we'll fight you in the backyard we fight each other when we get to the front yard you better not cross us I'm just telling you what he's saying does anybody understand how that applies to the spiritual you see my flaws I see yours I may even share them and you might share mine with you and you might share with me but when we get into this atmosphere we're not here looking at each other's pimples we're not worried about somebody's crooked nose then everybody's got a flaw nobody's examining flabby underarms when you get in the spirit when we get in the spirit we see past all imperfection and we sing with sister Peterson oh praise the lord it's Jesus that I see let me tell you something I didn't see a bunch of carnality in this house when we were worshiping the Lord this morning I'm preaching to you what I saw was the Perfection of Christ resting on a body of believers who had laid their differences down so they might enter in to that with to that which is Beyond the Veil but we get out there we may you know you you volleyball I I want you to know I have come this close to outlawing volleyball somebody said you couldn't do it I did and I could again we used to time them and if I remember that Chad you do you have 45 minutes to play we're not going to wrap our lives up in things that are carnal we watched these these that are on up here now I see all these ladies in here with bare legs and I'm thinking to myself you'd have had a tough time way back when because we come through old school to get to where we are and if I thought that our Eternal destination was resting in that I'd preach it this morning the reason that I don't is because I don't think that's the case but there was a time that we measured them we give them a little while and the rest of the time we wanted to be spiritual entertainment and when I say entertainment I mean worship singing and talking about the things of God we didn't have as many young people then as we do now I don't think it was particularly related to that but every time I get aggravated at my own children not just yours for how competitive they can be smack talking they can be you see I I'm getting some support I hope he'll support me when I say what I'm going to say in a minute because I'm going to tell you why I don't stop it but uh I I get aggravated because I I wasn't I wasn't brought up in those things I never played ball I never did those kind of things so I couldn't really teach my boys how to do any of that because I didn't grow up doing it so most of their flaws like that I blame on Ben and Zach no don't you remember Chad was always my favorite I didn't blame him for nothing that's what they all said you know but but I guess if you're going to be fair here Chad taught them they're Fair of carnality there's fair share too but it was those boys that taught him how to catch a ball and hit a ball wasn't me they learned those things from one another and I think sometimes people forget that you've got to learn you're not born into the world knowing how to spike and if you didn't grow up in a spiky environment or a competitive environment you don't know those things and so I think what we really ought to do is say to them this yes when you play you should play to win or you you're not going to criticize that are you you're going to play to lose is that what you're going to teach them to go out there in the world with played loose no we're going to teach him to play to win we're going to tell them if you don't want to win and you don't want to play with to the best of your ability sit down and watch but if you're out there and you're not as good as somebody else there's nothing to help somebody rise oh I'm going to preach an hour on this there's nothing that helps someone rise and Thrive like giving them a little positive feedback whoo good try and I don't just mean to you boys who's trying to catch a girl's attention I've seen you all do that I've seen it I we're just oh you streamers just turn it off we're just taking care of family business this morning you won't get nothing out of this I don't mean that I mean sincere praise goes a long way and when it's over you pull them off to the side and you say now look you were not watching you you were not watching you've got to watch the ball if you don't go hit you in the face ain't that right I was talking to Felix because we were all praying for his eye it'll get you don't embarrass them and think they're going to thrive lift them up I'm preaching to you that are saying amen I'm preaching to you that are not take a little extra time give somebody an arm up one of these young girls learn that if if any girl can do it she can somebody said why don't you tell them if a boy can do it they can because I don't believe that so I'm not going to preach that I believe there are certain things that she ought not to want to do but if there's any girl anywhere that can do good at volleyball then every one of these girls can do good at volleyball with a little arm up and a hand up and a little praise a little less competition but every time I think I'm going to stop it the spirit of the Lord comes to me and says I'm telling you the truth now you don't have to believe me you'd be surprised what are you saying you'd be surprised what I can teach him you've got to learn to step on one another you've got to learn to get on each other's nerves and do it well you got to learn to take those more it takes us all it takes uncomely parts you can't all be a strong arm somebody has to be afoot some of you asked brother Billy how important the thumb is he found that out button into his shirt to come to church today there are certain things you need a thumb for we need each other we can't let anything out there cause us to treat each other different when we come in here we've got to learn from those kinds of environments I've been criticized for letting my boys play on a softball team I did it because I wanted them to learn something that I couldn't teach them you don't have to do the same I wanted them to learn what it is to be a part of a team because I wanted them to bring that kind of an attitude into a service I pray for these musicians every Sunday morning at 10 till because the gifts in their life are vital to create this harmonious building that God desires to build in this house so learn from your from your rubbing one iron but treat one another with dignity and respect but learn that iron sharpeneth iron you see some Sunday people come in there all chill and some Sunday they come to the volleyball court and they're worn out they're they're tired their nerves are frazzled and they act like little kindergartners and they've got children to raise but when they get out there they act like little preschoolers we learn from that we learn from that be the first to apologize let me give you some successful marriage advice be very quick to apologize so important don't wait till the next day don't wait till the next week when you know you haven't handled something properly you look her right in the eyeballs and you say I messed up and I'm asking you to forgive me but she's the wife and she's the woman and she's the weaker and so forth and Etc that's why it's even more powerful for the man to say I mess this up I want you to forgive me we learn so much in life if we if we're if we're teachable that will help transfer that will transfer into what God is calling this body to model he's building a family where there will be no big eyes and little use come on now and I don't want you apologizing for your family I want you to help build them into what God has created them to do build them model it in front of them live it in front of them show these children the right way I'd like to say to some of you parents who are training your children to to wear on your nerves so you'll take them out I'd like to say to some of you that you have to work with them at times and sometimes you have to do that you have to go out because you don't want to disturb a service but make sure that you're not training them you'll know the balance make sure that you're not training them to wiggle to talk a little louder so that you'll take them in there and feed them and you do you talk to your your girlfriends while they play on the floor did it get quiet you don't want to train them for that reason you don't want to do that you want to make sure that they understand that it's your goal your desire to be in here and to have them with you when you have to take them out you do that and don't you think that anybody's going to criticize you for that we're not going to do it but our church is growing some and we're going to need to use the nursing nursery for nursing I don't want any sister in here to have to go to the dirty bathroom no offense it's usually very clean sister Jennifer but I don't want anybody to have to go in the bathroom to nurse their baby we've got a large Nursery here the first nursery on the right that was dedicated for nursing mothers and we have gotten a little slack and we've used it for other things because we didn't have so many nursing babies but guess what we've got some and more on the way so we have to be flexible I'm preaching to you and we have to learn to shift a little bit because growth and progress and being built up is hard sometimes but we're building up structures that will produce life behave yourself out there so that when you come in here you can forgive and you're not holding anything against one another when you start building an atmosphere like we had today can you imagine can you imagine the presence of the Lord being so real that it physically took my breath I wasn't breathing and didn't know it and then I realized all of a sudden I may need a little air here and I went it was so real and so captivating I may have been surviving a few seconds on another atmosphere eventually I needed some oxygen from planet Earth I know we don't live by feeling but folk we're coming up [Music] enter into something that real we're getting above ourselves we're stretching out of our comfort zones you get in here and get all you can in him the whole structure is joy and bound welded together harmoniously and it continues to rise grow increase into a holy Temple in the Lord a sanctuary dedicated consecrated and sacred to the presence of the Lord this is the this is what I'm talking about here's the house in him and in Fellowship thank you Amplified in him and in fellowship with one another you yourselves also are being built up into this structure into this house with the rest to form a fixed Abode a Dwelling Place of God In by through the spirit Mark that down Mark Ephesians 2 21 22 in the Amplified Bible somebody take a picture of it get your phone out and take a picture of this zoom in get that verse when you're Googling over your baby pictures and looking at your vacation picture I want that to stare you in the face I want you to say this is what God is doing in me and through me I am a part of this structure I don't know if I'm a finger or a toe I don't know if I'm part of the arm or the leg I don't know if I'm an eye or an ear but I know I'm part of this body it's a spiritual body it's not a natural body slide 47. a death structure is created when the devil builds the foundation of past the pains the failures the disappointments and weaknesses of yesterday are you still with me good let me ask you a question has anybody had any any failure in your past any pain in your past any disappointments in your past any weaknesses in your past every one of us and the enemy wants to build on that place that's the foundation he uses the the Church of the Living God is built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets which is the Chief Cornerstone the Lord Jesus Christ but death structures are built on the foundation of past pain past failure past disappointment and past weaknesses he then attempts to establish a strategy that becomes a structure resulting in the abandonment or death of vision and abortion of Destiny Hope deferred we were drowning in debt we were in a situation where it is not likely that this property would have been paid off in my lifetime then what about the rest of the vision there's no room to stand on the rest of the vision when you can't pay for the last come on and God spoke to brother Greeley and said it's time to do something about it come on this is how it works that's that's that was his sound joining with with your sound to form a a a a a a a a coalition to get this thing done now we're we're moving out and we can talk about how God will make provision because he's shown us he can and he's shown us that he can if we're faithful to keep the vision in front of us that's what we needed brother Greely to do and many other things but that was one of the things that God used him for and he's using him for to keep that in front of us we got to get out from under this not so that we can't ever believe for something else but so that we don't have we're not drowning anymore how many of you know it's already shrunk to a place where we know we can do it well guess what we could do it when it wasn't we just had to make up our mind to do it so what happens is the enemy moves in on disappointments of the past and failures and pain and and weaknesses and he and he kills any hope any Vision Any Dream for the future and he calls his Destinies to be aborted I'm nearly done but I want your attention he caused his Destinies to be aborted and he used his hope deferred once a death structure is in place the enemy will seek to gain illegitimate Authority over a life he starts driving people around with their emotions they become angry they become jealous they become bitter not having to do with today having to do with a build up from yesterday come on we got to recognize that and tear it down there's one thing you need to know he's looking for control and authority over your life but here we are echoing the authority of Jesus Christ let me just tell you this if you ask the devil to dinner he'll come and bring a suitcase if you ever had a family member that you couldn't even invite to dinner because you knew they wouldn't know when to go home oh have you ever had an uncle you couldn't invite to come visit because you knew he'd come on a one-way ticket the devil is that kind of Uncle the devil is that kind of a family member you cannot invite the the enemy you can't invite the devil to come to your house and have tea with you or dinner with you and expect him not to bring his suitcase because any invitation to that kind of a spirit will cause him to come to stay and you don't want that in other words if you open any door he moves into Stage someone give me the reference for if you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile where is that found in the Bible someone want to look it up on your smartphone if you give the devil an inch you'll take a mile where's that found that's in Saint Stephen Shelley chapter 4 verse 1. it's not in the book that's what grandma said our granny said if you give that devil an inch he'll take them all the Bible did say give not space to the enemy don't give the devil's face don't give him a listen to me I'ma wait till I know you're listening don't give the enemy a place to work in your emotions don't take your offense from the volleyball court to your house leave it here hug one another man to me and go hug your brother sisters go hug one another you ruffled each other's feathers out there at the at the cornhole it's a good thing we got rid of brother Dwayne some of the rest of you all can win now I was just going on his bragging it's been needing needs it but Jesus needs him now they tell me he's good at it don't get your little feathers ruffled out there and take that home with you Dodge one another we're being built up called higher loosen your belt unbuckle it like brother Greely saw in the spirit let it fall off of you you don't want to carry that heavy load slide 50 Mark 3 27 I'm almost done in the Amplified no one can go into a strong man's house and ransack his household goods right and left and sees them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man then indeed he may thoroughly Ponder his house the enemy can't just March in your door mistreat your wife and steal your drink your Pepsi Cola if he gets embarrassed because you are not the strong man you are supposed to be in this hour oh you're just really condemning oh no I'm telling you now is your opportunity to seize the moment batting down the hatches and quitting like men and raise up and ask the Lord to strengthen you so that the enemy he may knock he may stand in the window and threaten and huff and blow huff and puff and blow your house down but you just tell him no no you're on the outside looking in I'd rather be on the inside looking out than to be on the outside looking in you want to be in here you load down dirty Thief but the blood of Jesus has piped this place you're not coming in here if the enemy can bind the strong man he will come in and thoroughly plunder your life he will steal your dreams he'll steal your children he'll steal your health he'll produce a death structure all around you where Everything You Touch fails look Folk if you don't pay your tithes when you have tithes to pay the Bible said you're cursed with a curse you have already invited trouble in somebody said I'd be embarrassed to put a dollar in because I made ten dollars is all I made this week I'd be embarrassed to put a dollar in I want you to know in order to stay in right standing with God I'd make my daughter we'll buy the envelope I'd make my Thai check out or I'd make I'd find my dollar bill or my four quarters and I'd put them an envelope and I'd say Lord this is you and this is what you this is all I made this week ten dollars so I'm giving you the dollar come on because you don't want to invite the devil in you want to be in right standing with God somebody say oh you're just preaching on giving not really not really because God has shown us that he can stretch he can make a way we borrowed a little money that I had stuck aside and hoping that we would use it for insurance and we had to use it to finish out the Jerusalem payment but we I didn't even get or I just did it I had tucked it there for insurance it wasn't designated Jerusalem I had tucked it there for insurance but when we were a little short for truth I just untucked it put it over there and knew that God would make a way it's a little embarrassing to have to get up here and tell you that there's a need but it's the only way to see the need man because it's the way God takes care of his business if you can't help then you can't help and don't be condemned do what God requires first and then be ready to help when you can help but give him what belongs to him can I get any amens you give him well I couldn't make out an envelope for 50 Cent why these children do 40 cent in an envelope it's God's don't leave it in your semi-some I'll leave it in my pocket until I get more to go with it to put it in that's not what he says he actually says bring your tithe into the storehouse so when you come into the storehouse if you've had a time if you've had some Eco you need to give that to God you need to tithe on that if it's just a few won't he bless you you don't even have to preach this you just have to be reminded from time to time because we all know and we know what kind of church we're sitting in in Luke 11 21-22 Jesus spoke of the strong man who is prepared and armed to keep his home and protect his possessions but warns us like he did in Mark of what happens when a stronger than he comes in and I can show you that it's there when a strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divided dispose that's what the enemy would like to do for you can anybody tell the devil that he's defeated you're defeated you're defended I'm closing in a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 34. I'm skipping ahead just a little bit because I want to leave you with a quote I feel like I've been hitting all around and a little scattered but we just pulled a lot of things in here lay your hands

said I'm going to transfer to you the words to defeat Satan it sounds to me like it's it's not how carefully you rebuke him and call him out it's how carefully you commit your life and you confess and

us Lord you're moving in such a precious way we are preparing our hearts as we are coming to an end of the ten days of all trumpets to the day of atonement Yom Kippur these are the days of repentance these are the days of scouring out for it was only one day of the year that the high priest of the older Covenant would enter in behind the veil and offer the blood upon The Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant it was the only day that he was allowed in your presence As We Gather here Tuesday night we will be remembering that time but we are so thankful that you made a way for us to come behind the veil today and tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day nothing shuts us out but our own reluctance to come for we come not offering our own life as a witness but we come offering the Spotless blood of the Lamb the perfect and accepted sacrifice as we leave here today May the Holy Spirit seal in every touch I saw several receiving refillings of the Holy Ghost we have been praying for Jesse since he returned from this from the military service that you would stir up what you did for him before he left and we saw you doing that today and we give you the glory we give you the praise the honor belongs to the lamb and for every other person in this house that you minister to today we just want to say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and we want to say you are truly worthy of it all we love you for from you are all things and who you are all things you're dismissed to go in the name of Jesus you are worthy of it all foreign [Music] bring it back and we'll have an afternoon of food and fellowship come and be with us [Music] and you are all things oh you deserve the glory is [Music] worthy of it all forever [Music] you deserve the glory just for those of you who are going to linger here just a moment sister joshana has a testimony this is not the time maybe but thank you so much she sent warm homemade home-cooked tapioca pudding to my house last night and that was amazing praise standing over there was just overwhelmed with gratitude and thankfulness for all the Lord has done for me in the past few months so many of you have been part of that Journey so many of you have prayed prayed for me prayed for us prayed for Edith and God cares about the tiniest little details oh yes maybe this seems like a loose stuff somebody who always had a really good memory that's really frustrating and I was standing at the sink last night and I'm like Lord will you please just show me and he brought a picture before my mind of a bucket that I had been dipping out of I don't even remember the night that I'd been doing it and he said go get that bucket and have him open it in the morning the spoon will be in there and this morning I asked him to go open that bucket and he wanted to argue with me he said that's not in there please just go open the bucket it was in there and it just reminded me that that God care about the tiniest little bitty details and All of You prayed for my daughter who was colicky and screamed in pain for hours on end many of you came to my house and helped me hold her because she wouldn't let us lay her down it was hard and we had gotten to the point we didn't know what else to do the doctor was telling us one thing but the Holy Spirit kept telling us another thing and one day I was I was actually getting out of the shower and I was just like I hadn't been able to make it to church had been streaming and I text for the Shelly and I said will you please have prayer for my daughter I'm not there but she is and we can't keep waiting for her to quote outgrow what is a natural thing and I'm telling you God moved he did moved and I didn't even realize how quickly he'd moved until the end of the week after that prayer I realized she was drinking her bottle laying on her back that was not something she could do before the month was out there were no more colic episodes she's been a sweet happy shouty loud but happy and she'll she'll just she loves to be in the presence of the Lord and I'm sorry thankful for God answering prayer for myself for her the strength comes back little by little it's not as fast as I want it to be but I just wanted to say thank you Lord for your blessings on me amen thank you praise the Lord praise God amen second notice you're dismissed ago in the name of the Lord that was a good testimony to hear over time
