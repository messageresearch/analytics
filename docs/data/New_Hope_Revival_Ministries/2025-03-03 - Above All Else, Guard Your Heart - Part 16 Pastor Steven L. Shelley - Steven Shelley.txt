Title:    Above All Else, Guard Your Heart — Part 16 | Pastor Steven L. Shelley
Speaker:  Steven Shelley

========================================

Description:
This sermon examines how pride and haughtiness partner with offense to create spiritual strongholds in believers' lives. Using Ezekiel 28's account of Lucifer's fall as a biblical foundation, the message reveals how pride originated in heaven before manifesting on earth. Pastor Shelley explains that pride is not merely a personality trait but a spiritual force that deepens offense and creates resistance to correction. The path to freedom comes through genuine humility, seeking understanding of others, and continual dependence on God despite spiritual maturity or experience.

just a moment and we want to welcome all of the streamers who are streaming this morning is the only reason why I have the computer is just to take a quick glance because once I get started I totally forget to look but we welcome uh Saints in southern Norway we welcome Saints in South Africa in Indiana that's almost another country isn't it it the Netherlands we welcome uh Saints in Mammoth Springs Arkansas God bless you everyone uh more Saints in Arkansas Ghana God Bless you that's on that is on YouTube and do I I look like a grandp up here or something reading this more from South Africa and and one sister says it's 2: a.m. in Austria Australia excuse me 2: a.m. in Australia good morning and they're streaming the service today God bless you richly we appreciate that sister Claudia is streaming and I I assume maybe still from from South America I'm not really sure but we're just happy to be here in his presence he's good huh he's a good god he's good all the time isn't he I cannot get my I don't know why you all uh didn't wash your faces real good this morning you're so smudgy I I I can't hard I've used everything I know to use will you just hold on a minute they see my grandparents used to do this does that help isn't the Lord good you'll never find another church like this one the problem is I get warm and I have oils on from the top of my head to the SES of my feet and when they start sweating down my face uh they must get in my glasses and it's hard to get it off but we want to say that uh we're just thankful for the grace of the Lord and my kids have taken such good care of my boys and my daughter in in law or some people say in love or we'll just say bonus daughter they've taken such good care of me this weekend I did miss my wife and uh Olivia and Mariah but I didn't want for anything or lack for anything and even had a text yesterday that said you want me to come down and make you a cup of coffee and uh I'm just well taken care of spoiled I think is another way of putting it but anyway moving right along Cade's birthday is today and I'm glad he got to see his mom and dad uh for the weekend and there were special meetings there I streamed last night in a little piece of this morning a young brother from North Carolina uh was preaching the meetings his name is brother Seth coffee I don't know him I've never heard him Minister before but I sure appreciated the the demeanor and and and the sweetness and and humility of his delivery 30 years ago in the uh circles that I used to move in ministers were humble and they didn't think that they were't much and God used them in Mighty ways they didn't have to do a lot of disclaimers in those days you know apologize for having a dream or apologize for having a spiritual vision or they just told it and people chose to believe or not and I appreciated the Young Brother as he ministered last night he shared A tes Tony of their youngest baby I think maybe just a little over six months old little girl I believe and um she was uh tested for hearing in the hospital and was told that she completely failed in one ear and uh before they left the hospital they did another test and she failed again in that one ear and they seemed to be quite concerned about it and brother Seth was telling this test ony and he said I I just took the song I speak the name of jesuso and I just put that song right up to that ear that wasn't come on now boy I about jumped out of my chair but I might would have hurt myself because it's not the kind that you do like this any it's all remote control so I had to get my but I had to get my remote to get up or I might trip getting out of it but anyway I wanted to get up so I just kind of jumped up and down in the recliner you ever never mind I got so excited he said I just put that song up I just want to speak the name of Jesus and he said Lord I'm speaking your name I'm letting your name be declared in that ear I'm believing you are the same Jesus what kind of Miracles could we see if we believed he was the same we say we believe it but if we really really believed it I wonder what we would see the Lord do and he said I just believe that you're the same God today that you always were and that you are able to heal my daughter and he I don't know how many times he did that but the the first checkup back uh his wife went he wasn't maybe I think it didn't sound like he was able to go and they tested that ear and it not only passed but passed at the highest percentage totally well totally healed Skeptics might would say well it was just a fluke well it could have been once but they did it twice and there is something in me that chooses to believe I would rather believe it's easier for me to believe that it was a miracle it is it's easier for me to believe it was a miracle than than a a malfunction of the equipment or operator error I believe God did exactly what that little brother believed him to do and I was happy that our girls could sit under that kind of just real humble Ministry and he preached on uh an opportunity uh not missing your opportunity with the Lord and He preached about Jesus sitting with dirty feet and here come a woman in who didn't miss her opportunity Jesus spoke to to Simon who the the owner of the party the house and and he said uh this woman from the time I've come in she has not ceased to anoint my feet with ointment you didn't give me a greeting you didn't welcome me you you didn't anoint this was the customary way of welcoming an invited guest into your home you didn't do that but this woman someone said well if he was a prophet he would have known you know what kind of woman that was he knew the reality is it didn't matter anymore she didn't miss her OPP wasn't that great somebody said well that's just so simple well that's about what we need in the hour we're living in we we we really do if if th brother random talked about the preacher and he said if he to went up like he come down or come up like he went up down or however it went if he would have been as humble in the beginning if we would you and I look what God could do so we just send out a happy birthday to Kate even though he's not here tomorrow is Brother David and sister Deborah gosman's uh wedding anniversary they are longtime streamers and uh have never visited us yet you heard that and we're just hoping and believing that 2025 would be the year that that they would find the opportunity to come and be with us so that you all could meet them they extremely faithful people in every way and we wish them a very happy anniversary Wednesday is Pastor Ryan Jasper's birthday and although he's not a part of this congregation they pray for us in that church and I would like for us to pray for him and for them that God would move mightily Friday is the minko anniversary did you all know it you better you better know it both of you better know it is it eight years they're adding you need

Saturday next Saturday is stepen Yantis his birthday would you tell us how many since we've all lost track well I'll just look it up buddy 30 I fix to say whoa time really flies 25 do you know how young that is still great day in the morning 25 I'm I know this belt I have own's 25 years old or more God is good happy birthday Stephen let's stand for the reading of God's word I know that Austin is delighted to have his mom and dad in the service with us also Austin and Mia is that right brother uh brother and sister Hodes uh are here from a long way away let's welcome them praise God would you look at Proverbs Chapter I'm just going to look at you through the glare that's all I know to do at this point um Proverbs chap 16 and verse 18 just one verse it says Pride goeth Before Destruction and un huy spirit before uh a fall I I would was going to look at that verse in other translations I did and I was going to mention one or two if I needed to this morning but oddly they all just about said the same thing which is always a good thing because it means that it means that the translators of the King James were sticking very close to the original language in this particular case one uh one translation might have been uh Dr Stern complete Jewish Bible uh he said that the word could either mean fall or failure I like that because that's what a fall is pride goeth Before Destruction and an huy spirit before a fall or a failure now look at Ezekiel with me just a moment chapter 28 we are in a series above all all else I think we're how many in quite a few in uh we'd have to look on the app I don't remember how many this particular part of the series is a comprehensive teaching on the spirit of offense and another subcategory we are talking about the characteristics and strongholds of offense and what it can do in a believer's life now we have finished anger and temper we studied both temper and Temperance what was Temperance Temperance was self-control wasn't it and today we're going to begin to look at a deadly Trio when pride and haughtiness are partnered with offense it becomes a road to bondage and deception so that is the subtitle of the sermon this morning the deadly Trio Pride haughtiness partnered with offense it becomes the road to bondage and deception Ezekiel 28 beginning in verse 12 we'll read all the way to verse 19 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Ty and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou seest up the sum full of wisdom I'm not and Perfect full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz the diamond the barrel the onx The Jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created now let's catch just the latter part of that verse again the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created it sounds like Ezekiel is prophesying he is to an Earthly King he is but he is comparing him to another another being the king was born but this being was created and in him in his creation there were tabrets and pipes and they were prepared in him in the day that he was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee perfect in creation beautiful unique unusual I haven't read of any other creature being created with music in his body because of that it is believed that Lucifer had something to do with perhaps leading the host in worship to the great king if you look at this in the Hebrew it indicates that as he moved there was a sound think of this that emitted from his body like beautiful music unto the Lord I've never seen a creature like that he was perfect in all of his ways from the day that he was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou Hast sinned therefore I will cast thee as a profane out of the Mountain of God you're out of here and I will destroy thee oh whole covering cherub now to the commentators who would speculate that he is only speaking to an Earthly King it just doesn't fit it just doesn't fit I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee all covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire verse 17 thine heart was lifted up hear us this is the very definition of pride the lifting up of the heart when you begin to lift up your own mind will and emotions that's what it means when when you begin to walk a certain way because you think you are somebody or you have arrived when you begin to uh treat others like you're the big eye and they're the little 's you are mimicking the behavior of this cherub we are we have some of us have been guilty at times in our life maybe all of us to a certain extent I know I know women who are humble in every way except their recipes so proud that's my recipe well it may be yours now but unless you created it from scratch somebody else had it too you know well I don't want anybody to know because what's in it because then they'll bring it to the church dinner what's wrong with having two so so I just want you to know you can have pride in the in your in your automobile you can have pride in your recipe you can have pride in your little Instagram world you know this beautiful world that you pose for God sees it and when you get Pride mixing together partnering together with a wound with an offense it becomes a stronghold and what the prophet tells us then is you will begin to worship the spirit remember the man that fell at his feet he said the the reason why he was in that condition is he had worshiped the spirit that had possessed him that doesn't mean he said oh uh you precious wonderful spirit that has possessed me it means that he began to take pride in his opinion in his Outlook in the way he's always done it I'm going to preach so get in here now while I'm you're standing well so am I thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou Hast defiled thy sanctuaries not mine thine you have defiled my sanctuaries is the Lord talking by the multitude of thine iniquities created first in Perfection and then iniquity was found by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee right out of the creation itself there will come a fire and it will I will devour it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee one of these days he's he's cast out already but one of these days you're going to walk by wag your head and Mock and you're going to say you mean to tell me that's the devil that harassed the Bride of Jesus Christ and shook the kingdoms and nations of the world and they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore does that sound like total Annihilation to you you're never going to be anymore Lord we need you today we we are addressing offense we have all been offended we have been wounded the deepest wounds that we have received have not been from the those that hated us they have been from those who loved us from those that we loved the deepest scars that we carry most of us are Church scars Church hurts Church wounds and it has misaligned and misshaped many of us until we cannot be guided we cannot be pastored we cannot be instructed but Lord we have come come to the understanding that if we're going to win we got to win this last battle this last battle and it's fought in the mind in the mind and so Lord we've come back to you to address our hurts our wounds those that we have not yet been able to turn loose of and we have seen that in Anger when anger gets connected and now we're going to look at when pride gets connected it becomes a stronghold and uh we could die this way if it were not for your mercy but in your mercy you have said I'm going to have a people who win the last battle the battle that started in heaven and is now on Earth you said I'm going to have a people that'll win it well in order to win that we've got to depend on you like never before we want to say today we need you not ashamed to say we've got to have you not just on Sunday and Tuesday but on every day and every hour and every moment of every day come Lord bring us together into a place of Faith pull that you can Minister and help us with these things and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said am amen can you put the title up you may be seated can you put the title up that that is a when you get the when you get the notes and yes several have asked yes you can have the notes the reason why I haven't given to you uh them to you already is because I've started more than one set of documents and and then I have to go back and put them all together so uh when I do that you can have them all we can have them in an ebook form or however you want them and you'll have the scriptures and the quotes and and the and some of the thoughts and I I pray that it will continue to help you in the future so we're looking at a a second set of spirits and influences that that like to operate together we're looking at prideful Behavior arrogance haughtiness self-centered focus a focus on self partnering with the spirit of Pride now that seems so complicated but we're we've lived it so so don't get caught up in the semantics of what we're trying to describe it's a deadly Trio that I want you to know when when pride is involved offense goes deeper right because when you think you're right and everybody else is wrong not even the Bible can help you it it because you're that pride has become such a stronghold that that you're like the rest who say it don't really mean that I know it couldn't possibly mean that and and they're worse people are worse with the quotes than they are with the scripture worse they will take a paragraph a piece of a paragraph out of context that has no root no Foundation at all all in the scripture and they will say things like his opinion means more to me than anything else well I want you to know something you're not going to make it on opinion let's be bold you're only going to make it by the word that's the only way we can make it so don't take things out of context leave them in there and you'll be able to understand what he said uh we don't want to do that because we want every bit of this I just don't believe somebody said to me recently I just don't believe we're going to get all this sorted out in our life before the Rapture well we are because he's not coming back for a handicapped bride he's not coming back for a people who couldn't overcome the spirit of the age if there's anything I know about what the bride is destined to do the prophet said she is destined to overcome the spirit of her age and if you don't think that offense and pride and people's rights my rights and your rights if you don't think that's a part of the last age you you didn't hear the sermons he told us that that that spirit of leoda it's the age of people's rights and and demanding their rights and that's where we are uh it's it's one thing for that to go on out there it's another thing for that to go on in the bride amen if you are laboring under offense you're not overcoming I'm going to be bold this morning if you're laboring under anger and temper you are not overcoming not now you may overcome tomorrow but why don't we start practicing today there's no condemnation in this this is simply my position what I've been called to do and that is show the house to the house and whoever desires to hear this it's there it's available I I get I get shocked every week with people who reach out and say I've been streaming for three years been streaming for two years we've never heard from them didn't know they were out there and they begin to unfold the testimony of what God has been doing in their life that's precious but our focus is here this is our number one responsibility and that is that all of us I will will I believe I believe that this is to be an overcoming people we can't overcome what we don't understand we can't overcome what we don't recognize if we keep putting ourselves out and shoveling it like this you know we're we're amening but we're dropping amen bombs cuz we want somebody else to hear it well if you'll hush they'll hear it it's not the it's not the verbal amen we're running after but I do need them by the way it helps me keep moving but it's a heart's amen it's the amen that says me and Jesus can do this we can get out from under the heaviness of offense we can get out from under Pride if I were to ask around this room who is living in a stronghold of Pride very few people would be proud enough to say me but the reality is pride is so much more than what we have thought what if I told you that there's a portion of depression that's directly related to Pride I I didn't say all depression but there's a portion of depression because what the enemy desires to do is have you to focus on you woe is me nobody understands what I'm going through and we may think that that is pitiful humility but no no no what it really is is false humility and false humility is pride we have not began to overcome these things until we can see ourselves as part of a body as part of a team if one succeeds we all can succeed if one fails we all take the failure because it's our it's our responsibility to help that one to restore that one to get up and go on they may never have the pulpit but they can have the victory the personal victory over everything the enemy has used to trip and trap them amen so we're going to go on now I want to introduce this by just telling you a few things about uh about pride pride haughtiness and arrogance are spiritual forces it's not personality quirks it's spiritual forces that seek to work together partner with an offense leading the believer into deception and bondage I don't know if it's always deception and then bondage sometimes it's bondage and then deception but the enemy wants to deceive now ultimately we know that he cannot deceive the bride but the scripture says that he would deceive the elect if it were possible what he can do is dissuade us discourage us and cause us to believe a lie and whether that lie is about the word whether that lie is about the church Church whether that lie is about the prophet or the or your pastor or whether that lie is about you a lie is a lie is a lie and a lie is deception it might be 99% truth but if there's 1% untruth it becomes a deception and I would like to say to the body that you and I believe things about ourselves that is a deception we believe things about ourselves it's just simply not true and uh someone recently uh said you know about I I I I need strength over a certain thing and I felt the unction of the Lord you you you are that you you are that listen everything you you want to be and need to be you are walking in the potential of it spiritually now you're walking in the potential of it now and there's prob only one thing in the way of you being able to be that that God said you were to be not your church your pastor your belief system your Pew neighor it's you it's me I'm in the way of me being what God and you in the way of you being so as we learn these things and we begin to practice the practical ways the Bible has told us and the message has told us that we can overcome we want everything to be Supernatural sometimes the word becomes a supernatural Revelation to us and then we have to be practical about applying what God has supernaturally made real to our spirit so the the application the doer the hearer being able to hear the word with Revelation with with understanding that's a blessing but that's actually the easy part it's easier to receive a revelation than to do one than to be one so it's not the hearing only it's the doing and that's how this little bride is going to move we're going to hear it and we're going to find his grace and strength to do it and there's going to be a people right here and all over this world in pockets of believers who will carry an unoffendable nature somebody said where's the Bible for that here it is great peace have they which love the law of God and nothing shall by any means nothing nothing shall by any means means offend them there it is now if that if the Bible says it somebody's going to live it me I'm going to live it and your heart ought to be saying me I'm going to live it let me be an anomaly Let Me Be Misunderstood let me be whatever but Lord let me be one of those who can live an undefendable life because if you can live an undefendable life you can overcome pride and anger and temper and rejection that orphan Spirit you can get out from under the twisting of python the squeezing of Python and the twisting of leviathon in the scripture those spirits that the Bible gives them names simply so that we can see how the enemy desires to use something listen listen he doesn't have to harass the addict with these issues he's got them with other hooks it's the believer it's the believer 10,000s times 10,000s of spirits l Bo not on the World At Large he said on the bride you're fighting you're fighting 10 times 10 thousands of thousands multitudes of demonic spirits loosed in the last age to cause you and I to lose focus on Jesus Christ to cause us to take on social issues that have nothing to do with the word that cause us to feel like we're called to the defense of a man when we're not called to defend a man we're called to defend the word men are fallible all of them but God is Not fallible he is infallible he's infallible in creation and he is infallible in you The God Who lives In You by the Holy Spirit cannot fail but the enemy wants you and I to fall to fail well goody devil we're not going to do it we're going to overcome so pride and haughtiness and arrogance you can leave these things up until we move on for for not takers but again you can have it later our spiritual forces that work together with offense leading the believer into deception and bondage somebody said well I'm having a little problem of you you know putting all I thought this was just you know little sins or little attitudes or things that get on let me tell you something anything that promotes unbelief in you is a force working under the two forces one of the two the light the good and and the bad the dark brother Bram said God and the devil the word and the devil and we also know that whichever do we feed is the one that's going to bark the loudest and it's the one that's going to lead our life hello so we can have the V I just want you to know when you get in the thick of this that you're not being condemned from this pull pit you are being exposed because that's what the word comes to do but the same word that exposes that cuts that that sharpens is the same word that empowers that strengthens that lifts us up into the place of an overcomer Hallelujah where it just don't matter just don't matter I don't I don't want you to get so caught up in the in the politics of America there are things that just don't matter they matter in the natural perhaps but they matter some of them matter very little in the spiritual so you pray for for the body you want to pray for something pray for the body of Christ pray for the believer pray for your brothers and sisters your fellow pilgrims on this journey that all of us can get our head above the fanaticism of Leo deia embrace the engrafted word if you didn't read the devotional this week read it well I started to read it but it it seemed like it was just a repeat it is based on the sermon that you're hearing but what we have come to find out is the way to drive truth deeper into the recesses of the brain is to readdress them you know I'm not a marketer but a marketer would say repackage but readdress them and so that's what we're trying to do we're doing it in Clips we're doing it in memes we're doing it in moments we're doing it in devot tionals we're doing it by posting the entire sermon not because we have a something to promote what we have to promote is not Shelly what we have to promote is the word of God and if others don't want to do it if they're ashamed of what they have to say and they're hiding it because they're worried about casting Pearl Before Swine I want you to know there comes an hour that the plum line has to drop and people have a choice to make so we want to we want to keep coming to you so don't think and and by the way if you didn't read the devotional it was a little longer it took me forever to get through it but it was a little longer than normal and if you didn't there there is material in there that I didn't get to in the sermon so you might catch something that would be of a blessing to you we're overcoming minute by minute in it Greater is he than he that's in the world all right so the Bible warns us so please understand this isn't just personality quirks it's Spirits it's forces of hell that want to wrap you up they can't change your destiny if you ever were you always will be if he had you in your mind his mind you're still on his mind you saw your choice before you ever made it I don't believe in extreme Calvinism I don't believe God lined us up against the wall and said you will you won't you will you want I know that's how they preach it a lot around the message that's not what brother Brandon was preaching he said it's got to be scriptural and predestination is by forn knowledge it means by what God knew about you before you were ever born he knew your choice before you ever made it when we say we didn't have a choice we lie against the word we did have a choice he knew what our choice would be so he brought us to a place in life where we could make it woo Hallelujah so if he knew me that way that means he didn't just know my beginning it means he also knew my ending he knew my my past before it was my past my present before it was my present and my future before it was my future can you say amen amen the Bible warns against these attitudes and they're more than that as they often blind individuals to correction and keep them from walking in humility before God there's no pleasure in having to correct Believers I'm not just talking about what a preacher can do or what a pastor can do I'm talking about look folks the word corrects me every day of my life I I had a a message come in on messenger at 3 something this morning you didn't you didn't get up and read it at 3 something this morning no I have notifications turned off just like you do I hope and I have it set so that if it's pardon and it's from a list of of church people like a call or a or a te it'll come through but otherwise it won't but when I woke up at 6:30 I ask the Lord Lord I want to get up at 6:30 and it's 6:30 on the dot he woke me up he's better than a Time clock or a alarm clock woke me up at 6:30 I rolled over to check the time yes Lord thank you Jesus 6:30 on the dot and I saw a notification and someone sent a notification and they and they were talking about some sermons that they had heard uh have you learned to love you remember those and in the expression of their thanks they mentioned a quotation and it may have come from someone of other Faith or other persuasion I don't I don't know I didn't look it up and to be honest with you at this moment I didn't even really care it's it so impacted me it corrected me and it impacted me the truth will correct us daily if we let him it's a person amen do you believe that and it talked about the highest form of love being an understanding trying to understand a person it hit me so hard I said Lord I wish I would have thought of that I wish I would have thought of that all through my life when I when I struggled to love or when I struggled to embrace or when I struggled to have real Fellowship it's simply because I realize now it's because I didn't try hard enough to understand what's going on in somebody's head sometimes we we think that someone is arrogant when in all actuality they're so absolute uh inferior they have such inferiority complexes and they feel so insecure that they put on this air and it looks like arrogance when sometimes it is simply survival have you ever known a situation like that and so I want to understand I don't want to misjudge I want to understand if you love somebody just take this home with you if you love somebody you seek to understand them I spoke to a couple this week who are planning their future and I think I might have been supposed to mention that but I didn't yet and one of the things I said to them is and you all know this we give and receive love differently you know uh psychologists tell us that men and women aren't even from the same Planet well we know we didn't come from planets but we know that in in in our wiring and in our makeup we're not the same somebody ought to say thank God it's a good thing we're not all wired the same and if we don't seek to understand the other especially the one who lives in the house with us we will continue to push them in a wrong way and and in a negative way and in a hateful way I wish you were listening instead of in a loving way and I receive love a certain way and my wife receives love a certain way and she gives love a certain way and I give love a certain way the problem in a lot of homes is that people are if you said well do you love her of course I love her but she's not getting the message you're telling me but she's not getting the message because you're not trying to understand how she receives love and if you think it's because you go go to work every day she's just uh just sitting there feeling so loved that's not the way it works she appreciates you going she appreciates the money you make she better if she's not working she's certainly better but but that's not the first thing that comes to her mind that's not the first thing that makes her feel loved it doesn't have to be a diamond ring that's Pride doesn't have to be a Hut Rod but she's got a way that when that is said or that happens it registers I'm loved the sooner that you can discover what gives her that message and send it as often as you possibly can the happier your life will be and vice versa but we've got some mules are you going to be offensive well just be glad I said a mule we've got some mules They Don't Really Care well I you know I don't you know I I I don't I don't have time for all this Hocus Pocus and and I love her and if if my paycheck don't let her know I love her and I give her a house if that don't that don't tell her I love her well you know I don't know what to do come on but don't be surprised when she has a headache a Perpetual one that never goes away Amen brother you know it it it doesn't always have to be a $100 bouquet a drugstore Carnation there there are women I want you to know there's some high price women in this world few few in the church and they may not get excited over a carnation but there are women here that would be so wives here that would be so delighted you stop to get gas and you just run in I know it's extra you pay it to pump you could just make it very quick but you run in and you get one those flowers sitting at the counter just in a bucket sometimes about half faded you bought that or a candy bar she doesn't really need a candy bar but on occasion just the thought do you understand what I'm saying just the thought and people don't want to do the work to build relationship not only husbands and wives but friendships the world has cheapened the whole idea of friends I've got 5,000 plus friends on Facebook whoop he do how many of them are going to come to my rescue how many of them are really going to pray for me I don't mean just praying hands I mean on their face my God I'm calling out to you for my brother other so don't let friendship be cheapened in your mind because of the world we're living in right now build relationships strong ones that Satan can't get between he will if you let him if if we seek to understand one another and and catch a glimpse of each other's heart we would know that as brothers and sisters I'm I'm always impressed with Nathan when he prays I'm always impressed that every time he meet mentions this body of Believers he chokes up this precious family of God the Saints of the Lord in this place and he chokes up I like it it reminds [Music] me when I have spent 15 hours in counselling from Sunday night until I see you again on Tuesday night and I'm wore out with people problems just be honest sometime not all the time but sometime and to hear Nathan get up and say oh God I just want to thank you for this body of Believers and choke up it's it's like a good a good piercing it strikes my heart and I remember who we are and who I am and what my responsibility is and I remember the reality that you're the most valuable I want you to know you're so valuable in the economy of God your you matter your feelings matter your needs matter because you're precious to him you you you're precious to us and we need to see each other that way seek to understand the weirdnesses and the wonkiness of of each other's life and and be willing to help pray him through it or pray her through it to the next Victory we're going higher because the word is going higher Hallelujah well that's my story and I'm sticking to it this study examines how these Spirits operate and how Believers can overcome them through biblical truth and through spiritual discernment we need to we need not just preachers not just fivefold ministers we need the Discerning of spirits in our individual lives the Bible tells us I know that many people have put the gifts on the shelf and out the door in the back room until they no longer exist but the Bible tells us and if brother brandham truly preached what Paul preached if he truly preached what Paul preached and I believe he did then we can't make him say what Paul didn't say about the same subject you don't have to say Amen you don't have to say Amen there are thousands and millions perhaps screamed out we're counting on that you see we forget that little tiny quote where the the prophet reminds us that that seventh angel messenger when when the messenger of the seventh angel uh is on the scene he said he will have no message of his own right nothing new isin't that interesting he is to tie together his message is the tying together of all the Loose Ends of all the other Church ages isn't that marvelous that God would send the seventh the completion the Perfection and it would simply be the weaving together of truths that weren't fully known fully revealed fully explain and and God would use one under the spirit of Elijah who was a tishbite the tishbites were Weavers one who would weave together these little uh ends and pieces and make us a picture of Jesus Christ like has never been seen before because each age was just getting a piece you come down to the seventh age and you've got all the pieces coming together and and Jesus is no longer behind the lattice somebody ought to hear him he's no longer behind the lattice he's now coming around in plain view who is this that I see coming out of the Wilderness leaning on his beloved her excuse me leaning on her beloved it's the bride leaning on the groom and you notice the scripture tells us she smells like him you ever hugged a sister hugged a sister and you could go on out in the toward the car and you still smell her perfume sometimes I can smell your perfume up here and that means you put on too much it's just supposed to linger when you when you walk away just the just the light fragrance of it's supposed to just through the air it's so much better than some things we can smell she smells like him because she's been leaning on him because she's been depending on him because she's kept her head on his chest as often as she possibly can and now she carries his fragrance sister Anita wrote the song which is a mixture it's myrr and alows it's myrr and sweet calamus it's it's bitter and it's sweet because this life is a the revelation of Jesus Christ in your life is is a is a a life of both suffering and blessing if you didn't suffer and you didn't know his Blessing you wouldn't smell like him Lord I want to smell like you in a in a stinky World in a stinking family in a stinking Society I want to smell like him are you with me the first sin didn't take place in Earth the first sin the first Rebellion the first failure took place in heaven God didn't he wasn't shocked it didn't take him by surprise he knew when he created that creature so beautiful so lovely so Deon Aire so so intricately designed and made that when he moved sound glorious sound emitted from his physical anatomy in some way that we don't understand like a human music box or something the the that word there we'll look at it in a moment it it helps us to see but it was in his heart that iniquity that transgression was found and uh although we can't particularly say that God put it there we know that he knew it was there and was probably there in his mind all along not yet manifesting someone said what how would you make such a a statement like that because brother brandom connected Judas to the Antichrist didn't he and when he goes back to the Garden he talks about Cain who was of the wicked one and when he refers back to that betrayal he talks about the fact that he was a devil from the beginning that means god knew what he was when he made him right you follow that in the message that day on Calvary let's look at this and sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven Lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his Disobedience before he ever struck the Earth and that would have been in the fall sin began in heaven where God put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge that means he gave the Angels the ability to choose the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when Lucifer was given the pinenes to make his choice he wanted something better than God had right Isaiah tells us Ezekiel tells us and when Lucifer was given the pinenes to make the choice his choice he wanted something better than God had that started the trouble are you following him he said and there was a requirement for sin the requirement was death death was the penalty and that is we could go into great details of this because I do not believe that there is but one death there is one life are you following and I believe a man that has eternal life can never die and I believe there is a complete annihilation of that soul that sins we don't have to argue over it because the Bible said so doesn't it the soul that sinth shall surely die it's good to understand what the soul is and what the spirit is the soul that sinth it shall surely die not the man the soul that sinth so Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed how I dis dis agree with the universalists that say that Satan will be saved I I'm amazed to know that that lie was operating in the 50s and 60s sometimes it's called now universalism and has some ultimate reconciliation and and and it has some other uh other words it means that everyone will be saved in the end and even the devil will repent and and uh you know brother Bram said well if he would and get baptized in Jesus Jesus name he wouldn't be the devil anymore he'd be your brother but that's not going to happen because he has sined and he's judged for it and his death is imminent somebody said imminent well we know it's not coming for after a thousand you you don't understand those thousand years that's well anyway not now he sinned and he's the originator of sin and his soul sin and he was a spirit that Spirit shall be totally annihilated to be nothing left of it and that's only how the spirit in Soul are connected if indeed in Lucifer they're connected that way then they both would cease to exist in your life as a Believer your regenerated Spirit your spirit that has been resurrected into the life of Jesus Christ that can never die that's what the word said let's go on please and I I believe a man that has eternal life can never die I believe in complete annihilation of the soul that sin now Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed and and his soul sin and he was Spirit I'd got to the end already that Spirit shall be totally annihilated there be nothing left of it now look at Ezekiel 28:12 with me just a moment this is scripture son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Ty I read it all in the beginning now we break it down and say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God thou sealeste sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty now let's break that down just a moment the phrase thou seest up the sum means thou art a pattern of perfection in thine own conceit for a seal hath in it the perfect form of him that is thereby represented Sealth up the sum literally means Thou Art the one sealing the sum of perfection a sum is the answer in an equation where there are many things being added together let's say so we're adding and adding and adding adding and adding and then we come to the sum and the sum is the totality of each of those different digits that have come together to form so the sum is always greater than the individual digits right so that word translated to sum is telling us that Lucifer was the sum he was the Seal of the sum which means he was the completion of perfection in a created being that's important to know because brother vandom says in some ways he was co-equal with God and the critics are taking him to task all over the Internet for making such a statement he gets the statement from from the very meaning of this verse you are the Seal of the sum sealeste sum literally Thou Art the one sealing the sum of perfection a thing is sealed when completed the sum implies the full measure of Beauty from a Hebrew root to measure the scripture is saying you were the most beautiful thing you were the sum of all Beauty the sum of all intelligence think of this when God was creating he placed perfection in Lucifer I I don't know if there's anybody anywhere else other than around this message that even takes that verse as literal as brother brandham did but it's important to look at it that way thou art a finished pattern thou sealeste thine own likeness thou Forest a portrait of thyself and H has represented thyself the Perfection of wisdom and Beauty that's your enemy that's your enemy and even though he has now fallen from both Beauty and Perfection he's still drawing himself the same way God Drew him you you understand that he was once if you would have seen a picture of him you would have said oh that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen but now he's fallen his Beauty has failed him his wisdom has failed him his Perfection has failed him and if you could see him in his reality In His Image now it would be the most hideous awful pitiful pathetic creature that you ever laid eyes on in your life but that's not how he draws himself he's still drawing himself you know when I when I read the real meaning of this verse I could just imagine the enemy you know the devil Lucifer uh hiring people to draw his part portrait he's hanging it in the in the anals of hell and yet it's not reality it's not what he looks like now if somebody would give him a mirror he'd know that he doesn't look like Beauty anymore he doesn't look like Perfection anymore he looks like all that is filthy all that is ungodly all that is Unholy and he wants to put that image on you and he wants to put that image on me but we refuse it don't we because we're wearing another another measure we're wearing another portrait we're wearing another image we've been changed by by the one we have looked upon we've looked upon real Perfection yes praise His name now in the message questions and answers one of the questions and answers 1959 look at what brother br says paragraph 85 he said now watch the evil controls of this world now as we read from Ezekiel 28:12 that's where we just read son of man I'm going to read it again in the quote son of man take up a lamentation under the king of Tyrus I may have it out of order but I thought it was right there with it Austin and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God now watch he's speaking to the spirit of the king he said see thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the sun brother brandham quoting full of wisdom perfect in Beauty and then he says this Satan see there how Satan was the most beautiful of the archangels so he is acknowledging that Ezekiel 28:12 is describing Lucifer in his original creation as an archangel but the most beautiful of all the AR AR angels and the wisest of all the creatures that God had created now look at verse 13 Ezekiel 28 just jump over here now thou Hast been in Eden I'm going to wait on you to pull up Ezekiel 28:13 please thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering so he is's wearing some sort of garment some some kind of outer something with precious stones on it maybe something like we imagine when we think about the breastplate of the high priest where these beautiful valuable stones were placed and in behind the urm and the Thim was there glor glorious beautiful Stones it seems that Lucifer was wearing some outer covering some garment that was made of all of these beautiful stones that we read to you already and gold and then he says the workmanship of thy say that word tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created there's just no way to make that symbolic he was somehow made with a representation of both tabrets and pipes well we've got to know what that even means so we look at the Hebrew maaka is is workmanship maaka and it means occupation work business could be political could be religious it means someone having the ability to create something or to administer something then we look at the word tabrets which is the word that we get timberl tambourine from or pipes literally it means tabrets literally means holes in the musical pipes or flutes now if you've ever played a woodwind instrument you understand that there is a hole for for the re for the mouthpiece and there are holes that control the note and the tone and there is a hole that the sound comes out of so look looking at this you I I know this in itself may not be that interesting but please bear with me looking at that in in uh the original gives us this idea that in him there were pipes and there was even some sort of orifice some sort of hole that music sound float out of I want you to know all the other Angels they must have marveled they must say who is this dude I mean really you know he thinks he's something he was he was all the other Angels had to say holy holy holy but it sounds like I'm just telling you what the scripture I I don't I don't get it all totally I'm not trying to do it well brother BR didn't mention why do you well he quoted the scripture everybody else had to sing Holy Holy Holy every other angel had to play a harp or whatever else they played and yes it does mention that in scripture but but not Lucy somehow he was created to be an expression oh my had he remained pure perfect beautiful and wise just like God made him he would have been our example in how to glorify the Lord because the Bible tells us let everything that hath breath so everything that you are is involved in your worship come on that's why sometimes we move our hands and people think we've lost our mind I can't help it when the wind is blowing I'm blowing with it that's all I know somebody said well I see some of those people they're praising the Lord they look like they've got a tomahawk don't worry about it not cause we're Brave fans there's just something sometime you pick up you catch in a current of the spirit you would have to have a glimpse of Eternity eternity you'd have to have a glimpse of Throne Room worship to even be able to understand that even the movement of the Heavenly Host shifts and changes the atmosphere on planet Earth so every time you pray as it is in heaven so let it be in Earth you coming into agreement with the two worlds with the two Dimensions whatever is Heaven's mind let it be executed on the earth whatever is going on in the throne room of our God let us experience a a a piece of that when we worship may we not come like dead dried up Methodist who've had no birth Earth may we come into His presence like men and women and boys and girls who have been born out of something and born into something we've been born out of society we've been squeezed out of the system of the world we have been pushed out of the spirit of the age but we have caught a glimpse of who we really are we're Heaven's children yes sons of the most high God there is no God like unto our God there is no God like unto our God that David said among the gods meaning among the gods that are worshiped there's only one true Living God but don't tell me there's only one God because a God is what you make you know all that it takes to be a god is to be worshiped so football is a God to some anybody with me you'd think it was 3:00 we hadn't even got into Sunday night's message yet a a car there's nothing wrong with you driving a nice car I like to drive one new enough that I can take it back to to him I had one before this one only had it a couple years transmission went out it was a warranty issue they were going to put me a new transmission in but I was scheduled to preach in North Carolina the next day can I have a rental yes but it'll have to be a Ford well that's what I drive but they didn't have any Forge like I drive available they had one of them little cracker boxes I said oh no no no no I can't take my family to North Carolina and that my suitcase won't fit in the back seat much less my family so what will I do I reached out to my salesman and and he said I have a feeling that I can put you on top of this and save you money too I said let's try it and we did nothing wrong with driving a nice vehicle it's nice to be able to take it back and have it service when it needs to be serviced and traded when it needs to be traded but if that becomes your focus in life I've had the new one and I've had the jalape I know I know if that becomes your focus that becomes a god among all the gods that are worshiped there is no God among the gods like our God he deserves more than just a Hallelujah anyhow he deserves a purpose he deserves a an intentional praise oh I I like I see people doing this sometime in church you you you've got the hand up right you got part of the action right what's this going on down here you're checking your manicure looking where to chew next the problem with that is the like I said the the you know the position of the body is right something's missing it's not the fact you don't have to have both hands up all the time but whatever you're doing with this one it doesn't need to be anything that causes you to focus here instead of to the one you're worshiping so I don't believe in that kind of you know that praise and worship becomes so common to us that we don't pay much attention to what we're listen he he doesn't want that kind that's will worship he's not looking the scripture tells us Paul he's not looking for for will worship he's looking for sincere worship someone who will take a chunk of their own life pull aside and give God glory and honor and praise because he's wonderful and worthy so he makes this beautiful creature and all he has to do it looks like is just move and God is praised and it's amazing and he's beautiful and he's perfect until until he wasn't so something about this workmanship and these these tabrets and you know a tambourine has Little Sim little symbols or like little castets and I don't know what he sound I can't hardly imagine it but I don't think the scripture is just speaking uh metaphorically here the the Hebrew is too straight it's too base to be metaphor only in the message separation from unbelief brother brandom says in paragraph 25 but you take the people the whole of America oh my they're well fed and purred and they don't have to worry about anything they got all the money they want thousands and millions of dollars making yearly and Fine Cars big summer homes and places and everything they don't have to worry what's religion to them just just a place to sit around some place to say well I belong to the church I may not have given it charity I'm thinking now I didn't go back and put some of these over forgive me I have to make two sets of notes and I didn't copy this over I don't thing maybe he said they don't have to worry what's religion to them anyway just a place to sit around some place to say well I belong to the church and they'll find the highest and most practical Church they can go to and did you know that's the very sign of Satan let me say that again he said and did you know that's a very sign of Satan if you're Church shopping by what it looks like on the outside if you're Church shopping by how Seeker sensitive it is how all tolerant and welcoming it is he said Why That's Satan very sign of Satan he said I hope we don't get rough about it but remember in heaven this is paragraph 25 of separation from unbelief 1955 0228 if you happen to see it he goes over in the north he he said I hope we don't get rough but remember in heaven what made Lucifer jealous he goes over in the north and puts him up a better Kingdom he wanted a bigger Kingdom more brighter better prettier the devil he says the devil always works in say it again say it one more time please the devil always works in Beauty now I didn't bring the quotations this morning but let me just say there are several places where brother random said a woman wants to be beautiful and there's nothing wrong with that he said and what he means by that is if that becomes her drive if that becomes her Focus then he'll tell you right away that's pride and there's something wrong some people think uh uh something like brushing their teeth is pride that's called hygiene that's called not knocking people down when you greet them that's called not making people gag when they hug you it's not Pride to brush your teeth if you brush them 50 times a day well that's a little odd two or three should be all right right I know most of you don't once a day is good if that right we know now that it's not just about having pearly whites it's about heart health we now know that the the the health of our mouth directly not indirectly directly affects the the health of our heart plaque and buildup in the gum travels through the bloodstream the world is talking about microplastics microplastics aren't the only thing transported through the bloodstream even Dental plaque can be so it's a good idea to brush your teeth some people believe to put on a little my my my granny called it mum I don't know if they make mum anymore some years ago I stopped using antip pers Sprint that's why I sweat like a mule I use a natural deodorant and and when you use a natural deodorant you can't put it on once a week you have to put it on at least once a day and if you're working maybe more than once a day is it pride not to want to stink not necessarily some people don't understand if a woman want want to to buy a a a blouse that that matches her skirt that's not necessarily Pride if brother Brandon was if he was okay with sear sucker jacket and another color dungar that's up to him I rarely saw a picture of him looking like that he was making a point he wasn't encouraging us to look tacky we should take a little bit in fact that word pride is one of the words in the Bible that can actually be applied positively as well it's okay for you to to do a good job and be excited that you did a good job it's all right for me to say to you I'm proud of work that you've done but when we take such pride in how we look or what we do that we leave out the most important part or we become like those Daughters of Zion I'm going to I wish I could have put them in the not wish i' have got them in the notes for today I mean the whole but I want everybody here for that Sunday because those daughters over there in scripture you know uh that that spend all their time on their on their trinkets on their earbobs and their and their bracelets and their anklets and their rings on every finger like gypsies I see people around this message that would fit more in a gypsy Camp than they do in a Holiness Church I'm I know brother Brandon made that little statement you know he said your husband give you a little chain or something that there's a problem with that and the problem is if you start appealing to that part of your nature sister you'll look like they do in some of the big churches around this truth it won't be just that thin little chain that your husband gave you as just a little token of his love anymore it'll be them big old dim store bobles that people wear now I could put pictures up from Facebook but then I'd have to blot out the faces for the brandom described it as people looking like they went through a dime store with the magnet on hello set plastic don't stick to a magnet and that's what a lot of it is you know trying to Bobble themselves out so that everybody you know says oh my what an outfit that's where pride gets involved these women walked a certain way you know so that they could attract I'm going to try to do it I don't have the hips for it my belly's too big my hips too narrow I I couldn't swing like that I might throw something out of place and have to see the chiropractor you know they put on these big old high heel shoes but that didn't I I learned a long time ago when when there was a time around the part of the message that I was around where where all the sisters wore you know rather flat shoes and I noticed that uh among the young people I preached a lot of youth camps in those days and I noticed you don't have to have high heels to twist like that you you you can wear flats or Barefoot and twist like a like a hoola hoola hula hoop it it can be a spirit on you so there are some things that we want to look at uh when we are talking about Pride that are negative but but I just want you to understand that he said it's a it's in a woman's nature to want to to be beautiful and her focus should be to be beautiful for her husband not for somebody else's husband oh there's so much to be said here you know in churches where they're so loose about things like this there's so much divorce and remarriage have you ever noticed that in churches that are loose about these things there's so many cases of divorce and remarriage right in the church have you noticed how they're rewriting marriage and divorce to suit their lust it is true if if a woman is is twisting her hips for somebody else's companion no wonder no wonder no wonder they're sneaking out together and no wonder these things are happening but but let's put all this in perspective uh uh when we have an opportunity to do so he said the devil always works in Beauty sure he does that's the reason Cain offered what he did for his offering he said but there was no Beauty in Abel bringing a lamb but Abel had a spiritual Revelation from God I'm hurrying and that's what God would be pleased with and as we have said only through spiritual Revelation can you ever know God don't read that too fast let's slow that down he said and as we have said only through spiritual Revelation can you ever know God you'll never know him by reading a book you'll never know him just by hearing a tape you'll only know him when he quickens to you by Revelation what you're hearing it becomes a part of who you are it becomes a revelation and that's how you know him you don't know him by this kind of knowledge you know him by this kind of knowledge are you here look at Ezekiel 28:14 we're taking this verse by verse I'll be done in a minute or two or three or four verse 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub we read it that coverthe have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that word cherub is the word that's used for Guardians of Eden they're not little babies in diapers with wings and harps floating around on your figurines The cherubs of the Bible are Mighty Guardians of the glory they don't look like little toilet paper advertisers rosy cheeks and fluffy bottoms and floating on clouds people collect those little impy looking things if you ever saw real cherub beim I promise you you wouldn't say oh oh it would strike Terror in your heart you'd say my God look at a warrior a guardian of the glory I want to be on his good side see and Lucifer was considered one of those like an archangel Guardians Of Eden flanking God's Throne as and as an image from hovering over the Ark of the Covenant remember their wing tips touched as they were uh Graven there molded there on the mercy seat that was the lid of the Ark of the Covenant and then we look at that word cover it Thou Art the anointed ch that cover it and that means to hedge to fence in to shut in to block the screen to stop the approach to shut off to protect you were the anointed cherub that coverthe one who guarded the throne and one who was there to protect to block to shut off he had responsibility didn't he yeah and yet he flaunted his beauty boasted of his wisdom until iniquity was found in his heart look at 28:15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found you say that perfect must not mean perfect it does look at it it's tomim it means complete whole entire s wholesome unimpaired innocent having Integrity what is complete entirely in accord with truth and fact that's what it means you are perfect Lucifer you are perfect whole completely in accord with God's truth and fact in in the message I got to move in the message the Seal of the Antichrist paragraph 17 and we'll nearly be through here my family was gone so I spent extra time if you'll notice I mean study and and now my my Fork is full and I and my time is gone if you'll notice just about the same time about the time that Jesus came on the scene Judas came on the scene the Antichrist the one was against Christ look at what he says Judas is one of the disciples here the prophet calls him an antichrist he said I want you to notice the nature of these Spirits now Judas was a religious man he was not an Infidel and all of us know that he was Antichrist now he's talking about an antitype of the Antichrist there is yet an antichrist to come but remember the scripture tells us the mystery of iniquity doth already work and so Judas was forerunning the one who would come we understand forerunners don't we he said uh if you'll notice he was not an Infidel all of us know that he was Antichrist he worked the very closest hand to Christ here brother brandham is calling Lucifer the right-hand man he's referring to Judas the right-hand man did you know that in heaven the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was was able to take something listen he was able to take something that God had created and pervert it back into an evil thing which started all this trouble I thought women started it all isn't that what they like to preach around the message don't they like to pick those little quotes and blame the women for every problem in the world but brother Ram said it started before that oh yeah he said that he said those things he said some things about women he wasn't talking about my wife he might have been talking about somebody's wife he wasn't talking about my wife my wife is a Blood Bought believer Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and filled with the Holy Ghost I'm sure brother Brandon wasn't talking about her when he said those things about a woman being lower down than a dog he could have only been talking about a fallen woman and we were all fallen and rotten and low down like dogs until we found Christ but there should be no sister in this house that feels like that is her or that he was describing you you are a prized listen when these things begin to come out and uh if you take these things out of context put them all in one document it's hurtful things I I've read them and even though the prophet said them they hurt hurt my own feelings reading them out of context will do that and when these things first started coming out and articles were being spread and so forth I sat at my dinner table on a Friday night weeping and I apologize to my daughters and to my wife for having to hear hear these things and in any way applying them to themselves because a sister in Christ is none of that and you are so far removed from that nature that that should never even cross your mind and if you're hearing a tape and that you hear that you should just let that go as though he was talking about somebody else because he is don't ever live under that kind of a burden that's right it is right and it should have been said a long long time ago in our churches he took that and that devil and he corrupted and perverted it back to an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what Satan done in his pride went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against Michael and his angels remember the Great War that happened in eternity he said the right-and man of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker partly equal with him only Satan could not you you need to remember that he never was a Creator he will never be a Creator all he can do is pervert what God created that's all he can do he can't create he's not all knowing he's not all powerful come on God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and perverted it back into something else he said notice when Cain and Abel very beautiful picture Cain and Abel was nothing more than a prefigure of Judas and Jesus now being uneducated like my brethren are educated he said I teach the scriptures from types and shadows and if I know what the shadow of anything is I'll have some understanding of it if I see what the shadow looks like I can pretty well tell what it's going to look like that's pretty good that's pretty good interpretation pretty good I like that a lot it's it's not a it's not an ignorant statement don't be fooled by somebody's lack of of Education because educated fools have made a hideous mess of God's word but a little Kentucky hillbilly if we could foresee by the shadow what these Evils are then we can pretty well tell what they're going to be when we look at them and without education then I have to teach it from typology Paul did a lot of that too did you know it in the book of Hebrews he absolutely did let's catch one more verse verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven musicians are coming how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer so if you thought in any way that this was talking about an Earthly King before please understand that it was much more than that how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the Nations I want you to look at the name Lucifer Lucifer is Hal it means lightbearer shining one morning star Lucifer Means Day star halil is from Halal which is halelu yah light unto God shine unto God if we would added the yah to his name he would have been God you would have been describing God calling him Lucifer but describing God bright One Shining one day star that was the meaning of his name in questions and answers final quotation for today paragraph 69 see Satan was the original Archangel of God he once dwelt in the heaven he once was the greatest person in the heavens outside of God he was God's right-hand man to Fellowship and he got puffed up in his heart now here's probably what happened he saw the look on some Angel's face when he was doing his doings he saw somebody looking at him and then he liked to perform hello so then he started doing what he was doing with mindfulness that he was being watched that's not what worship is when you start looking around to see who's watching you you might as well sit down this ain't no dance hall this is God's house you don't need to see who's watching you you better hope nobody's watching you because if they are you're a distraction ction hello it's just real isn't it but but somehow he he caught some some Angel's eye you know some some other created being is seeing him and boy then it got real serious then he really got dramatic fixing himself you know and then no doubt the Angels began to notice that he was getting too puffed up in his in his demonstration and they began to look away he was not the center of attention anymore and it hurt his little old feelings he was lifted up in his own pride and offense became a partner no doubt about it and he began to pervert what God had given him twisting it and making it some performance something that it was never to be God wanted him to be who he created him to be but he didn't want him to become a distraction to others God's right-hand man he got puffed up in his heart isn't that the way people get today let God just bless a fellow listen carefully put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know--it all it's like some of these TSA agents some of them were Uber drivers last month and now they think they are FBI agents got a little badge in a name tag gone to their head always Cho a man when you're going through a line I do older the better look at him if he never Smiles get out of his line they get a little authority sometime and they really think that they are Secret Service agents protecting the life of the president party talk to people like they're just idiots huffed up that's how the enemy that they're just following along the line this is what happened to the enemy he wasn't always proud he was created to give praise to something else to someone else but but he got to thinking mama I wonder what it'd look like if I was sitting up there and because Angels had a choice too he began to persuade to dissuade and persuade let God just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him he gets to be Anno all he he he got he's got to start an organization he's got to start an organization or he's got to do something that's different why art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that my granny knew it she wasn't a Believer for too long but message believer for too long but she knew it she said some are called and some are sent and some just got up and went that's it stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that see a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a God as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person list what I do what me and me and mine and all that come on he said that's the wrong attitude God's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more he blessed the little the man would become he said you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself that doesn't mean be overly critical of yourself it means humble yourself God will bring a base he that will humble himself God will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big ain't that good and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as God will be big let's read that again you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as God will be big in you woo that's good see he said so Lucifer watch this so Lucifer is on Earth today trying to work is everybody looking at the screen Lucifer is on the Earth today trying to work in the church to do what to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world Lucifer was there's some around this truth that preach that he's not been kicked out yet they get that from from looking at at job and so there are people who believe that Lucifer can just you know uh strut in to the throne room anytime he so desires I want you to know that's not the truth if he ever is there it's because he was invited there or allowed there the Bible says there was a time that he was in the heavens only but now he is loosed on Earth he's no longer accusing you before the throne he once was there to accuse you before the throne to accuse job before the throne but the scripture said now he's loosed on Earth and what is he doing he's accusing brother to brother sister to sister church member to church member he doesn't have to do it from there anymore he does it from here offending and hurting feelings and making envy and jealousy destroy churches and marriages and relationships he's busy in the believer's business but I want to remind him you are kicked out your day is almost over it's up to you and I to make sure that we're not swallowing his lie we're not buying his swamp land it's up to you and I to make sure that we don't ever take on the characteristic of of Pride especially if it becomes a driving force in our life look nice and be clean and and do the best in life that you can but know this anything you have was a gift from the Father of Lights I worked hard for it you did because he gave you the strength to do it and the knowledge to be able to do it not because you just came here uh so amazing amen that's true for all of us if you are offended and you're nursing hurt and wounds that you've received in the household of your friends your brothers and sisters in Christ make sure that you immediately seek healing from the Lord he has a bomb of Gilead he has a healing portion and he wants to pour that don't don't let anger become a part of who you are uh there is a word pride in the Bible that we'll get to perhaps Tuesday night there's a word uh that's translated Pride that's just like a word that's translated anger it gives the sense of that bubbling up remember the foaming up there is a there is a pride that likes to foam Up Bubble Up in us and we have the responsibility to make sure that we keep pulling oursel back and uh I I don't I don't mean to be critical not at all but I don't perhaps like the language of of saying you need to belittle yourself I I I feel sure that he is telling us to Humble ourselves to make ourselves small I I think the word belittle in in in our society means demeaning to demean yourself if you do that brother sister if you keep disqualifying yourself and and and and taking yourself out of the promise you'll never get the victory over these things I I want you to know that he's already seen you in your worst before you showed up nothing you've done has surprised him he knew that I was rotten in my flesh before I ever was born in the earth and he saw me in my weakness in my rotness in my struggle with pride in my struggle with hurt in my struggle with anger and he loved me anyway and he has no intention of leaving me there he saw me in my fullness in my completion in my overcoming he saw that he saw that about you and he's determined he's committed stand would you stand with me he's committed he's committed to your success he's committed to you overcoming if you lean on him how many of you have served the Lord over over 30 years let me see your hand how many of you have served the Lord over 50 years let me see your hand hold it up high let me count them one two 3 this is my 50th year of ministry so I may be the youngest of those who have spent 5050 years serving him and yet I can still say and mean it I'm learning to lean can you imagine 50 years of serving the lord and you're still learning to lean because there's this human tendency to to lean on your own understanding I've learned something I hope I have I hope I have learned something in 50 years but what I've learned is not lean it's not stable enough it's not strong enough to lean on I've got to lean on him I want you to sing the old song before Ben comes I know he'll come with the worship I want you to sing that old song Learning to Lean give me a good key let's sing this together let it be real serious let it be real serious I'm learning to lean I'm learning to lean I'm learning to lean on Jesus oh I'm finding so much power than I ever dream oh I'm learning to lean on Jesus again I'm [Music] learning oh yes I'm learning Lord I want to lean on you more I'm learning to lean on Jesus oh I'm finding more power than i d ever [Music] dream I'm learning to Le on Jesus I was sad brokenhearted at an altar I knelt and I found a piece that was so [Music] Serene and all that he asks me is a child like trust and a heart that is Learning to Lean sing it to him I'm learning to lean on your Lord I'm learning oh I'm learning to lean to depend on you I'm learning to lean on Jesus oh I'm finding more power than i' ever dreamed I'm learning to Le on Jus oh there's glorious Victory each day now for me I found his Peace So serene in the midst of the storm he helps me with each T if only I'll ask every day now I'm learning I think we'll be Learning to Lean until it takes us out of here don't you oh I'm learning oh oh I'm learning to lean I'm learning learning to Le on Jesus oh I'm finding more power than I dream I'm learning to on Jesus Lord we are learning to lean I'd like to get it right I'd like to pass the test but sometimes in the split of a moment I try to figure it out myself or I try to do it on my own instead of waiting even though we know that you promis if we would wait on you our strength would be renewed like the eagles sometimes we just jump in it's some of our nature some of our personality to just jump in and get her done like the world says but it's always a painful reality when what we try to do just flops and fails would you remind us holy spirit of God would you remind us press Us in the moment to get out of your way Lord on occasion I have thought about what could have been if I would have been more yielded and would have waited more on you instead of trying to take the bull by the horns today Lord we stand in the house that we meet you in so often but we're so grateful that you live in us we don't have to leave you here when we go home would you come to us today Lord give us a peace that passes all understanding and would you let that buzzer go off when we start to do it we answer too quickly or we start to feel a little little proud of how we've handled it remind us to wait on you Lord oh I've seen what can happen when we yield when we lay down our lives we thank you for another opportunity to worship you now before we go and we ask that your peace would just surround us in this moment for the glory of God for the glory of your name name Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I don't know

on you till every drop is gone I pour my love on you how many of you would just say I have a need I have a need I see my need I have a need can we pray together over those needs father all of these needs are in your great big capable Supply doesn't matter what it is doesn't matter how big it is or how small it is it might seem so complicated that we could never sort it out but you got it you tell us in your word I've got it and so today we stand here without any doubt no doubt no doubt no reasoning we know you're able we know you are more than able yes because you conquered we are more than conquerors so we pull right now in in faith upon your inexhaustible we pull upon your inexhaustible Supply don't come to us Lord because we're good or because we've done anything come to us Lord because we recognize we're nothing and it's not us that pulls it's our faith and we recognize that even that we didn't do ourselves you you gave us that kind of Faith you gave us the kind of faith that pulls you in our Direction that's right like our Master said I must needs go through Samaria somebody needs me in Samaria Lord somebody needs you today in Smith Station instead of asking you to pass by we're thanking you right now that you've been with us thank you for being with us thank you for standing with us in this hour and we agree with the faith of every person who raised their hand a moment ago that whatever the need is physical emotional spiritual if it's Financial if it's for advice and wisdom and counil it's all in you Lord and right now we agree with their faith ah that something will awaken on the inside of the inside of the inside that would cause us to start possessing what we confess it's that easy it's that easy to take it to accept it to believe it Lord I believe right now there's so many good things happening among us some of which we can't even tell just yet but we praise you for them anyhow we praise you Lord even though they can't be testified about just yet we praise you for them we know you're a good God we know know Lord that you've got good intentions towards your little children and we want to thank you for it we want to thank you for it uh you don't have to unless you feel to but I'd like to invite somebody just to put your hand right right here on your own body because I had this sense that something needed to awaken and this is what the scripture said spring up o well therefore with joy shall you draw Waters out of the wells of Salvation and then Jesus came along and he said out of men's bellies he didn't mean your stomach he meant your spiritual belly your spiritual womb he said out of men's bellies shall flow what not not not little trickles rivers of Living Water sometimes it gets stagnant sometimes the water gets damned up if you feel like you need a uh something to wake up and be loosed in you just put your hand right there that's what I felt so I just let it come out Lord in the name of Jesus somebody there's some maybe somebody here wouldn't know what to do with it if it did but that don't matter what matters is that you are a god of Resurrection Life and and the reality is Elizabeth thought her little baby was dead she wasn't even sure he was still alive but when when when she came into the presence of the one who is carrying our Lord the Holy Ghost fell on her and Resurrection Life was in her womb and John the Baptist leapt something in her woke up and quickened and she received the Holy Ghost Lord right now whatever it is whatever promise whatever promise that has died in US somehow whatever flow has been damned up whatever River has been stopped up in US Lord we believe that we're coming into a season of movement into a season of of fluid that flows something flowing not something damned up so we speak life over our own inner being right now now that Rivers will come spring up spring up oh well with joy we're drawing water living water from the wells of Yeshua from the wells of Salvation we rebuke the Devourer I take authority over the enemy that wants you to give up somebody there's an enemy that wants you to give up on what you have carried in the past don't dare do it don't dare give up on that hold on right now may New Life new encouragement fresh Joy fresh hope let it rise up in you now in the name of Jesus healing your body comforting your heart speaking peace to the storm of your mind than you there are times that waiting means nothing doing nothing standing and doing nothing but there are times that waiting means serving in scripture when Peter's mother-in-law is that right am I right had a fever yes Peter's mother-in-law had a fever and the Lord came to capernium where she where she lived archaeologists have they believe they've discovered the house of of Peter's family in capernium we've been there many times when Jesus came to Capernaum and uh walked in and and prayed the prayer the Bible said she arose and she began to wait on them now if the only concept of waiting you have is doing nothing that's what she was doing when she was sick doing nothing she wasn't able but when strength came to her she got up and started serving her company see what I mean SO waiting can be just doing nothing just Standing on the Promises of God but sometimes waiting on the Lord the kind that renews your strength and gives you your wings back is when you just start doing little things that you know to do and that would be to read the word to pray to hear the tape to worship Worship in the shower Worship in the pantry Worship in the yard Worship in the car give him praise stay as connected to him as often and as tight as you possibly can those who abide in the vine those are the ones who are going to find strength to heal from their hurts and to overcome anger and pride I'm going to I have to it's life or death for me is it life or death for you it's life or death father one more time as we come to a a close the these needs they matter we carry them we're going to we're going to remember those brothers and sisters who raise their hand we're going to remember as we leave here today that you're on the case I want to tell you today in the name of the Lord he's on the case he knows he knows the he knows what you've never told a soul he knows what's troubling you right now that you've never told your own comp compion you've never told anybody he knows it yes he does and he has no stone to throw he simply knows it and he's ready and willing to help you overcome it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if it's appropriate just Reach Out And Touch someone near you we're nearly done just touch someone near you if it's appropriate to do so I believe in strength to strength I believe in glory to glory faith to Faith and I believe in spirit top Fellowship I believe there's a life on the inside of me and a life on the inside of you that's the same and when we join together as two agree as touching any one thing in my name there's something there's a uh there is a a Synergy that takes place so right now I put my faith with yours do it I put my faith with yours right now don't know the need don't have to know the need but I put my faith with yours right now let there be an anointing quickening anointing over every promise that you've been contending for Jesus let there be a waking up oh yes oh yes oh yes let the confidence of the Lord be upon you it's not self-confidence you need you need the confidence of the Lord to be upon you right now you're going to move not in your own but in his not in your own but in his the confidence of the Lord hallelujah you woke me up this morning in my right mind and that alone is enough to praise you for and I've tried to move in your confidence Lord let your confidence be with your children let them move in that place this week for the glory of God no matter matter what they face Lord let us see how low we can go let us see how low we can go so you
