[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:51] cry I want to welcome you to the
[0:53] broadcast today and tell you what a
[0:56] wonderful privilege it is to be able to
[0:58] come into your home or wherever you're
[1:00] viewing this broadcast and announce to
[1:03] you the good news
[1:04] of Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 the
[1:07] Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:10] and today and forever he changes not two
[1:14] thousand years ago the son of God God in
[1:18] human flesh walked the earth our Messiah
[1:21] our Savior our deliverer and we
[1:25] understand the Gospel story he was
[1:27] crucified he died he went into the grave
[1:30] but that was not the end of the story
[1:32] Satan was hoping that it was but on the
[1:35] third day he was victorious over death
[1:38] hell and the grave and he raised from
[1:42] the dead he is the resurrection he told
[1:46] Martha and Mary concerning the death and
[1:49] resurrection of their brother Lazarus
[1:51] before he raised him from the dead he
[1:53] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:56] they said well we know our brother will
[1:58] live again in the resurrection in Jesus
[2:01] Yeshua he just said I am you're looking
[2:04] at the resurrection he is resurrection
[2:08] life and so we just speak to the dead to
[2:11] those who are spiritually dead to those
[2:14] who are spiritually numb to those who
[2:16] have not yet come to the saving
[2:18] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:20] just declared to you I prophesied to you
[2:22] today he is the resurrection and the
[2:25] life if you trust him you can have
[2:29] eternal life
[2:31] this body of flesh that we live in will
[2:33] one day die and it will go into the
[2:35] grave but there is a resurrection there
[2:38] is hope and one day we know that we're
[2:40] going to live forever and ever in the
[2:43] kingdom of God and so we just feel so
[2:46] blessed to be able to share even that if
[2:49] that was all that I could share with you
[2:51] two
[2:51] day I would feel extremely blessed to be
[2:54] able to announce that good news some of
[2:58] you have heard it for 30 years 40 years
[3:00] 70 years your whole life others of you
[3:04] perhaps changing channel surfing across
[3:07] this network found this program and you
[3:11] may have never heard that Jesus Christ
[3:14] Yeshua the Messiah is alive and well and
[3:18] doing might I add great things among his
[3:23] people all over the world I know you've
[3:27] heard about the outpouring of God's Holy
[3:30] Spirit it sounds like another day of
[3:32] Pentecost people are being overcome by
[3:35] the power of God somebody said oh I'm
[3:39] not interested in that well we need to
[3:41] be we need to be interested in the
[3:43] fullness of God's Spirit operating in
[3:46] our lives because death is at work in
[3:49] our members death is at work in this
[3:52] physical body and if in this life the
[3:56] Bible tells us in the New Testament if
[3:58] in this life only we have hope then we
[4:02] are of all men most miserable but I'm
[4:07] thankful that my hope is not only in
[4:11] this life but in the life Hereafter and
[4:14] so I want to share with you some insight

[5:40] for you it'll be on the screen as well
[5:41] let's get into the Word of God today and
[5:44] again thank you for tuning in we're
[5:46] going to begin a series where we're
[5:48] going to be speaking to you about
[5:51] exercising the spirit of man we are try
[5:56] and being we are body soul and spirit
[6:01] and we want to talk about that but we're
[6:04] gonna do it slowly we're going to teach
[6:06] from the scripture and I believe you'll
[6:09] be blessed by our time together today
[6:11] amen so let's get started in John
[6:14] chapter 3 we read a very familiar
[6:18] portion of Scripture Jesus is speaking
[6:21] to Nicodemus this ruler among the Jews
[6:26] who came to Jesus by night he didn't
[6:30] come in the daytime he came under the
[6:32] shadow of darkness in secret his heart
[6:36] was a heart of inquiry he was interested
[6:41] and he came to Jesus to find out just
[6:45] what was going on you see being a Jew he
[6:48] was very religious very knowledgeable of
[6:50] the law he knew the prophecies
[6:53] concerning the coming of the Messiah and
[6:55] he was just fascinated but because he
[6:59] was a ruler among the Jews he didn't
[7:02] want to be identified he didn't want
[7:04] people to know that he had come so he
[7:07] came by night and he asked Jesus in John
[7:10] chapter 3 rabbi we know that thou art a
[7:14] teacher come from God this is verse 2
[7:17] for no man can
[7:19] these things that thou doest except God
[7:21] be with him now I want to skip down for
[7:26] the purpose of this study to verse 6 and
[7:29] well I guess we better get verse 5 in
[7:32] here because it's the most powerful and
[7:34] important verse probably in this chapter
[7:37] jesus answered verily verily surely
[7:40] surely I say unto you except a man be
[7:44] born of water and of the spirit he
[7:47] cannot enter into the kingdom of God how
[7:51] important is being born of the Spirit
[7:56] well without it you cannot enter into
[7:58] the kingdom of God now of course you
[8:02] know Nicodemus he didn't understand this
[8:04] and he said how can I enter a second
[8:07] time into my mother's womb and be born
[8:09] all over again now I'm a grown man of
[8:12] full stature and Jesus is giving him the
[8:15] revelation of how a new birth in the
[8:18] spirit is possible but I want to read
[8:21] verse 6 7 and 8 that which is born of
[8:25] the flesh is flesh understand that which
[8:31] originates in ish is initiated in the
[8:35] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[8:38] the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I
[8:43] say unto thee you must be born again and
[8:45] then verse 8 the wind bloweth where it
[8:48] listeth and thou hearest the sound
[8:50] thereof but canst not tell whence it
[8:53] cometh and whither it goeth so is every
[8:56] one that is born of the Spirit now just
[9:02] for those of you who may have never
[9:04] heard that simple plan of the gospel
[9:07] that we were talking about a moment ago
[9:08] how is one born of the Spirit well we
[9:11] must repent of our sins we must
[9:14] acknowledge before God that we have
[9:16] sinned and we have the Bible tells us in
[9:20] Romans 4 all have sinned and come short
[9:22] of the glory of God but John 3:16 tells
[9:27] us for God so loved the world that He
[9:30] gave His only be
[9:31] gotten Sun now another scripture tells
[9:33] us greater love have have any man than
[9:37] this there's there's no greater love
[9:40] possible than a man would lay down his
[9:43] life for his friends
[9:44] this tells us of the great love of God
[9:48] that he was willing to condescend he
[9:53] came down into a body made of flesh and
[9:55] that flesh was crucified the life that
[9:59] was in him the eternal spirit of the
[10:01] Father did not die did you notice I said
[10:05] the eternal spirit of the father did not
[10:09] die but the fleshly body of the Lord
[10:12] Jesus Christ did die paying the price
[10:15] the Bible tells us without the shedding
[10:18] of blood there is no remission of sin
[10:20] and so we see from the book of Genesis
[10:23] the Garden of Eden all the way through
[10:26] to the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus
[10:28] Christ that blood was necessary the
[10:31] shedding of blood interestingly enough
[10:33] the blood of Jesus was not just the
[10:36] ordinary blood it didn't just have the
[10:38] DNA of man but it had the DNA of God it
[10:42] was blood that was specifically designed
[10:46] for man's Redemption hallelujah and it
[10:49] doesn't just remit our sin it doesn't
[10:52] just cover I should say it doesn't just
[10:54] cover our sin but it remits our sin in
[10:58] other words it takes it away through
[11:01] justification just if I'd justified just
[11:06] if I'd never sinned oh my this is a
[11:10] wonderful thing that our loving father
[11:13] has done for us so we need to repent of
[11:16] our sin acknowledge that we're a sinner
[11:18] and invite the Lord Jesus Christ into
[11:21] our life and we can be born again we can
[11:24] be and then the Spirit of God comes in
[11:27] and washes us and sanctifies us cleanses
[11:31] us sets us apart and then we can be
[11:33] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[11:35] Ghost and fire and if you've never heard
[11:38] of that if you can get a hold of a New
[11:40] Testament read in Acts chapter 2
[11:44] the Bible a call said if you're if
[11:47] you're not familiar you see there are
[11:48] people listening to me that are not
[11:50] familiar with the layout of the Bible so
[11:53] I want to encourage you to look into it
[11:57] in a New Testament you're gonna have the
[11:59] four Gospels first Matthew Mark Luke and
[12:02] John these are the four Gospels the good
[12:04] news of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[12:06] Christ for individual men who were
[12:09] eyewitnesses to the miraculous ministry
[12:13] of Jesus Christ in the earth and then
[12:16] the next book in the Bible the fifth
[12:18] book of the Bible is called in most
[12:20] bibles the Acts of the Apostles
[12:24] that's where we're talking about the
[12:26] book of Acts chapter 2 read it and
[12:30] you'll read about how the power of the
[12:33] Holy Spirit was poured out during the
[12:35] Jewish feast of Shavuot one of the three
[12:39] major feast in the Hebrew calendar where
[12:43] God commanded that every male Hebrew
[12:46] would come to Jerusalem to the temple
[12:49] and worship God and they were doing that
[12:51] for Shavuot when the heavens opened up
[12:54] the fire of God came down hallelujah and
[12:58] a mighty rushing wind and they were all
[13:01] baptized with the spirit that completes
[13:04] the new birth when a baby is born first
[13:08] there is an issue of of water and then
[13:13] an issue of blood and then an issue of
[13:15] life so the the natural birth the
[13:18] breaking of the water the issuing of
[13:21] fourth of the blood is the babies coming
[13:23] forth and then life in three steps so is
[13:27] the spiritual birth the natural birth
[13:29] three steps the spiritual birth also
[13:31] three phases repentance we repent we
[13:36] become justified we allow the Word of
[13:38] God to penetrate our lives and instruct
[13:41] us and wash us the scripture said we are
[13:43] wha
[13:44] we are washed or cleansed or sanctified
[13:47] by the washing of the water of God's
[13:50] Word
[13:51] that speaks of a great power of God's
[13:53] Word then we are filled with the
[13:56] precious wonderful gift
[13:58] of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost and
[14:00] fire now I'm telling you it's a
[14:02] wonderful wonderful experience acts 2:38
[14:06] says repent and be baptized every one of
[14:08] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[14:10] remission of your sins and ye shall
[14:13] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[14:16] it's a promise and it is a gift this is
[14:20] how we come now we want to talk about
[14:23] something that is I think vitally
[14:28] important to understand as spirit filled
[14:31] believers so now we've spent this time
[14:32] just introducing whoever might be
[14:35] watching who needed to have your memory
[14:39] refreshed on the plan of salvation or
[14:42] perhaps you've never really heard it
[14:43] before you've heard about Christians
[14:45] you've heard about those who follow
[14:47] Jesus and what you've heard may or may
[14:49] not be true may not be the truth because
[14:52] and as we should say I think that
[14:56] everyone who names the name of Christ is
[14:59] not following the Word of God and so
[15:02] they're going to be people who say well
[15:03] I was born a Christian I was born a
[15:06] Christian my mother was a Christian well
[15:07] I want to tell you something friend God
[15:09] doesn't have any grandchildren and so
[15:12] you're not just a Christian because your
[15:15] mother was a Christian or your father
[15:16] was a Christian because that may be your
[15:19] religion but we're not talking about
[15:22] religion we're talking about
[15:23] relationship oh and every man woman boy
[15:27] or girl is invited to have for
[15:31] themselves a personal encounter with the
[15:34] Living God a true-blue real genuine
[15:38] relationship with Jesus you say well
[15:41] that's impossible because Jesus left the
[15:43] earth he died raised from the dead and
[15:45] some 30 40 days later ascended into
[15:48] heaven we're told and so where is he now
[15:51] well that's where you need to read Acts
[15:53] chapter 2 I'll tell you where Jesus is
[15:55] he's right here living inside of me
[15:58] uh-oh somebody said I'm turning that
[16:00] preacher off he said he was Jesus well
[16:02] every spirit-filled believer is carrying
[16:06] in them a deposit of the Zoey that's a
[16:10] Greek word
[16:11] for the life of God it's inside of us so
[16:15] where is Jesus in the earth he is not in
[16:18] one physical corporate body he is now in
[16:22] a multitude of many membered body where
[16:26] we are walking out by the Spirit of the
[16:29] Lord
[16:30] introducing the life of God to the earth
[16:33] for more information if you need to
[16:35] understand some of these things we don't
[16:37] have time to go into the complete depth
[16:39] of it today contact us the address is
[16:43] given the email address is given and
[16:45] we'll be glad to help you get some
[16:47] resources or something information a CD
[16:51] or a printed article or something that
[16:54] would help you or lists of the
[16:55] Scriptures that would help you to engage
[16:58] to embark on a wonderful journey through
[17:01] the scripture now I want us to talk
[17:04] about this triune being that we are you
[17:09] see God is triune now when I'm teaching
[17:13] I don't use the word Trinity not that I
[17:17] don't believe that there is a Trinity of
[17:21] attributes in God a Trinity of because
[17:25] you know the tricycle has three wheels
[17:28] so I'm not opposed to that except for
[17:32] the fact that sometimes when people
[17:34] explain the Trinity they are really
[17:38] using hyper trinitarianism extreme
[17:43] trinitarianism where they get God so
[17:46] divided into three separate people that
[17:49] they lose all reality or concept of the
[17:53] oneness of God and because my heritage
[17:57] my great-grandparents were Jewish and
[17:59] they were from Lithuania I see very
[18:03] clearly in the Torah in the in the Bible
[18:06] that God is one here ye o Israel the
[18:10] Lord thy God is one but he has decided
[18:15] it was God's decision to reveal himself
[18:18] in a tri-unity in a great oneness in a
[18:24] great
[18:24] unity of spirit same spirit God is a
[18:29] spirit and they that worship Him must
[18:31] worship Him how in spirit and in truth
[18:34] but he took his spirit and he has
[18:37] manifested himself in three distinct I
[18:41] think we can say distinct manifestations
[18:45] personalities administration's and what
[18:48] are they
[18:49] Father Son and Holy Spirit so I don't
[18:54] want you to leave this broadcast
[18:56] thinking that I do not teach the the
[19:00] tri-unity of God I do I see it very
[19:03] clearly
[19:04] I could never deny it because you're
[19:07] made similar you and I are also some
[19:13] sort of try unity a triune being we are
[19:18] made up of body that's this flesh that's
[19:21] what you see on the outside and then
[19:25] inside of this physical body there's two
[19:29] parts of me that you can't see one is my
[19:32] soul and the soul is often referred to
[19:37] as the seat of the emotions and inside
[19:41] of the souls so to speak if you were
[19:43] drawing circles three circles inside of
[19:45] each other is the human spirit now the
[19:49] interesting thing about the human spirit
[19:51] is in the Garden of Eden Adam was given
[19:56] the Spirit of God
[19:57] it was breathed into him and it created
[20:02] for Adam a human spirit so what was
[20:06] living inside of Adam his spirit was
[20:09] actually the spirit his spirit Adam's
[20:13] spirit was actually the spirit it was
[20:17] the essence of the eternal God we live
[20:21] in a to make it a little bit simpler we
[20:23] live in a three compartment home a three
[20:27] room home you could put it on three
[20:30] levels or you could put it as three
[20:34] separate rooms I've heard people say
[20:36] it's like a kitchen
[20:38] parlour or a living room and a bedroom
[20:40] and then I've heard people say it's
[20:42] three levels of floors if you wanted to
[20:45] do that then we could say that we live
[20:47] on the middle floor and we can choose to
[20:51] sort of reside there forever or we can
[20:54] also move up into another realm or
[20:58] another floor the spirit realm or move
[21:01] down into the realm of the soul and I
[21:04] know that's sounding a little bit
[21:05] complicated and that's why one just
[21:08] really teach very slow we're just laying
[21:11] sort of a foundation here today so you
[21:13] really need to tune in again next week
[21:15] and the next and the next because we're
[21:17] going to go through some scriptures here
[21:19] that I think are very important but let
[21:20] me just just give you a few notes here
[21:22] one each of us has the capacity and the
[21:27] ability to find expression and
[21:30] fulfillment in either the upper floor or
[21:33] in the lower floor or we could say if
[21:36] we're living in the living room of our
[21:39] home we can be happy in the kitchen we
[21:42] can have peace there we can have peace
[21:44] in the bedroom we can move back and
[21:45] forth and enjoy our life I know that is
[21:48] sounding a little bit odd but you'll get
[21:51] it I know you will because we're gonna
[21:52] go through it so plain and so many times
[21:55] and restate it and give so many examples
[21:57] that you're gonna catch it I know and
[21:59] it's for you it's for you to understand
[22:02] because I believe that we're about to
[22:05] come into a place in the kingdom of God
[22:07] where there is coming forth a company of
[22:10] people all over the world in every
[22:13] nation of the world in the islands of
[22:15] the sea who will be granted the spirit
[22:18] of the overcomer or the anointing of the
[22:21] overcomer we're not just going to
[22:24] survive in these terrible times that the
[22:29] world is facing right now there's going
[22:31] to be a Bride of Christ there's going to
[22:33] be an overcoming company of people that
[22:36] no matter what's going on around them in
[22:37] the natural they're going to move in the
[22:40] realm of the supernatural we're going to
[22:44] have supernatural protection we're going
[22:46] to have supernatural healing and health
[22:48] we're going to have supernatural
[22:49] leadership
[22:51] I believe that God's going to have a
[22:52] people who are so connected their spirit
[22:57] man is so connected now I guess I should
[23:00] say that we connect with the world
[23:03] around us with the atmosphere with the
[23:05] earth around us through the realm of the
[23:08] soul but we connect with God with the
[23:11] heavenly dimension with the third heaven
[23:13] we connect through our spirit man and so
[23:18] the inside of the inside is the spirit
[23:22] man the five senses that we know of the
[23:27] the smelling and the seeing the hearing
[23:29] the tasting the feeling so forth these
[23:31] five senses are ways that we contact
[23:36] that we have communication with the
[23:38] earth with the world around us with what
[23:41] we can see with what we can hear with
[23:43] what we can smell what we can taste what
[23:44] we can feel these are ways that our
[23:48] flesh is able to connect to the world
[23:51] around us and what we gather through
[23:54] these five senses is filtered in to the
[23:57] soul of man now our spirit man is on the
[24:02] inside of that and that's what we want
[24:04] to see exercised in this hour through
[24:08] the transgression through the fall in
[24:10] the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve lost the
[24:13] ability to move into that spirit realm
[24:17] they only had connection with the
[24:21] earthly realm through the five senses of
[24:24] the flesh that information filtered into
[24:26] the soul so any kind of communication
[24:29] that they had was very low level
[24:33] communication low level understanding
[24:36] but there was a time that Adam was able
[24:40] to access God through his spirit because
[24:43] he was made in the very image and in the
[24:46] very likeness of God because of the fall
[24:50] he lost that ability to function both in
[24:54] the natural realm and in the spirit
[24:56] realm and he only functioned in the
[24:58] natural realm and I don't know about you
[25:00] but the natural realm is pretty limited
[25:03] somebody said what in the
[25:05] old are you talking about well it's in
[25:07] the realm of the natural realm this
[25:09] earthly realm that we find sickness that
[25:12] we find troubles that we get into bad
[25:15] situations that we deal with a lot of
[25:17] ugly stuff with addiction with
[25:20] generational curses with so many things
[25:23] that the enemy uses to hold us back we
[25:25] want to break out of this realm of the
[25:28] soulless realm the emotions and the mind
[25:31] and the and the affections and the
[25:33] imaginations and the conscious realm all
[25:36] this stuff that pollutes us that weighs
[25:39] us down and we want to be able to move
[25:41] into the realm of the Spirit I believe
[25:43] God gave us the Holy Spirit because he
[25:45] wanted us to be able to function whole
[25:49] we're to be whole we are we receive a
[25:54] lot of woundedness in this life don't we
[25:57] we lose a lot of our spiritual ground we
[26:02] lose a lot of that sometime when we get
[26:04] slapped upside the head with
[26:06] circumstances when we get sick when when
[26:09] our loved ones we see our loved ones
[26:12] suffering there's so many things that
[26:13] happen to us to distract us that's
[26:16] really what I want to say there's so
[26:19] much going on that we get it through our
[26:21] five senses we hear bad news we see mad
[26:24] news we can almost smell bad news
[26:27] there's so much of that that distracts
[26:30] us from developing a relationship of
[26:33] intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ so
[26:36] we want to see the the Spirit of God
[26:37] give us some strength to place some
[26:40] boundaries in our life to shut out some
[26:44] of the influences that the enemy wants
[26:46] to use to distract us I mean we've got
[26:48] to live and we've got a function in the
[26:50] earthly realm but and and we have access
[26:53] to that earthly realm but we want to be
[26:55] able to control that we want to be able
[26:58] to determine by the Spirit of God how we
[27:01] let our circumstances affect us in other
[27:04] words the enemy doesn't want you to have
[27:06] joy he wants to steal your joy he's a
[27:10] joy thief but things are going to come
[27:14] circumstances are going to come that
[27:16] sort of tried to affect our peace
[27:18] affect our joy but the test is how
[27:21] quickly how quickly do you come back to
[27:24] joy if you get sidetracked you start
[27:28] losing some of your peace and joy how
[27:30] quick do you come back to that do you
[27:32] just kind of wallow around in self-pity
[27:35] do you kind of wallow around in
[27:37] oppression and depression or do you
[27:40] quickly just start standing on the
[27:42] promises of God and rebuking the enemy
[27:44] and saying I'm gonna focus my attention
[27:47] on the Lord Jesus Christ and brother
[27:50] sister if you start doing that I don't
[27:52] care how adverse the circumstances are I
[27:55] don't care how bloody the wounds are if
[27:58] you start focusing on the Lord Jesus
[28:00] Christ you're gonna come back to joy
[28:01] you're gonna come back to peace every
[28:04] time and I'm feeling some of that joy
[28:07] I'm feeling some of that peace right now
[28:09] as I speak to you about how available it
[28:12] is in the body of Christ but we need to
[28:14] pray and go off the air and I hope
[28:16] you'll tune in again to the program the
[28:18] Eagles cry next week but let's pray
[28:20] father I'm excited it took me a whole
[28:24] program to get excited to start moving
[28:26] into what I wanted to speak about and
[28:28] lord I just pray I know I've kind of
[28:30] moved quickly and I don't want to
[28:32] confuse anybody I want to bless people
[28:34] and I just pray Lord that you will by
[28:37] the Holy Spirit you will let us digest
[28:40] your word let us get understanding let
[28:43] us get supernatural knowledge and then
[28:46] father above all things let us begin to
[28:48] live this out so we just come against
[28:50] the works of the enemy that try to
[28:51] distract and hinder God's people in this
[28:54] last day and I just released deliverance
[28:57] right now let's just get right to it
[28:59] I release deliverance from distraction
[29:02] from bondages from addictions Lord let's
[29:05] somebody just reach up to you and send
[29:08] mercy and grace into their home into
[29:11] their place of business wherever they
[29:14] are and let your peace fill that home I
[29:16] release your peace right now into that
[29:18] home into that place of gathering let
[29:22] your peace and your joy and your comfort
[29:25] come in the wonderful name of the Lord
[29:27] Jesus Christ we pray amen any man I want
[29:30] to thank you for
[29:31] watching the Eagles cry tune in again
[29:33] next time god bless you I love you I
[29:36] want to be a blessing to you bye-bye for
[29:38] today
