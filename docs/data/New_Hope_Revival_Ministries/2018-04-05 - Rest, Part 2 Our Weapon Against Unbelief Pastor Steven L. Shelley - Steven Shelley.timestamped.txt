[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit

[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[0:58] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New
[1:02] Hope revival ministries and we're coming
[1:05] to you today in partnership with our
[1:08] wonderful friends at the gospel channel
[1:10] we pray that this program will be a
[1:14] blessing to you in some way my desire is
[1:17] that it would inspire you to look at
[1:20] God's Word maybe in a different way than
[1:23] you've ever looked at it before it's
[1:26] more than just a book of instructions or
[1:28] a book of Commandments thank God for His
[1:31] instructions thank God for His
[1:34] commandments we love them the Bible
[1:37] tells us that we should love the laws of
[1:40] the Lord and love His commandments but
[1:42] it's also a love story and it's also a
[1:45] word that reveals to us a relationship
[1:50] that's available in this end time that
[1:53] we're living in one by which we can draw
[1:56] close to the Lord and know him in a
[2:00] personal way I'm thankful for the gospel
[2:04] Channel I'm thankful for the programming
[2:06] I believe that God is using the network
[2:09] to win the lost
[2:12] I believe the discouraged are being
[2:14] discouraged I believe that the prayer of
[2:19] faith is bringing healing to those who
[2:21] are sick and by the way it would be a
[2:25] great great blessing to us to be able to
[2:28] stand with you in prayer for your prayer
[2:31] requests if you will send them in you
[2:34] can email them there is a phone number
[2:36] that you can call and leave your prayer
[2:39] requests or you can send by
[2:42] old-fashioned snail mail a request and
[2:46] we will be more than happy to stand with
[2:48] you in prayer we have a wonderful group
[2:50] of prayer warriors here at our church
[2:52] who would just love to believe God with
[2:55] you for your need and we also like to
[2:58] hear when God is moving and answering
[3:01] prayer and testimonies of the goodness
[3:04] of God in your life we desire to be
[3:06] connected with you we appreciate hearing
[3:09] from
[3:10] where you're watching this program we've
[3:13] been studying now for some time the Word
[3:16] of God we've been looking at different
[3:18] aspects of the Word of God and recently
[3:22] when we were together we began to talk
[3:25] about entering into a place of rest we
[3:30] were reading in Hebrews chapter 3 and
[3:34] chapter 4 where the Apostle was
[3:37] comparing the journeyings of the
[3:41] children of Israel our forefathers as
[3:44] they're called in Hebrews those who went
[3:47] before us and how their struggle with
[3:51] unbelief is what kept them basically
[3:55] from inheriting the promised land as a
[3:58] generation we know that many of those
[4:01] older ones died in the wilderness and
[4:04] God raised up another generation that
[4:08] was actually strong enough and able and
[4:11] ready to go in and deal with the
[4:14] inhabitants of the land so that indeed
[4:17] the children of God could possess their
[4:20] inheritance and this is a New Testament
[4:23] scripture Hebrews three and four and
[4:26] these chapters I believe say a lot to us
[4:31] about what our approach toward the Word
[4:34] of God should be in this hour and I just
[4:39] like to review just a moment because I
[4:42] want to go a little further in the time
[4:44] that we have together today we were
[4:46] reading initially Hebrews chapter 4
[4:49] verse 11 and 12 and I'm just going to
[4:52] read verse 11 right now let us labor
[4:54] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[4:59] any man fall after the same example of
[5:04] unbelief and then of course the next
[5:06] verse is verse 12 that very powerful
[5:10] verse that describes the Word of God as
[5:13] a weapon as a tool it talks about the
[5:17] ability of the Word of God to discern
[5:20] even the secret thought and the
[5:23] tenth of the heart you know one of the
[5:26] things that we are warned against in New
[5:29] Testament scripture is judging someone's
[5:32] motives trying to read their heart and
[5:36] maybe perceive why they do what they do
[5:41] and then passing judgment on their
[5:43] motive the Bible tells us clearly that
[5:46] this is not our place we may think we
[5:50] know why someone does what they do we
[5:53] may think that we have some special
[5:55] insight about what's going on in someone
[5:58] else's heart but the reality is only the
[6:02] Word of God possesses that ability--
[6:05] both I believe the written word of God
[6:08] can do it because when we read it and we
[6:11] begin to digest it I was going to say
[6:15] discern it but absolutely when we begin
[6:19] to allow the Spirit of God to break it
[6:22] down for us in our life then I think we
[6:26] can sometimes see our motive but it's
[6:29] only by the Word of God that the motive
[6:32] of the heart is revealed and that's on
[6:34] an individual basis so we really need to
[6:38] leave the work of the word to the word
[6:41] and we need to pray for one another and
[6:44] love one another and serve one another
[6:47] you know there are many people on the
[6:50] same journey that you and I our own and
[6:52] that is to press in to Christ in this
[6:56] day and in this hour and it's not an
[6:59] easy thing because there are many
[7:01] distractions and I tell you the enemy
[7:04] gets wild when he sees the children of
[7:07] God really pursuing a close walk with
[7:11] the Lord when when the enemy sees you
[7:14] and I pressing past our circumstances
[7:17] and into Christ with a real relationship
[7:21] an unshakable relationship with him well
[7:26] the enemy he just starts pulling out his
[7:29] bag of tricks and distractions and
[7:32] attacks and lies and
[7:34] he uses anything and everything that he
[7:38] can to discourage you to dissuade you
[7:40] from your relationship with the Lord but
[7:44] I tell you it's worth pressing into and
[7:47] we have authority over the enemy when we
[7:50] begin to discern and recognize that the
[7:52] enemy is lying to us
[7:55] that he's trying to move us off the
[7:58] truth of God's Word then we have we have
[8:01] some ammunition to use against him we
[8:04] think about the temptation of our Lord
[8:07] who was moved by the spirit after a long
[8:11] fast into the wilderness and there Satan
[8:14] appeared to tempt him and what was the
[8:17] answer that Jesus gave consistently to
[8:20] the temptations of the enemy it is
[8:24] written so we know that if our Lord used
[8:29] the word of god even quoting the written
[8:32] word of god has a weapon against the
[8:35] enemy then you and I can follow his
[8:38] example and I've actually used the word
[8:41] of God in my own life at times to put
[8:44] the devil on the run it's not just
[8:46] afraid of words but when he realizes
[8:49] that you believe what you say when he
[8:52] realizes that your faith is attached to
[8:56] the Word of God that you're quoting that
[8:59] scatters the enemy so we we talked about
[9:04] how we're being warned by the Apostle
[9:07] here to make sure that we don't allow
[9:12] unbelief to bring about the same kind of
[9:16] fall or failure in our lives that we
[9:20] observed in the lives of the children of
[9:23] Israel and then as we were winding up
[9:27] our time together we moved a one chapter
[9:31] back to Hebrews chapter three and we
[9:35] read verses 8 through 14 let me do that
[9:37] I believe I can do it real quick here
[9:40] because I want to make sure that we know
[9:43] where we've been so we can get an idea
[9:45] of where we're going
[9:47] it says in verse eight harden not your
[9:49] heart your hearts
[9:52] I believe that's good advice we need to
[9:55] keep our spiritual man soft our hearts
[10:00] need to be soft before the Lord trials
[10:04] and heartache grief and losses can
[10:07] certainly cause emotionally our hearts
[10:11] to be hard but God is looking for hearts
[10:15] that are moldable and pliable that he
[10:19] can speak truth in truth that will not
[10:23] just comfort us but truth that will
[10:27] transform us into the image of Jesus
[10:30] Christ he goes on to talk about the
[10:33] provocation in the day of temptation in
[10:36] the wilderness and we mentioned that the
[10:39] complete Jewish Bible refers to that as
[10:41] the bitter quarrel when your father's
[10:45] tempted me proved me and saw my works 40
[10:49] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[10:52] generation and said they do always err
[10:56] in their heart and they have not known
[11:00] my ways so I swear in my wrath they
[11:04] shall not enter into my rest
[11:08] verse 12 take heed brethren and I
[11:12] encourage you to do this exactly what's
[11:17] being asked of us I'm going to do it
[11:20] take heed brethren lest there be any of
[11:24] you or in any of you an evil heart of
[11:28] unbelief in departing from the Living
[11:30] God but exhort one another daily while
[11:34] it is called today lest any of you be
[11:38] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[11:41] sin which is unbelief for we are made
[11:45] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[11:49] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[11:52] unto the end there is something to be
[11:55] said about being consistent about being
[12:00] stedfast when we come to know the Lord
[12:03] that is our testimony our profession of
[12:06] faith but sometimes along the way our
[12:09] testimony gets weaker and weaker and
[12:12] compromise seems to take ahold of our
[12:16] lives let me just encourage you Body of
[12:18] Christ
[12:19] this is no time to slack up this is no
[12:23] time to compromise in fact this is time
[12:27] to dig deeper into God and into the
[12:30] things of God this is the hour to open
[12:34] up more of your life to the leadership
[12:38] and to the authority of the Holy Spirit
[12:41] so that God by the Spirit can place his
[12:45] finger on things in our lives that need
[12:49] to be extracted so when we keep maybe
[12:53] sealing off certain areas of our life
[12:55] not allowing the Spirit of God to have
[12:59] open and free access to those areas of
[13:02] our life then we we can only grow so
[13:04] much we can only experience a certain
[13:07] measure of change and transformation but
[13:11] I believe that because of the new birth
[13:14] we have the potential of being changed
[13:17] from glory to glory even as we have
[13:21] talked about it levels of glory
[13:24] dimensions of glory we have talked about
[13:27] that more than one time when we have met
[13:30] together in this same way so it's not a
[13:33] time to get slack it's not a time to
[13:36] compromise we are actually receiving an
[13:39] invitation to be strengthened by the
[13:43] Word of God in this our fortified what
[13:47] we can do is get behind that word we
[13:50] have a hiding place in the truth of
[13:53] God's Word it becomes our fortress
[13:56] it becomes our strong tower and it
[14:00] certainly becomes a place of refuge when
[14:04] the enemy is howling I like this verse
[14:08] and I put it in my notes to share with
[14:11] you also 1st corinthians chapter
[14:14] 15 and verse 58 says therefore my
[14:17] beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable
[14:23] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[14:27] for as much as you know that your labor
[14:30] is not in vain in the Lord you and I can
[14:36] be rock steady in an hour where
[14:41] everything around us is shifting and
[14:44] sinking like like the sinking sand in
[14:48] the amplified it says therefore my
[14:50] beloved brethren be firm be steadfast
[14:53] immovable always abounding in the work
[14:56] of the Lord always being superior
[15:00] excelling doing more than enough in the
[15:03] service of the Lord knowing and being
[15:06] continually aware that your labor in the
[15:10] Lord is not futile it is not it is never
[15:14] wasted or to no purpose
[15:16] there's always reward and there's always
[15:20] purpose for what we do in the kingdom of
[15:23] God even if in our own eyes it seems so
[15:27] miniscule so small and insignificant if
[15:32] you are hearing the voice of the Lord
[15:35] and you're being obedient to it in any
[15:38] way I'm telling you your labor for the
[15:42] Lord is not in vain even if it's just a
[15:46] prompting of the Spirit pray for new
[15:49] hope revival ministries pray for the
[15:52] gospel channel pray for mrs. Smith who
[15:55] lives on the corner of your street and
[15:58] you think well I don't even really know
[16:00] mrs. Smith but when we get those
[16:02] leadings of the Spirit of the Lord we
[16:06] must be obedient we must move
[16:08] immediately into prayer because if God
[16:12] puts it on your heart it's because there
[16:14] is a need we may not know the full
[16:17] impact of our obedience especially some
[16:21] of those small obediences until we stand
[16:24] in the presence of God but I believe
[16:26] there's
[16:27] in a day when we will know every
[16:29] everything that we need to know all
[16:33] those things that we didn't understand
[16:35] you know I've had the Spirit of the Lord
[16:37] give me
[16:38] well let me say respectfully strange
[16:41] instructions sometimes instructions that
[16:45] could have been embarrassing even but if
[16:48] we can learn to be obedient in those
[16:51] things I do believe the scripture is
[16:53] clear there is a great reward coming I
[16:57] believe it is critical that we are rock
[17:01] solid right now I believe that it is
[17:04] very important that we walk before God
[17:07] in balance what we have sometimes
[17:11] referred to as the middle of the road
[17:14] did you know that you can take even
[17:17] truth something as precious as truth and
[17:20] you can take it so far out past its
[17:24] biblical parameter until you make a
[17:27] religion out of it and when you make a
[17:30] religion out of something that is truth
[17:32] you kill it you take its life from it
[17:35] the Bible said the letter killeth but
[17:38] the spirit make it alive when when we
[17:41] try to impose the Word of God on someone
[17:45] without offering them the life and the
[17:48] grace of God to be able to live that
[17:51] then we're actually introducing religion
[17:55] to them instead of imparting life to
[17:58] them and that is not ministry ministry
[18:01] is to reach out with the life of Jesus
[18:05] Christ not in word only but also indeed
[18:09] I believe that Christ has everything for
[18:12] us that we need everything we need to
[18:16] overcome everything we need to walk
[18:18] before him in a victorious life I
[18:21] believe the keys to those things that we
[18:25] need are found in the Word of God and
[18:27] when we pursue them in the written word
[18:30] we're giving an opportunity for the
[18:33] Living Word to stand up in us and begin
[18:37] to bring these things to pass
[18:40] in our lives this is what I think is so
[18:43] important about allowing the Holy Spirit
[18:46] to reveal truth to us is you know
[18:49] sometimes truth can can feel so far away
[18:53] so unattainable but with the Spirit of
[18:57] God quickens it to you you realize that
[19:00] you're not attaining you're not you're
[19:03] not all you're doing is laying a hold of
[19:05] something to the best of your strength
[19:07] and ability but it's the Spirit of God
[19:09] that's taking the hold of you and it
[19:12] becomes the responsibility of God
[19:14] to bring his word to pass in your life
[19:16] when you're doing your part and our part
[19:20] is to to discover what this is labor
[19:23] what labor are we to do so that we can
[19:28] enter in to the rest that we read about
[19:31] in Hebrews chapter four in the same
[19:34] manner that Israel did not enter Canaan
[19:37] they didn't enter into the fullness of
[19:40] the promise of God not as a generation
[19:42] it was the generation after and why was
[19:46] that it was due to unbelief there are
[19:48] many Christians who will not experience
[19:51] all that Christ has for them in this
[19:55] hour in their lives and for the same
[19:59] cause unbelief so at the base of it all
[20:03] we've got to make sure that the issue of
[20:07] unbelief is forever settled in our life
[20:10] the Bible tells us right there in
[20:13] Hebrews 3:19 so we see they could not
[20:16] enter in why because of unbelief
[20:20] verse 12 began by telling us the reason
[20:24] that we must labor to enter into rest
[20:28] and remove the threat of unbelief from
[20:31] stopping us the way that we do that is
[20:34] by recognizing the Word of God as our
[20:38] weapon not just against the devil but
[20:41] the Word of God is also our weapon
[20:43] against unbelief it truly is the more we
[20:48] read who God is not just what he's done
[20:52] but who he is and allow the Spirit of
[20:55] the Lord to make that personal and I
[20:58] think I a couple times a goal and we met
[21:01] together this way I I was just giving
[21:04] some simple instruction about how to
[21:06] pray the word you just take the promises
[21:09] of God as you read them and begin to
[21:12] pray them father I read in your word
[21:15] that it is your desire to give me your
[21:20] kingdom it is your desire to work the
[21:25] works of righteousness in me and through
[21:28] me and I'm having a hard time Lord
[21:30] figuring out how this is would you allow
[21:34] your word to be quickened in me right
[21:36] now so that I might begin to flow in
[21:39] understanding so that I might know where
[21:42] to attach my faith and how I might begin
[21:45] to move forward in actually seeing the
[21:49] fulfillment of this word in my life as
[21:52] an individual I think sometimes we spend
[21:55] a lot of time disqualifying ourselves
[21:58] when the Spirit of God is trying to
[22:00] qualify us it is by grace it's by grace
[22:05] that we are saved it is not of works
[22:08] lest any man should boast and maybe we
[22:11] have to be reminded of that over and
[22:13] over and over again all what a price he
[22:16] has paid if you're watching this program
[22:19] right now and you are still under the
[22:22] heavy burden of sin unbelief still rules
[22:26] in your life and you have never fully
[22:30] committed yourself to Jesus Christ maybe
[22:34] you've never prayed a simple sinner's
[22:37] prayer Lord come into my heart I believe
[22:40] that Jesus is the Son of God the Word of
[22:45] God made flesh and that his blood is
[22:48] ever sufficient to not only cover my sin
[22:52] but to remit them as though they were
[22:55] never committed in the first place if
[22:56] you've never prayed a prayer of simple
[22:59] faith like that I encourage you to do
[23:03] that even now invite him to
[23:06] come in to break the chain and the hold
[23:09] of sin and unbelief over your life and
[23:12] to allow the life of Jesus Christ to
[23:16] begin to operate in your spirit and in
[23:19] your soul this is what is available it
[23:22] it is available to you those of you who
[23:26] have never experienced it you have very
[23:29] little to lose and everything to gain by
[23:32] just simply giving faith a try if you
[23:36] can believe if you can believe that
[23:39] Jesus is the Son of God shed his blood
[23:42] to redeem you raised again on the third
[23:46] day and now stands as an intercessor and
[23:49] a mediator for your life if you can only
[23:52] believe that if you can only fellowship
[23:55] that with your faith and trust that God
[23:58] will sort out the rest then your new
[24:01] birth can begin even now your new life
[24:04] can begin even now as you invite Jesus
[24:07] to come in now in Hebrews chapter four
[24:10] verse one we were reading in verse
[24:14] eleven and twelve but in verse one it
[24:17] says let us therefore fear I find
[24:20] another paradox here you know it's a
[24:23] paradox when the Bible says let us
[24:26] therefore labor to enter into rest it's
[24:30] also a paradox for me when the scripture
[24:33] says let us therefore fear because if I
[24:36] know anything about the Bible I can tell
[24:39] you over and over and over again it says
[24:42] do not be afraid be thou not afraid
[24:45] don't be afraid don't fear fear not
[24:49] because these are the instructions of
[24:52] even the Lord Jesus Christ don't be
[24:55] afraid don't fear but here the Apostle
[24:58] is telling us to fear to be afraid so
[25:02] there must be another kind of fear the
[25:05] Bible tells us that fear brings torment
[25:08] and that perfect love casteth out fear
[25:11] but the scripture says here let us
[25:14] therefore fear lest a promise being
[25:18] left us of entering into his rest any of
[25:22] you should seem to come short of it
[25:25] the Amplified Bible says it this way
[25:27] therefore while the promise of entering
[25:31] his rest still holds and is offered
[25:36] today let us be afraid to distrust it
[25:40] let any of you lest any of you should
[25:44] think he has come too late and has come
[25:47] short of reaching it so we're to be very
[25:50] concerned very very concerned that we
[25:55] don't allow unbelief to keep us from
[25:59] entering in to the promise of rest the
[26:04] new American Standard says therefore let
[26:06] us fear if while a promise remains of
[26:09] entering his rest any one of you may
[26:12] seem to have come short of it and the
[26:16] complete Jewish Bible says therefore let
[26:18] us be terrified of the possibility that
[26:21] even though the promise of entering his
[26:24] rest remains any of you might be judged
[26:28] to have fallen short of it this is clear
[26:31] in almost all of these translations that
[26:35] we have a promise of rest it remains it
[26:39] is intact it has not expired the Lord is
[26:44] inviting you and I to come out of the
[26:47] land of struggle to come out of that
[26:49] mental anguish that we can easily find
[26:53] ourselves in and come into a place of
[26:56] trust a place of confidence a place of
[26:59] dependency and I believe the Apostle is
[27:03] telling us here there's only one thing
[27:05] that would keep us out of the promise of
[27:07] rest and that is unbelief so what must
[27:12] we do we must deal with our unbelief in
[27:15] in verse 2 of Hebrews 4 King James says
[27:19] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[27:22] well as unto them here's the key very
[27:26] very important key I hope you will catch
[27:29] it with me for unto
[27:31] us was the gospel preached as well as
[27:33] unto them but the word preached did not
[27:38] profit them not being mixed with faith
[27:42] in them that heard it now this is
[27:47] serious business to me because all of
[27:50] them that whole generation that was led
[27:56] out by the supernatural hand of God in
[27:59] the exodus out of slavery years of
[28:03] oppression years of slavery with no
[28:07] freedom to serve God and live for God
[28:10] the way that they desired to do so fully
[28:14] under this oppression and now God
[28:17] supernaturally raises up a leader and
[28:20] brings them out and into the wilderness
[28:22] and the promise of the Promised Land was
[28:26] to every one of them every one of them
[28:29] had the promise that they could enter
[28:32] into the land of promise but for some of
[28:37] them the promise was not a reality and
[28:40] the reason is they fell short of it as
[28:45] the Apostle said they fell short of it
[28:48] and what was the requirement that they
[28:50] missed it was labor they did not labor
[28:55] to enter into the rest now what was the
[28:58] labor well here it tells us the labor oh
[29:02] my the work the effort that was the
[29:06] exertion all of these words that we used
[29:09] when looking at these verses of
[29:11] scripture every bit of that was simply
[29:14] adding their faith to the word that was
[29:19] being preached to them they sat under
[29:23] Moses the great prophet of God and he
[29:26] was giving them the mind of God
[29:28] revealing to them the desires of God his
[29:33] desire was to have a relationship with
[29:36] them as a people as a group as a nation
[29:41] we remember that on Mount Sinai
[29:44] when that covenant was cut and we
[29:49] sometimes refer to that as a Catawba
[29:51] because this is the Hebrew word for for
[29:54] the marriage covenant and here God was
[29:57] giving Israel as a people a marriage
[30:02] contract
[30:03] it was the Torah it was the books of
[30:06] instruction it was the law of God and in
[30:10] that was God promising what he would
[30:14] give what he would do what his part of
[30:17] the contract or covenant would be and
[30:19] also what he would require of the other
[30:23] party the nation of Israel and many
[30:26] heard it and they said mm hmm hmm they
[30:30] nodded their head some said a man some
[30:34] said praise the Lord
[30:35] you know like we do in church uh-huh
[30:38] that's right sometimes I tell the folks
[30:43] at our church could you nod your head a
[30:45] little louder because you're getting
[30:47] very very quiet and I realize that
[30:49] that's not always a sign of whether
[30:52] someone is hearing or applying the word
[30:55] that they hear but God wasn't just
[30:58] asking for an amen out of the Israeli
[31:02] people or the the nation of Israel he
[31:05] was asking for them to labor and the
[31:09] labor was not in the keeping of the
[31:11] Covenant all of the laws this was part
[31:14] of the love contract I totally
[31:16] understand that but where they missed it
[31:18] was not in that because listen God asks
[31:21] something from them and then he provided
[31:25] a system of offerings and sacrifices to
[31:29] cover them when they failed
[31:31] I mean God was really setting something
[31:34] up beautifully yes he wanted
[31:37] righteousness yes he wanted the people
[31:39] to live above unbelief and above sin but
[31:43] he knew that they would not all be able
[31:46] to measure up to the mark and so what
[31:48] did he do he outlined for them by the
[31:51] prophet Moses very very carefully very
[31:54] specifically for this sin for this
[31:57] a transgression of the law you'll bring
[31:59] this this animal and it will be treated
[32:02] this way and this is how the priests
[32:04] will handle it and so forth and so God
[32:07] was requiring something of them but then
[32:09] he was providing the offering providing
[32:13] the instruction that was needed to make
[32:15] everything all right
[32:16] and all God seemed to be asking of them
[32:19] was that they believed that they
[32:22] overcome that enemy of unbelief and that
[32:26] they mix their faith with the word when
[32:30] I when I hear that expression what I get
[32:33] is you know maybe it's easier to have
[32:37] faith for someone else but this is not
[32:41] one of those situations where that's
[32:43] going to work I've got faith for someone
[32:47] else for instance have you ever had a a
[32:50] malady or an infirmity in your body
[32:53] you've prayed and prayed and you have
[32:55] tried to stand on God's promise for your
[32:58] own healing and then someone you loved
[33:00] or cared about a church friend a family
[33:03] member had also some infirmities some
[33:07] sickness and all of a sudden your faith
[33:09] would just rise up for that person and
[33:12] you would stand on the promise of God
[33:14] for them and my you would even see in
[33:18] many cases you've even seen the miracle
[33:20] you've seen the Lord perform it was
[33:23] easier somehow maybe seems to have faith
[33:26] for someone else than to have faith for
[33:29] yourself and this is kind of what the
[33:32] Apostle Paul is talking about in Hebrews
[33:34] three and four you can't just have faith
[33:38] that the promises of God are yes a man
[33:41] for someone else if you do then unbelief
[33:46] will keep you from entering into the
[33:48] fullness of what Christ has made
[33:51] available for you and I in this hour to
[33:55] be partakers of him means that we
[33:59] receive the benefit of being a part of
[34:03] him of being connected to him
[34:07] participating with him in the plan of
[34:10] redemption
[34:11] and the enemy doesn't want that he
[34:13] doesn't want that he wants you and I
[34:15] wavering in unbelief the the enemy is
[34:19] actually less challenged by your faith
[34:22] for someone else he is more challenged
[34:26] by what faith you have for your own life
[34:30] to believe that these promises of God
[34:34] are for you let me read it just a little
[34:37] bit more in the amplified verse 2 now
[34:41] we're talking about the explanation why
[34:45] did unbelief keep them out why did the
[34:48] word not perhaps why it was not fully
[34:54] effective in their life why did it not
[34:58] profit them and the answer was not being
[35:01] mixed with faith in them that heard it
[35:04] amplified version says for indeed we
[35:08] have the glad tidings the gospel of God
[35:10] proclaimed to us just as truly as they
[35:14] the Israelites of old did when the good
[35:17] news of deliverance from bondage came to
[35:19] them but the message they heard did not
[35:23] benefit them because it was not mixed
[35:26] with faith with the leaning oh my here
[35:31] is an explanation of this faith with the
[35:35] leaning of the entire personality on God
[35:40] in absolute trust and confidence in his
[35:45] power wisdom and goodness can I read
[35:50] that again it really says something to
[35:54] me because it was not mixed with faith
[35:57] and then here in parentheses the
[35:59] amplified says with the leaning of the
[36:03] entire personality everything stephen
[36:08] shelley is everything i am i love the
[36:14] way it's worded with my entire
[36:16] personality everything that makes me up
[36:20] i've got to lean with all of that
[36:24] on the promise of God in order to see it
[36:29] come to pass in my life with the leaning
[36:32] of the entire personality on God in
[36:37] absolute trust and confidence in his
[36:43] power that's not just saying well I
[36:47] believe God III I think God is able I
[36:50] believe he could if he wanted to that's
[36:54] not what we're talking about he said he
[36:57] wanted to his word obligates him he's
[37:02] already said he wanted to heal he's
[37:04] already said he wants to deliver
[37:06] hallelujah he's already said that he
[37:09] wants to set the captives free we're
[37:12] still trying to discover the will of God
[37:14] that's been made clear to us by the Word
[37:18] of God the will of God is revealed by
[37:23] the word of God this is how we know what
[37:26] his will and what his desire toward us
[37:29] is and so we're called to lean I must
[37:34] say it again to lean with our entire
[37:38] personality on God in absolute trust and
[37:43] confidence in his power his wisdom and
[37:46] his goodness let me ask you do you have
[37:48] absolute confidence in God's power do
[37:53] you have absolute confidence in God's
[37:56] wisdom do you have absolute confidence
[38:00] in God's goodness if you do then you're
[38:06] leaning with your whole personality
[38:09] everything you are on the promise of God
[38:12] and you're believing that it's not just
[38:15] for the neighbor it's for you this
[38:20] promise is for you and your obligation
[38:26] is small really and that is to take your
[38:32] faith well I don't have much faith the
[38:35] Bible says well the Bible gives us four
[38:37] the definition of faith faith is the
[38:41] substance of things hoped for and the
[38:43] evidence of things not seen and then the
[38:47] Bible tells us that we are given the
[38:50] measure of faith so you and I possess
[38:54] the faith that is needed to take God at
[38:57] His Word and when we hear the word of
[39:01] God you know I just
[39:04] I'd like to advise you just practice
[39:07] this maybe you're alone in your home
[39:09] right now and here's a good opportunity
[39:12] for you to practice mixing your faith
[39:15] with the word if I say something in the
[39:18] remainder of this program that you truly
[39:22] believe is the Word of God then I want
[39:25] you to mix your faith with it and say
[39:27] that's mine that is my promise Lord you
[39:31] didn't just make that to Israel you
[39:33] didn't just make that to the Apostles or
[39:35] the early church you didn't just make
[39:37] those two your what some people might
[39:40] think you're you're frozen Chosin or
[39:43] your or your favorite view over here but
[39:46] you've made that promise to me and I'm
[39:48] going to attach my faith to it and
[39:51] confess that every promise in your word
[39:54] is mine
[39:56] and I'm going to stand on it when the
[39:58] enemy comes with the contrary a report
[40:00] or testimony when the doctor says this
[40:04] and yet the Word of God says something
[40:06] else I'm gonna respect the doctor but
[40:08] I'm gonna stand on God's Word I'm going
[40:13] to mix join my faith with God's Word and
[40:19] I'm going to hold on it kills unbelief
[40:22] your faith attached to God's Word kills
[40:27] unbelief it drives it right out of your
[40:31] life and why is getting rid of unbelief
[40:34] so important because unbelief can keep
[40:37] you out of rest it's like what we
[40:39] sometimes call a hamster wheel or a
[40:43] gerbil wheel you know these little pets
[40:46] that people sometimes have in their own
[40:47] I have to
[40:48] be honest I've never quite figured this
[40:50] out I'm not really sure why even though
[40:53] my children had two of these little
[40:55] creatures for a while I never could
[40:58] quite get myself attached to them
[41:01] because they reminded me too much of of
[41:03] some other things that you want to get
[41:05] rid of but here you welcome these little
[41:07] creatures into your house and you put
[41:10] them in the in the aquarium type thing
[41:14] I guess fish go in an aquarium but but a
[41:17] cage well I tell you you better make it
[41:20] a good one because they'll know their
[41:22] way right out that's for sure but then
[41:24] you put one of those little exercisers
[41:26] in there
[41:27] those wheels like a ferris wheel or
[41:30] something and though I started to say
[41:32] the little rat forgive me but you know
[41:34] what I mean that little creature gets on
[41:37] there and he starts running around
[41:38] running running running running well
[41:41] after a while that thing goes around so
[41:45] many times it starts getting a little
[41:47] bit tight and squeaky and that's when
[41:51] the I'm ready for the pets to go then
[41:53] because I well yes you can get a new
[41:56] wheel but they're just going to run that
[41:58] one into the same condition they just
[42:00] run run run run run run run run and that
[42:03] thing starts squeaking and squeaking and
[42:05] they're not going anywhere and many
[42:08] times that's how we are in our Christian
[42:11] race we're on the gerbil wheel just
[42:13] running running running not going
[42:16] anywhere at all and the Lord is inviting
[42:19] us to have something more than a rat
[42:23] race the Lord is inviting us to have
[42:26] something more than just Christianity
[42:29] light he wants us to understand what it
[42:33] means to be filled with the very life of
[42:36] God and to enter into that place of rest
[42:40] where the works the good works that we
[42:44] do we do them out of love we do them
[42:47] because we want to serve Him not because
[42:51] we want to earn his favor
[42:53] it's only a gerbil wheel when we have
[42:56] this mindset that I have to do this so
[42:59] that he will love me I
[43:01] to do this so that he will accept me I
[43:04] have to do this so that I can find favor
[43:07] with God I'm telling you nothing could
[43:11] be further from the truth of the Bible
[43:12] then my works the power of my works you
[43:18] you really think that I could do
[43:20] something good enough or wonderful
[43:23] enough that it would it would cause God
[43:25] to love me more than he already loves me
[43:28] I don't think so
[43:29] I think that we have done that with
[43:32] religion we talked about it recently how
[43:36] we've complicated New Testament
[43:38] Christianity I believe in good works I
[43:41] believe that according to the scripture
[43:43] faith is demonstrated with good works
[43:47] and that's the right order the right
[43:50] order is we're not doing good so that we
[43:54] can find favor with God and so that he
[43:57] will love us and accept us but in fact
[43:59] we're doing good works because we know
[44:03] that He loves us because we know that he
[44:07] has accepted us because we know that we
[44:11] have found favor in his sight our hearts
[44:14] are so filled with gratitude and
[44:16] Thanksgiving that all we want to do is
[44:19] please him all we want to say is things
[44:22] that would please the Lord and advance
[44:25] his kingdom do you understand how easy
[44:27] it is then to get the cart in front of
[44:29] the horse I've got to do do do-do-do so
[44:33] that I can be loved of the father and
[44:36] I'm telling you folk that that's really
[44:39] unbelief because it's not the word we're
[44:42] not believing the word when we believe a
[44:44] system like that and so that will keep
[44:47] us out of a place of rest when I'm
[44:51] talking about spiritual rest I mean
[44:54] confidence and trust that I'm covered by
[44:59] the blood he loves me he has chosen me
[45:03] he wants to be a part of my life in fact
[45:07] he wants to be my life he wants to be
[45:11] the center of my life and why wouldn't I
[45:13] want him
[45:14] b-because the more i allow him to be
[45:18] lord over my life i'm telling you the
[45:22] greater it gets the greater the
[45:24] relationship grows and yes we begin to
[45:27] see faith accomplishing great things in
[45:31] our hearts as individuals the complete
[45:35] Jewish Bible said for good news has also
[45:39] been proclaimed to us just as it was to
[45:42] them but the message they heard didn't
[45:45] do them any good because those who heard
[45:48] it did not combine it with trust that's
[45:52] what we're trying to say sometimes I use
[45:55] the expression fellowship the word and
[45:59] that's because I know you can't
[46:01] fellowship a book but you can fellowship
[46:03] the person that's revealed by this holy
[46:06] book and to fellowship him means to stay
[46:10] connected to stay connected much more
[46:14] than the occasional text to understand
[46:17] what I mean
[46:18] but I don't even want to say daily you
[46:22] know when I was a boy they used to sing
[46:24] this song as a special song in church
[46:26] one day at a time sweet Jesus and now we
[46:30] understand that even a day at a time is
[46:33] not enough to connect with him we need
[46:36] to do it through the day we need to give
[46:38] him praise through the day lord I thank
[46:40] you for that I thank you for that
[46:43] you know it's tempting sometimes when
[46:45] something good happens in our life to
[46:47] kind of pet ourselves on the back and
[46:49] say oh I did good
[46:51] I really did good but that didn't but
[46:53] I've learned it is so much more
[46:54] effective to say lord I thank you that
[46:57] your grace your grace has accomplished
[47:00] that for me Lord I'm so thankful that
[47:03] your spirit led me into a place where I
[47:06] could allow you to do such and such a
[47:08] thing in my life and that builds your
[47:11] faith when you see God moving and
[47:14] working according to your prayer and
[47:15] your faith it strengthens your faith
[47:18] because faith is like a muscle the more
[47:20] we use it the more we apply it the more
[47:23] we stretch it even believing God for
[47:25] bigger things I want to be able to
[47:27] believe
[47:28] for for what looks impossible because
[47:31] that's how faith operates anyway to
[47:34] transform the impossible to the possible
[47:37] for the glory of God I'm not talking
[47:39] about things just to accomplish them for
[47:42] myself I'm not talking about just to get
[47:45] riches for myself I'm talking about to
[47:47] accomplish things for the precious name
[47:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ and for and for
[47:53] the sake of his kingdom so we can be we
[47:57] can be united with the Word of God by
[48:01] adding our faith to it by fellows
[48:04] shipping it with everything that's
[48:05] within us let me see if I can get this
[48:09] verse again in the in the amplified I
[48:12] wanted to get the second part of that
[48:13] and I think I may have stopped reading
[48:15] it in the middle so I'm gonna just read
[48:18] verse 2 all the way through again for
[48:20] indeed we have had the glad tidings the
[48:23] gospel of God proclaimed to us as truly
[48:26] as they the Israelites of old did when
[48:29] they when the good news of deliverance
[48:31] from bondage came to them but the
[48:34] message they heard did not benefit them
[48:35] because it was not mixed with faith and
[48:38] then that beautiful definition with the
[48:40] leaning of the entire personality on God
[48:43] in absolute trust and confidence in his
[48:47] power his wisdom and His goodness by
[48:50] those who heard it neither were they
[48:52] united in faith with the ones who heard
[48:57] it who did believe and in the amplified
[49:01] it says Joshua and Caleb their names are
[49:05] mentioned here so they they had in other
[49:10] words not only did it keep them out
[49:14] because they didn't mix their faith with
[49:17] the word that God had given to them
[49:19] through the Prophet but it actually
[49:21] broke off their fellowship with those
[49:23] who did believe Joshua and Caleb were
[49:26] taking the word of the Lord seriously
[49:29] and we know that for instance in the
[49:32] story of the spies the 12 spies that
[49:35] went in to spy out the land to see if
[49:38] indeed they were able to take it and the
[49:40] Bible tells us that 10 of those spies
[49:43] came back with complaints ten of them
[49:46] came back with gripes but here came
[49:50] Joshua and Caleb with the grapes it's
[49:55] not that Joshua and Caleb didn't see the
[49:58] Giants it's not that they didn't see
[50:01] that there was going to be difficulty
[50:03] and that it wasn't going to be an
[50:05] automatic surrender on the other side of
[50:08] the river but they chose rather to
[50:11] emphasize to focus on a land that was
[50:15] flowing with milk and honey and their
[50:18] testimony was a little bit different
[50:20] than the other spies the other spies
[50:23] said why those giants are there and they
[50:25] look at us as though we were
[50:27] grasshoppers and surely they're going to
[50:30] crunch us underneath their sandals so to
[50:33] speak but Joshua and Caleb their
[50:36] testimony was we are well able to take
[50:41] the land let us go up at once for we are
[50:45] well able to take the land the ten spies
[50:48] were looking at themselves they were
[50:51] looking at the ability of the people to
[50:54] be able to go in and conquer the Giants
[50:57] Joshua and Caleb were looking rather at
[51:01] the power of their God remember the same
[51:04] God that brought them all the way
[51:07] through the wilderness you mean to tell
[51:09] me the God who drowned Pharaoh's armies
[51:12] and chariots in the Red Sea is not big
[51:15] enough to deal with some Giants over
[51:17] there on the other side of the river
[51:19] that's how some of the people were
[51:22] acting but not Joshua and Caleb our God
[51:26] can deliver our God is victorious our
[51:30] God will give us the victory all we have
[51:33] to do is get up and get over there and
[51:35] by making such a testimony what were
[51:38] they doing mixing their faith with the
[51:41] word if they would have just folded
[51:44] their hands and sat in the little
[51:46] service and said well we're going to
[51:49] wait right here on God and
[51:51] one day God will come and he will make
[51:53] away and he will deliver us and one day
[51:57] all the Giants will die with the disease
[51:59] and then it'll be easy for us to go in
[52:01] well that would've been very passive no
[52:03] they didn't sit there and wait on the
[52:06] deliverance they put their faith in as
[52:08] an investment and they said the God who
[52:12] has brought us this far is the God who
[52:14] will take us the rest of the way so
[52:16] let's get up and get at it let's do
[52:19] something with the word that we've heard
[52:22] and what did they do they mix their
[52:24] faith with it and they got up and got
[52:26] into action I hope I know that I'm
[52:30] really pressing this issue and I pray
[52:33] that you won't get weary with me I pray
[52:36] that you'll get inspired if you and I
[52:39] are willing to put our faith into action
[52:42] joining it with the Word of God then the
[52:45] full effectiveness of the word becomes
[52:48] our inheritance everything God promised
[52:51] to do he will do for us we begin to come
[52:56] right under that beautiful promise it's
[53:01] a personal promise now to me I think I
[53:04] mentioned this phrase we used to sing
[53:05] this little chorus every promise in the
[53:08] book is mine every chapter every verse
[53:11] every line I'm trusting in His grace
[53:15] divine every promise in the book is mine
[53:19] and I just encourage you oh okay maybe
[53:23] it sounds a little strange to somebody
[53:26] maybe it sounds juvenile even you're
[53:29] just telling Sunday school stories and
[53:31] expecting us to believe well all I know
[53:34] is this friend with every fiber of who I
[53:38] am I believe this book I can't tell you
[53:42] that there are not times that the enemy
[53:44] has moved against me with unbelief I
[53:47] can't tell you that there have not been
[53:49] times that I struggled and staggered to
[53:53] stand firm on my belief in this word but
[53:57] I can tell you at this moment in my life
[53:59] every fiber of who I am I believe that
[54:02] everything God has said
[54:04] this book he is more than able to do and
[54:07] I have seen him do what he promised that
[54:12] he would do I mentioned a few broadcast
[54:15] back that with my own eyes the eyes that
[54:18] I'm looking at this camera with right
[54:20] now I have seen the power of God
[54:23] demonstrated in ways that we read about
[54:26] in the scripture I've seen cancerous
[54:30] tumors fall off of people's bodies
[54:33] before my eyes in the name of the Lord
[54:36] Jesus Christ
[54:37] I've seen the blinded eyes opened and
[54:40] I've been present when deaf ears were
[54:43] unstopped I've heard people speak their
[54:47] first words as adults I've heard the
[54:52] testimonies of those who heard for the
[54:55] first time the singing of the bird and
[54:58] the running of the water to to make the
[55:00] to make the dish water to wash the
[55:03] dishes I remember the little sister who
[55:05] got healed and she was thanking the Lord
[55:08] for every sound that you and I would
[55:10] take for granted she even testified I
[55:13] got on the bus and wrote downtown to do
[55:16] my business and I heard the motors
[55:18] running and I thanked God that he had
[55:21] healed me and opened my ears even some
[55:24] of the noises that would be a little bit
[55:26] annoying to you and I she was thanking
[55:29] God with tears lord thank you for for
[55:32] the she said I heard the neighbor out
[55:34] building the fence pounding the hammer
[55:36] you and I might we might get tired of
[55:39] that but she was so grateful so thankful
[55:41] I have seen these things I've heard
[55:43] these things
[55:44] I'm not taking somebody else's word for
[55:47] what God is able to do I'm telling you
[55:49] as a living witness that God is able to
[55:53] do exceedingly abundantly above that
[55:56] which we could even ask or think we
[55:59] approach him with our faith joined to
[56:02] the Word of God and we believe let's do
[56:05] that right now father in the name of the
[56:07] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah I
[56:11] joined my faith with with many
[56:15] who are lifting their faith to you right
[56:18] now
[56:19] believing Lord whatever their confession
[56:23] is if it's according to your word in
[56:25] faith I believe it and I stand with them
[56:28] in this moment because I know you are
[56:30] still the healer and you are still able
[56:33] to deliver the addicted and the
[56:36] oppressed and the depressed I know that
[56:39] you are still able Lord to provide and
[56:43] and to bring into our lives what we have
[56:48] need of and so I'm asking you right now
[56:51] in in that precious name of the Lord and
[56:55] according to the promise of your great
[56:57] word I'm asking you to move right now
[57:00] Lord I ask you for this I ask you could
[57:03] there be a witness in in the home of
[57:07] those watching right now could they just
[57:09] I it's not my feeling Lord I know but
[57:13] maybe you just let them feel something
[57:15] feel your spirit your presence just
[57:18] moving right now to confirm to them that
[57:22] there's a God on the other end of this
[57:24] prayer and that you are more than able
[57:27] if they are willing to walk before you
[57:29] with simple trust leaning their whole
[57:33] personality on you and their full
[57:37] confidence and trust in your wisdom in
[57:41] your goodness in your power Lord let
[57:45] them have confirmation that you are the
[57:48] same yesterday and today and forever we
[57:53] ask this in the lovely name of the Lord

[57:58] requests and your testimonies because I
