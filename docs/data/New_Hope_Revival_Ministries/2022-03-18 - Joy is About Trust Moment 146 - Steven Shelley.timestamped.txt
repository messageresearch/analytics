[0:00] joy is about a confidence
[0:03] it's about a trust
[0:04] [Music]
[0:12] you want to recognize that there's an
[0:14] enemy
[0:15] who is out to steal to kill to destroy
[0:20] he does not want you to have joy
[0:22] he doesn't even want you to have peace
[0:25] he doesn't want you to feel the love of
[0:28] god in your life he doesn't want you to
[0:31] be able to function
[0:34] he wants to fill you with such anxiety
[0:36] and fear and depression and oppression
[0:40] and pain and all these other things the
[0:42] spirit of god said woundedness
[0:46] and here is the thing about woundedness
[0:49] everybody under the sound of my voice
[0:54] knows what it feels like to be wounded
[0:58] we've all had anything from a boo-boo
[1:04] to a major surgery
[1:07] in the natural
[1:09] and even in the
[1:10] spiritual we know what it means to be
[1:14] gob-smacked
[1:15] [Music]
[1:18] slapped around
[1:20] beat up drugged through the dirt
[1:23] we've experienced these things but we
[1:26] choose as the overcoming bride of jesus
[1:30] christ and his invitation
[1:33] to come and lay all of that before him
[1:36] and he pours the fatness of joy all over
[1:39] it did you know the bible said he would
[1:41] fill us with the oil of gladness the oil
[1:44] of joy that word oil there is the fat
[1:47] he wants to fill us with the fat of
[1:50] gladness with the fat of joy he wants to
[1:55] pour on us
[1:56] everything we need to give him the
[1:59] praise
[2:00] that he rightfully deserves
[2:03] and joy is not about a feeling
[2:06] joy is about a confidence
[2:09] it's about a trust
[2:11] it's about complete trust
[2:14] it's about total trust
[2:16] it's about completely and totally
[2:18] trusting the lord who has called you how
[2:22] many of you believe he who has started a
[2:24] good work
[2:28] he who has started a good work
[2:30] is more than able to finish that work in
[2:34] your life he is both the author
[2:36] [Music]
[2:38] and the who
[2:39] and the finisher of our faith
[2:43] he's not only given to every individual
[2:45] in this room a seed of faith
[2:49] a measure of faith but he has poured his
[2:52] oil on that faith and the more he does
[2:55] the more we use it
[2:56] the more he anoints it the more we
[2:58] exercise it and and we use it and we
[3:01] stretch it
[3:02] and it becomes stronger and stronger and
[3:05] stronger and stronger and stronger
[3:08] and it's not how much faith you have
[3:10] it's whether or not you you choose to
[3:13] leave your faith in place
[3:16] or whether you choose to withdraw it and
[3:17] pull it back you've got to keep putting
[3:19] your faith in
