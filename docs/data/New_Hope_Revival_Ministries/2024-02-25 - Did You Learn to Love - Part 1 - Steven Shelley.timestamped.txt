[1:07:30] stand you'll be sitting a while and we
[1:07:34] want to go to the word today and I
[1:07:36] apologize to you and to brother gy for
[1:07:39] not being in here I didn't know we were
[1:07:41] going to do prayer request first and I
[1:07:43] just had to leave for a moment and when
[1:07:45] I got back here come Jesse to pray over
[1:07:48] the requests that I hadn't yet made and
[1:07:51] these are requests a lot of them have
[1:07:52] been sent in and and I and and I'm sorry
[1:07:55] about that I didn't mean to break the
[1:07:57] order but uh Jesse thank you for making
[1:08:00] the best of it being ready to pray
[1:08:03] anyhow and uh well today is the oneyear
[1:08:06] anniversary of my mother's passing and I
[1:08:09] wouldn't bring her back I wouldn't want
[1:08:11] her here uh even if she was in her right
[1:08:14] mind and whole I really wouldn't want to
[1:08:16] bring her back here I prayed too many
[1:08:19] years for the Lord to save her I prayed
[1:08:22] too long for the Lord to deliver her
[1:08:24] from all the addictions that had her
[1:08:25] bound and I wouldn't want her to be back
[1:08:28] here and have to keep fighting the fight
[1:08:30] that she's already one but I can't help
[1:08:33] but think of it you just can't help it
[1:08:37] and uh I'm thankful for the years that I
[1:08:39] had and I I wish so much that uh that it
[1:08:43] would have worked out I waited a little
[1:08:45] late in life to be married I wish that
[1:08:48] she could have met this sweet little
[1:08:49] baby girl that's soon going to to come
[1:08:53] but uh maybe
[1:08:55] somehow uh she will know and uh and see
[1:09:00] uh I think that they are given glimpses
[1:09:02] sometime of good life down here I don't
[1:09:06] believe they know anything about our
[1:09:08] struggles that wouldn't be that wouldn't
[1:09:10] be in his presence would
[1:09:12] it uh that wouldn't really be heaven but
[1:09:15] or or in that other dimension if they
[1:09:18] had to worry about us but I think maybe
[1:09:21] sometimes the Lord may allow them to
[1:09:22] catch a glimpse of of the good things
[1:09:24] that are going on down here and uh but
[1:09:28] there're they don't miss
[1:09:30] us I hate to tell you that they don't
[1:09:33] miss us if you think they're grieving
[1:09:35] cause cause you're not with them they're
[1:09:38] not they have everything those that are
[1:09:40] with the Lord they have everything their
[1:09:42] soul longed for and we grieve until we
[1:09:45] see them and then we won't ever grieve
[1:09:47] again did you know you'll never miss
[1:09:49] your lost loved ones if there are some
[1:09:51] that don't make it you'll never miss
[1:09:53] them right you'll never even know they
[1:09:56] didn't make it you know that song about
[1:09:59] the the circle being broke you'll never
[1:10:01] know if it was
[1:10:02] broken can you imagine somebody said I
[1:10:04] can't imagine that you wouldn't remember
[1:10:07] oh you won't you won't remember God

[1:10:12] torment you through eternity so if
[1:10:14] you're going to pray any prayers for
[1:10:16] them you wouldn't want to wait till you

[1:10:55] 228 many many years ago and uh we don't
[1:11:00] have a whole lot to say about it we
[1:11:01] don't uh have it hanging in the church
[1:11:04] or anything but but we still believe I
[1:11:07] still believe that God has used it as a
[1:11:10] as a sign uh but remember the signs are
[1:11:14] not for
[1:11:16] believers if you're waiting for a
[1:11:19] sign you must not be a
[1:11:21] believer the Bible says said the signs
[1:11:24] are for the
[1:11:26] unbelievers so we're not looking for
[1:11:29] signs if God sends them then we wait for
[1:11:32] the voice I'm most thankful for the
[1:11:35] voice I have the photographs and I share
[1:11:38] them if they need to be shared but uh
[1:11:41] that is not why I'm still walking in
[1:11:43] this truth it's because it lines up with
[1:11:47] the word of God we take everything back
[1:11:51] to the scripture it's important isn't it
[1:11:54] yes so we are here I know you're
[1:11:57] standing but we are here and today I'm
[1:12:00] going to be reading in 1 John chapter
[1:12:04] 4 beginning in verse
[1:12:08] 7 for those of you who might be tuning
[1:12:11] in to this service I I saw Saints in the
[1:12:15] Netherlands I I saw many from across the
[1:12:20] United States South Africa
[1:12:24] I saw India and
[1:12:26] Nigeria and other places mentioned by
[1:12:29] name thank you so much for letting us
[1:12:32] know where you are streaming the service
[1:12:35] from if there's anyone who hasn't been
[1:12:38] with us in this series The Lord spoke to
[1:12:42] us prophetically for this Gregorian year
[1:12:46] of
[1:12:47] 2024 and he told us it was going to be a
[1:12:49] year of mountain climbing I've already
[1:12:52] been up here I've already been having to
[1:12:55] make some uphill
[1:12:57] strides but remember that when you've
[1:12:59] gotten a little bit uh a little bit of
[1:13:01] effort you you've climbed made a few
[1:13:03] feet or so you you don't have to come
[1:13:06] back down right now if you don't want to
[1:13:08] we're on our way now to the top just
[1:13:11] remember that the journey from here on
[1:13:13] out will not be level ground just
[1:13:17] understand that from now on the journey
[1:13:18] is going to be
[1:13:20] uphill somebody said well that's
[1:13:22] terrible news it's actually very good
[1:13:24] news because it means you've arrived at
[1:13:26] Zion
[1:13:28] spiritually and now you're making your
[1:13:30] way
[1:13:31] up because the mountain is not just Pine
[1:13:35] Mountain or or some uh Appalachian
[1:13:38] mountain range the mountain is the Mount
[1:13:41] Zion that we have uh seen in God's word
[1:13:46] associated with with that which is
[1:13:49] eternal and associated with the Throne
[1:13:52] of God amen you know I've had an
[1:13:55] experience where I saw the throne and
[1:13:58] behind the throne was the
[1:14:02] mountain very
[1:14:04] interesting behind the throne was the
[1:14:08] mountain and uh we Are Climbing that
[1:14:12] spiritually if we wanted to be concerned
[1:14:15] about where we are we should be
[1:14:16] concerned if we're
[1:14:18] stalled if we're not moving but as long
[1:14:22] as we're moving it testifies that
[1:14:25] there's Spirit life within us is anybody
[1:14:28] listening this morning there Spirit life
[1:14:30] within us because Zion is not only a
[1:14:34] place sir it's not only a destination
[1:14:38] but Zion is a people and we are the
[1:14:42] people of
[1:14:43] Zion those who are walking in the
[1:14:46] revealed word of the hour we are the
[1:14:49] Zion and so we have great great anti
[1:14:53] anticipation the only thing is walking
[1:14:56] up climbing up a mountain is not always
[1:15:00] easy you lose your breath sometime your
[1:15:04] your shins kind of give you trouble
[1:15:06] sometime even even other muscles that we
[1:15:10] won't talk about but even other muscles
[1:15:12] get strained when you're climbing but oh
[1:15:15] how nice it is to be able to to turn
[1:15:18] around and look out and see I've made
[1:15:20] some progress I'm higher than was before
[1:15:25] and that means the higher I get the the
[1:15:27] farther away I get from The Temptations
[1:15:30] that the enemy has has placed down here
[1:15:33] in the low lands Lord lift me up and let
[1:15:37] me stand by faith on Heaven's table land
[1:15:42] a higher plane than I have found Lord
[1:15:45] plant my feet on higher ground and then
[1:15:49] let me climb some more and so a as we
[1:15:53] get get ready to go to the scripture I
[1:15:54] want to just remind you and mention for
[1:15:57] those who haven't heard the Lord said it
[1:15:59] would be a year of mountain climbing and
[1:16:02] he warned me in the spirit that we
[1:16:05] should be very surefooted we got to know
[1:16:07] where we're putting our feet and we've
[1:16:09] got to calculate and make sure that
[1:16:11] where we plant our feet is solid ground
[1:16:14] that it's not sinking ground that it's
[1:16:17] not rolling ground you know the rocks
[1:16:20] and the gravel will will roll down and
[1:16:22] and you you think you've got a sure
[1:16:24] foothold but you may not so you want to
[1:16:27] watch how do I watch I watch carefully
[1:16:29] in the spirit to make sure that where
[1:16:31] I'm standing is is solid ground and I
[1:16:35] heard five voices giving me five pieces
[1:16:39] of instruction after I asked the Lord
[1:16:42] how will we do it how will we be very
[1:16:45] surefooted how will we do that and the
[1:16:49] first voice I heard was the voice of of
[1:16:53] brother green and he was quoting brother
[1:16:56] brandham and he was saying to me by the
[1:17:00] spirit that we should keep whatever we
[1:17:03] do whatever you do keep your balance in
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:08] scriptures then I heard another voice
[1:17:10] booming out almost like a thunder I
[1:17:14] recognized it to be brother bram's voice
[1:17:16] and he said whatever you do stay in the
[1:17:19] middle of the
[1:17:22] road I heard a female voice sister Ruth
[1:17:26] said praise until the spirit of worship
[1:17:29] go whatever you do whatever you do
[1:17:32] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[1:17:35] worship until the glory comes and then
[1:17:38] stand in the glory now I was going to
[1:17:40] slip out a little bit early a a but I
[1:17:44] couldn't because I was standing in the
[1:17:48] glory that presence of my lover was here
[1:17:53] I felt him in such a profound way I
[1:17:55] didn't want to disturb that well the
[1:17:58] truth is I didn't want to unplug myself
[1:18:01] who would ever want to if you if you
[1:18:03] happen to know you've gotten plugged in
[1:18:05] who'd ever want to
[1:18:08] unplug it's hard it's very hard that's
[1:18:11] why I try not to ever especially if I'm
[1:18:14] conducting I try to never go out but
[1:18:16] sometimes I just absolutely can't help
[1:18:18] myself but I I didn't want to leave in
[1:18:21] the middle of that moment
[1:18:24] when when I could look around this room
[1:18:26] and see such sweet
[1:18:28] Expressions it's one of the things that
[1:18:30] I enjoyed the most the songwriter
[1:18:33] captured
[1:18:34] it Lanny wolf when he wrote surely the
[1:18:37] presence of the Lord is in this place he
[1:18:40] talked about and the glory on each face
[1:18:44] it's one of the things I enjoy the
[1:18:46] most a lot of us we wear a sour
[1:18:51] face I I going to have more than two
[1:18:55] amens boy I can call some names in this
[1:18:58] room but then I'd be I'd be pointing
[1:19:01] back at me because my family says
[1:19:04] sometime you look so
[1:19:06] grumpy well I don't have a
[1:19:09] mirror I don't always know what I look
[1:19:12] how I look what I look and we look
[1:19:15] grumpy sometime there's no better thing
[1:19:17] than to look across a congregation and
[1:19:20] see the glory of the Lord on the
[1:19:22] countenance of the redeemed Hallelujah
[1:19:25] especially when you know they're grumpy
[1:19:27] by
[1:19:28] nature but they get in that presence and
[1:19:30] it makes them sweeter
[1:19:33] woo and you look beautiful sir don't be
[1:19:36] offended when somebody says you look so
[1:19:39] beautiful in that Glory oh it changes
[1:19:43] everything it certainly does and so then
[1:19:46] the fourth voice which I haven't
[1:19:49] mentioned until today it was uh I'll
[1:19:52] tell you in just a moment let me read
[1:19:54] the scriptures first so you can sit down
[1:19:56] some of you look hardly able and I don't
[1:19:58] want to if you always always even if I
[1:20:03] ask you to stand always if you are are
[1:20:06] weak in some way or or pain in some way
[1:20:10] a lot of times when I'm in pain sitting
[1:20:12] down is not what I need I need to do
[1:20:15] stretches but I better not do them on
[1:20:17] the platform right so anyway first John
[1:20:22] chapter 4 but you do what what you need
[1:20:25] to do and verse seven
[1:20:28] beloved let
[1:20:32] us love one another is my tie real
[1:20:37] crooked well it does matter cuz I have
[1:20:40] to see it
[1:20:42] again is said I just loosened it cuz it
[1:20:45] was about to choke me and so I thought I
[1:20:48] would loosen it but usually when I
[1:20:49] loosen it it's catty woned over here and
[1:20:52] ma wouldn't have liked that at
[1:20:54] all I don't want to be caty Wampus today
[1:20:58] and sometimes I get text but I'm already
[1:21:00] preaching so I'm not reading my text
[1:21:02] while I'm preaching and then I see
[1:21:04] sister Anna's real or brother Hawk's
[1:21:06] moments and and I said oh my goodness
[1:21:09] why didn't somebody tell
[1:21:11] me beloved let us love one
[1:21:16] another huh for love is of God I would
[1:21:23] like to say love is God and God is love
[1:21:28] and everyone that loveth is born of God
[1:21:33] and knoweth God you need to know that
[1:21:36] there there in this world it's very hard
[1:21:41] to manufacture love for those who are
[1:21:45] not of your
[1:21:46] family those who are not of your tribe
[1:21:50] it's it's by only by the Lord by his
[1:21:54] help by connection with him that you can
[1:21:57] develop a love for strangers that does
[1:22:00] not come natural in today's society and
[1:22:03] even the scripture is clear he tells us
[1:22:07] everyone that loveth is born of God it's
[1:22:10] a spiritual thing to be able to love
[1:22:13] your enemy it's a spiritual thing to be
[1:22:16] able to love a
[1:22:18] stranger amen but it's possible when we
[1:22:22] have the birth everyone that loveth is
[1:22:25] born of God
[1:22:26] and knoweth God knoweth God he that
[1:22:31] loveth not knoweth not God for what God
[1:22:36] is love God is love so the few of you
[1:22:38] that wrinkled your face when I said that
[1:22:40] a moment
[1:22:43] ago I was just getting ahead of myself
[1:22:47] he is love and this was manifested the
[1:22:51] love of God toward us
[1:22:53] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:22:56] son into the world that we might
[1:23:00] live through him that's good herein is
[1:23:03] love not that we loved God that's
[1:23:10] impossible but that he loved
[1:23:14] us we couldn't have loved him as a
[1:23:17] thought in his
[1:23:19] mind now we can love him because we're
[1:23:23] expressed and born of the spirit we're
[1:23:25] born of the natural birth and now the
[1:23:28] spiritual birth and we can love him and
[1:23:31] that's why we ought to be careful when
[1:23:33] we're talking about the unregenerated
[1:23:35] and we say things like but he loved the
[1:23:39] lord it's impossible to love God unless
[1:23:42] you've had a
[1:23:45] birth now what does that mean it means
[1:23:47] we don't really understand perhaps the
[1:23:49] definition of what it means to love the
[1:23:52] Lord L how many of you know he said if
[1:23:54] you say you love
[1:23:57] me and don't keep Covenant with me
[1:24:01] you're a
[1:24:02] liar and the truth is not in you so it's
[1:24:06] it's not that we could love him in that
[1:24:08] condition but that he loved us and sent
[1:24:11] his son to be the propitiation for our
[1:24:15] sins that's more than a covering for our
[1:24:18] sins that's rectifying the wrong beloved
[1:24:22] if God God so loved us here is where we
[1:24:25] struggle even after the birth beloved if
[1:24:30] God so loved us I'll let you
[1:24:36] read we
[1:24:38] ought we
[1:24:41] should we
[1:24:44] should also to love one
[1:24:48] another and that means more than those
[1:24:51] who love us
[1:24:55] it's easy to love those who love us
[1:24:58] that's not hard no man has seen God at
[1:25:01] any time if we love one another God
[1:25:05] dwelleth in
[1:25:07] us and his love is what perfed
[1:25:12] matured
[1:25:14] perfected
[1:25:16] completed in us we as we learn to love
[1:25:21] one another by the
[1:25:23] spirit we perfect the love that God has
[1:25:28] toward us let me say it again the love
[1:25:32] that God has toward us is perfected it
[1:25:36] is matured as we learn to show that love
[1:25:40] one to another and then that becomes
[1:25:43] perfect love it becomes matured love it
[1:25:47] becomes I love you whether you love me
[1:25:50] or not yes
[1:25:53] and remember that love is not what we
[1:25:59] say it's what we
[1:26:02] do no man all right let's go on hereby
[1:26:06] know we that we dwell in him and he in
[1:26:10] us because he hath given us of his
[1:26:14] Spirit who has the earnest of the holy
[1:26:17] spirit in your life who has the
[1:26:20] baptism you receive an Earnest of the
[1:26:23] Holy Spirit through the through the
[1:26:25] beginning of the birth process
[1:26:28] justification but then we receive more
[1:26:31] than the earnest when we receive the new
[1:26:33] birth which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:36] Ghost yes I said when we receive the new
[1:26:39] birth which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:42] Ghost then we have more than the earnest
[1:26:45] are you telling us that we're not born
[1:26:47] again unless we have the baptism of the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost yes I'm telling you that our
[1:26:52] Born Again experience is not
[1:26:56] completed it's a process until then when
[1:27:00] we receive the baptism of the holy
[1:27:02] spirit that is the completion of the new
[1:27:09] birth now the new birth is required for
[1:27:12] you and I to make the Rapture am we have
[1:27:17] to have the new
[1:27:18] birth there are those who their
[1:27:21] requirement is to call on his name but
[1:27:24] your requirement as a part of this bride
[1:27:27] body you're going to have to have a born
[1:27:29] again experience because we're not made
[1:27:32] to be survivors sir we're made to be
[1:27:35] Overcomers somebody say amen and so if
[1:27:39] you don't know if you don't know that
[1:27:41] you know that you know that you know
[1:27:44] that you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:45] Ghost you need him you need him and we
[1:27:49] have seen and do testify that the father
[1:27:52] sent the son to be the savior of the
[1:27:55] world a few more
[1:27:57] verses whosoever shall confess that
[1:28:00] Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in
[1:28:04] him and he in God and we have known and
[1:28:10] believe the love that God hath to us God
[1:28:13] is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:28:16] dwelleth in God and God in him now
[1:28:20] that's that's not the first first time
[1:28:22] several times he's talking about we're
[1:28:25] in him and he is in us and love is the
[1:28:30] common
[1:28:31] denominator if you want to have that
[1:28:33] Oneness experience love is the common
[1:28:37] denominator to be one with God is to
[1:28:42] demonstrate mature love you understand
[1:28:45] that let's go on I know you're standing
[1:28:49] herein is our love made perfect
[1:28:52] completed mature that we may have
[1:28:56] boldness in the day of judgment because
[1:28:59] as he is so are we in this
[1:29:04] world there the next verse excuse me
[1:29:07] there is no
[1:29:09] fear there is no
[1:29:11] fear there is no fear in love but
[1:29:14] perfect love so if you are dwelling in
[1:29:17] fear and we all have and we all do from
[1:29:20] time to time but remember that when you
[1:29:23] are dwelling in fear you're are not
[1:29:25] dwelling in love and therefore you are
[1:29:28] separating
[1:29:30] yourself from
[1:29:32] God if you're in God and God in you you
[1:29:36] can't do that in the dimension of fear
[1:29:39] you have to do that in the dimension of
[1:29:41] love so every time you get out of love
[1:29:44] into fear you're pulling back it's not
[1:29:48] that you're no longer a part of him it
[1:29:50] is that you're no longer drawing close
[1:29:52] to him but to fear means you're pulling
[1:29:55] away from him oh my that makes me want
[1:29:58] to deal with every fear how many of
[1:30:00] you'd like to deal with every
[1:30:03] fear because you don't want to be here's
[1:30:05] your picture you're pulling away if you
[1:30:08] are dwelling in fear if your thoughts
[1:30:11] are dwelling in fearful thoughts but
[1:30:14] perfect love does
[1:30:16] what it casteth out fear because
[1:30:20] fear I want to ask ask you does Fear
[1:30:22] have
[1:30:23] torment let me see your hand does Fear
[1:30:26] have
[1:30:27] torment he that
[1:30:32] fearth oh I saw those wrinkled faces
[1:30:34] again my my my my my a few minutes ago
[1:30:37] when I said basically this same
[1:30:41] thing you're pulling away he that fearth
[1:30:46] is not made
[1:30:47] perfect in love there's no maturity in
[1:30:51] your love when your love becomes mature
[1:30:54] you pull away from
[1:30:56] fear not not pull away from God a few
[1:31:00] more verses we love him and this is so
[1:31:04] beautiful this is so
[1:31:06] true we love him we like to testify I
[1:31:10] love the Lord do you know why you do
[1:31:13] only because
[1:31:16] exclusively because he first loved you
[1:31:20] that's why I love him today
[1:31:22] that's why I can love him today that's
[1:31:24] how it's possible for me to love him
[1:31:26] today he loved me first if a man say I
[1:31:30] love God if a man say I love God and
[1:31:34] hateth his
[1:31:37] brother he's a liar for he that H how
[1:31:41] can you be walking in perfect love how
[1:31:43] can you be walking in mature love how
[1:31:45] can you be walking in complete
[1:31:48] love if you're a
[1:31:50] liar for for he that loveth not his
[1:31:53] brother whom he hath seen how can he
[1:31:56] love God whom he hath not
[1:31:59] seen I better read that one again if a
[1:32:02] man say I love God and hateth his
[1:32:04] brother he is a
[1:32:07] liar he's actually he's on his way you
[1:32:10] know the Bible tells us what happens to
[1:32:13] Liars so you're actually Walking In The
[1:32:16] Way of the
[1:32:17] Wicked be better not to say you love
[1:32:19] your brother and not and not come on
[1:32:22] come on it says if a man
[1:32:25] say I love God and hateth his brother
[1:32:28] he's a liar for he that loveth not his
[1:32:30] brother whom he hath seen how can he
[1:32:33] love God whom he hath not seen are you
[1:32:36] still with me and then finally verse 21
[1:32:39] and this commandment have we from him
[1:32:43] commandment
[1:32:45] now that he who loveth
[1:32:50] God
[1:32:52] loveth his brother also God help us
[1:32:56] would you would you pray with me Lord
[1:32:57] help us would you pray Lord help
[1:33:01] me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:04] you may have your
[1:33:07] seat whatever you
[1:33:10] do keep your balance in the
[1:33:14] scripture whatever you do stay in the
[1:33:18] middle of the road whatever you do
[1:33:22] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[1:33:25] worship until the glory comes and then
[1:33:28] stand in the glory whatever you do
[1:33:32] learn to
[1:33:34] love the fourth thing that I heard
[1:33:37] whatever you
[1:33:38] do learn to
[1:33:41] love the voice that spoke that to me was
[1:33:45] a friend of mine who has gone on to be
[1:33:48] with the Lord some years ago I I think
[1:33:51] on Valentine's Day I think it was right
[1:33:54] around February the
[1:33:56] 14th that uh that God took Bob Jones
[1:34:01] home for you that are watching this and
[1:34:04] you don't know who that was it is not
[1:34:07] Bob Jones of Bob Jones
[1:34:10] University but Bob was one of
[1:34:14] the what was called in the charismatic
[1:34:17] and Pentecostal World Kansas City
[1:34:20] Prophets and regardless of what you
[1:34:23] think about that movement there were
[1:34:25] many great things that were taking place
[1:34:29] in those
[1:34:31] days and we're thankful for
[1:34:33] that Bob was not a perfect
[1:34:37] man he was a fallen man he was a hurting
[1:34:42] man he had made
[1:34:45] mistakes and he had
[1:34:47] sinned and he had lost a lot of of his
[1:34:52] ministry and one day God said I'm going
[1:34:56] to raise him up and I'm going to use him
[1:35:00] again and I'm going to use him in a
[1:35:03] different way because he's a different
[1:35:06] man anybody with me I got confidence in
[1:35:11] that I can believe in that I can believe
[1:35:15] that if we let our falling and our
[1:35:17] failures change
[1:35:19] us that perhaps all is not lost some
[1:35:24] people never really
[1:35:26] learn from their
[1:35:30] lesson some people remain the same
[1:35:32] prideful bragging person that they
[1:35:36] always
[1:35:38] were some people remain
[1:35:41] pompous and uh
[1:35:44] entitled and they don't seem to
[1:35:47] understand that God allows these
[1:35:50] fallings
[1:35:51] I want you to understand the the Bible
[1:35:53] tells us that God has the power to keep
[1:35:58] us from
[1:36:05] falling I know a
[1:36:07] minister he's an aged man
[1:36:10] now in this
[1:36:12] message who was a friend of mine and if
[1:36:16] I was near him he would still be a
[1:36:19] friend of mine today
[1:36:22] he made some awful
[1:36:25] mistakes
[1:36:27] he
[1:36:29] sinned against
[1:36:31] God he would have perhaps gone
[1:36:36] further into that
[1:36:39] sin he was in a taxi cab boy I've got
[1:36:42] your attention now just talk about
[1:36:44] somebody's sin and everybody
[1:36:47] listens come
[1:36:48] on he was in a taxi cab
[1:36:52] with a young
[1:36:54] prostitute that he had chosen off the
[1:36:57] street in a foreign field where he was
[1:37:01] serving a a short extended a short
[1:37:05] missionary trip I don't want to say make
[1:37:08] you think that he was living in that
[1:37:11] foreign field he was not he was there
[1:37:13] for a few weeks I don't know how long
[1:37:17] and had been many
[1:37:18] times I don't know what had happened
[1:37:21] before it's really none of my
[1:37:24] business but I know that this
[1:37:28] time in a moment of weakness that I
[1:37:31] cannot
[1:37:33] defend
[1:37:35] he thought perhaps to himself I'm out of
[1:37:39] the
[1:37:40] country no one will
[1:37:43] know how many of you know you can live
[1:37:46] in a big city and and still a small town
[1:37:49] all at the same time when I was staying
[1:37:52] so many weeks in
[1:37:54] Jerusalem the Jerusalem Jewels used to
[1:37:57] tell
[1:37:58] me Jerusalem is the big city that is
[1:38:01] really a small village and you'd be
[1:38:04] surprised how many connections you make
[1:38:06] with people did you know that business
[1:38:09] is still conducted on an honor System in
[1:38:13] in Jerusalem right
[1:38:15] now did you know that if you go into a
[1:38:19] uh furniture store and you wanted to buy
[1:38:21] a piece of furniture there are still
[1:38:24] stores in Jerusalem and
[1:38:27] tpot that will ask you for payments and
[1:38:31] they will take your
[1:38:33] signed postdated
[1:38:37] checks you can give them 12 checks or
[1:38:41] however many payments made out in the
[1:38:43] right amount signed and dated for the
[1:38:46] month that it's due and you can walk out
[1:38:48] of there with the furniture when I
[1:38:51] learned that and I've just recently
[1:38:53] heard it again when I learned that I
[1:38:55] thought how can that be possible in
[1:38:57] America everything is done on a credit
[1:39:00] card and people got to have that credit
[1:39:02] card is a guarantee that you're going to
[1:39:04] pay but in Jerusalem I walked in as a
[1:39:07] stranger bought a house full of
[1:39:09] furniture with
[1:39:11] checks that were no
[1:39:16] good somebody said what do you mean I
[1:39:18] mean I don't I mean that I mean there
[1:39:21] was some money in there but not enough
[1:39:23] to cover every one of those checks so I
[1:39:25] said to the man there's not that much
[1:39:27] money in the bank he said all you got to
[1:39:29] do is make sure that on the such and
[1:39:31] such of the month there's that amount of
[1:39:33] money in
[1:39:34] there he said that way there's no
[1:39:37] interest you you don't charge me
[1:39:39] Interest no you don't Char so this city
[1:39:43] where the missionary was was was more
[1:39:45] like a small town I would think than he
[1:39:49] realized and and as this young woman
[1:39:52] gets in the back of the taxi with him
[1:39:55] she immediately recognizes him by
[1:39:59] name and she waits until he has
[1:40:02] propositioned her and told her exactly
[1:40:05] what kind of business he's interested in
[1:40:08] conducting with
[1:40:09] her boy we'll get the streams on this
[1:40:17] one at some point in the
[1:40:19] evening before there was any physical
[1:40:22] exchange between them she let him
[1:40:27] know my
[1:40:29] brother is the song
[1:40:32] leader at the church where you're
[1:40:39] ministering needless to say his evening
[1:40:42] on the
[1:40:43] town immediately became a missionary
[1:40:49] work as he be began to try to explain to
[1:40:53] her that now he's concerned about her
[1:40:59] soul God was
[1:41:03] gracious that man didn't lose his
[1:41:06] marriage he lost a huge portion of his
[1:41:12] ministry confidence was really broken in
[1:41:16] a lot of people's
[1:41:18] minds but in all of that loss
[1:41:21] God used that man in the latter years of
[1:41:26] his life because he was a different
[1:41:30] man now wouldn't it be
[1:41:32] wonderful if he could have become a
[1:41:35] different Man without having to go
[1:41:37] through that kind of a
[1:41:40] loss that's similar to the kind of
[1:41:43] falling and loss that Bob Jones went
[1:41:46] through in the earlier part of his
[1:41:48] ministry by the time I met met him his
[1:41:51] wife had passed away he was already an
[1:41:55] older man very swiftly turning 80
[1:42:00] getting ready to be 80 quite soon within
[1:42:02] a couple of years of meeting him and I
[1:42:06] met him by the invitation of a friend
[1:42:09] who said why don't you come down Stephen
[1:42:11] and Stacy and spend some time with us
[1:42:16] Bob has just gotten married and he'll be
[1:42:20] on his honeymoon at nearly
[1:42:22] 80 and what he likes to do now is get up
[1:42:27] and go to
[1:42:28] breakfast and talk until
[1:42:33] lunch have a little
[1:42:36] lunch and go home and take a nap in the
[1:42:39] afternoon when he gets up he's always
[1:42:42] had a
[1:42:43] dream so we'll meet for
[1:42:46] dinner I don't normally eat three meals
[1:42:49] a day
[1:42:51] we'll meet for especially two or three
[1:42:53] in the same
[1:42:54] restaurant at the same
[1:42:58] table we'll go to dinner then and we'll
[1:43:01] talk about the things of the Lord and I
[1:43:04] said well that sounds like an
[1:43:06] opportunity I I would very much like to
[1:43:08] meet him and so that's what we'll do and
[1:43:11] Stacy and I went down and we did that
[1:43:13] for 5 days in a
[1:43:16] row just like we said and over the next
[1:43:21] couple of years we were with him
[1:43:24] different places where he was speaking
[1:43:26] and where we were speaking and we had
[1:43:29] some wonderful fellowship with he and
[1:43:31] his wife
[1:43:33] Bonnie and we learned that the gift that
[1:43:37] he had was quite
[1:43:43] astounding I don't know that it was a
[1:43:45] perfect gift but it was nonetheless a
[1:43:49] gift of operating in a man who had been
[1:43:53] less than
[1:43:54] perfect the gifts and callings of God
[1:43:58] are without repentance I went through
[1:44:01] that not as a
[1:44:03] disclaimer but I went through that
[1:44:05] because I know there will be those who
[1:44:07] Google
[1:44:09] search and I wanted to beat you to the
[1:44:12] punch and tell you his Doctrine was not
[1:44:17] perfect his past had not been perfect
[1:44:20] but nonetheless he made a difference in
[1:44:23] our
[1:44:24] lives he spoke over all of our children
[1:44:27] he spoke over my
[1:44:29] wife he prayed for her when we were down
[1:44:33] one time and she was pregnant with with
[1:44:36] Mariah and she had been leaking amniotic
[1:44:40] fluid and the the Midwife and the doctor
[1:44:43] was becoming very concerned that there
[1:44:46] would not be enough amniotic fluid to
[1:44:48] last the duration of the pregnancy and
[1:44:52] that she might actually lose all of her
[1:44:54] water that there might all all actually
[1:44:56] be a a
[1:44:58] bursting of the amniotic sack that would
[1:45:00] cause all the fluid to drain out which
[1:45:02] would make a a real emergency
[1:45:06] situation and we were going to mention
[1:45:08] to him what it was but we were nervous
[1:45:11] to do that because he was busy with
[1:45:14] other things talking about other things
[1:45:17] and as we were standing outside on in
[1:45:20] the front of Hazel's restaurant in
[1:45:23] Orange Beach Alabama Bob turned and he
[1:45:26] said I want to pray for you and he began
[1:45:29] to pray for her and he prayed a strange
[1:45:31] prayer he prayed concerning the amniotic
[1:45:36] fluid that he knew nothing about he
[1:45:40] prayed that there would be enough and
[1:45:41] that God would not let it leak and that
[1:45:44] it would that she would go full term and
[1:45:47] that everything would be all right and
[1:45:51] and uh one of them either he or his wife
[1:45:54] said something about strengthening the
[1:45:57] sack
[1:45:58] well God heard that prayer there was no
[1:46:02] more leakage there was no more loss of
[1:46:05] amniotic fluid in fact it filled
[1:46:08] up it filled up with fluid and the sack
[1:46:12] became so
[1:46:16] tough that it never broke on its own and
[1:46:20] I know this is too in too much
[1:46:24] information especially
[1:46:27] for names are coming to my
[1:46:31] mind not all firsttime mothers but some
[1:46:34] firsttime mothers this is too much for
[1:46:37] you but I was in the room when they were
[1:46:39] going after the sack to try to pierce
[1:46:43] it and you know they use something like
[1:46:46] a crochet hook is that too much
[1:46:48] information that's kind of what it looks
[1:46:50] like like well I want you to know it
[1:46:53] took everything they
[1:46:59] had wasn't painful to my wife let me
[1:47:02] throw that in was it darling shake your
[1:47:04] head no so everybody can see
[1:47:06] you it wasn't painful but it wasn't a
[1:47:09] whole lot of fun to
[1:47:11] watch as they would go in and they would
[1:47:14] think they caught it with the with the
[1:47:16] hook and then it it was so tough it
[1:47:19] wouldn't they couldn't hang it so
[1:47:21] finally under great force they were able
[1:47:25] to burst that bag and my wife and I it's
[1:47:27] not funny at the time but shortly
[1:47:31] thereafter we
[1:47:33] laughed because we realized that God
[1:47:36] heard that
[1:47:38] prayer and so strengthened that uh
[1:47:42] amniotic
[1:47:43] sack that they could man could hardly
[1:47:46] break into it because God was protecting
[1:47:54] Mariah Bob was the kind of person I am
[1:47:57] so
[1:48:06] sorry I didn't fix
[1:48:10] it Bob was the kind of
[1:48:13] person that would call
[1:48:16] me and tell me what I had
[1:48:19] dreamed
[1:48:21] more than
[1:48:23] once I would have a spiritual
[1:48:26] experience write it down tell another
[1:48:30] person and before before the day was
[1:48:35] done he would call me I would always
[1:48:38] tell my wife or PK so that somebody
[1:48:42] would know and before the day was over
[1:48:44] he would call me and tell me what I had
[1:48:47] seen and what it
[1:48:48] meant so I I have to have some
[1:48:53] confidence in that I was a little
[1:48:56] surprised that I heard his voice so
[1:48:58] profoundly in this experience because he
[1:49:01] has been gone so long he never
[1:49:04] ministered here we never invited him to
[1:49:06] minister here because there were
[1:49:08] certainly some differences in our
[1:49:10] Doctrine he had a lot of respect for
[1:49:13] brother brandham and I never heard him
[1:49:15] say we spoke of brother brandom's
[1:49:17] Ministry many many times I never heard
[1:49:20] him say anything but good real positive
[1:49:24] words uh of affirmation concerning
[1:49:26] brother branham's Ministry he called one
[1:49:29] time and he said uh Bonnie called and
[1:49:33] she said Steve Bob wants to come and see
[1:49:36] you
[1:49:37] guys you could have knocked me over with
[1:49:40] a feather I wasn't expecting his visit
[1:49:43] I'd never invited him to visit I had no
[1:49:46] idea he would ever think about coming
[1:49:49] here for a visit visit but they got in
[1:49:51] their automobile from South Carolina and
[1:49:54] they drove all the way down here and I
[1:49:55] said sure we'll get a hotel for you all
[1:49:59] to rest and my wife and mom will cook
[1:50:02] and we'll have wonderful Fellowship he
[1:50:04] said she said that's all Bob wants he
[1:50:07] wants to come and see you he wants to be
[1:50:09] in your home he wants to go and anoint
[1:50:11] pray over your church
[1:50:14] property and uh he wants to to eat
[1:50:17] country
[1:50:19] food
[1:50:22] and so he came my wife and my mother
[1:50:25] made a big turkey meal for him and my
[1:50:28] you should have seen
[1:50:30] him that that uh hillbilly that he was
[1:50:35] he said this is some of the best turkey
[1:50:38] I've ever had in my life as he goes in
[1:50:41] for
[1:50:42] more a few profound things happened
[1:50:46] while he was here he prayed over several
[1:50:49] people he came that day we brought him
[1:50:51] to the church and he went around in the
[1:50:53] mud around the back of this church and
[1:50:56] anointed the four corners of the church
[1:50:59] and he spoke some things prophetically
[1:51:01] that we have seen God bringing to pass
[1:51:04] brought to pass bringing to pass and
[1:51:06] we're expecting that the rest of it will
[1:51:08] also come to pass but one evening he was
[1:51:12] with us for two nights and one evening I
[1:51:15] knew of a of a great
[1:51:18] rift that had come between him and
[1:51:21] another elderly friend of
[1:51:24] ours and the Lord began to speak to my
[1:51:27] heart and
[1:51:28] say you need to speak to Bob about that
[1:51:32] being made
[1:51:35] right and as the story he was telling a
[1:51:38] story and he spoke with a little bit of
[1:51:43] bitterness concerning this
[1:51:45] great broken
[1:51:48] relationship with a a little
[1:51:51] criticism and my head was just
[1:51:54] spinning because God was talking to my
[1:51:57] heart you need to tell him that's got to
[1:52:00] be
[1:52:02] fixed I was a little intimidated to do
[1:52:05] that I really needed the Lord's
[1:52:08] help he was sitting in our rocking chair
[1:52:11] and about that time he needed to go to
[1:52:14] the washroom he gets up and leaves the
[1:52:16] room and Bonnie his wife looks right at
[1:52:18] me and pointed her finger and she said
[1:52:20] now
[1:52:21] Steve what the Lord is talking to you
[1:52:24] about you're the only one that can fix
[1:52:26] you're the only one that can do
[1:52:28] that I can't speak to him about
[1:52:31] that I've already
[1:52:33] tried but he has confidence in you right
[1:52:37] now God is using
[1:52:39] you and she said I'm going to pray that
[1:52:42] you will have the
[1:52:44] courage to speak up to him because I
[1:52:47] know the Lord is talking to you and and
[1:52:50] I'm going to pray that you will have the
[1:52:51] strength and the courage to do it I said
[1:52:53] thank you so much I was a little bit
[1:52:56] shocked because I knew she
[1:52:59] knew and when he came back in I didn't
[1:53:02] want too much time to pass I began to
[1:53:05] speak to him remembering that he was my
[1:53:08] Elder but the authority of the Lord came
[1:53:11] into that
[1:53:13] room and I began to tell him we're not
[1:53:15] promised
[1:53:17] tomorrow and these are things that have
[1:53:19] to be settled and it doesn't matter who
[1:53:22] was the most wrong you both were
[1:53:25] wrong by your own confession you both
[1:53:28] were wrong and now it's got to be made
[1:53:30] right you've got to make the effort it
[1:53:33] doesn't matter whether he's willing or
[1:53:34] not you've got to reach out and make the
[1:53:37] effort well I want you to know he heard
[1:53:39] me he huffed and
[1:53:43] puffed he was an older man he huffed and
[1:53:47] puffed but he heard me and after they
[1:53:50] left here they got home and he said to
[1:53:53] her I want you to call that other
[1:53:55] individual I want you to set something
[1:53:57] up I'm going to take Steve's words to
[1:53:59] heart and I'm going to make sure that I
[1:54:01] have nothing in my heart against that
[1:54:04] brother we're going to get it worked out
[1:54:06] and the meeting came I was unable to go
[1:54:09] invited but unable to go and they made
[1:54:13] peace it wasn't too
[1:54:16] long not too much time had gone by I
[1:54:20] don't know how much that I was walking
[1:54:23] through there at the end of a service
[1:54:25] one night and the phone call came that
[1:54:28] he had coded and it wasn't too long
[1:54:31] after that that he was called
[1:54:34] home he had this
[1:54:37] experience that he called did you learn
[1:54:40] to love and it was his voice I want to
[1:54:43] make sure you understand what I'm saying
[1:54:46] it was his voice and he had a very
[1:54:49] distinct voice and a very distinct
[1:54:51] accent and I've heard other people that
[1:54:54] could mimic it and sound just like him
[1:54:56] but I
[1:54:58] can't but he spoke to me in that
[1:55:01] experience I didn't see him I just heard
[1:55:03] his voice and he said whatever you do
[1:55:07] learn to
[1:55:10] love my question was how do we do that
[1:55:15] when the voice said be very
[1:55:18] surefooted so I don't know how it fits
[1:55:21] in
[1:55:22] church but love is a
[1:55:25] key we know that by the word of God we
[1:55:29] know that by the message of the hour and
[1:55:31] now we know by this spiritual experience
[1:55:34] that one of the keys for you and I to
[1:55:38] remain
[1:55:39] surefooted as we climb this year and in
[1:55:42] in all future climbing one of the keys
[1:55:46] is to make sure that we have learned to
[1:55:50] love one another is anybody with
[1:55:53] me now it's just 1:00 on 9 till and I
[1:55:59] know it took some time but there are so
[1:56:01] many here that didn't know Bob never had
[1:56:03] an opportunity to meet him and if I
[1:56:06] would have thought about it I would have
[1:56:08] had a picture of him with us or or a
[1:56:10] picture of him in in my office and would
[1:56:12] have let you see him he loved
[1:56:15] Eagles and most of the time no matter
[1:56:18] where we were speaking how fancy it was
[1:56:20] he had a big eagle sweatshirt on and a
[1:56:24] cap with an eagle on it and he was just
[1:56:27] as as country as country can
[1:56:30] be and he would literally have a chicken
[1:56:33] wing in one hand and pointing Prophecy
[1:56:37] with the
[1:56:39] other he was just an
[1:56:42] unusual
[1:56:45] character he especially loved to go
[1:56:47] where they throwed rolls
[1:56:52] and could he ever eat Thro rolls he said
[1:56:56] I don't know how to it is about it but
[1:56:58] they taste better when you catch
[1:57:01] them I just want you to know a little
[1:57:03] bit about his
[1:57:05] personality and uh I want to share with
[1:57:08] you the experience that he had and if I
[1:57:12] have time I'll preach some of this if
[1:57:14] not we'll pick it up Tuesday night and
[1:57:16] go on but I want you to hear
[1:57:20] a portion of the experience it's too
[1:57:22] much to do
[1:57:24] today it's long so I'm going to leave
[1:57:28] out a lot but let me explain to you that
[1:57:31] he was told in an
[1:57:34] experience that he had to preach against
[1:57:36] three
[1:57:38] evils that were about to show up in the
[1:57:42] world like never
[1:57:44] before one was the sin of
[1:57:48] homosexuality
[1:57:52] and he was to preach that
[1:57:54] aids was a
[1:57:57] result of that
[1:57:59] sin and that God was allowing that
[1:58:02] plague to come to this nation and around
[1:58:06] the
[1:58:08] world to show how he felt about that
[1:58:12] unnatural
[1:58:14] Behavior this the the the other thing
[1:58:18] was he was to cry out against
[1:58:24] abortion and to reveal the heart of God
[1:58:28] concerning
[1:58:30] abortion and the third thing was
[1:58:35] methamphetamines the Lord spoke to him
[1:58:37] and said that there is about to be a
[1:58:41] drug that will be cooked in
[1:58:46] homes using
[1:58:48] ingredients that are readily available
[1:58:51] at any
[1:58:56] drugstore did you know that's why you
[1:58:58] have to sign for psea
[1:59:00] fed because there there's a picture of
[1:59:03] Bob oh he didn't have his Eagle he
[1:59:06] didn't have his Eagle sweatshirt on that
[1:59:10] day there he is anointing the four
[1:59:13] corners of the church is that
[1:59:17] all I'm glad you could see
[1:59:23] him that's the reason why you have to
[1:59:25] sign because the ingredient there's an
[1:59:27] ingredient in there that used to to cook
[1:59:31] meth crystal
[1:59:33] meth when God let Bob have this
[1:59:36] experience it was
[1:59:38] early perhaps
[1:59:40] 70s I'm not sure I'm sorry exactly when
[1:59:44] it
[1:59:45] was maybe maybe late 60s
[1:59:50] but it was certainly before these things
[1:59:54] had the prominence that they have today
[1:59:57] I'll try to get the date and let you
[1:59:58] know later I apologize I wanted to to
[2:00:02] keep the experience as brief as possible
[2:00:06] and make sure I had the important things
[2:00:09] and I forgot to get exactly when he had
[2:00:11] this experience he was not
[2:00:14] willing he said it'll ruin
[2:00:17] me if I start telling the charismatic
[2:00:21] world that
[2:00:22] aids is a is a is a disease a plague of
[2:00:27] God's judgment on the on the Earth
[2:00:29] because of a sin that's going on he said
[2:00:32] they won't be able to swallow that he
[2:00:34] said I knew if I could get to the Holy
[2:00:36] Rollers they would believe me but he
[2:00:39] said they didn't have any confidence in
[2:00:41] me he said I knew that the message
[2:00:48] wow
[2:00:49] there he is posing with
[2:00:53] Mariah and the
[2:00:55] rest how precious no there is an eagle
[2:01:03] there thank you so much for doing
[2:01:07] that he said God I can't do
[2:01:10] that it'll cost me everything he went to
[2:01:13] a church that he was very familiar with
[2:01:16] and he began to share what was on his
[2:01:18] heart and they attacked him
[2:01:21] publicly and he was unable to to share
[2:01:24] the remainder of what he had it grieved
[2:01:26] him so
[2:01:28] bad over a a short period of time he
[2:01:32] began to have a pain in his stomach that
[2:01:35] was so bad that ended up being an
[2:01:38] aneurysm in the stomach and he was
[2:01:40] bleeding to death without even realizing
[2:01:43] what was
[2:01:45] happening he ended up in the emergency
[2:01:48] room and in the hospital and Gang Green
[2:01:51] was beginning to set in his
[2:01:54] bowels and the doctor said I've never
[2:01:56] seen a case like this I've never seen
[2:01:58] anything quite like this and uh over the
[2:02:02] course of uh of a few hours and maybe a
[2:02:05] couple of days
[2:02:08] he coated again on the
[2:02:11] table and had this
[2:02:15] experience and I'm not going to tell you
[2:02:17] the first part of the experience he was
[2:02:19] in a cave and there were some other
[2:02:21] things that took place but as he comes
[2:02:23] out of that cave he saw two
[2:02:28] lines very distinct
[2:02:31] lines and he called them one line he
[2:02:34] said that was the line of The
[2:02:37] Forsaken and the other line was the line
[2:02:40] of the
[2:02:41] righteous and now I'm going to read this
[2:02:43] to you in his own words this is like an
[2:02:46] interview so it may sound like like like
[2:02:49] that to you as I read it yes he said I'm
[2:02:52] out of the
[2:02:53] tunnel and I see this line and there
[2:02:55] were people in line that I there were
[2:02:58] people in the line that I was
[2:03:00] in something said look to your left and
[2:03:04] I looked to my left and for each two
[2:03:07] people that were in my line there were
[2:03:11] 98 people in the other line for every
[2:03:16] two in the line of the right there were
[2:03:20] 98 in the line of The Forsaken he never
[2:03:23] forgot that he said only the people in
[2:03:27] the other line could not
[2:03:30] walk he said they were like on a
[2:03:33] roller that you would see in the
[2:03:36] supermarket they had no control over
[2:03:39] their ability to walk or move and they
[2:03:41] were just rolled on a conveyor belt and
[2:03:45] then he explained why they couldn't walk
[2:03:47] he said they were r wrapped up in the
[2:03:50] gods that they served on the
[2:03:54] earth so the faceless man began to show
[2:03:57] me he said this was his
[2:04:00] God and I looked at as I looked at them
[2:04:03] and I saw them as they begin to look and
[2:04:06] see that sunlight in those eyes each
[2:04:08] one's eyes got big and their mouth
[2:04:11] dropped as they saw that man standing
[2:04:14] there in great light you could see them
[2:04:17] saying he is real
[2:04:19] we mocked and we laughed but he is
[2:04:23] real I won't take the time to describe
[2:04:26] but he described several individuals and
[2:04:29] one was wrapped in a in what looked like
[2:04:32] giant currency dollar
[2:04:35] bills and he was so wrapped in it he
[2:04:37] couldn't talk and he couldn't move his
[2:04:39] arms and he couldn't move his legs
[2:04:41] because on Earth he had served money as
[2:04:44] his
[2:04:45] God and he described several other sins
[2:04:49] a sin of lust and several others that he
[2:04:52] saw and it just broke his heart to see
[2:04:55] that they weren't even able to speak for
[2:04:57] themselves now this is a symbolic
[2:04:59] experience you understand how dreams and
[2:05:02] Visions work and he said they couldn't
[2:05:05] move on their own and they couldn't even
[2:05:07] defend themselves in the presence of
[2:05:09] that light and part of the reason was
[2:05:12] they were wrapped up in the god in the
[2:05:14] sin that they had served down here on
[2:05:16] the earth now that resonated with me as
[2:05:19] I told you some weeks ago because my
[2:05:21] grandmother had had a vision of hell and
[2:05:23] in that vision of hell she said the same
[2:05:25] thing she said I saw him standing there
[2:05:28] on the brink of hell with with bottles
[2:05:31] empty
[2:05:32] bottles around their feet and she set an
[2:05:36] empty bottle in both hands as they
[2:05:40] turned those bottles up to their lips
[2:05:43] and tried to get one last drop and there
[2:05:46] was none and they throwed those B botles
[2:05:49] down and grabbed a couple of more and
[2:05:51] they just continued to try to get one
[2:05:54] Vapor of alcohol out of that bottle and
[2:05:58] were unable to do so she said I saw
[2:06:02] people that were that were holding on to
[2:06:04] cigarette packs and they were smoking
[2:06:06] one right after another had one in one
[2:06:08] hand and one in another hand and they
[2:06:11] were they were alterating hands to draw
[2:06:15] and they were sick she said they were
[2:06:17] green and I saw them turn and begin to
[2:06:20] vomit and as soon as they were done
[2:06:22] vomiting they were putting that back in
[2:06:24] their
[2:06:27] mouth it had a profound effect on
[2:06:31] her we're not saying that's how it
[2:06:35] is I hope you folks are mature enough to
[2:06:39] understand we're talking about symbols
[2:06:42] sir and the symbol the the understanding
[2:06:45] from the symbol I think is most accurate
[2:06:49] I think there's something in that place
[2:06:51] where you're driven you're com you have
[2:06:54] a compulsion to continue to do the thing
[2:06:57] with no pleasure involved no pleasure
[2:07:00] whatsoever there was no pleasure in
[2:07:01] those Empty Bottle there was no pleasure
[2:07:04] no coming for the nerves it was it was
[2:07:07] the man was
[2:07:11] driven I want to move past that now to
[2:07:14] the line of the righteous but before I
[2:07:17] do let me tell you that he's saw that he
[2:07:19] saw that conveyor belt continuing to
[2:07:22] roll and as they left the presence of
[2:07:24] the one who was standing there in the
[2:07:26] great light he said that conveyor belt
[2:07:28] went over a cliff like that and I heard
[2:07:31] them as they fell off screaming into
[2:07:33] that place of
[2:07:35] Torment now remember he's on the on the
[2:07:38] hospital bed
[2:07:40] dying when this is happening to
[2:07:43] him he said then I saw in the line in
[2:07:46] front of me as the the line got closer
[2:07:49] and closer to the light I began to hear
[2:07:51] him speak one thing to each of them he
[2:07:54] said I saw a black woman that was around
[2:07:57] probably around six foot tall she was
[2:08:00] such a huge uh uh colored woman he said
[2:08:05] she must have weighed around 300
[2:08:07] lb but he said she had over a hundred
[2:08:11] Angels standing with her in that
[2:08:17] line
[2:08:19] so I asked the faceless
[2:08:21] manh so many
[2:08:23] angels He said she was an
[2:08:26] evangelist she was a soul winner on the
[2:08:29] earth and a great mother in her
[2:08:32] time it's her time now and she's going
[2:08:35] home and there are many left behind that
[2:08:38] are grieving her
[2:08:39] loss I watched as she came close to him
[2:08:44] he asked her one
[2:08:47] question
[2:08:49] I want you to know already it wasn't
[2:08:51] what church do you go
[2:08:52] to who your pastor is can you show us
[2:08:56] your baptism
[2:08:59] certificate you didn't ask her what
[2:09:01] prophet had helped her get
[2:09:04] there he asked her one question
[2:09:08] daughter did you learn to
[2:09:12] love she threw up her
[2:09:14] hands and said oh yes Lord
[2:09:19] oh yes Lord I learned to
[2:09:24] love then he kissed her and the double
[2:09:28] doors opened up into his
[2:09:31] heart he put his arms around her and she
[2:09:34] said I saw he said I saw her as she went
[2:09:37] right into the Lord's heart and those
[2:09:40] angels went with her remember this is
[2:09:43] symbols he said I asked the faceless man
[2:09:47] why are they going home with with her he
[2:09:49] said because they helped her in her life
[2:09:52] and Ministry on Earth and now they're
[2:09:54] going home with her you see he's telling
[2:09:58] us now in this interview you're going to
[2:09:59] judge
[2:10:02] angels and he said one of the judgments
[2:10:05] will
[2:10:06] be how they helped you and served you in
[2:10:10] Ministry you will commend them you will
[2:10:13] testify to others for Angels have no
[2:10:17] testimony
[2:10:19] he said their only testimony is when a
[2:10:21] saint
[2:10:24] remembers that they were helpful to them
[2:10:26] in life so when they go home they'll
[2:10:29] have that testimony be your
[2:10:35] testimony he said they will be equal
[2:10:38] partakers in the work that we have done
[2:10:40] for the
[2:10:42] Lord he said also everybody that's
[2:10:45] praying for these
[2:10:47] Ministries I saw the people that were
[2:10:50] never seen out in the open were equal
[2:10:53] partakers with that black sister for
[2:10:57] they supported her and prayed for her so
[2:11:00] what she did they had a testimony beyond
[2:11:02] anything they
[2:11:04] imagined he explained that to me one
[2:11:07] time by
[2:11:08] saying he said I saw I saw ministers and
[2:11:12] I saw people gathered with
[2:11:14] them and I knew that they were those who
[2:11:18] had prayed for them and fasted for their
[2:11:20] Ministry and so forth and when it came
[2:11:22] time for them to receive their reward
[2:11:25] God was also giving rewards to those
[2:11:28] that had given offerings to help them to
[2:11:30] go those who had prayed for them those
[2:11:33] who had made sacrifices to support their
[2:11:36] Ministry when it came time to be
[2:11:38] rewarded they also shared in the reward
[2:11:41] how many of you like that thought Bible
[2:11:44] said so the Bible tells us we don't do
[2:11:48] anything in the name of the Lord that's
[2:11:52] not
[2:11:53] remembered Great Book of remembrance is
[2:11:55] kept for every prayer you pray for
[2:11:58] somebody else for every sacrifice you
[2:12:01] make to be a blessing in somebody else's
[2:12:04] life as you're learning to love is
[2:12:06] anybody still here said the second one I
[2:12:09] saw in the line was a little girl about
[2:12:11] 11 years
[2:12:13] old she had the most beautiful Ministry
[2:12:16] of helps that I had ever seen
[2:12:19] I was told that she had become crippled
[2:12:21] at 5 years old bedfast shortly after
[2:12:24] that she lay bad fast and pray day and
[2:12:27] night for the Saints and she was going
[2:12:31] home in the condition that she had died
[2:12:35] with I said why isn't she straightened
[2:12:38] up the spirit said this is her testimony
[2:12:41] for now in heaven she's going to walk
[2:12:46] around but her testimony for now is to
[2:12:50] be is to be reminded to remind that her
[2:12:53] life was not a normal life it was a
[2:12:56] sacrificial life he said I heard him ask
[2:13:01] the little girl did you learn to
[2:13:05] love and she said oh yes Lord for she
[2:13:09] couldn't have lied she can't you can't
[2:13:12] lie there it wasn't her lips speaking it
[2:13:16] was her conscience her spirit man then
[2:13:20] he reached down and embraced her and
[2:13:23] kissed her and in she went and it was
[2:13:26] like one of the greatest testimonies
[2:13:28] that will be
[2:13:30] there then in front of me was a woman
[2:13:33] who had died at
[2:13:35] 93 her fingers were nothing but huge
[2:13:40] knots arthritis had so attacked her body
[2:13:43] and hands for I would say 50 years she
[2:13:48] had lived in great pain from
[2:13:52] arthritis and then I heard the Lord ask
[2:13:54] her did you learn to love I want you to
[2:13:58] listen to her answer Only You
[2:14:06] Lord did you learn to love Only You
[2:14:11] Lord remember he told us in this
[2:14:14] experience you couldn't
[2:14:16] lie
[2:14:19] Only You
[2:14:20] Lord as you know I lost my husband when
[2:14:24] I was
[2:14:25] young and I let it make me
[2:14:31] bitter I stayed in the
[2:14:34] church but I never really did anything
[2:14:36] but bite
[2:14:40] people because of my
[2:14:44] bitterness but she wasn't in love
[2:14:48] and he told her you're saved by
[2:14:52] grace but in heaven there will be no
[2:14:56] rewards you'll be the least in the
[2:14:59] Kingdom of Heaven because you didn't
[2:15:01] learn to
[2:15:03] love so in she went and I was
[2:15:09] next Bob said I was thinking Lord I did
[2:15:12] get saved I learned to love I was doing
[2:15:14] what I was doing because I love I was
[2:15:17] obeying you because I loved I'm ready
[2:15:19] for my
[2:15:21] kiss he said I'm all puckered
[2:15:24] up ready for my kiss and I won't have to
[2:15:28] ever go through that pain again I'll
[2:15:30] never have a bummer day again this is
[2:15:32] the greatest day of my life I'm thinking
[2:15:35] as I drew close to him he looked at me
[2:15:37] with eyes which looked right through
[2:15:39] me he said you talk about a spooky
[2:15:42] feeling man he he looked me all over he
[2:15:46] could just look and instantly he xray
[2:15:48] everything in me I'm telling you that
[2:15:50] was frightening when the eye of God is
[2:15:52] on you and I don't hear many people
[2:15:55] talking about it but he said man it
[2:15:57] terrorized me he said I saw this
[2:16:01] beautiful man in white he was white
[2:16:04] light the only thing that weren't white
[2:16:07] were his two beautiful eyes they look
[2:16:10] like Wells with water and light at the
[2:16:12] bottom shining in a depth you could not
[2:16:15] see you couldn't fa the depth of his
[2:16:18] eyes and they looked right through me
[2:16:20] you couldn't hide anything from him so
[2:16:23] then he put out his left hand and he
[2:16:26] said Satan has killed you before your
[2:16:30] time I want you to go back because you
[2:16:34] were doing what I told you to
[2:16:37] do and I'm thinking your thoughts are
[2:16:40] really words there because your mouth
[2:16:43] isn't speaking it's only your spirit
[2:16:46] speaking and he said yeah Bonnie asked
[2:16:50] him you mean it it was your conscious
[2:16:52] speaking yes I was my lips weren't
[2:16:56] moving he said but this word these words
[2:16:58] were coming out of me I've not
[2:17:00] accomplished anything I'm really
[2:17:02] failing and he said Jesus looked right
[2:17:05] at him and said you're a liar now I
[2:17:08] wasn't there just telling you what he
[2:17:10] said because you brought my words and my
[2:17:14] words will accomplish the things that I
[2:17:17] have sent them to to do you did obey me
[2:17:21] in bringing them well I didn't do very
[2:17:25] well on that one and I said but it's so
[2:17:28] painful down there I'm continually under
[2:17:31] persecution and he said yeah your old
[2:17:34] nature was
[2:17:37] cowardly that's the coward in
[2:17:40] you but I will bring you in if you'll
[2:17:43] look at this line over here and turn
[2:17:46] your face back to me for I want you to
[2:17:48] go back so I turned my eyes toward the
[2:17:51] line and it was the most pitiful
[2:17:53] horrible thing I'd ever seen and I
[2:17:56] turned back to him and I said Lord when
[2:17:58] I was saved in the Baptist Church I had
[2:18:01] a love for
[2:18:02] souls he said I would go back for one
[2:18:07] soul I would go back down and bear my
[2:18:10] cross for one Soul he said I'm not
[2:18:14] sending you back to Die For One Soul I'm
[2:18:16] sending you back to prepare the people
[2:18:18] for the last Harvest he goes on to talk
[2:18:21] to him about the youth that are coming
[2:18:23] in in the last days I want you to tell
[2:18:26] them about heaven and hell I want you to
[2:18:29] wake them
[2:18:30] up when you were a Baptist your main
[2:18:33] heart was leading someone to me now I
[2:18:35] want you to go back and reveal me to
[2:18:38] leaders I said okay then I got my kiss
[2:18:43] and the next thing you know I'm back in
[2:18:45] the room and the doctors were staring
[2:18:47] staring down at me now I don't know
[2:18:50] whether that experience says anything to
[2:18:53] you or does anything for you I know it's
[2:18:57] strange I know it's odd but I felt like
[2:19:01] if I was going to tell you what was said
[2:19:04] the best thing I would do and the right
[2:19:06] thing to do would be to tell you the
[2:19:09] experience I can't imagine that little
[2:19:12] woman with her knotted up
[2:19:14] hands standing in the presence of the
[2:19:17] Lord and realizing I was only able to
[2:19:20] love you Lord but I wasn't able to love
[2:19:23] your people she went in because she
[2:19:27] loved
[2:19:29] him but she had no
[2:19:32] reward does that disturb anybody she had
[2:19:36] no reward other than eternal life
[2:19:40] because she would spend her time on
[2:19:43] Earth
[2:19:45] biting the people in the church
[2:19:48] Church does anybody know what I'm
[2:19:50] talking
[2:19:51] about yes it's verse 20 if a man say I
[2:19:57] love God and hateth his brother he is a
[2:20:01] liar for he that loveth not his brother
[2:20:04] whom he hath seen how can he love God
[2:20:08] whom he hath not
[2:20:11] seen in the message do you now believe
[2:20:14] if you'll come with me for just a few
[2:20:16] moments
[2:20:18] brother brandom said now I'd like to
[2:20:19] tell you what my secret of the greatest
[2:20:22] how you like me to tell you tonight what
[2:20:25] I think is the greatest most powerful
[2:20:28] force there is on Earth would you like
[2:20:30] me to tell you about it in a few minutes
[2:20:33] you might not love me so well after this
[2:20:36] I'll just tell you all the mightiest
[2:20:39] Force there is on
[2:20:43] Earth is
[2:20:45] love he said that's exactly there's
[2:20:48] nothing that will break love down no
[2:20:51] matter what it is whatever you are or
[2:20:56] what you might have sung sang you might
[2:20:59] have danced in the spirit you might have
[2:21:01] spoke with tongues you might have shook
[2:21:03] the Elder's hand you might have been
[2:21:05] baptized three times This Way backwards
[2:21:08] face forward any way you want to but
[2:21:12] until love hear this church but until
[2:21:15] love anchors in your
[2:21:21] heart you read
[2:21:23] it you're still out of
[2:21:26] God somebody said where is that in the
[2:21:29] scripture I just read it to you in 1
[2:21:31] John chapter 4 if you're not in love if
[2:21:35] you can't love the Brethren he said then
[2:21:38] God is not in you and of course if God
[2:21:40] is not in you you are not in God come on
[2:21:44] now and it's easy to love our
[2:21:48] favorites it's easy to love those who do
[2:21:51] like we do or do like we like for folks
[2:21:54] to do it's a little more challenging to
[2:21:57] love that's why I believe he was asked
[2:21:59] in the vision did you learn to
[2:22:03] love love is not something that you can
[2:22:06] just pull out of your heart it's not
[2:22:09] something like a magic trick you can
[2:22:10] pull out of a hat God is the author of
[2:22:14] love the only way to overcome not loving
[2:22:17] one another is to draw closer to the
[2:22:20] Lord he is love amen the closer we get
[2:22:24] to God the more we'll love him the more
[2:22:27] we'll appreciate his love for us and the
[2:22:30] more we will learn to love one another
[2:22:33] the popular and the
[2:22:35] unpopular those in our click and not in
[2:22:38] our
[2:22:39] click those we get along good with and
[2:22:42] like to relax with and those we don't
[2:22:44] like to relax with we've got to love
[2:22:48] them anyhow and it's not loving them in
[2:22:50] word that God is interested in when we
[2:22:53] learn to love one another it's not by
[2:22:56] word only it's by
[2:22:58] deed it's by
[2:23:00] Behavior are you with
[2:23:03] me you're going to stay
[2:23:06] surefooted then he said you're going to
[2:23:08] have to learn to love in the
[2:23:12] message oh did he go on excuse me the
[2:23:15] strongest force is there more to that
[2:23:17] one or is that the end of that that's
[2:23:19] the end of that one in the kinsman
[2:23:22] redeemer he goes on to say hatred had a
[2:23:26] beginning so it has to have an end
[2:23:29] brother Shaw sent me a note right before
[2:23:32] the service that was sent out by the
[2:23:35] Mogi County Police Department the
[2:23:37] Columbus Police Department letting
[2:23:39] people know that they had intelligence
[2:23:42] information given to them that today was
[2:23:45] going to be a national day of hate
[2:23:49] that was going to be sponsored by by th
[2:23:51] those groups that are
[2:23:53] anti-semitic and that they were going to
[2:23:55] be particularly stationing extra police
[2:23:59] around
[2:24:00] synagogues over the weekend because even
[2:24:03] though uh the Sabbath is passed Sunday
[2:24:07] is is a day in America among Jews of
[2:24:11] going back to the synagogue for
[2:24:13] Fellowship for meals uh for committee
[2:24:16] meetings and all the things that they do
[2:24:18] that you and I might would do on the
[2:24:20] first day of the week they go back and
[2:24:22] so can you imagine a national day of
[2:24:29] hate and it's done because hatred had a
[2:24:33] beginning but thanks be to God if it had
[2:24:36] a beginning guess what it's going to
[2:24:38] have no end brother brandom said love
[2:24:41] had no
[2:24:45] beginning so it has no
[2:24:48] end because love was a part of the great
[2:24:51] light that's what he
[2:24:53] means love was a part of that great
[2:24:56] Fountain of Light that would create
[2:24:59] something to
[2:25:01] worship and when something to worship
[2:25:04] first the Fountain of Light the logos
[2:25:06] went out of that and then creation
[2:25:10] followed and then that which was created
[2:25:12] turned around to begin to worship that
[2:25:15] logos to worship the god that stepped
[2:25:18] out of that great light hatred he said
[2:25:22] hatred is forever that means it has an
[2:25:25] end love is
[2:25:28] eternal hatred begins and hatred will
[2:25:31] end love never did begin and it never
[2:25:34] will end see it is eternal how many of
[2:25:38] you understand that in the song of songs
[2:25:41] I want you to go there with me for just
[2:25:42] a few
[2:25:43] moments Song of Songs chapter 8
[2:25:48] verse
[2:25:49] 5-7 Aaron would you come and get the
[2:25:52] microphone for brother Shelly and give
[2:25:53] it to Ellas
[2:25:55] please I'm straining a little bit now
[2:25:58] and let him read these verses to us Song
[2:26:03] of Songs chapter 8 verses
[2:26:11] 5-7 did you turn it on son may have not
[2:26:15] turned it on
[2:26:22] who is this that come who is this it's a
[2:26:26] question who is
[2:26:29] this that cometh up from the Wilderness
[2:26:33] leaning upon her beloved I raised thee
[2:26:36] Up Under The Apple Tree there thy mother
[2:26:40] brought thee forth there she brought
[2:26:42] thee forth that bear thee now listen
[2:26:45] this could this could only be go back oh
[2:26:49] there it is this could only be bride
[2:26:52] speaking back to
[2:26:55] bridegroom bridegroom says who is this
[2:26:59] that cometh up from the Wilderness
[2:27:01] leaning upon her
[2:27:03] beloved bridegroom says I raised thee Up
[2:27:07] Under The Apple Tree there thy mother
[2:27:11] brought thee forth there she brought
[2:27:13] thee forth that bear thee bridegroom to
[2:27:16] bride
[2:27:18] now let's go
[2:27:20] on set me as a seal set
[2:27:24] me position me as a
[2:27:30] seal upon thine heart as a seal upon
[2:27:34] thine arm for love is strong as death
[2:27:37] for love is strong as death I want to
[2:27:41] make sure you understand that it is my
[2:27:43] belief that this is bridegroom room
[2:27:47] speaking to bride now I say that because
[2:27:52] you may have footnotes in your Bible not
[2:27:54] scripture verse but you may have
[2:27:57] footnotes in your Bible to the
[2:27:59] contrary and that is because the Song of
[2:28:03] Solomon is one of the most confusing
[2:28:05] books of the Bible to the minds to the
[2:28:08] theologians to those who study the word
[2:28:11] and they argue all the time if you ever
[2:28:13] look into it they argue over the time
[2:28:16] all the time who's talking and some
[2:28:19] believe that it's not possible to have
[2:28:22] bridegroom and bride talking in the same
[2:28:24] paragraph of course it
[2:28:27] is we don't always speak in
[2:28:32] paragraphs and who made these
[2:28:35] paragraphs the writers of the Bible
[2:28:37] didn't make these
[2:28:39] paragraphs the
[2:28:42] Catholics with the influence of King
[2:28:45] James
[2:28:47] on that's who made Major Prophets and
[2:28:50] Minor
[2:28:51] Prophets The Bible doesn't call the
[2:28:54] difference between major and minor the
[2:28:57] Catholic system did come on
[2:29:00] now if you really understand the
[2:29:04] politics of the
[2:29:07] 1600s you will understand that even in
[2:29:10] our beloved King James Bible is the
[2:29:14] great also there is the Great influence
[2:29:17] of the Catholic church because through
[2:29:19] the years she kept getting her hands in
[2:29:24] it as often as she
[2:29:27] could there are many people that believe
[2:29:29] in order to have a more accurate
[2:29:31] translation of scripture you'd have to
[2:29:33] go back to original from the
[2:29:36] 1500s and there you might have even a
[2:29:39] more I'm not concerned about the
[2:29:41] accuracy of the King James version I
[2:29:44] believe it's accurate but in our present
[2:29:48] day bible we have the influence of those
[2:29:52] who decided paragraphs verse numbers
[2:29:55] major minor footnotes did you know
[2:29:58] there's people that preach out of the
[2:29:59] footnotes like it's thus sayeth the
[2:30:02] Lord
[2:30:04] wow if you were to read the footnotes of
[2:30:07] a scoffield Bible you would find out
[2:30:09] that Scofield believe that Mark 16 was
[2:30:12] not
[2:30:14] inspired so scoffield would have been a
[2:30:17] better believer in a modern-day Message
[2:30:20] Church than brother
[2:30:23] brandom because we still have scof
[2:30:26] Fields Among
[2:30:30] Us scoffield was a Baptist Theologian
[2:30:33] and he was flat out
[2:30:35] wrong about multiple things and when we
[2:30:39] have allowed because brother brandham
[2:30:41] preached out of a scoffield Bible
[2:30:43] doesn't mean that brother brandham was
[2:30:45] in alignment
[2:30:47] with everything scoffield
[2:30:49] taught although we do find brother
[2:30:52] brandom reading the
[2:30:55] Mysteries and adding a few of them to
[2:30:59] the list of the scoffield
[2:31:02] Bible just because he mentioned I have a
[2:31:05] scoffield Bible doesn't mean he believed
[2:31:07] that Mark 16 wasn't inspired I want you
[2:31:10] to know he believed it was expire
[2:31:13] inspired not expired they all believe
[2:31:16] it's expired he believed it was inspired
[2:31:18] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:31:21] they shall recover they shall speak with
[2:31:24] new tongue and Scofield sing oh oh oh oh
[2:31:28] this will tear up my Baptist Church come
[2:31:31] on I can't let them think that there's
[2:31:33] going to be signs and wonders in the
[2:31:35] modern church but I'm telling you what
[2:31:37] if the if the presence of God and the
[2:31:40] workings of the spirit are not there I
[2:31:42] heard brother brandom say yesterday it's
[2:31:44] not a church
[2:31:47] he said it's just a
[2:31:51] lodge I want more than a lodge I could
[2:31:54] have joined the odd fellas if I wanted a
[2:31:57] lodge but I want to be a part of a
[2:31:59] family of God that believes that he's
[2:32:02] the same yesterday today and forever so
[2:32:05] I'm not going to argue with the
[2:32:06] theologians because I found just as many
[2:32:09] who believe that this is bride speaking
[2:32:11] to bridegroom I found just as many who
[2:32:13] believe this is bridegroom speaking to
[2:32:14] bride I don't believe the bride is
[2:32:16] telling the Lord to put a seal on his
[2:32:19] heart and this was written as an
[2:32:21] allegory it's written as a prophetic
[2:32:24] story concerning not just the love of of
[2:32:27] Solomon and the shunamite woman but also
[2:32:31] our love for the bridegroom and the
[2:32:34] bridegroom's love for us you understand
[2:32:37] that so set me as a seal upon thine
[2:32:40] heart in my in my understanding it's
[2:32:43] more likely the bridegroom saying to the
[2:32:45] bride set me as a seal upon thine heart
[2:32:49] and a seal upon thine arm the seal is
[2:32:53] the symbol of authority and having it on
[2:32:56] an outward position and not just an
[2:32:58] inward position it means that the
[2:33:01] bridegroom is saying whatever you do
[2:33:04] don't
[2:33:06] forget that I have sealed my love for
[2:33:10] you with a covenant and that Covenant in
[2:33:14] that Covenant is where our love is found
[2:33:17] and in that Covenant is where Authority
[2:33:20] is found in the
[2:33:24] seal I say that to the modern Church who
[2:33:28] has taken that to mean something as
[2:33:30] silly as a
[2:33:33] tattoo I don't believe the bridegroom
[2:33:36] and there are theologians who say the
[2:33:38] the modern way of expressing this would
[2:33:41] be to have a tattoo
[2:33:45] no so you've got the this hippie Church
[2:33:49] rushing out to get a tattoo of a heart
[2:33:52] on their arm so they don't ever forget
[2:33:54] his love let me tell you something if
[2:33:57] he's writing anything he's writing it on
[2:33:59] your
[2:34:00] heart but he's telling you keep a
[2:34:02] reminder make a reminder for love is
[2:34:05] strong as death jealousy is cruel as the
[2:34:09] grace sorry I forgot you're supposed to
[2:34:10] be reading set me as a seal read
[2:34:13] it set me as a seal upon thine heart
[2:34:16] as a seal upon thine arm for love is
[2:34:19] strong as death can you imagine love is
[2:34:23] as strong it is as sure as
[2:34:27] death jealousy read it jealousy is cruel
[2:34:32] as a grave does anybody know that let me
[2:34:35] see your hand if you know that jealousy
[2:34:37] is cruel oh my goodness what a
[2:34:40] Taskmaster jealousy desires to be in our
[2:34:43] life it wants to keep us on the Geral
[2:34:46] wheel of performance it wants to keep us
[2:34:49] constantly comparing ourselves to others
[2:34:51] and other people's lives to Our Lives
[2:34:54] why don't this little bride make up our
[2:34:56] mind we're coming down off the gerbal
[2:34:58] wheel of performance we're not going to
[2:35:01] try to compare our life with someone
[2:35:03] else our family with someone else's
[2:35:06] family we're going to try to fall so in
[2:35:08] love with our bride
[2:35:10] groom that he matters more than
[2:35:15] possessions he matters more than fancy
[2:35:19] trips he's everything read on
[2:35:23] brother the coals thereof are coals of
[2:35:26] fire which hath a most vehemo flame he's
[2:35:29] talking about love love like coals of
[2:35:32] fire passionate Burning
[2:35:36] Love the kind of love that a husband has
[2:35:39] for his wife a wife for her husband in
[2:35:42] the
[2:35:44] beginning
[2:35:47] it often
[2:35:49] Fades because we take it to be something
[2:35:58] sexual perhaps the necessity of that
[2:36:01] doesn't leave
[2:36:03] us but the importance and the priority
[2:36:07] of that certainly shift in
[2:36:12] life I'm going to say
[2:36:14] it the more mature you get that you're
[2:36:17] not ripping one another's clothes off so
[2:36:19] to speak do you understand sir but of
[2:36:23] course we want to have a passionate love
[2:36:26] for one another to hold a marriage to
[2:36:29] hold a family together the bridegroom
[2:36:31] here is using this kind of a love let it
[2:36:34] be like a burning in your heart not
[2:36:40] heartburn the world likes to call it
[2:36:44] butterflies it felt more like like
[2:36:46] bumblebees or something in
[2:36:48] mine butterfly is too
[2:36:51] delicate that burning love that you have
[2:36:54] for your companion the one that God has
[2:36:56] chosen for you but this is this is
[2:36:59] greater than that this is greater than
[2:37:01] that love this is a love and a passion
[2:37:04] for Christ that when we tell him we love
[2:37:07] him we mean it with every it's so easy
[2:37:09] listen to me folks please it's so easy
[2:37:12] to be religious and to say I love the
[2:37:15] Lord
[2:37:16] yes and it's just words what does that
[2:37:18] look like if you really love the Lord
[2:37:21] what does that look like well I want I
[2:37:22] want to give you one example he means
[2:37:25] more to you than your
[2:37:28] buddies he means more to you than your
[2:37:33] hobbies he means more to you than your
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:38] habits loving the Lord is about
[2:37:42] priorities it's about placing things in
[2:37:45] the right bes Setter in the right order
[2:37:48] yes sir and our priorities are right sir
[2:37:53] it's one of the reasons why fasting can
[2:37:55] be so effective is because it reminds us
[2:37:59] that the Lord is more important than the
[2:38:04] meal knowing that he hears you knowing
[2:38:07] that he sees you knowing that he's
[2:38:10] mindful of you knowing that he looks at
[2:38:13] you and recognizes your love for him
[2:38:17] becomes more
[2:38:24] important most of the funnest times I
[2:38:27] know that's not a
[2:38:28] word most of the funnest times of our
[2:38:31] life seem to surround fellowship and
[2:38:36] food and the Lord wants us to eat and
[2:38:39] enjoy the fruit of our labor as a gift
[2:38:41] of God and he wants us to have
[2:38:44] fellowship with one with one one another
[2:38:47] but what he wants more than anything
[2:38:49] else is to have fellowship with you and
[2:38:51] I as individuals and he wants us to come
[2:38:55] to the place where we become as
[2:38:58] addicted to that experience to that
[2:39:02] moment of fellowship and intimacy with
[2:39:04] him more
[2:39:07] addicted it becomes more of a necessity
[2:39:10] to get along with him it becomes more of
[2:39:13] a necessity to hear his voice than to
[2:39:16] even hear your wife's Voice or your
[2:39:18] husband's Voice or your pastor's voice
[2:39:21] to long to hear the voice of the
[2:39:24] bridegroom do whatever you have to do
[2:39:27] that's Godly and moral to set a seal
[2:39:30] upon your heart and upon your
[2:39:32] arm so that you don't ever forget his
[2:39:36] love for you and that love is strong as
[2:39:38] death and that jealousy is cruel as a
[2:39:41] gravee and I want you to know the Bible
[2:39:43] tells us that our God can be a jealous
[2:39:45] God
[2:39:46] God and His jealousy is toward
[2:39:50] us there is no other God for him to be
[2:39:53] jealous of if he's a jealous God he's
[2:39:55] jealous of our time he's jealous of our
[2:39:58] dedication to other
[2:40:01] things he's jealous because we let so
[2:40:04] many things separate us from God and
[2:40:06] from God's house
[2:40:14] right anybody
[2:40:17] here read on
[2:40:21] brother many Waters cannot quench love
[2:40:26] you can't wash it
[2:40:28] out neither can the floods drown it if a
[2:40:33] man would give all the substance of his
[2:40:35] house for love it would utterly be
[2:40:39] contemned it means if he should give
[2:40:42] everything and gain love everything he
[2:40:46] gives would be
[2:40:49] nothing it would be like the Apostle
[2:40:51] said I count it all but
[2:40:59] dung it's all
[2:41:02] void it's all
[2:41:04] waste it's all without
[2:41:07] value the only thing that matters now is
[2:41:10] that I may gain Christ that I may win
[2:41:13] Christ that I may have his effect ction
[2:41:16] that I may have his attention that I may
[2:41:18] have his love let me tell you something
[2:41:20] your point of view you'll fight all day
[2:41:22] you'll argue to the midnight hour
[2:41:24] because of your
[2:41:28] opinion you'll fight for your right
[2:41:31] you'll fight for your voice you'll fight
[2:41:33] for your opinion we ought to be that
[2:41:35] passionate to fight for for our place
[2:41:38] with
[2:41:40] him that means sometime setting
[2:41:43] something else aside
[2:41:46] and say Lord I'm all
[2:41:48] in I'm not playing around this
[2:41:53] time we have some brethren here over the
[2:41:56] past few weeks who have been setting
[2:41:58] aside that unto the
[2:42:02] Lord they've not been able to lock
[2:42:05] themselves in a
[2:42:06] cabin every day along with God because
[2:42:09] they're working to provide for their
[2:42:12] families what if somebody said the only
[2:42:15] way I can get close to the Lord is quit
[2:42:17] my job that's
[2:42:20] foolishness that's
[2:42:22] foolishness a man that won't work and
[2:42:24] provide for his own is worse than an
[2:42:26] Infidel he's already denied the
[2:42:30] faith be nice if you could have some
[2:42:33] vacation be nice if you could I told
[2:42:35] these Brethren that be nice if you could
[2:42:38] but if you
[2:42:41] can't then you steal the time you take
[2:42:44] the time you can in and may God
[2:42:47] strengthen you and I've watched it I
[2:42:49] tell you I don't want to say too much
[2:42:51] because you can lose your
[2:42:53] reward you can lose the benefit of your
[2:42:56] sacrifice by talking about it too
[2:42:59] much but I would say to anyone here if
[2:43:02] you're going to enter into to a
[2:43:04] prolonged time of fasting you need to
[2:43:07] tell a spiritual leader or a spiritual
[2:43:09] person in your life who can cover you in
[2:43:11] prayer because not only do you draw
[2:43:13] closer to the Lord you become more
[2:43:17] sensitive we've seen what the enemy can
[2:43:20] do when people are in a vulnerable place
[2:43:23] that's right we're not talking about
[2:43:25] being
[2:43:26] angry sir we're talking about being weak
[2:43:29] and how the enemy can lie he like to
[2:43:31] deceive
[2:43:32] somebody who's seeking the Lord he he's
[2:43:35] Limited at what he can do but he would
[2:43:38] like to do something that's right to
[2:43:41] hinder and so you want to know that
[2:43:43] you've got a prayer covering that
[2:43:45] someone is crying out to God on your
[2:43:48] behalf and I can tell you and others can
[2:43:51] testify a later time if they so would so
[2:43:54] desire that God is a supernatural God
[2:43:57] and when someone really says I've had
[2:44:01] enough I'm desperate I've got to let him
[2:44:05] know that I want
[2:44:08] him more than anything else and I'm sick
[2:44:12] of me yes I'm sick of my bad choices I'm
[2:44:17] sick of my
[2:44:18] addictions I'm sick of my
[2:44:23] apathy and when someone sets their heart
[2:44:26] to do like that I'm I'm I'm
[2:44:28] amazed at how God supernaturally will St
[2:44:31] I had someone tell me this week I I I
[2:44:35] almost
[2:44:36] expected that I would come to the place
[2:44:39] that I could no longer
[2:44:44] work
[2:44:46] because as you work as you labor you you
[2:44:50] you exert
[2:44:51] energy which is
[2:44:54] calories if you're not taking in calor
[2:44:58] calories you don't have a lot of
[2:45:01] energy you're really depending on the
[2:45:03] Lord now let me say this there must be a
[2:45:07] balance in all things and I've always
[2:45:10] told people if you're going to fast for
[2:45:11] an extended amount of time you need to
[2:45:14] know that the Lord is calling
[2:45:16] you that he's calling you because you're
[2:45:18] going to want his help you're going to
[2:45:20] need his help and you want to know that
[2:45:22] you've got
[2:45:23] covering because there's so many things
[2:45:26] that the enemy likes to do as I said a
[2:45:29] moment ago in vulnerable times like this
[2:45:32] someone said to me this week because I
[2:45:34] was that part of the prayer covering for
[2:45:37] that individual and I know there were
[2:45:39] family members also
[2:45:41] praying but it said to me I I I really
[2:45:44] sort of expected my maybe even possibly
[2:45:47] it would come but it did not come and I
[2:45:49] stand
[2:45:51] amazed and even though I'm sort of
[2:45:54] scheduled to come to an end I don't know
[2:45:56] at this moment hopefully a decision is
[2:45:58] made now but I don't know at this
[2:46:01] moment if if I'm going to end or not
[2:46:04] because I can see how God has
[2:46:07] strengthened me through this time let me
[2:46:09] tell you something he's jealous over you
[2:46:11] I hope you hear me he's jealous over you
[2:46:16] he loves you so
[2:46:23] much he may not wear you on his arm but
[2:46:26] the Bible said he written you in his
[2:46:29] hand he couldn't forget you it's like he
[2:46:32] said about Jerusalem basically I
[2:46:35] couldn't forget her if I wanted to I
[2:46:37] love her too
[2:46:40] much when you've disappointed
[2:46:43] him he might would have won wanted when
[2:46:45] I've disappointed him he might would
[2:46:47] have wanted to forgive forget us but
[2:46:50] instead he just forgives us again
[2:46:53] because he loves us so much read it
[2:46:55] again there finish it up for me read the
[2:46:58] seventh verse the last time many Waters
[2:47:01] cannot quench love neither can the
[2:47:04] floods drown it if a man would give all
[2:47:07] the substance of his house for love it
[2:47:09] would utterly be contemned Bible tells
[2:47:12] us to let a man love God with all of his
[2:47:17] heart with all of his
[2:47:19] strength with all of his might it's the
[2:47:23] greatest
[2:47:24] commandment can someone tell me the
[2:47:26] second greatest
[2:47:28] commandment to love your
[2:47:31] neighbor as
[2:47:33] yourself you can't do that apart from a
[2:47:37] relationship you can have kindness
[2:47:39] toward your neighbor that's not what the
[2:47:41] Bible's telling
[2:47:42] us this is love them and love their soul
[2:47:46] as much as you would love the soul of
[2:47:48] your own
[2:47:50] children that is not possible in the
[2:47:52] natural it is only possible as a
[2:47:55] spiritual
[2:47:57] birth we're birthed into
[2:48:00] something and before we
[2:48:02] close I want to go to Matthew chapter
[2:48:05] 24 and I want to tell you where we
[2:48:09] are we're living in this
[2:48:13] day and then you you read this read this
[2:48:17] verse for me would
[2:48:18] you and then shall many be offended and
[2:48:22] shall betray one another and shall hate
[2:48:25] one another aren't we there
[2:48:28] sir sir aren't we in that hour yes
[2:48:32] sir we're seeing Prime
[2:48:36] examples can you imagine
[2:48:40] overwhelming someone's safe
[2:48:43] place the their neighborhood where they
[2:48:46] live where they
[2:48:48] work where they
[2:48:51] Fellowship where they have
[2:48:55] settled to raise their
[2:48:58] children and you rush
[2:49:01] in they have never offended you they
[2:49:04] have never wronged
[2:49:06] you they've never stolen from
[2:49:09] you they've never harmed you in any way
[2:49:13] and yet you Poss possess listen to
[2:49:16] me you possess such a
[2:49:19] hatred for those people that you've
[2:49:22] never laid eyes on that you've never
[2:49:25] even
[2:49:26] seen that you would invade their world
[2:49:29] on a on a on a Saturday
[2:49:32] morning on their religious
[2:49:35] day unfortunately so many of them
[2:49:38] secular but you would invade their home
[2:49:41] the safety of their home the sanctity of
[2:49:43] their home
[2:49:45] and you would line them
[2:49:48] up in a
[2:49:51] huddle dragging children away from their
[2:49:54] parents look you don't have to take the
[2:49:56] media's word you don't have to take my
[2:49:58] word you can see the videos for yourself
[2:50:00] be glad to forward you
[2:50:03] some I can't imagine the fear in their
[2:50:06] heart I can certainly see it in their
[2:50:08] eyes as a dad is drug away from his wife
[2:50:11] and children huddling there on a on a
[2:50:14] bench in their
[2:50:15] home they dragged the dad out and shoot
[2:50:18] him they dragged the young teenage boy
[2:50:20] out and shoot him they had more Mercy
[2:50:23] for that family than they did for other
[2:50:25] families because some of them were found
[2:50:27] in their homes hugging one
[2:50:30] another can you imagine huddling around
[2:50:33] your children and holding on to them a
[2:50:36] and closing your eyes and gritting your
[2:50:38] teeth and waiting on the
[2:50:42] bullet that's what we've just experiened
[2:50:44] erience in our in our
[2:50:48] world just a few months
[2:50:51] ago and yet in America today is going to
[2:50:54] be a day of hate not for those who
[2:50:59] perpetrated such
[2:51:01] evil but for the
[2:51:04] relatives of those who were
[2:51:07] murdered we hate them so that we're
[2:51:10] going to march in the
[2:51:12] street they shut down the square around
[2:51:16] Big B and and marched on the bridge and
[2:51:19] stopped the traffic on the bridge in
[2:51:22] London to to show their
[2:51:27] hatred that's the world that we're
[2:51:30] living in
[2:51:31] today and we must not be a part of a
[2:51:35] society that's
[2:51:37] offended by everything that
[2:51:43] happens
[2:51:46] we were in the parking
[2:51:48] lot yesterday
[2:51:51] and two African-American
[2:51:54] men were walking down the center of a
[2:51:58] busy parking
[2:52:01] lot they were very much aware that we
[2:52:03] were behind them because you could see
[2:52:06] them glancing behind their shoulder to
[2:52:09] see I want you to know this one was one
[2:52:13] of the biggest he was so
[2:52:16] big his shoulders were broad his legs
[2:52:20] were so thick they couldn't straighten
[2:52:23] out and he was walking
[2:52:26] bowlegged so
[2:52:28] large so slow instead of moving over it
[2:52:32] wasn't his
[2:52:33] weight he was
[2:52:35] beefy he wasn't just fat it wasn't his
[2:52:40] handicapped it was his attitude that
[2:52:43] sent him right down the center not to
[2:52:46] the
[2:52:48] side why would you even mention that
[2:52:50] because I'm the one my family can tell
[2:52:54] you I'm the one who always says to my
[2:52:57] family move out of the way somebody's
[2:52:59] trying to get by it makes me so nervous
[2:53:01] to think that I'm holding someone else
[2:53:04] up I don't look to see what color they
[2:53:06] are I don't want to hold anybody up they
[2:53:08] may have more time than I do but I'm
[2:53:10] just conscious and polite enough to say
[2:53:13] I don't want nobody wait on us and you
[2:53:15] know how you can get to talking sometime
[2:53:17] and you get further and fur closer and
[2:53:18] closer to hindering somebody from going
[2:53:21] by let's stand over here I don't know
[2:53:22] how many times I've said to my family
[2:53:24] let's stand over here and talk so we're
[2:53:27] not hindering anybody and they don't
[2:53:28] even have to slow down afraid but the
[2:53:31] attitude on that young man as he walks
[2:53:33] down that aisle and when we begin to go
[2:53:36] around him he hears the acceleration
[2:53:38] because we've been going so
[2:53:41] slow it wasn't a revving of the motor it
[2:53:43] was the motor kicking
[2:53:46] in that he heard and he turns around
[2:53:49] both of them and looks at us with such
[2:53:54] hatred and I said to my family I know
[2:53:59] people think I'm crazy I wish that I
[2:54:02] could go up to
[2:54:04] him I wish that I could go up to him in
[2:54:07] the store and say you don't have any
[2:54:12] idea who we are
[2:54:15] we wish you
[2:54:17] absolutely no
[2:54:19] harm the color of your skin is not
[2:54:23] offensive to us your attitude is what
[2:54:27] Grieves my heart oh how I would like to
[2:54:30] say to you that everybody hasn't
[2:54:33] everybody doesn't hate
[2:54:35] you it must be awful to grow up
[2:54:40] taught come on now oh yes they see it
[2:54:43] they see displays of hatred and that
[2:54:46] breaks my heart but a society that
[2:54:49] surrounds them that causes them to
[2:54:51] believe that
[2:54:53] everybody the enemies told you lies that
[2:54:56] have nothing to do with your R everybody
[2:54:58] hates you nobody likes you it's a lie
[2:55:00] somebody somewhere likes you you may
[2:55:04] have to go out of this room to find
[2:55:06] them somebody likes you I would like to
[2:55:10] I said to my I wish I could just pour
[2:55:12] out my heart and tell you don't
[2:55:14] understand that by doing this you're not
[2:55:17] bringing a people together you're
[2:55:19] pushing races farther apart you're not
[2:55:22] healing anything if you and I I I mean
[2:55:26] honestly if if it's a good thing that I
[2:55:29] don't do what I everything I think
[2:55:32] of it it makes you want to jump out and
[2:55:34] walk along with them and show them and
[2:55:38] whoever it's the same way with the Jews
[2:55:41] and the Arabs it's the same way with
[2:55:43] mexic me an and whites and Mexicans and
[2:55:46] blacks a Prejudice and an
[2:55:50] offense I've not done anything to that
[2:55:52] young man or those two young men they've
[2:55:55] not particularly done anything to me
[2:55:57] until they
[2:55:59] decide you're white and you're going to
[2:56:01] wait on
[2:56:04] me and that doesn't it does it does
[2:56:07] flare you but it breaks my
[2:56:11] heart it breaks my heart because if
[2:56:14] somebody doesn't do
[2:56:16] something their little children that are
[2:56:18] spread out among women all over town
[2:56:22] their little children are going to grow
[2:56:24] up and they're going to think that every
[2:56:26] person that's white hates them and they
[2:56:29] don't stand a chance in life that breaks
[2:56:32] my heart I can't stand that thought and
[2:56:35] vice versa and however it works and if
[2:56:38] I've not said it right and I've offended
[2:56:40] Somebody by the way I've tried to say it
[2:56:42] I apologize for that but but what I'm
[2:56:44] really trying to say is we've got to
[2:56:46] make a difference we can't change it
[2:56:50] all but we've got to refuse somehow to
[2:56:54] not be a part of the
[2:56:55] Prejudice we've got to choose not to be
[2:56:58] offended at everything that goes
[2:57:00] on we've got to choose not to have our
[2:57:03] feelings hurt and be mad about
[2:57:05] everything that goes on around us so
[2:57:07] that we would even betray one
[2:57:09] another this is Jesus talking red letter
[2:57:13] many shall be offended and betray one
[2:57:15] another and shall hate one
[2:57:19] another can you imagine the the
[2:57:22] police saying we're going to watch the
[2:57:25] synagogues because of this day of hatred
[2:57:29] in our nation it's for the Jews it's
[2:57:31] more than a day it's every day and I
[2:57:34] have to say for the for the
[2:57:35] African-Americans also in many
[2:57:38] situations it's more than a day it has
[2:57:41] become a Perpetual uh thing
[2:57:44] and that's why I say if I could if I
[2:57:46] could speak to them I and and and they
[2:57:48] would see my heart and not not take
[2:57:51] offense I would I would like to show
[2:57:53] somebody how perhaps you can be a a part
[2:57:56] of solving the
[2:57:58] problem instead of continuing it to be
[2:58:01] worse and worse and betraying one
[2:58:03] another hating one another read the next
[2:58:07] verse and many false prophets shall rise
[2:58:10] and shall deceive many that's how we
[2:58:12] know we're living in the last days
[2:58:17] that's right that's how we know we're
[2:58:18] living in the last days the entire
[2:58:20] prophetic movement the Pentecostal uh
[2:58:22] prophetic movement the charismatic
[2:58:24] prophetic movement and all of their
[2:58:28] prophecies Trump will not
[2:58:34] lose within 30 days he'll be overturned
[2:58:37] and Biden will be put out of the White
[2:58:39] House and Trump will take his place and
[2:58:41] I could go on and on and on and on
[2:58:43] because I I was s they were sent to me
[2:58:46] many times in fact some of you sent them
[2:58:48] to
[2:58:51] me and and if something should happen
[2:58:54] that he should ever be elected again
[2:58:56] that is no
[2:58:59] Vindication on for those who said he
[2:59:02] Biden wouldn't be in office a
[2:59:04] year these prophets can't take any
[2:59:06] Vindication in any of those things but
[2:59:09] we are
[2:59:10] learning that we're in the last days
[2:59:13] everybody's offended about something
[2:59:15] everybody's willing to betray everybody
[2:59:17] else and false prophets are rising to
[2:59:20] deceive many read the next
[2:59:24] verse and because iniquity shall abound
[2:59:27] and because iniquity shall abound
[2:59:32] iniquity is generational
[2:59:37] sin iniquity is not just hitting the uh
[2:59:41] aiming at the Mark and missing the mark
[2:59:43] that that's the generalized word in the
[2:59:45] Greek for sin to to aim at the Mark and
[2:59:47] to miss the mark iniquity is more than
[2:59:50] just a
[2:59:51] sin iniquity is generational sin it's
[2:59:56] inbred
[2:59:57] sin it's something so deep in a
[3:00:03] society that without
[3:00:06] God there is no hope aren't we in that
[3:00:10] hour because iniquity shall abound the
[3:00:14] Bible talks about an hour where men will
[3:00:16] kill
[3:00:17] you and think they've done God to Ser
[3:00:20] are you with
[3:00:21] me they'll kill you and think they've
[3:00:24] done God of
[3:00:26] service that's the hour we're living in
[3:00:28] finish it for me would you brother the
[3:00:31] love of many shall wax cold and because
[3:00:34] iniquity shall abound the love of
[3:00:38] many shall wax
[3:00:41] cold that's where we are in this Society
[3:00:43] and that's where we are in this hour and
[3:00:45] unfortunately the end time
[3:00:47] church is also dealing with the
[3:00:51] stronghold of love that has grown cold
[3:00:54] yes I want to talk to you just a moment
[3:00:56] before we leave here I want you to
[3:00:59] understand that we can expect love to be
[3:01:02] cold where truth is not present because
[3:01:05] truth is love and love is truth and
[3:01:08] where truth is there has to be a genuine
[3:01:10] love to go with that truth but we can
[3:01:14] expect that because generational
[3:01:16] iniquity goes uncalled out undal with un
[3:01:20] prayed for un preached about on that in
[3:01:25] those kinds of environment we can expect
[3:01:27] for
[3:01:28] sure that love would grow
[3:01:31] cold but not where there's
[3:01:35] truth and yet even around this end time
[3:01:40] message love has become cold
[3:01:46] yes we know that we're living in the end
[3:01:49] time and now we also know that the
[3:01:52] influence of modern society has not only
[3:01:55] affected the modern
[3:01:57] church but it's also affected the true
[3:02:00] followers of Jesus Christ and it should
[3:02:03] grieve our hearts today and tomorrow and
[3:02:05] the next day and the next day and the
[3:02:06] next day in fact we should make it a
[3:02:08] matter of Prayer in fact we should call
[3:02:11] it out to the Lord in fact we should
[3:02:13] call out ourselves out before the Lord
[3:02:15] we should say father you search me now
[3:02:18] you let me know Lord is my love cold if
[3:02:21] my listen folks if our love is cold
[3:02:23] toward him I guarantee you I promise
[3:02:26] you our love toward one another's Frozen
[3:02:30] that's right or
[3:02:32] gone it's either Frozen or absent right
[3:02:37] it's only in a heartfelt passionate
[3:02:41] relationship with God seeing our
[3:02:45] need for relationship with God that's
[3:02:48] the only atmosphere it's the only
[3:02:52] environment that can keep our love in
[3:02:54] the
[3:02:55] incubator and keep it from growing
[3:02:58] cold in the church age book brother
[3:03:02] brandom says something this is taken
[3:03:04] from one of the
[3:03:07] messages and I I want to use it because
[3:03:09] of that he said I want to give a warning
[3:03:13] right here
[3:03:14] it says concerning the last days that
[3:03:17] because of abounding iniquity the love
[3:03:19] of many will wax cold in the leodan or
[3:03:23] last age
[3:03:28] selflove this is the
[3:03:31] problem this is the root of
[3:03:33] homosexuality this is the root of all
[3:03:36] forms of sexual
[3:03:39] perversion this is the root of anger it
[3:03:43] is the root of
[3:03:45] jealousy it is the root of
[3:03:48] bitterness it's the spirit of the
[3:03:51] age people's
[3:03:53] rights and
[3:03:56] selflove in the Le de in or last age
[3:03:59] selflove and
[3:04:01] love for material
[3:04:04] things will take the place of the true
[3:04:09] love of
[3:04:11] God he said we need to guard against the
[3:04:15] power of
[3:04:16] sin in these last
[3:04:19] days so many are getting so hard because
[3:04:22] they haven't realized the effect of this
[3:04:26] last day spirit I dare say there's folks
[3:04:29] under the sound of my voice right now
[3:04:31] that your love for the Brethren is
[3:04:34] frozen and you've not yet even realize
[3:04:38] how Frozen it
[3:04:42] is because cuz around the altar at the
[3:04:45] end of the service you hug a
[3:04:48] neck you shake a
[3:04:51] hand and you leave perhaps feeling like
[3:04:54] you've loved
[3:04:56] somebody you don't so quickly forget
[3:04:59] those you
[3:05:01] love you don't hug somebody on Sunday
[3:05:04] and never think about them again till
[3:05:05] Tuesday night how many of you have ever
[3:05:10] loved the very nature of of human
[3:05:14] love is you don't forget your children
[3:05:17] you don't forget your husband you don't
[3:05:20] forget your
[3:05:21] wife perhaps you stand on guard for them
[3:05:24] in the spirit all the
[3:05:27] time so how can it be that we only think
[3:05:30] about church folk when we see them on
[3:05:33] Sunday or we see them on Tuesday we must
[3:05:37] be carrying one another in our heart I
[3:05:41] need some help I'm certainly not going
[3:05:43] to stop until I get
[3:05:45] some we need to be carrying one another
[3:05:49] in our heart if you do God bless you and
[3:05:52] strengthen you if you're really one of
[3:05:55] those who says I'm praying for you and
[3:05:58] you really are God bless you but I think
[3:06:01] many of us have become comfortable
[3:06:10] lying because we may tell someone we're
[3:06:12] praying
[3:06:14] we may send praying
[3:06:17] hands but because our love is so
[3:06:22] Frozen many times we feel like well I
[3:06:25] went through some hard things and I got
[3:06:27] up I picked myself up and I made it
[3:06:30] through so they can
[3:06:33] too and you're not
[3:06:38] wrong what causes some people to lose
[3:06:41] sleep never never even bothers other
[3:06:48] people you think of someone asking for
[3:06:51] prayer for a journey of 4
[3:06:54] hours and you say to yourself I drive
[3:06:57] drive 12 hours and I don't ask anybody
[3:06:59] to pray for me you might ought
[3:07:06] to somebody ask for prayer like that and
[3:07:09] and the thought come to your mind well
[3:07:10] I'm not going I'm not praying over a
[3:07:13] just get in the car and be careful and
[3:07:14] the angels are going with you amen come
[3:07:17] on I've I've driven many times like that
[3:07:20] and I didn't tell anybody and nobody was
[3:07:22] fasting for me and oh no no no no don't
[3:07:24] you let that get in your heart don't let
[3:07:26] your love for somebody be frozen if
[3:07:28] somebody cares enough to ask you to pray
[3:07:30] for them brother sister that's why I
[3:07:32] meant I was going to get my prayer
[3:07:33] request
[3:07:34] in I couldn't help it I had to go to
[3:07:39] privy but those people cared enough they
[3:07:41] wanted you to know that they had a need
[3:07:44] they wanted you to ask the Lord to help
[3:07:47] them on their behalf and let me tell you
[3:07:49] something we can't be so
[3:07:51] callous or our love so Frozen
[3:07:55] on that we don't take the time to call
[3:07:59] somebody's need before the
[3:08:04] Lord I've had to say to the
[3:08:09] Lord yes
[3:08:12] Lord
[3:08:14] they're
[3:08:20] aggravating yes
[3:08:24] Lord they need sometime a good kick
[3:08:28] there you go in the rump yes
[3:08:32] Lord but they've got a
[3:08:35] need and I want you to move for
[3:08:41] them they may add aggravate me but I
[3:08:44] love
[3:08:46] them and I want you to help
[3:08:49] them I think about all the people out
[3:08:51] there that don't see their need for help
[3:08:54] and neither do they find a source if
[3:08:57] they saw that they had a need for help
[3:08:59] they'd rather look to the
[3:09:01] government than to look to
[3:09:03] God if there's anybody in this house and
[3:09:06] you're depending on the government to
[3:09:08] take care of you as things get tougher
[3:09:10] I'm telling you right now you better
[3:09:12] have a plan
[3:09:15] B if someone is depending on Social
[3:09:17] Security and Medicaid for their future
[3:09:20] you better go ahead and turn your life
[3:09:21] over to the Lord and understand that you
[3:09:25] can't depend on the government for your
[3:09:27] future you're going to have to have the
[3:09:29] help of the Lord and remember what he
[3:09:31] said I've seen the right I am an old man
[3:09:33] but I've never
[3:09:35] seen the righteous
[3:09:40] forsaken I don't have any buckets in you
[3:09:43] may make fun of people that have buckets
[3:09:45] but you may wish you had a
[3:09:47] bucket one day with something dry to
[3:09:51] pour a little water on and
[3:09:53] eat because we can't depend on
[3:09:56] Republican government or de democratic
[3:09:59] government or middle of the road
[3:10:02] independent government to take care of
[3:10:04] us we're in the hands of God we're in
[3:10:06] the hands of the Lord come on now you
[3:10:09] can't even depend on the insurance
[3:10:10] companies in this hour
[3:10:13] they'll let you down too they'll show
[3:10:16] you some fine print
[3:10:18] somewhere you're going to have to put
[3:10:20] yourself in the hands of the Lord we've
[3:10:22] got to guard against the power of sin in
[3:10:25] these last days we've got to learn to
[3:10:27] love one another let me tell you
[3:10:29] something having eternal life is not all
[3:10:32] I
[3:10:34] want I want more than just an eternity
[3:10:37] in peace
[3:10:39] yes I want to know that I've pleased the
[3:10:42] Lord amen and I'm going to tell you
[3:10:44] folks we're not pleasing the Lord we
[3:10:46] can't please the Lord if we're not
[3:10:48] loving the
[3:10:49] body not just in
[3:10:52] word I tell you I
[3:10:55] think one of the best things you can do
[3:10:59] if you love somebody is to pray for them
[3:11:04] right you can rest
[3:11:06] assured that if you've asked me to pray
[3:11:09] for you I may forget to sing sister
[3:11:12] Beverly a
[3:11:13] song but I promise you I haven't forgot
[3:11:16] to pray for you because I learned many
[3:11:19] years ago you may not need a list now I
[3:11:22] need a list for everything you may not
[3:11:25] need a list for everything but you need
[3:11:26] a list for prayer you need to write down
[3:11:29] who you're to be praying for and if you
[3:11:31] can remember their need write that need
[3:11:33] down on that piece of paper and if you
[3:11:36] get to a place where you can't pray you
[3:11:38] get to a place where you can't be
[3:11:40] faithful to your promise you hold that
[3:11:42] paper up to the Lord I've been so
[3:11:46] sick that I felt like I needed prayer
[3:11:49] more than anybody on the
[3:11:51] list and I wasn't able to go down that
[3:11:54] list like I do every day and call every
[3:11:56] name I've been there a few days where I
[3:11:59] wasn't able to do that but you know what
[3:12:00] I can do I can hold those list up before
[3:12:03] the Lord I've got them I have one master
[3:12:07] list and I have many other
[3:12:09] lists and I hold those up before the
[3:12:12] Lord Lord when I'm not able to do more
[3:12:14] and say oh
[3:12:16] Father I'm waving these before
[3:12:19] you because they may just look like
[3:12:22] little needs to me but they're big needs
[3:12:24] to the ones who
[3:12:26] ask we need you to move folks let's
[3:12:28] don't let our love become Frozen for one
[3:12:31] another let's don't wish to see
[3:12:34] something I I
[3:12:36] I I know that we
[3:12:39] earn father's discipline
[3:12:44] I know sometimes it's the only thing
[3:12:47] that can change
[3:12:48] us is a spanking in Papa's
[3:12:52] Woodshed but when you really love the
[3:12:58] Brethren you'll cry out to God on their
[3:13:02] behalf to intervene and intercede even
[3:13:05] when you think the best
[3:13:09] solution is for papa to spank them real
[3:13:11] good
[3:13:13] don't ever refrain your prayers don't
[3:13:16] ever hold your prayers back because you
[3:13:18] think somebody's way out is to get what
[3:13:20] they what they need don't you ever think
[3:13:22] and don't let me ever think that I know
[3:13:25] what some people need more than God is
[3:13:28] anybody with me I don't know it if you
[3:13:31] are or not we need to guard against the
[3:13:34] power of sin in these last days Let's uh
[3:13:37] so many are getting so hard because they
[3:13:39] haven't realized the effect of this last
[3:13:40] day spirit it's time to draw nigh to God
[3:13:44] and let him fill our lives with his love
[3:13:47] that's the key that's the key that's why
[3:13:49] praise is so
[3:13:51] important that's why standing in the
[3:13:53] atmosphere of the Lord is so important
[3:13:56] I'm going to finish I'm not stopping
[3:13:58] until I know I'm
[3:13:59] done come on
[3:14:04] now this is
[3:14:06] highly
[3:14:09] important it's time to draw n to God and
[3:14:11] let him fill our lives with his love or
[3:14:14] we will feel the coldness of the last
[3:14:16] day church and reject the truth of God
[3:14:19] which alone is able to help us in those
[3:14:22] dark and Dreadful years the True Vine
[3:14:24] held its love for God and love of the
[3:14:28] Brethren and God commended them for
[3:14:33] it Elias I know it's 10 after two I'm
[3:14:38] not
[3:14:38] done read questions and answers for me
[3:14:41] quite a few paragraphs there we might
[3:14:45] close I remember years ago you always
[3:14:49] hear them talk about the sawdust trails
[3:14:52] and things in the Tabernacle that didn't
[3:14:55] make it anymore not a bit more but then
[3:14:59] it was fresh God was calling his
[3:15:02] church I've seen them sob and cry and
[3:15:05] lay on the altar all night long yes I
[3:15:08] went to their houses and you could hear
[3:15:11] them when you come up
[3:15:13] just in their bed Chambers men and women
[3:15:16] crying out oh
[3:15:18] God you'd see them walk through the
[3:15:20] church and I'd see the piano start
[3:15:22] playing Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross yes
[3:15:26] and the tears flowing down there you
[3:15:28] know sniff sniff sniff sniff thank
[3:15:31] you walk into this church then walk down
[3:15:35] to another church and hear them there
[3:15:38] there's a precious Fountain oh God save
[3:15:41] my boy save my daughter she's lost Lord
[3:15:46] please right you don't find that no more
[3:15:50] what's the matter the spirit of God is
[3:15:54] withdrawed Jesus said predicted this
[3:15:57] that the love because the love of many
[3:16:00] their love would
[3:16:02] fail that because iniquity would abound
[3:16:05] the love of many would fail see see grow
[3:16:09] cold go away love is dying
[3:16:14] away and what they got into it just a
[3:16:19] form read it just a form beat the piano
[3:16:24] up and down real hard and yell glory to
[3:16:28] God hallelujah amen praise the Lord see
[3:16:32] like that it's just a form it's just a
[3:16:36] form don't fool yourself see just
[3:16:39] fooling yourself see listen brother
[3:16:42] until until we I got I go like this I'm
[3:16:48] I'm not talking about our Tabernacle I'm
[3:16:50] talking about what I find around the
[3:16:52] United States it's become just a form
[3:16:55] just kind of acting that we used to have
[3:16:59] and that travail of Soul it's just about
[3:17:02] over oh brother sister God have mercy
[3:17:06] upon us come on may God have mercy do
[3:17:09] you hear Brother brandom giving us a a a
[3:17:13] state of the church in America in
[3:17:18] 1954 I can tell you she's no better off
[3:17:21] in
[3:17:22] 2024 than she was in
[3:17:25] 1954 and we can stand here today and
[3:17:27] talk about the cold love of the
[3:17:30] denominational Church system we can talk
[3:17:33] about the cold love of somebody else's
[3:17:35] church but the reason why we're here
[3:17:38] today is not to examine what anybody
[3:17:40] else is doing right or wrong we're here
[3:17:42] to examine our own life did
[3:17:47] you did you learn to love did you learn
[3:17:52] to
[3:17:54] love big mama learned to
[3:17:58] love 300 lb one solds all of her
[3:18:04] life black-faced I've seen them kind of
[3:18:11] mamas
[3:18:13] there used to be more than one in this
[3:18:17] town there used to be one when I was a
[3:18:19] little boy who stood on the street
[3:18:22] corner in
[3:18:24] Columbus with a tambourine in her hand
[3:18:28] sister
[3:18:30] Annie a choir robe
[3:18:33] on she beat that tambourine in front of
[3:18:36] the bus
[3:18:40] stops people would walk fast asked to
[3:18:42] get by her but they didn't Heckle her it
[3:18:46] wasn't like it is
[3:18:49] now most people bowed their head when
[3:18:52] they walked by her she was big she might
[3:18:55] have been I don't think she was 300 lb
[3:18:57] but she was pretty big and she'd sang
[3:19:00] without a m only
[3:19:03] tambourine if you would have asked her
[3:19:05] why are you doing that mama she just
[3:19:07] said I got to reach one Soul just got to
[3:19:09] let somebody know that Jesus loves them
[3:19:14] amen that was kind of like this woman
[3:19:17] that Bob saw did you learn to oh Lord
[3:19:20] yes I learned to
[3:19:23] love there's a little girl
[3:19:25] crippled has every reason to let a
[3:19:28] little bitterness creep in her heart but
[3:19:31] like so many
[3:19:33] times she ought you hear of it and see
[3:19:35] it she
[3:19:37] overcame in that
[3:19:39] handicap and she learned to love and she
[3:19:42] learned to
[3:19:44] pray and she learned not to be bitter
[3:19:47] and not to compare her life to somebody
[3:19:49] else's
[3:19:50] life and she stood there in the presence
[3:19:53] lay there in the presence of the Lord
[3:19:55] about to get her legs back oh yes Lord I
[3:19:59] learned to love but here's a moment you
[3:20:01] couldn't lie you couldn't lie he said
[3:20:02] you couldn't lie whatever you
[3:20:05] do learn to
[3:20:08] love and here was an old woman in her
[3:20:10] 90s her Knuckles all twisted from
[3:20:14] arthritis she's standing there in the
[3:20:16] presence of the Lord did you learn to
[3:20:18] love Only You
[3:20:21] Lord I learned to love
[3:20:24] you you know what she was saying I Had
[3:20:27] Enough gospel preached to
[3:20:30] me that I learned to love you but my
[3:20:34] husband left me and bitterness crept
[3:20:37] into my
[3:20:40] life
[3:20:43] sometimes prayer it takes more than
[3:20:46] prayer to get that bitterness
[3:20:49] out takes more
[3:20:53] repentance I don't want you to
[3:20:55] misunderstand
[3:20:58] me but I know in my heart that one of
[3:21:03] the reasons why my mother had to go
[3:21:05] through what she went through at the end
[3:21:07] of her life is
[3:21:10] because
[3:21:13] God wanted to make
[3:21:16] sure that there was nothing in her
[3:21:20] heart he loved her enough somebody said
[3:21:23] why would you say that being out of your
[3:21:25] mind let me tell you something I know I
[3:21:28] don't think it I don't believe it I know
[3:21:31] he was talking to
[3:21:33] her I was in the room at times
[3:21:36] especially when she was in the hospital
[3:21:38] and I would stay from from nearly sun up
[3:21:41] to till till sometimes 9 and 10:00 at
[3:21:44] night and and she would lay there
[3:21:47] especially the last time when they told
[3:21:49] us she needed hospice care and she lived
[3:21:51] another six or seven eight months
[3:21:53] whatever it
[3:21:54] was there were times that she would lay
[3:21:57] there and she would she would be
[3:21:58] mumbling and and it wasn't like someone
[3:22:01] out of their
[3:22:02] mind I knew that the Lord was talking to
[3:22:05] her I knew that he loved her so
[3:22:08] much that he didn't want her to go out
[3:22:10] of here holding OD against
[3:22:16] anybody she had lived so many years with
[3:22:22] bitterness for the things that she had
[3:22:25] gone
[3:22:26] through for the rejection of my dad and
[3:22:30] how he rejected
[3:22:31] her and she had tried so hard to get
[3:22:35] that out of her heart and out of her
[3:22:37] mind but there was always an element of
[3:22:39] it that
[3:22:40] lingered and it was all right right as
[3:22:42] long as it wasn't brought up but if it
[3:22:43] was ever brought up you could see a fire
[3:22:46] come in her
[3:22:47] eyes and God knows exactly what he's
[3:22:50] doing even when we don't think he
[3:22:53] does he gave her an opportunity that she
[3:22:57] couldn't argue
[3:23:00] back and he talked to her heart and I
[3:23:02] believe with all my heart that she let
[3:23:05] go of every bit of that and I believe
[3:23:07] that when she left here there wasn't
[3:23:09] anything in her heart toward anybody
[3:23:11] body she was truly ready to inherit
[3:23:14] eternal life I would rather it be that
[3:23:19] way than for her to have stepped in and
[3:23:22] had
[3:23:24] nothing to be remembered for over in
[3:23:27] eternity it's one thing to be remembered
[3:23:28] here but you're certainly going to want
[3:23:30] to be remembered in eternity as
[3:23:33] well no Lord I I learned to love you but
[3:23:37] I I didn't learn to love other people I
[3:23:39] let bitterness control my life maybe
[3:23:41] you're here
[3:23:43] today and you realize that you've
[3:23:45] allowed the circumstances of your life
[3:23:47] to make you so
[3:23:51] selfish that you've loved yourself I
[3:23:54] could point my fingers but then I'd have
[3:23:57] to put them right back to me wouldn't
[3:24:00] I because there's been times in my own
[3:24:03] life that I realized I was looking out
[3:24:06] for me in a
[3:24:09] situation more than others
[3:24:12] and I had to repent and maybe you need
[3:24:14] to repent maybe you haven't repented
[3:24:17] yet maybe you're missing out on an
[3:24:20] opportunity
[3:24:24] I I grieve to
[3:24:27] think I'm not trying to be sentimental
[3:24:30] with you but I'm telling you life goes
[3:24:32] by so
[3:24:35] fast and you think the day is going to
[3:24:38] come you're going to feel better and
[3:24:39] you're going to build a relationship
[3:24:41] with some
[3:24:42] somebody you're going to fix a
[3:24:44] relationship with your children or with
[3:24:46] your parents or whatever it is well life
[3:24:48] is but I want to tell you something it's
[3:24:49] going by so
