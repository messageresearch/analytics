[1:54] opportunity for the past few years to be
[1:56] able to identify and be associated with
[2:00] These Fine Christian networks that are

[2:14] let's be faithful to support these

[2:19] this program on with our faithful
[2:22] prayers and if at all possible even with
[2:24] your financial support be a blessing to
[2:27] these networks they're doing a lot lot
[2:30] for the kingdom of God we want to get
[2:32] right back into our study we've been
[2:35] studying on God's pattern for mankind
[2:38] how we can discover what God desires for
[2:42] us in our lives and how we can measure
[2:45] up uh to to the absolute word of God so
[2:49] that we can be used for the sake of the
[2:52] Kingdom in this last hour so let's get
[2:55] right back to the word again shall we do
[2:58] that in Revelation chapter 11 last week
[3:02] we were reading in verse one and there
[3:04] was given me this is John and there was
[3:07] given me a reed like unto a rod and the
[3:11] angel stood saying rise and measure the
[3:15] temple of God number one and the altar
[3:19] number two and them that worship therein
[3:23] number three the reason why I read that
[3:26] on the broadcast last week is to
[3:30] uh remind us as Believers to remind us
[3:34] that there is a measuring device whereby
[3:38] we are measured not just the the
[3:41] Tabernacle the sanctuary of God in the
[3:44] wilderness was to be certain Dimensions
[3:47] not just the Ark of the Covenant or even
[3:50] Noah's Ark uh we had very specific
[3:53] dimensions given for that uh the room of
[3:56] the altar the holy Place uh all of these
[4:00] instruments of of the Tabernacle and the
[4:02] temple there were meticulous details
[4:05] given color design Dimensions but but
[4:09] even us as worshippers God told John
[4:13] that even the worshippers should be
[4:15] measured now remember that John wasn't
[4:18] allowed to just use any measuring device
[4:21] he had to use the one that God gave him
[4:24] and the measuring device that God uses
[4:28] in this hour to measure those that
[4:30] worship Him is his holy word his
[4:35] unadulterated word of God the pure word
[4:38] of God not not man's watered down
[4:41] interpretations like we have today but
[4:44] the pure word of God and and I know that
[4:47] everyone doesn't have the privilege of
[4:49] being able to study the ancient
[4:51] languages of scripture but if you had
[4:54] that opportunity you would discover a
[4:56] new world when you look at God's word
[4:59] when we start looking at it in the
[5:01] original languages that it was first
[5:03] written in it gives us tremendous
[5:06] insight and when I run across something
[5:08] like that I I'm not a scholar by any
[5:11] means but when I run across something of
[5:13] Interest like that I enjoy sharing it
[5:16] with my congregation and I enjoy sharing
[5:18] it with my television congregation as
[5:20] well because I don't know how you feel
[5:24] but when I fell in love with the Lord I
[5:26] fell in love with his word his word is
[5:28] life to me and I need it every day of my
[5:31] life also on the broadcast last week we
[5:34] talked about the very definition of
[5:36] measurement it means to ascertain the
[5:39] size the amount or the degree of
[5:42] something by using an instrument or
[5:44] device marked in standard units or by
[5:48] comparing it with an agreed standard and
[5:51] again that agreed standard must be the
[5:54] word of God we talked about uh how that
[5:58] that uh great Det details were given
[6:01] concerning every choice that was to be
[6:03] made in the Tabernacle in the temple and
[6:06] it causes us to believe that if God's
[6:09] first Dwelling Place the Tabernacle was
[6:12] to be according to a certain measurement
[6:14] pattern and design if if the temple was
[6:17] also to be according to a certain
[6:19] pattern measurement and design that also
[6:22] God's final Dwelling Place the place
[6:26] that he wanted to dwell all along that
[6:28] it would also o be uh according to God's
[6:32] pattern his measurement and his design
[6:34] and I'd like to read to you a scripture
[6:37] found in the book of Acts the acts of
[6:39] the Holy Spirit by the apostles in Acts
[6:42] chap 7 beginning in verse 45 we find out
[6:46] it's revealed to us where that final
[6:50] Dwelling Place of God is not the
[6:52] Tabernacle not the temple but that final
[6:56] place the place that God longs to dwell
[6:59] with all all of his being so let's look
[7:01] at it verse 45 of chapter 7 of the book
[7:04] of Acts why which also our fathers that
[7:07] came after brought in with Jesus into
[7:11] the possession of the Gentiles whom God
[7:14] drave out before the face of our fathers
[7:17] unto the days of David verse 46 who
[7:20] found favor before God and desired to
[7:24] find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob
[7:27] verse 47 but Solomon built him a house
[7:30] that's first we have the Tabernacle now
[7:32] we have Solomon building him a house
[7:34] what was that called that was the Holy
[7:37] Temple verse 48 how be it the most high
[7:40] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[7:43] as saith the prophet verse 49 Heaven is
[7:46] my throne and the Earth is my foot stol
[7:50] what house will ye build me sayith the
[7:53] Lord or what is the place of my rest
[7:58] hath not my hand made all these things
[8:01] God is saying that there is no place big
[8:05] enough to contain his fullness but he
[8:08] asked the people what house will you
[8:11] build me and of course man has tried to
[8:16] do that he has tried to build great
[8:18] Cathedrals beautiful Church buildings
[8:21] with Steeples high and lofty stained
[8:25] glass windows padded pews the finest
[8:28] that the world has to offer but we found
[8:31] out in the scripture that none of that
[8:33] is good enough to be a dwelling place
[8:36] for God not even the mega church the
[8:39] multi uh multi-million dollar facilities
[8:42] of this world it's still not fine enough
[8:45] it's not sufficient enough because it's
[8:48] not where God's looking to dwell he's
[8:50] looking to dwell in a house that only
[8:53] you can build him a house that only I
[8:57] can build him and what what house is
[8:59] that well the scripture tells us in the
[9:01] newer Covenant know ye not that your
[9:05] body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit
[9:09] God is not looking for a tabernacle to
[9:12] dwell in any longer or a temple made
[9:15] with men's hands he is looking to dwell
[9:19] inside of this Temple of your temple our
[9:23] our mortal body he wants to come in uh
[9:27] in the older Covenant we had God above
[9:29] us in the newer Covenant through
[9:31] Emmanuel the Lord Jesus our Messiah we
[9:34] had god with us but in this age and in
[9:39] this dispensation we not only have god
[9:42] with us but we have God in us God by the
[9:46] Holy Ghost by the spirit of God lives
[9:49] inside of the believer quickening us
[9:53] making us alive and revealing the
[9:56] heartbeat of God to men I don't know
[9:59] about you but I want to know what God is
[10:02] after in my life uh on the first uh
[10:06] broadcast of this series a couple weeks
[10:08] ago I made the analogy of of uh someone
[10:12] I know this is kind of hard for you to
[10:14] get your brain around maybe I hope it'll
[10:16] be something you can relate to but it
[10:19] would be like somebody baking God a
[10:21] lemon pie or every time they came to
[10:24] worship they make this beautiful lemon
[10:26] mering pie and they bring it to God and
[10:30] and um and give it to him as an offering
[10:32] and then one day uh when they stand in
[10:35] God's presence in heaven they find out
[10:37] that God didn't care anything about
[10:39] lemon pie his favorite pie was
[10:42] strawberry now that may sound a little
[10:44] bit silly to you but what I'm trying to
[10:47] say in that is I think a lot of times we
[10:51] do the same things over and over and
[10:53] over again because that's what we've
[10:55] been taught in Creeds and dogmas of men
[10:59] and we have come to think that that's
[11:01] what God is interested in uh maybe it's
[11:04] in you know statues or in sense or some
[11:09] of the other strange things that we have
[11:12] borrowed from Pagan religions and uh
[11:15] place them front and center in
[11:18] Christianity and and we haven't stopped
[11:21] to ask God God what do you think about
[11:23] us praying to statues God what do you
[11:26] think about us you know burning incense
[11:28] in your house and what do you think
[11:30] about us uh confessing our sins to to a
[11:34] priest and what what do you think about
[11:36] all of these things I'm not trying to be
[11:39] offensive to anybody's faith I'm just
[11:41] telling you God may not be interested in
[11:44] your lemon pie he may have a partiality
[11:47] to strawberry pie and we want to when we
[11:51] stand before him we want to know that we
[11:53] have been giving him what he likes what
[11:56] he desires out of us
[11:59] so what are we supposed to do are we
[12:01] supposed to find out what the Pope says
[12:04] that God likes or our pastor says that
[12:07] God likes or do we have something even
[12:10] uh more pure than that I think we do
[12:13] although I I appreciate our Godly
[12:16] leaders in the faith but I think God has
[12:19] given us the recipe for the pie that God
[12:23] likes the best he's given us his word
[12:27] and he not only gives us this word and
[12:29] leaves us alone to figure it out but he
[12:32] gives us the precious Holy Spirit the
[12:34] holy ghost that that breaks the word
[12:37] down that helps us to digest the word of
[12:40] God we always use that analogy of food
[12:44] because the word of God becomes like
[12:46] food to us it doesn't feed our flesh it
[12:49] feeds our Inner
[12:51] Man it gives us strength it gives us
[12:55] sustenance it gives us refreshment that
[12:58] we need to live in this wicked world
[13:01] that we're living in and so the recipe
[13:04] for God's favorite dinner it's right
[13:07] here in the book and we've got the Holy
[13:09] Spirit to help us work through it to
[13:11] discern to find out how we can best
[13:14] apply it because some people say well
[13:16] that's a antique book that book was
[13:19] written thousands of years ago how could
[13:21] it possibly have any re relevance for
[13:24] today I beg your pardon this book is as
[13:28] update as any book that was written
[13:31] yesterday because it wasn't written by
[13:33] men uh out of their own intellect it was
[13:37] written by men who were moved upon by
[13:40] the holy spirit of God and I'll tell you
[13:42] the Holy Spirit doesn't get stale there
[13:45] is no expiration date to the Holy Spirit
[13:49] he is just as present and real and
[13:52] relevant today as he was 2,000 years ago
[13:55] so the Holy Spirit can take this word of
[13:58] God and show us how to apply it to
[14:01] Modern Life and uh sure technology has
[14:06] rocked on and we're living in a
[14:07] different kind of culture today than
[14:09] what they were living in then but this
[14:11] word of God is still very relevant and
[14:13] it is still very applicable to our life
[14:16] and whether we like it or not this book
[14:19] is still the measuring device for the
[14:22] worshippers we're being measured right
[14:24] now whether we realize it or not and
[14:27] I'll tell you I'm going to be a little
[14:28] bold here it's time to quit playing
[14:30] church it's time to quit being
[14:33] Hypocrites I know that all of you are
[14:35] not able to relate to what I'm saying
[14:38] because you're not guilty but the spirit
[14:40] of God is reaching out to those of us
[14:42] who may be who have who have uh been
[14:46] doing the same old thing for so long
[14:48] that we've just never stopped and asked
[14:50] God is that really what you want me to
[14:52] be doing anyway we've grown cold and
[14:55] stagnant in our faith we need a Revival
[14:59] a Revival that doesn't start in the
[15:01] church house a Revival that starts in
[15:03] this house what house will you build me
[15:07] says the Lord what kind of Temple will
[15:10] you give me to dwell in well you can't
[15:12] make the choice of the colors and you
[15:14] can't make the choice of the material
[15:17] you can't make the choice of the
[15:18] dimensions and standards of that of that
[15:21] house even though you say well it's mine
[15:24] well it is no longer yours this body is
[15:28] no longer your body this body is now his
[15:32] body we are bought with the price we now
[15:35] belong to the Lord I tell you that
[15:38] doesn't make me feel angry it makes me
[15:40] feel
[15:41] relieved I'm his and he's mine and
[15:46] listen whatever he has started in my
[15:49] life whatever he has started in your
[15:51] life I assure you he is faithful and he
[15:54] is able to perfect to complete to finish
[15:59] everything that he has started just let
[16:01] him just let him have his complete sway
[16:06] in your life one of the ways that you
[16:08] and I can discover what God's pattern is
[16:12] what his uh standard of measurement is
[16:14] for our life is to not only look to the
[16:17] word of God but we need to find the
[16:20] place of getting in the spirit and you
[16:23] know to get in the spirit means to to
[16:26] cut off your uh your uh
[16:30] um the Consciousness I'm going to word
[16:32] it uh carefully here the Consciousness
[16:35] the connection that you have to your
[16:37] environment a and that usually comes
[16:40] first by the five senses what you see
[16:42] what you hear smell taste and so forth
[16:46] um we need to quiet that down we need to
[16:49] quieten that we need to to to uh find a
[16:54] place that secret place with God where
[16:57] we are not distracted by what we see and
[16:59] what we hear and what we smell what we
[17:01] taste and what we touch the the inner
[17:04] chamber the secret place the place of
[17:07] the stairs The Hidden Garden of the Lord
[17:10] the closet that Jesus spoke about in the
[17:13] newer Covenant that place where we steal
[17:16] away and pray where we pull ourselves
[17:20] into the into the closet get on our
[17:22] knees and we just make a tabernacle
[17:25] before God we're too busy folks we're
[17:27] too busy in our life life we're too busy
[17:29] at work we're too busy with our family
[17:32] we're too busy in in entertaining
[17:34] ourselves we need to find the time to be
[17:38] alone with the Lord and it's in that
[17:41] place where we are not being stimulated
[17:44] by our environment we're being
[17:46] stimulated by the spirit of God we're
[17:50] actually being transformed From the
[17:53] Inside Out uh in order for Moses to get
[17:57] above his circumstances what were his
[17:59] circumstances he was leading two million
[18:02] grumbling griping complaining murmuring
[18:05] hard-headed stubborn people he was
[18:08] trying to lead them and pastored them
[18:10] and Shepherd them right after they had
[18:12] come out of Egyptian slavery so he's not
[18:15] only dealing with two million
[18:17] hard-headed people he's do dealing with
[18:19] two million people who have a slave
[18:21] mentality a people who haven't yet
[18:24] learned what it means to be free in in
[18:27] in God to be free in the spirit so he's
[18:31] trying to lead them and direct them and
[18:33] he's hearing they're groaning and
[18:34] they're moaning and they're complaining
[18:36] he must have been crazy he must have
[18:38] felt like he he needed a nerve pill or
[18:40] something but instead he heeded the
[18:43] wooing of the spirit of God in Exodus 24
[18:48] verse 16 and 18 and the glory of the
[18:51] Lord Abode upon Mount SII and the cloud
[18:54] over uh the cloud covered it for six
[18:57] days and the seventh day he called unto
[19:00] Moses out of the midst of the cloud and
[19:03] the sight of the glory of the Lord was
[19:06] like devouring fire on the top of the
[19:09] mount in the eyes of the children of
[19:11] Israel and Moses went into the midst of
[19:14] the cloud and got him up into the mount
[19:17] and Moses was in the mount 40 days and
[19:20] 40 nights I'm not suggesting that all of
[19:22] you can spend 40 days and 40 nights with
[19:25] the Lord but I am suggesting that if you
[19:28] want to discover uh the Heavenly pattern
[19:31] for how things ought to be conducted
[19:34] here on the earth you're going to have
[19:36] to get in the glory Cloud you're going
[19:38] to have to get in the spirit you're
[19:40] going to have to go up you're going to
[19:42] have to move up and Revelation chapter 4
[19:45] gives us that great invitation that was
[19:47] given to John as he was in the spirit on
[19:50] the Lord's day and he heard this voice
[19:52] that said come up higher I want to show
[19:54] you something oh listen to me people of
[19:58] God friend hear me now we need to find
[20:01] that invitation we need to hear it and
[20:04] we need to obey it come up forget about
[20:07] your circumstances right now forget
[20:09] about your debt forget about your
[20:11] marriage woes forget about the the
[20:14] struggles of your family set a moment
[20:16] aside right now to come up with me into
[20:19] the spirit of the Lord let the anointing
[20:21] of God come down over you in your home
[20:24] right now let the presence of the Lord
[20:26] begin to move over you as you worship
[20:30] him as you give him praise as you give
[20:32] him glory as you give him honor shut off
[20:36] that that uh ever constant grinding mind
[20:40] you know the that where thoughts are
[20:41] just dashing and dashing and dashing
[20:44] sometimes we get wore out by our own
[20:46] thoughts see if you can find a place of
[20:49] Praise see if you can find a place of
[20:51] prayer where all of that becomes quiet
[20:55] and you you listen to hear the still
[20:59] small voice of God because it's in that
[21:02] moment that he wants to reveal to you
[21:06] his pattern for your life his pattern
[21:09] his his idea his desire for how he wants
[21:13] to work in you when he met with Moses he
[21:17] told him see that you make all things
[21:20] according to the pattern his pattern
[21:24] God's pattern God had a lot of ideas
[21:26] about a lot of things he had an idea
[21:29] about how long the tent pegs were
[21:32] supposed to be in the Tabernacle he gave
[21:34] them dimensions for the very pegs that
[21:38] you hold the tent down in the wind and
[21:40] in the wilderness Moses could not have
[21:43] built the Tabernacle uh the way he
[21:46] wanted to or even the easiest way he
[21:48] thought that it could be built and then
[21:51] asked God to come down and approve it it
[21:53] had to be built God's way by his design
[21:56] and by his measurements I hope you can
[21:58] hear me that's what's happened in the
[22:00] church World we've built a church we've
[22:02] made a structure we've done it the way
[22:05] we thought it ought to be or the way
[22:07] that was easiest to do and then we're
[22:09] saying Lord come bless us oh come down
[22:12] and be with us come down and be among us
[22:14] and you know what God is saying he's
[22:16] saying I can't bless your mess I can't
[22:20] bless it because I didn't Inspire it I
[22:23] can't bless it because it didn't
[22:25] originate in my plan it didn't originate
[22:28] with me it's like it's like uh uh the
[22:32] the the Apostle Paul speaking to the
[22:34] Galatians oh foolish Galatians who has
[22:37] Bewitched you you you started off in the
[22:40] spirit and now you think you can finish
[22:42] in the flesh what was started in the
[22:45] spirit oh friend this is what the church
[22:48] has done we have gotten so far away from
[22:51] God's holy book from living a Sanctified
[22:54] and separate life we have lived the way
[22:57] we wanted to live and we've asked God to
[23:00] come and smile to approve it and we
[23:03] think somehow in fact I hate to say it
[23:06] but we deceived ourselves at times to
[23:08] think that God is pleased with us when
[23:11] we're doing the very opposite of what he
[23:14] has revealed to us that he wants us to
[23:16] do in his word I don't mean to condemn I
[23:19] don't mean to I don't mean to preach
[23:21] down at you I just tell you it's so late
[23:25] I'm not talking about uh the the time of
[23:28] the broad
[23:29] it's getting late too it'll soon be time
[23:30] to pray for you I'm talking about out
[23:33] there I'm talking about in the world
[23:35] it's getting very very late it's getting
[23:38] very nigh time for the remnant bride to
[23:42] rise and shine for our light has come
[23:45] and if we're going to rise and shine and
[23:48] we're going to to step up or grow up
[23:50] into the stature of the perfect man
[23:53] we're going to have to do it quickly
[23:56] because time is running out for for us
[23:58] to be formed into His Image God's
[24:02] meticulous I think I've established that
[24:04] in three broadcasts now that God has a
[24:07] pattern Moses had to go up into the
[24:09] glory Cloud into the divine presence to
[24:13] be able to see the pattern even today it
[24:16] has to come by Revelation it's not by
[24:19] following rules it's not by following
[24:21] Church orders what it's about is letting
[24:25] the holy spirit of God break this word
[24:28] down we could say I mentioned that we
[24:30] often use the analogy of food when we're
[24:33] talking about the word because it's
[24:35] nourishment to us uh then we could call
[24:37] it the digestive process the process by
[24:41] which the holy spirit of God breaks the
[24:43] word down for us and shows us how to
[24:48] apply it in our own individual lives
[24:51] because we are being measured I want you
[24:54] to just picture me with a measuring
[24:56] stick over my head or a measure over my
[24:59] head because God is measuring his people
[25:03] and in our strength in our power we
[25:06] could never measure up with our good
[25:08] works we could never measure up but as
[25:11] we surrender to the Holy Spirit as we
[25:13] surrender to the work of God in our
[25:15] lives then we come to a place where
[25:18] where where when he looks at us he sees
[25:21] a finished work in us if we could only
[25:24] begin to understand what was
[25:26] accomplished on our behalf if we can
[25:29] yield to it so that we can appropriate
[25:31] it when he died on Calvary when he paid
[25:35] that price with his own life's blood
[25:37] everything I need to be perfect in God's
[25:41] sight was made available to me by the
[25:43] blood everything I need to be righteous
[25:46] to be holy to be set apart in God's
[25:49] sight was made available to me by the
[25:51] finished work of the Cross but if I keep
[25:53] trying to do it on my own by my own
[25:57] standard by my own opinions I will never
[26:00] fully access the finished work I will
[26:04] never fully be able to appropriate the
[26:07] power of the blood of the crucified lamb
[26:11] in my own life it's a perfect
[26:14] balance again I've said on three of
[26:17] these sessions that it is not uh we are
[26:20] not saved by works we are saved unto
[26:23] Works The Works follow when our lives
[26:27] have truly Been Changed by the power of
[26:30] God the good works will follow because
[26:33] we want to be obedient to him in all
[26:35] things I want to pray for you right now
[26:38] that the struggling in your soul will
[26:41] cease and that you will come to perfect
[26:43] peace of what he has done in your life
[26:46] and you'll begin to let the spirit of
[26:48] God live through you father I thank you
[26:51] for this opportunity that you have given
[26:53] me to teach today and I thank you that I
[26:56] can join my faith with the faith of the

[27:07] the Roaring and the voices and the
[27:10] turmoil of this life I pray that you
[27:13] will bring peace and quiet to it right
[27:15] now and that my friends wherever they
[27:19] may be would begin to hear your still
[27:21] Small Voice in their lives and that you
[27:24] would come and live through them that
[27:27] your anointing Ing and your power and
[27:29] your character would begin to flow
[27:32] through them so that they could be at
[27:34] peace so they could be quiet Lord teach
[27:36] us how to fully appropriate the precious
[27:40] blood that you shed on our behalf and
[27:43] while I'm praying I'm going to ask that
[27:45] you release healing to the sick and the
[27:48] affirmed you are still a god of Miracles
[27:51] and I ask you right now to send your
[27:54] healing virtue into the nations of the
[27:58] world right now and break the power of
[28:02] sickness and disease and we will give
