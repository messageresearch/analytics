[37:58] prayer all over the building we want to
[38:01] remember our sister Flo she is not
[38:03] feeling well today congestion and losing
[38:06] her voice we want to ask the Lord to
[38:08] touch her would you remember Sister
[38:10] Terry Lawler to the Lord that God will
[38:13] touch her sister Gert was sick is doing
[38:16] some better and now Sister Terry is sick
[38:18] let's ask the Lord to touch them they
[38:20] didn't want to spread it they just and
[38:23] and so I appreciate that but we want the
[38:25] Lord to raise them up uh I had a note
[38:28] today from my friend Jeff rug Sager's
[38:30] wife Amanda she sent me a note this
[38:33] morning and said that they had taken the
[38:34] ventilator off and so far he's breathing
[38:37] on his own thank you Lord this is really
[38:38] a miracle and would you keep praying for
[38:41] him that God will continue to help him I
[38:44] want us to pray for Smith Station our
[38:47] community and I want us to pray for uh
[38:49] the family of our late mayor there is a
[38:52] shadow that will hang over this
[38:54] community for some time over this awful
[38:57] tragedy that has taken place a great uh
[39:01] Scandal ending in a tragedy and there
[39:04] are people on all sides of this issue
[39:07] who are hurting some are angry some are
[39:10] bitter and uh my heart goes out to his
[39:13] wife and children today that God would
[39:15] reach out to them and comfort them plus
[39:18] he was a pastor of the First Baptist
[39:20] Church in Phoenix City so there's a
[39:22] whole Congregation of people who are
[39:23] hurting for many reasons this morning
[39:26] it's the least that we can do as being a
[39:29] part of this community is to pray for
[39:31] all of them that God will have
[39:33] mercy if if something like this can get
[39:37] through our prayers and our righteous
[39:40] testimony in this community if something
[39:43] like this if something this dark can
[39:45] break through then I have to believe
[39:48] that it is absolutely the enemy who's
[39:51] working against what God has ordained
[39:55] for this County yes I have to believe
[39:57] that it's the enemy working over time to
[40:00] steal the prophetic Destiny of this
[40:03] place and we're going to contend against
[40:05] that spirit and believe that uh
[40:08] righteousness and Purity and Holiness
[40:10] will prevail but I will I will tell you
[40:13] this there is no true Holiness or true
[40:18] righteousness outside the revealed
[40:20] word I mean that is the truth you you
[40:24] can't you can't fake it till you make
[40:27] no it it takes the revelation of the
[40:30] word of God to deliver you from those
[40:32] kinds of things and that's not going to
[40:34] happen in denominations that's only
[40:37] going to happen where the pure word is
[40:39] is is lived is preached is sung is
[40:43] testified and is lived so let's pray
[40:46] that God will use this as a great
[40:48] opportunity to shift this whole area oh
[40:51] I'm believing for it yes amen would you
[40:54] stand once again as we prepare to go to
[40:56] prayer
[40:59] he's my Lord there is no other
[41:02] one he's my

[57:18] tomorrow is the anniversary where he
[57:21] said little fishy I give you your life
[57:24] and it and God did exactly that and it
[57:27] speaks to us of the Resurrection voice
[57:30] the voice of the Resurrection that's in
[57:32] the bride of Christ and she's going to
[57:35] call with her bridegroom she's going to
[57:37] call for the resurrection and it's
[57:39] sooner than what we have believed it's
[57:42] coming it certainly is coming then on

[58:54] is very much alive would you say that
[58:56] it's not all finished yet and uh you

[59:10] but God is good he was good in World War

[59:51] sister hadri moser's home and uh uh God
[59:55] gave her the salvation of her boys right
[59:58] before her eyes that reminds us that the
[1:00:01] bride has Authority by the spoken word
[1:00:04] to release the spirit of conviction you
[1:00:07] may not be flowing in the fullness of
[1:00:09] that Authority but it's coming and

[1:00:18] I leave
[1:00:19] here you say how's that going to work
[1:00:22] all it takes is the spirit of conviction

[1:00:26] authority to release that I'm looking
[1:00:28] forward to the fullness of that Amelia

[1:02:21] Facebook they don't have time they they

[1:02:27] see what you had for dinner when you was
[1:02:28] on vacation they are in the presence of
[1:02:32] the Lord I know we do those things for
[1:02:35] us I get it but just don't get to
[1:02:37] believe in it you can do it for you but
[1:02:40] don't get to believe in what you put
[1:02:41] there because they're busy around the
[1:02:45] throne gathered with the lamb strolling
[1:02:48] with the lamb how many of you are
[1:02:50] looking forward to strolling with the
[1:02:52] lamb yourself amen I am
[1:02:55] let me make just a few announcements and
[1:02:57] that is that next Sunday afternoon after
[1:03:00] the service we will gather Under the
[1:03:02] Tent and we will celebrate Thanksgiving
[1:03:05] as a body of
[1:03:07] Believers um we are celebrating
[1:03:09] Thanksgiving every day of Our Lives we
[1:03:11] must we should but we just don't eat
[1:03:15] like that every day of Our Lives we must
[1:03:17] not but uh we're going to be having a
[1:03:20] wonderful time and we're doing it one
[1:03:22] week early uh for a couple of reasons
[1:03:26] one so that I get to be here because
[1:03:27] I'll be missing the next Sunday and the
[1:03:30] other thing is hoping that one week will
[1:03:32] make it a little bit warmer and as I
[1:03:34] left today remember how cold it was last
[1:03:37] year um but as I left to come today I
[1:03:40] thought boy wouldn't today have been a
[1:03:42] beautiful day to do it but we have to we
[1:03:45] have to cook we have to get it ready and
[1:03:47] didn't have time to do that so next
[1:03:49] Sunday I want to add to what brother gy
[1:03:52] said by saying that if you you want to
[1:03:54] continue to designate an offering every
[1:03:57] month or whenever you feel to uh either
[1:04:00] as building fund or Campground those
[1:04:03] funds are together and you can do that
[1:04:06] in fact since the building has been paid
[1:04:09] off we have taken everything that has
[1:04:11] been designated building fund or
[1:04:13] Campground and put it in a separate
[1:04:15] account so that it will be there when we
[1:04:17] start making improvements or when we
[1:04:19] start building the next or doing
[1:04:20] whatever it is that God wants us to do
[1:04:23] so if you want to kind of do that it
[1:04:25] will be a buffer for for that it'll be
[1:04:28] there when we start the process because
[1:04:30] sometimes it takes a little oil to
[1:04:31] grease the wheel when you start to do
[1:04:33] something the next project and as long
[1:04:36] as we can do it as long as we can do it
[1:04:39] we will make sure that it goes into a
[1:04:41] separate place so that it can be used
[1:04:43] and wouldn't that be wonderful for me to
[1:04:45] come and announce in a in a month or so
[1:04:47] that the fund has grown to a to an
[1:04:49] amount that would be substantial and you
[1:04:51] think my I didn't even you know didn't
[1:04:53] realize that it was doing that um and we
[1:04:56] thank God for that and of course you
[1:04:59] know as soon as the bills as soon as the
[1:05:01] big debt is paid off the church building
[1:05:04] that's behind us but you know life is
[1:05:07] life and the next month's water bill was
[1:05:10] over
[1:05:11] $1,000 because of the leak and so
[1:05:15] expenses are still here so I appreciate
[1:05:18] what brother gy said we paid it I did I
[1:05:20] thought I was going to make payments but
[1:05:21] I didn't have to we we paid it and we're
[1:05:24] thankful to be able to do that
[1:05:28] well I'm thankful to be able to do it I
[1:05:31] wasn't thankful to have to do
[1:05:34] it I think they ought to show a little
[1:05:36] Mercy
[1:05:37] myself nobody drank that water bathed in
[1:05:40] that water watered their Garden did they
[1:05:43] none of that it just run down the side
[1:05:45] of the Hill we're so thankful that the
[1:05:47] brothers found it when they did and
[1:05:49] repaired it um Brother David man I know
[1:05:53] that you don't never do anything for
[1:05:55] thanks I have learned that about you but
[1:05:58] Brother David was streaming a service
[1:06:00] recently where I was lamenting and
[1:06:03] mentioning a leak and I want you all to
[1:06:06] know he came to my house two times this
[1:06:08] week and took care of it and I
[1:06:10] appreciate it very very
[1:06:13] [Applause]
[1:06:16] much one
[1:06:18] other one other thing I want to mention
[1:06:20] and that is without any expense to the
[1:06:24] Church some of the mothers and mothers
[1:06:27] to be got together and pulled some uh of
[1:06:31] their finances and their resources and
[1:06:34] their extra this or that and and last
[1:06:37] week they remodeled both nurseries
[1:06:40] they're going to do the bathrooms next
[1:06:42] uh for the nurseries but they did that
[1:06:45] as a gift to the body and I think that
[1:06:47] is absolutely outstanding so all of you
[1:06:51] who for the last many years have called
[1:06:54] it purple nursery and yellow Nursery no
[1:06:56] one is going to know what you're talking
[1:06:58] about because there is no longer a
[1:07:00] purple Nursery or a yellow Nursery they
[1:07:03] are more muted and modern all
[1:07:07] right now let me tell you that uh we
[1:07:11] need those
[1:07:12] nurseries we've got some babies coming
[1:07:15] we're thinking we might have to knock
[1:07:17] out a wall and put an extension on the
[1:07:20] nursery I'm just
[1:07:22] kidding
[1:07:24] because God is growing the
[1:07:26] church in the in the baby in the baby
[1:07:30] department so let me remind you those of
[1:07:32] you that don't know the larger
[1:07:34] Nursery that used to be referred to as
[1:07:37] the purple Nursery when it was purple
[1:07:40] that Nursery is for nursing mothers only
[1:07:44] small children who are nursing small
[1:07:46] babies who are nursing and mothers who
[1:07:48] are nursing no
[1:07:50] brothers no men got it no men in that
[1:07:53] way one that's for the sisters and those
[1:07:56] who are nursing babies and we're fixing
[1:07:58] to have a crop of them or bottle them
[1:08:01] bottle feeding them or whatever they're
[1:08:02] doing and then the other little Nursery
[1:08:04] that's not going to be big enough we
[1:08:06] realize that is going to have to do is
[1:08:08] for the Toddlers and for if a dad needs
[1:08:11] to go in or whatever and help and so
[1:08:13] forth but we don't ever want there to be
[1:08:14] any uh uncomfortableness I was told that
[1:08:18] on occasion some mothers had had to go
[1:08:20] to the bathroom to nurse because there
[1:08:21] were men or or boys or something in out
[1:08:24] I don't want that at all I want them to
[1:08:26] have a a a safe place and a comfortable
[1:08:30] place to take care of the babies once we
[1:08:32] get them here amen isn't that
[1:08:36] wonderful praise the Lord Josiah come

[1:10:19] them turn in your Bible to uh the the
[1:10:23] Psalms let's go to Psalm
[1:10:26] 341 and then to Psalm
[1:10:31] 844 our subject this morning is becoming
[1:10:36] the
[1:10:37] embodiment of
[1:10:39] Praise becoming the
[1:10:42] embodiment of Praise I love the songs
[1:10:46] that were sung this morning and the
[1:10:48] words that
[1:10:50] so uh
[1:10:52] amen what was going to be preached this
[1:10:55] morning we were singing he is enthroned
[1:10:58] in our praise and you know that is we
[1:11:01] know that we know it we understand it
[1:11:04] we've read it in the book but it's
[1:11:06] something to really keep us mindful we
[1:11:09] always want him to be on his
[1:11:11] throne we always want him to be Lord we
[1:11:14] want to let him be Lord if he's not Lord
[1:11:17] of all he's not Lord at all and so by
[1:11:20] being mindful of Our Praise we become
[1:11:23] mindful of letting him be Lord over
[1:11:26] every situation in our life Psalm 34:1 I
[1:11:30] Will Bless The Lord at all times his
[1:11:37] praise shall
[1:11:39] continually be in my mouth Psalm 844
[1:11:44] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[1:11:49] they will be still praising thee
[1:11:54] Sila which means pause and think on
[1:11:57] these things Hebrews 13:15 in the
[1:12:01] Amplified is the last that we will stand
[1:12:04] for through him Christ I don't I don't
[1:12:08] know
[1:12:09] exactly what that reference is but I'm
[1:12:12] reading out of the Amplified through
[1:12:14] through him Christ our high priest
[1:12:19] therefore let us
[1:12:21] constantly and at all all times offer up
[1:12:26] to God a
[1:12:29] sacrifice of praise which is the fruit
[1:12:34] of lips that
[1:12:36] thankfully acknowledge and confess and
[1:12:42] glorify his name I want to read that
[1:12:44] again through him Christ our high priest
[1:12:48] therefore let us constantly and at all
[1:12:52] times offer up to God a sacrifice of
[1:12:58] praise which is the fruit of lips that
[1:13:02] thankfully acknowledge and confess and
[1:13:07] glorify his name I'm going to read one
[1:13:11] more habc chapter 3 if you'll go there

[1:13:30] although the Fig Tree shall not blossom
[1:13:34] neither shall fruit be in the vines the
[1:13:38] labor of the olives shall fail and the
[1:13:40] fields shall yield no meat the flock
[1:13:44] shall be cut off from the fold and there
[1:13:48] shall be no herd in the
[1:13:51] Stalls yet

[1:14:29] walk upon mine high
[1:14:34] places every person is appointed some
[1:14:38] high places in their spiritual life and
[1:14:41] God wants to equip you for walking

[1:15:06] who you have called us to be you have
[1:15:10] called us to be praised you have caused
[1:15:14] us and called us to be worship that's
[1:15:18] who we are it's part of the reason why
[1:15:22] we are here we ask you to help us today
[1:15:26] to be able to concentrate and focus on
[1:15:30] your word to be reminded of both the
[1:15:33] privilege of praise and the
[1:15:35] responsibility of Praise it's not just

[1:16:24] amen you may be seated praise is more
[1:16:29] than music it's more than singing Praise
[1:16:34] is a powerful weapon if you always want
[1:16:37] to win in your life you have to
[1:16:41] cultivate an attitude of gratitude if
[1:16:46] you always want to win in every battle
[1:16:49] of your life you have to cultivate and
[1:16:53] attitude of praise and of worship I want
[1:16:57] to share with you a quote from Mrs
[1:17:00] Francis metf I don't know if you are
[1:17:04] familiar with that name but she was a a
[1:17:09] prayer meeting leader she led a prayer
[1:17:13] meeting in in Idlewood uh
[1:17:17] California and up in the kind of in the
[1:17:19] mountainous regions just north of the of
[1:17:22] the high desert of
[1:17:24] Lancaster and for many years in the 50s
[1:17:28] and early 60s there was a group of women
[1:17:32] who met together in prayer and their
[1:17:35] experiences are documented in several
[1:17:38] recorded testimonies the things that God
[1:17:42] did among them no church no Pastor just
[1:17:46] women who wanted to be useful in the
[1:17:49] kingdom of God no gossip can you imagine
[1:17:53] in that no long drawn out prayer
[1:17:55] requests camouflaged as
[1:17:59] gossip our gossip camouflaged as long
[1:18:03] informational prayer request they just
[1:18:06] came to lift up God they come to be used
[1:18:08] of the Lord and uh I met a man one time
[1:18:12] in Tucson Who as a young boy was invited
[1:18:15] to attend the meeting and the night that
[1:18:18] he was there he told me with his own
[1:18:20] mouth I have no reason to doubt his
[1:18:23] testimony he's no longer alive but I
[1:18:26] have no reason to doubt his testimony he
[1:18:28] said that in the middle of the room
[1:18:31] while they were praying a door appeared
[1:18:34] every eye in that group saw that door
[1:18:37] and heard the voice that said come
[1:18:39] through
[1:18:40] here now what would you
[1:18:42] do would you get up and try to get
[1:18:44] through the door or would you be so
[1:18:47] terrified you couldn't get up out of
[1:18:49] your seat somebody said I don't believe
[1:18:51] in things like that doesn't matter what
[1:18:53] you believe in it doesn't keep it from
[1:18:55] being real the Supernatural is
[1:18:58] real I'm telling you it's real demons
[1:19:02] are real but so are
[1:19:04] angels so don't spend all your time
[1:19:06] focusing on demons spend a little of
[1:19:08] that time focusing on the other host
[1:19:11] there are more for us there's more
[1:19:14] forces fighting for you than there are
[1:19:16] against you somebody said well there
[1:19:19] 10,000 time 10,000 demon spirit all
[1:19:22] right there's hundreds of thousands
[1:19:23] times hundreds of thousands Heavenly
[1:19:26] hosts that are fighting for you if our
[1:19:30] spiritual eyes could be open we would
[1:19:33] see the room even now filled with
[1:19:36] creatures created to assist the body of
[1:19:39] Christ in this hour they don't all look
[1:19:42] the same they don't all function the
[1:19:45] same but God gives them to us when we
[1:19:48] need them and you know when I need them
[1:19:51] all all the time I don't ever dismiss my
[1:19:56] angels I don't ever send them home for
[1:19:59] Furlow I don't ever tell them they can
[1:20:02] have a break I need them with me 24
[1:20:05] hours a day they take a lot of blows
[1:20:08] that I don't even know are headed in my
[1:20:10] direction they stop a lot of things that
[1:20:13] I don't even know are going around in
[1:20:15] the realm of the spirit I'm thankful for
[1:20:18] the heavenly host for every demon God's
[1:20:21] got a dozen Angels or more who know how
[1:20:24] to deal with that
[1:20:25] imp and they are sent to cooperate with
[1:20:30] us they are here to serve us they are
[1:20:34] here to minister to us they are here to
[1:20:38] help us do what God has called us to do
[1:20:42] we don't pray to angels and we don't
[1:20:45] command Angels the Lord is the commander
[1:20:49] of the Heavenly Host he sends the angels
[1:20:52] it's all right to say father would you
[1:20:55] send your angels into such of a
[1:20:57] situation you're asking you're
[1:20:59] petitioning you're requesting I don't
[1:21:02] believe it's our job to tell what Angel
[1:21:04] to go where and to do what and so forth
[1:21:06] God is a big God but I want you to be
[1:21:09] aware of the fact that every time you
[1:21:12] are aware that something is fighting
[1:21:14] against you you ought to immediately
[1:21:17] remember that with every attack against
[1:21:20] you there is a Heavenly ho
[1:21:23] raised up to meet that challenge stay
[1:21:26] out of their
[1:21:28] way anybody with me stay out of their
[1:21:32] way they don't really need your help
[1:21:35] they just need you moving with
[1:21:38] them they can get the job
[1:21:42] done these
[1:21:45] ladies were were uh their like I said
[1:21:49] their testimonies were written James
[1:21:51] Mahoney
[1:21:53] uh wrote ladies of gold is that what it
[1:21:56] was called he wrote two
[1:21:59] volumes uh some of the things that they
[1:22:02] saw and some of the things they
[1:22:04] experienced in prayer and I know that
[1:22:06] happened outside of our of our camp but
[1:22:10] it happened in the 50s when everything
[1:22:13] that we hold
[1:22:14] dear in our camp was taking place and I
[1:22:18] wouldn't I wouldn't doubt but what God
[1:22:20] was using those women to help clear
[1:22:23] things and to push things back so that
[1:22:26] he could do what he needed to do in the
[1:22:28] earth during that time I want to read
[1:22:30] you two quotes I don't feel at all
[1:22:33] uncomfortable to do it from from Mrs
[1:22:35] Francis medf she wrote in the 1950s
[1:22:39] recently the Lord whispered these words
[1:22:43] to me I want you to become praise
[1:22:50] personified how this thought took took
[1:22:53] possession of me to become an
[1:22:57] embodiment of Praise in the earth oh
[1:23:01] listen a
[1:23:03] temple filled with his
[1:23:06] glory
[1:23:08] me me somebody said that was the Lord
[1:23:12] speaking to her it was indeed and the
[1:23:15] reason why she shared it is because she
[1:23:17] recognized it wasn't just her calling
[1:23:20] amen she wanted you and I to understand
[1:23:23] that we could also identify with that
[1:23:25] calling to become praise personified she
[1:23:29] said how this thought took possession of
[1:23:33] me is there anybody in this room you've
[1:23:35] ever had a thought a revelation
[1:23:37] something that was spoken in the spirit
[1:23:39] that took a hold of you that possessed
[1:23:41] you you couldn't get it off your mind
[1:23:44] you couldn't ignore it you couldn't
[1:23:45] dismiss it that's what she's saying this
[1:23:48] thought I want you to become praise
[1:23:51] personified it took possession of me to
[1:23:54] become an embodiment of Praise in the
[1:24:00] earth that that's going to require
[1:24:04] something I'm going to
[1:24:06] preach I'm going to preach whether you
[1:24:08] help me or not it's going to require
[1:24:11] something of you it's going to require
[1:24:14] something of me if I become the
[1:24:16] embodiment of Praise in the Earth the
[1:24:19] first thing I want you to remember is
[1:24:21] bitter and Sweet Water amen cannot come
[1:24:25] out of the same
[1:24:26] sistern I I want you to remember that
[1:24:29] that this is a little
[1:24:32] member but it boasteth much and it can
[1:24:35] get you and I in a whole lot of trouble
[1:24:38] the Bible tells us that ships you know
[1:24:41] they have
[1:24:43] Rudders there they ways of controlling
[1:24:45] the ship uh but all this little thing
[1:24:48] right here it's hard for Man by himself
[1:24:52] yes to tame this thing I say by himself
[1:24:56] because the only way it can really be
[1:24:57] tamed is by the help of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:00] you've got to make the discipline for
[1:25:03] yourself and you're never I'm never me
[1:25:06] let me just preach about me I'm never I
[1:25:08] am never going to become the embodiment
[1:25:11] of Praise in the earth as long as
[1:25:14] there's bitter water and sweet water
[1:25:16] coming out of my mouth I'm going to have
[1:25:18] to arrest my
[1:25:20] criticisms I'm going to have to arrest
[1:25:22] my
[1:25:25] judgments I'm going to have to arrest my
[1:25:30] prejudices and I'm going to have to let
[1:25:32] the Lord help me
[1:25:34] control oh how powerful this is how
[1:25:37] powerful this is when I yield my tongue
[1:25:40] to the leadership of the Holy Spirit I
[1:25:42] have the ability to
[1:25:44] create what is not in
[1:25:47] existence when I yield my tongue to the
[1:25:50] enemy I then operate in the ability to
[1:25:56] destroy what I have
[1:25:59] created now how terrible is the thought
[1:26:02] that I could spend a portion of my life
[1:26:05] building up something by yielding my
[1:26:07] mouth to the King of Kings to the Holy
[1:26:10] Ghost and then in 10
[1:26:13] minutes or less destroy with the same
[1:26:18] instrument no wonder the Apostle said if
[1:26:20] I my if I become a Castaway if I myself
[1:26:25] should become a Castaway I do all that I
[1:26:28] know to do and yet in a
[1:26:31] moment refus to trust the Lord like ASA
[1:26:34] the king who trusted the Lord with
[1:26:36] everything except the Affliction in his
[1:26:40] foot then he leaned on the arms of man
[1:26:42] and the Bible said and then he died he
[1:26:44] slept with his fathers because he was
[1:26:46] always trusting in the lord always
[1:26:49] believing that God could deliver him in
[1:26:51] every situation ation and then all of a
[1:26:53] sudden instead of running to God as his
[1:26:57] resource I'm preaching this morning
[1:27:00] instead of running to God as his
[1:27:02] resource he leaned on the arms of Flesh
[1:27:04] and died an Affliction that was no more
[1:27:07] than than than what we would call
[1:27:12] tendonitis acute achilles tendonitis
[1:27:15] some of you know I know what that's
[1:27:17] about that's all it was it had no reason
[1:27:20] to take his life
[1:27:22] but he leaned on the arm of Flesh in the
[1:27:25] moment when he had always gone to God so
[1:27:28] it's very very possible that we can
[1:27:30] destroy what we
[1:27:32] build we cooperate with God we yield our
[1:27:36] tongue to the Holy Spirit and we build
[1:27:38] up something or somebody and in a moment
[1:27:41] of
[1:27:43] anger I'm going to
[1:27:45] preach I know there's some V few
[1:27:47] visitors here but I'm going to
[1:27:49] preach come on Amen than and then in a
[1:27:53] few moments of time let the enemy rise
[1:27:55] up in
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:58] me destroy what God's been using me to
[1:28:01] build now how many of you really realize
[1:28:04] In This Moment how easy that really
[1:28:07] would
[1:28:07] be it's happened brother I know I know
[1:28:10] so
[1:28:11] many that that are walking right now in
[1:28:14] the in the Lion's
[1:28:17] lay where where there is nothing but but
[1:28:20] bleach bones
[1:28:22] of Revival's
[1:28:24] past they spend their entire Ministry
[1:28:27] now only bragging about what God did 30
[1:28:30] years
[1:28:31] ago their testimonies are all
[1:28:35] ancient they're right they're good
[1:28:37] they're holy they're precious but where
[1:28:40] is the god of Elijah
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:43] today you see I found myself in that
[1:28:46] Lion's liar one time and I looked around
[1:28:49] and I saw those bleached bones of Rev
[1:28:52] ral's past of movements past of what God
[1:28:55] had done in the past and I realized that
[1:28:58] somebody had let down the bar and
[1:29:00] allowed the enemy to so gnaw
[1:29:03] away at what God wanted to accomplish
[1:29:06] that there was nothing left but just
[1:29:08] tattered pieces of skin and bones that
[1:29:10] had been left over from past real holy
[1:29:14] things real powerful things really
[1:29:18] anointed things that God had done
[1:29:22] you better hear me folks you better hear
[1:29:25] me today if you and I are ever going to
[1:29:28] become the embodiment of Praise we're
[1:29:31] going to have to watch our
[1:29:33] tongue we're going to have to watch the
[1:29:35] words that come out of our mouth there's
[1:29:39] life or death in this tongue we can
[1:29:42] build and destroy in the same moment
[1:29:45] with this tongue hello so that's the
[1:29:48] first thing we've got to deal with if
[1:29:50] I'm going to become the embodiment of
[1:29:52] Praise then I can't curse and
[1:29:57] bless I've got to choose my
[1:30:00] way I've got to choose my way come on
[1:30:04] now I can't praise and
[1:30:07] complain I can't be thankful and
[1:30:10] grumbling at the same time murmuring 40
[1:30:13] years 40
[1:30:15] years 40 years that's right you know I
[1:30:19] had an experience recently that I
[1:30:21] haven't shared
[1:30:22] but I saw us again in the spirit coming
[1:30:24] to Kadesh
[1:30:26] barnea and I said to the people in this
[1:30:29] experience this time we don't ever have
[1:30:33] to go around this mountain again and I
[1:30:36] looked up and there was a small group of
[1:30:38] us that had already gone
[1:30:43] ahead I called to them
[1:30:46] whoa whoa what are you doing what are
[1:30:49] you doing why are you leaving us ahead
[1:30:53] the Lord said we don't have to go around
[1:30:55] this mountain again it was like the it
[1:30:58] was like the
[1:30:59] shuffle they had done it so so often and
[1:31:02] for so long they had circled the
[1:31:05] mountain and they had taken another lap
[1:31:08] around the mountain that they thought
[1:31:09] well even though we're saying out to
[1:31:12] them you don't have to do it God said
[1:31:14] this is the crossing overtime this is
[1:31:17] time to possess the inheritance we don't
[1:31:19] have to take another lap in the desert
[1:31:21] but some were all the way up ahead and
[1:31:24] the experience ended I'm calling to them
[1:31:26] come back to us come back to us come
[1:31:29] back to us when I had that experience I
[1:31:31] realized that we were going to have to
[1:31:34] watch the
[1:31:35] signpost very very carefully we're going
[1:31:38] to have to watch what God is doing we're
[1:31:40] going to have to watch what God is
[1:31:42] saying we're going to have to cooperate
[1:31:44] with the Holy Ghost like never
[1:31:49] before or the enemy will divide us
[1:31:53] and he'll divide us and though we're all
[1:31:55] sincere I want you to understand though
[1:31:57] we're all
[1:31:59] sincere these people that were pulling
[1:32:01] away they weren't pulling away from us
[1:32:04] they were sincere they were just
[1:32:07] stuck they just couldn't accept I want
[1:32:10] to tell you something your attitude on
[1:32:13] while you wait come
[1:32:16] on your attitude while you wait on God
[1:32:20] your attitude
[1:32:22] on while you wait on God to bring his
[1:32:25] word to pass is vitally
[1:32:28] important for the measure of your
[1:32:30] promise for the measure of your
[1:32:35] Harvest if you wait and
[1:32:38] Grumble if you wait and
[1:32:41] murmur if you wait and make excuses for
[1:32:44] your
[1:32:45] life one day I'm going to serve him with
[1:32:47] everything I've got you don't get to
[1:32:49] choose that now is the time now is the
[1:32:54] acceptable hour to have a relationship
[1:32:56] with him I mean a personal relationship
[1:32:59] with him where your desire is to
[1:33:02] overcome and make it and your desire for
[1:33:05] those around you is that they also
[1:33:07] overcome and make
[1:33:09] it the day of gloating when someone else
[1:33:12] is stuck the day of gloating when
[1:33:15] someone else is having a struggle the
[1:33:17] day of gloating when someone else is
[1:33:19] spinning their wheel that day is over
[1:33:21] brother that day is over sister we've
[1:33:25] got to rejoice when others rejoice and
[1:33:27] weep when others weep we've got to
[1:33:30] realize that in order for the bride to
[1:33:32] become the embodiment of praise to
[1:33:35] release the creative word of God into
[1:33:38] the Earth to shift atmospheres I want
[1:33:41] you to know I feel very responsible for
[1:33:44] what's happened in this in this uh
[1:33:46] County I feel very responsible for
[1:33:50] what's happened I took it upon myself
[1:33:52] I'm not going to to uh belabor it until
[1:33:56] it brings me into depression no no I
[1:33:58] don't mean that but I truly believe that
[1:34:01] you and I can produce such an
[1:34:05] anointing with our
[1:34:07] praise with our amens with our worship
[1:34:11] that we bring a purity to this community
[1:34:15] we bring a purity to this County I
[1:34:18] realize the devil is wild and I realize
[1:34:21] he's going to take a hold of whoever
[1:34:22] will yield to him but I just can't stand
[1:34:25] the thought that on our what my
[1:34:29] watch my watch that kind of ugly sin
[1:34:34] could creep right in to our little
[1:34:36] Community uh with someone so respected a
[1:34:40] a and so and has done so many wonderful
[1:34:42] things for our community as a whole it
[1:34:45] it disturbs me it bothers me it has
[1:34:49] caused me to pray more it's caused me to
[1:34:51] be a little more sober it's caused me to
[1:34:53] want to be careful what I say about him
[1:34:56] about the situation about the things
[1:34:58] that happen I want to watch over my
[1:35:00] heart I want to stay on my lips I want
[1:35:03] to raise up to be who God has called us
[1:35:05] to be we are Watchmen of righteousness
[1:35:08] we have authority in the realm of the
[1:35:10] spirit over this
[1:35:12] place and in order to become the
[1:35:15] embodyment of Praise we're going to have
[1:35:17] to be
[1:35:18] careful I'm going to have to be careful
[1:35:21] what I
[1:35:22] think what I say how I criticize others
[1:35:27] come on I realize that the only True
[1:35:30] Deliverance in Satan's Eden is going to
[1:35:32] be where the revealed word is but I
[1:35:35] happen to believe the revealed word is
[1:35:36] in this
[1:35:38] house I happen to believe that the
[1:35:40] spirit of conviction ought to be so real
[1:35:43] in
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:45] here brother that we would be so quick
[1:35:48] to
[1:35:50] repent that we would be so quick a
[1:35:52] husband would be so quick to go to his
[1:35:54] wife a wife would be so quick to go to
[1:35:56] her husband to say honey I've been
[1:35:58] entertaining thoughts that are not of
[1:36:00] God and I just wanted you to know so
[1:36:02] that you'll pray for me we ought to have
[1:36:05] such an atmosphere here that Satan can't
[1:36:07] just come in walk down the aisle and sit
[1:36:09] right down among us and have himself a
[1:36:11] cup of tea we ought to be creating such
[1:36:14] an atmosphere here that the only thing
[1:36:16] an enemy could do would be cry out for
[1:36:18] help if a demon Spirit were to walk in
[1:36:20] this place I would want to have such an
[1:36:23] atmosphere here that he couldn't just
[1:36:24] Nestle in Among Us I would want him
[1:36:27] exposed and called
[1:36:35] out some of you don't know some of the
[1:36:38] things that have transpired here over
[1:36:39] the years but God has been good to
[1:36:42] us I discerned a spirit some years ago
[1:36:45] that had that had fallen on someone who
[1:36:47] had uh come and was coming quite regular
[1:36:50] at the time
[1:36:52] that so Disturbed me and so alarmed me
[1:36:55] that I went to prayer and I said Lord I
[1:36:58] want you to bring Deliverance to that
[1:37:00] man I want you to bring Deliverance to
[1:37:02] him I want you to give him another
[1:37:04] opportunity and another opportunity and
[1:37:06] another opportunity to have Deliverance
[1:37:08] because I'm very very concerned about
[1:37:11] the way that he watches the girls and
[1:37:13] especially the little girls I'm very
[1:37:15] very concerned about that and God began
[1:37:17] to deal with my heart and it wasn't what
[1:37:19] I wanted to do I wanted to pray him to
[1:37:21] the altar I wanted to pray him to help
[1:37:24] but instead my prayers put him out from
[1:37:26] the body and uh I didn't want to expose
[1:37:28] him in the hour I didn't want to go
[1:37:30] around and talk about him I didn't want
[1:37:32] people to change their minds so many
[1:37:34] people revered him and loved him and and
[1:37:36] and and liked him so much and wanted to
[1:37:38] fellowship with him and so I just left
[1:37:40] it at that but I could not be silent
[1:37:43] when it come to doing something about it
[1:37:45] in prayer I want us all to be so
[1:37:49] sensitive in this this hour because we
[1:37:53] need to understand that that evil has
[1:37:55] come to this
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:37:58] country I I know you saw where they
[1:38:01] where they captured someone arrested
[1:38:03] someone and uh trying someone who had
[1:38:07] come from from uh from the Palestinians
[1:38:10] who had come across the border there in
[1:38:12] Mexico and they found in investigating
[1:38:15] and talking to him that that it looks
[1:38:17] like there was a plot that was going to
[1:38:19] be made against Jewish people in our
[1:38:21] nation and they tell us that there's
[1:38:23] another between 7 and 10,000 on on
[1:38:27] Parade to the border right now maybe
[1:38:29] you've seen some of the of the aerial
[1:38:31] shots I have walking to the Border where
[1:38:34] every one of them will be
[1:38:35] processed every one of them will be
[1:38:37] given an opportunity except the Goda
[1:38:39] ways and the Goda ways are those who run
[1:38:42] across without any real permission who
[1:38:44] sneak across who pull away who don't get
[1:38:47] shot you know there are certain
[1:38:50] situations in certain Nations that would
[1:38:52] that would cost a man his life if he
[1:38:54] crossed a border and started
[1:38:57] running there there are certain
[1:38:59] situations and Nations that would say we
[1:39:01] can't afford we don't know what he's
[1:39:02] about but we can't afford to
[1:39:05] risk when there's a legal way we can't
[1:39:09] afford to let him come in illegally
[1:39:11] without any kind of
[1:39:12] Investigation a and and I know
[1:39:16] demonically we we knew years ago and
[1:39:19] learned years ago that demonic
[1:39:21] what had been assigned to other
[1:39:25] nations and had been such strongholds in
[1:39:28] other nations would now visit this
[1:39:32] nation and the level of demonic
[1:39:35] possession that was known in the dark
[1:39:38] continent of Africa or in island nations
[1:39:41] like vanatu and some of those places
[1:39:44] where where witch doctors and and and uh
[1:39:48] those kinds of uh of you know whatever
[1:39:50] you call call them have so surrendered
[1:39:53] themselves to demonic possession that
[1:39:55] demons control every step they make well
[1:39:59] I want you to know that kind of evil is
[1:40:02] in this
[1:40:04] nation that kind of demonic power is in
[1:40:08] this nation and the bride Church can't
[1:40:10] play When the church is playing the
[1:40:12] church is playing yes the church is
[1:40:16] playing denominations are playing but
[1:40:19] the bride can't play there can't be any
[1:40:22] playing in here no sir we've got to be
[1:40:25] as serious as possible because you may
[1:40:28] be the one I may be the one that God
[1:40:31] uses to stop
[1:40:35] something and I appreciate every person
[1:40:37] who arms himself I appreciate those who
[1:40:40] who arm themselves in here I don't mind
[1:40:42] that I'm I'm for that I'm not against
[1:40:45] that but I want you to know there would
[1:40:47] be no reason for any of us to think that
[1:40:50] the kind of demonic power that's that's
[1:40:54] happening that's present in the Earth
[1:40:57] today there's no reason that any of us
[1:40:59] should think that a gun can stop that
[1:41:02] that's
[1:41:04] right you could only take out the house
[1:41:08] that evil was living in but the spirit
[1:41:11] would find another way somebody said are
[1:41:14] you trying to make somebody fearful no
[1:41:15] I'm trying to make somebody prayerful on
[1:41:19] I want people to be prayerful and I want
[1:41:21] you to be careful what you let upset you

[1:43:14] here she said I want you said the voice
[1:43:17] said to her I want you to become praise
[1:43:19] personified let's see it how this

[1:43:31] temple know you not yes that your body
[1:43:35] is the
[1:43:38] Temple of the Holy
[1:43:41] Ghost and everything you sit under and
[1:43:43] everything you listen to and everything
[1:43:45] you let in the eye gate is going to
[1:43:48] affect the
[1:43:49] temple you can't be a Temple of Praise a
[1:43:53] temple of glory and a temple of Darkness
[1:43:56] at the same time come on a temple filled
[1:44:00] with his glory by day by and even when
[1:44:04] it's needed the
[1:44:06] most at night when the enemy likes to
[1:44:10] work you may think I've lost my mind but
[1:44:13] there's a certain time for people to be
[1:44:15] at
[1:44:17] home you may think I'm a fanatic there's
[1:44:21] a certain time for people to be at
[1:44:24] home I don't know what that time is for
[1:44:27] you but there's a certain time that
[1:44:30] Christian people full of the light
[1:44:32] aren't roaming up and down the alleys of
[1:44:34] this
[1:44:36] world come on there's a time for us to
[1:44:39] come home there's a time for us to be
[1:44:42] safe there's a time for us to be with
[1:44:44] our families come on I don't believe in
[1:44:47] in my in myself I don't believe that
[1:44:49] God's people should be roaming around
[1:44:51] all hours of the night we are children
[1:44:55] of the day we are children of the light
[1:44:57] God make me a temple filled by with your
[1:45:00] glory day and by night let me be on
[1:45:03] guard let me watch myself if you know
[1:45:06] brother sister that there's a
[1:45:07] vulnerability in your life you better
[1:45:09] guard
[1:45:13] it if the enem is trying to use Facebook
[1:45:16] or some social media to cause you to
[1:45:19] enter in to an emot
[1:45:21] affair with someone who is not your
[1:45:23] companion you better cut that stuff out

[1:45:31] that you know who you are you know I
[1:45:35] know me you know you if you have a
[1:45:40] vulnerability in that area something
[1:45:42] causes your eye to wonderand your mind
[1:45:45] to wander I've watched Brothers in this
[1:45:47] church
[1:45:49] unnecessarily watch other
[1:45:55] women I don't know but what a sister
[1:45:58] might be a sciss or two do the
[1:46:00] same but I've not don't say no you don't
[1:46:05] know maybe you don't but you can't speak
[1:46:09] for everybody
[1:46:10] else the devil I tell you if you if
[1:46:13] you're one of those people that think
[1:46:14] only men struggle with sexual sin you're
[1:46:19] l
[1:46:27] thank you I believe I
[1:46:29] will there's no
[1:46:32] reason there's no reason for any brother
[1:46:36] to watch somebody else's wife watch
[1:46:39] yours you chose
[1:46:44] her if she don't do it for you anymore
[1:46:47] you need to do some praying amen
[1:46:51] you need to pray until she does but you
[1:46:54] need to keep your eyes off of somebody
[1:46:56] else's this is an hour where the enemy
[1:47:00] will come in and he will get in any way
[1:47:03] he can he'll use anybody that will yield
[1:47:07] themselves to him and we can't become
[1:47:10] praise personified if we're becoming
[1:47:14] lust personified anybody with me I know
[1:47:18] I know you've never been to a funeral
[1:47:20] where anybody ever left the funeral
[1:47:23] thinking that there was any possibility
[1:47:25] that the dead person didn't go to
[1:47:27] heaven most of us have never attended a
[1:47:30] funeral where excuse wasn't made for the
[1:47:34] dead if every person that died went to
[1:47:37] heaven there wouldn't be any reason for
[1:47:40] you and I to to walk the walk we're
[1:47:42] walking I don't believe in
[1:47:45] universalism I don't believe that
[1:47:47] everybody's saved I don't believe
[1:47:49] because you're a lockable guy a good Old
[1:47:51] redneck guy that you're going to inherit
[1:47:54] the kingdom of God I don't even believe
[1:47:56] because you've taken up money for others
[1:47:58] in need that means you're going to have
[1:48:00] eternal life there's only one way to
[1:48:03] have eternal life that's through the
[1:48:04] grace and the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:07] Christ and that blood cleanses us from
[1:48:10] all unrighteousness and from all sin
[1:48:13] that blood delivers us if we yield to it
[1:48:18] I'm looking for a body I'm looking for a
[1:48:20] body he's saying I'm looking for a
[1:48:22] people come on now that will embody
[1:48:24] praise that's right their lives will
[1:48:27] become worship their lives will become
[1:48:29] praised let me read the next part of of
[1:48:31] her quote he said uh I saw she said
[1:48:35] excuse me I saw that heaven is indeed
[1:48:38] filled with his praise and glory it is
[1:48:41] here on Earth that praise is lacking his
[1:48:45] glory limited here it seems that above
[1:48:48] all things he desires
[1:48:57] habitations not just
[1:49:00] microphones habitations of
[1:49:04] Praise does that seem biblical to
[1:49:06] you he
[1:49:09] said pure
[1:49:11] praise True
[1:49:13] Praise fervent
[1:49:16] praise now I can be his praise kept
[1:49:20] coming to me this this thought now I can
[1:49:24] be his praise kept coming to me not only
[1:49:28] to not only to offer praise to practice
[1:49:32] praise but what be prais to be praised
[1:49:35] how can you be praised when your life is
[1:49:38] magnifying the Lord when your testimony
[1:49:42] and your life
[1:49:43] matches when what you say and what you
[1:49:47] do just just a minute Amen brother
[1:49:51] when when your walkie
[1:49:53] walkie lines up with your talkie
[1:50:00] talkie yeah I'm going slow
[1:50:03] down when your walkie walking can line
[1:50:05] up with your talkie-talkie
[1:50:08] you can be
[1:50:12] praised how many of you'd rather be
[1:50:14] praise and just do praise it can be
[1:50:17] holler doing praise can be holla yeah we
[1:50:21] need it we got to have it it builds an
[1:50:23] atmosphere but for you personally for
[1:50:25] you personally you can walk out of here
[1:50:28] Hollow there you've served the body and
[1:50:31] you've helped create with the sincerest
[1:50:33] praise you could do you have helped
[1:50:35] create an atmosphere and then yet you
[1:50:37] walk out of here Hollow because you
[1:50:39] weren't just created to do
[1:50:42] praise to offer praise to practice
[1:50:45] praise you were created to be praised no
[1:50:49] comp
[1:50:50] compromise no compromise compromise is
[1:50:54] the Trojan Horse of the end time Church
[1:50:57] come on now he don't March in the front
[1:51:00] door and say you ought to change such
[1:51:02] and such but he comes in
[1:51:05] subtle are you mad brother Shelly not at

[1:51:15] that'll be quiet and listen I'm
[1:51:17] directing it to every one of you because

[1:51:22] heart Psalm 22:3 if you'll put that up
[1:51:25] but Thou Art holy I'm almost through a
[1:51:27] page one but Thou Art
[1:51:29] holy oh thou that

[1:52:11] context I read for you verse three but
[1:52:14] Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us
[1:52:17] the Praises of Israel but I want you to
[1:52:19] hear that this is a prophecy David has
[1:52:22] entered into the spirit of Prophecy
[1:52:24] while he was
[1:52:26] praising while he was singing praises
[1:52:29] while he was writing Praises he has
[1:52:31] entered into the spirit of Prophecy and
[1:52:33] not only into the spirit of Prophecy he
[1:52:36] has entered into the very Spirit of
[1:52:38] Christ and he has started prophesying
[1:52:41] what the Messiah would one day say
[1:52:43] powerful can you imagine e excuse
[1:52:47] me can you imagine getting so lost in
[1:52:50] the spirit that words would begin to
[1:52:53] come out of your mouth that would be
[1:52:55] future words that the king would say
[1:52:57] when he shows up can you imagine such a
[1:53:01] blessing read it for us Elias verse one
[1:53:04] and two
[1:53:05] please my God my God why hast Thou
[1:53:09] forsaken me does that sound familiar to
[1:53:11] you do you remember that that's what he
[1:53:14] said while he was dying on the cross my
[1:53:17] God my God why why hast Thou forsaken me
[1:53:21] read on why art thou so far from helping
[1:53:24] me and from the words of my roaring why
[1:53:28] aren't you coming to help me why Don't
[1:53:31] You Hear My Cries of
[1:53:33] desperation read on oh my God I cry in
[1:53:38] the daytime but thou hearest not and in
[1:53:41] the night's season I am not silent and
[1:53:44] am not silent oh my God I cry in the
[1:53:48] daytime but thou hearest not and in the
[1:53:51] night season and am not silent but look
[1:53:54] at what the next verse says but Thou Art
[1:54:01] holy are you listening to me

[1:54:10] thoughts you're a human
[1:54:13] being you can have
[1:54:15] them anybody had
[1:54:17] any you can have NE ative thought you
[1:54:20] you can even have a thought that says
[1:54:23] God just doesn't seem fair you can have
[1:54:26] that
[1:54:26] thought you can you're a human being you
[1:54:30] have every right to think anything that
[1:54:31] you want to think but we're going to
[1:54:34] have to learn from the men of the
[1:54:35] book cuz they had them too job had them
[1:54:39] too job cursed God curs didn't curse God
[1:54:43] excuse me cursed the day he was born his
[1:54:45] wife wanted him to curse God and die he
[1:54:48] cursed the day he was born yes he he
[1:54:50] cursed his
[1:54:52] circumstances he cursed what he was
[1:54:53] going in and he sounded for a while like
[1:54:56] a man
[1:54:58] forsaken but he didn't stay in that
[1:55:02] place oh he said I wish I had a pin of
[1:55:09] iron that I could write these words I
[1:55:12] know five minutes before you didn't
[1:55:14] sound like you
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:17] knew but now I know Oh My Redeemer
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:25] living I know he does so we went from
[1:55:28] cursing the day he was born to knowing
[1:55:30] that his redeemer live his true
[1:55:33] self which one was Joe both of them were
[1:55:36] job but who was the real job I know that
[1:55:40] my redeemer
[1:55:42] liveth what was talking a minute ago the
[1:55:44] trials were talking the fire was talking
[1:55:48] the heartache was talking the grief was
[1:55:51] talking the loss was talking it's all
[1:55:54] right sometimes it'll talk but you've
[1:55:57] got to recognize the
[1:55:59] sound you've got to recognize what it
[1:56:01] sounds like when it starts coming out of
[1:56:03] your mouth and you've got to make sure
[1:56:05] you bring everything right back to the
[1:56:07] goodness of God but Thou Art
[1:56:10] holy now who's saying this this is
[1:56:13] Christ that's
[1:56:15] right on this is
[1:56:18] powerful this is
[1:56:20] Christ can you imagine
[1:56:24] Christ remember that God we serve is
[1:56:27] 100% God and he was 100% man sir there's
[1:56:33] no other explanation for the godhead
[1:56:35] that fits every verse of the Bible
[1:56:38] there's no other explanation of the
[1:56:40] godhead that fits every other verse of
[1:56:42] the Bible he could not have been half
[1:56:44] God and half
[1:56:47] man couldn't have served could couldn't
[1:56:49] have serve the purpose for which he was
[1:56:52] intended if he was 50% God and 50% man
[1:56:56] somebody said how could anything be 100%
[1:56:58] God and 100% man didn't you hear God say
[1:57:01] I'm going to do something that's never
[1:57:02] been done
[1:57:03] before I'm going to send a creation
[1:57:06] that's never been sent before he's going
[1:57:08] to come in a way that's never come
[1:57:10] before I'm only going to borrow her body
[1:57:13] she's not even going to produce the egg
[1:57:16] I'm going to just borrow her body like
[1:57:18] an incubator she's going give him
[1:57:20] warmth she's going to nurture him like a
[1:57:22] mama but that's that that I'm going to
[1:57:24] do in her is not coming from her it's
[1:57:26] not coming from Joseph I'm going to
[1:57:28] place an egg in her belly I'm going to
[1:57:30] fertilize that egg by the Holy Ghost and
[1:57:32] what's going to come out from her loins
[1:57:34] is going to be 100% God and 100% man
[1:57:38] he's going to baffle the world he's
[1:57:40] going to baffle his neighbors he's going
[1:57:42] to baffle his contemporaries he's going
[1:57:44] to baffle
[1:57:46] theologians yes he they're going to try
[1:57:48] to cut him up into to two or three but
[1:57:50] it's not going to
[1:57:52] work because here oh Israel the Lord our
[1:57:55] God is one is one and so here God steps
[1:57:59] on the scene John 1 steps on the scene
[1:58:02] God made flesh and dwelt Among Us so
[1:58:06] he's hanging there on the
[1:58:08] cross and kinosis is taking
[1:58:12] place that part of him that was God is
[1:58:16] pulling
[1:58:18] away it had to be
[1:58:21] so only the man could
[1:58:24] die but God couldn't die does that
[1:58:27] baffle anybody it seems real simple to
[1:58:29] me the god couldn't die only the
[1:58:33] humanity could die right so the spirit
[1:58:35] of God begin to pull away from him and
[1:58:37] the and the
[1:58:39] loss and the
[1:58:41] grief that he was
[1:58:45] feeling somebody said it's like a
[1:58:47] husband losing his wife life because he
[1:58:50] feels like she's a part of him that's
[1:58:52] the closest thing that we could that we
[1:58:55] could compare it to but it's not
[1:58:57] enough it's not enough because a husband
[1:59:01] may lose his wife but he doesn't lose
[1:59:03] the god of his
[1:59:04] salvation here was a body that had
[1:59:07] functioned 100% man 100% God and now the
[1:59:11] god part of him was
[1:59:13] pulling and he was emptying himself of
[1:59:16] the god part of who he was it's really
[1:59:18] really powerful when you understand
[1:59:20] you'll get it right if you just run all
[1:59:22] the scriptures together and all the
[1:59:24] quotes together and here he's dying like
[1:59:28] that and he's crying out I'm crying in
[1:59:31] the daytime you're not hearing me I'm
[1:59:33] I'm crying I'm roaring at
[1:59:35] night and you're not hearing me let's
[1:59:37] look at it again Psalm 221
[1:59:41] and2 why hast Thou forsaken me why art
[1:59:44] thou so far from helping me and from the
[1:59:47] words of my roaring oh oh my God I cry
[1:59:50] in the daytime but thou hearest not and
[1:59:52] in the ninth season and am not silent
[1:59:55] but Thou Are
[1:59:59] Holy hly the man is talking to the
[2:00:05] God just like we read in the Bible the
[2:00:08] God sometimes spoke to the
[2:00:10] man Thou Art my
[2:00:14] son come take your place with
[2:00:17] me this is the man crying out to the God
[2:00:21] but Thou Art holy yes yes oh thou that
[2:00:26] inhabited the
[2:00:28] Praises of
[2:00:30] Israel let me read verse three in the
[2:00:32] Amplified But You Are
[2:00:34] Holy oh you who dwell in the Holy place
[2:00:40] where the Praises of Israel are
[2:00:44] offered let me read it in the complete
[2:00:46] Jewish Bible is anybody still with me
[2:00:50] my God by day I will call to you but you
[2:00:54] don't
[2:00:56] answer likewise at night but I get no
[2:00:59] relief
[2:01:01] remember this was the
[2:01:03] man crying out to the
[2:01:06] god
[2:01:10] nevertheless oh I wished you were with
[2:01:13] me I wish you were with me right
[2:01:16] now nevertheless You Are
[2:01:21] Holy read it
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:27] enthroned the Lord is
[2:01:30] enthroned on the Praises of Israel
[2:01:33] that's why your Praises are so
[2:01:36] important because as long as he sits in
[2:01:38] your praise as long as he inhabits and
[2:01:41] lives in your praise he is Lord he's
[2:01:43] Lord he's Lord of every circumstance
[2:01:46] he's Lord of every situation but when
[2:01:48] you allow the enemy to arrest your
[2:01:50] tongue and you use it for judgment
[2:01:51] cursing and
[2:01:54] prejudices you're absolutely taking him
[2:01:56] off the Throne of your life you you
[2:01:59] can't change thank you Stephen I heard
[2:02:01] that you can't change the fact that he's
[2:02:04] sitting on the throne Eternal you can't
[2:02:07] change the fact that he's still king of
[2:02:09] kings and Lord of lords but when you're
[2:02:12] not giving him a place to sit when
[2:02:15] you're not building him a house to live
[2:02:17] in when you're not making him a
[2:02:19] habitation to dwell in you're taking him
[2:02:21] off his throne in your life that's and
[2:02:25] if you think the Throne of your life is
[2:02:26] going to sit
[2:02:30] empty there's a dozen other entities
[2:02:33] anybody with me there's a dozen other
[2:02:36] entities just waiting for an
[2:02:38] opportunity to take up the Throne of
[2:02:40] your life to be Lord over every
[2:02:43] situation your flesh you don't have to
[2:02:45] go looking for a devil your flesh would
[2:02:48] like to sit on the throne oh
[2:02:50] yeah you know that oos sari flesh we
[2:02:52] live in the one that says I think I'll

[2:03:10] you that ain't the Holy Ghost talking to
[2:03:12] you that's your sorry rotten
[2:03:14] flesh we don't need a demon to come sit
[2:03:17] on the throne there's a flesh
[2:03:20] man there's a nature within us that'll
[2:03:23] take up that place if we let him and
[2:03:26] he'll start ruling your life he'll start
[2:03:29] CH running you around town at his
[2:03:31] bidding

[2:04:29] Holy and you are enthroned on the
[2:04:32] Praises of Israel you're not coming down
[2:04:35] even if I perish
[2:04:37] here right even if I die here and even
[2:04:42] never toise again you're still God over
[2:04:45] Israel as long as she's praising you
[2:04:52] you see why the devil hates your
[2:04:54] praise you see why the devil want you
[2:04:56] focused on somebody else's flag
[2:04:59] waving instead of focused on your
[2:05:03] praise because he absolutely wants to
[2:05:06] take God off the throne in your life and
[2:05:09] the only way he can do it is to go
[2:05:11] against your praise when When Praise
[2:05:13] when when people have come to this
[2:05:15] message of Truth and we've allowed the
[2:05:17] preachers to talk us out of a of a of a
[2:05:20] living experience with God and a real
[2:05:22] Holy Ghost worship service when we've
[2:05:24] allowed things like that thank you so
[2:05:26] much when we've allowed things like that
[2:05:29] to happen we have absolutely allowed God
[2:05:32] to slip off the Throne of our life he's
[2:05:34] no longer enthroned in our life because
[2:05:37] our Praises are quenched and our Praises
[2:05:40] are silenced and we've looked around at
[2:05:42] everybody else I I I I want to remind
[2:05:45] you that Pentecost is not a swear word
[2:06:02] it's an
[2:06:05] experience yes
[2:06:08] sir I threw this verse
[2:06:12] in because it says so
[2:06:16] much I ran across it by accident Isaiah
[2:06:20] 57 15 it's
[2:06:23] 1:00
[2:06:24] good praise God we're doing good I got
[2:06:27] two hours

[2:06:36] one the spirit of prophecy on
[2:06:39] Isaiah for thus sayith the high and
[2:06:42] lofty one that inhabiteth

[2:07:07] myself I dwell in the high and holy
[2:07:10] place with him

[2:07:17] Bible it about knock me I know I've read
[2:07:20] it it almost knocked me off my chair

[2:07:42] Spirit to revive the spirit of the
[2:07:47] humble and to to revive the heart of the
[2:07:51] contrite
[2:07:53] ones now real preacher could preach on
[2:07:56] that for an
[2:07:58] hour can you imagine realizing that the
[2:08:01] god of Eternity dwells in a high and
[2:08:04] holy place but he's not there alone

[2:16:15] Lord I will Joy
[2:16:18] in the god of my
[2:16:23] salvation war and Devastation had
[2:16:26] shrouded the land of Judah the calans
[2:16:29] were about to take over the city of
[2:16:31] Jerusalem the walls of Jerusalem were
[2:16:34] about to be breached by this powerful
[2:16:36] enemy the Temple of Solomon was about to
[2:16:39] be defiled the country was sitting on
[2:16:42] the precipice of ruin the flocks were
[2:16:44] being raided by roving bands of rustlers
[2:16:47] the Farmland was no longer being
[2:16:49] cultivated because of sloth and drought
[2:16:53] Josiah's Godly reforms were being
[2:16:56] entirely overturned by joakim's Wicked
[2:17:01] rule nothing was looking
[2:17:04] good the fig tree blossoms had not come
[2:17:09] out the fruit of the vine in the trees
[2:17:12] failed to
[2:17:13] materialize the olive trees had failed
[2:17:15] to give out the oil the fields Barren
[2:17:18] and no produce is found there the flocks
[2:17:20] have been cut off from the fold due to
[2:17:21] the neglect of the
[2:17:25] Shepherds if there was ever a reason to
[2:17:29] moan to groan anybody with
[2:17:35] me the people in this
[2:17:38] day yet I will rejoice in the Lord I
[2:17:41] will
[2:17:42] joy in the god of my
[2:17:45] salvation Matthew Henry a famous famous
[2:17:47] commentator he describes This Joy there
[2:17:50] as a holy
[2:17:52] fear and a holy Joy I will I will have
[2:17:55] holy fear and holy Joy at the same time
[2:17:59] and joy isn't a byproduct of an easy
[2:18:01] life it's a response to God's never
[2:18:03] changing character when our even when
[2:18:05] our circumstances don't change that hind
[2:18:09] that we were talking about a moment ago
[2:18:10] is referring to a female deer or
[2:18:12] mountain goat that can place their back
[2:18:14] feet exactly where her front feet
[2:18:16] stepped one of the only creatures in
[2:18:18] God's kingdom that can do a thing like
[2:18:20] that and do it
[2:18:22] quickly and carefully without a whole
[2:18:25] lot of thought they climb put their
[2:18:28] front feet there and can pull their back
[2:18:31] feet up put them in the exact same spot
[2:18:34] while their front Feet's reaching for
[2:18:36] the next place I stood at the bottom of
[2:18:40] Angy just near the Dead Sea we were
[2:18:43] there one particular time I think it was
[2:18:45] when the when the Ibex were were in
[2:18:48] mating season and so there were many of
[2:18:51] them and they were very very
[2:18:52] active and I watched some of the biggest
[2:18:55] ibcs you've ever seen in your life way
[2:18:58] up on the precipice of a mountain and
[2:19:00] they were climbing a a place where the
[2:19:03] mountain went straight like
[2:19:07] that and you know they weren't creeping
[2:19:10] up they were amazingly going with Leaps
[2:19:13] and Bounds to the top of that
[2:19:16] mountain I saw one slip one time I lost
[2:19:19] my
[2:19:20] breath I was watching this big old thing
[2:19:23] with them big beautiful horns and and
[2:19:25] and it looked like he was about to uh
[2:19:27] slip and all of a sudden he did slip and
[2:19:30] his foot went out from under him and I
[2:19:31] thought oh no he there's nowhere for him
[2:19:33] to land except at the bottom but he
[2:19:36] found a
[2:19:38] place and I want to tell you something
[2:19:40] he didn't catch your with his front
[2:19:43] foot neither one of his front feet
[2:19:45] caught him he caught himself with his
[2:19:47] back
[2:19:49] legs and when I saw that I'm sitting
[2:19:51] there thinking this must be what the
[2:19:53] writer meant I will make your feet like
[2:19:56] hind feet among high places it means
[2:20:02] very surefooted did you know a lifestyle
[2:20:04] of Praise can make you very
[2:20:08] surefooted anybody with me he does not
[2:20:11] always change our circumstances
[2:20:13] immediately when we pray sometimes our
[2:20:16] challenges are heartaches and pains are
[2:20:18] still there but often our strength is
[2:20:20] found in Walking
[2:20:22] on depending on him and giving him
[2:20:27] praise
[2:20:30] in
[2:20:31] in in
[2:20:33] all things I love that little tiny word
[2:20:39] yet all of these all those that
[2:20:42] represent
[2:20:44] uncertainties are followed by a
[2:20:46] crescendo of
[2:20:48] yet I will
[2:20:51] praise I Will
[2:20:53] Rejoice one more verse of one more place
[2:20:56] of scripture here before we go Psalm 149

[2:22:39] their
[2:22:41] hand that word high guess what it means
[2:22:44] it means
[2:22:46] High it means a lifting up the
[2:22:50] exaltation of God by his holy people
[2:22:53] rising up lifting up raising
[2:22:58] up so let the high praises it also means
[2:23:03] an
[2:23:04] advanced it means advanced in
[2:23:08] complexity or
[2:23:12] elaboration like when they say higher
[2:23:16] mathematics higher mathematics that's
[2:23:19] that's above 2 plus
[2:23:21] two higher praise or High Praise means
[2:23:25] praise that is above and

[2:23:46] it
[2:23:49] so I went to the Lexicon I've I've
[2:23:51] shared this with you before I'm almost
[2:23:53] reluctant to share it with you because I
[2:23:55] don't want to make you
[2:23:57] Fanatics and some of you run in that
[2:24:05] direction and the guilty said
[2:24:08] amen but I cannot help brother Daniel
[2:24:12] not to share these
[2:24:14] words because it just don't sound like
[2:24:17] the average service around the
[2:24:21] message these are not just words I
[2:24:24] pulled up out of the dictionary these
[2:24:25] are these
[2:24:27] are uh
[2:24:30] synonyms from the
[2:24:33] Lexicon these are other words used for
[2:24:38] High

[2:25:25] years I suffered with acute achilles
[2:25:29] tendonitis that's what the doctor called
[2:25:31] it because brother when it wasn't there
[2:25:34] it wasn't there but when it was there it
[2:25:39] was there it was acute it was it was
[2:25:42] powerfully
[2:25:43] present High Praise is tall praise

[2:26:19] going on in my left ear but it's it's

[2:28:03] tupe I want you to use
[2:28:05] wisdom but I also want the rest of you
[2:28:08] to understand if you're going to do it
[2:28:12] come
[2:28:15] on it's supposed to be high
[2:28:19] flown just watch just watch my critics
[2:28:22] will take the still shot of
[2:28:27] [Applause]
[2:28:30] this and just so you know we didn't meet
[2:28:32] before church to decide what color we
[2:28:35] were going to
[2:28:38] fly thank you so much I I I preached a
[2:28:42] message during camp meeting on tongues
[2:28:47] and I tried to set the record straight
[2:28:50] and I called it the bride's
[2:28:52] advantage and do you know there are
[2:28:53] people who heard it and their their take
[2:28:56] on it was he's preaching basically that
[2:29:00] tongues is the initial
[2:29:02] evidence Not only was I not preaching
[2:29:04] that I didn't ever preach it that's what
[2:29:07] made me quite unusual in Assemblies of
[2:29:10] God because it's one of the tenants of
[2:29:13] their faith tongues is the is the
[2:29:15] initial evidence of the B ISM of the
[2:29:17] Holy Ghost but I had seen too many
[2:29:18] Devils talking
[2:29:21] tongues I'd seen too many child
[2:29:26] abusers I'd seen too many men run off of
[2:29:28] other people's W wives while they were
[2:29:30] talking in tongues so I knew that just
[2:29:32] because somebody talked in t but do you
[2:29:35] see how the devil
[2:29:36] hears and how he twist things and he
[2:29:40] wouldn't do that if if a prayer language
[2:29:43] if if Saints being able to intercede in
[2:29:45] tongues the devil wouldn't fight it if
[2:29:47] it wasn't where her Victory
[2:29:49] [Applause]
[2:29:53] lies he wouldn't hate it so
[2:29:56] much I didn't say it was but I did say
[2:29:59] what brother random said anybody who
[2:30:02] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:30:04] will speak in tongues at some point or
[2:30:07] [Music]
[2:30:09] another that don't sound like initial
[2:30:11] evidence to me that's right lofty High
[2:30:14] flown wait a minute High flown
[2:30:17] exalted elevated raised
[2:30:22] [Applause]
[2:30:25] heightened that's what I like to talk
[2:30:28] about high price praise I don't know
[2:30:31] what your praise has cost you come
[2:30:35] on but I know what my praise has cost me
[2:30:39] hello I don't know what yours has cost
[2:30:42] you but I know the price of mine and
[2:30:44] it's valuable to me
[2:30:47] because the battle was hard come on the
[2:30:51] suffering was hard the trial was hard so
[2:30:54] the praise ought to match the intensity
[2:30:57] of the
[2:30:58] fire
[2:31:01] hallelujah
[2:31:04] hallelujah my praise ought to match the
[2:31:07] intensity of my
[2:31:09] [Music]
[2:31:11] trial you don't really believe that
[2:31:12] everybody ought to praise the Lord like
[2:31:14] that do you I didn't write this book
[2:31:17] let the high let the high praises of God
[2:31:20] be in their mouth and a two-edged sword
[2:31:22] in their hand remember we're not
[2:31:23] preaching on
[2:31:25] worship sir I'm preaching on praise and
[2:31:29] I don't care what the charismatics say
[2:31:31] until they learn the beauty of Praise
[2:31:35] they may call it worship all day long
[2:31:37] but that don't make it
[2:31:41] worship you've got to learn you've got
[2:31:43] to learn the tool you've got to learn
[2:31:45] the tool of praise you've got to learn
[2:31:47] the effectiveness of High Praise it's
[2:31:49] got to become a revelation to you and
[2:31:51] you've got to get in that place so that
[2:31:53] the glory
[2:31:55] comes that's what breaks open the
[2:32:01] atmosphere but you don't want to live
[2:32:04] there you want to come on in without a
[2:32:07] without a proper progression the the
[2:32:10] atmosphere is not properly uh created
[2:32:13] for the word to go forth praise breaks
[2:32:16] open the heaven worship lets the heaven
[2:32:19] come down it works
[2:32:22] together praise is going to be tall and
[2:32:25] acute and shrill and piercing and lofty
[2:32:27] and Grand and high flown exalted
[2:32:29] elevated Rays height and high priced
[2:32:32] expens just flat out
[2:32:43] expensive like a $20 hamburger
[2:32:49] expensive who would have ever thought
[2:32:50] the day would
[2:32:53] come you'd pay $20 for a hammer I went
[2:32:57] to Iceland and paid
[2:33:00] 50 years
[2:33:04] ago
[2:33:06] dear
[2:33:07] costly
[2:33:09] strong
[2:33:12] heavy it's it's
[2:33:15] War
[2:33:17] for every Hungry Heart in closing
[2:33:20] maybe for every Hungry Heart That
[2:33:23] desires to hear the word there's a
[2:33:27] devil that desires to keep God's bride
[2:33:30] from hearing the word that they need to
[2:33:32] hear for this
[2:33:34] hour you know I long to be out of the
[2:33:37] ABCs I I long to be out of the stage I
[2:33:41] want to be out of this
[2:33:43] stage but the reality is
[2:33:47] with the kind of week that a lot of
[2:33:48] people had to try to break down a
[2:33:52] mystery I am preaching a
[2:33:55] mystery but to try to break down a
[2:33:58] mystery in an atmosphere like we're
[2:34:00] living walking through right now
[2:34:02] wouldn't wouldn't probably go very far
[2:34:06] just look at a couple Sundays ago it
[2:34:08] just don't go very
[2:34:11] far in an hour like this we've got to be
[2:34:14] we've got to we've got to speak where
[2:34:16] where people
[2:34:17] are and we've got to minister to where
[2:34:20] they are and some of you had mind
[2:34:22] battles all week long fought
[2:34:26] discouragement fought depression fought
[2:34:28] first one thing and then another all
[2:34:31] week long the last thing you need
[2:34:34] today is for me to give you a summary of
[2:34:36] The Seven
[2:34:40] Seals what we need today is a reminder
[2:34:43] one more time we need a reminder
[2:34:47] it's not
[2:34:48] optional you don't get to take a week
[2:34:51] off this is a daily thing you got to
[2:34:54] find a way to let your praise out every
[2:34:56] day you got to get it out there every
[2:34:58] day and not just any old praise will do
[2:35:02] fierce I like this one
[2:35:09] loaded when I used to get out of the
[2:35:11] vehicle I used to get out of the vehicle
[2:35:13] preaching up in North Carolina again get
[2:35:16] my Bible out under my arm and walk
[2:35:17] toward the door there was an old brother
[2:35:19] that used to stand on the on the porch
[2:35:21] of brother uh Green's church and he'd
[2:35:23] say well where comes brother Shelly and
[2:35:25] he looks like he's loaded for
[2:35:28] bar I was I was
[2:35:31] loaded I didn't have to wait till I got
[2:35:34] there to figure out what I was going to
[2:35:35] say I already had my message ready it
[2:35:38] was going to depend on the Lord to help
[2:35:39] me deliver it our praise ought to be
[2:35:43] loaded amen you don't come in in here
[2:35:46] and shoot an empty
[2:35:47] gun when you're praising him it's got to
[2:35:51] be loaded it's got to be full and ready
[2:35:54] it's got to really be the Overflow of
[2:35:57] what you
[2:35:58] fought now now let me get down to the
[2:36:00] last
[2:36:08] three
[2:36:14] tipsy
[2:36:17] let the Tipsy
[2:36:19] praise be in their
[2:36:22] mouth what does it mean well are these
[2:36:25] men
[2:36:27] drunk isn't that what he
[2:36:29] said are these men drunk look at all
[2:36:32] these galileans acts chapter 2 look at
[2:36:35] all these galileans just like the
[2:36:40] Rednecks this early in the day drunk
[2:36:43] already drinking already inebriated this
[2:36:46] early in the
[2:36:47] day what do you think they were doing
[2:36:50] that caused people to to uh accuse them
[2:36:53] of being drunk when they weren't drunk
[2:36:56] they were drunk on the new wine but they
[2:36:58] had not been drinking the natural
[2:37:01] sauce they've been drinking spiritual
[2:37:04] sauce you get a good dose of spiritual
[2:37:07] sauce and you'll quit running to the
[2:37:09] natural
[2:37:12] stuff nothing will satisfy you like a
[2:37:15] good Holy Ghost
[2:37:16] drink
[2:37:21] hallelujah
[2:37:23] praise as an
[2:37:25] overflow of your Tipsy
[2:37:28] experience
[2:37:31] inebriated
[2:37:33] stammering
[2:37:39] stuttering jumping
[2:37:42] twisting in a Godly
[2:37:44] manner amen you're not on the Dance
[2:37:48] Floor you're on the red
[2:37:52] [Music]
[2:37:54] Seashore you sisters when you're
[2:37:57] praising the Lord remember don't don't
[2:37:59] let it be something that to get on your
[2:38:00] nerves but and hinder you but remember
[2:38:05] remember even your praise has to be a
[2:38:08] modest praise in the sense that you
[2:38:11] don't want to you know undress
[2:38:14] yourself
[2:38:18] I'm not for
[2:38:19] that but I I'd like to see somebody lose
[2:38:23] their
[2:38:26] pride
[2:38:30] on I went to the Tent Revival they
[2:38:32] picked me
[2:38:33] up I was had a night off of
[2:38:37] Revival and my
[2:38:39] friends wanted me to go to the Tent
[2:38:41] Revival with them in ela
[2:38:44] Alabama and I was preaching the next
[2:38:47] night in
[2:38:48] Dothan and I needed a night off I just
[2:38:51] closed a 3-we
[2:38:53] Revival and was getting ready to go into
[2:38:55] another Revival literally one night
[2:38:58] later and I wanted to stay home by
[2:39:02] myself but my friends wanted me to
[2:39:05] go to this Tent Revival that they were
[2:39:08] having in ela and when they picked me up
[2:39:12] I was
[2:39:13] dressed better than any of
[2:39:18] them I would have left to have just gone
[2:39:21] in a pair of
[2:39:22] jeans because I was just tired I just
[2:39:26] didn't want to go and I certainly didn't
[2:39:28] want to
[2:39:29] dress but I knew in those days
[2:39:33] especially that I had
[2:39:40] better
[2:39:42] shill High flown EX exalted
[2:39:50] praise aana gets
[2:39:55] it but I was dressed threepiece suit and
[2:39:59] Tai and everybody in the car looked a
[2:40:03] lot more casual and they said what' you
[2:40:05] wear that
[2:40:06] for I said well I thought I thought I
[2:40:09] had better dress up I figured everybody
[2:40:10] would dress up I know how sometimes
[2:40:13] these Holiness people these were free
[2:40:15] holding his people and I knew how
[2:40:17] judgmental they were about how people
[2:40:19] dress for church so I thought I was
[2:40:21] doing the right thing said well you
[2:40:23] going to wish you hadn't wore
[2:40:25] that I said well I know it's hot no no
[2:40:28] it ain't hot but said now when those
[2:40:31] people get to praising the
[2:40:34] Lord the dust is going to
[2:40:37] fly it's going to look like a cloud in
[2:40:39] there but it won't be the glory Cloud
[2:40:41] it'll be a dust
[2:40:44] cloud and and those women said they're
[2:40:46] going to shout their hair down and hair
[2:40:50] pins are going to fly
[2:40:52] and hair pieces and rats and all those
[2:40:56] things women used to put in their hair
[2:40:57] to make it
[2:41:01] taller you know the higher the hair the
[2:41:03] closer to God that kind of thought
[2:41:08] that and I said that ain't going to
[2:41:10] bother
[2:41:12] me and said there'll be rolling around
[2:41:14] and that they're just going to have a
[2:41:16] time and said you're going to wish you
[2:41:18] was dressed different and I said well
[2:41:20] anything I intend to do to praise the
[2:41:24] Lord I can do it the way I'm dressed and
[2:41:28] I wasn't real nice about it I was kind
[2:41:30] of
[2:41:31] rough and I thought you know it's it's
[2:41:33] one thing when you go in the spirit of
[2:41:35] God gets to move in and you get in in in
[2:41:37] involved in the praise but these people
[2:41:39] plan it I was a little offended they
[2:41:43] know when they get there what they're
[2:41:45] going to do
[2:41:46] well I was of the school that you never
[2:41:49] know what the spirit of the Lord's going
[2:41:51] to do but they were of the school we do
[2:41:54] know cuz we're going to grab a hold of
[2:41:56] him and not let him loose till He
[2:41:58] blesses
[2:41:59] us that was their attitude I wasn't used
[2:42:02] to
[2:42:03] that so they called on me to
[2:42:07] sing I'd never been around this
[2:42:10] particular bunch of people
[2:42:12] before I I almost thought I sung but it
[2:42:16] slipped
[2:42:18] me I got to I thought I better sing a
[2:42:21] slow
[2:42:23] song If I sing a fast song they'll go
[2:42:29] berserk and they'll expect me
[2:42:32] to and I'm too tired
[2:42:35] to so I sung about a medium Tempo song
[2:42:40] but there weren medium Tempo
[2:42:44] musicians and by verse
[2:42:47] three I could hardly catch a breath and
[2:42:49] I was a young
[2:42:50] man they done speeded it up spit it up
[2:42:54] so fast I could hardly get to words
[2:42:57] in I looked up and here come four five
[2:43:00] right for me right toward me
[2:43:02] Brothers I thought are they going to
[2:43:04] take me off the platform what in the
[2:43:06] word are they going to do no they come
[2:43:09] up there and started hitting me on the
[2:43:10] leg while I was singing sing it
[2:43:14] brother
[2:43:16] sing it
[2:43:18] brother and I thought to myself that's
[2:43:20] what I'm trying to
[2:43:25] do I know you can't imagine me being the
[2:43:27] dignified
[2:43:29] one but I thought this is wildness the
[2:43:33] these people are
[2:43:34] wild come
[2:43:38] on I've only ever seen one other Bunch
[2:43:41] like it and they happen to be in the
[2:43:44] message
[2:43:46] they were so happy and so I thoughtwell
[2:43:49] I'm going to have to stop the m i could
[2:43:51] tell the musicians were never going to
[2:43:52] stop the song it was up to me so I
[2:43:56] said and finally we landed it and I
[2:44:00] smiled and put went to put the
[2:44:02] microphone down and they said sing
[2:44:07] another and I said well I want to give
[2:44:09] the time to the preacher and I'm just a
[2:44:10] guest here and I don't I don't want to
[2:44:12] take up any time saying brother so I
[2:44:15] sung again another song and here are
[2:44:18] some more come
[2:44:19] up Pat me on the shoulder Pat me on the
[2:44:22] leg screaming in my ear sing it brother
[2:44:25] sing
[2:44:27] it they got to dancing and running and
[2:44:31] praising the
[2:44:32] Lord and the longer they praised him the
[2:44:35] more I wanted
[2:44:37] to come on it's
[2:44:41] contagious in a few minutes the
[2:44:43] exhaustion started lifting
[2:44:47] that little bit of pride of you know
[2:44:49] thinking that I had a little more
[2:44:51] dignity than they did that started
[2:44:56] leaving I'd like to see some of you get
[2:44:58] in
[2:44:59] that I started snorting a little like
[2:45:02] they did you know and before I knew what
[2:45:05] had happened this is the truth the truth
[2:45:07] if I've ever told the
[2:45:08] truth before I knew what had happened I
[2:45:11] had lost the mic I know I never really
[2:45:14] knew what happened to the
[2:45:18] mic I think I think I must have thrown
[2:45:20] it but I don't know where I threw it I
[2:45:22] hope it wasn't
[2:45:23] expensive and did I ever have myself a
[2:45:27] time I mean to tell you I had a time and
[2:45:30] when I came to
[2:45:33] myself I was laying in the
[2:45:37] sawdust and I looked down across the
[2:45:39] front and there was a a a a a place
[2:45:44] about 3 in
[2:45:45] wide and about 20 ft
[2:45:49] long and the sawdust had been
[2:45:52] immaculately it looked like somebody had
[2:45:54] done it with a
[2:45:56] spoon and had
[2:45:58] immaculately pull that sawdust and it
[2:46:00] looked like a little trough like a rain
[2:46:02] trough or something all the way
[2:46:05] across I was so drunk I was laughing and
[2:46:10] and I I was so
[2:46:13] drunk I hardly knew where I was and I
[2:46:17] kept looking at
[2:46:19] that and I thought I know that wasn't
[2:46:22] there when I went up to saying what in
[2:46:24] the world is that and the big speaker
[2:46:28] the the real main guy he walked over
[2:46:30] there and put his hand down he helped me
[2:46:32] up and I said brother what
[2:46:36] happened he said brother Shelly God
[2:46:39] knock the starch out of
[2:46:42] you that's what he said he said God got
[2:46:45] nothing except God knocked the starch
[2:46:47] out of you and I said can you tell me
[2:46:50] what that he said oh brother Shelly I
[2:46:53] don't want to tell
[2:46:54] you what no videos thank you
[2:47:00] Jesus I don't want to tell you what
[2:47:02] happened I said tell
[2:47:04] me he said after you had danced and
[2:47:07] jumped and throw the mic and carried on
[2:47:09] like that he said you ended up on your
[2:47:11] face in the
[2:47:13] sawdust and he said I'm watching you
[2:47:16] there and I'm thinking pour it on him
[2:47:17] Lord pour it on him Lord knock the
[2:47:19] starch out of him Lord help him
[2:47:22] Jesus and he said I thought you'd lay
[2:47:25] there the rest of the service he said
[2:47:26] the next thing I know you was up on all
[2:47:31] fours you took your head and you dipped
[2:47:34] your nose right down in the
[2:47:37] sawdust and he said brother Shelly that
[2:47:40] trough across there is what you did with
[2:47:42] your nose you rooted across the the
[2:47:45] front like a
[2:47:51] pig I know what I know what High Praise
[2:47:55] Is I know what it means to get
[2:48:00] lost wasn't that wasn't that out of
[2:48:03] order
[2:48:05] yes I'm not going to stand here and tell
[2:48:08] you that wasn't out of order it was out
[2:48:10] of order and it was exactly what I
[2:48:13] needed because I had way too much
[2:48:17] order I didn't start out that way
[2:48:20] Hallelujah I picked it up I developed it
[2:48:24] I didn't start off with that but I
[2:48:26] picked it up and you know what we went
[2:48:28] in then the next night I had to go back
[2:48:30] and start the Revival and I can assure
[2:48:33] you that I never ran another Revival
[2:48:35] like the one I had the week before that
[2:48:38] happened it changed everything God
[2:48:41] literally had to knock the starch out of
[2:48:44] me and remind me you serve
[2:48:47] me you you serve me you're at my
[2:48:51] disposal somebody said I don't believe
[2:48:53] God would let do that to somebody he W
[2:48:55] he wouldn't do it to somebody that
[2:48:58] didn't want him to have
[2:49:00] control but see my heart wanted him to
[2:49:02] be in charge and yet I had taken over
[2:49:05] some of the responsibility of being in
[2:49:07] charge maybe some of you have taken over
[2:49:10] some of the responsibility of being in
[2:49:12] charge in your life and you just need to
[2:49:13] surrender it to him
[2:49:15] let's have the
[2:49:16] musicians becoming the
[2:49:20] embodiment of
[2:49:28] Praise let's stand
[2:49:36] together make me that Praise
[2:49:41] Jesus does it have to be wild no
[2:49:48] does it have to embarrass you
[2:49:51] no does it have to draw all the
[2:49:53] attention to you well it did me that
[2:49:56] night but nor normal circumstances no
[2:49:59] God was working on me he was getting me
[2:50:02] ready probably for what I do
[2:50:05] now come
[2:50:07] on he'll get you ready if you'll yield
[2:50:10] just be
[2:50:12] consistent my best piece of advice to
[2:50:15] you about praise is this don't you come
[2:50:17] in here one week and praise him like a
[2:50:19] wild woman and then come in here the
[2:50:22] next week like you lost your best
[2:50:24] friend that's not consistent praise and
[2:50:27] it won't give you the ultimate Victory
[2:50:29] you make up your mind when you come
[2:50:31] through those doors I have fought hell
[2:50:33] this
[2:50:34] week every devil in hell has tried to
[2:50:36] steal my joy my praise every Spirit has
[2:50:40] tried to talk me out of being at church
[2:50:41] and every joint in my body or every
[2:50:44] every system in my body screaming at me
[2:50:46] not to be here but I'm here anyway and
[2:50:48] I'm going to give God High
[2:50:51] Praise I'm going to let the High Praise
[2:50:53] of God be in my mouth in a two-edged
[2:50:55] sword that's right aren't you afraid
