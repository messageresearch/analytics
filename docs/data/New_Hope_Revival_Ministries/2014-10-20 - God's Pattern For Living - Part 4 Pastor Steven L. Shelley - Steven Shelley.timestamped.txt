[1:11] the wonderful things of God's word I am

[1:21] ways to bring the truth to bring
[1:23] instruction to bring help to the nations
[1:26] of the world and I would like to ask you
[1:28] to pray for these networks that God will
[1:32] not only uh Prosper them that he will
[1:34] not only provide for their needs but
[1:36] that he will expand them that they will
[1:39] be able to reach out in into farther

[2:12] like to know where you are what your
[2:14] name is and where you're watching this
[2:16] program it would be a great blessing
[2:18] we're are a small group of Bible
[2:20] Believers in Alabama and we believe in
[2:23] the power of prayer and we're praying
[2:25] that God will use this broadcast to
[2:27] speak into your life so if you could if
[2:30] you feel like you can then contact us it
[2:33] would be a real joy to be able to hear
[2:35] from you we're at part four in a study
[2:39] on God's pattern how he measures Us in
[2:42] this hour I'm so thankful that we're not
[2:45] being measured by men's opinions of us
[2:48] I'm grateful that we are being measured
[2:51] by God's word and in our own strength we
[2:54] realize that we could never measure up
[2:56] but because of what he has done on our
[2:59] behalf and because of what he is
[3:01] presently doing in our Inner Man
[3:04] transforming us into His Image then we
[3:07] can measure up to God's standard in this
[3:10] hour let's get right back into the study
[3:12] shall we we were reading in Exodus
[3:17] concerning the Tabernacle and the temple
[3:20] the dimensions the requirements for the
[3:22] material that things were to be made of
[3:24] even the color God even chose the color
[3:28] for the curtains for the for the veils
[3:30] of the Tabernacle God is a meticulous
[3:33] God it helps me to understand that he
[3:36] cares about even the smallest detail in
[3:40] my life and uh that's a blessing to know
[3:43] that nothing happens to me that the Lord
[3:45] is not very much aware of and it must
[3:48] bring Comfort to your heart as well to
[3:50] know that wherever you are in the world
[3:52] you may feel isolated you may feel cut
[3:55] off from the body of Christ at large but
[3:57] you are not alone you are not hidden
[4:01] there God knows you and he knows your
[4:03] need and all you have to do is call on
[4:06] him and he's as close as the mention of
[4:09] his name we also were reading in the
[4:12] Book of Revelation about the instruction
[4:14] that God gave John to measure the temple
[4:18] The Altar and the worshippers so I think
[4:21] we've clearly established the fact that
[4:23] we are under the measuring Rod of the
[4:25] Lord even in this hour um we might could
[4:28] say it like one of the prophets said we
[4:31] are we are being weighed in the balance
[4:33] and found wanting um I truly believe
[4:37] that God is is weighing his bride his
[4:41] body in this hour and that we are not
[4:44] Measuring Up in the way that we should
[4:47] but I do believe that there is a
[4:48] glorious work that's going on on the
[4:51] inside the word is working mightily in
[4:54] us and we are being transformed there is
[4:57] a deep calling to the Deep that's what's
[5:00] going on inside of us right now and
[5:03] little by little step by step we are
[5:06] being changed from glory to glory from
[5:09] Faith to Faith from strength to strength
[5:11] what a wonderful promise we have uh as
[5:15] we have said before if we were left to
[5:17] figure it out on our own we'd just sit
[5:19] down stare at each other and scratch our
[5:21] head we wouldn't even know where to
[5:23] start try to discover what pleases God
[5:26] but he so graciously gave us this word
[5:30] with a little study in history you'll
[5:32] find out that men and women lost their
[5:35] lives to get us this word this written
[5:38] record of God's word many were
[5:41] persecuted and tortured to to preserve
[5:44] this word or because they uh went to
[5:47] such Extreme Measures to to bring us
[5:50] this written record of God's word so I
[5:53] love the Bible I do uh it it Grieves me
[5:57] deeply to see people butcher it try to
[6:00] make it fit their own thoughts to trim
[6:03] away some of the precious truths of
[6:05] God's word to make the Bible fit modern
[6:09] culture or modern society um in my
[6:12] nation in the United States people are
[6:14] being lambasted they're being laughed
[6:17] and at and persecuted for even saying
[6:19] what the Bible says about modern culture
[6:22] or Society or about a lifestyle that
[6:25] that may not be pleasing to God uh and
[6:29] and to speak about it publicly people
[6:31] are being ridiculed they're called
[6:32] bigots and legalists and Prejudiced and
[6:36] haters and uh but I want you to know uh
[6:39] it doesn't matter what what's being said
[6:42] God is going to have a people who will
[6:44] stand for the word no matter what the
[6:46] cost I'd like to go on just a little bit
[6:49] further in this study and I'd like to
[6:51] talk to you about something that was
[6:53] taking place in Ezra the book of Ezra
[6:56] chapter 8 the book of Ezra tells us
[6:59] about the the coming back of the Exiles
[7:03] to Babylon I think most of you remember
[7:06] that Israel was divided at one point
[7:09] into two kingdoms the northern kingdom
[7:12] and the southern Kingdom Israel and
[7:15] Judah Israel was taken captive the
[7:18] northern kingdom was taken captive by
[7:20] the Assyrians and sometime later many
[7:24] years later the southern kingdom was
[7:27] taken captive by the Babylonians and and
[7:29] some 70 years that were spent in
[7:32] Babylonian captivity and it was because
[7:36] of men like zerubabel and Ezra and
[7:39] Nehemiah uh that a that a shift began to
[7:43] take place and the Exiles began to
[7:46] return home in Ezra uh chapter 8 uh Ezra
[7:51] has received a word from the Lord to
[7:53] gather the people together and to number
[7:55] them for the journey and the Bible tells
[7:58] us that some 50 ,000 people and that's
[8:01] not many considering how many thousands
[8:04] were taken away in the Exile of the
[8:07] Southern Kingdom but about 50,000 people
[8:10] gathered at the river in Ezra chapter 8
[8:13] to be numbered of the Lord to prepare
[8:15] for the journey to go home to the land
[8:18] of Israel and to the to the city of
[8:21] Jerusalem of course we know from the
[8:24] from uh reading about Nehemiah and and
[8:28] and we we read about the the awful
[8:31] condition the Fallen condition of the
[8:34] city and so forth but God was faithful
[8:37] and we know that the walls of the city
[8:39] of Jerusalem were restored we read about
[8:42] in the book of Nehemiah the gates were
[8:44] restored and and a beautiful work of
[8:46] restoration took place but in Ezra
[8:49] chapter 8 50,000 people are gathered at
[8:52] the river and let's look at verse 15 and
[8:55] I gathered them together to the river
[8:58] that runneth to to ahava and there Abode
[9:02] we intense three days and I viewed the
[9:05] people and the priests and found there
[9:08] none of the sons of
[9:11] Levi this was very sad because all 12
[9:15] tribes were to be represented in this
[9:19] return because uh after the this may be
[9:23] more detailed than you're after right
[9:24] now but after the Exile of the northern
[9:28] kingdom into a Syria uh there was a
[9:32] steady stream of captives after the
[9:36] Assyrian Empire was destroyed there was
[9:38] a steady stream of of those who had been
[9:41] taken captive that made their way back
[9:43] into Israel to the South so in the
[9:47] southern Kingdom by the time of the
[9:49] Babylonian exile there were all 12
[9:52] tribes represented in the southern
[9:55] Kingdom of Israel what we call Judah and
[9:58] so all 12 tribes were to be represented
[10:01] in this and especially the Levites now
[10:05] now who were the Levites let's remember
[10:07] well Levi was one of the 12 sons of
[10:10] Jacob Joshua 21 speaks about the 48
[10:14] cities that were inhabited by the sons
[10:16] of Levi you'll remember you Bible
[10:19] students will remember that when the
[10:22] land was divided up after Canaan was
[10:24] conquered that all of the tribes were
[10:27] given an inheritance a a portion a
[10:29] parcel of land allotted to their tribe
[10:33] except the sons of Levi that specific
[10:36] division of the priesthood they were
[10:38] given cities but not areas of land and
[10:42] so in Joshua 21 we read about the 48
[10:46] levitical cities the cities that were to
[10:48] be inhabited by the sons of Levi we also
[10:52] know that when the Tabernacle in the
[10:54] wilderness was in place that the sons of
[10:57] Levi camped closest to the Tabernacle
[11:00] they surrounded the Tabernacle when it
[11:03] moved and it was their responsibility we
[11:06] read in Joshua 3: 3 and 4 it was the
[11:10] responsibility of the sons of Levi to
[11:13] carry the Ark of the Covenant at when
[11:16] when they made that Crossing at the
[11:18] Jordan River you'll remember in Joshua
[11:20] chapter 3 so the Levites were given a
[11:23] specific responsibility to maintain the
[11:26] cords and the curtains the poles the
[11:28] boards the bars the badger skins and
[11:31] even the sacred Furniture of the
[11:34] Tabernacle these guys had a lot of Duty
[11:37] had a lot of responsibility and then in
[11:40] Deuteronomy 33:9 and 10 it tells us that
[11:44] they were to be teachers that they were
[11:46] to teach Jacob the judgments the
[11:48] ordinances and the laws of God look what
[11:51] an important responsibility they had
[11:53] there it wasn't just keeping up with the
[11:56] furniture and the instruments they also
[11:59] had had to be Guardians of the
[12:01] instructions of God the ordinances the
[12:04] laws and the judgments of God in 2
[12:07] Chronicles chap 17 and verse 9 uh it
[12:11] says they taught in Judah that's the
[12:14] southern Kingdom they traveled teaching
[12:16] the laws of God that is what constituted
[12:19] the message for that hour what the
[12:21] Levites taught they were teaching the
[12:24] people how to apply the Torah the
[12:27] instruction of God to to to Modern Life
[12:30] to their present situation but when it
[12:33] finally came time for the Exiles to
[12:36] leave Babylon to go home to the land of
[12:40] promise where are the Levites they
[12:43] didn't show up Ezra tells us where are
[12:46] the sons of Levi the holy priesthood of
[12:50] God we have everything and everyone else
[12:52] but the Levites didn't show up I'm
[12:55] telling you that's the hour that we're
[12:57] living in right now there are not not
[12:59] enough men of God there are not enough
[13:02] women of God in the world who are rising
[13:05] up in this hour as the Levites to guard
[13:09] the holy things to guard the sacred
[13:12] things of God to place value on what God
[13:16] has valued to love what God loves to
[13:20] hate what God hates to help teach the
[13:24] people about the measurements of the
[13:27] Lord what God is looking for for in a
[13:30] bride in this hour I think every young
[13:32] man out there when he begins to think
[13:34] about his wife he has a list in his mind
[13:37] of the things that he would like to have
[13:39] in a bride perhaps every young lady does
[13:42] the same thing I don't know how many
[13:45] things on your list you had to to
[13:47] compromise or to give up on uh when you
[13:50] finally found the one that God had
[13:52] chosen for you but I pray that you found
[13:55] the perfect will of God and even if it
[13:57] didn't mark off every
[13:59] uh everything on the list I pray that
[14:02] she's exactly what God wanted for you
[14:04] and he's exactly what God wanted for you
[14:06] but it's all right for us to have some
[14:09] idea of what we would like to have in
[14:12] life I had to give up very very little
[14:14] on my list I always wanted a wife who
[14:17] played the piano and my wife doesn't
[14:20] play the piano but she does a lot of
[14:23] wonderful things other than playing the
[14:25] piano but God has a list and he gives us
[14:28] the list list really it's not a secret
[14:30] list he gives us the list in his word of
[14:34] what he is looking for in a bride but if
[14:37] we don't have the sons of Levi to rise
[14:41] up in this hour and and guard the word
[14:44] of God and guard the truths of God and
[14:49] help us discern between profane and and
[14:52] and blessed we're going to sit here on
[14:55] the other side of the river in Exile
[14:58] we're not going to cross over into what
[15:00] God has called us to in this hour so I'm
[15:03] calling in the spirit a call is going
[15:06] out today that sons of Levi let's pray
[15:10] let's ask the Lord to raise up sons of
[15:12] Levi like never before who will grow so
[15:15] weary with Babylon I pray that the true
[15:19] sons of Levi will get so disgusted with
[15:23] the religious systems of this world that
[15:25] they can't tolerate those denominations
[15:30] uh boundaries any longer man's ideas
[15:33] man's Creeds dogmas so forth I pray that
[15:38] that the men of God the true sons of
[15:40] Levi will grow so disgusted with that
[15:43] stuff that they will have the courage to
[15:47] lead us across the river and back to the
[15:50] promised land but where are they in Ezra
[15:52] chapter 8 they don't even show up
[15:55] they've grown so accustomed to the life
[15:57] of the Babylonians
[15:59] uh which is a life of confusion God
[16:02] doesn't want his bride wandering around
[16:05] in confusion bumping into one another in
[16:07] the dark no sir a glorious light has
[16:11] shined on the word of God in this hour
[16:14] God has restored the truth of the word
[16:16] that was lost through the dark ages of
[16:18] History We Now understand justification
[16:21] by faith we Now understand
[16:23] sanctification by the washing of the
[16:25] water of the word We Now understand that
[16:28] the gifts of the Holy Spirit have been
[16:30] restored to the body and the precious
[16:33] gift of the Holy Ghost has been given
[16:35] back and restored to the church and all
[16:38] truth that was lost Through the Ages has
[16:41] been restored in a glorious message a
[16:44] revelation of Jesus Christ for us and so
[16:47] we have no excuse to stay over here in
[16:50] Babylon uh murmuring about how hard it
[16:53] is to live in Babylon but when the way
[16:55] is made for us to get out we'd rather
[16:57] stay in Babylon
[16:59] I hear the Cry of the spirit that we
[17:01] read about in The Book of Revelation
[17:03] that says come out of her and be
[17:06] separate sayth the Lord God is looking
[17:08] for a holy people and a separated people
[17:11] unto himself what a people that that
[17:15] live by the word a people that have
[17:18] discovered the likes and dislikes of the
[17:21] Living God a people that have found out
[17:24] what God is most concerned about what he
[17:27] loves and what he hates and they have uh
[17:30] agreed they have come into agreement
[17:33] with the with the plan of God we're
[17:35] being measured we're being measured by
[17:37] God's standard in this hour and the
[17:40] problem part of the problem is where are
[17:42] the Levites where are those men of
[17:45] Courage who will swim against the stream
[17:48] they used to say my granny used to talk
[17:50] about a jellyfish out in the ocean has
[17:52] no backbone he just goes wherever the
[17:54] wave tosses him but there's another fish
[17:57] in the in the American streams called
[17:59] the salmon and he's got a backbone all
[18:02] right she's got a backbone that mother
[18:05] will swim against the current for miles
[18:09] and miles and miles and miles to lay her
[18:12] eggs and when she lays them she dies
[18:15] she's wore herself out she doesn't have
[18:18] the strength to to continue to live but
[18:20] she is determined to swim against the
[18:23] current against the circumstances of
[18:26] life to get back to that place where the
[18:28] waters are calm where she can lay her
[18:30] eggs we need some salmon we need some
[18:34] Believers in this hour with a real
[18:36] backbone who'll take a stand for the
[18:38] word of God where are the Levites we
[18:41] need them and now don't you
[18:43] misunderstand me as to say that there
[18:45] are not any we have some men of God who
[18:48] are Towing the mark who are preaching
[18:50] the uncompromised gospel and we need to
[18:52] pray for them like never before that God
[18:55] will strengthen them and use them keep
[18:57] them healthy and strong that Satan will
[19:00] not be successful in breaking their
[19:02] bodies or silencing their voices but we
[19:05] also need to pray that God will raise up
[19:08] many more like them and that many of the
[19:11] sons of Levi those who are truly called
[19:14] to protect the holy things of God and to
[19:16] Value the holy things of God that they
[19:19] will wake up out of their Slumber out of
[19:21] their denominational stuper and be
[19:24] alerted to the sounding of the trumpet
[19:28] in this hour the trumpet is being set to
[19:30] our mouth the prophets are crying out
[19:34] it's time to come back to the word of
[19:38] God like never before enough of this
[19:40] compromise enough of this political
[19:43] correctness enough of this tolerance of
[19:46] sin God is looking for a people who are
[19:49] willing to pay the price the price is
[19:53] surrender the price is not something
[19:55] that you can't afford the price is
[19:58] simply to lay down your will and pick up
[20:01] the word of God and go forth in the
[20:03] power and strength of the holy spirit so
[20:06] there has to be a solution we're go
[20:08] we're getting ready to go back to
[20:10] Jerusalem and the Levites didn't show up
[20:12] those lazy boys where are they and so in
[20:15] verse
[20:17] 21 uh Ezra does something that helps
[20:21] solve the problem in verse 21 he said
[20:24] then I proclaimed a fast there at the
[20:27] river of a ah that we might afflict
[20:30] ourselves before our God to seek of him
[20:33] a right way for us and for our little
[20:36] ones and for all our substance for I was
[20:39] ashamed to require of the king a band of
[20:41] soldiers and Horsemen to help us against
[20:44] the enemy in the way because we had
[20:46] spoken unto the king saying the hand of
[20:48] our God is upon all them for good that
[20:50] seek him but his power and his wrath is
[20:53] against all them that forsake Him verse
[20:55] 23 for so we fast and and besought our
[20:59] God for this and he was intreated of us
[21:03] it was time to pray it was time to fast
[21:05] it was a time to be serious and solemn
[21:08] before the Lord if you could see with
[21:10] the eyes of the spirit the things that
[21:13] are swiftly approaching this world just
[21:15] look at what has happened and multiply
[21:18] that tens of even hundreds of
[21:20] times the the earthquakes the the uh
[21:25] political Uprising the slaughter of the
[21:29] innocent the the trouble of Civil War in
[21:32] Nations the threat of nuclear war uh all
[21:37] of the things that are uh falling on
[21:40] this Earth in a measure now will soon
[21:42] fall upon this planet without
[21:45] restraint and you're going to want to
[21:47] know that you're sheltered In The Arms
[21:49] Of God that you have found the Pavilion
[21:51] of the Lord safety and you're also going
[21:54] going to want to know that you're doing
[21:57] everything you can for the kingom
[21:59] look listen souls are dying and going to
[22:01] hell where are the Levites the church is
[22:04] backsliding and looking and acting more
[22:07] like the world every day where are the
[22:09] Levites it's time to fast and pray that
[22:12] God will raise them up in this hour
[22:15] there was a priesthood that was needed
[22:18] to handle and weigh out the silver and
[22:21] the gold if you look down to verse
[22:25] 25 uh as he began to to set some of
[22:28] these priest aside in verse 25 and he
[22:31] weighed unto them the silver and the
[22:32] gold and the vessels even the offerings
[22:35] of the House of our God which the king
[22:37] and his counselors and his Lords and all
[22:39] Israel their present had offered and he
[22:41] began to weigh it out and it was up to
[22:43] the priest to be able to weigh these
[22:46] things out and to handle in verse 28 and
[22:50] I said unto them ye Are Holy unto the
[22:52] Lord the vessels are holy also and the
[22:54] silver and the gold are a free will
[22:56] offering unto the Lord God of your
[22:58] father fathers watch ye and keep them
[23:01] until you weigh them before the chief of
[23:03] the priest and the Levites and the chief
[23:05] of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem in
[23:07] the chambers of the house of the Lord
[23:09] verse 30 so the so took the priest and
[23:12] the Levites they showed up here they
[23:16] appear they showed up why do you think
[23:19] they showed up because the rest of the
[23:21] people were fasting and praying for the
[23:23] Lord's help so took the priest and the
[23:26] Levites the weight of the silver and the
[23:28] gold and the vessels to bring them to
[23:30] Jerusalem unto the house of our God we
[23:33] couldn't take these gold valuable
[23:36] vessels and put them in untrustworthy
[23:38] hands it had to be Levites it had to be
[23:42] priests that were trained to Value what
[23:45] God values to protect what God has
[23:50] valued it had to be those men because
[23:52] when they measured it on this side of
[23:55] the river in Babylon the measurement had
[23:57] to be exact exactly the same when we got
[24:00] over to Jerusalem and if if if just if
[24:03] just Common Street people were carrying
[24:07] those vessels what is to say that one of
[24:09] them wouldn't have uh sold one along the
[24:12] way or thrown one aside because it was
[24:15] too heavy in his backpack but not the
[24:17] Levites they would have seen the value
[24:20] they would have known the importance of
[24:23] getting those sacred vessels of God back
[24:26] to Jerusalem oh help me pray for the
[24:29] Levites to show up in this hour uh so
[24:33] verse 29 says watch ye and keep them
[24:36] until so God is raising up that's what's
[24:39] going to happen when we cry out Levites
[24:42] are going to be raised up in this hour
[24:44] who will watch and keep guard and keep
[24:48] those holy things we need that anointing
[24:51] we we need to treasure the things that
[24:53] are sacred and holy to God the valuable
[24:56] truths that have been passed down to us
[25:01] we are so blessed in this hour We're
[25:04] blessed with technology to preserve the
[25:06] word of God to take the message of the
[25:09] prophets and preserve it and keep it and
[25:11] listen I want to tell you this any man
[25:14] who calls himself a prophet and his
[25:16] message doesn't line up with this word
[25:18] of God he is not a prophet he's a false
[25:21] prophet any Pastor who calls himself a
[25:24] true servant of the Lord and his message
[25:27] doesn't line up with with this book he's
[25:29] not a true Pastor he's a false Shepherd
[25:33] if we're going to be the mouthpiece of
[25:35] God in this hour everything we bring
[25:38] today has to line up it has to to fit in
[25:42] with God's measuring device this is
[25:45] God's yard stick that he's putting I
[25:48] almost picked my Bible up and put it
[25:49] over my head but I don't know how the
[25:51] camera angle would get that but we're
[25:53] under the word how about I just do it
[25:56] this way we're under the word the word
[25:59] is over us we're being measured by this
[26:02] word but we're also being strengthened
[26:05] and fed by this word sustained by the
[26:09] precious word of God the pure revelation
[26:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ I just say Lord
