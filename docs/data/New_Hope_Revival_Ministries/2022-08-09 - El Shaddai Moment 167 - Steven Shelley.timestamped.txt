[0:00] god breathes on you
[0:02] [Music]
[0:04] it changes everything
[0:13] you'd better take your stand
[0:17] this is an hour to take your stand
[0:22] you want to make sure that you have had
[0:25] a personal experience with god for
[0:29] yourself
[0:30] god breathes on you
[0:32] [Music]
[0:34] it changes everything
[0:36] it's the addition of the ruach
[0:40] hakodesh
[0:42] in hebrew the holy spirit
[0:45] when when uh god appeared to abram he
[0:48] said i am el shaddai
[0:52] he was breathing his life
[0:54] on abram
[0:56] changing his name from avram to avraham
[1:01] so that his name would forever
[1:04] bear in it the breath
[1:07] of the name
[1:09] of god
[1:11] avram was having a personal experience
[1:16] with a living god
[1:19] it changed his life forever you must
[1:23] have your own experience with god
[1:28] [Music]
[1:30] so please take this in balance
[1:34] and understand that at the end of the
[1:36] road you cannot defeat the devil with a
[1:40] vision
[1:42] you cannot defeat the devil with a dream
[1:46] with a prophecy with a message in
[1:49] tongues
[1:51] but you can
[1:52] defeat the devil every day every minute
[1:56] of the day with the word
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] so our salvation is not based on a
[2:04] feeling
[2:06] it's based on the word
[2:08] it's not based on an experience
[2:12] it's based on the word
[2:14] but without a personal experience you
[2:18] have never encountered the living god
[2:22] you are not born from above
[2:28] you are not born from above unless
[2:30] you've met him
[2:33] like abram met him because one of the
[2:36] meanings of el shaddai
[2:39] is the many breasted one
[2:42] he is the mini-breasted one
[2:44] do you understand that's how abraham met
[2:46] him
[2:47] now that's more than an experience
[2:50] that's god's saying i am carrying
[2:53] all you need
[2:57] lay your head son
[2:59] on my bosom
[3:02] and you will never be needy again
[3:07] when when god said to
[3:09] abraham
[3:10] i am el shaddai
[3:13] and i'm here to change your life
[3:15] and change your name
[3:17] and give you a destiny that you don't
[3:19] know anything about
[3:21] he said that in saying
[3:24] or identifying himself as el shaddai i
[3:28] am the god that can do for you
[3:32] what you cannot do for yourself
[3:37] that's who he is
[3:39] i am the god
[3:41] who can do for you
[3:43] what you cannot do for yourself i'm the
[3:45] god who can provide for you what you
[3:48] cannot provide for yourself you can't
[3:50] nurse your own breasts
[3:53] but he said i've got
[3:55] everything you have need of come lay
[3:58] your head abram
