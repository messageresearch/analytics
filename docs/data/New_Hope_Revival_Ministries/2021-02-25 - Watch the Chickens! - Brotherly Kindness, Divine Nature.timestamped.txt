[0:04] that we've wrapped it so tight we've cut
[0:05] off the flow of god
[0:06] [Music]
[0:14] we as the bride of christ we've wrapped
[0:16] ourselves in a
[0:18] blanket of predestination
[0:19] [Music]
[0:22] we've gotten secure in our
[0:24] predestination
[0:26] that we've wrapped it so tight we've cut
[0:27] off the flow of god

[0:38] and and my family is good and i'm
[0:40] predestinated
[0:41] and i'm wrapping up in my security
[0:43] blanket and nobody can take that from me
[0:45] because
[0:46] i'm predestinated but we've we've gotten
[0:48] to a place that we forgot about other
[0:50] people
[0:51] we we were so consumed with ourself that
[0:54] we forgot about other people
[0:56] that that maybe haven't got to that
[0:58] place yet maybe they haven't got into
[1:00] that that
[1:01] arc of safety yet they're still standing
[1:03] outside of the door
[1:05] who's going to lead them in you know are
[1:08] you
[1:09] if you're so consumed in your
[1:11] predestination
[1:13] are you are you in a position that you
[1:15] can lead somebody to christ
[1:17] or if you stuck yourself off in a corner
[1:20] and just said i'm i'm secure
[1:22] i'm secure i'm safe god's taking care of
[1:24] me we
[1:25] i don't know if anybody here has
[1:26] chickens anybody y'all have any chickens
[1:29] we have some chickens at home and i love
[1:31] to watch
[1:32] i love to watch chickens whenever it's
[1:34] warmer i can sit outside and watch them
[1:36] but
[1:36] right now it's a bit cold um but
[1:40] chickens are funny but i've learned some
[1:42] things i i read in job where he said
[1:44] you can learn things from the beast you
[1:46] can you know so i i didn't feel out of
[1:48] place whenever i i kind of got a little
[1:50] lesson
[1:50] sitting out there watching my chickens
[1:52] in the evening well think about chickens
[1:54] they
[1:55] they they like to get up in there in
[1:56] their nest that's their place of safety
[1:59] you know so at the end of the day you
[2:00] can let them out they'll be free-ranging
[2:03] at the end of the day they all start
[2:04] getting closer and closer
[2:06] to their coop and the run and then one
[2:09] by one
[2:09] they'll go in they'll climb up inside
[2:12] and once they're up inside
[2:14] that's where they are until the next
[2:15] morning whenever the sun comes out and
[2:17] they'll come out one by one
[2:19] and i was sitting out there brother
[2:20] steve one day just sitting at the chair
[2:22] just watching them
[2:23] peck around and everything and as it was
[2:24] getting close to dart
[2:26] most of them went in we have 11. so
[2:29] two of them were still outside
[2:32] they were they were just milling around
[2:35] completely oblivious
[2:36] to the rest that had already went inside
[2:38] and got up in the coop
[2:40] and so they're running around and
[2:41] chasing little bugs and stuff and
[2:43] and in one it's it was like it all of a
[2:45] sudden had an epiphany and it
[2:47] like it starts moving his head around
[2:50] and says
[2:51] wait a minute where's everybody going so
[2:53] it makes a beeline
[2:55] goes inside the little door and and runs
[2:58] inside and goes up
[2:59] and the last one had been running back
[3:03] and forth
[3:04] along the run it runs about 25 feet long
[3:07] and it was going back and forth back and
[3:09] forth
[3:09] running past the door couldn't find its
[3:12] way in
[3:14] and i was sitting there i was like maybe
[3:15] i should go down there
[3:17] and try to encourage it to go in because
[3:19] it was almost dark
[3:22] and then something strange happened i
[3:24] hadn't seen it before
[3:27] one of the other hens climbed down
[3:30] down the ramp come back over because
[3:33] it's not the door wasn't directly in
[3:35] line with it
[3:36] came out of the coop came over and stood
[3:38] in the doorway
[3:41] and as that the other hand the loose one
[3:43] was out
[3:44] it came past it it got its attention and
[3:46] it followed inside
[3:48] then it went down and locked the door
[3:50] and i was like wow
[3:52] that's amazing there was one
[3:56] that was left outside couldn't find its
[3:58] way back in
[4:00] and one that was safe that was in its
[4:04] place of security
[4:06] came out got itself a little bit outside
[4:09] of the norm
[4:10] got itself out of its security blanket
[4:13] and stood next to the door
[4:15] to lead that one in and i
[4:19] about had to rejoice in fit because i'm
[4:21] i'm sitting there singing
[4:22] that that's the way it was for me
[4:26] i couldn't find myself i couldn't find
[4:28] my own way
[4:31] but god could and you could you could go
[4:36] buy this this if this is a doorway you
[4:38] could go buy it
[4:39] and buy it and buy it and your your mind
[4:41] is so confused
[4:42] that you can't receive it you can't see
[4:44] it you don't understand that
[4:46] this is the way i need to go but
[4:48] somebody comes
[4:50] and they step down and they take you by
[4:53] the hand and they say
[4:55] come on come on
[4:58] this is your place of safety this this
[5:01] is the way to get back to christ
[5:04] i i sat there and cried because i
[5:07] watched a chicken
[5:09] give me a lesson on how i should be
[5:13] and i realize that too many times we're
[5:15] not standing close enough to the door
[5:18] we're not close enough to christ because
[5:21] he is our door and if you can get closer
[5:25] to him
[5:26] you'll be able to lead somebody to him
[5:29] don't get so wrapped up in your own your
[5:31] own problems and
[5:32] and your own in your own ideas and your
[5:36] own situations that you're going through
[5:38] in that self-centeredness that
[5:39] egocentric attitude
[5:41] get yourself close to christ he is the
[5:44] door
[5:44] if you're standing next to the door you
[5:47] become that door
[5:49] and you can open it and you can allow
[5:51] them to come in
[5:52] to a place of safety
