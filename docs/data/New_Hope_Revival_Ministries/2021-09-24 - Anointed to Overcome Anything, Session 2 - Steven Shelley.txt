enjoyed ourselves in the presence of the lord last night and tonight we're growing in number and tomorrow night we're going to stretch a little more than that but we didn't come to see who would be here we didn't come as much as we loved brother brooks we didn't just come to see him we came to hear from the lord and i know he's here i'm like brother greeley said i know he's here because i brought him with me when i came and i'm not going to go back and say over everything that brother greeley has already said but you're very welcome we are so happy to have you all here tonight we believe that you're going to hear from the lord and that's why we're really here is to hear from the lord and i don't want to uh you know somebody said you sing this and you sing that but tonight we're going to let brother brooks have all the time that he needs to sing who'd want to sing when you when you've got a preacher here that can sing and preach we ought to just work him hard yes really i even had him to ask the blessing at lunch i just said it's time for him to start working while he's here but would you stand with me all over this room again i know you're up and down a lot but that's just part of being in a bible service and we're just again so thankful for the times that brother brooks has come to us from iowa and uh my friendship and with brother brooks goes back a long time when i was living in south carolina he was living in south carolina and he extended a hand of friendship to me and i he and brother henry simmons and i have never forgotten it then he was in ohio and i went up and preached for him while he was pastoring in ohio and then he moved to another country to iowa and i haven't seen him in iowa but a few years ago the lord made a way and put it in our heart to have brother brooks and now we just don't think we can have a camp meeting without him but we are so blessed i want you to raise your hand toward god's servant right now and i want you to ask that god would let his holy anointing fall on him from the top of his head lord to the souls of his feet and lord even though he'll be ministering to some tonight he's never ministered to let there be no awkwardness in this house but lord just let him flow as the holy spirit is poured out upon his life and i ask you to use every gift that you have placed in him for the glory of god and lord let your word flow through him and then we ask you to confirm your word by bringing it to pass in our lives we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it all in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen brother brooks would you mind to come without a song you bring the song we won't sing a song to bring you but we'll let you come let's thank god for the lord's servant be with us [Music] [Applause] amen you got you made it difficult for me to stay back there i i didn't have to but uh i chose to uh just feeling the presence of the lord it's been a a wonderful thing

uh we're dealing with victory that's a victory and how god brought her and we had a good flight coming uh we knew and uh we could feel really the prayers of the saints and we thank all of you who have prayed and been praying for us yes like our brother shelley said he has been a friend for years and uh we appreciate him to the most to the highest he and his family just think i knew him before he

[Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we also want to thank god for brother greeley and his wife they came to the airport to pick us up they were willing to drive all the way to iowa and every time i thought about it i felt pain and i didn't want him to feel that pain like no so a long way so i'm so thankful that the lord blessed we could get him by on the wings of an eagle [Laughter] [Music] amen we thank god for his desire my wife uh and i both felt that same way that uh that's just a little bit too long and you know coming to a meeting uh we want him to enjoy as much as i would want to be able to preach so we thank god for the grace of god and i am there's so many things that i i really want to say but we're going to get right into the word of god and words cannot express my gratitude but as we stand we're just going to get have you read a few scripture i believe that we're living in a day i love fire i love fire i'm disturbed when i don't see fire i'm disturbed when the fire is not firing up in me and and i'm disturbed when i don't see the fire in the believer [Music] we're living in the most glorious time ever and the bible tells us to lift up our heads when you see the day approaching you supposed to come together the more one thing i can truly say about those old pentecostal churches you had service almost every night something was going on in reality you didn't have time to sin [Laughter] hallelujah but uh i i wondered within myself lord why did you let me use so many of my what i considered my valuable years and the lord spoke to me and and said as he preserved israel in egypt he preserved me and every time i think about that i think about the many times that i could have been dead but god protected me even when i didn't even know him his goodness and mercy followed me all the days of my life we're going to ask that you turn with us to romans i've got three passages of scripture here my ipad i used to have an ipad but somebody stole my iwatch and then i tried to find my eye watching couldn't find uh remember my ipad password so microsoft locked it up and i had to find a receipt and it took me a while to find a receipt but i had to go all the way back to lima and then when i got the receipt they told me that everything on my ipad was erased so this is my new ipad so we praise the lord amen it still works amen as we stand let us turn to romans the 8th chapter we're going to read a passage of scripture there the 28th verse ephesians 1 11 and 2nd timothy 1 and 9. you love the lord romans 8 i trust everybody's there 8-28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose i love that word called and i love that word purpose that's really good ephesians 1 11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and i like that word worketh that means to continue to work ii timothy 1 and 9. and i read these things out of order but i thought i had it's okay it's all it's all fine second timothy one and nine who saved us [Music] and called us with an holy calling not according to our own works that's the part i like but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began let us pray our gracious father we come before you lord jesus as humbly as we know how i thank you for being so good to us without you lord where would we be coming to know lord who you are and your purpose in me has been the greatest of all revelations and lord i pray tonight that you would bless the service in a special way break and destroy every yoke yes sir even as our sister song that song about breakthrough because there are many still need a breakthrough amen we've come in a time oh god where darkness is gathering at a rapid speed but father you are a god of contrast and you said you've never left yourself without a witness lord we believe that we are your witnesses but father you know even as a witness we cannot do anything without your leadership and your power bless us here this evening as we come in jesus christ's name the only name the only true name the only living name of god in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we we want to build up by by god's grace we'll try to just give what god wants us to give tonight as i said i'm nobody i'm just a servant of the lord i don't say that to try to be humble i say that because it's true and when i think about salvation and how god saved me there is no way i can even understand or even come to the understanding of why because i wasn't the best of sinners i was the worst and the thing about it is that there was something about me that i did not recognize but it took the message to bring that out of me because no matter how bad i was and you know with all of the things that i did do in life there was always a respect for god i can remember even when i was a young boy in sunday school singing yes jesus loved me and i would sing that song with all my heart and one of the things that i did not you see another one of the things that god revealed to me even before i committed my life to him was that jesus christ is god i was in a baptist church and i never saw and understood trinity i always saw god i can't even explain it but when i prayed to jesus christ i knew i was praying to god it is important that we come to know who we are it's time out for guesswork but we must know that we are called with a holy calling yes sir we're living in a time where people are falling and failing people are giving up giving up something that i cannot even imagine how do you give up how do you give up i always encourage my church don't give up on god because god won't give up on you hallelujah living in a day when the book is open [Music] it's no longer closed it's no longer given to man's interpretation because god in these last days have come to interpret his own word talking about anointed to to overcome that's the theme anything i believe i know it's true hallelujah and we must understand who's in control hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord hallelujah let me read a few scriptures here isaiah 40 and 26 you don't have to turn there lift up your eyes on high and behold who have created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth all by name by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one failing why say it thou o jacob and speak it o israel my way is heared from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god has thou not known hallelujah has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fadeth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding in other words if you are going to know him he's got to reveal himself to you hallelujah because let me say it like this god is just as weak as your understanding of him i'm going to say it again god is just as weak as your understanding of him if god can't do everything god won't do everything you understand me if you think god can't do everything then god won't do anything hallelujah so you say well what do you mean brother brooks we're living in a time where god is not looking for cowards he's looking for those who will take this storm and walk through it hallelujah is that right this is the day we're living in we're living in the day of adoption we're living in the day of the full world we're living in the day where the sons of god is to be made manifest hallelujah this is the reason why god sent us malachi 4. hallelujah like i was telling my church the prophet of god said the move of uh the move is on for the bride and many people puts it like this they said the move is on the bride no the move is on for the bride everything that you see around you everything is working on your behalf hallelujah the darkness is pulling together why because light must be shown hallelujah amen and we're living in the most evil age ever oh yeah but god has pulled us out hallelujah into an eternal age by the baptism of the holy ghost somebody help me here tonight because you must realize amen that we're not quitters we're winners hallelujah you say when did you win i won before the foundation of the world hallelujah yes sir yes sir i was in his mind and you were in his mind and he brought you here to put the devil under your feet hallelujah oh yes his purpose god always has a purpose hallelujah a lot of times people don't understand that even when god created or made the serpent he made the serpent for a purpose hallelujah come on somebody he made adam and eve and there was a purpose oh my god when i look at all of the shadows and types and things of the word of god you know when god opened those seals he opened also this the meaning of those stories that we saw in the book all the shadows and types was there and then what was he doing he was showing us who we really are and what we need to do instead of running from the devil we need to step into the book you understand me we must become amen what the books say we are hallelujah let me move on by god's grace when you realize that you're serving a god they cannot be stopped hallelujah amen death couldn't stop him somebody helped me here you see the romans they thought they could stop him they couldn't stop him hallelujah and you see nothing can stop god you say why because the bible said when the word is spoken it cannot come back void hallelujah listen but it says we're going through a time but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings with the knee as an ego they should run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint is that all right so you got to understand the word has been spoken the problem is is that people don't know how to worship the word hallelujah because you got to understand the word is god and when you hear the scripture that's when you're supposed to get excited hallelujah it's all right for the music to excite you it's all right for singing and shouting that's good excitement but when the world is being preached that's the thing that's supposed to excite you hallelujah because that's what that's what worshiping the word is hallelujah people say no no no let me tell you something i like it i've got a brother he's like a lion and i tell you when when i'm preaching he's up he's not worried about nobody else hallelujah he's praising god and pulling on the gift and yes why because he know if he pull is that right el shaddai is going to give him something hallelujah the blessed one is going to give him something so the more you pull the more you get hallelujah stop looking at this veil don't look at the veil see that's what happened in jesus day they look at the veil and they miss god hallelujah like i was trying to tell the people the other day i say the throne room always moves hello it moves and what people don't understand everybody's looking up here when god has come down here hallelujah is that the truth you are designed everything about you amen speaks of the word is that right your five fingers represents the five uh uh ministries of god is that right you got to understand that this these two eyes amen that we see is the only new testament prophets hallelujah but you put them together and they see one vision oh come on somebody when you see your heart it has four chambers hallelujah the four living creatures and right in the midst of the four living creatures where where is where god dwells hallelujah that's why the bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he holly is that the truth then you've got the 24 elders 24 reals [Music] hallelujah come on somebody and what they're doing they're protecting hallelujah the heart the throne room is what they are protecting y'all hear what i'm saying everything that moses designed was a shadow and a type of you hallelujah hallelujah yes yes yes and when god is not on the throne it's judgment but when he's on the throne of your heart he comes down shouting grace grace hallelujah is that all right so let's move on by the grace of god so we look at these things and we say well brother brooks what are you saying in these last days we've come through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost and that baptism of the holy ghost makes room for god himself is that right it's not another holy ghost it's the same holy ghost hallelujah but god is maturing himself in you is that right oh it's the truth that means amen you've got to go through some sufferings and people don't want to suffer but jesus said if you're going to be a follower of me take up your cross and follow me everybody has a cross to bear you want to be a winner let me back it up a little bit i was dealing with purpose you know there had to be a thomas edison because of the he created the lights yeah and god knew we were going to need lice hallelujah is that right god knew you needed christopher columbus because in his mind america was here hallelujah oh come on somebody i'm going to say some things that people may not understand what i'm saying but slavery even played its part because on the days of zuzu street god had a purpose y'all hear me now if he had stayed over there in africa god's purpose would not have been met but in the mind of god god saw seymour somebody help me here oh you say purpose that's why the prophet of god was mixed had a little indian had a little irish and and what was the other one but anyway his character his makeup was put together in that way so he could be the elijah for our day y'all hear what i'm saying let me say it like this god did not make a mistake when he made you hallelujah everything about you god designed in his mind before the foundation of the world y'all better hear what i'm saying thousands of years you traveled from the garden of eden even up to this day oh somebody help me here and no matter how many germs met that egg they could not break it they couldn't go through it it wasn't designed for them but when you came along somebody help me here and this is what i tell people i said if it's a million to one and i made it in the natural birth what about now hallelujah what about now listen people they're falling away but god has given us grace to stand hallelujah why because you have been ordained to make this rapture hallelujah glory to god hallelujah don't get discouraged because even in your natural they died hallelujah but at the end of the road you penetrated sister we had a breakthrough [Laughter] even then and if we had a breakthrough then we're going to have the breakthrough now nothing can stop it hallelujah oh my i'm holding the victory in me that's my subject you are holding the victory in you hallelujah so when it looks like you can't go any further turn to the victory somebody help me here see because you're packing something and the devil is trying to keep you from knowing what you got hallelujah but my holy ghost is more than a dance my holy ghost is greater than a shout yes somebody help me my holy ghost is more than just a supplier but my holy ghost is god himself you hear me hallelujah your god and my god it's the god of creation and at his name every knee must bow hallelujah see what people don't understand is that we have a lost we oh we say jesus we say jesus christ but we don't say it with the revelation of what the name is y'all hear what i'm saying everybody say jesus but they don't say it with the revelation but when you say it with the revelation of who he is something has to happen hallelujah if you say jesus and in that word you're speaking with hope it won't work but when you speak jesus and you know that he said you can move mountains the mountains must move oh lord see that's what i'm talking about this is nothing something that is nothing that's so deep but listen we come to a place and you say well brother brooks what are you trying to tell us see throughout the church ages they mixed the word they hybrided it and because they did that it stopped having the effect that it used to have hallelujah and god is calling for a virtuous bride is that right he's calling for someone that's going to believe is that the truth now somebody says i am saved from sin what do you mean oh i don't smoke anymore i don't drink no that's not it i am saved and when that word saved from sin means unbelief that it i am saved from unbelief that means as a christian i must always believe hallelujah that's why the man of god said sang that song only believe only believe all things are possible hallelujah because when you believe when you really believe the eyes of the blind is open hallelujah is that right the dead is raised hallelujah is that right every disease must bow to the name of jesus christ every disease and god put you here and he came to occupy your heart so he could speak through you hallelujah god could have come down he didn't have to use moses god could have come down and spoke himself but you see when god really comes down we most of us we become afraid [Music] is that right remember when they say lord moses we want to hear we want to hear god speak and when god came down they heard the thunder they saw the lightning and you know what they said shut him up shut him up we're afraid of that let us let god speak through a prophet and that's when god spoke through moses hallelujah and that's that's how god speaks today hallelujah of the lord amen let's move on by god's grace i'm trying to set a foundation because if i can if i could just get us if if god could just allow us to say lord i really believe [Music] but what hinders us is that we let our five senses get in the way we look at circumstances and you know that's not abraham's seed abraham seed called those things that be not as though they were hallelujah is that right see if you can see it you can receive it let me put it this way if you can see it you can have it hallelujah i'm not talking about seeing it with your uh yo yo how can i say it it must become real to you so much so that your vision can see it when you can see it you can have it see that's the thing what it is a lot of time people i want the holy ghost and many of us has never been to calvary go to calvary when you're praying go to calvary let him take you step by step take you through the crucifixion and i guarantee you you'll get something hello somebody if you can envision calvary if you can see jesus hallelujah you will get something and that would be the holy ghost hallelujah but a lot of time we we call on jesus because we want a sensation and that's uh that's all that all that's all good but that can be deceptive too deceiving too you want a change that's what i try to tell people we come to church for a change or change people it's good to have good times but we come for change change me oh god hallelujah changed me hallelujah hallelujah is that all right when i look and see what god has done let me move on and when god broke those seals open a lot of times people look at the cloud people fuss about it you know they say all manner of things and what people don't understand that was prophecy it was always in the word hallelujah but in that time it was a change god was moving on hallelujah don't get me wrong he never told you to stop shouting he never told you to stop dancing but he did tell you you must mature hallelujah that's what it was all about to take those pentecostal babies and bring them to a maturity until they come into the very image and likeness of god now everybody didn't see him then and everybody won't see him now hallelujah but in that time [Music] it was a historical time even the prophet god fully didn't even understand it at that time and as he went on he began to show us amen there was a serious thing that took place here people and you got to get it because listen you got to move on you got to move on and i'm not saying you're not there i'm just saying you got to move on if you're not there you understand what i'm saying it's not it's not good enough what what god is looking for he's looking for a perfect man with the divine nature of god hallelujah he's looking for a vessel that he can dwell in and speak through y'all hear what i'm saying oh oh let me let me let me say it like this do you know let's say like this when a king orders something it it must come to pass it has to be obeyed now we've got all kinds of word all of the word in in the old in the old testament as well and and types and shadows and i never understood even in the day you know as it was in the days of noah you know when when that was read i i could always see the violence and all of the corrupt stuff that went in the day that was done in the days of noah but i i didn't see god and there he was he said when the son of man is revealed i'm not talking about a i'm talking about v right god hidden in human flesh hallelujah i remember driving one of my cars one time and i hired your plane and i always wondered if i was to get in a car accident or something would happen to me on on an instant where god where would god be but i could remember as i was turning the van was turning and i thought by god's grace i thought this 18-wheeler is going to hit me and i'm going to die but let me tell you something god is my witness when i thought that the holy spirit filled that place he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you y'all hear what i'm saying even in that time he showed up y'all hear what i'm saying hallelujah we've got to arm ourselves with faith you got to know who you are everybody's so afraid of this corona and this whatever yes yes nobody want to catch the flu and i'm sure nobody wants to catch the measles but god still hears flu and he still can heal the measles and the bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous and god delivered them out of them all he does not say you won't get it but he said he'll be a deliverer [Applause] hallelujah and listen when you know god ain't through with you yet you've got every right to fight you hear what i'm saying don't lay down to the devil when you know god is not through with you yet you fight and god will join in the battle hallelujah yes let me tell you believe us satan is so afraid of you he is so afraid of you he is so afraid you're going to catch it well let me tell him wherever he might be hallelujah too late hallelujah why because it's been spoken it's already been spoken this bride will be the writer she is and will come into perfection hallelujah glory to god hallelujah i'm depending on him brother i have nothing else to rest on but i'm resting on his word he said it i believe it he made the promise hallelujah i have the victory in me i got the victory in me you know what the victory is is resurrection power the bible says they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day noah entered into the ark and where was god where was god you think god was in the heavens you think god was on the balcony somewhere i'll tell you where he was did y'all know where he was he was in the ark is that right if he was not in the ark he would say go in the ark but he was in the ark and he told noah come on in the yard oh come on somebody if he said come on in he must have been there too oh help us jesus so we understand that noah did not go through that rough time by himself people say how did noah bring animals in because during that time god took those animals and he listened this revelation he changed their nature so the lion could lay down with the lamb hallelujah y'all hear me let me say it like this when those seals were open john said i heard the voice and he thought it was a lion right but when he heard the lion the bible said he turned to see the voice and you know what he saw a lamb why did he see a lamb what was the purpose of the lamb because you were now entering into another age it wasn't just the eagle the lion the ox or the man now it's the age of the lamb [Music] oh come on somebody the prophet of god preached it we're talking about the nature divine nature the divine nature was a lamb if a lamb gonna get married it'd have to marry a lamb it ain't marrying an iron it's not manner of an eagle the mate of a lion a lamb is a lamb hallelujah this is the age you must forfeit all of your rights oh help us lord is that the word people you must understand you got to forfeit all your rights lead me to calvary right lest i forget thou throne crown brow y'all understand me what we're now moving into is the changing of your nature from a goat to a lamb that's oh come on you say well what do you i'm just going to preach i'ma leave those notes alone you got to realize by god's grace that in this message this word is living you think oh i'm just reading a book maybe if you just with that attitude that's all you're reading but if you in the anointing the anointing that comes from those words will change you yes sir hallelujah you say well what do you mean remember when they took they took ammo's rod and what work did aaron have to the rod have to do once the rod was put behind the veil and that's what this message is this message is the word that's come from behind the veil that's the christ that's the eternal word y'all hear what i'm saying laid that rod out there and all that rod had to do was lay in the presence of the sun come on somebody that's why you must read that's why you must study that's why you must all come on and bring this with it hallelujah i was in my kitchen i can't remember what i was doing at the time sometimes the lord just talked to you before you say anything to him have you had you ever had he just starts the conversation oh come on somebody and jesus the lord said to me he said you are that book yes sir i couldn't understand it he said you are the book and i'm like i'm the book he said yes he said i told john eat the book and you are what you eat [Applause] hallelujah now you got to understand where i'm coming from because i want you to understand once you take him in hallelujah you take in the full word that's why in the book of revelation he says i am the alpha and the omega i'm the beginning and i'm the end you take in the full word and when you take in the full word you have the full abilities you have the potential of the whole book hallelujah you understand what i'm saying that's why death won't be able to hold my body down hallelujah why because we have the resurrection on the inside oh you say well show me a shout show me something here remember remember throughout the church ages i'm kind of jumping here throughout the church ages all the way up from if ephesus the the word of prophecy says i'm coming i'm coming i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that but in laodicea it wasn't so he says i now stand at the door and knock hallelujah so he's no longer in heaven he's come and he's standing at the door to knock and he said brother lam said it like this it was a knock into the church ages is that right and if any man open i will come in and sup with him come anywhere to your heart into your soul in there is where i come and i'll sup oh come on somebody that is the word hallelujah so we thank god for every building that we have that we assembly symbol in but in reality you are the church you're the tabernacle of god that's the bible says that know ye not that you are the temple of god [Applause] amen getting back all that rod had to do was lay there hallelujah and i love this because you know we found out that in there was the bride because you got a female tree and you got a male tree and the female tree is the one that brings forth the fruits aaron had no idea that he was working with a female he had no idea that that rod was a symbolism of the bride you hear what i'm saying all they had to do was lay in the shekinah glory and god did the rest yes you hear what i'm saying your lord i want to overcome lay in the presence lay there cry out pray let those men the ministry of the voice of that's in the voice off the tape let them minister you let your pastor minister you that's god laying in lane you know what i'm saying let me tell you something some of y'all who i don't like chewing gum but some do hallelujah and you don't you don't throw the gum away right off you get all the juices out all the sweetness and sometimes you even carry it on when it ain't sweet because you just love the way it pops hallelujah you understand me that's the way the word you're supposed to chew on the word like a cow with this cud eat it up bring it up eat it right when somebody's looking at you and you haven't been to church in a while but you're still chewing hallelujah you see what i'm saying circumstances have stopped you from coming to church but you've got enough in you where you can bring it all remember what pastor said oh remember what the word says oh you see see because when i hear a message i don't hear it one time i hear it and i hear it and i hear it and i hear it and you know what i don't hear it from my head i hear it from my heart i say change me that's me i want to be that's me that's me lord bring me to that place break and you know what god has to do it you understand me people from this night on don't go out here like a loser hallelujah oh these these are these are these are little lessons we should have known we should know that god is going to always provide hallelujah he even care about your income tax lord i ain't got enough lord i need to pay caesar god said go fishing hallelujah you tell me god can't i'm telling you before i came to this message before i knew anything about creation i wish the sisters still live but she's going on to be with glory i trust you know but the thing is i needed just a little bit of money and uh anyway to make a long story short we were down in the basement of the church and i was just talking and telling the sister i needed a money to put in the phone booth y'all remember phone booths yeah i didn't have change for the phone booth and all of a sudden this light the light roll out of the corner it rolled this way and it rolled and it rolled and it rolled in like a like a corn and it stopped and when it stopped it was money enough to put in the phone booth i didn't know nothing about no creation i didn't know but he was still creator i was in a system didn't know but i believe god y'all hear what i'm saying like my sister was talking about the gate opener i believe that right you see things that and god does things and and sometimes we're so busy we don't catch it hallelujah but in everything give thanks y'all hear me so i know what god can do i've seen him create i've seen him raise the dead twice hallelujah being in this message believing this word i saw jesus come on the scene oh come on you don't have to believe it hallelujah but i'ma tell you what the true bride of christ she knows when her husband is talking oh as it was in the days of noah i i just let me out this is the point i want to say remember the denominations had crucified the lord afresh is that right so much so he was put out now if he was crucified that means there had to come a resurrection a death burial and resurrection and this is why brother branham preached the message it is the rising of the son [Music] oh god now something took place because after he preached it there was a rising there was a ministry change you understand me something took place because once it was an open show when jesus was alive it was an open show the pharisees the sadducees the baptists the methods everybody saw what god was doing and they call it a devil they crucified him is that right all right but after he died oh jesus he didn't show himself to everybody he didn't show himself to everybody he never went back he never did go back to the to the pharisees and the sadducees and all that but it went to those who believed and he proved to them he already told him now i'm gonna rise again he's here y'all understand me but what is he doing he's building the people's faith and what is the point what is he bringing to them to rig for them for them to fully recognize let's jump let's jump let's jump to to thomas thomas says i'm not going to believe he said i ain't believing you're not going to make me believe it y'all crazy people i ain't believing it that's what he said jesus being the door didn't need a door so he walked because he was the door y'all hear me he walked through the wall and the first person he came to thomas see god knows you i read it he knows your thoughts are far off he knows whether you're a believer or not but he don't throw you away if you don't believe why especially if you're elected god couldn't do without thomas why because thomas represents somebody in here hallelujah thomas said if i was just stressing my hand to his side now thomas really went overboard [Laughter] hallelujah he wasn't thinking about the man's feelings was he if i could just stretch my hand into decided to my hands in his womb he said did i believe oh lord can you imagine the embarrassment and jesus walked up to him and says thomas here's my side thrust your thrust your hands in there thomas feel that i'm alive thomas hallelujah if you don't believe me now give me some fish and bread y'all hear me amen and thomas got the greatest of all revelation my lord and my god and he said blessed are those who have not seen but yet believe hallelujah so you were perfect you're perfectly in his purpose because you came after william branham you came after god used him as a son of man hallelujah you have not seen it but you believe it and so listen when the devil said oh you do something wrong with you you you following a cult telling you following one and everybody that follow you is one hallelujah but you see i'm not married to a system [Music] and ain't no system gonna ever dictate to me again somebody help me here when i get ready to praise god i'm praising the way i want to hallelujah if i feel like shouting i'm gonna shout if i feel like dancing i'm gonna dance if i feel like running i'm gonna run hallelujah hallelujah we don't do that over here will you stay over there and i'll stay over here hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh people people just trying to uh no no no no no hallelujah when the holy spirit come you let him have his way um yes sir so anyway we we so many people are you know even in the message they well yeah i'm gonna have to say it now to my mouth yes they have a system some people have systems hallelujah you stay in the holy ghost and where is he hmm glory and now we cleaning our necks i'm off on subject now but what i'm trying to say he whom the son is set free is free indeed hallelujah is that right amen i have a sister in lima ohio she called me shouting john y'all don't heard the story of shouting john shouting john was an old man amen that loved to worship the lord hallelujah and and it got so bad until his church put him out because he used to shout too much and uh but they had to go by the house go by his house to tell him and he was old big farmer you know what i'm saying he had all of the cows and the ducks and the chickens and everything you know he had all the great things and he had children and so john because he was a spiritual man shouting john said well i know why you come you come to put me out you trying to tell me that i can't worship my god he said see all the things god brought bless me with he don't bless me with children he give me my house he did me all of these things he said and you think that i'm going to stop praising him because you feel like i shouldn't you know you know what john said he said hold my mule [Applause] hallelujah that's what i'm talking about i'm going to shout if i'm not here in your church i'm going to praise him hallelujah now anyhow let's move on so he comes and begins to show himself and this is what this message is doing the message is revealing jesus christ for your day he's trying to show you who you are right because now he comes and um don't worry about it peter show up because peter denied him cursed him and everything else we got peters in this message so i'm done backslid and going backwards but god said i can't move without him until he come back y'all hear what i'm saying you don't give up on your own you might not know who they are but hold fast y'all better hear what i'm saying i don't care what the devil has done maybe they are peter but god said when this gathering come when we get ready amen for a translation peter's got to be there [Applause] i know some of us will judge it and give up on them don't you do that hallelujah god's mercy and grace is beyond you huh now tell me the bible said that paul even swore and blasphemed and he was an angel of the lord because truly so you can understand the true election cannot baste because god elected and chosen them predestinated them sealed them or whatever you want to say it before the foundation of the world i don't understand it but that's what he said absolutely you love the lord i feel like i've gone a little bit too long but let me move on by god's grace seven days so what happens god is now revealing himself to his bride his bride amen one thing he said so you can understand with marrying him just why seeketh you the dead [Music] why seek you the living among the dead right y'all hear what i'm saying why seek you the living among the dead so people you can't allow this church or this assembly to become a mortuary hallelujah and i'm talking i'm talking about life now real life i'm not talking about all that other stuff i'm talking about real life because that's what the devil is afraid of he's afraid of your life is that right is that right listen he wasn't afraid of jesus the man legion but when legion saw the character and saw the light or the illumination of god flowing through that natural body he said oh have you come to torment me before my time did you get it and you and jesus is one [Applause] somebody help me here you see what i'm saying that's why i said the devil is afraid of you especially when he sees the character of christ living in you oh glory to god hallelujah absolutely there is no losing for you you can't lose hey they probably laughed at noah says noah you've got the worst wood there was or is and you said telling me hallelujah that time there's coming some great flood hallelujah and they didn't know what rain was you know that right they had no idea like i like the prophet god said he was speaking in tongues they didn't know hallelujah but when it started raining it was revealed you love the lord god is good right listen what the prophet said this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bride crew that's what i'm trying to say and every one of us are feeling it the world is falling apart it's never been so dark right sometimes it's so bad you know if you didn't know that you were bride you would think have i missed it you know what i'm saying and it's moving so you christians will understand you think this is just about politics this is a religious battle lucifer the devil himself is anointing people and the whole gathering together is against a true christian hallelujah it's not about republicans it's not about democrats it's all about the christians you better hear what i'm saying this thing is going to swing [Music] is y'all hear me now a lot of republicans are christians but all republicans are christians but then anybody that stands for christianity they labor you republican y'all understand what i'm saying so now we have become the enemy even in america i feel sorry even for my people they've been so deceived my son would have won the lawsuit thing he was going but he he mentioned he was a christian some sort and because the judge was a liberal he shut him down see they're the enemy y'all understand what i'm saying i'm not i'm talking about the spirit of that thing and you better understand when this thing whirl around is going to happen so fast do you all know what they're doing in australia you've seen how they built the little camps and everything and they they're you know just the other day they they were tasing this 12 year old girl because she didn't have on a mask it's coming who here yes and you better this is why this is character building character oh i'm going to take out my gun no no no no no you miss it no you can't take out your gun no no no no and the thing about it this is your tests the alpha has become the omega the lamb must be a lamb and brother branham said that jesus christ defeated savior satan at calvary through sweetness and meekness he didn't get angry he could have spoke the word it would have finished it hallelujah but he suffered and this is what a lot of americans we don't know nothing about suffering hallelujah but this is your day and you need to get enough holy ghosts because that's the only thing that's going to carry you through hallelujah the holy spirit he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he has promised it and it will and shall be done [Applause] oh the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom oh the real church of the living god ought to be on fire not woe is me oh lord i'm going through so much lord what's wrong with you you ought to be shouting down hallelujah boulevard hallelujah because you know and this is what people don't understand this is the message you don't even see it but you're being changed already hallelujah and what the change is given to you i don't care how many vaccinations you take it'll never stop the change yeah i mean this is a supernatural change that's taken listen it will not hinder those that are asleep [Music] so god right now [Music] it's changing you molecularly i wish i had a word i do have it but i don't have it with me he's changing you and you don't even know it [Music] something is moving now and you got to know it something in you is it's loving god more now than ever y'all hear me and you're not doing it it's something that's craving it's a craving it's a craving and you can't say you can't stop it it seemed to get more and more and more but that same craving will take you where you need to be because the deep called to the deep and there is a deep to respond that's why you're feeling more sinful that's why you think yourself to be nothing and all of that is good because as you scroll in god the more evil you'll see yourself as being thank god for the change of the body hallelujah i wish they could take an x-ray of me and see jesus in there he's there he's in another dimension but he's there hallelujah can i have a few more minutes hallelujah so you understand by god's grace i've jumped a little bit of every place but i want you to understand that what was happening even in noah's day he says come on in the ark seven more days and you know the seven is always the type of the seven church ages and stuff like that but there was silence and whatever god was doing in those seven days only noah and the animals knew no more preaching it was no longer an open show they were sealed in and god sealed them in oh don't you understand what i'm saying once you get that sealed he's the one who's changing you like he did the aaron's rock you hear what i'm saying he's changing you from glory to glory right did y'all know that even noah's at the situation of noah was a death barrier and resurrection how many all knew that hallelujah and when he rose he came up out of that ark he came to see a new land so understand when when christ being in here he's oh yes we're going to see him we will see him did y'all know that amen but everybody won't everybody won't see him but first of all you got to see him in you hallelujah did you know that your life is supposed to be so much like christ that when people see you they said oh that he just like jesus she's just like chill [Music] that's the word hallelujah you say oh my yes they were called christians first at antioch you love the lord you know it's amazing because people don't realize i'm gonna say if this is the people who coming you it's it's so much later than what you think and for god to call anybody right now it's a miracle it's a wonderful miracle because you kind of like the one coming at the end but you get everything else everybody that went through but so lo so that you know this is the truth i've seen it i've seen it work and why everybody else in religion and everything else while they're over there you know and i thank god for his mercy and grace toward all of us because if all of us at one point we didn't see we didn't know i didn't even know god was supposed to send a prophet i didn't know none of that stuff i didn't know there was a revealed word i did not there are things and you know what grace to me was like hope it was like hope i saw where he didn't strike me down and i was hoping that he wouldn't you know and you look at this thing he says look the darkness is gathering this is what i'm trying if i could gain the picture take noah's day you and i would have never thought the world would be the way it is we knew the rapture was going to take place but we didn't understand that the revealing of god would come at a time when it'd be so dark is that right genesis darkness cover the face of the earth it was everything was void then god said let there be light you are the light of the world this is the this is the light that god is now speaking into existence and you are the ones that is supposed to bring this thing in order you understand me so being the light of god you show people this is what i love about the message because in the message you see a real men and you see real women [Music] you know i thought the sisters would give a bigger amen than that i know you're getting tired but you know yeah yes yes yes you're the real thing hey he y'all she was out there who would have thought and i don't criticize him i feel sorry my heart goes out you know they don't know any better you think oh they should but i didn't when i had that big old afro and all those psychedelic colors i didn't know it's the truth and then they had us on with the big old platforms you know what that was it was high-heeled shoes and then you had a cake cutter for a pig we didn't know we thought that was cool man that was in yeah it wasn't in god for sure y'all know what i'm saying they i tell you i didn't know they didn't they don't know so don't ever look at them like oh there's a shame they shouldn't do that but they don't know they don't have a bible they don't have nothing godly to look to you understand me they just don't know and your soul you should pity them and really go after them [Music] you see a person that's tattooed all up he's looking for something he's very unhappy he's he's he's mocking himself that's a sign that i need somebody to help me is that right look at legion he was cutting himself amen full of devils and he needed jesus hallelujah and let me tell you until you get to the place to see yourself as being him you're bad past people but when you see that jesus was a savior you become a savior y'all know what i'm saying if we're going to be born of his bone and flesh of his flesh we must be as he is and that's what he told his disciples he said i'm endowing you with power and go into all the world to save them from what unbelief when they see jesus in you they'll know he's real oh god help me i'm almost done i've jumped but that's okay i'm always i'm almost done hallelujah let me just read this and then we'll move on god is so good to us and i know i'm throwing out everything and i trust that you the holy spirit will pull it all together for you because uh we're living at a time when when when these uh the bride the bride so let me say it like this remember the story the prophet of god gives about the ranch's son right and the one that was cousin to the the denominations yeah and uh here she was a simple little girl in her proper place working her purpose and he watched he's up on the fence and he's watching her throw kitchen water the dishwater out and he's watching her character the whole time now just by watching her he decides that's the kind of weapon i'm looking for now god has made it plain to us he's not looking for those who's got to have a new hairdo every night every day with all of the other fandangos that goes with it you know what i'm saying you don't have to glitter and glow he want that simple woman that knows love being a woman you understand me so he want that kind and and and he's watching her and he falls in love with her that's about us you know y'all know my testimony the lord showed me who my wife was we never dated or anything i never kissed her until he said you can kiss the bride we never were alone in our coat ship ever i got off my knees i went and asked her to marry me she said brother brooks minister brooks don't be playing with me i said i'm not playing with you god showed me that was my bride i didn't have to worry about all the other stuff we've been married 44 years or 45 how many years has been hallelujah you understand what i'm saying when god show you who your wife is you don't have to figure it out or even test it y'all know what i'm saying it's the truth you know and and what what i'm saying to the sisters listen this little girl you know she was out there and um he proposed this to her now this message always is a proposal it's an invitation to to be my bride and it's up to you to accept it right and so first of all she says not me see when you hear this message and you don't judge yourself as being nothing something's wrong because you can't come help it it comes to help you [Music] and so she said oh me who am i who am i you know god and how many times you in prayer are you still thinking that how who am i why would you choose me brother that's right knowing what i yes thank god for the blood but anyhow she took his word now can i say it like this she was in the backyard on the back side of the house on the back side of the book and what was going on with her all of the world all of the christendom had no idea they couldn't see it so what happens she began to tell it and she prepared herself taking her little knuckles and dimes you know what i'm what that means she's praying she's fasting she's she's doing spiritual things you know it's not money but she she's preparing herself she's buying her garment she adding faith virtue knowledge temperance all those things right and guess what she was ready before he got there people think oh with the squeeze come i'm gonna get ready you better be ready before the squeeze comes right because listen when the squeeze come let him that be filthy filthy he that holy holy is that right oh come on it's the truth listen when that door in noah's day shut it was too late hallelujah the prophet god said it was like the rain when the rain stopped falling it was too late when the persecution starts squeezing it's too late people do you hear it's too late then now is the time why do you think listen it's the truth i tell people this everywhere i go i say never in the history of the world has a world has ever been shut down like egypt and the reason why it was shut down in egypt is to make sure that the blood and the lentil was placed on the doorpost make sure you say this is your period of grace during the times of plagues and everything else god shut down egypt now god shuts down the world because of pledge and this is the reason why to make sure you must make sure that the blood of jesus christ has been applied [Music] hear what i'm saying so anyhow you look at this thing you say well brother what are you saying i'm trying to tell us it's later than what we think don't ever listen don't ever think that you're a loser don't ever let the devil think that you're a failure you can't fail if you're in christ he's a winner but you need to use what you know you got right you you use what you have on the inside like david he didn't have number one little revelation and that was jesus christ it's the same yesterday forever and he took that thing and he slew the giant it ain't about all you know it's who you know and who knows you right so i'm shutting down now but i i i know i'm missing something but i'll pick it up later by god's grace but i'm trying to tell the people of god you're more than a winner but listen you can practice all you want religion it won't help you you need the holy ghost the holy ghost is the one only one that can change you oh it's true when i was in the apostolic church i knew you know what i mean i i did everything they say do i did it and i knew god was with me and i'm saying to everybody in here you came here because god is with you god pulled you here that's god hallelujah millions of people would love to hear this word but god chose you hallelujah i said lord why did you let me waste god didn't waste you didn't waste nothing god preserved you that's god no matter where you were god preserved you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and he made you faithful he made this is why you hear because you love the word holy we may not have understood everything but we loved him and he knows you love him and that's why he's got you here hallelujah don't feel bad god did it hallelujah god has done this thing the thing that i'm looking at is that we're getting ready to embrace a translation did y'all know that hallelujah everybody can't see like you see now you got eyes to see things they can't see hallelujah oh lord have mercy hallelujah is that right everybody didn't see the dead raised when jesus got up out of the ground everybody didn't see it hallelujah and then you know you think about it jesus could be sitting right up in here and you won't even notice him he walked on the road to amaze with those disciples and they didn't even know who he was hallelujah but as he began to preach what did he do that seventh seed which was christ he opened that word and he began from genesis through the prophecy and he began to preach who jesus you hear what i'm saying he preached jesus let me say it like this it's it's beyond god sent a prophet he preached jesus you better hear what i'm saying a true mouth transfiguration experience will only glorify jesus christ hallelujah only only and that's the mountain you must climb in order to repent is that right because when those disciples saw elijah moses and jesus this is lord shall we make three denominations so we make three tabernacles and then all of a sudden a cloud a dimensional see what people don't understand people think that was those weren't water vapors you know incompetent about a greater cloud of witness those are not water vapors those are a host dressed in white hallelujah that's why he said as you saw me go up you should likewise see me come down it's a host y'all understand me and you and i must understand by the grace of god when god comes in and began to work with you and let him work suffer but thank him for it go through what you got to go through him but make him make let god bring you to a sweetness and a meekness in everything i'm closing i try i keep trying to close and somebody keep somebody keep pulling but um uh it's it's because i'm full i'm really full and i'm trying to get it because i want people to know things have changed things have changed and remember when you was a kid and you tried to you know you know put on your clothes and all that kind of stuff and and i don't know a child yet who didn't put his shoes on wrong you couldn't disturb it determine or distinguish between the right shoe and the left shoe and you walk out like that you know it took a while it took a while to learn that right and then you know you you and that's how it is with the word you learn you learn how it all fits but no matter how it fits it's going to spell out the lord jesus christ every time every time every time every time every time don't let no system make you believe anything other than that because even our prophet never came to exalt himself he kept pointing to jesus christ this is his hour now right and in closing i'm closing for real this time but in closing to show you where you stand in the scripture your esther and i can go through another scripture but i'm gonna tell you like this in that silence because a lot of times people think when silence what the word of god said the heavens hushed didn't say nothing about earth because because something say silent doesn't mean nothing's going on what nothing going on in heaven right but if you take this the scripture and you go into esther because esther's the queen she's the girl she's the one i didn't mean to say it like that [Music] but my point is you know think about it it was a time of desperation and haman was going to destroy all the jews and listen people let's put it this way they perhaps had their dna and so esther at some point was going to be discovered but something about esther she knew that the king loved her now you're going to fail god if you don't know he loves you if you have allowed the devil to tell you that jesus christ do not love you then you you need to be at the altar but esther knew that there was a garment that he liked and that's the garment of phrase you know what i'm saying it's nothing that makes a man feel good when he's bought his wife a nice outfit and she put that thing on come on brothers yes it makes me makes him happy because you know she appreciate what you right and when she put that on she's thinking about you and you bet not ignore but esther put on this thing and she knows she's haven't been summoned that's the key she hasn't been summoned everybody's waiting on the summons but esther did not because she saw that she needed to see the king you understand me and she knew because the law god had not ordered her to come in that it meant death if he didn't hand out the scepter [Music] right so you understand where we are in history i'm going to tell you something when the door swung open because remember when the king's chamber is business all business going on he's he's working things trying to get things straightened out and everything else and don't want to be disturbed and esther the door opens and esther is standing there and everything hushed i hope you get it quiet but it was at this time esther locked eyes with her king and let me tell you something a man and woman can lock eyes and won't have to say one word because the language is unspoken somebody know what i'm talking about i know we all but we remember don't you no words had to be spoken all business hushed don't get it like in heaven everything hushed esther walks in she comes up to the king and she can tell by his eyes it's going to be all right he takes the scepter you know what the scepter was his authority and he gives her the little book you hear what i'm saying he gives her the scepter and she takes it and everything's fine and he asked her what would you have she says i'm having a great church service over here i want you to come she called it a banquet she said but i'm going to y'all know a banquet is real good you know you've never seen a sad person at a banquet coming over here to a banquet and bring the devil right bring the devil i want the devil to know he's already lost come on somebody y'all know it's the truth come on brothers those of you who who had a best friend you had a best friend as soon as you met your wife you forgot him it's the truth your best friend you ran together you played ball together you were together all the time and all of a sudden you met your wife and your best friend went out the window it worked that way you don't even know you you neglecting your birth best friend you're not even thinking i'm neglected my best friend never crossed your mind right so what happens is she said come on and i'm i'm closing now for real come on and she says oh come on now we're going to have a banquet and you know she's just letting this man don't even know she going to judge you you already judged but she's getting ready to tell him [Music] and the king is the one who's gonna put it on you and she said he said well esther you you had such a wonderful church service you praised me so well and every time i wanted some grapes you dropped them in my mouth y'all that's not i'm just i'm not trying to add but i'm trying to give you a picture and so what happens is amen he says tell you what else to here's the book here's the scepter i'm going to give you half the kingdom in other words join us with christ i've made you join heirs with the king whatever is mine is yours esther you understand oh god that's what this message has given unto you it's everything that is of jesus it is of yours hallelujah king said tell me esther says no no no no come on you know it's good to have it done you know have a witness you know let's do it again let's do it again you understand me and so what god does and what she did that's you don't you see what i'm saying put yourself in esther's shoes this is where you become the character because when esther when esther came before the king you were there you put yourself in esther and then you see your role to play and then you see what's given to you and then you see that esther becomes if can i say it like this somewhat a mediator whatever you want to say it but she stood in between the king the judgment and her people you see what i'm saying amen and and you know she was willing to die and she did in some blizzard in symbolism when she fasted three days and three nights that was a death bury and resurrection and she went to see the king and now the king is giving her all she need and now she's telling the king that old devil's trying to kill me lord she said who who he said who that haman right and then haman is what he's trying to butter up you don't think the devil at that day gonna try to butter you up all that stuff he doesn't did to you and knowing he's gonna be cast into the lake of fire hello all because of you what did he do he flirted with you that was what god that's the way the king interpreted ain't no way you gonna come into my king into my house in my bedroom or wherever they was and then you're gonna try to attack my queen what a setup [Music] [Laughter] y'all hear what i'm saying oh my and now now she's got speech she can speak and now she's speaking the spoken word he needs to die his sons need to die and the very hell he could created for me he need to hang on that [Applause] hallelujah she is the one that causes his judgment don't be afraid of the devil it's written you're the one that causes the judgment of his him being thrown into the lake of fire [Applause] oh my god hallelujah if you don't shout then you won't have no shout out huh to know where you are and that's why the devil hates you so much because he know you are his end you are his end you are his end he can never stop you but we are here to stop him hallelujah let's stand hallelujah glory to god mercy jesus can't stop us oh lord in the presence of jehovah god [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hearts are manned [Music] of the kings can we sing that once again in the present in the praise [Music] god almighty let's raise our hands and worship him tonight [Music] hey [Music] the bread [Music] you see god is so perfect even when you do wrong he works it together he'll he'll manipulate your will to match his will you say well what how can you say that jonah ran and he didn't even know he was running in the right direction [Music] he thought he was running from god but he was literally running into the will of god remember jesus told us that that god prepared a fish for jonah so before jonah got there the fish was there waiting you understand me and jonah didn't understand that god anointed the fish and put him into the ministry [Music] yes he did jonah somehow understood and when the waves began to dash and everything else he said throw me overboard he was a prophet must god must have showed him something but then when he got there the fish swallowed him and what happened took him to nineveh then i don't know how jonah knew which direction he was going in but he knew how to turn and the bible said he turned toward the temple because remember solomon and david all they prayed that if any man would turn towards the temple god would hear him hallelujah he prayed and god heard him and the next thing you know amen he's in nineveh and here's the here's the the whale amen throwing him up oh my god why because god knew that over there in nineveh they were fish they worshipped the fish god you understand me oh god works on our behalf yes he does even when we don't think he's working for us he's working for us and then what happens jonah gets out there i don't understand the mind of prophets but he began to preach and everything else and god did what he did and he jonah gets mad [Music] you know and god understand even when you get angry he's amazing i'll tell you what experience if there's anybody that needs prayer we pray for you but just the other week i was preaching and i don't know whether god will allow me to preach that here but i was preaching uh uh let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and while i was preaching something happened it was so fast and so quick i actually thought it was i thought it was a rapture i really something an energy a power a light a holiness that i can't even comprehend engulfed me in just a moment's time i understood something i did i can't even explain it but i underst i understand his holiness is beyond anything we can imagine and god is the only one that can do that you see you can't do it but because you are chosen and he's elected you he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he will complete i wasn't looking for that but i understood what his will i understand basically what his will is for me and how it is in heaven there's no sickness no death no miracles because you are the miracle everything that our being is everything we are we're lined up in just a moment's time we're lined up but right now he's building that character because that house and the character must fit don't worry about nothing trust god trust him and believe that he's going to do what he says stop looking in the mirror and seeing your faults and your failures because the blood covers all of that just press on says lord you see the need that's in me that character that i i want to have patience i want to be long suffering i want to have this perfect love i want to have this charity i can't do it y'all know what i'm saying how many times you've done that that's like saying oh i'm gonna hold my breath for five minutes anybody in here can do it you can't do it you might have a desire to do it but you can't do it it's one of those things you cannot do and that's how it is with god you can't change yourself you might want to change you you can't do it but god can hallelujah he's the changer we've got a word that's changing us from glory to glory right now i just love the lord amen you love the lord let's just raise our hands and let's worship for a moment lord i thank you thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for everything you've done for us lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves oh jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus [Music] hallelujah we call our pastor [Music]
