hallelujah thank you all so much thank you so much join us as quickly as you can we appreciate all you've done this morning would you turn in your bible to the book of psalms psalm 5 verse 11. we're happy to have you in the service this morning we're happy to have every one of you streaming i i i didn't have time to even take my laptop so i can't see who is streaming but we are grateful for you we know that you are watching in the nations of the world and we want to give god thanks for you we appreciate you so much we appreciate you being a part of this service we want to remind the local body that on tuesday night march the 15th brother caleb doron the pastor of the amazing grace tabernacle in tucson will be with us for one service only that's tuesday night march the 15th and then april the 1st through the 3rd friday saturday and sunday brother daniel miller will be preaching for us and ministering to us in song we're looking for a wonderful time in the lord amen i'd like to read verse 11 psalm 5 first in king james and then in the amplified version if you'll let me let me say to those of you who are here i see a visitor here a friend of david's diego is that right god bless you we're glad to have you i wished i knew a little more spanish but i don't know very much spanish dios la bendiga is that close he's not even smiling so i don't think it's even close i thought it was close so we're very happy to have you here we're glad to see sister megan with us she had some major foot surgery this week and uh made her way to the house of god anyway may god bless her we're very happy to look up and see the minko family with us it's been a few weeks since they were able to be here i don't know for sure but i thought i saw mama with something in her arms so this is our our sweet little zion's first uh service with us and we're very happy about that and i saw sister karen while ago uh rj's mom here it was nice to see her in service with us i appreciate the presence of the lord he's here he spoke to us as we worshiped him i know that what you just heard as an exhortation from the spirit i know that's the heart of god because i could see it earlier in the service that that was his heart and he wants to speak to us in that manner we make a choice today it's our choice no one can make that choice for us not even those who love us so much no one can make that choice but us when we get tired of where we are when we get tired of living where we are and feeling what we feel and thinking what we think being what we are then we come to him we make a choice and we say lord here i am i'm your humble servant i throw myself on your mercy i cannot bring myself out of this but i know you can and i pray that you will find grace to throw yourself on his mercy today because i i believe with all my heart when i woke up this morning the lord was talking to me and i believe with all my heart that god is giving us opportunities to bring our own deliverance to pass by speaking the words of truth the truth that's been preached to us what we have heard the message that god has sent to us is making available to us deliverance i don't know if we have some preconceived idea of what deliverance looks like or how it's supposed to come but i want you to know it's absolutely biblical and according to this message that you raise up in the name of the lord and decree and declare and prophesy your own way out i heard the lord say this morning when i woke up but many have chosen to walk in bondage and you know that is not a choice that any of us should make i don't care what the circumstances are we should always want to choose to be free no matter what the price no matter what the cost and i felt like the lord was saying that because some have chosen to stay to remain in a place of bondage without the freedom that the lord has provided that your day of of getting it the easy way is coming to a close it doesn't mean that god won't bring deliverance in your life i believe he will but if you won't come the easy way the way i just described by raising up in faith and saying i know i'm not unaware of where i am i'm not unaware of the position that i'm in and i decree and declare in the name of jesus i'm coming out i'm not going to lay here any longer when i know he has paid the price i felt like i heard the lord say because some have chosen to remain in that bondage that easy way out is coming to an end for them and they will come out but they'll come out the hard way i i refuse to come out the hard way i just refuse that now when i i know the i know there was a word and it has it's totally a different word it means something totally different because thou have chosen the hard way that's the way of persecution that's the way of hardship that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about an easy way and that you taking god at his word and just making up your noggin no more no more i can walk out of this valley i can come out of this place and i can be free and lead others or actually lead others or if you have the rock you you have the rock either way you fall on him and declare yourself i'm your humble servant and you get broken in his sight or the rock falls on you but one way or the other there's not going to be one that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world lost every one of them are coming one way or the other all the way through his bride will shine in the glory of his countenance do you believe that all right but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them [Music] let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee we were privileged to have the name of jesus look this way we were privileged to have the name of jesus spoken over us sung over us declared over us and we receive that like a blessing from the lord amen amen we say amen amen let them that love thy name be joyful in thee now look at the amplified it says but let all those who take refuge and put their trust in you rejoice let them ever sing and shout for joy because you make a covering over them hallelujah and do what defend them you are not defenseless against the enemy today you are being covered over and defended by the living god whoo let those also who love your name be joyful in you and would you read the last part i can't just do that yes yes yes you can for every voice it says no i can't i can't i can't there's a higher voice saying yes yes you can because it's my invitation to you joshua chapter 6 i recognize that you're standing joshua chapter 6 and verse 20. you know this believe brother greeley spoke about it not too long ago i believe brother dwayne when he was here one time spoke about it so the people shouted does anybody remember why they shouted because they were told to not because they felt it not because they felt like doing it not because everything was good nothing was bad and all the problems were solved they were standing on the outside of a walled in city that god said your inheritance is on the other side of that wall a wall so big that they could hold chariot races on top of those walls i mean i want you to know that's that's not some one one concrete block wall we're talking about a massive width of walls standing there chariot races on the top of that wall everything god said is yours on the other side of that wall and god gave a strategy that sounded like nonsense march around and keep quiet march around and keep quiet march around keep quiet march around keep quiet but then on the last day so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a puny with a great shout out hallelujah and the wall did what fell down flat the ground opened up swallowed the wall you need not think the wall toppled over because as wide as the wall was if the wall just fell over like that you would have still had to do a whole lot of climbing you would have had to find a breach to climb over and get through to get on the other side that's not what happened even many archaeologists believe that those walls were absolutely sunk right down into the earth and became powder in the sand did you know that most people agree not one physical remain has been located that those walls ever existed they have the ruins of jericho i've been to the ruins of jericho i have eaten lunch in the modern city of jericho that surrounds the old city they have found ruins that the city existed but no walls because there was such a god-given strategy i know you're standing there was such a god-given strategy for the victory and because there was a people who obeyed the word of the lord we're not asking you to sell your house and give the money to the church we're not asking you to buy me a new suit i could use one but i'm not asking you to buy it we're not asking you to do anything other than taking your opportunity to give god the praise that he deserves that's all we're asking is that you would enter into a place where you would realize and recognize the power that joy can have in your life much more than a feeling isn't it and the people shouted with uh that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and i want you to read the last phrase and they took the city lord jesus we are so thankful already for this presence that has been with us my what an atmosphere so many things stirring the enemy he always would like to distract us cause us to look over here look over there see what somebody else is doing see how somebody else is praising see who's got a flag see who's got to dance see what that one wants to say but lord i'm so thankful today that you have an order in the spirit and you are bringing us forth right now to receive all that you have for us and we know we're entering into the most critical part of the service and we need your help right now like we have never needed it before because we've never faced a day like this day we've never been in a moment quite like this moment before that's how your economy works and so we ask that you would come right now by the power of the holy spirit and you administer to the need in each and every individual's life and we ask this in the lovely name of our lord and savior our messiah yeshua in the name of the lord jesus christ and the saints of god said you may be seated i want to speak this morning for the first few moments on the weapon of joy we've learned some things about joy we understand that joy is more than an emotion or a feeling it is actually a gift it's a fruit of the spirit but the joy of the lord is a gift it comes from god it's our inheritance we can have it we just have to claim it once we discover that it's ours for the asking doesn't mean it's going to be automatic sometimes you got to fight your cousins your uncles and aunts your siblings or whoever else may try to come and get your portion but once you discover that you've got a portion laid up for you you want not to lay down and let anybody else take what belongs to you that's the hour we're living in right now god's going to have a people that get a little militant after his promises you're not just laying around waiting i know there are certain things that brother branham said that people really like and they really like the lazy anointing and they really like this idea that all we have to do now is just lay around in the sun and ripen and i said you know that's a that's a dangerous thing because you can also lay around and rot you don't want to do that you want to recognize that there's an enemy who is out to steal to kill to destroy he does not want you to have joy he doesn't even want you to have peace he doesn't want you to feel the love of god in your life he doesn't want you to be able to function he wants to fill you with such anxiety and fear and depression and oppression and pain and all these other things the spirit of god said woundedness and here is the thing about woundedness everybody under the sound of my voice knows what it feels like to be wounded we've all had anything from a boo-boo to a major surgery in the natural and even in the spiritual we know what it means to be gob-smacked slapped around beat up drugged through the dirt we've experienced these things but we choose as the overcoming bride of jesus christ at his invitation to come and lay all of that before him and he pours the fatness of joy all over it did you know the bible said he would fill us with the oil of gladness the oil of joy that word oil there is the fat he wants to fill us with the fat of gladness with the fat of joy he wants to pour on us everything we need to give him the praise that he rightfully deserves and joy is not about a feeling joy is about a confidence are you with me it's about a trust it's about complete trust it's about total trust it's about completely and totally trusting the lord who has called you how many of you believe he who has started a good work he who has started a good work is more than able to finish that work in your life he is both the author and the who and the finisher of our faith he's not only given to every individual in this room a seed of faith a measure of faith but he has poured his oil on that faith and the more he does the more we use it the more he anoints it the more we exercise it and and we use it and we stretch it and it becomes stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and it's not how much faith you have it's whether or not you you choose to leave your faith in place or whether you choose to withdraw it and pull it back you've got to keep putting your faith in somebody put their faith in somebody now i don't listen i don't i've never played poker i'm not holy because of it but i have never played a game of poker in my life me and sister flo but i grew up going to sleep to the sounds of a poker game so i know a little bit about the language and i know that you're gonna look at what you got and you're gonna decide what to do about it and sometimes people will just take all their pot every bit of it and put it right out there right out in the middle and they say i'm all in fold i guess they say lay their cards down they put all their money in if you happen to be a jeopardy fan it's a true daily double you put it all in you invest it all in this is how it works but you've got to know that you know that you know that you know or you're going to lose you better know that what you're holding well i don't like using these analogies but it just come like that to my mind you got to know that yours is going to trump it's going to beat everybody else's hand you're taking a risk if you don't have the top if you don't have the best of the best you're taking a risk if you put it all in but i want you to know sometimes i just get tired of playing games this thing needs to come to an end one way or the other it's time to go to bed so to speak it's time to put it all in and either win it all back or lose it all but then it's over and we go home right it's time church to put all of our faith in every bit of our confidence in him and let's put him to the test and see again and again and again if he will not come through he always always comes through why isn't he helping me because you won't put it all in if you will invest it all in and say i'm yours sink or swim stand or fall win or lose i'm throwing my whole life on you lord it's up to you whether your servant stands or falls it's up to you whether we survive or whether we fall dead it's in your hands but we refuse to be backed into this corner any longer we choose to take you at your word so this joy is more than an emotion in fact we find out that that this shout of joy that's mentioned numerous times in the bible and i won't have time to cover them this morning don't even want to i want to do a bit of a review of a few things we've learned about joy i want to reserve a little bit of time at the end for whatever the lord has but i want you to know that joy is not just an emotion it's actually a spiritual weapon because a person who is filled with the joy of the lord is the least likely to be distracted by the threats that the enemy continuously makes so you're holding on to the joy of the lord is a strategic decision that becomes a spiritual weapon in this last warfare amen now this last warfare is help me now help me now it's right there that's where it is that's where it's fought and that's where it's won right there in the mine i read you some different thoughts about joy and webster's dictionary definition of joy and we looked over it uh theopedia and uh saw what it is i'm gonna read it now theopedia describes joy as a state of mind as an orientation of the heart i love that it is a settled state of contentment confidence and hope how many of you know we need that hope and we've got every reason to be filled with hope today every reason don't you know how how gas prices are yes but that's not moving my hope that's not changing where my hope lies it's planted firmly in the lord jesus christ we'll make it somehow we'll get about somehow joy is defined as a strong feeling of happiness a manifestation of happiness through an outward rejoicing or excitement a couple pastors well-known evangelical pastors were were asked to give a definition of joy and i don't know if their opinion is any more important than yours but i happen to run across them and they've been in my notes ever since i started this little time with you on joy and i'm not read them yet so i'm going to do that today john piper some of you know who that is he defines joy like this christian joy is a good feeling in the soul produced by the holy spirit as he causes us to see the beauty of christ in the word and in the world all right now maybe you've heard the name rick warren i'm sure you have a bit of a controversial uh figure but very well known i actually like his definition better he said joy is the settled assurance that god is in control of all the details of my life it is the quiet confidence that ultimately everything is going to be all right and the determined choice to praise god in every situation and in every circumstance can i read it again joy is the settled assurance that god is in control of all the details of my life the quiet confidence that ultimately everything is going to be all right and the determined choice to praise god in every situation and in every circumstance see it's a choice and that choice is a very important part of what joy is but i think it's even more than that i think it's a deep settled abiding a continuing in something i want to read you a couple of verses from john 15 and i want to tell you that this is how you can maintain joy in a messy world in a world like we're living in right now you can continue to have the joy of the lord and the joy of god is a fruit in your life in john chapter 15 verse 4 and 5 he said abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me i am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit i like the way the king james says this next phrase jesus is making a pretty bold statement for without me anybody hear the words of the lord red letter talking right to you this morning he's talking right to us for without me you can do nothing as soon as you think you can do it you can handle it you can get by on your own that's when you withdraw yourself from the vine you're disconnecting yourself from the only source of life hope and strength that we can have in this hour don't you dare pull that cord don't you dare unplug yourself from the source of life and strength and hope that we find in the lord jesus christ now i want to read those two verses in the amplified are you with me is it all right the goal is slow right now good dwell in me and i will dwell in you this is how you can keep the joy this is how you can keep the peace this is how you can walk in hope this is how you can get through everything you're going to face this week and the next and the next by abiding in him by dwelling in him by making the lord your habitation by making the lord your living place your dwelling place your tabernacle your temple he said dwell in me and i will dwell in you live in me and i will live in you just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in being vitally united to the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches whoever lives in me and i in him bears much abundant fruit however apart from me i like this parent this these brackets here cut off from vital union with me you can do huh you can do nothing there is a union there is a oneness that this word has revealed to us in this hour you can be one with him you can be one with the word and when you cut off that vital union of fellowship with him you can do nothing did you know carrying a spirit that is not christ can absolutely cut us off from our place of union with him it's happened to every one of us someone said i don't even believe that it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not it's happened to every one of us we have faced situations and circumstances in life where our where somebody's action coupled with our reaction has caused us to carry a spirit that is not christ and when we carry that and nurture that and and and pour life into that instead of into our union with christ when we hold tighter to our woundedness when we hold tighter to our our our pain than we do to our union with christ it absolutely cuts us off from the joy from the hope from the peace you see we're living in this hour among the walking dead we shop with the walking dead we we work with the walking dead true we go to church with some who are walking dead nobody has forced them into a tomb no one has forced them to live in that cold cold place but because of some circumstance or something that has happened in life they have withdrawn themselves into a into a tomb and though they walk and though they function and though they move even though they come to church sometime the hollow look in their face is a testimony that they are no longer drinking they're no longer drinking from the blood they're no longer eating flesh that's his they're no longer having communion with christ no longer abiding no longer dwelling with him you can change that you can change that today you can change that today you can change that today today you don't have to wait till tomorrow to make a change you can do that today hallelujah look at seven and eight john 15 7-8 he goes on if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples in the amplified it says if you live in me abide vitally united to me and my words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts ask whatever you will huh i'm waiting on you ask whatever you will and it shall be done i want out of my pit i want out of my tomb i want out of my grave i want out of my coldness i want out of the darkness i want out of this joyless life i want to find what i know is mine i want to make up my mind that no circumstance is going to keep me from my inheritance no demon of hell sometimes i've heard the laughter in hell and i want you to know it's a hideous sound it's somewhere between a crying scream and a laugh and i believe demons laugh i believe they laugh all around us at times because they convince us with their lies with the way they touch our lives they convince us not to fight for what's rightfully ours we're not talking about fighting flesh and blood and principality i mean fighting flesh and blood and personality we're talking about spiritual battles and we're talking about fighting principalities instead of personalities it's a higher warfare that's going on in this hour amen amen not only is the enemy accusing you doing all that he can to tell god how sorry you are but he's loosed among us trying to accuse one to the other he's accusing the brother to the brother and the sister to the sister he's a liar the father of all lies and it's only by a unified and agreement coming together and saying we cut you off we cut you off we serve notice on you today oh shut up i don't have to listen to your cataholin i don't have to listen to your accusation there's a joy that's mine john 15 10-11 this is the last verse is from john 15. if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these listen listen folks it's impossible to dwell in the love of jesus christ and have no joy you you can't live in his love and pout you'd be ashamed to it you'd be convicted of it the spirit of the lord would be all over you you see i'm convinced that we sing of our love for the lord but we don't really understand what it means to love him see you know i love cookies i know you're supposed to like cookies and love people but i i really am fond of cookies tell me what you love there are some people that rather have cake i'd rather have cookie than cake tell me what you love i love fried chicken i love homemade biscuit who says what they say what'd you say strawberry something what'd you say you love it's long i love berries but i love the fact that you slid the ice cream in there too now that is that girl knows if you're gonna go with that kind of healthy thought of berries you might as well slide a little something in there sweeten the berries i think we get in our mind that what we're fond of is love but how many of you know that's not really love you're not affectionate toward uh berries and ice cream i've had some pretty good moments over a good oatmeal cookie yes with raisins of course it's got to be all the way i think sometimes we say i love him like he's a flavor like i prefer chocolate over vanilla but i want you to know that's not loving christ loving him is being willing to lay down everything that we have everything that we are everything that we're fond of everything we like laying it all down and loving him really loving him and when we when we live in that place of relationship it is impossible to do it without joy you can't live in that love and rebel against what god's trying to do for you and through you and around you when you are living in the love of god you enjoy that time with him but but you don't completely cut yourself off from the rest of the body of christ because there's so much love in your heart the love you have for him the love he has for you you want to spread some of that around just like you're willing on on occasion as long as you got lots of cookies you're willing to share them when you find something you really like that you really are fond of you want to share that you want to talk about that with somebody else i'm telling you the bride of christ must have communion with him we must have won this we must have abiding we must have dwelling we must have intimacy with him it's about leaning on our beloved it's about trusting that if we can't stand on our own his shoulder remains solid unmovable unshakable by the powers around us we can lean on him we can depend on him we can find everything we need in him are you with me if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i've kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you listen that my joy what joy the joy of the lord the joy of the lord the joy of the lord the joy of the lord that my joy might remain in you it is not the will of jesus christ for you and i to only have the joy of the lord in a set of special meetings it's not the will of the lord for us to only abide in that joy and have that joy dwelling in us when everything is going good that's not the joy of the lord the joy of the lord is what sustains us when everything's going bad the joy of the lord is what becomes a weapon when we understand that praise is not just uh standing in awe of him and lauding him as king of kings and lord of lords but praise is actually something that shifts the spiritual atmosphere around us because when the praises go up the blessings of the lord start filtering down is anybody still with us anybody still with me right now i want to hurry i want to hurry i do i really do i've told you these things that my joy in in the amplified verse 11 in the amplified i've told you these things that my joy and delight may be in you and that your joy and gladness may be a full measure filled up whoa how many of you like to have so much of the joy of the lord there's no room for it anymore you you got it all you got all the joy the lord you hold and and then you get completed by that place because you understand that you're connected and you're abiding and you're in oneness with him and then it overflows and you can't hold it back whoop that's when joy becomes a weapon that's when joy becomes a strategy to win a battle that needs to be won come on now shout when they heard the sound of the trumpet they shouted i don't know if it was a trumpet or the shouting i don't know what it was it was those sounds probably blending together in obedience to the lord that caused that wall to fall flat it just disintegrated and they didn't even have to step over it they just walked right in the strangest silliest strategy that you've ever heard for winning a battle and taking a wall city and yet it's what god chose i'm telling you if you will choose today to remain in the joy of the lord no matter what's going on in your life somebody listening if you will choose today to remain in the joy of the lord no matter what's going on in your life you will find the victory is on the other side of your shout out [Music] whether you realize it or not the economy the economy and the kingdom of god is marching on when we take ourselves out of the church we put ourselves in and we take ourselves out we put ourselves in we take ourselves out it's like i told a married couple here one time neither one of them in church this morning i haven't seen either one of them in church in years now no one to blame but themselves and this is their what i told them one day standing down in front of the tabernacle there i said if the two of you could ever get the victory at the same time that's not impossible it's a made-up mind it simply means if if daddy could be over here crying out to god and mama over here crying out to god at the same time not getting up i feel the holy ghost not getting up until they know that they have touched the throne and go out of here with victory no matter what they face no matter what's going on in the marriage no matter what's going on with the children but with a made-up mind i'm going to abide in him i'm going to dwell in him i'm going to live in his word i'm going to rest in his word i'm going to feast on his word hallelujah i'm going to let his word encourage me and i'm going to let it thrill me and i'm going to let it correct me and i'm going to let it direct me made of mine forgiving one another forgiving one another if you all could ever get on the mountain at the same time there is no telling what you could accomplish for the lord it's easy to pick on them they're they're a great target to pick on this morning because neither one of them are in the house of god that's not just about them how many husbands and wives are here this morning how many husbands and wives are streaming this service that the absolute truth could be said should be said it's being said because i'm saying it about you this morning i don't do this often like this i'm speaking to husbands and wives under the sound of my voice i wonder what could be accomplished in your life i wonder what kind of favor you could lose on your own family it's not about that that's not all we're after it's having favor on our family the favor of god and man on our family that's not all we're after that's just a that's just a benefit that's just a fringe benefit that's just the overflow of god's goodness in our life but then every then every uh uh promise every word every call every prophetic utterance over your life and what god desired to do in you see we're living in an hour where it's easier to blame the messenger it's so much easier to blame the mailman and i'll take my part of the responsibility for every mistake that i've ever made as a pastor i take my part i'm willing i i've tried my best to be someone who could come back and say i'm i'm sorry i've not done it right i hate the way i've done it i hate that it turned out like this this is not what we want but i want you to know something the messenger the mailman he couldn't bear the whole responsibility for the promise of god that's hanging over your life not being fulfilled when you're not positioning yourself to receive what god has said i wonder what kind of dynamos would come forth in this house if husbands and wives sitting here this morning would raise up together at one time and determine we're not going to go another day not another 24-hour day living out of joint we're going to live in unity with one another both in the natural and in the spiritual we're gonna we're gonna put our our uh investment in we're gonna put it all in we're gonna put our faith all in we're going to rise that listen life is is moving on and the economy of god is moving on and the purposes of god are moving on and they didn't wait on you they're just moving on and you're not getting any younger this morning i'm not the only one that's aging you're aging too in fact the older we get the the less we have in strength and physical dexterity to do what we've been called to do it's true it doesn't mean we lay down and give up it means we just take what we got and press on but there are callings laying over lives this morning that need to be fulfilled that words that need to be in action and teams that need to be reunited i'm talking about husbands and wives but that's not the only thing that god desires to do because he once had had a a relationship like a paul and a silas or like a david and a jonathan or come on there are times that your gift and and my gift complement one another or yours and yours or god puts people together for certain seasons and purposes and plans and sometimes it expires sometimes it runs out sometimes it doesn't run out sometimes it changes in some way but never runs out come on it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to end in disaster sometimes it does because there's a word there's a plumb line that we cannot compromise on is anybody with me there's a plumb line that we can't compromise on and that's the word of god as much as we love people there's a plumb line that we can't compromise on and that's the word of god you know i don't want to hinder anybody i'll be honest this morning i don't want to be the reason why that you're hindered on your journey i want to be the reason why you got help i want to be the reason why you broke through that's why i give of myself it's because i want to be a help to you and if i can't i'll be honest i want you to go where you can get help you don't have to leave mad you don't have to leave ugly you can leave with a kind spirit you can leave with the right attitude if you have come to a place where you recognize i just will never be able to get above and get my help here it'll be hard terribly hard nobody wants to see anything like that happen but if it has come to that place you've got to run for your life if you find that this is not your refuge find your refuge it's never in a church it's always in christ but if something hinders you in this house i would not desire that you sit and die on the vine is that ugly do i seem to have a bad attitude with what i'm saying even brother greene he had an odd way of doing things at times he thought everybody ought to be at the tabernacle because that was that was his vision his commission but he realized through the years that you can't always hold people and they want to go they go and he decided i don't have to be mad at him because they go i can bless him on the way it was hurtful to him that so many would leave and he would bless them and help them as they left and then later they would say mighty awful things about him and about the tabernacle but he said i i i can't make them love me more but i've got to make sure i continue to love them and love them more and when he found out that somebody wanted to start a church in the city and he had a part in just about every church in tucson and they tell me there's almost 20. one town spread out a bit i don't know too many of them that are full but they're all doing what they believe the lord has called them to do but if they would go to him in the right way and say i feel like i'm to go on he would say we i bless you he said one condition if you go off and find that there is something better than what we have here don't forget us come back and tell us tell us what you found it may be that we need the same thing you find that's pretty good attitude and then he would say what do you need do you need a piano do you need an organ do you need pews do you need a pulpit let me provide for you what you need to go on i don't want to be the reason why you can't fulfill what god has called you to fulfill i'm telling you that this morning from the bottom of my heart i don't want to be the the reason i don't want to be the excuse that you use to stand between you and your call your commission what god has called you to do i personally believe that everybody here this morning i can't speak for streamers because i don't know who's streaming but i personally believe that every one of us can find what we need in this house because i've seen what god is doing and i've seen the eternal differences that he is making around us and i believe we can but my opinion is my opinion you've got to hear for yourself but whatever you do don't be satisfied with anything less than knowing that you are in the perfect will of god i've been in touch with several families recently several more than one who have it in their heart they would like to move here they would like to go to church here they would like to make this their church home some are boldly sharing it with others some are quietly praying about it and seeking the will of god i'm neither excited nor disappointed i stand here today i want what god wants it's easy to say but i mean it from the bottom of my life from from the depth of who i am i want what god wants but i'm tired of seeing people not receive what's spread for them the table spread the banquet prepared and god's saying come get a piece of this come taste this come and experience me and people sitting back it's hard to watch people starving to death for what can be accomplished in their lives by the presence of the lord i believe the word of god must have preeminence among us i believe it's the most important thing to feed on to live on but i also understand and value the presence of the lord we sing a song i love i love your presence someone wondered if that was a an okay song to sing because we're supposed to love the lord i get it i understand that 100 but i want you to know something i have come to find that where he goes his presence goes with him and i just love oh you say what in the world do you mean haven't you ever had anybody in your life you just love being with people will criticize you they really will they'll criticize you because you have found somebody that you like being with but there are just people that you that you run into in life that you just like being with i can describe that person maybe not every detail but one is somebody i can trust somebody i can let my hair down with i don't have a bun to take out you know but somebody that you don't have to be anything but who you are you don't have to be religious you don't have to put on any kind of you're just you're just who you are you're just you're just who you are but i like to be with somebody who wants to talk about the things of the lord in the right timing in the right atmosphere what do you mean by that well i mean there's a time that you know the certain circumstances or the or the dynamic of a room or something or or you may be with people who don't really have full understanding of things you want to be careful sometimes what you lay out on the table what you say in front of others when folks are first coming into the truth you want to be wise and how you lay it out and what you say so there are times that you just can't completely talk freely the way you want to but if you can find somebody like that if you can find somebody hungry for what you're hungry for who longs for what you long for and you get in that place you just love there's nothing wrong with that folks there's nothing wrong with finding that place in your life i just want you to know it's so rare and of such value that if we don't treasure it and develop it and honor it we lose it it's so important to honor that kind of a place there's going to be others that you don't mind having fellowship with but you realize that at this point in your life you could never be fully comfortable and so you you do what you know you're supposed to do you show what you feel like you're supposed to show but you couldn't relax you you can't help that there's nothing wrong with that we are looking all of us for a place where we can just be be in his presence be in the faith walk in the truth without demand for performance how many of you just don't want to perform you don't have to struggle to keep a relationship going fight to have a friendship going you just want to trust one another and love one another and only god can do that for you but once you find that you just you light up when that person comes around i guess a relationship like that can even be misunderstood at times but you just light up when that kind of a person or that person comes around you don't have to be ashamed to love the presence of jesus christ i love his presence because i love when he comes when he comes his presence comes with him in his presence there is fullness of joy it's the desire of the lord jesus christ that his joy and delight is in us his gladness may be full measure and complete and overflowing in our life you believe that say amen now in in the in the church age book the smyrnan age brother branham makes this statement if you'll find it for me there this is part of what we have to work on doing it's just a short little paragraph there it starts off how shall i prove that's not it and how shall i prove my love to him he said and how shall i prove my love to him see we talked about really loving him how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy when you choose joy you're proving your love to him when you're determined to conduct yourself with joy amidst the trials there's going to be trial there's going to be hardship there's going to be sickness there's going to be all these things but you choose i'm going to conduct myself with joy i miss the trials he said how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom does what allows allows to come to pass you can prove your love by choosing to conduct yourself with joy come on now it's not that hard it's just something we have to do there are so many things here that i had marked to re do to go over again but i see my time is slipping away and i want to reserve some of my time so would you give me just a couple more quotes here i feel like i'd like to share them in a message why are you still here beaumont texas he said this in paragraph 41 but because that we do it that's the reason we're cursed that's the reason god's put this thing upon the church this cold and dampness we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the lord for pleasure i want you to know my true joy my true pleasure is found in the house of the lord i noticed that in a worship service if the worship service goes too long i can look around i start noticing people as they check out i don't even really get upset with them because i understand it's the way they've trained themselves it's what social media it's what our phones have done we've trained our brains we've shrunk our attention spans we have and we made it so easy to go from one thing to the next by the moving of the thumb and i literally know in church many many times when someone has thumb to me they've gone on to another thought they're on to something else this is the trick of the enemy when we get in that presence of the lord nothing should be able to pull us out of that place we should make up our mind i'm going to stay engaged till the last amen [Music] i am impressed with some of you who have this ability to endure you have this ability to press in all the way through and it's not just the young people in fact i find that the young people have the shortest attention spans i see even older ones they're going to be involved in the worship the position of their body may change but they never take their faith out of the deposit they stay right in there until the last hallelujah because they have learned in the trials of life the value the value of getting under his word the value of getting in his presence the value of abiding in the vine that's the reason god put this thing upon the church this cold and dampness we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the lord for pleasure the house of the lord [Music] is the joy of the lord i want you to wake up your neighbor in love just shake a little bit just in love no one's in trouble shake them a little bit just wake them up a little bit do i have to go back to talking about ice cream and berries and cookies get everybody alert i just want to make sure you're with me because we're coming into something now getting ready to close in the time we've reserved the house of the lord is the joy of the lord when we come together in his house and that's what we're talking about that's what he's talking about when we come together in his house with his people he goes on to say the joy of the lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy do you need a singing fish somebody gave me a singing fish one time my wife thrown it out eventually i said what'd you throw that out for i liked it don't worry be happy we need to be reminded sometime we need to be reminded sometime don't worry be happy he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and mind and power to god he wants you to do that but folks you can't do that unless you realize that you're a part of a church you're where you belong and you're pulling with instead of against but i know they don't really want me well listen folks some of you have family that doesn't really want you but you keep showing up have they ever refused a birthday present from you have they ever refused a christmas present from you if you give christmas presents i don't but if you do they may not want to hang with you but you're still family and they're going to they're going to accept you on that term if nothing else so the truth is this if you know that you know that you know that you know that you belong in this house if god has shown you that this is where you belong then with all your heart you're going to do everything within your power to take us to a higher place with your presence you're not going to come in here with a pout you're not going to come in here in anger you're not going to come in here with a glare you're not going to come in here walling your eyes when the service is going on you're not going to despise who's moving who's trying who's playing the instrument who's leading the worship you're going to put your heart in you're going to encourage your family to do the same you're going to focus on him you're going to come in he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to god he wants you to do that and here's the key if you can't do that then you need to find your spot you do where you can do that because some of you are just not doing it here you just need to you need to make up your mind i believe i heard the lord clearly this morning and i knew exactly what the atmosphere would be like if i got around to delaying that out because that's what we deal with now we have to gauge the atmosphere and make sure that everybody's in the right frame of mind to hear the word of the lord then we have to deal with all the repercussions of delivering the word of the lord and you know what it's getting so late it's getting so late couldn't we just decide it sounds like it's getting personal in here it's all right it's all right the word of god is sharp and it's personal and it gets right down into us i love visitors but i realize that every person doesn't belong here i realize i can't help everybody i realize that sometimes things happen and we can't get above them or around them or over them and we come to an impasse and we have to make up our mind do i want to do something to help do i really want to hinder do i really want to draw attention to myself or do i want to get under the burden of the house and glorify god with the right spirit if we could do that then these little spirits would find nobody to use they would find nobody to dwell in they wouldn't be jumping from person to person through the years but they would be so shut out of this house and i'm determined by the grace of god to keep pressing in until we can come into that kind of place i want every one of us to come into that kind of a place i want every one of us to put their shoulder to the plow and let's do what god has said for us to do let's see this house built let's see this campground built and finished somebody said you say the coming of the lord is die in hand and near the door it is but i want you to know it's not going to come and it's not going to happen until everything that god has said would do would be if it was really him then he is obligated to bring it to pass with the people who will cooperate with him somebody said i don't know anything else to do here it is he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfy if you're not satisfied you need to get satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and mind and power to god he wants you to do that why don't you go visit why don't you go visit visit some other churches do i sound mad do i look mad won't you go visit won't you start next sunday go visit there's all kinds of churches all kinds of labors if you don't have to have the message of the hour if you don't have to have a church that's built around the ministry that god gave one generation ago then you've got plenty of choices if you want a churches built around that ministry you're going to have to drive a little bit but that's okay because brother reed does and that's all right because the mikos do and that's all right because some of us did it's all right when you make up your mind the truth the truth the truth the truth the truth how many years did brother benny west and and sister jeannette their family would say to them why in the world do you drive all the way from huntsville you pass hundreds of churches why do you feel like you why do you feel like you have to go you just know when you know you know oh sister burgess she came in one time and she knew he said when i come to this church i was so dry my bones rattled but when i got in the presence of the lord went from wearing dress shoes to wearing tennis shoes she'd be in a nice dressing sweater and her tennis shoes because she came here well i got a hush i do i do i do can you give me a 158 of the lamb's book of life it's one one question when i read this i think of sister burgess now believer you can't have joy shoes flip-flops aren't joy shoes you're gonna break your neck leave them at home or at the beach you better get you some shoes you can praise god in i'm being serious you better get you some shoes you can praise god in you better come to the house of god determined to put your joy shoes on it doesn't mean you got to carry on like somebody else you just got to enter in enter in with your faith until the glory of the lord starts falling down over you don't look look i've been at this a long time now don't you think i know don't you think i can tell by somebody's countenance when they have touched his presence when they have allowed the presence of the lord to touch them at their don't you think i know that that person no longer looks like they're sucking on a persimmon they don't care if it's crooked they don't care if it's rotted they don't care if it's missing they just love you can't help you don't even care about those things when you get under the joy of the lord the presence of the lord hallelujah i'm conscious of my weight i'm conscious so many times in my weight but you just let the real presence of the lord come down and i don't care how much meat gets in motion i don't care if it's a few seconds after i stop before it all stops because i'm not here to be a show i'm here to let him know he's everything he's everything he's everything to me he's everything to me he's everything to me i don't want you to be miserable i don't want to be the reason for your misery i want you to have all the joy of the lord if you can't find it here go where you can find it sister burgess knew others knew you knew at one time in your life you knew i wouldn't want anybody to be bound but i made a vow to you i'll release you i release you from your vow i release you from your vow if the if a vow you made to me is keeping you here i release you from the vow but if you believe that you can find the help that you need here if you believe you can get under the anointing of the lord here you can come in and help us to move up to a higher place i see a higher place brother sister i see a higher place i see a higher place hallelujah just like it came tuesday two two two two two two two two closing doors and opening doors i see a higher place i see a higher place the world is going crazy over what russia is doing but you have an absolute truth god sent a message to you you don't have to fear i've got 12 pages i'll never this wasn't for today i've got 12 pages to hear what he said concerning russia and communism i'll share it with you he said there's three curtains we better remember he said we better watch these three curtains the iron curtain the bamboo curtain but it's the purple curtain that people better really watch it's instead of communism and some of these other things he said it's romanism serious churches every day i'm closing church is every day becoming more and more like a church that they they claim we've protested we've come out from under that we we're no longer walking in the in the doctrines and creeds and credences of the of the of the roman church and yet denominations are getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more like the roman church every day but you don't have to do that because you heard a message you had a clarion call you heard an eagle scream years ago that said come out of her come out of her come out of her my people do not be partakers with her inner sins you heard it you heard it anybody with me let's have the musicians hallelujah joy is a weapon it can be a spiritual weapon to see walls come down in your life why'd they shout why'd they blow the trumpets because they were told to simply because they trusted the word of the lord you need a prophet that you can have confidence in you need a pastor that you can have confidence in we need apostles that we can have confidence in teachers and evangelists that we can have confidence in amen because if we don't then we are never coming to a place of really feeling at ease and when i say at ease i mean at peace i don't mean in slackness i mean we gotta know once you know once you know you can't hardly wait to get back in that atmosphere we recognize that services are not the same some are more glorious it seems than others we need them all we need them all we need victories and we need those low solemn moments of sanctity and sacredness among us we need that we need that we need services where everyone's crying we need services where everyone's dancing every service is not the same but once you know once you know once you know once you know that you have found what your heart is looking for then you have an obligation to put everything you've got behind that it's just right and start you somebody said how in the world will i do it how will i ever fight my way out one way is to make up your mind to find the joy of the lord bubbling in your life again somebody said it seems to me like you're hanging all the joy on the motion well here's the one thing i found about joy joy needs an expression [Music] you want to explode you want to explode you want to be you want to make a mess in here you want to lock the joy up that's supposed to be funny you can smile now you want to lock it up you want to hold it back [Applause] you want to quench the spirit or do you want to let the spirit of god move in you and through you and joy is not a luxury joy of the lord is not optional somebody said well sometimes you have the joy and sometimes you don't we're not talking about your feeling we're talking about the joy of the lord the joy of the lord don't come and go the joy of the lord abides as long as you're abiding in him the joy of the lord is abiding in you joy is a continual demonstration of our full and complete trust in the lord jesus christ i was supposed to be further over here and i wanted to talk about getting your joy back but i'll say that for another time the last thing i'm going to share with you is from a message possessing all things paragraph 100. someone is talking to brother branham they said brother branham i wish i had joy you can have it you can have it you're just letting satan rob you from the privileges that christ died for now i tell you i read this to you a few weeks ago i'm reading it to you again and it stirs the same human emotion in me that it stirred the first time i read it it makes me mad it makes me mad it makes me mad at the devil to think that he can sneak into your life and rob you of the privileges that he didn't do anything to get to you what a thief what a dirty rotten lowdown accuser destroyer a thief rob you from the privileges that christ died for he said i'm an heir to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs to me belongs to you we're his children we're heirs of it everything that he died for would you stand with me everything he died for his mind would you say that everything he died for is mine say it again everything he died for is mind his mind it's mine it's mine we're ready to worship it's mine it's mine now what would it be what will it be folks what will it be are you willing to fight for your joy are you willing to fight for your peace are you willing to press your way in until you come to a place of faith where you say to the enemy no more no more no more there's a gift of intercession in your life that gets damned up it doesn't mind it does in every intercessor's life the enemy comes to dam up that intercession sometimes i'm not just talking about woodward in our prayer life because i find it's much easier to pray and intercede when i'm by myself than in the house of the lord but i look back there some some of the things that was moving and i saw it jennifer and i saw a bearabeth and i thought about the times in their younger years when god would move so mightily on them i thought of angela how god would move so mighty all these thoughts this morning since i've been here god would move so mightily on them and they would intercede and travail and god would honor that he would honor that and the atmosphere would shift and life happens stuff comes along and maybe we still can find victory at home maybe we still are pressing in to these places of intercession when we're away but how many of you know there are gifts for us and there are gifts for the body and god wants you to bring your gift with you when you come and he wants you to hold it out to him every sunday morning 10 minutes until church time we meet in the back to pray and every sunday we pray whatever's in our hearts but every sunday we say at least this lord every gift in this room you gave it and now we bring them back to you [Music] every time i say that i think of the accident and i think of when brother billy paul got to the car wreck and he said to brother branham daddy speak the word brother branham turned his head because he knew that the gift that god had given him was not his own it was a gift for the people most of the gifts that we carry in our life are gifts that we can bring into his presence and say lord use it's not really mine it it's mine because you released it to me but it's not mine to use however i want to use it it's mine to be used in the service of the lord so we pray over the musicians and the singers and those who have a part oh god use these gifts pour your oil on them the bible tells us that these prophetic things and things that god does in our life this way are not for private interpretation they're to be used for the benefit and the growth of the body of christ so if you recognize this morning that there is a gifting in your life that is not being not being exercised in the presence of the lord when he begins to move now we can't all prophesy at the same time we can't all speak out at the same time we can't all draw the attention in our direction at the same time there has to be an order when you're standing here and you know that you've got something fresh not the same thing that you say over and over and over again but you've got something fresh the lord is moving on you and you want to release that you need to do that because that moment can't be regained it can't be captured again if you feel like the lord is telling you to go and pray for someone i don't care if they reject you i don't care if they get stiff as a board and will not allow the spirit of god to begin to break and crack that shell they live under you obey the lord then it's off of you you have no more responsibility in that except to keep praying that god's perfect will would be done in that precious life but don't you go out of here dejected you go out of here knowing that god has a sovereign time and a sovereign way he will not force you against your will not yet in this hour not yet in this hour but i feel that the hour is coming when if we reject the easy way out we'll come out the hard way but we're coming out we're coming out because he loves us and he's going to bring us out don't you be damned up i know i know that sometimes the enemy will work on your mind and don't you do that you just make up your mind let me tell you something praising the lord and and being an example to others in praise that's a gift when some of you press your way up here there's a determination about your movement that lets me know you're not doing it to be seen you're not doing it to be seen you're doing it to draw up under his hand to get right up under his presence and i tell you it breathes life into an atmosphere and when there's a distracted atmosphere just sometimes that unified movement and everyone kind of moving together in the spirit one mind one accord this is why i'm preaching the way i'm preaching today is the power of coming together with a vision and a goal to see the atmosphere raised to the highest possible level so that jesus can walk among us and do anything and everything that he wants us to do wants to do among us kill every cancer cell and deliver every person this is what we're after we're not here for entertaining now let god use you because you're a part of his plan you're a part of his program let's worship the lord this morning none of this has gone the way i planned and i'm just going to say bless his name healing is here lord there's healing needed in this house let's worship him he is he you're the great physician [Music] healing is here and i received that's part of it and healing is here to recognize that he's in the midst healing is here hallelujah oh yes the healing is if you need healing just lay it before him right now and i believe how many of you know there's more than one kind of healing maybe you need inner healing i reach my hands to the heavens [Music] my health comes

don't want to i've already wore the people out but i want us to sing one more hallelujah thank you jesus [Music] lord if you'll just help us it's already done [Music] the battle is over the victory [Music] it's already [Music] and it's already done it's already done oh the battle is over the victory [Music] it's already done [Music] it's already done it's already done oh the path is over the victory is the one oh it's already [Music] is one oh it's already done [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh the victory is [Music] [Music] is [Music] and it's already done [Music] victory [Music] i want you to listen very carefully we have a sweet little baby to dedicate this morning and i was trying to reserve time for something else as well i want you to bow your head just a moment i felt like when i woke up this morning i was supposed to offer prayer and that's the reason i wanted to save my strength i didn't quite succeed [Music] i don't want to pray for those of you that we pray for every week and i don't want you to be offended at my saying that [Music] i want to reserve the strength that i have for someone that may be here today and you may say in your mind i must break out of my tomb [Music] i feel quite boxed in and i'm desperate to be free and i'm so willing to lay aside everything else to get that freedom to find that release that relief and i want to be prayed for this morning if you just slip up your hand is there anyone else all right i want those of you who raised your hand to step forward those of you who didn't step back just a little bit i love every one of you i do and i want to pray for you and if i get an energy if the anointing falls and i find strength in my body i'll do it [Music] this has been a very unusual week i had some sort of reaction to the anesthesia and i've been fighting my way back i'm so thankful for the grace of god his strength here this morning that's one two three four brother david five six brother reid is six one two three four five six are there i want to others who you are now all right i want this body to gather around these because the way it was laid in my heart god would meet he will meet these you may not see any physical reaction i don't know what what will happen what you'll see but i just felt like in my heart this morning when i woke up that i would make a call like that and that god would meet these in a profound way and i believe he can meet you this is not to put it in my hands he can meet you you don't need me for that so if i sounded like i thought you did pardon me forgive me that was not what i meant but when i woke up this morning he was talking to me about the easy way and the hard way and i believe there are those who are being given a choice a chance an opportunity you can have deliverance the easy way and that's come and be prayed for and believe god with all your heart or you can have it the hard way and i'm telling you church somebody ought to listen somebody ought to listen somebody said i just don't believe god works that way it doesn't matter what you that doesn't matter read the book [Music] read the bible he does he has a god ordained way if you don't come that way you're gonna come but it's not always pleasant and you see he sees the heart we know impart we think in part we see in part but he knows the heart god took me back this morning as i was laying there in bed to a time in 1997 when this church had a terrible split my nerves were bad and i thought i was losing my mind and brother greeley was so faithful and so instrumental god powerfully used him in that dark period there was a spirit that come against the body and it started on a woman [Music] happened to be somebody i deeply cared about and deeply loved she couldn't seem to help herself it just started tormenting her because she realized that as the church was growing she was losing some control some influence it was such a sad thing her son said to me one day i'm going to tell you exactly because he knew how god had been dealing with my heart he said i'm going to tell you exactly how this is going to play out that spirit that's on her if she doesn't get help it's not going to be satisfied until it gets my daddy stirred up and when it gets my daddy stirred up that's it if she can get the help she needs we might see an end to this but if she doesn't get out from under that thing while there's a ch an opportunity it'll get on him and that'll be the end of it he'll do everything he can to destroy i've seen this happen and that blew my mind i couldn't even imagine that that was possible but that young man was right that's exactly how that thing did she couldn't get out from under it she was offered prayer it only strengthened her stand it made her feel more justified instead of more humble precious woman and it didn't stop until it got him all stirred up and there was no stopping it then it was like a a snowball out of control no amount of praying or crying or carrying on that anybody did could stop that from unfolding and god spoke and he said didn't i tell you that the waters of separation would flow through this place and that i would do i would use it for my glory no no none of us who lived it would ever want to go back to a time like that but for some reason as i woke up this morning and god was speaking to me about the easy way and the more difficult way this is what came in my mind i watched how spirits operate and how they move from person to person and how they flow and and i i i just wish that everybody could see and discern but it's obvious that it's just not everybody's gift but i know that god can deliver he is a deliverer and he doesn't just want to take the surface off he wants to go right down to the root so that it's dug out and there's total freedom total freedom and so i knew this morning that i was to offer prayer for the desperate and that may have nothing to do with what i just said for for most of them but that was the reason why i offered prayer this way i want you to join with me now and i know it's late i just you know it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter at this point doesn't matter what matters to me is that those who have come making up their mind i'm in a tomb and i want to get out of the tomb i want them to be ministered to don't you i want them to be ministered to so i want the body to come and stand behind them brothers behind brothers and sisters upon sisters round sisters we're going to worship we're going to go right back into that song i don't know what these needs are i don't even want to stop to hear them it's not important for you to tell me what your tomb looks like but it is important that you let jesus bring you out of it amen you let him bring you out of it now i'm going to pray first for these six that came and we'll see what the lord will do remember you don't have to have my prayers it's not about that it's about you reaching out and touching him right now let's worship just a moment build that atmosphere right back and we'll come in it's already done hallelujah jesus and it's already done hallelujah hallelujah we believe you lord we believe your battle is over the victory is the one and it's already done and it's already done [Music] oh the battle is over the victories [Music] [Music] this is how i want to do it i want the focus on the person here we're going down the line i want all your faith over here that way we're not divided we're all doing the same thing put all your faith in this direct come down brother greeley all your faith right now for sarah she's desperate she wants to be free [Music] she's got to have it she's touching the lord there's no reason why i don't see any reason why she can't have the freedom she desires right now i don't see any reason why she can't come out of this tomb if you and i will agree together so let's do it lead us in that worship as we prepare it's already done the lord we decree and declare over our sister that it's already done oh it's already done what we're doing here is just carrying out in obedience to your willful hell [Music] oh it's all right we don't have to convince you we don't have to persuade you lord to move we don't have to beg you to lose we don't have to plead with you to move all we have to do and in the name of the lord jesus christ we come against every contrary spirit [Music] and the [Music] i believe you're going to honor this fight god i'm asking you hey [Music] in the name of jesus [Music] we stand in his stand as he has called us as history and i'm already here and we loose you in the name of the lord jesus christ that is life [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] victory [Music] in the name of jesus oh it's already done [Music] hallelujah the battle is over the victory is one and it's already [Music] see there's nothing to prevent you from doing that and it's [Music]

receive it in faith [Music] victory [Music] that's where your victory lies this morning that's where your victory is is by the power of your own confession [Music] he hates your confession of faith he's a liar the father of all eyes and it's already dead and the strength of the lord [Music] we take authority over every power of darkness we take authority over the tomb that our sister has acknowledged that the enemy has tried to box her in you see every lie that he has told her you see the oppression of her mind you see what the enemy's trying to do in her body you see how her imagination has gone wild because of what the enemy has tried to do in boxing her in but today we stand in the name of the lord jesus christ and we call it as and and decree and declare it does not have to be this way freedom is hers deliverance is hers you sense your word to deliver you sent your word to set free go ahead that's it go ahead let the holy ghost push every bit let the holy ghost

or something you've been so good to us this morning lord give me just a minute you've been so good to us jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god has been particularly good to the families of this church through the years he's blessed them with healthy children you look around in the world and you see so many sick children sick babies sick toddlers and so many suffering cancer everywhere we've been so blessed all these years to have beautiful i mean we can't help it if we have the prettiest babies in the world here but we have some of the most beautiful children here with the sweetest spirits i'm so thankful i know arielle is a little bit i don't think she's quiet when she's with her friends but you can say something turned she'll blush a little bit but i'm so thankful that the lord touched her i just looked up and she was singing she was just singing that's what it takes some time you just enter in and if these little babies in the arms if they live long enough and we're we're here long enough on this earth they'll all experience that same touch of his presence aren't we blessed to be able to show our children that there's a way to experience god it is by faith it's not by feeling but oh how wonderful it is to feel his presence god has been so good with all that has gone on the pandemic and all the changes in our world he has blessed rj and miss emily with a beautiful baby girl to go along with the handsome boy that god gave him a couple years back now we're going to pray over sophia we're going to have her dad to dedicate her back to the lord and we're gonna have the family to come now and i'm i'm kind of a wet mess but nobody cares i wish that was a little more put together for you [Music] all i've only been close to her once or twice since she was born to be able to see her i got to hold her she's just precious you know why because she's from god mom and daddy come together and they do their part and a little body is formed and but only jesus only god decides the inner spirit that goes into that little baby there's something that god gives them that we couldn't give them if we wanted to we just believe that god will unfold his perfect plan for her life he didn't just make her beautiful he put gifts in her merkava are you all going to say merkava or merkava i know that it's uh it's a hebrew word that can mean wheel it also means throne it's it's a descriptive hebrew word for the throne of god but i'm going to say a very non-feminine thing a very masculine thing the most success the most successful tanks in the israeli army are merkavas uh they were specially designed to be able to roll over anything they built this amazing tank and it was vulnerable on the bottom so they had to keep redesigning and redesigning and redesigning until they could come up with one that couldn't be penetrated from the top or the sides or the bottom so when i see her that's what i'm going to think i'm going to think of how the lord is fortifying her and protecting her she's already come through a little bout of sickness that could have been serious god's grace marvelous grace she came through it like a little champion aren't we blessed to have a part in this today is it all right if i hold her i don't even have a sniffle right now [Music] oh my oh my no more complaints about how light you felt you've been eating good now you feel about right you feel about right would you reach your hands toward this beautiful baby hallelujah lord jesus we thank you for her we thank you for her life we thank you for her mom and dad and she is certainly a gift to them and a product of of their love one for another but it was you who created her formed her in her mother's womb and it was you who allowed a spirit to enter into her little life the breath of god is what made her a living soul and lord you ordained and chose a name for her a gracious name an appropriate name she is fortified she is strengthened she has an appointment at the throne and lord i just ask for your mighty blessing to fall upon her i want to give you thanks for bringing her through that old virus and making her whole hallelujah i thank you lord jesus from the top of her head the little soles of her feet that there would be nothing of that that would remain that there would be no long-term effect that it would all be so far removed from her in the name of jesus that it would be as though she she never walked through it you were gracious to her mom and dad to help him through a difficult time lord i ask you to wrap her up she's at peace right now thank you for your wonderful peace i ask you to wrap her up in your loving that she would grow to love you lord like mom and dad like her grandparents like her family around her thank you for making her for such a time as this may she serve you every day of her life i thank you for protecting her from any harm that the enemy would desire to bring to her in the wonderful name of the lord jesus we bless her amen and amen you see how peaceful she is so now you all bring her to me sometime when you can't calm her down look at that that's very it's a little bit unusual yes but don't i look a mess oh well it is what it is i can barely see out of my glasses did you see okay daddy i know i could just keep you would you all bring a mic down here now daddy's got you praise the lord

this life that you've placed in sophia lord yes and we just even decree today that she is yours yours lord your banner over her is love amen and we just commit her into your hands today oh god lord i recognize that often in life you bring us through circumstances and trials that are difficult lord but i thank you that you're the good shepherd that you lead us along yes that you hold us lord when we can't walk on our own yes you do and we just commit sophia into your hands today lord that you would outwork your perfect will in your life lord that you would use her according to the plans that you've ordained before the foundations of the world lord let it be so in her life in the name of yeshua the messiah yes may she find her refuge in you oh god always every day lord may your ears be opened to your voice yes and may you draw and call her by your spirit o lord may she walk uniquely with you lord as few have in the earth but as you've called your bride to in these last days oh god may she be a sign in these end times lord of your goodness and your grace yes we just sanctify her oh god and commit her into your hands and dedicate her in the name of yeshua the messiah the lord jesus christ for your glory and your honor oh god we thank you today in jesus name amen reach your hand toward the family lord jesus we thank you for the family that loves her so much there's nothing that they wouldn't do to help her because they love her so i pray o god that you will strengthen them and that you will use them may they speak words of wisdom and life into her life may they fight as hard as necessary in the spirit to protect her from any onslaught of the enemy and we pray for the family that wouldn't be here today couldn't be here today that you will also use them and strengthen them and bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you all turn around and let them get them good look some some of them say they don't see enoch oh wow he's look at that he's

time with him let that be the drive of your life so shauna asks that we pray for her nathan i was about to let it slip my mind but we want to do that come on we love them we're thankful for what god has done his glorious work of restoration let me say again how wonderful it is to have the minkos back with us this morning we missed them they saw a vehicle in the in the parking lot early it didn't recognize whose it was i think it might be brother reed but they didn't recognize who it was and they said i think it may be the menkos we found out no it wasn't them but in a few minutes we saw him come in and i was so glad tell me now what we're praying for we come you're dismissed as far as i'm not gonna come back and say anything at the end but how about we just come as a body and we just stand around them she's coming very close to her due date there have been lots of complications along the way and she's just not sure when her last service that she would be able to attend would be it could be today it might not be so this is our opportunity but don't stop praying today pray all the way through it amen oh i just love church growth i get excited about it reach your love this way father i thank you so much for nathan and shoshanna they're a very important part of our lives and a part of this church and nathan has been for such a long time and you blessed him with the wife that you had made for him and you blessed her with a husband that you had made for her and we get to be a part of it we saw the pain in their life we saw the loss we saw the grief and now lord we have seen the joy like everything you you do there are complications along the way and these physical bodies sometimes have a hard time keeping up with the perfect plan of god there's so much working against the body in this hour physically but i thank you that you have brought our sister this far by the grace of god grace marvelous amazing grace we lay our hands over her now knowing that when you created this body you created it to give birth you made it thus it's a miracle it's your design it's not without pain it's not without complication she's known a lot of that but god you saw all of this from the very beginning you have not brought her this far to leave her now and she needs you more now lord in these last days even then she has to this point i ask you for the presence of god to be upon her now to shadow her over overshadow her wrap her surround her spiritually oh god breathe breath and life hope and strength and physically god from the top of her head to the soles of her feet every cell every system every organ let the very grace of god be upon it the healing virtue of the lamb we thank you god for your divine presence that will be there when this little baby comes that it'll come with grace that you will be with the midwife and those who will assist you'll be with dad and you'll be with all the family members anxiously waiting to hear the good news we just decree that no weapon formed against this life could prosper can't can't do it it's a promise from god and lord we just ask for strength and perfect healing and lots of that grace be on nathan lord i think it's the hardest thing that dad has to go through is knowing there's not much that he can do to see your wife going through that and love her so much and wish you could take it and wish you could bear it wish there was something else you could do lord just cover him in that moment let his complete faith and confidence be in you give him great wisdom lord and walking out the beauty of this thing we're all going to dance we're all going to rejoice when your perfect plan has unfolded in this little baby's life for the glory of god for the glory of god every detail yes having the midwife ready at the right time and knowing when to call and all those things that can stress you out we will not have that we're going to give it to god in peace may she walk in perfect peace in the name of the lord jesus christ yes hallelujah we love you both we love this baby promise from god hallelujah you don't have to get here for us to love it but it's coming god bless you as you go out thank you jesus
