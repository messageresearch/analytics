[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:02] Shelley of New Hope revival ministries
[1:04] and I'm coming to you again today in
[1:07] partnership with our great friends at
[1:10] the gospel channel I really appreciate
[1:14] the fine work that the folks at the
[1:16] gospel channel are doing to help get the
[1:20] gospel I like it gospel channel good
[1:23] news channel to help get the good news
[1:26] to you even if you're already a believer
[1:29] you can you can certainly use some good
[1:32] news a reminder of truth perhaps that
[1:37] you have already known but I like to be
[1:40] reminded sometimes seems like the older
[1:42] we get the more often we have to be
[1:44] reminded about certain things so I just
[1:47] believe that the gospel channel is
[1:49] reaching people who have never committed
[1:52] their lives to the Lord I believe there
[1:54] are those who are coming to the Lord
[1:57] accepting salvation through Jesus Christ
[2:00] because of the work of the gospel
[2:02] channel I believe that people are able
[2:05] to connect share their prayer requests
[2:07] and have somebody to come alongside of
[2:11] them and join faith with them and I
[2:14] believe prayers are being answered all
[2:16] of that also a part of the gospel
[2:18] channel and the gospel channel gives
[2:22] many different ministries an opportunity
[2:26] to be highlighted to go forward and to
[2:29] do what they are called to do and we
[2:31] just have appreciated for so many years
[2:34] now the relationship that the Lord has
[2:37] given us with brother Eric Erickson and
[2:40] all of the staff at the gospel channel
[2:42] and we're just thankful that we're
[2:46] reaching out we know that people are
[2:48] watching because we hear from you we
[2:50] have phone calls that come in and emails
[2:53] that come in with both prayer requests
[2:56] and praise reports so we just say keep
[2:58] them coming if you'd like more of our
[3:02] ministry you can visit YouTube we have
[3:04] our own channel on YouTube and I know
[3:07] that you would be blessed if you
[3:09] subscribed and you're notified of
[3:12] additional content when it's added you
[3:14] can visit our website at revival dot
[3:17] o-r-g we just want to stay connected
[3:20] with you and we want you to know when
[3:23] you send in your prayer request and we
[3:25] print them out and we take them before
[3:27] the Lord
[3:28] we don't just forget about them I want
[3:31] you to know that on a daily basis I I go
[3:34] back through I look over the prayer
[3:36] requests either on the computer or the
[3:39] copies that we have printed out and I
[3:41] pray again and if there's a name
[3:44] attached to it I call the name out and
[3:46] if it's a on occasion it might be a
[3:49] little difficult for me to pronounce but
[3:50] I do the best I can and I know the Lord
[3:53] knows who you are and so we just feel
[3:56] very connected with you even though
[3:59] you're on the other end of this camera
[4:01] and I can't look through the camera and
[4:03] see you we feel connected and we just
[4:06] know that we're standing together for
[4:10] the good work of the Lord to continue to
[4:14] be done because well I don't know about
[4:16] you but I believe that we are getting
[4:19] close very close to that beautiful time
[4:23] of rapture when the Lord will come for
[4:26] his elected bride I believe that and we
[4:31] have so much to be thankful for in this
[4:34] hour I know that many are getting ready
[4:37] to celebrate holidays with their loved
[4:40] ones we have already had our American
[4:44] Thanksgiving and soon many will be
[4:47] celebrating Christmas and my family we
[4:50] identify with our Jewish roots with our
[4:54] biblical roots and I think you've heard
[4:58] me say before on the program that I
[5:00] found out some years ago that my
[5:03] great-grandparents were Lithuanian Jews
[5:06] who came to this country and for many
[5:10] many years they hid their Jewishness and
[5:14] it was just really a sovereign
[5:18] wonderful blessing in my life to
[5:20] discover many years later it explained
[5:23] why I have always had since I was 11
[5:27] years old and I visited Israel the first
[5:30] time I've had such a connection with the
[5:33] land and with the people so at my house
[5:37] even though we believe with all of our
[5:39] hearts that Jesus is the Messiah Yeshua
[5:43] is our Messiah our Savior he died on the
[5:48] cross and shed his blood to save us to
[5:51] redeem us but even though we believe
[5:53] that we also identify with the season of
[5:57] dedication or the season of Hanukkah
[6:00] which means dedication and so in our
[6:03] home during the same time of the year
[6:07] very very close usually to when
[6:10] Christmas is celebrated we like the
[6:13] menorah and each night and we remember
[6:18] the goodness of God we remember that he
[6:22] is a provider and we remember a courage
[6:26] you know the story of Hanukkah is one of
[6:29] courage and it's one of no compromise
[6:32] the Greek culture was closing in on the
[6:37] Jewish people in fact it was they were
[6:41] told you can no longer worship God in
[6:44] your way and you can no longer keep the
[6:47] Sabbath you can no longer celebrate the
[6:50] Feast of the Lord in fact it it could be
[6:53] said that it was illegal to practice
[6:56] your Judaism your religion the only
[6:59] religion that the Jews knew anything
[7:01] about and so it was a very difficult
[7:04] time and thank God there were those who
[7:08] said you know we love living but our
[7:11] lives are not as valuable as protecting
[7:15] what we know to be the God of the Bible
[7:18] the truth and so there was a great army
[7:22] of really common men who who just raised
[7:27] up following Judah Maccabees and
[7:32] they stood against the the tyranny and
[7:36] the destruction of the Greek leaders
[7:39] that were coming in and you know there
[7:43] was great defilement you may remember
[7:45] you can read about it in the book of
[7:47] Maccabees which is a part of the
[7:49] Apocrypha but they destroyed much of the
[7:53] sanctuary of the temple they offered
[7:56] swine's blood on the altar and they
[7:59] stole the gold and the silver away and
[8:02] this family you know was responsible to
[8:05] lead people back into the sanctuary that
[8:09] had been defiled to clean it to scrub it
[8:12] to remove the defiled altar and stones
[8:14] and and to like the golden candle stick
[8:18] again and and and just say God lives God
[8:22] lives no matter what so this is
[8:26] something that we like to remember every
[8:28] year because Jesus is certainly the
[8:32] light of the world and we also know that
[8:35] many people are busy making their
[8:38] Christmas plans and it can be a
[8:41] wonderful time for families to get
[8:43] together share a meal but but please you
[8:48] know I just ask you humbly make
[8:52] everything you do about the Lord and
[8:55] lift him up no matter what the season is
[8:59] and for myself I wouldn't want to offend
[9:03] any of you but for myself I don't I
[9:06] don't get all carried away in the in the
[9:09] in the spirit of Christmas the
[9:11] celebration of Christmas I find that it
[9:14] has ended up being something that really
[9:19] no longer reflects what many people
[9:23] believed it was supposed to be about in
[9:25] the beginning and that is the light of
[9:26] the world Jesus our salvation I think
[9:30] people get more excited with their trees
[9:32] and their decorations and they're
[9:34] swapping presents and credit card bills
[9:36] and going into debt and and
[9:39] if Jesus ever was a part of it he
[9:42] certainly left out today but what I
[9:45] would encourage you to do during your
[9:47] festivity is to is to put the Lord the
[9:52] center of whatever it is that you do I
[9:55] don't say particularly that people have
[9:58] to do it the way we do it but I just
[10:01] believe that it would be really good to
[10:04] step away from the commercialism and the
[10:07] secularism of this time of year and let
[10:10] every season be about Jesus and you know
[10:14] gather your family together and tell
[10:17] them you know that it's all about the
[10:21] king of kings and the Lord of lords and
[10:23] he's bigger than any one day or any one
[10:26] celebration he's bigger than mistletoe
[10:30] and Santa Claus and all of that stuff
[10:32] that people get so excited about and see
[10:35] if you can get your family excited about
[10:37] the gospel you know I'm not trying to be
[10:40] religious I'm just trying to stay with
[10:42] the word but see if you could get your
[10:44] folks to be excited about the fact that
[10:46] we're saved you know if we've repented
[10:49] of our sins if we've been baptized in
[10:52] the lovely name of Jesus and filled with
[10:54] the Holy Spirit of God we are set apart
[10:57] from this old world and we we are about
[11:00] to make an exit from time into eternity
[11:04] we talked a lot about eternity on our
[11:07] recent program with you we talked about
[11:10] in in the scriptures when the fullness
[11:13] of the time had come God sent forth I
[11:18] can I don't know what it is but I can
[11:21] hardly quote that verse without getting
[11:24] emotional and it's because it's so big
[11:28] what the Lord has done and Galatians 4
[11:31] and verses 1 through 7 is what we read
[11:36] but let me just skip down even so we
[11:39] when we were children were in bondage
[11:41] under the elements of the world but when
[11:45] the fullness of the time was come here
[11:47] here it is this is why we breathe this
[11:51] is why we live
[11:53] God sent forth his son made in such a
[12:00] humble and unusual way the Bible said
[12:03] made of a woman made under the law to
[12:07] redeem them that were under the law
[12:11] hallelujah that we might receive the
[12:14] adoption of sons this is such good news
[12:19] because God the word of God the Living
[12:23] Word of God became flesh and dwelt among
[12:27] us reflecting the glory of the father
[12:29] that we might be saved yes but he also
[12:34] came that we might understand by the
[12:38] Holy Spirit that we might sit under his
[12:42] tutoring even as the natural-born son of
[12:46] the of the Orient who though he were a
[12:50] born a son he wasn't much different than
[12:54] than the servants it tells us in verse 1
[12:57] though he was really Lord of all because
[13:00] he had to learn what it means to operate
[13:03] in the authority of a son of the father
[13:07] and so not only did Jesus Yeshua come to
[13:11] save us but he came also to to give us
[13:16] the Holy Spirit life that we might be
[13:19] able to learn what it means to express
[13:22] the authority that comes with being a
[13:26] son of God remember the Bible tells us
[13:30] as many as are led by the Spirit of God
[13:33] they are the sons of God and I get
[13:37] excited when I start talking about that
[13:40] and you know in our program recently we
[13:44] were talking about finding ourselves in
[13:47] a place sometimes where we feel like we
[13:51] don't know what tomorrow holds we are so
[13:54] unsure of the rest of the day we're not
[13:58] sure what tonight's gonna bring much
[14:01] less tomorrow and it can be a fearful
[14:03] thing when circum
[14:05] census of your life become so shaky and
[14:09] so unsure it can be such an unsettling
[14:14] thing even in the life of a believer and
[14:17] it's in that moment of uncertainty that
[14:20] we have to remember that God knew every
[14:26] one of our days before we were ever born
[14:30] of our mother and father here on the
[14:34] earth and he knew our choices both good
[14:37] and bad and he knew the path that we
[14:40] would follow both his path and at times
[14:43] our own path God knew that he saw that
[14:48] and he made provision not only for our
[14:52] salvation but he made provision that he
[14:56] might one day come and not just be a God
[15:00] above us or a God with us Emmanuel the
[15:04] Lord Jesus Christ but that by the power
[15:07] of the Holy Ghost he might also be God
[15:11] in us walking in us occupying our body
[15:17] this is the fullness of the adoption of
[15:21] sons and this really opens up a
[15:26] dimension of authority that we are
[15:30] hopefully beginning to learn beginning
[15:34] to understand what God wants to do in
[15:37] our lives here in the end time this
[15:42] great army of sons that are being
[15:45] tutored that are being trained better
[15:48] being prepared this little bride of
[15:51] Jesus Christ you said a great army she
[15:53] is indeed a great army because the Lord
[15:57] Himself is our captain and he is great
[16:00] in us and so there is a remnant people
[16:05] that are being prepared and I just want
[16:08] to share some verses of Scripture with
[16:10] you today that will help you to to
[16:13] perhaps find some stability when when
[16:17] the ground around you is che
[16:19] he shot these places down these
[16:22] scriptures down and go back to them when
[16:25] you feel like hey what's going on in my
[16:28] crazy life how am I ever gonna get
[16:31] myself sorted out and pulled up by my
[16:34] own bootstraps to be able to go on these
[16:37] are verses that I find a great amount of
[16:40] peace and comfort in the first place I'd
[16:44] like to read it it's in the Book of
[16:46] Psalms Psalm 139 verses 12 through 17
[16:52] yay the darkness hide if not from thee
[16:56] but the night shine if as the day the
[17:00] darkness and the light are both alike to
[17:04] thee for thou hast possessed my reigns
[17:09] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[17:14] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[17:19] and wonderfully made this to me is a
[17:23] great promise of assurance that God my
[17:28] father my Creator was very much involved
[17:32] with my formation even in the womb of my
[17:37] mother he was covering me
[17:41] it says marvelous are thy works and that
[17:45] my soul right knoweth right well my
[17:50] substance was not hid from thee when I
[17:54] was made in secret God knew every detail
[18:01] of my conception and from the moment
[18:06] that the seed and the egg joined
[18:10] together in conception God was there
[18:15] mindful of my life that was being formed
[18:20] and how could he be so mindful because
[18:23] way before the moment of my conception
[18:26] he knew me he said my substance was not
[18:31] hid from thee
[18:32] when I was made in secret and curiously
[18:35] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[18:39] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[18:46] being unperfect this is a very important
[18:50] part of this passage of Scripture and in
[18:54] my books all my members were written
[18:58] which in continuance were fashioned when
[19:05] as yet there was none of them how
[19:10] precious also are thy thoughts unto me O
[19:15] God how great is the sum of them what a
[19:20] song of praise what a psalm of praise
[19:25] even in my mother's womb even when my
[19:31] substance was yet unformed and all my
[19:35] members every part of who I am my being
[19:39] was already written and recorded in your
[19:43] book let me read verses sixteen to you
[19:47] again and this time let me read it in
[19:51] the complete Jewish Bible by dr. David
[19:55] Stern this is Psalm 139 verse 16
[20:00] complete Jewish Bible your eyes could
[20:04] see me as an embryo but in your book let
[20:08] me just pause for a moment not to offend
[20:11] but to tell you life is precious to God
[20:17] our Creator let me say to you that
[20:20] according to the scripture you were in
[20:25] God's view you were in his sight in your
[20:30] mother's womb even as an embryo even
[20:35] before you were born
[20:37] physically in the earth you had value to
[20:42] God and you were in his
[20:45] so let's always pray for the protection
[20:50] of the sanctity of human life let's give
[20:55] thanks to God that life is his creation
[21:01] and it is precious and that it should be
[21:04] valued and any society that doesn't
[21:08] value human life even before it is
[21:13] expressed in natural birth it's missing
[21:16] the truth of the scripture I was being
[21:20] formed in my mother's womb nine months
[21:23] before I was expressed in physical birth
[21:27] in the earth and God watched over me
[21:31] every day of that nine months watching
[21:34] over my formation even all my members
[21:38] before they were joined together and and
[21:42] my various systems and organs of my body
[21:47] began to develop I was on God's radar so
[21:51] to speak and so please I just encourage
[21:56] you be be so very careful when you are
[22:00] thinking about these things be very
[22:04] careful when you are perhaps not not
[22:08] being smart you know not not being
[22:13] concerned about the consequences of the
[22:19] relationship that you're in and what
[22:23] might come a little life that might be
[22:27] formed and once that little life is
[22:31] formed it deserves to have a chance it
[22:35] deserves to live out its days on on
[22:38] planet Earth we've got to make good
[22:42] choices for the sanctity of life now
[22:45] that might get me in trouble with some
[22:48] folks but I know with many of you it
[22:50] will not because it's just the word so
[22:53] back to verse 16 in the complete Jewish
[22:57] Bible
[22:59] your eyes could see me as an embryo but
[23:03] in your book all my days were already
[23:08] written Here I am just an embryo in my
[23:15] mother's womb but every one of my days
[23:18] I'm 50 years old and every one of those
[23:23] 50 years was written in God's book about
[23:28] me what I would do what I would
[23:30] accomplish what I wouldn't do what I
[23:32] would choose what I would reject who I
[23:36] would marry what my children would
[23:39] become what their names would be every
[23:42] bit of that recorded in God's book all
[23:46] my days it says were already written
[23:52] already known of God and already
[23:56] recorded in the books of heaven I take
[24:02] comfort in that one time I was talking
[24:06] with an intellectual and he said well
[24:08] that that that really disturbs me
[24:11] because then he said I feel more like a
[24:14] rat in an experiment somewhere with some
[24:18] scientists somewhere ruling my life I
[24:22] said oh no that's not what this is at
[24:25] all you're misunderstanding the point
[24:28] altogether what this could be if you
[24:30] want to call it an experiment I don't
[24:32] call it an experiment but if you want to
[24:35] call it an experiment what's the purpose
[24:37] of an experiment you're trying to get
[24:39] the results you're trying to figure out
[24:42] if I feed the rats certain things and
[24:45] let him exercise in certain ways and is
[24:48] this going to help prevent disease or
[24:50] are our increases longevity or I mean
[24:54] that's what an experiment would be about
[24:56] and then when you carefully record all
[25:00] the details I fed him this much and I
[25:02] exercised him this much and I kept him
[25:05] away from the other you record all that
[25:07] then you compile the results and so this
[25:10] takes a long period of time
[25:12] however long that the experiment you're
[25:15] still discovering the entire time of the
[25:18] experiment then you write the results
[25:20] down and then you publish them and I
[25:22] said what this is is before the
[25:24] experiment ever begins god knows the
[25:28] results he knew exactly what was going
[25:31] to happen and how it would be in my life
[25:34] he knew my strengths and my weaknesses
[25:38] he knew what I would choose he knew the
[25:41] times listen
[25:43] he knew the times that you and I would
[25:45] choose to listen to the Holy Spirit and
[25:48] he knew the times that we would
[25:52] selfishly stubbornly choose our own way
[25:56] and yet he loved us that's one of the
[25:59] things that I find comforting about
[26:01] these truths he said my days had been
[26:05] shaped before any of them existed I'm
[26:11] gonna read it again cuz I keep
[26:13] interrupting myself with commentary
[26:15] Psalms 139 16 complete Jewish Bible no
[26:20] interruption here goes your eyes could
[26:23] see me as an embryo but in your book all
[26:27] my days were already written my days had
[26:31] been shaped before any of them existed
[26:36] it wasn't that God was creating a life
[26:40] for us and we had no choice
[26:42] it was that God knew our choices he knew
[26:47] what direction we would go in and by
[26:51] what he knew about us especially that
[26:55] moment that we would be presented with
[26:57] the truth of the gospel of salvation
[27:00] through the Grace and blood of Jesus
[27:02] Christ that is the most important thing
[27:06] that God was watching for as our days
[27:09] were being recorded in his books he's
[27:13] watching for that moment that we will
[27:15] hear the truth we have a savior and how
[27:19] we would respond and based on our
[27:23] response he is
[27:26] signs to us an eternal destiny by our
[27:32] choice through his foreknowledge of us
[27:37] the scripture said this gives me comfort
[27:42] because I know that no matter what's
[27:44] happening to me God already saw it
[27:48] before what somebody said well if it
[27:50] wasn't pleasant why don't aren't you
[27:52] upset with God for not stopping it let
[27:55] me tell you something when you and I
[27:58] become secure in God's love for us we
[28:03] can know that whatever happens in our
[28:06] life is for a greater good and it is for
[28:10] a reason I know some people laugh at the
[28:14] simplicity of that truth but it gives us
[28:18] a place of rest that we are not alone
[28:22] hallelujah first of all we're not in an
[28:25] experiment in a mad scientist's
[28:28] laboratory we are children of God
[28:33] created by God here at this very moment
[28:37] in time because God ordained it to be so
[28:41] because as you've heard me say before
[28:43] there's a part of me that was
[28:46] contributed to me by my mother and by my
[28:50] father DNA genetics that determined a
[28:56] lot about Who I am
[28:58] but there my friend is a part of me that
[29:02] you cannot see that neither my mother
[29:05] nor my father had anything to do with at
[29:08] all that is my spirit that which was
[29:13] given to me by Almighty God that breath
[29:17] that came into me as a gift of God and
[29:21] that was determined what portion of that
[29:26] at what time would come into my life was
[29:30] not determined by my parents but it was
[29:32] determined by my loving Heavenly Father
[29:35] and he so knew me everything
[29:39] there is to know about me I tell you
[29:42] there are times that we can be in a
[29:45] crowd of people and be lonely there are
[29:49] times that we can long for a real
[29:52] confidant a real friend that we could
[29:55] tell everything we feel and think
[29:58] without discouraging them without
[30:01] affecting them that that's one of the
[30:04] things that I think about in a
[30:07] friendship and when I when I think I'm
[30:10] gonna just you know dump my sorrow or my
[30:13] troubles on somebody else I often think
[30:16] about oh I miss it sometime but I do
[30:19] think about the fact I don't want to
[30:21] stumble that person I don't want to
[30:24] discourage that person and so we find
[30:27] that many times in life we can't be
[30:30] completely transparent we can't share
[30:33] all of our thoughts and concerns and
[30:36] burdens because we don't want to affect
[30:39] someone negatively and cause them to
[30:41] lose sight or lose hope but there is a
[30:45] friend there is someone that you can
[30:49] pour your heart out to who already knows
[30:52] what you're going to say before you say
[30:54] it that gives me comfort it lets me know
[30:58] that I can say most anything to God in
[31:01] prayer and he is not waiting over the
[31:04] balcony of heaven with a big hammer to
[31:06] to crush my skull if I say the wrong
[31:10] thing he loves me he wants me to cast he
[31:16] in fact he said didn't he cast all your
[31:19] care on me for I care for you even
[31:24] though he already knows he longs for us
[31:27] to come to him pouring out our heart and
[31:30] then looking to him for strength looking
[31:34] to him for comfort for help for
[31:36] provision for courage for whatever we
[31:39] have need of there are people who love
[31:41] us who would listen to whatever we have
[31:45] to say who would give us the best advice
[31:48] that they could possibly offer but at
[31:50] the end of the day
[31:51] they could not provide for us what Jesus
[31:56] can they cannot give us what a
[32:00] relationship with him what intimacy in
[32:04] the word can produce not even a mother's
[32:08] love can do that for us so I'm thankful
[32:11] for the one who clings to me closer than
[32:15] any brother that's the God we serve
[32:19] he knows my ins and outs and ups and
[32:22] downs and yet he loves me the same
[32:26] listen to what Jeremiah said in chapter
[32:31] 1 verses 4 & 5 he it seems that he was
[32:36] describing his own life he said then the
[32:38] word of the Lord came unto me saying
[32:40] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[32:45] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[32:49] the womb I sanctified thee and I
[32:53] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[32:57] now that's the high calling of God on
[33:00] Jeremiah's life this is the word of the
[33:03] Lord
[33:04] prophesied to him before I formed you in
[33:09] the belly I knew you and before you came
[33:13] out of your mother's womb I sanctified
[33:15] thee which means set you apart and
[33:19] ordained you to be a prophet to the
[33:21] nation's he was born a prophet to the
[33:24] nation's because this was the will of
[33:27] God for the life of Jeremiah another
[33:30] scripture that reminds us that he knows
[33:35] that he knows and listened to the
[33:39] revelation that Isaiah had about his
[33:42] life and ministry and I say a chapter 49
[33:45] verses 1 through 5 he said listen Oh
[33:49] Isles unto me and hearken ye people from
[33:54] far the Lord hath called me from my from
[33:58] the womb from the bowels of my mother
[34:02] hath he made mention
[34:04] of my name and he had made my mouth like
[34:09] a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand
[34:12] have he hid me and made me a polished
[34:17] shaft in his quiver hath he hid me and
[34:21] said unto me thou art my servant o
[34:24] Israel in whom I will be glorified then
[34:29] I said I have labored in vain I have
[34:33] spent my straight for naught and in vain
[34:37] yet surely my judgment is with the Lord
[34:40] and my work with my god
[34:43] and now saith the Lord that formed me
[34:47] from the womb to be his servant to bring
[34:51] Jacob again to him though Israel be not
[34:54] gathered yet shall I be glorious in the
[34:58] eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my
[35:03] street that my friend is holy boldness
[35:08] that my brother's sister is confidence
[35:13] knowing that God has placed a calling on
[35:18] your life and he has you may not have
[35:22] the assurance yet that Isaiah had but I
[35:27] have to believe that you and I are
[35:29] together today for a reason for a
[35:32] purpose God wanted to speak to your
[35:36] heart he wanted to remind you that you
[35:40] are not here by accident you are here at
[35:45] an appointed time with an appointment
[35:49] with a purpose God has a plan for your
[35:54] life we were talking about the coming of
[35:58] the Messiah the coming of the Savior how
[36:01] everything had to be in line everything
[36:05] had to be you know sometimes we use the
[36:08] expression all the ducks in a row
[36:11] and it was as though everything had to
[36:14] be an order I think I said before
[36:18] parents had to rise and fall leaders
[36:21] rise and fall kingdoms rise and fall God
[36:25] was getting everything about the earth
[36:29] to the right place economically
[36:33] politically in in every way the
[36:37] religious environment we even find in
[36:41] reading that if the Lord would have come
[36:46] years before he did if Jesus would have
[36:49] been born years before he was that it it
[36:53] would have been very very difficult for
[36:56] the good news of the gospel to spread in
[37:00] to the different empires and nations of
[37:04] the world as it did it took the road
[37:07] system of the Roman Empire it took
[37:11] groundwork of even systems that were
[37:16] evil the works of men who were out to
[37:20] destroy yet God used them tyrants
[37:25] leaders those who came to crush other
[37:29] men and other societies other nations
[37:33] and cultures and yet God used even those
[37:37] men to lay the groundwork to get
[37:41] everything in order
[37:43] he chose the place of his birth so
[37:48] meticulously if I had time I could share
[37:52] some of that with you he he chose every
[37:55] detail who the birth would be announced
[37:57] to what what season it would be in under
[38:02] a decree of taxation who do you think it
[38:05] was that inspired the the leader to call
[38:10] out for a for a census of Taxation
[38:14] maybe Herod maybe other leaders were
[38:18] thinking they're just doing their own
[38:19] will and way but God was in control
[38:24] orchestrating many many details and
[38:27] circumstances to get everything just
[38:29] right because heaven
[38:31] was about to come down on earth
[38:36] sometimes they sing the hymn silent
[38:39] night or oh holy night and I'm sure in
[38:45] in in in that little atmosphere where
[38:49] our Lord was born it was was somewhat
[38:52] quiet but I when I think about it I
[38:56] think of all the animals making their
[38:59] noises and I think about I think about
[39:02] Oh Herod screaming in the in his palace
[39:07] mad you know what the wisemen mad about
[39:10] all the different things that are going
[39:12] on and all the Roman occupation in the
[39:18] land and zealots were rising up and you
[39:21] just go through a little of it in your
[39:23] mind and you think oh my
[39:24] I don't know how quiet it was I'm not
[39:28] really sure how silent it was but it was
[39:31] holy what I love about the story of Luke
[39:36] and when he gives us and the other
[39:38] Gospels that talk about the birth of our
[39:41] Lord what I love about it so much is you
[39:44] know this was God being born in flesh he
[39:49] could have been born in the cleanest
[39:51] most beautifully decorated
[39:54] clinic/hospital room or whatever
[39:57] according to what what period of time he
[40:00] chose to come and be born it could have
[40:04] been in our day if he would have waited
[40:06] until now he could have been born in the
[40:08] Mayo Clinic but he chose the timing and
[40:12] he chose the place and a humble place
[40:17] laid in a manger where animals would be
[40:21] in a little cave or stable as some
[40:26] translated and his birth all my today
[40:32] the BBC CNN Fox News would would
[40:38] announce it to the whole world but in
[40:41] that day no no heavenly
[40:45] creature showed up to and to announce it
[40:48] to Herod or to any other great leader or
[40:53] potentate but out in a field somewhere
[40:56] near Bethlehem some shepherd boys we
[41:01] call them some shepherd men were out
[41:04] watching over sheep taking care of lowly
[41:10] sheep and all of a sudden angels
[41:14] appeared in the night sky and sang of
[41:18] the praises of God glory be to God in
[41:22] the highest and on earth peace goodwill
[41:25] toward men
[41:27] what a salutation what a holy
[41:30] announcement but it didn't take place in
[41:33] the courtrooms or the libraries or in
[41:37] the halls of great learning or in the
[41:41] palace of great leaders it didn't take
[41:46] place in Jerusalem the great city of God
[41:49] or Rome or other beautiful cities
[41:54] Alexandria and other beautiful cities of
[41:56] the day little Bethlehem little shepherd
[42:01] boys this was the plan of God no
[42:06] beautiful christening gown to wrap him
[42:09] in our royal robes just swaddling
[42:12] clothes cloths that had been used to
[42:16] wipe down the sweaty animals that were
[42:19] being sheltered in the cave or in the
[42:22] stable there he was wrapped in those
[42:26] dirty rags the king of all kings the
[42:31] lord of all lords it could have been
[42:33] another way it could have been any
[42:36] number of ways more beautiful more regal
[42:42] more royal it could have been in a
[42:45] different time a different period of
[42:47] history as I said a moment ago it could
[42:50] have been in the 21st century it could
[42:53] have been in the rule of Queen Victoria
[42:59] but God knew exactly when the fullness
[43:01] of the time was and that's when he chose
[43:06] to come and in the manner that he chose
[43:10] to come in again that gives me such
[43:14] great comfort God had it all in that
[43:19] blueprint those thoughts that were in
[43:23] his mind before the foundation of the
[43:26] world he watched he was involved in I
[43:30] don't want you to think he was just an
[43:32] observer he was constantly interacting
[43:35] with mankind throughout the Old
[43:38] Testament but nothing that God did in
[43:42] those four thousand years of covenant
[43:46] period could begin to match that
[43:52] beautiful day when God became man when
[43:59] the Son of God became a son of man so
[44:03] that we the Fallen sons of men can
[44:07] become the sons of God as many as are
[44:11] led by the spirit they are the sons of
[44:13] God we are sons of God born by the
[44:19] spirit and all a part of God's great big
[44:24] design and plan in this story and it
[44:29] goes on his life predetermined his
[44:35] ministry part of God's plan his
[44:39] suffering the accusation the trial the
[44:44] persecution the whipping the crown of
[44:49] thorns the spear in his side every
[44:55] detail already in the mind of God when I
[45:02] look back over this great love story
[45:06] even its resurrection even the borrowed
[45:09] tomb all foretold
[45:13] even the donkey ride into Jerusalem the
[45:17] week before his crucifixion all foretold
[45:20] because it was all a part of God's
[45:23] blueprint for the salvation of mankind
[45:26] when I look over that beautiful story I
[45:29] don't notice one Santa Claus
[45:32] I don't read of any stockings by the
[45:36] chimney no mistletoe no Christmas
[45:40] pudding no tree no flashing lights no
[45:47] Elf on a shelf
[45:48] no fruitcake I could go on and on and on
[45:53] and on and on none of these things that
[45:56] become so important to us at this season
[46:00] of the year were ever mentioned in the
[46:04] most beautiful story that has ever been
[46:06] told so what should our focus be as
[46:10] born-again sons of God our focus should
[46:14] be on the word we've got a lot of story
[46:17] to tell we've got a big story that needs
[46:22] to be told in great detail we've got
[46:26] some scriptures to share with the
[46:28] hopeless we need to let people know
[46:31] before you were ever born all your
[46:34] members all your days were already
[46:36] recorded in the in God's book in his in
[46:40] his thoughts about you there's so much
[46:43] in this word there's so much truth and
[46:47] strength and life and hope and
[46:50] deliverance in the Word of God that we
[46:53] never get to at surface level if we let
[46:57] religion dictate to us the depth of our
[47:00] dig in God's Word will barely scrape the
[47:05] surface but if you will allow the deep
[47:09] Spirit of God to cry out in you to rise
[47:13] up in you and crave and hunger and call
[47:18] out for truth Jesus Yeshua
[47:21] is truth he said I am the way the truth
[47:26] and the life there's so much more to
[47:29] know about him than just the Christmas
[47:32] story or what is called the Easter story
[47:35] he won't he did all of that and it's
[47:39] glorious it's wonderful it's so
[47:42] important and precious but he did all of
[47:45] that because he wanted to get inside of
[47:49] you he wanted to be more than the God
[47:54] you feared the one who dwelt above you
[47:57] and so he came Immanuel God word made
[48:04] flesh in a body a man's body man in body
[48:09] but God in spirit because he wanted to
[48:14] walk with you then he went to the cross
[48:16] died shed his blood buried in a borrowed
[48:20] tomb rose again on the third day
[48:23] conquering death hell in the grave so
[48:26] that you and I might have the
[48:28] inheritance of eternal life leaves the
[48:32] planet saying why are you grieving the
[48:36] angels come why are you grieving this
[48:38] same Jesus that you see leaving is
[48:41] coming in like man or we have that hope
[48:44] and Jesus saying as he's leaving I I
[48:48] will not leave you comfortless I will
[48:51] come to you tarry in Jerusalem until you
[48:54] be endued with power from on high that
[48:57] same spirit that was in the Lord Jesus
[49:00] Christ it's available to you and I by
[49:04] the power of the Holy Spirit which by
[49:07] the way my friend is more than a feeling
[49:09] it's more than a sensation it's more
[49:13] than a demonstration of emotion it's the
[49:17] same resurrection life of Jesus Christ
[49:22] that desires to occupy your body in the
[49:28] same manner that had occupied his body
[49:31] this is the gift the promise
[49:34] that we have his plans were not just
[49:38] about making a beautiful place for you
[49:40] and I to live one day he long for
[49:43] fellowship he long for companionship he
[49:47] longed for a people that would love him
[49:49] with hearts full of passion and longed
[49:52] to be in his presence a people that
[49:56] would log to commune with him and to
[50:00] know him the scriptures reveal this
[50:04] desire that God had to be closer to his
[50:07] sons than anyone can even really imagine
[50:10] in our finite minds in the Old Testament
[50:14] as I have been quoting here earlier in
[50:16] the Old Testament God was above man but
[50:19] he not only wanted to live with them in
[50:22] the New Testament Immanuel God with us
[50:24] but he desired to live in them acts 1:8
[50:28] but she shall receive power after that
[50:31] the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you
[50:33] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[50:39] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[50:43] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[50:48] the earth
[50:51] second Corinthians 6:16 and what
[50:54] agreement hath the temple of God with
[50:57] idols for ye are the Temple of the
[51:00] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[51:05] with them I will dwell in them and walk
[51:10] in them and I will be their God and they
[51:17] shall be my people this is a part of
[51:21] God's ultimate plan being revealed that
[51:24] he would dwell in us and walk in us that
[51:30] he would be our God and that we would be
[51:34] his people are you are you up for that
[51:37] are you willing to surrender to this
[51:41] great plan of salvation John chapter one
[51:45] verses 12 through
[51:48] 14 but as many as received him to them
[51:52] gave he power to become the sons of God
[51:56] even to them that believe on his name
[51:59] which were born not of blood nor of the
[52:03] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[52:07] but of God and the word verse 14 and the
[52:11] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[52:15] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[52:20] the only begotten of the Father full of
[52:22] grace and truth
[52:25] john 14 16 and 17 and i will pray the
[52:31] father and he shall give you another
[52:32] comforter that he may abide with you
[52:36] forever even the Spirit of Truth whom
[52:40] the world cannot receive because it
[52:43] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[52:46] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[52:50] shall be in you that's the promise this
[52:55] is Jesus speaking saying that father he
[53:00] dwells with you how in the body of our
[53:02] Lord but he shall be in you how by the
[53:07] power of the Holy Spirit couple more
[53:11] places Ephesians chapter 2 verses 19
[53:16] through 22 now therefore ye are no more
[53:18] strangers and foreigners but
[53:20] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[53:24] the household of God and are built upon
[53:26] the foundation of the apostles and
[53:29] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[53:32] chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[53:35] building fitly framed together groweth
[53:39] unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom
[53:44] ye also are builded together for an
[53:50] habitation of God through the spirit he
[53:54] wants to dwell in you he wants to live
[54:01] in you so that he can move through you
[54:04] one more first John chapter 4 verse 12
[54:10] and 13 no man has seen God at any time
[54:13] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[54:18] US and his love is perfected in us
[54:23] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[54:27] he in us because he hath given us of his
[54:33] spirit hereby know we that we dwell in
[54:39] him and he in us because he hath given
[54:43] us of his spirit what was that God was
[54:49] making a way to accomplish the plans
[54:53] that he had for us since before the
[54:58] foundation of the world not an
[55:01] afterthought but always a part of the
[55:05] great big plan celebrate that enjoy your
[55:10] family enjoy being together seeing old
[55:15] friends all of that is just wonderful
[55:19] but you've got something to celebrate
[55:22] he's not a baby anymore he's no longer
[55:26] in the manger he's no longer on the
[55:30] cross he's no longer standing in the
[55:34] mouth of an open tomb he's living in the
[55:39] body of believers those who hunger and
[55:44] thirst for righteousness if he is not
[55:47] living in you I won't encourage you to
[55:52] invite him in allow him to work the work
[55:57] that he has desired for your life since
[56:00] before you were born I just would
[56:03] encourage you not to be so caught up in
[56:07] the in the little petty trappings of
[56:11] talking about Jesus being the reason for
[56:14] the
[56:15] season I would encourage you to make him
[56:18] Lord of your life I would encourage you
[56:22] to get him out of the manger and find
[56:25] out where he really wants to be he wants
[56:28] to live in you by his Spirit very soon
[56:32] we're going into a new year on the
[56:35] Gregorian calendar another year of our
[56:38] Lord the year of our Lord 2019 we
[56:43] remember at a time like this there is
[56:45] only one life it will soon be past and
[56:49] it's only what is done for Christ what
[56:54] we do for Christ that will last and that
[56:57] is still the truth so would you be
[57:00] yielded to him as your family and
[57:03] friends gather around you shine like a
[57:07] light bulb shine like the Morning Sun
[57:10] let his love let his light penetrate the
[57:13] darkness you don't have to be
[57:15] politically correct and you don't have
[57:17] to compromise with sin just love as he
