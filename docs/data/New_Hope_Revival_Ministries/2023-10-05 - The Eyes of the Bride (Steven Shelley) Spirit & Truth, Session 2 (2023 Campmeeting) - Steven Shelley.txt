greetings from South Africa from the bride that side to all of you here it's so wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord is that right there was nobody and nothing to worship him he wanted to be God in the beginning he desired to be God but there was no hands no voices no feet to dance and then he created us to make him God Amen and we're not ashamed to make him God tonight he said right I'm not ashamed to shout and jump and dance to make him God I can tell you Christ is not unwelcoming this church he's welcome here we can feel him the person of the Holy Ghost amen I was just reading a scripture there in Greek in Hebrew it means praise it means also to brag on God Amen to break on the Lord and I was just thinking you know if you don't praise God you're not breaking on your God but amen if you know that he's a Healer a redeemer a savior I mean you will praise him you will bragged that he's a Healer how many can break tonight that our God is a deliverer he's a Healer and a redeemer oh blessed be the name of the Lord Brahman says this message is already inspired he says but you need to be inspired and when an inspired man picks up the inspired word there will be results I feel this camp meeting is inspired by God and we know this message of the hour is already inspired and our God is not dead but he is alive amen and we hear Amen to worship him and to honor him I always tell the church guarded to make up his mind when he how he's going to come down from Heaven to Earth and he had to make up his mind he had to decide how will I come down and you know God made and problem says he's the same yesterday today and forever when he did it like this the first time you should do it like that the second time the third time and all the time he said right amen so he made up his mind he will come through the tribe of Judah and Judah means praise he came through praise brother when you don't feel the Lord you just stop praising him wherever you are whatever area in your life if you don't feel the Lord you just start praising him and I'm telling you he's bound to come down amen because he comes through our praises is that right praise the name of the Lord he's born out of the tribe of Judah and the symbol for Judah is a lion so when you praise God there must be a raw in your worship amen the devil must hear the lion roaring you can't worship like a mouse softly amen because your Praises should sound like a lion and when the enemy hears them in your aim and there's a Roar and you Hallelujah there's a law then God knows that's a true worship is that right amen praise the name of the Lord so we're just excited amen I'm overwhelmed I don't be here too long amen I'm just over excited you know 2020 when the pandemic came it was so significant and so prophetic because 20 if you multiply 21 20 it gives you 400 and God in Genesis 15 he said after 400 years I'll take my people out on The Exodus is that wonderful amen after 400 years and on 2020 the pandemic came it was so prophetic problem says God keep on repeating amen hallelujah he's a god added repeat his prophecies he's not just the god of History he repeats his history amen and after 400 years yeah amen came God to get Israel out of the Exodus and it happened after 400 years and how did it happen with the pandemics in year 2020 you can see the when you counted together you get the year 400 you get the number 400 and that means amen the 2020 when that happened amen it was significant because it shows us The Exodus for the bride is on Amen and God told Moses he told Moses this he said Moses I'm going to take my people out I'm going to do wonders but when I studied that word wonders I couldn't understand how God can say I'll take my people out with wonders but when the Wonders came it was actually pandemics it was plagued behind plague plague after plague but how can God says he's going to take them outward wonders you see to the Egyptians it was plagues but to his people it was wonders can somebody shout and say Amen oh brother to the world the pandemic was chaos but for us it was Supernatural wonders because God came on the scene to service the same yesterday today and forever and I'm so excited I told the people amen after 400 years but the redeemed time was exactly 430 years so The Exodus took place after 430 years and Moses he told Abram for after 400 years but in the book of Exodus and the physicals you can read it was after 430 years and what God did in the first Exodus you can study all the Exodus Brahman says it's the same what happened in the first accidents will happen in a second Exodus will happen in the Third Exodus God sent him a prophet in the first Exodus in the second Exodus Jesus was the prophet and in our Exodus God sent William Branham it's our Prophet but I want to show you something there just quickly pass if I can 450 years and it's amazing after the Book of Malachi for 400 years there were no Visions no dreams there was no prophecies it was quiet they call it the silent God for 400 years oh but then the angel Gabriel came amen what the prophecy that the Redeemer will be born but Jesus only functioned after 30 years so if you look into that amen you get the year 430 again after Malachi to the Book of Matthew 400 years of Silence but the angel said that the Messiah will be born and after 30 years he stepped into his levitical hood exactly 430 years again and I tell the people can it be in this Exodus that 2020 is to you you can count at 400 prophetically but if you look at 2020 it's like a countdown to 2030 then you get the number again 430 I'm not making dates we don't know the day and the hour but I just want to pinch you Ramen says pinch yourself the coming of the Lord is close he said there's still great things happening now they said it's running out of time and it's the coming of the Lord and I'm telling you brother he's closer then close can ever be the Lord is coming and may God bless you publishers Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] amen amen I don't want to miss no any nights I want to be here to get everything that God is doing Among Us oh Hallelujah praise the Lord we're going to receive the offering tonight you give us giving unto the Lord for the purposes of the Kingdom might I remind you we have service here tonight of course and then tomorrow night at Seven Friday night at 7 Saturday night at six o'clock Sunday morning at 11 o'clock and then we're going to have a memorial service for sister Royale here on Monday night at six six o'clock we want to come and just remember our sister and we're going to miss her but we're thankful that she's not having to be in a pained body any longer God is faithful he's true he's merciful we love him you brought an offering with you I might remind you that Sunday we are going to receive a special offering on the principle of the mortgage of this building it being the first Sunday of the month for us

we're just thankful for what God has done it is it is him he has done it and we bless him amen Jesse and Stephen were you two brothers in one stand here and one stand here we'll let the people bring their offering and give as giving unto the Lord tonight the blood shall never lose its power reaches to the highest mountain thank you Lord the blood that she [Music] for me wait back on Calvary

[Applause] [Music] you words [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is power you believe that I want you to give the Lord another great hand clap of praise [Applause] thank you so much I want you to turn in your Bibles this evening we are so thankful for the musicians I would love to sing there's a great anointing here or singing but I have a I have a lot of hay on my Fork and one about one hour to get it off so I've got a I've got to move along this evening I hope you'll keep up with me I received an inspiration in the service last night when brother Greely was preaching about uh many wonderful beautiful things but he mentioned just briefly the eyes of the Lord and it stirred my heart and God began to talk to me today about the eyes of the Bride I want to talk about your eyes tonight Song of Solomon or Song of Songs as I like to call it because that's what Solomon called it under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Song of Songs chapter 3 and verse 6 who is this that coming out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant now let's turn to Revelation chapter 19. and we're going to read verse 7 8 and 9. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made her self ready something has transitioned the bride to wife something had to take place to move her from the realm of a spousal engagement to being the wife she had made herself ready and to her was granted she didn't get it on her own find it somewhere pay for it it was given to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God are you with me tonight then I want us to go to Song of Songs chapter 8. I just felt impressed that we remain standing for for the for the rest of this reading verse 5 who is this that cometh up from the Wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raise thee Up Under The Apple Tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath the most vehement flame many Waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned and then finally Song of Songs chapter 7 and verse 4. thy neck is a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fish pools in heshbon by the gate of bath rabim thy nose is as the Tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus father I thank you tonight that we are every one of us here by assignment we didn't just think well we we might go over there and attend a meeting or two but we are here because we felt the inspired call you have placed within each one of us a desire to be here and you have met us already and you have come tonight as we worshiped you as we welcome your presence into this house and now Lord in your name and under your Authority we command every Spirit to Bow yourself to the authority and the sovereignty of Jesus Christ you have no place in this service we pray right now that our minds will be open that our eyes will be Anointed with isaav that we might catch a glimpse of how you are forming our eyes in this hour you spoke to me and said I am forming the eyes of my wife in this hour I am forming the Eyes of My bride in this hour and so Lord talk to us tonight I I know that the people are tired many were up way before the sun today they have worked all day and only had a minute maybe not even a minute to sit down before they came into the house tonight but there are needs Among Us that need to be ministered to there are those streaming this service who need a word from You O Lord so I ask that you anoint the faithful of your people right now that you would talk to us we don't need a sermonette we need a message we need a Clarion call we need a clear voice to talk to us tonight and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said before you're seated I want you to lift up a roar of praise to the Lord again just one more time I want you to Rattle the enemy Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah come on Jesus [Applause] you may be seated most of us here have an understanding already that Jesus loved the church and gave himself for her amen we also know in this house that there is a Remnant found among that church that has been chosen predestinated as his bride to not only be given eternal life but chosen to overcome the spirit of this last age can you say Amen in the message the voice of the sign paragraph 23 brother random said now the type here there is a wonderful type that we sure don't want to miss see tight God was bringing Israel his people out a nation I want you to look at this next phrase a nation out a nation out of a Nation a beautiful type of today that God is calling his bride out of a church we are a church called out of a church we are a bride that has been called out of a church God is calling his bride out of a church Christian bride out of a Christian Church a bride church out of a church which is called in the Bible or it's referred to in the Bible We Know by the word of the Lord that she is not only espoused as a bride to him but the scripture specifically describes her as a Chase virgin do you believe that I want you to stay with me in the foundation second Corinthians 11 and 2 for I am jealous Paul says I am jealous over you not with a carnal jealousy but with a Godly jealousy for it has become my responsibility he's saying for I have espoused you to not to a bishop not to a pope not to a top ten in the message list but I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a you read it for me a chaste virgin to Christ a chaste virgin is one who is not defiled by fornication and uncleanness this is how we're going to do it I'm going to say it and if you believe it you're going to amen it so we can move quick you want to start over a Chase virgin is one look the only way I can get 13 pages in tonight is stay close to my notes and the only way we can flow is I'll do my thing you do your thing if you believe it don't just blindly say Amen but if it strikes your heart you respond we're going to be kind of liturgical has has any of you been in a church where they had a liturgy and you get up and and the the priest or whoever he would read a verse and then the people would have a stanza of response and then one more statement and the people that's how we're going to do it tonight we're going to be very very ecclesiastical in our support I'm going to say it if you believe it you're going to respond a Chase virgin is one who is not defiled by fornication and uncleanness a chaste virgin is one who is espoused to a husband and greatly loved by him a Chase virgin is one who is longing for the wedding day surprises all expressions and tokens of love from the espouse she does not despise or reject any of his love gifts if he offers it she wants it if he hangs it over our head we reach up by faith and take a hold of it we don't want any of it to pass Us by we know that the Omega bride must be like the alpha bride but she comes with a double portion because she has seen her day she has recognized the day that she's living in and the message for that day a chaste virgin is one who Delights to hear as often as possible from her espoused once a week is not enough for her twice a week is not enough for her she constantly desire desires to hear him whisper his love to her day and night is that all right in the message scriptural signs of the time paragraph 42 he said but remember the bride will be a called out separated and different filled Holy Ghost born washed in the blood of the Lamb she'll abstain from everything that's filthy around her husband she is a Chase virgin pure by the word you see what's so powerful about this word is it restores virginity it restores chastity just someone who has already taken a seed from some denominational system out there somebody who's been raped by the church I'm going to talk a little plain now she's been raped by the church and yet she was waiting all the time to get to her husband and when the word comes she sees herself as filthy and unworthy but the word begins to wash her it begins to cleanse her it begins to restore her membrane [Applause] turns her bloody issue backwards he restores her membrane she stands before God in this hour no matter how many spiritual lovers she's had she stands virgin and chaste and pure because he sent A pure word you can never be purified by a mixed word it can be man and God it can't be the message and man it has to be the pure revelation of Jesus Christ amen that's the only thing that can restore us back are you with me are you with me the word and her are the same as a man that his wife becomes one in Union when a man lays with his wife they become one in something holy and sacred how dare you take it how dare you take it before it belongs to you how dare us take something so holy and so sacred for our own pleasure before we have the contract before we have the katuba amen so we have most all of us failed somewhere along the way we have we have failed I I know that you know sometimes the message people can be so hard when a minister is going to take a life they can so scrutinize that woman to make sure that she's a virgin because of an isolated verse because of some comments that brother branna made and I'm for that don't you misunderstand me I'm for that but I would like to know are we going to ask the preacher are we going to ask the preacher are you a virgin how many lovers have you had before you came to Christ is it that you stand behind the holy desk having more than one lover you do it because the word has purified you if you've let it you do it because God has erased your past you have become one with the word why don't we give a sister some Grace some of you are shocked you heard me say it it's a very sad condition I know of some situations where young women promise themselves to young men and and and something happened that that broke the engagement and the pastors would raise up and tell this girl you can never be married again so so rock hard and so solid but what about the boy oh it didn't matter because this message world is so hung you know on the man can and the woman can't and they they get so bogged down in their religion they divide themselves over things that are really not essential and they forget what the word has done for us oh I believe in being pure I believe a man ought to take a pure wife if he's gonna fill this desk don't you misunderstand me but I also know that none of us have the right to throw stones it was not whether or not we remain pure all of our lives that made us virgin it was the pure word of God that set the record straight just a minute Amen brother so some of us were married to Assembly of God and Methodist and Baptist and Pentecostal and you don't think I'm going to be married to somebody and not lay with them do you is that too plain so if I was married to the Methodist you better know I took what they had to give is that too plain and you did two Baptist Pentecostal whatever Brethren whatever Church Amish Bishops or whoever it was if you were joined to them you took their seed you took what they had and then the word came looking for you you didn't find this Prophet you didn't find this message this message found you because God wanted to reverse you're Wandering Way and he wanted to cleanse you he wanted to make you virgin born born again that's what he does that's what the word does the word and her are the same let me just ask are you still with me then let's go back to being liturgical I say it you refrain you come back with a response refrain in that in that context doesn't mean refrain from amending it means as I reply as a refrain you get with me because I want to talk to you in a moment or two about your eyes you can tell a lot about somebody by looking in their eyes I want you to know there's something happening to the bride's eyes in this hour she's having some help from on high some cataract surgery is taking place some reshaping and reforming and remolding is taking place and the healing and a restoration is taking place in the bride's eyes he's going to see clearer now than she has ever seen before she's going to notice and recognize very quickly when the enemy is trying to sell her ability when the enemy is trying to put something on her some lie some untruth some Spirit of disqualification she's going to see that devil she's going to recognize that snake tail [Applause] she may have to do like the Apostle Paul and take that Viper up sling it in the fire and say you can't have my vision you can distract me from the word I need some help the word and her the same as a man and his wife becomes one in Union so does the real genuine Church of God when he becomes in Christ the Bible is punctuated with a every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in The Believer punctuates it isn't that what I was asking you to do because it is the word in him the word has to punctuate the word didn't brother tell us last night we are a word sent from God then you can hear the Living Word of God and not respond in some way first and foremost your faith has to reach out and take a hold of that word but if you can be so bold as to say a so be it and amen you make that word personal in your life [Music] it's not the noise I crave it's a faith refrain it's a response that says that's the truth I'm sticking to it I don't care what anybody else says I'm staying with that word the bride church is much loved by the Lord Jesus Christ as scripture says he rejoices over his people when you're worshiping him and you're rejoicing over his goodness and faithfulness to you if you could see him if you could catch a vision a glimpse I want you to know he is joying over you he is delighting over here he is hovering over you like the song told us tonight what a great privilege and responsibility is ours to be a part of the chosen bride Church the seed does not air with the shut brother random said in paragraph 99 I'm almost done with the quoting but uh but uh not because I don't think it's important I just wanted to lay it as a foundation he said but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things all right that's when the shook starts pulling away from the seed you remember you know as long as the fish sandwiches were being served he didn't have a problem pulling in the crowd as long as brother Branham was seeing visions and Discerning everybody's needs he didn't have a problem filling up the largest auditoriums in the world but then the word began to come a little straighter a little clearer hello Jesus began to talk to his disciples he began to tell them you're going to have to eat my my body you're going to have to eat my flesh and drink my blood and it so stirred some of them that they begin to pull away that shuck will pull away from the seed every time that's just a carrier it's just a protector it's there to protect the seed to bring it to the hour of its maturity you know that to be right but he said the real genuine bride church will bring forth how about you reading it the entire in its and it's for he's the same yesterday today and forever aren't you glad you see this bride church has a responsibility the bride church is intent on being kept pure from idolatry I believe you can do better I'm giving my all I'm waiting on you to give yours the bride church is intent on being kept pure from idolatry there you go that's sounding better that means she's not into Pastor worship [Music] she's not into church worship she's not into brother Branham worship [Music] it's him be a man do you let your pastor be a man if you don't you'll never have a leader the man that God chooses to lead you wherever you worship is going to be a broken vessel you don't hold him to Perfection and infallibility you let him grow some of you have been with me since I was a 21 years old I'm 55 now we've grown together you've given me Grace and I have given you Grace you have not worshiped me and if that Spirit tried to raise its head here God knows how he always knew how to deal with that if you get to lean into heavy on your preacher God knows how to deal with that [Applause] a church like some that I love and some that I know of that go all these years and can't find a replacement for their pastor something is wrong you want a carbon copy and God doesn't have carbon copies you've got to understand that a mighty man may lead you through a season and another mighty man might have to come and take his place to lead you through a season we're talking about pastors now we're not talking about word prophets I caught your thought I'm not making an eighth messenger out of anybody but I'm telling you you don't worship your pastor you don't worship the vision of the church some churches are mission driven and if they're not careful they'll worship the mission field some churches are branham-driven it's all they see they can't even believe that God is going to do something in his bride in the absence of the prophet so they're waiting to see how it's going to be they put more confidence in brother Walker's dream and brother Junie Jackson's dream than they do in the pure word of the message or the hour they take these dreams where it's spoken I'll ride this Trail again and they're hold because brother random is telling the dream they're holding that to some level of infallibility and in their own just like Abraham had an Ishmael [Music] Ishmael was a prophet of Hagar's womb and Abram's loins this right here now I know he gave her a natural seed but it was an idea the very thing that God is in trouble in the first place was an idea that was full of discrepancy anybody with me and so God had to deal with that he had the deal you know it's a good idea but just because it's a good idea doesn't mean it's a god idea I like what brother told us tonight he kept saying if God ever does it one time one way [Applause] if he ever does anything similar to that again he's going to do it just like he did it the first time every time now if you raise brother Branham up to the level of Jesus Christ then no wonder you have to bring him back for a 40-day period of ministry if you make him Jesus no wonder you have to believe he's going to return to finish what he started but it's not a one-man ministry that's going to perfect the bride it's not press play the bride the Bible tells us in Ephesians very clearly how the bride is going to come to her perfection with a five-fold Ministry Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists somebody said you really believe that there are New Testament prophets alive today if there are not you and I are sunk because Paul the first church age messenger said that body will never come to the unity of the faith without the touch of the fifo ministry it's going to be a many membered body with a many membered Ministry you need more than apostles you need prophets too you need evangelists too we need teachers too somebody said where are they don't you worry are clouded over eyes are going to be clearer as we go forward and what we're going to find out is that many times they were among us all the time God had placed them there for such a time as this they didn't even know what their calling was until the word came alive [Applause] you know how that kind of a shoe forgive me do you know how that kind of ministry is birthed it's not birthed by by opportunities to preach you can't put somebody in the fivefold ministry by giving them the pulpit every brother every holy ghost-filled brother in this church ought to be able to take a service if you're the husband of one wife and you pass the other qualifications that the Bible tells us concerning the elders every every brother every Holy Ghost Field brother out not to have to worry myself to death on this is fixing to sound pastoral I'm an evangelist tonight I'm I'm a I'm a guest speaker at this here camp meeting and I'm about to say some kind of pastoral but I want you to hear me and I want you to hear me well there's so many that feel that call but I want you to know it takes more than that call I want to tell you I want to show you how how Ministry is born it's not born by practice although we all need it we need it young ministers especially they need exposure and they need opportunity but that Ministry that that calling especially to the Ascension gifts and what are they again Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists the Bible said that he ascended he gave gifts unto men so we call that the accented gifts he left something he ordained something while he was leaving Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists now you can't train somebody into that brother Branham said they're born there but they may not know it you may have been born to be a pastor but you may not know it are you with me you may have been born with a prophetic gift in your life to to serve the body as a new testament Prophet but you may not know that so how do you get that kind of a Ministry birthed you do it in the prayer Chapel you do it in the altar you do it on the floor here we call it carpet time it's when you get down and bury your nose in the rug that's when we're gonna know you're serious about the call of God on your life amen that's where my Ministry was birthed at the foot of my bed as a boy my Ministry whatever little bit God has given to me it wasn't birthed by opportunity it was birthed by wailing it was birthed by groaning it was birthed by wrestling [Applause] by saying I'm not turning you loose until you set in order what you have sown in my life come on now and that little bride she's about to get some clarity in her vision you're going to see young men you're going to see young men begin to get serious about the word they're not just going to look for an opportunity to speak I said every holy ghost filled brother I ought not as a pastor I ought not to have to worry I ought not to have to always clear my schedule with brother Greeley and him clear his schedule with me to make sure that one of us is here any Holy Ghost Field brother in this church ought to have enough of the word in you that if you're called on you could take a service well what if I didn't preach like you you better not You Preach like you you speak like you there's Grace in this house for those who want to start to do something for the Lord everybody doesn't have a grandmother that'll just give you the pulpit you need an opportunity all right let me tell you what God does he opens doors for those that he puts his trust in he'll open doors we need a five-fold Ministry it's not all hanging in the infallibility of one man now I know brother Brandon was not a new testament Prophet I know that he was more on the order of a word Prophet I know that he was a a voice he was a a spokesman he was a messenger for the seventh angel only one of those in a generation only one of those to a church age are you with me may not always fit the chart you know a man's Ministry might go a little bit beyond it might it might go beyond his death so people get a little worked up when they start checking the numbers and The Messengers that were assigned as the seven Church age Messengers and they find out that one didn't even live in his church age that ought not to be so so horrible for you that ought not to be said let me tell you something especially in an hour like we live today where you don't have to be in a live Ministry there to hear the word of God you can hear the word of God anytime you want to but if you want to come to the Perfection and unity of the faith you're going to need Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to do it am I making that plain enough now if you're going to make brother Branham infallible and you're going to say things like he never made a mistake when he says over and over and over again he did and if you're going to let him misquote a scripture or add two scriptures together and you're going to have to do the same thing because he did because you don't want to Bear some kind of false witness on him and make him look like anything less so you'll get up these preachers will get up and they'll misquote the verse because he did and if you question them they'll say something like well that was God's Vindicated voice so if he said this verse wrong then it must have should have been that way in the first place no wonder they have to say there was no no perfect man like him no perfect messenger like him they have to disqualify Paul [Music] thank you amen somebody said I wonder how the prophet would take to this kind of preaching I want you to know he's waiting on men he's waiting on this hour for men with a backbone to say you have rallied and run yourself crazy around the signpost now it's time to hear the voice and go do what he told us to do the bride has to have that Revival the bride has to move in the ministry that God has given to her [Applause] John the Baptist had to decrease are you still here we've got to be kept pure from all idolatry you can't worship your mama she's human it can't worship your daddy he's human you can't pray to pictures that's icons that's Catholicism that's paganism that's why the Jews have no confidence in Christianity yet because all they see is lighting candles and praying to Halo pictures they'll say things like they'll say things like well you know God loved that man so much that he had his picture made with him I think that's precious to say let me tell you how much you love me he loved me so much that he came down to live in my body you don't get any higher honor than that he loved you so much that he chose to come into you and purify You by his word so if you don't ever have a halo over your head if the pillar of fire don't ever physically hang over your head the prophet said you're more valuable to God than all the angels you carry as his bride more Authority in the Earth because you've got the word in you and if you're still if you've still got some of you in there try to get that squeezed out I'm not saying you're perfect but I'm telling you the the perfect one is in you the perfect one is in me we can't just point people back we've got to let them understand there's something to see out there I'm tired of this pest house so we've got to put away our Dollar Tree no more Pastor worship I hope I'm getting that in there enough the bride church is intent on making sure that there is not an inordinate love of the world found in her because if you love the world the things of the world the things of God they have no place to Lodge in you come on now I told you on Sunday we're going to have to be inconvenienced a little bit for that last move of God you may have to miss some of your Netflix series you may have to miss something from time to time you may have to lay something aside you may have to get up a little earlier so you can get to church on time and you can get a seat I know some of you really like your seat you may lose your seat there's a way to rivety that just get here early enough to claim it then put your little self in it and stay there amen because what I saw last night when that Spirit of Prophecy was stirring in here what I saw was God saying bone going to find its bone God's calling a tribe together he's calling a tribe together may he do it everywhere somebody said you're you talk like this place is special what kind of a pastor doesn't feel like that God has placed him in a special place you know special can mean a lot of things no offense but it can mean you ride on a short bus no offense well ain't he special that's a nice way to say he's ugly but I know you love him you do that to any of the youngins around here and you're going to deal with me because I have found out that when someone when when people are on folk or bride God gives them beautiful broad children we have some of the most beautiful children and young people in this church anywhere in the world somebody said well you're probably just a little bit prejudiced I am not I know when somebody's got a pretty look about them the touch of God beautifies he beautifies the meek with salvation doesn't he hello so we don't want to be found as the bride church with the love of the world in US the bride church is concerned with only pure worship directed toward her bridegroom she's not watching to see what everybody else is doing she doesn't turn around to look to see who's watching her [Music] do we get a little that sometime don't you do that don't you do that I tell you when you get into that pure worship you don't care if you're if your Dunlap is jiggling you know what that is that's that part of you that's done lapped over your belt if you wear your pants big enough like I do mine you won't have that you pull them up like they ought to be pulled up you won't look like these men with their belly hanging down there and their britches down there buy you a bigger pair [Music] you don't care if you're done lap Jiggles a little bit when you get lost in that pure worship it does you're not thinking about your hair you're not thinking about you're just thinking about him the bride Church the bride Church Longs for the return of the bridegroom you you you you get around people long enough I gotta hurry I've totally forgot you you you get around people very long and you'll find out that that talk that you ask them do you believe the Lord's coming yes but they don't live like they believe he's coming they've got a 40-year plan I believe we ought to we ought to plan you know I believe that I believe we ought to have a plan for our future but I don't believe that's what we ought to be called up in we can see we see how suddenly things can change on a Monday a diagnosis came not even two weeks later how many days two two weeks just two weeks at two weeks two weeks later our sister gone from us you have you listen we have no guarantee the real true bride Church she Longs for the return of the bridegroom they don't say these ridiculous things like I want the Lord to come but I will want to be married first I want the Lord to come but I want to have babies first let me tell you something you get the bridegroom in your vision and you'll understand that if you'll let him he will be everything to you he fulfills the longing of your soul he fulfills the deepest desire of your inner spirit just see him look to him find him the bride Church secures her own wedding garment we read it and make sure it's up to you to make sure it stays clean it's up to you to make sure it stays spotless are you with me as for the song of songs there's much controversy that surrounds that book and yet it was added to the Bible under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost simply put it as a song of love between King Solomon and the shulamite shepherdists 33 times in the song we find the word beloved in reference to our beloved in reference to the bride and her soon-to-be groomed 28 times it is the shulamite girl calling Solomon her beloved in Song of Songs 216 my beloved is mine and I am his he feedeth among the lilies in song of Psalm 6 3 I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies but we know it's much more than just a love song between King Solomon and the shulamite shepherdists it's a picture of our Heavenly bridegroom pursuing his bride and it opens up a Wellspring of understanding to us while there are some graphic words some analogies that some may not understand it serves to give us great spiritual truth concerning our bridegroom's passionate love for us I'm I am impressed to focus this evening for the little bit of time I have left on one analogy that will give us a real pause if we choose to pursue it I want to talk about her eyes the most important organ for finding out about the world around us is the eye it is used to gain knowledge appreciate Beauty recognize the Bad and the Ugly the Bible connects the eye with our emotions Lamentations 351 the eye affects the heart Deuteronomy 7 16 the eyes can pity job 16 20 the eyes pour out tears of compassion Psalm 31 9 the eyes can be consumed with grief Psalm 88 9 the eye Mourns Genesis 3 6 something can be pleasant and bring pleasure to the eye song of Solomon's 4 9 ravish the heart she ravish the heart of her bridegroom with her eyes song of song 6 5 your eyes have overcome me the beauty of an eye can overcome the bridegroom the Bible also connects are you with me the Bible also connects the eye with Revelation Psalm 119 18 open my eyes to behold your law Ephesians 1 17 18 the eyes of my understanding Psalm 32 8 guide me with your eye Genesis 21 19 God opened Hagar's eyes numbers 10 31 be to us instead of eyes second king 6 17 God opened the servant's Eyes First Corinthians 13 12 now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face so all through the scripture the Bible corresponds the eye with human emotion and all through the scripture the Bible connects the eye the human eye perhaps the spiritual human eye with revelation there are expressions that we use that concern the eye and I'm going to go over them real quickly with you that caught my eye what does that mean it means it attracted your attention feasted my eyes upon it means you looked at looked at something with pleasure and admiration gave him the eye that was my mama she always gave me the eye that means to look at to warn or with admiration he has an eye for that it means have the ability to notice with discernment and appreciation sometimes we say in the public eye that means well known or brought to public attention keep an eye on that it means look after or watch carefully keep your eyes open means be on the lookout Be watchful lay eyes on that means to look at and I laid my eyes on such a it means you looked at it right make eyes have you ever heard somebody say she made eyes at me would you do that if you're not my wife because that means flirt to look at lovingly and and some people will respond to to something they'll say my ah somebody look at me like you've never heard anybody say that before the Lord of Mercy I when I was in school they'd walk up to you pull their eyes say eyeball what's that eyeball my eye it means exclamation of contradiction or astonishment so there's a lot about our eyes would you agree we got to hurry that opened his eyes that means it made him aware of facts and real reasons see eye to eye that means whole precisely the same view see with half an eye that means to see or understand something easily because it's so evident shut his eyes to it means unwilling to see or to think about so obviously when Solomon declares that he was struck by the eyes of this young woman he wants to marry he's speaking figuratively are you with me the first thing he says about her eyes is she has Dove eyes did you hear the song about the dove Song of Songs 4 1. don't you leave me yet I'm not running a part two I'm gonna finish this tonight song of Psalms 4 1 behold Thou Art Fair my love behold Thou Art Fair thou Hast doves eyes within thy locks the Bible tells us in Matthew 6 22 the light of the body is the eye and if therefore the eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness How great is the darkness did you know that when a dove fixes its gaze upon its mate it is never distracted by any activity around it I said when a dove fixes his or her eye on its mate it doesn't matter what's happening around them they lock eyes in such a profound way that sometimes people refer to that a dove as being a lovebird are having this Dove's eye as the bride of Christ indicates that we're becoming increasingly I've got to slow down it means that we are becoming increasingly aware of the Lord's person and his presence and that we possess a spiritual awareness that will lift us above the pools of the Earthly for a few moments last night as the service come to an end the spirit of God was still drawing in this place I knew he was drawing and I refused to let anybody take it into into Warfare or into any kind of violent intercession that is not where we were there's a time to war in the spirit there's a time to to uh to intercede with aggression in the spirit and then there's a time to recognize that the dove is over he's just hovering somebody said well I don't know what to do in times like that you don't have to do anything you don't have to do anything we make a great mistake we make I want to teach you something we make a great mistake when we think we've got to fill in the void there's never a void when the dove is hovering over our head we could sit and look each other in silence you know that's what lovebirds do we could just sit and look at one another here in silence as long as the dove is cooing over us we don't have to scream we don't have to be loud we don't have to pound the desk we don't have to beat a drum we don't have to wave a flag we don't have to shake a tambourine there's a time to do all of that you know as a pastor here you know that I believe that the people should have Liberty to worship God every time the enemy raises his ugly head to try to dictate in this house what worship will be like God has allowed us to beat him back you're not going to tell us we can't run jump or dance or shout or speak in tongues or twirl or wave a flag or throw a handkerchief every time the enemy has come through the years and tried to say you'll be more accepted hide the worshipers in the back so no streamer sees them if I was ashamed of the worship here we would have done something about it a long time ago I just wanted a place when my grandmother was leaving this world and God gave her the vision and took her out the spokes of a wheel out into the tragedies of the world she started in the hub The Hub was the anointing the spirit of God carried her out the various spokes of the wheel she saw disease and famine she saw World disaster she saw homosexuality and perversion she saw so many things just when she would feel like I can't I can't survive under the weight of how ugly it looks the spirit of God would pull her back down the spoke of the wheel and and an anchor Shah oh no and anchor her in the Hub in the anointing she told me that Vision the day of the day she died the morning the morning that she died either the morning she died or the morning before she died it was one of the last spiritual things that she said to me she said Steve you won't believe you won't believe it don't matter how black it gets out there it don't matter how filthy it looks if you'll always let him bring you back like he was doing me she said he brought me back she said it was like I was sliding back to the hub and the anointing just draped me and embraced me and wrapped its arms around me and all of a sudden are you with me and all of a sudden everything was all right uh uh jaw brother Josh antis come in and make it a little warmer those people are very very cold I'm very hot but it doesn't matter I I I'm sweaty but I I don't want nobody to get to catch a cold because you can't stay out laughs you can't have a sore throat and lay out this is you you don't want to miss this somebody didn't hear the message Sunday he said I'm going to give you the Moab I'm going to give you a Divine appointment I'm going to do something for you this week he didn't tell he didn't tell us what preacher he was going to use because he'll use us all if we'll yield to him he didn't tell us what service was going to be the best because they'll all be the best if we get everything out of them we can get I'm going to do it brother I'm gonna do it sister I'm gonna get everything I can get you've got to know when the spirit is calling and wooing and you've got to know what he releases you to stay one more to linger one moment longer than the spirit is wooing you is a waste of your good energy I lost friends one time at a camp meeting down the hill there under that Tabernacle because that long after the service was over there was a bunch of people from some of them from New Brunswick and from other places a big majority of them now dead a big majority of them gone and some left at very young ages but there were some of them who had come and they begin to try to to extend what God was it wasn't that he that he did want to help us it's that he has a time and a season for everything and boy I lay I begin to leave I began to get and all of a sudden the spirit of God just kind of picked me up and I ran like a wild man under that under that Tabernacle and I would go home I began to scream go home go home go back to your hotels go back get out I lost friends people didn't understand I stayed up half the night in a hotel parking lot by Cracker Barrel trying to explain to carnal-minded people how that God has an appointment and he has a season and there's a time to beat the floor and War and fight and push and there's a time to soak and there's a time to to respond to the call but you see our religious mentality things if I just pray five more minutes won't do your liquor good when the spirit is through with the assignment so don't get your feelings hurt when the when he's through calling I'm going to the house wouldn't be any need we're go but don't you worry somebody said well I ain't gonna know the difference you will you will because something because something's happening God is reforming our eyes he's reforming our eyes they'll they'll come along now say the only way to have a move of God is to tarry all night you can tarry all night and be no closer to him the next morning if God hasn't set an appointment with you you got to understand the times and seasons of the Lord I believe in fasting I believe fasting is a key for a lot of people in a lot of situations I believe fasting is one of the only things sometimes that can bust something open but I don't believe in fasting because you got an idea I believe listen if you're going to really fast you need to know God is wooing you he's calling you into time somebody said why would you say something like that because we were once on a 21 day Daniel Fast here and some just joined in because others were joining in and I'm telling you it turned loose mental sickness mental illness it turned loose all kinds of things in the house because it's just like Abraham and and Hagar God gave him a son but it was a product of Hagar's womb and his loins I know there are people who believe I know there are some of you who believe we need to be doing this and we need to be doing that and we need to be doing the other let me tell you what we need to be doing we need to be letting the Lord reform our eyes I'm telling you what worked in laodicea will not work where we're going [Applause] what worked in the church ages it won't work where we're going there is an exodus there is an exodus oh my do I have some more time thank you thank you I need a little more sorry I may not speak to you again I don't know how the Lord is going to lead I know God sent his servant from South Africa he's starting tomorrow night we're going to see how Night by Night how the Lord leads this may be my only chance to get my spirit free I got to get all this stuff off of my Fork because I'm not going to quit working because I'm not the one standing here I'm going to work for him and I'm going to work for brother Greeley and I'm going to work for you just as hard whether I'm standing here or not I want the shoe I feel something I think I'm by myself but I feel something I want every service to be what God wants it to be I don't care what it looks like I don't care critics say I don't care what the fans say I'm not moved by my fans I'm not moved by my credit I moved by the Holy Spirit we must be moved by the Holy Ghost [Applause] you'll never get to where God has called you to get if you get stuck in thinking that you've got to run your house your church like everybody else's Church now this the last thing brother Austin I'll just my grandmother said to me after that experience she said honey I want you to come home I want you to come home and I want you to take the church and I said granny big mama she looked Mighty tiny laying in that bed she had been my big mama all my life I said big mama God's already talking to my heart don't say no more I'm ready to come when he releases me to come I was in South Carolina at the time and she said I want you to promise me one thing she said it's not going to be easy they are going to fight you tooth and toenail and you will be tempted to leave to throw in the towel and leave because some of them that has been faithful with me will not be faithful with you she said some of them are so mad they could spit a 10 penny nail because I recognize that I wasn't called and they'll blame you remember my grandmother all those years of ministry she heard I said but big mama if he is that Elijah If he if that Spirit of power of Elijah is on him we'll have to do what he said to be right won't we yes ma'am I said but big mama the Bible said that a woman is not supposed to to handle the word of God and usurp authority over a man in that way and she said oh I never thought of it quite like that I'll never do it again you saw it you've read the testimony and so I said I will come in God's perfect timing she said I want you to promise me one thing I want you to have a church it don't have to look anything like the church that I started because I was doing God of service you're going to be in his will I want you to build a church where uh somebody can call the name of brother Branham and never be afraid that somebody is going to get their little feelings hurt and so they won't tell the whole story because they're afraid of driving somebody off or running I want you to have a church where you can call brother branham's name and give testimony and and and and let him be what God called him to be without without embarrassment Or Without Shame and I want you to have a church where people can worship God according to the dictates of their heart and nobody is going to tell them how to worship God he said as long of course as it's decent and in order she said some people may hold their hands like this some may hold them like that some may only dance when the spirit of God moves on them some may dance as a sacrifice of prayer they may just dance because they're happy but my desire for this church you don't have to make it like I had it you'll be led by the spirit but these two things I want you to do be free to call brother branham's name and let the people be free to worship God pure worship undictated we're not doing it to be seen anybody with me Dove's eyes single eye I guess I'll have to stop I don't know what I'll do because I'm not done having this Dove's eye indicates that we are becoming increasingly aware of the Lord's person and presence and that we possess a spiritual awareness that will lift us above the pulls of the Earth the single eye the single eye will enable us to become sensitive to the Lord's presence and obedience to his desires and purposes you can't call someone else into your experience I see inner sisters trying to do that sometimes you think because you've got a burden that everybody is supposed to have a burden that's not right that's subtle manipulation and it borders on witchcraft you don't model your intercession after somebody else you don't model your worship after somebody else you may be weeping but don't try to make somebody else weep I don't even know why I'm preaching the way I'm preaching now but I know it looks like I know it looks like I know we think it ought to be that we all do the same thing all the time I know that's what we think Unity is but Unity is when everybody Mary what are we gonna do we've run out of wine what are we going to do she said well honey child I don't know what to do it's not my wedding Feast I'm a guest here I tell you what whatever he tells you to do you gonna stay with me you you are or you're not getting no soup and sandwich ain't no to go plates except for seniors I don't know what I don't know what to tell you to do or out of wine yeah that's right right away but I believe this will work you go find him and whatever he tells you to do if you're around this Altar and he tells you to jump I hope you look like a kangaroo but you better jump we had a prophetic guy come here one time and he he didn't understand our jumping and he kind of made a little bit of fun he did you know he did he made a little fun called it a kangaroo anointed I don't care what you call the anointing that's on me that's your business you better be careful but that is totally up to you but if if he tells me to jump the only way for me to get wine is by jumping you may be standing right beside me and he may tell you to weep you may feel your heart breaking and you may need wine and you may only get wine you may not get wine jumping because I jump but if he breaks your heart and you begin to weep that's the way you'll get your wine he may tell somebody to walk about Zion he may not tell us all to walk about Zion but if he tells you to walk about Zion he yeah you don't have to go bring somebody else to walk with you you can't I don't I'm not trying to address those of you that have you know tried to encourage people in I understand that all together but I want you to know they can do what you do and may not get the wine the only way for us to have that wine is to do what he tells us to do and if you're worried that you're not going to know don't worry don't worry [Music] he's given us Dove's eyes single eyes we're going to learn how to lock our eyes on the bridegroom and it ain't going to matter who's having an earthquake around us somebody may be over there in the corner and they may be having a typhoon Revival they may be spinning like a tornado but you may just be standing there spiritually with your eyes locked on him and if your eyes are locked on your Dove's eyes are locked on the bridegroom you lay there right there stay right there keep your focus single eye will enable us to be sensitive the Lord's favor rests upon those who have cultivated a single eye toward him these can be easily led by him for they are close enough to see which way his eye is looking now a few few weeks ago somebody came to me and they said someone told me that they had an assignment to stand in a particular place and I don't believe in that well let me tell you something it's not your assignment God don't have to explain to you oh I don't know if that's Bible or not let me show you how how much Bible it is what about him Lord what about him Lord what about John how come how come you let him do like that Jesus said if I would that he tarry till I come which means if I decide that he does not taste natural death what business what is it to you do you know one of these days John may walk in if I would that he tarry till I come [Music] he he might be somewhere in a cave like the mataraji he may be hiding somewhere it might have only been spiritual it might have been natural I don't know which it was so don't you try to throw another Stone but he just said if I wanted him to be alive when I get back what is it to you follow me isn't that what he said follow me if you don't understand something if you'll let me as your pastor I'm not supposed to be ministering as a pastor tonight I am if you let me I'll try to teach you what I know you think you know it all I don't know at all but I will tell you this I have learned a thing or two and I didn't learn it in the seminar and I didn't learn it in the conference and I didn't learn it with a set of CDs I learned it with carpet time you see prayer is not what I do prayer is who I am and you're going to learn as a part of that bride that prayer is who you are because your eye Focus your eyes are about to be transformed a bit oh me Psalm 32 8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go I will guide thee with mine eye oh yes yes yes yes yes yes Philippians 2 14 15 talks about being humble and harmless and Matthew 10 16 why is the serpents and harmless as Dove we've got to learn some things by the spirit and I was going to read a quote there from God making his promise read it at home paragraph 34 flash it up just flash it up I don't have time just I'll just read the I'll just read the yellow there's nothing like the dove the dove is a lover the dove who's in the evening there's nothing more beautiful than to hear the dove in the evening cooing the turtle dove let him cook let him cook let him go over here turn off the idiot box [Applause] and let the dove cool over you it's not just for women to be lovers it's not just for women to lay at the feet of Jesus it's not just for women to want to know his heartbeat it's not just for women to put their head on his chest so they can hear his heartbeat John was our example [Applause] ever you wanna say it you sit at the back door if you want to you sit on the back row if you want to go but John said you don't have to like me you have to lock it you don't have to like my position I'm not sitting there for you I want to be as close to him what the prophet say about this desk right here that's the closest you can get John said I I know they're going to call me I know what they're going to say I know they're going to say I want the attention I know they're going to say I think I'm better than they are but I cannot afford for his heart to beat and me not know what is beating to God is a lover God is love God wants you to come down last part of that paragraph God wants you to come down God wants to come down and make love to you someone said oh you're missing it there is no sensation in this world there is no sensation in this world there is nothing in this life there is no feeling in this life that can compare to win God Almighty by the Holy Ghost comes and makes love over the promise of his word in you come on now for the Venom City Woos and he coos he's trying to get some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law I can just hear him preacher announce I'm getting married is she a virgin are you law law everybody law I know because I was a part of it I know what it means to be legal when the very thing you preach against is the thing that God hangs on your face you'll understand how to humble yourself a little bit oh they've tried they put they post comments on pictures sometime they send me inboxes they tell me how good-looking I was well I wasn't never good looking but they tell me how good-looking I was before these whiskers sister Vaughn grab my beard when I was out there in in Tucson and he shook and he said she you look so much better with that without that thing let me tell you something if I was doing it to look good it'd be a totally different situation I did it because she called me told me first I'm going to make you a gazing stock and then he called me to do it for a purpose purpose not yet all revealed I'm gonna do what he said I have to do what he said if it means backpedaling he didn't tell you to do it necessarily you don't do it because I do it you don't have to do what I do you don't have to wear a vest because I wear a vest I wear one to help cover up my belly you don't have to wear one because I wear one you don't have to have a bolo tie because brother random did you don't have to wear cowboy boots because he did go find out what he tells you to do do it do it do it do it not a law but love and then I wanted to preach on the apple of the eye but I don't have time I'll I'll be back I'll be back sometime Sunday week if no sooner than that I want to get to the I want to talk a little bit about that Apple of the eye I want to show you that in Hebrew most of you have heard it before and you know what it means if the Lord says you know you touch the apple of my eye that's that little image it's that little little image that that appears in the pupil of what somebody's looking at did you know if you get close enough to somebody you can look at their pupil and see yourself that word in Hebrew that's exactly what it means it means the little man in the pupil of the eye in your case it might be a little woman in the people of the eye haven't we told you over and over again you become what you gaze at what you look at you become like don't you know God set us free some years ago and said you're still looking at the mirror of the law you're still seeing your shortcomings because you're looking at the law and you're not even supposed to be seeing your your blemish you're supposed to be seeing my image in the mirror not your image your image in the mirror can't change you your image is the Ugly Truth when you see the wrinkles they're there they're really there it's not a trick mirror I'm closing it's not a trick mirror we're no later than we were last night yet it's not a trick mirror it's telling you what you really look like and if you think it's going to help you to know believe me you hit double Grace 55 and I don't always need to know what I look like because sometimes there's not a whole lot you can do about it the one thing I know is I'm not going to diminish a wrinkle or turn one gray hair back to Brown by looking in the mirror you're not going to have power to change your life to set yourself free to deliver yourself to be more like him by looking at how how what reality says about your image but if you look at his image if you'll see the statue of the perfect man in the mirror if you'll see the perfect reflection of the perfect word looking back at you if when you look in the mirror you see Jesus instead of yourself you've got something to to pull up to you've got something to to reach a hold of he's the man in the mirror if you're still the man in your mirror you're going to miss this thing and how do you become the apple of his eye he's got to be looking at you and he said if they touch you they have touched the apple of my eye let me tell you what God's saying there he's saying they didn't put they're not put let me tell you something they take you apart they're touching the apple of his eye they didn't put you in God's eye he chose what to look at he chose you I'll finish this another time he chose you he'll look at you if he wants to don't matter what anybody else says if he's looking at you and you're the little man in his eye if you're the little reflection in his eye don't matter what anybody else thinks about you when they touch you they're touching him [Music] when they're condemning you they're condemning him when they're judging you they're judging him hello hello hello hello hello hello and then I'll come back and talk to you about those fish pools in heshban I spent all day today in those fish pools let me give you just this this little touch yes Lord speak we're hearing you hello thy thine eyes are like the fish pools of heshban he made an out an analogy the bride's eyes are like the fish pools of heshban you begin to do a little research don't let me do it for you then you go check me out and where are they located those fish pools in heshbon were located in the in the geographical location of the tribe of Reuben our brother was talking tonight about the tribe of Judah that's such a powerful tribe but Reuben was the firstborn of Leia and the word she cried out when when Reuben arrived she didn't say ain't everything going good she said the Lord has seen my affliction she was trapped in a painful life she knew she wasn't the first love she knew she had become a baby Factory for somebody that didn't love her like he loved the other wife even a brand new baby couldn't bring her the joy that it would bring somebody else and she cries out at the birth of Reuben the Lord has seen my affliction so Solomon is telling us if we go through the detailing we will I want to I want to share that with you we find out that Solomon is telling us that our eyes the bride's eyes are being formed by her afflictions it's it's not her joys that fixes her focus on him oh no we're swimming in the fish ponds of heshbon we're over there in the land of Reuben where our Affliction is what we see sometime you know there's some mamas that have had some babies that couldn't have the joy that other mamas had because they were born into homes where there was no peace somebody ought to think about what they're doing I know you'll be mad at me I've actually told a few people why don't you just quit having babies by someone who doesn't love you and treat you right somebody said brother Shelley that's not your decision no somebody said brother Shirley that that's not her decision wait just a minute you think a woman is nothing but a baby Factor you can take this out of the tape you think a woman's nothing but a baby Factory you think a woman in her right mind is going to keep having babies to be raised by an atheist there are some women that have had to bring some babies into this world in in hard times in Affliction everybody didn't have the joy that some of us had when we looked sometime we see this beautiful gift from God and sometimes the mama looks and she says it's just going to be so hard to raise him in the environment of our home nonetheless the Lord opens and shuts the womb and the Lord gives and takes away blessed be his name are you following me here so don't don't make a Doctrine where I didn't make one I'm just being very very honest I'm being very very honest here and there does come a time that we have to make a decision and realize that it's it's not necessarily our job to do it all right let somebody else do a little replenishing because we need to be able to spiritually emotionally and financially provide for the little lives that we bring into the world or else it's not going to be a joy for every Mama some mama's going to wonder how we're going to have enough how we're going to pay the dentist how how are we going to buy the milk how are we going to fix it come on the bride's eyes are not being formed by the joy they're not being focused and reshaped by by the pleasure they're being reshaped by the affliction somebody's been spending time in the fish ponds of heshbon and they're going to come out with a focus like never before [Music] they're going to see their bridegroom like they've never seen him before God is not going to let you suffer here and then rob you of the reward he may choose as he did for my royal jelly I spent time yesterday reading my files from Sister Weems and from Royal for years after she came here she signed every card wrote every card to my big brother older than me she was but she was calling me her big brother and as soon as I gave her that nickname royal jelly she signed them royal jelly I I had some royal jelly one time and it changed my life it's powerful stuff and I said to her you're powerful you're healing like royal jelly when you think about her life don't pity her now if you had any sympathy I hope you showed it to her when she drug her foot to get in God's house but you don't have to feel sorry for her now she's no longer swimming in the fish pond of heshbon [Applause] she'd no longer swims in the murky Waters of suffering and affliction she has the reward I wanted her to have it here but God didn't consult me he didn't ask me he didn't bother to give me a voice he said I'm going to give her the reward of her of her time in the in the Affliction I'm going to get but I'm going to do it over here and you know what I heard the Lord say because I know her story my files tell her story I know her story I know what she went through I know that every smile cost her a big price it didn't come easy it came with a price I read a letter from her accuser you may think that nobody ever had an unkind word to say to her but I want you to know I have the letters and she was called just about anything you'd want to call somebody probably shed some tears over the names that she was called but she learned Affliction is for a purpose sufferings for a reason everything gets to go in good you may forget where you come from you may forget the God who who helped you the way you may forget the goodness of God you may forget you may forget musicians are coming Jacob wrestled with the Lord God dislocated his hip the Jews today will not eat a piece of meat that is not cut by a kosher butcher because they refused to eat the hollow of his hip they won't eat they're careful even with the loin of a loin of beef because they don't want to eat a piece of meat that may have rubbed up against the hip of the cow because they remember that Jacob had a Revival had a Revival he had a meeting with god oh I tell you what I wish some of us would have a Revival like Jacob had you get up from that kind of a Revival wrestling with the angel of the lord your hip dislocated by the angel of the Lord and you know what it never did get right he was never the same God changed him he spent some time down there in Reuben affliction never walked right after we can spiritualize that all day long it was it was a spiritual transformation it was a limp to remind him of his meeting with God sometimes God just leaves enough of the scar to always remind us what it's like to meet him I'm refraining there's so much more I'd like to say right here but it gets a little too personal may God encounter us this week may he grab a hold of us and we grab a hold of him may it not just be that that he's our beloved but may we recognize I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine my my wedding ring costs 3.33 for ten it's all I've needed I might have another one one day but if this one has kept me married I'm closing I never never had to take it off to hide the fact I was married in fact the only reason why I ever put it on in the first place is because I was doing some preaching and speaking among non-message people and the and the old divorced women kept hitting on me I know you can't imagine that I mean I know it grosses you out and I was in at the Ramon crater in Jerusalem and a young beautiful prostitute come up to me and she asked me if I wanted a date and I said lady I'm married she said well you didn't have on a wedding ring and I thought to myself I bet the next time you see me I'll have one on so I went down to a little Arab shop and I was able to get uh I I just can't I'm going to Israel the last of this month for a few days God willing and I I was just reminiscing the other night with the family sitting around I wonder what my Arab friends be there I've not been in 11 years almost 12. crazy how time flies I wonder will my well my Falafel man still be in the same spot you know you start having these thoughts and it says on here my beloved is mine in Hebrew and I'm his I want you to have that revelation you think he's beautiful how many of you think the Lord's beautiful let me tell you something folks he thinks that you are all together lovely he thinks you're the most beautiful thing he's ever seen in his his whole existence my beloved is mine sometimes I say You're Beautiful Jesus and and a man a big Macho bulky man big you know bow-legged man that really thought he was you know on a testosterone High he said to me don't you feel when you're saying Beautiful Jesus I said no I don't and the only reason why you do is you've never seen him because if you ever get a glimpse [Music] if you ever get a glimpse you'll think that's the most beautiful he's the most beautiful there's nobody that can compare there's nothing that compares to the beauty of the Lord and every time I tell him that do you know he longs to tell me I don't see your Dunlap I don't see a wrinkle you're beautiful to me how could he say that because it's his Beauty it's his beauty that makes you beautiful let's stand 9 42 yeah I went longer Joshua you were right I did part two will follow eventually I uh I I spent all day with him and uh well there's just nobody better he he's the best company I love my wife I love my children I love my family I'd rather be with my family than anything I can think of I love to eat with them I I even like it sometime when they bicker but my wife don't makes her nervous it only makes me nervous when they raise their voices but sometimes when they're just going at one another all in love because how do you know because it always ends okay the next day sometime but it's always okay and sometimes I just sit right in the middle then I think I'm the most blessed man Lord Jesus when I came to pastor this church I didn't think I would ever have a wife I told you that we're here in the beginning I let me love your children because I don't know if I'll ever have any children of my own so I loved the ones we had and God gave me a wife to love me and for children to love me and me to love and I love being with them even when they pick the peas out of the rice but I'd rather spend time in his presence with him Whispering on my shoulder than anything I can think of and I was sitting in the recliner today by myself going over this putting this together for tonight and I saw an open vision and what I saw before me I knew exactly what it was it was the image of the broken pieces of a kaleidoscope if you've ever picked a kaleidoscope oven and looked in it you see those little fractals those little broken pieces of glass that look chaotic it looks like just a mess but I saw open eye those little fractiles just lay it you know just laying in a little pile I didn't physically pick up my hand but I saw I saw the picture as it got clearer and clearer and clearer and every little piece of glass went to his piece of glass every little design every color found its color and the next thing I know it had been focused what do you call it I don't know focused enough that a beautiful picture was there and the Lord said it was there all the time he said now that's what I'm going to do for my bride I'm going to reform her eyes I'm going to reshape her eyes I'm not going to let her afflictions be wasted I'm not going to let her trials like God talk to you about your loneliness last night I'm not going to let her loneliness be wasted I am reforming I am reshaping I am remolding her eyes I'm going to give her a clearer vision I'm going to let her see more clearly than she's ever seen before what has looked like chaos to her what has looked like confusion to her what has looked like a mess to her is going to begin to find a clearer pattern and a and a picture is going to be made clear foreign Lord focus our eyes we don't want to waste we don't want to waste not one trial not one heartache what you're going hear me what you're going through right now is not in vain this long year

difficult times it's hard leaving your loved ones it's hard leaving your family behind it's hard leaving your friends behind coming to a new place and I don't I don't I can't help it that God chose to send you to such a strange place as this but I know that it's not all been easy for you but I want you to know the same promise as yours you're a part of this body now it is not in vain you're squeezing your difficulty your Clash it is not in vain God is surely doing the same thing for you that he's doing he's using the years of your Affliction he's using the things that you have been through to refocus he's good would you raise up your hands and ask him to transform your vision to give you Dove eyes to give you single vision to give your eyes like the Deep fish ponds of heshban in
