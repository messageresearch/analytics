[0:00] he's the perfect man he's the man in my
[0:03] mirror because I've chosen to let him
[0:05] live there you can see whatever you
[0:16] choose to see in the mirror it's up to
[0:18] you you can see what manner of man you
[0:22] were or you can see what manner of man
[0:25] you are
[0:25] and if you see what manner of man you
[0:29] are you won't see the smudge you won't
[0:32] see the pimple you won't see the crooked
[0:35] nose huh you won't see the cross die if
[0:40] you choose to see who you are instead of
[0:43] the old man you were you'll see Jesus
[0:46] Christ he's there in the mirror the
[0:48] Bible said so he's there in the mirror
[0:51] looking back at you well praise the Lord
[0:56] it's Jesus that I see you know why it's
[1:00] Jesus that I see because I'm choosing to
[1:03] see Jesus he's always there but I don't
[1:08] always see him because sometimes I'm too
[1:11] busy looking at my flaw to see his
[1:14] beauty he's the perfect man he's the man
[1:17] in my mirror because I've chosen to let
[1:20] him live there I can take the same
[1:23] scripture and look in and see all of my
[1:29] junk some people read the Bible and they
[1:33] feel so judged and condemned and they
[1:37] have so much to say about the antiquated
[1:40] nature of the scripture
[1:42] come on cuz they're looking at the wrong
[1:45] mirror they're looking at the wrong
[1:46] thing but as a believer I choose to look
[1:49] at the same scripture and see Jesus
[1:52] looking back at me that'll help you in
[1:55] 2020 you get the smudges off your window
[1:58] and wipe your mirror every now and then
[2:00] and realize that every one of us are
[2:03] flawed by nature of the flesh by nature
[2:06] of the soul but the Spirit of Almighty
[2:09] God his work he's working you could have
[2:13] been made perfect by the new birth and
[2:15] potentially you are but he left you with
[2:18] a battle of the soul and the flesh
[2:21] because he wanted to be able to occupy
[2:25] every part of who you are
[2:30] [Music]
[2:36] you
