TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I'm coming to you again today on behalf of New Hope revival ministries our ministry in Alabama in the United States and also on behalf of the gospel channel our partner we are so delighted that God has given us this opportunity we've been coming to you now for over a year and I've been involved with the channel for many years now and have made several trips to Iceland and I never cease to be amazed that God is using that little place Iceland it's a beautiful place but it's a small place and God is using it to have such an impact I don't know where you're watching the program from today but I know that it is a blessing to you the channel and the ministries that are represented there and I can tell that God is doing things in your life by your phone calls by your prayer requests by your praise reports and so we're here today because we want to be I'm not here today out of a deep sense of obligation I'm here because I want to be God has opened up this door and he has given us the grace to be able to come and share with you I hope a message that will encourage you I hope that it will be a message that will help you be directed in your life toward a closer relationship with Jesus Christ so let me invite you to continue to share your prayer requests and your praise reports with us it's always encouraging to hear that God answers prayer we know he does but it's always encouraging when someone calls or writes and they have such desperate need and it burdens our hearts sometimes as we read the need and almost feels like that we would like to reach out you know with our own hand with our arms we would like to reach out and join hands with you wherever you are and so at times in prayer our hearts feel like they're being joined with yours as we take your need the Lord and so when we hear that God has answered prayer that the tests have turned out okay that God has moved in a legal situation that the symptoms are gone and that someone is confessing their total healing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ than it is certainly an encouragement to us perhaps you've noticed that there have been a few weeks where you may have not seen a new program we want to bring you new programming we absolutely do but one of the reasons why you might have noticed that is because I've just returned from Kenya with my two sons benjamin judah and joshua river and we had a wonderful time in kenya we ministered in nairobi and we ministered in Nakuru and all what a glorious reunion it was it had been some 18 years since the last time that I was ministering in Kenya and I have to tell you that I gave out all that I had to give the church at home was praying for us the family was praying for us and it took a toll because of the pool of the people [Applause] but I received more than I gave because I was able to hear glorious testimonies of the faithfulness of God and many of them 18 years in the making I met people who came to tell me what God had done in their lives 18 years before and why they were where they are today many of them gave thanks to God and credit to our ministry there in that area and all what a blessing what a joy that was to know that when we do something in the will of God for the kingdom of God with his anointing the results can be long-lasting and lives can be changed it was my desire for many years to go back to Kenya but waiting on the perfect timing of the Lord and not only did he reveal to us his timing but he made provision it was not an inexpensive trip but he made provision our little Church in Alabama they stepped up and gave sacrificially not only to send me to minister but to send my two sons with me and I think if you're watching this and you're a parent you will certainly know there's no greater joy than seeing God using your own children for the kingdom and so Africa is on our hearts today we're going to be going back to Ghana in the spring of this year and who knows what else God has but this is a ministry that is also very important to us to be able to come to you on a regular basis and share what is in our hearts I just want you to know that no matter what's going on in your life or what's going on in the world around you God is still good he is still mindful of right where you are what you're going through how you're feeling and whether you recognize it or not he already has a plan to bring youth he does if god's grace brings you to it that same grace will bring you through it i believe that so look to him and understand what a privilege it is to know that somewhere there is a great big God and he's not a million miles away to the believer to the believer we know exactly where he lives he lives in his people and what a joy to know that he has a blueprint my life is not taking him by surprise he knew it as we have been teaching in the first two lessons of this series in the fullness of time today is part three and we'll go back to our original text and we'll read that to refresh your memory and then we'll move forward in the teaching in galatians chapter 4 beginning in verse 1 and reading through verse 7 now I say that as that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage this is spiritually children we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he are sons God hath set forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father Papa wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ I don't know about you but those words fill me with strength they so encouraged me to know that God has an appointed time for all things and in all things and we all start out in this place of being immature we are teknon is the greek word we are adolescents we are children we have a lot to learn but as we progress in the things of God as we live the journey as we walk the miles we are ever learning we are ever changing and by the promise of God we are ever growing and we not only grow in knowledge and hopefully in wisdom but we grow in authority we are coming to a place where in the eyes of our Father we can be fully trusted to conduct his business on planet Earth I would like to say that in my understanding of the scripture all that has happened up until this hour this last time what we sometimes refer to on this program as the end of the end times I believe that's where we are I'm one of those old-fashioned preachers who still believes that the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is near at hand I believe that there are some things that are unfolding and taking place now that will accelerate us as sons of God into the finality of our ministry because I believe that everything that has happened up until this point is so that in the last of the last days there would be a company of adopted sons no longer in the immaturity stage but moving from the Technol the way up to the wheels son a fully adopted trustworthy son you know there were things in my life that I thought crippled me but God could use them he could take full advantage of what I felt like was a handicap for instance I didn't grow up in a home with a mother and a father my father was gone and he was absent from my life and many times as a child as a teenager in my early twenties even preparing for marriage at 29 almost 30 I felt handicapped in many ways but one of the benefits of that was God was teaching me I didn't learn it overnight in fact I should be transparent and say I'm still learning but I believe the lesson in my life because of what I viewed as a handicap was really God desiring to teach me how to fully depend on him we have a father we have a father who has so loved us who has so known as we talked about in Episode one in two of this series who has so fully known who we are who we will be that the Scriptures have told us that all of our days are numbered that God has seen it all from the beginning Psalm 139 and verse 16 in the complete Jewish Bible said your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book all my days were already written my days had been shaped before any of them exists it Jeremiah we mentioned him the last time we were together the word of the Lord came to him in in chapter 1 verses 4 & 5 before I formed V in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations these scriptures give us so much confidence and hope in the God who has called us that before we were ever born while we were yet in our mother's womb he had a purpose for our life a calling on our life for many of us it was a high calling there is no other calling any higher than to be a surrendered servant of the Lord Jesus Christ and to serve him by serving others and he knew that he knew what would be going on in my family he knew that my dad would be absent he knew that my mom would suffer greatly that many things would happen in our lives my parents divorced when I was five years old my mother remarried some time after that it wasn't immediate but sometime after that my mother remarried and she she married a man who had been greatly abused as a child and as a teenager and because he had never come to healing and wholeness through Jesus he knew he had some influences in his life trying to point him in the right direction but he had never found peace in a relationship with the Lord and because of that he passed on the abuse and he mistreated my mother emotionally and he physically abused her in in a bloody way and all of this had such an effect on her life she was not a believer at the time and it certainly had an effect on my life I was not allowed to go to church in those days we moved away from the place that I had been born and that my the rest of my family lived and I remember standing many times at the window on Sunday morning of the second-story apartment where we lived watching the church bus that was in the days where churches still had bus ministry and I can see those children it's strange but I can see them now in my mind getting on that church bus to go to Sunday school and the tears running down my face because I so desperately wanted to be in the presence of the Lord God had already done something in my life at an early age and I wanted to be a part of what was going on on the other end of that bus route but God was shaping it and as I stood there's many many times tears streaming down my face his presence would come to me sometimes his voice would speak to me in my inner heart I would know that it was him and he would let me know somehow sometimes again I'm not ashamed to say it was by an inner voice sometimes it was by an inner feeling I just knew that God was going to turn things around in my life and in my mother's life and he was faithful to do that so there was pain in every life I think there are probably no ideal childhoods you know there's something even if you live in a beautiful home where there are two parents sometimes there are still people are human and mistakes are made and and we all have things that wound us deeply but I want you to know that God saw it he saw it before it ever happened and I think we've discussed on this program more than once well if God saw that it was going to be bad then why didn't he just stop it well I want you to know that many things that happen to us in our life God didn't create them they were created in my choices and decisions that either we made are those responsible for us made and we make choices and there are repercussions there are consequences by our choices and by our decisions and therefore there things that happen in our life that are beyond our control and God has chosen not to control every aspect of our lives we have a free will to choose him to choose what is right over what is wrong and so okay we can say why didn't he stop it because he didn't create it but he knew it I want you to understand he didn't make it happen he didn't create that situation but he knew it was coming in his foreknowledge did he allow it he allowed it yes I would have to say he did but for a far greater purpose in you than you can understand without the help of the Holy Spirit and our human understanding we will wallow in the pain of the past but when the Spirit of the Lord begins to to connect the dots or put the pieces of the puzzle together and show us what what we need to do sometime is allow the Lord to walk with us by the Spirit through those dark moments of our life I think everyone watching this program is familiar with the poem footprints and you know it's the truth perhaps it's something that's been used to so much and painted about and sung about and expressed so often in greeting cards and posters on the wall that that it's become so common that we forget the power of the truth but a man had a dream and in that dream he saw footprints on the sand and he saw that there were events in his life that he could look in and see and it seemed that in the darkest moments of his life instead of there being two sets of footprints there was only one and then there would be other times that he could clearly see in life things were better and there were two sets of footprints walking in the sand and he complained to the Lord like all of us have I mean let's be real we've all said Lord where are you have you forgotten me and he complained to the Lord as the as the poem goes and he said Lord why is it that in the times that I needed you the most you left me it's clear to me there's only one set of footprints I don't know where you were but you were not with me and I need an answer I need an explanation for why there were only one set of footprints in the sand and the and the Lord just replied that is not because I left you it's not because I forsook you it's not because I didn't know what was going on in your life and I left you to do it by yourself it's because I picked you up and I was carrying you in those darkest moments you were over my shoulder I knew that you couldn't make it by yourself I knew that your strength was gone I knew that you were to the point of giving up and I knew the only thing that I could do for you was to pick you up and carry you through those deep dark valleys through that awful pain and grief and loss that's why there's only one set of footprints because I was carrying you and I don't know if that's become so common that it can no longer minister to you but I'll tell you what it's still ministers to me and I believe it with everything that I am and and we need that experience sometime to walk back through life we the Lord with the help of the spirit don't do it by yourself because you you'll get caught up in the pain of the past but if you just say Lord would you show me would you walk through some of those memories with me and show me some of the ways that you were helping me and how that situation has shaped me and molded me in such a way that you could redeem the pain of it you could use the lessons that I learned maybe I didn't even know I was learning anything I was just in survival mode but now I can recognize by the grace of God I was learning something I was being prepared I was really sitting under tutors and life was teaching me something that I would need to be able to be so yielded to God in the end and and ultimately dependent on him if we can come to that understanding that if we accomplished anything good in our life it is because he has done it in us and through us it is not because we are clever or handsome intelligent well-educated trained in the social graces of life it's because we have somehow learned to yield to the Creator to the one who loves us the most who knows us the best and loves us the most and he's using these things to promote us you say well I'll tell you brothers Yeley it doesn't always feel like a promotion well that's just like any discipline that you go through any any any real teaching moment that you go through it doesn't feel good at the moment you know the Bible talks about the chastening of the Lord and I know that the church today they don't want to talk about the fact that sometimes we get we get chastened we get dealt with but it's not because god wants to destroy you or break you and leave you hopeless it's because he wants to teach you the importance of totally leaning on him and allowing him to live his life through you oh if the church at large could understand that's what grace is it's not God turning the other way and refusing to see the mistakes the sin that we commit but it's God loving us so much that he is always present to help us when we call to forgive us when we ask and to redeem the situation to take us all the way back to God's original thoughts about us in the beginning so in the first two episodes of this series we covered so many scriptures that talk about God knowing and God being aware and God having foreknowledge and I am so thankful that he does and that he did when we ended the last program we were in first John chapter 4 verses 12 and 13 no man had seen God at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in US and his love is perfected in us there are some things that we have been made aware of there are some things that we have experienced in a token in a measure that must now be perfected in us and love is one of those things there is a perfect love there is a love perfected and that love is higher than than the phileo love the human love one for another it's the agapo it's it's the God love it's the perfect love and the truth is that when love is perfected in us we can love as God loves are you there brother Shelly I didn't say I was there but I'm on the journey I know that God is allowing things in my life to bring me to the place that his love can be perfected in me what is your what is your attitude about that well I'll tell you my attitude is bring it on Lord it's not always what I want it's not always with circumstances that I would choose but if it will allow me to be more yielded so that the things that you have started in my life can also be perfected and finished then I'm willing because if God allows you to walk through it remember he's already seen the other end and he knows that if you keep leaning on him he'll carry you when you can't carry yourself and you'll find that his love his grace his mercy his virtues are being perfected in you verse 13 hereby know we that dwell in him and he in us because he had given us of his spirit don't ever forget that by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we have received the Spirit of Jesus Christ the very spirit that was in his body in his earthly ministry that is the very same spirit that now dwells in us that makes us alive not physically alive but spiritually abundantly alive God had a plan we've talked about his plan for our lives but remember that he was the Great Architect from the beginning in the mind of God a blueprint was developed a thought many many many about humanity about the world about the amount of time and what would need to be happening in the earth before God could become man before the eternal spirit of the father could condescend into a body of flesh as John chapter 1 tells us in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he later says in that chapter and the word became flesh that couldn't happen just any time it didn't happen in the days of Noah in the days of Abraham in the days of Elijah in the days of Isaiah even in the days of Malachi the last prophet that we read of in the Old Testament everything had to be lined up in God's mind and then he watched the earth so that when everything that needed to come into place would come into place he then knew that it was the fullness of time and in the fullness of time God sent forth his son into the world thanks be to God a way was made first the plan the blueprint was developed and then God in his mind made a way to accomplish his plans all of this was determined before the foundation of the world God's provided way the way that he would choose to bring salvation and redemption to the earth that was not an afterthought remember that was not somehow a reaction to what Lucifer had accomplished through the serpent in the garden no it was rather something that God had in his mind from the very beginning I just don't believe that the God of the by and the god I serve has been running around for over 6,000 years a few steps behind the devil and always trying to find out how to react to what the enemy does that's not the God of the Bible that's not the god I serve the God of the Bible knew from the beginning exactly how things were going to happen in the Garden of Eden and before there was a fall there was already a plan for restoration before there was a sin there was already a plan for the forgiveness of sin before man ever recognized what it really means to have fellowship with the Creator it was already in the mind of God to give us from the day of Pentecost forward a full baptism of the very same spirit that would live in the life and body of Jesus Christ none of these things were after thoughts the church ages of history as we know it that wasn't a part of God's afterthought oh no he thought it in the beginning and and each time you know many times down through these ages from the book of Genesis forward there are those moments we call them Chi heroes moments when things really come into a junction and God shows up in such a profound way and of course there was no greater junction in time than the one that happened in little Bethlehem when God became a man of flesh in Hebrews chapter 4 verses 3 & 4 it reads for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did arrest the seventh day from all his works these are wonderful verses of Scripture in Hebrews chapter 3 and chapter 4 where we learn about a rest that is promised to the people of God where we learn that it becomes necessary for us to sit under the word and then take our faith our contribution in this equation is faith to join our faith with the Word of God to let every cell of our body and every fiber of our being say Amen I fully trust God and I fully trust what he says and if he promised that he is faithful to do it and remember that God was angry with the children of Israel there was wrath involved because he gave them the opportunity to enter into rest and rather they they chose to quarrel and they chose to murmur and they chose to complain and so the Bible tells us in those same chapters even though the the glorious marvelous Word of God that was being delivered to them in that generation by the prophet Moses it could not have the full effect in their life in fact the Bible said it profited them little and why the answer was because it was not mixed with faith and God is speaking through the Apostle Paul to the to the Hebrew believers and this little phrase is stuck right in the middle of this admonition he said although the works were finished from before the foundation of the world the way was already made for the people of God to enter into the rest but it was not time and so what God did is he gave us from the book of Genesis all the way up to the coming of the Messiah tokens of rest tokens of rest the Shabbat the Sabbath was a sign token of rest God rested ceased from his labor to show us this amazing picture of God providing a perfect rest for those who would trust in him it's more than a nap on Saturday afternoon it was a state of mind it was a place it was it's really a realm it's really a dimension in the spirit Sabbath rest it's marked on the earth by a day but really it's a person and that person is the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bride of Christ the sons of God the sons of the kingdom that are being raised up in this hour to come into true union and real fellowship with him we will be the demonstrations of this kind of rest and this rest was not made available until Jesus came as the Messiah to give us total rest but the scripture said here these works were finished from the foundation of the world can I just say God's got this we need to trust him he's been working on this a long time well youth youth look around you you watch the news and you say huh this is out of control I want you to know God is allowing the heathen to rage God is allowing the world to come into this place of chaos but he gets the last say he gets the last move on the chessboard of life I'm telling you right now he has a plan to race up a people that will show forth the great grace of Jesus Christ as it has never been shown because he showed it as one man on the day of Pentecost the same life that was in here was multiplied and distributed to 120 and then the spirit of religion began to work and what God tried to bring what God was bringing to pass what he was doing on the day of Pentecost it was only a matter of time before man began to water down that experience and divide among themselves because of dogmas and creeds and religious philosophies and ideas and it has taken the entirety of the church ages to bring us all the way back to the restoration of all things and we are now living in the time of the restoration of all things and there's no reason not one reason whatsoever that a bride cannot now step forward in the fullness of what God has called her for from before the foundation of the world the only thing that's causing delay is you and I and we can choose today I'm not gonna be responsible for the delay anymore I'm gonna fully yield my life to all that God has called me for I don't yet know you may not yet know the fullness of your purpose on this earth through the years God has revealed to me just a little tiny pieces of why I'm here and I hold on to them every day I would say almost every day they come to my mind but I don't yet know the fullness of my reason for being here but I want to know and I know that you don't find out by reading the paper and you don't find out by watching most of what's on television you only find out by spending more time in His Word and more time leaning on him that's my advice to discover who you are in him in Acts chapter 15 and verse 18 the Bible said known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world everything that God has ever done and everything that God is ever going to do it was already in his mind from the big of the world now that is the truth that will stagger you until you come to the revelation of the beautiful sovereignty of God and then here are two verses of Scripture that I think are important one is revelation 13 verse 8 where it reads and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him and it's referring to the Beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the book of the revelation is talking about those who will receive the system of the Beast they will receive the Ministry of the Antichrist and the false prophet and why will they do that because their names are not found written in the Lamb's Book of Life the book of Redemption from the foundation of the world am I to believe that these people had no choice no that's not what the scripture is saying to us at all the scripture reveals that they had like you and I a choice but in God's foreknowledge he saw that they would not choose do you know that this is mind-blowing it really is to think that even at the end of the end there will be those who will not ultimately choose to surrender their lives to the Creator the one who breathed life into them it is mind-blowing you would think that at the end of the and that's why the church has tried to come up with all kinds of little crafty ideas and doctrines and and whatever to teach us ultimate reconciliation and that in the end every person will be saved didn't have to die the way he died the scriptures are clear there will be those lost there are those in Hell right now and there will be many many others who will go to hell not because they didn't have a choice but because they made the wrong choice and because God knew their choice from before the beginning of the foundations of the earth many of them whose names were written in the book of life the book that records all human life on the earth they were never written in the Lamb's Book of Life or as the scripture says in Revelation 13 and 8 whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb we call it the Lamb's Book of Life in the Lamb's Book of Life are written the names of those who in their lives will choose to serve the Lord some from early ages some in their middle age some at the end of life but all that will choose to serve the Lord their names are recorded there and then another verse similar is Revelation chapter 17 and verse 8 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world see these names not only was the lamb as we read in Revelation 13 and 8 the lamb was slain I know that history teaches us and it is true that 2000 years ago the Lord Jesus Christ lived and died on a hill just outside the city of Jerusalem that was the that was the fulfillment and that was the reality and that was from the moment the point of origin where we could claim that sacrifice we could claim that death according to the Apostle Paul we can claim that death as our own death we can claim that suffering as our own suffering and we can claim his resurrection as our own resurrection or if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken or make alive not only your spirit man but one day your mortal body even though it may have been laid in the ground there is a resurrection and so this Lamb we know 2,000 years of church history but we understand from the scripture that in the mind of God the lamb was slain before there was an atom before there was a garden east of eden and before the world before he spoke let there be light in the mind of God the lamb was already slain oh how I love this I can't help it I love this God has a plan for planet Earth and he always has and he always will before there was a sinner there was a savior before there was a sick person there was a healer it was already provided for in the mind of God won't you serve Him can I ask you won't you serve God won't you surrender everything that you are and follow Jesus Christ the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so in Revelation 13 and 8 we see the lamb slain from the foundation of the of the world and then in revelation 17 and 8 we we read about those whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world which leads us to believe that from the foundation of the world there were names if these are those in 17/8 if these are those whose names were not written I want to know about those whose names were written and I'm glad to say today I'm one of them how could you make such a statement because I know it by the spirit it has been revealed to me that I am one of them whose names was found written not because I deserved anything but because God looked ahead before I was ever born and he knew that I would choose him and I have and I'm going to choose him tomorrow and I'm going to choose him the next day and I'm going to keep on choosing him because it's only in knowing him that we have real life and real peace and real joy we knowed in the scripture that 4000 years approximately before Jesus came Yeshua was born God gave Adam the first prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah but it took 4000 years for that prophecy to come to pass and I'll read it to you and it's it's beautiful because from the beginning God was letting it be known I've got away this thing is gonna turn around there may be many times in history that if you're standing off observing you may think that Satan is winning you may think that death prevails but I want you to know that at the end of the end of the end the one who's heals is going to crush the head of the seed of the serpent that one is going to in the fullness of time that one is going to come I'm a little excited Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 and 15 the first messianic prophecy recorded in the Holy Scripture and the Lord God said in to the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now let's remind ourselves what did the serpent do that he received such a curse he yielded himself he allowed Lucifer Satan to step into his body and to use him and I want you to know this sounds like a you know an unusual circumstance here but it still happens today this was a beast of the field but men and women today still yield themselves for the spirit of evil for for the devil himself to operate in their lives not just through witchcraft not just through Satanism but anytime that we allow the enemy to win instead of yielding to our creator's will for our lives we're being used you know you're being used all the time of something let it be God your Creator the one who loves you the most don't yield your members to sin the Apostle Paul said don't yield your members to unbelief but possess the reins of your mind choose what is holy what is virtuous what is beautiful what is perfect and refuse that which is of the enemy and the serpent yielded himself his body even occupied by Satan and he paid a price because before this moment the serpent he didn't look like the snake he walked upright he was a beast perhaps very much like a man but now he's going to crawl on his belly and eat dust all the days of his life and verse 15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed the seed of the Serpent and the seed of the woman it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel evil Satan darkness would surely take ahold of the heel of the seed of a woman but don't you think for one moment that was the end of the story if Jesus the Apostle tells us really like this if Jesus would have only died for the sins of mankind and remained in the grave much of what we believe much of what we hope much of what we stand on would all be in vain but thanks be to God he didn't just stay there there was a plan and three days later he conquered death hell and the grave perhaps Satan thought I've done it I have killed the Savior but all let me tell you something he wasn't able to keep him or to hold him because Jesus came forth from the grave victorious over sin over death over hell and over the grave and he holds the key in his hand I'm so thankful for that and I'm so thankful that even though the enemy was allowed to to bruise the heel of the seed of the woman he was not able to change God's plan of provision for planet Earth because ultimately he got his head bruised I like to say crushed I like to say that our Lord Jesus Christ put his foot on the enemy on death on Hell on the grave it was only through this sinless son of man that full atonement could be made for man's sin but the law of sin and death for disobedience to God's law it had to be broken and the only way that it could be broken was by a sinless man a sinless one and that was our Lord Jesus Christ though he was tempted in all manner even as we are yet without sin the Old Testament teaches of an offering a sacrifice to be made before the Lord and it must be a blameless Lamb it must be a spotless lamb without flaw without blemish so examined by by the rabbi the priests so examined that a few discoloured hairs a crooked leg could disqualify that offering but our lamb the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world came in purity and holiness in a sinless life of perfection though tempted in his body of flesh he overcame and you and I can also overcome because he did so we have an atonement that has been made thank God not only friend has our sins have they all been covered by the blood of the Lamb but I'm thankful for the revelation of remittance they have been remitted we are fully justified by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ just if I'd never sinned he has removed my sin he has removed your sin if you're walking in a state of repentance before him so far away farther than the East is from the way he has cast them there drowned in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered against you any more praise be to God and now we can live a life of hope and victory and promise no matter what's going on no matter what our life looks like no matter what the world around us looks like we know we know who this is living inside father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank you for every person watching this program today whether it's on the gospel

sovereign that you have a blueprint that you have a plan and that you are willing you are able you are ready to guide us through every obstacle of life you have won the victory you are the overcomer and because you have overcome we can also overcome Lord I pray for the sick and the afflicted you are the healer you not only purchase salvation and redemption but you in your atonement you purchased healing and health and deliverance from disease and from lying symptoms and I pray right now for those who are sick and infirmed that you will minister and manifest your healing virtue to them in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray for the prayer requests that have come in and those that will come in that you will move in such a way that only you can receive the glory Lord I know you
