Description:
We are a supernatural people equipped with everything we need to win this battle. We can defeat the enemy with joy and peace, with longsuffering, with meekness, with kindness and gentleness.  That is our inheritance.  That is our armor.   Those are the weapons we use against the onslaughts of the evil one.  Anger will not cast out devils, they’re cast out with love.  The devil is no match against these weapons.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and not only are we a supernatural people but God has given us everything we need supernaturally to win this battle [Music] what will happen when we awaken that Supernatural power that is already in us we're not waiting for a place to go and get it we're not waiting for another portion of it we're waiting for something to awaken it within our spirit I want you to know I don't know anything better than praise to awaken what is dormant in your life I know the words the answer I know the word is the answer for everything but if you've got something dormant in your life connect to him and that's through our praise he's coming back for a church just like he births on the day of Pentecost he said it same power same signs same wonders same power same Authority this word has taken us right back to where he started the thing now we've got to catch a hold of that and allow God to awaken every part that's laying dormant in US so that we can step up and take our positions if your confession is this I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and therefore every Redemptive blessing of God is mine and any place where I have been short in the past in manifesting the Supernatural Armor of God I confess I decree I declare in the mighty name of Jesus that I will be filled and protected with love with joy with peace with long suffering with meekness with goodness with gentleness because that is my inheritance and then figuratively our Lord is confessing out over the heavenlies do you hear that he's filled with love he's filled with joy he's filled with peace and the angels say then let me go and minister to him and let me go minister to her and let me do what I can to help make sure that they're walking in the promise that they're confessing so not only do we serve a supernatural God we are Supernatural people and not only are we a supernatural people but God has given us everything we need supernaturally to win this battle there is a secret Rapture coming for the supernatural bride of Jesus Christ we have the gifts of the Spirit that are given to us as armor you meet the enemy with love and joy and peace and come on brother Branham tells us how devils are cast out they're not cast out in anger [Music] devils are cast out in love that's how the enemy is defeated it's by that armor that God has given us thank you Jesus for it he's given us his word which is the greatest weapon that anybody can have against the enemy and then thankfully God has also given us a five-fold Ministry to help prepare us to help protect us to help keep us in the faith because we are a supernatural people
