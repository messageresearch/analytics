TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I have crossed that old hot buring desert while wanding the right road to [Music] choose oh but somewhere up ahead I know there's cool clear water and defeat is one word I never use oh too many sunsets lie behind the mountain you believe that too many rivers these old feet have walked through too many Treasures are awaiting Over Yonder I've just got too much to gain to [Music] lose to many miles behind me and to many rivers are through and too many sunsets help me to remember that I've got to much to gain to lose oh we can't lose now come on oh too many sunsets Li behind the mountain oh and too many rivers my tired feet have walked through too many Treasures are waiting oh Over Yonder I've got too much to gain to lose see if this sounds like your life I have crossed that old hot burning desert [Music] while wondering the right road to choose but I know that somewhere just up ahead there is cool clear water and defeat is a word the bride should never use [Music] oh too many sunsets lie behind the mountain do you understand what you're singing too many rivers my feet have already walked through to many Treasures are waiting Just Over Yonder oh I've got too much to gain to lose I'd like to hear you sing with me sing it out oh to many sunsets lie behind those mountains and there have been too many rivers my my feet have walk through too many Treasures are waiting over Yonder I've got too much to [Music] gain there are too many miles already behind me and to many trials are through and too many tear drops help me to remember I've got too much woo to gain to [Music] lose oh to many [Music] sunsets Li behind the mountains oh and to many rivers my feet have walk through to me many Treasures are waiting over Yonder i' got too much to gain to [Music] lose yes you've got too much to gain to [Music] lose come on give the Lord Praise
