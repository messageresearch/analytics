========================================

Description:
In this powerful moment, we explore the spiritual crisis of our time - the cooling of love within the church. As iniquity abounds and generational sins take hold, many believers find their love growing cold, impacting their relationships with God and others.

Key points covered:

How the spirit of the age has affected our ability to love
The importance of maintaining God's agape love in our lives
Why prayer and the fire of the Holy Spirit are crucial for thawing frozen love
The connection between leaving our first love (Jesus) and the waxing cold of love
Practical ways to rekindle our passion for Christ and His presence

This clip calls believers to examine their hearts, return to their first love, and allow God's love to flow freely through them once again. It's a timely reminder of the power of genuine, Christ-centered love in a world desperately in need of it.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because iniquity is abounding around us because generational sins are taking over the age that we live in it's like something has breathed cool air frigid air on our love and we are no longer capable of loving one another the way we should the way that we have been loved because the spiritual temperature has been so affected in the atmosphere of This World by iniquity iniquity has taken such a stronghold in our land that it's like the enemy himself has breathed cool air and it has dried out our love it has chilled or made our love be almost Frozen and when love is frozen it can't be given it can't be shared it becomes solid it becomes dry it's no longer exchangeable how many of you know we don't only want to receive his agape love but we want to exchange it we want to share it we want it to flow through us to the brothers first to the household of faith first but also to a world that's dying and going to a devil's hell the enemy the spirit of the age has breathed on the love of the church this isn't husband wife love this is God's love to us our love to one another therefore all men shall know that they are my disciples because they make all the right quotations no because they have love one for another and love would rather take the blame than to excuse themselves and push the blame on someone else if we're in that kind of a family and we are if we're in that kind of family there's only one solution for us and that is to pray like wild men pray like wild women that the fire of the Holy Ghost will burn so hot so bright so hot so powerful that it thaws out our Frozen love amen come on greater love hath no man than this that a man would lay down his life for his friends Jesus did that on our behalf but sometimes we have to do that for one another because not to do it would be to expose someone in a way they don't particularly need to be exposed in such an hour as this cold love will shut down prayer it shifts Godly worship to Will worship and it will disable the flow of the healing virtue in a church sickness will prevail in a house where Frozen Love is the stronghold the real cause of waxing cold in your love is because you leave your first love if you emphatically hold on to Jesus as the number one love of your life you will so value his love for you that you long to be a pipeline you long to be a conduit for that love to flow through you that kind of love doesn't keep a record of wrongs that kind of love doesn't behave itself unseemly that kind of love doesn't get puffed up I want to tell you something folks years of service for the Lord it doesn't give us a free pass it doesn't mean that we don't have to keep fighting and when you get really in love with him you start looking for an excuse to be in his presence instead of looking for an excuse not to I understand when people are made to work but I don't understand people volunteering to work and missing a service that I don't understand if we're ever going to get back to a RedHot love for one another first we're going to have to get back to when he was our what does it mean to be first loved it means to love him above and be Beyond yes sir my number one affection my number one love my number one priority is Jesus Christ you've allowed your love to grow cold because you have left the reason why you started in the first place was him it was him
