[1:32] tuning in to the broadcast we're going
[1:35] to continue our study today that we
[1:37] started the last time we were together
[1:40] about God's pattern discovering God's
[1:44] pattern for our lives in this hour and
[1:47] uh I pray that something will be said
[1:49] today that will bless you and encourage
[1:52] you and help you along the way amen so
[1:55] let's get right back to the word of God
[1:57] we were in Exodus chapter 25: 8 and9 let
[2:02] me read that again for you to refresh
[2:04] your memory and let them make me a
[2:07] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[2:10] imagine that God wanted to dwell among
[2:14] men he had had very intimate fellowship
[2:18] with Adam in the cool of the evening in
[2:21] the Garden of Eden but now many years
[2:24] had come and gone and now God said I
[2:27] want to have Fellowship again this time
[2:30] I have two million people that I want to
[2:33] meet with I want to dwell among and in
[2:36] order to do that he was giving Moses
[2:40] these instructions about making a
[2:42] tabernacle a sanctuary that I may dwell
[2:45] among them and then in verse n according
[2:48] to all that I show thee after the
[2:51] pattern of the Tabernacle and the
[2:54] pattern of all the instruments thereof
[2:57] even so shall you make it I like the
[3:00] fact that God was specific enough and
[3:04] and it must have been a great comfort to
[3:06] Moses to know that he was not only going
[3:09] to be given this huge task of creating a
[3:12] sanctuary on the earth for God to dwell
[3:15] in but he was going to be given uh
[3:18] specific details and the pattern of how
[3:22] God wanted it to be constructed the
[3:24] reason why we're doing this study is we
[3:27] believe as we said earlier that the
[3:30] Bride of the Messiah the Bride of the
[3:33] Lord Jesus Christ is being prepared in
[3:36] this hour so that we might come into
[3:38] that special place of Oneness and
[3:41] fellowship with him that we might
[3:44] actually demonstrate his character and
[3:47] his anointing and his authority in the
[3:50] earth and in order to walk with him in
[3:52] that kind of surrender uh that kind of
[3:56] Oneness it it becomes imperative that we
[4:00] discover what God expects out of us what
[4:04] he desires to be present and active in
[4:07] our life and even the things that he he
[4:10] wants us to refrain from the things that
[4:13] he wants us to stay away from so that we
[4:16] can better reflect who he is and so I
[4:20] think in order to to move into that we
[4:23] have to establish the fact that from the
[4:25] beginning God has been meticulous from
[4:28] the beginning God God has been uh very
[4:31] picky about what he wanted and how he
[4:35] wanted things to be carried out and even
[4:38] constructed in the earth when we left
[4:40] you on the Last Broadcast we were
[4:42] talking about the four reasons why there
[4:46] was a need for the Tabernacle or the
[4:49] mishon in the wilderness number one it
[4:52] was so that God might dwell among his
[4:55] people and we finished with number two
[4:57] last week so that God might teach his
[5:00] people of his Holiness you see God
[5:03] didn't just want to be a God above his
[5:06] people far away in the Starry Sky uh so
[5:10] that they would have to guess and wonder
[5:13] and Marvel about his Holiness he wanted
[5:16] to come down with his manifested
[5:20] presence and teach his people I I think
[5:23] that's so wonderful that God cares so
[5:26] much about his people that he wants to
[5:28] teach us of his ways and his Holiness is
[5:32] something that still baffles our mind
[5:35] how how he is so holy and so pure and so
[5:41] righteous and how you and I fall so
[5:43] short and yet he invites us to come and
[5:47] learn of his Holiness and partake and
[5:52] participate in his righteousness all the
[5:55] righteousness that we can muster up in
[5:58] our human effort is still just like
[6:01] filthy rags in the sight of such a holy
[6:04] God but when we learn how to reach in by
[6:09] the spirit and access his Holiness then
[6:13] we become like a mirror we become a
[6:17] reflection a reflective purpose uh of
[6:20] the glory and the Holiness and the
[6:23] righteousness of God in the earth and
[6:25] when people look into us like looking
[6:28] into a mirror they will begin to see God
[6:32] reflected they will begin to see the
[6:34] character and the nature the compassion
[6:37] and the loving kindness of god let's
[6:39] face it I don't think there's enough of
[6:42] that on display in any of our lives but
[6:45] as we mentioned before there's a
[6:47] precious work that's going on on the
[6:50] inside of the inside of every believer
[6:53] in this hour and we don't have a lot of
[6:56] time left in this preparation process so
[7:00] don't be surprised if things get heated
[7:02] up in your life don't be shocked if
[7:05] things around you seem to become
[7:08] disheveled if they seem to become a
[7:10] little bit chaotic and if you find
[7:12] yourself pulled or even driven to your
[7:16] knees please understand that it's God's
[7:19] perfect way he's bringing us to a place
[7:23] of total surrender and perfect
[7:26] submission to his perfect will and even
[7:29] the thing things that are going on in
[7:30] the earth we just finished a series here
[7:33] on the eagle cry about the birth Pains
[7:36] of the Messiah and what we see going on
[7:38] around us in the world um for us it it's
[7:42] like a time uh post it's like a
[7:45] signpost uh it it it's like a clock to
[7:49] remind us what time it is it's time for
[7:52] the bride to arise and shine it's time
[7:56] for the overcoming Remnant to begin to
[7:59] to uh stand up and be counted for the
[8:04] kingdom of God and to be usable in the
[8:07] service of the Lord in this hour and so
[8:10] it all begins in Us by examining by by
[8:14] learning by discovering what God really
[8:17] wants to do in us and through Us in this
[8:20] hour so he wanted to teach his people of
[8:23] his Holiness and then number three so
[8:26] that God might teach his people of their
[8:28] sinfulness
[8:30] now this somebody said well I'm not sure
[8:33] exactly how this works well when we
[8:36] understand and begin to see the beauty
[8:38] of the Holiness of God uh it just stands
[8:41] to reason that when we look inward we
[8:44] see the contrast we see how holy he is
[8:48] and how Unholy we are how righteous he
[8:51] is how unrighteous we are and it it
[8:55] doesn't uh it doesn't come that way to
[8:58] discourage us or to defeat us it comes
[9:02] to remind us and to teach us that
[9:05] without him we could never make it you
[9:08] see I just couldn't get holy enough in
[9:11] my own works I have to access his
[9:15] Holiness his righteousness as I said
[9:18] just a moment ago so when we see how
[9:20] holy he is and how Unholy we are in this
[9:24] life without the help of the Holy Spirit
[9:26] we begin to get a picture of our
[9:29] dependence on him we're living in a
[9:32] society where people have become so
[9:34] independent and they don't want to
[9:36] depend on anybody and I don't need
[9:38] anybody I'm I'm smart enough and strong
[9:40] enough to get by on my own well I want
[9:42] to tell you mister you're not going to
[9:45] make it in this last hour without the
[9:47] help and the strength of the Living God
[9:50] I don't care how intelligent you are how
[9:52] smart you are how deep in Witchcraft and
[9:55] satanic power you are you're not going
[9:58] to be able to over come in this wicked
[10:01] hour that we're living in now and that
[10:04] which is approaching upon the Earth
[10:06] without the power of the holy spirit in
[10:09] your life without without understanding
[10:12] and reflecting uh the virtue of of the
[10:16] Living God without knowing um what it
[10:20] means to be connected to him and what it
[10:23] means to draw from his life and from his
[10:27] strength we're just not going to make it
[10:29] without about that connection in this
[10:30] hour and that's why if there's ever been
[10:32] a time to run to the lord it's now uh
[10:36] the Earth is shaking around us kingdoms
[10:38] are shaking and and natural calamities
[10:41] are increasing and we're living in the
[10:43] birth Pains of the Messiah let's run to
[10:46] God our creator let's repent of our sin
[10:49] let's turn our backs on false religion
[10:52] and the lies of Satan and let's embrace
[10:55] the word of God like never before let's
[10:58] dig into it in the time that we have
[11:00] left and pray diligently for the Holy
[11:03] Ghost to open this book to us so that we
[11:07] can understand and and really know what
[11:10] God wants to do with us in this short
[11:13] work of the end time that period of time
[11:17] where things will be extremely dark
[11:20] around us but the Bride of the Messiah
[11:22] will rise up in the midst of darkness
[11:25] and will accomplish some amazing uh
[11:29] unbelievable demonstrations of the power
[11:32] of God in the earth and uh it's going to
[11:35] be a contrast the best of times the
[11:37] worst of times uh the darker it gets out
[11:40] there the brighter it needs to be
[11:42] getting in here so God wanted to come
[11:45] down in the Tabernacle to dwell among
[11:47] his people to teach his people about his
[11:49] Holiness to teach his people of their
[11:52] sinfulness and he wanted to teach his
[11:55] people how to approach him with
[11:57] offerings some times called sacrifices
[12:01] in the in the older Covenant or in the
[12:04] King James uh translation I I should say
[12:07] of the Old Testament uh often referred
[12:09] to as sacrifices what these really were
[12:12] were offerings that were brought to God
[12:15] a system of of offering of worship of
[12:19] obedience of submission was set up with
[12:22] such minute detail so that the people
[12:25] would always know how to approach God
[12:27] and one of the lessons that people
[12:29] learned from the offering system was you
[12:32] don't approach God empty-handed you come
[12:35] with something you come before him with
[12:38] something and I'll tell you what the
[12:40] something is he's looking for now even
[12:42] more than your tithe even more than your
[12:44] offering or your gold or silver he's
[12:47] looking for you to come with an offering
[12:49] of a laid down life he wants you to
[12:52] bring to him the offering of of a
[12:56] sacrificed life a life that says I can't
[12:59] do anything without you I don't want to
[13:02] talk without you I don't want to walk
[13:04] without you I want to be a pipeline for
[13:07] God to be manifested upon the Earth in
[13:10] the last days that's the greatest
[13:12] offering that we could bring to the Lord
[13:14] in this hour is is a is a big Eternal
[13:18] yes with with no uh with no Clauses in
[13:22] the contract uh no no Wass uh no wiggle
[13:25] room is what we say sometime but just a
[13:28] life that's says if you said it I
[13:30] believe it if your word requires it I'm
[13:32] going to do it if your word tells me to
[13:35] stay away from it I'm going to run away
[13:37] from it with everything that is within
[13:39] me the Bride of Jesus Christ in these
[13:43] last days must discover God's pattern we
[13:47] must discover what God is looking for in
[13:50] our lives and we must become that and we
[13:52] must do it immediately because there's
[13:55] much Supernatural work to be done on the
[13:58] earth in this last hour I want us to
[14:01] quickly turn we've we've been in Exodus
[14:04] the second book of the older Covenant
[14:06] now I want us to turn clean over to the
[14:09] last book of the newer Covenant the book
[14:11] of the Revelation and I want us to go to
[14:14] Revelation chapter 11 I I want us to to
[14:18] read about uh a Visionary experience of
[14:21] John when he was caught up in to the
[14:23] heavenlies in verse beginning in verse
[14:26] one and there was given me a read
[14:29] like unto a rod and the angel stood
[14:32] saying rise and measure the temple of
[14:35] God and the Altar and them that worship
[14:38] therein I want you to notice that he was
[14:41] to measure the temple of God he was to
[14:44] measure the altar in the temple of God
[14:47] and he was also to measure them that
[14:51] worship therein the people were also to
[14:54] be measured I want you to know that God
[14:57] is going to measure his people people in
[14:59] this last day and he's not going to do
[15:02] it by a Creed he's not going to do it by
[15:04] a Dogma he's not going to do it by some
[15:08] denominational system he's going to use
[15:11] another measuring device alog together
[15:15] and what is that it's his precious
[15:18] revealed word God is going to have a
[15:22] people who are measured by his word and
[15:26] when we read the word and we see see uh
[15:29] that there is a standard that has been
[15:32] set for us in how we ought to live our
[15:35] lives uh we need to quit trying to
[15:37] wiggle out we need to to quit trying to
[15:40] uh to get around the word of God and we
[15:43] need to just say Okay Lord life is short
[15:45] I was born for a purpose and and I'm
[15:48] just going to live by the book I'm just
[15:50] going to treat others like the scripture
[15:52] said and uh if there are things that are
[15:54] worldly that you're calling me away from
[15:57] I don't need them anyway
[15:59] um if there are things that you want me
[16:02] to do that I'm not doing and I read it
[16:04] in the word just give me the grace to do
[16:06] it now again please understand that our
[16:10] Salvation is not by works it's not by
[16:12] what we do or we do not do it's by Grace
[16:15] it's by faith we are not saved by works
[16:18] but we are saved unto Works which means
[16:21] the demonstration of our faith cannot be
[16:25] in any other Arena than in the arena of
[16:28] works
[16:29] how do we show our faith the New
[16:31] Testament talks about how do we
[16:33] demonstrate our faith how is our faith
[16:35] shown faith is demonstrated by our works
[16:40] our faith in the Messiah is displayed is
[16:44] demonstrated is manifested by our works
[16:48] so what kind of work should we have the
[16:50] works of God like those who came to
[16:53] Jesus and said what must we do that we
[16:56] might work the works of God that's not
[16:59] just about signs wonders and miracles
[17:02] that's about all the works of God the
[17:05] Redemptive works of God how we should
[17:07] redeem one another and love one another
[17:09] and pull one another in uh closer in
[17:13] this hour when the storms of life are
[17:15] raging all around us we need to Rally
[17:18] together with those of like Precious
[17:20] Faith Stand Together pray for our
[17:23] pastors pray for our leaders pray one
[17:26] for another the enemy has come down down
[17:29] Among Us with great wrath and he desires
[17:32] to destroy and to divide the body of
[17:34] Christ he wants to reak havoc in the
[17:38] kingdom of God but there is a little
[17:40] bride that is being prepared in this
[17:43] hour for her finest day a overcoming
[17:47] remnant of people who will step forth
[17:50] with the very word of God in their
[17:52] mouths and they will see Great and
[17:55] Mighty things accomplished on the earth
[17:58] some of which which like we read about
[18:00] in the acts of the Holy Spirit through
[18:02] the apostles now so uh notice back in
[18:05] Revelation chap 11 that uh John was
[18:09] given a re to measure like a rod and he
[18:12] was told to measure the temple The Altar
[18:15] and the worshippers but the court which
[18:17] is without the temple leave out and
[18:19] measure it not for it is given unto the
[18:22] Gentiles and the holy city shall they
[18:25] tread underfoot 4 and2 months and I will
[18:28] give power unto my two witnesses and
[18:32] they shall prophesy
[18:33] 1,23 score days clothed in sackcloth
[18:37] this is the two witnesses uh that we
[18:40] read about in
[18:41] Zachariah uh these are the two olive
[18:44] trees verse four and the two
[18:46] candlesticks standing before the god of
[18:48] the earth and it goes on to talk about
[18:52] the ministry of these two witnesses and
[18:54] and nothing would please me any more
[18:56] than to to read every bit of it to you
[18:59] because I I really appreciate this this
[19:02] language but let's just skip down to
[19:04] about verse 16 and the four and 20
[19:07] Elders which sat before God on their
[19:09] seats fell upon their faces and
[19:12] worshiped God saying we give thee thanks
[19:15] oh Lord God Almighty which art I I love
[19:19] that and was and art to come because
[19:23] thou has taken to thee thy great power
[19:26] and has reigned and and the nations were
[19:29] angry and thy wrath is come and the time
[19:32] of the Dead that they should be judged
[19:35] and that thou shouldest give reward unto
[19:38] thy servants the prophets and to the
[19:39] Saints and them that fear thy name small
[19:42] and great and should us destroy them
[19:44] which destroy the Earth and the temple
[19:47] of God was opened in heaven and there
[19:49] was seen in his Temple the Ark of his
[19:53] Testament and there were Lightnings and
[19:55] voices and thunderings and an earthquake
[19:58] and great ha
[19:59] so this gets really good as we as we
[20:02] read through these verses in Revelation
[20:05] 11 but what I want to focus on now is is
[20:09] as God gives this instruction to John he
[20:12] not only gives him the instruction to
[20:14] measure but he gives him a rod he gives
[20:18] him a measuring device he didn't say
[20:21] John you go find something to measure he
[20:24] gives him the proper measuring device
[20:28] and I want you to know that proper
[20:30] measuring device that has been given to
[20:33] us in this hour is the pure holy word of
[20:37] God that's how everything has to be
[20:40] measured not by the newspaper not by
[20:42] secular media the television not even by
[20:45] the church order not even by
[20:47] denominational Creed or Dogma but but it
[20:50] must be measured by the word of God now
[20:54] what does it mean to measure when we
[20:56] measure something it means to determine
[20:59] the dimensions of a particular something
[21:02] we want to know the length of it the
[21:04] width of it the height of it the breadth
[21:06] of it uh we want to ascertain the size
[21:10] the amount or the degree of something by
[21:13] using an instrument or device marked in
[21:17] standard units or by comparing it with
[21:21] an agreed standard and that's the
[21:24] problem today is everybody's using their
[21:26] own measuring stick and their own units
[21:29] of measurement to measure what a
[21:31] Christian what a child of God what a
[21:34] Believer is to be like in this hour and
[21:37] I just want to submit to you that it's
[21:39] not working so if if our little
[21:42] measuring rods and and yard sticks are
[21:45] no longer working why don't we go back
[21:47] to the original device of measurement
[21:50] back to the word of God this is God's uh
[21:53] design it's his desire if you want to
[21:56] know what pleases God uh you don't have
[21:59] to you don't have to to go to the
[22:01] prophet to hear what pleases God go to
[22:04] the word you don't even have to go to
[22:06] your pastor to discover what pleases God
[22:09] go to the word hopefully the true
[22:12] prophets of God and the true pastors of
[22:14] God are preaching to us breaking this
[22:18] bread of life down for us from the word
[22:21] but you've got the word of God you've
[22:24] got the standard of measurement and and
[22:26] we need to look to it and we need need
[22:28] to pray to the holy spirit of God to
[22:30] give us Revelation and understanding
[22:33] this word cannot be discerned with the
[22:35] natural mind it can only be discerned by
[22:40] the spiritual uh Mind by by thinking in
[22:43] that spiritual context and the only way
[22:45] we can do that is to do what the newer
[22:48] Covenant tells us and that's to put on
[22:49] the mind of Messiah try to take off the
[22:53] carnal secular mind of humanity and lay
[22:56] it aside and pick up the mind of the
[23:00] Messiah the mind of Christ and try to
[23:03] think his thoughts and if you if you get
[23:06] confused about how he would think about
[23:08] something where do we go to the word of
[23:11] God the word of God tells us what he
[23:14] thinks about the end time what he thinks
[23:16] about his bride what he thinks about
[23:19] those who despise Israel what he thinks
[23:22] about those who uh dare to raise a hand
[23:26] against the Jewish people or against his
[23:29] people all of his people around the
[23:31] world to discover God's mind is to is to
[23:35] discern the word and again that can't be
[23:39] done by education it can only be done by
[23:42] Revelation now God also measures to to
[23:46] determine Conformity to his pattern to
[23:50] his will and to his purposes God is very
[23:54] specific when he gives a pattern or a
[23:56] standard for something that he desires
[23:59] for instance in Genesis 6 verse
[24:03] 14-16 God gave specific dimensions
[24:08] specific measurements for the
[24:10] construction of Noah's Ark everything
[24:13] had to be by the Cubit to the Cubit to
[24:16] the letter no room for for fudging or
[24:20] smudging or stretching or shrinking it
[24:24] had to be exactly like God wanted it to
[24:28] be be in Exodus chap 25 and as we make
[24:32] our way through the next few chapters
[24:34] say up to about Exodus 31 God makes it
[24:39] extremely clear in meticulous detail
[24:43] about material and color choices of
[24:47] every item in the Tabernacle in the
[24:51] sanctuary that was to be built how
[24:54] according to the pattern what pattern
[24:57] the pattern that God showed Moses in
[25:00] Heavenly places when he was caught up in
[25:03] the spirit and each one of those items
[25:06] came with a color Choice with a material
[25:09] Choice uh whether it was AAA wood or or
[25:13] to be overlaid in gold and each one of
[25:16] those items also came with its own set
[25:20] of very detailed
[25:23] measurements um and it goes on I'm
[25:25] telling you when you get caught up in
[25:27] those measurements and those details you
[25:29] you read so from that we draw this
[25:31] conclusion that God is deeply concerned
[25:34] with the details of the place where he
[25:37] intends to dwell and he was going to
[25:41] come by his spirit and live where in the
[25:44] Tabernacle in the sanctuary the mishcon
[25:47] in the wilderness later in the temple
[25:50] and then later where first the
[25:53] Tabernacle then the temple and now where
[25:56] is it that God longs to dwell he longs
[26:00] to dwell in you and I and so if God is
[26:04] meticulous in his concern for detail
[26:08] about the Tabernacle and he is
[26:11] meticulous in his design and detail
[26:13] requirements for the temple what makes
[26:16] us think that we can live any way we
[26:19] want to live and name the name of the
[26:21] Lord and be righteous in his eyes what
[26:24] makes us think that we can get into bed
[26:27] with the world and and live like the
[26:30] world and dress like the world and smell
[26:32] like the world and and and be rotten
[26:35] like the world and still be the children
[26:38] of God I hear the spirit of God saying
[26:41] come out of her and be separate sayith
[26:44] the Lord God is looking for a people who
[26:47] will no longer partake in her sin in the
[26:52] sins of the world in the things of this
[26:55] life but those who will be holy before
[26:58] him we can't do it by ourselves our
[27:00] works are not enough we have to draw
[27:04] from the righteousness of God I want to
[27:06] pray for you right now father I'm asking
