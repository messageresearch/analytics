[0:00] the greatest battle ever fought is
[0:02] fought on the Battlefield of the Mind
[0:05] it's the last battle for the
[0:08] bride when we come to the victory in
[0:11] this we have finished the testing period
[0:14] we have finished the proving period when
[0:17] we learn to think the thoughts of Christ
[0:20] and cancel the enemy's accusations we
[0:24] have overcome the last battle of our of
[0:27] our life it's over then and we step out
[0:30] of here not going anywhere until we can
[0:34] possess the thoughts of our own
[0:36] mind you're not going to be raptured
[0:39] until you can win the
[0:41] battle come on of your mind if the enemy
[0:46] can press a thought into your mind to
[0:50] take you
[0:52] out that's exactly what he will do but I
[0:55] tell you he is defeated by the blood of
[0:58] the Lamb by by the power of the revealed
[1:01] word by the name of Jesus Christ he is
[1:04] defeated he has been defeated a long
[1:07] time he is still defeated he'll be
[1:10] defeated
[1:12] tomorrow he'll be defeated when the when
[1:15] he's cast into that bottomless
[1:18] pit and he will ultimately be defeated
[1:22] on the other end of that when he is
[1:24] loosed for a short
[1:26] season the reality is he is a creator
[1:29] ated
[1:31] being who does not have eternal
[1:35] life I'm going to outlive the
[1:39] [Music]
[1:40] devil sir I'm going to outlive the
[1:44] enemy because I have grabbed a hold of
[1:48] Zoe
[1:50] life the life of God the only soul that
[1:55] live lives forever is the soul that has
[1:59] been possessed
[2:00] by the zoy life of God the enemy knows
[2:04] that and so he can't change your
[2:07] destiny so he seeks to affect your
[2:11] relationship he seeks to cut off your
[2:14] fellowship from
[2:16] God he seeks to Circle you off like a
[2:19] weaker part of the
[2:22] fold if the enemy can separate you from
[2:25] the rest of the
[2:28] sheep you're a whole lot more vulnerable
[2:30] out there that enemy will oppress you
[2:33] and oppress you and oppress you while
[2:35] looking for an
[2:37] opportunity to take you
[2:40] over he'll never be satisfied giving you
[2:44] the
[2:46] jerks he'll Trail you and track you and
[2:49] hunt
[2:50] you and somebody said well is there an
[2:53] answer it's so simple yes there's an
[2:55] answer
[2:57] greater greater
[3:00] greater is he that is in
[3:06] me than he that is in the world yes has
[3:10] anybody ever
[3:12] experienced something from the
[3:15] outside a spiritual
[3:18] Force Desiring to press you down to
[3:23] confine you listen to me now to confine
[3:27] you he doesn't only want to confine you
[3:30] he wants to redefine
[3:33] you he wants to cause you to lose your
[3:36] true
[3:36] identity until you don't even know who
[3:39] you
[3:42] are it's a heart issue and if you can
[3:45] win the issue in your heart if you can
[3:49] surrender in the heart God will give you
[3:52] the victory over the
[3:54] pressure
[3:57] you you may not realize it but you were
[4:00] built to withstand the pressure of leod
[4:04] deia you didn't come to Philadelphia you
[4:07] didn't come to thyra you didn't come to
[4:10] Smyrna you came to leod deia because God
[4:13] had pressurized you
