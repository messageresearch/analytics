[0:00] if Jesus was God the word made flesh and
[0:04] if he was not
[0:07] perfected by his identity as God but
[0:11] rather the scripture said he was
[0:13] perfected by the things that he suffered
[0:18] though he were tempted in all manner
[0:21] like we are yet without
[0:24] sin the suffering is what brought him to
[0:28] the total surrender I believe it was
[0:31] beginning in the baptism when the voice
[0:33] said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm
[0:36] pleased to dwell
[0:39] in and it and the full adoption was
[0:42] announced
[0:43] when Mount of
[0:45] transfiguration when the voice said
[0:48] what hear
[0:51] him this is my son hear him hear what he
[0:57] has to say he has reached that place of
[1:01] total adoption somebody said I don't get
[1:04] why God did it that way you should he
[1:07] did it that way for you he did it that
[1:10] way for me so that we could see that
[1:14] being reduced to flesh condescending to
[1:17] a fleshly body with a middle ground a
[1:21] soul is a complicated process you were
[1:25] first a thought in the mind of God Amen
[1:28] but you couldn't be be all that you were
[1:31] as a thought floating around in his head
[1:34] you had to become a word it's not the
[1:38] the original
[1:39] thoughts that become the Original
[1:43] Seed but it's the original word it has
[1:46] to be
[1:47] spoken and what did he say about a
[1:50] thought a word is a thought expressed so
[1:54] that's who you were you were in the mind
[1:56] of God as a thought but In God's Time
[2:00] at his choosing we didn't get to choose
[2:03] when we came we didn't get to say hey
[2:05] I'll go in Ephesus or I'll go in thyra
[2:09] or I'll go in pergamus he
[2:12] chose I'm glad he did it means he knew
[2:16] more about us than we would know about
[2:18] ourselves and he sent us it's not a
[2:21] mistake I want you to know tonight it's
[2:24] not a mistake that you came to leod
[2:27] deia you are here by God 's choosing he
[2:31] chose the age for you to be in and he
[2:34] knew that everything you would need to
[2:37] overcome in this age would be provided
[2:41] for you when you got here this beautiful
[2:46] plan is
[2:50] rigged it's rigged in your
[2:54] favor because everything that he
[2:56] requires out of us he
[3:00] provides does that sound like somebody
[3:03] who wanted you to go to hell it sounds
[3:05] to me like somebody who wanted you to
[3:08] win and so he gave you everything you
[3:11] need by the revealed word of the hour to
[3:14] make a Rapture
[3:16] already we're not waiting on another
[3:19] deposit to be ready we're Desiring the
[3:23] stirring as brother brandom explained
[3:25] we're Desiring the stirring of what
[3:27] God's already poured into us not one
[3:30] drop of water was added to the Great
[3:33] Lake but when that wind began to blow
[3:36] and those waves began to stir he said
[3:39] there was a mighty Revival taking place
[3:42] out there on the water without the
[3:44] addition of anything and that's the
[3:47] reality that you and I are walking in
[3:48] the gene of God in you his seed in you
[3:51] is more than enough to help you get out
[3:55] of here so your struggle is not your
[3:58] physical body as some describe nor is it
[4:02] the innermost being the spirit the
[4:04] inside of the inside it's in that middle
[4:07] ground where the will kicks in where the
[4:11] thoughts produce the
[4:14] war and where the emotions
[4:18] complicate
[4:20] everything your soul is not your enemy
[4:24] your flesh body is not your enemy The
[4:27] Devil is the one working the life Li
[4:31] hello the accuser the father of All Eyes
[4:34] he's the one that's and look the reality
[4:37] is he knows that he can't change your
[4:41] predestination he can't change your
[4:43] election you were chosen elected sent
[4:46] here for such a time as this and Satan
[4:49] can't change that but what he can do is
[4:52] stir up the middle ground
