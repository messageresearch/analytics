Description:
Why would you choose to live in the basement of accusation, of discord and woundedness, when you can have ‘Zoe’, the very Life of God, the Great Comforter and Advocate, living inside of you?  You’ll receive the power, you’ll receive the ammunition you need to shut down the accuser.  That is what the Bride of Jesus Christ has been called too.  We are to be the expression of the DNA, the very genes of the Living God.
