[1:05:14] glad to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:05:16] morning you you seem a little tired but
[1:05:19] I believe that the Lord will uh
[1:05:22] certainly give you an IV if you're in
[1:05:25] need of one today just grab a hold of
[1:05:27] him and he will revive us and
[1:05:30] resuscitate us and restore us and uh my
[1:05:35] voice is a little little shaky but I
[1:05:37] know that the Lord will help us uh today
[1:05:40] because we're gathered here by a Divine
[1:05:43] appointment we're here because he called
[1:05:46] us here amen would you turn in your
[1:05:49] Bible if you have it with you uh again
[1:05:52] to the Book of John chapter
[1:05:56] 15 and I want to read this morning again
[1:06:01] beginning in verse one all the way to
[1:06:05] verse 7 I want those of you who were uh
[1:06:09] here last night to know that thank you
[1:06:13] so much for pulling on the word and your
[1:06:16] faith and how that you let the Lord come
[1:06:20] and meet you at the end of the service
[1:06:22] and I believe God did something for
[1:06:24] somebody's
[1:06:25] more than one and I know that he did
[1:06:28] something for me he did somebody said I
[1:06:31] was so blessed I said I was too there's
[1:06:34] nothing like his
[1:06:36] presence we need that daily
[1:06:40] connect with his presence is that
[1:06:44] right I want to say before we read the
[1:06:47] scripture God bless you to all of you
[1:06:50] who are streaming this service around
[1:06:53] the world and uh we just appreciate it
[1:06:57] uh someone said I'm listening from the
[1:06:59] road in Iowa today God bless you brother
[1:07:03] writers in South Africa Cape Town uh the
[1:07:08] the van hoodens in the Netherlands and
[1:07:11] uh Indiana Kenya God bless you and uh
[1:07:15] sometimes we don't know where you're
[1:07:17] from if you don't tell us but God bless
[1:07:20] every one of you who are tuned in with
[1:07:22] us through the stream today what a
[1:07:24] blessing it is that we have this
[1:07:26] connection Jesus said I am the True Vine
[1:07:32] and my father is the husbandman let
[1:07:36] there be no uh uh
[1:07:39] misunderstanding about who holds the
[1:07:43] pruning
[1:07:44] shears it is the eternal spirit of God
[1:07:49] God is the one who does the pruning God
[1:07:52] is the one who separates the unfruitful
[1:07:55] full Vine from the branch every branch
[1:07:59] in me that beareth not fruit he the
[1:08:03] father taketh away and every branch that
[1:08:08] beareth fruit he purgeth it or prth it
[1:08:12] that it may bring
[1:08:14] forth more fruit praise God now ye are
[1:08:19] clean through the word which I have
[1:08:22] spoken unto you and as sister Emily sang
[1:08:26] to us so beautifully today Jesus said
[1:08:31] abide in
[1:08:34] me and
[1:08:37] I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:08:43] of
[1:08:44] itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:08:49] more can ye except ye read it
[1:08:57] abide in
[1:09:00] me I am the
[1:09:03] vine ye are the
[1:09:05] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:09:09] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:09:14] for without me I like this so much
[1:09:19] without me you can do nothing nothing
[1:09:26] again let there be no dispute without
[1:09:29] him I can't do anything that's with him
[1:09:33] I can do everything whatever he needs me
[1:09:35] to do I can do it if a man abide not in
[1:09:39] me he is cast forth as a branch and is
[1:09:45] withered if you
[1:09:47] separate a branch from its Life
[1:09:51] Source it won't take long and every leaf
[1:09:55] will wither and all the life sap is gone
[1:09:59] and you'll find it ready to be thrown
[1:10:02] into the fire he says it's withered and
[1:10:05] Men gather them cast them into the fire
[1:10:08] and they are burned they're they're
[1:10:10] really good for nothing
[1:10:11] else he said if ye
[1:10:16] abide in me it it must not be
[1:10:21] automatic because if it was an automatic
[1:10:24] transaction there would be no necessity
[1:10:26] for an if but since it is not an
[1:10:31] automatic transaction there is an if
[1:10:34] involved and the if is a matter of your
[1:10:38] conscious
[1:10:41] decision the if is a matter of your
[1:10:46] will you've got to will it
[1:10:49] today and you may have to will it again
[1:10:52] this

[1:11:30] not enough demons to keep me from my
[1:11:33] place at the homecoming
[1:11:35] table because he saw me
[1:11:38] there before the foundations of the
[1:11:42] world were
[1:11:44] laid and so they huff and puff and they
[1:11:47] try to blow down the house but they're
[1:11:50] just
[1:11:51] liars like their father amen am am Jesus
[1:11:57] said if ye abide in me a conscious
[1:12:01] decision today this afternoon
[1:12:04] tomorrow when I wake up this morning in
[1:12:06] the morning I need to have that kind of
[1:12:09] a thought in my mind today
[1:12:12] Lord I want to abide in you I want your
[1:12:16] words abiding in me I don't want there
[1:12:20] to be any
[1:12:22] disconnect
[1:12:24] hello you shall ask if ye abide in me
[1:12:28] and my words abide in you ye shall
[1:12:34] ask now now you need to understand that
[1:12:37] if his words are abiding in you you're
[1:12:40] going to
[1:12:41] ask according to the
[1:12:45] word you're not going to ask to consume
[1:12:48] it of your own selfish
[1:12:50] lust you're not going to say something
[1:12:52] stupid like uh uh you know I want to win
[1:12:56] the
[1:12:58] lottery oh it's
[1:13:03] quiet it's been a while but many years
[1:13:06] ago there used to be a lottery ticket or
[1:13:08] two dropped in the offering and you're
[1:13:10] always wondering who who who bought
[1:13:14] it well we just toss them we wouldn't
[1:13:17] know what to do with them I'm not going
[1:13:18] to watch out for the lottery I I we used
[1:13:22] to have a a racetrack Greyhound track
[1:13:26] and they tell me Christian people is
[1:13:29] what kept it going as long as it as it
[1:13:31] was go oh my
[1:13:33] goodness you you're looking in the wrong
[1:13:36] direction oh Lord I want a million
[1:13:38] dollars well you you may get it if God
[1:13:41] wills it to be so but what you're going
[1:13:44] to be asking for if the word abides in
[1:13:47] you is your daily
[1:13:51] bread according to your riches and and
[1:13:53] I'll tell you God will allow you just
[1:13:56] what he can trust you with if ye abide
[1:13:59] in me and my words abide in you you
[1:14:03] shall
[1:14:06] ask oh I've got more attention with you
[1:14:10] standing we may be on to
[1:14:13] something if my words abide in
[1:14:17] you you shall
[1:14:20] ask what you will not to consume it of
[1:14:23] your own lusts but but according to the
[1:14:26] word that dwells in you and what did
[1:14:28] Jesus
[1:14:31] say and it shall be done unto you do you
[1:14:37] believe that father we
[1:14:40] believe we're gathered today we are
[1:14:44] Bonafide
[1:14:46] Believers Lord I ask this group of
[1:14:49] people do you believe this and they
[1:14:52] testified with their mouth yes I believe
[1:14:55] believe that then Lord show us how to
[1:14:59] abide in you show us how to make sure
[1:15:04] that your words are abiding in us so
[1:15:08] that when we pray we pray according to
[1:15:12] the will of God and we see the results
[1:15:17] of the blank check that you have already
[1:15:20] signed on our behalf and we will give
[1:15:24] you glory and honor and praise Lord dry
[1:15:28] back the
[1:15:30] distracting and weary spirits of the
[1:15:34] enemy and may we find strength today to
[1:15:39] receive from your word and we'll give
[1:15:42] you praise honor and glory for it's in
[1:15:44] the name exalted above every name the
[1:15:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:15:50] and the Saints
[1:15:51] said I want you to do something
[1:15:54] different I want you to shake somebody's
[1:15:56] hand or fist bump them if you're afraid
[1:15:58] of germs cuz you know no germ can
[1:16:01] transfer your to your
[1:16:03] fist I'm kidding it's only your open
[1:16:05] hand no no no it's either God bless you
[1:16:09] and then be
[1:16:12] seated part
[1:16:15] two
[1:16:17] disconnection the
[1:16:19] life has been
[1:16:22] severed we talked about
[1:16:25] this
[1:16:28] expression I I don't remember hearing it
[1:16:31] much as a child or a
[1:16:35] teenager but in the last
[1:16:38] years we hear of
[1:16:42] this
[1:16:44] emotional
[1:16:46] condition of
[1:16:48] feeling
[1:16:50] disconnected I'm sure that we
[1:16:53] experienced it then we just didn't know
[1:16:55] what to call
[1:16:57] it because we didn't understand what
[1:17:00] Wireless
[1:17:03] means you know I I I had one of the
[1:17:07] first cellular
[1:17:10] phones but it had a
[1:17:14] cord the
[1:17:16] handset was connected to the
[1:17:20] receiver by a
[1:17:23] cord even if it wasn't completely
[1:17:27] cordless now we just answer the phone
[1:17:30] and keep riding down the road so maybe
[1:17:33] we just didn't know what to call it back
[1:17:36] then but all of us have experienced a
[1:17:40] moment of suddenly feeling
[1:17:43] alone in a crowd of
[1:17:46] people so many good things happening
[1:17:49] around you and you feel like you're
[1:17:52] standing on the outside of your own life
[1:17:55] life looking
[1:17:58] in it can happen to
[1:18:01] anyone but it's particularly
[1:18:04] disheartening when it happens to a
[1:18:07] Christian then it is more than just a
[1:18:12] disconnect
[1:18:14] socially or a emotional sort of thing it
[1:18:20] becomes a
[1:18:21] spiritual
[1:18:23] condition and to feel that God is a
[1:18:26] million miles away or to feel that when
[1:18:30] you pray he is
[1:18:33] silent and every time I use that
[1:18:36] expression silent I I'm sorry for where
[1:18:39] my mind goes maybe it's something you
[1:18:41] you can't relate to but my mind goes
[1:18:44] always to Jonah
[1:18:46] Arc because she was led by visions and
[1:18:52] experiences and when she was arrested
[1:18:57] and ready to
[1:19:00] die she found
[1:19:03] herself
[1:19:06] disconnected you remember from the
[1:19:09] ingred Bergman movie as that right is
[1:19:11] that who it
[1:19:12] was you will remember that when she
[1:19:16] knelt to pray where were the
[1:19:20] voices that had inspired her to lead the
[1:19:24] French
[1:19:25] Revolution
[1:19:27] silent where were the
[1:19:29] Visions there were
[1:19:31] none where was God when she needed him
[1:19:36] the most and in
[1:19:38] anguish she cried
[1:19:41] out so
[1:19:43] mistreated
[1:19:45] brutalized raped by
[1:19:49] guards really feeling
[1:19:53] forsaken but when she needed his
[1:19:56] strength the
[1:19:57] most he comforted her all the way
[1:20:02] through her
[1:20:03] death where was he when she needed a
[1:20:06] vision where was she when she needed to
[1:20:09] hear a voice where was she when she
[1:20:11] needed Le where was he when she needed
[1:20:14] leadership he was
[1:20:17] always right
[1:20:20] there there are times that we don't feel
[1:20:25] him but we must remember he hasn't
[1:20:28] changed his
[1:20:30] proximity he's still right
[1:20:33] there again as close as the mention of
[1:20:38] his name I don't like it when we have
[1:20:41] this tendency to to put it on
[1:20:45] God as though he is failing Us in some
[1:20:51] way I don't know about you but I would
[1:20:53] rather accept
[1:20:55] all
[1:20:57] responsibility than to allow my mind to
[1:21:00] attribute any
[1:21:02] blame to my
[1:21:04] Creator because to be honest he's just
[1:21:06] been too
[1:21:08] good I don't want anybody to think that
[1:21:11] he's not what he says he is because he
[1:21:14] is and I've got a feeling that if
[1:21:17] there's any responsibility it's it's on
[1:21:20] me because somewhere down the line I
[1:21:23] have hung the
[1:21:25] phone I have cut myself off I didn't
[1:21:30] heed the advice of the word that that
[1:21:34] tells me when I when I feel alone when I
[1:21:38] feel brokenhearted then I pour my heart
[1:21:42] out to you and you draw near to me you
[1:21:46] are near to those with a broken and a
[1:21:49] contrite spirit is that the word but we
[1:21:53] forget get that
[1:21:55] sometime a and we have a tendency to
[1:21:59] judge a a a dark place in our life by
[1:22:04] how we feel but feelings are are are
[1:22:08] fickle and they come and they
[1:22:12] go has anybody ever woke up in a good
[1:22:16] mood a uh you know you the bluebird some
[1:22:19] of you won't won't
[1:22:21] remember but the bluebird is singing on
[1:22:23] your shoulder
[1:22:29] some of you have never seen it because
[1:22:32] we live in a woke
[1:22:35] society and you'll never get to see the
[1:22:37] old film Song of the
[1:22:40] South but some of us
[1:22:42] remember Mr
[1:22:45] Bluebird singing on our
[1:22:48] shoulder seems like the butterflies are
[1:22:51] are fluttering around and and the grass
[1:22:54] is Greener and the sky is Bluer and life
[1:22:58] couldn't get any better and
[1:23:02] suddenly Bluebird is gone and blue skies
[1:23:06] are gone and and gray skies have repl
[1:23:10] and you go from feeling like you're on
[1:23:13] top of the
[1:23:15] world until now you are underneath the
[1:23:19] weight of the world it can happen in a
[1:23:23] moment our feelings can change but the
[1:23:28] reality Remains the Same we serve an
[1:23:32] ontime
[1:23:33] God who knows who cares who understands
[1:23:39] he doesn't look at you with condemnation
[1:23:42] in his heart he doesn't look at you with
[1:23:45] judge even when we are wrong that's
[1:23:49] right even when we have failed even when
[1:23:52] we have rebelled even when we have
[1:23:55] refused to
[1:23:58] obey he loves
[1:24:01] us his love his care his concern his
[1:24:05] provision is not based on our
[1:24:09] performance it's not based on our
[1:24:13] Behavior it's not even based on whether
[1:24:16] or not we get the uniform just
[1:24:23] right he loves us right where we
[1:24:27] are but if you're not in a good place he
[1:24:32] loves you so much that he doesn't want
[1:24:35] to leave
[1:24:38] you in that bad
[1:24:40] place he will always extend a hand of
[1:24:46] mercy of compassion of
[1:24:49] help one of the greatest scenes in the
[1:24:54] the the film series The Chosen and I
[1:24:58] know there will always be fault
[1:25:02] finders because there will always be
[1:25:05] something to
[1:25:09] find you know if if somebody could make
[1:25:12] a series you know just like brother
[1:25:14] brandom described
[1:25:17] it we might all be
[1:25:21] happy but even that's open to interpret
[1:25:24] ation at times but but they don't know
[1:25:27] what you
[1:25:28] know and so they do it according to
[1:25:31] their
[1:25:33] inspiration some people just threw out
[1:25:36] the whole concept of the passion movie
[1:25:38] because it was so Catholic and it
[1:25:42] was but it didn't change the
[1:25:46] impact for me
[1:25:48] anyway of seeing visually a
[1:25:52] representation of his
[1:25:55] suffering and I don't know about you
[1:25:57] it's been a long time ago but I felt
[1:26:01] like it was all my
[1:26:04] fault it was made so
[1:26:08] real that I took responsibility in that
[1:26:13] moment and realized my
[1:26:16] sin is what put in there in in the
[1:26:20] chosen there will be some things that
[1:26:22] you know that may be add or take you
[1:26:25] know a poetic
[1:26:28] light but I've been blessed
[1:26:31] anyway my
[1:26:34] favorite character is
[1:26:38] Peter he has short person
[1:26:45] syndrome that's why he has to have such
[1:26:48] amazing
[1:26:50] biceps it's because he's compensating
[1:26:55] for being so
[1:26:57] short he has a short stature and a short
[1:27:02] fuse but nobody should
[1:27:07] doubt that he is the kind of
[1:27:11] friend you want to
[1:27:14] have Jesus was
[1:27:19] blessed to have a friend like Peter now
[1:27:22] Peter was more blessed
[1:27:26] if you had a friend even with short
[1:27:29] people's syndrome like I do sometime I
[1:27:31] have some you're
[1:27:34] blessed because they can be true
[1:27:38] blue Peter is full of fear he is full of
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:45] insecurity he's full of
[1:27:48] guilt he's full of so much that is not
[1:27:52] light it's dark
[1:27:54] and yet he has come to a place of not
[1:27:58] being able to not
[1:28:01] believe Jesus made it so
[1:28:06] real there was no room for
[1:28:09] doubt it became so real to him and in
[1:28:14] that moment that he is out on the
[1:28:18] sea and the wind is blowing and the
[1:28:22] waves are dashing
[1:28:24] yes my favorite
[1:28:28] scene I watched a clip of how it was
[1:28:30] even made that that really fascinated
[1:28:36] me Jesus comes to him on the
[1:28:40] water and Peter no one else said I'd
[1:28:44] like to get out there where you
[1:28:46] are just
[1:28:50] shorty you know no I'd like to do what
[1:28:52] you're doing
[1:28:54] I'd like to be out there come
[1:28:57] on and and I wonder how many of us would
[1:29:00] have said no no I'm just
[1:29:03] kidding but Peter did what everybody has
[1:29:06] to do he made a decision to get out of
[1:29:08] the
[1:29:09] boat somebody said it didn't turn out
[1:29:11] too good for him it turned out wonderful
[1:29:13] for him because he learned that day that
[1:29:17] his strength was not in his
[1:29:19] bicep his strength was in his
[1:29:22] relationship
[1:29:24] with the one who had been revealed to
[1:29:28] him who do you say I am Thou Art the
[1:29:32] Messiah the Messiah the anointed one the
[1:29:36] son of the most high God blessed art
[1:29:39] thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[1:29:42] have not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:29:44] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[1:29:46] thee that thou art
[1:29:48] Peter and Upon This Rock not short
[1:29:52] person
[1:29:54] with big
[1:29:57] bicep but on this
[1:30:01] Revelation I will build my
[1:30:05] church and the gates of hell they will
[1:30:09] March they will howl they will rattle
[1:30:13] against it but they will not
[1:30:18] Prevail against it and Peter sinks
[1:30:24] because he gets his
[1:30:26] eyes this is your
[1:30:33] disconnect when Peter stepped out Jesus
[1:30:36] didn't turn around and head for the
[1:30:38] shore he stayed right there to watch
[1:30:41] over it
[1:30:42] all Peter's doing good you know you do
[1:30:45] you do you do how many of you have ever
[1:30:47] done good for a
[1:30:50] while
[1:30:52] well it's not so hard after
[1:30:55] all and then the
[1:31:01] distractions somebody said I want to Min
[1:31:04] are you hearing me
[1:31:06] today I want to minimalize the
[1:31:08] distractions in my life oh you
[1:31:13] do you carry most of them in your
[1:31:17] hand for somebody that keeps saying I'd
[1:31:20] like to minimalize the distractions in
[1:31:23] my life
[1:31:24] life somebody said well preacher seems
[1:31:27] to me like you always have yours in your
[1:31:29] hand I really have very little
[1:31:34] choice because that's how you reach
[1:31:38] out but there are
[1:31:41] times let me tell you something if I
[1:31:44] leave mine in the
[1:31:46] chair to go to the
[1:31:51] bathroom when I get back to the chair
[1:31:54] there will not only be a text but it
[1:31:56] will say well are you there dot dot
[1:32:04] dot you must be busy dot dot dot come on
[1:32:10] it's how people reach out but if I was a
[1:32:13] person who said I want to minimalize
[1:32:15] distraction in my life I believe what I
[1:32:18] would do is disconnect
[1:32:21] myself from some of the R
[1:32:25] ractions do you really have to have them
[1:32:30] all oh it's so
[1:32:34] quiet you know some quiets disturb
[1:32:38] me and some quiets bless me and that
[1:32:43] quiet blessed me because I knew I was on
[1:32:47] the
[1:32:49] trail do you really have to have
[1:32:52] Facebook
[1:32:54] Instagram Twitter oh no
[1:33:00] X
[1:33:03] Snapchat Tick
[1:33:08] Tock what's the one where everybody
[1:33:11] stops and takes a picture at the same
[1:33:13] time you know be
[1:33:16] real oh please I hope you don't think
[1:33:20] you're being
[1:33:22] real that's not real I want to tell you
[1:33:25] it's not being real now I want to say
[1:33:27] Emily you're if she were on I'm not on I
[1:33:29] don't know if she's on but she would be
[1:33:33] real because that's the kind of
[1:33:35] photographer she
[1:33:37] is but I've been with people on the be
[1:33:40] real and they take it three
[1:33:44] times to get the chin
[1:33:49] right I I'm going to be honest there
[1:33:52] sometimes I I I mean I say look please
[1:33:54] don't post that
[1:33:55] one there I I I don't know that I have a
[1:33:58] good side but surely there's got to be
[1:34:00] something better than that
[1:34:01] one you see you don't really have to
[1:34:04] have them
[1:34:08] all I might miss some you don't have to
[1:34:11] see every
[1:34:12] reel you don't have to follow every
[1:34:15] Rabbit Hole every Rabbit Trail come on
[1:34:18] now if you really want to minimalize
[1:34:21] distractions you've got to make up your
[1:34:22] mind to do it and do it
[1:34:28] right just a minute Amen
[1:34:31] brother none of it is wrong in itself
[1:34:35] but if it's distracting you from what
[1:34:37] really
[1:34:38] matters and that would you're the only
[1:34:41] one who
[1:34:42] knows CU you may discipline
[1:34:45] yourself you may really have it under
[1:34:48] control so if that doesn't distract you
[1:34:51] the enemy will find something else
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] he'll he'll addict you to busting
[1:35:00] Bubbles and crushing
[1:35:06] candies and
[1:35:08] monopolies go and help me out
[1:35:13] somebody what's that give me another
[1:35:16] one what
[1:35:20] Solitude on and on and on if that's not
[1:35:23] what there'll be something else oh it's
[1:35:28] quiet in other words you are
[1:35:32] disconnected not because he
[1:35:35] moved but like Peter we get our eyes on
[1:35:40] that that flashes and
[1:35:44] moves and changes around us and when
[1:35:48] Peter took his eyes off the one that
[1:35:51] made sure he stayed on top of of the
[1:35:54] water he began to sink is that right and
[1:35:59] you and I do the same yes we may never
[1:36:02] change the way we talk about him but our
[1:36:06] relationship our fellowship with him has
[1:36:11] changed and now it's about this or it's
[1:36:14] about that or it's about the other and
[1:36:16] we start going
[1:36:17] under slowly slowly slowly slowly
[1:36:22] slowly and Jes Jesus reaches out his
[1:36:26] hand Peter takes a hold of the Lord and
[1:36:29] and he he's immediately back on top of
[1:36:32] things I like this part the
[1:36:35] best Jesus starts him toward the
[1:36:39] boat you may not read it like that in
[1:36:41] the
[1:36:42] gospels but I got a feeling that Peter
[1:36:45] once he had a hold of
[1:36:48] him he had a hard time turning him
[1:36:51] loose anybody with me
[1:36:54] and when he I wished I had it I would
[1:36:56] just play it for you this morning give
[1:36:58] some critic something else to criticize
[1:37:00] us
[1:37:02] for when he walked him back to the boat
[1:37:05] and Peter grown man grown man with
[1:37:08] pretty good biceps grown
[1:37:11] man he's crying out hom me don't let me
[1:37:16] go don't let me go don't let me go
[1:37:21] that's the Cry of the rescue
[1:37:25] that's the Cry of the saved of the
[1:37:28] redeemed of those who know what it's
[1:37:30] like to
[1:37:32] sink and they know what it's like to be
[1:37:36] saved to be
[1:37:39] rescued and their cry it's not just walk
[1:37:42] me back to the boat help me get back up
[1:37:45] on top it's don't let me go don't let me
[1:37:49] go
[1:37:53] don't let me
[1:37:56] go so it's never the
[1:38:00] Lord who disconnects from
[1:38:03] us no no no I'm okay don't call the
[1:38:07] don't call the
[1:38:08] emergency I did not
[1:38:11] fall it's never his
[1:38:15] fault it's always something in us that
[1:38:19] we need to
[1:38:21] see he never hang
[1:38:24] up he
[1:38:26] never tries to
[1:38:29] play hide and seek as some preachers
[1:38:34] seem to describe this game of hide and
[1:38:39] seek that may be the experience of
[1:38:41] church
[1:38:42] anity but there is no hide and seek in
[1:38:45] the bride he doesn't want to play with
[1:38:48] your
[1:38:50] emotions he's not trying to play with
[1:38:52] you and show you who's boss he's always
[1:38:56] there what he is trying to do is help us
[1:38:59] to know we don't live by
[1:39:02] feelings we don't live by great
[1:39:05] surfaces we don't live by prayer lines
[1:39:08] only we live by faith we don't live by
[1:39:13] Goosebumps
[1:39:15] Sensations we don't live by dancing in
[1:39:18] the
[1:39:19] spirit we live by faith faith in the
[1:39:24] word if we get to dance praise God if we
[1:39:28] get a chill bump
[1:39:30] Hallelujah if the hair stands up on our
[1:39:33] arms praise be to God it's good to feel
[1:39:36] the Lord but we're not
[1:39:39] living by Feeling by by an experience
[1:39:43] we've had we must live by faith and
[1:39:48] there are
[1:39:49] times that we go through that are godd
[1:39:52] designed
[1:39:55] that we don't feel what we have
[1:39:58] felt and God is trying to train
[1:40:02] us yes not punish us train us that this
[1:40:08] is by
[1:40:09] faith you see brother brandom realized
[1:40:12] that that the prayer
[1:40:14] lines and the prayer cards would not
[1:40:18] always
[1:40:21] work it took more and more out of his
[1:40:26] physical
[1:40:27] stamina he got weaker and weaker as the
[1:40:30] Visions
[1:40:32] opened and he had a harder time shutting
[1:40:35] them
[1:40:37] down so weary in Mak Georgia that he was
[1:40:42] standing uh barely one leg one leg
[1:40:48] sinking and only one knee one leg
[1:40:51] holding him up he's sinking like a
[1:40:55] rag dish rag as he prayed for the last
[1:41:00] one brother Billy Paul comes and Taps
[1:41:05] him on the
[1:41:06] sides sister Wes's dad was the sponsor
[1:41:11] of that meeting in
[1:41:14] mon Brother Cleveland who witnessed to
[1:41:18] me was in the
[1:41:21] meeting tapped brother brandom on the
[1:41:24] side as a signal that had been
[1:41:28] pre-arranged that it's
[1:41:31] enough and he starts backing brother
[1:41:35] brandom up off the
[1:41:39] platform he's prayed for as many as he
[1:41:43] can physically ministered individually
[1:41:46] ministered to as many as he possibly
[1:41:49] could and yet there were hundreds more
[1:41:51] that had needs
[1:41:53] you see what that opens
[1:41:55] up and even human compassion would
[1:42:00] compel
[1:42:01] him to do more than he had physical
[1:42:04] stamina and strength to do could God not
[1:42:07] have strengthened him absolutely but God
[1:42:09] wanted brother brandom to know what you
[1:42:11] and I need to
[1:42:13] know your strength is totally dependent
[1:42:16] on
[1:42:17] him and when it's done it's done when
[1:42:20] God says that's enough it's enough but
[1:42:23] just about the time they start him down
[1:42:26] the step because it's moved to the
[1:42:28] stadium now out of the out of the uh uh
[1:42:32] the Civic Center whatever the building
[1:42:34] I've been there whatever the building is
[1:42:36] there in in mon they've moved out to the
[1:42:39] ball field now and the platform is
[1:42:41] sitting out on the
[1:42:43] green they're taking him down and
[1:42:45] brother brandham
[1:42:47] stops and he
[1:42:50] stiffens like a log
[1:42:53] and he says
[1:42:55] wait just one
[1:43:00] more somebody's little faith a little
[1:43:05] child sitting in the
[1:43:08] audience with Twisted
[1:43:11] feet about two or three rows from the
[1:43:15] front so close and not in the prayer
[1:43:20] line he saw a moment of Vision that
[1:43:24] little child
[1:43:26] running with those crippled
[1:43:29] feet he speaks to the
[1:43:32] parent there's actually a little box of
[1:43:34] shoes
[1:43:36] there that have never fit those deformed
[1:43:42] feet do you
[1:43:45] believe the mom or dad said
[1:43:48] yes we
[1:43:50] believe little child not its head and
[1:43:55] brother brandham says
[1:43:58] Satan turn it
[1:44:01] loose I don't remember if it was a boy
[1:44:03] or a
[1:44:05] girl and when he said
[1:44:08] that brother Cleveland was sitting just
[1:44:11] a few seats
[1:44:12] over and he said brother
[1:44:15] Shelly I heard those
[1:44:18] bones it sounded like they were on the
[1:44:21] loudspeaker
[1:44:23] as they started popping and
[1:44:25] cracking snap snap snap and I saw those
[1:44:32] feet that were bent back and deformed I
[1:44:38] saw them when they straightened out and
[1:44:41] I saw that little child stand to its
[1:44:44] feet running across the the front of
[1:44:48] that of that field healed by the power
[1:44:52] of God
[1:44:53] Brother Cleveland said I saw F I saw
[1:44:56] chairs folding chairs that people were
[1:44:58] sitting in they began to fly over
[1:44:59] people's
[1:45:00] heads because people began to Rejoice
[1:45:04] because they had seen a miracle well
[1:45:06] brother brandom knew that his strength
[1:45:09] would not always
[1:45:12] last and that there would be more who
[1:45:15] would need prayer and more who would
[1:45:17] need a vision and a discernment and more
[1:45:20] who would need their Miracle sir and so
[1:45:23] he started talking about a new
[1:45:26] ministry he started talking about a new
[1:45:29] demonstration he started talking about
[1:45:32] the power of the creative spoken word
[1:45:36] that would not take the
[1:45:39] strength and the virtue of the vessel
[1:45:42] but it would move in such Authority that
[1:45:45] it wouldn't even be
[1:45:47] necessary
[1:45:49] hello to have a prayer line where a need
[1:45:53] was revealed and a name was called and
[1:45:55] we say oh God we'd like to see that
[1:45:58] again what I would like to
[1:46:01] see is
[1:46:05] you you raise up into the
[1:46:10] manifestation of the Son of God that you
[1:46:13] were created to
[1:46:15] be I don't need to be the
[1:46:19] one I want to see you
[1:46:23] you must be talking to Brothers I'm
[1:46:25] talking to Brothers I'm talking to
[1:46:28] Sisters I'm talking to
[1:46:32] Children I'd like for every one of us to
[1:46:37] rise to that place where we
[1:46:41] win come on now I could have use a
[1:46:44] little help here where we win this mind
[1:46:48] battle where we once and for all realize
[1:46:53] that God hasn't left us or forsaken us
[1:46:56] because we have an off feeling right and
[1:46:58] we just start doing what Sons
[1:47:02] do calling out to Papa I don't feel you
[1:47:06] I don't hear you I don't see you but I
[1:47:10] know that you're
[1:47:12] here you're not only with me you're in
[1:47:16] me and I'm depending on you oh great
[1:47:21] Vine oh John 15
[1:47:24] Vine I'm depending on you for my life
[1:47:38] Source you see everybody's got a
[1:47:41] ministry right they don't all look the
[1:47:45] same and I don't hear anything in this
[1:47:47] man I don't hear I just be honest with
[1:47:49] you I don't hear what some people hear
[1:47:53] I don't even know where they get
[1:47:57] it I can hear the quote they read and
[1:48:01] then wonder where they got
[1:48:03] it because when they talk about it it
[1:48:06] doesn't seem to be saying the same thing
[1:48:09] you see I'm not one of those who
[1:48:10] believes that the full manifestation of
[1:48:13] the third pool was only for the ministry
[1:48:15] of William
[1:48:19] brandom oh no I don't believe that at
[1:48:21] all I believe every Ministry goes
[1:48:25] through those pools you go through those
[1:48:27] Cycles you go through those seasons in
[1:48:30] your life you do you do you do they
[1:48:33] don't look like his mine doesn't look
[1:48:35] like yours yours doesn't look like mine
[1:48:37] but there is es and flows there are
[1:48:40] ordained moments there are ordained
[1:48:43] Seasons there are ordained Cycles in all
[1:48:47] of our lives but the goal is to get us
[1:48:51] to that place where we have
[1:48:55] totally
[1:48:59] surrendered I'm going to
[1:49:02] preach if you don't ever get a
[1:49:07] turkey the goal is to get us to a place
[1:49:10] where we realize who we
[1:49:13] are because of
[1:49:16] who who he
[1:49:20] is no matter how we try we to not do it
[1:49:24] we still keep putting him
[1:49:30] up high in the sky brother GRE we we put
[1:49:34] him there and and and if he wanted to
[1:49:37] dwell there he'd stayed
[1:49:40] there the prophet said he has a
[1:49:42] corporate body somewhere I don't know he
[1:49:44] said it's somewhere in one of these days
[1:49:47] he'll pick it up
[1:49:49] again and he'll come back and receive
[1:49:51] his bride
[1:49:53] but he's not
[1:49:56] bodyless Jesus Oh somebody hear it Jesus
[1:50:00] is not Bess in this hour he's found a
[1:50:05] body he's found a
[1:50:08] body he's found a body he's found a body
[1:50:12] he's found a
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:15] body Hallelujah to live in in this
[1:50:19] hour disconnected
[1:50:23] how do you disconnect from the
[1:50:27] essence of who you
[1:50:31] are we need a
[1:50:34] shaking and we've just had
[1:50:37] one we need some time a big old I don't
[1:50:41] mean to you're already I'm already
[1:50:44] losing some of you I don't want to lose
[1:50:45] the rest of you but sometimes we just
[1:50:48] need a
[1:50:49] slap hallah I wish the Lord would
[1:50:52] release me into that
[1:50:55] Ministry don't you think I'd be good at
[1:50:58] doing it I I I just believe I'd be the
[1:51:01] most anointed slapper the world has ever
[1:51:03] seen
[1:51:05] pow get up from there
[1:51:13] grany I I don't want to brag on myself
[1:51:16] there's nothing here to brag on I can
[1:51:18] assure you of that but I mentioned last
[1:51:20] night that when I met him at 7even years
[1:51:22] old it
[1:51:24] took I can feel people getting tense
[1:51:27] sometime when I say that but I just want
[1:51:29] you to know that it can take it can go
[1:51:33] deep
[1:51:34] enough you see I'm concerned about just
[1:51:38] getting him on your
[1:51:40] feeler because that I want you to know
[1:51:43] when when the going gets tough you start
[1:51:46] feeling the tough stuff you're not
[1:51:48] feeling him anymore sometime so it's not
[1:51:51] enough to have the Spirit on your flesh
[1:51:53] it's not enough to have it in your
[1:51:57] emotion but there is a rubbed in
[1:52:01] anointing there is an anointing that
[1:52:04] goes beyond the flesh beyond the Mind
[1:52:08] beyond the will beyond the
[1:52:10] emotion and totally
[1:52:13] regenerates that inner
[1:52:16] spirit that a man comes here
[1:52:19] with his Fallen human Spirit now totally
[1:52:26] regenerated
[1:52:28] transformed no longer a human Spirit at
[1:52:34] all but now
[1:52:38] occupied by The Same Spirit that's why
[1:52:41] the scripture said the Apostle
[1:52:42] understood it he said the life that I
[1:52:45] now
[1:52:47] live is not my
[1:52:50] life I'm not living by the human spirit
[1:52:53] that I came here with oh hear me
[1:52:56] somebody I'm now living by a new
[1:53:00] spirit I'm living I'm living this is not
[1:53:03] replacement this is this is
[1:53:05] transformation
[1:53:06] regeneration this is God quickening that
[1:53:09] that is dead and Earthly that which is
[1:53:12] not of heaven and and transforming it
[1:53:15] into that which is Heavenly I'm now
[1:53:18] living by another Spirit I'm now living
[1:53:20] by something else there's a life in
[1:53:22] inside of me that my mama didn't give me
[1:53:24] my daddy didn't give me the doctor
[1:53:26] didn't help me get here no no no I'm
[1:53:29] living by something that was birthed in
[1:53:32] Me by the spirit of almighty God and I
[1:53:36] don't have anywhere to go I don't have
[1:53:38] anywhere else to go go back go back go
[1:53:40] back
[1:53:41] where if I go back anywhere it has to be
[1:53:44] to Pentecost so that I can make my way
[1:53:46] all the way back to the
[1:53:49] Garden but how could I ever go back to
[1:53:52] to sin to denominationalism to the
[1:53:56] things that satisfy for a moment and
[1:53:59] leave when when I found him it
[1:54:03] took it changed my
[1:54:05] life he became my
[1:54:08] desire he became the reason I
[1:54:11] live I'm so far from perfect ask my
[1:54:15] family but the reason I
[1:54:18] live is for Jesus as my family
[1:54:24] they'll tell you that I'm not perfect
[1:54:27] but they'll also tell you that I don't
[1:54:30] just do this on
[1:54:32] Sunday and on Tuesday because I know
[1:54:34] you're going to see me this is what I
[1:54:37] have learned to do every well if you had
[1:54:38] to work a public job you wouldn't have
[1:54:40] the opportunity to do that you may use
[1:54:43] that as your excuse but I want you to
[1:54:45] know it'll come up short when you come
[1:54:48] up short when you come up short your
[1:54:51] excuse will come up short
[1:54:53] you can't let that be your reason for
[1:54:55] not fellowshipping with the one the
[1:54:58] reason you were born is to have
[1:54:59] fellowship with
[1:55:02] him who hung up the
[1:55:05] phone somebody said the devil has so
[1:55:09] isolated
[1:55:11] me he has so cut me off there you go
[1:55:16] again making him more
[1:55:19] powerful than the God who lives inside
[1:55:22] of
[1:55:30] you they tell about an old testimony
[1:55:33] service that took place you know we we
[1:55:34] have to be careful with those even
[1:55:36] around
[1:55:40] here because this church is pastored by
[1:55:42] a person who who loves bunny
[1:55:45] trails and my anointing Falls on
[1:55:48] testifiers
[1:55:52] and they get up to testify and that but
[1:55:54] they got three stories going at
[1:55:58] once and and if you've got 50 people on
[1:56:01] a Tuesday night or whatever you have and
[1:56:02] everybody took three minutes you you're
[1:56:04] you're you're sleepy by the time you're
[1:56:05] done you know but anyway they tell me of
[1:56:09] an old testony service this woman got up
[1:56:11] and she was just telling the the whole
[1:56:13] congregation how how the devil had
[1:56:16] treated
[1:56:17] her now the only reason why she would
[1:56:20] take time to do that is because she
[1:56:22] thought she was the only
[1:56:25] one you get to a place sometime where
[1:56:28] your troubles your trials your hardship
[1:56:31] is all you
[1:56:33] see David got there I'm
[1:56:36] preaching David got there and he learned
[1:56:39] his way out and his way out wasn't to
[1:56:42] tell everybody how bad it is his way out
[1:56:45] was to pray for somebody
[1:56:47] else when I was
[1:56:49] afflicted when I was in trouble
[1:56:53] instead of letting it drive
[1:56:56] me I I I Afflicted my own soul with
[1:56:59] fasting in prayer for somebody else and
[1:57:03] guess what happened he said my prayer
[1:57:05] returned to my own bosom isn't that the
[1:57:09] way it works you want out of a a hard
[1:57:11] place pray for somebody
[1:57:14] else amen try to see somebody else's
[1:57:19] struggle intercede for somebody else's
[1:57:21] need
[1:57:23] woo this woman she was just you know he
[1:57:27] the devil has been on my
[1:57:31] back he's been running me around he used
[1:57:34] that old husband of
[1:57:36] mine he cussed me every day this
[1:57:40] week he broke a broom handle over my
[1:57:44] hip
[1:57:47] he this is not prayer request
[1:57:52] gets pretty scary
[1:57:54] too this testimony you just giv God
[1:57:57] praise I mean what are you really saying
[1:58:00] praise the Lord the my husband broke the
[1:58:02] handle of the broom over my hip glory to
[1:58:03] God thank you Jesus
[1:58:06] Hallelujah and she went on and on and on
[1:58:08] and on and on and finally she realized
[1:58:10] that she hadn't said anything to glorify
[1:58:12] God and she sat
[1:58:14] down and there was a about a half saved
[1:58:17] person in the
[1:58:20] back who stood stood up and this was all
[1:58:23] they
[1:58:25] said the devil has been so good to me
[1:58:28] praise His holy
[1:58:29] name and sat
[1:58:36] down I'd never say that that's just what
[1:58:39] she
[1:58:40] said 20 minutes she rattled on at how
[1:58:43] how how what a good job the devil was
[1:58:45] doing in her
[1:58:47] life she didn't say praise His holy name
[1:58:50] but she could have because she had taken
[1:58:53] the moment set aside to give God glory
[1:58:58] for what he's done and used it to edify
[1:59:01] and glorify how good the devil was doing
[1:59:04] his job I need a little help you don't
[1:59:08] need to brag on the
[1:59:11] devil he doesn't need your
[1:59:15] validation he is seeking roaming around
[1:59:19] seeking whom he may devour and as I
[1:59:22] often say he doesn't just want to take a
[1:59:25] a a hunk out of
[1:59:27] you he wants to eat you
[1:59:32] up he's seeking whom he may
[1:59:39] devour but
[1:59:43] greater
[1:59:46] hallu get your eyes off the waves and
[1:59:49] the winds and the storms get your eyes
[1:59:53] off that mean husband of
[1:59:57] yours get your eyes off of aches and
[2:00:01] pains and circumstances and and feelings
[2:00:04] that try to tell you that God doesn't
[2:00:06] even know where you
[2:00:07] are and you begin to remember who you
[2:00:10] are by the promise of the word and you
[2:00:12] begin to use this mouth this is a
[2:00:15] creative mouth God has given
[2:00:18] you you are a creator
[2:00:22] because you came from the great Creator
[2:00:25] and this little bride was given creative
[2:00:27] Authority because of the word that's in
[2:00:30] her
[2:00:31] mouth and if she ever really realized
[2:00:34] who she
[2:00:37] was there's enough Authority in her in
[2:00:41] the word that has been given to her that
[2:00:44] she could speak a word and create a
[2:00:47] world and step out into that world and
[2:00:49] inhabit it well I want you to know
[2:00:52] that's what you have to
[2:00:58] do let me preach to the few of you that
[2:01:00] are listening to
[2:01:01] me that is exactly what you have to do
[2:01:05] you've got to create a world you've got
[2:01:08] to create an environment somewhere that
[2:01:10] you can live
[2:01:13] in you've got to make you a place where
[2:01:16] the
[2:01:17] word is is the
[2:01:19] reality and everything else is lie we
[2:01:23] live in a world now in an atmosphere now
[2:01:26] where the LIE is the reality and the
[2:01:28] woke is the
[2:01:30] reality and the weirdness is a reality
[2:01:33] and the word is the weird thing you
[2:01:36] stand up for the word you're not just a
[2:01:39] Christian you You' got to be a
[2:01:40] fundamentalist you've got to be a
[2:01:42] fanatic you've got to be an
[2:01:45] extremist an Evangelical
[2:01:49] extremist what is that
[2:01:53] deeply
[2:01:55] religious you're labeled listen the
[2:01:58] reason why you don't belong in this
[2:02:02] world this is not your home we're only
[2:02:06] passing through this world and we don't
[2:02:08] have to live in it while we do somebody
[2:02:11] said do you mean we don't have to live
[2:02:12] in it of course we live in it we move
[2:02:14] here we we work here we have oh yes we
[2:02:16] do but let me tell you something that's
[2:02:18] not the reality the prophet told us this
[2:02:21] is the negative that's the
[2:02:26] positive why don't you just make you a
[2:02:28] better world to live in somebody said
[2:02:31] how will I do that by the power of God
[2:02:33] that's in your mouth by the word of God
[2:02:34] that's in your mouth you just start
[2:02:36] coming into
[2:02:38] agreement
[2:02:42] sir this isn't name it and claim it blab
[2:02:45] it and grab
[2:02:46] it this isn't just Word of Faith stuff
[2:02:50] this is bible stuff
[2:02:52] you make up your mind like we sing here
[2:02:55] even when I don't feel him he's working
[2:02:59] even when I don't see him he's working
[2:03:03] uhhuh say it with me even when I don't
[2:03:06] feel him he is
[2:03:08] working even when I can't see
[2:03:19] him if you you abide in me and my words
[2:03:26] abide in
[2:03:28] you you can ask what you
[2:03:32] will the trouble is he tells us last
[2:03:36] night we mentioned the greatest battle
[2:03:38] ever fault the trouble is we're standing
[2:03:39] in here with a lot of Doubt trying to
[2:03:41] accept what's out
[2:03:43] there you've got to stop that and come
[2:03:46] down that
[2:03:47] Channel with the true word of
[2:03:50] God and then it goes out itself
[2:03:52] automatically it's what's on the
[2:03:55] inside oh it starts changing your your
[2:03:58] your environment it starts changing your
[2:04:00] atmosphere it starts changing what
[2:04:02] you've accepted as
[2:04:05] reality the devil is out to get me
[2:04:08] that's
[2:04:10] true but he can't unless I let
[2:04:13] him that's
[2:04:18] true that's true
[2:04:22] did you know that if you have repented
[2:04:26] of your sin and you are not living today
[2:04:31] with
[2:04:33] unconfessed sin the devil has no legal
[2:04:46] right none
[2:04:52] if he does
[2:04:54] anything he does it by
[2:04:58] permission and most of the time you're
[2:05:02] the one who signs the hall
[2:05:04] pass I'm the one who signs the hall
[2:05:09] pass because every time I focus on him
[2:05:12] he says uhhuh yeah see I thought I could
[2:05:14] get I thought I could get his mine yeah
[2:05:16] I thought I could catch her yeah I
[2:05:17] thought I could yeah and look look look
[2:05:19] look look look look what she's focusing
[2:05:20] on now
[2:05:23] look what he's running after now look
[2:05:26] what he's googling
[2:05:27] now and boy when you do that it opens a
[2:05:30] door and that unconfessed sin in your
[2:05:33] life gives the enemy a legal right to
[2:05:38] squat anybody with me are you sure
[2:05:42] you're with me 1 John
[2:05:45] 1:9 if we confess
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:53] somebody said what's that mean tell them
[2:05:55] I got to tell them I got to tell oh
[2:05:58] please I've been in those
[2:06:01] meetings I've been in Pentecost a long
[2:06:03] time I remember those things that would
[2:06:06] come through and conviction would fall
[2:06:08] and people would stand up and start
[2:06:09] confessing their
[2:06:12] sin
[2:06:14] hello wake
[2:06:17] up preaching to you because I love you
[2:06:21] that can get uncomfortable in a
[2:06:26] hurry you see I was only about 22 23
[2:06:29] years
[2:06:31] old the spirit of the Lord comes
[2:06:33] sweeping through the church in
[2:06:37] Columbus I'm not a married
[2:06:40] man but I certainly didn't have my eye
[2:06:43] on
[2:06:45] anybody the spirit of the Lord comes
[2:06:47] sweeping through there and a woman a
[2:06:49] pastor's wife a preacher's wife a
[2:06:51] missionary's wife jumps up in the middle
[2:06:54] of the service and starts confessing her
[2:06:58] sin
[2:07:02] what I didn't know what to do I'm just
[2:07:04] learning here I'm just learning just
[2:07:05] trying to learn what to do with people
[2:07:07] when they start spilling it
[2:07:10] all you think some of our testimony
[2:07:12] Services make you
[2:07:14] nervous and to punctuate everything that
[2:07:17] she had said she ended her testimony by
[2:07:20] this
[2:07:22] and if that's not enough I'm in love
[2:07:25] with brother
[2:07:29] Shelly you were there sister
[2:07:40] Flo you could have knocked me over with
[2:07:42] a
[2:07:46] feather I wanted to die
[2:07:52] there was no part of me attracted to any
[2:07:54] part of
[2:07:57] her she was five kids
[2:08:02] later the thought had never crossed my
[2:08:05] mind she had never acted toward me in an
[2:08:07] unforward way were you there Billy she
[2:08:10] had never acted toward me in an
[2:08:11] unforward way so I don't want that kind
[2:08:13] of
[2:08:17] confession take that one to the altar
[2:08:22] don't stand up and say it out loud and
[2:08:25] my office is not a confession
[2:08:27] Booth there's a Time the scripture said
[2:08:30] we confess our faults one to another but
[2:08:34] not our sins we're not
[2:08:39] Catholic this is confessing it to the
[2:08:42] only
[2:08:43] one if we read it for me would you if
[2:08:48] we he is faithful and
[2:09:11] just
[2:09:13] if there it is again if it's not
[2:09:17] automatic if we confess our sins he
[2:09:24] there's no reason for us to live with
[2:09:27] unconfessed
[2:09:28] sin well I don't want to tell nobody
[2:09:30] don't want to tell nobody don't want to
[2:09:32] tell nobody it's easier if you realize
[2:09:34] you're telling the one who already knows
[2:09:37] it then why do I have to confess it
[2:09:39] because you've got to own it right
[2:09:42] you've got to identify with your
[2:09:45] sacrifice yes yes in the Old Testament
[2:09:48] the sin was symbolically transferred
[2:09:51] over to the head of the animal and the
[2:09:53] animal was
[2:09:54] slain so there is an identification that
[2:09:57] takes place between your sin and the
[2:10:02] sacrifice you are identifying you are
[2:10:05] confessing to the one that already knows
[2:10:08] and
[2:10:12] he I can just feel sometime in the
[2:10:15] service that people's thumb is itching
[2:10:17] to
[2:10:19] scroll and they just want to scroll
[2:10:23] right past what I'm saying and find
[2:10:26] something more
[2:10:28] interesting no wonder preachers in
[2:10:31] modern churches today are preaching in
[2:10:33] chicken suits
[2:10:36] and dressing up like Barney F
[2:10:41] and doing all kinds of things to capture
[2:10:44] the attention of the people because they
[2:10:46] realize that we have programmed
[2:10:48] ourselves
[2:10:51] I'm constantly told no one has the
[2:10:54] ability to comprehend that much that's
[2:10:56] why it's magnetically recorded that's
[2:10:58] why it's digitally recorded so that you
[2:11:01] have an opportunity if you so desire
[2:11:03] there's no there's no requirement no one
[2:11:06] checks on you to see if you do but if
[2:11:09] the spirit of God and I will tell you
[2:11:11] this the people who testify to me of
[2:11:14] their Victory the people who testify to
[2:11:16] me of overcoming something are always
[2:11:19] those who have spent some time going
[2:11:21] back to the
[2:11:25] word I was listening to such and such I
[2:11:28] was listening to such and such I was
[2:11:30] watching such and such I went back and
[2:11:32] heard such and such and it has so
[2:11:34] encouraged me well weren't you there the
[2:11:36] first time I was well did it encourage
[2:11:38] you then yes but not like it did now
[2:11:40] there's something about going
[2:11:42] back that's why I'm thankful for the
[2:11:44] spiritual food in due season from the
[2:11:47] last generation that God has
[2:11:49] preserved for us
[2:11:52] us we need it it's a way that we
[2:11:55] meditate on the
[2:11:56] word so that we can stay connected to
[2:11:58] the vine if we confess if we confess our
[2:12:03] sins he is
[2:12:06] faithful come on Austin and
[2:12:11] just it's been so long since I've been
[2:12:13] able to poke at
[2:12:18] Austin faithful and
[2:12:23] just to forgive us our sins and to
[2:12:27] cleanse
[2:12:29] us from
[2:12:36] what Romans 109 through1 I've got to
[2:12:39] move on that if Thou shalt
[2:12:45] confess with thy
[2:12:48] mouth the Lord Jesus
[2:12:51] and Shall Believe in thine
[2:12:55] heart
[2:12:57] mind will emotions not blood pump we're
[2:13:02] guarding our heart that God hath raised
[2:13:06] him from the
[2:13:10] dead Thou
[2:13:11] shalt be
[2:13:15] saved without the messenger
[2:13:25] absolutely without reading the church
[2:13:27] age book
[2:13:30] absolutely
[2:13:32] absolutely we've taken what we believe
[2:13:34] right out of the word and tried to stand
[2:13:36] it in the corner and it will not stand
[2:13:38] on its own it has to be based and built
[2:13:41] on the foundation of the absolute
[2:13:43] scripture and this is what the scripture
[2:13:45] said you may not
[2:13:49] overcome you're not going to have the
[2:13:51] Overcomers reward if you don't overcome
[2:13:54] I know that we live in a society where
[2:13:56] everybody gets a
[2:13:57] ribbon Just for participating but in
[2:14:00] that day you're not going to get a
[2:14:03] trophy just cuz you
[2:14:05] tried it's only to the Overcomer right
[2:14:08] these things there's only one company of
[2:14:11] Believers that's going to sit with him
[2:14:13] in his throne and that's those who
[2:14:14] overcome the spirit of their age and
[2:14:17] here's what you need to know we're not
[2:14:18] only overcoming the spirit of leod deia
[2:14:21] but unfortunately this last day bride is
[2:14:23] facing the
[2:14:25] evil of every Church age
[2:14:29] compounded into leoda but that's okay
[2:14:33] because the Lord made me a promise and
[2:14:35] he said in the same manner that the
[2:14:37] leodan bride will face the evil of every
[2:14:41] age she shall also know the overcoming
[2:14:46] portion that I poured out in every age
[2:14:50] oh my my my and what more do you need
[2:14:52] than the than the Overcomers anointing
[2:14:54] the Flying Eagle anointing what more do
[2:14:56] you need than to be lifted up above your
[2:14:59] circumstances to look down and see that
[2:15:02] God's got a bigger
[2:15:05] plan catch the lifeline
[2:15:08] somebody catch the lifeline somebody
[2:15:12] catch the John 15 line somebody yes sir
[2:15:16] Thou shalt be saved if Thou shalt
[2:15:18] confess with thy mouth but here it means
[2:15:20] something more than that he said for
[2:15:23] with the heart man believeth unto
[2:15:26] righteousness and with the mouth
[2:15:29] confession is made unto salvation for
[2:15:31] the scripture sayith whosoever believeth
[2:15:33] on him shall not be but you need to know
[2:15:36] what confession
[2:15:39] means confession did I give you that
[2:15:42] confession
[2:15:44] means to commit oneself to
[2:15:52] so it's not just saying
[2:15:56] it it's coming into a
[2:16:03] covenant it's coming into
[2:16:06] agreement if you believe
[2:16:11] that Jesus died and rose again he paid
[2:16:16] the debt for your
[2:16:17] sin then it's not just a sinner's pray
[2:16:22] joining a church making your way to a
[2:16:25] system there's a commitment that
[2:16:28] follows to commit oneself to to
[2:16:31] acknowledge something usually public a
[2:16:33] profession of
[2:16:36] Allegiance confession means to
[2:16:44] say the same
[2:16:49] thing he he he will cleanse
[2:16:52] me from all
[2:16:55] unrighteousness that's what he said what
[2:16:57] do I need to say the same
[2:17:02] thing greater is he that is in me that's
[2:17:04] what the word said what do I need to say
[2:17:06] greater he this in me come on come on
[2:17:08] come on come on come on my God shall
[2:17:10] supply all of my riches all of my needs
[2:17:14] excuse
[2:17:17] me I sounded like a TV preacher all of a
[2:17:20] sudden
[2:17:21] God shall supply all of my
[2:17:24] needs some of my
[2:17:26] wants according to his riches and glory
[2:17:29] is that what the word says then what do
[2:17:31] I need to confess my God shall supply
[2:17:34] all of my needs according to his riches
[2:17:35] and Glory sister Joyce stand up would

[2:17:45] those confessions I just want you to
[2:17:47] recite it

[2:18:30] that I saw she was reading it the night
[2:18:32] she gave it I want that I want a copy of
[2:18:36] that one that one stayed with
[2:18:39] me she testified of a struggle that had
[2:18:42] followed her her entire life and she
[2:18:45] just found
[2:18:46] scriptures that tell the truth about
[2:18:49] that struggle and she just made it a
[2:18:52] practice every day somebody said I can't
[2:18:54] do it from memory you don't have
[2:18:58] to you can read it it will mean the
[2:19:03] same the devil don't know the
[2:19:08] difference you don't have to be able to

[2:22:33] grace when you've gotten to the place
[2:22:35] where you can sing Amazing Grace as
[2:22:38] though you were telling somebody else's
[2:22:40] story you've turned loose of the
[2:22:47] vine it's your story
[2:22:51] you still with
[2:22:52] me it's your
[2:22:56] story confession means to say the same
[2:23:00] thing in the
[2:23:02] message
[2:23:05] expectation paragraph 32 I said well
[2:23:08] that's up to them I don't know but I
[2:23:09] said you never know no matter how much
[2:23:11] you
[2:23:12] scream yeah how loud you scream how much
[2:23:15] you
[2:23:17] pray brother B said you can punch them
[2:23:19] you can kick them you anoint them and it
[2:23:21] won't do a bit of
[2:23:24] good that Devil's got a legal right to
[2:23:27] stay right there and he will stay there
[2:23:30] too that's right he's got a right to
[2:23:34] stay
[2:23:35] there not only that if but if you
[2:23:38] supposed to have done something and
[2:23:39] didn't do
[2:23:44] it he has a legal right of disobedience
[2:23:51] he said so there's what it is combing
[2:23:54] that person you find out just what the
[2:23:57] cause is then you know where to start
[2:23:59] for the
[2:24:00] curacy it's
[2:24:02] unconfessed
[2:24:05] sin many times we need to say it we need
[2:24:09] to preach that we need to be reminded of
[2:24:12] that sometime so you watch what you say
[2:24:15] stomping this one out and stomping that
[2:24:17] one out see that's right faith will move
[2:24:20] but
[2:24:21] not when he's got a legal right Satan
[2:24:24] knows what his rights is and what he has
[2:24:27] what he has what he hasn't got a right
[2:24:28] to do or to that's
[2:24:32] right clean yourself up before God and
[2:24:35] come before
[2:24:38] him pure and holy ask then it's 120 see
[2:24:44] and now search your life out does
[2:24:46] anybody understand
[2:24:48] that so you come
[2:24:50] the preacher prays anoints you with oil
[2:24:53] you growl you you're you you feel you
[2:24:57] know something it looks
[2:25:02] like you feel
[2:25:05] better but you didn't do what is
[2:25:08] required and that is to confess your sin
[2:25:11] not to the preacher not to the one
[2:25:13] praying to the one who is faithful and
[2:25:15] just
[2:25:20] with unconfessed sin Let me just be real
[2:25:22] real legalistic here because that's what
[2:25:24] they like to call it if you're carrying
[2:25:26] unconfessed sin in your life look this
[2:25:28] way folks you have no business on this
[2:25:34] platform not even to clap your
[2:25:38] hands you have no business in the sound
[2:25:41] booth because I see that as an extension
[2:25:44] of this platform do you see how high it
[2:25:46] sits up above everybody
[2:25:48] else I consider that
[2:25:50] an extension of this platform when you
[2:25:53] are up higher you have made those steps
[2:25:57] up you are looked at as a
[2:26:00] leader whether you're a leader or not
[2:26:03] maybe a guitar player is not a leader
[2:26:05] but really they
[2:26:09] are I know there are churches and whole
[2:26:11] movements out there that if anybody can
[2:26:13] play anything from spoons
[2:26:18] to they want them on the platform
[2:26:22] form but I grew up in a church brother
[2:26:25] Jason where we had trouble with guitar
[2:26:29] players we had some of the
[2:26:32] best you talk about picking it
[2:26:37] out you know why they could do us good
[2:26:40] cuz God gave them a gift and they got
[2:26:42] all their practice at the hunky
[2:26:48] Tonk didn't live so clean
[2:26:51] but got under that anointing and played
[2:26:53] so well and there are people who have
[2:26:55] this mindset that if you can just get
[2:26:57] them involved you know let's have a ball
[2:26:59] team and let everybody play on the ball
[2:27:01] team and that'll get them involved let's
[2:27:03] do this a we come
[2:27:04] on but you forget sometime that if
[2:27:07] everybody's looking up toward you're
[2:27:09] you're up here you are a leader whether
[2:27:12] you have signed up to be one or not and
[2:27:15] you have no business up here
[2:27:20] come on now with unconfessed sin in your
[2:27:22] life that's right what if I told you as
[2:27:26] a Believer you have no business sitting
[2:27:27] where you're
[2:27:28] sitting with unconfessed sin in your
[2:27:31] life because you want to know that you
[2:27:35] are connected to the
[2:27:38] vine and if you have uncon it's so easy
[2:27:42] it's so quick it's so easy it doesn't
[2:27:44] take you you've already repented of your
[2:27:47] broken Fallen condition you don't have
[2:27:50] have to start from
[2:27:51] scratch you don't have to go back to
[2:27:56] birth you know what's unconfessed in
[2:27:58] your life you know what you've allowed
[2:28:01] unbelief to do don't
[2:28:04] pretend take a
[2:28:06] minute because if you will confess he
[2:28:09] will
[2:28:12] forgive and if you have confessed it
[2:28:21] he gives
[2:28:22] Grace to turn from
[2:28:26] it you can't keep in it you've got to
[2:28:29] make up your mind I'm going I'm coming
[2:28:31] out you may not come out all at once but
[2:28:33] you're in you're heading in that
[2:28:35] direction you're
[2:28:37] committing but don't get in this mindset
[2:28:39] you wean yourself off of
[2:28:41] unbelief right that's not the way it
[2:28:45] works come
[2:28:46] on the old church had something right oh
[2:28:49] yeah they preached it like
[2:28:52] that if you don't if you don't confess
[2:28:55] if you don't get that unbelief dealt
[2:28:57] with then it doesn't matter who prays
[2:28:58] for
[2:28:59] you who anoints you with oil who Shakes
[2:29:02] You jerks you ja ja Jaws over
[2:29:06] you you may get a feeling you may get a
[2:29:09] moving you may
[2:29:12] cry there used to be a time folks where
[2:29:14] we could we could almost judge something
[2:29:16] by tears but that's not the hour we live
[2:29:18] in now cuz I've seen demon possessed
[2:29:21] people cry like repentant Sinners and it
[2:29:25] wasn't even them crying but them demons
[2:29:27] was crying out in them trying to fool
[2:29:30] them into thinking something that wasn't
[2:29:31] so come on so it's not by tears that you
[2:29:34] can judge someone's sincerity best thing
[2:29:37] to do is keep your mind and mouth off of
[2:29:38] somebody else let God make it let God
[2:29:41] judge let God take care of his business
[2:29:44] come on we can shake you you can fall
[2:29:47] out you can roll
[2:29:50] you can talk in
[2:29:52] tongues but if the enemy has a legal
[2:29:55] right because of unconfessed sin he goes
[2:29:59] right back to the automobile with
[2:30:06] you and brother random didn't just say
[2:30:08] unconvincing he said even if there's
[2:30:10] something that God told you to do and
[2:30:11] you don't do
[2:30:15] it that gives the enemy a legal right
[2:30:18] and he'll stay I'm telling you
[2:30:20] he'll
[2:30:23] stay but once you have if you will
[2:30:27] confess in the message things that are
[2:30:29] to be look at this one
[2:30:32] Satan you are defeated oh yeah you say
[2:30:37] the devil cut you off you say the devil
[2:30:40] has got you in a fix where you can't
[2:30:42] feel the Lord you say the devil is the
[2:30:44] one who who caused the hang

[2:34:31] circumstances everything can be going
[2:34:33] good and
[2:34:39] suddenly but I'm sick and tired of
[2:34:42] hearing it expressed as though we have
[2:34:46] no choice

[2:36:25] like that but I can stand every day in
[2:36:28] the mirror if I so desire and say I am a
[2:36:31] child of
[2:36:33] God I a blood bought believer I've been
[2:36:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ

[2:44:33] going to Tumble in a bottomless abbis in
[2:44:35] a bottomless pit he's going to Tumble
[2:44:37] for a thousand years while the Earth
[2:44:40] experiences Millennial
[2:44:43] peace somebody said yeah but don't
[2:44:45] forget after that he's going to be
[2:44:47] loosed he's going to try one more time
[2:44:49] to deceive the Nations that have that
[2:44:51] have come through the Millennium that's
[2:44:52] exactly what the word said but after a
[2:44:55] thousand years just think of this after
[2:44:57] a thousand years of living in a kingdom
[2:45:01] where
[2:45:03] Jesus is the
[2:45:06] king do you think that he will be very
[2:45:12] successful do you know he's what stands
[2:45:14] between a lot of people in getting help
[2:45:16] you lock him up and let him tumble for a
[2:45:19] th years do you really think the nations
[2:45:21] are going to continue to spiral when
[2:45:24] Jesus is the Lord of lords and the King
[2:45:27] of
[2:45:28] Kings when the lion is laying down with
[2:45:31] a lamb and your little
[2:45:33] baby it's playing on the hole of the
[2:45:39] ASP the animal kingdom has surrendered
[2:45:42] to the Dominion and sovereignty of King
[2:45:45] Jesus and there is no ambition
[2:45:50] except to come once a
[2:45:53] year into the City and see
[2:46:00] you because where the king
[2:46:05] is what if this were my last
[2:46:08] sermon I better give it all I
[2:46:10] got I better wear you
[2:46:14] out I better not cut it if he didn't say
[2:46:17] cut it yet had I
[2:46:20] the curse is
[2:46:23] gone oh they're going to be planting
[2:46:25] Vineyards and so forth the scripture
[2:46:27] says but can you imagine what's going to
[2:46:28] happen to planet Earth when the curse is
[2:46:33] lifted and they're going to come you
[2:46:36] people who hate the Jewish feast the
[2:46:39] Hebrew Feast the biblical Feast you
[2:46:41] people that have such a problem with
[2:46:42] that you people who ignore what brother
[2:46:45] brandham said you absolutely ignore what
[2:46:47] he said our concern for Israel should be
[2:46:50] you absolutely ignore what he says about
[2:46:54] the Feast of scripture and how they all
[2:46:55] point to Jesus please don't forget that
[2:46:58] according to scripture and your Prophet
[2:47:02] there's going to be a a commemoration of
[2:47:05] the Feast of
[2:47:07] Tabernacles every one of those 1,000
[2:47:10] years in the
[2:47:13] Millennium so God must have not thought
[2:47:15] they belonged to the Jews that's right
[2:47:18] he must have thought they had some
[2:47:19] redeeming
[2:47:21] value because all the nations are going
[2:47:23] to come up to Jerusalem and give praise
[2:47:27] and honor to the King of Kings and the
[2:47:30] Lord of lords Hallelujah somebody said I
[2:47:33] hope they stop by my house on their way
[2:47:35] honey don't you know where he said you
[2:47:38] could
[2:47:40] live to him that overcometh well I grant
[2:47:44] that he should sit with me
[2:47:49] in my throne even as I have sat down
[2:47:53] with
[2:47:54] him in his throne they're coming to see
[2:47:58] you they're coming to see the king and M
[2:48:05] King

[2:48:09] do you with every
[2:48:14] cell from the top of my head
[2:48:18] all the way to the end of my stubbed toe
[2:48:22] this
[2:48:26] morning I kicked the
[2:48:29] tub so
[2:48:34] hard somebody said I know you wanted to
[2:48:38] just
[2:48:40] cuss I have to tell you that was the
[2:48:43] farthest thing from my mind
[2:48:50] keeping
[2:48:52] Consciousness is what I was fixed
[2:49:02] on it didn't just hurt my
[2:49:04] toe it hurt every bit of me you ever had
[2:49:08] it happen I believe it with every cell
[2:49:12] of my

[2:49:56] name he didn't do it you've got a
[2:49:59] Lifeline yes I was sitting at the table
[2:50:03] last night I'm closing you know that's a
[2:50:06] very relative
[2:50:10] term was sitting at the table last night
[2:50:13] I wanted to wanted to turn to charity
[2:50:15] and give her just a little more de uh
[2:50:18] detail of the experience that had
[2:50:20] something to do with
[2:50:23] her she happened to be the reason why I
[2:50:26] prayed for her last night I'm telling
[2:50:28] her business she happened to be the
[2:50:30] first
[2:50:31] one I noticed oddly her face in the
[2:50:35] water she was the closest to the
[2:50:38] boat and she ended up being the first
[2:50:40] one to take a hold of the
[2:50:42] lifeline and I knew then God wanted to
[2:50:45] rescue her from wherever she was
[2:50:47] whatever she was walking through
[2:50:49] whatever she was feeling at the moment
[2:50:51] he he loves you the
[2:50:52] same he didn't love her
[2:50:56] more and then as I told I I wanted to
[2:50:59] tell one more detail just to those who
[2:51:01] are listening and I forgot to mention
[2:51:03] this last night when I looked at that
[2:51:05] vine when I looked at the Rope I thought
[2:51:07] this rope this can save
[2:51:10] everybody I mean it was it was a it was
[2:51:13] a
[2:51:16] rope I I looked up there and I saw
[2:51:18] something that could that rope could
[2:51:20] attach
[2:51:21] to and all it would take is somebody
[2:51:24] with one man's strength just crank that
[2:51:26] thing there'd be no way that anybody
[2:51:28] couldn't be hauled in and all at one
[2:51:31] time if need be they could get to the
[2:51:33] Rope they could get to the liveline but
[2:51:35] all of a sudden that big old rope
[2:51:37] changed and it turned into a little
[2:51:39] little winding Vine no thicker than a
[2:51:42] than a Virginia creeper or a or a a a
[2:51:47] poison oh
[2:51:49] Vine
[2:51:50] just maybe a little maybe a little
[2:51:54] thicker and I looked down at it and I
[2:51:56] thought why this will fall apart in
[2:51:58] people's hands this I'll never be able
[2:51:59] to rescue anybody with this I didn't
[2:52:01] realize it was John 15 right I was just
[2:52:05] seeing it as a little little Vine but
[2:52:08] here's what here's what I didn't mention
[2:52:10] last night I left out quite a few
[2:52:12] details based on the
[2:52:16] crowd but I squeeze that little Vine
[2:52:19] that looks so insignificant really and
[2:52:22] in both
[2:52:23] hands I felt the
[2:52:27] heartbeat
[2:52:29] Hallelujah I could feel the blood
[2:52:32] pumping through that little
[2:52:37] Vine it wasn't it wasn't my blood it
[2:52:40] wasn't it wasn't plant blood it was a
[2:52:42] John 15 it was his blood it was his
[2:52:47] lifeline he was finding a way to get his
[2:52:50] life to the
[2:52:52] perishing how many of you are are
[2:52:55] perishing at
[2:52:57] times I don't mean cuz you're hungry
[2:53:00] some of you feel like you're perishing
[2:53:02] right
[2:53:06] now he's
[2:53:09] swept he hasn't no got no legal right to
[2:53:12] any man that'll accept the promise of
[2:53:14] Jesus Christ he's swept in sickness he
[2:53:19] swept in disappointments he
[2:53:22] swept he swept in
[2:53:25] death he can't scare
[2:53:28] me he can't scare you right that's all
[2:53:32] he
[2:53:34] is you ought to point your bony finger
[2:53:36] and tell him you're nothing but a
[2:53:44] shadow paragraph 107 of working of the
[2:53:48] Holy Holy
[2:53:49] Spirit we didn't get very
[2:53:54] far and I challenge 107 and I challenge
[2:53:57] the enemy who has challenged them and we
[2:54:00] bring back not in our own
[2:54:06] strength but the blood of the Lord Jesus
[2:54:10] and say to him
[2:54:14] Satan I I I didn't put it in my notes
[2:54:16] this morning but brother bram's coming
[2:54:18] to parine one time he's preaching wait
[2:54:19] he said just wait a minute I won't talk
[2:54:20] to Satan a
[2:54:24] minute I wouldn't make that my daily
[2:54:26] habit if I didn't have to but he knew
[2:54:29] who he
[2:54:30] was when you know who you are you've got
[2:54:33] authority to say get out of
[2:54:37] here you don't have to be black to have
[2:54:39] that
[2:54:41] Authority why are you saying that
[2:54:43] because every time I think of authority
[2:54:45] in prayer I think of the little mama
[2:54:47] from from the Kendrick
[2:54:50] Brothers War
[2:54:54] Room some of you folks have seen every
[2:54:57] episode
[2:54:58] of Little House on the Prairie
[2:55:01] and you have haven't bothered you've
[2:55:03] you've watched a lot of junk and you
[2:55:05] haven't even bothered to see
[2:55:07] a a Christian inspirational film that
[2:55:09] come if you're going to if you're not
[2:55:10] going to watch in anything that's all
[2:55:12] right but but if you are going to see
[2:55:14] something on occasion especially with
[2:55:16] your family it ought to be something
[2:55:21] some of you couldn't handle the
[2:55:28] forge oh this world needs that
[2:55:32] message it's in that film The
[2:55:36] Forge but in the War Room how many of
[2:55:39] you have seen the War Room you don't
[2:55:40] have to be
[2:55:40] [Music]
[2:55:43] ashamed there's a black mama black
[2:55:47] granny she's really not that old she's
[2:55:49] made up to look
[2:55:51] old and she's got her a war room in her
[2:55:55] house and she post promises on her
[2:55:57] little closet
[2:55:59] door
[2:56:02] woo to remind her when she's
[2:56:06] praying who she belongs to yes and she
[2:56:10] goes through her living
[2:56:13] room
[2:56:15] how Jesus
[2:56:18] and he hears her she might not dress
[2:56:22] like you or look like all of you or
[2:56:24] believe everything you
[2:56:25] believe but he hears
[2:56:27] her the message is screaming
[2:56:31] loud Mama's got
[2:56:33] Authority you've got
[2:56:37] Authority she helped that one family
[2:56:40] that one woman her husband was going
[2:56:41] astray and getting in trouble and
[2:56:44] crooking and doing whatever else he was
[2:56:46] doing and and that woman got so so
[2:56:48] inspired that she got her a
[2:56:54] broom my marriage is is bad so I I'm
[2:56:59] just disconnected and Satan just folks
[2:57:03] you won't get no over
[2:57:06] that she knew that wasn't going to work
[2:57:09] she had children dependent on her she
[2:57:11] just let her faith begin to rise the
[2:57:14] next thing you know she is sweeping
[2:57:18] right out of the house yeah well you
[2:57:20] don't think it it it works that way well
[2:57:22] no I don't think he's like a Dust Bunny
[2:57:24] on your
[2:57:26] carpet but I
[2:57:28] think that he gets the
[2:57:32] message sir you let a woman like like

[2:57:39] to have my my my
[2:57:42] boys I can't bring them back to life but

[3:02:02] he leave out which one did he not stomp
[3:02:05] on which one did he not

[3:03:00] back say it again
[3:03:06] bye now whosoever call upon the name of
[3:03:08] the Lord and confess can be saved but
[3:03:11] we're not talking about salvation we're
[3:03:13] talking about something bigger than
[3:03:14] salvation we're talking about Redemption
[3:03:17] somebody said what could be bigger than
[3:03:18] salvation oh
[3:03:20] Redemption because Redemption doesn't
[3:03:23] just save you out of your circumstance
[3:03:25] and leave you there salvation saves you
[3:03:27] out of your present
[3:03:28] circumstance but there is something that
[3:03:30] does more than that Redemption
[3:03:32] Redemption doesn't just save you out of
[3:03:34] your present circumstance it takes you
[3:03:37] somewhere Redemption takes you
[3:03:40] all the way
[3:03:44] back to God's original thought
[3:03:48] yeah about you and he saw you
[3:03:52] holy he saw you
[3:03:55] healed he saw you
[3:03:58] sane I want somebody to say he saw me
[3:04:01] sane he saw me in my right
[3:04:05] mind he saw me overcoming high blood
[3:04:08] pressure he saw me overcoming depression

[3:04:16] issue he saw saw me overcoming joint
[3:04:19] issue he saw me overcoming
[3:04:23] arthritis he saw me overcoming daddy
[3:04:26] issues he saw me overcoming abuse
[3:04:29] whether it's word abuse physical abuse
[3:04:32] mental abuse sexual
[3:04:34] abuse he saw me he saw me overcoming a
[3:04:39] broken marriage he saw
[3:04:42] me he saw me overcoming
[3:04:46] addiction he saw
[3:04:49] me Redemption takes you all the way back
[3:04:52] to what he saw about you in the
[3:05:03] beginning did I do that long enough to
[3:05:05] make somebody
[3:05:10] mad he paid the
[3:05:12] price he brought his church back by
[3:05:16] Redemption is that the end of that one
[3:05:18] and tonight or today it's almost
[3:05:21] tonight we
[3:05:24] are
[3:05:26] people I'm G to look at
[3:05:32] you yeah yeah I believe the word's
[3:05:38] right you give me cause to believe that
[3:05:40] the word's
[3:05:42] right because you don't look like
[3:05:43] defeated people to
[3:05:46] me just looking at you right now I would
[3:05:49] never know that you'd ever had a
[3:05:54] problem I would never know that you've
[3:05:56] had a test if I didn't know some of your
[3:05:59] story I would think that you were born
[3:06:01] in the church underneath the
[3:06:06] Pew and that the Christian Life is the
[3:06:09] only life you'd
[3:06:10] know and that you married the perfect
[3:06:12] person had a perfect marriage and and
[3:06:14] have only given birth to perfect
[3:06:15] children
[3:06:19] if I went by what I saw as I look across
[3:06:22] this room it would be much easier for me
[3:06:25] to believe what I've preached
[3:06:28] today because I'm taking him at his
[3:06:34] word you see you choose what you see you
[3:06:40] do I can see you broken and I can see
[3:06:42] you depressed if I choose to see your
[3:06:44] scars they'll show if I choose to see
[3:06:47] you defeated in my mind if I want if I
[3:06:50] should so desire as a wicked hearted man
[3:06:52] that you didn't make it I could almost
[3:06:54] see you in that condition but I choose
[3:06:57] today to see you as you have been

[3:26:08] Edith parents sick
[3:26:13] Afflicted she could have asked for
[3:26:15] healing for E heating so many

[3:26:26] that the prophet was telling about God
