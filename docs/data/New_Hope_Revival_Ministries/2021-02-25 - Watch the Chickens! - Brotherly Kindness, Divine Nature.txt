========================================

Description:
Often we are consumed with wrapping ourselves in our own comfort and security blankets, concerned only with ourselves, our family, and friends, totally oblivious to the needs of others who might be seeking to find the door, the way out of confusion.  

Learn an unforgettable lesson of true brotherly kindness from the actions displayed by one of God’s simple creatures, the concern of one chicken towards another.  

Give thought to the fact that we may hold the key to some little lost lamb lost in the clutches of sin and confusion.  We can reach out to them in love and kindness by displaying His divine nature.  His love will draw them to the Door.  Love is the very nature of Jesus.  Love is stronger than any lie of confusion.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we've gotten secure in our predestination that we've wrapped it so tight we've cut off the flow of god [Music] we as the bride of christ we've wrapped ourselves in a blanket of predestination [Music] we've gotten secure in our predestination that we've wrapped it so tight we've cut off the flow of god you've gotten so tight wrapped up so tight in your own self and i'm you know i'm good and god god's dealing with me and and my family is good and i'm predestinated and i'm wrapping up in my security blanket and nobody can take that from me because i'm predestinated but we've we've gotten to a place that we forgot about other people we we were so consumed with ourself that we forgot about other people that that maybe haven't got to that place yet maybe they haven't got into that that arc of safety yet they're still standing outside of the door who's going to lead them in you know are you if you're so consumed in your predestination are you are you in a position that you can lead somebody to christ or if you stuck yourself off in a corner and just said i'm i'm secure i'm secure i'm safe god's taking care of me we i don't know if anybody here has chickens anybody y'all have any chickens we have some chickens at home and i love to watch i love to watch chickens whenever it's warmer i can sit outside and watch them but right now it's a bit cold um but chickens are funny but i've learned some things i i read in job where he said you can learn things from the beast you can you know so i i didn't feel out of place whenever i i kind of got a little lesson sitting out there watching my chickens in the evening well think about chickens they they they like to get up in there in their nest that's their place of safety you know so at the end of the day you can let them out they'll be free-ranging at the end of the day they all start getting closer and closer to their coop and the run and then one by one they'll go in they'll climb up inside and once they're up inside that's where they are until the next morning whenever the sun comes out and they'll come out one by one and i was sitting out there brother steve one day just sitting at the chair just watching them peck around and everything and as it was getting close to dart most of them went in we have 11. so two of them were still outside they were they were just milling around completely oblivious to the rest that had already went inside and got up in the coop and so they're running around and chasing little bugs and stuff and and in one it's it was like it all of a sudden had an epiphany and it like it starts moving his head around and says wait a minute where's everybody going so it makes a beeline goes inside the little door and and runs inside and goes up and the last one had been running back and forth along the run it runs about 25 feet long and it was going back and forth back and forth running past the door couldn't find its way in and i was sitting there i was like maybe i should go down there and try to encourage it to go in because it was almost dark and then something strange happened i hadn't seen it before one of the other hens climbed down down the ramp come back over because it's not the door wasn't directly in line with it came out of the coop came over and stood in the doorway and as that the other hand the loose one was out it came past it it got its attention and it followed inside then it went down and locked the door and i was like wow that's amazing there was one that was left outside couldn't find its way back in and one that was safe that was in its place of security came out got itself a little bit outside of the norm got itself out of its security blanket and stood next to the door to lead that one in and i about had to rejoice in fit because i'm i'm sitting there singing that that's the way it was for me i couldn't find myself i couldn't find my own way but god could and you could you could go buy this this if this is a doorway you could go buy it and buy it and buy it and your your mind is so confused that you can't receive it you can't see it you don't understand that this is the way i need to go but somebody comes and they step down and they take you by the hand and they say come on come on this is your place of safety this this is the way to get back to christ i i sat there and cried because i watched a chicken give me a lesson on how i should be and i realize that too many times we're not standing close enough to the door we're not close enough to christ because he is our door and if you can get closer to him you'll be able to lead somebody to him don't get so wrapped up in your own your own problems and and your own in your own ideas and your own situations that you're going through in that self-centeredness that egocentric attitude get yourself close to christ he is the door if you're standing next to the door you become that door and you can open it and you can allow them to come in to a place of safety
