[56:12] it's so wonderful to feel his presence
[56:15] worship was so good Chad God bless you
[56:18] thank you so much
[56:25] we just appreciate all that God is doing
[56:27] in times like this
[56:29] and Benjamin's got a lot of work to do
[56:32] this week and is saving his voice today
[56:35] for the rest of the week but we didn't
[56:38] miss a Beat
[56:39] and being is going to help at the
[56:41] beginning of the meetings and we
[56:43] appreciate that too and uh
[56:46] we just have a lot to pray about and I I
[56:49] don't know why I keep feeling and we
[56:52] mention it but I keep feeling like we
[56:54] we've just got to really remember to
[56:57] pray for traveling mercies for those who
[56:59] are coming
[57:00] and I failed at the last minute to give
[57:03] a prayer request that was on my heart
[57:05] and that is there's a little dear sister
[57:09] among the former Amish Believers that we
[57:12] have had fellowship with for a couple of
[57:15] years now and love love love them and
[57:18] look forward to having some of them with
[57:20] us this week
[57:21] uh is it Ari how do you say the name
[57:25] Ari
[57:28] um who is very low with breast cancer
[57:31] and is unable to walk now and uh the
[57:36] family a lot of the sisters are staying
[57:38] close to her and ministering to her and
[57:40] taking care of the family we have asked
[57:43] the Lord for a miracle we've believed
[57:45] that God would touch her and so far it
[57:48] has not manifested but that doesn't mean
[57:51] that it won't yet
[57:53] some of the sisters will miss some of
[57:56] the Believers will miss getting to come
[57:57] to the meetings because they're wanting
[57:59] to be very close to her and I appreciate
[58:01] that would you try to remember her to
[58:04] the Lord every day as you as you pray
[58:07] and ask the Lord to to move on her
[58:10] behalf he's a prayer answering God
[58:13] he hasn't lost his power and he's more
[58:17] than able to do exceedingly abundantly
[58:19] above that which we could even ask or
[58:21] think
[58:22] and uh brother Greeley has greeted all
[58:25] the visitors we're glad to see you here
[58:26] and I need to mention to you streamers
[58:30] that there is the occasion where one of
[58:34] the platforms does not work for us it's
[58:37] not usually our fault but it just
[58:40] happens and uh because we're streaming
[58:43] across multiple platforms so let me just
[58:47] remind those of you who are streaming
[58:50] the different platforms where you can
[58:52] catch the services this week and most
[58:56] every Sunday
[58:57] our Sunday service is streamed live on
[59:01] Facebook and YouTube it is also streamed
[59:05] live on the New Hope Revival ministries
[59:07] app that you can download to your phone
[59:10] and it is streamed live on the website
[59:15] revival.org on Tuesday nights we only
[59:18] stream live on the website
[59:22] revival.org and the app but for the
[59:24] meetings this week we'll stream live on
[59:27] all four platforms Facebook YouTube the
[59:30] app and revival.org if you ever try one
[59:35] of those platforms and you're not seeing
[59:37] a stream as it happened a couple weeks
[59:40] ago go to the next just go down the line
[59:43] uh a lot of people have one that they
[59:46] prefer it seems that a lot of people are
[59:48] preferring YouTube these days
[59:50] uh and if you do that is perfectly fine
[59:54] God bless all of you who are streaming
[59:57] this service across the world from Italy
[1:00:00] God bless you Sister patience from Italy
[1:00:03] and for sister Hannah in Norway and in
[1:00:07] many other places these are the ones who
[1:00:09] have either put a flag the Netherlands
[1:00:11] God bless you have either put a flag or
[1:00:14] or told us where they're watching we
[1:00:17] appreciate every one of you and we don't
[1:00:18] want you missing and usually the phone
[1:00:21] starts lighting up because people say I
[1:00:23] can't get the stream I can't get the
[1:00:25] stream so we just encourage you to go to
[1:00:28] the next platform of your preference
[1:00:30] until you get us if something happens
[1:00:32] that we're nowhere to be found
[1:00:35] check the next day and it should be
[1:00:38] archived on the website and also on the
[1:00:42] uh app and I think occasionally we take
[1:00:45] it back to YouTube I think we've done
[1:00:47] that a time or two maybe uh anyway
[1:00:49] enough of that the services begin
[1:00:52] Tuesday night this week at seven o'clock
[1:00:54] Wednesday night at Seven Thursday night

[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:12] praise God
[1:08:16] praise God let's remain standing for the
[1:08:19] reading of the scriptures today we are
[1:08:22] studying the season that we are in
[1:08:25] this might go a little slow for some of
[1:08:28] you and perhaps it's old news but I felt
[1:08:32] really impressed
[1:08:35] of the Lord to go over a few of the
[1:08:38] themes of the Feast of Tabernacles or in
[1:08:42] Hebrew we call it Sukkot
[1:08:45] it is a time of real celebration
[1:08:49] it is a time of reflection if we are
[1:08:54] following the biblical calendar we have
[1:08:56] just come through
[1:08:58] the Feast of trumpets
[1:09:01] which is a solemn time
[1:09:04] it is a time that calls us to attention
[1:09:08] it will eventually sound on the day that
[1:09:12] our Lord comes and puts his feet on the
[1:09:14] Mount of Olives
[1:09:16] he will completely fulfill all of the
[1:09:20] Feast of Trumpets on that day
[1:09:22] then we have celebrated and we say
[1:09:25] celebrate Loosely we have commemorated
[1:09:27] we have studied the day of atonement Yom
[1:09:31] Kippur last weekend where we are
[1:09:35] reminded that one sacrifice
[1:09:38] one lamb the Lamb of God he only had to
[1:09:42] suffer and die once and he did in one
[1:09:45] moment what all the blood the lambs and
[1:09:48] goats and Bulls was never able to
[1:09:51] accomplish he came shed God's blood and
[1:09:56] in that moment mankind was redeemed
[1:09:59] those who would be called and those who
[1:10:01] would have fellowship with him and so
[1:10:04] now we are at the Feast of Weeks or we
[1:10:06] have come to the Feast of booths or
[1:10:09] sukkotes or Tabernacles
[1:10:11] Jonathan has been like I have and some
[1:10:15] of you others have been in Jerusalem
[1:10:18] during this feast and it's one of the
[1:10:20] most exciting times to be there
[1:10:23] uh let's just let me let me do this real
[1:10:26] quick you'll have to forgive me I I
[1:10:29] never thought to do this
[1:10:32] charity I'm sending you two pictures
[1:10:37] I want you to show these pictures I
[1:10:39] think everybody will enjoy seeing these
[1:10:55] give her just a moment to put these up
[1:11:03] don't be afraid of Silence
[1:11:08] there's coming a 30-minute period of
[1:11:10] Silence it's going to be very very
[1:11:12] important right
[1:11:13] we're not doing radio that's not dead
[1:11:16] air
[1:11:17] I I I texted him to her instead of
[1:11:20] airdrop because I don't pick her up on
[1:11:22] airdrop and even if I did it would take
[1:11:25] me too long to do it
[1:11:27] do you believe the Jews take this
[1:11:29] building the booths seriously
[1:11:33] they build them everywhere they can
[1:11:37] and I don't have the picture I didn't
[1:11:39] save the picture but that look at this
[1:11:42] one
[1:11:46] this is in Yemen Moshe which is the most
[1:11:49] Orthodox area of Jerusalem but in many
[1:11:53] neighborhoods even secular neighborhoods
[1:11:55] you will see hundreds of booths that are
[1:11:59] built to commemorate this time and I
[1:12:02] even saw one uh had a picture of one
[1:12:05] sent to me that I'm just not sure I
[1:12:07] would have been in it
[1:12:09] it was so precariously perched on the
[1:12:13] edge of a uh a small balcony they have
[1:12:17] small balconies sometime where only two
[1:12:19] people can sit very very crowded they
[1:12:23] have taken the rail off
[1:12:26] and had extended
[1:12:30] temporarily the balcony with a wooden
[1:12:33] floor
[1:12:34] and with two two by fours two
[1:12:40] angled up underneath
[1:12:42] I said either they're only Entertaining
[1:12:45] Angels
[1:12:47] are their Mighty skinny family
[1:12:50] I wouldn't dare get out on that one
[1:12:54] Leviticus 23 and 1 and the Lord spake
[1:12:58] unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[1:13:02] children of Israel and say unto them
[1:13:06] concerning the feasts of the Lord
[1:13:10] which ye shall Proclaim to be holy
[1:13:15] convocations
[1:13:17] even these are my feasts I'll read that
[1:13:22] again and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:13:25] saying verse 1 and then verse 2 speak
[1:13:28] unto the children of Israel and say unto
[1:13:32] them concerning the feasts of the Lord
[1:13:36] which ye shall Proclaim to be holy
[1:13:40] convocations even these are would you
[1:13:45] read those two words
[1:13:47] my Feasts
[1:13:49] he didn't say Jews
[1:13:53] he didn't say Jewish feasts
[1:13:55] he didn't say the Feast of Israel
[1:13:59] the Lord said these are my holy days
[1:14:02] these are my set apart times
[1:14:05] these are the feasts of the Lord even
[1:14:10] these are my feasts father we come to
[1:14:13] you today
[1:14:15] Desiring to understand the importance of
[1:14:19] the foundation of the Old Testament it
[1:14:23] is the older Covenant upon which the
[1:14:26] newer Covenant has been built every page
[1:14:30] of that older Testament points us to the
[1:14:34] reality that is fulfilled in You O Lord
[1:14:38] it gives us a broader picture and a
[1:14:42] clearer vision of what you really came
[1:14:46] to accomplish Lord I Thank you for the
[1:14:49] dress rehearsals I thank you for the
[1:14:52] feasts of the Lord and though we don't
[1:14:56] observe them like the Jews might feel of
[1:15:00] the necessity to keep them and very
[1:15:03] afraid that they might do it Loosely or
[1:15:07] they might choose the wrong lulav and
[1:15:11] they have a tremendous amount of anxiety
[1:15:14] over it we we don't feel the call for
[1:15:18] for the necessity of such things but we
[1:15:22] do believe that it's important in this
[1:15:24] hour for us to see the foundation upon
[1:15:27] which our faith is resting so give us
[1:15:30] Grace to study together today let your
[1:15:33] anointing come even in a teaching like
[1:15:36] this let your anointing come and open
[1:15:39] our understanding and let us see you
[1:15:42] clearly on every page that is mentioned
[1:15:45] today and we will give you glory and
[1:15:49] honor and presence and and praise for
[1:15:53] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:55] Christ we pray and the saint said amen
[1:15:58] you may be I want to show you because
[1:16:02] there are times that people around the
[1:16:06] message do not seem to understand the
[1:16:10] importance and when someone doesn't
[1:16:12] understand the importance they they
[1:16:14] often make fun of those who do
[1:16:17] a church I would like to ask you not to
[1:16:20] be that kind of a people from my heart I
[1:16:24] I would like to ask you not to make fun
[1:16:26] of things you don't understand I would
[1:16:29] I'd like for you not to be a critical
[1:16:31] people but a people that build up you
[1:16:34] you might have to look a little harder
[1:16:36] but you can find something good in what
[1:16:39] people are accomplishing for the Lord
[1:16:40] amen and I don't want you to if you if
[1:16:44] you come across a a group of people that
[1:16:47] don't worship the way we worship or have
[1:16:49] the same order of events and they don't
[1:16:52] put the same importance on things that
[1:16:55] we might and we may not put the
[1:16:57] importance on things that they do let's
[1:16:59] just get along with them the best we can
[1:17:02] and pray for them and love them not
[1:17:05] waste any of this precious hour the
[1:17:08] hours of the end that we're living in
[1:17:10] now let's don't waste any of that
[1:17:12] criticizing other churches or other
[1:17:15] people let them do as they are called to
[1:17:18] do
[1:17:19] let them emphasize what they want to
[1:17:21] emphasize because I've seen in other
[1:17:24] places the times and Seasons I have
[1:17:28] watched the I've watched many churches
[1:17:30] now participating in things that they
[1:17:32] once condemned
[1:17:34] and in some cases that's a good thing
[1:17:37] and in other cases it's a it's not such
[1:17:40] a good thing but but people will shift
[1:17:43] as season shift I want to thank God for
[1:17:47] this little church today I want to thank
[1:17:49] God for you people because you have
[1:17:51] weathered the storm and you have stayed
[1:17:55] with the spirit of God as he has led us
[1:17:58] from one thing to the next as we have
[1:18:00] desired to understand the word so if
[1:18:04] what we're going to share today is not
[1:18:06] your cup of tea I just ask you for a
[1:18:08] little bit of indulgence especially to
[1:18:10] you that are streaming maybe you have
[1:18:13] never taken the time to look and to see
[1:18:16] what brother Branham taught us about the
[1:18:19] Feast of the Lord maybe you've never
[1:18:21] taken the time to to look at all the
[1:18:24] things that he told us concerning Israel
[1:18:27] and concerning Jerusalem there is a
[1:18:31] little book we don't have it
[1:18:33] uh brother Zach this actually came from
[1:18:36] your church I ordered it through the
[1:18:37] mail
[1:18:38] uh and and you can go there and get it
[1:18:41] uh it is a a quote book I know that
[1:18:45] seems archaic to most of you I have not
[1:18:49] digitalized this yet but I will
[1:18:51] eventually as I do all the quote books I
[1:18:54] will eventually pull them all together
[1:18:56] and and print them in a PDF so that you
[1:19:00] can have them but I've not done this yet
[1:19:02] but I just wanted to show you I know you
[1:19:04] can't see the pages but I just wanted to
[1:19:07] show you brother Dale catch uh is uh the
[1:19:11] one who put this together
[1:19:14] and uh I I just wished I could show you
[1:19:18] I just don't have any way of of showing
[1:19:21] you I've never dealt a deck of cards so
[1:19:25] I
[1:19:29] what's that
[1:19:32] can anybody do are you getting my point
[1:19:34] I'm belaboring the point because I want
[1:19:36] you to get it so so don't tell me
[1:19:39] as some have tried to tell us are you
[1:19:42] you know you're you're emphasizing the
[1:19:44] Jews or you're emphasizing Israel too
[1:19:47] much or you're you're mentioning the
[1:19:49] feast too much or you're hung in the Old
[1:19:52] Testament or even people have said you
[1:19:55] must think you have some special role to
[1:19:57] the Jews well I actually do I believe
[1:20:01] the bride does not me as an individual
[1:20:04] but me as a part of the corporate bride
[1:20:07] I believe if I heard the prophet right
[1:20:09] he said they brought it to us
[1:20:13] and it's our responsibility to take it
[1:20:16] to them that's all I believe
[1:20:18] that's all I believe I I don't believe
[1:20:21] that it's any one church or any one
[1:20:23] person I just believe that there's going
[1:20:26] to be a way I don't know how but there's
[1:20:29] going to be a way that the Jewish
[1:20:31] Remnant will catch a hole they'll hear
[1:20:33] the truth and they're not just looking
[1:20:35] for something to hear they're looking
[1:20:37] for something to live they want to see
[1:20:39] something lived out in front of them do
[1:20:42] you follow what I'm saying so don't ever
[1:20:45] think that he didn't mention it
[1:20:48] uh and I don't know I don't have any way
[1:20:50] of knowing if this is all I it doesn't
[1:20:54] say that it's all but it just divides
[1:20:57] the quotations into paragraphs and in
[1:21:00] this particular quote book there are 210
[1:21:03] pages
[1:21:04] of things that brother Branham said over
[1:21:07] and over again watch the Jews watch
[1:21:09] Israel watch Jerusalem he said the Jews
[1:21:14] are God's timepiece Israel God's time he
[1:21:18] sometimes said Jerusalem it's God's
[1:21:21] timepiece so it's an important thing for
[1:21:24] us to to understand how that everything
[1:21:28] the prophet brought us it sets as the
[1:21:31] newer Covenant on top of the foundation
[1:21:34] of the older Covenant or what we call
[1:21:37] the Old Testament I want them to put up
[1:21:40] for you uh my translation and I only say
[1:21:45] that because I have combined several
[1:21:49] different versions of these scriptures
[1:21:52] and in order to do it they had to had to
[1:21:55] scooch them on there for you to be able
[1:21:57] to see but I have combined several
[1:22:00] versions of Leviticus 23 1 and 2 and in
[1:22:04] brackets I have put the Hebrew words and
[1:22:08] I'm going to go over them with you in in
[1:22:10] the form of a teaching in just a moment
[1:22:12] before we get to what I really want to
[1:22:14] share and the Lord spoke to Moses saying
[1:22:17] speak to the children of Israel and say
[1:22:19] to them the feasts
[1:22:22] and the word for feast is mohead let me
[1:22:26] hear you say moed it's a beautiful word
[1:22:29] it's a beautiful I like saying moed and
[1:22:34] to make moed plural we don't add an s
[1:22:39] in Hebrew we don't add an S to make
[1:22:41] something plural does anybody know what
[1:22:43] we add
[1:22:44] we add I am in English transliteration
[1:22:47] which mean which is pronounced IM
[1:22:50] so we say
[1:22:54] the mo edim let me say it right Moe edim
[1:22:59] I have to really concentrate on saying
[1:23:01] it because there's a beautiful little
[1:23:03] village that sits right outside of
[1:23:05] Jerusalem called moda in and sometimes
[1:23:09] I'll preach and say mode
[1:23:12] I don't want you to think moda in I want
[1:23:15] you to think Mo Ed IM moedim the Feast
[1:23:19] of the Lord which you shall proclaim the
[1:23:22] word proclaim there is Kara can you say
[1:23:26] Kara
[1:23:27] to be holy and the word for Holy is
[1:23:30] kodesh let me hear you say kodesh
[1:23:34] remember singing the chorus here kodesh
[1:23:37] all right so these are holy kodesh
[1:23:41] convocations the word convocations in
[1:23:45] Hebrew is mikra I want to hear you say
[1:23:48] mikra
[1:23:50] these are my Feasts are my moadim
[1:23:56] and then Leviticus 23 4 these are the
[1:24:00] feasts the moad of the Lord holy qodesh
[1:24:05] convocations mikra which you shall
[1:24:09] Proclaim Quran at their appointed times
[1:24:13] moed
[1:24:15] now if you look at that you'll see that
[1:24:18] there are various English words used to
[1:24:23] describe a single Hebrew word and we
[1:24:26] find that anytime we translate one
[1:24:29] language to another would you put up the
[1:24:32] Hebrew word moed for us and uh if you
[1:24:35] you like to make notes this is a time
[1:24:38] for you to do it we're teaching first
[1:24:41] and preaching in a little while moed it
[1:24:44] even gives you the pronunciation moed
[1:24:47] Strong's number 4150 and it means
[1:24:51] appointed place
[1:24:54] appointed time appointed meeting sacred
[1:24:59] season I like that one set Feast
[1:25:03] appointed season appointed sign original
[1:25:09] tent of meeting when we read in the Old
[1:25:13] Testament concerning the Tabernacle in
[1:25:16] the wilderness moed is a word that can
[1:25:19] also be used in referring to the first
[1:25:22] tent of meeting where God met with the
[1:25:25] children of Israel so it means either an
[1:25:28] appointed place or an appointed time can
[1:25:31] it mean both it absolutely can and does
[1:25:34] so when we read in Scripture that God
[1:25:38] has set some times and Seasons aside
[1:25:42] it's it's different when I say how about
[1:25:45] you going to lunch with me on Friday
[1:25:47] that's an appointment that's an
[1:25:50] engagement right and it may or may not
[1:25:52] be sacred depending on what we eat
[1:25:56] if we're going for wings you might not
[1:25:58] be able to call that a sacred engagement
[1:26:00] but if we're going for grass you know
[1:26:03] like like salads or something like that
[1:26:05] or something healthy you you might you
[1:26:08] might say that's a special a special
[1:26:10] meeting but that's not what kind of
[1:26:13] meetings these are these are highly
[1:26:16] chosen times
[1:26:18] that God says I want to meet with you in
[1:26:22] a particularly significant way I want to
[1:26:25] come among you and show you who I am now
[1:26:29] I can come 365 days of the year how many
[1:26:33] of you know we can
[1:26:34] but he said I want to especially set
[1:26:37] aside some times where you are expecting
[1:26:41] me to come
[1:26:42] now every church has a time of special
[1:26:46] meetings and you know what I don't have
[1:26:48] any problem calling that a moed
[1:26:50] because it's an appointed meeting and an
[1:26:54] appointed place with an appointed time
[1:26:56] and with an appointed agenda we're going
[1:27:00] to meet with the Lord we're going to
[1:27:02] hear the word of God preached we're
[1:27:04] going to ask the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:27:06] say Amen to the word we're going to
[1:27:09] believe for bodies to be healed and
[1:27:11] Minds to be made whole we're going to
[1:27:14] believe for the lost to be found the
[1:27:16] backslid to come back to God for though
[1:27:19] many to receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:21] re-fillings of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:24] we're going to make it a time of
[1:27:26] rejoicing and that's what we're entering
[1:27:28] into this week a mohead so I don't want
[1:27:31] you to think that we're making this
[1:27:33] something that is not we are well within
[1:27:36] the definition of the word we have
[1:27:38] appointed a time we have chosen to come
[1:27:42] every year during the Feast of
[1:27:44] Tabernacles it just so happens that we
[1:27:48] have chosen our moed on one of God's
[1:27:52] moed
[1:27:55] and I like that it doesn't have to be
[1:27:58] that way I saw a church in the message
[1:28:01] in South America last year I think it
[1:28:03] was who called their meeting the Feast
[1:28:06] of Tabernacles and they had it sometime
[1:28:09] in the spring it doesn't matter to me
[1:28:12] but I like the idea of us having our
[1:28:17] holy convocation our appointed time in
[1:28:22] an appointed season
[1:28:24] reflecting on the original tent of
[1:28:26] meeting I like that because I'm
[1:28:29] believing that he's going to come
[1:28:31] hello help me a little bit
[1:28:33] he's going to come and meet with us how
[1:28:36] many of you want to meet him
[1:28:38] every time every time brother every time
[1:28:41] we come we want to meet him and I don't
[1:28:44] believe that it has to be a particular
[1:28:48] time on God's calendar for him to meet
[1:28:51] with us
[1:28:52] but I like the idea of calling our moed
[1:28:57] uh during his moed
[1:29:01] because brother Branham said the Feast
[1:29:03] of Tabernacles is an eternal feast
[1:29:06] yes
[1:29:07] I'll give it to you in a little while he
[1:29:10] said it's an eternal one it never even
[1:29:13] after it is fulfilled
[1:29:15] it never passes away
[1:29:18] now if God thinks that Tabernacles is
[1:29:20] important I believe I will and if you
[1:29:23] ever doubt it just
[1:29:31] check us out
[1:29:33] don't take my word for it check us out
[1:29:37] now
[1:29:39] the second word of our study if you'll
[1:29:42] put that up
[1:29:43] is the word Kara
[1:29:46] and that word Kara is translated in
[1:29:50] Leviticus 23 as Proclaim
[1:29:54] I want you to know that Proclaim doesn't
[1:29:58] mean just to say
[1:30:02] you can say something without
[1:30:04] proclaiming it don't don't don't get too
[1:30:09] distracted there before we read that but
[1:30:11] but let me ask you this what do you
[1:30:14] think that what would be the difference
[1:30:15] in in saying something and proclaiming
[1:30:19] something what be the first thing would
[1:30:20] come to your mind
[1:30:22] you know what I love that the best
[1:30:26] I hadn't thought of it quite like that
[1:30:28] uh I was thinking along the line of
[1:30:31] volume you know the difference between
[1:30:33] saying or Whispering or just speaking
[1:30:36] and proclaiming it
[1:30:39] but I actually like yours the best say
[1:30:41] it again brother Austin confidence
[1:30:44] confidence in saying it
[1:30:47] oh I think that'll preach
[1:30:51] God wasn't whispering to his children
[1:30:54] about when he wanted them to gather to
[1:30:56] meet him he wasn't having the prophet
[1:30:58] Moses just to whisper it or just say it
[1:31:01] nonchalantly in conversation he said
[1:31:05] Proclaim that news tell all
[1:31:09] Israel I want to meet with them
[1:31:12] do you understand the magnitude of God
[1:31:15] wanting to meet with his children
[1:31:17] doesn't bless your blesser to know that
[1:31:20] he wants to meet with you he wants to
[1:31:24] come to you and Minister the God of all
[1:31:29] eternity wants to minister to your needs
[1:31:33] he wants to bring with him everything
[1:31:36] that you and I have need of
[1:31:39] and he said to Israel I'm going to do it
[1:31:41] seven different times within the year
[1:31:45] now that doesn't mean because we know
[1:31:47] that God promised to meet with his
[1:31:49] children every day
[1:31:51] we know that he promised to particularly
[1:31:54] draw nigh to the household of Israel on
[1:31:59] Sabbath on the Shabbat which is a weekly
[1:32:02] meeting so you can meet with God daily
[1:32:06] you can meet with God weekly
[1:32:08] and then you can meet with God over
[1:32:11] those seven Feasts
[1:32:14] of the Lord not Jewish feast
[1:32:17] I want to say it again
[1:32:22] we've Fallen under quite a bit of
[1:32:24] criticism for mentioning the Jews Feasts
[1:32:28] come and hold this Alias you'll need it
[1:32:34] they don't belong to the Jews
[1:32:37] they don't belong to the Gentiles
[1:32:40] they don't belong to only the citizens
[1:32:43] of the nation of Israel
[1:32:45] they belong to the
[1:32:48] to the Lord
[1:32:49] and the word Lord in Hebrew is what
[1:32:53] Adonai
[1:32:55] so they are adonai's
[1:32:59] they belong to him they are his feasts
[1:33:02] now when he tells us in Leviticus 23
[1:33:06] Proclaim them
[1:33:08] say it again Quran which means to call
[1:33:16] now the first thing I think of when I
[1:33:19] hear to call I think about invite
[1:33:23] I'm calling you up on the phone and I'm
[1:33:26] telling you that the greatest I don't
[1:33:29] know why I always think of food
[1:33:34] maybe because I've unfortunately got my
[1:33:37] belly out there so I can see it I guess
[1:33:39] that may be why I think so much I'm
[1:33:41] seeing it more
[1:33:43] I I I'm gonna call you up and I'm going
[1:33:46] to invite you to come to Chili Thai
[1:33:51] which is the best Thai restaurant in the
[1:33:55] world
[1:33:58] they went out of business for a couple
[1:33:59] years and we prayed them back in
[1:34:02] business
[1:34:04] and it's good over there and as I
[1:34:07] discovered last night is good at home
[1:34:09] too
[1:34:10] just swing by and bring it home
[1:34:13] no added sugar so you can be thankful
[1:34:16] it's not it's not phony baloney Chinese
[1:34:18] food it's good and if I if I call you up
[1:34:23] and and say we're going to meet over
[1:34:25] here uh on a certain night it's an
[1:34:28] invitation
[1:34:29] so when we see the word proclaim brother
[1:34:33] Austin told us that it has something to
[1:34:35] do with a confident oh I'm just really
[1:34:38] going to hang on that a minute the
[1:34:40] confidence that you have when you say a
[1:34:43] certain thing
[1:34:44] so preaching is like proclaiming isn't
[1:34:47] it because you better have some
[1:34:49] confidence in the god you're talking
[1:34:51] about right and so to call to call out
[1:34:55] to recite to read aloud to cry out
[1:34:59] Proclaim cry utter allowed sound to call
[1:35:03] unto to Proclaim to summon to invite to
[1:35:08] call for call and commission a point to
[1:35:11] be called to be proclaimed to be
[1:35:14] summoned to be named to be called out to
[1:35:17] be chosen every one of those
[1:35:20] appears in the in the Lexicon
[1:35:23] somebody wanted us to make sure we
[1:35:25] understood the the whole width of the
[1:35:29] word proclaim God said I want you to
[1:35:31] Proclaim to my people that I'm going to
[1:35:34] set aside some time every year
[1:35:38] you don't have to worry I'm going to
[1:35:40] keep the Earth spinning
[1:35:42] I'm going to keep the sun in this place
[1:35:44] I'm going to keep the stars in their
[1:35:47] place I'm going to keep weather in its
[1:35:49] place but I'm going to come and meet
[1:35:52] with my children during some special
[1:35:55] times of the year
[1:35:57] it's going to be a dress rehearsal it's
[1:36:01] going to be a time to learn to observe
[1:36:04] to participate in because one day you're
[1:36:07] going to see that for every shadow that
[1:36:11] is mentioned in the Feast of the Lord
[1:36:13] Jesus our Messiah Our Savior has come to
[1:36:18] fulfill that
[1:36:19] he did not come to destroy the law he
[1:36:23] came to fulfill the law to fill it up
[1:36:27] and to help us to understand that God
[1:36:30] was using the sacrificial system he was
[1:36:34] using the offering system he was using
[1:36:37] both the Tabernacle and the temple to
[1:36:41] point to something greater to something
[1:36:43] more beautiful Hebrews says to something
[1:36:47] more tangible
[1:36:49] to something that every one of us can
[1:36:52] participate in you don't have to be
[1:36:55] physically circumcised
[1:36:57] you don't have to be a Jew by by birth
[1:37:06] God said I'm going to do something that
[1:37:08] the one new man can participate in
[1:37:11] Paul said there's one new man that was
[1:37:13] God's goal
[1:37:15] he wanted to bring a one new man
[1:37:18] he wanted to prepare a people both among
[1:37:21] the Jews and among the Gentiles that he
[1:37:24] could call out for his name did you know
[1:37:27] your people of the name
[1:37:28] tell your neighbor I'm a people of the
[1:37:31] name
[1:37:34] I've been called out by his name
[1:37:36] I've been chosen
[1:37:39] by his name
[1:37:40] Hallelujah I've been set apart
[1:37:43] sanctified
[1:37:45] by his name I am a people of the book
[1:37:48] not just the Jews are the people of the
[1:37:51] book but as a bride of Christ I'm part
[1:37:54] of the people of the book I've been
[1:37:56] brought in Hallelujah and I wasn't an
[1:37:59] afterthought
[1:38:01] this Gentile way this God calling Out
[1:38:05] Among the Gentiles a people for his name
[1:38:07] was not an afterthought he had you in
[1:38:10] his mind
[1:38:12] he said I'm going to minister to my own
[1:38:14] first
[1:38:16] and then I'm going to have me unknown
[1:38:18] I'm going to find me a people out there
[1:38:23] an original thought I'm going to find me
[1:38:26] a people out there whose mothers may not
[1:38:29] have been Jewish
[1:38:30] whose fathers may not have been Jewish
[1:38:32] but I saw them before the foundation of
[1:38:35] the world
[1:38:36] I'm going to engraft them into the heart
[1:38:39] of Israel
[1:38:41] I'm going to make them one new man and
[1:38:44] that's why the sonship message that
[1:38:47] brother Branham brought to us is a
[1:38:49] message that can be it can be summarized
[1:38:52] in this particular context by saying hey
[1:38:56] the Jew is you
[1:39:01] let me let that sink in just a moment
[1:39:04] the Jew is you
[1:39:06] because God wasn't looking in this hour
[1:39:08] when he's building this last day bride
[1:39:12] he's not looking for the prerequisites
[1:39:14] of a natural-born Israelite
[1:39:16] he's looking for those who have the seed
[1:39:18] of God
[1:39:21] Hallelujah
[1:39:22] and and the rabbi doesn't tell us where
[1:39:25] the seed of God is
[1:39:27] the preachers can't tell you who gets
[1:39:29] the seed of God it was God's choosing
[1:39:33] it was God's election it was God's
[1:39:37] predestination that chose who I replaced
[1:39:40] the seed so you can feel very privileged
[1:39:43] and very honored and very valuable
[1:39:46] because though you may not have the
[1:39:49] Jewish natural heritage you have an
[1:39:52] inheritance of everything that God
[1:39:55] promised to the Natural Jew
[1:40:00] that was kind of weak
[1:40:03] you've got a Homeland
[1:40:06] it's not just the Natural Born Jew
[1:40:08] that's got a Homeland how many of you
[1:40:10] have got a Homeland
[1:40:13] we're gonna step over into that promise
[1:40:16] over into that Homeland
[1:40:19] sooner rather than later if you believe
[1:40:21] that same man
[1:40:23] thank you for staying with me now
[1:40:26] finally we've covered uh Kara finally
[1:40:30] we're going to go to a two-word phrase
[1:40:36] kodesh
[1:40:38] which means holy
[1:40:41] and mikra
[1:40:44] now kodesh means
[1:40:47] a partners
[1:40:50] what a strange word
[1:40:53] it it means sanctified
[1:40:57] to sanctify something means to set it
[1:41:01] apart for use
[1:41:03] brother Branham gives us that example of
[1:41:05] finding the jelly jar or the glass out
[1:41:09] in the in the in the farmyard
[1:41:11] and it's been laying there some some
[1:41:14] child drank some milk or something out
[1:41:16] of it and left it out on the porch and
[1:41:18] and the elements knocked it off the
[1:41:21] porch or or the cat God forbid
[1:41:25] you know right away that wasn't my house
[1:41:28] but the cat knocked the glass off and it
[1:41:31] lay there in the weather and it rained
[1:41:34] and the dirt blew and the next thing you
[1:41:36] know that glass is almost buried there
[1:41:38] to Never Be Remembered again
[1:41:40] when all of a sudden brother random said
[1:41:42] God himself comes what he sees that
[1:41:45] there
[1:41:46] dirty
[1:41:48] not fit for use
[1:41:52] too dirty too nasty to drink out of but
[1:41:55] a glass
[1:41:57] it was created to drink out of it hasn't
[1:42:00] busted it hasn't broke
[1:42:03] it still has the potential of drinking
[1:42:06] out of it somebody's just gotta set it
[1:42:09] apart somebody's got to pick it up from
[1:42:12] where it was do you remember when he
[1:42:14] found you
[1:42:15] you didn't find him he found you do you
[1:42:19] remember when he found you and he picked
[1:42:21] you up from your worldly friends
[1:42:24] he picked you out from your ungodly
[1:42:26] environment
[1:42:27] [Applause]
[1:42:30] circumstance of your of your sin
[1:42:33] Hallelujah and he said this one's mine
[1:42:39] always was
[1:42:41] always was
[1:42:43] remember the story twice mine
[1:42:46] I made you mine and then I cleaned you
[1:42:49] up and bought you to be mine Hallelujah
[1:42:52] so then he said you take it in and you
[1:42:54] wash it out in the kitchen and you get
[1:42:56] all the dirt and the grime and the
[1:42:57] residue out and now you can fill it up
[1:43:00] with whatever you doesn't matter whether
[1:43:01] it's water or wine you can put anything
[1:43:04] in it
[1:43:05] and it has now been it's now fit for
[1:43:07] drinking it is now fit for service it is
[1:43:10] now fit for use there's nothing but the
[1:43:13] blood of Jesus Christ and His holy word
[1:43:15] revealed to us that can redeem us back
[1:43:18] to such an extent that we can now be
[1:43:20] anything God wants us to be he just
[1:43:23] fills us with who he is and he says now
[1:43:26] you're mine you are exclusively my
[1:43:29] treasure
[1:43:30] you are my secular
[1:43:33] my peculiar treasure
[1:43:36] the king had a treasure that he valued
[1:43:39] above all the other treasures and it was
[1:43:42] called secular and no wonder he comes
[1:43:46] and says to us through the Apostle
[1:43:47] you're a chosen generation you are a
[1:43:51] holy people hallelujah
[1:43:53] The Peculiar people a holy nation
[1:43:56] that you should show forth the Praises
[1:43:59] of him who's called you out of the out
[1:44:02] of their yard
[1:44:03] into His Marvelous
[1:44:07] and then you're put in service
[1:44:08] because now you become one of those who
[1:44:11] are full of light you are you become one
[1:44:13] of those who are full of love and you
[1:44:15] become one of those that even the Jews
[1:44:18] can come to and say
[1:44:22] take a hold of your garment
[1:44:24] and ask you who are you what is this
[1:44:27] that you carry why is it that you shine
[1:44:30] so
[1:44:31] now my sons are here and they're old
[1:44:33] enough to remember things like this
[1:44:36] happening to us in Jerusalem
[1:44:39] you know when you begin to see God's
[1:44:41] word come to pass it'll shock you and it
[1:44:44] shouldn't we should expect it to come to
[1:44:47] pass
[1:44:48] but there were multiple times not just
[1:44:50] one time but but a significant number of
[1:44:53] times that we would just be doing what
[1:44:56] everybody else was doing in Jerusalem
[1:44:59] we're shopping in the market we're
[1:45:01] getting our vegetables we're we're
[1:45:03] buying our olives and cheese and
[1:45:04] whatever we're going to need for the
[1:45:06] week and on more than one occasion a Jew
[1:45:09] even an orthodox Jew run up to us and
[1:45:13] say why is that light coming out of your
[1:45:16] face
[1:45:18] well I didn't know there was light
[1:45:20] coming out of my face
[1:45:22] but you see the Bible said they will
[1:45:24] come to you they'll take a hold of you
[1:45:25] they'll want to know what your faith is
[1:45:28] they'll want to know what you've got
[1:45:31] and that's when the interview comes
[1:45:33] that's when they start asking you what
[1:45:35] you believe
[1:45:37] and when you tell them you believe in
[1:45:39] Messiah they'll say oh are you like
[1:45:42] those Christian churches down in The Old
[1:45:44] City
[1:45:45] and you say to them no because you're
[1:45:47] not Catholic and you're not Orthodox and
[1:45:51] Jews especially in Middle Eastern Jews
[1:45:54] they believe that all Gentiles Are pagan
[1:45:56] and that all Gentiles worship idols
[1:45:59] because their their biggest introduction
[1:46:02] to Christianity is the Catholic church
[1:46:04] and they pass by the Church of the Holy
[1:46:07] Sepulcher and they see the Catholics
[1:46:08] kissing the speed of statues
[1:46:11] and so the first thing they think of as
[1:46:13] a Christian is an idolater
[1:46:16] and then they begin to want to question
[1:46:18] you about what kind of food you eat
[1:46:21] and then they want to question you and
[1:46:22] here's the kicker
[1:46:24] they'll say well down there in the in in
[1:46:26] the in the entrance of the Old City all
[1:46:29] those churches they put up Christmas
[1:46:31] trees
[1:46:32] and they teach their children about
[1:46:34] Santa Claus and I don't want any part of
[1:46:36] that and if you're some of them we don't
[1:46:38] want any part I don't I don't even have
[1:46:40] to ask you any more questions
[1:46:42] imagine the look on their face when we
[1:46:44] explain to them that we are non-pagan
[1:46:46] Christians
[1:46:48] and we understand that all of that
[1:46:50] belongs to the pagans of the world it
[1:46:52] doesn't belong to the faith and then
[1:46:54] they start saying tell me more
[1:46:56] I'll never forget the last one who did
[1:46:59] us that way I begin to tell tell him
[1:47:01] more I begin to share with him and he
[1:47:03] runs away
[1:47:05] he doesn't walk away he runs away
[1:47:09] and I'm thinking what did I do what did
[1:47:12] I say how did I offend him and I just
[1:47:14] said to the family maybe he saw somebody
[1:47:17] that he knew and he didn't want them to
[1:47:20] see him talking to us if God has given
[1:47:22] us this appointment he'll come back
[1:47:24] around and you know what it was probably
[1:47:26] about 45 minutes to an hour later that
[1:47:28] we were on a side street I remember what
[1:47:30] we were buying we were buying those big
[1:47:32] old beautiful dates that come across
[1:47:34] from Turkey big beautiful dates and I
[1:47:37] was buying a tray of those big beautiful
[1:47:39] dates to bring back here for our for our
[1:47:42] Passover time and and was enjoy and here
[1:47:45] he come along he said I got a couple
[1:47:46] more questions I want to ask you now
[1:47:48] that was just an isolated incident but
[1:47:51] it gave me some understanding of how
[1:47:54] there's coming a day
[1:47:57] there's coming an hour that even the
[1:48:00] Jews who who don't understand
[1:48:03] who have no real grid for what Christ
[1:48:06] has really done they'll become hungry
[1:48:08] and I believe we're living in that hour
[1:48:10] where many are already hungry we know
[1:48:13] that the majority of the Jews will not
[1:48:15] come in until Jesus stands on the Mount
[1:48:17] of Olives
[1:48:19] but according to scripture one new man
[1:48:21] is made up of both you and Gentile and
[1:48:24] so even in the hour of the Bride there
[1:48:27] will be some Jews that are a part of
[1:48:29] that one new man who will see what God
[1:48:32] is doing in your life
[1:48:34] in the life of the bride and they will
[1:48:37] begin to ask you tell me about your
[1:48:39] faith I want to know what it is that you
[1:48:41] represent and you're given an
[1:48:43] opportunity to tell them none of this is
[1:48:46] is possible without the Lord Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ
[1:48:49] he satisfies everything the law demands
[1:48:54] he fulfills everything the scripture has
[1:48:57] laid out he's the one that I'm following
[1:49:00] so kodesh is a partners
[1:49:03] holiness
[1:49:05] sacredness
[1:49:07] I'll wait on you to put that back up
[1:49:11] separateness
[1:49:12] set apartness
[1:49:15] so it's holy it's sacred it's
[1:49:20] separate
[1:49:21] Micra it can mean convocation convoking
[1:49:26] reading and calling together but I like
[1:49:29] the last one the best sacred assembly I
[1:49:33] will meet you there I will meet you
[1:49:36] there do you need another example look
[1:49:38] at Joel 2 15. I'm going to ask you to
[1:49:41] come real close to me now for just a few
[1:49:44] minutes and let me get some of this out
[1:49:46] so that we can not not be here all day
[1:49:48] Joel chapter 2 verse 15 blow
[1:49:53] blow the trumpet in Zion
[1:49:56] sanctify a fast read the rest of it for
[1:49:59] me
[1:50:02] a mikra
[1:50:04] a mohead
[1:50:06] I want to meet with you
[1:50:08] the very first thing that we notice in
[1:50:12] that verse of scripture as I have
[1:50:13] mentioned already two times that these
[1:50:16] are not the feasts of Israel they are
[1:50:18] not the Feast of the Jews they are Feast
[1:50:20] of the Lord
[1:50:21] in in Leviticus 23 3 he begins to
[1:50:26] mention first the Sabbath six days shall
[1:50:30] work be done but the seventh day is the
[1:50:32] Sabbath of rest and holy convocation
[1:50:35] there's your word again a a kodesh mikra
[1:50:39] ye shall do no work therein it is the
[1:50:43] Sabbath of the Lord in all of your
[1:50:46] dwellings so in Leviticus 23 he mentions
[1:50:49] the Sabbath first because this is a
[1:50:51] weekly time that God says I want to meet
[1:50:54] with you I'm going to be very honest
[1:50:56] with you I don't believe your Sabbath
[1:50:59] has to be on a particular day of the
[1:51:00] week
[1:51:05] I remember it's Friday evening is
[1:51:07] leaving us on Saturday I remember that
[1:51:09] that was the Sabbath that the Jews kept
[1:51:11] but I believe that God was more than
[1:51:13] anything else he was looking to teach
[1:51:16] his people I want you to give me some of
[1:51:18] Who You Are
[1:51:19] I want you to give me some time
[1:51:22] because it's a whole lot different in
[1:51:25] 2023 than it was in the desert in in
[1:51:28] Egypt coming out of Egypt you didn't
[1:51:31] have a lot of things to keep you busy
[1:51:32] back then we're living in an hour now
[1:51:35] where it's not always feasible for you
[1:51:37] to set aside a whole day but I believe
[1:51:40] God is just looking for you to
[1:51:42] understand that he gives us this rest it
[1:51:45] is a rest that is promised to the people
[1:51:47] of God and if you if you want to set
[1:51:50] Sunday aside as your day then I think
[1:51:53] that's absolutely fine it's not the
[1:51:55] Sabbath but it can be your Sabbath
[1:51:58] we come because we are reminded of the
[1:52:01] resurrection of Jesus Christ I don't
[1:52:03] believe we should become Fanatics I
[1:52:05] don't believe we should become Adventist
[1:52:08] I believe we should understand that
[1:52:10] these are dress rehearsals to point us
[1:52:13] to the reality that the message has
[1:52:16] brought to us
[1:52:18] now I want you to see the order of the
[1:52:20] feast if you'll put that up there there
[1:52:22] are seven feasts of the Lord
[1:52:24] number one the Passover number two the
[1:52:27] Feast of unleavened bread number number
[1:52:30] three the Feast of first fruits number
[1:52:34] four the Feast of Pentecost
[1:52:37] now these first four Feast of the Lord
[1:52:39] are what we call the spring feast
[1:52:42] because they all take place in the
[1:52:44] spring of the year and every one of
[1:52:47] those four has Jesus written all over it
[1:52:50] amen he's Lord in the Passover he was
[1:52:54] Lord in unleavened bread he raised from
[1:52:57] the dead and resurrected and Lord of the
[1:53:00] Feast of the firstfruits and then uh on
[1:53:03] the day of Pentecost he came 50 days
[1:53:05] later and poured out the same spirit
[1:53:08] that was in him didn't he do it he said
[1:53:11] I'll not leave you comfortless I will
[1:53:14] come to you I'm going to endure you with
[1:53:18] dunamis I'm going to endure you to fill
[1:53:21] you to infuse you with power from on
[1:53:25] high and then we have the last three
[1:53:27] number five the Feast of trumpets number
[1:53:31] six the day of atonement number seven
[1:53:33] the Feast of Tabernacles all of these
[1:53:37] three feasts we call the fall Feast
[1:53:39] because they fall in Autumn time in the
[1:53:43] fall season on the Gregorian calendar
[1:53:48] I want to I want to read you a verse of
[1:53:50] scripture
[1:53:51] before we go much further in Hebrews 4
[1:53:54] verses 9 and 10 in the Amplified see if
[1:53:58] this will help you
[1:54:00] so then there is still awaiting
[1:54:06] a full and complete Sabbath rest
[1:54:13] reserved
[1:54:15] for the true people of God
[1:54:19] who wrote this we believe the Apostle
[1:54:22] Paul under inspiration of the Holy
[1:54:25] Spirit
[1:54:26] we believe he wrote this to the Church
[1:54:29] of the Hebrews meaning Jews
[1:54:32] who had come to receive Yeshua or Jesus
[1:54:36] as their Messiah and so Paul in the book
[1:54:39] of Hebrews he directs everything to the
[1:54:42] completed Jew
[1:54:44] to those who have come to understand
[1:54:47] that Jesus Yeshua is the Fulfillment of
[1:54:50] the law and the prophets
[1:54:52] he has a very unique and a very
[1:54:54] important job to do and he did a very
[1:54:56] dangerous thing in a verse like this
[1:54:58] because he says to the people you may
[1:55:00] continue to meet week after week after
[1:55:02] week and you may continue to honor the
[1:55:05] weekly Sabbath but I need you to know
[1:55:08] that there is yet a rest that has not
[1:55:11] yet been fulfilled
[1:55:13] now how is it that Jesus has already
[1:55:16] come and the Sabbath rest has not
[1:55:18] completely been fulfilled because he's
[1:55:21] pointing to Millennium
[1:55:24] brother random said he's pointing to the
[1:55:26] eighth feast
[1:55:29] which is the Eighth Day
[1:55:31] which is the eighth one thousand years
[1:55:34] and how many of you know that's the
[1:55:36] Millennium and he is pointing to that
[1:55:39] time of rest where the lamb will lay
[1:55:42] down with the lion
[1:55:43] a little children will play a little
[1:55:45] babe on the whole of the poisonous snake
[1:55:47] a little child will lead him the wolf
[1:55:50] Will Be Tamed the the the the the leper
[1:55:53] gentle that will be a complete reversal
[1:55:56] of the curse that was placed on all of
[1:55:58] creation you talk about rest
[1:56:02] you talk about honeymoon come on and
[1:56:04] help me now you talk about honeymoon
[1:56:06] Christ the bridegroom and his little
[1:56:09] elected lady bride one thousand years of
[1:56:13] Sabbath rest and here Paul is pointing
[1:56:15] to it he said so then there is still
[1:56:17] awaiting a fool and complete Sabbath
[1:56:20] rest reserved for the true people of God
[1:56:24] and he goes on to say for he who has
[1:56:26] once entered God's rest also has ceased
[1:56:31] from the weariness and pain of human
[1:56:34] labors just as God rested from those
[1:56:37] labors
[1:56:38] peculiarly his own
[1:56:41] the the Apostle is pointing to the same
[1:56:45] rest that we learned about in Hebrews
[1:56:47] other chapters of Hebrews where he's
[1:56:50] telling us there's a rest that remains
[1:56:52] and that rest is to take the word of God
[1:56:55] that we hear and mix it with faith so
[1:56:59] that it has complete jurisdiction
[1:57:03] so that it has complete Authority in our
[1:57:06] lives and that word transforms us we sit
[1:57:11] under the word and the Holy Spirit
[1:57:13] reveals the the truth of that word and
[1:57:17] The Germ of that word that we catch by
[1:57:19] the spirit it begins to transform us out
[1:57:23] of the realm of Flesh and into the realm
[1:57:25] of word if you believe that's what he
[1:57:27] taught let me hear you say Amen
[1:57:29] and here the scripture is pointing in
[1:57:32] that direction
[1:57:34] in Deuteronomy 16 16 if you're helping
[1:57:38] me I appreciate it because I believe I'm
[1:57:41] doing what the Lord had me to do today
[1:57:48] three times in a year
[1:57:51] shall all your males appear before the
[1:57:53] Lord thy God in the place which he shall
[1:57:56] choose
[1:57:57] in the Feast of the unleavened bread
[1:58:00] which we know is Passover it overlaps
[1:58:03] and in the Feast of Weeks which we know
[1:58:06] is Shavuot or Pentecost and in the Feast
[1:58:10] of Tabernacles which we know is Sukkot
[1:58:12] and they shall not appear before the
[1:58:14] Lord empty
[1:58:17] you got to bring something when you come
[1:58:19] I want you to bring something this week
[1:58:22] I want you to bring your faith
[1:58:25] I want you to bring your praise
[1:58:27] I want you to bring your worship I want
[1:58:30] you to leave your distraction in the car
[1:58:33] I want you to leave your worries at home
[1:58:35] I want you to leave your fears on the
[1:58:38] outside when you walk through those
[1:58:40] doors I want you to imagine that you are
[1:58:43] walking behind the veil
[1:58:45] and that God is going to meet with us
[1:58:47] here as the word Goes Forth this week
[1:58:50] and as the Holy Ghost comes to say Amen
[1:58:52] I'm not kidding you
[1:58:55] I'm exhorting you as your pastor you
[1:58:58] open up those doors and imagine that
[1:59:01] you're walking in to a holy convocation
[1:59:04] a time that God has set apart to come
[1:59:07] Among Us
[1:59:08] and to show out
[1:59:12] so that when the week is over and the
[1:59:14] holy convocation is over and we're no
[1:59:17] longer dwelling in the mohead and we go
[1:59:19] back to our comfortable homes may it be
[1:59:22] that we can say of a surety I'll never
[1:59:25] be the same I have met with the Lord in
[1:59:29] an unusual and sacred way why because
[1:59:33] you you put intention and purpose and
[1:59:36] confidence in coming
[1:59:39] you didn't just say oh another camp
[1:59:41] meeting
[1:59:44] you know the Lord was talking to me this
[1:59:46] week
[1:59:47] about what Revival would look like in a
[1:59:49] local assembly
[1:59:51] if we were to really break out into
[1:59:53] something that would cause great
[1:59:56] deliverances among us because we still
[1:59:58] believe that God wants to revive his own
[2:00:01] and we know that Revival is not a
[2:00:03] corporate event it's an individual event
[2:00:05] but you get a bunch of people together
[2:00:07] who are experiencing a a personal
[2:00:09] Revival
[2:00:11] and and it's contagious it becomes an
[2:00:15] atmosphere shift over the ground and
[2:00:18] over the sanctuary and over our over
[2:00:20] everything we do let me tell you
[2:00:21] something when you enter in and I'm just
[2:00:23] going to ask you to wake up those of you
[2:00:25] that are sleeping I don't want to I
[2:00:27] don't want to be I want to be real nice
[2:00:30] but I just would like you very much to
[2:00:32] be awake for this I know that we can
[2:00:34] sometimes absorb while we're sleeping
[2:00:36] but I just feel like I've spent a lot of
[2:00:38] effort here
[2:00:41] and I would just like for you to show
[2:00:43] just that little bit of extra something
[2:00:45] I'm not talking to the elders I'm not
[2:00:47] talking to the seniors
[2:00:49] I'm not talking to those who who their
[2:00:51] sleep is interrupted at night
[2:00:54] I'm talking about those who can
[2:00:56] certainly program yourself here just a
[2:00:58] moment
[2:00:59] because I want you to be one of the ones
[2:01:02] I want our young men and our young women
[2:01:05] to be some of the ones who say this
[2:01:07] isn't just going to be another week of
[2:01:08] meetings
[2:01:11] Casey's posting I can't wait I'm I'm
[2:01:13] looking forward to what God's going to
[2:01:15] do for me at camp meeting and that's
[2:01:18] already getting the right kind of vibe I
[2:01:20] don't want to say Vibe and you think I
[2:01:22] mean something strange but the right
[2:01:24] kind of
[2:01:27] I started to say Groove that sounds
[2:01:28] worse
[2:01:31] sphere
[2:01:33] I'll be holy the right kind of
[2:01:35] atmosphere moving I believe if we would
[2:01:38] look at every it'd be great if we could
[2:01:40] look to every Sunday with that kind of
[2:01:42] enthusiasm
[2:01:43] but right now I'm just trying to I I've
[2:01:45] been pondering all week long what would
[2:01:47] it look like
[2:01:49] what what did it look like if something
[2:01:51] like that broke out Among Us and and we
[2:01:53] were here to midnight every night
[2:01:58] when God shows up
[2:02:00] services that normally end at nine go on
[2:02:03] till past ten when God's in the house
[2:02:06] and when people begin to worship they
[2:02:08] might even go into the 11 hour
[2:02:10] and might break the 12th hour it's not
[2:02:13] some kind of contest we're not trying to
[2:02:15] see how long we can be here
[2:02:17] but we're just saying your life may be
[2:02:21] inconvenience just a little bit if you
[2:02:23] ever get the answer to what you're
[2:02:25] praying for
[2:02:26] so be careful what you pray
[2:02:28] I want real Deliverance to Break Out
[2:02:30] Among Us do you
[2:02:37] is that why you come in 30 minutes after
[2:02:39] we start
[2:02:42] in case we stay 30 minutes longer than
[2:02:44] normal
[2:02:47] I got to thinking and I thought some who
[2:02:49] complained some who go AWOL
[2:02:53] some who go missing when it comes time
[2:02:57] to to bring a casserole
[2:03:02] I knew it was going to get quiet I
[2:03:04] anticipated this
[2:03:07] can't get response don't know where they
[2:03:10] are don't know what they're doing and
[2:03:13] when I think of people like that and I
[2:03:14] mean people who habitually are that way
[2:03:16] who make no effort doesn't matter how
[2:03:19] dirty the church gets doesn't matter how
[2:03:21] big the weeds are
[2:03:23] I know it's going to be quiet
[2:03:27] I I'm the only one that can preach like
[2:03:29] this here brother Greeley can hit at it
[2:03:32] but it's my risk
[2:03:36] my resp it's not anybody else's
[2:03:37] responsibility
[2:03:39] to bring correction to the house the
[2:03:42] Bible said we must show the house to the
[2:03:44] house I'm putting a mirror up here don't
[2:03:47] just pray Lord let us have a breakout
[2:03:49] Revival and a great outpouring of
[2:03:51] Deliverance if you're not willing
[2:03:55] to be inconvenienced a little bit
[2:03:59] your everyday life to have a move a
[2:04:03] sovereign move of God a real convocation
[2:04:07] with God that goes beyond the weak
[2:04:11] it would require that there is some
[2:04:14] rearranging in our life
[2:04:17] we might have to give up some of our
[2:04:19] Hobbies
[2:04:21] we might even have to miss some of our
[2:04:24] entertainments
[2:04:25] we might have to make more casseroles
[2:04:28] than we think we can possibly stand even
[2:04:31] you who are a little sickly are a little
[2:04:33] weak you might have to come and dust the
[2:04:35] corner
[2:04:37] and do it in Jesus name
[2:04:40] that's how you get through it help me
[2:04:43] somebody we do it in Jesus name
[2:04:47] those who show up to eat but don't show
[2:04:50] up to work those who show up to eat or
[2:04:53] to or to celebrate but don't show up to
[2:04:56] pray
[2:04:57] your life may have to be arranged if God
[2:05:02] were to come and answer our prayers
[2:05:06] get ready
[2:05:13] [Applause]
[2:05:21] God said I'll take care of you
[2:05:23] in in Exodus 34 24 and then I'm going to
[2:05:26] read something from the prophet
[2:05:28] Exodus 34 24 for I will cast out the
[2:05:31] Nations before you shut up excuse me
[2:05:35] excuse me
[2:05:37] who
[2:05:38] for I will cast out the Nations before
[2:05:40] you and enlarge your borders
[2:05:53] any good somebody tell me how good he is
[2:05:59] oh he's good
[2:06:01] he's so good
[2:06:04] I wanted to behave today
[2:06:10] Hallelujah
[2:06:16] thank you Lord
[2:06:22] Satan wants to bind you
[2:06:26] he wants to box you in
[2:06:29] he wants you to get used to church as
[2:06:31] usual
[2:06:33] that's why I have to I just have to
[2:06:35] refuse a church order from the Branham
[2:06:37] Tabernacle
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:41] I don't believe it was ever said or
[2:06:43] preached with the intention of boxing
[2:06:46] people in
[2:06:47] I believe it was set to be some kind of
[2:06:50] example of how you start
[2:06:53] you don't have to say anything the whole
[2:06:55] concept of just singing three songs gets
[2:06:57] on my last nerve
[2:06:59] what if what if God what if you've got
[2:07:01] an anointed worship leader
[2:07:04] who prayed who actually prayed about
[2:07:05] what they're saying
[2:07:07] and who said we better do one more
[2:07:10] somebody said we've been singing that
[2:07:12] one 10 minutes what if the leader feels
[2:07:14] like we ought to sing it five more
[2:07:17] you don't want to be boxed in
[2:07:21] I noticed that message churches are
[2:07:22] allowing people to jump and shout and
[2:07:25] dance at the end of the service what if
[2:07:26] God wants to show up in the worship
[2:07:28] before the preaching
[2:07:31] why don't we say I don't want to be
[2:07:32] boxed in
[2:07:36] I don't want anything to shut me in
[2:07:39] I want God to break out
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:41] on May the 30th I wrote this
[2:07:44] I didn't intend to ever I don't know if
[2:07:46] I was ever going to bring it to you
[2:07:49] I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings
[2:07:55] some of the young people were
[2:07:58] playing volleyball
[2:08:00] having a good time
[2:08:02] but they couldn't agree on what was
[2:08:04] inbounds and out of bounds
[2:08:07] you know there's a great key to that
[2:08:09] it's a spiritual application
[2:08:12] keep your eyes open
[2:08:15] don't let anything if that's your
[2:08:17] responsibility
[2:08:20] you mean you see what I mean if you're
[2:08:22] if you're the line judge is that what
[2:08:24] they call them
[2:08:29] you ought to get in there and squint
[2:08:34] you ought to make sure that nobody
[2:08:37] hollering nobody's screaming nobody back
[2:08:40] talking smack talking front talking
[2:08:46] I'm getting loose this morning ain't I
[2:08:49] just follow your position if your
[2:08:51] position is to see whether
[2:08:55] it's and so some of the young Brothers
[2:08:56] there they they wanted to fix it so that
[2:08:59] it would be a little bit easier they
[2:09:01] thought maybe they would they would cut
[2:09:02] out some fights
[2:09:04] and some disagreements because sometimes
[2:09:06] people go home mad I know it's hard for
[2:09:08] you to believe
[2:09:10] it even happens in my family a lot
[2:09:15] now I won't apologize to you I'm sorry
[2:09:17] that you ever see it
[2:09:19] because there's nothing that goes on out
[2:09:21] there that's near as important
[2:09:25] that's what goes on in here
[2:09:27] I'd let it go if I were you I'd grow up
[2:09:30] I'd let it go
[2:09:32] if you think somebody's cheating not let
[2:09:34] it go if you think somebody's doing
[2:09:36] something on purpose I'd let it go
[2:09:39] I don't want to preach on that
[2:09:44] oh
[2:09:48] did that sound a little Jerry Clower
[2:09:51] and I said oh
[2:09:57] so some of the little brothers they said
[2:09:59] we'll I mean I don't know I wouldn't
[2:10:01] hear but they said we'll just put some
[2:10:03] boundaries here so that everybody can
[2:10:05] see the actual because the lines were
[2:10:08] faded and it seems like a very
[2:10:10] legitimate and good idea I I even think
[2:10:13] in my mind it's a good idea and so they
[2:10:16] took some nails
[2:10:18] and uh
[2:10:20] and they took some string
[2:10:24] don't go nowhere unless you have to
[2:10:26] I'll be back
[2:10:37] I'm coming
[2:10:46] you can
[2:10:48] I saved it
[2:10:49] you'll know why I did a minute
[2:10:52] it's funny go ahead and laugh now
[2:10:53] because you can't laugh in a minute
[2:10:57] they took these nails
[2:11:00] I mean I wouldn't drive Nails in Asphalt
[2:11:02] knowing cars are going to be around
[2:11:05] but that's not the point
[2:11:07] these say H3 on them
[2:11:11] they took these nails and they put the
[2:11:13] corners out
[2:11:15] and they took this
[2:11:18] beautiful cord which you can't get back
[2:11:22] I want to hold on to it if you don't
[2:11:23] mind
[2:11:27] and I drove on to the campground
[2:11:30] and God spoke he began to speak to me
[2:11:34] now I know that
[2:11:36] he'll talk to you if you listen
[2:11:41] there was a spirit there's something
[2:11:42] spiritual going on
[2:11:45] and when something spiritual goes on any
[2:11:48] of us can come under that
[2:11:51] are you with me the good the bad or the
[2:11:54] ugly well Jonathan's been around long
[2:11:56] enough to know he's seen these kinds of
[2:11:58] things brother Greeley has seen these
[2:12:00] kinds of things
[2:12:01] and you just can sometimes come under an
[2:12:04] anointing that's you don't even know
[2:12:06] what you're doing
[2:12:07] you just feel like you're doing the most
[2:12:08] logical thing and there's not a brother
[2:12:11] there that would have done anything
[2:12:12] wrong there was not a brother there that
[2:12:15] would have done anything without
[2:12:17] Authority or or to show or to take
[2:12:19] something away from the leadership it
[2:12:21] was it was simply
[2:12:24] to show you where the boundaries are
[2:12:26] you understand that
[2:12:28] so if you know who all then you just
[2:12:30] forget that and don't ever mention it
[2:12:31] again
[2:12:32] but God spoke to me
[2:12:34] unexpectedly
[2:12:36] I'm losing my breath just now
[2:12:40] because this is so serious at the moment
[2:12:42] it was so serious May 30th is when I
[2:12:45] wrote this down the spirit of God said
[2:12:47] they are using
[2:12:49] illegitimate Authority
[2:12:51] to form
[2:12:54] illegal boundaries
[2:12:57] tear them down
[2:13:03] now that wasn't all he said that that's
[2:13:05] I only got part of it there I just don't
[2:13:07] know me
[2:13:08] that there was only part of it there
[2:13:10] brother Greeley if you happen to
[2:13:11] remember it was two parts and for some
[2:13:13] reason I only got one part down
[2:13:19] illegal
[2:13:24] Authority
[2:13:25] for legal
[2:13:27] boundaries and then and then
[2:13:32] illegitimate then illegitimate authority
[2:13:35] to form illegal boundaries tear them
[2:13:39] down I shook
[2:13:43] nobody put them there to form boundaries
[2:13:46] in the natural
[2:13:49] but in the spirit
[2:13:51] it forms something
[2:13:54] and then the spirit of the Lord took me
[2:13:56] to 10 acres
[2:14:00] that had joined this church
[2:14:02] that we tried so desperately to purchase
[2:14:06] and they offered him to us and then
[2:14:09] wouldn't let us no matter how we went up
[2:14:11] to meet the to meet the demand
[2:14:14] they eventually then sent word through a
[2:14:17] real estate agent
[2:14:18] that they were just going to hold on to
[2:14:21] it for a while
[2:14:22] no access to that property except
[2:14:25] through this property
[2:14:27] you're going to have to drive through
[2:14:29] this property to get to that property
[2:14:32] and yet you won't amend for it and then
[2:14:35] I saw I saw the connection
[2:14:38] I saw it in the spirit that the enemy
[2:14:41] was trying to use illegitimate authority
[2:14:43] to to to border us does that I hope I
[2:14:47] don't throw you crazy
[2:14:49] to put us in boundaries
[2:14:52] you'll you'll always be 60-something
[2:14:54] Acres instead of the 10 if you'll
[2:14:57] remember there was an announcement made
[2:14:58] in service one night that said we by the
[2:15:01] grace of God we now have 70 acres for
[2:15:04] the Eagles Refuge Campground and then
[2:15:07] when we tried to buy it it wouldn't and
[2:15:09] I realized this is not a this is not a
[2:15:11] flesh that there was nobody called you
[2:15:14] understand I I wished I wasn't doing
[2:15:17] this with visitors here
[2:15:19] but the whole world's watching some of
[2:15:22] them some of them
[2:15:25] in in in in the natural mind you would
[2:15:27] make no connection at all but God is
[2:15:29] just saying
[2:15:31] I want to have it's my authority
[2:15:35] that establishes the boundaries of this
[2:15:38] piece of property that I've set apart
[2:15:40] remember remember that a MOAB can be a
[2:15:43] chosen place
[2:15:45] and I don't mean this is some blessed
[2:15:47] area for the world to come to it's my
[2:15:50] blessed area it's your blessed area
[2:15:53] it's what God has given us to serve him
[2:15:56] with I'm not announcing it as a
[2:15:58] lighthouse for the world I'm not saying
[2:16:01] you got to come and join us I'm just
[2:16:03] saying as as a vision for this house it
[2:16:07] must be God who dictates the boundaries
[2:16:10] of this property we must not let the
[2:16:13] devil tell us how big we are
[2:16:15] or how small we are
[2:16:17] we must allow God to make the decision
[2:16:21] because every action in the natural is
[2:16:24] connected just about just about to
[2:16:27] Something in the spirit
[2:16:30] you hear Brother random turning that
[2:16:31] thing around sometimes he says the
[2:16:33] spiritual tap's the natural
[2:16:35] sometimes he says the natural types of
[2:16:37] spiritual you say which is it both
[2:16:41] it depends on where it happens first
[2:16:44] sometimes it's decided in heaven first
[2:16:46] and has to be brought to the Earth
[2:16:47] sometimes somebody on the earth catches
[2:16:50] the mind of Heaven
[2:16:53] and proclaims it
[2:16:56] with confidence
[2:16:58] and Heaven goes to action if you
[2:17:00] intercessors understand that I want you
[2:17:02] to praise the Lord
[2:17:04] I want you to praise him
[2:17:06] [Music]
[2:17:07] for I
[2:17:10] I gotta hurry for I will cast you out
[2:17:14] the Nations before you for I will cast
[2:17:17] out the Nations before you
[2:17:26] and
[2:17:31] so you're not going to come you Spirit
[2:17:33] of hell
[2:17:35] and box us in
[2:17:37] brother if I want to dance before the
[2:17:39] preaching I'm going to dance
[2:17:41] as long as I don't interrupt the
[2:17:42] preaching
[2:17:44] and if the preacher's dancing while he
[2:17:46] preaches maybe you can do I don't know
[2:17:48] maybe you could
[2:17:50] we've come too far in this thing
[2:17:54] to get so starchy
[2:17:59] oh I had a good text today
[2:18:02] I ought not to tell from who I don't
[2:18:04] think I will but I had a good text from
[2:18:06] somebody who's who is uh has relatives
[2:18:09] here in the service
[2:18:11] but they don't come to church here
[2:18:14] because of a little text that I sent out
[2:18:16] Friday about
[2:18:17] sometimes people will say things I
[2:18:19] recently had an email from somebody who
[2:18:21] said you know I see so much noise I hear
[2:18:24] so much noise in your services I see so
[2:18:27] much jumping around it just looks like a
[2:18:29] bunch of chaos to me and I just can't
[2:18:31] imagine Jesus don't you just love it
[2:18:34] when people speak for Jesus
[2:18:37] who hadn't been with him for years
[2:18:41] they know so much about him that they
[2:18:43] left him in the corner
[2:18:47] they're so used to his presence they
[2:18:50] just left him in the corner with dirty
[2:18:52] feet
[2:18:54] don't you start washing his feet if you
[2:18:57] do they'll get upset
[2:18:59] and so somebody said I just can't
[2:19:01] imagine Jesus dancing
[2:19:12] I know how the message people love to
[2:19:14] quote that Jesus wasn't a Jew
[2:19:17] and that's right
[2:19:19] because his blood came from God his
[2:19:21] father not from his Earthly mother or
[2:19:23] father but let me tell you something he
[2:19:26] grew up in a Jewish Home
[2:19:28] he worshiped God as a Jew
[2:19:32] he understood the Passover like a Jew
[2:19:34] would
[2:19:35] he slept in a Suka like a Jew would
[2:19:37] during Tabernacles come on and I want
[2:19:39] you to know that dancing is so much a
[2:19:41] part of of the Hebrew Church
[2:19:45] not just the Jewish people but the
[2:19:47] Hebrew Church the one you read about in
[2:19:48] the book of Hebrews that nobody even
[2:19:50] found it necessary to mention music much
[2:19:53] in the New Testament
[2:19:54] because it was already such a part of
[2:19:56] worship
[2:19:57] and everyone knew that when Jews came to
[2:20:00] Christ they didn't give up their
[2:20:01] rejoicing and they didn't give up their
[2:20:04] dancing
[2:20:06] and so you just might be surprised what
[2:20:08] I think but I believe that Jesus
[2:20:10] probably celebrated
[2:20:14] at weddings
[2:20:16] and in other Jewish holy times with a
[2:20:19] little bit of dancing
[2:20:21] [Music]
[2:20:22] I have no scripture that he did
[2:20:25] you have no scripture that he didn't
[2:20:29] so save your emails for somebody that
[2:20:31] cares
[2:20:32] really really but here's what I notice
[2:20:36] we don't have a scripture that says he
[2:20:38] danced or shouted or jumped or rejoiced
[2:20:40] but we got lots of scriptures that tell
[2:20:43] us that everyone he touched
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:20:50] rejoiced
[2:20:52] everyone in touch came out of their
[2:20:55] boxes
[2:20:56] everyone in touch got out of their
[2:20:58] boundaries
[2:21:00] oh everybody moved around
[2:21:03] walking and leaping and praising them
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:12] Hallelujah
[2:21:14] Hallelujah
[2:21:17] he takes us out of our comfort zone
[2:21:21] he gives us something to Rejoice about
[2:21:25] he gives us something to celebrate
[2:21:28] [Applause]
[2:21:30] oh Hallelujah
[2:21:33] [Applause]
[2:21:35] Hallelujah
[2:21:37] [Applause]
[2:21:41] everyone
[2:21:44] I'm going to read this don't tell him
[2:21:46] he said good morning thank you for
[2:21:48] sending these out every Friday I so
[2:21:50] enjoy them I do believe Jesus danced
[2:21:55] he said David was a man after God's Own
[2:21:58] Heart he was a dancing man
[2:22:02] don't move the camera
[2:22:04] don't don't go on the crowd
[2:22:06] because I want to say this to these
[2:22:08] three children sitting right there in
[2:22:10] the back
[2:22:11] it was your granddaddy who sent this to
[2:22:13] me
[2:22:16] I don't want to call him out for doing
[2:22:18] it but I want them to know who it is
[2:22:19] don't put the camera on them
[2:22:21] he said I do believe Jesus danced David
[2:22:24] was a man after God's Own Heart and he
[2:22:26] was a dancing man he said I know you
[2:22:29] know all the scriptures on dance and
[2:22:30] worship but a scripture came to me this
[2:22:32] morning John 21 25 what does that say
[2:22:35] somebody get it I didn't look it up
[2:22:37] we're going to go home after a while
[2:22:40] John 21 this blessed me I tell you about
[2:22:43] danced in the bedroom this morning
[2:22:52] oh
[2:22:54] what a good verse
[2:23:01] so he danced in the books that weren't
[2:23:03] written
[2:23:05] I would rather believe that he settled
[2:23:10] than to believe
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:13] the Mariah system he came to Buck that
[2:23:16] dead dry system he came to turn over the
[2:23:19] tables of a dead dry religious system
[2:23:25] and he said also Pastor Jesse Smith said
[2:23:28] something about Jesus danced in his
[2:23:30] logos
[2:23:31] that got me so excited I want to share
[2:23:34] with you because I know what and how you
[2:23:35] believe about dance and worship I just
[2:23:37] knew there had to be an answer about
[2:23:39] Jesus dancing why would why would have
[2:23:42] such a why would we have such a desire
[2:23:44] to do so if our husband didn't
[2:23:47] he said excuse my uneducated Topic in
[2:23:50] word and I know you're familiar with
[2:23:51] Jesse Smith I'll send you the link I
[2:23:53] think you will uh like glean and expand
[2:23:56] on it and like the text and I did see it
[2:23:59] but I didn't watch it I had already seen
[2:24:00] it but he put out a YouTube video uh see
[2:24:04] it right there Bible teaching on dancing
[2:24:06] dance a Bible teaching on dancing and
[2:24:08] William branham's dancing
[2:24:10] so so you can go
[2:24:12] I don't I can't say I endorse everything
[2:24:14] on it I don't know I I didn't hear it
[2:24:16] all but I'm not afraid of you listening
[2:24:18] to it watching it
[2:24:19] if it'll encourage you to get out of
[2:24:21] your box
[2:24:22] if it'll remind you that God wants us to
[2:24:25] expand our border sometime
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] go put my scripture back up we got to go
[2:24:30] home now
[2:24:31] for I will cast out the Nations before
[2:24:33] you and enlarge your borders
[2:24:38] so devil just keep now I'm not talking
[2:24:40] Brothers I'm not calling you devils
[2:24:44] but I want to say the devil just keep
[2:24:46] your nails in string
[2:24:49] just keep your 10 acres cause before
[2:24:51] God's through you may end up having to
[2:24:53] give it to somebody
[2:24:58] you never know what God will do
[2:25:00] and if he don't you know what he'll do
[2:25:02] he'll drop the money here
[2:25:04] he'll drop the money here to purchase it
[2:25:07] because I believe we're supposed to be
[2:25:09] 70 acres and I believe he'll make a way
[2:25:11] for us to be in his time but what this
[2:25:14] taught me was was bigger than I could
[2:25:16] even expound on I can't even teach you
[2:25:18] because I don't fully understand it to
[2:25:20] be able to teach you but the smallest
[2:25:22] action
[2:25:27] for I will cast out the Nations before
[2:25:29] you and in larger borders neither shall
[2:25:31] any man this is so powerful I can't even
[2:25:34] preach on this I don't have time but
[2:25:35] this is so powerful neither shall any
[2:25:37] man desire and molest your land when you
[2:25:41] go up to appear before the Lord your God
[2:25:43] three times in the year do you know what
[2:25:46] God is saying to the Israelite I want
[2:25:48] all you men to go three times a year and
[2:25:50] don't worry about your stuff
[2:25:53] cause I the Lord God will watch over
[2:25:56] your home and your family and your
[2:25:59] animals and your crops you just obey me
[2:26:04] that's what he's saying
[2:26:06] can you imagine God saying you go and
[2:26:09] I'll stay with the stuff and yet I'll
[2:26:11] meet you there
[2:26:14] the God we serve
[2:26:17] he can be with the staff and in the
[2:26:20] convocation
[2:26:25] when I first met sister Nancy in
[2:26:27] Jerusalem
[2:26:28] she began to tell me stories
[2:26:31] about how how the young people who went
[2:26:34] from Calvary Pentecostal Tabernacle in
[2:26:37] Richmond Virginia
[2:26:38] over 50 years ago who went there to
[2:26:41] Israel to start in Jerusalem a prayer
[2:26:44] meeting and she said God kept speaking
[2:26:46] to them in the gifts and saying to them
[2:26:49] don't worry about home
[2:26:52] don't worry about the things you've left
[2:26:54] behind if your own assignment in
[2:26:56] Jerusalem I will take care
[2:26:59] if you're obeying me
[2:27:02] don't even worry
[2:27:04] and the Lord also spoke among them and
[2:27:06] said don't criticize the land don't
[2:27:08] criticize even things that are easy to
[2:27:11] criticize
[2:27:13] don't criticize the parking tickets
[2:27:15] just expect them they've got a big army
[2:27:17] to pay for
[2:27:18] they help they help
[2:27:21] they help Finance the army with parking
[2:27:23] tickets
[2:27:25] so we wouldn't let any of the brothers
[2:27:26] complain just pay them
[2:27:30] even when I even when I was meeting the
[2:27:33] mayor of Jerusalem at the mayor's
[2:27:35] reception in a in a stark brand new
[2:27:38] white shirt
[2:27:39] and I'm walking toward the reception and
[2:27:41] it starts raining
[2:27:43] and the hamsa has been blowing in from
[2:27:45] the from the desert and the air is red
[2:27:49] just like our dirt here
[2:27:52] the air was red because of that wind
[2:27:55] that blew off the desert and when it
[2:27:57] started raining
[2:28:00] I looked down at my shirt and I looked
[2:28:02] like some kind of red Dalmatian or
[2:28:04] something
[2:28:05] I had red spots and dots all over my
[2:28:08] clothes and here I'm going to meet the
[2:28:09] mayor
[2:28:10] and I thought I'm going to use this as
[2:28:12] an opportunity to tell him how glad I am
[2:28:14] to be here red dots and all
[2:28:17] he got the biggest he got the biggest
[2:28:20] laugh out of that he said oh a man after
[2:28:22] my heart somebody who loves Jerusalem
[2:28:24] like I do
[2:28:26] he said I've learned I've learned and
[2:28:28] evidently you've learned to give God
[2:28:30] thanks
[2:28:31] to give Hashem thanks in all things and
[2:28:34] just be glad you get to be here for
[2:28:35] however amount of time you get to be
[2:28:37] here and sometimes the complaining
[2:28:39] really blocks the blessing
[2:28:41] now let me read you something here that
[2:28:43] brother Branham said now I've got a I've
[2:28:45] got to wind down I'm on page four of 27.
[2:28:50] paragraph 453. So old man and old woman
[2:28:53] so oh man you have to you have to look
[2:28:57] at the context to know whether it means
[2:28:59] man or men
[2:29:01] so old man an old woman don't you be
[2:29:05] discouraged
[2:29:10] even in my office when somebody says
[2:29:12] this morning
[2:29:13] don't you just love old people
[2:29:18] and Ben says of course he does he is one
[2:29:22] talked about me
[2:29:24] see David's anointing was getting over
[2:29:26] on Ben
[2:29:28] being used to it and never talk to me
[2:29:30] that way
[2:29:33] so old man and old woman don't you be
[2:29:36] discouraged
[2:29:39] if you are a representation up here
[2:29:43] in this attribute of God he's preaching
[2:29:46] future home
[2:29:48] my good friend brother Gerald Cleveland
[2:29:50] is sitting in the audience this night
[2:29:54] if you have it
[2:29:57] if you're represented here
[2:29:59] you cannot
[2:30:03] he's drawn out he's drawn out the city
[2:30:06] he's drawn out the pyramid
[2:30:09] he's placing those attributes on the
[2:30:12] pyramid
[2:30:13] he said go back I'm sorry charity
[2:30:17] if you're represented here you cannot
[2:30:21] you're in the eternal
[2:30:24] now what did he just say don't be
[2:30:26] discouraged old man old woman
[2:30:29] if you're represented here in God's
[2:30:32] Eternal City
[2:30:34] you're not old
[2:30:36] Ben
[2:30:38] I'm not old
[2:30:42] I am eternal
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:30:45] and listen what he said and if you've
[2:30:47] crossed from that seventh day
[2:30:51] into the eighth
[2:30:53] you got into the Eternal by the baptism
[2:30:56] of the Holy Spirit
[2:31:00] the one that precedes the Capstone
[2:31:05] the one that's bigger than a Feeling
[2:31:08] the one that seals you in
[2:31:11] it's not a sensation
[2:31:13] it's a ceiling that we're looking for
[2:31:16] he said you got into the Eternal by the
[2:31:19] baptism of the Holy Spirit you're
[2:31:21] included in this now if you're just
[2:31:23] trusting upon a sensation or jumping up
[2:31:26] and down or I do this I keep my seventh
[2:31:30] day
[2:31:31] I don't eat meat
[2:31:34] and things like that that's going to
[2:31:37] perish anyhow see
[2:31:40] now I could add some things to that
[2:31:44] if you're just trusting in your belt
[2:31:46] buckle
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:31:51] or because you're clean shaven
[2:31:55] you know a lot of extra things has been
[2:31:58] added to the message
[2:32:01] if you're trusting in any of that
[2:32:04] that's going to perish
[2:32:07] but this is the Eternal sea this is the
[2:32:11] the Eternal he said the feast
[2:32:16] after
[2:32:18] the feast
[2:32:20] of Tabernacles
[2:32:23] now there's only seven Feasts
[2:32:27] there's only seven feasts mentioned in
[2:32:29] the Bible
[2:32:30] brother Branham is preaching what the
[2:32:32] scripture preached he's preaching that
[2:32:34] the Feast of Tabernacles goes all the
[2:32:36] way through to the Millennium because
[2:32:39] it's eternal
[2:32:40] he's putting us in the eighth day but
[2:32:42] there's not an eighth Feast unless we
[2:32:44] called it the Millennium and we can do
[2:32:47] that we can do that as partakers of
[2:32:50] Grace we can look back and certainly say
[2:32:53] but I showed you the list of the feasts
[2:32:56] that are mentioned in the Bible and
[2:32:58] they're seven but he said this is
[2:33:00] eternal the feast after the Feast of
[2:33:02] Tabernacles it goes on and watch what he
[2:33:04] said
[2:33:05] the Feast of Tabernacles was the last
[2:33:08] Feast the seventh feast
[2:33:11] it in context great
[2:33:15] isn't it great to read more than one
[2:33:17] paragraph
[2:33:18] because look according how he qualifies
[2:33:20] and explains what he's meaning he said
[2:33:23] we are worshiping now
[2:33:27] under the Feast of the Tabernacles
[2:33:31] the seventh Church age
[2:33:36] in the millennium
[2:33:41] will be
[2:33:45] not an eight feast
[2:33:47] will be under the Feast of Tabernacles
[2:33:51] again
[2:33:54] in the seventh day
[2:33:58] which would be the eighth
[2:34:02] but then after the seventh day
[2:34:07] we have a holy convocation Eighth Day
[2:34:12] and go back into the
[2:34:16] eternal
[2:34:20] how
[2:34:22] read that line
[2:34:26] by the Eternal one that came and
[2:34:30] redeemed us and taken us back letting us
[2:34:33] recognize what
[2:34:36] that we are a part of this now how do
[2:34:42] you know you're apart
[2:34:43] because that the word of the hour the
[2:34:47] promise of the day what is it a
[2:34:49] restoration back to the first day
[2:35:01] it's the same thing he said about the
[2:35:04] gospel going back to the Jews
[2:35:06] he said it started in Jerusalem and it
[2:35:09] moved West
[2:35:11] it came through Jeffersonville
[2:35:14] it came through Tucson the move of God
[2:35:18] Azusa Street preceded that
[2:35:20] and then what does it do it doesn't hit
[2:35:23] California and turn around and go back
[2:35:25] to Jerusalem that way
[2:35:28] because brother random knew the Earth
[2:35:29] was round
[2:35:31] he said it keeps going you don't drop
[2:35:33] off the edge out there like some people
[2:35:34] would have you to think
[2:35:36] it just circles right back around and
[2:35:39] guess what it is
[2:35:41] he said Korea
[2:35:45] I don't know why he singles out Korea
[2:35:47] but he talks about Asia but he calls
[2:35:49] Korea by name he caused Japan by name
[2:35:54] isn't it powerful to know that God
[2:35:56] doesn't forget about Asia
[2:35:59] if it only went from Jerusalem
[2:36:02] to California back to Jerusalem you miss
[2:36:05] some folks
[2:36:07] so he said it goes all the way back
[2:36:08] around and it comes through Asia where
[2:36:11] God is moving I want you to know God's
[2:36:13] moving he's moving right now in China
[2:36:16] in unprecedented ways
[2:36:19] the message is growing even by Leaps and
[2:36:22] Bounds in underground China
[2:36:25] because God's getting a people ready to
[2:36:28] sustain the last move
[2:36:31] and then word of the Gospel go brother
[2:36:33] Bantam said right back to the Jews
[2:36:36] he said and they brought it to us and
[2:36:38] what do we do
[2:36:39] somehow we take it back to them what
[2:36:42] it's going to look like I don't exactly
[2:36:43] know but I'm standing on that promise
[2:36:46] I'm standing on that promise and I'm
[2:36:48] standing on every one of these
[2:36:50] every one of them
[2:36:52] now in the few minutes that I have left
[2:36:57] the Hebrew word for Tabernacle is sukkah
[2:37:01] say it
[2:37:03] we call the fee sakot it means a booth a
[2:37:06] HUD a covering the brothers didn't get
[2:37:07] ours up but I wish they would try to
[2:37:09] work that in because now the people are
[2:37:12] expecting it
[2:37:13] you restored it last year and now the
[2:37:15] people are expecting it up this year and
[2:37:17] we don't have it up here
[2:37:19] so maybe you'll consider doing that
[2:37:22] so the booth or a hint hint hint hint
[2:37:29] if you'll do it brother Daniel will feed
[2:37:31] you smoked chicken tonight
[2:37:36] yes 50 pounds you come come if you'll do
[2:37:40] that
[2:37:40] stand there and you watch to see if it
[2:37:43] makes it back
[2:37:45] if it don't then don't let any young
[2:37:46] male have any
[2:37:49] until they have gone and kept the feast
[2:37:53] and brought the brought the I'm just
[2:37:55] kidding
[2:37:56] David you can smile
[2:37:59] David feels led to lead the group with
[2:38:01] Josiah
[2:38:02] follow those men
[2:38:05] Hallelujah
[2:38:07] so the booth of the Suka was a temporary
[2:38:09] Dwelling Place
[2:38:10] historically it was to remind the people
[2:38:13] of their Exodus from Egypt every time
[2:38:15] you see that Booth sitting there not
[2:38:17] this morning
[2:38:19] because it's not sitting there
[2:38:21] but every time you look up and see it
[2:38:24] sitting there you ought to remember that
[2:38:26] you're a part of an exodus
[2:38:29] amen just like the children of Israel
[2:38:32] had their Exodus the bride in this day
[2:38:34] is having their Exodus
[2:38:36] somebody said it's finished oh no it's
[2:38:38] ongoing as long as somebody's coming out
[2:38:41] of a denominational system I say this is
[2:38:45] The Exodus
[2:38:46] [Applause]
[2:38:48] as long as somebody's coming out of man
[2:38:50] religion
[2:38:51] [Applause]
[2:38:53] I say when people are busting out of
[2:38:55] their own religion
[2:38:58] we're still in The Exodus
[2:39:01] and there's one more
[2:39:05] which we didn't just come out
[2:39:07] of Egypt to live out here in the
[2:39:10] wilderness
[2:39:11] we're crossing again
[2:39:13] we've got another River to take
[2:39:15] and then the Promised Land
[2:39:17] prophetically the Suka points toward the
[2:39:19] future of the Messiah of the Messiah age
[2:39:21] the millennium
[2:39:24] spiritually Asuka is supposed to remind
[2:39:26] us that we are but strangers and
[2:39:27] pilgrims on the earth this being a
[2:39:30] temporary Dwelling Place how many of you
[2:39:31] are thankful for that
[2:39:33] I see this sad little brother posting
[2:39:35] all the time on on Facebook
[2:39:38] who believes that the Rapture has
[2:39:40] already taken place
[2:39:42] and we're living in the millennium
[2:39:44] I feel so sorry for him
[2:39:49] he posts the quotes he's got it all
[2:39:51] figured out I feel so sorry for him
[2:39:54] can you imagine having to take this old
[2:39:56] body
[2:39:59] this old body can you imagine having to
[2:40:02] take this into a Thousand-Year reign
[2:40:05] well I don't feel very Victorious when I
[2:40:07] get up in the morning I have to pray to
[2:40:09] get Victorious can you imagine having to
[2:40:12] live a thousand years in an old body
[2:40:13] like the one you've got right now you
[2:40:15] can there's some things you just can't
[2:40:17] spiritualize to the point that you're
[2:40:19] out of reality
[2:40:20] we hadn't made it yet
[2:40:22] but I'm gonna make it hallelujah how
[2:40:25] many of you are going to make it with me
[2:40:28] I want the musicians to come
[2:40:33] Lord I want to preach this
[2:40:36] but I can't
[2:40:39] one of the one of the one of the names
[2:40:42] of the Feast of Tabernacles is the Feast
[2:40:44] of of unity
[2:40:51] and I was prepared to spend most of my
[2:40:53] time there but I didn't get there
[2:40:56] the Feast of unity
[2:41:00] it's the Feast of Oneness
[2:41:03] oh Hallelujah
[2:41:07] can I just read a few more verses and
[2:41:08] while they're getting ready
[2:41:10] John 17 11 and now I am no more in the
[2:41:13] world
[2:41:15] but these are in the world and I come to
[2:41:18] thee Holy Father keep through thine own
[2:41:21] name Those whom thou Hast given me
[2:41:24] that they may be one
[2:41:27] as we are
[2:41:29] the Feast of Tabernacles is a good time
[2:41:31] to celebrate our unity and Oneness with
[2:41:33] him
[2:41:34] verse 21-23 neither pray I for these
[2:41:38] alone
[2:41:48] sorry that must be I must have not put
[2:41:50] the whole verse
[2:41:54] do you have verse 22
[2:41:58] okay let's read let's go back and read
[2:42:00] 21 that doesn't seem right
[2:42:08] at the moment
[2:42:11] what verse that starts off neither pray
[2:42:13] after these alone
[2:42:15] I'm doing this more often you all pray
[2:42:17] for me what verse starts off neither
[2:42:19] pray after these alone but for them
[2:42:21] verse 20.
[2:42:23] verse 20 says neither pray I for these
[2:42:25] alone but for them also which Shall
[2:42:28] Believe on me through their word
[2:42:30] that they all may be one as you father
[2:42:33] art in me
[2:42:35] and I in thee that they also may be one
[2:42:39] in US
[2:42:40] that the world may believe
[2:42:42] that thou has sent me and the glory
[2:42:45] which you have given me I have given
[2:42:47] them
[2:42:49] does anybody believe you're one of them
[2:42:52] that they may be one even as we are one
[2:42:55] i in them you and me that they may be
[2:42:59] made perfect
[2:43:01] in one
[2:43:03] and that the world may know that you
[2:43:06] have sent me and has loved them as you
[2:43:08] has loved me
[2:43:10] the unity for which Jesus prayed and
[2:43:13] which the father so deeply desires is
[2:43:16] going to be fulfilled Our God will
[2:43:18] create it and it will be demonstrated
[2:43:21] through this remnant bride
[2:43:23] it is a Unity both inexpressible and
[2:43:28] exquisite
[2:43:29] Jesus said even as we are one and as
[2:43:34] surely as the father Tabernacles in the
[2:43:36] sun thinking through him speaking
[2:43:39] through him walking in him working with
[2:43:43] him so shall he dwell in the sons of God
[2:43:48] the Bride of Jesus Christ and remember
[2:43:52] First Corinthians 6 17 the last verse
[2:43:55] in the Amplified
[2:44:02] but the person this is the Amplified
[2:44:05] classic but the person who is United to
[2:44:09] the Lord
[2:44:11] the person who is United to the Lord are
[2:44:14] there any people like that here
[2:44:16] hello
[2:44:18] becomes
[2:44:24] to be joined to the Lord to have his
[2:44:26] holy spirit regenerating your Fallen
[2:44:29] human Spirit it joins you with the Lord
[2:44:31] and it's not two Spirits anymore
[2:44:34] his spirit and your spirit
[2:44:37] it's one spirit
[2:44:40] living inside of you
[2:44:42] this is one of the themes of Tabernacles
[2:44:45] this holy moed
[2:44:47] this holy convocation
[2:44:50] let's stand may God meet with us this
[2:44:52] week and every time we meet together in
[2:44:54] his name
[2:44:56] may he remind us
[2:44:59] of his desire to be one with us and may
[2:45:02] we prepare ourselves
[2:45:05] as sister Kathy sung this morning may we
[2:45:08] prepare ourselves to stand in the
[2:45:10] threshing floor
[2:45:12] and have everything that is not like him
[2:45:15] knocked off cut off
[2:45:17] sheared off
[2:45:19] May the dross fall in the threshing
[2:45:21] floor
[2:45:23] May the wind come and blow away the
[2:45:26] dross
[2:45:27] so that only the seed of God remain in
[2:45:29] US
[2:45:30] how many of you this is your desire
[2:45:32] cleanse us Lord
[2:45:35] make us your sanctuaries
[2:45:38] make us one with you Lord even as your
[2:45:41] word has said
[2:45:43] may we look at the Feast of Tabernacles
[2:45:46] a little differently than we have before
[2:45:47] may we see the present reality of it
[2:45:51] may we also be filled with anticipation
[2:45:54] for the fullness of it one day
[2:45:57] to live with you for a thousand years
[2:46:00] and that's only the beginning
[2:46:04] for after the honeymoon we have an
[2:46:06] eternity with you
[2:46:08] ruling and reigning with our Messiah
[2:46:10] with our bridegroom we're the lover of
[2:46:13] our soul we bless your name we worship
[2:46:17] you today Father minister to lives in
[2:46:21] these last few minutes of service today
[2:46:24] minister to lives
[2:46:28] draw us
[2:46:31] draw us into the sacredness of this
[2:46:35] moment
[2:46:40] let us see our value that's found in you
[2:46:45] that you would desire
[2:46:48] to meet with us
[2:46:51] behind the veil
[2:46:54] Lord that that tent
[2:46:57] that sukkah
[2:47:00] it reminds us of the Hupa
[2:47:04] it reminds us of the tallit that our
[2:47:07] brother back there is wearing
[2:47:10] it represents heaven
[2:47:14] is our young couples have married under
[2:47:17] it
[2:47:18] it reminds us of that tent
[2:47:22] the one that so many have been looking
[2:47:25] for a natural fulfillment of
[2:47:28] but you can't always expect to interpret
[2:47:31] something in the spirit
[2:47:33] with natural terms
[2:47:36] because sometimes spiritual visions are
[2:47:39] just that they have spiritual
[2:47:41] fulfillments
[2:47:43] to be one with you
[2:47:46] to spend the night in the Hoopa with the
[2:47:49] bridegroom
[2:47:53] drawing up the curtains around us
[2:47:57] shutting out the world
[2:47:59] shutting out the Temptations and
[2:48:02] distractions of the world around us
[2:48:05] forgetting our griefs forgetting our
[2:48:07] problems for getting our heart aches
[2:48:10] and becoming one with you in spirit
[2:48:14] that little bride coming out of the
[2:48:17] other side of that tent
[2:48:19] with thus saith the Lord in her mouth
[2:48:26] speaking to the weather
[2:48:29] speaking creating
[2:48:31] with her mouth
[2:48:35] speaking tumors
[2:48:37] be gone
[2:48:40] speaking salvation
[2:48:42] to those who are caught up in their
[2:48:45] silliness
[2:48:48] oh I thank you Jesus
[2:48:51] for that time with you

[3:06:56] we really are leaving
[3:06:58] but I have I have a great announcement
[3:07:00] to make a very beautiful announcement
[3:07:04] a precious announcement
[3:07:06] the church is growing again
[3:07:09] isn't that wonderful
[3:07:12] brother Austin and sister Anna Christine
[3:07:15] want to announce to you all that they
[3:07:18] are go and Gwen
[3:07:21] that they are going to have a baby
[3:07:25] [Applause]
[3:07:34] praise the Lord
[3:07:37] in that wonderful
[3:07:40] it's so wonderful
[3:07:42] I was so happy when they told me here
[3:07:45] we've been just holding on to it until
[3:07:47] the right time we're just so thrilled
[3:07:50] for them and so thankful for them these
[3:07:53] things usually come in threes or fours
[3:07:58] so we're on the search to see who three
[3:08:01] will be or or four we'll we'll take four
[3:08:04] we know that uh the Allah knows I know I
[3:08:07] know I know sometimes you all look at
[3:08:09] sister hope and wonder how she can
[3:08:11] handle a third one
[3:08:12] but you just watch
[3:08:18] she may not always feel like it but she
[3:08:20] was born for the job
[3:08:22] sister Anna Christine you were born for
[3:08:24] the job I believe that I believe that I
[3:08:27] believe that I believe there are a few
[3:08:29] more seed that's got to get here
[3:08:32] I have a strange Doctrine I thought of
[3:08:34] it this morning I just don't believe
[3:08:37] that that uh that God gives uncertified
[3:08:40] seed to his seed
[3:08:43] I believe like the prophet said we have
[3:08:45] every right to claim our children they
[3:08:48] may not know what you know they may not
[3:08:50] care about what you care about
[3:08:54] but it's God who determines
[3:08:56] it's God who determines what little
[3:08:58] Spirit goes into what little body he's
[3:09:01] the one that makes that choice and I
[3:09:03] just have a feeling that he's given
[3:09:05] certified seed to certified seed
[3:09:08] Hallelujah let's stand together and what
[3:09:11] a joy to be in his presence
[3:09:18] remember those who are traveling brother
[3:09:21] Magnuson and brother Ziggy
[3:09:24] oh how much fun and how wonderful it'll
[3:09:27] be to have brother Ziggy it's been a few
[3:09:28] years
[3:09:29] brother Magnuson belongs here this is
[3:09:32] his this is his fall home
[3:09:35] he's been so faithful to come through
[3:09:37] the years to Iceland
[3:09:40] one of our sisters in Iceland was
[3:09:43] at the very last minute she felt the
[3:09:45] desire she was still feeling the desire
[3:09:47] to be here so she got everything in
[3:09:49] order and was once checked to see if we
[3:09:52] might find her a place and I said I
[3:09:53] believe we can find her a place I don't
[3:09:55] know where but we'll find her a place
[3:09:57] and then she went and her visa had
[3:09:59] expired and she couldn't come so she
[3:10:02] rented a place where she could go and be
[3:10:04] alone and watch the stream a cabin so
[3:10:07] she can be that's a holy convocation
[3:10:10] she would have much rather have been
[3:10:11] here
