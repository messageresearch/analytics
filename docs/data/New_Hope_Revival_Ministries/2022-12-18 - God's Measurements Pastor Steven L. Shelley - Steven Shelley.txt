his house wasn't worship amazing what a wonderful atmosphere was created all for the glory of God we're here are you here you all are looking in so many different directions I I hello isn't he good we're here you made it you sat through three and a half hours of teaching last night and you made it this morning this morning you made it God is good I want to honor you so much and thank you so much for sitting for for helping for pulling I want to thank you for every text every message that was sent from our local folks and from streamers many who said we stream the entire four-hour service and uh we're Rick one brother said I'm rich I've got a lot of stuff I've got to sort out in my life and I've got exactly one week to do it oh God helped my brother he's gonna need it he is about to turn the Apple card upside down you've never seen such devils as get stirred up in people when you start taking their tradition from them I'm telling you old grandmas that love everybody and kiss everybody and pet the kittens you start taking Traditions from them doesn't matter whether they're Pagan or not and they really can get stirred so may God give you Grace and wisdom don't you be a fanatic you do what you do in love you do what you do in the right spirit and God will be with you he will strengthen you he will help you there were two quotations particularly that I missed last night I will not take the time to read them this morning if you can't get the picture in three and a half hours two more quotes wouldn't make a difference but they were some that can somehow sometimes be used to be a little more maybe a little more positive one is from 1949 forgive me for missing that I figured that he said so many things after that that what he said in 49 really might not have been uh necessary to take your time but what we are going to do is we're going to add them to the sheets of quotations that go on the app that go on the website I am going to try to find out brother RJ is not here he's in Kansas with his family but I'm going to try to find out I think that I can also put a PDF uh Hawk do you know if when they put the quotes on the app is that a PDF do you know I'm not sure what it is if it is a PDF uh since the the book mystery Babylon ancient and modern is out of print I don't feel bad to to put that on the app and make the whole book it's too much to print remember I showed you and I had only printed out two chapters and it would it would be several hundred pages of paper and ink if I printed you a copy of that and we're not going to be able to do that we actually don't have the staff to do that and I have some other things I have to keep busy at so we will if if we're allowed we will put that on the app we will put it on the website for sure so that you could download the whole book and read it it's interesting history and we will also um put it on the New Hope private Facebook page I know that we can put files there and you can download that and have that and it's a gift really it's a blessing since it has been out of print for so many years that's because the interest has waned people aren't as interested as they were at one time I want to say today to uh all of you again thank you for being here last night thank you for your support we want to wish Sister Janet Miller a very happy birthday today God bless you Sister that's brother Daniel's mother and we want to just greet you and and let you know we love you and we pray for you all and think about you [Applause] I have a couple of different dates for Sister Louise when is her real birthday do you do you own a it's in July uh somehow on Facebook it got off and it and it was listed as tomorrow but I remembered from last year that that we said the wrong thing but Tuesday of this week is brother Greeley's birthday he's a a few years north of 50 but not not as far north as I am let's wish him a happy birthday this week Tuesday night you know we ought to have him preach on his birthday shouldn't we and work out so let it be written so let it be done Hallelujah you don't get no time off around here or birthday or not okay okay so we do think we can add a PDF that's not what we use now but we think we can add a PDF to the app so you could have the notes the quotes and also the book so that is really great also my friend brother Caleb Deron shares a birthday with with brother Greely and I mentioned that because I know he would appreciate our prayers in the church there and then on Friday is RJ's birthday we want to say a very happy birthday to him and although we don't get to see Matthew Shepard his birthday is on Friday Also and so let that be a good day to pray for him he needs the Lord and the Lord wants him and we'll just pray that God will give him the best birthday present ever that he'll reveal himself to him I I certainly know that God is able to do that and let me say to you happy Hanukkah or Hanukkah tonight we those who remember the Feast of dedication as our Lord did in John we will light the first candle this evening and we will spend a week focusing on the fact that in a very very very dark world the light has come it was once uh once a light that was born in a little humble Place uh now in one little baby but now that light shines in a bride all over the world and we have something to celebrate this is not the time to make you jealous but I have to say that we have breakfast brought different sisters Bring breakfast for the musicians and the pastor I'm not a musician but I get a little something too and they all do a marvelous job they do a wonderful job but sister Ashley and David today helped I think too um he likes to think of himself as a cook and uh he is the Fried Chicken King that I'll tell you it's Hanukkah hint hint I'm available a few nights this week um but sister Ashley brought Locus uh for those of you who don't know what a Latka is you are not Jewish if you don't know first of all and there's a lot of people that are not and you're not from the south because although we never call them latkes or lakis some people say in the South my granny called them potato pancakes and I have to say that Ashley brought some of the best ones I've ever had today uh homemade and uh that is a potato pancake did you what did you have onion in it did you not well that was one thing missing foreign Hawk did a good job dressing mine up crunchy and uh sour cream and applesauce on top oh my that ought to make anybody hungry but anyway thank you all for doing that it was a nice uh surprise to see that as we begin a week of of thinking about the multiplication of the oil and the Miracle working God the Jewish people and those who are Messianic or those who follow the festivals and dedications of the Bible they call this a season of Miracles and God is still a miracle-working God and we still need miracles in our life and so there will be lots of donuts consumed this week and they will not be baked they will be oiled very well and I saw the dough already being made at my house this morning so I'm looking forward to that I'm so thankful that the Lord has given us one more opportunity to look at his word today let me announce that there will be a service here Tuesday night as you heard at seven o'clock with our associate pastor preaching up a storm for his birthday just before they leave sometime toward the weekend to go be out of town and uh there will be a Hanukkah celebration for those of you who want to help participate or be with us it's just a fellowship that's what it is we just fell a ship together it'll be at the Tebow's house Friday night at what time would you prefer you're the hostess with the mostest some work some will be working Friday 6 30. I think it's good 6 30 come bring what you promised you'd bring and we will have fellowship and I understand some of you will already be out of town and that will actually we'll miss you we will miss you but it'll actually make it a little easier to move around in the house but it can really get crowded the last time we had it at the Greeley's house uh they have a lovely home a beautiful home but I was so nervous the whole evening because it was so crowded in there and I need a little Elbow Room and a little breathing space how many of you feel that way sometime when the walls start closing in on me I don't enjoy myself after that but we will certainly miss you and next Sunday morning December the 25th there will be Sunday service here at 11 o'clock just like there would be any other Sunday and I'll never forget the the uh December 25th that we spent was it Roofing or what what was going on on the at the church on that time it was the roofing the roofing was going on and uh there was a big crowd that showed up here nobody had anything else to do so there was a big crowd everybody was off work and that was one of the greatest work days we had that morning and got a lot accomplished so God is good all the time and what about that total my we already were blessed because we thought we had a an exceptionally good offering last week for it and then this 25 000 offering came in and we thought my now that that is uh about a 31 32 thousand dollar payment going in this month that's amazing let's thank God for these wonderful musicians worship leaders camera operators don't you all be out too long with those latkes you come on in here let's stand and go to the word of God today I I just I know I already said it but I'd like to say it again you just did so well last night the children did well I know some of you mamas didn't think so but the children did so well to sit that long and and uh you give me your attention you give me your amens you pulled the best you could and as far as I can see this morning we didn't lose any families nobody got mad went to another message Church nobody went back to the denominations as far as I can see this morning we're still free and I want to thank you very much from the bottom of my heart Revelation chapter 11. and uh I'm gonna hurry let me say while you're going there beginning in verse 1. I want to say hello to all of those who are streaming the service sister Hannah in Norway we love you and her dad is right behind her he's the second one in Tucson brother Merle God bless you all bless the bless the Solomons in South Africa and we got blessings and love from the Netherlands from the van hootens God bless them even little nathania has uh sent us a greeting from the Netherlands this morning and from Accra Ghana and across the country uh here in Canada and Kenya and uh sister Ethel from the UK is letting us know that brother Stewart is back home from the operation that we prayed for but still in pain so we want to lift him up to the Lord in prayer and believe that God will touch him and some in Arkansas and different places wherever you're watching you mean a lot to us and we thank God we know there's plenty of choices to stream and we thank you so much that you chose to be a part of our service this morning are you ready for the word are you 19 verses ready can I read that many while you're standing I'm going to try to do good today and uh and be and be briefer I'm going to try my best to be briefer than last night briefer than last night and there was given me a read like unto a rod just a little more in my Monitor if you can and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein now I want to read that again I'm not going to read them all again but I want you to notice all that is being measured and there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure number one the temple of God number two the altar of God the altar in the temple and number three measure them that worship therein now we don't often think about people being measured we think about buildings being measured dimensions and so forth width and height and length but we don't often think about people but the angel said to John get up take this Reed and measure also the temple The Altar and the people that worship therein let's go but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles or we could say to the Nations and the holy city shall they tread Under Foot 40 and two months meaning the Gentiles will tread the city they will have dominion over the city 42 months and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth and we could say like the prophets of old who wore sackcloth and who uh rubbed ashes on their body as a sign of mourning these are the two olive trees remember the ones we read about in the writings of the Prophet Zechariah and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if If any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed they these have power to shut Heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy like Elijah and have power over Waters to turn them to blood like Moses and to Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will verse 7 and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them they will eventually die and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also Oh Our Lord was crucified we know it as Jerusalem and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half I want you to know that in the time of John it was absolutely impossible for that to be fulfilled this scripture said kindreds meaning generations and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half how many of you know it's very possible in the hour that we live in today satellite television streaming over the Internet the whole world will see the dead bodies of these two we you won't foreign hopefully hopefully you've gone with me cause I'm leaving in the first boat when the dead in Christ rise first we which were alive and remain are going to be caught up that's that's Rapture for us that's for the bride of Christ halfway through what we know as that last week of Daniel or the seven weeks of tribulation uh seven years of tribulation the day of the people in kindreds and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in Graves they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them and make Mary and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth doesn't that sound a little eerie did you know this kind of thing goes on all the time it happened last week in Israel when there were some Jewish men murdered did you know that the Palestinian people there celebrate and they go out into the streets and give candy I saw pictures of uh of of uh soldiers of the Palestinian Authority handing out candy bags to the adults and to the children celebrating the death of a Jew this happens right now in our world and so I don't have any problem believing that it'll be one big celebration these two old-timey preachers have been killed in the streets and I don't doubt that people will rejoice and be happy because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth which means they're they're preaching perhaps will be broadcasted out to the whole earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them what about it if you'd have been there giving away candy and present celebrating their death and all of a sudden you're standing on the street corner and these two men that have been laying there three and a half days should stand up on their feet raised to Life by the power of God you talk about people realizing that's it you're it this is the end of it now and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them just like the bride leaves in Revelation chapter 4. same kind of call and at the same hour there was a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were afraided and gave glory to the god of Heaven the second war is passed and behold the third wool cometh quickly and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Messiah of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the Four and Twenty Elders which sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God saying we give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty which art and washed and art to come because thou Hast taken to thee thy great power and Hast reigned couple more verses and the nations were angry and thy wrath has come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the Saints and them that fear thy name small and great and should this destroy them which destroy the Earth and the temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his testimony the Ark of the Covenant and there were lightning say it with me Lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I want to minister in in uh in the time that I have this morning I appreciate where we were last night but we're not there now we're in a new place and we have laid it out and now we go on I want to preach to you this morning measured by God's pattern I want you to know that he has a pattern I feel a little emotional here because of that scripture reading God has a pattern and and we are being measured even worshipers are being measured in this hour it's a prophetic thing and you're not going to be measured by the church's pattern you're not going to be measured by denominational pattern you're not going to be measured by CNN or Fox news's pattern or the writers and great philosophers of Our Generation but you and I along with the rest of the world all of us we are going to be measured by God's pattern amen by God's pattern now we know that the Bride of Jesus Christ will never stand before the great white Throne Judgment of Our Lord we will stand with him and judge the nations of the world the bride is chosen to be judges with him but every person who is not a part of that bride of Christ will stand before the great white Throne Judgment of the Lord and everything that they have ever done in this life will be brought up and even the things they did in the name of God will be brought up and their motive even will be judged not only evil things they did but things they did in the Name of Christ will also be judged and their motive will be sifted through now why do you say the bride doesn't have to stand in the Judgment that day because whether you recognize it or not your judgment is now the little bride is being judged now somebody said how is that we are being sifted we are being tested we are being tried we are being squeezed around the corner we will know some persecution we have known hardship we have known the bitterness of failure we've known what it's like to start out and miss the mark and have to go back and recalibrate and re-aim so that we don't miss the Mark we have stood strong and at times we have fallen short but God's grace His Marvelous Grace His Amazing Grace Has Lifted us every time from the pit that we found ourselves in can anybody say Amen when we failed he saw us and he loved us with an everlasting and eternal love he didn't love us less when we disobeyed him he loved us more when we failed because he knew that we would allow him to work his work of redemption in US what you find ugly God looks down and he says Oh What a Beautiful work they're allowing me sister April is allowing me to do a beautiful work of redemption in her life and it pleases the Lord he's not pleased with her failure but he's pleased that even in her weakness she submits herself to him in submission and obedience and he gets to come with this silver Redemption and work his work like a like a mother needs the doe he's needing her heart he's needing he's doing it for David Brother David he's doing it for all of us and he's needing our heart and he's working in us a beautiful and great work of redemption so the bride does not Escape she just has a different season and this is our season we're being tested and tried we're going to have to get it right it is as though the angel of the Lord Has Come with a reed like unto a rod and he's not only men measuring the things that be of God but he is measuring the people of God and he is reminding us that through the years we have picked up so many times the cockovers you know you walk through through a grassy field and you you don't even know until you've come out the other side that you've picked up the cockleburs I don't know about you but sometimes I get out of my vehicle and I go on in the house and I look down in my pants are muddy and it hadn't even really been in the mud but you know what I did I don't know why I do it maybe you don't do it I don't know why it happens to me so much but I drag my leg when I get out of the vehicle and any mud that's still wet on my on my running board it'll get on the on the leg of my jeans when I go to get out of the vehicle now sometimes I find myself how did I get that on me and then I remember that it was on the running board and so I didn't even realize when it happened or the cockle bird got a hold of me didn't even realize when it did a blemish a stain how many of you have never passed by a mirror and say why didn't somebody tell me that I have breakfast in my beard we didn't even know it was there last night I went home I prayed for those of you who went to to Taco Bell through the drive-through after a service like that who in the world could eat Taco Bell anytime but who could eat it after a meeting like that I went home and they made me scrambled eggs with cheese and Olivia I didn't know it it was so good I probably did eat kind of fast hadn't eaten in a while and and was ready for something and Olivia said dad you got cheese hanging out of your beard so I just had to reach up and somebody said that's so gross well I can't help it it's just the way life is things get on us and we don't even know there but the wonderful grace of God comes with the word and he measures us he brings conviction to our heart and he lets us know you've got off course and we have nobody to blame but ourselves most of the time now I'd like to read a scripture that I missed last night and they don't have it up there and uh so they may not even get to pull it up I don't know Austin is on the computer and you know what that means we're very blessed to have his help Jeremiah 16. 19 through 21 of course he showed up in my office this morning he said brother Shelley said charity took a break and she said he's right here and then you got up and pulled something from over there somewhere and I didn't have it up it didn't matter what ounce one bit I appreciated what they did did you know that when I finished last night just before I finished in the last few minutes charity was still putting the information in still trying to get it in there so that we could show it on the screen there was that much that had to be put in don't you think she's almost a hero for that work let's thank God for her hey do better than that and all these Austin too and Mariah too and Jennifer Stark too and whoever helps with that Jeremiah chapter 16 verse 19 through 21 just let me insert this here and you think about this this will kind of get you oh Lord my strength way to go oh Lord my strength and my Fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the Earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies it's easy to blame people it's easy to blame those who've gone before us but just remember that they too inherited lies from their fathers passed them down and now you have come on the scene and you have inherited some lies surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no Prophet can you say man shall a man make Gods unto himself and they and they are no Gods therefore behold I will once I will this once cause them to know my hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the Lord there's coming an hour that truth is going to be known whether people have faith to receive it or not now I'm talking about in judgment I'm talking about at the end of this thing aren't you glad that God works with his people in this hour and he brings us to truth now and we don't have to wait until an hour that it is too late so I want you to notice that John was told to measure the temple and the Altar and them that worship therein not just the building not just the furniture but also the people were to be measured the worshipers to measure is to determine the dimensions of a particular something to ascertain the size the amount or degree of something by using an instrument or device marked in standard units or by comparing it with an agreed standard if I were to come as I I did one time and brought a a fold out I think Nathan might have been the one helped me a fold out measuring stick one that unfolds like that I think maybe brother Greeley had used something like that too and we always sing about brother George bringing his level and and putting it up here to measure when something is in Balance but to measure you can't just measure by your thought or by your opinion there has got to be a standard absolute there's got to be something fixed if we're going to compare one thing to another thing we've got to measure it by a standard and both things have to be measured by something that is agreed upon as a absolute or as a standard unit God also measures his people to determine Conformity to his pattern his will and his purposes God is very specific waiting on you God is very specific when he gives us a pattern or a standard for something that he desires for instance in Genesis chapter 6 and verse 14 through 16 and the Amplified it says make yourself an ark of gopher or Cypresswood making it rooms stalls pins coops nests cages and compartments and cover it inside and outside with pitch are our bitumen is that right yes bitterman and this is the way you are to make it the length of the Ark shall be 300 cubits its breadth 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits that is 450 feet by 75 feet by 45 feet I want you to know that Noah hold that up there the next verse we're going there in just a moment I want you to know that Noah he didn't wake up one morning God said build me an ark any way you want to you design it nor I trust you you make the ark however you like oh no God was very specific I wanted to be so many cubic times so many cubits long and so many cubits wide he said You shall make a roof or window a place for light for the ark and finish it to a cubit which is at least 18 inches above and the door of the Ark you shall put in the side of it and you shall make it with lower second and third stories I want you to know it was as though an architect yes had drawn it out an engineer had drawn it out in their mind and delivered this word to Noah now I want you to know Noah was held to the standard of measurement that God gave him I want you to know Noah would have found trouble in his relationship with God if he would have shorted the arkhiness because God didn't just suggest it how many of you know the Ten Commandments are suggestions they're Commandments so was how the ark was to be built and to shorted one inch could have got Noah in some trouble you and I come short of this word one inch and it can cause us some trouble why because God knows what he wants he knows what he loves he knows what he requires is anybody with me then there came a time that God said I'm going to dwell in a in a mishkan in Hebrew we say mishcon I'm going to dwell in a tabernacle now a tabernacle is not a permanent place of dwelling a tabernacle is a portable Place usually that's what it means in the Bible a place that can be transported from one spot to another let's go to Exodus 25 and read verse 8 and 9 and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them this was God's desire he wanted to come and be with us he wanted to go to church with us he wanted to fellowship with us he wanted to dwell with us and he goes on to say according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it now I want you to look at the reasons why there was a need for the Tabernacle of Moses do you have those number one so that God might dwell among his people number two so that God might teach his people of his holiness number three so that God might teach his people of their sinfulness now I want you to know notice the order cannot understand sinfulness until you understand righteousness or Holiness so God said I'm going to have a house built and I'm going to come down and dwell and fellowship with man and I'm going to reveal to them my righteousness and my Holiness And when they see my Holiness they will recognize their sinfulness when they see my righteousness they will recognize their unrighteousness anybody with me now I know this is going to be a little slower has to be has to be because I didn't want to go anything into anything you know uh we've done done heavy we did Heavy last night so I I want this is pretty heavy but I wanted to do something a little simple so I want you to stay with me just a moment and then number four so that God might teach his people to approach him with offerings this had to be revealed there was no Temple there was no sacrificial system there was no offering system God is about to begin to reveal that so let's look at those four reasons again number one so that God might dwell among his people number two so that God might teach his people of his Holiness see God didn't want to just come and visit and go back he'd been doing that he wanted to come and hang out with his people is that okay to say God was revealing something already about his nature number three so that God might teach us his people or teach his people of their sinfulness and number four so that God might teach his people to approach him with offerings now Moses notice in the scripture Moses had to go somewhere to get the pattern he had to go up he had to get a little higher if you want to know what God wants you to know you're going to have to get up above what you think you're going to have to get up above the comfortable and you're going to have to come up into the cloud where God reveals himself look at Exodus 24 verse 16 through 18 and the glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights how many of you know that was causing some trouble back down in the camp we read that last night Moses literally had to come up out of Earth's environment he had to come up out of his comfort zone he had to go into the presence of the glory Cloud for God to begin to reveal to him his pattern and his plan you will not discover God's will for your life dwelling in in hello you got to get up and that's why worship is so important sometimes people talk about us because we emphasize praise and worship as though it was some mighty weapon that's exactly what it is it is because it delivers us out of our present circumstances it gets us above our feelings if we keep going high we get above our opinions and God starts revealing himself to us how many of you really care what God likes sister Ruth used to say what in the world would happen if you spent your whole life making God a cherry pie and found out that he really preferred Apple wouldn't you be embarrassed well let me go ahead and tell you I prefer Apple I'll eat your cherry but I have preferences just like everybody else see now you don't want to spend your whole life baking God the wrong kind of pie so there's a standard his word the message of the hour and the standard of the local church you know I hold them all pretty equal I know some people don't but I hold them all pretty equal I believe the message of the hour is is very vitally important for us just like the word to understand what God is looking for from his people in this hour and I also believe that the standard of the church serves a very similar purpose in our life I believe our pastor has authority to establish such a standard if he has been in the cloud just be honest with you if he spends time in the cloud he ought to be able to step out of the cloud and say God wants this church doing it this way and if that lines up with the message and that lines up with the word guess what you got to do you've got to line up I'm not going to set a standard in this church apple pie over cherry pie I'm not going to get up here and say thou shall not bake cherry pie but if what I get up and declare to you can be lined up with the word and lined up with the message of the hour you don't get a choice I don't have a choice I have to say not my will Lord but your will be done well I don't get courtship I don't get the way you all do things here but does it line up with the word does it line up with the truth that has been established to us then that's how we're going to do it because God has a set measuring standard and this is how we are being measured in this hour I tell you the church is lost out the bride can't afford to lose out in this I'm not going to get no more specific than that come on if my pastor gets up and says I want you sisters to make your skirts longer because you're getting shorter and shorter I think with I really believe this you pray for me if I'm wrong I really believe that's exactly what you ought to do because the message teaches it and the word of God teaches modesty is a standard I don't think there ought to be any more discussion about it I think people just say okay we don't have to pay no attention to that but if it lines up with the word and it lines up with the message I gotta line up with that God's pattern for living it's established by his book is am I with me I didn't mean her to be taught we're getting tied and I didn't leave her to get tight come on if my pastor were to get up and say you need to spend less time on them video games and more time with your children I believe that lines up with the message I believe that lines up with the word you know God didn't give us these children just to get them off of our income taxes dependents he gave them to us to disciple now here's my problem someone mentioned and I and I did leave out that little quote I'm not gonna go deep I'm not going to mention much I'm very delicate here because I don't want to go back to that subject someone did mention to me about a statement that he he made about the little kitties you know doing this for the little kitties he did say something like that a couple times doing a little something for the kitties but here's the problem with that when are we going to wean the kitties how are we going to wean them off of these little pretty things put up a tree because your little children are small how are you going to decide one day they're old enough to know better I feel that way when I see you putting your little girls in these britches and rompers and things like that yes I feel that how in the world are you gonna know when it's time well you'll know maybe I hope you will I hope you'll finally eventually discover when it is but I want you to know that I'm seeing them now on Facebook on Instagram that tall in little Bridges a little skirt about right there britches down the bottom and Ruffles down around the legs of the britches what do y'all what do you call them I don't know what you call them no these aren't quite leggings because they're they're they're they do fit kind of like a leggy but they've got Ruffles that go down on the bottom they don't go up they go down on the bottom they're riches let's just call them what they are they're riches and I see the little girls doing that now what in the world how if they're if they're in the babe in the arm somebody said well I'd be all right now they're walking and now they're standing This Tall next to that who is going to have the courage somebody's going to have to say okay you've reached the age who knows the Bible doesn't tell us what age the Bible just said we shouldn't wear that which pertaining to a man so how are we going to know the aid do you understand that this is how compromise has begun nobody really knows what age to stop them okay now we mentioned last night the little bangs that they that sister Branham put on the little girls Rebecca and Sarah she ought not to done that somebody said you ought not to speak ill of the dead I'm not judging her she's with the Lord but she ought not to done that two reasons she knew what the word said number one and she knew what her husband said shouldn't that be enough whoa this is getting rougher than I thought it was going to get now how how is she going to know if somebody doesn't tell her how is she going to know when they get old enough to know that they ought not to be doing such a sad so we we want our kitties to be taken care of we want them to be celebrated I do I mean it I mean I want them to I want them to know that they are loved not only by their parents and their grandparents but their adopted grandparents I want him to know that pat pat loves them and I want them to know that they're surrounded by Community of Faith that loves them and we don't want them to do without anything they they need and we want them to have a lot of what they want because we appreciate the fact that we have them but how are we going to be able to discern when they get old enough to start changing the standard for them you see here's the problem my wife grew up in a wonderful message home with parents that loved her very much she eventually rebelled and had to have her own experience with God and come back to God but one of the problems was Revival meeting they had no Fellowship they lived way away from any of the churches at the ever fellowship with and there were times growing up that the TV would go out of the home and come back into the home and go out of the home and come back into the home and go out of the home and come back into the home and so that becomes very confusing how are you going to teach your children you ought not to sit in front of that thing if you get weary from lack of fellowship and you set it down in front of them again there must be a standard there must be a measurement an absolute so that we can raise our children in the faith did you just happen to have it in your pocket oh thank you I wouldn't have been surprised if Nathan would have told me that that was in his pocket I wouldn't have been shocked the boys got 50 Keys all the time somebody told him one time must have told him Marquis you have the more important you are and so he cares just about every key got two or three knives uh probably strapped pistols somewhere anime animistic so that we don't just have to say yay not that long we can say exactly how long because God has a pattern and a standard and an absolute and some of that is not open for interpretation because we can't get the art one it's shorter than it's supposed to be cause the giraffe may live on the third story and if he does his neck's got to be up there God saw all of that even when Noah didn't see all of it he had to follow so it come down to the Tabernacle and God began to give very very specific instructions about the Tabernacle with Moses to go over his desires he even had an idea about how long the tent pegs should be made can you imagine wouldn't it have been enough to say now Moses that Tabernacle is a tent it's going to have to have tent pegs you make them out of such and such seem to me like common sense you could figure out in a hurry about how long a tent Pig ought to have to be to hold down a tent but Moses might not have been an engineer see and God wanted to give him every instruction and even told him how many inches we're going to say inches for the sake of interpretation how many inches the tent Peg should be now that means if there were to be 300 tent pegs and God wanted them all just say 15 inches long all of them had to be 15 inches long and what happens is if you bring God a tent Peg that's 13 inches when he told you to make him 115 inches he's going to reject the one that don't fit the measure why wouldn't you if you were a boss man on a job and you told a man to go saw some planks and you told him exactly how many feet to make every one of them and bring them back and he brought you two too short and three too long wouldn't you ask him if he knew what he was doing do you need to go back on unemployment a while cause I'm about done with you it's time for you to get this right Moses could not have just built it the way he wanted to or even the easiest way he thought it could be built and then asked God to approve it he had to build it God's way by God's Design By God's measurements Moses had to go right up into that Glory Cloud to get the divine revelation in the divine presence of God and I want you to know the will of God and the mind of God concerning his word still comes to the bride by divine revelation if you believe that same man if we read all of Genesis 25 God gives very specific instructions concerning all the measurements and all the various Implements of the Tabernacle it appears as we make our way through the next chapters from Exodus 25 all the way to Exodus 31 that God gives extremely meticulous and detail he gets extremely meticulous and detailed in his material choice make it out of this his color choice now Lord I got some beautiful gray cloth on sale last week I don't know why sister Joyce came to mind because she is not a compromiser but she is a bargain shopper did I say it all right I believe if God said purple she'd make purple but you couldn't come and say now Lord why do I need to make it purple when I found some beautiful material last week on sale just enough it must be God I hear people doing that gotta be God just like the man who sat in my office some years ago and told me after already being married a time or two that God had given him a wife and I gave him the word and I gave him the message of the hour but it was too late because God had already told him he could marry this wife well he's not with her now see God must be God got to be God because somebody showed interest in me come on it's got to be God because we like the same things got to be God because we're hungry for truth no no no no not because you got it on sale not because it's close enough to purple that you can get by with it God was very specific I wanted out of this kind of material I wanted this color I want it sewn with this color thread and I want to tell you how to decorate it he said I want you to embroider uh Cherry beams I want you to uh he told us what to put on the drapes what to put on the curtains God didn't know about The Farmhouse trend so sister Megan yovich he didn't paint everything White he had his own color palette he had his own material list he had his own design plan and anything less than what pleases God and it will not draw his presence if we want the presence of God Among Us we've got to follow the pattern nothing less not even anything more just what God is asked of us and then we read in First Kings chapter 6. verse 1 through 14 in the Amplified Bible in 480 years after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomon's Reign Over Israel in the second month ziv he began to build the Lord's House the length of the house Solomon built for the Lord with 60 cubits its breath 20 and its height 30 cubits the length of the vestibule in front of the temple was 20 cubits equal to the width of the house and its depth in front of the house was 10 cubits for the house he made narrow lattice windows against the wall of the house he built Chambers running around the walls of the house both of the Holy place of the holy of holies and he made side Chambers all around where did he get these ideas he got them from the Tabernacle he was allowed some Liberty by the leadership of the Holy Spirit but but the the the bones the structure the the measurement the the way it was to be designed with three chambers it had to be according to the pattern against the wall of the house he built Chambers running around the walls of the house both of the Holy place and of the holy of holies and he made side Chambers all around the first story side Chambers were five cubits wide those of the middle story six cubits of the third story seven cubits for around the outside of the wall of the house he made offsets in order that the supporting beam should not be thrust into the walls of the house what was Solomon's profession he was a king sounds like an engineer sounds like he had some Divine instruction sounds like God was with him come on when the house was being built its Stone was made ready at the Quarry and no Hammer that's according to the instructions of the Lord and no hammer no ax or tool of iron was heard in the house while it was building can you imagine there's nothing any worse than renting a condo at the beach for a week of vacation getting there to find out there's construction on the condo next to you been there done that you're sitting out on the balcony wanting to enjoy the sound of the waves and the Cool Breeze blow in did I do good well that wore me out God said I don't want anything to disturb the presence I'm in this building project I want the stones to be brought in here and by the time they get here there to be laid on top of one another without any chiseling out here in the Quarry is where the work must go on because once it begins to come to be built no Hammer no ax or tool of iron was heard in the house while it was in building I find that outstanding the entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right or the South side of the house and one went up winding stairs into the Middle Chamber and from the middle into the third and it goes on so Solomon built the temple building and finished it and roofed the house with beams and Boards of cedar verse 10 then he built the stories of Chambers the lean to against all the house each story five cubits high and it was joined to the house with Timbers of Cedar so the word of the Lord came to Solomon saying concerning this house which you are building if you will walk in my statutes execute my precepts and keep all my Commandments to walk in them then you're with me then I will fulfill to you my promises which I made to David your father and I will dwell among the Israelites and will not forsake My People Israel so Solomon built the house and finished it the approval of God came down to Solomon and said Son you have done well but you're not finished just yet I want you to walk in my statutes I want you to execute my precepts and keep all my Commandments to walk in them and then I will fulfill every promise in First Kings chapter 6 the rest of the chapter he goes on to give very specific instructions and details about the building of the inner chamber and the holy of holies in First Kings chapter 6 the last two verses of the chapter 37 and 38 he says this in the fourth year the foundation of the Lord's House was laid in the second month zeeve in the 11th year in Bull the eighth month the house was finished throughout according to all its specifications so he was seven years in building it I want you to know it was some kind of a house for the Lord to dwell in seven years in the making oh what Glory was to fall on that house we draw the conclusion after reading these chapters concerning the construction design and building of the Holy Temple that God is deeply concerned with the details of the place where he intends to dwell with his spirit the Tabernacle then the what came after the Tabernacle where did God dwell after the Tabernacle what are we talking about now the temple first the Tabernacle then the temple and then us me Acts chapter 7. 45 through 50. let's read it quickly which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers under the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find the Tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be at the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne what was what was the Apostle saying in Acts he was saying that building is magnificent but it's not great enough big enough expansive enough to contain the Living God God said Heaven is my Throne the Earth is my footstool have you ever tried to see him that way I've tried to see him that way great old big God sitting up there in eternity with his feet his ankles crossed and his feet propped up on the Earth like a footstool like you pull an ottoman up and that's how big he is you could never contain a God Like That Heaven is my Throne the Earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things the question remains for us what house will you build me will you do it in your own way or will you do it in God's way will you live according to your own thoughts every man doing what is right in his own eyes or will you do it according to the measurement will you take time to find the standard measurement will you take time to find the absolute which is the word of God and the message of the hour placed in the word of God are you still with me the bride of Christ in our day is to be measured by God's ideas his designs and his standards his absolute requirements have been preserved for us in the Old Testament in the newer Testament even the message of the hour and the teachings of our pastor because they must also be based on God's pattern as he has revealed it in his word we do not have to guess or assume to know what the pattern is it has been outlined for us carefully and preserved for our guidance can anybody say Amen in Ezra chapter 8 I want you to stay with me for the last part of this message and I'm I'm moving into that direction right now just for those of you who are interested page six of of ten somebody said what does that matter for you because you could spend all day on page six but I'm not going to in Ezra chapter eight there's a word that comes from the Lord to gather the people together and to number them or measure them for the journey and we find that Ezra gathered 50 000 people toward the river of ahava now if you know anything about modern Hebrew you know that ahava in Hebrew means anybody love it's love 50 000 men have been gathered by the word of the Lord and they are being sent toward the River of Love the river of ahava because they're going to be going home they have been exiled and now in Babylon and now they're going to be driven back to Jerusalem and they're going to re-establish reconsecrate and rebuild the city and rededicated unto God Ezra 8 15 says and I gathered them together to the river that runeth to ahava and there Abode we intense three days and I viewed the people and the priests and found their nun of the sons of Levi I don't think you're listening I want you with me for this latter part if you can possibly be I viewed the people Ezra said I viewed the priest and I quickly calculated that I couldn't find any of the Levites among the priests there were other priests other Priestly families the Levites had a very particular job to do as priest unto the Lord they were the ones who bore the holy vessels of God they were the ones who carried the Tabernacle from place to place and so here we are finally leaving prison finally leaving captivity and 50 000 of us are ready to go and Ezra the prophet of the Lord is looking across the crowd and he said we got a problem here I find some priest but I don't find any Levites how are we going to move forward without the Levites who was Levi Levi was one of the 12 sons of Jacob one of the twelve sons of Israel Joshua 21 tells us that there were 48 cities that were inhabited by the sons of Levi 48 cities that was a crowd of folks it wasn't a handful of levitical priests it was cities full of levitical priests they count the closest to the Tabernacle how many of you remember that they surrounded the Tabernacle when it moved to its next location when the pillar of fire would move they moved with it in Joshua chapter 3 verses 3 and 4 and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest of the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits my measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore it was the responsibility of the Levites to maintain the cords to maintain the curtains to maintain the poles to maintain the boards to maintain the bars to take care of the badger skins and even carry the sacred furniture Deuteronomy 33 9-10 who said unto his father and to his mother I have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his Brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed Thy word and kept thy Covenant they shall teach Jacob he's talking about the Levites they shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and Holbert sacrifice upon thine altar what is being said here in the Tyndale Bible commentary I just chose Tyndale it was the first one I had access to and I grabbed it the tribe of Levi set their duty to Yahweh above all the claims of their Kindred this led them to devote themselves to the service of Yahweh so that in times of national crisis when people turned aside to other gods they administered Swift and severe punishment to evildoers whoever they were whether members of their own family or not when God chose the tribe of Levi he chose them because he saw in them the strength of character not to compromise not even for their own parents not even for their own children are their own family members many many men have lost their Ministries because they lost their family many pastors have lost their influence because they compromise with their own children God said I've got to have a priesthood that will lay the word out guard the standard of God guard the precepts of God you can take a pig and dress it up in a long skirt and take the ear Bobs off but it's still a pig until it has a nature change you can't bring your children to God by dressing them up and putting them in service it's a heart issue it's a matter of the heart sometimes I think about my wife I mentioned to you about her straying year uh in University and I think about her sometime her parents loved her so much and they worried over so much that's how I met her I met her in a picture when her mother showed me her picture I was preaching for brother Ivan Carr and she comes up like so many mothers did in those days I I I I I was considered a catch back then boy how things change and sister Whitaker come up like other mothers and she just unfolded her picture you know how you know how you and she just put them pictures up and she said this one right here's my daughter remember her she really needs the Lord well I just go and said her never you know it's so strange I never in a million years would have thought I'm praying for my wife your sister Whitaker and her sister-in-law said here's our family I want you to pray over our family and pray for my daughter right there I would have never known and when my wife was going through a dark time in her life her parents wanted to do everything they could to get her around other young people because some people think that all the young people of this message are just really Superior and oh I've seen so much cruelty so much mocking one another calling one another names around the young people of this message so that when I hear they're having a youth camp or when I hear they're having a move of God I Rejoice with everything that's within me because I know that the same devil out there that's after the world is after them and they're not they're not perfect because they're brought up around this message because many of them inherited lies from their parents and they're in the same bad shape but but my my in-laws they thought if we could just get uh Stacy to be with some of the young people and so brother George and sister Rebecca were going to Europe with a big group of young people and they were going to be in Germany and several places sister Laurel was on that same trip and they sent my wife and my wife had a nice time she met some nice people she enjoyed the science but that didn't change her life it didn't make her want more of God it didn't make her want more a church right we get real crafty sometimes you think because you drags a young person to a meeting that's that's going to make the difference in their life let me tell you something sometimes you'd be doing a better service to him to spend extra time on your knees and prayer for them that when they're ready to come God will draw them I don't mean not invite them but I mean Dragon them is not always the answer now they live in your house you know how I feel about that we're going to church you eat my cereal eat my eggs and drink my milk you're going to church too and God's been mighty good to us we can be so thankful to say that we never had to call our children twice to get them up and get them ready for church I pray that as they get out on their own at some point in life that they don't have to be drugged I pray Jenna never has to shake Benjamin and beg him to go to church I pray that Olivia never one of these days 30 years from now I pray she never has to shame her husband to try to get him to come to church I pray that it's instilled in them now while we have this opportunity listen their parents here that miss their opportunity and they grieve over it don't you young parents make the same mistake that others have made you live this in front of them instill this in them don't compromise with sin and then expect them to take the high road when you won't take the high road so these were men chosen specifically because they were going to guard the word of the Lord no matter what Mom and Daddy did no matter what their children did they were going to stand and Tyndale said they were chosen for that particular reason and they were if and I'll show it to you in Exodus 32 quickly verse 25 Exodus 32 I like this it goes along with what we were scripture we read last night and when Moses saw that the people were naked not only were they worshiping a golden calf they'd stripped their clothes off sounds like a Christmas party around around the world today don't it and when Moses saw that the people were naked for air and had made them naked under their shame among their enemies then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him somebody say all every one of them ran to the aid of the prophet said unto them thus saith the Lord God of Israel put every man is sword by his side go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and to every man His companion and every man his neighbor [Music] and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and there fell that day about 3 000 men for Moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the Lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day I want you to know the sons of Levi were loyal to the word they weren't just loyal to the scripture they were loyal to the prophet right and the prophet said put your sword on and go through this community gate to gate he didn't say cut off their welfare or take their food stamps from them he said you slay them what was their crime dancing naked before that golden calf trying to mix paganism with with their faith trying to worship the Living God in a way that other gods were being worshiped God didn't want any part of that and the sons of Levi were very loyal and very faithful and second chronicles 17 and 9 it says and they taught in Judah and had the book of The Law of the Lord with them they went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people so they weren't just soldiers in the Lord's army they were also teachers they not only guarded the word they broke the word down and they began to teach people how many of you know it's one thing to preach it's another thing to take time sometime and and just teach people on a one-on-one just sit down with people and share the word of the Lord with them that's what the sons of Levi did but when it finally came time to leave exile to leave the land of Babylon behind where were the sons of Levi then when it comes time to turn the people back toward Holiness where are the sons of Levi now when it comes time to call out paganism in Christianity where are the sons of Levi now we need them the holy priesthood of God we have everything and everyone else we have Innovative new programs we have coffee shops in the church we have cell groups we bait everybody with Donuts to get them to a service we have recovery classes of every kind we have musical entertainment we have big conferences with big gun speakers to draw the crowds but where are the sons of Levi who will take an unpopular stand for the word of God for the people for the instructions and the patterns that God has outlined for the people music is not enough glossy brochures are not enough smoke machines are not enough they're not going to get the job done come on colored lighted backgrounds and acrylic see-through pulpits will not get the job done we need the sons of Levi who will teach patiently the Oracles of God but who are also willing to arm themselves with a sword and execute the Justice of the Living God sometimes preaching is In Love sometimes it's with a sword but I'm telling you we need that love and we need the humility of teaching and sometimes we need the sword of preaching and sometimes we need a pastor who will stand up at the end of the service and say I need to talk to you all about some of the things I see coming in the church you say I don't think you ought to talk about yourself somebody's got to tell you we need that sometime we need somebody who'll sit around the table with us and answer our sincere questions but we also need someone who will come up here brother like a brother Greeley who will stand here and open his mouth wasn't afraid when God gave him this mandate it was a rebuke we're raising money because it's the right thing to do but it started with a rebuke I can't trust you with what you got and here you are believing me for more I'm paraphrasing I'm just paraphrasing and he did he wasn't afraid he he you know said a little something to me uh uh maybe just before but I had no idea the message that he was going to bring and how that was going to go out he stood here without fear of man he stood here because he know that knows that I have placed confidence in him and you have placed confidence in him and he must have known enough about my heart to know that I wasn't going to be offended or take it personal but I was going to take it to heart he must have known that somehow you were not going to walk out of here with a fence but you were going to take it to heart and how many of you know [Music] don't hear you [Applause] what was nearly a half a million dollars has come down to 188 42203 because we didn't just need somebody to come and tell us how good we've been doing we need that sometime we need that sometime but we needed somebody to come and tell us if you want God to trust you with something else if you want to see their us whoa if you want me to trust you with something else and see the rest of this Vision fulfilled why do you continue to labor under such a heavy load when if you trust me I'll help you get out sister Flo already had a burden she already had a vision she wanted us to put up a box I think what we chose to do work better than the box but she said do whatever you have to do if you had to put a box out there and lock it up and say put your put money in it toward the principle of this property let's just get that done so he brother Greeley wasn't the only one that had the burden but the burden began to move and begin to stir when it come time to raise money for the studio and it hadn't it hasn't by any means reached its potential of what God's going to do with it I I I'm not in the least bit discouraged but I'm not going to say anything until I know what I'm saying but he's going to use every bit of that for his glory and when it came time that we had a choice to make between one set of equipment and another set of equipment it was some of these ladies that stood up in the prayer meeting later in the service and said let us not sell God short if the vision is from God the provision will come from God let's type one at home let's save money here and there let's do what we have to but let us not give God anything less than the very best there's something about that kind of a mindset that will help you break out of poverty when you start seeing your giving to God as a way out of your own trouble and trial instead of begrudgingly holding on I must be preaching to a streamer I'm certainly not preaching to this body because we're uh looking this morning I'm standing here before a Congregation of people that don't even have to be asked they just feel the burden and they see the need and the need is met and there's more along the way there were some who streamed the services there was a substantial offering that came in from a group of people that come in fellowship with us here from time to time who's watching archive every service and a Pastor said I wanted to send a leader of the group said I wanted to send some money here because you're helping to feed the people my people you're blessing my people and I want to send something to help your need there the need just started reaching out and God started doing that's who he is where are the Levites who won't just hold our hand did Us in the hospital but will lay before the Lord to have the mind of God when they stand in this Pulpit or when they minister to you we need them we need them we need them Ezra said wait a minute we got to have the Levites all these other things are not enough and so in in Ezra 8 21 and we're nearly done then I Proclaim to fast there at the river of ahava that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek him to seek from him a straight in a right way for us we've got to find the pattern something's wrong that the Levites don't show up when we when we put out the call to go home to Israel somebody's gotten too comfortable over here in Babylon somebody likes it too good somebody's got it to God in slavery in bonding because by now they weren't living like slaves they were living like the elite of the land they were living with prosperity who'd want to go back to Dusty Old Jerusalem all broken down and the walls torn down and the house of the Lord falling in when they've got everything they need right here in Babylon but then I proclaim the fast there at the river Ava that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from him a straight in the right way for us our little ones and all our possessions for I was ashamed for I was ashamed to request of the king a band of soldiers and Horsemen to protect us against the enemy along the way because we had told the king the hand of our God is upon all them for good who seek him but his power and his wrath are against all those who forsake Him brother Greely I just had a flashback I know we don't have women pastors and believe in women preachers but I can't help it I had the best granny I had the best woman preacher for a granny there ever was when this message came she heard the word and obeyed the word but she served God with all she knew until that day come and I'm proud of the fact that she said yes to what she believed the Lord was calling her to do and I'm proud of the fact that when he showed her it was time to do different she obeyed him but all of a sudden I could hear my granny preach that message I've heard it I could hear her saying they were ashamed they were embarrassed to ask for help from a king when they had already told everybody how big their God was I could just hear I've heard a preset multiple times several times through the year and it's a truth write the word we we we hated to ask the king for soldiers to get us get us back when we told him that our God was big enough to handle everything and so the hand of our God is upon all them for good who seek him but his power and his rather against all those who forsake Him so what what did we do we fasted and besought our God for this and would you read the end of that verse you reckon he does you reckon he hears a people when they get serious you reckon when a people get serious before the Lord and fast and pray and call on his name you think maybe he gets to moving on their behalf the priesthood was needed to handle and weigh out the silver and the gold and so Ezra looked out among those Levites that were now beginning to gather in and he chose 12 priests who would handle the silver and the gold the sacred vessels of God something precious and of great value in Ezra chapter 8 verse 25-30 in the Amplified let me read it to you and wait out to them the silver the gold the vessels the offering for the house of our God which the king his counselors his Lords and all Israel there had presented their present had offered I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver silver vessels valued at 100 talents and a hundred talents of gold also 20 basins of gold worth uh one thousand darics and two vessels of fine bright bronze precious as gold and I said to them You Are Holy to the Lord he was making Levites out of priests he was calling ordinary men to do an extraordinary work he said You Are Holy to the Lord the vessels that you carry Are Holy also and the silver and the gold are a free will offering to the Lord the god of your fathers guard and keep them until you weigh them before the chief preached and Levites and heads of the father's houses of Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the Lord whatever you do priest don't you let loose don't you turn loose of these precious weighty valuable things that I'm committing into your hands if thieves come you guard this stuff with your life and don't you turn loose of it until you've made your way all the way back to Jerusalem and laid it before the priests that are waiting on you there don't compromise on the way don't get sack on the way so the priest and the Levites receive the weight of the silver the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem into the house of our God where there were not enough Levites to do the job he chose from among the priests and consecrated them to serve as Levites now I want to tell you something we need that kind of dedication we need to understand that God is not pleased to dwell in a tent anymore or in a in a building that we build with our hands anymore he's looking for a house to live in he's looking for a people to dwell in and he doesn't want to dwell in you in portion he wants to dwell in you in fullness and he wants you and I to make all the room possible for him he don't want us to give him the back porch he wants the back porch and everything else he wants all of you can somebody say he wants all of me he wants all of me and so if there's ever been a time to consecrate ourselves to discover the holy pattern that God's word outlines that the message of the hour outlines that the fivefold ministry that God has given to us outlines Now's the Time as the sun goes down tonight we remember Jesus remembered you read John 10. you will read this not only the fact that he was there but you'll read the message that he preached he preached in the temple he preached in the courts of the temple read that read it this week I want you to think about a time when Mighty armies were marching against Jerusalem and when the Holy Temple that had been set up for worship to the one true Living God men Greeks broken tore down the holy furniture rip down the holy curtains the holy implements went before the holy Altar and slayed a pig and offered the blood of a pig on an altar dedicated to Yahweh now now here's what I want to say now I'll do a little more about this Tuesday night but here's one what I want to say how could I not remember it first of all there's no mention of the word Christmas anywhere in the Bible and there's nothing in the Bible that tells us to remember his birth but John the gospel of the New Testament tells us that Jesus remembered the Feast of dedication so how can I not remember it do I make it a Jewish Christmas of course not do I try to make myself a Jew of course not although I have Jewish blood do I teach others to be judaizers I do not that's not what I'm talking about oh but how could I not remember it sister April when I know Jesus remembered it he went to the temple specifically at that time somebody said is that the only time he went to the temple no he went hundreds and thousands of times to pray Brother David Mann but the Bible didn't talk about any of those other times but the time that he went to remember the Feast of dedication the Bible records it could you pull that up for me John 10 20. John 10 22 I thought I had the chapter wrong there for a minute let's just look at it we'll do a little more of this Tuesday night it is 1 30 if we were to get out in the next 10 minutes we'd be breaking all records it ain't gonna happen somebody said oh no don't let him sit down he's good for three and a half hours when he sits oh Austin come on honey there are certain people I love so much and I'd rather pick on them almost rather than eat pie oh sufganio you've never lived until you've walked the chilly streets of Jerusalem at Hanukkah time and and had real fresh warm sufganiot and stood and eat your jelly donut and look up on that mountain and know that once upon a time there said a holy Temple where God met with his people and where Jesus himself walked and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was winter we even know the season what does the next verse say and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch I don't have a picture to show you maybe I'll get one Tuesday night but I can show you the uh the Promenade that that went along the southern end of the Temple Mount closest to the old fail and I'll do you one better if you'll go with me I'll take you God willing and show you right where it stood there's nothing in the world like thinking about being right there in the spot sister Green's daughter Karen brother Green's daughter Karen sent me a picture this week of brother green and I standing on the Temple Mount and it just blessed me so much made me think of how privileged and blessed I've been to be able to stand there and here's Jesus doesn't say anything about all the other times he went but it particularly mentions that he was here in the winter at the time of the Feast of dedication I like to call it the Feast of rededication because the temple had already been dedicated but now it had been desecrated by paganism by false worship can you imagine going into a holy place like that and taking uh something that is so offensive to the Jews the pig that was never given by God for food it was given by God to clean up the slop of the world kind of like the bottom feeding fish it shall be nameless in gutting it and pouring its Blood Out on the holy altar where God had commanded that pure blood of spotless lambs and spotless animals be offered as an offering unto God kicked over the holy menorahs not just one but a whole host of menorahs that sat in the Holy place of the Temple poured out the vials of of oil that were used that first pressing of olive oil the Jews were so determined to offer God only the best that when they put the least amount of pressure to the olives and took the purest clearest greenest oil that was the only oil that could be used in the temple God didn't want the dregs he wanted the first fruits do you understand that concept you treat God that way you'll be blessed you give God what's his and keep what what is left for yourself and you'll be blessed he'll multiply it back to you time and time again kicked over the holy menorahs put the swine's blood on the forbade any observance of Sabbath the dreidel that the little children play with is something that they invented to distract the soldiers because they were forbidden to light the Sabbath candles and they were forbidden to make any separation between the holy and the profane and any observance of we say Judaism but it was it was Bible they were just doing what the Bible told them to do remembering pesach and celebrating Sukkot right it was Bible we made it Jewish the Bible made it Bible and they were forbidden to do all those things under this heavy occupation of both Greek and Roman influence and a little family that lived out in moda in I have to say it carefully because sometimes I have said mohedin moed is a holy appointment a dress rehearsal a feast of the Lord but the town is called modain just outside of Jerusalem do you remember where it is brother Greeley it's on the it's well we call it the Moda in Road it's just past what is the Palestinian town where there was always so much trouble going on there and Ramallah it's just past Ramallah on the road to the airport and load and it's that little bitty heel area out there and I've been to the graves of The Maccabees it's a special place and I took my children the last time we were there we went to a Biblical park there showed them some olive presses and things that survived from the time of The Maccabees and and hear a little man and his boys raised up and said we've had enough these Syrian armies Etc had marched in there with elephants can you imagine facing off with a few zealots of Israel and thinking that you had to bring elephants to help you win the battle talk about intimidation methods and they marched in with all these weaponries that only one family and a few who would follow said we may die right here with Jerusalem in sight but we will not lay down and watch you continue to defy the Living God of Israel and God as he has done so many times for his Chosen People Israel he miraculously gave them victory took some years to come a lot of battles a lot of loss of lives The Maccabees didn't win the battle and it'd all be over with but there came a Time that it was over and somebody said now we've got to go back to the temple and we've got to scrub off the swine's blood the human feces history tells us that they had used it for for a latrine somebody's got to grab the shovels and who and shovel out the poop somebody's got to turn up right side the holy menorahs and polish them off and clean them up somebody's got to come up with some oil because we've got to light the holy Menorah in the in the in the presence of God and we've got to clean the Altar and we've got to see the curtains back up and we what a work they set out to do and God honored them and blessed them and that's where the tradition comes many historians say that there's no written record in history it became a it became Something Told by mouth to ear Legend a myth perhaps but I like to mention it anyway because to me it may not have happened exactly like this but it sounds just like God to me The Story Goes they found one little pot of holy oil in the midst of all the rubble not even enough to hardly light one Menorah for one night all the rest of the menorah sat without oil it would be it would be some time before there could be enough oil to be used to light all the menorahs because it had to go back through this whole process of first first pressing and then it had to be Sanctified and prayed over and blessed by the priest so it would have been days before they could have had enough oil to do it but The Story Goes they took the little pot of oil that they had and they lit the holy Menorah and instead of it lighting for one night not even enough oil to get it lit for one night all the way through but instead the legend Goes The Story Goes we should say it burnt for eight solid nights I wasn't there I don't know if it happened that way but again sounds just like something my God would do take a little bit of oil musicians are coming take a little bit of oil sounds just like what he did in Elijah's day little witty woman who had just enough oil and just enough meal you know I like how the Jews tell the story they don't believe from the original language that the that the that the meal Barrel filled all the way to the top and the oil failed all the way to the top they believed that the original language indicates that each time she went there was just enough doesn't that sound like God just enough God's people have rarely been the wealthy majority but they've always had just enough the little Mama went back and she said I know there won't be none I emptied it out the last time she opens a lid oh just enough just enough so whether it happened that way or not I don't know but I'll tell you what Jesus Vindicated validated and confirmed the thought of the Holy Temple being rededicated reconsecrated God's not looking for a tent Chad he's not even looking for a church building he's looking for you and I to be his Temple come Lord I I've let I've let some things turn over in my life I've neglected some things like brother Greeley was talking about natural I've neglected some things spiritual I've let some furniture fall over let some pots burst in the cold and let my garden get Full Of Weeds again and now is a perfect season and a Time to weed my garden it actually is to get my Menorah turned right side up again to re-light my lamp to reconsecrate my altar oh Lord I find that selfishness has crept in and my love for people is more shallow than it has been at certain times in my life and my patience is most definitely thinner than it's ever been and Lord I want you to clean me actually I don't I actually want you to help me clean my own house I want you to help me scrub the walls and the floors and get all the blood that defiles and all the filth and the and the scum out of my life I'm not asking you to take it out you didn't put it in I'm asking you to give me the strength Lord to set everything right that time and Temptation has turned upside down Lord give me strength to put
