[0:00] BECAUSE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, WE'VE
[0:01] GOT OFF TRACK.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Compromise is what got us here.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; And when we find ourselves slippery,
[0:11] slipping on that uh path of compromise,
[0:16] the next thing you know,
[0:18] the enemy can hold us back,
[0:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Distract us and keep us from walking in
[0:27] the victory. Even though the Holy Ghost
[0:29] is here waiting on us to yield and let
[0:31] him roar,
[0:33] &gt;&gt; but something will weigh you down before
[0:35] you go to bed tonight most likely.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; And you've GOT A CHOICE. YOU CAN WALLOW
[0:40] there in the weight OF THE SERIOUSNESS
[0:43] OF THE SITUATION. AND JUST BECAUSE WE
[0:46] TALK ABOUT GOD MAKING A WAY OUT DOESN'T
[0:49] MEAN that it's not a real problem you're
[0:51] facing. It could be urgent. IT COULD BE
[0:54] CRITICAL. IT COULD BE LIFE OR DEATH. BUT
[0:58] IT DOESN'T MATTER how difficult it is or
[1:01] how easy it would be for somebody else
[1:03] to handle it when it's yours.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; It's personal
[1:08] &gt;&gt; and all of our emotions get around it
[1:11] &gt;&gt; AND WE FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THAT
[1:14] PROBLEM. DON'T underestimate
[1:17] &gt;&gt; how the spirit of the Lord can lift you
[1:20] out from beneath the burden,
[1:23] &gt;&gt; change your perspective,
[1:26] &gt;&gt; make you less hopeless
[1:28] &gt;&gt; and more hopeful.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A WAY OUT.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; GOD MAKES A WAY OUT. HE MAKES A WAY OF
[1:36] ESCAPE FROM EVERY TEMPTATION, from every
[1:40] trial, from every burden. Before he lays
[1:44] it on our life, he has already provided
[1:48] a way to get us out from under the load
[1:50] when it has accomplished what it was
[1:53] sent to accomplish in our lives. The
[1:57] fortress is where we go when the
[1:59] battle's raging and we need to stop the
[2:01] arrows. Amen.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; The refuge is where we run when we are
[2:06] in trouble and when we need a papa to
[2:09] lean on and we need some feathers to
[2:11] cover us and some uh everlasting arms to
[2:15] come beneath us and wings to draw us
[2:18] close. Whatever we have need of, the
[2:21] spirit of the Lord has it.
