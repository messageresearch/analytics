remember your needs to the Lord today Luke and Megan were on the way home from Pennsylvania and their vehicle broke down in Tennessee God has granted them a favor to be able to get a rental vehicle and they'll be coming home this afternoon we want to ask the Lord to be with them as they travel and that this fix for their vehicle will be quick and not expensive asking the Lord to do that for them yes would you please remember the family of sister Hoyer who went home to be with the Lord on Friday at 102 years old remember the children and the grandchildren particularly our sister Miriam franchak that God would be with her and her kids but but it's an extended family it goes all the way out to British Columbia may God minister to every one of those needs also for the the others who are traveling were concerned about Ben and Kendra because they had such a terrible time getting out there and now Southwest is you know it looks like there there may be even going under and uh so we want to pray them home safely and maybe I guess Nathan and Shoshone are traveling today or they're in church with Daddy all right so let's pray for them that God will Undertake and uh anybody else would you remember uh Stacy's last Midwife she's been in relationship with her through throughout throughout uh all four of our children but Melissa only delivered Mariah the baby she had a divorce earlier some years back and her husband was an alcoholic and he went on to take his own life and just a few days ago Melissa's daughter took her life just a young girl very tragic very sad mentally Disturbed and under so much oppression my wife has carried such a burden for Melissa these last couple of days we have a family that we're very deeply concerned about in another place we want the Lord to undertake for them Jenna had a childhood friend just in her 20s about the same age who went home went went out of this world I hope that she had called on the name of the Lord just a young girl with heart condition and uh there was one more I was trying so hard to hold on to these and not not forget them that's the reason I was saying I'm slow if it comes to me I'll yell it out you know I will I can't remember it right this second [Music] Jesus I'm so sorry they've reached out to us this morning again and asked that we remembered the Tucson Tabernacle they're having a very important

happy birthday today for those of you that don't know that is Sister Judith's mother and we want to say happy birthday sister Wagner thank you for your faithful service to the Lord you know I know that sometimes we mention some of these Saints and you have not had the privilege of meeting them and uh but it's just necessary that we call their name from time to time do you know I was Sister hoyer's Pastor 31 years that's a long time 31 years I won't even be able to attend this memorial service for her or take part in that in any way the family has decided to do a graveside service and I have no passport my passport renewal is not complete and it really really breaks my heart but it is it is just what it is we can't say that we believe in the sovereignty of God and then question it when it comes he has a reason for it but my heart is with the Hoyer family they are wonderful wonderful people sister Hoyer was a wonderful Saint I'm not going to speak about her this morning but I am going to share a few thoughts about her in in a coming an upcoming service so that her family can at least know our thoughts and our appreciation for their support they were we people brother and sister Hoyer both stood about about like that and uh they were here for our original camp meeting when we started and they stayed with us for many many many years I will say this quickly and I'll mention it again but I feel like I want to say this but brother Henry and sister Susie Peters those of you that don't know the Peters they came from I don't think it was Mennonite I think maybe it was hutterite they were precious saints of God and they heard the message and they came to the ministry of brother Branham and they were dear friends of the hoyers for those of you that don't know who the Peters are you will know them by their relatives they were the parents of of sister Carol Flint and I don't remember her newly married name I'm sorry she was fled to us for so many years and her husband Bruce went home to be with the Lord and Chad and I had the privilege of being in their home and and preaching in their home once upon a time when brother and sister Peters heard the word of the Lord and heard and recognized the prophet that God had sent to prepare a bride they shared the message of Truth with the hoyers and it's so thrilled them they were so changed they were so so uh their life was new and they have left a legacy of children and grandchildren who believe this message because of it but I'll never forget sitting with sister Hoyer multiple times in her saying saying to us we love the Peters God let them lead us to the ministry of brother Branham and then she said God used helmet and I to lead the Peters to your ministry brother Shelley and we were just as excited when we heard that God was still real and that he was still moving and that he was still the same yesterday today and forever as we were when we heard these truths that had been restored so this is all on my heart today God is a good god tomorrow January the second is the anniversary of meeting the high seas for the first time in 1992 and so God let me be their Pastor a long time they were in the Show Low they were in Show Low Arizona in the White Mountains they were not going to attend the meeting at Brother Dean Hearts where I was preaching they were there for a holiday and they were there to say goodbye to the mountain cabin because it was going to be sold in the divorce they had already met with the attorney the papers were already drawn up and they were ready to sign and God put on their heart they heard about the meetings in the little town of Show Low and they were held in a honey house where where the where the zincas and I'm I've seen them last January for the last last time I saw them was last January in harmony brother Tom zinka and his wife were bee farmers and they emptied out the honey house and began to have Services there and invited me to come Tommy Rector was with me and he had been a bad boy and God had called him out about it and he was repentant and he had wired he he while being a bad boy he fell off a curb in a restaurant passed out his blood sugar was thrown off for whatever reason and uh he fell off of curb in Montgomery and broke his jaw and God started using that to deal with him about getting his life really straightened out he came and he he couldn't eat except through a straw he loved my mother's blueberry dump cake it's not very complicated is it you all know the recipe you just dump it all in he said that's what I regret more than anything about my broke jaw I thank God for using it to get my life straightened out but he said I just regret that I'm not going to be able to have any of moss blueberry dump cake this for lunch today she said don't worry about it she took a big old spoonful of it and put it in the blender and add a little bit of milk and made him a blueberry dump cake milkshake he knew I was scheduled to leave and I said why don't you just go with me and he said he would and we we shot off the Tucson neither one of us he knew the high seas and I didn't know them they'd been in service with me in the Tabernacle but I didn't know them so at the last minute he agreed that he would go with me and we got out there and God did some mighty powerful things some of you were in the services I was in the back study and while I was studying Tommy come and knocked on the door and he was pale as a ghost he had no color at all and he said brother Shelley I'm in the most awful fix I've ever been in I said what is it he said John and Ruth Anheuser out there and I can't face them I said well why can't you face them Tommy he said because I taught their son how to use drugs he he showed me marijuana and I showed him something a whole lot worse than that I showed him how to use a needle and he said I can't go out there and face them knowing that I'm the one and I'm responsible and believe me that mistake cost the high seas a lot of life and a lot of money he said I can't face him I said you get right back out there if if you claim that God has forgiven you of those sins you've got to go out there and make amends I got up and preached that night I don't even know what I preach we have it it's on tape we have it I got up and preached that night and sister heisey was sitting there and the Lord spoke to her and said ruthanne that is a man that you can trust you listen to him God not only turned their life around saved their marriage brought them some years later to Alabama we have buried them both they are now together again with the Lord and I'm so thankful for that these are things that God did 30 years ago he's still moving you're about to see the most Supernatural year on the Gregorian calendar that you've ever seen I tell you that in the name of the Lord you can take that to the bank this morning tomorrow is also Hawk's birthday ha ha thank you Lord demara is also Hawk's birthday will you tell us how many weren't you just in your 20s when I met you what happened 41. let's say happy birthday to Hawk [Applause] oh God is good God is good Tuesday is Tiffany's birthday and she's still unable to be here today with sick sickness in her house let's lift her up to the Lord Wednesday January the 4th is our Joshua River's birthday how old will you be Joshua glad you reminded me can we say happy birthday to Joshua 22 years old [Music] seems like yesterday [Applause] uh I want to read a scripture we're not preaching yet uh can you all be in here in about 10 minutes can you make it snappy that I'm Gonna Let You Go head down then I don't want you to miss something I'm going to show something in a minute before I preach everybody okay we got you here we might as well keep you a while I want to read you you don't have to stand you can stand in a moment when we preach you stood over an hour I want to read you the psalm 123. this is the psalm for 2023. we've been reading these Psalms for quite a few years now and we are always amazed at how prophetic they are for the year there's a few things in in Psalm 122 that I thought we're going to have a little bit of a different literal meaning than they did but that's okay we saw God do some amazing things that were outlined for us in Psalm 122 so we'll read four verses that's all there is to Psalm 123 and if you've got a pen you can mark it there that's the psalm for 2023. unto thee lift I up mine eyes oh thou that dwelleth in the heavens period back to verse 1. now you know what that means it means in 2023 I'm not going to get my eyes on my circumstances I'm not going to get my eyes on my problems I'm not going to get my eyes on my bills I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord it means I'm not going to look at people in 2023. they're going to fail us we're gonna fail one another we're gonna disappoint one another we're not going to be to one another always what we require you understand that and God is teaching us he's taught us this year more than any that we're not going to come to church and look at other people we're going to come and worship the Lord some of you people experience that living communally as God brought you here and there's nothing in the world to bump off the rough edges like living communally I don't know how the early Apostles did it they must have been more full of the Holy Ghost than we are but they lived communally and they bumped one another and they stepped on one another but we had to come to church and forget it we had to cut they had to come to church and focus on the Lord so 2023 is going to be a year again where it is vitally important to lift up your eyes and look at the one who sits above it all I want your undivided attention this morning number two behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden under the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God Hallelujah until that he have mercy upon us a butler a a a a a a servant of some kind a personal assistant of some kind what do you call that a chauffeur we're talking about Biblical times of course there weren't chauffeurs then I get it not personal assistance I get it I was trying to make it a little trying to show you both sides they depend on the one who hires them that's where their paycheck comes from uh a maid that is hired we don't do this so much in our society but a maid that's hired a ladies made [Music] to serve her mistress she looks to her she's the one who makes sure she's paid she's the one that gives her her New Year's bonus God said through the psalmist here prophetically for this year this is going to be a year for you not to look to your employer hello as your source and supply and not to look at your Rich uncle as your source and Supply but to look unto the Lord our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he have mercy upon us we are depending on 2023 how many of you understand the Simplicity of that verse 3 have mercy upon us O Lord have mercy upon us we've preached about double Grace here the psalmist is asking for double Mercy have mercy upon us O Lord have mercy so we're going to need the Lord's Mercy there's going to be some times this year that we're going to feel the squeeze we're going to feel the crunch you're not listening there's going to be some times this year that we feel the loss and the grief of losing things and people that we love but God will have mercy and again he will have mercy on us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt now in order to understand that you've got to catch the last verse our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud that word contempt is a mild form of hatred it is a disgust and I want you to know the way you live your life disgusts people now ten years ago that might have been too strong of a word but it's not too strong of a word now people are disgusted with real Christians they're disgusted with holiness they're disgusted with message believers they want you to blend in they don't want you to stand out they want you to blend in we're living in an hour where where a man would rather demand his rights than to allow his ex-wife to carry her child their children somewhere where they might get help and they might serve the Lord and they might have a different life let me tell you something that's the kind of contempt that we Garner our church even your pastor mentioned in legal proceedings right now because of someone wanting to change their life and make a better start and it shows the hour that we're living in let me tell you something if we loved our children if we loved our family we would want them to get all they can get from God but instead the world around us mocks that they took a little little line on the website that talks about uh the the the the prophecy of my birth and make it sound like we're some bunch of weirdos here that's the year that we're living in a year where our soul is going to be filled with the scorning mind will and emotions it's going to be having to deal with the scorning of those that are what at ease they don't even know the day and the hour that they're living in they don't even know how close they are to the end of all things and so to see someone making an effort to draw closer to the Lord it it disgusts them and fills them with contempt what we must make sure is that we keep that contempt out of our own heart we must not have contempt for one another anybody listening to me we must not have discussed toward one another aggravation can sometimes lead frustration can sometimes lead to contempt so God is saying you're going to face it and you're going to cry out not just for Mercy you're going to say Mercy Mercy but I want to assure you Hallelujah that God who is rich in Mercy Hear It Go hear the sermon go listen go get ready God is rich in Mercy and he's got plenty of Mercy for us when we're facing things and facing scoffers and facing circumstances so this is our year somebody said that sounds kind of Bleak it does not it would if you were out of the Ark of Safety but if you know where you stand and you know whose hands you're in you have nothing to worry about I want your attention [Music] you have nothing to worry about now it doesn't get any more prophetic than that so you better hold on to that God's going to help us now I want to show you something now would you believe I took my marker out of something else I wanted to read does that ever happen to you you need a you need more markers give me just a moment I want to read now Matthew 5. these are sermonettes that was sermonette number one just make sure you're not a christianette Jimmy Swaggart used to say sermonettes are for christianettes who need bassinets the yovitches are four hours and 20 minutes away and and that was uh 12 13 that was about 10 minutes ago there are four hours and 10 minutes away and they want me to know that if I preach long enough they can catch the tail end of the service in person let me say you all are more enthusiastic than most of them sitting here this morning Ben is letting us know that the Southwest got back on track Friday and have only had a few cancellations Friday and Saturday so they're believing that everything looks good for their trip thank you for that report we'll ignore it and keep praying because we're living in an uncertain hour uh there's something I want to say but I won't say I can't I just won't yet but I would like to say it but I don't know I don't think we're nearly ready for it I don't think I'm ready for it Matthew chapter 5. and I want to read verse 17 and 18. think not 5 17 and 18. think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets so all of you hyper Grace people out there who don't believe there are any Commandments any instructions any statutes any ordinances that we must live by as Christian Believers and those of you who believe that the law was done away with in Christ you're wrong Jesus didn't say so Jesus did not come to take us back under the bondage of the law no sir there is no Temple you are now the temple so many ordinances and Commandments that speak of Temple worship cannot be fulfilled today but that's not the purpose of Jesus coming he didn't come to destroy the law or the prophets he said I am not come to destroy but to fulfill that word fulfill means to fill up one of the one of the other translations says to complete I came to complete the law so the finishing of the law is not destroying it the finishing of the law is fulfilling it everything the law was pointing to is found in Jesus if you get Jesus you have what the law was pointing to so you've got to be careful how you go back and take up the law when you now have Jesus because he is the Fulfillment of the law you say that's easy no it's not as easy as some think it is it's striking a very careful balance and there's not a lot of balance in a modern Christian life so we've got to keep our balance as brother Branham instructed brother Perry green keep your balance in the scriptures we have to do that then he said for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one Tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled and that means that everything will not be 100 completed and finished until Heaven and Earth passes and we are one with him in eternity that's right that jock and Tittle are vowel marks in the Hebrew language and they change the meaning of the word and the pronunciation of the word by where the vowel Mark is placed in the word and so Jesus is saying he's not saying one word of the law he's saying something smaller than that not even a vowel mark not even a period let's say it like we could understand it not even a comma not even a semicolon is going to pass away or be forgotten until all be fulfilled but you all cut the lights and let me show you what I was talking about Tuesday night be the chosen Seed of Abraham you may be the people of the Covenants that will not bring you my salvation if you cannot accept that you are spiritually poor captive in the same way that a gentile woman and a Syrian leper recognize their need if you do not realize you need a year of the Lord's favor and I cannot save you who do you think you are this is what Hara talked about that he even called himself the Messiah are you claiming to be he's a messiah Messiah or are you merely claiming to speak for the Lord as a prophet yes you are a false prophet well that is quite a thing to say you read his friend you cannot be involved you know what the law of Moses we are all his friends Aaron we cannot say things like this please stand up at once Rabbi please Rafi come with Jesus in me we will leave and you can all continue this Rabbi Benjamin has asserted false prophecy and I cannot argue you said you saw the mirror he sang Only and safe he did not use those words it's what I meant you're not helping stop he he's saying we are not the holy ones chosen now he did not say that in words a book of Moses Prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak that same Prophet shall die Rabbi Benjamin I beg of you Lazarus it's fine yes juices if you do not renounce your words we will have no choice but to follow the law of Moses [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in [Applause] I am the law of Moses so if anyone asks you why they see a scroll or why they see shofars or why we blow silver trumpets or why we have a Passover meal or where we like why we lie to candelabra at Hanukkah or why we build Asuka simply because Jesus did not come to destroy the law he came to be the law he came to fulfill the law and all of these things keep pointing us that's why Messianic Jews continue to remember the Sabbath because the Sabbath points to the one who said I am I am the rest I am the rest these are dress rehearsals that point us to the reality of who Jesus is and to me the whole gospel the whole gospel has been summed up in that scene I am the law of Moses it would do us all very good to remember who he is he is the Fulfillment of all the verses that pointed to him brother Branham saw that and that's why he told us to keep our eyes on Jerusalem because it was God's time clock and whether you realize it or not we're just living as Gentile Nations who have been called in and we are very very blessed to have heard the call but it's about Israel yes this was God reaching out for his Covenant people and in doing so he decided I'm going to call out a people from among the Gentiles for my name and you got to be one of those somebody ought to give God praise he didn't have to do it he didn't have to do it he didn't have to do it but he did let's stand again foreign we could go home I want you to turn to on Tuesday night we read Hebrews chapter 2 verse 12 through 18. this morning I want to read Hebrews chapter 2 verse 6 through 11. thank you everyone who is streaming the service today and thank you to all of you who streamed Tuesday night or to those who have watched it in the archive and have reached out we've had an unusual amount of people much more than usual to reach out and say that they received particular help in the service on Tuesday night to God be the glory to God be the glory thank you thank every one of you staff members also and and those who are working to help help spread this truth because God is doing something 2023 is going to be one of the most Supernatural years that we have ever seen and we want to be right in the middle of all that God is doing he said I will restore I will restore it is a year of restoration and of reconciliation which is God coming back and putting that that missing part that extra part of what was stolen God says I'm not only going to give you back what the enemy was allowed to take from you but I'm going to give you the extra lump I'm going to give you the extra fat you're going to see my hand and that's not going to fall on that's not going to fall on us like ripe cherries from a tree you're going to have to get in line Lord was speaking just strange things sister Jeffrey just strange things one one thing that he spoke to me yesterday is he said sister said Jeffrey is going to have on that yellow dress I didn't know what yellow dress he was talking about and I said Lord I don't even know why you'd say that to me I'm not sure what that would even matter or mean and then I looked there on Facebook and saw the yellow dress I don't know if that's the same yellow dress or not but I saw you in a dress like that in the picture Under the Tent is that the same dress you had on the day it's not the same you've got a gold dress I guess and a yellow dress but I don't know why in the world something like that would come but it did so I know she's in the right place at the right time I hope you are Hebrews chapter 2 God arrests me and uh watch over my words verse 6 through 11. but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou mayest him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest Tim with glory and honor and did it set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing I want you to say nothing he left nothing that is not under him no disease no statistic no situation no circumstance nothing in history nothing in the present nothing in the future that is not under him you're all right if you've got him if you're holding on to him you're all right if you wanted the most Supernatural year of your life you better hear him we'd better make an effort because again it's not going to just fall on us we're going to have to stand and step up in line the Lord spoke to my heart again yesterday and uh just strange ways he said I want you to Mark online the first the last person to give online in 2022 and the first person to give online in 2023 and I want you to release a special blessing over them I thought Lord if I get up and say that I'll sound like a TV preacher I can't say something like that but I just did I asked him to guard my heart and so I'm going to do that I'm praying already this morning when I got up I looked to see who the last one was and who the first one was and we all can receive a Blessing by being faithful to him but God just for some reason he said Mark that and pray a special blessing over their lives maybe it's just confirmation to me that this is going to be a supernatural year where God does that that's Supernatural you can't arrange that nobody knows when they're giving they're going to be the last or the first nobody probably has that in their mind but God knows but now we see not yet all things put under him unbelief is still raging there's still wickedness in the land look at what he goes on to say potentially it's all there isn't it but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death what does it say for every man for it became him for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing he wasn't just coming to get one son he was coming coming to get many sons he wasn't just coming for a wave Chief offering he was coming for the rest of the Harvest as well maybe our Lord the Forerunner in that first fruits offering no doubt in the resurrection we know it's the truth we see brother Branham fulfilling that role as a wave Chief offering over his generation the first son to come to maturity and some people can't get past the fact that a son has already come to maturity and so they rally around the mature son from the past generation but God doesn't want you to lose sight of the reality that he didn't come to get one son he came to get many sons Hallelujah he came for all the Royal Seed of Abraham in bringing oh in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified or what isn't that what we were preaching here Tuesday night they're one he that does the sanctifying and he that is Sanctified joined together as one spirit they are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them you may be ashamed to be identified with me but he is not ashamed to be identified with you that means no matter what you've done no matter how unruly you have been no matter how out of the way you've been no matter how out of line you fail this week he is not ashamed to call you his own he is not ashamed because he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning now I want you to go to Hebrews chapter 1. that was chapter 2. we read two we read 12 through 18 Tuesday night we read 6 through 11 this morning and now we're going to read Hebrews 1 4 through 6. being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels said he had any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith let all the angels of God worship Him verse 8. but unto the son he saith not to any of the Angels not to any of the four living creatures not to any of the Heavenly hosts of Heaven did he say anything like this he only said it to his son thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom the father the eternal spirit of the father full of grace and truth has spoken to the condescended son who is the word made flesh don't be confused not to people only one person here two offices both God oh God is saying to God I didn't write this the first church each messenger wrote it but unto the son he saith thy Throne o God speaking to God thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom now I want you to know this is powerful language this morning the book of Hebrews is life to the bride you hear what I'm saying the book of Hebrews is life to the bride if you get a revelation of the book of Hebrews you'll get a revelation that you have already taken the promise so many are waiting to take the promise that they've already taken but they don't understand it because they haven't seen it in identification because they don't see the parallel between Hebrews and crossing over but Hebrews is our crossing over song it is the theme of our possessing the land and so let God speak to your heart from the book of Hebrews let God speak Revelation to your heart from the Hebrew series that brother Branham brought us because there is so much truth in that we have listened to some of those tapes in service as a congregation and there is so much life in that Hebrew series for you and I to take a hold of in this hour now I want to go back Hebrews chapter 4. we weren't there this morning already but we've been here and I want to get 14 through 16. well you're just reading scripture that's right would that hurt anybody's feelings seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus Yeshua the Son of God let us would you read that for me only a few of you can read can you all read how many of you can read in here let me see your hand let me hear you all read this let us oh it works so good when we do it together hold fast you can't Loosely embrace your profession you've got to grab a hold of their confession your profession you've got to hold to it no matter what's going on in your life no matter what Sands are sifting and shifting around you no matter what circumstances are bringing to your doorstep and dumping on your porch no matter how many boxes of rattlesnakes come with your name on it you can't listen to that you can't look to that you can't bemoan that you can't even talk about that because the more you talk about something the more you speak about something the bigger it becomes in your subconscious it becomes a block it becomes a reality the truth is a great portion of what we're saying about our problems aren't true anyway your back is not killing you it may make you feel like you'd rather die but your back is not killing you you are you may be hungry because I preached until two but you are not starving to death or we say it the hungrier we get oh I wish he'd shut up I'm so hungry okay don't say it don't think it when you think it you send signals to your body that says oh you're so hungry my look what you got waiting on you when you get home and you start salivating mouth all watery and you start anticipating all of that and you missed the word that was sent to get you through it's a truth it's the truth I'm going to hold that back but it's the truth we've got to consider that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast with everything that we've got hold on to our testimony hold on to our profession there is prophetic power in the testimony you don't have to feel guilty for reaching out for prayer support that's exactly what you should do if you want to reach to your pastor do it if you want to reach to someone else you have confidence in do it that's not complaining that's not doubting that's getting a little help for prayer prayer support that's not what I'm talking about but I'm talking about the way we talk about what's going on in our lives we we magnify it we we are creatures of exaggeration you don't just have to be a fisherman to be an exaggerator we just have a tendency to remember something bigger than it was and better than it was and how many times have you told somebody that was the best steak you ever ate in your life we have kings and queens of hyperbole around here and you've just got to come to realize that everybody don't like what you like and you know sometimes you go back the second time and guess what you realize that what nearly as good as you thought it was the first time it got magnified in your mind let me tell you something the more you talk about your problems the bigger they get the bigger they seem the harder to get over them it becomes we need to talk or talk about something all right we need to talk about our great high priest somebody ought to talk about our great High priests this morning that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God somebody ought to be busy holding on to your profession to your confession to your testimony amen for we do not have a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in uh-uh say it again all points All Points tempted as we are here is the Mighty Key yet without sin you said but that was Jesus yes but he was our example remember we reminded you Tuesday night he was 100 God and 100 man somebody said doesn't that make him 200 percent no that's not God's mathematics he was both 100 God and 100 man there had never been another one like him there had never been a conception like his conception simarama said lied about it she was not she did not receive an Immaculate Conception she just wasn't a married woman she was a widow and she became pregnant with some man's baby and to keep her position as Queen in Babylon she she told this story she made it all spiritual and I think that's the part that vexes me the most it's the Christian world still celebrating a big old lie one that had nothing to do with the Virgin birth one that had nothing to do with a true son or a true God but all a fabricated lie when we have something so much more beautiful to celebrate here today we have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities who was at all points tempted even as we are just like we are yet without sin and I said to you Tuesday night everything we deal with on a personal or family level can be brought to the throne of grace and at this Throne or in this heavenly courtroom we can obtain mercy and we can find Grace to help in the time of need we must learn to come boldly before the throne of grace no shame no condemnation but filled with faith we are told that we have a high priest who is Jesus that is ever before the throne of grace on our behalf and look at what first John 1 9 says first John 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful go ahead all you got to do is confess it and he didn't say to the priest he tells us share our faults one with another he didn't tell us to confess our sins one to another you go tell the Lord you remember the couple that had young married couple that had committed adultery on one another is coming stood in that prayer line brother green was in the service brother Branham called out their sin he said what about you God begins to reveal that woman's sin and the Man Comes tearing down there gonna you know I don't know I don't know if he's going to snatch the woman out or if he's going to punch brother random I don't know who he was matter at he comes running down there and brother Brandon turned and said well what about you and your secretary the other night Friday night on the railroad track well what do you do about that brother random set now you going back here behind this curtain and you confess this to one another because you've sinned against one another you get back there behind that curtain and make that right and the Lord will forgive you we need a supernatural year like that we need so much of the Holy Ghost in here in the message if God be with us then where is all the Miracles December the 31st in the evening 1961 you don't have this he said this is one thing I desire to do one of my desires is to see a church without spot or without wrinkle that the Holy Spirit brother Graham that has been the longing of my heart to see a church that's so filled with God until sin can't abide in it anywhere the spirit of God calling it right out wherever it is he said I want to see that that is a supernatural Church it should not be our desire this morning to see our brothers and sisters embarrassed amen that's not what brother random is talking about but it should be our desire that God by the word by the Holy Ghost by the supernatural presence of God be so real in this house that if you should come in here with an unconfessed sin God would immediately put his finger on your heart and you would have to repent you would be compelled you would be driven to say Lord let me make that right so much so that you would be afraid to come and praise I taught you Tuesday night come praise anyway that's right I mean it you praise anyway because you know who you are both he that sanctify us and he who is Sanctified is one so you know who you are but I want you to know you come up here raise your hands and get in that presence and let that Supernatural power of God come upon you and you'd say who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord but he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart and you'd say Lord I confess my sin my unbelief in the attributes of my unbelief I confess that pornography I confess that I am confessed that encounter I confess that I lay that out before you Lord and this is what you need to know about it if we confess our sins we don't confess them so that we can get a license to go do it again we confess it so that we can be free from it [Applause] so we don't have to deal with that unbelief anymore come on because listen we're fixing to have to deal with many external pressures so we don't want to have to spend the rest of our year dealing with all the internal pressure we want to get the internal situation settled so that we can stand strong under the persecution or under the squeeze of our government and Under The Squeeze of violence and Under The Squeeze of threat and whatever else the bride will see before she gets out of here we don't want to have to deal with our internal issues all the time be burdened down trying to get over that you don't want to have to spend all your time trying to get over your jealousy you want to get all that settled so that you can be strong in in in the you know if you if you get weary if the horsemen in the footman wear you out what are you going to do when the Jordan swales come on you're going to need more of God when the swelling of the Jordan is around you isn't that what the scripture said God is faithful and just I want you to see that in fact I want you to read it to me he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins he's faithful and just faithful speaks about his covenant-keeping nature he will be true to this Covenant that he made with us through the blood of the body of the Lord Jesus a covenant is a legal binding contract for either of the parties involved to fail to carry out their contracted details and requirements as outlined in the legal agreement it can render the remainder of the agreed terms both null and void I won't talk to you about that just a moment have you ever broke your Covenant with the Lord let me see you let me see you let me see you have you ever broke your Covenant with the Lord sure we have if you chose anything but his righteousness now doesn't it seem like them that the whole thing would be null and void legally it would be but God couldn't allow that to happen he wrote a fixed contract he rigged a contract he didn't write a contract that can be held to the standards of American law he wrote one bigger than that he said both He Who sanctifies and he who is Saint divide is one that means in the eyes of God you could no more null and void the contract than he could Man look because she is him because the bride is the blood of Christ that's what the word said she is the blood of Christ it's like Jesus saying here they're going to throw the law of Moses into him and he said I am he'd already told him on Mount Sonya I am that I am [Music] I'm everything somebody said he's a to z that's not nearly big enough that confines him to the restraints of a language he's bigger than a language he's bigger than Hebrew he's bigger than English he's bigger than French he's bigger than Spanish oh he's from eternity to Eternity and even you're breaking your vow cannot know and void the contract because you have become one with the testator you have become one with him now if that makes you want to be spiritually lazy you're not hearing this with a revelation you're hearing it with a head knowledge when I hear this it doesn't make me want to see what I can do to be more like the world it doesn't make me want to pursue the things of life in the world anymore it makes me want to run to Jesus with everything I've got and say Lord oh papa look what you did you required so much of me and then you stepped out and became all that was required of me he who is joined in the Lord the Lord is one spirit with him why don't you say Amen somebody said you're getting a look here yeah yeah because I can't even mess this up when I do he sends Holy Spirit why do you think he needed three offices to finish this work why couldn't he have just done it all as a father seems to me like he could have just done it all as a father oh no then he couldn't have been a high priest foreign spirit in the heavenlies and been a high priest he had to come down here so he needed at least a second office anybody with me he had to come down here in flesh live among people just like him to be tempted even as they were tempted in all manner so that he could be a pure and perfect high priest and mediator and and recompense and Reconciliation and propitiation for their sin he became all of that and then he realized in the beginning that those who he had made Covenant with would fail him again and again and again everybody's on about Adam and Eve and their failure well I want you to know we don't have any guarantee that they didn't fail him again and we just read a book of failures you ever read this Bible it's a book full of crack pots it's a book full of murderers adulterers all all believers cheaters gamblers usurpers anybody here and yet God used every one of them he had a plan he had a purpose he did not look for Perfect People he needed the people that were not perfect so that he could sin the Holy Ghost into their lives and make them perfect yes so we need at least two father and son but he knew that you and I would mess up again and again and again and again so he said I'll tell you what I'll do I'll just put myself in them I loved him enough to come from the balconies of heaven and walk among them and bleed and die be tempted first and then bleed and die and resurrect on their behalf but I'll go one more than that because when I leave this world I know they're going to be tempted to trust me one minute and doubt me the next I know life is going to squeeze them here and shove them there and place them over Yonder so what I will do is I won't just be a God above them and I won't just be a god with them but I'll come right down and be a god living in them somebody help me somebody said well we know all of this yeah maybe maybe we do maybe we don't so this Covenant cannot be rendered null and void because of your failure because the holy spirit in you'll just start crying out on your behalf so you still have an intercessor you still have an intercessor the Holy Ghost just says oh oh papa look what a mess he made again [Music] may I just remind you that to condemned him would be to condemn yourself to banish him would be to banished elf to cut him off would be to cut off yourself so the Holy Spirit somehow I don't think he's probably really screaming to the father Etc I don't want you get too confused in the process of me but but he but I I don't think that's too far off because sometimes I can't intercede for myself because I'm so low I'm so ashamed I'm so burdened I'm so weighted down by my own failure that I can't even call out to God on my behalf anybody ever been there you just want to sit numb so disappointed in your reaction that you can't even say immediately Lord help me anybody ever been there I'm the only one I can tell I'm the only one well don't worry because the Holy Ghost is already crying out on your behalf the holy spirit of God in you is already making intercession for you with groanings that cannot be uttered the spirit of God is already calling out on your behalf whether you realize it or not and he's probably got to Watchmen somewhere already crawling out in your on your behalf there are intercessors who cooperate with the Holy Spirit I'll show you Hebrews chapter 3 . we're just covering one two three and four aren't we Hebrews chapter 3. verse one and two wherefore holy brethren holy holy is Joshua in here Joshua bring me this stew I'm sorry to do this to you when I turn is it up here when I turn a certain way I can't wherefore holy brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus thank you oh just a moment just give God praise it'll be all right Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory what's that I don't think that'll help me it's nerve any good wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house holy Brethren I want you to look at the one next to you you're my holy Brethren I know it's plural but say it anyway you ought to turn to him and say sometimes you make me so mad I could knock your block off but you are my holy brethren sometimes I get so disappointed in you I'd like to trade you in but you are my holy brethren absolutely you are my holy Brethren and the reason you are holy it's not because you always kept the rules I don't like the way the modern Church talks about conviction as though there is none there better be some and they just call all conviction rules I don't like to do that I think the most awful spirit in the world is the is the spirit that's opposed I used to preach in the charismatics because they're always talking about the religious spirit well what they mean is Holiness people you skirt wearing people you know you women and you you're you're religious that's why you do it you're religious but you know the ugliest Spirit I've ever met was not the religious and I've met I've met a lot of religious people I've pastored so I've met a lot of religious people but the uglier Spirit to me was the one who religiously opposed the religious spirit that was about the filthiest spirit I ever saw they would religiously legislatively opposed pose the religious spirit so constant so consistent until it got ugly and what that will produce is a perversion that you don't want any part of so there's a difference between keeping rules and regulations and believing that that is the source of your salvation the Bible tells us that we are not saved by works lest any man should boast it is the gift of God it's by the grace and mercy of God that we are saved we understand that but we also know that our faith is demonstrated by the works that we do amen dead Faith produces dead works but living faith will produce living works So You Are Holy Because He Lives in You and I showed you that I've taught you that it's not your hair that makes you holy I believe a woman should have long hair it's a glory to her it's power and authority on her head I believe the spirit that causes a woman to want to do other than that when the New Testament teaches its importance there's something wrong much much bigger than a hair bob amen but you must not believe that that alone because there are women out there that will live all kinds of prostitutes who have long hair to attract men who like long hair so that hair in itself to every woman is not a covenant to Every Woman it is not a Nazarite vow to Every Woman it does not bring power on her head and give her Authority because of the Angels right it's only to those who have surrendered their lives to the Lord so it's not that that makes you holy it's because he lives in you I told you many times there was a a mountain full of ordinary bushes there wasn't a holy Bush on the mountain until the fire of God fell on it and then it become a holy Bush and the ground around it became Holy Ground come on Moses had made that trail many many times and that ground had never been Holy Ground and that bush had never been a holy Bush but you put God on it you put the Holiness of God on something and it becomes holy Brethren you put the Holiness of God on a church and they become holy brethren you put the Holiness of God on a church and they become Saints not in the Catholic sense in the New Testament biblical sins that word partakers let me see that verse again verse 1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling partakers that word partaker in the Greek means sharing participating in as in a business agreement or contract you are partaking of the Heavenly calling you have been called with a high calling you may be living low beneath your calling but you have been called with a high and Heavenly calling and you have been made you have been made a participator A partaker in that Heavenly calling he did that on our behalf and that calling that word calling in the Greek is an invitation to experience a special privilege and responsibility an invitation how many of you are thankful for that now in the message hidden life with Christ Minneapolis Minnesota can I have a few more minutes it depends in paragraph 23 it depends on where your faith stands foreign how much Faith you got to have a measure to every man is given a measure somebody said I just wish my loved ones could have enough Faith to be saved doesn't take a lot of faith it just takes the measure that God gave you in the beginning that Faith just has to be turned in the right direction and you have to be willing to see your need and when you pray for your loved ones if you're praying for God to save them you're wasting breath I wouldn't pray such a prayer as that you're wasting your breath God saved my loved ones what would you like for him to do come again would you like for him to be born in a manger again would you like for him to die on a cross again would you is it necessary that he be resurrected from the dead again didn't he do it once and for all hasn't he done everything that he needs to do to save your loved ones so the problem is not God save my loved ones the problem is Lord let my loved ones see their need [Applause] if they can only see their need and I want to say something sometimes they can't see their need because we keep bailing them out we keep helping them out we keep getting guilted into helping them out when God is trying to squeeze them into seeing their need that is so good it is so true we think that we're doing them we think we're going to give them gifts and and make them want Jesus we think we're going to do this or that and the other and make them want Jesus that's not going to make them want Jesus they need to hit the brick wall it'll take that but I'm telling you for some people yeah that's the reason we don't pray whatever it takes save them you don't have to tell God how to get their attention he already knows how and he knows some all it will take is a brick wall boom and they'll say oh Jesus there was people all up and down that Highway last night where the when the cloud the fog Cloud dropped in in 20 or 30. I don't know I didn't get the total some people said 23 somebody said I counted 23 Vehicles ran into one another right out there in front of the apartments across from Shadowood 20 or 30 vehicles three people injured I think somebody said could have been could have been hundred I suspect that some of them had come from one party on their way to a next that blanket of fog dropped down and I don't doubt it because it was thick this morning when I got up when the sun was coming up it was still thick out there wasn't it but they said it was it was one minute not there in the next minute just dropped right down on top of them I suspect there were people in many of those cars upon impact calling on God I suspect many of them said Jesus Lord help us oh God no preacher to preach to them all it took was a little bit of trouble sometimes you absolutely need to pray Lord let them see their need in other words you will participate with God's covenant plan by getting out of God's way and letting God do what he needs to do you know the truth is we could save a lot of time with prayer requests around here foreign if we just let God be God I don't mean quit praying I mean pray the right way it depends on where your faith stands your salvation is good as long as I'm dying nobody loves me everybody hates me I think I'll eat worms I don't even belong in that church I don't even belong in my family I'm the black sheep you're you're not saved not according to that I don't mean to judge you I mean disturb you your salvation is good as long as your confession is good and how many of you know your confession is not to be based upon your performance your confession must be based upon your sacrifice [Applause] my lamb is good my love is good my lamb is good good my family my church don't want me but my lamb is good my boss don't want me but my lamb is good so my confession is going to be good it matters what you say because what you say is what you're thinking he said but when your confession drops I'm just you know okay maybe you don't believe but when your confession drops your salvation's gone now we know we don't lose our Redemption but we can absolutely bring ourselves out from under the blessing we can put ourselves under permissive will and out of perfect will and it Alters everything did you know your life is laid out in the mind of God as two paths perfect and permissive he's got a plan for both he's got a plan for doing it his way and a plan for doing it your way and if you choose to do it your way you drop down into that plan and you won't be blessed like you're blessed in his will there's a perfect plan there's a high calling come on if you want to if you want your 2023 to be more you know better but more prosperous more blessing than your 2022 come on up make a choice to get out of his permissive will and into his perfect will quit robbing God quit robbing god with your tide quit robbing god with your time quit robbing god with your affection come on up into that perfect life it's called the ascended life you can live a lower life that's permissive will or you can live a perfect life yes an ascended life that's perfect will I mean I said perfect I meant permissive down here perfect is up here and they run parallel and they're both in the mind of God so don't be confused they're both in the mind of God he sees you when you step away he doesn't panic he says I already got it covered it's covered he knows exactly what's going to happen he knows exactly what you're going to choose for he is a high priest are you with me for he is a high priest setting some of your word about me sitting down you're thinking that'll give me another three hours or more for he is a high priest setting setting at the right hand of God [Music] you don't even need me if we heard enough of these tapes you wouldn't even need me for he is a high priest sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions and what are those intercessions based on some of us are in trouble because if the lamb is interceding before the father with what we've been saying [Music] no wonder we're not getting the full benefit he cannot pronounce something before the father that you're not pronouncing he cannot confess something that you're not confessing look brother bam didn't say this one time he said this dozens of times for he is a high priest at the right hand of God to make intercession on your confession that's what happens in the message at Thy word Lord I'll let down the net Johnson City New York December the 7th paragraph 47. brother Branham said for God can only save you as you testify the prophetic power of a testimony well I just get so aggravated at my church because they just don't have testimony Services all the time I just wished I could testify in church more we have abused the privilege I love testimonies but we have abused the privilege we spend most of our time telling how hard it is to testify I'm not a public speaker then sit down come on that's not the father don't you know you're what you testified to is what he testified and then the next phrase is if I were to give one last night we'd had to watch tonight's service and somebody said oh I'm so thankful to God this horrible year is over but I'm sheltered I'm clothed and I'm fed isn't that enough did you starve in 2022 did you have to go naked in 2022 did you have a roof over your head in 2022 then then 2022 wasn't a year from hell 2022 was a year from heaven and you got exactly what you confessed Oh I thought that would really get us I thought that would bug us down it's sovereignty or it's not for God can only save you as you testify he can only heal you as you testify he is so it's not your testimony in here that's going to matter the most it's your testimony out there and it's your testimony before him well are we guilty of complaining to our sinner family do we get around our sinner family and tell them how horrible life is how hard it is to adjust if you do no wonder they don't want what you got because they got the same troubles you got what if you got this so much better than what they got you need to tell them whose hands you're in [Music] oh that's good he said he is sitting at the right hand of the father tonight to make intercession upon your profession it isn't how loud you cry how hard you beat the altar how many Good Deeds you do it's your it's your faith that saves you and it's not just your faith in the good time it's your faith in the hard time and he said if you'll confess with your lips coming from your heart he goes to work as a high priest sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercession upon your confession Hebrews 3 and 1. he cannot do one thing for you he cannot do one thing for you he cannot do one thing for you he cannot do one thing for you he cannot do one thing for you until first you believe it and accept it and confess it to be so you are a partaker you are a participant in this Covenant you must be an active participator in this Covenant we must believe it accept it and confess it to be so and the people today they'll go out and say well I felt better last night but today I'm so bad I just can't hardly stand it oh my God oh I wasn't coughing last night but I'm coughing today about to cough my head off you're gonna look mighty funny but today I'm so bad I just can't hardly stand it he said that's just exactly when you lose your confession and drop right down with his stripes with his stripes with his stripes with his stripes with his stripes we hear your symptoms with his stripes with his stripes I feel my symptoms with his stripes with his stripes you don't want to lose your confession you don't want to drop right down below faith let's go on no matter who you are how saintly how Godly you are you're a minister clergymen or you're a deacon or whatever you are or you've been a Christian for 50 years if you go out of here tomorrow and lose faith that you're a Christian and start telling people you're not a Christian anymore you're backslid you're gone only by your confession can you be saved that's the most powerful weapon that God put in the hand of a man is a committal and that's done in the heart and a confession that's done with the mouth and isn't that exactly what the Bible said with the heart with the heart confession is made with uh no what's it what's the scripture uh give me that scripture with a heart man believeth where the heart man believeth but with the mouth confession is made let's find that and read it I'm sorry with the heart man believeth that may not be right for with the heart for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation your heart in your mouth have got to be in line don't they they will be out of the abundance out of the Overflow of the heart the mouth speaketh your mouth doesn't always say what your heart says it's only when the heart gets full if the heart gets full of bitterness guess what you're going to talk about bitterness if your heart gets full of jealousy you're going to say jealous words but if your heart gets full of the word of God in the truth and the and the plan of and message of Salvation and righteousness you're going to overflow with that and that's what the mouth is going to talk about for with the heart man believeth under righteousness and when the mouth confession is made unto salvation we've got to stop here soon now let's go back to our quote only by your confession can you be saved that's the most powerful uh weapon that God put in the hand of a man a man is a committal and a confession it'll do it every time if you'll believe it accept it on those basis and believe it and stay with it keep confessing it when you confess it you know what a lot of people look at symptoms they always go around and say well now I don't feel any better that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's what you believe not what you feel it's what you believe not what you feel didn't you read these quote yeah two years ago and if we'd got it all we wouldn't have to do any repeating would we but we don't get it all I don't get it all in the message right down here in Macon Georgia Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph six for he's the high priest of our confession Hebrews 3 or what we confess he's the high priest to make intercessions upon what we confess is the truth anything that was included oh my anything that was included in the atonement is the it's mine healing is mine wholeness is mine the victory is mine every part of the atonement is the personal property of every believer when a man gets saved or a woman boy or girl God gives them a checkbook as it was with Jesus name at the bottom of every check for anything Redemptive for anything Redemptive blessing for any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for it's your personal property and look at that next line see what Factor Fear plays I'm afraid to ask big God told us to ask abundantly ask big we scratched the surface we ought to go deep right to the root of the thing don't be afraid to fill it out the prophet said the bank of heaven will recognize it oh that's good Jesus said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it whatever you ask the father in my name that I will do the unlimited unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ in that promise do you know what's mine this morning do you know what's yours this morning the unlimited unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah are you with me that ought to answer some of your questions it's the word the unlimited unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ in that promise Isaac Watts isn't he the one that wrote Joy to the World and he wrote that song when I surveyed the Wondrous Cross he wrote this hymn blood has a voice to pierce the skies Revenge the blood of Abel cries but the deer stream when Christ was slain speaks peace as loud from every vein pardon in peace from God on high behold he lays his Vengeance by and Rebels that deserved his sword become the favorites of the Lord I'm his favorite I'm going to read that line again pardon and peace from God on high behold he lays his Vengeance by and Rebels that deserved his sword become the favorites of the Lord one more one more refrain to Jesus let our Praises rise who gave his life a sacrifice now he appears before his God and for our pardon pleads his blood First Peter chapter 1. and we're going to close shortly First Peter chapter 1 verse 18 and 19 for as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold did you know you could have all the silver and all the gold and be lost you can't buy your salvation with my money for as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers verse 19 but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot look at what you were saved by look at what you were Redeemed by with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot when we are invited to the throne of grace this is what we carry with us not our Good Deeds we carry the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot are you still here good let me give you another quote and we might stop the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride paragraph 145. you become a new person amen not just an old one patched up by joining Church are trying to turn a new page here we are New Year's Day but you are a complete brand new unit listen how brother bam describes this God takes the old man and burns him completely out what sins are you talking about I don't remember them anymore from The Book of Life they've all been torn out I don't remember them anymore and Satan says look at Shelley do you remember when do you remember when do you remember when and God says what sins are you talking about I don't remember them anymore from The Book of Life they've all been torn out I don't remember them anymore you're not just an old man patched up he turned over a new Leaf that ain't enough he made a New Year's resolution that ain't enough you're a complete brand new unit God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself sins down your representation yeah that's big that's what the Holy Ghost baptism is for he brings our representation to us next next phrase no man can come to me except my father has drawn him and all the father has given me will come to me you see it and the congregation says amen and he says same same plan same way the last paragraph 146 Satan was or will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you I had old Devils been running me around all week long that's not what I sing you know what I sing a lot around my house around my life in my office I had to tussle with the devil and I won you ever heard that old song I had to tussle about the television and I won I'm not gonna sing Satan's been running me around I'm gonna sing I've been running him around you know the devil has to work overtime to try to trick us he's working overtime you know where his distraction do you know this world would have been burned over a long time ago had it not been for you and I being here because the devil's pulling all the stops out trying to change you he can't get you you don't belong to him you never did belong to him and he will not give up he'll hear this message and won't give up he'll hear what I'm preaching today and won't give up he'll come at you all week long and you just tell him we may have a tussle devil but I'm going to win this thing cause I know Jesus is the victor [Applause] that's exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother oh he contempt but that's all right because Jesus was in all manner but he cannot get a born-again Christian for God from the foundation of the world foresaw him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood and the blood and the blood and the blood come on you're not excited about that you couldn't repent enough you couldn't cry out enough as low down as some of us have been this week you don't have to go back 30 years to find a time when you were low down We Get Low Down often anytime we're living below where we're supposed to be living that's low enough isn't it and you know what you don't have to let the enemy pull you any further down when you recognize what has happened you recognize that the enemy's trying to you what you need to do is hush you know I have great advice for you in 2023 hush let the blood talk for you ever hear anybody go into overtime making excuses for themselves it takes me back to my school days when all the kids would come in and talk about the dog eating their foreign my grandmother died and I didn't get my homework done one time the teacher said one time Miss Harris my third grade teacher said how many grandmothers do you have you done had about five died this year she knew it was a lie she knew it was an excuse she knew he was talking fast and talking big to try to cover up shush let the blood talk a man will say things like well I had stress on my job and that's what made me stray my job stressed me out it wasn't your job that made that woman look prettier than your wife your job didn't do that to you come on foreign [Music] I've been through so much I deserve some fun I deserve some what what are you talking about oh shut up [Music] let the blood talk just say father forgive me I've been rotten in your sight let the blood talk let the blood talk how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God foreign the only thing he hears is your voice so hush he sees your representation amen he sees your seed he sees the life of God in you this does not let us off the hook but it teaches us that we don't find ourselves lost every time we fail we hold on to him last last quote where musicians are coming 1955. paragraph 33. the message law this is so good now the blood could not be perfect by an animal but the blood in Christ was now I will never be perfect brother Branham and you will never be perfect I will never be perfect in your sight you will never be perfect in my sight brother brand I'm talking but let's lay that aside because none of that really matters whether you think I'm perfect or not or whether I think you're perfect or not whether I think you're worthy of this redemption or whether you think I'm worthy of this Redemption none of that really mattered it doesn't really matter does it somebody said it doesn't really matter what about in God's sight he said I look at you as a human I look at you as a brother but God looks at you through the blood of his son as a redeemed one Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and now not what you've done you have done nothing to Merit it but it's what Christ somebody needs to read that but it's what Christ did that stand and it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest Valley all the blood that gives me strength from death [Music] it will never lose its power well thank God [Music] there's some thankful people here this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's power foreign [Music] [Music] what about the rest of you are you grateful come and worship come and worship with us if you're grateful come and worship with us oh thank God [Music] [Applause] [Music] flows

for foreign [Music] thank you Papa thank you Papa oh yes in Hallelujah [Music] you ready [Music] [Applause] to the highest why don't you let the blood reach out for you today [Music] to lose [Music] the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood day [Music] it will never lose [Music] foreign it will never [Music] lose it's high Hallelujah praise God how many of you are thankful for the blood now why are you preaching this again you just preached this two years ago laid out just like this why would you preach this again well I'll tell you why because when the Lord said to me a few weeks ago that 2023 was going to be a supernatural year I mean you know we could really say every year it's a supernatural year when you serve a supernatural God but we're expecting manifestation of the BR of the supernatural and manifestation of the Breakthrough in many situations in our lives and you've got to have something to focus you've got to focus on him you've got to have something to pull for when I started doing that he spoke to my heart and he said that we should come boldly that this should be a season of coming boldly to the throne of grace making our petition known to him and when I hear that invitation I immediately begin to think of all the reasons why it would be dangerous for me to just March in stand behind stand before the throne and lay out all my my complaints so to speak and I know that many are struggling with your own lives and you know that it's right you know that the invitation is yours but you hesitate how many of you know that that minute second of hesitation sometimes can keep you out of the water when the angel comes and troubles the water just that one second it's like you you hesitate one minute and you paralyzed I remember teaching the children a little bit to drive and that one little half a second hesitation can make such a difference where if you just if you just I believe you should be careful you should make sure and if you don't know just wait till they're all all come by but that sometime you would you wouldn't think it but that little bit of hesitation where you pull up and you can really cause you to miss your chance to get in the traffic and you pull out then somebody has to slow down you get honked at mistreated and it's the same way spiritually if you when the when the invitation comes when God makes something real and you start feeling the pull toward it and then you and then you remember you remember that argument that we talked about Tuesday night that you had with your wife or you remember the trouble you had with your with your roommates or you remember that that encounter you had on your job with somebody or you remember that disrespect that your teenager showed you and your response it was less than adult and that hesitation can keep us from yielding and answering our invitation to stand before the throne and the only way I know to help us overcome that hesitation to where we take one moment and look over our lives when we're supposed to only be looking to the lamb one moment of looking over your mess when you're supposed to be looking at the lamb can keep you from the promise it can delay it can delay the promise so your first reaction now as a Believer because of this word that we're being grounded in and rooted in your first reaction is if the Lord says to you come closer to me this year I'm here I am show me what to do Speak Lord your servant hears just like Samuel said to the old priest I keep hearing my name called did you call me did you call me did you call me finally the answer said no but you you next time you hear that voice call your name Speak Lord for thy servant hear it without hesitation how many of you want to answer like that no hesitation and that's why we're rooting and grounding this again let's worship [Music] [Music] I saw the Lord foreign [Music] [Applause] don't look at yourself [Music] foreign [Music] only [Music] your soul [Music] [Music] [Music] holy [Music] always [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] he realized that when he saw the Lord my eyes have seen the holy King the holy but God has a remedy for that cleanse [Music] right before delicious [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are you are home [Music] [Music] oh I was Lord without you I'm all right if I don't keep my confession right I get dirty dirty when I see your glory and your holiness causes me to be the reminder [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] love you You Are You Are Holy [Music] [Music] Ross [Music] oh oh so oh [Music] for a supernatural year [Music] prepare us [Music] so holy You Are You Are Holy Holy of all sing again oh Hallelujah [Music] holy oh you are holy Lord [Music] and then he cleansed [Music] [Applause] right before my eyes [Music] as the Angels derived

[Music] I saw the Lord Jesus Jesus [Music] [Music] he was pulling Glory Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] why don't you just lay your hands on one another right now [Music] somebody before some agree with find somebody to agree with [Music] you Jesus [Music] You Are Holy Lord [Music] [Music] so God knows Jesus [Music] just another moment of praying for somebody for my eyes have seen oh yes oh yes oh yes the holy [Music] night before my [Music] eyes [Music] as the angels [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in here you are [Music] so very homie so very holy [Music] holy Lord [Music] thank you Jesus thank you for the body Ministry thank you for Holy brethren thank you for men and women of faith Lord Jesus thank you for what you've done on our behalf you alone Are Holy you alone are worthy we look to you for our coming year [Music] it's just a little bleep on the calendar but oh God we want to step into the destiny that you have chosen for us in this season and in the seasons to come we don't ever want to be behind we don't want to lag behind we want to be up moving in synchronization with the lamb we dedicate ourselves Lord Anew and afreshed to you for this coming year [Music] speak to us so that you can speak through us [Music] Supernatural people who serve a supernatural God it is our desire to walk supernaturally before you sensitive to your voice [Music] ready to move when you say move God strengthened those who are needing a healing touch from you you sent your word to heal your children the enemy likes to stir up all the symptoms to distract us but our confession today is with your stripes we are healed we were and we are it is a finished work with your stripes we are delivered from the plaguing sins the nagging unbelief with your stripes the matter is settled because of the atonement we claim every Redemptive gift we take the checkbook and we claim that the signature is authentic you have given us children's rights the right of sons to make withdrawals on every Redemptive gift everything that was purchased by your Redemption Lord let our love for one another grow stronger this year may we be quicker to look over one another's faults may we be quicker to speak life into one another's lives and may we do what our Psalm of the Year says may we look to the Lord may we look to you may we cast up our eyes toward you Lord and may you show us mercy upon Mercy make us one in the body and we will give you praise and honor and Glory for it's in your lovely name we've gathered today the name of Jesus would you just love one another right around the front of the altar but you just move around [Music] and let God's love and strength flow through you to someone else you're not you're just not receiving if you're not giving part of receiving is to give part of receiving love is to give love you believe that sometimes it pulls us a little bit out of our comfort zone foreign so much help for us when we do [Music] oh you You Are Holy oh so oh oh yes you are holy Lord yeah yes you Are Holy [Music] oh so holy [Music] you are holy [Music] I've certainly missed you [Music] oh thank you for being here today [Music] Roar holy Lord [Music] you are holy

say again to you Happy New Year may God bless you in this new year and prosper you in every way remember your commitment to him make him Lord of all [Music] and he'll take care of everything go to Dada if you'll be quiet go to him [Music] God bless you as you leave today we're a blessed people don't forget to tell Hawk happy birthday [Music] as you leave today I don't know what the visitation is like at the rehabilitation in Phoenix City now nine to seven mask they might make you wear a mask you do have to sign in but if you would like to go in now you may find her out of the room and they might tell you where she is and they might not so it is possible that you would miss her but a lot of the time if you go they will tell you where she is and you could even go and see her in some of her rehab you wouldn't want to be in the way or hinder but you could wave at her and say hello hello and smile and blow her a kiss and go out I feel like it would mean so much to her if she could see some of us even for just a moment you'll see our faces God has done a tremendous work and there they believe at the rehab that they're going to be able to help her get through this process anything that you can do for sister Weems for meribeth and her family would be greatly appreciated this has certainly been a difficult time for them even Mary Beth had to go to Atlanta yesterday to pick her up just to keep the process from bogging down again and to bring her to the rehab so if there's anything that you can do for those for sister Weems for Hawk for Maribeth if you had a meal you could prepare or some kindness that you could show to them I know God would bless you for it some of you have been doing that I know God would bless you let me thank those of you who came and helped us to move the things back in the blue room yesterday brother man thank you for what you've done to help us get repaired out there and fixed and for every person that worked to get us through those those difficult cold days when you go out of here today it will be very difficult for you to think about the fact we were in the 20s last Sunday this Alabama winner is all right I know some of you want some more cold it'll come it'll be here don't worry you'll get a little more of it but it don't have to be in the teens to meet your needs I hope you're dismissed to go it's good to have Gabriel sometimes known as gab or Gabe it's good to have him with us this weekend so wonderful to have sister nakisha and Naya here after quite a while oh it's so good to see them aren't y'all in a hurry good to have Rachel back from her trip and whoever else was away your dismissed third time [Music]
