[0:05] foreign
[0:07] that is being prepared now is not the
[0:11] body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:14] the body that is being prepared now is
[0:17] Mrs
[0:19] Jesus Christ
[0:21] and where did she come from well where
[0:23] did Eve come from
[0:25] Eve came out of Adam where did the broad
[0:27] come from she came out of Christ and we
[0:30] are living in an hour where the bride
[0:32] that came out of Christ is making her
[0:35] way back
[0:38] into Christ as the bride was separated
[0:41] from Christ at Calvary
[0:44] when that spear went in
[0:48] blood and water flowed out and brother
[0:50] Branham said that was Christ that was
[0:53] his bride being pulled out of his side
[0:57] she was being separated from him and how
[1:00] did it come it came from a narrow place
[1:03] Justice fear
[1:06] just enough room for the tip of the
[1:09] spear to go in
[1:11] and we that Revelation drop how does the
[1:14] bride get back into Christ
[1:17] she's got to be back into him she's the
[1:20] body that he wants to dwell in in the
[1:22] last days how does she get back into him
[1:24] through a narrow place and that's why
[1:27] we're pressed on every side
[1:29] that's why all life isn't Grand
[1:32] that's why there's heartaches and
[1:34] hardships and pain along the way because
[1:37] to get back into crisis is not a wide
[1:40] way it's not a broad way it's a narrow
[1:44] way this word is a narrow way
[1:48] it's a straight gate isn't that what the
[1:50] scripture tells us what a privilege what
[1:54] a privilege to be invited to go back
[1:57] into Christ
[1:58] business
