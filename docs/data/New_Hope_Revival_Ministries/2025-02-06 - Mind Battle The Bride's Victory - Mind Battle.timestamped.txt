[0:00] but what we have failed to understand is
[0:03] the last
[0:04] battle it's not a battle from out there
[0:08] to
[0:09] inhere it's not an influence from the
[0:12] systems that we've been delivered from
[0:14] although some fall victim to that but
[0:17] the great battle the last one that the
[0:20] bride is winning yes she's
[0:23] winning we're winning in
[0:26] 2025 is a mind battle
[0:30] you see it's the lie in
[0:32] here it's the one you tell yourself it's
[0:35] the one the enemy Whispers to you from
[0:39] the inside out this is still a war zone
[0:43] because all of hell is turned on this
[0:48] little
[0:49] bride You Know The Enemy he is so
[0:52] jealous of
[0:54] you Satan is so jealous of you because
[0:58] you are already
[1:01] in the mind of God you are already what
[1:04] he wanted to
[1:05] be you already have authority that he
[1:09] wanted to
[1:11] have you already know his end and he
[1:15] knows his end and he knows that he
[1:18] cannot pluck you and I out of the hand
[1:21] of the bridegroom King the one who
[1:24] redeemed us with an Incorruptible price
[1:27] the price of his own blood he he knows
[1:30] that he can't change your
[1:33] election he can't even make you not a
[1:38] son so so therefore it's not your
[1:41] relationship with God that the enemy can
[1:43] have any influence over it's your
[1:47] fellowship I said it's your
[1:50] fellowship I said it's your fellowship
[1:53] that the enemy would like to mess up how
[1:56] is your fellowship amen how is your
[1:59] prayer life
[2:02] are you abiding in the
[2:04] vine have you discovered where real life
[2:07] comes from it's it's our it's our choice
[2:11] I I'm going to cleave I'm going to hold
[2:14] on to the word I'm going to lay my head
[2:16] on his chest I'm going to get as close
[2:19] to Jesus as I possibly can I'm not going
[2:23] to let this world affect my fellowship I
[2:27] must have fellowship with him and when I
[2:30] say that I don't just mean hearing the
[2:33] preaching I mean meeting him in the
[2:37] reality of who he is he is not only the
[2:41] word on
[2:42] page he is a Living Word a moving
[2:46] breathing word a walking talking word a
[2:51] delivering
[2:52] word he has an answer to mental
[2:56] illness you may not find it on the page
[2:59] but you'll find it when you've
[3:02] encountered The Living Word he's the
[3:06] same yesterday today and forever he's
[3:08] got an answer for anxiety he has an
[3:11] answer for
[3:12] depression he has an answer for the
[3:15] spirit of suicide he has an answer for
[3:17] the spirit of offense The Living Word
[3:21] has an answer for that and you'll
[3:24] discover that answer as you find
[3:26] fellowship with him telling you in order
[3:30] to find that perfect
[3:32] Fellowship we're going to find that we
[3:34] can't take our pastor in with
[3:38] us we need a
[3:41] pastor we needed a prophet messenger but
[3:45] you can't take him
[3:47] in he he can't go in there with
[3:51] you it's a place of privacy it's a place
[3:55] of intimacy it's a place of communion
[3:59] it's a place of
[4:00] fellowship and too many of us are
[4:03] missing
[4:04] it too many of us are missing it in our
[4:07] life because we're a
[4:09] drift we've let things come along we've
[4:11] pulled up our
[4:13] anchor three keys three important
[4:16] powerful steps to overcome number one
[4:19] keep your eyes on Jesus and off of
[4:22] people number two keep your eyes on
[4:24] Jesus and off of people number three
[4:28] keep your eyes on Jesus and off of
[4:30] people I I believe it I really believe
[4:32] it brother I really believe that we slip
[4:35] off because we've got our eyes on
[4:37] somebody else don't get them on your
[4:40] pastor don't get them on the Deacon
[4:42] don't get them on the neighbor don't get
[4:44] them on the
[4:45] prophet get them on
[4:50] Jesus see how many times you can tell
[4:53] somebody Jesus said Jesus said Jesus
[4:57] said don't be just a parrot be somebody
[5:00] who's had an encounter who's had
[5:03] Fellowship not once in your lifetime
[5:07] once a day twice a day three times a day
[5:12] there's a
[5:14] bride who's been called to walk in the
[5:17] spirit
