worship God together with this one empty and broken I came back to him a vessel unworthy and so scarred from sin but he did not despair he started over again and I Bless The Day He Didn't Throw the Clay Away sing with me oh but over and over he mows me and makes me into his likeness he Fashions the clay a vessel of Honor I am today and it's all all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay [Music] Away he is my Potter and I'm just the clay molded In His Image he really wants me me to stay but when I Stumble when I fall and my vessel breaks he just picks up all the pieces aren't you glad he does not Throw the Clay Away but over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness he Fashions the clay of vessel of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away sing with

vessel of Honor I am [Music] today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away if that's your testimony give him [Applause] praise how many of you that is your testimony he could have why don't you stand you'll be sitting a while and we want to go to the word today and I apologize to you and to brother gy for not being in here I didn't know we were going to do prayer request first and I just had to leave for a moment and when I got back here come Jesse to pray over the requests that I hadn't yet made and these are requests a lot of them have been sent in and and I and and I'm sorry about that I didn't mean to break the order but uh Jesse thank you for making the best of it being ready to pray anyhow and uh well today is the oneyear anniversary of my mother's passing and I wouldn't bring her back I wouldn't want her here uh even if she was in her right mind and whole I really wouldn't want to bring her back here I prayed too many years for the Lord to save her I prayed too long for the Lord to deliver her from all the addictions that had her bound and I wouldn't want her to be back here and have to keep fighting the fight that she's already one but I can't help but think of it you just can't help it and uh I'm thankful for the years that I had and I I wish so much that uh that it would have worked out I waited a little late in life to be married I wish that she could have met this sweet little baby girl that's soon going to to come but uh maybe somehow uh she will know and uh and see uh I think that they are given glimpses sometime of good life down here I don't believe they know anything about our struggles that wouldn't be that wouldn't be in his presence would it uh that wouldn't really be heaven but or or in that other dimension if they had to worry about us but I think maybe sometimes the Lord may allow them to catch a glimpse of of the good things that are going on down here and uh but there're they don't miss us I hate to tell you that they don't miss us if you think they're grieving cause cause you're not with them they're not they have everything those that are with the Lord they have everything their soul longed for and we grieve until we see them and then we won't ever grieve again did you know you'll never miss your lost loved ones if there are some that don't make it you'll never miss them right you'll never even know they didn't make it you know that song about the the circle being broke you'll never know if it was broken can you imagine somebody said I can't imagine that you wouldn't remember oh you won't you won't remember God wouldn't let you do that he wouldn't torment you through eternity so if you're going to pray any prayers for them you wouldn't want to wait till you got there when you wouldn't think of it if you want to pray any prayers for them you want to do that right now amen let's thank God for these musicians and and all that they have given of themselves we really appreciate them every one of [Applause] them and and I'll just mention here we don't make a big uh a big thing of the picture of the cloud but uh the photograph that is often so so often associated with the ministry of brother brandham was taken uh this Wednesday on 228 many many years ago and uh we don't have a whole lot to say about it we don't uh have it hanging in the church or anything but but we still believe I still believe that God has used it as a as a sign uh but remember the signs are not for believers if you're waiting for a sign you must not be a believer the Bible says said the signs are for the unbelievers so we're not looking for signs if God sends them then we wait for the voice I'm most thankful for the voice I have the photographs and I share them if they need to be shared but uh that is not why I'm still walking in this truth it's because it lines up with the word of God we take everything back to the scripture it's important isn't it yes so we are here I know you're standing but we are here and today I'm going to be reading in 1 John chapter 4 beginning in verse 7 for those of you who might be tuning in to this service I I saw Saints in the Netherlands I I saw many from across the United States South Africa I saw India and Nigeria and other places mentioned by name thank you so much for letting us know where you are streaming the service from if there's anyone who hasn't been with us in this series The Lord spoke to us prophetically for this Gregorian year of 2024 and he told us it was going to be a year of mountain climbing I've already been up here I've already been having to make some uphill strides but remember that when you've gotten a little bit uh a little bit of effort you you've climbed made a few feet or so you you don't have to come back down right now if you don't want to we're on our way now to the top just remember that the journey from here on out will not be level ground just understand that from now on the journey is going to be uphill somebody said well that's terrible news it's actually very good news because it means you've arrived at Zion spiritually and now you're making your way up because the mountain is not just Pine Mountain or or some uh Appalachian mountain range the mountain is the Mount Zion that we have uh seen in God's word associated with with that which is eternal and associated with the Throne of God amen you know I've had an experience where I saw the throne and behind the throne was the mountain very interesting behind the throne was the mountain and uh we Are Climbing that spiritually if we wanted to be concerned about where we are we should be concerned if we're stalled if we're not moving but as long as we're moving it testifies that there's Spirit life within us is anybody listening this morning there Spirit life within us because Zion is not only a place sir it's not only a destination but Zion is a people and we are the people of Zion those who are walking in the revealed word of the hour we are the Zion and so we have great great anti anticipation the only thing is walking up climbing up a mountain is not always easy you lose your breath sometime your your shins kind of give you trouble sometime even even other muscles that we won't talk about but even other muscles get strained when you're climbing but oh how nice it is to be able to to turn around and look out and see I've made some progress I'm higher than was before and that means the higher I get the the farther away I get from The Temptations that the enemy has has placed down here in the low lands Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on Heaven's table land a higher plane than I have found Lord plant my feet on higher ground and then let me climb some more and so a as we get get ready to go to the scripture I want to just remind you and mention for those who haven't heard the Lord said it would be a year of mountain climbing and he warned me in the spirit that we should be very surefooted we got to know where we're putting our feet and we've got to calculate and make sure that where we plant our feet is solid ground that it's not sinking ground that it's not rolling ground you know the rocks and the gravel will will roll down and and you you think you've got a sure foothold but you may not so you want to watch how do I watch I watch carefully in the spirit to make sure that where I'm standing is is solid ground and I heard five voices giving me five pieces of instruction after I asked the Lord how will we do it how will we be very surefooted how will we do that and the first voice I heard was the voice of of brother green and he was quoting brother brandham and he was saying to me by the spirit that we should keep whatever we do whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures then I heard another voice booming out almost like a thunder I recognized it to be brother bram's voice and he said whatever you do stay in the middle of the road I heard a female voice sister Ruth said praise until the spirit of worship go whatever you do whatever you do praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory now I was going to slip out a little bit early a a but I couldn't because I was standing in the glory that presence of my lover was here I felt him in such a profound way I didn't want to disturb that well the truth is I didn't want to unplug myself who would ever want to if you if you happen to know you've gotten plugged in who'd ever want to unplug it's hard it's very hard that's why I try not to ever especially if I'm conducting I try to never go out but sometimes I just absolutely can't help myself but I I didn't want to leave in the middle of that moment when when I could look around this room and see such sweet Expressions it's one of the things that I enjoyed the most the songwriter captured it Lanny wolf when he wrote surely the presence of the Lord is in this place he talked about and the glory on each face it's one of the things I enjoy the most a lot of us we wear a sour face I I going to have more than two amens boy I can call some names in this room but then I'd be I'd be pointing back at me because my family says sometime you look so grumpy well I don't have a mirror I don't always know what I look how I look what I look and we look grumpy sometime there's no better thing than to look across a congregation and see the glory of the Lord on the countenance of the redeemed Hallelujah especially when you know they're grumpy by nature but they get in that presence and it makes them sweeter woo and you look beautiful sir don't be offended when somebody says you look so beautiful in that Glory oh it changes everything it certainly does and so then the fourth voice which I haven't mentioned until today it was uh I'll tell you in just a moment let me read the scriptures first so you can sit down some of you look hardly able and I don't want to if you always always even if I ask you to stand always if you are are weak in some way or or pain in some way a lot of times when I'm in pain sitting down is not what I need I need to do stretches but I better not do them on the platform right so anyway first John chapter 4 but you do what what you need to do and verse seven beloved let us love one another is my tie real crooked well it does matter cuz I have to see it again is said I just loosened it cuz it was about to choke me and so I thought I would loosen it but usually when I loosen it it's catty woned over here and ma wouldn't have liked that at all I don't want to be caty Wampus today and sometimes I get text but I'm already preaching so I'm not reading my text while I'm preaching and then I see sister Anna's real or brother Hawk's moments and and I said oh my goodness why didn't somebody tell me beloved let us love one another huh for love is of God I would like to say love is God and God is love and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God you need to know that there there in this world it's very hard to manufacture love for those who are not of your family those who are not of your tribe it's it's by only by the Lord by his help by connection with him that you can develop a love for strangers that does not come natural in today's society and even the scripture is clear he tells us everyone that loveth is born of God it's a spiritual thing to be able to love your enemy it's a spiritual thing to be able to love a stranger amen but it's possible when we have the birth everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for what God is love God is love so the few of you that wrinkled your face when I said that a moment ago I was just getting ahead of myself he is love and this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him that's good herein is love not that we loved God that's impossible but that he loved us we couldn't have loved him as a thought in his mind now we can love him because we're expressed and born of the spirit we're born of the natural birth and now the spiritual birth and we can love him and that's why we ought to be careful when we're talking about the unregenerated and we say things like but he loved the lord it's impossible to love God unless you've had a birth now what does that mean it means we don't really understand perhaps the definition of what it means to love the Lord L how many of you know he said if you say you love me and don't keep Covenant with me you're a liar and the truth is not in you so it's it's not that we could love him in that condition but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins that's more than a covering for our sins that's rectifying the wrong beloved if God God so loved us here is where we struggle even after the birth beloved if God so loved us I'll let you read we ought we should we should also to love one another and that means more than those who love us it's easy to love those who love us that's not hard no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is what perfed matured perfected completed in us we as we learn to love one another by the spirit we perfect the love that God has toward us let me say it again the love that God has toward us is perfected it is matured as we learn to show that love one to another and then that becomes perfect love it becomes matured love it becomes I love you whether you love me or not yes and remember that love is not what we say it's what we do no man all right let's go on hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his Spirit who has the earnest of the holy spirit in your life who has the baptism you receive an Earnest of the Holy Spirit through the through the beginning of the birth process justification but then we receive more than the earnest when we receive the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes I said when we receive the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we have more than the earnest are you telling us that we're not born again unless we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes I'm telling you that our Born Again experience is not completed it's a process until then when we receive the baptism of the holy spirit that is the completion of the new birth now the new birth is required for you and I to make the Rapture am we have to have the new birth there are those who their requirement is to call on his name but your requirement as a part of this bride body you're going to have to have a born again experience because we're not made to be survivors sir we're made to be Overcomers somebody say amen and so if you don't know if you don't know that you know that you know that you know that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need him you need him and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world a few more verses whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God and we have known and believe the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him now that's that's not the first first time several times he's talking about we're in him and he is in us and love is the common denominator if you want to have that Oneness experience love is the common denominator to be one with God is to demonstrate mature love you understand that let's go on I know you're standing herein is our love made perfect completed mature that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there the next verse excuse me there is no fear there is no fear there is no fear in love but perfect love so if you are dwelling in fear and we all have and we all do from time to time but remember that when you are dwelling in fear you're are not dwelling in love and therefore you are separating yourself from God if you're in God and God in you you can't do that in the dimension of fear you have to do that in the dimension of love so every time you get out of love into fear you're pulling back it's not that you're no longer a part of him it is that you're no longer drawing close to him but to fear means you're pulling away from him oh my that makes me want to deal with every fear how many of you'd like to deal with every fear because you don't want to be here's your picture you're pulling away if you are dwelling in fear if your thoughts are dwelling in fearful thoughts but perfect love does what it casteth out fear because fear I want to ask ask you does Fear have torment let me see your hand does Fear have torment he that fearth oh I saw those wrinkled faces again my my my my my a few minutes ago when I said basically this same thing you're pulling away he that fearth is not made perfect in love there's no maturity in your love when your love becomes mature you pull away from fear not not pull away from God a few more verses we love him and this is so beautiful this is so true we love him we like to testify I love the Lord do you know why you do only because exclusively because he first loved you that's why I love him today that's why I can love him today that's how it's possible for me to love him today he loved me first if a man say I love God if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that H how can you be walking in perfect love how can you be walking in mature love how can you be walking in complete love if you're a liar for for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen I better read that one again if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar he's actually he's on his way you know the Bible tells us what happens to Liars so you're actually Walking In The Way of the Wicked be better not to say you love your brother and not and not come on come on it says if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen are you still with me and then finally verse 21 and this commandment have we from him commandment now that he who loveth God loveth his brother also God help us would you would you pray with me Lord help us would you pray Lord help me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may have your seat whatever you do keep your balance in the scripture whatever you do stay in the middle of the road whatever you do praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory whatever you do learn to love the fourth thing that I heard whatever you do learn to love the voice that spoke that to me was a friend of mine who has gone on to be with the Lord some years ago I I think on Valentine's Day I think it was right around February the 14th that uh that God took Bob Jones home for you that are watching this and you don't know who that was it is not Bob Jones of Bob Jones University but Bob was one of the what was called in the charismatic and Pentecostal World Kansas City Prophets and regardless of what you think about that movement there were many great things that were taking place in those days and we're thankful for that Bob was not a perfect man he was a fallen man he was a hurting man he had made mistakes and he had sinned and he had lost a lot of of his ministry and one day God said I'm going to raise him up and I'm going to use him again and I'm going to use him in a different way because he's a different man anybody with me I got confidence in that I can believe in that I can believe that if we let our falling and our failures change us that perhaps all is not lost some people never really learn from their lesson some people remain the same prideful bragging person that they always were some people remain pompous and uh entitled and they don't seem to understand that God allows these fallings I want you to understand the the Bible tells us that God has the power to keep us from falling I know a minister he's an aged man now in this message who was a friend of mine and if I was near him he would still be a friend of mine today he made some awful mistakes he sinned against God he would have perhaps gone further into that sin he was in a taxi cab boy I've got your attention now just talk about somebody's sin and everybody listens come on he was in a taxi cab with a young prostitute that he had chosen off the street in a foreign field where he was serving a a short extended a short missionary trip I don't want to say make you think that he was living in that foreign field he was not he was there for a few weeks I don't know how long and had been many times I don't know what had happened before it's really none of my business but I know that this time in a moment of weakness that I cannot defend he thought perhaps to himself I'm out of the country no one will know how many of you know you can live in a big city and and still a small town all at the same time when I was staying so many weeks in Jerusalem the Jerusalem Jewels used to tell me Jerusalem is the big city that is really a small village and you'd be surprised how many connections you make with people did you know that business is still conducted on an honor System in in Jerusalem right now did you know that if you go into a uh furniture store and you wanted to buy a piece of furniture there are still stores in Jerusalem and tpot that will ask you for payments and they will take your signed postdated checks you can give them 12 checks or however many payments made out in the right amount signed and dated for the month that it's due and you can walk out of there with the furniture when I learned that and I've just recently heard it again when I learned that I thought how can that be possible in America everything is done on a credit card and people got to have that credit card is a guarantee that you're going to pay but in Jerusalem I walked in as a stranger bought a house full of furniture with checks that were no good somebody said what do you mean I mean I don't I mean that I mean there was some money in there but not enough to cover every one of those checks so I said to the man there's not that much money in the bank he said all you got to do is make sure that on the such and such of the month there's that amount of money in there he said that way there's no interest you you don't charge me Interest no you don't Char so this city where the missionary was was was more like a small town I would think than he realized and and as this young woman gets in the back of the taxi with him she immediately recognizes him by name and she waits until he has propositioned her and told her exactly what kind of business he's interested in conducting with her boy we'll get the streams on this one at some point in the evening before there was any physical exchange between them she let him know my brother is the song leader at the church where you're ministering needless to say his evening on the town immediately became a missionary work as he be began to try to explain to her that now he's concerned about her soul God was gracious that man didn't lose his marriage he lost a huge portion of his ministry confidence was really broken in a lot of people's minds but in all of that loss God used that man in the latter years of his life because he was a different man now wouldn't it be wonderful if he could have become a different Man without having to go through that kind of a loss that's similar to the kind of falling and loss that Bob Jones went through in the earlier part of his ministry by the time I met met him his wife had passed away he was already an older man very swiftly turning 80 getting ready to be 80 quite soon within a couple of years of meeting him and I met him by the invitation of a friend who said why don't you come down Stephen and Stacy and spend some time with us Bob has just gotten married and he'll be on his honeymoon at nearly 80 and what he likes to do now is get up and go to breakfast and talk until lunch have a little lunch and go home and take a nap in the afternoon when he gets up he's always had a dream so we'll meet for dinner I don't normally eat three meals a day we'll meet for especially two or three in the same restaurant at the same table we'll go to dinner then and we'll talk about the things of the Lord and I said well that sounds like an opportunity I I would very much like to meet him and so that's what we'll do and Stacy and I went down and we did that for 5 days in a row just like we said and over the next couple of years we were with him different places where he was speaking and where we were speaking and we had some wonderful fellowship with he and his wife Bonnie and we learned that the gift that he had was quite astounding I don't know that it was a perfect gift but it was nonetheless a gift of operating in a man who had been less than perfect the gifts and callings of God are without repentance I went through that not as a disclaimer but I went through that because I know there will be those who Google search and I wanted to beat you to the punch and tell you his Doctrine was not perfect his past had not been perfect but nonetheless he made a difference in our lives he spoke over all of our children he spoke over my wife he prayed for her when we were down one time and she was pregnant with with Mariah and she had been leaking amniotic fluid and the the Midwife and the doctor was becoming very concerned that there would not be enough amniotic fluid to last the duration of the pregnancy and that she might actually lose all of her water that there might all all actually be a a bursting of the amniotic sack that would cause all the fluid to drain out which would make a a real emergency situation and we were going to mention to him what it was but we were nervous to do that because he was busy with other things talking about other things and as we were standing outside on in the front of Hazel's restaurant in Orange Beach Alabama Bob turned and he said I want to pray for you and he began to pray for her and he prayed a strange prayer he prayed concerning the amniotic fluid that he knew nothing about he prayed that there would be enough and that God would not let it leak and that it would that she would go full term and that everything would be all right and and uh one of them either he or his wife said something about strengthening the sack well God heard that prayer there was no more leakage there was no more loss of amniotic fluid in fact it filled up it filled up with fluid and the sack became so tough that it never broke on its own and I know this is too in too much information especially for names are coming to my mind not all firsttime mothers but some firsttime mothers this is too much for you but I was in the room when they were going after the sack to try to pierce it and you know they use something like a crochet hook is that too much information that's kind of what it looks like like well I want you to know it took everything they had wasn't painful to my wife let me throw that in was it darling shake your head no so everybody can see you it wasn't painful but it wasn't a whole lot of fun to watch as they would go in and they would think they caught it with the with the hook and then it it was so tough it wouldn't they couldn't hang it so finally under great force they were able to burst that bag and my wife and I it's not funny at the time but shortly thereafter we laughed because we realized that God heard that prayer and so strengthened that uh amniotic sack that they could man could hardly break into it because God was protecting Mariah Bob was the kind of person I am so sorry I didn't fix it Bob was the kind of person that would call me and tell me what I had dreamed more than once I would have a spiritual experience write it down tell another person and before before the day was done he would call me I would always tell my wife or PK so that somebody would know and before the day was over he would call me and tell me what I had seen and what it meant so I I have to have some confidence in that I was a little surprised that I heard his voice so profoundly in this experience because he has been gone so long he never ministered here we never invited him to minister here because there were certainly some differences in our Doctrine he had a lot of respect for brother brandham and I never heard him say we spoke of brother brandom's Ministry many many times I never heard him say anything but good real positive words uh of affirmation concerning brother branham's Ministry he called one time and he said uh Bonnie called and she said Steve Bob wants to come and see you guys you could have knocked me over with a feather I wasn't expecting his visit I'd never invited him to visit I had no idea he would ever think about coming here for a visit visit but they got in their automobile from South Carolina and they drove all the way down here and I said sure we'll get a hotel for you all to rest and my wife and mom will cook and we'll have wonderful Fellowship he said she said that's all Bob wants he wants to come and see you he wants to be in your home he wants to go and anoint pray over your church property and uh he wants to to eat country food and so he came my wife and my mother made a big turkey meal for him and my you should have seen him that that uh hillbilly that he was he said this is some of the best turkey I've ever had in my life as he goes in for more a few profound things happened while he was here he prayed over several people he came that day we brought him to the church and he went around in the mud around the back of this church and anointed the four corners of the church and he spoke some things prophetically that we have seen God bringing to pass brought to pass bringing to pass and we're expecting that the rest of it will also come to pass but one evening he was with us for two nights and one evening I knew of a of a great rift that had come between him and another elderly friend of ours and the Lord began to speak to my heart and say you need to speak to Bob about that being made right and as the story he was telling a story and he spoke with a little bit of bitterness concerning this great broken relationship with a a little criticism and my head was just spinning because God was talking to my heart you need to tell him that's got to be fixed I was a little intimidated to do that I really needed the Lord's help he was sitting in our rocking chair and about that time he needed to go to the washroom he gets up and leaves the room and Bonnie his wife looks right at me and pointed her finger and she said now Steve what the Lord is talking to you about you're the only one that can fix you're the only one that can do that I can't speak to him about that I've already tried but he has confidence in you right now God is using you and she said I'm going to pray that you will have the courage to speak up to him because I know the Lord is talking to you and and I'm going to pray that you will have the strength and the courage to do it I said thank you so much I was a little bit shocked because I knew she knew and when he came back in I didn't want too much time to pass I began to speak to him remembering that he was my Elder but the authority of the Lord came into that room and I began to tell him we're not promised tomorrow and these are things that have to be settled and it doesn't matter who was the most wrong you both were wrong by your own confession you both were wrong and now it's got to be made right you've got to make the effort it doesn't matter whether he's willing or not you've got to reach out and make the effort well I want you to know he heard me he huffed and puffed he was an older man he huffed and puffed but he heard me and after they left here they got home and he said to her I want you to call that other individual I want you to set something up I'm going to take Steve's words to heart and I'm going to make sure that I have nothing in my heart against that brother we're going to get it worked out and the meeting came I was unable to go invited but unable to go and they made peace it wasn't too long not too much time had gone by I don't know how much that I was walking through there at the end of a service one night and the phone call came that he had coded and it wasn't too long after that that he was called home he had this experience that he called did you learn to love and it was his voice I want to make sure you understand what I'm saying it was his voice and he had a very distinct voice and a very distinct accent and I've heard other people that could mimic it and sound just like him but I can't but he spoke to me in that experience I didn't see him I just heard his voice and he said whatever you do learn to love my question was how do we do that when the voice said be very surefooted so I don't know how it fits in church but love is a key we know that by the word of God we know that by the message of the hour and now we know by this spiritual experience that one of the keys for you and I to remain surefooted as we climb this year and in in all future climbing one of the keys is to make sure that we have learned to love one another is anybody with me now it's just 1:00 on 9 till and I know it took some time but there are so many here that didn't know Bob never had an opportunity to meet him and if I would have thought about it I would have had a picture of him with us or or a picture of him in in my office and would have let you see him he loved Eagles and most of the time no matter where we were speaking how fancy it was he had a big eagle sweatshirt on and a cap with an eagle on it and he was just as as country as country can be and he would literally have a chicken wing in one hand and pointing Prophecy with the other he was just an unusual character he especially loved to go where they throwed rolls and could he ever eat Thro rolls he said I don't know how to it is about it but they taste better when you catch them I just want you to know a little bit about his personality and uh I want to share with you the experience that he had and if I have time I'll preach some of this if not we'll pick it up Tuesday night and go on but I want you to hear a portion of the experience it's too much to do today it's long so I'm going to leave out a lot but let me explain to you that he was told in an experience that he had to preach against three evils that were about to show up in the world like never before one was the sin of homosexuality and he was to preach that aids was a result of that sin and that God was allowing that plague to come to this nation and around the world to show how he felt about that unnatural Behavior this the the the other thing was he was to cry out against abortion and to reveal the heart of God concerning abortion and the third thing was methamphetamines the Lord spoke to him and said that there is about to be a drug that will be cooked in homes using ingredients that are readily available at any drugstore did you know that's why you have to sign for psea fed because there there's a picture of Bob oh he didn't have his Eagle he didn't have his Eagle sweatshirt on that day there he is anointing the four corners of the church is that all I'm glad you could see him that's the reason why you have to sign because the ingredient there's an ingredient in there that used to to cook meth crystal meth when God let Bob have this experience it was early perhaps 70s I'm not sure I'm sorry exactly when it was maybe maybe late 60s but it was certainly before these things had the prominence that they have today I'll try to get the date and let you know later I apologize I wanted to to keep the experience as brief as possible and make sure I had the important things and I forgot to get exactly when he had this experience he was not willing he said it'll ruin me if I start telling the charismatic world that aids is a is a is a disease a plague of God's judgment on the on the Earth because of a sin that's going on he said they won't be able to swallow that he said I knew if I could get to the Holy Rollers they would believe me but he said they didn't have any confidence in me he said I knew that the message wow there he is posing with Mariah and the rest how precious no there is an eagle there thank you so much for doing that he said God I can't do that it'll cost me everything he went to a church that he was very familiar with and he began to share what was on his heart and they attacked him publicly and he was unable to to share the remainder of what he had it grieved him so bad over a a short period of time he began to have a pain in his stomach that was so bad that ended up being an aneurysm in the stomach and he was bleeding to death without even realizing what was happening he ended up in the emergency room and in the hospital and Gang Green was beginning to set in his bowels and the doctor said I've never seen a case like this I've never seen anything quite like this and uh over the course of uh of a few hours and maybe a couple of days he coated again on the table and had this experience and I'm not going to tell you the first part of the experience he was in a cave and there were some other things that took place but as he comes out of that cave he saw two lines very distinct lines and he called them one line he said that was the line of The Forsaken and the other line was the line of the righteous and now I'm going to read this to you in his own words this is like an interview so it may sound like like like that to you as I read it yes he said I'm out of the tunnel and I see this line and there were people in line that I there were people in the line that I was in something said look to your left and I looked to my left and for each two people that were in my line there were 98 people in the other line for every two in the line of the right there were 98 in the line of The Forsaken he never forgot that he said only the people in the other line could not walk he said they were like on a roller that you would see in the supermarket they had no control over their ability to walk or move and they were just rolled on a conveyor belt and then he explained why they couldn't walk he said they were r wrapped up in the gods that they served on the earth so the faceless man began to show me he said this was his God and I looked at as I looked at them and I saw them as they begin to look and see that sunlight in those eyes each one's eyes got big and their mouth dropped as they saw that man standing there in great light you could see them saying he is real we mocked and we laughed but he is real I won't take the time to describe but he described several individuals and one was wrapped in a in what looked like giant currency dollar bills and he was so wrapped in it he couldn't talk and he couldn't move his arms and he couldn't move his legs because on Earth he had served money as his God and he described several other sins a sin of lust and several others that he saw and it just broke his heart to see that they weren't even able to speak for themselves now this is a symbolic experience you understand how dreams and Visions work and he said they couldn't move on their own and they couldn't even defend themselves in the presence of that light and part of the reason was they were wrapped up in the god in the sin that they had served down here on the earth now that resonated with me as I told you some weeks ago because my grandmother had had a vision of hell and in that vision of hell she said the same thing she said I saw him standing there on the brink of hell with with bottles empty bottles around their feet and she set an empty bottle in both hands as they turned those bottles up to their lips and tried to get one last drop and there was none and they throwed those B botles down and grabbed a couple of more and they just continued to try to get one Vapor of alcohol out of that bottle and were unable to do so she said I saw people that were that were holding on to cigarette packs and they were smoking one right after another had one in one hand and one in another hand and they were they were alterating hands to draw and they were sick she said they were green and I saw them turn and begin to vomit and as soon as they were done vomiting they were putting that back in their mouth it had a profound effect on her we're not saying that's how it is I hope you folks are mature enough to understand we're talking about symbols sir and the symbol the the understanding from the symbol I think is most accurate I think there's something in that place where you're driven you're com you have a compulsion to continue to do the thing with no pleasure involved no pleasure whatsoever there was no pleasure in those Empty Bottle there was no pleasure no coming for the nerves it was it was the man was driven I want to move past that now to the line of the righteous but before I do let me tell you that he's saw that he saw that conveyor belt continuing to roll and as they left the presence of the one who was standing there in the great light he said that conveyor belt went over a cliff like that and I heard them as they fell off screaming into that place of Torment now remember he's on the on the hospital bed dying when this is happening to him he said then I saw in the line in front of me as the the line got closer and closer to the light I began to hear him speak one thing to each of them he said I saw a black woman that was around probably around six foot tall she was such a huge uh uh colored woman he said she must have weighed around 300 lb but he said she had over a hundred Angels standing with her in that line so I asked the faceless manh so many angels He said she was an evangelist she was a soul winner on the earth and a great mother in her time it's her time now and she's going home and there are many left behind that are grieving her loss I watched as she came close to him he asked her one question I want you to know already it wasn't what church do you go to who your pastor is can you show us your baptism certificate you didn't ask her what prophet had helped her get there he asked her one question daughter did you learn to love she threw up her hands and said oh yes Lord oh yes Lord I learned to love then he kissed her and the double doors opened up into his heart he put his arms around her and she said I saw he said I saw her as she went right into the Lord's heart and those angels went with her remember this is symbols he said I asked the faceless man why are they going home with with her he said because they helped her in her life and Ministry on Earth and now they're going home with her you see he's telling us now in this interview you're going to judge angels and he said one of the judgments will be how they helped you and served you in Ministry you will commend them you will testify to others for Angels have no testimony he said their only testimony is when a saint remembers that they were helpful to them in life so when they go home they'll have that testimony be your testimony he said they will be equal partakers in the work that we have done for the Lord he said also everybody that's praying for these Ministries I saw the people that were never seen out in the open were equal partakers with that black sister for they supported her and prayed for her so what she did they had a testimony beyond anything they imagined he explained that to me one time by saying he said I saw I saw ministers and I saw people gathered with them and I knew that they were those who had prayed for them and fasted for their Ministry and so forth and when it came time for them to receive their reward God was also giving rewards to those that had given offerings to help them to go those who had prayed for them those who had made sacrifices to support their Ministry when it came time to be rewarded they also shared in the reward how many of you like that thought Bible said so the Bible tells us we don't do anything in the name of the Lord that's not remembered Great Book of remembrance is kept for every prayer you pray for somebody else for every sacrifice you make to be a blessing in somebody else's life as you're learning to love is anybody still here said the second one I saw in the line was a little girl about 11 years old she had the most beautiful Ministry of helps that I had ever seen I was told that she had become crippled at 5 years old bedfast shortly after that she lay bad fast and pray day and night for the Saints and she was going home in the condition that she had died with I said why isn't she straightened up the spirit said this is her testimony for now in heaven she's going to walk around but her testimony for now is to be is to be reminded to remind that her life was not a normal life it was a sacrificial life he said I heard him ask the little girl did you learn to love and she said oh yes Lord for she couldn't have lied she can't you can't lie there it wasn't her lips speaking it was her conscience her spirit man then he reached down and embraced her and kissed her and in she went and it was like one of the greatest testimonies that will be there then in front of me was a woman who had died at 93 her fingers were nothing but huge knots arthritis had so attacked her body and hands for I would say 50 years she had lived in great pain from arthritis and then I heard the Lord ask her did you learn to love I want you to listen to her answer Only You Lord did you learn to love Only You Lord remember he told us in this experience you couldn't lie Only You Lord as you know I lost my husband when I was young and I let it make me bitter I stayed in the church but I never really did anything but bite people because of my bitterness but she wasn't in love and he told her you're saved by grace but in heaven there will be no rewards you'll be the least in the Kingdom of Heaven because you didn't learn to love so in she went and I was next Bob said I was thinking Lord I did get saved I learned to love I was doing what I was doing because I love I was obeying you because I loved I'm ready for my kiss he said I'm all puckered up ready for my kiss and I won't have to ever go through that pain again I'll never have a bummer day again this is the greatest day of my life I'm thinking as I drew close to him he looked at me with eyes which looked right through me he said you talk about a spooky feeling man he he looked me all over he could just look and instantly he xray everything in me I'm telling you that was frightening when the eye of God is on you and I don't hear many people talking about it but he said man it terrorized me he said I saw this beautiful man in white he was white light the only thing that weren't white were his two beautiful eyes they look like Wells with water and light at the bottom shining in a depth you could not see you couldn't fa the depth of his eyes and they looked right through me you couldn't hide anything from him so then he put out his left hand and he said Satan has killed you before your time I want you to go back because you were doing what I told you to do and I'm thinking your thoughts are really words there because your mouth isn't speaking it's only your spirit speaking and he said yeah Bonnie asked him you mean it it was your conscious speaking yes I was my lips weren't moving he said but this word these words were coming out of me I've not accomplished anything I'm really failing and he said Jesus looked right at him and said you're a liar now I wasn't there just telling you what he said because you brought my words and my words will accomplish the things that I have sent them to to do you did obey me in bringing them well I didn't do very well on that one and I said but it's so painful down there I'm continually under persecution and he said yeah your old nature was cowardly that's the coward in you but I will bring you in if you'll look at this line over here and turn your face back to me for I want you to go back so I turned my eyes toward the line and it was the most pitiful horrible thing I'd ever seen and I turned back to him and I said Lord when I was saved in the Baptist Church I had a love for souls he said I would go back for one soul I would go back down and bear my cross for one Soul he said I'm not sending you back to Die For One Soul I'm sending you back to prepare the people for the last Harvest he goes on to talk to him about the youth that are coming in in the last days I want you to tell them about heaven and hell I want you to wake them up when you were a Baptist your main heart was leading someone to me now I want you to go back and reveal me to leaders I said okay then I got my kiss and the next thing you know I'm back in the room and the doctors were staring staring down at me now I don't know whether that experience says anything to you or does anything for you I know it's strange I know it's odd but I felt like if I was going to tell you what was said the best thing I would do and the right thing to do would be to tell you the experience I can't imagine that little woman with her knotted up hands standing in the presence of the Lord and realizing I was only able to love you Lord but I wasn't able to love your people she went in because she loved him but she had no reward does that disturb anybody she had no reward other than eternal life because she would spend her time on Earth biting the people in the church Church does anybody know what I'm talking about yes it's verse 20 if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen in the message do you now believe if you'll come with me for just a few moments brother brandom said now I'd like to tell you what my secret of the greatest how you like me to tell you tonight what I think is the greatest most powerful force there is on Earth would you like me to tell you about it in a few minutes you might not love me so well after this I'll just tell you all the mightiest Force there is on Earth is love he said that's exactly there's nothing that will break love down no matter what it is whatever you are or what you might have sung sang you might have danced in the spirit you might have spoke with tongues you might have shook the Elder's hand you might have been baptized three times This Way backwards face forward any way you want to but until love hear this church but until love anchors in your heart you read it you're still out of God somebody said where is that in the scripture I just read it to you in 1 John chapter 4 if you're not in love if you can't love the Brethren he said then God is not in you and of course if God is not in you you are not in God come on now and it's easy to love our favorites it's easy to love those who do like we do or do like we like for folks to do it's a little more challenging to love that's why I believe he was asked in the vision did you learn to love love is not something that you can just pull out of your heart it's not something like a magic trick you can pull out of a hat God is the author of love the only way to overcome not loving one another is to draw closer to the Lord he is love amen the closer we get to God the more we'll love him the more we'll appreciate his love for us and the more we will learn to love one another the popular and the unpopular those in our click and not in our click those we get along good with and like to relax with and those we don't like to relax with we've got to love them anyhow and it's not loving them in word that God is interested in when we learn to love one another it's not by word only it's by deed it's by Behavior are you with me you're going to stay surefooted then he said you're going to have to learn to love in the message oh did he go on excuse me the strongest force is there more to that one or is that the end of that that's the end of that one in the kinsman redeemer he goes on to say hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end brother Shaw sent me a note right before the service that was sent out by the Mogi County Police Department the Columbus Police Department letting people know that they had intelligence information given to them that today was going to be a national day of hate that was going to be sponsored by by th those groups that are anti-semitic and that they were going to be particularly stationing extra police around synagogues over the weekend because even though uh the Sabbath is passed Sunday is is a day in America among Jews of going back to the synagogue for Fellowship for meals uh for committee meetings and all the things that they do that you and I might would do on the first day of the week they go back and so can you imagine a national day of hate and it's done because hatred had a beginning but thanks be to God if it had a beginning guess what it's going to have no end brother brandom said love had no beginning so it has no end because love was a part of the great light that's what he means love was a part of that great Fountain of Light that would create something to worship and when something to worship first the Fountain of Light the logos went out of that and then creation followed and then that which was created turned around to begin to worship that logos to worship the god that stepped out of that great light hatred he said hatred is forever that means it has an end love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end see it is eternal how many of you understand that in the song of songs I want you to go there with me for just a few moments Song of Songs chapter 8 verse 5-7 Aaron would you come and get the microphone for brother Shelly and give it to Ellas please I'm straining a little bit now and let him read these verses to us Song of Songs chapter 8 verses 5-7 did you turn it on son may have not turned it on who is this that come who is this it's a question who is this that cometh up from the Wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raised thee Up Under The Apple Tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee now listen this could this could only be go back oh there it is this could only be bride speaking back to bridegroom bridegroom says who is this that cometh up from the Wilderness leaning upon her beloved bridegroom says I raised thee Up Under The Apple Tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee bridegroom to bride now let's go on set me as a seal set me position me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death for love is strong as death I want to make sure you understand that it is my belief that this is bridegroom room speaking to bride now I say that because you may have footnotes in your Bible not scripture verse but you may have footnotes in your Bible to the contrary and that is because the Song of Solomon is one of the most confusing books of the Bible to the minds to the theologians to those who study the word and they argue all the time if you ever look into it they argue over the time all the time who's talking and some believe that it's not possible to have bridegroom and bride talking in the same paragraph of course it is we don't always speak in paragraphs and who made these paragraphs the writers of the Bible didn't make these paragraphs the Catholics with the influence of King James on that's who made Major Prophets and Minor Prophets The Bible doesn't call the difference between major and minor the Catholic system did come on now if you really understand the politics of the 1600s you will understand that even in our beloved King James Bible is the great also there is the Great influence of the Catholic church because through the years she kept getting her hands in it as often as she could there are many people that believe in order to have a more accurate translation of scripture you'd have to go back to original from the 1500s and there you might have even a more I'm not concerned about the accuracy of the King James version I believe it's accurate but in our present day bible we have the influence of those who decided paragraphs verse numbers major minor footnotes did you know there's people that preach out of the footnotes like it's thus sayeth the Lord wow if you were to read the footnotes of a scoffield Bible you would find out that Scofield believe that Mark 16 was not inspired so scoffield would have been a better believer in a modern-day Message Church than brother brandom because we still have scof Fields Among Us scoffield was a Baptist Theologian and he was flat out wrong about multiple things and when we have allowed because brother brandham preached out of a scoffield Bible doesn't mean that brother brandham was in alignment with everything scoffield taught although we do find brother brandom reading the Mysteries and adding a few of them to the list of the scoffield Bible just because he mentioned I have a scoffield Bible doesn't mean he believed that Mark 16 wasn't inspired I want you to know he believed it was expire inspired not expired they all believe it's expired he believed it was inspired they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall speak with new tongue and Scofield sing oh oh oh oh this will tear up my Baptist Church come on I can't let them think that there's going to be signs and wonders in the modern church but I'm telling you what if the if the presence of God and the workings of the spirit are not there I heard brother brandom say yesterday it's not a church he said it's just a lodge I want more than a lodge I could have joined the odd fellas if I wanted a lodge but I want to be a part of a family of God that believes that he's the same yesterday today and forever so I'm not going to argue with the theologians because I found just as many who believe that this is bride speaking to bridegroom I found just as many who believe this is bridegroom speaking to bride I don't believe the bride is telling the Lord to put a seal on his heart and this was written as an allegory it's written as a prophetic story concerning not just the love of of Solomon and the shunamite woman but also our love for the bridegroom and the bridegroom's love for us you understand that so set me as a seal upon thine heart in my in my understanding it's more likely the bridegroom saying to the bride set me as a seal upon thine heart and a seal upon thine arm the seal is the symbol of authority and having it on an outward position and not just an inward position it means that the bridegroom is saying whatever you do don't forget that I have sealed my love for you with a covenant and that Covenant in that Covenant is where our love is found and in that Covenant is where Authority is found in the seal I say that to the modern Church who has taken that to mean something as silly as a tattoo I don't believe the bridegroom and there are theologians who say the the modern way of expressing this would be to have a tattoo no so you've got the this hippie Church rushing out to get a tattoo of a heart on their arm so they don't ever forget his love let me tell you something if he's writing anything he's writing it on your heart but he's telling you keep a reminder make a reminder for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grace sorry I forgot you're supposed to be reading set me as a seal read it set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death can you imagine love is as strong it is as sure as death jealousy read it jealousy is cruel as a grave does anybody know that let me see your hand if you know that jealousy is cruel oh my goodness what a Taskmaster jealousy desires to be in our life it wants to keep us on the Geral wheel of performance it wants to keep us constantly comparing ourselves to others and other people's lives to Our Lives why don't this little bride make up our mind we're coming down off the gerbal wheel of performance we're not going to try to compare our life with someone else our family with someone else's family we're going to try to fall so in love with our bride groom that he matters more than possessions he matters more than fancy trips he's everything read on brother the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehemo flame he's talking about love love like coals of fire passionate Burning Love the kind of love that a husband has for his wife a wife for her husband in the beginning it often Fades because we take it to be something sexual perhaps the necessity of that doesn't leave us but the importance and the priority of that certainly shift in life I'm going to say it the more mature you get that you're not ripping one another's clothes off so to speak do you understand sir but of course we want to have a passionate love for one another to hold a marriage to hold a family together the bridegroom here is using this kind of a love let it be like a burning in your heart not heartburn the world likes to call it butterflies it felt more like like bumblebees or something in mine butterfly is too delicate that burning love that you have for your companion the one that God has chosen for you but this is this is greater than that this is greater than that love this is a love and a passion for Christ that when we tell him we love him we mean it with every it's so easy listen to me folks please it's so easy to be religious and to say I love the Lord yes and it's just words what does that look like if you really love the Lord what does that look like well I want I want to give you one example he means more to you than your buddies he means more to you than your hobbies he means more to you than your [Music] habits loving the Lord is about priorities it's about placing things in the right bes Setter in the right order yes sir and our priorities are right sir it's one of the reasons why fasting can be so effective is because it reminds us that the Lord is more important than the meal knowing that he hears you knowing that he sees you knowing that he's mindful of you knowing that he looks at you and recognizes your love for him becomes more important most of the funnest times I know that's not a word most of the funnest times of our life seem to surround fellowship and food and the Lord wants us to eat and enjoy the fruit of our labor as a gift of God and he wants us to have fellowship with one with one one another but what he wants more than anything else is to have fellowship with you and I as individuals and he wants us to come to the place where we become as addicted to that experience to that moment of fellowship and intimacy with him more addicted it becomes more of a necessity to get along with him it becomes more of a necessity to hear his voice than to even hear your wife's Voice or your husband's Voice or your pastor's voice to long to hear the voice of the bridegroom do whatever you have to do that's Godly and moral to set a seal upon your heart and upon your arm so that you don't ever forget his love for you and that love is strong as death and that jealousy is cruel as a gravee and I want you to know the Bible tells us that our God can be a jealous God God and His jealousy is toward us there is no other God for him to be jealous of if he's a jealous God he's jealous of our time he's jealous of our dedication to other things he's jealous because we let so many things separate us from God and from God's house right anybody here read on brother many Waters cannot quench love you can't wash it out neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned it means if he should give everything and gain love everything he gives would be nothing it would be like the Apostle said I count it all but dung it's all void it's all waste it's all without value the only thing that matters now is that I may gain Christ that I may win Christ that I may have his effect ction that I may have his attention that I may have his love let me tell you something your point of view you'll fight all day you'll argue to the midnight hour because of your opinion you'll fight for your right you'll fight for your voice you'll fight for your opinion we ought to be that passionate to fight for for our place with him that means sometime setting something else aside and say Lord I'm all in I'm not playing around this time we have some brethren here over the past few weeks who have been setting aside that unto the Lord they've not been able to lock themselves in a cabin every day along with God because they're working to provide for their families what if somebody said the only way I can get close to the Lord is quit my job that's foolishness that's foolishness a man that won't work and provide for his own is worse than an Infidel he's already denied the faith be nice if you could have some vacation be nice if you could I told these Brethren that be nice if you could but if you can't then you steal the time you take the time you can in and may God strengthen you and I've watched it I tell you I don't want to say too much because you can lose your reward you can lose the benefit of your sacrifice by talking about it too much but I would say to anyone here if you're going to enter into to a prolonged time of fasting you need to tell a spiritual leader or a spiritual person in your life who can cover you in prayer because not only do you draw closer to the Lord you become more sensitive we've seen what the enemy can do when people are in a vulnerable place that's right we're not talking about being angry sir we're talking about being weak and how the enemy can lie he like to deceive somebody who's seeking the Lord he he's Limited at what he can do but he would like to do something that's right to hinder and so you want to know that you've got a prayer covering that someone is crying out to God on your behalf and I can tell you and others can testify a later time if they so would so desire that God is a supernatural God and when someone really says I've had enough I'm desperate I've got to let him know that I want him more than anything else and I'm sick of me yes I'm sick of my bad choices I'm sick of my addictions I'm sick of my apathy and when someone sets their heart to do like that I'm I'm I'm amazed at how God supernaturally will St I had someone tell me this week I I I almost expected that I would come to the place that I could no longer work because as you work as you labor you you you exert energy which is calories if you're not taking in calor calories you don't have a lot of energy you're really depending on the Lord now let me say this there must be a balance in all things and I've always told people if you're going to fast for an extended amount of time you need to know that the Lord is calling you that he's calling you because you're going to want his help you're going to need his help and you want to know that you've got covering because there's so many things that the enemy likes to do as I said a moment ago in vulnerable times like this someone said to me this week because I was that part of the prayer covering for that individual and I know there were family members also praying but it said to me I I I really sort of expected my maybe even possibly it would come but it did not come and I stand amazed and even though I'm sort of scheduled to come to an end I don't know at this moment hopefully a decision is made now but I don't know at this moment if if I'm going to end or not because I can see how God has strengthened me through this time let me tell you something he's jealous over you I hope you hear me he's jealous over you he loves you so much he may not wear you on his arm but the Bible said he written you in his hand he couldn't forget you it's like he said about Jerusalem basically I couldn't forget her if I wanted to I love her too much when you've disappointed him he might would have won wanted when I've disappointed him he might would have wanted to forgive forget us but instead he just forgives us again because he loves us so much read it again there finish it up for me read the seventh verse the last time many Waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned Bible tells us to let a man love God with all of his heart with all of his strength with all of his might it's the greatest commandment can someone tell me the second greatest commandment to love your neighbor as yourself you can't do that apart from a relationship you can have kindness toward your neighbor that's not what the Bible's telling us this is love them and love their soul as much as you would love the soul of your own children that is not possible in the natural it is only possible as a spiritual birth we're birthed into something and before we close I want to go to Matthew chapter 24 and I want to tell you where we are we're living in this day and then you you read this read this verse for me would you and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another aren't we there sir sir aren't we in that hour yes sir we're seeing Prime examples can you imagine overwhelming someone's safe place the their neighborhood where they live where they work where they Fellowship where they have settled to raise their children and you rush in they have never offended you they have never wronged you they've never stolen from you they've never harmed you in any way and yet you Poss possess listen to me you possess such a hatred for those people that you've never laid eyes on that you've never even seen that you would invade their world on a on a on a Saturday morning on their religious day unfortunately so many of them secular but you would invade their home the safety of their home the sanctity of their home and you would line them up in a huddle dragging children away from their parents look you don't have to take the media's word you don't have to take my word you can see the videos for yourself be glad to forward you some I can't imagine the fear in their heart I can certainly see it in their eyes as a dad is drug away from his wife and children huddling there on a on a bench in their home they dragged the dad out and shoot him they dragged the young teenage boy out and shoot him they had more Mercy for that family than they did for other families because some of them were found in their homes hugging one another can you imagine huddling around your children and holding on to them a and closing your eyes and gritting your teeth and waiting on the bullet that's what we've just experiened erience in our in our world just a few months ago and yet in America today is going to be a day of hate not for those who perpetrated such evil but for the relatives of those who were murdered we hate them so that we're going to march in the street they shut down the square around Big B and and marched on the bridge and stopped the traffic on the bridge in London to to show their hatred that's the world that we're living in today and we must not be a part of a society that's offended by everything that happens we were in the parking lot yesterday and two African-American men were walking down the center of a busy parking lot they were very much aware that we were behind them because you could see them glancing behind their shoulder to see I want you to know this one was one of the biggest he was so big his shoulders were broad his legs were so thick they couldn't straighten out and he was walking bowlegged so large so slow instead of moving over it wasn't his weight he was beefy he wasn't just fat it wasn't his handicapped it was his attitude that sent him right down the center not to the side why would you even mention that because I'm the one my family can tell you I'm the one who always says to my family move out of the way somebody's trying to get by it makes me so nervous to think that I'm holding someone else up I don't look to see what color they are I don't want to hold anybody up they may have more time than I do but I'm just conscious and polite enough to say I don't want nobody wait on us and you know how you can get to talking sometime and you get further and fur closer and closer to hindering somebody from going by let's stand over here I don't know how many times I've said to my family let's stand over here and talk so we're not hindering anybody and they don't even have to slow down afraid but the attitude on that young man as he walks down that aisle and when we begin to go around him he hears the acceleration because we've been going so slow it wasn't a revving of the motor it was the motor kicking in that he heard and he turns around both of them and looks at us with such hatred and I said to my family I know people think I'm crazy I wish that I could go up to him I wish that I could go up to him in the store and say you don't have any idea who we are we wish you absolutely no harm the color of your skin is not offensive to us your attitude is what Grieves my heart oh how I would like to say to you that everybody hasn't everybody doesn't hate you it must be awful to grow up taught come on now oh yes they see it they see displays of hatred and that breaks my heart but a society that surrounds them that causes them to believe that everybody the enemies told you lies that have nothing to do with your R everybody hates you nobody likes you it's a lie somebody somewhere likes you you may have to go out of this room to find them somebody likes you I would like to I said to my I wish I could just pour out my heart and tell you don't understand that by doing this you're not bringing a people together you're pushing races farther apart you're not healing anything if you and I I I mean honestly if if it's a good thing that I don't do what I everything I think of it it makes you want to jump out and walk along with them and show them and whoever it's the same way with the Jews and the Arabs it's the same way with mexic me an and whites and Mexicans and blacks a Prejudice and an offense I've not done anything to that young man or those two young men they've not particularly done anything to me until they decide you're white and you're going to wait on me and that doesn't it does it does flare you but it breaks my heart it breaks my heart because if somebody doesn't do something their little children that are spread out among women all over town their little children are going to grow up and they're going to think that every person that's white hates them and they don't stand a chance in life that breaks my heart I can't stand that thought and vice versa and however it works and if I've not said it right and I've offended Somebody by the way I've tried to say it I apologize for that but but what I'm really trying to say is we've got to make a difference we can't change it all but we've got to refuse somehow to not be a part of the Prejudice we've got to choose not to be offended at everything that goes on we've got to choose not to have our feelings hurt and be mad about everything that goes on around us so that we would even betray one another this is Jesus talking red letter many shall be offended and betray one another and shall hate one another can you imagine the the police saying we're going to watch the synagogues because of this day of hatred in our nation it's for the Jews it's more than a day it's every day and I have to say for the for the African-Americans also in many situations it's more than a day it has become a Perpetual uh thing and that's why I say if I could if I could speak to them I and and and they would see my heart and not not take offense I would I would like to show somebody how perhaps you can be a a part of solving the problem instead of continuing it to be worse and worse and betraying one another hating one another read the next verse and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many that's how we know we're living in the last days that's right that's how we know we're living in the last days the entire prophetic movement the Pentecostal uh prophetic movement the charismatic prophetic movement and all of their prophecies Trump will not lose within 30 days he'll be overturned and Biden will be put out of the White House and Trump will take his place and I could go on and on and on and on because I I was s they were sent to me many times in fact some of you sent them to me and and if something should happen that he should ever be elected again that is no Vindication on for those who said he Biden wouldn't be in office a year these prophets can't take any Vindication in any of those things but we are learning that we're in the last days everybody's offended about something everybody's willing to betray everybody else and false prophets are rising to deceive many read the next verse and because iniquity shall abound and because iniquity shall abound iniquity is generational sin iniquity is not just hitting the uh aiming at the Mark and missing the mark that that's the generalized word in the Greek for sin to to aim at the Mark and to miss the mark iniquity is more than just a sin iniquity is generational sin it's inbred sin it's something so deep in a society that without God there is no hope aren't we in that hour because iniquity shall abound the Bible talks about an hour where men will kill you and think they've done God to Ser are you with me they'll kill you and think they've done God of service that's the hour we're living in finish it for me would you brother the love of many shall wax cold and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold that's where we are in this Society and that's where we are in this hour and unfortunately the end time church is also dealing with the stronghold of love that has grown cold yes I want to talk to you just a moment before we leave here I want you to understand that we can expect love to be cold where truth is not present because truth is love and love is truth and where truth is there has to be a genuine love to go with that truth but we can expect that because generational iniquity goes uncalled out undal with un prayed for un preached about on that in those kinds of environment we can expect for sure that love would grow cold but not where there's truth and yet even around this end time message love has become cold yes we know that we're living in the end time and now we also know that the influence of modern society has not only affected the modern church but it's also affected the true followers of Jesus Christ and it should grieve our hearts today and tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day in fact we should make it a matter of Prayer in fact we should call it out to the Lord in fact we should call out ourselves out before the Lord we should say father you search me now you let me know Lord is my love cold if my listen folks if our love is cold toward him I guarantee you I promise you our love toward one another's Frozen that's right or gone it's either Frozen or absent right it's only in a heartfelt passionate relationship with God seeing our need for relationship with God that's the only atmosphere it's the only environment that can keep our love in the incubator and keep it from growing cold in the church age book brother brandom says something this is taken from one of the messages and I I want to use it because of that he said I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the leodan or last age selflove this is the problem this is the root of homosexuality this is the root of all forms of sexual perversion this is the root of anger it is the root of jealousy it is the root of bitterness it's the spirit of the age people's rights and selflove in the Le de in or last age selflove and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God he said we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit I dare say there's folks under the sound of my voice right now that your love for the Brethren is frozen and you've not yet even realize how Frozen it is because cuz around the altar at the end of the service you hug a neck you shake a hand and you leave perhaps feeling like you've loved somebody you don't so quickly forget those you love you don't hug somebody on Sunday and never think about them again till Tuesday night how many of you have ever loved the very nature of of human love is you don't forget your children you don't forget your husband you don't forget your wife perhaps you stand on guard for them in the spirit all the time so how can it be that we only think about church folk when we see them on Sunday or we see them on Tuesday we must be carrying one another in our heart I need some help I'm certainly not going to stop until I get some we need to be carrying one another in our heart if you do God bless you and strengthen you if you're really one of those who says I'm praying for you and you really are God bless you but I think many of us have become comfortable lying because we may tell someone we're praying we may send praying hands but because our love is so Frozen many times we feel like well I went through some hard things and I got up I picked myself up and I made it through so they can too and you're not wrong what causes some people to lose sleep never never even bothers other people you think of someone asking for prayer for a journey of 4 hours and you say to yourself I drive drive 12 hours and I don't ask anybody to pray for me you might ought to somebody ask for prayer like that and and the thought come to your mind well I'm not going I'm not praying over a just get in the car and be careful and the angels are going with you amen come on I've I've driven many times like that and I didn't tell anybody and nobody was fasting for me and oh no no no no don't you let that get in your heart don't let your love for somebody be frozen if somebody cares enough to ask you to pray for them brother sister that's why I meant I was going to get my prayer request in I couldn't help it I had to go to privy but those people cared enough they wanted you to know that they had a need they wanted you to ask the Lord to help them on their behalf and let me tell you something we can't be so callous or our love so Frozen on that we don't take the time to call somebody's need before the Lord I've had to say to the Lord yes Lord they're aggravating yes Lord they need sometime a good kick there you go in the rump yes Lord but they've got a need and I want you to move for them they may add aggravate me but I love them and I want you to help them I think about all the people out there that don't see their need for help and neither do they find a source if they saw that they had a need for help they'd rather look to the government than to look to God if there's anybody in this house and you're depending on the government to take care of you as things get tougher I'm telling you right now you better have a plan B if someone is depending on Social Security and Medicaid for their future you better go ahead and turn your life over to the Lord and understand that you can't depend on the government for your future you're going to have to have the help of the Lord and remember what he said I've seen the right I am an old man but I've never seen the righteous forsaken I don't have any buckets in you may make fun of people that have buckets but you may wish you had a bucket one day with something dry to pour a little water on and eat because we can't depend on Republican government or de democratic government or middle of the road independent government to take care of us we're in the hands of God we're in the hands of the Lord come on now you can't even depend on the insurance companies in this hour they'll let you down too they'll show you some fine print somewhere you're going to have to put yourself in the hands of the Lord we've got to guard against the power of sin in these last days we've got to learn to love one another let me tell you something having eternal life is not all I want I want more than just an eternity in peace yes I want to know that I've pleased the Lord amen and I'm going to tell you folks we're not pleasing the Lord we can't please the Lord if we're not loving the body not just in word I tell you I think one of the best things you can do if you love somebody is to pray for them right you can rest assured that if you've asked me to pray for you I may forget to sing sister Beverly a song but I promise you I haven't forgot to pray for you because I learned many years ago you may not need a list now I need a list for everything you may not need a list for everything but you need a list for prayer you need to write down who you're to be praying for and if you can remember their need write that need down on that piece of paper and if you get to a place where you can't pray you get to a place where you can't be faithful to your promise you hold that paper up to the Lord I've been so sick that I felt like I needed prayer more than anybody on the list and I wasn't able to go down that list like I do every day and call every name I've been there a few days where I wasn't able to do that but you know what I can do I can hold those list up before the Lord I've got them I have one master list and I have many other lists and I hold those up before the Lord Lord when I'm not able to do more and say oh Father I'm waving these before you because they may just look like little needs to me but they're big needs to the ones who ask we need you to move folks let's don't let our love become Frozen for one another let's don't wish to see something I I I I know that we earn father's discipline I know sometimes it's the only thing that can change us is a spanking in Papa's Woodshed but when you really love the Brethren you'll cry out to God on their behalf to intervene and intercede even when you think the best solution is for papa to spank them real good don't ever refrain your prayers don't ever hold your prayers back because you think somebody's way out is to get what they what they need don't you ever think and don't let me ever think that I know what some people need more than God is anybody with me I don't know it if you are or not we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days Let's uh so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love that's the key that's the key that's why praise is so important that's why standing in the atmosphere of the Lord is so important I'm going to finish I'm not stopping until I know I'm done come on now this is highly important it's time to draw n to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and love of the Brethren and God commended them for it Elias I know it's 10 after two I'm not done read questions and answers for me quite a few paragraphs there we might close I remember years ago you always hear them talk about the sawdust trails and things in the Tabernacle that didn't make it anymore not a bit more but then it was fresh God was calling his church I've seen them sob and cry and lay on the altar all night long yes I went to their houses and you could hear them when you come up just in their bed Chambers men and women crying out oh God you'd see them walk through the church and I'd see the piano start playing Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross yes and the tears flowing down there you know sniff sniff sniff sniff thank you walk into this church then walk down to another church and hear them there there's a precious Fountain oh God save my boy save my daughter she's lost Lord please right you don't find that no more what's the matter the spirit of God is withdrawed Jesus said predicted this that the love because the love of many their love would fail that because iniquity would abound the love of many would fail see see grow cold go away love is dying away and what they got into it just a form read it just a form beat the piano up and down real hard and yell glory to God hallelujah amen praise the Lord see like that it's just a form it's just a form don't fool yourself see just fooling yourself see listen brother until until we I got I go like this I'm I'm not talking about our Tabernacle I'm talking about what I find around the United States it's become just a form just kind of acting that we used to have and that travail of Soul it's just about over oh brother sister God have mercy upon us come on may God have mercy do you hear Brother brandom giving us a a a state of the church in America in 1954 I can tell you she's no better off in 2024 than she was in 1954 and we can stand here today and talk about the cold love of the denominational Church system we can talk about the cold love of somebody else's church but the reason why we're here today is not to examine what anybody else is doing right or wrong we're here to examine our own life did you did you learn to love did you learn to love big mama learned to love 300 lb one solds all of her life black-faced I've seen them kind of mamas there used to be more than one in this town there used to be one when I was a little boy who stood on the street corner in Columbus with a tambourine in her hand sister Annie a choir robe on she beat that tambourine in front of the bus stops people would walk fast asked to get by her but they didn't Heckle her it wasn't like it is now most people bowed their head when they walked by her she was big she might have been I don't think she was 300 lb but she was pretty big and she'd sang without a m only tambourine if you would have asked her why are you doing that mama she just said I got to reach one Soul just got to let somebody know that Jesus loves them amen that was kind of like this woman that Bob saw did you learn to oh Lord yes I learned to love there's a little girl crippled has every reason to let a little bitterness creep in her heart but like so many times she ought you hear of it and see it she overcame in that handicap and she learned to love and she learned to pray and she learned not to be bitter and not to compare her life to somebody else's life and she stood there in the presence lay there in the presence of the Lord about to get her legs back oh yes Lord I learned to love but here's a moment you couldn't lie you couldn't lie he said you couldn't lie whatever you do learn to love and here was an old woman in her 90s her Knuckles all twisted from arthritis she's standing there in the presence of the Lord did you learn to love Only You Lord I learned to love you you know what she was saying I Had Enough gospel preached to me that I learned to love you but my husband left me and bitterness crept into my life sometimes prayer it takes more than prayer to get that bitterness out takes more repentance I don't want you to misunderstand me but I know in my heart that one of the reasons why my mother had to go through what she went through at the end of her life is because God wanted to make sure that there was nothing in her heart he loved her enough somebody said why would you say that being out of your mind let me tell you something I know I don't think it I don't believe it I know he was talking to her I was in the room at times especially when she was in the hospital and I would stay from from nearly sun up to till till sometimes 9 and 10:00 at night and and she would lay there especially the last time when they told us she needed hospice care and she lived another six or seven eight months whatever it was there were times that she would lay there and she would she would be mumbling and and it wasn't like someone out of their mind I knew that the Lord was talking to her I knew that he loved her so much that he didn't want her to go out of here holding OD against anybody she had lived so many years with bitterness for the things that she had gone through for the rejection of my dad and how he rejected her and she had tried so hard to get that out of her heart and out of her mind but there was always an element of it that lingered and it was all right right as long as it wasn't brought up but if it was ever brought up you could see a fire come in her eyes and God knows exactly what he's doing even when we don't think he does he gave her an opportunity that she couldn't argue back and he talked to her heart and I believe with all my heart that she let go of every bit of that and I believe that when she left here there wasn't anything in her heart toward anybody body she was truly ready to inherit eternal life I would rather it be that way than for her to have stepped in and had nothing to be remembered for over in eternity it's one thing to be remembered here but you're certainly going to want to be remembered in eternity as well no Lord I I learned to love you but I I didn't learn to love other people I let bitterness control my life maybe you're here today and you realize that you've allowed the circumstances of your life to make you so selfish that you've loved yourself I could point my fingers but then I'd have to put them right back to me wouldn't I because there's been times in my own life that I realized I was looking out for me in a situation more than others and I had to repent and maybe you need to repent maybe you haven't repented yet maybe you're missing out on an opportunity I I grieve to think I'm not trying to be sentimental with you but I'm telling you life goes by so fast and you think the day is going to come you're going to feel better and you're going to build a relationship with some somebody you're going to fix a relationship with your children or with your parents or whatever it is well life is but I want to tell you something it's going by so
