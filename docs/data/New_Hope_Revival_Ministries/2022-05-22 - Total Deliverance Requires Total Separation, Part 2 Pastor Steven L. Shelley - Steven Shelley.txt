in the house of the lord isn't it we're so thankful for his goodness and mercy to all of us through the week to bring us here and to help us to be healthy and strong so that we can enter in and give god praise we want to go to the lord in prayer this morning and there is always much to pray about we want to remember brother greeley he has been suffering uh with sickness he was feeling some better yesterday but he has been having the same cold and sinus issues that a lot of people have had and it's miserable to have that at home it's even more miserable to have that away so uh and he's ministering today and in dayton and so we want god to minister through him strengthen both he and sister joyce and then as they make their way home we want them to be lifted up to the lord in prayer there are a number of prayer requests here brother robert has asked us to pray for a man by the name of alan jordan he works with brother robert he just received word that he's in the icu at piedmont had a stroke on friday we want to remember him to the lord in prayer that god will undertake sister beverly is unable to be here this morning she's still overcoming cellulitis so we're asking god to touch her and make her whole we know that he is we want to remember sister kathy and her brother and family at the loss of her dad this week that god will minister to them and he has been helping in the arrangements and in the situation it's hard to have to do things long distance but god has given her grace and favor this week and we want to thank the lord for that and uh we want to remember the rest of the service this morning that god will minister and he will move is there someone who has a need and you just want to signify it by an uplifted hand someone is on your heart or something is on your heart we want to let you know this morning that our merciful father our amazing papa saw our dear rose tebo our mamaw and he saw that she was having an awful hard time and i was there for a few minutes yesterday and she really didn't seem to uh be completely aware of everything that was going on and a little after 4 between 4 and 4 30 this morning the lord said you're mine i don't have to leave you here any longer you belong to me so you just come up when we were there yesterday uh just spontaneously before we ever announced we didn't even announce that we were going to pray i didn't even know i was going to pray but i just felt to appeal to the mercy of god and i know that the family needs talking to every family does i know that but i just said lord you suffered you paid the price you suffered enough for rose tebow she shouldn't have to suffer any longer and i'm asking you to show her mercy not too long after that she closed her eyes and brother billy said she only opened them one other time the rest of the day the afternoon and into the evening and the lord was just taking her home i didn't say it's a vision certainly wasn't a dream i was wide awake but about 5 40 this morning i had an image my mind has an eye and so does yours this was about an hour after she had crossed i checked my phone at 4 15 to see if there was any news and it was just a little bit after that actually that she passed but about an hour later i'm laying there in bed and i am just meditating on the lord my flesh feeling a little bit sad but my heart just happy just rejoicing and in my mind's eye i had a an image let's just say it that way and i saw a papa tebow in my mind's eye i saw brother sister tremaine in my mind's eye so brother skipworth in my mind's eye and brother and sister heist and they were making their way gathered together and they were making their way in a certain direction i didn't see the rest it was just my mind's eye but all the thought of a reunion like that and many others i don't mean to leave anybody out but they are gathered together hallelujah reunited sister tebo didn't much want to live after brother tebow was gone but god was gracious to her and good to her and he helped her and we thought that we would have her for years longer but god had a different plan i think that i'm happy about a lot of different things that come to my mind this morning but one is god loved her so much that he gave her a brand new place to live the last little bit does do you know how long she lived there i don't know say that again a little less than a year maybe she had a brand new home brand new furniture just given to her and she lived in that and she enjoyed it so much and i loved the look on her face when she hosted us there it was it was fancier than she'd ever known in her life and god gave her that but i want you to know it doesn't even begin to prepare uh compare excuse me it doesn't even begin to compare with what she has now and what she will have for all eternity so please remember brother billy and the family here at our church and let's remember also the rest of the family that god will comfort them and minister to them and speak to their hearts in this time and draw them really close there are no final arrangements because her passing has just happened but tentatively the the family is going this afternoon to make arrangements and it looks perhaps that her viewing would be on thursday evening uh and her funeral here at the church on friday and they'll have to give us the times and so forth but her main desire when paul passed away brother tebo was that we celebrate the presence of the lord and that we that we have church she said that's what bill would have wanted and that's what i wanted and we did we did have a time a real wonderful presence of the lord was here and let's believe that god i don't know how many will be able to gather with us but let's believe that god will come i don't know if you remember remembered or not but when the announcement came of her sickness and she was in church that first morning she said i want you to sing my theophany for me brother shelly now that don't really sound like somebody that's looking for a healing down here it looked to me like somebody that was already looking for a new body and she went around this church didn't she praising god and giving god glory hallelujah and so she would want us to celebrate but i didn't know benjamin was going to sing that song but i i think that was very appropriate i've never been this homesick before and i know there are hearts here this morning that feel that way let's stand and go to the lord in prayer r.j has a little sickness that he's fighting with a low-grade fever we want to hold him up to the lord sister nakisha reached out this morning to say that she was in a lot of pain and wanted to be remembered and sister audrey is coming home from jamaica this week and needs traveling grace to be able to make a safe trip home without any complication so we're asking god to do that many had hands that went up in this room and said i have a need well i want you to know we know the need meter we know the one who is more than able and i believe him this morning don't you let's sing have faith in god that's where our faith is our faith is not in faith our faith is in god let me hear the key faith in god can move a mighty mountain [Music] faith in god can't cause oh and faith can make a desert like a fountain faith can break the victory sing it one more time faith in god oh faith faith in god can move [Music] i believe that and faith can make a difference the victory we're going to the lord in prayer over these requests and there was one other need that i missed i didn't have time to make my notes and so i i missed this but dear sister potassi i know that some of you sister weems and and some of the rest sister elita sure you remember sister brother uh sister baggett's mom sister batasi she went home to be with the lord this morning she was really special to me she was a very precious woman that's trish uh who was here has been here to visit us that's her grandmother and she had the most beautiful stories of being with brother branham and the miracles that they saw and they had a private interview with him in jeffersonville one time that was just outstanding and these memories are in my mind today and i know there's a family that's hurting and i'm so happy for sister batasi oh my she's got peace i don't know i don't think her and sister tebo ever met but i hope they meet today i hope they meet today that would make me very happy to think such a thought let's pray father you are god sovereign you sit above it all how dare i ask why how dare it even come to my mind to question the ways of a such a god as you i trust you lord with everything knowing that you have never made a mistake you are always right on time you have never missed an appointment and everything that you do and everything that you allow is for a purpose it's a part of a sovereign plan and lord there may have been times through the years that we have been tempted to resent it but where we stand before you now lord it gives us so much comfort and so much peace to know that you are truly sitting above it all nothing touches our life but what passes through your hand and i'm thankful for that i rest in that today i take my rest in knowing lord that you're going to help us everyone to get all the way to the end of this thing and step over into eternity we pray over every request that was made today those who are sick in body those who are fighting the symptoms of colds and flus and sinus infections with your stripes every one of them is made whole it's the children's bread it's given to the royal seed of abraham to walk in wholeness today so we call on you lord to let that wholeness touch each body there are those who are weary in mind and grieving in heart come lord come with your presence wrap your loving arms around this family both natural and spiritual family whisper lord in each ear i've got this i'm in charge you'll not have to go through it alone lord we ask that in the

sister tebow would you do that this morning let's just do just a little bit of it for her that's not the song that that that the lord used to minister to her when she first came how many years ago brother billy was it that you brought your mama the first time be 31 years coming this november so it's been 30 years my goodness how do i look so good to be so old 30 years have i been pastoring over 30 years well i guess i have this church but i remember it well they came for a saturday night service but they got here late and chickened out so they came the sunday morning i had just flown in i think isn't that right i was late to the service my oh you just had to call that out because i called you out i had to mention that i was late coming from the airport you were coming from mississippi and uh the power of of media i know some of you are looking like there was no media 30 years ago but there was media 30 years ago thousands of cassette tapes went out of the church of columbus thousands not not hundreds thousands boxes full across the world and there was a precious family that was coming to visit us during those days the boulevard family they were living in mobile and the young people they were young and some of them coming up to a marrying age and uh they would come up to the service four hour drive from mobile and one of those young men dorell uh had a videotape of a service that we had had there in columbus this was this was early 90s and passed it to billy there's you you some of you know the story and they saw the video he passed it to his mom and she watched that video and in that service the lord called her he called her through that video and excuse me and they came and god ministered to her called her out minister to her brother tebo wasn't with her but god read his mail he'd been sneaking around on doing some things that he was keeping from rose but the holy ghost told on him and she went home and said there's no need to lie it's out and you know god so changed her life she was dolled up oh she was dolled up made up little short dress on like anyway don't matter what it was like a little short dress on curled up colored hair god really reached down her son-in-law paid her a an amazing compliment yesterday he said you know way back then brother shelly mom wasn't serving the lord but he said she had the the most unusual sense of right and wrong of anybody i'd ever met because she had been touched by pentecost as a child now i don't know if you know some of the suffering that she went through in her life but she saw a lot of hurt and a lot of pain she saw suicide she saw abuse she was abused herself family members she went through a lot god so graciously reached out and delivered and saved her and we were singing that that service he didn't throw the clay away and she said i'm so glad that he didn't throw me away hallelujah but he reached down to mississippi on a videotape vcr anybody know what that is anyway i'm reminiscing like an old man my precious friend sister craighead wrote this song and she was a fiery little lady i've told you that before when the holy ghost would fall she would get excited and she would kick her leg and they criticized her because they told her that wasn't ladylike and she was dressed a whole lot more uh modest than people dressed today so you didn't see anything but she'd be singing and she'd say and she'd kick her leg out while she was singing i'll never forget it all right let me hear a key one day i'm going to take a step toward my theory one day i'm gonna take another

made as many miles as brother daniel miller's made this week to be back home this morning he went all the way to after service tuesday night left early wednesday morning all the way to goshen indiana and back pulling a mobile uh why do i always say it a travel trailer do they have a better word for them now do they say rvs or something recreational vehicles or something like that that's a lot of miles to make and i know everybody i want you all to know that last night we had a geyser it looked like old faithful over there behind the church just shooting up over i i there's no way to tell you what that is like to someone who don't know how to repair when you when i see something like that i can't tell you how i feel brother robert wanted me to know what was happening i appreciated that so much he wanted me to know that somebody was dispatched and sister alfreda had reported it and we need to get it off as soon as possible because whether you believe it or not hundreds of dollars get shot up in the air like that and we had a we had a power bill one time i mean a water bill one time nearly a thousand dollars because of a big leak like that so we're asking the lord for grace and mercy but i want you to know these brothers came and and i don't i don't know who all was there because they were already moving some of them had already gone away when i got to it but i i know josh and nathan and austin and josiah was in the ditch and brother todd was in the ditch and who else helped me so i don't did i say luke did i say luke already lukyovic and and i don't know who all else but it my heart just went out to him muddy muddy and raining on them that was a blessing they said a blessing it was it was going to rain that was a good time to rain i don't know if that's true or not their mud was up to below their knee they oh my goodness i had to move my mat today to my coming in matt because it was muddy and i didn't want to see that tracked in the church and i told my wife to watch and make sure the kids didn't track it in but we can't help it brother skipworth is in heaven but he just did not like our red mud over here and uh now we've got these uh idaho people and they've never seen red dirt like that probably and they didn't see it in idaho anyway and uh but god helped these brothers and they worked so hard and they're tired they worked all week and these things just weighed on my mind and then it wouldn't hold and uh so i left her here about nine o'clock i was over here with some of the young folks and i went to leave about nine o'clock and i slipped around in front of my vehicle and i said lord you see these men these young brothers that's worked all week and how hard they've tried to please lord help us let this hold there was talk of having to go to get parts and luke said i might have it in my office and we might have time to get the home depot but this is this is already nine o'clock at night and i knew the campground needed water the folks that live here needed water and you'd need water this morning i said lord please i'm i'm just asking you please help us help these poor brothers that have worked hard and let this last i don't know if they have to do something else to it but just let it hold for now and i'm so glad it has but i wanted to say to every one of you men thank you so much i i don't take it i said please bring your receipts we want to pay for that but i don't take that for granted i don't think that they have to i don't think that they're that that in in in the natural sense of the word that they're obligated to i think that they did it because they loved god and they loved the church and they wanted to ease the burden and you did and i want to thank you all for that so much and had i hadn't seen josiah in a while and i saw him in the hole working and that blessed me i know i'm a little bit of a wreck but i'm his wreck turn in your bible if you will to the book of luke i have so much to say today and i know you probably didn't want to hear that just now but i've got so much i need to say and i know i won't get it all said oh sister terry's mom what is her last name hammond turn 86 today god bless you sister hammond if you can see this god bless you richly she was here for our meetings with brother daniel in april 86 years old what a blessing be here next weekend for for memorial day they have off work and they're coming all the way here and uh prayer requests here from different ones god bless each one of you i really need the lord today i need to give you the second half of this we preached sunday and tuesday night on total deliverance requires total separation so we started on the total separation and today we're going to start on the total deliverance how many of you are interested in that i'm interested in that i need that luke chapter 4 verse 16 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written now you all know there were no books the codex was not even in place this was a scroll our king james version speaks to us in terms of a book but it was a scroll it was the custom to read they were already this is second temple period they're already going through the torah schedule it might have looked a little different then that it looked now but they're going through it and so it was determined already what would be read on what particular sabbath you need not think it was a coincidence it was divine inspiration that had our lord there it's one of the only synagogues there's two that i know of in all of israel that have been discovered uncovered all the way to the to the foundation stones that would have been used in the second temple period so i've stood in nazareth and i've stood on those stones that this they know for sure this was the synagogue that jesus was standing in when he read this scroll the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel the good news to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised doesn't that sound a little strange don't you normally soothe someone with a bruise don't you usually maybe pray over that or put a little ointment on that or something some little essential oil or something but but jesus said to set them free amen to set at liberty them that are bruised he was talking about all of us who are bruised by life by stuff by situations and jesus came with a ministry mandate to set at liberty them that are bruised oh thank god for that to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him i'd like for you to turn before you're seated to john chapter 8. if you're a senior and you need to save your legs please just go right ahead and sit down the rest of us will stand for you john chapter 8 verse 31-36 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed that word continue in greek means to abide in my word it reminds us this is john 8 but it reminds us of the words of our lord in john 15 where he's talking about i am the vine you are the branches if you abide in me and my word abides in you this is a this is a cooperation it is a drawing of life and if we remove ourselves from the vine we remove ourselves from the source of life so jesus is saying to the jew don't trust your jewishness if you want to be my disciple you've got to abide in my word you've got to stay there you don't visit it on rare occasion but you've got to draw from it every day of your life continue in it abide in it remain steadfastly in it then are you my disciples indeed and then he goes on and ye shall know the truth mary had never known a man it's the same root this is not hearing truth and and saying i have information this is becoming intimately acquainted with truth and truth is not a doctrine brethren truth is a person jesus said i am the way i am the truth i am the life so you shall know him as a person he is truth and he the truth shall make you free those nearly inspired versions like to say set you free for this but this says make you free which is a recreation how many of you have been recreated the old nature has died and a new nature your old spirit man has been renewed it has been regenerated by the infusion of his spirit life you're no longer that old creature you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free make you free hallelujah i like it and then it goes on jesus answered them oh excuse me they answered him we be abraham's seed this is religion talking we slept with the prophet we hunted with the prophet we got a belt buckle like the prophet we have cowboy hats like the prophet and we wear boots like the prophet oh that's not enough being being familiar with the prophet is not what it takes being abraham's seed is not what it takes they said we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin what an answer and the servant of god is not in the house forever but the son abideth ever you got to know the difference church you've got to know the difference this morning between servant and son come on slave and son from slavery to sonship that's our journey do you believe that do we have another no that's it now let's let's look at 8 31 in the amplified father thank you for our time together in your word we ask you to bless us as we feast on it and lord help your servant to get out of the way and you deliver your word through me i pray beshem adonai yeshua hamashiach amen you may be seated 8 31 in the amplified said so jesus said to those jews who had believed in him if you abide in my word look at the brackets know that these are words added in the amplified to amplify the meaning of the phrase they're added by the translator hold fast i like them hold fast to my teachings and not just for information's sake only but live in accordance with them if you do that then you are not just my disciple in name only but you are truly my disciples how many of you want to truly be followers and disciples of the lord jesus christ in this hour then that must transpose into our everyday life it may it must not be our behavior on sunday and tuesday night it must be our everyday way of living abiding in the word are you with me thank you stay right there then isaiah 61 and 1. i want to go back to the scroll of the prophet isaiah i want to read the portion to you that yeshua that jesus would have been reading that day it's it's it's quite a ceremony it's really something that that that's really beautiful to look at and uh if you if you well before you do that go to go to luke 4 20. i think we stopped without reading 20 and 21. he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him they recognized him as joseph's son they knew who he was they weren't expecting that this day he would take his reading all all jews in good standing in the synagogue we're invited to come and make aliyah it's the same word we use in modern hebrew to describe going home to israel when you see pictures of jews coming home from the ukraine and they're kissing the ground we say they are making aliyah it means they're coming up to jerusalem to live it's the same word that describes a person a jew coming up to the bema because in the synagogue this this desk is called the bema and it is a place of judgment it's the same word that's used for a judgment seat it's the table that holds the scroll and those of you who don't know this is a a complete torah scroll and it has the first five books of the bible in it but there were there were there were half torah scrolls and there there were scrolls from the different prophets and on this particular day it was the book of isaias that was to be read it was not an accident it was divine providence that brought our lord to the bhima making aliyah to the torah going up to the torah standing behind the bhima and reading and never to touch it remember he never would have touched the scroll the scroll would have been unrolled for him and he would have been handed a yod which is a which is a stick very elaborate a little rod i guess is a better way of putting it and usually on the end of that rod is a silver finger and you use that to follow along well you don't go this way you're going this way you to hold your place as you're reading so here is the creator of all the universe think of it standing there behind this written record of the word and he's he's going along and it could have been anything in isaiah scroll but it happened to be the very words that prophesied his own mandated ministry oh hallelujah and he closed the book gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and listen to what he said he began to say unto them this is a no-no let me tell you he is breaking protocol he's doing something he's never done before and had probably never happened in that synagogue before he is not there for commentary he is not there for comment it is not his place to add to what has been read he's supposed to come follow along read those words and go and return to his seat and sit down but in that particular moment he could not contain himself and he prophesied and declared his own identity by saying this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now you go on to read that later and you'll find out this was a very mystifying statement they thought it was certainly out of order he had no business saying that but i want you to know no tour words had ever been spoken because here stood the person are you listening here stood the personification of the words that had just been read he could have just as easily said i am he i am the one this day this scripture fulfilled in your ears now isaiah 61 1 this is the prophecy that our lord jesus was reading and fulfilling the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me slightly different in translation he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty i want to hear you say liberty [Music] do you remember that one of the eagles that was coming to me do you remember his name was liberty and the mother was prayer the mother was carrying our prayers as we were praying on that mother eagle was carrying those prayers right to the throne while nursing her little ones and she introduced me i know it sounds strange to somebody but she introduced me to those it's very uh it's a little uncommon it happens but a brood of eagles is usually two to three but on a rare occasion four this mother had four i've had their name written down although i've never called all four of their names at one time but i feel impressed to do that the third one was liberty the fourth one was deliverance now you can check my notes i don't i know you wouldn't think that i'd make that up on the spot the fourth one was deliverance i don't think i've ever told it have i have if i did i didn't didn't remember it but the fourth eagle was deliverance and these eagles were being raised up they were being nurtured and fed by the mother and they were getting large large enough and i could tell as i would watch them growing in the spirit i could tell they were getting older and ready to fly and whether you realize it or not at election time there was a release of liberty somebody said i think it's the greatest travesty that's ever happened in our nation i tell you a lot of people don't understand what was unfolding in that hour but god is saying i have a higher concern i have a justice that's never going to be worked out on this earth until the king of kings and the prince of all kings and the prince of peace sir shalom comes and sets up his perfect order in the earth and so i am believing god to release that eagle of deliverance because i for one stand in need of total deliverance in my life and i believe it's available to us and i believe we need to contend for it don't you don't don't look don't let don't let your mind wander right now because i know i'm not the only one who needs to be free indeed free indeed right down to the very dna right down to the very cell the makeup of your cell on a cellular level i want to be deliverance i want to be deliverance i don't want to just have deliverance i want to be deliverance i want to exude deliverance and impart deliverance as i go forward to do god's will and i don't believe that's for preachers only to proclaim liberty to the captives that word is dorar it's similar to the word for word it's similar to the word for word but it's it's a word liberty it's it's from an unused root and it means freedom and it also means spontaneity of outflow now old faithful has no spontaneity of outflow o faithful has a mysterious schedule that you can set your watch by that's why she's called old faithful but this word liberty speaks of a spontaneous outflow it's talking about a flowing a free run my granny used to talk about letting a stall-fed calf out of the gate she said they pulled the little calves in the in the stall and they would feed them good things of course you know why feed them good things and they would miss their liberty they would miss their freedom to run in the pasture and she said oh when it come time to set them out of the gate to open up the gate and let them go she said literally you could watch them kick their heels up and their front heels and back hills would come together as they went jumping through almost like little lamb jumping through the pasture let out that's what liberty means it means recognizing that what has had you in bondage no longer you better hear me it no longer holds you in bondage you are now free and he whom the son sets free makes free is what free indeed that's total deliverance free indeed is total deliverance hallelujah so this word liberty it's a in fact it's it when when when uh when we hear this expression uh that jesus said in in luke 4 19 he said to preach the acceptable year of the lord it means the year of the lord's free flowing favor let me say it again it means the year that the favor of the lord will flow freely how many of you want to be under the spout huh where the favor of the lord is flowing freely [Music] this is also a word in hebrew that is used to explain the extraction of the resin of myrrh myrrh in the bible represents suffering as sister anita wrote us the song as a gift from god it's a mixture of suffering and blessing we're talking about esther's ointment we're talking about the bride's perfume who is this that i see coming out of the wilderness leaning on her beloved dress like a bride with her bridegroom her fragrance her amazing perfume is filling the air and she smells just like him and sister anita wrote that song as a mixture of suffering and blessing until we come out smelling like him the myrrh that was used in the ritual of purification and anointing for hadassah or esther in the bible it was sweet smelling ointment and also bitter bitter herb and the myrrh represents the bitterness of tears and this word liberty is the word that describes what happens when they take a notch in the shrub of the myrrh in the bark of the myrrh they take a notch and when they peel that notch out the resin the life the essential resin or gum of that tree begins to weep out and as it weeps out it's slow in beginning and it just barely begins to move down the tree but before long it is used to this pull of gravity that's working on it and it begins to spew down that tree and that is the word that's used for for shedding tears and it's the word for myrrh the word for bitterness it's the word that helps us to understand that when things are flowing freely it is the liberty of the lord it is the favor of the lord it is not god's will for you to be bound up in your praise it is not god's will for you to be clogged up in your amens somebody said what's an amen got to do with it you know what the power of an amen is you know what it means when you say amen you are accepting the blessing of the lord on shabbat when we call our children around the table to bless them we did it for many years we called our boys around laid hands on them may our father make you like manasseh like ephraim said to our girls may alba make you like rebecca and rachel and sarah of old then we would pray over the virtuous woman the mother of the house and even read the scripture about the godly man and when a blessing like that is pronounced if i should when our when our kids sing uh the blessing over the church may the lord bless you and keep you the the answer is always the same nobody ever says i don't want none of that the answer's what a man amen we're southerners so we say amen right god knows what we mean when we say amen we're saying so be it this one is mine i claim this favor i claim this promise i claim the favor of the lord i claim his healing to my brokenness i claim that he is setting the captivity of my heart free and i'm no longer a prisoner but i'm abiding in his word and by abiding in his word i am being made freedom my life is being changed and tuned and i have i've well i just might as well get this one out i wasn't going to tell this this isn't even in the notes because you've heard it so many times but i want to tell this somebody brother said i haven't maybe you have i don't know but once upon a time there was an old bear who was a part of a circus in germany and he traveled in an old old train you know that's how they traveled in those days with the circus in fact one of the most awful tragedies that ever took place in this area was a was a horrible wreck that took place i was reading it to some of you young brothers maybe zach one time because it was the anniversary of that terrible circus train and many people lost their lives and many animals lost their lives and there is a memorial downtown columbus that marks the spot where the train wrecked and where all of those people were killed that's how the train used to go and the cages were made uh like railroad cars and they had had the wheels and and you know what i mean underneath and and so this train traveled all over europe and in that in one of those cages was an old brown bear and it that that cages was 12 foot long and uh the everything about that bear took place in that little cage and so he spent all of his life from one end of that 12 foot to the other end of that 12 foot and i call that the 12 foot shuffle just back and forth and back and forth and back and forth oh people were it's not just in our era that people are cruel they were cruel back then and they liked to torment that bear and poke that bear and bring sticks and prod that bear that bear had a miserable life as it got older it get more angry about it they they even one time slipped in a uh some food to that old bear hamburger meat that had been laced with slivers of glass and that old bear ate that meat and it cut up his gums his tongue his cheeks until he walked back and forth filling up the floor of that 12-foot cage with bloody drool and walked around in that bloody drool for days until his gums healed up his whole existence was 12 foot forward and 12 foot backward and one day a wealthy man came along and he said i can't take this anymore he said that bear shouldn't have to live out the last years of his life in that kind of bondage oh hear this i've gone to church with bears like that i fellowshipped and loved people in the same condition that that old bear was in on a 12 foot shuffle 12 foot forward 12 foot backward day in and day out no freedom no liberty no deliverance just going through the grind because there are no other options or alternatives well they were building a brand new fancy zoo in heidelberg germany and uh wealthy men had done this because they were tired of seeing so they they bought the bear you'd have thought they'd got a discounted price but oh they paid a big price to ransom that bear out of his slavery they come with a big truck and and they haul that uh they hauled that big cage and everything uh way away from where they were camping and they took it all the way to heidelberg this beautiful zoo now this was not a zoo like we think of it's more like modern zoos we see around today where they build these amazing environmental enclosures where they can roam around a little freer and they they don't you know they don't cross the they can't get out well on occasion they do but they don't usually get out but it's not cages you know when i was a little boy i used to go to the atlanta zoo and and visit the famous gorilla willy bee and willie b played with a with a uh uh with an american tourist or suitcase that was that was willie b's toy and willie b was in an iron cage with bars and glass around and kids for generations my mother saw saw willie b when she was young and and i saw and my children didn't get to see willie b but they saw the memorial to this famous gorilla that's there now if you go to the atlanta zoo the gorilla display is is one of the grandest in the world and they have such success because they no longer isolate those gorillas behind iron bars and glass but they built these amazing enclosures how many of you have seen them if i ever go to the zoo that's where you usually will find me watching those gorillas i'm amazed by the family structure of gorillas and how they treat one another and how they raise their children it's amazing to watch and they enjoy their life a whole lot better than they did when willie b was little and so we understand the benefit this was an amazing display and there was a there was a jitter brook that ran right down the middle of this enclosure for bears lots of green grass to roll around in and plenty of food to eat and none of it laced with with glass nobody standing there with a stick to poke or prod but it looked like heaven to a bear freedom to a bear and so they pulled the truck out into that open area into that open field and they opened up the end of that old iron cage that that bear had lived in so long 12 foot forward 12 foot backward 12 foot forward 12 foot backward they raised up the end of that thing and they waited to see what would happen how many of you know what happened 12 foot forward twelve foot backward you dumb bear don't you know you're free don't you know that everything you've ever wanted as a bear is waiting on you just a few steps out of this cage don't you know that what you've longed for your entire life to be free to sit down when you want to sit down and get up when you want to get up and roam about roll in the grass and drink water from the stream and eat good food have fellowship with other bears you've been locked away in solitary confinement don't you see down there the hill don't you see those other bears they're ready to welcome you into their family and make you a part and your your your the end of your life will be great what did he do they said we don't understand this kind of behavior what's wrong with this bear maybe his brain has been affected so they begin to yell at the bear that was nothing to the bear he'd been yelled out every day of his life it meant nothing to him so the more they yelled and tried to rattle the cage and make noise to scare him out the more he just kept walking 12 foot forward 12 foot back or 12 foot forward 12 foot backwards and finally they said fire will do it and so they took a torch and lifted lit the rags on fire and they began to go out the end of that and they were able to prod that bear out of the cage with waving fire in his face like that and back him out of that and the truck pull that cage out of the way and they all draw back because they have no idea what this bear is going to do in his condition and they start getting over the hill there to observe what's going on how many of you know what the bear did without bars without confinement he just kept doing the same thing he'd always done 12 foot forward 12 foot backwards 12 foot forward no cage don't you understand little bride no bars no bondage he whom the son makes free is free indeed and why should we be satisfied with a 12-foot shuffle when the jubilee trumpet has sounded in our day hallelujah hallelujah freedom liberty [Applause] i can't promise you freedom in your rights in this nation but i can promise you freedom as a child of the most high god hallelujah i want you to turn to leviticus some of you know that i went across this nation with that message in the 90s i saw thousands of message people who had lived their life in another kind of slavery set free i hear from them now it seems like when i was going through so much here in my own church being a buffeted and oppressed every time i stood here god would see me he would see my my feelings he would see how low i was he would see how hard it was to come and do what i was called to do and he would let somebody from way back when reach out to me ain't god good they'd ride in they say brother shelly i was in that meeting 12 year old boy 15 year old boy just a few weeks ago a pastor reached out and said i don't know if i ever told you or not but i was just a young boy in that youth camp when you were preaching on the 12-foot shuffle and i realized that my life was that and so was everybody's around me i couldn't think of one single person i knew that was as free as you were preaching about and i was determined to be the first he said i was the first to hit the altar that night and god filled me with the holy ghost and he said i've been free ever since and pulling as many people as i can out of their cages and telling them you don't have to be bound the truth has come the trumpet has sounded it's the jubilee of jubilees we're there we're there leviticus 25. this is a message i wanted to bring last sunday and remember the spirit of the lord woke me that morning and said you can't you can't preach a total deliverance until you until you preach the prerequisite a total deliverance requires a total separation from unbelief i want it i don't want a smidge i don't want to smudge of unbelief in my life the only way i know to deal with that is stay in the word and stay in his presence stay in the word and stay in his presence stay in the word and stay in his presence i don't know any other way to deal with unbelief because it'll creep up into everybody's mind it doesn't matter what you know about death it doesn't matter what you know about god's sovereignty you lose a loved one there's still a thought that comes [Music] i want it all gone verse 8 leviticus 25 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years forty-nine years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years i'm still reading and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shall then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee anybody like how that sounds the trumpet of the jubilee the sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement this is talking about the fall feast shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land i want to read to verse 13 and ye shall hollow the 50th year not the month the year and ye shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man listen ye shall return every man unto his possession it's time to get your inheritance back anybody hear me and you shall return every man unto his family because some are indentured slaves they've been working out their solitary away from their family let's read on a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field only what the field brings forth of itself and how many of you know there's always some little remnant that comes back it's been plowed under and it lay there and the seed rots and life begins to sprout and so there's something in the field but it's not plowed and it's not cultivated and it's not nourished not fertilized and not cared for not even watered except that which god provides and on that 50th year you're only allowed to go out and take that for your food all right let's read on in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession let's go down to verse 39 through 42. i know you're tired and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be wax and poor and be sold unto thee thou shall not compel him to serve as a bond's servant but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee [Music] and then shall he depart release debt free from thee both he and his children with him both he and his children with him both he and his children with him both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondsmen this word jubilee is the yobel it means a year of remission it is related to a root word that speaks about both the ram's horn which is shafar and also the silver trumpet and for those of you that don't know these silver trumpets were a gift to me from sister nancy in jerusalem she bought them with the only inheritance that she would ever receive from the death of her father and she wanted this church to have these silver trumpets and they were made by the very same man who is hired to make the silver trumpets for the restored temple and before he finished the second trumpet that he was working on for the restored temple he made these for us and they say at the bottom holiness unto the lord zechariah 14 20 21 holiness unto the lord and they're real silver and they're valuable and they're precious to me because every time i look up there i know that silver stands for what redemption brass is judgment silver's redemption and i know that what these represent is is the is the loosing of slaves they represent loosing the land from under its oppression and loosing the people from out for under their oppression and i'm telling you it sends a message to us even today i'll put this here so that you can see it and because i touched it it'll probably tarnish and have to be clean means you're of remission it means uh connected to the ram's horn the shofar but also directly connected with the sounding of the silver trumpet it also is a word jubilee is jovel and it means liberty and it means release hallelujah you know that there was a a 50-year jubilee did you know the same word 50 there is the word that we will we will be thinking about as we come into the next week shavuot pentecost the church celebrates pentecost sunday we're coming to the 50th day of the counting of the omer and we're about to celebrate both the giving of the law on mount sinai and the giving of the holy ghost and the birth of the church on the day of pentecost penti is 50. jubilee is 50. it comes from the same word how many of you know the true pentecost has given us our jubilee the true outpouring of the holy ghost has set us free you note takers notice this there are three things that are promised in the year of jubilee and it it grieves me to tell you this did you know that those scholars who look at the old testament and who studied jewish history from the writings of the sages and the eventual writing down of the oral tradition that we now call the mishnah it was oral tradition passed down from generation to generation it was recorded so many years ago and it tells sometimes the behind the scenes of what was going on we look at those and we look at the early writings of the men who lived in the second temple period josephus and also the targums which we have talked about many times before the targums were written in aramaic and they give a very interesting explanation of what was going on in everyday life when jesus was on the earth powerful powerful study tools and when we look at all of this we we understand that israel rarely ever celebrated a 50-year jubilee how sad when i read that it grieved me why because conditions were not just right and it didn't seem to be a convenient time and somebody was afraid there wouldn't be enough food and so many of their years were spent in bondage and slavery and and so historically we know that many many many times they missed their opportunity to celebrate their freedom from slavery 50 years and so many men and women who could have died free had they lived in that jubilee free for the rest of their life died in slavery because israel did not take the initiative to declare the jubilee it's terrible isn't it something so carefully covered in the scripture did you know brother adam talks about the jubilee over and over and over and over he names sermons after it he he carries this subject he even talks about the priest who went forth blowing the trumpets sounding the alarm we'll get to that in just a minute there are three things you need to know about the jubilee year number one as in the sabbath year the land was to remain fallow nothing in it nothing planted nothing tilled nothing sown the people were not to farm the land but were to eat what grew naturally both people and the land could enjoy their year of remission or their year of release the year of jubilee are you still there secondly and more importantly every he brew slave was set free thirdly the land reverted to its original owner what a time to claim your family inheritance hard times required that land be sold family farms sold you've heard these stories even in our own land our own nation how family ranches and family land and and how some squandered away and thousands of acres of fertile land lost from family inheritances belonging to strangers but oh friend in that 50th year of jubilee all the land that had been sold to other families it had to go back to the original owner because jubilee was a divine reset do you hear what i'm saying it was god saying we're going to pull this back and this was to guarantee that no citizen would remain poor forever [Music] i like that the poverty mindset had to end because the jubilee returned the inheritance of the family it guaranteed that no one no citizen of israel would have to remain poor for the rest of their life and it guaranteed that no citizen would remain a slave forever as long as their life fell around that jubilee it didn't matter if they'd been a slave 10 years or 40 years as long as their their their term of slavery fell around that jubilee year from that moment on you remember this no matter what they were doing no matter what they were doing they'd been doing it all their lives no matter what they were doing when that trumpet sounded don't laugh that's the best i got didn't matter what they were doing when that jubilee trumpet sounded it was done they could have been hoeing in the middle of a row oh sir i'm not gonna hold your taters anymore because i'm free are you with me no no no no don't call us don't don't call the ambulance i'm all right i did not fall it vibrates sos until i tell it not to i want you to go to the message returning jubilee i i don't seem to have the real what i want to deliver this this morning so i know you're worn out already but would you just put a little prayer in this right now and just ask the lord to help me deliver this i just want to scream it that's my problem i want to scream it i can't get it out fast enough i just want to stand there and scream it i want to tell everybody here you have no excuse i want you to know all your excuses have been removed i want you to know the jubilee trumpet has sounded hallelujah the message that we were waiting on has come we don't have to keep living on a 12-foot shuffle we've just got to get our eyes off of us and get them on him the perfect lamb has been slain the prize has been paid and redemption has been secured for his bride in this hour hallelujah no more reason to be slaves no more reason to be slaves [Applause] [Music] you can drop your hoe paragraph 52 now a man in his family now a man and his family now a man and his family it gets me when i hear it it gets listen the first time when you mention this message i preached years ago drop your hoe its deliverance when i preached that message many years ago i didn't have a family i didn't have a wife i didn't have children but it got me there even then it got me even then it gripped my heart because i knew it was a promise not only for you but for your children and your children's children they don't have to live their life in bondage they don't have to serve slavery of sin there's a way out and it's not about what you do it's about what you hear it's about what you believe it's about what you receive it's about what you confess it's not about how you perform the striving of the church ages is over we're not under that striving anymore somebody said what about holiness it must be [Music] [Applause] it must be but it's not legislated it's the holy spirit of god separating his people as they separate themselves from all unbelief you recognize that to be like him you can't be like the world so you start pulling away nobody had nobody should have to measure your skirt nobody should have to tell you all of these details you should know in your heart by now the only way to be separated from unbelief is to pull yourself away from the fads and the fashion and the routine of this whole world and live a different life that means get you a wife and stay with her it means so many things that should not have to be written down in some kind of church covenant it should be written on the fleshy tables of your heart i want him i want him i want to hear him say your mind i want to hear him say well done [Applause] and because we want him and we want his favor and we want his blessing no price it's too high no price is too great to pay anybody with me the church ages produced striving but once that jubilee trumpet sounds you get out from under that that's why i find that so odd that some of our messianic friends now have this idea that beyond the church ages we go back into more restriction when the truth is beyond the church ages we're already practicing the powers of the age to come we're not looking back do you know why israel never got around to practicing too many years of jubilee because it wasn't just for natural israel hallelujah amen it was for those who would be neither jew nor greek they would be of another seed altogether another race saul together yes a new race a word come to redeem a new race that's right it's not a black race or a white race indian race or a gentile race or a jewish ray no no it's a new man it's a super race of people it's those who god had on his mind before the foundation of the world i know some of you may be streaming this and that may choke you but i just tell you if you can only have a heart to believe it if you can only have a year to hear the trumpet it'll sound in your life and if not you'll have no other choice but to go right back to the 12-foot shuffle because that's all religion can produce following the rules doing all the good stuff you're supposed to do and yet you'll just be a miserable wreck going from one end of the cage to the other end of the cage there's no liberty in that there's no freedom in that i know when the church talks about liberty i know when the church talks about being having liberty being set free i know what they mean they mean having no holiness they mean having no standard of living they mean doing just what the world dressing like the world talking like the world living like the world that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about leaving the religious struggles and striving of what the flesh it's really it's really this this ishmael thing as we spoke about it tuesday night ishmael was a product of sarah's mind and abraham's loins that made him mixed that made his origin of of a little iffy nature sarah had an idea and of course abraham being a man had no problem with it so sarah had an idea abraham had the loins and an ishmael was born and there was no problem i'm telling you abraham loved him abraham loved this boy i i caught a vision of it one time years ago when god first made this message real to me i caught a vision of it and i saw i saw abraham i saw ishmael i saw abraham's arm around ishmael as he taught him the things of the god of israel i saw him as he began to try to teach him in the way and love him i saw him share in this in this vision i saw him share a little lunch with ishmael and they took a bite out of the same piece of bread abraham took a bite of that bread and he handed that bread to ishmael and ishmael looked at him looked up at him like he was the greatest thing in all the world my daddy my papa my abba and he took a bite of the bread that abraham had handed it to to him and i said lord why are you showing me this he said i want you to know how much abraham cared for ishmael and how much ishmael cared for abraham everything was fine they grew along together and the next thing you know it's time for isaac to be announced he's born god's performed the miracle and he's brought out it's a coming out it's an announcement and in the back of the crowd is hagar the bonds woman with her son ishmael standing beside her and sarah has had a hard time through this whole process it was her idea but i want you to know just because it works in your head doesn't mean it always works in practicality you know i preached this uh years ago i found inspiration from another preacher who was preaching on a little bit and then god gave me the inspiration of a visionary experience that kind of helped me understand because there was nothing i heard that caused me to feel that it was much of a sacrifice for abraham but when i had that experience and i saw that exchange of bread i saw abraham's arm around ishmael i knew how much he loved him and now what a hard thing it was for him to have to get rid of ishmael and send him into the wilderness perhaps to die it's kind of an amazing thing when i was dramatizing that a little bit under inspiration of some things i'd heard i i brought it out like this if you remember i said you know here is sarah unpregnant she she's yet barren and she's had this idea and hagar the bonds woman is now pregnant and all of a sudden the step gets fixed if you follow me the step gets fixed here's abraham down with his hammer nail fixing the step and sarah walks by hmm you wouldn't fix it for me i don't know how many times i asked you to fix that step but you just let hagar get pregnant whose idea was it sarah it was her idea but when she had to live with it when her idea was birthed and began to walk around her home and she had to face that every day hagar's big belly it was harder all of a sudden the garden was tended in a way that hadn't been tended in a long time and sarah saw it and and she said who did that abraham said well i was doing it i wanted to make it a little easier for hagar and i built her look honey i built her this little stool here so that when she's gathering she can kind of sit on that stool and and continue to gather the specials well you never did anything like that for me well honey you understand you've never been you've never been pregnant and and and i was only doing that for because of her condition yeah that's what you said but can you imagine the tension going on in that house [Music] lots of pressure now now ishmael was born he's fallen in love with his papa abraham abraham has fallen in love with ishmael and the word of the lord comes guess who it comes from guess who it comes through sarah because as her son is being shown off little isaac is being shown off standing in the back of the crowd is hagar and little ishmael and ishmael is mocking the baby he's saying something like this to his mama look at them big monkey ears you ever seen ugly babies i've never seen jacob i don't know what they were saying but something like that the bible said mocking i don't know what he was saying maybe he was saying like sister west's daddy brother stuckey used to say like i've been forced to say on occasion when someone thrust an ugly baby in my arms and i learned from brother stucky what to say you say oh i've never seen another one like him because around here you know it's a baby oh it's a baby that won't work i've never seen another one like my goodness now the truth is we don't have any ugly babies born around here and we're blessed this man said i want you to look at that baby hagar said yeah he has a little little drone in he something's not quite right i'm afraid there's something wrong with that child and sarah sees it she may not even know what's being said but her paranoia that has been with her for nine months causes her to think and assume and make sure i'm sure there's something but really god was in this you know god was in this it might have been sarah's suggestion but it was god's idea that ishmael be drawn driven she said why don't you get rid of that woman and i want you to get rid of that boy and i want you to do it now why what drove her to that place of desperation because her mistakes had risen up to mock her miracle [Applause] you see if you don't deal with your mistake if you sweep it under the rug hope nobody ever finds out you can rest assure that about the time your miracle is born your mistakes will surface a preacher friend of mine used to say here in this pulpit from time to time he said you don't want to wait to get things right when your face is on the on the on the front page of the popular christian magazine he called the name charisma because you know this is a famous uh pentecostal charismatic magazine he said you don't want a way to deal with your sin your mistakes your mess until your picture is plastered on the front of a magazine because then it's too late to fix your junk most of us don't have to worry about our name being on the front page of any magazine but i'm telling you right now it's time to dig your mistake out from under the rug and get it made right before the lord so that it doesn't rise up about the time your miracle starts coming for to mock it to steal it to cheat you of the joy that comes when god's word is fulfilled in your heart i don't know how he did it but he stands there at the well that day i gotta i gotta get past this he stands there at the well that day pumping that whale i guess in those days they pulled up i guess they just did it probably like this he's hauling up the the rope to pull up the bucket of water and pouring it into these skins and he's preparing a little lunch and he walks with hagar and ishmael out into the wilderness and leaves them there had it not been for the angel of the lord who came and spoke to this bonds woman and told her your life will be spared and god would have let him die he not had a purpose for ishmael and do you know all these years later he still marks the promise his children still mock the promise just this week just this week just last week just the week before here comes a palestinian with a knife hidden in his clothes until he gets right up to the bus stop just this week he was going after a police of israeli police at the border and goes right in to do everything he can his full intention is to gut him but before he ever gets to strike the first blow he's on the ground he can't help himself this was part of the prophecy he's the wild seed of ishmael also claiming abraham as his father come on now and they're still mocking the miracle of israel they're still mocking the fact that god has given the land not even sometimes realizing that their very existence is the grace and benefit of god the very gift of god that they're even alive and have an opportunity to trust in the salvation that that our god offers to them and there's no reason for you to mistreat anybody because of their ethnicity and i'm not saying that i'm not encouraging that i'm i wouldn't want you to do that to anybody no one can can help where they come from but i'm just telling you this is why we have had intifada after intifada after intifada is because there's a wild seed in there they can hardly help themselves and you know had it not been had we not had abraham not helped out a little here had we not gone into this mode and you know what i love this is this is outside the subject but you know what i love when abraham makes it to the hall of faith god forgot whoa god forgot his mess yes it was all a part of god's plan he forgave it he forgave it and listen at what the new testament says about our papa abraham staggered not at the promises of god god keeps a different record than the one you keep and the one i keep is anybody still here all right now uh 52 where we did we get anywhere i don't know where we are i don't know what i'm doing now a man and his family whoo i know where we are could go back to their original inheritance leave it up there read it for me if [Music] if i could just pray more if i could just fast more if i could just hear tapes more this will make somebody good and mad you're not gonna do it anyway [Music] your flesh is not going to let you you're going to have to whoop that thing every day if you think all of a sudden you're going to live the rest of your life wanting it like you've never wanted it before i want you to know there is a process in some of this and there is a daily battle to be won but once the war is settled once you realize that your life today is not based on your behavior today or your performance today it's based on his grace and mercy and his favor that has been shown toward you [Laughter] oh if i could just get holy enough i've seen women try to get holy enough i've seen people try to get holy enough we've seen people in our nation that thought if i can just not drive in an automobile if i can just not have frilly curtains at my window then i'll be separated enough well i came up i was talking sister anna in my office this morning i won't embarrass you to mention that she asked me about her hat she said would it be all right i don't know what the protocol here is about a hat i said wear it i like hats that's nice but i said i will tell you this when i when i came through old timey holiness we would go to one church and preach and they'd preach if you didn't wear a hat if a woman didn't wear a hat her head wasn't covered she already had long hair the bible said a woman's long hair is giving her for a covering the bible says that that's not my interpretation the bible says that you just have to read it and and look at it in the original language they said if a woman don't wear a hat then her head's not covered and then we'd go over to the next church to preach revival and they'd say any woman that would wear a hat got pride well over at this church she's got pride over at that church she's uncovered naked if she don't so then i'd go preach at the other church and you know what they'd preach they'd preach if a woman doesn't burn her hair up but if she leaves it hanging down that's sensual and she's trying to attract another man besides her husband so they preach you better burn it up now i have to be honest in most cases i like to see a married woman with i i like beautiful hair dues i know i know you just you're quite a god yeah and i'm another i like flowers and plants and when brother todd comes to visit i wave at him like this [Music] but my wife will tell you if i had my way if it was really my thing you'd see beehives here today [Music] i love them old pentecostal hairdos that i grew up with i love it it was my culture and i love it feels like home but then i'd go over to another church and they'd say bunnied up shamed of it you're ashamed of it so you bundle it up and put it on top of your head don't you no long hair is a veil and you're supposed to leave it hanging down so there'd be sisters with four or five stringy hairs down their back because their age and whatever and they say this is a woman's glory i'd say not nomore i got your attention at least oh we used to worry about that it gets in us at some time and we think if i if i do that there's not many women in this church that would make the rapture that i was taught about because the one that i was taught about was that a woman if a woman didn't have on holes she was naked for years in our church we insisted in this church because it was preached so hard to me as a boy that if a woman didn't have on host she she was not properly a tired her legs were naked when i say that i can hear brother branham going down the street rayon and what was the other one chiffon chiffon what was the other one rayon chiffon rayon chiffon which is it because this wife has sent him to get some and he couldn't remember what she'd ordered we used to think that that that we had to get that right you'd be surprised if i told you i've spent quite a bit of time before the lord praying about things that simple and i must not have been the only one because in questions and answers they asked brother random about a woman shaving her legs because i also grew up in a culture where they weren't so sure about that either and by all means it's a good thing so let it be written so let it be done i'm a married man now for 25 years and that is a good thing come back holy spirit now a man in his family i wanted to bravo drive home a point i don't know why i got way out there cut all that out go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the jubilee not if they could figure out all the little it's and pieces and bits and systems and thoughts and figurings and if they can hear the jubilee don't you don't you leave this place and think that i don't believe in holiness i pastored this church for years and never wore a short sleeve shirt in the heat of the summer because i just wanted to be right i just wanted to be right imagine my surprise when i found out that i wasn't going to be judged on the fact that i bought a short sleeve shirt it's like a revelation to you some of you being raised so differently you think that's the craziest thing you've ever heard but to me it was life or death i have to know lord i have to know i have to be right i've given my whole life i have to be right i'd rather not know what time it is than to wear a watch if that would offend the holy spirit i just want it to be right then we come down to the message of the hour and this is what i hear he said if they could hear that you believe not if they could pin it right or hang it right or cap it right if they could hear it right powerful isn't it if they could hear the jubilee and the trumpet sound we're gonna have to close here in a minute and know that what it meant to them you've got to hear the jubilee you've got to recognize the trumpet sound and you've got to know what it means to you he said now if they heard the priest sound the trumpet the minister the trumpet is the gospel are you there and when they hear it and they know what it means oh lord have mercy does that mean i've got to know ever i got to know which which vial that happens under and which seal that happens under and do i have to know how the trumpets and the vials under overlap and do i have to figure all that out i want to know i'm just that kind of person i want to know all of that but the truth of the matter is that's not what it takes to be ready to get out of here you've got to recognize the trumpet that god's blowing in your ear you've got to recognize the voice that god is using to call you out of religion you've got to do something about that hole you've been holding on to he said no matter where they lost how far they went back listen oh man i gotta go i gotta i gotta hurry i gotta stop i gotta preach i gotta i don't know what i have to do he said it when they hear it and they know what it means and they know that that's their inheritance no matter where they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance we never took your name off of it come on back it's yours come on back it's yours who you and your family bring them all this wasn't just for you mom and daddy this was for your children god didn't just let you hear the trumpet sound for you he lets you hear the trumpet for your children he lets you hear the trumpet for your grandchildren all you must do is live it in front of them live it live it don't shove it down their throats live it live it live it don't condemn them don't you know beat them don't live it be so salty well i've made some messes and i'm sure you have so have i you'll never unscramble them now live it oh i wish i'd have done differently when my children were little i'm sure we all wish that we'd live it live it now live it now live it now live it now no compromise live it now amen when the word goes forth worship when it's time to worship come on live it now treat your fellow man right when you go out of here live it now be nice to the waitress live it now help somebody stranded live it now pay for somebody's chick-fil-a live it now live it now i have a friend who's probably watching this a retired corrections officer in a prison in las vegas nevada the first time he reached out to this ministry he reached out with a tithe from his retirement and he said a tithe is to be given to the work of god but i do wish you all would buy brother shelly a better air conditioner because from where i can see he sweats terribly and i said but what you don't know is we keep it very cool although this was something off on this one i noticed it last weekend today and sister anna miller's glad because she can throw out the day but this one's not putting out enough i said what you don't know brothers i got a fan blowing on me and the air is cracked cranked down and i'm still sweating i'm just working just digging ditches he retired and while he was working that job he never had any problems you know i never met him i had never met him i admired his family and knew some things about the family and the mother and grandmother but i got a big surprise in tucson this year he said as i was leaving he said a text said i forgot about it i was thinking i would come out there this year to harmony and i and i just didn't plan ahead in time and they had a little picnic one day and invited us to come at the tabernacle there and we went and brother bobby called me over and he said there's somebody here that has to ask to meet you and it was my friend that i had been communicating with and he sent me a text this weekend and he said when i was working in that life i had no problem finding somebody to witness to he said there's always somebody to talk to about the lord but he said now i find myself rather isolated i'm i'm retired and he said i just was getting feeling discouraged about it and so i prayed this day and i said lord please give me somebody to witness to and he said a scammer reached out to me on an app that i used [Laughter] that's better than cussing them out didn't it [Laughter] oh i don't want to quote this wrong i want to quote the time involved wrong you said a scammer message through an app usually wanting money of some kind and then the thought came to me that's your person there's your person so i spent over an hour messaging back and forth testifying about the lord and the importance of salvation goes to show how god can really work in mysterious ways we could never imagine i said to him that's incredible he said not sure it was effective on their end but sure made me feel better have a blessed day just live it just live it just share it just be it live the life let christ live his life through you then they know that's their inheritance no matter what they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance i can't read that you read that for me the could come hallelujah this jubilee trumpet gives us inheritance for our family we have every right to claim them but you've got to hear it you've got to know it you've got to understand it you've got to recognize what it means to you otherwise it's no more than another form of religion some people look at churches like this one even they say well it's just another flavor this is another brand they don't understand the message that has been sent in our day they don't understand what the lord is doing we're not hanging all of this on a man we're not hanging all of this on brother branham we're following the lord jesus christ but i never knew him like i know him now i never heard anybody talk about him they were too busy talking about whether to wear a hat or not whether to bun it up or let it hang down whether whether whether knee-highs were as good as pantyhose i heard those i heard those discussions in the church and all of a sudden a trumpet sounds right in the middle of that and somehow god loved me enough to let me hear it and recognize it was for me it was my jubilee brother that got me off of my 12-foot shuffle the whole family could come and receive their inheritance so it is tonight that men and women here of louisiana that knows the things that we do know and have heard from our brethren different ones of our experience of years ago and find that we have walled i don't even know if brother branham realized this or not when he says this i'm not sure he could have but did you know there was one place where the jubilee did not hold a walled city if an inheritance was behind the walls of a city it was not returned in the jubilee i said why brother braham say this like that and i looked it up it tells us that in a walled city it remains it's like a it's like a government unto itself and it doesn't matter how loud the jubilee trumpet sounds if part of your inheritance is behind that wall you do not get it back it does not have to be released to you now knowing that keeping that in mind i'm nearly done for today i'm just quitting because i haven't even got to what i want to do but we're working toward it try to be here tuesday night if you can if not please stream but this is so vitally important if we can catch this with the with the understanding that what was behind the wall was protected he said if we haven't walled ourself away from it so far that we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus saith the lord is and can hear what the word of god has got to say about it now is the hour of jubilee come back to your original inheritance to a real holy ghost again not a feeling not a sensation not a clacking of the tongue or a wiggle of the hip but a real holy ghost experience he said remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing free he didn't have to buy it back he didn't have to redeem it back it just is his friend clear because the jubilee trumpet is the divine reset takes us all the way back it's a year of remission he said just get up and go that's all had to do go back if he knew the sound of the trumpet if he knew the sound of the trumpet i'm telling you right now there are people i love they're precious people that i love going to church with that i'm not sure of this morning i'm going to be honest with you this afternoon i'm not i'm not sure whether or not you have truly understood and heard and know the sound of the trumpet i can't reveal that to you or cause you didn't know it it's something the holy spirit has to make real to you but i'll tell you once you know once you do know once you understand and you know how vital and important it is to stay under that he had to know the sound of the trumpet see for they were sons of god remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go i know this is going to disappoint some people because you'd rather spend 45 minutes beating the altar go ahead i'm willing nobody's worked around the altar any more than i did in the first 10 years of 15 years of my ministry because i thought if i brought him to the altar i brought him to god i'm not against the altar but i tell you what it's become a place of bless me and the altar never was to be a place of blessing we don't even have any record that there ever was an altar bench in the new testament church but i believe in the altars but part of my pentecostal blood i believe it's a good place to gather but but we don't read about an author in the book of acts because the altar was in the temple and the altar wasn't a place to pray wasn't a place to kneel down to either was it what was it it was a place to die so if you want to come up here and lay down on that order present yourself a sacrifice unto god spiritually that's perfectly all right we need some of that we need consecration we need more dedication we need to focus and make him a priority and let jesus have preeminence in our life but i want you to know more than what you do more importantly is what you hear and only you can control what you hear i can tell you god didn't give you ears to be garbage cans and god didn't give you ears to scan the internet so that you can pull every message from every source i tell you that youtube got some folks in trouble around here and you don't see them this morning because they chose youtube as their source instead of thus saith the lord i knew when i heard that man railing that video they sent around that man railing against c.s lewis i knew in my heart the religious spirit that was on him had we given him an opportunity he would rail the same about brother branham i responded to the one that sent it and i said let me tell you something the religious devil that's on that man that very same spirit is a spirit that tries to discredit the life of a man who's laid down everything to give me the truth the same kind of i'm against everything i'm against everything i'm against everything there comes an hour where we've got to be known what we're for you can only survive so long living off of what you don't believe in eventually you've got to believe in something you've eventually got to believe in someone [Applause] remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go all this charismatic world they want to lead us through 50 stages of repentance we're repenting for how the american indians were treated and we're rep repenting for how this woman was treated we're repenting for how that one was retreat we're repenting of this we're repenting of that we're tracing our family line 15 generations to see where a mason might have been i'm not trying to be ugly i'm not trying to be critical i'm just telling you isn't that just like the enemy to send the people on a wild goose chase so they can't hear the trumpet they can't hear the trumpet they can't hear the drum and if you can't hear it you're you're still a slave if you can't hear it you're going to be hoeing if you can't hear it you're still going to be shuffling but to those who can hear it my god let me hear it my god let me hear it if he knew the sound of the trumpet but he had to know the sound of the trumpet see for they were sons of god they were sons of god they were sons of god anybody still here hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 147 second seal help me lord i'm nearly done because you're you're tired i know you're old brother ward you know he finally went to heaven he hung out over there jr steakhouse all the time if you ever went in there you'd see old brother ward he told me when i was seven years old i was always a long-winded preacher no i was probably a little older i was probably about 12 when i was preaching for him i was probably about 12 years old when i was preaching for brother ward at auburn road assembly of god i remember the first sermon i ever preached there i preached on noah i'm telling you god moved and it was all over brother ward he said brother brother stevie that's what they all call me then that's probably why i like flowers today brother stevie he said i need you to remember the mind will only comprehend what the seat will endure i guess i forgot that in the old testament when a man had been sold to slavery this is second seal 2 14 you can get these notes they'll be on the website as early as tomorrow probably i don't know could could be a little delay because rj and hawk are going out of town for a few days this week and it could be but as soon as they as soon as they can they put these quotes and scriptures on the app and on the website so all you have to do is go pull up the document and press print if your printer is set up to your phone you can print off your phone i could print them right now from my phone to the printer and you can do that too and if you don't know how there's enough there's enough techies around here to help you know how to get these if you want to read them over and over again and i do read them over and over again in the old testament when a man had been sold to slavery there come a year of jubilee every 50 years 49th year and then the year of jubilee and when a slave heard this he wanted to go free there isn't nothing that can keep him from going free he can throw down his hoe [Music] and say so long go back home the trumpet sounded that's right but if he don't want to go and he's satisfied how about you musicians coming i'm almost to the end of my tank of gas depending on several factors i don't know how long i'll be before i can afford to fill up again can i have a courtesy laugh that was kind of funny but if he don't want to go and he is satisfied with his slave master then he's taken in the temple and they take an awl you know what it all is and they press his ear when i see these women with ear bobs on that's the first thing that comes to my mind why in this world a woman would want to punch holes in her ears and everything else i told my mother the divorced woman why in this world would you want five holes in one ear one in one enough to testify that you're a servant of sin why would you need four extra there's a spirit behind it thank you for those amens but i didn't need them because i know it is the truth there's a spirit behind it here listen they would take that slave up there to the temple and lay his ear up earlobe up against the doorpost of the temple and take an oil and pierce a hole through his ear come right out of egypt like this and it's a mark and he can never go back is that right that's right it don't matter how many jubilees doesn't matter how many come to ransom him out and pay his way out once he has his ear bored through with an awl and usually they did put a ring in it and it was a symbol of being owned and when i see these people with these hoops in their nose things on their tongue breaks my heart especially when i see some of these little girls like that and my family gets so terribly embarrassed because i always try to say something about it that's what they want you to do don't you know don't you know they want to be noticed so i say things like this to a little girl down at culver's i said to her honey didn't that hurt well she said it did for a little while and it just don't hurt no more i just said i can't imagine wanting to put something like that on your tongue i've even said to them before if they had them big old hoop things in their ears i've said to them are you inviting somebody to come along just take their finger right through that hoop and lead you along like a bull i always try to say it kind of funny you know like i'm an old carter that don't get it my wife is gone my kids are gone they leave me i don't even have condemnation in my voice i just want to understand why people need freakish things to feel apart my god i don't want to feel at home in this world anymore i don't want to be a part of this mess oh i want to stand out like a sore thumb i do i do i do i i'm not trying to be peculiar for the sake of being peculiar i just want to be different than the than the group around me i want i want the i want jesus to shine out of my life i want to do what's right before god if he didn't want to go press his ear and put a hole in his ear and it's a mark that he could never go back is that right he has to serve this master for all time i don't care how many more times the jubilee sounds whatever happens he absolutely has sold his birthrights of being free and when a man turns down the gospel truth satan marks him where at his ear he deafens him so he can't hear the truth no more he's finished he stays with the group that he's with he stays with the group that he's with he stays with the group that he's with if he won't hear the truth i'm so thankful that for most of us that's not the first time or the second time or the third time the gospel is presented i'm so thankful for a merciful god the one that we called on yesterday when we saw sister tebow struggling i'm so thankful for that merciful god that calls us when we need to be called more than one time and we'll tell you something we're coming to the end of this thing now and we're not guaranteed to be called and called and called and called to call to call it's time to lay down it's time to lay down our lives it's time to hear truth it's time to have our ear tuned to the gospel message he said he deafens him so he can't hear the truth no more he's finished he stays with the group he's with if he won't hear the truth no you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free son tell him i started to say honey you probably don't want me to call you in front of everybody tell them what you're going to sing and let them be playing it softly let's get ready to move i want to go to jubilee year two paragraphs and we're done yeah you said that before you i probably did [Music] now in these days when these priests they take the man out there and maybe hoe it in the cornfield the master walking down whipping him with a whip i want you to i want you to see this give me this last 10 minutes if you can i want you to try to see this in your mind here's the cornfield out there and a bunch of men hoeing in the cornfield i'm pretty sure that brother miller give me this whole i think he made it i may be wrong but i'm pretty sure that brother truman miller give me this hole and i almost didn't bring it today because i didn't know if i'd sling it or not and i didn't want to break it i'm proud of it and thankful for it and it does the job it may not look like a big old fat but i'm telling you it does the job i don't chop down trees with it i know what a hose for and that's what i use it for i want you to see if you can picture your mind yourself out there in a cornfield somewhere hoeing weeds and clearing clearing them away pulling them away dragging them away and the master coming down behind you with a whip hurry up there go to hurry up with this [Music] you're taking too long and crack that whip across your back and drive you to keep hoeing and keep holding and keep holding and keep holding give me 74. but just as soon as that trumpet sounded the master standing there with a whip [Music] driving them to their job to their task just as soon as that jubilee trumpet sounded that man could throw that hole down and say i won't hold that no more if you don't quit whooping me i'm going to tie you up with that whip i do not belong to you anymore because my ear has heard the sound [Applause] my ear has heard my jubilee can't answer for anybody else i can only answer for myself my ear has heard the message that said to me go free go free go free go free quit your striving and go free except my deliverance [Music] that taskmaster that slave driver was forbidden to touch him anymore don't you lay one more finger on him why because he had heard the good news the jubilee was on the atonement was made you stand and read the last phrase for me would you please let's all stand did you choose that song sister laurel suggested it i find that prophetic because my next scripture charity could show you my next scripture psalm 32 7 8. you are my hiding place you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance sing it sing a little of it you unravel me with a melody you surround me with a song [Music] from my enemies [Music] oh i am a child of god [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] and from my mother's womb you have chosen me [Music] [Applause] glory glory glory [Music] bless the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you hear it can you hear it can you hear us [Music] for all my enemies till all my fears are gone and i'm no longer [Music] [Applause] [Music] and i'm no longer wrestling to fear oh i am a child of god hallelujah praise the lord [Music] [Music] me so [Music] [Applause] that i am a child of [Music] so god could walk right through it you drowned my fears in perfect love [Music] you rescued me so i will stand dancing that i am a child of god tell it tell it tell it i am time no longer [Music] a child of god and i'm no longer [Applause] [Music] this morning and i am surrounded [Music] by the arms of my father the word will set you [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] let liberty and deliverance go forward and we're the sons and the daughters so let us [Music] let him fly let him [Music] oh come on [Music] oh [Music] of slavery [Music] [Music] recognize your jubilee [Music] thank you jesus thank you [Music] [Music] the devil you jesus listen to god's children you split the scene right through it and you drown my fears [Music] you rescued me so i will stand dancing [Music] you rescued me so i will stand and sing that i am a child of god sing it i am a child of god come on i'm no longer a slave to fear oh i am a child of god hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] and i'm asking you lord right now to break the very band of that [Music] chosen me [Music] in the name of jesus hallelujah [Music]
