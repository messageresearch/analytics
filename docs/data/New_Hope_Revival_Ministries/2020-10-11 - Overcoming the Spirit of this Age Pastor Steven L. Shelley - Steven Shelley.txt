your hands would you one time and sing it with me for another moment here oh how great is our god sing with me how great [Music] oh isn't he great oh we'll see how great how great [Applause] our god i just want to share this with you a moment and we're going to sing a little bit more of that before we move on this morning we don't have to be in a hurry if you are here and you need to slip out at any time you can but we sure hate to see you go i'm already feeling that this morning when i woke up from about four hours of sleep i was already thinking how sad it is to have to say goodbye but i'm so thankful that there is coming an hour oh much closer than a lot of people understand where we'll be so driven together so pressed together and then taken together we're looking for that hour brother branham talked about the manifestation of perfect love and we understand that's not something we can manufacture you can't just sit down and squeeze and say oh i'm gonna i'm gonna have perfect love it's a baptism it's a birth it's a completion it's something that god will do for us on the inside of the inside brother branham was talking about our latter rain brethren and he said when i was among them there were a lot of things he didn't care for and he thought they had missed it on a lot of things but he said that was the closest it was he said it was nigh to perfect love because they really stuck together and they really stood together and he talked about when that manifestation comes it being so real that we would just lay our head on one another's shoulder and weep because it would be a little while before we'd see one another again wouldn't you like to have that not as an emotion but as a manifestation wouldn't you like to know that god is birthing that kind of perfect love in you and we believe that it's on the horizon and uh he said something that a lot of people laugh at he said why that would make you feel like you could chew one another's chewing gum you think about the carnality of that and and the thought of that brother darren i know you that oh that don't sound very appealing does it but being so one but you know if it was your wives if it was somebody if it was my wives [Music] when is your young and you do a lot of things you pick the passy up off the ground and lick it off dirt and all so it's clean for them it's not the chewing of the gum but it's that brotherly kindness it's what god really wants to do in our life real quickly i haven't said a whole lot so i think i can take a moment just a quick another quick moment here but before this camp meeting started some maybe a couple months ago the lord was dealing with this we were praying for our nation and we've been praying we haven't said a lot about it in the service but we've been praying for our nation and believing that god's perfect will will be done i know what my will is for the next few years but we realize that god has an economy and he has a plan and he has a purpose and sometimes it is to raise up a king and sometimes it's to allow the people to raise up a king but all a part of god's plan and so we were just kind of experiencing in the spirit that there were things that had not yet been established that there were some things still hanging in the balance and when we mean that we mean between the perfect and the permissive will of god god will allow you know you can sometimes get what you want and then pay a price for it because it was permitted but it wasn't perfect how many of you want the perfect will of god i want that no matter what that looks like for our nation i want the perfect will of god and the lord dealt with us that there would be some things settled in the realm of the spirit at tabernacle's time and we are finished with tabernacles and now we are at simcat torah which is the celebration the joy of god establishing his instructions for us and if we were in in a jewish house of worship today we would be dancing with the scroll and we would be celebrating what god has done and last night there was such a moving of the spirit here deep moving i didn't know what all was god was doing but i made my way back over there and i heard that internal voice of the lord and he said do not fear for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed and i know that scripture but when inspiration comes and you hear it on the inside of the inside i was able to say lord i don't know exactly what that looks like but i know that over the united states of america and the nations of the world i can declare as a part of god's little bride that the lion of the tribe of judah the precious lamb of god has prevailed hallelujah and i'm also so thankful that he has taken the book and he has loosed the seals thereof and that there is a bright body that's feasting on the living word of jesus christ he's no longer behind the lattice but he is unveiled before our eyes in the fullness of his word and i wanted to share that as my little part and could we just sing of course a couple of times through again how great is our god or whatever you have and i want you to i know you're tired and you've been standing all this time but would you worship for that few moments again with everything you have and just thank god that he's got it he has it hallelujah his plan is bigger than the republicans and it's bigger than the democrats it's bigger than politics it's bigger than denominationalism it's bigger than clicks and clans in the message god has a plan and i want to say i agree with it even though we don't always know what's coming i want to say lord jesus i agree with your plan and your purpose and your destiny for this nation and no matter what comes your little bride is going to find a place of refuge with one another press together and underneath your arm you'll never forsake your own hallelujah the splendor of a king clothed in majesty let all the earth rejoice all the earth rejoice he ramps himself in life and darkness tries to hide it trembles at his voice it trembles at his voice how great is [Music] [Music] just how great [Music] the is above names and you are worthy [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you are worthy of all praise [Music] [Music] is our god sing with me how great is [Applause] it [Music] is god sing with me how great is [Music] [Applause] is our god [Music] lord we want to acknowledge your greatness in our in our lives and in the midst of us over this week lord we just want to acknowledge that we have seen your greatness and we give you the glory and the honor for your greatness in our lives and all the praise belongs to you for you are worthy you are worthy you're worthy can you lift up a shout of praise to the worthy one the living god the lord jesus christ hallelujah all praise belongs to you lord hallelujah you may have your seat today once again we're honored to be together with god's people in the house of the lord how blessed we are to be able to gather together when you start hearing about people that couldn't have church for six months because of being locked down by their governments how blessed and privileged we have been to gather together in god's house and feel the presence of the lord with us we're going to call on uh jaya and joshua yantus to sing at this time while they're getting prepared we're going to come to you today

have been with us this week i thank you that you have spoken to us you have met us lord even in the preaching of the word you have met the needs of the people and then last night as we gathered around the front how you were working and lord i believe you continued to work through the night and we're just thankful for it oh god and as we go away from this place this afternoon we believe that you'll still be working letting the word have its way in our lives and so god as we give of our offerings today and our tithe we believe lord for its multiplication and we pray your blessing on your people

says [Music] he's coming back for you [Music] oh give him praise right now i come to tell you hallelujah the blood is sufficient [Applause] precious lord [Applause] you may be seated this morning what a joy what a real joy to know what we know it shouldn't give us any bride pride but it ought to make us feel like the most humble people on the face of the planet to know that we have deserved none of it and yet he saw way before the foundation of the world he saw your little yes he saw my tiny little yes and he said i'm going to give them a destiny hallelujah you could have been sown into any other age but you are handpicked by god to live in this last age on planet earth and you'll see the worst of what sin can produce but you will also see the best of the character of jesus christ as it rises up in an end time bride so i say i'm blessed and i say that i can sing with with with josh and with ajaya this morning i can sing of the goodness of the lord i can sing of it because it's a reality and you know even in the heart of the trial he's good he's good well i'm about to get in trouble and it's not the first time i've ever been in trouble have you ever been in trouble have you ever been in trouble with paul west [Applause] okay and and and and you sure don't want to be in trouble with sister west but she's always willing no absolutely that's him i guess that's what they wanted to hear you saying i said it can't be something i lead because i i'm my voice is gone unrehearsed we did rehearse it in the 90s [Music] a tender blade of grass so green was crushed in the footprint of the nazarene it sprang back and waved a message to a bird on the wing it said that's him in a muddy old river in the noon day sun [Music] an outcast kept crying i tell you he's the one then a voice out of heaven said i'm pleased with my son that's him [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's him [Music] the beginning and the end [Music] angry waves splashed everywhere he's asleep in the boat does he even care we're all so afraid but he just keeps lying there that's him [Music] but then he raised his hands above his head he said peace be still and the water split a wave tap the wind on the shoulder and said [Music] [Music] he's our morning star that glows the beginning [Music] one will be left and the other caught away one falls to his knees it's too late he'll say that's him [Music] declaring that time will never be anymore the trumpet will shout like never before this morning that's him hallelujah [Music] [Music] the beginning let's sing it one more time that's him don't you recognize him that's him [Music] that's him he's our morning star that blows his alpha [Music] he's alpha omega the beginning and then [Music] hallelujah there he is unveiled before us hallelujah that's him praise god [Applause] praise the lord [Applause] did they go out the back door there he is am i okay should i run hallelujah you know the musicians are the ones so blame every one of them over there i don't know which ones but they said the musicians said that we should sing so we have brother darren last night you blessed us with the word you stirred us more more how many of you could see the fire dying down and you're having to stand there and feed it to keep it going brother carey's known as the resident fire starter around here and he knows that you've got to keep putting some fuel in there to keep that thing going how many of you are glad that there's still a cry down in the inside of your life for more for more for more [Applause] so we want to just salute you and say

be bribed and that's something that god has to reveal to you no man can tell you your mama and your daddy nobody can show you who you are that comes that's something that only god can reveal to you that there's a song that i like to sing i'm i'm so overwhelmed i i just feel like crying for a while but i know i gotta preach [Laughter] my knives have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he's tramping out the vintage where the graves [Music] he has loosed the faithful lightening of his terrible swift sword his truth is my [Music] oh glory glory hallelujah oh glory glory hallelujah [Music] his truth is marching on oh glory great glory hallelujah glory [Music] oh glory [Music] his truth is marching on amen amen i don't know whether you feel the presence of the lord but i i just feel him everywhere amen amen amen give me a key of c you may be seated if you like it is so important in this last days to hear from god and i'm so thankful that we've been taught that being a christian is not just being a church goer but being a christian means that you have a real relationship with god an intimate relationship and i shall thank god for that because he's my friend he's my mother he's my brother he's my comforter he's my all in all at night i lay in bed and i began to cry [Music] and my mind is space to exactly why i can't explain with tongue or pin the spirit's growl is deep within it must be gone here in my soul cause i feel the poor [Music] and i went to [Music] [Music] he was calling me to live a higher plane there's a deep called to the deep like a great magnet drawing me it must be god hallelujah here in my soul cause i feel the pull i feel [Music] and i know his fear is moving me to give my he speaks to me [Music] lord and i agree [Music] lord please come and take control [Music] lord i hear [Music] moving me to give my [Music] lord please come take control close to thee close to the close to thee [Music] close to the [Music] journey [Music] let me walk [Music] close to the a close to the hallelujah close to me close to me [Music] [Music] let me walk [Music] oh close to thee can you stand with me yes [Music] close to thee closed captioning [Music] while i'm on [Music] this journey oh lord [Music] just let me walk close to thee can we sing that one more times close to thee let's just raise our hands unto the lord yes [Music] i'm captioning [Applause] this journey my savior save you let me let me walk closer [Music] hallelujah [Applause] we ask you turn to two passes of scripture i listened to brother shelley i appreciate him as a dear friend and brother in christ and i really just when i heard him say that about fearing not lying of the tribe of judah has prevailed i get i get excited just talk about the line of judah and his prevailing i get excited we're going to ask that you turn with us to revelations 1 17 and 18 verse then we'll ask if you turn with us to saint luke 12. praise revelations one i don't know about everybody else but i have thoroughly enjoyed myself not only that i know i'm walking away with the change god has touched me he's done something for me and i'm grateful to the lord because i am such an unworthy creature in myself my worthiness only comes by him revelations 1 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death and i don't know whether you've noticed the songs or even the songs go right with what god wants to say luke 12 please we have something that the world do not have and i believe by god's grace this message has come to bring us of hire we have uh lived in in a time where we we thought we knew all that god wanted us to know and i think i heard uh brother shelley say this the other day when i said like this when i was in the apostolic church i didn't think you could go any higher that's the same as the pentecostals you just think you can't get go any higher you got to you got the holy ghost but then we found out amen there's another step and that god doesn't stand still he keeps moving and i want to move with the pillow fire as the pillar fire move i want to move with the pillow fire saint luke 12. [Music] 32. [Music] one thing i have come to know and learn i really don't care about what people think about me i strive to have a good name but if they want to give me a bad one it still doesn't change the good one because it's not about what people think about you it's about what he thinks about you saint luke 12 32 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that you have give arms provide yourself bags with whack which wax not old a treasure in heaven that faileth not when no thief approaches neither moth corrupted for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let us pray father god we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us there are no words that can express our gratitude but i thank god you know my heart and the joy and the love that's in my heart father you gave it to me and i want to surrender back to you what you have given me bless your in a special way and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as i was saying i think the last service i'm not sure but i was kind of typing out and mentioning the holies of holies and in that message i talked about how that each segment of the or pattern of the the tabernacle had some kind of light yes the outer court which had the sunlight of course if the clouds came over or rain or cold or whatever it may be uh that typed out the the christian in that outer court and that's what we do go we go through our flesh changes things changes and if we're not careful the flesh will change with the atmosphere and then to go into the holy place we know in that area you have the seven golden candlesticks and these candlesticks must be maintained by man [Music] the first court is operated by man the second court is operated by man but in the third court which is called the holies of holies it is operated only by god and we know that by god's grace that if you're in that second coat where the seven church ages or the seven golden candlesticks are there which represents the seven church ages those lights those candle lights can be be uh put out yes sir and often time they go out because of not maintaining them keeping the build-up away off of them and so that's even how christians do we we come to a place where you know we let things hinder us in our prayer lives and our studying and things of that nature and therefore it affects us in our spirit and then you've got what we call the holies of holies and in that place there is no light until god comes but that place is the darkest of all places until god comes even in the darkness you have the cherubims you have the mercy seat you have that table or box that they stand or set on but nevertheless those things cannot help you until the light of glory comes down y'all understand what i'm saying because even in the mercy seat which was a uh uh uh uh a lid covered with with uh gold that covered the little box or the box in which the the word of god was in even all of that life wasn't there until the glory of god would come down i said all of that because i want you to understand as christians we declare that the word of god is in our hearts but oftentimes we live as christians in the outer court sometimes we live as christians in the inner court but that's not where god wants us to be and understand that all of these things in the inner outer court in the inner court can be maintained or handled by man remember amen we talk about the statue of a perfect man but even that can fall under christian science it is a human thing that we can do we can act good we can look good we can dress good and it all looks good but life is not there until the glory of god comes down you and i must understand that we're living in the last days seven church ages have gone and come and gone and now we're living in an age that's what we call an eternal age but it represents more than just to say we're in the eighth day or the eighth age or however people wants to say it something fantastic happened and god alone did it and when god came in this last day he opened the word in a way that we had never seen it before hallelujah understand amen with those it's amazing because even the prophet of god did not understand what was happening in the message sir it's the time he was going around and he was looking at the visions and the dreams and and all of the things that had been said unto him and he did not know what god was getting ready to do hallelujah understand there was a time that god spoke to him and he had to interpret and do all of these things but there's a time when god stepped into that vessel hallelujah remember he said he was caught up into the consolation and you and i must understand what that really is because a lot of people say oh well it was the virtues amen that was the thunders but listen even the ephesus had those virtues as i said the other night they had those virtues and if they were so connected with god the prophet of god said all they had to do was get a nod and they would know what to do hallelujah so is something even beyond that sir hallelujah and nobody understood you know people in the message she said well brother said don't interpret it we'll interpret itself but you got to understand brother branham has been gone since 65 and at what point in time is going to interpret itself see the world has been open y'all understand me and he said it went up like a rocket and five rockets came out of that rocket and it kept opening up and opening up and opening up and that's what god is doing now it never stops unfolding and it cannot stop unfolding until it meets its purpose [Music] hallelujah and so many of us we want to live back there you know that's why so many people are stuck [Music] have you ever seen people amen who stuck in the 60s they got the 60s hell dude the 60s closed they stuck because they failed to move on with the trend that's how it is in this message people are still stuck they're stuck back there with the prophet now many people think i'm preaching against him but that's not true because even when joshua came on the scene which represents the holy ghost god said unto joshua say to the people moses is dead but remember everything moses has said so the message i'm preaching is the same message he preached but it's unfolding to us why because this message is to produce a rapture hallelujah and we can't go backwards god is there's a ministry going on remember now i said the other day that apostasy in if you you find yourself moving in apostasy is really the truth of what we call the mark of the beast it's when you outright reject truth ain't god don't you say well did it just start no the mark of the beast has been gone alone all along we didn't know what it was until god opened up the word we're not a system we are the life of christ and the life of christ cannot be systemized he whom the son is set free it's free indeed hallelujah now i want to bring something and i trust that i could bring this thing in a way that you can see when god uh showed moses the the the diagram of uh of the temple and and you know like i said many people think uh god is in heaven sitting on the throne but there was more to that than you know god listen revelation is a book of symbols and god has to relate to us in simple form in order for us to understand what he's doing let me ask you a question jesus said if you overcome you're set with me on my father's throne as i have sat on his throne do you think jesus is sitting up on a chair it is a position it is a an authoritative position that god is giving us can you imagine how big that chair would be if if the number that could not be counted but what i'm trying to say is because this diagram was all about salvation it was about god saving mankind and he showed us amen by god's grace amen through a prophet what he's expecting of us see israel did the rituals and never came to understand what those rituals was about hallelujah and if you're not careful you'll come to the same place where you won't understand even why god had to sin a prophet he had to come because that's the only way god could relate to us he said i will do nothing except i reveal my secrets to the prophets but remember when a prophet comes it's at the end of the age there's a time when you got to turn because he's going to turn and if you don't turn you will miss the visitation of god [Music] and that's what has happened to a lot of people in the message they did not turn they stayed thinking that they would be secure is that right remember i'm just going to give you an illustration when jesus preached and he told his disciples when you see the enemies incompetent about jerusalem [Music] don't go back to your house if you're on the mountain don't come down wherever you are you feel don't come back don't come back and get your stuff y'all understand me and those who believed his word when titus came in 70 a.d they escaped the slaughter but those who had made jerusalem and idol are worshipped huh they made jerusalem holy hallelujah but let me say it this way jerusalem is not holy if the holy god is not there what makes us holy is when the holy god is there there's no such thing as holy water unless the water holy god is in the water there's no such thing as a holy man unless the holy god is in the man nothing is holy except god this is what i try to tell people i said here it was god can make dirk holy is that right that's what he did amen in moses day he said moses take off your shoes for the ground you stand on his holy ground and if god can make that dirt holy he can make this dirt holy he can make your dirt holy hallelujah we must understand he's god oh i just love that song he's been so good to me [Music] and here we go we see those seven angels coming and some people say well the seven messages of each age but no they were not i hate to disagree with you but anyway we come to a place and you know brother bam said he first saw those little angels and they looked like little birds he said then they came looking like doves he said but then the the next uh out of those three the last to come was angels hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying and those angels when they came he said have you noticed that seventh one the noticeable one why because that notice one was the one that came to open up the seven seals brother branham didn't open the seals god did it hallelujah in the form of the lamb y'all hear what i'm saying and then when those seven angels struck him and took him up into the constellation what did they do they formed the head of christ and these devils around here said it wasn't right these devils saying it wasn't of god let me tell you something when you attacked that you attacked my lord whoa i don't care how you can prove it i tried to tell people i said were you there when moses was there everything we believe must come by faith is that right moses was not there in the creation but god took him there somebody help me here see if you know a prophet when there's a real prophet he he's a time traveler huh he's a time traveler moses amen was able to see creation if you can't believe create moses you can't believe creation hallelujah i'm coming in just a minute people say well you know brother man i'm headed wrong you know uh uh uh uh enoch could uh noah could not have seen enoch because this that and the other and i said lord tell me how does that work you know what he said he said noah was a prophet noah time traveled he saw him he saw he not when he was translated he saw that now you don't have to believe it but the brother branham said he saw adam and eve he just did nothing to see adam and eve he saw a lot of people in their past oh come on somebody see it ain't the man it's god in the man you can't tie god up the church of the living god is not built upon the letter of the word the church of god is built upon revelations hallelujah and god revealed to us things amen that other people cannot even see oh but the bride of christ is ordained to see it you don't have to fear fear fear shouldn't even be in your vocabulary fear what if you got the true god and you understand what you possess hallelujah not the third person of the trinity not the second person of the trinity you've got god himself in you the very elohim call him what you want to because whatever you call him to bless his name he still is is that right he's so he saw he's got so many names he told moses when his moses said who shall i say send me he has so many names he said just tell them i am that i am hallelujah y'all understand me because every time god do something you got another name you got something you can call him to bless him hallelujah and when he changed dispensation again he'll have a new name yes sir hallelujah the lord is good to us and i'm coming to a place i'm going to say it like this you say well you said what what are you saying brother remember brother branham did not even know what the cloud was he saw the angels he saw all the figures and things in there two years later god told him to turn it right and when he turned it right he saw what he saw jesus he saw the the face of jesus christ is that right according to hoffman and that was that was the third time he'd seen him he'd seen him himself and then he saw a painting and then he saw him in the midst in a place no no no no no airplane or anything could go and do that y'all understand me we're talking about the 60s but i'm coming with that you see because in that he said we'll see him face to face and if i could say it like this if you can see his face you can see his body right because the earthly pyramid that pyramid that peter talked about he said that was an entrance i entered into what the holies of holies that was an entrance into the virtue and the divine nature of god god follow me and we climb up that machine that's the body but when the head came in 1963 people still put the pyramid up there like there's no face to it but there's a face to it somebody help me here there's a face to it and that face unites with the body that's the day we're living in and then show you who you are can i about to go crazy up here i see something that i don't think you're getting it some of us are not getting it that's why it's it's a must you've got to go into the holies of holies you can't stay out there under the church ages you can't stay there and live [Music] is that right the word of god said except you kiss the son he's going to be angry with you that means you've got to have an intimate relationship god don't kiss everybody somebody help me here you if he kisses you that means it's intimate not only that that means you have become his bride his wife hallelujah oh god help me jesus i'm trying to bring something here let me tell you something oftentimes we don't see the power of prayer hallelujah remember even jesus had to pray did he not when he was in the garden of gethsemane he saw the battle that he was getting ready to face and he went there and he prayed he wasn't afraid no shah but he went in there to surrender his will see that's what prayer does for you it makes you surrender your will hallelujah not my will lord but dying be done so what happens god dispatches an angel and the bible said an angel strengthened him now i don't know how many times y'all seen angels around him but i've seen angels and i don't say that to boast or brag but i just say they come when they want to come and they go when they want to come you can't say oh lord send me an angel no he send them you know you know i mean whenever he wants to it's a sovereign thing that god does right but one of the things i want to say before i get to really where i'm going i said all of that to say this in this message if you don't come into the holies of holies your life will always be dark you'll never understand who you are or even what you are understand me we did not come by here and come in this this place by chance you and i we have been directly elected and chosen for this age that means every one of us that have been chosen for this age to make a rapture god is dealing with you right now and you can feel the urgency something in you you can feel it that's why the message was so powerful yesterday because all of us want more he struck that word he struck that channel give me more and that's what he just surprised and saying lord i want more of you hallelujah i've heard all that eliza has said but now i want what what elijah has told me hallelujah i'm not on my way amen to some fictitious promise i'm on my way to see the manifestation of that promise and everything elijah said he was he is and a whole lot more fear you see the political realm and everything is messing up i don't know how people sit in their st in their seats amen is burning amen on the west coast over there in louisiana is water's flooding everywhere over there in africa the locals are eating up everything there's drought everywhere don't y'all understand it the earth has been cursed there's judgment striking the earth we're in the midst of judgment but the only thing that keeps us from the judgment is the blood of jesus is that right it's like when rahab when they were shocking amen um jericho because of the scarlet robe the judgment that was pronounced on on jericho could not fall on rahab you think rahab was ringing her hands when the battle was going on no sir she had confidence hallelujah she had a promise that when the walls come down you and your house will be saved the bride of jesus christ has a promise that will all come down we will be saved is that right the prophet god said before one bomb drop we're going to be gone and i believe that hallelujah because the blood covers me [Music] not only does it cover it lives psalms 18. you know a lot of times we don't understand this word is perfect and i'm saying all of these things and i i know what i'm saying i believe this is with the will of god because this is fresh message i haven't even preached this at my own church god gave me this last night to put this message together for this service he vindicated it uh the pastor got up and talked about uh rest you know fear then almost every son will talk about no fear and the glory of god and who he is god and i don't know i just say it like this i'ma preach what he told me to preach i know it's here for somebody and we need to know amen god is talking directly to us because a lot of us don't have the confidence that we ought to have in prayer but you don't understand like i said the other day the angels of the lord is encamped about you you have an entourage you understand me not only does the angel of the lord but you have angels that have been dispatched on your behalf to protect you through this journey hallelujah it is the truth you can't see them but they're there and every now and again they will show themselves yes but even around this message they thank you crazy because you say you see an angel hallelujah well do they think i'm crazy because i say i got the holy ghost some of them thank you amen but i don't have a counterfeit i've got the real deal hallelujah how do you know brother brooks because he's changed me hallelujah he changed my walk he changed my talk he changed my friends he changed everything about me places i couldn't i couldn't change myself he changed me hallelujah [Music] you know i'ma say this because a lot of people they feel the holy ghost on the outside and they think praise god i'm on my way to heaven no you're not that may have been good for the age before but it doesn't work for this one hallelujah you know you know oh i'm gifted i'm getting you know that's good but the gifts of god and calling is without repentance god gave that to you when you was a ranked sinner hallelujah i'm not saying those things are not good but you cannot rest upon that whether you know it or not there's a lot of preachers in hell right now brother better call it a foot race hallelujah they're running because they've told people lies hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying now and i'm not i don't you know i'm including myself in this because i told the lord i said now lord i i've seen what happened to israel they seen all those miracles in egypt [Music] they saw the the the the red sea back up they saw manna come down they saw the pillar of fire they saw all of that and said they still was lost i said please god don't let me be that kind in the midst of all of that let me keep my eyes on you see that was the difference between joshua and caleb they knew where it was coming from they made a connection and let me tell you something people of god you've got to make a connection hallelujah and what people don't understand the pyramid is not in two parts anymore it is one whole because there are those who are making the connection oh god you say because i don't see it i don't see it but that don't mean a thing it's raining somewhere and i don't see it but because i don't believe it well it's raining somewhere down there in georgia somewhere you know what i'm saying i don't see it but it's raining god ain't no man that he's gonna show off in front of you he's humble and he's take those little people that don't mean nothing to the world take the scum of the earth hallelujah and then he began to use them is that right take the woman at the well amen she was a woman of prosecution but god used her she had better eyesight than the religious people hallelujah thank god i don't want to change nothing about my life everything i went through and i've gone through some hard times but i don't want to change nothing because had not been for all those bad things i couldn't love him the way i love him now like that song say can't nobody do me like jesus huh oh my hey you have no idea how i've been persecuted in this message all my life when i was in the baptist church i was i was too much then then i went from the baptist to the catholic from the catholic to the methodist you know i went to the catholic church and well it's a long story but anyhow but nevertheless i tell people nowadays i say the catholic got more movement in their church than most people it might be systematic but they sit down and get up they sit down and get up they kneel they get down they kneel you know what i'm saying they're moving but nevertheless amen i went to the uh methodist and i thought oh i was the only one looking like a jumping bean up there then i got to the pentecostal and you know what they told me brother shelly they say you shout too much you know that's what you know it was all right for the women to do it but when a man shouted too much don't ever tell me what i can't do you are in trouble right i try to tell some of these dead churches i say y'all provoke me to worship him yeah he went to a concert and everybody still but me and my wife we were both moving and everything else we look like we were out of order hallelujah see the rod the lord is my rock and my fortress starting from the second verse psalms 18. one of the brothers at my church a young preacher troy he he ministered this this scripture and i'm like oh my god that's mine that's mine and whenever he strikes something i always tell him i said his mind now the lord is my rock and my fortress my deliverer now let me tell you what the outer court will do the outer court will make this same scripture become an intellectual concept [Music] in other words you'll be able to quote it but there is nothing in here that's what's wrong with a lot of people they know the scripture but they don't have the power that only belongs in the heart y'all hear what i'm saying you can shout you let me tell you something the devil don't care if faith is not in the heart he don't care how much emotions you show i got a scripture for that and i'm gonna come to that quickly you know because because what we fail to see is that the word of god is not meant for your head the word of god is meant for your heart i'm not going to be real alone tonight this morning but i want you to understand we must allow the word of god to saturate the heart and when it saturates the heart it becomes you as long as the word and you are separate something is wrong because the word must become you and you must become the word did you know that yes this whole ark thing the ark of the covenant and i've got to preach it i got a lot of notes but i got to preach it you know the thing is the ark of the covenant you know what the ark of the covenant was it was god really in simple form and israel was was so happy about that they had the ark of the covenant and every time god would come down something would happen but what happened is the word became an idol [Music] it became an idol and when it became an idol it lost its power remember there was a time that israel had the ark and they were losing the battle because their mental attitude toward it was in the wrong place god never intended israel to worship it just like when the brass serpent was was made when they needed healing just gave it a little time and it became an idol and we've done the same thing even the books and the tapes not supposed to become an idol i've seen people have heard of people trying to cast out devils and then lay a book up on somebody's head the power in the book the power is in you supposed to be anyway hallelujah that's where that's the caudal man thinking like that let me say it like this i got to go head on with it but you see when jesus christ he was born the word the written word was now him word made flesh but there was more to him than that he needed the anointing you see what i'm saying because the word of god was in that little box we call the mercy seat there in the box but that word was dead letter until the shekinah came down that's why jesus when he was there hallelujah the spirit of god said to john the one you see the light of god come down like a dove that's the one hallelujah and when the holy ghost came on the word guess what he was led into the wilderness to be tested having the message in your mind is good but that's not where it's supposed to stay it's supposed to be in your heart that's what david said hide thy word in my heart lord that i might not sin against thee he did not say he hide it in my head the devil got it in his head hallelujah the ark was not in the outer court the ark was not in the inner court the ark was in the holies of holies that's where god came down am i making sense this message opened up the way that we could come into the holies of holies and then when we come into the holies of holies we come in like priests and kings hallelujah you understand me you can't be a king if you don't have the power and the authority to rule you came to rule why because this thing that was done in shadow and type has now moved into the human body this is why the bible said you and i we are the temple of god ah we're the tabernacle of god see you can't comprehend this by your head faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god in your heart is where you receive the word of god anyway let me hurry up with the scripture the lord is my rock in my fortress my deliverer my god my strength and whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from my enemies right the sorrows of death compass me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid huh the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me and in my distress this is what i love about it see when you call on the name of the lord something's got to happen oh in my distress i called upon him hallelujah and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my crowd came before him even unto his ears hallelujah when god hears your cry it shakes heaven wait a minute y'all y'all looking at me like i don't know what i'm talking about look at god's response then the earth shook and trembled the foundation also of the hills moved and was shaken because he was wroth was he upset because of how you were being treated hallelujah touch not my anointing and do my prophet no harm when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard what is it those angels all of heaven comes to your rescue [Applause] [Music] hallelujah but you got a call from god call on god from your heart not your head hallelujah there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of the mouth devoured coals were killed by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rolled upon the cherub and he did fly yeah he did fly upon the wings of his wings he made darkness his secret place his pavilion around about him were dark waters and thick clouds up the skies now when you see dark that don't mean he's evil that means he's mystical you can't understand him he's doing something that your brain can't comprehend hallelujah but he comes and when he comes hallelujah those of us we know when he comes hallelujah i can see shadrach meshach and abednego hey man getting ready to be thrown into the fiery furnace but they began to cry out to their god he didn't even answer them hallelujah they cried out let me tell you something when the pressure comes when the squeeze comes it does oh i gotta have a few goosebumps i don't know no sir why i know he always heareth my prayer hallelujah why shouldn't he hear your prayer if you covered by the blood hallelujah and if you're covered by the blood he always hear your prayer and when you pray you shake heaven is that right that's what brother branham said he says a son a son or daughter of god amen they're above the angels the angels are your servants you're above the angels and he said if an angel has a request and you've got a request your request is answered first hallelujah god don't put you on the waiting list like that glory first come first serve uh-uh you got to understand that god has changed your status you used to be a sinner hallelujah whatever you were doing you used to be but god has changed you from a sinner to a saint amen and then he's taking you up higher y'all understand me god is taking us higher we are not we oh my don't you understand you belong to the last age you belong to the bride of christ who has received great favor you know when somebody favors you that means you can get anything you want from them [Music] anything y'all understand me if god favored you the devil said you ain't gonna get it yes you will you might it may take a little time but you're gonna get it hallelujah now you say well what do you mean listen god favors us you're the favorite one and therefore what are you saying because they can't be complete without us you're favored you're the greatest of all ages this age because this is the wicked the most wicked age ever the darkest it's ever been and yet god say look at this devil even in your eden with all your yo yo yo your way of pleasure i still got somebody that loves me i still got somebody that's gonna hold to my truth i still have somebody that can hear my voice and love me yes sir hey the devil can't offer me nothing he can but i don't i don't want nothing god what can he give me i know him see it's not only that i know the law but i know him hallelujah i know how he treated me i'll never forget how he oh i should be dead people i planned i used to be i should be dead dodging bullets and everything why why why one of those bullets didn't hit me because even when i was a sinner he knew me hallelujah he knew i had to be here hallelujah he protected me even when i did what didn't even deserve to be protected see y'all don't know i could tell y'all stuff and you you like but i can't do that because some of y'all ain't strong enough but anyway [Laughter] y'all know that's the truth you can't tell everything [Laughter] [Music] and at the brightness the 12th verse let me move on at the brightness that was before him he's his thick clouds pass hail storms and coals of fire look the whole nature is interrupted because you prayed the lord 13th verse the lord has thundered in heaven and the highest gave his voice hail storms and coals of fire yeah this is what i try to tell people i say don't you understand every one of us are praying lord jesus have mercy lord we want to leave this place now do y'all pray like that i do i do i've gotten to a place i lay on my bed and hold my breath and hope and die take me lord y'all like y'all never been there hallelujah you know but the thing is you can't go until he's ready you know why i believe i'm going to make a rapture because i i talked to the lord when the doctor said i had cancer and i think i've testified to this i said but you know what i said lord i don't if you if i'm not afraid to die i've met god i'm not afraid to die and i says lord i said but you know if you're going to keep me here just to go to mcdonald's or burger king just something trivial like that i say take me but i said if you can allow me to see the trans hey go with the god if you could allow me to see the translation i said lord if i'm here to see the translation no matter what i got to go through then i know you'll keep me here because i don't want to be here amen just to do trivial things i don't need a new house i don't need a new car i don't need none of that i want jesus that's all i want and like they say he is all right yeah he sent out his arrows and he scattered them and he shout out lightning i can't go through the whole thing but what did they do listen at the 18th verse 19th verse he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me see you get god to delight in you he all heaven will back you [Applause] is that right it's the truth god amen is here to delight in you and you you allow you know when you obey god see when you obey god from the heart there is no murmuring in complaining hmm no murmuring come on oh lord i got i got to go over there and help that sister again today y'all know how it is we do it before we even think about it and i i do it sometime too i look at that number i'm like later i'll talk to you later god's still working on me y'all know it's your truth you know it's the truth but god is still working i'm still trying to surrender all that i've got to him i want to be when somebody called me in the need i'm like yes lord ain't nothing but the truth nothing but the truth and i'm not gonna i don't i don't want to spend a whole lot of time tonight this morning but first samuel fourth chapter you don't have to turn there but but i want you to want to say that here it was israel and you know they let me read it and the word of lord came to samuel to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitch beside ebenezer and the philistine pitched at in apac in fact and the philistines put themselves in a ray against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about about four thousand my question is see one thing about david he understood that god wasn't just in a box he didn't have to go and run to jerusalem or wherever the ark of the covenant was to and pray as god you know goliath is out there come help me he carried his god with him hallelujah and that's what we need to learn how to do is carry our god with us and the problem is we forget he's there we get in trouble like oh god have mercy and he's like i'm here what's wrong with you it's the truth and he's right there and we're looking everywhere and the bible said he ain't in heaven the bible said he's naive even in your mouth hallelujah and until we get into that place we ought to be which is that's your kind of glory not someday all day every day god in you the hope of glory that's where god is calling this little bride not to a religion not to a system but he's calling us so that we can become him a love affair doing the same things he's always done hallelujah there was never any fear in christ jesus help us jesus they were losing the battle why because they forgot god was with them they they thought god was just only in the box and remember when they say okay let's go get let's go get the ark of the covenant they went and got the ark of the covenant and they went up in a real warship a real praise but let me tell you something god don't care about that he wants you to recognize where he is hallelujah oh we feel the anointing people of god that's all good but god ain't just coming down god's supposed to be in you you understand me he's supposed to be in you and those two spirits are supposed to connect you should never have to say to an audience y'all come on now come on that's nonsense that's almost like my wife begging me to kiss her if your wife got to beg you to kiss her you need you trouble you got troubles you got you serious troubles normally you know what she said ah every time i look around you y'all know what i'm talking about but anyhow you and i must recognize what god is doing he likes he god is a lover you know god is a lover you don't believe it read songs of solomon god is a lover and he wants somebody to love on him just like he loves on you you don't want no forced issue yes sir you love the lord let me hurry up romans 7 you can come there with me i'm just going to jump a little bit you can read those scriptures for yourself you can see that what happened is they they forgot that god was with them all along but they put god in that box and that's where he stayed for perhaps he didn't fight for them god wants you to know that he's in your heart that's where he fights for you when he knows you're in the tabernacle or he's in the tabernacle you understand me hallelujah those hebrew boys think about it just a shadow and type over there but then you look at eli eli represented the backslidden pentecostals right let his sons and everybody do whatever they wanted to do eli wasn't right hallelujah you all hear me oh sometimes you got to stand against my children think i'm crazy anyway and i tell them y'all right i'm crazy in love with jesus don't take sides only side i take is jesus for that which i do i allow not for what i would that i do not but what i hate and that i do right if then i do that which i would not that's the 25th verse i consent unto the law that it is good that's all i'm trying to say whenever you allow the word of god just to be here in your mind you know what it's going to do it's going to cause sin to be more exceedingly great because you can't stop sin in your mind only the heart only the heart that's what paul was trying to say paul said listen i know evil is always present and there are times i i'm not working from the in the core i'm not working from the holy holies and then i find out when i'm not working with the holies of holies i find myself coming short is that right but if i work from here all the time i get victory all the time because jesus christ is there pastor i hope i'm saying something that'll bless you because i'm at a place right now all i could think about is getting closer to jesus you know my thing is this we're at a late date we're at a time that we have played message for a long time and it's time out for that it really is you know so oh well i you know people say well god give us grace oh grace but you know god said oh paul said shall i continue in sin that grace may abound he said god forbid hallelujah god expect for us to overcome these things you cannot get in the holies of holies being unclean that's automatic death even the high priest couldn't do it right if they had something going on in their life and they and they would walk into that place it was instant death and they had to pull them out of the stream but you know how a lot of times people don't understand their damn way because a lot of time when you see people come to church and they can't even make no noise huh ain't making no noise i ain't that kind no you you're dead you you need a resurrection [Music] you ain't got a jumping shot like me but you need to make some noise don't even get excited about the word something wrong you know what it is i sometimes when i say you know because if the word was in your spirit at least you're jerk a little bit you know what i'm saying you do something i said well where is this word where is this word you know it's because everybody you know people and i'm not trying to make it funny but the truth of the matter is something ain't right you know how we danced here the other night i guarantee you a lot of people have criticism about it but who cares who cares you know we're not here to gain popularity of no man we're here for jesus christ and him alone hallelujah that's why we do what we do we want to please him we could care less about saul's daughter don't trouble me she can look through her window and call me what she want to call me but it ain't going to stop my dancing hallelujah yes sir right that's one thing i know i can do hallelujah yes sir he ain't taking mine [Music] it's the truth when i was in the world i was a dancer oh i used to get it [Laughter] i'm just telling you the truth when i used to have parties almost every week so i could dance everybody knew everything was free right and i didn't wait nobody start y'all come in i'm already on the floor you know that's the kind of person i was you know i didn't go to a club amen to to wait every time everybody else could come on the floor i was on the floor and you mean to tell me i come to find out that this gift that i have came from god and the devil exploited it hallelujah and you want me to come into the house of the god and then sit still oh no no no that ain't gonna happen hallelujah these legs and these feet that's what i've got hallelujah was given to me to dance and to praise god with and i'm going to always do it [Applause] i'll do it when people ain't around hallelujah listen no matter how much anointing it is you've got to get in god's provided position see david anointing was all right but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary lines hallelujah it you can't carry it on a cart it's got to be over your heart that's where the word and the anointing must be in your heart [Music] otherwise you're bringing death to yourself help me jesus oh lord god is good to us you must understand amen every all of these supernatural things that we have seen all of those things were good but you got to make a connection you can't go by what brother branham said huh what he said was right but you got to commit connect to that the god he's talking about the god he's preaching about you got to make your own connection y'all am i wrong or right it's all right to say what brother branham did but daddy don't stop there how did they overcome they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of god testimony not somebody else's testimony he has had his testimony you must have yours you got to have your own hallelujah that's all i'm saying and then when you start talking like that people say well he don't believe the message you got it wrong i believe the message more than you do because i know the message didn't stop with the prophet the the same living god that used him has come to use me he may not use me the way he used him but he came to use me [Applause] hallelujah and i want the lord to use me can you imagine you going up there where they got all kinds of testimonies going on and you ain't got nothing think about it you don't have one thing to say i don't want to be there when i get over there i want to show my battle scars yeah that's the time you show them off right i want to show my testimonies i want to have something i can say lord this is what i used to be but look what you made me hallelujah these are kind of friends i used to hang with but lord look what you gave me see what people don't understand i don't have a family this family of god is all i got hallelujah you okay by god's grace you understand i showed you that prayer scripture to make you see that when you pray it puts heaven into motion prayer is just not just saying words prayer is that right well what about the little story brother we haven't talked about when the the the hebrew boys was in trouble and it's just the illustration but he says hey uh uh uh wormwood went over up to christ and said lord can i go he says no he said just give me a minute and i'll turn the world upside down and he could do it he did it in the days of the antelopian day he could have done it different angels came lord let me let me go let me go jesus said no no no no i've been watching this thing i'm going down myself see that's what other what people don't understand sometimes angels come into the audience and you feel the presence but when he comes when he comes hallelujah it changes the whole situation somebody help me here it changes the whole situation even our prophet was here when he was here he had jesus on the inside didn't he he said but i'm waiting on him somehow that you should understand there was a greater something coming whoo the captain of the lord rose i ain't got to worry about no demon i ain't got to worry about cancer i ain't got to worry about tuberculosis i ain't got to worry about anybody a blind or lame or maim why because he's coming and when he comes he sets everything in order you think i'm going to worry listen when the political realm and and all of the world council churches and when they start coming what you going to do bite your fingernails this is your hour this is your day what yes moses why are you crying i've given you the authority i've given you the word people is that right they'll never be able to do with us what they they did through the church ages hallelujah you know why because we've got something they did not have he said we're gonna we're gonna suffer yeah you will but not like they did we won't go through the great tribulation but you're gonna be tried and it's gonna be so dark it's gonna be so dark you might even feel a little fear but one thing i know is that perfect love casts out fear you say well brother brooks what are you saying i'm almost done but i'm because i'm trying to bring us to a place this whole bible is in your favor but as long as you keep it in the book it ain't helping you this book god become you it's got to be listen i think i told y'all this one day i was in my kitchen and the lord spoke to me he said this book is you [Music] blew me away [Music] i'm him he's me you said well brother brooks i mean you know you don't see nothing yet you ain't got to see nothing yet but there are things happening i'm trying to tell you there are things happening and because you don't see it it doesn't mean it's not happening but listen i'm not watching to see something happen in you i want it to happen in me that's why i'm looking here how can i get satisfied with if if god's just working in you i might as well would have been like those people in brother branham's day they were crippled [Applause] they were because they were using used to him doing everything and the whole time he was trying to get them to do things preachers you pre you pray for the sick right sisters you lay hands on on people you you you you well i can't do nothing because brother branham is here but that wasn't the way it was supposed to be people made it that way and now people are still crippled by it they crippled you go places they don't even believe that god can raise the dead anymore i am here to tell you i've seen him do it twice [Music] i've seen cancer here i've seen tumors healed i've seen blood pressure diabetes you name it i have seen it and it wasn't me doing it it was him because he's alive and well he's still alive and well he's still real he's still god and why should i fear when he has commanded me fear not little flock you don't have to fear like our brother said the mighty angel has taken the book he's calm and he's here today like you're like i heard you heard me say the other day he didn't go back up he's still here put one lane fade on the land another one to see he's still here and he's conquering and possessing right now there are people all over the world that's really seeing the exploits of god and so many people say well when the squeeze come we'll see it in full force most of us ain't seeing it in no force but we always want to put it on out i want to know what happened to today he's just saying yesterday today what happened to today let's see jesus today i want to see him today [Music] like let me tell you something i got eight kids and only a few of them serving the lord and the devil just make them cut up all the time do things to try to make me worry and sometimes i get right on the edge you know and then god brings me back to the promise i don't care what you do devil hallelujah i don't care what it's look like i got a promise hallelujah and all of god's promises are yay hallelujah i don't care what it looks like god has already saved my children [Applause] he promised me hallelujah yeah his promises are true people we don't have to worry about fear don't let the devil upset you i guess i've gotten in this talking because i can't help it i just somebody god is talking to you know what i'm saying don't let the devil put you in such a place of fear i don't care if your pro your relative out there in a drunken or on drugs and and look like they'll never return that ain't got nothing to do with it nothing don't you look at those those uh lying vanities you know what you put in them and i i tell you what i've asked every backslider there is who backslid from god you know what they say they never had peace because god would always remind them you mocked and if there be anybody in here talk about going out there you ain't gonna have no peace you out there looking looking for love if you can't find it here you sure won't be able to find it out there i think what you need to do is watch some tv and see how those people treat each other you think you're gonna be treated differently no no no let me tell you saints of god you young girls and young boys let me tell you what you already mocked and the world knows you when you don't even know yourself hallelujah and when you come out there they target you they know who they can use they know who they can abuse they know who they can get over on and you're so messed up you don't even know how to respond back to them [Applause] got too much word in you you see what i'm saying you need to understand amen with this devil pulling on you that devil comes to steal kill and destroy you think listen i had a daughter of mine she told me she want to go she want to be beautiful you ought to see her now look at her picture she used to be beautiful but what the devil has done to her and i don't know not one girl that have gone out from god trying to be beautiful and you come back ugly i'ma say it's the truth you come back ugly any real man will tell you that if a woman got nice hair it meant that's attractive y'all i don't mean i don't know why i'm on this but you come back in here looking like little birds it's the truth every hail dude out there look like a bird from the zoo it's the truth you know put all them unnatural colors and everything else in your hair looking like some kind of creature and the devil got you said ooh i'm so beautiful he has blinded you and let me tell you something no blind man know what they look like it's only the people who can see [Music] help us jesus no it's true it's true and these guys out here come on folks i don't know why we can't make a rapture like this but i'm gonna tell you something you ain't never been spanked by god when god spanked you you know you've been spanked hallelujah i went to go to go um spank my grandson and and my my granddaughter gave me his little wimpy belt i say that belt ain't gonna do nothing the wind ain't even scared of it i'm gonna strain myself trying to swing this belt because it ain't got nothing to it i said go find me something but she was trying to protect him you know so i just had to give him get him one thing i know about this hand i said if i can't get the other part i get the hand y'all know what i'm saying i don't get a belt with it i get my hand and we join together [Laughter] yeah i need something that's going to work and my kids always tried to tell me he said daddy i remember when you used to whip me you had this big old belt and you had jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the problem it is that's the problem i hang on with my my mama used to tell me and i'm closing in just a bit my mom used to tell me you know um um she said you better whip that child you don't whip them they're going to whip you and y'all forgive me that they can lock me up for saying this but i tell you one thing i um [Music] i better not say i better not say that because y'all don't think i'm evil [Music] but one thing i i tell my kids and you know those boys they get up my mama say you smelling yourself ain't it they when they get sassy that's what they're doing and i've been a good daddy and i tell them i said y'all i've been a good daddy i've been good you should've had mine but i've been a good daddy i've been a good father i you have no right and there's nothing that you can you can you can justify for sassying me no my mama didn't believe in talking back and i don't either if you if you want to really see the the lion in me ask my sons ask my son i'm just saying i'm just saying i don't know who i'm talking to but i'm just saying because i want you to understand amen when my my boys and it was so bold they were both each one of them the only one one one had wisdom the other three they thought they gonna come at me and and raise up one came at me before i knew it my daddy's instincts came in it's the truth before i knew it i had him above my head just like that now y'all think i'm crazy but at that moment i was i ain't gonna tell you the rest of the story but i'm going to tell you something i don't i don't play that my grandkids i got some young men in my church think i mean to my grandkids i said listen their mommy and daddy ain't doing it somebody got to do it well you you ought to be nicer you look what they turning out to be they ain't listening and this generation is hard-headed anyhow y'all don't let this face fool you it may look soft it ain't i don't know how i can look you know what i'm saying i look at my face because it's all round and everything but don't let it fool you you know i try to tell people i say we are who we are [Music] i can't help it i'm going to stand right for the word and ain't nobody and you know and i try to tell my one of my last daughter my one of my daughters my oldest daughter she was 21 22 years old married and had kids and she sass at me that's the last time i whipped her when she called my well my husband i say well your husband ain't got nothing to do with you this i say i'm your daddy i ain't scared of her husband y'all forgive me but my point my point is you're still my daughter [Music] my mama said that to my daughter what my what my sister i i guess i'm repeating what she did and my sister was married and had two kids too and she says my mom and my mama wow she said mom my mama said yeah i brought you in and i'll take you out she was so humiliated she couldn't even cry and i don't mean no harm that's me i i just don't like disrespect that's horrible especially when your parents done labored for you like that suffered and everything you don't even realize it what they've gone through for you and then you can stand in their face like that oh my goodness if y'all need somebody to hire [Laughter] you love the lord [Laughter] i tell you what people of god if you can understand what i'm trying to tell us we got to get closer and i want to say to the young people in noah's day there was young people sodom and gomorrah there was young people there are so many young people that was left behind and lost because many of them thought because they were young they they could get away you can't get away you understand me when the word of god says plainly obedience is better than sacrifice and you and i we're living in a dangerous age and i'm going to tell you something don't look at everybody in the church people will throw you off you got to have your own mind made up i hope something has been said don't fear nothing i don't fear nothing i remember closing my wife spanked one of my boys i think well he was still in uh he was like at first or second grade and he went to the school showing his weps do y'all still get whips don't be ashamed y'all wept shows up better than ours i had a white friend of mine and something was going on on his neck i said oh man your neck is red he said brother brooks i'm white i thought something had done beating my head you know but that's okay i had to learn i'm learning but but you know he went to school and and and they got dss on us my wife is a champion you don't push her yeah she's so humble and sweet but you don't back up in a corner but anyhow they brought dss to the house and i'm nervous now i'm shaking because i'm thinking they're going to take my son and i was so nervous and nervous and my wife that was one time i was glad she she spoke up because i didn't know what to say she said ma'am she said neither my husband nor i spank our children in anger and i don't i do not i'm not out of control you understand me the only times i was out of control was when my boys challenged me and i was out of control but normally i'm not out of control and uh we when we talk to them and they know when they're getting a spanking but she said to that lady she said let me tell you something if you think i'm gonna stand here and lie to you and tell you i'm not gonna spank them again when they know when they get a spanking they deserve it she said if you think i'm gonna lie and tell you it ain't gonna happen she said i tell you what why don't you take him you should have seen my son eyes why don't you take him and raise him when she said that that lady closed that book and said i'll see you later and i i i'll never forget that to me she was heroic yeah yeah and that was true and because we we we're so afraid i see people in the grocery store and them little kids need there have been times i spoke out i said get them i won't care i give them some confidence i ain't gonna tell it i don't know how kid i don't know how people do it today i really don't know because i can remember when you fell out on the floor my mama was down there so quick she was lifting you up yeah you know falling out on her and she'll tell you now when we get to the stove she said don't you ask for nothing if you ask for something you gonna get it they meant business back in those days that's why these kids are wildlife animals they like animals you gotta whip this flesh [Laughter] y'all don't believe it but it's true i don't raise eight i don't raise eight and i had one boy to tell me say daddy you didn't whip me enough i said let's go back but he turned out to be a good good guy he's actually he's actually going for his doctorate in nursing so he's turned out to be a good little fella i love the lord you love him don't be afraid folks and i'm going to tell you something when your children mature when they mature they'll look back and they'll tell you daddy mama you were right if they don't ever tell you that they have never matured because they're going to be a stage in their life they're going to blame all their problems on you you did this because you didn't let me do this because you didn't know that right yeah no no you're right i saw those those were snakes in the yard and you weren't gonna play with the snakes i don't care how pretty they were and how they mesmerize you i was not going to allow you to play with the snakes you love the lord don't be afraid to stand true to the word of god if you're going to be

sweater weather because it looked like that's where we were headed and then it turned warm again but we know that we don't control the calendar or the weather it's in god's hands so a camp meeting next year will begin on tuesday night september the 21st and we'll go all the way through sunday september the 26th because all of the feasts are early next year it happens to be the restarting of
