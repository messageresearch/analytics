[0:00] Somebody said, "Wouldn't it be wonderful
[0:01] to live like that with the absence of
[0:03] fear?" I am here to tell you today that
[0:07] that is the inheritance of the bride. If
[0:11] you could recognize, if I could
[0:13] recognize who I am, there would be the
[0:16] absence of fear. We would recognize that
[0:20] he's on board.
[0:22] Doesn't matter whether he's sleeping or
[0:24] whether he's awake. He's on board.
[0:28] He's on board. He's in the midst of the
[0:30] storm. He's in the midst of the anxiety,
[0:33] the trouble. He's in the midst of the
[0:36] crisis. He's in the midst of the chaos.
[0:39] And I believe there's a people being
[0:42] prepared and positioned in this hour to
[0:46] live in the absence of fear, to live in
[0:48] the absence of anxiety, to live with the
[0:52] authority of the bridegroom.
[0:55] I believe it. this reality of sitting
[0:58] together with him
[1:01] in heavenly places.
[1:04] Oh, brother, sister, above it all.
[1:07] Above it all in heavenly places and and
[1:11] not even having to come down to go to
[1:13] work because it's a spiritual position
[1:19] with a cancer diagnosis. You don't have
[1:21] to come down to go and do your job. You
[1:25] don't have to come down because it's a
[1:27] spiritual positioning. It's a placement
[1:29] of the whale sons, the mature sons of
[1:33] God. Those who used to suck the bottle,
[1:36] but they no longer have to suck the
[1:38] bottle because they have cut their teeth
[1:40] on the meat of the revelation of who
[1:42] Jesus Christ is. Not a historical figure
[1:46] but the living word. Not only among us
[1:51] [Music]
[1:53] but in us.
[1:55] That's our reality.
[1:57] I know we get disturbed
[2:00] daily. And you know why that happens?
[2:04] Because we allow it. We make excuses to
[2:08] live below our means. What about
[2:10] somebody deciding, I'm not going to make
[2:13] excuses for my lack of faith anymore.
[2:15] I'm going to find what it is that needs
[2:18] to be awakened in me. I'm going to find
[2:21] the missing piece that needs to come to
[2:24] life in me so that I can begin to use
[2:27] the authority that's mine.
[2:30] It's bridal inheritance.
[2:32] It's the inheritance of the wife, the
[2:35] voice of the bridegroom
[2:37] in the bride. Whose voice is going to
[2:39] talk through the trouble? The
[2:41] bridegroom's voice. That's his
[2:43] authority. That's what it's talking
[2:45] about. I want to see some miracles.
[2:49] I want to see some miracles in this
[2:50] house. I want to see some chronic
[2:53] conditions go. I want to see some people
[2:56] that have suffered for years wait it out
[2:59] and move in this place of authority and
[3:02] come back. I I have I've lived under the
[3:05] burden of this infirmity my whole life,
[3:07] but I'm made whole. I am 100% made
[3:10] whole.
[3:12] Well, what did what happened? What? I
[3:14] guess brother so and so prayed for you.
[3:15] I guess this one prayed for you and saw
[3:17] a vision and everything turned out all
[3:18] right. No, I just made up my mind
[3:22] that I had authority in his name by his
[3:25] blood with his word. I had authority to
[3:29] make my storm
[3:33] We don't understand the authority that
[3:35] has been given to us. Somebody said,
[3:37] "Well, I've tried it and it didn't work
[3:39] before." Line up your life. Let your
[3:40] life line up. Make a little effort. Make
[3:44] sure there's no dead cats on the line.
[3:46] Make sure there's no unrepented sin in
[3:48] your life. Make sure you've been
[3:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:51] Christ. Make sure you have the baptism
[3:53] of the Holy Ghost. The one who walks and
[3:55] talks. The one who's ever more alive.
[3:57] The one that causes you to have strength
[3:59] to live above sin. The one that deals
[4:02] with temptation in your life. That Holy
[4:04] Ghost. That one. That one. That one
[4:06] that'll take you out of yourself and
[4:08] plunge you in the realm of spirit.
[4:10] The one that can rescue you from your
[4:12] own flesh and put you in a dimension of
[4:15] supernatural existence. Come on. That
[4:17] one that we need him. We need the Holy
[4:20] Ghost. Not a feeling, not an emotion,
[4:22] not a thrill. We need the person,
[4:26] the reality of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[4:29] You're living in an hour greater greater
[4:31] than the generations before you. You're
[4:34] living in an hour where God said, "I'm
[4:36] going to manifest sons
[4:39] on the earth." Amen. I was the seed that
[4:42] went in the ground. Our Lord said,
[4:44] "You're the harvest."
[4:48] You'll never get that by visiting him
[4:50] casually from time to time. You'll only
[4:53] find that place when you hang with him.
[4:58] When you choose
[5:00] him over and over and over and over and
[5:02] over and over in
