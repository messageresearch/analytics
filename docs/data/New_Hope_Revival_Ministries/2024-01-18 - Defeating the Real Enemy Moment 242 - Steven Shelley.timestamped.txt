[0:00] amen how many of you want to endend if
[0:02] Jesus terries you want to end both the
[0:06] Hebrew year and the fall and the
[0:08] Gregorian year on December 31st 2024 you
[0:12] want to end it by this
[0:15] testimony my feet did not slip I climbed
[0:18] some mountains this year I took some
[0:21] well I feel good I took some Spiritual
[0:25] Authority and my jurisdiction in the
[0:28] realm of the spirit was expanded Ed come
[0:31] on now and some devils had to get out of
[0:34] my way because I recognized who I was
[0:38] and who God was in me in that situation
[0:43] I'm not going to just beat the air and
[0:45] strike without an
[0:49] adversary it's like Chief Joseph said we
[0:53] as an Indian people have fought so many
[0:56] insignificant Wars among ourselves let
[1:00] me let me hear
[1:03] you that when the Real Enemy came that's
[1:05] me and you the white folks when the Real
[1:08] Enemy came we were so defeated our
[1:11] spirit so
[1:13] broken our resolve so smeared until we
[1:17] were defeated before the enemy had we
[1:21] not spent so much energy fighting the
[1:24] air but recognizing who the real enemy
[1:28] is it's not Church against church or
[1:31] preacher against preacher it's a child
[1:35] of God against the enemy of
[1:38] God because really he hates God and you
[1:42] get in the way between him and God so
[1:45] you become the target you know the
[1:48] reality is the devil knows that he may
[1:50] be able to sway the nominal Christian
[1:54] but he'll never be able to cause the
[1:56] bride to fail he knows that and yet he
[2:00] refuses to leave you alone and go to
[2:02] somebody else do you know why because
[2:05] he's a
[2:06] kleptomaniac he's a
[2:09] masochist he likes seeing your
[2:13] pain he knows he can't change your I'm
[2:16] going to preach now he knows he can't
[2:19] change your Eternal Destiny he can't
[2:22] change your election or your
[2:24] predestination or your
[2:28] destination
