[0:00] The reality is one with him.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; The reality is before the foundations of
[0:08] this world, God desired to have
[0:12] fellowship
[0:16] &gt;&gt; he desired to have intimacy, not
[0:19] sexuality, intimacy
[0:22] &gt;&gt; with the people.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; He desired, can you imagine? He desired
[0:27] a counterpart.
[0:33] How unbelievable.
[0:35] [Music]
[0:36] How unbelievable that the creator of all
[0:40] that we know would long to have
[0:42] fellowship with a counterpart when he
[0:45] dwelt alone
[0:47] &gt;&gt; with his thoughts.
[0:50] Elohim.
[0:52] Not a multiple of personality,
[0:55] not a multiple of person, but a multiple
[0:58] of attributes. Elohim, he dwelt alone
[1:01] with his thoughts. And one of those
[1:04] thoughts and some of those attributes
[1:06] are represented in this meeting. He
[1:08] longed to have fellowship. The whole
[1:10] reason why Eve was taken from Adam, it's
[1:13] a part. Look, look, folks, that wasn't
[1:15] the reality. That was the type. The the
[1:18] the reality was there was a a bride in
[1:21] Christ
[1:23] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; She was in him as an attribute like Eve
[1:28] was inside of Adam
[1:33] &gt;&gt; called he them
[1:36] &gt;&gt; both in the same body. He separated a
[1:39] bride not by a rib. This is metaphor.
[1:44] He longed to have fellowship. and what
[1:47] he was looking for was in him.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; While he's looking around to find it,
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Adam sees the animals with a mate, he
[1:58] has no mate.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; The reason why Adam had to come to this
[2:02] reality is because the creator had
[2:05] already come to the same reality.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; I have no mate.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; I have no wife. I have no bride. I have
[2:14] no counterpart. I fellowship in my own
[2:17] attributes and thoughts. He longed. I
[2:21] tell you folks, if you can get a glimpse
[2:23] of this greatest, it's the greatest
[2:25] romance.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; There is no story like this story. You
[2:30] can't believe it with head knowledge.
[2:32] You can only access it with faith.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; But he found a way. He found a way. And
[2:38] it was an overnight way. It wasn't an
[2:39] instant way. It wasn't a microwavable
[2:41] way. It was a way that would take 6,000
[2:44] years. and eventually seven church ages
[2:48] &gt;&gt; to even begin to execute it on planet
[2:51] earth.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; First, he wasn't even a god
[2:58] &gt;&gt; because there was nothing to worship him
[3:00] as such.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; So, he had to create a heavenly host
[3:06] &gt;&gt; that would worship him.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Were they forced to do so? Evidently
[3:10] not,
[3:11] &gt;&gt; right? because a portion of them
[3:13] rebelled and followed Lucifer.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; So, they must have also had an
[3:16] opportunity to decide for themselves
[3:20] &gt;&gt; and you do too.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Ex's just one little caveat
[3:25] and that is he knew your choice
[3:28] &gt;&gt; before you were ever formed in your
[3:29] mother's womb.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; He already knew your choice. Brother
[3:34] Brandham's preaching about Calvary that
[3:36] day at Calvary and he talks about God
[3:39] reaching in and separating from Christ,
[3:41] the bridegroom, pulling the bride out.
[3:45] Same kind of same kind of typology that
[3:48] we saw over there. It wasn't about Adam.
[3:52] It wasn't even originally about Christ.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; It was about creator.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was about what came forth from
[3:59] the logos.
[4:01] Desiring to have fellowship.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Did he desire worship? He did.
[4:10] But there was something he desired more
[4:12] than worship.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Fellow. Someone say it with me.
[4:17] Fellowship.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Fellowship.
[4:20] Some of you have
[4:22] &gt;&gt; had moments
[4:25] where his presence became so real that
[4:28] it was realer than than your reality.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; And you don't want to strut around the
[4:35] room like a rooster
[4:36] &gt;&gt; when you get in that presence.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; What you really want to do is find a
[4:41] place under the carpet. Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Just let me lay down and get as low as I
[4:50] possibly can in that moment that he has
[4:54] become a covert,
[4:57] a shelter,
[5:00] a tabernacle,
[5:02] shutting out life,
[5:06] shutting me in to his glory.
