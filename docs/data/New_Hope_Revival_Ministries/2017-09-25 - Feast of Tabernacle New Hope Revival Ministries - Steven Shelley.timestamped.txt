[0:01] hi I'm pastor Shelly and I've been
[0:04] thinking about our international camp
[0:06] meeting that's coming up October the 8th
[0:09] through the 15th
[0:11] it's almost upon us and I'm believing
[0:13] the Lord for an outstanding time we'd
[0:17] certainly like for you to come and be
[0:18] with us we have our camp meeting now
[0:20] during the Feast of Tabernacles or at
[0:23] least that's the way the Lord has
[0:24] directed us over the last few years some
[0:27] people say well isn't Tabernacles just
[0:29] from the past and we say no actually
[0:32] Tabernacles is a part of our past it is
[0:35] a part of our present it is a part of
[0:37] our future it was a Feast of the Lord
[0:39] that was ordained in the scripture where
[0:42] the people of God were told to dwell in
[0:44] Sioux cos in temporary structures as
[0:47] they journeyed to remember how God had
[0:50] protected them and how he had brought
[0:51] them through the wilderness so every
[0:54] year it is a time of remembering the
[0:57] faithfulness of God presently it reminds
[1:00] us that God Himself tabernacled in a
[1:05] body of flesh our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08] that's how much God loved you and I that
[1:11] he came down in spirit form into the
[1:15] body of a our Lord Jesus Christ created
[1:19] just for the purpose of redemption
[1:22] he became the most excellent priest
[1:25] because he became a body of flesh his
[1:29] blood perfect blood creative bloodshed
[1:33] for you and I to be redeemed so we think
[1:36] about that also during the time of
[1:38] Tabernacles but it's also a part of our
[1:41] future Tabernacles Zechariah chapter 14
[1:44] it tells us beginning in verse 16 and it
[1:48] shall come to pass that every one that
[1:50] is left of all the nations which came
[1:53] against Jerusalem shall even go up from
[1:55] year to year to worship the king the
[1:58] Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of
[2:01] the Tabernacles and it shall be that
[2:04] whoso will not come up of all the
[2:07] families of the earth unto Jerusalem to
[2:09] worship the king the Lord of Hosts even
[2:12] upon them shall be no rain and if the
[2:15] family of Egypt go not up and come not
[2:17] and have no rain there shall be the
[2:19] plague wherewith the Lord will smite the
[2:21] heathen that come not up to the Feast of
[2:23] Tabernacles this shall be the punishment
[2:26] of Egypt the punishment of all nations
[2:28] that come not up to keep the Feast of
[2:31] Tabernacles it goes on to say in that
[2:33] day there shall be upon the bells of the
[2:36] horses holiness unto the Lord and even
[2:39] in the pots in the Lord's house shall be
[2:42] like the bowls before the altar
[2:44] this is Tabernacles future this is
[2:47] millennial remembrance of Tabernacles we
[2:52] choose this time of year because it's a
[2:53] time to come together and reflect upon
[2:56] all the goodness the faithfulness of the
[2:59] Lord in the present year it's a time of
[3:01] harvest it's a time to remember what God
[3:04] has supernaturally placed in our hands
[3:07] and it's from that harvest it's from
[3:10] those blessings that we again sow seed
[3:14] for the next year for the next harvest
[3:16] it's such a principle in God's dealings
[3:20] with his children through the scripture
[3:22] that we come together and thank God for
[3:25] early rain so that the latter rains come
[3:28] or we come together and thank God that
[3:31] the first grain has come to maturity and
[3:34] we do that prophetically to look forward
[3:37] in anticipation to the rest of the grain
[3:41] coming to maturity I want you to know
[3:43] that it is a prophetic time to be
[3:46] gathered together wherever you are in
[3:48] the name of the Lord but why don't you
[3:50] come and gather together with us here
[3:53] corporately we're we're going to be
[3:55] worshiping the Lord and celebrating the
[3:57] goodness of God also on October the 13th
[4:00] Friday night and the service we're gonna
[4:02] dedicate our new studio and our new
[4:05] broadcast equipment that God is
[4:07] supernaturally provided for us so that
[4:10] we can again step into another part of
[4:13] the mandate that he is placed upon this
[4:16] small little ministry here in Smith
[4:19] Station Alabama
[4:20] and I'd like for you to be a part of
[4:22] both camp-meeting and also the
[4:24] dedication of our studio and I'd like
[4:26] for you to just come together and
[4:28] celebrate the faithfulness and the
[4:30] goodness of the Lord at the great time
[4:32] of the Feast of Tabernacles I remember
[4:35] in the New Testament scripture when they
[4:38] were carrying out the water libation
[4:40] during this particular time of the year
[4:43] of the biblical year we could even say
[4:45] and the priest is bringing the water
[4:47] from the pool of Siloam and he's pouring
[4:50] it out over the altar as a thanksgiving
[4:53] offering to God thanking God for the way
[4:56] he has provided the rains in the
[4:58] previous season and for the rains that
[5:01] it will be much needed in the coming
[5:03] season and in the middle of this most
[5:05] solemn ceremony our Lord Jesus
[5:09] worshiping his father in the temple
[5:11] cries out if any man thirst let him come
[5:15] to me and drink when I when I reflect
[5:19] upon that event the the of course a lot
[5:23] of tradition had crept in and it must
[5:25] have been sort of a religious and
[5:27] ceremonial moment the people knew enough
[5:31] to be respectful and actually the feast
[5:33] was a very joyous time Sukkot or
[5:36] Tabernacles was a time of great
[5:37] celebration but this particular moment
[5:40] was known to be quite a solemn and and
[5:43] quiet moment until the water was poured
[5:46] and I like to think about that our Lord
[5:49] he he's not much for the traditions of
[5:53] men you know we can take the truths of
[5:55] God God's Word and make them so dry and
[5:58] so starchy that there's really no longer
[6:01] any spirit in them but here came the
[6:04] Spirit of God in a ceremony that had
[6:06] been carried out for so many years of
[6:08] course it was a noble thing that they
[6:11] were doing and they were doing it in
[6:12] obedience to what God was expecting of
[6:15] his people but here the Lord came with
[6:18] the spirit here's Jesus with the spirit
[6:20] who's thirsty who has a need everything
[6:24] you have need of is standing in the
[6:26] midst of you right now if you'll just
[6:29] come
[6:30] and take a drink so I want to say to you
[6:32] that during this time of the Feast of
[6:35] Tabernacles there swiftly upon us let's
[6:37] come and drink if you can't be with us
[6:40] it can't meeting
[6:41] wherever you are set some time aside
[6:43] during that week to drink of that living
[6:47] water of God let the spirit of
[6:49] revelation and understanding be poured
[6:52] out upon your life let him open up the
[6:54] scriptures to you in such a way that it
[6:57] would it would be so similar to what
[6:59] happened on the road to emmaus when
[7:02] their eyes were open they began to
[7:04] recognize who it was that had spoken to
[7:06] him and they said did not our hearts
[7:09] burn within us as he talked with us by
[7:11] the way I believe that those who gather
[7:14] with us at camp meeting are gonna leave
[7:16] every service with that kind of a praise
[7:20] upon their lips didn't our hearts burn
[7:22] tonight as the Lord spoke to us I'm so
[7:26] thankful friend that our God is still a
[7:29] speaking God and that he uses the
[7:31] fivefold ministry he uses the great
[7:34] revelation of Jesus Christ that we have
[7:36] received a generation ago and he uses
[7:40] the gifts of the Spirit he also uses the
[7:43] atmosphere that's produced when we come
[7:45] together in corporate praise and worship
[7:48] and we're not just going to do that at
[7:50] camp meeting time we try to do that
[7:52] every time we gather in the name of the
[7:54] Lord and I trust that you do as well but
[7:57] I don't want you to miss out on this
[7:59] special season of the Lord I want to
[8:02] just say again wherever you are it's
[8:04] time to come before the Lord with with
[8:06] repentance and and with lots of
[8:08] Thanksgiving to say Lord I'd like a
[8:10] reset in my life I want to come back to
[8:13] the simplicity of my relationship with
[8:16] you what I once had with you perhaps in
[8:20] the beginning when when our hearts were
[8:22] were so excited about the change that
[8:24] the Lord had just carried forth in our
[8:27] life well I want you to know he's still
[8:29] changing his people
[8:31] now in this hour from the inside out his
[8:34] word is purifying us it is burning out
[8:37] the dross he's giving us grace to watch
[8:41] our thoughts to pull them down when we
[8:43] recognize that they're contrary to the
[8:46] word of truth that's been spoken over us
[8:48] it's just the grace of God it seems that
[8:51] we're able in this season to come
[8:54] quicker back to joy when when the enemy
[8:57] would bring stress or trial or hardship
[9:00] in our life it seemed that it would take
[9:02] us so long to get through it maybe a day
[9:05] would be ruined maybe weeks you know we
[9:07] can wallow around and in the things that
[9:10] are going on in our life but it seems
[9:12] like there's even a special grace in
[9:13] this hour to come quickly back to peace
[9:16] to come quickly back to joy because this
[9:20] living God who chose to Tabernacle in
[9:23] the body of our Lord Jesus Christ he has
[9:26] now chosen to tabernacle in you and I if
[9:29] you are born again by the Spirit of God
[9:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and fire then
[9:35] this spirit that lives inside of you in
[9:38] fact this life that lives inside of you
[9:41] is his spirit and it is his life and
[9:45] when we recognize that our life is not
[9:48] our own that the life that we now live
[9:51] is absolutely by the life of Jesus
[9:56] Christ it causes us to want to have more
[9:59] fellowship and more intimacy with him I
[10:02] am convinced that intimacy determines
[10:06] proximity and so the more we draw nigh
[10:09] to him I believe the closer we find
[10:12] fellowship with him and I don't know
[10:15] about you but I want to be the John in
[10:17] my generation the one who presses
[10:20] through to lay my head on the Lord's
[10:23] shoulder and tell him how much I love
[10:25] him and how much I need him in this hour
[10:28] so let's celebrate with great joy the
[10:31] Feast of the Lord and the reality and
[10:35] the fulfillment of what God has done
[10:38] Our Lives God bless you bye-bye
