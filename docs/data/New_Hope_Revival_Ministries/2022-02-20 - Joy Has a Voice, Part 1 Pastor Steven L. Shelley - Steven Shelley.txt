[Music] make me more [Music] like you is that your honest desire and prayer this morning thank god it is if it is you're indeed blessed among those who live in this old world you may be seated this morning it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord and there are those who haven't been with us in a while and we're very very glad to look and see them here this morning it's home so we won't welcome uh folk as visitors when this is their home but it's very nice to see them and that includes sister west who is truly a survivor [Applause] we didn't see her like paul did in her in her weakest moment or sickest moment but i thought she was radiant this morning when she came to my office to greet me and i know that that is the goodness of the lord and her testimony is she was very very sick but god has been so good and so gracious to her and she drove a long way to be in the house of the lord this morning and i'm so thankful to have her here it's a wonderful joy to know that someone has a desire to get up and be in the house of god that is my desire and we are teaching our children that by example we see how things fade out as the years and generations go by if you and i don't value attendance in the house of god our children will value it less than we do our grandchildren if we tarry if jesus tarries and we tarry here they'll value it even less than we have valued it it's a very important thing to remember that we are setting an example for the generations do you believe that we really are god bless you for your faithfulness to the house of god this morning i understand that chad is working again and not here but we will still mention that today is his anniversary and uh because his best half is here and so we want to wish chad and jennifer a happy anniversary today a wedding anniversary [Applause] i know that jennifer still looks young she really still looks radiant and young like she did way back then yes you do quit shaking your head no yes you do and i'm the boss if you don't believe that you just asked nora and uh was it who was it said this morning was it millie or nora told joshua said you listen to brother you listen to pastor he's the boss and you do look young and beautiful this morning and uh the reason why i'm mentioning that is because they're only a couple of years behind my wife and i we were married in 97 and they were married in 99. of course there were a couple of kids when they got married but that's about what about 23 years this year and uh luke is is with his dad but levi's up there and you can see that god has been good to them and ariely is on the end of the pew there you can see god has been good to them so we thank the lord uh a couple of announcements that we would like to make this morning one is i think i have this tuesday night right if i find out that i have mistaken the tuesday night i'll let you know asap but it looks like our brother caleb doron from tucson arizona will be with us on tuesday night march the 15th now all of you that are excited you better be here it's on a tuesday night he won't be with us on the weekend but he is coming to speak at a little church if you want to go up on friday night i'm going to try to go uh i don't know where the church is but it's in the greater atlanta area which can be as a big area hitting it brother carrie i don't know which one of those towns it's in i will find that out for you between now and then but there is a little haitian brother who pastors a little group of message people there in that little town and brother caleb met them in florida and met the pastor at a minister's meeting he invited brother caleb to come and he mentioned to me that he was coming and that he would like to stay a day or two past the sunday and i said well then you come down and speak for us i believe that is tuesday night march the 15th but i will double check that on tuesday night march the 29th we won't particularly have a guest preacher i don't know who will preach but we will have a very very special guest singer and uh she's one of the best and we love her here very very much and she'll be here with her family on tuesday night march the 29th and we're looking forward to having them a few years ago they were here on spring break and we get to be blessed by her song ministry uh again and i believe that's that is tuesday night march the 29th and we will have special meetings here friday night saturday night and sunday morning april 1 2 and 3. one of those days is sister alfreda's birthday is it first or second second um we will be having a special weekend of services with brother daniel miller from uh idaho and his wife sister anna and they minister in both song and in the word and uh he was a real short-winded preacher when he was here the last time uh but i don't expect it to be that way i don't if it is and that the lord moves as mightily as he did then that's all right isn't it but uh when you have somebody pulling on you and amen in you and working with you a little bit well it just uh it can make for an incredible combination and we're going to do that we're we feel like this is an ordained time it feels like an appointment and we were going to do it the last weekend of march and we found out tuesday night that there were some folks who had planned for months to be away that weekend and we can't always do this but something just went right down into the deepest part of me and said this can't be we've got to do something about this so i asked you to pray tuesday night and when i woke up wednesday morning the lord gave me a very clear word don't you wish it could always be that way i wished it could always be direct and clear for somebody like me but he gave a very direct word he spoke to my heart about it being a beginning and not an ending and therefore he was moving it to the beginning of the month instead of the ending of the month and i said but lord the world celebrates april april fool's day on april the 1st i hate to start anything on april i won't even tell you what he said but you know there is a there is a real big fool out there we're not gonna we're not gonna give him any attention but the enemy said he had i mean god said i've got a way of of fooling the enemy and so i don't know what god is going to do but i feel firmly that it's going to be a real visitation from the lord so april 1st 2nd and 3rd we're looking forward to what the lord has three of our children are in dallas this morning attending some special youth meetings there annual youth meetings and i don't know how how everything has been but we began to get texts last night and said that the service was outstanding and and benjamin said daddy uh brother really really preached brother watkins really preached brother jason watkins we heard him preach in tucson just a few weeks ago at the minister's meeting and it was absolutely outstanding and so when we heard that he was going to be the speaker and the kids wanted to go then we wanted to make that possible but i miss i miss them all three this morning i especially miss the son of my right hand because i depend on him but i'm so thankful that joshua is here with us today he wasn't here last week and i tell you he's a real blessing in my life and i'm so thankful to god to have him and he's not just a good driver he's just a good buddy and i appreciate him so much would you stand with me this morning and let's approach the word let's thank god for these musicians i thought about singing but i took my time to talk so god bless you all very much i want to read this morning in psalms 118. i want to begin in verse 1 and i want to read the psalm for you it's not a not the shortest one in the book it's not the longest one either but i want to remind you that you may be sitting for some time unless you choose to stand up and cheer and you're always welcome to give god praise otherwise you may be sitting a little while today i believe the lord is turning this uh subject for us in a in a different direction slightly and and i'm excited about what he might want to say to us today i pray that you'll put in your your whole heart i wanted to say this not to embarrass anybody because brother steve and sister beth rarely are they're usually here ahead of time but this morning they were getting here right as the service was beginning to start the pokes and i wish that everybody could come in like they came in uh i looked and i saw the biggest smile the most beautiful smile sister beth was on your face and i knew you wasn't smiling because you were gonna get to see me now that's worth smiling about too but that is not what it was about i knew that she was listening to that song that ben was singing and the atmosphere was being created and she came in with joy with a smile on her face for another opportunity to enter in and worship the lord and it blessed me it is the fulfillment of what the scripture said enter into his gates with thanksgiving and i'm glad that you can't see your face sometime when you come in but i'm so glad that if we have our mind on getting here to praise the lord we can come in with a smile because god has given us the air in our lungs to be able to come and sing his praises again how many of you don't take that for granted this morning we better not we better not take it for granted because we don't ever know when it's our last opportunity to come in i greet all of you streaming this service i greet old friends here and there i greet sister hannah and her family her dad brother merle is usually streaming from tucson i greet sister hannah and her family her her husband and son who are streaming from from the southern part of norway and so many others god bless every one of you we are so glad to have you join with us today if you put your location in then we know where you're streaming if you don't the way we're doing things now we don't have any way of knowing where you're from but i'm glad god knows your address amen let's read the word o give thanks unto the lord for he is good because his mercy endureth what forever let israel now say that his mercy endureth forever let me ask the saints to say today his mercy endureth forever let them now let the house of aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever let them now that fear the lord say that his mercy endureth forever verse 5 i called upon the lord in distress have you ever done that the lord answered me and he set me he set me in a large place the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me the lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall i see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in men we know that's the truth it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princes all nations compass me about but in the name of the lord will i destroy them they compassed me about yea they compassed me about but in the name of the lord i will destroy them i want you to try to imagine the psalmist singing these words because that's what he was doing they compassed me like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns for in the name of the lord i will destroy them thou hast thrust sore at me that i might fall but the lord helped me the lord is my strength and song and it's become you say it for me my salvation verse 15 is my text the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly the right hand of the lord is exalted the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly i shall not die i shall not die but live this was a hated man this was a hunted down man this was a man who had as many enemies and maybe more than he had friends he had those waiting to assassinate him at various times in his life and yet this is his testimony for you to take home with you today i shall not die but live come on and declare the works of the lord i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord the lord have chastened me sore but he hath not given me over unto death i remember my grandmother getting that from the lord one time when the lord spoke to her and said as from the scripture yea for a small space i have forsaken thee but i will gather thee up again and the lord's doing the lord's doing and here we hear him again the lord hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over unto death aren't you thankful for that open to me the gates of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the lord this gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter i will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner are you with me this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now i beseech thee o lord o lord i beseech thee sin now prosperity blessed be he that cometh in the name of the lord we have blessed you out of the house of the lord god is the lord which hath showed us light bind the sacrifice with cords even unto the horns of the altar thou art my god and i will praise thee thou art my god i will exalt thee and the last verse of psalm 118 oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever just bow your head with me a moment father how we thank you for how you have been with us already in this service your presence has been real your anointing has been in the house you have given us the strength and the grace to lift up your name in praise to be able to worship before your throne and declare your goodness to the children of men you have prepared us now to speak to us from your word i know in my heart that every demon in hell gets nervous as men of god around the world approach this sacred task of feeding your little bride i asked today that you would give us courage to press through all of the enemy's distractions and to declare the word of the lord with boldness and with anointing may our ears be anointed to hear the word of the lord lord anoint my lips to declare the word of the lord and give us grace to be obedient to your word today we ask this in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory and the saint said amen you may be seated i know that was a long reading to have you standing on your feet this morning but i appreciate you reading it with me and i appreciate you entering in as we shared it together and i want to call your attention if you'll help me to do that to verse 15 again it says the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly do you believe that in the complete jewish bible dr david stern's translation of verse 15 and 16 he said the sound of rejoicing and victory is heard in the tents of the righteous adonai's right hand struck powerfully adonize right hand is raised in triumph adonai's right hand struck powerfully how many of you believe that's worth singing about and then you're most familiar with the with the nearly inspired version of verse 15 coming from the new international version this is the lyrics that we sing over and over again shouts of joy and victory resound repeat in the tents of the righteous they echo off the walls of the tents of the righteous have you ever been in that kind of a moment where it seemed like the shouts of praise just echoed and rang through your inner being and through the even the building that you are worshiping in if that doesn't do something for the inside of you maybe you need to pursue a personal experience with the lord i heard our brother talking as he invited our lovely sister to come and sing and play the violin and he spoke about her history and her heritage in my mind i'm sitting there thinking my god how precious that is to know that you have a heritage in the word in the truth and in the message but being a pastor my mind just clicked a little bit and i remembered what the prophet was teaching us it's god doesn't have any grandchildren the question this morning for our little sister and every other person under the sound of my voice it's not what mama has it's not what daddy has it's not what kind of man was grandpa or grandma but the question this morning is do you have a personal experience with the lord jesus christ because when we stand in that great day before that great light we won't be facing anybody's record but our own it won't be our heritage or our inheritance or our pedigree it will be have you been born again by the spirit of jesus christ so my prayer for people precious saints like that dear ones like that my prayer for all of them is may each of you today have your own experience with the lord and carry that heritage forward and you know you got something to go to the enemy and war about you when when you know that that thing has traveled down through the generations you can stand here today and say i claim all of my grandma's prayers all my mom and daddy's prayers i claim the life that you gave them and bless them to live i claim all the benefits and blessings that they pray down upon their children and their grandchildren but you know there's other things we inherit from our forefathers sometimes those things can only be dealt with by the word of god and by the power of the holy spirit you may not feel him but he's here he wants to speak so directly to your heart if you'll surrender your heart and allow him to he wants to cut through all the stuff he wants to cut through all the marshmallow fluff he wants to get right down to the root of the matter because we're living in such a serious time now it's time to know you gotta know you've got to know that you know that you know that you've had an experience with jesus christ i've been trying my children have asked me this week they said dad what is it what is it that causes somebody to do good for a while to hold on for a while to rejoice for a while to stay in the channel of god's spirit for a while and then all of a sudden fall away and fall away and fall away and keep repeating the pattern and you know there is no great answer for that there's no perfect answer for that but i think if we had to boil it down it depends on which voice are you listening to this morning i want to call this subject this morning joy has a voice we preached on the agony of joy we preached last week on joy being not a a a condition but rather a strategic position to face the enemy i want you to know this morning your words are powerful what you say matters what you think matters many of us are living today in the life that we prophesied we're walking in the fulfillment of what our own words prophesied that's what makes this message so powerful because never before did we have an understanding to know that when we take god's word and we live a life of surrender to that word and we begin to speak forth that word that all of heaven begins to move in all directions to bring that word to pass not only do we not necessarily need a prayer line but god has given us the grace and the ability to be able to speak our own victory to be able to speak our own deliverance aren't you glad for that it keeps it from being a one-man show it places the spoken word in the body of christ so that you and i can move by the same victory that's been made affordable to those available to those who speak the truth so i want to i want to just give you this again in the niv shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous the lord's right hand has done mighty things joy has a voice joy has a voice joy has a voice are you going to be with me today what are the sounds and the noises coming from your home what's the neighbor here are you listening what's the neighbor here coming out of your house you know voice is scary you may think all your secrets are secure this morning but somebody knows what you're talking about it gets out it gets on the wind it goes across the water if there's a little pond there it just carries it further and i want to ask you if if i were to ask your neighbors if somebody were to ask my neighbor what would they find out what are the sounds what are the noises that are coming out of our house because the bible says here shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous how many of you know we're not righteous in our own self but we're wearing the righteousness of the lord jesus christ so how many of you live in a righteous tent let me see your hand i live in a righteous tent [Music] amen it's not always peace but we know how to get back to peace it's not always without problem but we know how to press through problems because we know where our victory lies so let me ask you if someone's listening if someone's on your porch if someone's down by the mailbox what are they hearing what are the sounds coming out of your tent maybe they're hearing the loud cheering of this favorite sports team being cheered across the goal line touchdown line you know that line they cross i started to call it a finish line i think that's in a race is that what people are hearing you cheering for auburn tigers are you cheering for road tide or you're cheering for whoever it is playing in the super bowl the super bowl has come and gone those two teams fought together or played together 1-1 i didn't know who was playing before it happened and i can't remember who was playing now that it's happened and i don't even know who won can't remember it's not that i didn't hear it or see it but i don't even remember who won because this is a whole week later i wish you helped me and it doesn't even matter how many of you know it doesn't matter doesn't even matter today who won the super bowl but is that the kind of sounds the shouts the voices that carry out of your tent is it the cheering for your favorite sports team maybe it's the sound of country music worldly secular music written by addicts let's see if anybody help me today i'm on a mission i came with a mission i wonder if it's the sound of some old wino who's singing blaring his love song who cheated who who's being true whose car is parked next door i wonder if it's somebody's old croning voice singing out knock three times on the ceiling if you want me [Music] or you can eat crackers in my bed anytime come on now i wonder if it's some old tune like that that's escaping your house and out your front door and through your open windows into the neighborhood and people know you go to church they know you call yourself a pentecostal they know you've got a different standard than the world around you i'm asking your church this morning i'm asking you streamers is that the kind of music you're listening to and is that what you're broadcasting to the neighborhood if it is you ought not to be because we are what we eat we become what we feast on what we feed on the bible tells us it should be shouts of joy and victory that resound in the tents of the righteous of the lord joy has a voice but so does misery misery has a voice a tear in somebody else's beer has a voice come on these old pop singers that sing today and carry on the way they do vulgar i am i am so offended when i see supposed to be christian people posting on social media how disappointed they are in the halftime show of the super bowl why what is wrong not what is wrong with them what is wrong with you anybody with me what's wrong with you that you're disappointed you should have known what kind of garbage it was going to be before you sat down to put your eyes on it you knew they weren't going to sing amazing grace you knew they weren't going to sing how great thou art you knew they were going to twist and gyrate and their bodies around and show their bodies around you because that's what sells sexuality sells it sells everything it even sells hamburgers it's not just a beer commercial it's not just a cigarette commercial if they still have those or some alcohol they sell car washes with sexuality and you should not be surprised when you sit down and put that evil thing in front of your eyes you shouldn't be shocked at what they do oh i saw a big debate going on i didn't see any of the show but i saw a big debate going on among christian people well i liked it some christians said i liked it because it was oldies it took me back to the 80s it reminded me of what life was like well i want you to know there's only a handful of us in this room that ought to be wanting to go back to what life was in the 80s how many of you wouldn't really want to go back to what your life was like in the 80s let me see your hand i want to know nothing in the 80s calling you back and so the old music that was a theme of that generation why in the world would christian people want to go back to that in the hour we're living in setting all that filth in front of their eyes some country in secular music blaring from the radio and going down the driveway and everybody hearing and listening to that kind of stuff or you pulling on to the campground or into somebody else's yard with your windows down and your old you can jive music playing you ought to be ashamed of yourself that is not what you want to be resounding that is not what you want to be sending out to a world that's lost and going to a devil's hell you need to be sounding some hope i need to be sounding some hope anybody with me maybe that maybe it's the sound of your tv blaring and it's the storyline of your favorite favorite netflix uh uh uh series and you're binging on that and you're watching one episode after another after another after another after another and you've got the windows up or you've got the door open and that sound is going out across the world people doing what people do being entertained by watching the very things that god has told us in his word stay away from that flee from that unrighteousness get away from the filthiness of this world and what do we do we set ourselves down and we put our eyes turn every piece of furniture in the living room toward the the devil's of a box you know turn every piece of furniture right toward it so that when we come in and sit down it's the focus come on now we used to preset but that's not what steals people's conversations in this hour it's the littler tv it's a one week i'm not going to be on this long it's the one we carry around anybody say man 15 people in a room all 15 looking at their screen at the same time then they wonder why we don't have real fellowship then they wonder why we're not one in the body of christ anymore that's why because we let that be what we amplify that's what we send out of our life oh i can't i can't myself i can and you can't either spend all of her time getting caught up i've been praying for canada this week but i haven't been spending all my time watching everything that's going on it pulls me down it'll never help me to think what i need to think and say what i need to say and press toward what i need to press toward i'm sorry the word is making you nervous this morning maybe it's the sound of mother and dad arguing with one another maybe that's what's going out of the window that shifted everybody i told you i don't want to have to tell you again is that what the neighbors would hear if they stepped up on your porch at any given time and you didn't know they were coming come on now would they hear the sound of slamming doors closets slamming and bedroom doors slamming and everybody letting everybody know that they're not happy i'm preaching you just don't recognize it yet but i'm preaching is that the kind of sound that would be coming out of your how because the bible said it's the shout of joy it's a shout of joy and victory that resound in the tents of the righteous not the sounds of arguing and fighting and fussing and fuming and complaining and bellyaching and grumping and gripping and all of these self-fulfilling prophecies that we make over our own lives all that going out of our home no no no maybe it's the sound of mother yelling at her children and maybe they need it but here's the problem with that if you get caught up in that it becomes such a habit and that's the only sound if you train a child to only respond when you yell they will only respond when you yell so that's what you'll be doing for the next 18 20 years is yelling there's got to be a better way you see it's the shouts it's the sound of joy it's the sound of victory it's the sound of celebration that we have been broke out of prison we are no longer a slave to fear we're no longer a slave to sin we're no longer a slave to secular society we've found a new way i have found the way come on that's the kind of sound that needs to be echoing out of our homes and out of our lives i'm gonna give you another chance to say amen or is it the melodies and rhythms of praise and worship music escaping out of your home into the neighborhood telling people oh happy day [Applause] the bills aren't paid but oh happy day [Music] my throat is sore but oh happy day i'm going through some stuff i'm fighting some mind battle but oh happy day shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous of the lord maybe it's the sound of somebody praying maybe somewhere among us is somebody who still prays like an old-timey believer maybe there's somebody here somewhere that prays like like a generation ago prayed or like two generations ago prayed maybe somebody is down by the ottoman down by the footstool calling on the name of the lord maybe somebody's got their face buried in the cushions of a sofa and they're calling on the name of the lord and like daniel they're not ashamed to let the sound of that prayer and that intercession escape the four walls of a trailer or a house or a tent and go out into the neighborhood and make a difference send a message out there into the atmosphere somebody said what if nobody hears it i want you to know somebody hears everything if you don't have a neighbor to send a good message to let the demons in hell know send a message to every imp of hell and let them know there's going to be shouts of joy and victory resounding in this house [Applause] we didn't come here to listen at what the enemy had to say oh let it be the sounds of somebody praying the groans of intercession and supplication as the picture of our voices rises and falls with intensity as we lay our burdens and our petitions before the lord let that be the sound maybe it's the sound of god's prophet preaching at the top of his lungs as he preaches an uncompromised message of truth and revelation let brother branham's voice be heard in your neighborhood because it's not a man's voice [Music] it's the voice of god speaking through a man let that go out don't be ashamed of what you've been well what if he says something is going to offend somebody they're already offended the gospel offends if the good news offends people what will they do when they hear the nitty-gritty of how to serve god won't hurt them let them hear it let that be on your playlist if somebody gets into your car and you didn't know they were getting in there let that be the channel let that be the frequency they hear maybe it's the sound of a of a service an archived service on the new hope app because you just had to go back and hear one little portion of a sermon i know very few people are going to go back and listen to a two-hour sermon that they sat through in the beginning but i know people who do on a weekly basis but maybe the lord is calling you back to one little section that you wanted to hear one more time let that be the sound that resounds in the tense of the righteous of the lord because joy has a voice every other emotion in your life has a voice there's thousands times ten thousands of voices screaming for your attention all the time everybody has got a podcast and everybody wants your attention and they want your ear they want to fill you with their thoughts and with their ideas and there's nothing wrong with wanting to to be involved in some things like that but i want you to know that should never be what drives you your patriot webcast or whatever it is you get so excited about that should never be the driving force in your life that's never going to bring your wife to victory that's never going to bring your children all the way through to the holy ghost come on brother learning those kinds of things even caring for weapons and taking care of things like that it's all good and it has a place just like these sisters may be listening to something for needle craft or cooking or they may be following a recipe there's nothing wrong with any of that but i want you to know none of that is going to bring you to the place where the shouts of joy and victory are resounding in your tent nothing is going to set you up for a breakthrough in your life other than praising and worshiping him and letting the word of god permeate the air and drive demon spirits out i want you to know the word of god being preached in power and demonstration even on an old tape recording has enough power to drive out the very forces of hell we don't drive them out because we listen to things and watch things and invite them in you're the door i said i'm looking for the open door you're the open door somebody said i wish i could just find the open door into my home into my family you're the open door you're the door you're the window you decide what gets into your life and what stays out of your life joy has a voice joy has a voice where are you pressing in now let me see it come on i'm talking to you and i'm not angry i feel like i've got a message to leave with you and i'm going to do it with all that's within me because some of us are listening to other voices and we need to be listening to the voice of joy and we need to be echoing the voice of joy we need to be the the microphone for the voice of joy come on you mean you want us to pretend like nothing's wrong yeah there's a time to do that [Music] it's called faith somebody said i call that phony no no it's not phony it actually takes faith sometime to praise god in the bad times to worship god when everything's going wrong to let that be your testimony you know i'm preaching to you the truth today i woke up this morning and the spirit of the lord began to deal with my heart and i i wrote a section of notes here that i want to share with you that were not in the original plan but god let me dream a dream in the night that caused my mind to go back to this and i just want to leave this to you because the spirit of the lord just real real strongly impressed on me that too many people are listening to a voice of disappointment the bible tells us what hope deferred can do in our lives but i want you to know it can be even more than what we realize and it can be talking to us more than we realize what we're that we're even listening to it we may not even always be able to identify it but i've got news for you today good news and that is there is a voice that knows how to deal with the voice of disappointment there is a voice that knows how to deal with any other voice that's talking in your spirit man disappointed people first of all let me ask you this question because it's a good idea to get a little gage here how many of you have ever been disappointed i'm disappointed when i drink the last iced tea and there's no more disappointment is something we deal with every day i'm disappointed when it's too cold and i'm disappointed when it gets too hot you look up the word disappointment there's something always around us to disappoint us happy comes and happy goes i'm happy one minute and disappointed the next i'm on cloud nine one minute and let down with everybody in my life the next minute anybody ever been there oh yes you have disappointed people have been disappointed by life not just by running out of milk not just by not having ketchup for the french fries there's been other things there's a lot of things that can disappoint us along the way disappointed people have been disappointed by life they've been disappointed by other people they've been disappointed by the church they've been disappointed by god they've been disappointed by themselves often these people wear their feelings on their sleeves because they're so used to being disappointed disappointed they never expect anything else but to be disappointed if you should discover this morning that that uh disappointment has been your lifelong companion there's something needs to be done about it because god doesn't want us carrying that kind of voice around in our head for the rest of our life when there's a stronger voice that can be used that can be yielded to to combat every disappointment that we face i have to talk to myself sometime you ever have to talk to yourself when i realized that benjamin and jenna were going to be married and that it was god's will and that he was setting it up i was excited but i was disappointed it doesn't really matter much but it did to me at the moment i was disappointed that so many people who had been with him from the beginning of his life there were 50 people in the waiting room the day he was born and i was disappointed knowing that the wedding was going to be in dallas and i just got blue about it i just got disappointed about it and i just began to try to figure what i might be able to do well maybe we could have another reception maybe we could have another ceremony maybe we could i don't want people who want to be there i didn't want them to miss it and i wanted it to be honoring to this church to this house not only because of my position here but because of his i got through it i worked through it after all what does it really matter but at the moment it really mattered anybody ever been there really mattered well i spend a lot of time when i get my hair cut and i get my hair cut every two weeks every tuesday i like it to be short i don't like it curling up in the back like a sister i don't like it coming down in my face i like it short it's not always convenient to go but i make an appointment i'm there every two weeks and i spend a lot of my time there giving advice praying witnessing talking i've even had them say we ought to pay you instead of you paying us but this particular day i went in there some months back i went in there and i i was feeling blue benjamin dropped me off that morning he had an errand to run he dropped me off to get my hair cut and i was feeling a little blue about it and i thought you know texas is so far away and there's got to find a house got to find a place to stay you got all these kind of things were in my mind that morning and i sat down in the chair and and my friend said to me she said oh stephen you must be so excited and i said i am that was all i could get out i had let my own personal disappointment overshadow my own personal joy i was joyful i was thankful i am happy but i was also disappointed and she said well you don't look so happy i said you know how we do we get our phone out and turn it around so we can see how we can make ourselves look a little happier i said look i'm doing the best i can you know i wanted to say just cut my hair i didn't come for conversation and here's what she said to me a few minutes you could tell i was just sitting there blue she said stephen she said you're one of the most blessed men that i've ever known in my life you have four amazing children who love you and stacy who love the lord who love the church who love the things of god and your son is going to get married in texas and she said i know that's disappointing to you but she said every time you think about how disappointing it is that they're going to get married in texas remind yourself they're going to be living in your backyard [Applause] [Music] she thought i mean i didn't know brother is your whether to be excited about that or not is that supposed to make me feel better no it made me feel amazing she said see you have to give and take sure it's disappointing because you would like for it to be there where all all of his friends and everybody could be there to help you celebrate but she said the truth is you're not losing your son you don't have to leave him in texas when you leave after the wedding's over he's coming home to serve the lord with you beside you and you gain a daughter well i tell you what i nearly started talking in tongues ashamed of myself embarrassed that i let my disappointment be so heavy that i couldn't celebrate the joy of what the lord was trying we've all been disappointed but i had to talk to myself i had to listen to my hair cutter you sometimes have to talk to yourself you've got to listen to somebody trying to encourage you you've got to take the hand of someone who extends a hand of help who wants to pull you into a higher place you've got to be willing to cooperate with the process to pull you out of having disappointment as a lifetime companion because disappointments will come and go but here's the key we got to make sure they keep going we can't entertain the voices of disappointment in our life we can't compare our family to other people's families or our circumstances to other people's circumstances because if we do you know what the enemy will do he'll pull you farther and farther and farther beneath the waves it can't be the sounds of of despair it can't be the sounds of disappointment it can't be the sounds of wanting to nearly give up that resound in the tents of the righteous joy has a voice victory has a voice overcoming has a voice anybody with me here today you decide who speaks in your house you let somebody come in your house and start disrespecting you you hear sister beth they got to go you let somebody come in there and start attacking you in your own home where you pay the rent you pay the light bill you don't have to put up with that you can send them on their way you're just going somewhere else this is my home i hope we can get this sorted out later but right now i just want you out of here this is my house this is where i live i don't have to do this right now i get to choose when i have this conversation i don't have to have this conversation right now i get to choose you would do that i pray you would i pray you would put the devil on the run if he came there to try to disturb the peace of your life then why in this world do we keep the voice of disappointment as a constant companion in our head and never send him packing why do we put up with that kind of talk from our own head that we would quickly reject if it came from somebody else's voice is anybody listening to me today this appointment wants to be your lifetime lifelong companion when we first begin to recognize that we have kept company with a spirit of disappointment instead of recognizing immediately that it is time to get healthy [Music] you know if you if you're reading something or someone speaks into your life or or you come across a scripture that places some correction or conviction in your heart about something then you just recognize i've got an unhealthy place in my life and i want to give that unhealthy place to the lord this is the area where i need the lord the most and i'm inviting him into my vulnerable spot the room that i've always kept hidden and protected for myself for my own thoughts but i'm willing to open that up now and let the lord come in this needs to be our first response when the spirit of the lord brings conviction into our life we need to be willing to open the door and let him come in and do what he wants to do are you with me but instead of recognizing immediately that it's time to get healthy we may be tempted to make excuses for our state of mind we may be tempted to even blame others for our constant drawing of the short straw it's easy to become a victim in our own minds it's easy to walk forward with a victim mentality setting up scenarios and circumstances and situations that will always make us the victim because a victim mentality attracts victimhood just like rejection attracts rejection and just like the meme that goes around hurt people hurt people it attracts and it will continue to do that until you decide who gets to talk in your head it's powerful it's powerful when we recognize i can shut the voice off [Music] i don't have to listen to any voice contrary to the voice of truth i didn't want to put too much on ben this morning but if we could have i would have left to have sang that song the voice of truth because i can see all those israelites standing there with their knees and knocking because one little giant i say little giant one little giant could have been a hundred giants so when i say little i don't mean little i mean a few one little giant down there in the middle of the valley breathing out his accusations and threats all of the israelites standing on the hill with their knees knocking afraid to face their enemy the enemy saying to every one of them you're defeated your fear will defeat you you'll never be able to do anything and david steps out to start to do what god is anointing him to do and the same voices call out to him boy you'll never win boy you'll never win boy you'll never win you've been disappointed before you'll be disappointed again help me you'll never win you'll never win you'll never win but i want you to know it wasn't the voice of disappointment that got him down there in the valley oh no there was another voice talking to david that day i am with you i will be with you you are not alone there was another voice talking to david that day remember the bear remember the lion remember the other times that i have seen you through [Music] we're talking we're talking about the greatest praiser we're talking about a man that had the biggest heart of worship we're talking about a man who knew how powerful it was to focus on the goodness of god instead of the severity of his problem but here we here he was just a young lad he was under immense pressure and he could have failed he could have fallen he could have broken in the midst of all of that pressure but he chose he made a choice that day i wish you'd make the same choice i wish you'd make the same choice and that is to listen to another voice listen to the voice of truth shut down the voice of disappointment we may be tempted to blame others for our constant drawing of the short straw it's easy to become a victim in our own minds our soulish inner voice starts agreeing with the voice of our disappointment saying see there's something about the voice of disappointment you need to know he needs a companion that voice needs another voice that voice needs an amen that that voice needs somebody to agree like every other demon voice like you heard god's prophet standing there on the platform praying for these people and all of a sudden the demon in a man sitting out in the audience would cry out a demon and a man standing on the platform and those demons would be calling out to one another to strengthen themselves so they could resist brother brandon would just stop the service and deal with that thing right away well i want you to know it really works that way and i want you to know the voice of disappointment that you've been listening to in your life over and over and over again longs for somebody's voice to agree and you know what happens let me tell you something there will always be somebody this world is full of spineless people there will always be somebody to agree with you and your disappointment there will always be somebody to agree with you and your in your in your contemplation in your in your musing in your evaluation of a situation you'll always be able to find somebody who will strengthen you in that and the way spirits work spirits draw people into fellowship with those of the same kind of a spirit and that's why you've got to be careful when you're choosing your personal fellowship that you choose it with someone who has victory where will i ever find somebody like that keep looking keep looking because if you've been listening to the voice of disappointment the last thing you need is two hours with somebody else that listens to the voice of disappointment you don't have to say man misery loves company discouragement loves to listen to other discouraged thoughts it just works that way it is a magnet our soulish inner voice starts agreeing with the voice of our own disappointment saying no one understands no one cares everyone is trying to keep me down nobody wants me to be what i'm really supposed to be it's not hard to see that the voice of disappointment does not like singing alone or if it's going to have power it has to have another voice to agree with it it looks first internally because you've all got an internal self-talk first it looks to see if it can find agreement in you and if that's a little iffy it starts drawing someone into your life who will speak the same kind of thoughts over you or in your presence or in your ear it needs an inner voice to line up with the storyline of constant disappointment there are people even under the sound of my voice who when they look back over their life they don't see victories there have been victories there have been mountaintops but because of a negativity bias it's easier for that kind of a person to see just the times of great disappointment i didn't get the man i didn't get the woman i didn't get the boy i didn't get the girl i didn't get the job nobody bragged on me i was underappreciated come on i say this as humble as i possibly know how to get it across while still having authority this is the enemy's trick and he doesn't care who he uses it on and i'm telling you if this message is right and i don't even like saying if but if this message is right then everything you need to overcome every enemy in your life is already in you by the power of the holy ghost and all you and i have to do is rise up and say no more [Applause] i will not agree with the voice of disappointment but i wanted the skinny wife well be careful what you say cause she wanted the handsome husband i want to die with the hair that i was born with it's all very disappointing i want to lose it so get so far separated from the weight i lose that i never ever ever ever see it again none of these things always turn out the way that we want them or expect them to turn out and the enemy the demons of hell monopolize on disappointment we all have disappointment some of you looked at me funny when i said i'm disappointed when i drink the last of the iced tea but that's a disappointment to me it's not one i particularly need to be delivered from we just need my wife needs to check the picture more often we could solve this problem when it's getting low you just buy another picture but there are real disappointments and i don't want to minimalize real ones by bringing out my little ones but neither do i want to expose myself by bringing out my real ones you understand don't you we all we all get disappointed life gives us things that we didn't see coming i think about every not just one or two i think about every man and wife who dream of getting old together and i think about how so many uh are cheated it seems out of that opportunity and so rapidly and so quickly that there's hardly enough time to say the things that you want to say listen what's happened with covet has happened in such a way that that one minute you could communicate and the next minute they're on a ventilator and there's no communication no ability i mean you stand there talking and hoping but there's no conversation and it's it's it's over and we know that most people that get on it do not come off of it this is what we know by statistics and so it seems to cheat people out of their last conversations and that feels very unfair to me but god is sovereign and he never makes a mistake and what you and i need to do is pray for those who miss that opportunity but we need to do something else we need to make sure that we don't miss that opportunity in our lives that we say today what needs to be said to our loved ones is anybody with me is this off am i off base now and saying this say it today say it today because you may never get the opportunity to say what needs to be said if you need to say i'm sorry bite the bullet and say it i watched a little film the other night with joshua it was just us at home we watched a little film together that he had seen before and i'd never seen and it was about a dad who did quite well in a particular sport but his son came along and was even doing better than he was doing and there was a struggle dads can have a struggle and it was so hard for that dad to say to his son i'm proud of you and there were a few moments where it became so obvious that he had to say it he would have looked like a complete idiot not to say it so on a few rare occasions he was able to squeeze out the words to say i'm proud of what you've accomplished well the young man dies at the age of 25 doing the sport that he loves the dad is sitting in the room weeping stoic guy who seemed to never have any emotion and now he's weeping his wife comes in to put her hand on his shoulder to comfort him a bit and he says i i did i did tell him a time or two on occasion i did tell him that he had done a good job and i was proud of him but he said i'm just sitting here trying to think i've been sitting here for the longest time trying to think because i'm such an emotional watcher i can't watch too many things because i'm sitting there saying oh no oh no i knew the storyline i knew it i knew what was about to happen i knew what he was fixing to say and i said oh no no no no no he said but i realize i cannot remember a single time that i told him i love you he doesn't get another chance only eternity could afford him another opportunity to say that stubborn old man that stubborn old man hung on his own pride afraid to to to feel like a a woman felt like if he showed much emotion he would be like a woman and he missed the opportunity to say the very thing that his son needed to hear the most because he lived every day of those 25 years trying to please his dad to get to a place where his dad would give him approval and then he goes out of here never having the opportunity to hear the words that he needed to hear more than all the attaboys doesn't have to be that way you and i can say what needs to be said while we have an opportunity to say it i wish somebody would help me we can say what needs to be said now while we have breath to say it with because life is going to be filled with more disappointments it's not disappointments that i'm preaching against they come we can't prevent them from coming i'm preaching against listening to the voice of disappointment to the voice that says what if it could have been it should have been it ought to have been but it wasn't that's a voice that'll pull you out of a place where you can hear the voice of god that's a voice that will pull you into a place where your life and your home and your family is filled with confusion and there is no joy there is no voice of joy help me there is no voice of triumph no voice of victory that voice of disappointment it needs my inner voice to line up with the storyline of the constant disappointments of my life it seeks to highlight reference points from my past to confirm in my own head my victimization it seeks to put others in an awkward position of feeling pressured to agree with me in my disappointment this disappointment seeks to fully control our emotions leading to discouragement depression or worse what could possibly be so wrong in a 12 year old's life you saw the news 12 years old already gone hospital dad's head on his chest thank you mom's head on his lifeless body what disappointment could be so severe what curiosity could be so great that would bring a 12 year old to that to that point in his life and the world is full of people hurting just like that when you're disappointed you feel stuck how do you know i know because i've been there and i've wondered what have i done wrong why do i deserve such pain and frustration why are other people excelling while i seem to be standing still if you recognize any of that at all you'll recognize it to be the voice that disappointment talks with in our lives we've learned to temporarily push down the voice of disappointment in order to function in everyday living however there's only one way to confront the voice of disappointment in your mind in your soul and that is to plunge it beneath the blood of jesus christ and make a choice to listen to another voice his voice the voice of truth you give me job chapter eight i need just a few more minutes this morning job chapter 8 verse 20 and 22 let me read it in the amplified and we'll save the time i usually read it in both behold as surely as god will never uphold wrongdoers he will never cast away a blameless man he will yet all the struggles all the disappointments all the hardships in your life he will yet fill your mouth with laughter [Music] can you imagine job listening to this can you imagine job swallowing this idea that one day you will laugh again he didn't want to laugh how many of you have ever been in a place where you did not want to laugh two of you i can call names this morning i can you're tightened up because you know i can and you're afraid i might you don't want to laugh you don't want to smile you don't want anybody to misunderstand your existence you want everybody to know that you are miserable job must have felt that way he lost everything he ever owned all his cattle all his possessions all his children he lost his homes he lost everything that he treasured and one day the word comes to him he will yet fill your mouth with laughter job and your lips with joyful shouting there's some of you who could never believe it you could never believe that how you feel this morning that you could ever be a real praiser again there's some of you who feel so low that you can't see a way out and you can't imagine ever having the joy of laughing in the spirit again but you can you can you must it's not praise the lord anyhow people i i don't like that well praise the lord anyhow i don't like that that's not enough it's praise the lord in spite of i'm going to give god thanks in everything and for all things and i'm going to praise him in spite of not oh i'll praise the lord anyhow no praise the lord his mercy endureth forever come on joy has a voice oh my wished i was a preacher keep praising the lord in spite of everything and joy and victory can be yours again and laughter some of you never really laughed in the spirit somebody said well i don't even believe in life i don't care whether you believe in iran you think anybody in here cares about your theological position on lasterius nobody cares whether you believe in laughing spiritually or not because when god fills your belly with rivers of living water he'll laugh out of you he'll express joy out of you if you give him a voice you've got to yield your mouth you've got to yield your tongue you've got to yield your voice because joy has a voice you've got to yield yourself as an instrument psalm 47 1. oh clap your hands this is amplified oh clap your hands should be right behind it similar oh clap your hands and king james all you peoples shout to god with the void here it is in the amplified oh clap your hands all you peoples shout to god with the voice of triumph in songs of joy you can read the verses before you can read the verses after and it doesn't say anything about conditions or circumstances it doesn't say once you're free from disappointments clap your hands all you people hello hello hello hello it doesn't say once everything's going good for you again shout to god with the voice of triumph and sing great songs of joy no no no it just says oh clap your hands [Applause] you don't think i hear you sometime if he tells me one more time to clap my hands oh clap your hands all you people shout shout shout to god shout to god with a voice of triumph and songs of joy even in your disappointment even in your hope deferred even in all your heartaches not shout because you feel it shout because he's worthy dora is that you is that dora back there dora is that you is that is that dora there who you're lisa you're not i saw lisa i don't know who lisa is but i saw lisa back there waving her hands praising the lord during worship i thought it was somebody else it doesn't matter who she is she's welcome to do that here if i knew lisa i don't know her but if i knew lisa i'd probably find out she's had disappointments if i knew lisa i would probably find out she's had heartaches have you honey she's been through some stuff but you'd have never known it this morning the way she was waving her arm ah [Music] believe i will psalms 30 11 in the amplified says you have turned my morning whoa you have turned my morning 3011. you have turned my morning into dancing for me [Applause] you have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness this is somebody that had mourned this is somebody that had lost this is somebody who had suffered this is somebody who was filled with disappointment and yet now you've turned my morning in the day how many of you know who john calvin was i need a few more minutes thank you john calvin a great leader great theologian but a very disappointing person in certain areas he was a spiritual leader in geneva he tried constantly to control people's outward behavior in the house of god he banned music he banned musical instruments all forms of entertainment he banned gambling drinking dancing and a modest dress i appreciate that but he also banned all outward displays of joy sister joyce he banned bright clothing shoshana jaya's not here but she told me one time i like colors when you talk about sister joyce liking bright colors i like bright colors too well john calvin wouldn't have appreciated that he believed a good christian ought to wear black or navy blue and one man was fined because he smiled at the baptism of his child this is church history think about it there's not much joy in that kind of an atmosphere he had some things right but he had some things wrong because and look folks you have license and liberty to use your voice in this house and some of you still would rather john calvin be your pastor [Applause] and to shout with me he's been too good too good to me when my granny passed away she said i want you all to sing happy songs i want you to sing when the home gates swing open for me because she said by the time you all are singing that the gates will have already opened up and swallowed me into eternity she said i want you to sing lord you've been too good to me lord you've been too good to me first you saved my soul from hell now you made my body well i thank you lord you've been too good to me she had disappointment just like you so many people have lost their shout and they lost their shout because they lost their joy that's what brother branham said you lost your shout because you lost your joy they're so quiet in church they resent being instructed encouraged begged pleaded with to do anything different than that they're caught in a in a grave which is a rut with both ends cut out of it and when there's an opportunity to move in the presence of the lord and see what god will do rarely do some people ever put their big toe in the water john calvin is their pastor isaiah 49 40 verse 9 o zion that bring us good tidings get thee up into the mountain o jerusalem that bring us good tidings lift up thy voice with strength he's prophesying to a people that have been in bondage he's prophesying to a people that have been in slavery he's prophesying to a people that have been in exile anybody listening and yet he said oh scion lift up thy voice with strength too loud lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god you're still with me we're closing psalm 511 amplified but let all those who take refuge and put their trust in you rejoice let them ever sing and shout for joy because you make a covering over them and defend them let those also who love your name be joyful in you read it again brother granny i can see why you would resent this message if it was being given to you by someone that had never had a reason to be sad but because i'm one of you because i live in the same world you live in face the same battles you face i know what pain's like i know what disappointment's like i know what heartache is like but i know one thing giving in to that voice of disappointment will never get you anything but a little cheap sympathy that doesn't go very far when you're already under the water there's only one thing that will ever bring you out of that kind of a place and that is the moment the very minute that you make up your mind i will not agree with this voice of disappointments there's something else in me that has a voice because you make a covering over them and defend them let those also who love your name be joyful any good now give me just a moment christ knocking at the door we're closing don't you just love to worship don't you just love to worship the messages sometimes they're so cutting with the word but then you know after we've all been corrected and stand guiltless in the presence of the father resting upon the grace of the lord jesus i just love to raise my hands and worship him he said don't you like to do that how many believes in that raise up your hands oh my just worship him in song paragraph 268 of patmos vision do you love him you know after the message is cutting and everything i like to hear people get into the hymns and go to worshipping and singing in the spirit there's nothing more prettier than good old singing that's right boy you'd upset some folks in some places if you were to get excited on a song not them overtrained voices that holds till they're squeaking and turn blue in the face and don't know what they're singing i like somebody that maybe couldn't carry a tune in a basket but yet he's got a pentecostal blessing now he's singing about it how glorious those melodious songs of the cross oh my in the message the patmos vision from the church age book he said have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it musicians would you come and help me they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers oh dried up sticks just reading they enter right into the feel of things and become a part of things he didn't seem to be saying there's anything wrong with that if i'm reading it right but oh how they hate the christians for getting into the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship you see in africa where they believe this same message that we do in many places where i have been they have refused to let the american and canadian preachers steal their joy they just worship anyway they just dance anyway they just give god glory anyway i've been preaching in ghana where the crowd was so large there was no way to get the message to the back of the building and out from under the building that it was time to stop worshiping and go forward in the service so they had a big old bell under the platform and when it was time to move on so that everybody could hear even prayer if you don't stop them when they start praying they'll pray on and you've got to move on into service so they'll raise up that bell and sound that bell and it lets everybody out there know we're moving on in the service it's not rebuking them it's saying we have we've accomplished something now we're moving on to something else but if we're not careful white preachers will go over there and try to cause those people to worship like cold dry dead starchy white folks and they'll come around in ministers meetings and they'll say to me well them people don't know any better i'm so glad to tell you that they don't know any better i'm so sorry to say that some of you have learned better because there's nothing any better than getting in the spirit of worship and worshiping the king our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures i believe he means get in the spirit of it don't you both christians and the world are human both have emotions the differences of christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh just one more i know it's late and give out but just one more why it had to be shepherd he said i've seen jumping spells joy spells but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt and i've seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never did see anything disorderly they were always right in order because they had recognized that their name that had been written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world listen the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered a prophet shepherd no matter what the other ecclesiastical realms said about it they knew what had happened just as them shepherds did back there they knowed what took place let's stand to our feet possessing all things brother branham said i wished i had joy brother branham i wished i had joy somebody's talking to him he said you can have it you're just letting satan listen you're just letting satan rob you from the privileges that christ died for i'm an heir to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs to me belongs to you we're his children we're heirs of it everything that he died for listen folks there's not a person under the sound of my voice that hasn't suffered great disappointments in their life and a multitude of small ones along the way you may be disappointed when you get home today and find your lunch all shrunk up in the oven but you have a choice to make in this life as a child of god you can agree with that voice of disappointment and continue to attract those kinds of things into your life until you fall beneath the surface hardly able to get a finger up out of the water or you can make up your mind like i told my children who asked me this week it only takes a made-up mind and we have to keep making it up and making it up and making it up and making it up and making it maybe the old-timers weren't clear enough when they told us you have to make up your mind and choose the lord maybe they needed to tell us that you have to keep choosing and keep choosing and keep choosing and keep choosing because you do every time the voice of disappointment says looky here here we go again you have to choose in that moment to silence that voice and yield to another voice that's within you and let joy have something to say and remember joy is not based on circumstances or condition it's based on a revealed truth something that's been made real to your heart the devil didn't give it to you the devil didn't give it to you and the devil can't take it away lord we love you we love you today hallelujah we love you today jesus we thank you for how you have ministered to us we thank you for the strength that you've given us to hear your word today we thank you lord for calling our attention to the fact that we have often listened to the voice of disappointment instead of choosing your voice the voice of truth letting a little bit of joy push all the darkness out and push all the disappointment out and enter into the spirit of worship lord help us i pray for every person under the sound of my voice who has struggled o god with the voice of disappointment who's lived under the heavy burden of hope deferred and who has not yet broken through the surface to speak words of faith and victory i pray today lord that you will lift them higher that you will pull them stronger that you will encourage them deeper until they are able lord to do what your words said there's a way to get out there's a way to cross over there's a way to overcome there's a way to rise above there's a voice to be listened to there's a voice to yield to it's time lord jesus for us your children to be caught up in the spirit of praise and worship and leave the elements of this old world behind as we enter into a higher place with you in the wonderful name of jesus help us today help us today ben [Music] oh what i would do to have the kind of strength it takes with just a sling and a stone come on surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor wishing they'd have had the strength to stand but the giants calling out my name and they laugh at me reminding me of all the times i've tried [Music] you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story and the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth
