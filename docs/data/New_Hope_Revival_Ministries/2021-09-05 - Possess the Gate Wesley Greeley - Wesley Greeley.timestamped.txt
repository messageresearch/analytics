[43:54] not going to
[43:55] take up the request
[43:58] aloud but we're going to take them
[44:00] before the throne of god we're going to
[44:02] cast them on him
[44:04] because he cares for us
[44:06] we obviously want to thank god for how
[44:08] he's helping
[44:10] pam hendrix
[44:12] she was sitting up
[44:14] there has been improvement
[44:16] we're thankful for that it's been a hard
[44:19] long process
[44:21] and every time
[44:23] i hear them say it's going to be a long
[44:24] recovery
[44:26] i'm just thinking whose report whose
[44:28] report whose report
[44:30] don't you know he can bring her out
[44:32] we don't know the status of the rabbi
[44:34] but we know that god is more than able
[44:36] do you have an urgent need just put up
[44:38] your hand if you know of a need or you
[44:40] have a need we have a lot of people
[44:42] traveling this weekend may god bring

[45:05] you are an on-time god
[45:08] you have everything we need of in your
[45:10] great big bountiful supply
[45:13] and even when the needs get great and
[45:15] the burdens get a little heavy we find
[45:18] that if we can just get to you in faith
[45:21] we can roll it over off of our shoulders
[45:24] owned to you
[45:25] and you said you cared for us and you
[45:28] desired that we would cast it on you
[45:31] we acknowledge that we are weak at times
[45:34] and we are needy
[45:36] but we also decree and declare that we
[45:40] serve a god who is more than enough
[45:43] so lord let our faith be activated today
[45:48] to call those things that are not as
[45:51] though they are
[45:53] as though they were already accomplished

[48:16] hairs left
[48:17] you know since i had that heart attack
[48:19] saw come out and i was trying to fix it
[48:21] and i was standing there in front of the
[48:23] mirror
[48:24] now i just thought about what i was
[48:25] going to tell you
[48:27] but i was standing from the mirror
[48:30] and i said lauren would you please help
[48:31] me get these few hairs up in the back
[48:34] so i get on the church
[48:36] and i got to thinking about it
[48:39] and i apologize to the lord and i said

[48:43] please forgive me
[48:45] because i'm praying that you'll help me

[49:05] what a petty little thing for me to be
[49:07] praying about when i ought to be lifting
[49:09] them up in prayer
[49:10] but this is what i was going to tell you
[49:13] i was

[49:20] yourself say ephesians okay so i'm gonna
[49:22] say ephesians
[49:24] the second chapter
[49:27] and there's a verse in there that i read
[49:29] this morning that really pricked my
[49:30] heart and i wanted to share it with you

[50:09] or if people like the way you smell or
[50:11] not it don't matter
[50:14] tell yourself i am a masterpiece
[50:20] and then when you get through doing that
[50:21] be still and see what god will say to
[50:24] you
[50:25] i'm sorry
[50:28] but if a woman have long hair it is a
[50:31] glory to her
[50:32] for her hair is given her for recovery
[50:35] so if it's a thousand hairs or two or
[50:41] yes
[50:43] right
[50:44] i told garbage junior i said if i get
[50:46] sick going to nursing home i don't care

[1:03:39] you may have your seats today
[1:03:44] we announced that
[1:03:46] we would receive a
[1:03:48] an offering on the principal
[1:03:51] to put on the principle of the mortgage
[1:03:54] of this property
[1:03:56] those of you that have not been here
[1:03:59] i cannot see all of the audience
[1:04:01] you that are here may god bless you all
[1:04:04] of you that are watching this service
[1:04:06] the lord bless you as well
[1:04:08] but we'll give a a quick
[1:04:10] uh
[1:04:13] summary of what we have been doing
[1:04:16] through the years the lord has made us
[1:04:18] promises
[1:04:20] that he would
[1:04:21] give abundance into this
[1:04:24] ministry to do the work of the lord
[1:04:27] that he would send wagon loads in
[1:04:29] abundance in the finance to be able to
[1:04:32] accomplish what the lord has called us
[1:04:34] to do
[1:04:35] prophetic words of of all sorts that the
[1:04:38] lord has
[1:04:39] promised to us and directed us
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:43] one day i was
[1:04:45] driving around the circle
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:49] complaining to the lord
[1:04:54] why lord where is it at
[1:04:56] i see
[1:04:58] these buildings
[1:05:00] they're just sitting idle
[1:05:02] it looks like they're in disrepair and
[1:05:06] needing work and there's no money to do
[1:05:09] it
[1:05:11] i felt like the lord spoke to me and
[1:05:13] said until a concentrated effort is made
[1:05:16] to get rid of the debt
[1:05:18] on this property
[1:05:19] you will not see the abundance or the
[1:05:21] wagon loads
[1:05:23] and so i came i gave that message and
[1:05:26] since then we have been
[1:05:27] uh taking a an offering on the first
[1:05:30] sunday of every month
[1:05:32] the lord has so blessed us thus far with
[1:05:36] one hundred and twenty seven thousand
[1:05:38] four hundred and twenty nine dollars and
[1:05:40] forty eight cents put directly on to the
[1:05:43] principle of this property
[1:05:53] well if you've already put that much on
[1:05:54] the principle how much do you owe
[1:05:57] well i can honestly tell you right at
[1:05:59] this moment i don't know
[1:06:02] but it's a lot it was a lot it still is
[1:06:05] a lot
[1:06:06] but i know the one who is jehovah jireh
[1:06:09] and he is able to provide every last
[1:06:12] penny of it
[1:06:14] last night as i was last night as i was
[1:06:17] uh working uh and and studying
[1:06:21] i was looking for something else and i
[1:06:23] happened to come to a website that uh
[1:06:26] had
[1:06:27] some of john wesley's messages
[1:06:30] uh his outlines on that website
[1:06:34] and the second message
[1:06:36] on
[1:06:37] that particular website was the title
[1:06:40] level was on money
[1:06:44] well this is good let me just take a
[1:06:46] quick glance at his outline
[1:06:48] so here is john wesley's sermon
[1:06:51] in three phrases
[1:06:53] gain all you can
[1:06:56] save all you can
[1:06:59] give all you can
[1:07:01] there's john wesley's message to you
[1:07:03] today so if you brought an offering
[1:07:05] today
[1:07:06] to give on the principle of this payment
[1:07:09] i know that there are some here you
[1:07:10] weren't aware of it that's okay
[1:07:13] god did not call you to
[1:07:16] pay his debts by going into debt don't
[1:07:19] want that
[1:07:20] we want to give according to what we
[1:07:22] have
[1:07:23] and so we're
[1:07:25] lifting our offering to the lord if you
[1:07:27] brought one with you i want you to hold
[1:07:29] it in your hand and i'm going to ask
[1:07:31] god's blessing over that offering and
[1:07:33] ask the lord to let abundance come back
[1:07:35] into your life father
[1:07:37] as we are here today
[1:07:39] and we hold our offering to you i
[1:07:42] believe that there are probably those
[1:07:44] that are on the other end of that camera
[1:07:46] who are also holding their offering in
[1:07:48] their hand so lord we corporately bless
[1:07:51] them in the name of the lord jesus
[1:07:53] christ and we want to thank you lord for
[1:07:56] a a marvelous offering to go against the
[1:07:59] principle of this property lord we want
[1:08:03] to thank you that you are doing the work
[1:08:06] this is not man's work this is your work
[1:08:09] and i want to say thank you lord for the
[1:08:12] blessing that you give to us that we can
[1:08:15] see this
[1:08:16] debt gone and we can
[1:08:18] move forward doing the work that you've
[1:08:20] called us to do
[1:08:22] now god made the people see the

[1:13:42] would you stand to your feet please
[1:13:52] turn with me if you will to genesis
[1:13:54] chapter 22.
[1:14:11] starting in verse one
[1:14:16] it came to pass after these things that
[1:14:18] god did tempt abraham and said unto him
[1:14:21] abraham
[1:14:22] and he said behold
[1:14:24] here i am
[1:14:26] and he said take now thy son that only
[1:14:28] son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[1:14:31] into
[1:14:32] the land of moriah and offer him there
[1:14:34] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[1:14:36] mountains which i will tell thee of
[1:14:39] abraham rose up early in the morning and
[1:14:41] saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:14:42] young men with him and isaac his son
[1:14:45] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[1:14:47] and rose up and went unto the place of
[1:14:49] which god had told him
[1:14:52] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[1:14:54] his eyes and saw the place afar off
[1:14:57] and abraham said unto his young men
[1:14:59] abide ye here with the ass and i and the
[1:15:02] lad will go yonder and worship
[1:15:04] and come again to you
[1:15:07] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:15:09] offering
[1:15:10] laid it upon isaac his son
[1:15:13] took the knife in his hand
[1:15:15] or took the fire in his hand and a knife
[1:15:18] and they both went
[1:15:20] and they went both of them together
[1:15:22] pardon me verse 7 isaac spoke to abraham
[1:15:25] his father and said my father and he
[1:15:28] said here am i my son
[1:15:30] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:15:33] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[1:15:36] offering
[1:15:38] and abraham said my son god will provide
[1:15:42] himself a lamb for a burnt offering
[1:15:45] so they went both of them together
[1:15:48] and they came to the place which god had
[1:15:50] told him of and abraham built an altar
[1:15:52] there and laid the wood in order and
[1:15:54] bound isaac his son and laid him on the
[1:15:56] altar upon the wood
[1:15:58] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:16:00] took the knife to slay his son
[1:16:02] the angel of the lord called unto him
[1:16:04] out of heaven and said abraham abraham
[1:16:07] and he said here am i
[1:16:10] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[1:16:12] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:16:14] for now i know that thou fearest god
[1:16:18] see and thou has not withheld thy son
[1:16:20] thine only son from me
[1:16:23] abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:16:27] behind him a ram caught in the thicket
[1:16:29] by his horns
[1:16:31] abraham went and took the ram and
[1:16:33] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[1:16:35] the stead of his son
[1:16:37] and abraham called the name of that
[1:16:39] place jehovah jireh
[1:16:41] as it is to this day in the mount of the
[1:16:43] lord it shall be seen
[1:16:45] the angel of the lord called unto
[1:16:47] abraham out of heaven the second time
[1:16:49] and he said by myself have i sworn saith
[1:16:53] the lord for because thou has done this
[1:16:56] thing and has not withheld thy son
[1:16:59] thine only son that in blessing i will
[1:17:02] bless thee and in multiplying i will
[1:17:05] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:17:09] heaven
[1:17:10] and as the sand which is upon the
[1:17:12] seashore
[1:17:13] and thy seed shall possess the gates
[1:17:18] or the gate of his enemies
[1:17:21] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[1:17:24] the earth be blessed because thou has
[1:17:27] obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto
[1:17:31] his young men and they rose up and went
[1:17:34] together
[1:17:35] to beersheba
[1:17:37] and abraham dwelt at beersheba
[1:17:41] may we pray before you're seated our
[1:17:44] father
[1:17:45] we want to thank you that you still
[1:17:48] today are jehovah jireh
[1:17:51] and you are still proving yourself that
[1:17:53] you provide for every need that we have
[1:17:57] now lord we want to thank you for the
[1:18:00] grace and strength to be in your house
[1:18:02] today and we are now looking into your
[1:18:05] word and we want you to speak to us
[1:18:08] from your word god and that it would
[1:18:11] penetrate onto the inside and that it
[1:18:15] would become something lord that would
[1:18:17] give us grace and strength to to be able
[1:18:21] to secure the victory in our own lives
[1:18:25] lord you have already secured the
[1:18:27] victory for us but i thank you that we
[1:18:31] can secure the victory because we are in
[1:18:34] christ
[1:18:36] now lord let your plan unfold in this
[1:18:39] service
[1:18:40] we give you glory honor and praise for
[1:18:43] it's in the name of the lord jesus
[1:18:45] christ that we pray
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:49] lord bless you today you may have your
[1:18:51] seat
[1:19:02] verse 16 once again and said by myself
[1:19:06] have i sworn saith the lord because thou
[1:19:09] has done this thing and has not withheld
[1:19:12] thy son thine only son
[1:19:15] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:19:17] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[1:19:21] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[1:19:23] sand which is upon the seashore
[1:19:27] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[1:19:30] his enemies
[1:19:32] and in thy seed shall all of the nations
[1:19:36] of the earth be blessed
[1:19:38] because thou
[1:19:39] hast obeyed my voice
[1:19:42] for those that may not know i would like
[1:19:45] to in us to establish
[1:19:47] in galatians chapter 3
[1:19:51] galatians chapter 3
[1:19:53] verse 16.
[1:19:56] now to abraham and his seed were the
[1:20:00] promises made
[1:20:02] he saith not
[1:20:04] and to seeds
[1:20:06] as of many
[1:20:08] but as of one
[1:20:10] and to thy seed
[1:20:13] which is christ
[1:20:14] verse 29 and if ye be christ's
[1:20:19] then are ye abraham's seed
[1:20:22] and heirs according to the promise
[1:20:26] all right so
[1:20:28] when god gave the promise to abraham
[1:20:33] it was a promise that was given to
[1:20:36] abraham
[1:20:37] for his natural seed but not to the
[1:20:40] natural seed exclusively but he was
[1:20:44] looking forward he was pointing forward
[1:20:48] to the seed of abraham which is christ
[1:20:52] our lord the one who would step out of
[1:20:56] eternity and would step into the realm
[1:20:59] of time
[1:21:00] and would stay he would he would uh come
[1:21:04] to this earth as as all other humans
[1:21:08] come in the womb of a woman but not
[1:21:12] through a sexual act god provided the
[1:21:15] egg and he provided the sperm seed it
[1:21:18] was nothing that man contributed to it
[1:21:22] except for god
[1:21:23] chose a woman to be uh as as brother
[1:21:28] branham called it the incubator
[1:21:30] the the warming of him the place where
[1:21:32] this child could grow
[1:21:35] but but we know
[1:21:37] through teaching from the word of god
[1:21:39] that this this baby had the blood of god
[1:21:44] it was not the blood of a man but it was
[1:21:46] the blood of god in this child and that
[1:21:50] when when god gave abraham the promise
[1:21:54] to the seed he was not talking about
[1:21:57] isaac he wasn't talking about jacob he
[1:22:01] was talking about the royal seed the
[1:22:04] royal seed of abraham
[1:22:07] starting out with jesus christ but we
[1:22:11] the body of jesus christ are a part of
[1:22:14] that royal seed that has been in the
[1:22:17] mind of god from before time ever to
[1:22:20] begin
[1:22:23] i'm a part of that royal seed
[1:22:25] i want you to see that you are a part of
[1:22:28] the royal seed and when god gave the
[1:22:31] promise to abraham it was not just to
[1:22:35] all of abraham's descendants in fact it
[1:22:38] was more to those that would come under
[1:22:42] the headship of the lord jesus christ
[1:22:45] and recognize that he was the lord of
[1:22:48] their lives and he was going to he
[1:22:51] desired to be the ruler and that royal
[1:22:54] seed will allow him to be the ruler
[1:22:58] now in the beginning before there was
[1:23:00] ever time the bible tells us that in the
[1:23:04] beginning
[1:23:05] god created
[1:23:06] the heavens and the earth
[1:23:12] when god created the heavens and the
[1:23:15] earth
[1:23:16] we see that
[1:23:18] the bible puts a period at the end of
[1:23:20] that sentence
[1:23:22] and then
[1:23:23] we don't know what happened in a span of
[1:23:27] time but as verse 2 goes on it says the
[1:23:30] earth was without form and it was void
[1:23:34] and god don't create that way
[1:23:37] god is meticulous so let's back up
[1:23:40] i'm going to say that before
[1:23:42] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:23:45] and the earth
[1:23:46] because of the teaching that we have
[1:23:48] received before the heavens and the
[1:23:51] earth god sat alone
[1:23:55] with his thoughts
[1:23:57] and then as he sat with his thoughts he
[1:24:00] being god there was nothing or no one to
[1:24:04] worship him
[1:24:06] and so as these thoughts are going
[1:24:09] through his mind he begins to think i
[1:24:12] desire to be worshipped because he was
[1:24:16] god
[1:24:17] and so he began to create and and i
[1:24:20] don't know exactly the order of how
[1:24:22] things came but the bible as you read
[1:24:25] through the bible you know that he
[1:24:27] created an angelic host
[1:24:30] and in this angelic host there were
[1:24:34] mighty angels and there were cherubim
[1:24:37] and there were seraphim and all of these
[1:24:40] were created to worship the living god
[1:24:45] as i begin to think about these mighty
[1:24:47] angels the bible tells us about uh
[1:24:52] michael and tells us about gabriel these
[1:24:55] mighty warrior angels that were
[1:24:58] part of this heavenly host and as you
[1:25:01] read through the scripture i begin to
[1:25:04] think that lucifer must have been
[1:25:07] quite a mighty angel and the the
[1:25:09] scripture talks about how that is in his
[1:25:12] body were veals or sultry there was
[1:25:16] something about his body that that
[1:25:18] exuded perhaps music and then and he
[1:25:22] perhaps directed the music in in the
[1:25:25] heavenly realm but he was a mighty angel
[1:25:29] he had a lot of authority in that realm
[1:25:33] and if the word of god holds true
[1:25:36] the gifts and the callings of god are
[1:25:39] without repentance
[1:25:42] and so it once he was cast out of heaven
[1:25:47] and he took with him a third of those
[1:25:50] angels and drew them with him there is
[1:25:53] still gifts and callings in him that he
[1:25:56] is trying to usurp authority on anybody
[1:26:01] that he can usurp authority on
[1:26:04] and and then he has really pointed all
[1:26:08] of his weapons against the bride of
[1:26:11] jesus christ or the royal seed of
[1:26:14] abraham
[1:26:15] because he already knows that at this
[1:26:18] point in history he didn't get jesus
[1:26:24] and he knows that that jesus overcame
[1:26:28] death hell and the grave
[1:26:30] and so now he is pointing his guns at
[1:26:33] the royal seed you and me the bride of
[1:26:36] jesus christ and i want you to know
[1:26:40] today
[1:26:41] that he cannot take you out
[1:26:44] he can't take you out
[1:26:46] he might can bring some defeat he might
[1:26:49] bring some discouragement he might bring
[1:26:52] some down-heartedness in your life but
[1:26:54] he can't take you out
[1:26:58] so whenever you're discouraged you let
[1:27:01] him know you may buff in me but you
[1:27:04] can't take me out
[1:27:06] i am the royal seed of abraham
[1:27:09] so now in this heavenly realm god
[1:27:12] desiring to be worshipped and as the
[1:27:14] bible tells us in genesis chapter 3 that
[1:27:18] the cherubim these great warrior angels
[1:27:21] of some sort they're not little bad
[1:27:24] babies on clouds they're mighty warring
[1:27:27] angels and when the fall happened in the
[1:27:30] garden the bible tells us that these
[1:27:33] cherubim were placed at the gate to
[1:27:36] guard the way
[1:27:41] to the tree of life
[1:27:43] now
[1:27:45] when god placed
[1:27:48] let me not get ahead all right so then
[1:27:50] we also have seraphim
[1:27:52] and we we can read in isaiah how that
[1:27:56] the seraphim the they were six-wing
[1:27:58] creatures they were constantly crying
[1:28:01] holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy
[1:28:05] holy unto the lord and uh i don't know
[1:28:09] the sequence of when it might have
[1:28:11] happened but we can look in the book of
[1:28:13] revelation we can see that these 24
[1:28:16] elders and they were there before the
[1:28:18] throne constantly crying unto the lord
[1:28:21] holy holy holy to the lord there's
[1:28:25] something that god desired he desired to
[1:28:29] be worshipped that god is bigger than a
[1:28:32] human being
[1:28:34] he is so much bigger than our little
[1:28:37] minds could ever comprehend but i'm so
[1:28:40] glad that on the on the other side in
[1:28:43] the ceaseless ages of eternity he's
[1:28:46] going to continue to reveal himself to
[1:28:49] us
[1:28:50] it does not yet appear what i shall be
[1:28:53] but i know when i see him i shall be
[1:28:57] like him
[1:28:59] for i shall see him as he is
[1:29:01] i expect that as i continue this journey
[1:29:06] i am looking more and more and more like
[1:29:09] my papa
[1:29:11] we see that there are people that are
[1:29:14] looking more and more and more like
[1:29:16] their mother every day
[1:29:18] these denominational systems they've
[1:29:21] gone off into balaam's error trying to
[1:29:24] build a kingdom for themselves but the
[1:29:27] bride of jesus christ wants to get right
[1:29:30] up under the right up under the arm of
[1:29:33] the living lord jesus because she knows
[1:29:36] that's where her strength comes from
[1:29:40] i don't have any strength of my own i
[1:29:42] just know my strength comes from him the
[1:29:46] joy of the lord is my strength
[1:29:49] so as all of this has taken place in the
[1:29:51] heavens and we see these angels and then
[1:29:54] the scripture tells us that the the
[1:29:57] earth was without form
[1:29:59] and void
[1:30:00] and we read in the fourth seal brother
[1:30:02] random said i don't know whether there
[1:30:05] was some kind of other civilization
[1:30:07] before this one but but said underneath
[1:30:11] of that water
[1:30:13] underneath of the waters
[1:30:16] there was seed that was already there
[1:30:19] and when god moved the waters
[1:30:22] and the light hit the seed
[1:30:26] the seed had to come
[1:30:28] and bloom forth
[1:30:31] as you listen to brother branham
[1:30:33] preaching about uh
[1:30:35] in the book of revelation and he talked
[1:30:37] about the symbols he said waters
[1:30:39] represents peoples
[1:30:42] and i began to think
[1:30:44] water
[1:30:45] was on top of the seed
[1:30:48] and many times we as human beings
[1:30:52] peoples
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] peoples
[1:30:55] are hindering the light from getting to
[1:30:58] the seed that is inside of me
[1:31:02] and so i have to pull myself aside or
[1:31:06] the holy ghost has to quicken my heart
[1:31:09] to get out from under the waters
[1:31:14] get out from under the waters of the
[1:31:17] peoples that are hindering you
[1:31:21] they're stilting your growth you're
[1:31:23] stunting your growth and so you have to
[1:31:26] get out from under the waters but god he
[1:31:29] he moved the waters aside the seed was
[1:31:32] already there the light hit the seed and
[1:31:35] the seed began to bloom forth
[1:31:40] and as god is unfolding his creation the
[1:31:44] sun and the stars and the moon as the
[1:31:47] lesser light
[1:31:49] and then he
[1:31:51] creates the cattle and he creates the
[1:31:54] birds and the fish of the sea and he and
[1:31:57] he just unfolds all of this creation
[1:32:03] and then the bible says
[1:32:05] let us make man
[1:32:08] in our image
[1:32:14] what did we have
[1:32:17] the trinity
[1:32:18] having a round table discussion
[1:32:21] not at all
[1:32:23] not at all
[1:32:24] what we have
[1:32:26] is god
[1:32:28] with something still locked up inside of
[1:32:30] him
[1:32:31] that still had to be expressed
[1:32:34] and so the bible says that god created
[1:32:38] man
[1:32:38] in his own image
[1:32:40] in his image
[1:32:43] created he them
[1:32:45] now wait a minute
[1:32:47] how do you get them because as you look
[1:32:50] in the scripture there's only one
[1:32:52] and his name was adam
[1:32:56] but there was something locked up inside
[1:32:58] of adam
[1:32:59] that had to be taken out
[1:33:02] when adam was made he was made in the
[1:33:04] image of god the new testament tells us
[1:33:07] the image of god god is a spirit
[1:33:12] so when adam was created adam was
[1:33:14] created as god
[1:33:16] he was created in spirit form and he was
[1:33:19] also created with the masculine and the
[1:33:22] feminine inside of him
[1:33:25] then god saw that he wanted to he wanted
[1:33:29] to do something that was greater than
[1:33:32] letting adam be in spirit form because
[1:33:35] see all of the while this is about the
[1:33:38] royal seat of abraham
[1:33:40] see you go to the book of the revelation
[1:33:43] and you look into chapter five i believe
[1:33:46] and there was no one worthy to open the
[1:33:49] book and and they they cr john said i
[1:33:52] cried i wept because no one was worthy
[1:33:56] and and then we find that it's all of
[1:34:00] the sudden he says don't weave john
[1:34:03] for the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:34:06] prevailed
[1:34:07] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:34:10] thereof then you read further over in
[1:34:12] the book of the revelation and you find
[1:34:14] out that that lamb was slain from before
[1:34:17] the foundation of the world and that
[1:34:19] lamb had a book
[1:34:22] the lamb's book of life and in that
[1:34:24] lamb's book of life i don't know about
[1:34:27] you but i found a revelation in the word
[1:34:29] of god there's something bubbling on the
[1:34:32] inside i have found my name in the
[1:34:36] lamb's book of life
[1:34:39] i have an assurance today
[1:34:42] that i can no more die than god can die
[1:34:46] because i'm of the royal seed of abraham
[1:34:49] and christ jesus lives inside of me
[1:34:52] let this mind be in you
[1:34:56] which was also in christ jesus
[1:35:00] who being in the form of god
[1:35:03] thought in not robbery to be equal with
[1:35:06] god
[1:35:07] oh preacher you're about to blaspheme oh
[1:35:10] no not at all i'm just telling you the
[1:35:13] word that i have found a place in jesus
[1:35:17] christ
[1:35:19] and he instructed me in his word that
[1:35:22] his mind could be in me
[1:35:25] his mind can be in you
[1:35:30] and then he goes on
[1:35:33] let this mind be in you
[1:35:36] which was also in christ jesus
[1:35:41] who
[1:35:44] being in the form of god
[1:35:46] thought it not robbery
[1:35:48] to be
[1:35:50] equal
[1:35:51] with god
[1:35:53] but
[1:35:55] he made himself
[1:35:57] a little lower than the angels
[1:36:00] we'll get there in a minute
[1:36:01] now as
[1:36:04] a adam
[1:36:06] in spirit form with masculine and
[1:36:08] feminine inside of him
[1:36:10] god is still working
[1:36:13] to bring his plan because he wants
[1:36:17] a people see the angels
[1:36:21] the angels that are in that heavenly
[1:36:23] realm
[1:36:24] they didn't tread now lucifer did he
[1:36:27] fell he he's already got a place
[1:36:29] prepared for him the bottomless pit
[1:36:31] that's taken care of but this these
[1:36:33] angels that are there in the heavenlies
[1:36:36] they'd never experienced humanity
[1:36:38] they've never come into this realm and
[1:36:41] god he he had something that he wanted
[1:36:44] to express and it was his desire even
[1:36:47] from before the foundation of the world
[1:36:50] when the lamb was slain and the book was
[1:36:52] written and there was some names there
[1:36:55] mine included
[1:36:57] by god's grace yours as well but in
[1:37:00] those in that book the names
[1:37:03] see this is all a process of god he's
[1:37:08] bringing to pass his thoughts and his
[1:37:10] word and he's bringing it in now into
[1:37:13] the earth he had it he had it in his
[1:37:15] mind but he wanted to express it not
[1:37:18] just as a thought and and not just uh
[1:37:22] something that would roll around in his
[1:37:24] head or not just something that he wrote
[1:37:25] down on paper
[1:37:27] but there was a word that proceeded out
[1:37:30] of his mouth and said let there be
[1:37:34] and this man was created and in him the
[1:37:37] masculine and the feminine and it was
[1:37:40] still in a spirit form but that was not
[1:37:42] the end of god's plan
[1:37:44] god desired to to bring about a human
[1:37:48] race and so there came the time when god
[1:37:52] took some dust from the earth and he he
[1:37:55] created a human being and he breathed
[1:37:58] into his nostrils the breath of life
[1:38:05] the very breath of god
[1:38:08] into his nostrils friend do you realize
[1:38:10] that that is the baptism of the holy
[1:38:12] ghost that is the very breath of god
[1:38:16] into your nostrils into your being into
[1:38:19] your inside the breath of god to bring
[1:38:22] about the purposes of god through your
[1:38:25] life in this end time and so god
[1:38:28] breathes the breath of life into this
[1:38:30] man now he is a human being he is he's
[1:38:34] able to walk and talk and hear and see
[1:38:37] and and in him still is the feminine
[1:38:39] part he is still masculine and feminine
[1:38:45] he would be the only one that i know of
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:49] that might have an identity crisis
[1:38:52] because the masculine and feminine was
[1:38:55] in him
[1:38:56] but because he was so fresh from the
[1:38:59] fingertips of god he did not have an
[1:39:02] identity crisis
[1:39:04] but there came the time that god chose
[1:39:07] to put adam into a deep sleep
[1:39:11] and when he put him into a deep sleep he
[1:39:14] took something out of him the feminine
[1:39:16] part now we have two human beings
[1:39:21] they twain shall be one the bible says
[1:39:25] and as they are in the garden
[1:39:29] i'm i'm always fascinated
[1:39:32] by the fact that
[1:39:34] while the woman was still inside of adam
[1:39:38] god gave him instructions
[1:39:42] the instructions were not after she was
[1:39:45] formed from that rib
[1:39:47] the instructions were before
[1:39:49] but she got the instructions
[1:39:51] she knew them
[1:39:55] now i i preached this before i'll say it
[1:39:58] again
[1:39:59] remember at this point
[1:40:01] they're one name
[1:40:06] i believe it's chapter 5 of genesis says
[1:40:09] and their names were adam
[1:40:14] all right
[1:40:15] so we have these individuals they're put
[1:40:17] in the garden
[1:40:18] remember lucifer has already fallen he's
[1:40:21] taken a third of the angels with him and
[1:40:24] and and i as i began to ponder and think
[1:40:27] about what
[1:40:29] you know the bible does not go into
[1:40:31] great detail about what happened before
[1:40:34] in the beginning and about this angelic
[1:40:37] host and all of these things that go on
[1:40:39] that that went on in the heavenlies
[1:40:41] while god uh unfolded his plan and got
[1:40:44] to the part where the human beings were
[1:40:46] on the earth but there was something
[1:40:48] that happened in that heavenly realm
[1:40:50] that caused
[1:40:52] lucifer to
[1:40:53] the bible tells us isaiah 11 and he
[1:40:56] started talking about i will ascend i
[1:40:58] will do this and i will do that there
[1:41:00] was something that got into lucifer that
[1:41:03] caused him to want to be able to go up
[1:41:06] up up up in a power
[1:41:09] hungry desire to be the top one of all
[1:41:14] of creation he wanted to be the the very
[1:41:18] top the head he
[1:41:20] he had something in him
[1:41:24] did
[1:41:26] while lucifer was
[1:41:28] not rebelling
[1:41:31] these are just questions that started
[1:41:33] going through my mind did lucifer
[1:41:37] know about the lamb's book of life
[1:41:40] somehow i i think he probably did
[1:41:43] i i figured that he
[1:41:45] because of his rank there in the heavens
[1:41:48] he probably knew that that there was
[1:41:51] some discussion there was probably some
[1:41:54] things that maybe god talked about in
[1:41:56] the heavens i don't know but there was
[1:41:59] something in lucifer there was something
[1:42:02] about that old serpent the devil that
[1:42:05] wanted to
[1:42:07] ascend to a place where that he could
[1:42:11] have some kind of dominion over
[1:42:14] something he wanted a dominion and so he
[1:42:18] kept looking for an avenue he kept
[1:42:22] looking for a gate to be able to have
[1:42:25] access
[1:42:26] into something
[1:42:28] somebody's
[1:42:30] son i mean he already drug a third of
[1:42:32] the angels with him out of heaven uh his
[1:42:35] tail swept them out and so is he still
[1:42:38] he's still looking for something to
[1:42:40] possess
[1:42:44] so as
[1:42:45] these
[1:42:47] uh are in the garden
[1:42:49] the bible tells us that it was a
[1:42:51] tranquil place there was peace there and
[1:42:54] and god would come in the cool of the
[1:42:56] evening and he would talk to these these
[1:42:59] uh that he had made with his own hand
[1:43:02] and he would uh just have a lovely time
[1:43:04] of fellowship with them in the cool of
[1:43:06] the evening but all of the while satan
[1:43:10] is looking he's looking for an inroad
[1:43:13] he's looking for a way to get in the
[1:43:16] gate
[1:43:19] and he looks
[1:43:21] and he now sees that this
[1:43:24] individual this woman that has been
[1:43:27] taken out of the side of adam
[1:43:30] from that this man that has been made
[1:43:32] from the very fingertips of god he looks
[1:43:36] and he wonders to himself
[1:43:38] can i
[1:43:40] can i find access through her
[1:43:44] he knew he wasn't going to find access
[1:43:46] through adam i don't know how he knew
[1:43:48] that but he knew it and so he says can i
[1:43:50] find access to earth can i get access to
[1:43:54] this human race that i would be able to
[1:43:57] usurp some authority
[1:44:00] and so as as he's there he
[1:44:03] at this time the bible tells us that the
[1:44:06] serpent was an upright creature it was
[1:44:10] uh
[1:44:11] it was something that was very close to
[1:44:14] the human species and there we have
[1:44:17] indication in the scripture that that
[1:44:20] specie could talk with a voice remember
[1:44:23] the birds they don't talk
[1:44:26] the beasts the fish they don't talk they
[1:44:29] make some sounds and humans have learned
[1:44:32] some of their behaviors but they do not
[1:44:34] talk with a language like the human race
[1:44:37] but apparently the beast which was close
[1:44:41] to the human race yet without a soul the
[1:44:44] beast was able to
[1:44:46] communicate and somehow or another this
[1:44:50] this uh
[1:44:52] this that old devil pressed himself into
[1:44:56] this serpent and began to woo
[1:44:59] the woman
[1:45:01] his intention
[1:45:03] was to get to the seed
[1:45:07] and he was looking for an opening he was
[1:45:10] looking for a gate
[1:45:13] to be able to get the seed
[1:45:17] and so as
[1:45:18] he is uh
[1:45:20] talking to the woman he is seducing her
[1:45:23] he is wooing her and i don't know how
[1:45:27] long it took but somehow this serpent
[1:45:30] was able to make some uh some uh inroads
[1:45:35] into the mind of the woman
[1:45:38] that was the first gate he got through
[1:45:45] it was the gate he got through
[1:45:48] and we won't go through the rest of of
[1:45:51] all of this but we by revelation
[1:45:54] understand that he did not stop with the
[1:45:56] mind because he wanted to pollute the
[1:46:01] seed
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:04] that was his desire from the start to
[1:46:08] pollute and stop the seed
[1:46:11] where he got this information
[1:46:14] i don't know
[1:46:17] but there was something about it
[1:46:19] that he wanted to stop the seed
[1:46:22] see the plan of redemption was already
[1:46:24] in god's mind
[1:46:27] it was already in god's mind and because
[1:46:30] god doesn't work in the realm of time
[1:46:34] hundred years
[1:46:35] thousand years four thousand years six
[1:46:38] thousand years what's 6 000 years in the
[1:46:41] realm of eternity it just doesn't matter
[1:46:44] to him
[1:46:45] the bible tells us in romans chapter 9
[1:46:47] verse 22
[1:46:49] what if god
[1:46:54] what if god
[1:46:57] let me get to it
[1:47:01] 9 22
[1:47:03] what if god
[1:47:04] willing to show his wrath
[1:47:07] and to make his power known
[1:47:10] endured with much long-suffering
[1:47:14] the vessels of wrath
[1:47:16] fitted to destruction and that he might
[1:47:19] make known the riches of his glory on
[1:47:22] the vessels of mercy which he had afford
[1:47:25] prepared
[1:47:26] unto glory
[1:47:30] what if god
[1:47:33] willing to show his wrath see god is
[1:47:36] already he's infinite he doesn't operate
[1:47:40] in the realm of time
[1:47:41] it doesn't matter how much time it takes
[1:47:45] god had a plan that he was going to
[1:47:47] unfold in the earth as he's bringing uh
[1:47:51] the the all of the seed back to life out
[1:47:54] from under the waters and the the light
[1:47:57] of the sun hits that seed and it begins
[1:48:00] to come forth the seed already there
[1:48:04] but that old serpent the devil was
[1:48:07] looking for a way to possess the gate
[1:48:11] because at the gate there's a judicial
[1:48:14] system that goes on it's where people go
[1:48:17] in and out of and in and if you control
[1:48:20] the gate you're controlling the city
[1:48:23] you're controlling what's on the inside
[1:48:26] and the enemy knew that if he could
[1:48:28] possess the gate of the the reigns of
[1:48:31] the mind of the woman that he would have
[1:48:33] inroads into the city
[1:48:37] to be able to stop the seed
[1:48:41] but god adam already figured out
[1:48:43] god the one who created him
[1:48:46] knew this is going to be a vessel to
[1:48:49] destruction this is going to be a vessel
[1:48:52] he's already made his choice as to what
[1:48:54] he wants to be he's he's and i'm going
[1:48:57] to use him
[1:48:59] for my purposes and all of this purpose
[1:49:03] i'm going to unfold throughout the the
[1:49:06] the ages of span of time i'm going to
[1:49:08] unfold it and so god he allows all of
[1:49:11] this to happen and then as as satan
[1:49:14] finds his avenue into the mind of the
[1:49:16] woman and then it goes further than that
[1:49:19] because satan wanted to stop the seed he
[1:49:22] thought he could stop the seed but he'll
[1:49:23] never stop the seed and so
[1:49:26] god in his grace and in his love
[1:49:30] he put the he put the humans he put adam
[1:49:33] and the woman outside of the gate
[1:49:37] of the garden of eden
[1:49:39] the bible tells us that he positioned
[1:49:41] cherubim at the gate
[1:49:44] to protect the way to the tree of life
[1:49:46] to guard it
[1:49:48] lest they
[1:49:50] in their fallen condition
[1:49:53] would get to the tree of life and have
[1:49:56] to live in that miserable fallen state
[1:50:00] for all of eternity
[1:50:03] oh friends
[1:50:04] we think we've got it rough through 70
[1:50:07] or 80 years of life in this fallen
[1:50:09] condition
[1:50:10] but can you just even begin to imagine
[1:50:14] having eternal miserable life
[1:50:19] horrible horrible and so god in his
[1:50:22] mercy put them outside
[1:50:24] of the garden of love of eden and he put
[1:50:27] their cherubim mighty angels and the
[1:50:30] flaming sword to guard the way to the
[1:50:33] tree of life so that they could not get
[1:50:36] access to that tree of life
[1:50:38] in their fallen condition because there
[1:50:41] had to be more that had to be carried
[1:50:43] out in order for the plan of redemption
[1:50:46] the royal seat of abraham to come into
[1:50:48] their position and so we go through the
[1:50:52] scripture and we get to this place where
[1:50:54] abraham uh formerly is named being abram
[1:50:58] he was called out of his land
[1:51:03] he had a wife sir eyes however you wish
[1:51:06] to pronounce her name before god changed
[1:51:08] her name and
[1:51:10] in the process of time she was one of
[1:51:14] she was the one that god chose to be
[1:51:17] with abraham she was a part of the
[1:51:21] predestinated plan of god that the seed
[1:51:24] would come through
[1:51:26] and and
[1:51:28] we read through the scripture that she
[1:51:31] was old and she knew that in her current
[1:51:34] condition she could not bear children
[1:51:37] and and god had already given this
[1:51:40] promise to abram and that he was going
[1:51:42] to have a son and after a while she came
[1:51:46] to him and she said now now abram
[1:51:50] i know that you've been holding on to
[1:51:52] this promise
[1:51:55] you've been holding on to this promise
[1:51:57] for a good many years now and and it
[1:52:00] just doesn't seem like i'm the one and
[1:52:02] so abram i'm offering to you hagar
[1:52:06] my maid
[1:52:08] let's see if god brings that son through
[1:52:11] her
[1:52:13] and so abraham heeds the voice of his
[1:52:15] wife and he goes to hagar and and and
[1:52:18] she conceives and brings forth the wild
[1:52:21] child ishmael
[1:52:23] and in ishmael he grows and
[1:52:27] then
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:28] see friends watch the continuity of
[1:52:31] scripture
[1:52:32] you watch how god puts everything in in
[1:52:35] perfect order
[1:52:37] abram
[1:52:39] he was
[1:52:41] abram
[1:52:42] he went into the handmaid
[1:52:45] and he was uncircumcised
[1:52:48] when ishmael was born through the
[1:52:50] handmaid
[1:52:53] then god comes to abram
[1:52:55] and says abram i'm going to change your
[1:52:58] name
[1:53:00] i am going to breathe i'm coming to you
[1:53:03] as el shaddai
[1:53:05] i'm coming to you as the breasted one
[1:53:09] i'm coming to you as god who can do for
[1:53:13] you
[1:53:14] what you cannot do for yourself
[1:53:17] i am going to breathe into you
[1:53:21] the breath of life
[1:53:24] i'm going to breathe at home
[1:53:27] into you
[1:53:29] and if you look at the hebrew characters
[1:53:31] of the letter god did the same thing in
[1:53:34] abraham
[1:53:35] he did the same thing in sarah
[1:53:39] same exact character in the hebrew
[1:53:42] that god added to their name the breath
[1:53:45] the hay of god into their name and it
[1:53:48] didn't just do it into their name he did
[1:53:50] it into the very essence of who they
[1:53:52] were the being the physical body be and
[1:53:56] and abraham had to
[1:53:58] be circumcised in all of his house
[1:54:00] because god was putting in order
[1:54:04] everything to bring forth the promised
[1:54:07] son
[1:54:08] friends in order for us as the royal
[1:54:12] seed to bring forth the promised
[1:54:15] messiahs
[1:54:16] we have to be circumcised in the heart
[1:54:20] and the ears
[1:54:22] there has to be a circumcision
[1:54:25] in order to bring forth the fullness of
[1:54:28] god almighty into our lives
[1:54:31] so abram came abraham sarai became sarah
[1:54:36] god said i am going to visit you
[1:54:39] according to the time of life brought
[1:54:42] forth isaac
[1:54:44] when isaac was brought forth
[1:54:46] ishmael was still there
[1:54:51] but he was not the promised son
[1:54:55] and as we heard many years ago
[1:54:59] the mistake
[1:55:01] began to mock the miracle
[1:55:05] he began to mock isaac
[1:55:08] and sarah would have none of it
[1:55:10] she said abraham i am not going to put
[1:55:13] up with that you've got to get rid of
[1:55:15] him
[1:55:16] get him out of here
[1:55:18] i am not going to tolerate ishmael
[1:55:21] mocking our son
[1:55:23] and god told abraham put him out
[1:55:28] get him out
[1:55:29] see everything
[1:55:31] that is coming to your life there are
[1:55:34] things that are mocking your miracles
[1:55:37] they're hindering your walk with god
[1:55:40] they're hindering and satan is
[1:55:43] continually looking for access into your
[1:55:46] life he's wanting to possess the gate
[1:55:51] because he knows if he can possess the
[1:55:54] gate
[1:55:56] he can have authority in your life
[1:55:59] he can have some control over you
[1:56:02] he can manipulate you in certain ways
[1:56:05] and so friends the the scripture tells
[1:56:09] us that when abraham took isaac at the
[1:56:12] word of the lord to go to the mountain
[1:56:16] that i'm gonna show you of
[1:56:18] and offer your son
[1:56:22] your only son
[1:56:24] isaac
[1:56:28] now what kind of a wrestling match did
[1:56:30] abraham have with the lord over that
[1:56:33] i don't know i cannot even begin to
[1:56:35] imagine
[1:56:37] but somehow
[1:56:38] because as i look at this more and more
[1:56:40] and more i can see this i can see this
[1:56:44] foreshadowing calvary i can see this
[1:56:47] pointing toward calvary i can see as as
[1:56:50] as as
[1:56:52] isaac is carrying this load of wood on
[1:56:55] his shoulders this this as christ
[1:56:58] carried the cross i can see as as isaac
[1:57:02] now i don't know what age isaac was but
[1:57:06] if he was a teenager or up to maybe 38
[1:57:09] 40 years old i don't know exactly but
[1:57:11] this one thing i know that
[1:57:14] abraham was a hundred and something
[1:57:17] years old at this point however 100 plus
[1:57:20] however old isaac was and i figure that
[1:57:23] abram was probably losing some of his
[1:57:26] strength again i don't really know don't
[1:57:29] don't throw stones at me but somehow i
[1:57:32] think that isaac could have overpowered
[1:57:35] his father
[1:57:39] but as the lamb led to the slaughter as
[1:57:41] christ went to calvary he knew where he
[1:57:44] was going and he went willingly
[1:57:47] and i believe that this is the same kind
[1:57:50] of scenario here as isaac is carrying
[1:57:52] the wood on his shoulders and he's going
[1:57:55] toward this uh place that god had showed
[1:57:58] abraham of and they build the altar and
[1:58:01] isaac he just
[1:58:02] i see the altar and i got the wood
[1:58:05] where's the sacrifice and god comes back
[1:58:09] or abraham comes back he is jehovah
[1:58:12] jireh he is god that will provide for
[1:58:16] himself a lamb he's going to provide for
[1:58:19] himself a ram he is going to provide for
[1:58:22] him it's pointing forward
[1:58:26] and as
[1:58:27] he
[1:58:29] gets on that altar willingly i'm going
[1:58:31] to say
[1:58:32] willingly and abraham begins to prepare
[1:58:37] with this knife and he lifts his hand
[1:58:40] and the voice comes and said
[1:58:42] abraham
[1:58:44] i see that you are really you are really
[1:58:48] the one you you're you're after my heart
[1:58:51] and i recognize that you're willing to
[1:58:54] do this and and i'm going to i'm going
[1:58:58] to say he's free
[1:59:01] don't do any harm to him
[1:59:04] and abraham found this ram god had
[1:59:07] provided this ram in the thicket and
[1:59:09] then god says
[1:59:11] by myself i have sworn
[1:59:14] saith the lord because you have done
[1:59:16] this and you've not withheld your son
[1:59:18] your only son that in blessing i'll
[1:59:20] bless thee and in multiply and i will
[1:59:23] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:59:25] heaven as the
[1:59:27] sand which is upon the seashore and thy
[1:59:30] seed
[1:59:31] shall possess
[1:59:33] the gate
[1:59:35] of his enemy
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:37] now we already discussed the garden and
[1:59:41] now we see here that god has brought
[1:59:44] abraham to this point and given him a
[1:59:47] promise that this thy seed shall possess
[1:59:52] the gate of his enemies and in thy seed
[1:59:55] shall all of the nations of the earth be
[1:59:58] blessed because thou hast obeyed my
[2:00:00] voice now again this is not the natural
[2:00:04] seed this is christ the spiritual seed
[2:00:07] the seed of abraham this is the royal
[2:00:10] seed in thy seed shall all of the
[2:00:13] nations be blessed
[2:00:15] now again god
[2:00:17] does not operate
[2:00:20] solely in the realm of time
[2:00:22] and
[2:00:24] if he desired to take a long span of
[2:00:27] time
[2:00:28] he is carrying out the plan that was in
[2:00:31] his mind from before the foundation of
[2:00:34] the world
[2:00:37] now if
[2:00:38] in my 51 years
[2:00:41] i look at all of you
[2:00:44] and i try to
[2:00:46] intricately
[2:00:47] on paper
[2:00:49] put all of our lives together everything
[2:00:51] that you'll do everything that your
[2:00:53] neighbor will do everything that i'll do
[2:00:55] and try to mesh that all together and
[2:00:57] make it work
[2:01:04] i have trouble
[2:01:06] with just this one
[2:01:10] i can't do it
[2:01:12] but god saw down through the ages
[2:01:16] and he put everything in his divine
[2:01:18] order
[2:01:20] and it looks like that when god gave the
[2:01:22] promise
[2:01:23] to abraham
[2:01:25] it looks like
[2:01:26] that things would been settled
[2:01:31] just settled
[2:01:32] they were
[2:01:34] they were settled in the mind of god
[2:01:37] but there were some people that had to
[2:01:39] carry out their part
[2:01:43] hundreds of years of
[2:01:46] history of humanity
[2:01:49] having highs and having lows
[2:01:52] years of history of of of davids and
[2:01:56] solomons with all of their women and all
[2:01:59] of their
[2:02:00] good times and all of their mistakes
[2:02:03] hundreds of years of god dealing with
[2:02:06] the nation of israel and taking them
[2:02:08] into captivity and letting pharaoh beat
[2:02:12] on their heads for a while
[2:02:15] and all through that age
[2:02:18] all through those ages
[2:02:20] there was still
[2:02:22] that old serpent the devil who was
[2:02:26] looking to find a way to get control of
[2:02:30] the gate so he could get control of the
[2:02:33] seed because he was still trying to
[2:02:37] usurp his authority on humanity he has
[2:02:42] never quit trying to usurp his thoughts
[2:02:46] on humanity and he's still doing it
[2:02:49] today
[2:02:53] he's after you
[2:02:55] he's after me
[2:02:58] but i have the victory
[2:03:00] you have the victory
[2:03:02] here's the problem that we have
[2:03:06] we don't
[2:03:07] keep possession
[2:03:10] of the gate
[2:03:14] we've had seasons in our life
[2:03:16] where
[2:03:17] somebody would call come along and
[2:03:19] they'd preach about possessing the gate
[2:03:22] and we would get a hold of things and we
[2:03:24] would take possession of the gate again
[2:03:27] and then as time went along
[2:03:29] satan all the time looking for an inroad
[2:03:31] he's looking for a way to get control
[2:03:35] and so he keeps at you
[2:03:38] i i refer you again to the garden of
[2:03:41] eden the bible doesn't tell us how long
[2:03:44] that the that satan worked through that
[2:03:47] serpent to speak to eve to try to get
[2:03:50] control of her mind until that she
[2:03:53] doubted the word of god
[2:03:56] because when you are in the presence of
[2:03:59] the living god
[2:04:00] the more you stay in the presence of the
[2:04:03] living god the more you uh
[2:04:07] the more that you get absorbed in the
[2:04:10] scripture
[2:04:11] the more you get absorbed into the
[2:04:14] message of the hour the more that your
[2:04:17] mind is absorbed than that
[2:04:20] you are not giving attention to the
[2:04:23] devil
[2:04:27] like to tell you young people something
[2:04:30] and older people too
[2:04:32] get in those messages
[2:04:35] hear the voice
[2:04:37] that god gave in the end time
[2:04:40] to speak to the bride of jesus christ
[2:04:44] hear them
[2:04:45] they're accessible in many variety of
[2:04:48] ways they're available on our app
[2:04:50] they're available on the voice of god
[2:04:52] website they're available for you you
[2:04:55] don't have to have a big stack of tapes
[2:04:57] on the wall anymore it's easy to get
[2:04:59] access to it and i tell you there's
[2:05:03] something in that message of truth that
[2:05:06] you need to hear
[2:05:09] somewhere along the way
[2:05:11] the enemy
[2:05:12] gained access through a gate
[2:05:15] and deceived some of you young people
[2:05:19] and some of the older people too into
[2:05:22] thinking it was no longer necessary to
[2:05:24] listen to those messages
[2:05:25] but i'm coming to you today to tell you
[2:05:29] it is necessary for you to hear those
[2:05:32] messages to get a hold of what god is
[2:05:36] speaking to us in the end time because
[2:05:39] that message is more relevant in 2021
[2:05:43] than it was when it was preached in the
[2:05:45] 50s and the 60s it is more relevant to
[2:05:48] the bride and as we
[2:05:51] keep the devil from gaining access into
[2:05:54] our minds
[2:05:55] the word will open up and become plainer
[2:05:59] and plainer and plainer to us
[2:06:03] hear them
[2:06:05] absorb them
[2:06:06] get in the scripture
[2:06:08] do as brother branham said to do and
[2:06:12] everything that he said lay it in the
[2:06:14] scripture
[2:06:17] i would advise you
[2:06:19] i would advise you
[2:06:21] as you're listening
[2:06:22] if you can't put it in the scripture
[2:06:24] don't throw it in the trash
[2:06:26] you lay it aside
[2:06:28] because i'm finding as i will go through
[2:06:31] this journey with the lord there are
[2:06:33] things that i would have said no way
[2:06:35] years ago
[2:06:36] but as god unfolds himself and you allow
[2:06:40] the holy spirit to have access and
[2:06:43] letting letting this mind be in you
[2:06:46] which was also in christ jesus i'm going
[2:06:48] to tell you can i
[2:06:50] 30 years ago if you would have tried to
[2:06:53] preach to me let this mind be in you
[2:06:55] which was also in christ jesus who being
[2:06:57] in the form of god thought and not
[2:06:58] robert to be equal with god if you to
[2:07:01] try to preach that to me and that that
[2:07:02] was going to be in the bride in the end
[2:07:04] time i'd have said you're way overboard
[2:07:10] but as god unfolds himself i realize
[2:07:13] that i've got i've got to become more
[2:07:14] and more and more and more and more and
[2:07:16] more and more and more like jesus christ
[2:07:19] in order for me to be raptured out of
[2:07:21] here i've got to have the mind of christ
[2:07:24] in order for me to have the resurrection
[2:07:26] power
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:29] so true
[2:07:31] if jesus would have come to this earth
[2:07:33] and he'd had a mind like most of us have
[2:07:35] had
[2:07:40] and he'd have been put on the cross
[2:07:42] fighting all the way as he went
[2:07:45] struggling and saying god why are you
[2:07:47] doing this to me
[2:07:49] then all of a sudden he's dead
[2:07:51] and there's no resurrection power in him
[2:07:54] because he never stepped up to the place
[2:07:56] where that he
[2:07:58] who being in the form of god thought it
[2:08:00] not robbery to be equal with god the
[2:08:02] resurrection life of jesus christ the
[2:08:04] resurrection power of the living god was
[2:08:07] in him so that when he was on the cross
[2:08:10] and i was on his mind and then he died
[2:08:13] and he was put in that tomb
[2:08:15] there was resurrection life there
[2:08:18] because he came into the fullness of
[2:08:22] everything that he was supposed to be
[2:08:24] and because that you and i are the royal
[2:08:27] seed of abraham we are the ones who are
[2:08:30] supposed to be coming into the full
[2:08:33] maturity of the believer yes sir
[2:08:38] friends all of that history that we can
[2:08:41] read in the scripture and see we can we
[2:08:44] can see the noah and all of the people
[2:08:47] that surrounded him there was rebellion
[2:08:49] of every sort and god said all right
[2:08:51] noah you go into the ark you you preach
[2:08:54] to him you've done what you're supposed
[2:08:56] to now go into that ark and i'm gonna
[2:08:58] save you and your house you're the ones
[2:09:01] that are in that ark i'm gonna save you
[2:09:03] and then they went above all of the
[2:09:05] destruction that was when they come out
[2:09:08] of the ark that wasn't the end of it
[2:09:10] satan was still there looking for a mind
[2:09:13] to inhabit then we had a tower of babel
[2:09:16] satan's still looking trying to find his
[2:09:18] power he's trying to gain access
[2:09:21] authority possess the gate of the minds
[2:09:24] of the people
[2:09:26] we go down through the ages and we see
[2:09:28] how that satan was still trying to get
[2:09:31] access into the minds of the people and
[2:09:34] we see through history there were people
[2:09:37] who overcame in the age that they were
[2:09:39] put because they kept access they kept
[2:09:42] the gate under security they kept satan
[2:09:47] from accessing their mind and they lived
[2:09:50] out their part of what they were
[2:09:51] supposed to live out there were others
[2:09:54] who
[2:09:56] they let satan have full access full
[2:09:59] authority we see where that they ended
[2:10:01] up they they ended up in destruction
[2:10:03] friends
[2:10:06] perhaps we don't preach on it a whole
[2:10:08] lot
[2:10:09] in
[2:10:11] right now i don't i don't know how god's
[2:10:13] seasons and timings work exactly and
[2:10:16] maybe we don't preach about hell a whole
[2:10:18] lot but i want you to know there is a
[2:10:20] hail
[2:10:24] and as i heard a preacher recently say
[2:10:27] hell was not created for human beings
[2:10:31] hell was created for the devil and his
[2:10:33] angels
[2:10:34] but there are human beings who have
[2:10:37] allowed satan to so grab a hold of their
[2:10:39] mind and so absorb them and their life
[2:10:42] that they're going there when god is
[2:10:45] finished with all of this time element
[2:10:47] and we go back into theophany bodies and
[2:10:50] into glorified bodies then
[2:10:53] satan will be loosed for a thousand
[2:10:55] years and then he is going to be cast
[2:10:57] into that bottomless pit and we're not
[2:11:00] going to have to deal with him anymore
[2:11:01] and there are people that are going to
[2:11:03] go there with him
[2:11:04] but it wasn't he god did not create you
[2:11:07] to go to hell
[2:11:08] god created you he wanted you to be the
[2:11:11] royal seed of abraham he wanted you to
[2:11:14] be in christ and he made a way for you
[2:11:18] to keep access to keep the way to
[2:11:20] possess the gate of your mind he made a
[2:11:24] way for you to possess the gate into
[2:11:28] your soul into your spirit he made a way
[2:11:31] for you to possess it
[2:11:34] how can i possess it
[2:11:36] most of you already know
[2:11:38] but i want to tell you the first thing
[2:11:40] that you've got to do is to repent
[2:11:44] the first step toward allowing the holy
[2:11:47] spirit to work in you is to repent to
[2:11:50] come see there's intellectual knowledge
[2:11:53] somebody may come to you and say you
[2:11:56] must be born again well what's that mean
[2:11:58] that means you've got to be born from
[2:12:00] above well what does that mean that
[2:12:02] means that you can no longer be yourself
[2:12:05] you can no longer operate uh with your
[2:12:09] own mind and your own thinking you have
[2:12:12] got to come under the headship the
[2:12:15] leadership of the lord jesus christ the
[2:12:18] one who died at calvary and shed his
[2:12:21] blood that i could have eternal life
[2:12:25] now all of the while
[2:12:27] that
[2:12:29] god is pricking your heart
[2:12:32] and saying to you you must be born again
[2:12:36] there's another spirit there that is
[2:12:38] trying to get access he's trying to get
[2:12:41] to the gate and he's trying to usurp the
[2:12:44] gate because he doesn't want you to
[2:12:48] understand about being born again and he
[2:12:51] doesn't want you to say those words to
[2:12:54] the lord i surrender
[2:12:57] he doesn't want that
[2:12:59] satan wants to control the gate
[2:13:02] but the royal seed will possess
[2:13:05] the gate
[2:13:07] of his enemy
[2:13:13] how can i possess the gate of my enemy
[2:13:16] it's easy
[2:13:18] christ already did it
[2:13:22] see how simple that was
[2:13:24] christ already did it
[2:13:25] jesus christ
[2:13:27] the royal seed
[2:13:29] he already possessed the gate of his
[2:13:33] enemies
[2:13:34] every one of them there is not one gate
[2:13:38] of the enemy or enemies however you wish
[2:13:41] to say it however many demon spirits
[2:13:44] there are there is not one of them today
[2:13:48] that has not been conquered by the lord
[2:13:51] jesus christ
[2:13:52] when he was on calvary and he had me on
[2:13:55] his mind he had me inside of him and i
[2:13:59] was released from his side so that the
[2:14:02] bride could come to into her position
[2:14:04] and then he descended into the lower
[2:14:07] parts of the earth the bible said that
[2:14:09] he ascended but before he ascended he
[2:14:11] descended into the lower parts of the
[2:14:14] earth he led captivity captive gave
[2:14:16] gifts unto men there was something that
[2:14:19] happened down there he took the keys of
[2:14:22] death hell and the
[2:14:24] grave he possessed the gate of his enemy
[2:14:30] death
[2:14:32] hell
[2:14:32] the grave
[2:14:34] because jesus christ the royal seed has
[2:14:37] already possessed
[2:14:40] hell
[2:14:42] got the key
[2:14:44] got the key i got the key to the gate
[2:14:47] of hell
[2:14:48] so now i have paid the price i shed my
[2:14:51] blood i have the key to that gate
[2:14:55] you don't have to go to hell
[2:15:01] the grave
[2:15:02] i got the key to the grave
[2:15:04] the grave is scary
[2:15:07] come down to the end of your life if you
[2:15:09] should go by the way of the grave that
[2:15:11] the grave
[2:15:12] may be scary it may because of the
[2:15:15] unknown the the thought about crossing
[2:15:18] chili jordan and not knowing what you're
[2:15:20] going to encounter and maybe scary i got
[2:15:23] the key
[2:15:24] i got the key to the grave you don't
[2:15:26] have to be scared about it i got the key
[2:15:29] to that gate too
[2:15:31] and and
[2:15:32] death hell and the grave
[2:15:35] death you don't have to be concerned
[2:15:37] about it
[2:15:38] you don't have to be concerned about
[2:15:39] death i got the key to it too
[2:15:42] uh
[2:15:43] see
[2:15:45] satan came
[2:15:47] the thief
[2:15:48] comes
[2:15:49] to kill
[2:15:51] steal
[2:15:52] and destroy
[2:15:54] that's his goal
[2:15:55] death hell in the grave
[2:15:57] that's his goal
[2:15:59] is to put you in a grave make you think
[2:16:01] you're going to hell that there's no
[2:16:03] hope for you and that the grave and
[2:16:06] death is the end of it you're finished
[2:16:09] but jesus comes along and says
[2:16:12] i got the key to the gate
[2:16:14] it's in my hand
[2:16:16] and i i
[2:16:19] i've got this key
[2:16:20] and somewhere along the way peter got a
[2:16:22] revelation
[2:16:23] and he's they they begin to he begins to
[2:16:26] ask them who demands say that i the son
[2:16:28] of man am
[2:16:29] some say elijah some say you're one of
[2:16:32] the prophets jesus says but who do you
[2:16:35] say that i am and peter says thou art
[2:16:38] the christ the son of the living god
[2:16:42] jesus says upon this rock i'm gonna
[2:16:46] build my church not peter
[2:16:49] not a church but upon a revelation
[2:16:54] and upon this revelation the gates of
[2:16:56] hell can never prevail against that
[2:16:59] revelation
[2:17:00] so you as the bride of jesus christ and
[2:17:03] as the royal seed if you can ever get
[2:17:05] that revelation
[2:17:08] thou art the christ
[2:17:12] but the revelation doesn't stop there
[2:17:15] let this mind be in you which was also
[2:17:17] in christ jesus
[2:17:20] who being in the form of god thought and
[2:17:21] not robbery to be equal with god now
[2:17:23] wait just a minute preacher you're going
[2:17:25] a little bit far now hold on here just a
[2:17:27] minute because when peter got that
[2:17:29] revelation
[2:17:30] and jesus said upon this rock i'll build
[2:17:33] my church and the gates of hell shall
[2:17:36] not prevail against it
[2:17:38] do you know what jesus said to them
[2:17:44] don't tell anybody about this revelation
[2:17:47] don't tell anybody what i've just told
[2:17:50] you
[2:17:52] now why would he say that
[2:17:55] it wasn't necessary
[2:17:57] because it was going to unfold
[2:18:00] it was going to become very evident
[2:18:03] as jesus continued his journey to the
[2:18:06] cross and into the grave into that into
[2:18:08] that stone grave and he come up out of
[2:18:11] that grave and then he poured the holy
[2:18:13] spirit on the believers in the upper
[2:18:15] room it became very evident
[2:18:19] who he was
[2:18:21] it did not have to be written down on
[2:18:22] paper it did not have to be broadcast by
[2:18:25] human voices it became very evident who
[2:18:28] he was and friends as you the royal seat
[2:18:31] of abraham you take full possession of
[2:18:34] the gates death hell and the grave the
[2:18:36] keys of the kingdom as you take full
[2:18:39] possession of the gates of your mind you
[2:18:43] are not going to have to tell anybody
[2:18:46] i don't have to broadcast
[2:18:48] that i have the mind of christ
[2:18:52] i don't have to get on a radio or a tv
[2:18:54] station and say friends the bible tells
[2:18:58] me that i can have the mind of christ i
[2:19:01] don't have to broadcast that all i have
[2:19:03] to do is be
[2:19:06] letting his mind be in me and unfold
[2:19:10] what he wants to unfold through me
[2:19:12] through you keeping control of the gate
[2:19:17] thy seed
[2:19:19] as the musicians come
[2:19:21] thy seed
[2:19:24] shall possess the gate
[2:19:27] of her enemy of his enemies
[2:19:30] that includes you the royal seed you
[2:19:33] don't have to back down to the devil and
[2:19:36] cower to him and tell you you know you
[2:19:39] don't you don't have to
[2:19:46] you don't have to allow the enemy
[2:19:48] to put the wrong seat in you
[2:19:52] he's after that
[2:19:53] he's desiring to do that
[2:19:56] but friends the victory has already been
[2:19:58] accomplished for us
[2:20:00] it is already been accomplished for us
[2:20:04] i would like to read this since sister
[2:20:06] flo stood right here and she said i'm a
[2:20:08] masterpiece
[2:20:10] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 you at the
[2:20:13] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[2:20:15] and sins wherein in times past you
[2:20:18] walked according to the course of this
[2:20:20] world according to the prince of the
[2:20:22] power of the air the spirit that now
[2:20:24] worketh in the children of disobedience
[2:20:27] among whom also we had our conversation
[2:20:30] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[2:20:33] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[2:20:36] and of the mind and were by nature the
[2:20:39] children of wrath even as others but god
[2:20:43] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[2:20:47] wherewith he loved us
[2:20:49] even when we were dead in sins
[2:20:52] hath quickened us together with christ
[2:20:55] by grace you are saved
[2:20:58] and has raised us up together and made
[2:21:01] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[2:21:04] christ jesus remembering tuesday night
[2:21:08] when brother shelley preached to us
[2:21:10] about our address that in the ages to
[2:21:13] come
[2:21:15] he might show
[2:21:16] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[2:21:19] his kindness toward us through christ
[2:21:22] jesus for by grace
[2:21:24] are you saved through faith and that not
[2:21:27] of yourselves it is the gift of god not
[2:21:30] of works lest any man should boast
[2:21:37] was this your verse sister flo
[2:21:39] for we
[2:21:41] are his workmanship
[2:21:43] created in christ jesus unto good works
[2:21:47] which god hath before ordained that we
[2:21:50] should walk in them wherefore remember
[2:21:54] that you being in time past gentiles in
[2:21:56] the flesh who are called uncircumcision
[2:21:59] by that which is called the circumcision
[2:22:02] in the flesh made by hands that at that
[2:22:04] time you were without christ being
[2:22:07] aliens from the commonwealth of israel
[2:22:09] and strangers from the covenant of
[2:22:11] promise having no hope and without god
[2:22:14] in the world but now in christ jesus
[2:22:18] ye who were sometimes far off are made
[2:22:22] nigh by the blood of christ
[2:22:25] for he is our peace
[2:22:27] who has made both one and has broken
[2:22:30] down the middle wall of partition
[2:22:33] between us
[2:22:36] having abolished
[2:22:38] in his flesh
[2:22:41] the enmity
[2:22:43] even the law of commandments contained
[2:22:46] in ordinances to for to make him himself
[2:22:49] of twain
[2:22:50] one new man
[2:22:52] so making peace and that he might
[2:22:54] reconcile both unto god in one body by
[2:22:57] the cross
[2:22:58] having slain the enmity
[2:23:03] remember
[2:23:04] god told
[2:23:07] the serpent i'm gonna put enmity between
[2:23:10] your seed
[2:23:12] and her seed
[2:23:15] hostility
[2:23:17] hatred i'm gonna put enmity
[2:23:20] but god slayed the enmity thereby
[2:23:23] through the cross
[2:23:24] came and preached peace to you which
[2:23:26] were afar off unto them that were nigh
[2:23:29] for through him
[2:23:30] we
[2:23:31] both have access by one spirit
[2:23:35] unto the father
[2:23:37] oh hallelujah
[2:23:41] preacher
[2:23:43] you've talked to us about a gate and i
[2:23:45] just really
[2:23:46] not grasping what you're trying to say
[2:23:50] well friends
[2:23:53] god gave you a mind
[2:23:55] as a human being
[2:23:57] he gave you an eye gate
[2:24:00] he gave you an ear gate
[2:24:03] he gave the gateway of the mind
[2:24:07] and the enemy is looking for any access
[2:24:12] whether it be through a worldly song
[2:24:15] whether it be through some kind of filth
[2:24:17] that you would view with your eyes
[2:24:19] whether it would be something that
[2:24:21] somebody said and
[2:24:23] you roll it around in your mind and you
[2:24:25] roll it around in your mind and it
[2:24:28] becomes out of hand and and you just
[2:24:30] continue to let it go on but i'm telling
[2:24:33] you as a part of the royal seed of
[2:24:36] abraham
[2:24:38] you are able to have access to the gates
[2:24:41] of your own mind god has given you of
[2:24:44] the authority over your own being to get
[2:24:47] to take the access
[2:24:51] to possess the gate as i was starting to
[2:24:54] say a while ago repentance is such a key
[2:24:57] in in that even after being born again a
[2:25:01] believer still comes back to the lord
[2:25:03] and and repents because we're still
[2:25:06] working through this process to let the
[2:25:08] mind that was in christ jesus be fully
[2:25:11] in us you see i have the mind of christ
[2:25:14] but there are days where i
[2:25:17] am still uh
[2:25:19] i get distracted or whatever happens and
[2:25:22] the enemy gains some kind of access into
[2:25:24] my mind and i entertain him a while and
[2:25:27] so i have to go back to papa and say
[2:25:29] lord i i'm sorry i'm sorry that i
[2:25:33] allowed that to happen and i am okay i'm
[2:25:36] taking access once again to my gates
[2:25:40] they belong to me you gave me authority
[2:25:42] over them
[2:25:44] we were also instructed that we should
[2:25:46] be baptized in the name of the lord
[2:25:49] jesus christ well what about matthew 28
[2:25:52] 19 to be baptized in the name of the
[2:25:55] father and of the son and of the holy
[2:25:57] ghost his name is lord jesus christ
[2:26:00] that's who he is that's no problem be
[2:26:02] filled with the holy ghost this promises
[2:26:05] to you and to your children and to them
[2:26:08] that are afar off moms and dads aunts
[2:26:11] uncles cousins brothers sisters if
[2:26:14] you've got some that are out of the ark
[2:26:16] of safety you just remind the lord have
[2:26:20] his word to him that is afar off even as
[2:26:24] many as the lord our god shall call i
[2:26:26] don't know who god is calling but i
[2:26:28] heard a prophet one time say that you
[2:26:30] had enough faith to call on god for
[2:26:33] yourself
[2:26:35] and because of that faith that you had
[2:26:38] to call on the lord for yourself and you
[2:26:40] walked as the royal seed of abraham and
[2:26:44] you were walking in in truth and in the
[2:26:47] word of god that there was something
[2:26:49] that could quicken on the inside of you
[2:26:52] that you could start calling in your
[2:26:54] loved ones holding the token the blood
[2:26:57] over them say their mind they belong to
[2:27:00] the lord they don't belong to the devil
[2:27:02] god did not god did not give me seed to
[2:27:06] belong to the devil
[2:27:08] he did not give me children and
[2:27:10] grandchildren to belong to the devil
[2:27:12] i have had faith to call on the lord for
[2:27:15] myself i'm going to call on the lord for
[2:27:19] them until they recognize
[2:27:22] [Applause]
[2:27:24] you can't repent for them
[2:27:27] they've got to do it for themselves
[2:27:29] but friends there's power in the word of
[2:27:32] god there's power in your voice
[2:27:34] decreeing over them i i didn't birth any
[2:27:37] serpent seed i didn't birth any seed of
[2:27:41] hell i birthed children of the living
[2:27:44] god and they may be wayward right now
[2:27:46] they may be away from god they may look
[2:27:49] like they're headed straight for hell
[2:27:51] but i'm a child of god and i'm holding
[2:27:54] the token over them in the name of jesus
[2:27:57] christ and they've got to come
[2:28:00] [Applause]
[2:28:02] they may not come
[2:28:03] the same way you did
[2:28:06] they may not live the same victorious
[2:28:08] life that god by his grace has given to
[2:28:11] you but they don't have to go to hell
[2:28:13] friends you they you you don't have to
[2:28:16] just uh blatantly watch your children go
[2:28:19] off into a devil's hell just take the
[2:28:21] word of the lord and hold it over them
[2:28:23] god you're a saving god and you already
[2:28:27] know the names that are in that book and
[2:28:29] i'm holding my children my grandchildren
[2:28:32] my nieces my nephews they're they're
[2:28:35] fighting one another they're battling
[2:28:37] one another but god i know that there's
[2:28:40] something somehow you can get a hold of
[2:28:42] them by your grace
[2:28:48] and after you're filled with the holy
[2:28:49] ghost
[2:28:52] and refilled with the holy ghost
[2:28:55] and refilled with the holy ghost
[2:28:58] and refilled with the holy ghost
[2:29:01] and refilled with the holy ghost
[2:29:03] okay broken record preacher what are you
[2:29:05] trying to say i'm telling you that some
[2:29:08] of it seeps out
[2:29:13] god gave it to me
[2:29:15] to give out to others
[2:29:18] god gave it to me
[2:29:20] to be like peter to walk down the street
[2:29:22] where my shadow would touch somebody and
[2:29:24] they would rise up and be healed but
[2:29:26] i've got to go back to the fountain of
[2:29:28] living water and be refilled with the
[2:29:30] holy ghost
[2:29:34] then
[2:29:35] because of the goodness of god
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:39] because of his grace
[2:29:41] he lets me see some things in my life
[2:29:44] that at one time he could not uncover
[2:29:46] because he knew that i could not handle
[2:29:48] it
[2:29:50] and when he uncovers it
[2:29:53] and i repent of it
[2:29:55] i have to say lord
[2:29:57] come fill that void place
[2:30:00] because i sure don't want any demon
[2:30:01] spirits i don't want them to have any
[2:30:03] access
[2:30:06] possess the gate friends
[2:30:08] possess the gate
[2:30:10] you shall possess the gate of your
[2:30:13] enemies

[2:30:21] but we have already access
[2:30:23] over death hell and the grave we have
[2:30:27] those keys through the lord jesus christ
[2:30:30] and we have the keys through the word of
[2:30:32] god to maintain control of this house
[2:30:35] that god gave to us you're the temple of
[2:30:37] the living god
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:43] and he only
[2:30:45] wants to have access into your life
[2:30:49] we could all
[2:30:51] give horror stories
[2:30:53] of how we have allowed the enemy into
[2:30:55] our life
[2:30:56] and given him access
[2:30:59] but forgetting those things which are
[2:31:01] behind me
[2:31:03] i press
[2:31:05] toward
[2:31:07] the prize of the high calling in christ
[2:31:10] jesus what is that prize it is the gift
[2:31:14] that has been given to the royal seat of
[2:31:16] abraham that she possess every gate

[2:31:22] every part of her being and she becomes
[2:31:26] so filled with resurrection
