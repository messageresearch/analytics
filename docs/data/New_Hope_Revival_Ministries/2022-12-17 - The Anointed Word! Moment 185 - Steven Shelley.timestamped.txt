[0:00] because there is a people that are being
[0:03] prepared as forerunners for the final
[0:08] manifestation of Christ in the Earth
[0:12] [Music]
[0:19] we are expecting
[0:21] a anointed
[0:25] installment
[0:27] of God's word to our hearts
[0:30] that will transform us
[0:34] from Who We Are
[0:36] to who he has created us to be
[0:41] we are not looking for a new truth
[0:45] but we're looking to discover what the
[0:48] spirit is underlining
[0:51] what the Holy Ghost is highlighting for
[0:55] such a time as this when we hear this
[0:58] written word and read this written word
[1:00] and study this written word we need the
[1:04] reality and the Living Word to come
[1:06] Among Us
[1:09] invite him into your bedroom
[1:11] when you sit down to read the written
[1:13] word invite the Living Word to come
[1:17] John 1 didn't say in the beginning was
[1:20] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:22] the word became printed form
[1:25] he didn't say in the beginning was the
[1:28] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:29] word became a magnetic tape
[1:34] he said in the beginning was the word
[1:36] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:37] was God and the word became flesh
[1:41] flesh somebody say flesh what is that
[1:45] it's a body
[1:46] the word is not looking for a page the
[1:49] word is looking for a body what house
[1:51] will you build me
[1:53] the word doesn't come to make you feel
[1:55] good
[1:58] the word comes to transform us
[2:02] not from the outside in
[2:04] [Music]
[2:06] but from the inside out
[2:08] how many of you believe the word is
[2:10] becoming flesh again in the body of the
[2:13] Bride of Jesus Christ somebody said I
[2:15] can't say that because I've had a week
[2:16] from hell no you didn't you had a week
[2:19] out of his book
[2:23] you had a week out of his book
[2:26] it might not have been pleasant but it
[2:28] didn't come to bless you it come to
[2:31] prepare you
[2:32] [Music]
[2:33] because there is a people that are being
[2:36] prepared as for runners for the final
[2:42] manifestation of Christ in the Earth
[2:47] the bride's Revival is the last
[2:50] Revival
[2:52] the last one I want you to understand
[2:55] that busy hands is not enough if your
[2:58] heart is not postured in love for the
[3:02] bridegroom staying busy is not enough if
[3:06] you don't know him as your lover staying
[3:09] busy is not enough if you don't lay your
[3:11] head on his chest and hear what causes
[3:14] his heart to beat
[3:17] is intimacy
[3:19] it's time in the tent
[3:24] it's time in the tent
[3:28] because there will be no Revival no True
[3:31] full force Revival in the bride until we
[3:36] love him more than we love ourselves
[3:39] until we love the word more than we love
[3:43] this world
[3:49] but it's coming
