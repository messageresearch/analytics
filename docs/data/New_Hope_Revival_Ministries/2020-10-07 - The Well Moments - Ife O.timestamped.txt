[0:00] you've got a well in your belly
[0:10] there's an inspiration of joy
[0:13] that the lord can pour down into the
[0:16] inside of the inside of the inside
[0:19] we're not talking about something that
[0:21] originates in the soul
[0:22] the mind the will and the emotion we're
[0:25] talking about something that originates
[0:27] in the depth of the spirit
[0:29] the spirit of man that has been
[0:32] regenerated it has been remade it has
[0:35] been refashioned
[0:37] by the holy spirit of god and there's a
[0:41] joy that comes forth out of the spirit
[0:44] of man that can be present it can be
[0:47] touched you can reach down and find it
[0:51] you can look for it and find it no
[0:54] matter what the circumstances are
[0:56] you've got a well in your belly
[1:01] you've got a well in your inner being
[1:04] you just have to reach in and remember
[1:08] that god has reconciled
[1:11] himself to you you to himself
[1:14] by jesus christ greater is he that is in
[1:18] you than he that is in the world
[1:20] eternity lives in your bosom
[1:25] you want to find jesus don't go
[1:28] looking at somebody else reach down
[1:32] on the inside of the inside where you
[1:35] invited him to come and live
[1:37] whoa where you invited him to sit
[1:41] and rule and reign from the control
[1:44] tower
[1:44] of your inner man that's where he is and
[1:47] where he is there is peace
[1:51] and where he is there is joy therefore
[1:54] with joy
[1:55] shall we draw waters water from the
[1:59] wells
[2:00] of yeshua from the wells of salvation
[2:03] without joy it's the same as
[2:07] without a vision the people perish
[2:11] they cast off restraint without
[2:14] joy the people wither and they not only
[2:17] wither spiritually
[2:19] they start withering emotionally and
[2:21] they start withering
[2:23] physically real joy resides down in the
[2:27] spirit
[2:28] of a man who knows that he was so
[2:31] for loved loved
[2:34] for such a reason he cannot quite
[2:38] understand but before he was ever born
[2:42] a god loved him so much that he made a
[2:45] plan
[2:46] to come in jesus to come
[2:50] in the son of man in the son of god
[2:53] in the son of david and fully
[2:56] reconcile man back into fellowship
[3:00] with him you're that man you're that
[3:03] woman
[3:04] and if you have no other reason to dig a
[3:07] well
[3:07] to rediscover the place where your joy
[3:10] is
[3:11] that's enough so no matter what has
[3:15] battled you
[3:16] and no matter what the old season has
[3:19] handed to you
[3:20] and no matter how you've been left
[3:23] fighting
[3:24] the greatest battle ever fought there is
[3:27] still joy
[3:28] unspeakable and full of glory and it's
[3:31] found in the deposit
[3:33] of god's life
[3:37] it's within you
