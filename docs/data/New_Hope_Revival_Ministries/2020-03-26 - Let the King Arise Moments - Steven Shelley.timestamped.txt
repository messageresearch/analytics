[0:00] we live to shine we live to pierce the
[0:04] darkness there is a people that has been
[0:15] prepared by the Word of God by the
[0:18] inspiration of Revelation that that she
[0:21] might also not be ignorant of the
[0:24] devil's devices I don't want to spend a
[0:27] whole lot of time studying them but I
[0:29] want to know about them I want to see
[0:31] how he can work so I can figure out how
[0:33] to stop him at the pass there's one way
[0:36] to stop the enemy in his tracks believe
[0:41] what you say
[0:42] that's it believe what you say it's not
[0:47] just speak the word when you put your
[0:49] faith in that word it causes an
[0:53] activation in the life of that seed it
[0:57] causes something to come up and to come
[1:00] alive and so the more faith you can add
[1:04] to the word you speak to the words you
[1:06] read to the words you hear the more
[1:10] fruit you're going to see in your own
[1:12] personal life I believe that there will
[1:16] be a revival I do I believe there will
[1:20] be a manifestation of the full adoption
[1:24] of sons you are as adopted right now as
[1:28] you will ever be but we have not yet
[1:32] learned the authority that comes with
[1:35] full adoption but there is a maturity as
[1:38] you know that comes with this adoption
[1:40] that the sons of God will arise and
[1:43] they're not going to arise covered with
[1:46] darkness they're going to arise to the
[1:48] light of the Lord and the Lord is going
[1:52] to shine his glory his glory shall be
[1:55] seen upon thee
[1:57] the Lord shall arise upon thee he shall
[2:01] stand
[2:03] he's already on the inside of the
[2:07] believer this eternal life is his life
[2:11] it is a deposit of eternity that's
[2:14] living in the believer it is the Lord
[2:16] Himself he is his word his word is his
[2:20] person his word is his person his word
[2:26] is his presence there is an anointing
[2:29] that can fall that makes his presence
[2:33] more real or more recognizable but he
[2:37] don't leave you brother sister if you're
[2:39] born again from above the Lord is living
[2:43] in your house he is sitting on your
[2:45] throne if you have allowed him to have
[2:48] that place of preeminence in your life
[2:49] anytime he wants to he can stand up but
[2:54] he is waiting for the invitation
[2:56] Lord will you arise in me will you stand
[3:01] up in me and let your glory be seen on
[3:06] my life because it's not mine anymore
[3:09] it's yours we live to shine we live to
[3:14] pierce the darkness
[3:18] you
