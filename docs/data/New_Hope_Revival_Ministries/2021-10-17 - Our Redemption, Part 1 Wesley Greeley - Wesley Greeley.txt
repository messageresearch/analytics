that called me late at night and there was a disturbing beeping sound that was happening in her home and she had a neighbor and they could not figure out how to get rid of it and we had that same beeping sound here today what did you all do with that thing there's another one back here making the same sound as i walked out it's beeping anyhow i said disconnect it and throw it out in the yard apparently these things go bad and it's time that after 16 or 17 years here in the church they need to be replaced and we'll do that right away so that we have safety here in the building but we don't need distractions this morning there's enough that the enemy uses as distractions to keep us from hearing the word of the lord and uh i'm just grateful that god made a way for us to bring ourselves back into line to hear and that is we have to consciously bring our minds and say lord i'm going to focus on you i'm going to worship you and just begin to whisper his name jesus jesus there's something about that name thank you lord jesus jesus jesus [Music] there's just something about that name master save your jesus like the fragrance after the rain jesus jesus [Music] let all heaven and earth proclaim [Music] kings and kingdoms shall all pass away but there's something about that name will you sing again oh jesus jesus jesus there's just [Music] about that name [Music] master save your jesus like the fragrance after the rain jesus jesus [Music] jesus let all heaven and earth proclaim kings and kingdoms shall all pass away but there's something about would you be willing to stand and sing once again lift your hands if you're able jesus jesus jesus there's just something about that name master [Music] chase [Music] like the fragrance after the rain jesus jesus jesus let all heaven and earth proclaim [Music] kings and kingdoms shall all pass away but there's something about [Music] that name [Music] our lord jesus [Music] you who [Music] took on the form of man [Music] you came and walked this earth to redeem mankind back to his original place oh lord jesus we honor you today for your goodness and your grace in our lives we thank you lord that we can once again be gathered and we can hear the word of the lord i'm asking you o god that you would hide this vessel and i pray lord that you will speak through lips of clay god i'm asking you to even bypass my mind and you speak you speak lord let there be years to hear what the spirit would say to the church today god may we be receptive to hear your voice thank you lord that you are working moving reviving strengthening oh lord i give you praise for you are good may your name be glorified in this service it is in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen thank you lord thank you lord would you give our musicians a a hand of applause today [Applause] you may look at them and say they filled in today but i want you to know that their job was harder than those that do it on a regular basis because they're not used to it and i appreciate every one of them for stepping up and helping us and even at a request of the preacher learning a new song to bring to the people i appreciate it so much if you have your bibles today will you turn with me to first corinthians chapter one first corinthians chapter one verse 18. this subject has been on my heart and mind for some weeks now i can't get away from it for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god let me read it once again for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats some of the revised versions read but unto us which are being saved it is the power of god i'm gonna stick with the king james today because i believe that it is a finished work i am walking it out but as far as he's concerned and i as far as i'm concerned today i'm saved i can no more be lost than god can be lost because i was a part of him from the beginning and he saw me from the beginning and he said that one's mine and you may say well are you preaching a message of predestination yes in fact i am preaching a message of predestination because i serve a god who is so big and he knows so much that he looked from the beginning all the way to the end of time and he saw every single person and he saw what person would say yes and he saw the person that would say no and by that he could give them a destiny that was already prefixed as i ponder the thought of predestination and i ponder the thought of the millions and billions and trillions of people through the ages of eternity and i think about how god would take and put individuals in a certain age and he would he would make them to be able to mesh with the the rest of the people that were in that age and make it all work and then people want to say we started from an amoeba sometimes our minds ponder this whole thing and think what a fairy tale that we live in but i'm telling you it is not a fairy tale it is a meticulous god who was able to put it all together in such precision and such meticulous order that everything would work just right you say well this one fell and that one fell and that one walked away after serving the lord for many years it's still god's meticulous plan any that belong to him he will not lose them i don't care whether they served the lord for 20 years and walked away for 20 and on their deathbed they recognize what a foolish mistake that they made god will not lose one that belongs to him god is not sitting around wondering will this one ever get right with me no he already knows and he knows who's going to be in the right position at the right time to speak the right word of encouragement or the right word of correction or the right word of chastisement god knows exactly what is needed to get a person in the right place at the right time to get the right word but the preaching of the cross is through the years there have been those that are perishing i am not here to preach a universalist gospel to you or to anybody else i do not believe that the devil is going to be saved and i do believe that there is a hell there is a lake of fire and it was prepared for the devil and his angels and there are human beings who are going to go to that place these are the same ones who think the preaching of the cross is foolishness they don't understand it they don't have a mind to comprehend it and you may say well why didn't god he's the all-powerful god why didn't god make them and help them to understand it god already saw that even if they could understand it they would still reject it because he's all powerful and he's all seen and he knows exactly your yes and your no now i or you as a believer have we ever said no to the lord of course we have but god saw that eternal yes that one that counted and he knew that even though at one time or another we may say no to a certain thing he came back around and he offered it once again because he knew that you were rooted and grounded in him and that you would grow up into the seeds of righteousness that he had already pre-allowed to be so the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god turn with me if you will to hebrews chapter 12. hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore seen we also this is after the great faith chapter hebrews 11 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us why does it so easily beset us now i want you as you look at this i want you because we say well i've overcome this i've overcome that i've overcome this sin and that sin and the other sin and all of those things that were a list once upon a time but i want us to put a different word in there for rather than sin i want us to put in the word unbelief and the unbelief with which doth so easily beset us when we are in a position where the enemy catches us at a weak moment the unbelief so easily besets us all right so we are compassed with a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the unbelief for the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith we know that he started it he was the author of it and he is the one who is going to finish it up who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god now we know that uh the in reading the scripture that there are people who have gone on before us the great cloud of witnesses we call them those who have already run their race with patience and they were laid down to sleep those that are in christ they do not die that uh they are they are as much alive or more alive today than they've ever been they are just resting waiting for the rest of us to catch up to them so we continue to run our race and it is our responsibility to lay aside all of the weights and all of the unbelief that so easily besets us we have to run this race with patience what is this what do they say rome wasn't built in a day and your walk with the lord is not going to be finished in one day it's going to take your whole span of your lifetime and and and maybe you won't be as close to the lord as you want to be when you're at your last day on this earth but run your race with patience and you lay aside all of the unbelief all of the weights that are so easily uh causing you to be beset and you look to jesus the author and finisher of our faith now because that he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the one that decided that you could not redeem yourself there was no way for you to redeem yourself but you were part of him and he wanted you back he did not want you to remain in your fallen condition he did not want to be separated from you so the scripture says who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross what is that joy that joy is you and me i was the joy that was set before him now this is way too elementary but i i just had this glimpse of a child that is learning to walk and something is put in front of him to entice him to make steps i and you we were the ones that were put before the lord jesus we were the joy that was set before him that he was willing to endure the cross now i want you to recognize here that it was not joy for him to be on the cross it even says that he despised the shame naked before the entire world he was he was he despised that shame and he endured the cross he was willing to be on that cross he was willing to stay under the load oh what a load that he carried on behalf of me and on behalf of you this load of sin and condemnation and guilt and shame and all the things that go with it through life he he endured it he he stayed under that heavy load to go to the cross because of the joy that was set before him despising the shame and he went through all of it and he's now set down at the right hand of the throne of god he is now sitting in the place of authority all right now i want us to go to colossians chapter 2. colossians chapter 2 starting with verse 6. colossians 2 verse 6 as you have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving we so often forget the part of thanksgiving we're to be rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as we have been taught and abounding in with thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit how many people through the years have you seen that that were that they became spoiled through philosophy they they they accepted a gospel of philosophy rather than this bloody gospel they they took a gospel that uh was was uh philosophical in it it was really the intellectual mind that was coming up with some of the things that they were doing but this uh paul is warning the uh colossian church to beware that you don't get spoiled through philosophy and vein deceit i'm telling you there are plenty of philosophies out there there are plenty of of the people who are preaching a gospel and it is not a gospel or the gospel according to the lord jesus christ it is not the gospel that will save a man from his sin it's a gospel that will make him feel good to get through the days of hard times but i'm telling you when you are rooted and grounded in the lord jesus christ you go through trials and tribulations you go through some things that are going to hurt they're going to bring you some pain they're going to cause you to wonder why did i start this journey but again he that started this work in you is able to complete it you have to keep coming back to the well so don't be don't let a man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ now you've got to remember that paul preaching here he's dealing with all of these jewish believers who have been under the under the rulership or under the leadership of of the pharisees and the sadducees and the sanhedrin they've been under this uh leadership for so many years and these men through the years have taken god's word and they've added there too and they've they've come up maybe with some philosophies they've come up with some vain traditions they've come up with so many things that are really the traditions of men and they're after the rudiments of the world and not after christ so he is warning them to be careful so now he says in verse 9 for in him who's him we've got to go back to verse 6 christ jesus the lord for in him dwelleth all of the fullness of the godhead bodily so we have for those that may not be familiar either here or watching this service the eternal spirit of god the creator of all things he knew that he could not send somebody else in his place therefore he chose to come to earth as a human being this child born of a virgin mary she did not supply the egg a man on the earth did not provide the sperm this was all created by god and he created the child and then he stepped into this body john 1 the word became flesh and dwelt among us for in him christ jesus the lord dwelleth all of the fullness of the godhead bodily or in bodily form in a body now if you stop right there that's great but go to the next verse because now we're bringing us into the picture and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power he christ jesus the lord is the head of all principality and power now we look at this word principality and power and we can look in the the greek language and try to figure out what this mean in its uh basic meaning the principality and power as leader but then you get the head he is the chief of chiefs he is the supreme one christ jesus the lord is the supreme one and i am complete in him and he is the head over principality and power that means because i am complete in him i also have been given an authority over the principality and power because i have been made partaker joint heir with christ jesus and that means i'm joining him in being chief over principality and power unless you make unless you think i'm trying to make me out of something this human flesh is rotten to the core it is no good it is worthless but i have chosen by the grace of god the seed that was in me i have received into me christ jesus the lord the very spirit of the living god the very spirit of the godhead bodily is now dwelling in this body and he's given me power over the principalities and powers because the chief lives in me in whom verse 11 in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism when jesus died on the cross he was buried and we just read that we are complete in him because we were in him we were with him we are identified with him so when we go down in baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and we're buried in water in baptism this is symbolizing that we are we are recognizing by faith that we have been buried with him we are we are uh carrying out a symbolism of something that happened while we were identified in him and so then we also are risen with him through faith of the operation of god sometimes this seems such a fantastic thought that we can't wrap our minds around that we were in him when he died that day at calvary and we went with him through this process of identification and maybe i don't have all the right vocabulary to describe it just right but i know that i was identified in him as he was there in the tomb and as he descended into the lower parts of the earth and he took away the keys of death hell and the grave from satan as he went and he spoke to those in paradise i was identified in him and when i became when i came to the earth as a human being god wanted me to have identification with his death burial and resurrection and so he made a way through the operation of god and i put faith in the operation of god and so i was buried with him in baptism when i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i was identifying with his death all of the sins that he bore of mine to calvary i now as a human being recognize that he bore those sins to calvary and he died on my hand behalf so when he was buried in baptism i am now by faith recognizing the operation of god and as i come back up out of that water i am rising up with him i am again identifying that he did not stay in the grave but he arose and he came up out of the grave triumphing over death hell in the grave so when i come up out of the water i am by faith recognizing the operation of god this is the way that god operates by faith that is the only way that you can ever get to god that is by faith it is not likely that you are going to see the living god in a bodily form like you see me perhaps you will i know the scripture says no man has seen god at any time why is that because god is a spirit and then god's spirit he chose to create a body in the lord jesus christ and that spirit came and dwelt in jesus on a body of flesh on the earth and as brother shelley was preaching to us in all manners was tempted as we are yet without sin so through this operation of god by faith i'm buried with him identifying in his burial i come up out of the water and i'm risen through faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead now remember that this is a let me get it right i believe brother branham called coming up out of the water this rising is a type the antitype is when we come up in the resurrection at the last day when we rise to meet him in the air this is what we have been given but by faith we are seeing that jesus christ arose from the dead i rose with him and now all that sin is dead you may say if if sin is dead and i'm a believer why am i having to deal with these things on a day in and day out basis sin didn't go away the attributes of sin and the sinful nature are still on the earth but the power of that stuff all of it he was in every manner tempted as we yet without sin and he walked it out and now we as believers are walking this thing out because we have been given the same spirit that jesus was given we have been given the baptism of the holy ghost to be able to walk this walk out and we do not have to walk under the condemnation of sin it may come to us but we do not have to participate with it we do not have to entertain it we can tell it to leave in the name of jesus christ all right so we are buried with him in baptism whereas where in also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all your trespasses now i want you to look at the last part of that because he has quickened he has quickened together with him you you have been quickened together with him and all of your trespasses are forgiven blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross now when paul was speaking this and he's talking about the blotting out of the handwriting of ordinances that was against us he was talking about he's he's dealing with circumcision and uncircumcision he's dealing with people of the law and he's talking about all of these ordinances that were that were written and added uh to to to try to make fences for the people till that they didn't go too far away from god and and he's talking about these handwriting of ordinances that the people were living under the guilt of these things they're living under all of the weight of this law that they can't possibly keep it's just too big for them there was no way that man could keep every letter of the law and when he came every year to offer a sacrifice whenever he came to offer a sacrifice it was never enough to get rid of the sin it was never enough to get rid of the sin nature and so man kept living under the weight of all of these ordinances every year every year every year he's living under the weight of these ordinances and i just started thinking about the handwriting of ordinances that were blotted out and i began to think about you know we talk about our names being written in the lamb's book of life and they can't be blotted out we talk about a book that uh he said that he would he made remembrance of us he kept a record of those that spake of him often he kept a record of it and i just started thinking about uh you know i figure satan has a few books too and i figure that there have been times in our life that he had our name written down and he saw us fall or fail oh these guys say they're believers and why he's a thief he just stole banana off the shelf i'm gonna write that down i'm gonna keep recording track of that oh yeah there he goes he's that guy over there he's he says he's a believer and he's fornicating with other women we'll write that down that's a mark against him because i already know the scripture that says fornicators that they they don't have no part with god and and what about what about those that he hates his neighbor uh yeah i'm gonna write it down and see satan's keeping track of all this stuff keeping track i just wonder what kind of book he has but as i saw this verse this morning i saw that book that he had written all about me and i expect that he's probably still taking notes today but no matter what's in that book that saint might have i see a nail to the cross and all that's in that book that he's kept a record of satan's kept a record of it's all nailed to the cross so every time that the devil tries to remind me of it i say oh no it's already been nailed to the cross it's been blotted out see my name can't be blotted out of the lamb's book of life it can't be so that means it's got to be blotted out of some book brother richard some book is going to get a blotting somewhere it's going to be wiped out and it ain't going to be the book of life so that means christ jesus my lord he has already taken all of the marks against me along with all of the law that couldn't be kept because no man could ever keep it and he nailed it to the cross he took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers now again i want you to look at the principalities and powers because these are the same words that i uh brought up in verse 10 that he is the head of principality and power now in verse 15 it says he spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it so jesus christ christ jesus our lord he took everything that was against you and against me and he nailed it to the cross the problem is that many times we do not take advantage of what he nailed to the cross what he took to the cross see everything that is a part of your life that brings you down everything that discourages you everything that causes your health to decline everything that causes your spiritual state to decline he took it to the cross and it was nailed to his cross i want us to turn to isaiah chapter 53 isaiah chapter 53. who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed now the arm of the lord as you would take this phrase the arm of the lord and you trace it back through the old testament scripture many times when the arm of the lord was mentioned it was god doing battle through his stretched out arm who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed i believe when you recognize that jesus christ has died for your sins and that you desire to be under his lordship that the arm of the lord is just beginning to be revealed to you there are many people who want him to be savior but they don't want him to be lord of their life they want him to be savior so they can escape hell but they don't want him to be the lord of their life but when you see the arm of the lord revealed and you see that he is the mighty god of battle and you can see his track record through the scripture that by his mighty stretched out arm he conquered armies you know you can read back through the old testament and how that god it could almost become comical at times how that man really thinks he's something but if god took his hand off of it man would be dead but when god is in it and god gives instruction to a man and he can tell him no you've got too many in your army gideon you just got too many what kind of battle strategy is that the more men i've got the more men i can whoop no that wasn't god's battle strategy because man is not going to get glory in god's battle strategy so god can take thousands of men and reduce it to just a few hundred men by the way that they drink water now how comical is that just go down by the water and i'm gonna watch to see who drinks water a certain way and we're just going to dismiss all that don't drink water the right way what kind of battle strategy is that it's god's battle strategy what about when david he tells his men he says when we get up here and god tells him when you hear the rustling in the mulberry tree that's your signal well what kind of signal is that how do i have any confidence that you're gonna send that signal to me god never goes back on his promises when god has a battle strategy and he wants to show his strong right arm he knows exactly how to do it so who has believed i report that's the first thing you've got to do you've got to believe the report of the lord is this even something that see friends it's all by faith it's all by faith i can present something to you and if you're under a philosophical gospel you may say you've got to prove it to me in a stronger measure than just to tell me it's by faith i don't know how to that is why you can explain the godhead to some people when they get it and some they can't because it is god who opens up the eyes of a believer it is god who opens up the eyes of understanding that you can be enlightened to understand what is the hope that lies within you all right so who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plan and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of man would it have been easier to go to the cross if he'd had people behind him patting him on the back saying oh brother this is the right thing to do this is what you got to do you gotta it's the only way that mankind can be saved but that wasn't how that jesus christ walked this earth he was despised and he was rejected of men the disciples even walked away they didn't know what to do things got out of hand for them they just didn't know what in the world was happening it was a horrible time in their lives and they didn't know how to respond to it and so he was despised and rejected of man a man of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not verse 4 surely he hath borne our griefs i want us to pause right here because jesus christ went to the cross not just for the saving of your soul jesus christ bore our griefs our maladies our anxieties and even our calamities he bore our griefs when he went to the cross he recognized that there were going to be times in your life where you were going to carry anxiety because the pressures of life were going to be too great for you to carry and so he chose to carry your griefs every one of them your maladies your anxieties and even your calamities oh mercy the calamities that i have been that i have been a part of that i helped to create ones that calamities said i'm embarrassed about calamities that make us want to crawl in a hole and forget that we were ever born we don't want to see people's face friends he bore it to calvary so that you don't have to carry the grief or the shame of it he carried our sorrows our pain our sorrow pain our physical pain and our mental pain there are many people today who are in physical pain [Music] but there are far more people who are in mental pain every morning they wake up and they face some kind of a pain in their mind people that that have lost of a loved one through suicide and and they're contemplating it maybe themselves but oh friend god chose to carry that to calvary and to relieve you of your mental pain so that you don't have to carry it you say well brother how do i get rid of it lean on jesus christ oh you say that's so easy ah i don't know how to tell you any better than that to lean on jesus and when let's just let's just take for instance david david was a man who he he was a great king but there came a springtime where that he chose not to go to battle and instead he remained home and sent his soldiers out rather than going to battle and while he was sitting at home he one day he goes out onto the rooftop and he sees a woman over on another roof taking a bath the spirit of lust rises up in david and he says i want that woman and he brings someone brings this woman into his home she is another man's wife who is out fighting a battle now david is on and now david has has spent time with this woman he slept this with this woman and she is carrying his child now what does he do david he he he sends word to bring her husband back home he wants to try to cover his sin and make uriah go and then lay with his wife so maybe his sin can be covered over but uriah spends all night at the king's door he says how can i go have pleasure with my wife when my friends are out on the battlefield fighting now david says what am i gonna do he didn't go home and sleep with his wife he had no pleasure with his wife and she's carrying a child how am i to cover this up so now david has to do something even bigger of a sin and he sends word to his captain and he says i want you to put uriah in the forefront of the battle so that he gets killed and sure enough this woman's husband is killed david takes this takes this uh woman bathsheba into his house now and she becomes his wife but the sin is still there and this child is growing in her womb and when it's born it it dies and now david is weeping but somehow god sends a prophetic voice to david and helps him to recognize his sin now david is in mental anguish he is in a mental pain and this is the kind of pain that people are in today because they they their sin all around and rather than coming under the leadership of the lord jesus christ and and and though the temptation may come putting a stop to the temptation and saying that's not mine that doesn't belong to me jesus bore that to calvary and that's not a part of my life that is not who i am that is not who i've called to be i am not taking that into myself but see david partook of all this stuff and that's what people do they partake of all this stuff and then it pushes them to the brink where they want to commit suicide and they carry this mental anguish this pain they don't know what to do with and then then they have to take appeal and then oh friend it may be in that book that satan keeps a record of but jesus already nailed it to his cross he already nailed it to his cross the pain the sorrow uh the physical pain and the mental pain all of it was born to calvary yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for my transgressions all i'm doing is i'm trying to let you see what the cross did for us what the cross really paid for how that we can apply it to our lives he was wounded for my transgression is there anybody in here that has ever transgressed the law of god every one of us i you don't have to raise your hands i know the answer before i ask because everyone all have sinned and come short of the glory of god all have transgressed all have trespassed but he was wounded for our transgression that means that every wound that he carried it was for you it was for me for the transgressions that we were going to commit because this this is the what christ did at calvary it was able to reach forward to every human being and every sin that it would ever commit it was able to reach backward and get to every sin that any man ever committed before that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities bruised our human body we have all received a bruise at one time or another some of them are painful i bruise easily and my wife off oftentimes asks me where did that one come i don't know because i brew so easily many times i i get a bruise i bump myself and i don't i don't realize that i have hit hard enough for a bruise and then as we get older and our skin gets uh more fragile then then we begin to bruise and you know we we watch our elderly people sometimes when they have to go in the hospital and they they try to put these needles in their veins and their whole hand becomes bruised all of that bruising that we get you think about i just have a a mental picture that because of our iniquities his entire body was a bruise what was not a wound was a bruise it was just a bloody mess some of it under the skin some of it on top of the skin some being down the road as he walked and it was for our transgressions and for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him friends how many days do we live without peace things come along to steal our peace and we leave it as that we fail to return to peace we fail to return to shalom but the chastisement of our peace when jesus was chastised he didn't deserve any of it but he did it so that you could have shalom he carried all of that upon him so that you didn't have to carry your transgressions you didn't have to carry your iniquities you did not have to carry uh the place of of unrest and no peace he did it so that you could have his shalom and with his stripes we are healed now in the 50s and 60s during the great healing revival when a.a allen and oral roberts and brother branham and all of these healing evangelists were on the earth we have the privilege of these uh recorded sermons of brother branham uh where that the majority uh when he was out in the field the majority of his ministry was praying for the sick and god chose to use the praying for the sick as as a um i'm gonna call it a shadow a shadow of things to come it was it was him helping us to recognize that you could grab a hold of something by faith and you could see it as tangible so if a person come into a prayer line and there was a border hanging off of their neck a goiter hanging off of their neck then by the pronouncement of healing many times people saw with their eyes that goiter fall off of a person's neck because it was something visible now how did it happen it happened by faith and he kept telling the people it's your faith it's your faith your healing is because of your faith now many times perhaps people went away and they saw no physical manifestation remember his story so often that he told about john ryan who came into the prayer line he was blind he was led by somebody else he was blind he was catholic he sold newspapers uh and then he came into the prayer line and brother branham pronounced him healed go your way you are healed now for a skeptic who had watched goiters fall off of somebody's neck and they were still a skeptic and they heard the pronouncement that somebody had been healed of their cancer and they were still a skeptic and they heard somebody uh that had arthritis and they were pronounced healed and the skeptic was still a skeptic now they see this man come through a prayer line he's blind and he comes out the other side after a pronouncement of healing and the skeptic says it's just as i thought so now this man circles back around and comes through the prayer line again and he says to brother branham you told me that i was healed brother branham said yes and you said you believed me when i said you're healed i do believe you i believe i'm healed and then he asked brother branham what should i do because he still couldn't see brother branham gave him the instruction you go confessing your healing that was the instruction what was the purpose behind it was john ryan's faith not yet big enough for the manifestation of the miracle to happen i don't know but that was the instructions that brother branham gave to john ryan go your way you're healed you profess your healing so the man goes out and he says praise the lord he's healed me i can see and so now he goes back to the street corner selling his newspapers because he still can't see and he says extra extra read all about it jesus healed me i can see now what does that produce it now is producing more critics because they're saying you're a looney bird you are one more of a quack you can't see no more now than you did before you went to that faith healer what kind of a reproach are you bringing to the gospel but john ryan there was something on the inside of him that didn't matter how many critics he had heard that he was supposed to continue to confess his healing that he was healed and it was his faith that was resting in the promise of god and he continued to extra extra read all about it thank god he's healed me still blind so the story continues one day he goes into the barber shop and the barber shop being uh the barber being a critic john i hear you as down at the faith healer i heard you got healed john says yeah thank god i have been healed i can see my eyes are open he said at that moment his eyes came open and he come up out of the barber chair with half of a shave half of a haircut with the barber's apron still on him and he run down the street seeing as good as anybody else why because it was by faith that he held on to the promise i can see so with this stripe see all of that faith healing movement and the word of the lord that we have the blessing of him being able to hear still today was pointing us to walking this walk by faith wasn't just about healing healing is still yours with his stripes we are healed it's a done finished work as much as the chastisement of our peace upon him as much as being bruised for our iniquities is upon him as much as being wounded for our transgressions but i can still look and see that i can't see my eyes still aren't open but i can look and see that i still am i'm carrying around this guilt and this shame by faith by faith look away by faith this is a walk of faith now god knew that humanity can be awfully stupid sometimes just ignorant we just we can be told over and over and over again you know sister flo the same things that you and me deal with today they dealt with in the time of jesus same kind of mind battles you know in the time of moses they still had the same kind of mind battles and quarrels with one another they still quarreled with their pastor in moses time yeah moses he led the people for so many years and there was once upon a time that they're walking around and around in the wilderness and they got thirsty they wanted something to drink and there was no water and so they chided moses moses he goes to the lord and the lord said smite the rock water comes out of the rock how many times that they were there in the wilderness and things weren't going the way that they thought to go and they would come to moses and they'd give moses a hard time about it and moses would go to the lord and the lord would give the answer moses would come back pray for the people we'd give them what they needed but this particular time the bible said that the people were chiding against god and against moses and god said i've had enough of it and so he sent fiery serpents among the people and when he sent fiery serpents among the people the people were bitten now something come to me the people were spewing venom and god chose venom to take care of the problem and so is these snakes fiery serpents are spewing venom the people come to moses moses you gotta do something about it moses goes to the lord now i suppose that the people were hoping that moses could go to the lord just as he did when pharaoh kept calling him back and saying all right moses i've had enough of the frogs get them out of here i've had enough of the flies get them out of here i've had enough of this no that's not the way god chose to do it this time he told moses i want you to create a brazen serpent i want you to put it on a pole and i want you to put it up before the people and if the people will look on that brazen serpent they'll live now these fiery serpents that were biting the people they were dying because of the venom that was going into their veins and i just wonder remember brother branham called him at times dr moses i wonder in all of his study in egypt if along the way uh there weren't some men or women there were doctors and nurses in the camp who had treated other snake bites along the way but this time their remedies did not work and so god chose to tell moses you make this brazen serpent and you put it on a pole now brother branham instructed us that that serpent were represented sin that was already judged remember he judged the serpent in the garden put it on its belly because the serpent was an upright creature it was uh more subtle than any creature of the field it had an intelligence and it was most likely a good looking creature but when it uh when in the garden it did beguile the eve god judged that serpent and said on the rest of your days you'll be on your belly so now the serpent is on the pole and all the people had to do in order to live was look now some of us have had coveted and the couch became a comfortable place and i just have a feeling these people that were bitten by a serpent and that venom that had gone into their veins they carried them into their tent and they were laying on their palate and all of the sudden somebody comes in and said hey asher you've been bitten but moses said that god instructed him to put this brazen serpent on a pole and all you have to do is go and look and you can live and you can be saved from this snake bite why that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard i'm too sick to get off of this couch that's idolatry we know that moses has already preached that that kind of stuff was idolatry and and and i don't feel good enough to get off this couch i'm going to lay right here and and you know what how many of them laid right there and died because the venom was in their system and doubt swirling all around them and [Music] memories of sermons that moses had already preached about idolatry and this looks like idolatry it looks so out of the question it looks like such a strange idea but here it is moses was instructed believe me people there were people in the camp who were just like i was on the couch who refused to get up off of the couch because they thought it was a dumb idea because they thought it was a foolish idea because it was not the way things had always been done they laid right there and they died and i'm convinced that when jesus died at calvary which became the the type of the shadow of the brazen serpent where all they had to do was look and they could live because it was an act of their faith to get up off of the couch and go look on the brazen serpent the sin that was already judged then christ jesus was put on the cross of calvary for my deliverance and for your deliverance and it wasn't just to save me from my sin that is the glorious part of this whole thing that jesus christ died to save me from my sin and i don't have to go to hell that isn't the whole story i am complete in him and just being saved from sin is not completion just being healed in the physical body is not completion he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed everything that i face in this life if i can look by faith to the cross of jesus christ to them that perish this preaching is foolishness but to those of us who are saved it is power to us it is dunamis to us it is something on the inside of us that excites us and it ignites us to go once again and look by faith into the word of god that he was wounded for my transgressions i don't have to keep paying for my transgressions you're not catholic i'm not catholic we don't have to do penance friend you don't have to do penance you have to do repentance and once there's repentance you can come back and once again look by faith at the cross and say he was wounded from my transgressions where i have transgressed the law of god all that stuff that the the the devil had written down in a book against me all of it was nailed to his cross and i don't have to carry it i am one who believes that the more than i can look to the cross then now understand when i say look to the cross i do not mean the execution poll i am looking to the finished work of calvary when jesus died at calvary he died for me he died for you so that i did not have to carry my transgressions i didn't have to carry my iniquities i don't have to go through this life without peace i don't have to go through life with a broken down body why are there so many people who are walking around with infirmities in their body i don't really know how to answer that but i know that jesus christ is still the healer and that when i pass from this life into the next one i'm not carrying any of that diseased body with me none of it is going with me because in that place there is only peace and joy and ecstasy of all kinds when we're there and and we we think we live in this life musicians can come i just want to say that we live in this life and we think about all of the enjoyment that we have in this life things that we do in this life that brings us enjoyment and and i heard a story yesterday brother brannan was relating a story about him hunting with charlie cox and how they loved to go squirrel hunting and brother cox asked brother branham do you think that we'll go squirrel hunting in the millennium and brother branham said no i don't think so brother cox says well we enjoy it so much here i wondered if maybe we would do it in the millennium and brother branham said well first off there will be no blood and second he said brother cox if perhaps when you were first created you were created as a hog and then somehow by whatever you progressed until you became a human just given a what if scenario if you started out as a hog and you became a human he said would you ever want to go back to being a hog he said that's the way it'll be when we step into that realm all of this stuff we had as humans that we enjoyed here it'll feel like hog and we're stepped into a new place where none of that will even matter friends all of these things that we experience down here that's exactly the way that it's going to be but i am here preaching to you that the cross of jesus christ the finished work at calvary was for us to experience the goodness of god to humanity while we live in a human body otherwise there would have been no need for him to come and suffer like that in a human body he did it so that he could experience it he could relate it to us he wanted us to know that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed he bore our griefs he carried our sorrow and as we look with greater faith toward the finished work of calvary it's still foolishness the preaching of the cross is still foolishness to those that perish but day by day the preaching of the cross the finished work of calvary all that it represented all that it entailed all that it brought for the believer it to us it is power it is it is power stacked on top of power stacked on top of power on top of power because we recognize that jesus christ did it for us because he desired that the very life of jesus christ would be evident and displayed on the earth once again let's stand let's try to sing he knew me oh praise god by faith friends look to calvary i'm not on an ego trip i'm nothing on my own i make mistakes i often slip just carbon flesh and bone but i'll prove someday just what i say i'm of a special kind when he was on the cross i was on his mind oh he knew me yes he loved me [Music] he whose glory makes the heavens shine [Music] so unworthy [Music] of such mercy [Music] when he was on the cross i was on his mind [Music] the look of love was on his face the thorns were on his head the blood was on that scarlet robe [Music] stained crimson red though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked ahead in time for when he was on the cross [Music] i was on his mind yes he knew me [Music] yet he loved me [Music] he whose glory makes the heavens shine [Music] of such mercy [Music] for when he was on the cross i was on is mine would you buy your heads today [Music] my lord still is on the mercy seat and if you're in this building and you have never called upon the lord asking him to cleanse you of your sin your transgression your iniquity [Music] he's here and willing all you have to do is by faith look to the promise look to the finished work of calvary and say lord i recognize that i'm a sinner perhaps you're watching this service on the internet and you've played church you've gone to churches nothing seemed to satisfy you you went from pillar to post and you ended up watching this service on the stream you recognize that you've never really said lord i'm sorry for my sin i'm sorry for my unbelief i'm sorry lord that i have transgressed your law and i come to you and i am asking you to forgive me of my sin and to wash me clean he'll come friend he's jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever all he's waiting for you to do is look away in faith look to jesus the author and finisher of your faith by faith say lord i receive the sacrifice of calvary i accept it what about some of you believers that have been following the lord a long time [Music] and there has been a a heavy weight upon you of something that you just could not get over and you've carried it and carried it and carried it i don't know what it might be might be something that you felt responsible for somebody got hurt you feel the responsibility for it and you've carried the weight and it has made you gray-headed and wrinkled it has caused you to have heart palpitations and it has caused you to have all kinds of health issues because you carried it for so long friend i want to tell you today that jesus bore it to calvary he bore your sorrow he bore your grief to calvary and he wants you to get out from under that weight so that you can live a life of overcoming you can live a life where that you can spread joy and cheer where there is none around you [Music] oh there are some or some that carry such a dark cloud over them and everywhere they walk they suck the life out of the atmosphere friend i am calling on you by faith to look away to calvary the finished work of jesus christ and lay it right down there today jesus already bore it to calvary all of that stuff that you did not have the power over you don't have power to cleanse yourself from it friend i as a preacher do not have power to cleanse you from it but i'm here today to tell you there's life there's life in the blood of jesus christ that is still renewing strength and encouraging believers today look away to jesus now father you see every one of these those that are here that are heavy they're still carrying god that we trespass against your law and sometimes we have to pay a price for many years we have to we have to deal with the the things that are left behind but oh god we can still walk as a believer overcoming daily still putting things right but overcoming daily walking in the joy of the lord not carrying the grief and sorrow of pastime god that's who you are to walk in joy and strength they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mind they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint lord i thank you i was on his mind yes he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory makes the heavens shine so unworthy [Music] of such mercy oh when he was on the cross i was on his mind [Music] there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord [Music] let us dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy unto the lord dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy unto the lord there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh there is joy joy joy in the presence

lord dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy unto the lord [Music] i just realized that for many uh that might not be familiar with the story that i left david hanging after he had sinned and the prophet came to him and revealed his sin to him and you can read psalm 51 because david repented and he came clean before the lord and he said in verse 7 purged me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sin and blot out all mine iniquity create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and restore unto me renew a right spirit renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy holy presence take not away thy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit oh there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh let us dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy to the lord dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy unto the lord oh there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh there is joy joy joy in the presence of the lord singing hallelujah amen oh let us dance and celebrate dance and dance for joy unto the lord [Music] dance and celebrate dance and celebrate dance for joy unto the lord hallelujah [Music] [Applause] when you recognize what jesus christ did for us at calvary that we can look by faith listen as john ryan had to do you're gonna have to keep confessing it
