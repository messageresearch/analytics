With my mouth I will make known thy faithfulness &gt;&gt; to all generations. For I have said, "Mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou established in the very heavens, and the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord. Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. Oh Lord, God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? Or to thy faithfulness round about thee? Thou rulest the raging of the sea. When the waves thereof arise, thou stilllest them. &gt;&gt; Thou hast broken Egypt in pieces, as one that is slain. Thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. The heavens are thine, the earth, the earth also is thine. As for the world, and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them. The north and the south thou hast created them. Tabler and her Hermmon shall rejoice in thy name. Thou hast a mighty arm. Strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand. JUSTICE AND JUDGMENT are the habitation of thy throne. Mercy and truth shall go before thy face. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. In thy name they shall rejoice all the day. And in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. For thou art the glory of their strength. And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted. For the Lord is our defense and the Holy One of Israel is our King. Hallelujah. Lord, we give you praise today. Lord, [screaming] we give you praise today. [music] Great is thy faithfulness, oh Lord. Great is thy faithfulness in all the earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, we praise you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to the name of the Lord. He is more than enough. &gt;&gt; As we approach him in prayer, do you have a need you just like to lift your hand? Say, "Lord, I have a need I need you to meet." He is well able to do it. Would you remember my father-in-law to the Lord? [clears throat] At 90 years of age, he struggles getting up out of a chair to walk 20 feet [music] before he's he's exhausted. And it seems that his time is very near. We don't really know, but God does. We don't want him to suffer. And I know God is a healer. &gt;&gt; Luke and his family are in need of the Lord today. The children are still fighting sicknesses, this stuff that keeps going around, but God is still our healer. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Would you remember Sister Flo to the Lord? She wasn't well yesterday, but she wanted to show up for Jesse, and she needs our prayers today for strength and to get through what she's going through. Benjamin and Jenna and Elelliana are leaving this afternoon for Washington State, and we want to ask the Lord to give them traveling mercies, grace, and protection, and there are many others who are yet to travel home. Yes. &gt;&gt; We want the Lord to let angels line the highways &gt;&gt; and take them safe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And if you run out of things to pray for, pray for Pap and Nana, &gt;&gt; cuz [snorts] we're going to have a rough 10 days without our baby girl. [laughter] God, &gt;&gt; I don't even remember life before [snorts] her. to you out across that camera. We may not know your name. We may not know your location, your sickness, the trouble you're going through. &gt;&gt; But our Lord, he does. &gt;&gt; He knows your name. He knows the hairs of your head. He knows the trouble you face. And he knows how to meet that need. &gt;&gt; And we remember you as we go to prayer today. sing this old chorus as we're getting ready to pray. Thank you, Lord. Sweep over my [singing and music] soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [music] Oh, my [singing] rest is [music] complete while I sit [singing] at your feet. [music] Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Brother Hawk, will you come and pray today, [music] please? Sweep over [singing] my [music] soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit. Sweep over [singing] my soul. [music] My rest is [singing] complete. [music] While I sit at your feet, sweet spirit, [singing and music] sweet, &gt;&gt; heavenly father, we're coming together in this moment to honor you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And to bless you because you are worthy. &gt;&gt; We're gathered in this place. We come from many directions and many backgrounds, &gt;&gt; but you have been faithful and you revealed yourself to us &gt;&gt; and we're so thankful for redemption. &gt;&gt; Yes. Even before we were born, we were chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; for redemption, for eternity to be a part of you. I'm so thankful for this time &gt;&gt; of redemption because I'm gonna carry that all the way into eternity and I'm going to remember your faithfulness and your love to lay down your life for me &gt;&gt; for sure &gt;&gt; because you love me. &gt;&gt; I'm a simple creature. I just want to know that I have a dad, a heavenly father &gt;&gt; that loves me and cares for me &gt;&gt; and that is leading me along because he has a plan. And I thank you also today that you have made provision for everything in our lives. Some need healing in their bodies. But through that atonement laying down of your life that precious price of your blood, it is already done. So we just speak healing into everybody that is needing healing right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We lift Sister Joseph's dad, &gt;&gt; her father to you, Lord. You know his life, every days of his life was in are in your hands. But we just pray comfort, strength, and peace to him and all their families &gt;&gt; for all the children that are fighting sickness. Everyone that is fighting sickness in this room, we just speak to the symptoms of sickness to leave in the authority of Jesus Christ. But Father, most of all, today in this moment, may your perfect plan unfold. Would you speak to us? Would you do something for our lives? &gt;&gt; There are things in our lives that we have tried so hard to fix or change. But we invite &gt;&gt; you to come into our lives. We say yes and we surrender. &gt;&gt; Would you come and and do for us [music] that we can't do for ourselves? &gt;&gt; That is who you are. We're dependent on you and your ability and your spirit in our lives. And we just commit everything that we are, our whole being &gt;&gt; to you right now &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat today. What a wonderful crowd in the house of the Lord today. We honor you. We thank you for being here. And if I start calling names, I'm sure to not know one of you or two of you or three of you. But all of our friends from the Indiana Fellowship, we're glad that you're here. You came down for the wedding. We're glad that you stayed and may the Lord bless you. [applause] The Hefernon family came in this as uh Cad's mom and dad and brother and sister. We're glad that they're here in the service today. [applause] Some of Sister Martha's family still here or traveled back, I understand, to be in the service today. We bless you and honor you for that and are glad that you're in the house of the Lord with us. [applause] I know that we have a representation from Wyoming sitting here in the back. We're glad that you stayed over to be in the service today, came for the wedding. We're glad that you're here. And then we have the newlyweds that came today. Jesse and Roa, brother and sister Washington, we're glad that you're in the service today. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; It says a lot. &gt;&gt; It does.

I know we have Missouri represented here. We have Texas represented here. What other states? Alabama, Indiana, we've already mentioned. Is that all? &gt;&gt; And a real a realist cousin uh on on Sister Teresa's side, Austin, is here. &gt;&gt; Austin, you let's see. I think you're in Missouri, too, right? And Lily and Aaliyah from Missouri. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're glad that all of you are here. &gt;&gt; We're glad that Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; If he's not here, what's the worth in coming? &gt;&gt; But I'm glad that whether I'm here, whether I'm at home or I'm traveling down the road, he's with me &gt;&gt; because he lives inside of me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother Kate is going to uh he's going to continue to lead us in worship to the preaching of the word. We're getting our hearts ready for that. Uh continuing to get our hearts ready. If you waited till you got here to ask the Lord to speak to you, that was probably a little too long to wait. We should be asking the Lord to speak to us before we ever get here. But we're glad that he answers our prayer and and he can show up in a moment's time. I'm thankful for that. Uh we're going to receive the tithe and the offering. Uh the the year 2026 uh 2025. Let's not rush things. 2025 is coming to an end and we will make an offering bag available on Tuesday night since it will be the last time we'll be together for 2025. Uh we'll not make a spectacle of it, but we will make it available if you didn't bring an offering or tithe with you that you feel like that you need to have credit for in 2025. Uh let's see. Wednesday is the last day of the year and so if you uh give online and you want to have credit beh for 2025, it will have to be timestamped before midnight on uh the 31st.

Oh, yes, we [music] believe for it. From the impossible, we'll see a miracle. God, [music] we believe. Oh, yes, we believe. for it, God. [music] We believe. Oh yes, we believe for it. &gt;&gt; We believe, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your children believe THAT YOU ARE THE same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe he is the same? Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know he is. &gt;&gt; You may be seated today. It is a wonderful privilege to have you in the house of the Lord. I want to say with brother Gley that it's a great honor that his presence is here. &gt;&gt; We are guaranteed it because we brought him with us when we came. But when we join together in a corporate way like this, it just sort of magnifies the intensity of what we carry in him. And I feel him here today. &gt;&gt; It's not about feeling. I know that. But it's about faith. &gt;&gt; But there's nothing wrong with feeling him. &gt;&gt; Not at all. We just can't live by those feelings. We have to live by the word. But it's all right to be quickened. &gt;&gt; The Bible said you'll know you're saved because of the quickening &gt;&gt; in your spirit, in your inner man. It's resurrection life on the inside of the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not religion. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but religion has failed me. &gt;&gt; It's not about religion. It's about relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's about falling in love with Jesus. There's a lot of religious folk &gt;&gt; who've never fallen in love with him. &gt;&gt; And so for them, it's about being in a box and it's about keeping a rule. And it's about it, you know, just being just like like the order of of the house, whatever that is. But it's more than that. When you fall in love with him, you want to please him. &gt;&gt; And you don't just think about it twice a week when you're in church, do you? But you wake up every day and say, "Lord, direct my feet today. direct my my big mouth today, Lord, &gt;&gt; and let it be words that would bring life. If correction is needed, let me speak it. But let me speak it from a place of love &gt;&gt; instead of a place of condemnation. &gt;&gt; Wasn't it a beautiful wedding yesterday? &gt;&gt; Wasn't that special? &gt;&gt; Uh the presence of the Lord was here as brother Gley mentioned or brother Hawk when he was praying. I think we we gathered here yesterday. uh people from all kinds of backgrounds, all kinds of places, and uh our love for Jesse and Roa brought us together as one. And our love for the Lord created a beautiful atmosphere here for a wedding. &gt;&gt; And the meal was amazing. and the and the the decorating and all the work that you sisters uh uh aided Sister Martha and her family, all that you folks that got behind and served and did all the things that you did. Um well, it just makes me a pretty proud papa. I'll tell you, I sit back and I watch and I think, you know, it's so beautiful for brethren to dwell together &gt;&gt; in unity. And uh if there's any division among us, well, we want the Lord to give us the grace to fix that &gt;&gt; there's a healing bomb in Gilead. Do you believe that? Well, I don't have a lot of singing voice this morning and we've had a lot of singing and I've enjoyed every minute of it, but I and I almost thought I would wait uh for a week, but there's a very special friend of mine who's streaming the service today. And there were many years that we didn't have any contact with one another whatsoever. And there were there were uh there were some hurts and there were some disappointments that we probably had with one another. But God is a God of restoration and redemption. And it just amazes me at how God can bring things around. And that particular friend of mine has had a an an extra difficult time the last few weeks. It breaks my heart when someone says to me, "I just want to go to sleep and I don't really care whether I wake up or not." Well, that that puts me on the prayer bones, you know, because I I think that the enemy would he'd like to maybe weigh every one of us down with that kind of depression and hopelessness. And when I when I got the message, well, I began to pray. And I know others that knew the the need were praying. And God moved. He moved. &gt;&gt; And he may have to move again and again and again, but he moved &gt;&gt; and lifted her heart. And I'm so thankful for that. And she asked for me to sing this song. And even though she's not here, she's on the other end of that camera in a state quite away from here. And if I mess it up or if Cade messes it up, I'll do it again another time. I'm afraid I'll have to have the words for sure. You may be [singing] down and feel like God has somehow forgotten. That you are faced with circumstances you can't [singing] get through. Right now [music] it seems that there's [singing] no way out and you're going under. But God's [music] proven time and time again he'll take [music] care of you and he'll do it again for [music] you. God will do it again if you'll just [music] take a look at where [singing] you are now and where you've [music] been. Hasn't [singing] he always come through for you? Well, he's the same now as then. You [music] may not know how. You may not know when. But he'll do it again. [singing] You see, God knows the [music] things that you're going through and he knows how you're hurting. You [music] see, he knows just how your heart has been broken in [music] two. But he's the God of the of the sun in the sea. And he is [music] your father. You see, he can calm the [music] storm in your soul. He'll fix this for you. [music] And he'll do it again [singing] for you. God will do it. I've seen him do it. And I know he'll do it again if you'll just take a look at where you [music] stand now. Remember where you've been. [singing] Hasn't [music] he always come through for you? [music and singing] Well, he's the same now as then. You may not know how. You may not know [music] when, but he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You see, he's still God and he will not fail you. Oh, I know he's still God [music] and he's fighting for you. [singing] Oh, I know [music] that he's God and he [music] will not change. [singing] Just like Moses, just like Daniel, just like [music] Shadrach and Mack and Abednego, [singing] God will do it again [music] for you. He'll do it again. [music] Does anybody believe he can if you'll just take a look at where you are now? And where you man, hasn't he always [music] come through? Well, he never changes. Oh, you may not know how. You may not know when, [music] but he'll do it again. Oh, he's still God. And he will not fail [music] you. I know he won't. Oh, he's still God and he's fighting [music] for you. Oh, I know he is God and he will [music] not change. [singing] Just like Moses, [music] just like Daniel, just like Shadrach and Me [music] and Abednego, [singing] God will do it again. [music] Sing it with me. Lord, do you hear them? I believe you will if you'll just take a look at where you are now and where you've been. [music] Hasn't he always [singing] come through for you? Well, he's the same now [music] as then. You may not know [music] how. You may not know when, but he'll do it again. You may not know how. You may not [music] know when. You may not know how. You may not [music] know when. But I know he'll do it again. [singing] [music] My God will do it again. [singing] [music] Amen. Amen. He will. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. Rachel, he will. Just keep trusting him. He will. He's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You, if you'll stand with me, we're going to the word. Now you know why I don't sing it so often. It's a lot. Um, and by the way, the mistake was mine. Would you give Kate a good clap and thank him? And the rest of these all of these musicians what we do unto the Lord, we ought to do with the best of our ability &gt;&gt; with all the strength that we have. &gt;&gt; I believe that &gt;&gt; maybe to some it looks like putting on or maybe to others it might look showy. But I want you to know that we have been taught and trained throughout our life. If you're going to do it for God, give him all you got, do it the best you can because he deserves what you can give him and a whole lot more. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I don't come to church to sleep. Uh I don't come to church to observe. &gt;&gt; I come to church, whether I'm ministering or not, to worship the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Lord of Lords. And he's more worthy than we we often remember. We're going to the word of God. I'd like for you to turn there with me. I'll give you the address in just a moment. He's such a faithful, loving savior. Would you go [snorts] with me to Leviticus chapter 18 and we're going to read verse 30. [snorts] Let me just say again how wonderful it is to have you here. sitting at the table yesterday with Sister Martha's family on one side and in one end and Jesse's family on the other and none of us really have known each other. There's always that little awkwardness. I am extremely awkward at meeting new people, but there was just a wonderful piece there. I like it that way. Jesse's grandmother, who I have seen only a few times, she looked across the table and she said, "You know, uh, I used to hear you preach at at Gerard Church in Phoenix City." And I said, "I certainly never knew that." The church when I was in that building was was not called Gerard. It was called Calvary Temple, but that was the old Gerard building. and she said, 'I heard you many times and enjoyed it very much and never knew it. Seeing her, she never mentioned it. And then Jesse's boss and uh his employer, I guess you should say. I'm not very dignified. You can tell his boss man and his lovely wife and four amazing, handsome boys were here at the wedding yesterday. And I am blessed to have the desk that belonged to her dad. and brother Bobby Freeman who pastored in this area for many years and passed away so unexpectedly and uh the Lord made a way for me to have his desk and they were here and we had wonderful fellowship up here after the reception they mentioned they'd like to see the desk it meant a lot to them that it was being used continue to be used for the work of the Lord so we brought them uh in and we just had a great time of fellowship and I'm thinking if Jesse and Roa hadn't got married. Well, we wouldn't have had that opportunity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, thank you all for bringing together kind of an eclectic group of people. We seem to collect that kind around here. I believe God has a lot of folks like that, don't you? &gt;&gt; If everybody acted the same and uh had the same background, it'd be mighty boring in the kingdom. But I'm glad that God's got jewels from all walks of life and from all religious streams. &gt;&gt; And we're all just trying hard to press into him &gt;&gt; because we sense that the end is upon us. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you don't. &gt;&gt; But we sense that we're coming to the end of of it all &gt;&gt; and we're ready. I want you to know, you better you better know that you're ready tonight &gt;&gt; when you put your head on the pillow. I know that some in the who have come from the Anabaptist stream were taught in their early life that you cannot know. And to know that you're saved is pride. But the scripture tells us we can know. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We must know. &gt;&gt; We must have confidence that the blood of Jesus Christ is enough. Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the color of your window shade. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that is here nor there. &gt;&gt; You can you can choose according to the community where you are. But remember that it's only by the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ that we're saved. Not by a woman's long hair. No, &gt;&gt; not by her skirt. not not by a by a man, you know, trying to be a little more uh modest than the world uh would prefer. It's not about those things. That's not what saves us. &gt;&gt; We live a separated life because we have been redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to be a light and a witness of what the power of God can accomplish in somebody's life. But don't ever trust in those things &gt;&gt; for your salvation. It's only only through the precious gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not your uniform, &gt;&gt; but your relationship. &gt;&gt; Leviticus 18:30. Therefore shall you keep mine ordinance, that you commit not any of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, that you defile, and that you defile not yourselves therein. I am the Lord your God. He reminds us that we are in the world but not of the world. &gt;&gt; Can you follow that? &gt;&gt; Let's let's catch just one more portion just a small one. Luke chapter nine, red letters, the words of our Lord. Verse 23. And he said to them all, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself. You know that sounds easy until you have to do it. &gt;&gt; Let him deny himself and take up his cross &gt;&gt; daily. How are you going to deny yourself? It's a daily It's a daily walk. &gt;&gt; This walk with Christ is not a oneandone. It's a daily walk. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. &gt;&gt; Take up his cross daily and do what? &gt;&gt; Follow me. Not the church, not the pastor, not the prophet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Follow me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'll follow him, you'll follow his word and everything will be all right. &gt;&gt; Father, we come to you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are helpless and hopeless without you. All of our doing, all the labor and effort this morning would all be in vain if we weren't doing it unto you. It would be no more than a show. It would be no more than just a concert or a performance of some kind. But when we do it unto you with you in mind, desiring to please you, it becomes worship in your sight. And it's beautiful to you because you are a jealous God. You tell us and you want our affection and our attention to be focused on you. And and truthfully, Lord, that's a privilege. It's a privilege to look away to Jesus today. We're looking away to you believing that you'll minister to hearts from your word before we leave today. And all the glory and all the praise and all the honor, Lord, let it be unto you. Let it be upon you for everything [clears throat] that is accomplished today. We ask for this grace in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the saints said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. We are in a study, you visitors that are here, we are in a study for several months now on the life of Samson. And uh maybe there are those who would like for us to get off of Samson and get on to something else, but there's so much in this beautiful story about Samson. He was born for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He was born for a reason. He was born responsible to begin the deliverance of the children of Israel from out from under the oppression of the Philistines. &gt;&gt; We realize that IT WAS GOD HIMSELF who handed Israel over to her enemy. &gt;&gt; For 40 years, God said, "I'm going to show you what it's like to do it without me. I'm going to place you in the hand of the Philistines and they are going to harass you and mock you and trouble you and give you all kind of uh trials and hard things to go through. And hopefully at the end of that 40 years, you'll serve me with a passion that you never have before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of that, I'm going to raise up a champion. And he's going to be an unusual sort of fellow. My hand is going to be on him &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make him a Nazerite from his mother's womb and I'm going to require even that his mother live a dedicated and consecrated life while he's growing in her belly. This is instruction that that we don't have in any other place in the scripture. But God was so investing himself in the life of Samson and preparing him for a job that needed to be done. And you know the story. We've been teaching it piece by piece. God gave him supernatural strength. A prophet tells us that he was not a a musclebound giant. He didn't look like Tony Atlas. It you could have seen him and he might would have looked rather ordinary. the Bible story books, they like to to picture him, you know, as a mighty man. He could lift the house on his shoulder or something along those lines. But his strength was not in his brawn. &gt;&gt; His strength was not in his muscles. His strength was in the power of almighty God that had called him and commissioned him and given him a purpose for the kingdom. He was going to begin the deliverance of the children of Israel out from under the hand of the Philistines. When God showed up to Monoah and his wife, he showed up in a supernatural way. He showed up in a fire. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? The angel of the Lord, not an angel, not one of a multitude, the angel of the Lord, the angel of the covenant of the Lord, came and appeared to them and told them what was about to take place. They they built an altar. They offered an offering unto the Lord and the fire of God came down on that altar and lifted that offering right up into the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; That's that's a pretty big production, I would say. And Samson from that moment on was consecrated to be uh a Nazerite. You've got to stay away from the vine, from wine, from raisins, from grapes, anything having to do with the vine. And you cannot come near a dead carcass, Numbers tells us. And uh then the third requirement is he would never be allowed to cut his hair, which is certainly an unusual arrangement that God had with this Nazerite vow. It worked. As long as Samson lived under the covenant, &gt;&gt; it worked. All he had to do was shake himself. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the spirit of the Lord moved mightily. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hebrew, it says violently upon him. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the sweet spirit, you know, a a sweet, wonderful, warm feeling. It was the mighty raw power of God almost more than a mortal body could take. Sometimes that spirit of the Lord may move in a service where you are and you may not understand the way people behave. But I want you to know there's a power that's bigger that's more potent than anything that we could experience in our everyday life. And we need him. It's not an it. &gt;&gt; We need him. &gt;&gt; We need to know that he's there. And we need to know that we've surrendered &gt;&gt; to our purpose. You were born for a reason. &gt;&gt; You were born with a why. &gt;&gt; I would guess that your why has something to do with the kingdom of God. And you may be running in another direction today. But I want you to know God can run faster than anybody. He said, "IF YOU WERE TO MAKE YOUR BED IN HELL, I know where to find you. &gt;&gt; If you were to take THE WINGS OF A DOVE AND TRY TO FLY AWAY from my presence, I know exactly how to bring you right down when I'm ready to do something for you. I don't know about you, but it thrills my heart to know that this mighty God, that little part of the chorus we sang today, what a God. What a God. When I when I sing that, when I think that, my heart warms because there is no God like unto our God. The psalmist said, &gt;&gt; "He's the one true living God. There are other gods with a small G out there. &gt;&gt; They are objects of worship. They're idols. They're not real, &gt;&gt; but nonetheless, they're treated and honored and respected as gods. But among everything that is worshiped on planet earth today, there is a living God. &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the OLD IS JESUS CHRIST of the new. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT TWO GODS. THERE'S ONE GOD. &gt;&gt; He manifested HIMSELF AS FATHER, AS SON, and as holy ghost, but of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; And of the same essence. When Mary was overshadowed, it wasn't the father that overshadowed her. The scripture said it was the Holy Spirit that overshadowed Mary and yet the father was his father. &gt;&gt; When you read that, you begin to understand there's a mystery here that's being revealed and unveiled. And if you can catch that, you've got some extra ammunition to use against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of people sing about him and talk about him and witness about him, but they've never met him. They don't really even know who God is. Brother Shelley, is it important to know who God is? You're mighty right. It's important to know who he is. And if you don't know who he is, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SERVE. &gt;&gt; And you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING. And you don't understand what he requires out of you. I PROMISE YOU THIS MORNING, you're not here to be your own man. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not here to be your own woman. You're here at this time for a purpose and for a reason, and that is to glorify God, your creator. SO WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER? WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER TODAY? WHY DON'T WE MAKE UP OUR MIND? I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE ANOTHER ordinary day on planet Earth serving sin and self. BUT I'M GOING TO SERVE THE living God, the creator of all mankind, the only one that promises something beyond the grave. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I I uh we will gather here Tuesday night at 6:00 to pay tribute to a a child of God. Uh 88 89 89 years on this planet, served the Lord the majority of her life. As much as we loved her and as much as we cared about her, we couldn't perhaps move on in the natural if that was it. But do you know what keeps us moving forward? Knowing that this is just a momentary parting &gt;&gt; because we're going to see her again &gt;&gt; AND SHE'LL BE WHOLE AND SHE'LL BE YOUNG &gt;&gt; AND SHE'LL BE MAGNIFYING THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Sounds like a fairy tale to me." Well, I don't believe it is. I believe it's more real than the atmosphere we're building in this house even today. It's more real than the air we breathe and the food we eat. &gt;&gt; And he's been good to us when we were serving sin. &gt;&gt; He still protected us many times. &gt;&gt; He watched over us many times though we were running in an opposite direction. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Didn't he do it? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I don't know if he did or not." Well, you're here, aren't you? &gt;&gt; He brought you a mighty long way. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. And it may be that only in the last hours or years or moments of your life that you fully surrender to him. But I want you to know it's worth it all. &gt;&gt; It's worth it all to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that when you laid your head on the pillow tonight, you're born again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you're ready to meet the Lord. Not because you're following the church fathers, not because you're obeying the restrictions and requirements, but because you have entered in to a relationship, to a relationship with Jesus Christ, to know him, to feel his heart, to feel his heartbeat, to know that he has a mind, to know that he has a will, TO KNOW THAT HE HAS A purpose for us in these last days. Brother, that's why I get out of bed every morning &gt;&gt; is to give him everything I have. &gt;&gt; I want to give him all give it all to him. He's worthy of it. In order to do so, Jesus said, "If you're going to come after me, you're going to have to deny yourself. You're going to have to be delivered from your own selfishness, and you're going to have to follow me." Now, when we were not serving the Lord, we were selfish. And some of us, even though we uh, you know, play serving the Lord, we're still selfish. And God said through Jesus in this scripture, if you're going to follow me, you're going to have to deny yourself. And nobody really likes the concept. But I want you to know, if you're willing to lay down your will and take his will, he'll fill you with his love divine. &gt;&gt; He'll fill you with the Holy Spirit. He'll put a fire down in your heart and he'll lead your footsteps and direct your life and you can live in his favor and in his pleasure. &gt;&gt; It's not about living to the church. It's about living unto him. &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; Uh I want to read just a quotation or two concerning this one is found in a message called At Thy Word uh 1950. A person who lives their life for their self lives a selfish life. We must I'm going to let you read it. &gt;&gt; We must live for others. You know, sometimes people get in some kind of a rut and they like to think that they're living for others, but you don't have to be around them very long to find out that everything and anything, all of it just comes back to them, &gt;&gt; how it's affecting them &gt;&gt; and how it makes them feel. But I want you to know, it's a daily walk and it's a daily laying down and it's a daily dying. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we continue to do that, we're coming to a place where we can truly say, I live every day for somebody else because I want my life to speak to somebody else. I want the way I conduct my business to be a witness to somebody else. &gt;&gt; When I'm in the Walmart and brother, I don't go maybe once a year and sometimes not even once in a year. That's a circus. I believe that it you you sisters can really be a light down at Walmart. I'll be outside praying for you. It It's worse than the freeway at getting off time. Those buggies going every which way. They'll plow you over. They wear their pajamas. They forget to put their teeth in sometime. [clears throat] They're just running around with with with some sort of purpose and yet no purpose whatsoever. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THE NEXT MEAL TOGETHER, the next birthday party together, the next something else together, and they're not many times even conscience. They they don't even recognize that the end is upon us. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not going to preach fear to you, &gt;&gt; but the end IS UPON US. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE AGES IS breaking forth in this hour. &gt;&gt; And the world is more insane and matter and wilder than it's ever been. And the heathen will continue to rage. And what happens out there, IT MUST NOT AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS in here. But what God does for US IN HERE, IT MUST CERTAINLY AFFECT WHAT'S HAPPENING out there. AND THE ONLY WAY IT CAN IS FOR us to take this with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not our four and no more. And it's not the boundaries of the four walls of this church that we're concerned about. It's getting this life outside this building. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to do that in line at if you're brave enough to eat at McDonald's. I'm not, but if you are, it's in the line there that you're going to be able to be a light. &gt;&gt; It's in the line at the gas pump. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's there that you're going to be able to be a light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, the world is out for themselves. It's obvious to see. And here comes a Christian. Here comes a child of God &gt;&gt; who says, "I'm sorry you didn't charge me for this item and I want to pay you." And they look at you like you've got three heads. You know why? Because the world doesn't behave that way anymore. Especially here in the deep south, hospitality used to rule and reign and people were good and nobody locked their doors and and everybody tried to do good for others and if you lost a loved one, every neighbor on the street made a casserole. But we're living in a different hour now where people are serving self. They're caught up in the mad race of the end time and they don't even know it. &gt;&gt; They're more excited about the trappings of Christmas and other things. more excited about the hustle and bustle than they are the real meaning of it all. And that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever in a message just simply called Christ. He talks about Abel. He said and Abel slew his lamb on the rock and Abel died. This is the key right here. AND ABEL DIED ON THE SAME rock &gt;&gt; with his lamb. THE LAMB DIED PHYSICALLY, BUT ABEL had to die to self. &gt;&gt; We're told that Abel had this one little lamb that he had sort of made a pet out of, and he'd given it more care and more attention, and he loved it more than all the rest of the lambs. He did what a farmer's not supposed to do. He chose a favorite. And when it come time to give God an offering, all that Cain could think of was his garden. And so he tries to give God the fruit of the earth. Maybe potatoes, maybe tomatoes, maybe turnipss for all I know. But all all that we can learn from scripture is that it wasn't turnups or or tomatoes or potatoes that God was looking for. &gt;&gt; He was looking for blood. &gt;&gt; A total sacrifice. The taking of a life. It was following a precedent that started in the garden much earlier when Adam and Eve failed God. The scripture tells us clearly that Adam was not deceived. Eve was the one who was deceived, but Abel willingly partook of her sin because he wanted to stand with her. And the New Testament tells us that this is a beautiful type of Christ who knew no sin, but who stepped in and took our sin upon him that we could have everlasting and eternal life. I'm pretty excited about that. &gt;&gt; So, Cain brings his his garden produce and Abel recognizes that he's going to have to bring a lamb. And I wonder as he stood out over that little herd of his, I wonder if he was looking for one that he might not care for as much as the other. But something in his heart kept drawing him back and telling him, "The God of all eternity and creation deserves the best. &gt;&gt; The chosen lamb, the most special one, the one THAT MEANS THE MOST TO YOU." And Abel knew what he had to do. He took an old grape vine, perhaps we're told, and wrapped it around the little lamb's neck and led him over to the altar. Takes a sharp rock, and I don't want to make you nauseous, but I want you to see the reality of the moment. He takes that sharp rock and he starts digging at the at the jugular vein of the little lamb that he had nursed, that he had carried with him, that he had loved above all the other lambs. And he starts striking that little lamb. The little lamb looks up at him. No doubt you've heard this kind of thing. LITTLE EYES LOOKING UP AT HIM. And that little pleading sound is that small little pleading sound that can come and he knows I I CAN'T STOP NOW. I'VE GOT TO FINISH THE JOB. BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US THAT in in that bloody MOMENT OF AN OFFERING, NOT ONLY was the rock altar covered with blood, and not ONLY WAS THE LITTLE LAMB BLOODY, but so was the one offering the lamb. &gt;&gt; It wasn't JUST THE LAMB THAT GOT BLOODY, ABEL GOT BLOODY. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The rock got bloody. The offering got bloody. And the offerer, the one who would give the offering, got bloody. And he tells US HERE THAT NOT JUST THE LAMB DIED that day on the rock. Abel had to die on the same rock with his lamb. And every believer that COMES TO CHRIST MUST COME TO THE SAME CROSS OF self-denial and die there with the lamb, &gt;&gt; with his lamb. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you have a lamb? &gt;&gt; I'm not perfect. I never have been AND IN THIS CARNALITY MAY never be. But but I want you to know I have a perfect lamb, a perfect offering, a perfect sacrifice. And when I COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD, I DON'T BRING MY MERIT. I don't bring my worthiness. I bring the worthiness. Oh, just a minute. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave myself or visitors a little bit. I don't want to scare you too bad, but I'm feeling that thing that bubbles up on the inside OF THE INSIDE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO SHOUT, "HALLELUJAH. I KNOW THAT I'm redeemed." &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE I GET IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME. NOT BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK IT RIGHT OR EVEN SAY IT RIGHT, BUT I KNOW THAT I'M REDEEMED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE BLOOD OF MY LAMB WAS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS sufficient &gt;&gt; to pay the price. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Woo. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't like when people carry on. I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; I got I've got some news. I better go ahead and tell you now. It don't go to heaven &gt;&gt; because if you do, you're going to find out. We're not going to be sitting around through the countless ages with a diaper on playing the harp. People don't become cherubs. &gt;&gt; People don't become angels in eternity. &gt;&gt; They're redeemed &gt;&gt; saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; So don't be looking for me with a diaper. Oh my. Don't get that image. Don't be looking for me to spend eternity playing a harp wearing a diaper. No sire. I'M GOING TO BE GIVING PRAISE AND HONOR AND GLORY. NOW, I'M GOING TO DO IT AS LOUD AS MY NEW FORM WILL ALLOW me to. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOUT IT TO THE TOP OF MY AVAILABILITY. I WANT TO SHOUT, "WORTHY, worthy is the lamb." &gt;&gt; It's because HE'S WORTHY. IT'S BECAUSE HIS BLOOD IS SUFFICIENT. Then you and I can even make a decision today to deny ourselves &gt;&gt; to live unto him and die there with the lamb, with his lamb. die out to his own thoughts. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, church has been rough. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you be a little quiet. Church has been rough. There's hurts. There's disappointments. Preachers hurt us. Pastors hurt us. Church folks can hurt us. I've often said the worst hurt in the world. I think it's more than your own natural family letting you down when your spiritual family. It happens. It's bound to happen again. But we're not here today because of the church family. We're here today because the lamb is worthy. &gt;&gt; You see, religion will never satisfy. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You can do it all. I said a moment ago, you can tick off all the boxes and it won't give you the satisfaction that comes way down on the inside of the inside. And a lot of people would rather live in a box of religion than they had to have to enter into the scary world of relationship. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You can usually identify those people pretty quickly because they they're lousy at earthly relationships. You see, when you develop a relationship with Jesus Christ, it it spills over &gt;&gt; and you you begin to get better &gt;&gt; at your other relationships. &gt;&gt; You treat your wife a little better and your wife treats you a little better cuz she's had a touch. Come on. &gt;&gt; And you're a little kinder to your boss. And if he gets a little bit of God in him, he's a little kinder to you. &gt;&gt; You see, as you work on your relationship with Jesus, it affects the relationships that you have with each other. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you see somebody who's not very good with their earthly relationships, it's usually a tail a a tell sign that that something is a little bit a miss in their relationship with him. Don't you be a judge. But you can be an intercessor and you can pray, Lord, bring my brother, bring my sister into a place where they're fully dependent on you. It makes a difference, brother. It makes a difference, sister, when we become fully dependent on him. Die out to our own mental thinking. He said, JUST TAKE WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT says in your heart and live for Christ that day on Calvary. I'm just going to put the highlights of this. He said, but when you live your life to yourself, you haven't eternal life. Eternal life is living for others. It proved it when it come in the lamb of God. He lived had eternal life because HE DID NOT LIVE FOR HIMSELF. He lived for others. In the mighty conqueror, we read, "We'll never conquer as long as we're selfish." God hates sin and he will not let it triumph over wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's necessary for us to live different &gt;&gt; than the world around us. &gt;&gt; You see, Samson put himself in a compromising position over and over again. &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, the man born with a purpose, with a mighty anointing, with a supernatural announcement of his birth, with the spirit OF GOD MOVING MIGHTILY on him, SO MIGHTILY THAT HE TAKES A LION BY THE BEARD. Come on. TAKES A LION BY THE THROAT AND RIPS HIM APART like a goat. SOMEBODY SAID, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME that he didn't have all kinds of brawn and muscles." I am going to tell you that because it wasn't by his earthly strength &gt;&gt; that he was able to do that. It was the anointing. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of almighty God on him that gave him the strength. &gt;&gt; And then he did what he wasn't supposed to do. The church knows, we've already covered this. He did what he was not supposed to do. He made contact with the dead body afterward because bees had made some honey there. He took some of that honey and took it to his mom and dad. Couldn't tell him where it come from because if he did, they would know that he had broke his Nazarite vow. I know that's not foreign to everybody in this room. I know that somewhere in your life, there have been things you couldn't tell your mom and daddy either. Because if you did, you'd be telling on your own rebellion. You'd be telling on your own heart. Well, I want you to know sometimes you don't have to tell mama. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you something about this Jesus thing. HE'LL TELL [screaming] ON YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'LL TELL ON YOU. AND mom will just sometime look at and you get mad at your siblings. Who told her? I didn't tell her. I DIDN'T TELL HER. I DIDN'T TELL HER. WHO TOLD HER? SHE'S BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU. And sometime this I know it's happened in our own home. The spirit of THE LORD WOULD SPEAK TO mama and tell her and you may hate that in the moment. YOU YOU MAY THINK THAT'S THE MOST UNFAIR THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE. My goodness, why can't I have a normal mama that Jesus don't talk to and tell her things that's going on in my life? But let me tell you something. You'll live long enough, I pray, to recognize the beauty. &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEBODY WAS CALLING YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND CALL MY NAME. &gt;&gt; I'm not misbehaving to the best of my knowledge. I'm not sneaking around to the best OF MY KNOWLEDGE, BUT GO AHEAD AND CALL MY NAME EVERY TIME YOU THINK OF ME BECAUSE WE ALL NEED STRENGTH AND WE ALL NEED SOME PRAYER AND WE ALL NEED SOME ENCOURAGEMENT along the way. Thank God for a mother and a dad that'll call your name before THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR A GOD, &gt;&gt; AMEN, &gt;&gt; who will tell on you when you need to be told on. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, give us strength to guard this fragile, precious, valuable relationship that you have made available for man to have with his creator. There there's no way there's no way hardly to describe the beauty of it. Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; Let me give you just another little piece here in a message. Why little Bethlehem? [clears throat] He said in paragraph 80, "Oh, notice Israel received a new fresh bread every night coming down from heaven for their journey. Christ is our life, bread of life, and every day we receive freshness from Christ from heaven. The Holy Spirit coming down upon the believer." I wanted to read this because I want you to know it's a day by day by day by day by day by day. God said, "I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MANA. It's going to fall right out of the heavens and I'm going to send it to you fresh every day. I don't want you to store it up until the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; The day before the Sabbath, I want you to take a portion for that day and a portion for the Sabbath so that you don't have to gather on Sabbath. And then every other day, I want you to take one portion because God was setting a precedent for us that what he does for US TODAY is not enough. WE'RE GOING TO NEED HIS TOUCH AGAIN TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; We're going TO NEED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM ON Monday just like we did on Sunday. And that's not in a religious way. That's in a relationship. You can't serve him today and love him today and adore him today and forget about him all about him tomorrow. &gt;&gt; You'll starve. &gt;&gt; You'll fall like Samson. You'll defile your commitment and covenant unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has to be a consistent and a daily thing. Well, the children of Israel said it's working on on air of Shabbat the day before the Sabbath. It's working. So why wouldn't it work on a Tuesday and a Wednesday, let's say? And so some decided we'll go out and gather, you know, a man's always trying to figure an easier way to do everything and uh we'll just go out and gather two days supply and then tomorrow we won't have to do anything. Well, you know, God had already given them very specific instructions &gt;&gt; and they were certainly trying to move in their own head &gt;&gt; and in their own mind. And what did they find when they went to their supply? It had rotted. &gt;&gt; It had bred worms. The Bible said for for you that have strong stomachs, the rest of you don't hear, turn your ears off. For you that have strong stomachs, that's maggots. &gt;&gt; It had it had bread worms and it was stinking &gt;&gt; overnight. Because God said, "I don't want you to visit me every other day. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH ME every other day." &gt;&gt; And all HE WAS DOING WAS POINTING TO A DAY WHEN THE VEIL would be ripped. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND WHEN THE WAY WOULD BE OPENED UP and where you and I WOULD HAVE ACCESS, NOT ONCE A WEEK, not twice a week, NOT THREE TIME, EVERY DAY IF WE WANT IT. &gt;&gt; IF WE WANT IT, WE CAN HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST EVERY [screaming] DAY OF OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "You must have more time on your hands than I do." I'll tell you, it doesn't matter how busy or unusy your life is. The enemy will try to distract you. He'll try to pull you away. You'll start reading your Bible and the phone will ring. &gt;&gt; Especially you that have decided that you're going to read your electronic Bible for the rest of your life instead of the oldfashioned kind. I'm going to tell you there's less distractions in the leather one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'll just get you the real kind, the old kind, and put the other thing away for just a little while, because I'm telling you, the devil doesn't want you eating your daily bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't want us eating our daily meal. And I'm not just talking about reading it like a dry letter. &gt;&gt; Did you know to some the Bible is no more than a dead letter? &gt;&gt; But to others, it's living daily bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What makes the difference? Is it how you read? Is it the version you read? No, &gt;&gt; it's not how you read or the version you read. It's the relationship that you have with the God of the word. Right. &gt;&gt; If you have a relationship with the author of that book, then it's more than just a chore. &gt;&gt; It's like reading a a text. It's like getting a text from your best friend. &gt;&gt; It's like going to the mailbox and opening up a letter and it being from your very best friend in all the world and you just read. Folks, if we could learn as believers in the end time to talk to him in the manner that we would, the very best relationship that we have in the earth, the best friend, our our companion or or whoever it is that we feel the closest to. Uh sometimes we get caught up in the protocol of how we ought to address him and so we just fail to address him and all he wants us to do is reach for him. Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm a man. Somebody said, "I'M A MAN. I can't relate like that, folk." You can. &gt;&gt; You can if you will. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If you'll swallow your pride, &gt;&gt; and if you'll make up your mind, I can't live another day without a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You'll find out he wants to hear what you have to say. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT THAT HE'S NOT GOING to like? I do. &gt;&gt; I do. I have. &gt;&gt; I probably will again. &gt;&gt; And so far, not one single time has he ever smacked me between the eyes. &gt;&gt; I might have hurt his heart. I might have disappointed him with what I said or how I've behaved. But he doesn't quit loving me. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, I want to help you with that. You know that little flare? You know that little show out you had? You know that little meltdown? I know. I can tell by you holy people, you're so holy. I can just look at you and tell you're holy and a little deceptive because if you sit there and try to make me think that you don't ever say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, well, I can't I can't believe that because I know how my own flesh will operate. &gt;&gt; But I've got out from under the box of religion. And when I did, I found out that that one misstep is not going to rip me from the kingdom. &gt;&gt; ONE MISTAKE, EVEN ONE ONE UH UH UNWILL SIN, BECAUSE THERE ARE SINS OF COMMISSION and sins of omission. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU DO SOMETIME THAT GRIEVES THE HEART OF GOD. IT'S SOMETIMES WHAT WE DON'T DO that grieves his heart. That's right. &gt;&gt; But I FOUND OUT THAT THAT DOESN'T RIP ME OUT of his heart because I fail. In fact, he just wants to pull me in a little bit closer. &gt;&gt; You see, THE CLOSER YOU GET TO HIM, the less carnality, the less flesh flares &gt;&gt; you'll have because you'll begin to move with his heartbeat, &gt;&gt; with his desire. I tell you, God sent a truth in the last days, not to make robots out of people, &gt;&gt; but to show them the path of relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. to show them how to depend on him daily, daily bread, &gt;&gt; fresh. He said yesterday's experience. Many of us LIVE ON YESTERDAY'S EXPERIENCE. We mustn't do that. It's today's experience. IT'S WHAT GOD WILL DO FOR YOU NOW. He said they're living on that experience. But remember the BREAD THAT FELL, THEY TRIED TO KEEP IT OVER. IT GOT CONTAMINATED. Maggots got in it. Wiggle tails. And that's what's the matter today. contaminated sistns living on past bread that's contaminated. He said we must have something fresh from Christ. His word today FOR THIS HOUR. HE IS OUR FRESHNESS. HALLELUJAH. OUR BREAD THAT FALLS EVERY DAY FROM heaven upon the believer as a staff of life is called bread. Jesus being the bread of life is God's staff of eternal life. Bread to us. He'll feed you. We're used to saying, "Oh Lord, I'm hungry and I want to be fed. Oh Lord, I'm hungry and I want to be fed. Oh Lord, I'm hungry and I want to be fed. Oh, feed me all the days of my life. Oh, feed me, Jesus. Feed me. Feed me, Jesus. Feed me. Feed me all the days of my life. Feed me &gt;&gt; Jesus, FEED ME. &gt;&gt; OH, feed me, Jesus. Feed me. Feed me. &gt;&gt; He will. He does. He desires. I want you to look at Judges 14. In the time that we have left, do we have time left? Oh, we do. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. I I I told you folks to tell the visitors that we're here for a little while. Not quite as long as the Amish, though, but sometimes we get close. Judges chapter 16. Boy, that uh made a quiet moment, didn't it? Judges chapter 16, verse 4. And it came to pass afterward that [snorts] he loved a woman in the valley of Sorak, whose name was Delilah. And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, entice him, and see wherein his great strength lith, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him. and we will give thee every one of us,00 pieces of silver. I want you to know Delilah did not love Samson. &gt;&gt; She never loved him. She wasn't capable of loving him because she was for sale. You You better make sure that he's not for sale. You better make sure that she's not for sale. &gt;&gt; The highest bidder come along and offer them something else and they run off and leave you sitting right there. &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen too many times through the years. They thought there was love present. Delilah had no love for Samson and all that Samson ever really wanted was to be loved. And he was under this mistaken principle that if somebody will show me attention, I hope you'll listen now. &gt;&gt; I'll hurry. This is my hurry. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm taking this most serious. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because this is life or death to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This isn't what I do for a job. This is what I do for a living. It's what I do for a purpose and a reason and a why. I mean, I live to do this. &gt;&gt; And uh I know I was born for it. I'm not maybe good at it, but I know that I was born for it. &gt;&gt; And I know that I was first created to be a worshipper. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And everything else flows out of that. &gt;&gt; And I think you if you discover that you were born to be a worshshiper first, your service to the Lord will flow out of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you let the enemy intimidate you to praise him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't you let the devil intimidate you to say, "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." Well, I don't want to sound religious. Well, I don't want you to sound religious, but I want you to be sincere and free &gt;&gt; to praise God the way that your heart desires to praise him. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to make a spectacle of myself. I understand that totally and completely. But if you should ever find yourself in a house where people are all worshiping the Lord in spirit and in truth and recognize that nobody is even watching you &gt;&gt; because they have put all their focus on him, then I would encourage you in that moment to be yourself, to be who God really created you to be. And don't be ashamed to lift your hands up. I don't care if you put them here, here, or here. But I'll tell you, the more real it gets in your heart, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING TAKING OVER. &gt;&gt; It's a deep responding &gt;&gt; to a deep calling. &gt;&gt; OH, YES. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A DEEP THAT'S CALLING TO US. &gt;&gt; In my office last night, I won't say exactly the detail of it. I think I may have already mentioned something, but I I uh was saying to the folks that were gathered there about worship and was speaking about uh some folks that I knew that were so very dead set against musical instruments in a service, especially anything with percussion. And um of course she certainly understood that because it was the way she had been brought up. But I so I was just sort of not making excuse for the way we worship but but just explaining that sometimes we have people who who will stay outside during worship and come in for the preaching and we we don't find a lot of offense in that. We're just glad you're here. And this little lady surprised me so much. She said, "Well, I loved it today." &gt;&gt; You don't ever [clears throat] know what gets stirring in somebody's heart. The first time my mother went to a Pentecostal meeting where people were free to worship the Lord. She was a little Baptist girl and it terrified her. This was way back and this is when they'd ran the pews and she said, "Steve, I wanted to just die." She said, "I've never been so scared in all my life. I thought I was going to run right out the door. It got more than I could handle." And she said, ' But then all of a sudden, I just opened up and I said to the Lord, I don't want to be a fanatic, but I want to give you what I have. You know, that's all that God is looking for. &gt;&gt; He don't want you to act like me, and he doesn't want me to try to act like you, &gt;&gt; but he wants you to make contact with him. &gt;&gt; It blesses him. It encourages it. It lifts him. Somebody said, "I can't believe that." Well, the Bible tells us the psalm, it said, "Bless the Lord, &gt;&gt; soul." &gt;&gt; HEY, SOUL, BLESS THE LORD. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM PRAISE. &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET HIS BENEFITS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF YOU DO IT QUIETLY OR LOUDLY OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE CREATED &gt;&gt; TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR CREATOR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CREATED TO FEEL A CONNECTION BETWEEN YOU AND THE GOD of all eternity. And you DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY BECAUSE YOU have had a connection with your creator and with your savior. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say about me. And some of you in this house know that is the truth. I just simply don't really care anymore. Let them talk. All I know is sometimes it's like a river has been birthed on the inside of the inside of me. And I don't want to be the dam that shuts it down. &gt;&gt; I want to at least be a fountain. &gt;&gt; Just come right out. Let the spirit of the LORD RISE [screaming] UPON US. &gt;&gt; LET THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RISE WITHIN US. SOMEBODY SAID, "WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO?" IT GIVES YOU STRENGTH &gt;&gt; TO FIGHT THE DEVIL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU GOING TO MEET HIM BEFORE YOU GET HOME TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HARASS YOUR MIND. HE'S GOING TO TELL YOU A LIE. HE'S GOING TO STIR UP SOMEBODY IN YOUR FAMILY. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING HARSH TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Something is going to happen. &gt;&gt; And if you have had a connection with your creator, IF YOU'VE HAD A MOMENT IN HIS PRESENCE, YOU'VE RECEIVED STRENGTH THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE RECEIVING. &gt;&gt; And it'll make a difference tonight. It'll make a difference tomorrow. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. It's not a waste of time. Delilah didn't love Samson. &gt;&gt; No. No. She was for hire. They told her, "All of us will give you,00 pieces of silver." And Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lith, and wherewith thou mightest bite mightest be bound to afflict thee." Now the name Delilah the root of it means debated strongest options to weaken to impoverish to drain. It's the very meaning of her name to impoverish. To take somebody with a rich heritage and a rich legacy and bankrupt them, make them almost as though they were from wealth to poverty, running out of all the good things that that they had experienced before. The life draining out and being sucked out of them. Another tradition of that Hebrew word says it means delicate. There wasn't much delicate about Delilah except her her put on languishing. And when you put all of the meaning of Delilah together, it means to weaken, to bring low, to make feeble. If that's her demeanor toward you, she doesn't love you. &gt;&gt; If that's his demeanor toward you, he doesn't love you. If he sets out to weaken you, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; If she sets out to weaken you, that's not love. &gt;&gt; Now, it may be bad training. She or he may need to be retrained in building relationship. It may not be of evil or wicked intent. It may just be sloppy teaching. Dysfunctional families produce dysfunctional kids &gt;&gt; who spread their dysfunction in all of their relationships. &gt;&gt; And it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger &gt;&gt; until somebody rises up and says, "If God is God, if the word is the word, we're going to DO IT LIKE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; We're going to relax a little bit and let God do something for us." &gt;&gt; So, you don't want to weaken your partner. You don't want to bring them low. &gt;&gt; You don't want TO MAKE THEM FEEBLE OR MAKE THEM FEEL FEEBLE. If you want a husband to check out of a relationship, a marriage emotionally very quickly, &gt;&gt; emphasize what he has gotten wrong, what he what he doesn't do, what he can't do right. A woman's love language is usually affection. And whether we recognize it or not, a man's love language is usually honor and respect, &gt;&gt; not worship. No woman should have to bow down &gt;&gt; and cower as though she has no opinion or no no, this is not Bible. It's not even Bible. &gt;&gt; She should be submissive and he should make her uh a strong leader. He should be a strong leader to her because if he'll be that, she will find lots of grace to submit to him even if she thinks his decision is wrong. But if a woman refuses to show her husband honor and respect, it somehow emasculates who he is. That's right. &gt;&gt; It takes his godgiven ability from him and he begins to feel weakened. That's when jealousy starts. That's when when supposition starts. That's when division starts. I know it's quiet in here, &gt;&gt; but we ought to know what love does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love builds, doesn't it? If a husband will try to build his wife, it strengthens the relationship. &gt;&gt; If a wife will try to strengthen her husband and build him, &gt;&gt; it'll draw them closer together. &gt;&gt; This Delilah wasn't interested in a long-term relationship. She w she rejoiced and desired to SEE. BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A WIFE FROM AMONG THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; Just a minute. Amen, brother Shelly. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND HER IN THE BAR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND HER IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OFTEN GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. &gt;&gt; And here's what young men ought to think of in this day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S NOT JUST THOSE MOMENTS OF h of attraction and passion and desire that you need to think about. YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE &gt;&gt; THAT DRAWS YOUR LITTLE BABY up &gt;&gt; preach &gt;&gt; and nurseshu &gt;&gt; him or her &gt;&gt; and the one THAT'S GOING TO TEACH them and train them &gt;&gt; and mold them and make them and shape them into being what you as a father would desire. Of course with your help and assistance. You may you may want to run with a trolleup now, but you're definitely not going to want a trolop to raise your children. &gt;&gt; I'VE SEEN SO MANY BACKSLIDE. SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE YEARS BACKSLIDE and they go out there and they have their fun and THEY HAVE THEIR PARTY and they run with wildness. BUT IT'S AN UNUSUAL PHENOMENON THAT IF THEY ESCAPE GETTING SOMEBODY PREGNANT, they almost always start inching back toward the church. Why? Because they don't want that gal &gt;&gt; to raise their children. &gt;&gt; We need to think about that now. I wished you'd help me. That's my responsibility to say it. As believers, it's your responsibility to amen it. &gt;&gt; And reinforce it in your home. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's like the young people that go out here and uh ink up everything. You know, they just look look freakish these days. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they forget. When you're young and buff and amazing, that makes you look buffer and tougher. But when you're raising your children and when the ship's anchor is hanging way down below your elbow, it started up here and now it's hanging down there. It ain't very pretty. &gt;&gt; IF WE COULD START LIVING WITH WITH THE FUTURE KIND OF IN our mind, DON'T YOU THINK WE'D CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY? &gt;&gt; I believe we would. And it's important because we're preparing. I know the Lord is soon coming, &gt;&gt; but but the longest day you have here on this planet, you want to spend it with somebody that you can love and trust. &gt;&gt; And if you can't trust them now before the before the I do, you'll never trust them on the other side of the I do. It doesn't change that. That changes some things, but it doesn't change that. You better love as much about them now as you possibly can &gt;&gt; because it doesn't automatically change. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You see, Samson wouldn't have gotten this mess if he'd have been looking for a godly woman, a godly wife among his own people. &gt;&gt; But he had this spirit of compromise on him. Even though born for a purpose, he let his own human sensuality and impulsiveness and lack of discipline get a hold of him. And he goes down to Delilah, who is not out to love him. &gt;&gt; SHE'S OUT TO BANKRUPT HIM. &gt;&gt; He was a man of extraordinary spiritual power. Yet he left his most important the most important role. He left it un unattended. He left his soul unguarded. And when a man or a woman leaves their soul unguarded, it's an invitation to compromise. &gt;&gt; You see, your soul is the mind and the will and the emotions. It's the middle ground of who you are, and it's the battleground of where the enemy will fight you. It's the closest part of who you are that's connected to your mind and to your thinking. Brother Brandham tells us, "The greatest battle ever fought is fought in the battlefield of the mind, which is the realm of mind, will, and emotion." And if you think about it a minute, you'll recognize that when the enemy badgers you, it comes in the mind. It comes in the will and it comes in the emotions. If we can get victory over the middle ground, &gt;&gt; if we can let Jesus be Lord over the middle ground, &gt;&gt; then that middle ground has the strength and ability to pull the flesh &gt;&gt; into alignment with the regenerated spirit of Christ that lives within you. This is what we need to know before we go. Psalm 1:1, "Blessed is the man." &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT, SAMSON? &gt;&gt; BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful. I'm a King James version sort of guy, but I'm going to read this in the Amplified just to keep things stirred up. BLESSED, HAPPY, FORTUNATE, PROSPEROUS, AND ENVIABLE IS THE MAN WHO WALKS and lives not in the advice and the counsel OF THE UNGODLY. WHO CARES what the world thinks about how you live? &gt;&gt; WHO CARES WHAT THE DRINKING buddies think about the way you live YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; WHO CARES WHAT THE NEIGHBOR THINKS? YOU DON'T GO TO THE WORLD TO GET YOUR advice for life. YOU GO TO THE GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, UH, who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, following their advice, their plans, their purposes, nor stands submissive and inactive. I'm slowing down. In the path where sinners walk, nor sits down to relax and rest, where the scornful and the mockers gather. Don't you mock. &gt;&gt; Let's not be mockers. That's fun. &gt;&gt; Somebody was in here yesterday mocking just a little bit some of the worship that was going on, you know, just kind of mocking, you know. I I I I don't want to be a doomsday somebody. I I I wouldn't do that. Even if I didn't understand it, I wouldn't want to mock it. Sometimes we may find ourselves mocking something that that's more real than what we have come to experience. &gt;&gt; And there's a price to pay when we do. &gt;&gt; Uh I've learned that people don't have to do like I do to be okay. And the best thing that I can do is just let let them approach the way they approach. And and I'm going to approach him the way I approach him. And I'm not going to let you influence me otherwise. And I don't want to I don't want to particularly influence you otherwise. We've got to love him and we've got to serve him the best way we can. &gt;&gt; Samson made some big messes here because he went down to the to the enemy to find his woman. And then he began to play with her. He knew she wasn't trustable. And if you look at the rest of this chapter, and I'm I'm nearly done. Musicians, I'll even let you I'll even let you come because it gives the good impression that we're almost done whether we are or not. And I can feel every muscle in your legs all tensing up. They're they're all ready to come up here knowing if I can just get up there then we know we're we know we're within the last hour. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And he starts playing. You should read it. I won't take the time, but you should read the rest of that chapter. He starts play. He She says, "What's the what's the power? What's the secret?" And he tells her three different lies. And every time she finds out, he just keeps lying to me. But in verse 16 it says, "And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him." Sounds just like the devil. So that his soul, mind, will, and emotion was vexed unto death that he told her, "Oh my, don't do it. Don't do it." Look at your neighbor and say, "Don't do it. Don't tell your heart. Don't give your heart to somebody you don't trust. &gt;&gt; If you just met her, don't trust her. If you just met him, don't trust him with your heart. You know, tell him tell him tell him uh something. Tell him you have a very expensive taste and he can't afford you. But don't tell him your heart. Don't Don't tell her. Don't tell her your heart. He He He just got a little intoxicated in the moment and he just spilled it all. He's fooled her three times, but she kept pressing him. Let me tell you, the devil is after us. He's after you, especially if you're not fully surrendered. And he will harass you and harass you and harass you. He'll never lose your number. Right? &gt;&gt; He keeps you at the top of his rolodex. Oh, you don't know what a rolodex is. Uh he keeps you at the top of his contact list &gt;&gt; and he'll just keep dialing and dialing and dialing and dialing. And she dialed and dialed and dialed UNTIL HE TOLD HER ALL OF HIS HEART. And he said unto her, "There hath not come a razor upon my head, for I have been a Nazerite unto God from my mother's womb. If I be I mean, he's spelling it all now. I I read this and I'm thinking sh &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Several thousand years too late, but I'm saying sh THEN MY STRENGTH will go from me AND I SHALL BECOME WEAK and be like any other man. Not because his hair was magical. &gt;&gt; Samson's hair was the outward sign of a consecrated covenant. &gt;&gt; That's right. Just like a sister's hair or a sister's long hair is an outward sign of a consecrated covenant. &gt;&gt; And I would to God that you wouldn't let this world talk you out of your covenant &gt;&gt; with the king. &gt;&gt; I I get way too involved in just about everything. And when I see people coming out of religious systems that have controlled them and driven them, boxed them, and yet I see them coming out, and you're just about to praise God for bringing them out of that kind of bondage, and the next thing you know, they've gone all the way over to the other side. I might preach a minute &gt;&gt; and the next time you you you observe their life, they've gone way over to the other side. When I see precious women who have come out of some of the different structures of the Anabaptist and and they and and they're in their genes and they're and they're all the way over there, it breaks my heart. They live this life uh for so long and then they uh they throw the baby out with the bathwater &gt;&gt; and it it breaks my heart because I believe it breaks God's heart. &gt;&gt; It's it's the mind of God according to the New Testament that a woman keep her hair long. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I don't mean this in in an offensive way to anyone because your conviction I will honor it. You ask anybody that knows me, I will honor your conviction even if it's different from mine. But the scripture said that that long hair is given her for a covering. And it's an amazing thing that she has this opportunity to go out into this old world and say, "I just want to be his. I want to be my husband's bride. And I want to be my creator's daughter, his servant. And I don't care what the fads say, and I don't care what the world says. I'm going to keep the scissors out of mine. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be an example to a dying world. It's it's an outward sign. It's not salvation, but it's an outward sign of an inward covenant. And in the same manner, 1 Corinthians chapter 11 tells us that it's a shame. Even nature itself teaches you that it's a shame for a man to have long hair. The Bible says that, you know, New Testament. And the Bible says that if a man uh prays or prophesies with his head covered, this is dishonoring and disrespectful to his creator. He's not supposed to have this piled on his head. He's supposed to live it. And you know, people say that's out equated. That's outdated. That has nothing to do with it. Well, here's all it has to do with. It's an outward sign of an inward covenant. And it says to the world around you, I don't care what Hollywood does. I don't care what everybody else does. My pressure is not going to come from the world. &gt;&gt; My responsibility is going to come by the word. Anybody here? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TOLD HER HIS SECRET &gt;&gt; IF HE WASN'T GOING TO EXPECT HER TO DO SOMETHING about it. He may not have known how much silver was laying on the deal. &gt;&gt; But he knew something was among just spilled his Let me step out of the pull pit. He just spilled his guts. He just told her everything and she couldn't wait to put him to sleep. Oh, she's rubbing his temples. She's got essential oils and she's trying to get him to sleep. You're getting sleepy. And as soon as he was out, she calls him in. It's rough. It's tough. She said, "You've been mocking me." in verse 13 telling me lies. Now tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And that last lie he said if you weave seven locks of my head with a web. And she fastened it with a pin man bun or something here. And said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson. He waked out of his sleep and went away with a pin of the beam and with the web. She had him connected. She she she sort of tied him in. Kind of a sad thing. Then she tell he tells it all. And when Delilah saw verse 18, when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she knew the difference. &gt;&gt; She sent she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he hath showed me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand, and she made him sleep upon her knees. And she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him. Of course it did. And in verse 20, this is the last for today. I I hope you'll maybe check back with us for the next installment. But in verse 20, this is one of the saddest moments in Samson's great life. The Bible said he was slaying them hip. How how did it word that? Hip and hip and thigh in in in just a few moments he' taken out a thousand Philistines. He used the jawbone of an old donkey. God had mightily. They they tie him to the gates of Gaza and they lay and wait till for the sunrise. And before the sunrise comes, he decides, I'm going to go on ahead. And he just takes the gates of Gaza with him. The spirit of the Lord again mightily mightily on him. And this is the saddest saddest thing for me. Verse 20. And and she said as SHE HAD SAID THREE TIMES BEFORE AND it was a lie. IT WAS A LIE. IT [screaming] WAS A LIE. IT WAS A LIE UNTIL IT WASN'T A LIE. That's how the devil works. You see, I I did such and and didn't make a difference. You see, I I DID IT AGAIN. DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I I went a little further. Didn't make a difference. And And then you It makes a difference. You're caught. SEE, I DID THAT AND I'M not addicted. You see, I I DID THAT AND I'm not addicted. AND I DID THAT AND and now I can't live without it. This is how it works. A lie. lie a lie a lie and then not a lie. And he'll walk out of his sleep AND SAID, "I WILL GO OUT AS AT OTHER TIMES BEFORE. I'm going to show these Philistines the power of the Lord." Well, if you're going to do that, you better keep your head off of Delilah's lap &gt;&gt; because this time he just shook himself as he had many times before. AND WHEN HE WOULD SHAKE HIMSELF, the covenant that was on his head would pull the power. That's what scripture said. IT WOULD PULL THE POWER OF GOD TO MOVE mightily upon him and he would then defeat the enemy. But this time, he shook himself and there was nothing. NO SENSATION, NO FEELING, NO EMOTION, NO CHANGE, NOTHING. AND HE SHOOK HIMSELF AGAIN PROBABLY. AND MAYBE AGAIN AND AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES HE SHOOK HIMSELF, BUT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE BECAUSE NOW THREE TIMES he had defiled the reason of his birth. First in the vineyard in Timnath. Second with the carcass of the lion. Third, he's now laid his head into Delilah's lap, given away the secret. THREE TIMES he had yielded to the temptation of the enemy and he had sinned against the reason why he was born. It didn't make a difference the first time, didn't make much of a difference the second time, but oh that third time here, he couldn't get it back. It had lifted. And this is what he said. I don't want to try to be dramatic, but it gets me pretty tough. And he wished not. And he wished not that the Lord was departed from him. Time and time and time and time again, he had felt that uncction, that life, that quickening power. But this time, he had made one step too far. And he'd given away a secret and the covenant THAT KEPT HIM CONNECTED to the reason why he was born. He let that be fooled with and shaved off. And there was no longer anything to connect him to his why, to the purpose of his birth. And the spirit of the Lord lifted off of him. I want you to know it's the saddest scene. And if you if you follow the story, and we're closing, but if you follow the story, it was the end. It was the beginning of the end and the end of the beginning all at the same time [clears throat] because now he was captive to those who despised his strength and who wanted him dead. And the first thing they did was what? They put out his eyes because the devil knows if he can remove vision from the people of God, if he can discourage them from believing that they can see truth and pursue it, he'll blind you every time. He'll blindfold you first. Yes, sir. And if that doesn't work, he'll put out your eyes &gt;&gt; because he wants to stop us &gt;&gt; from finishing the race. Well, &gt;&gt; but let me say as you stand, this is not the end. It's it's the end of my message. Aren't you glad? SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUST DOWN THE ROAD, IF YOU'VE EVER KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT HAIR, &gt;&gt; oh my, &gt;&gt; when I realized yesterday how shaggy mine was looking, I was embarrassed. I get a haircut every other Tuesday and this Tuesday is my time. And so those last few days sometimes it looks a little sha I don't believe you'll call it long but but a little shaggy and sometimes I go back in two weeks and she says it's hardly grown and other times I go back and she said it's really grown this time. I don't understand all that. I'm just glad it's still growing and not turning loose. I'm always delighted. I ask her at least once a month. Is it thinning too much up there? No, no, no, no. And she said, "It's all right. I pay her. She'll say anything. Probably she might even hear this. It'll grow. THE ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT OH, SORRY, JONATHAN. SORRY, BEN. IN MOST CASES, IT'LL GROW. IT'S NOT OVER AS LONG AS IT'S GROWING. AND THE BIBLE TELLS US AND THE PROPHET TOLD US THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOCK OF HAIR. &gt;&gt; HE'S BLINDED AND HE IS ABSOLUTELY TREADING THE GRAIN like a beast. &gt;&gt; HE'S HE'S MARCHING IN A CIRCLE BLIND TIED TO THE GRINDING STONE. &gt;&gt; BLINDLY PUSHING AND MAKING HIS CIRCLE. BUT ALL THE TIME THEY'RE MOCKING AND THEY'RE LAUGHING A AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT A CHAMPION HE WAS. BUT IN ALL OF THAT MOMENT OF OF CYCLING AND CIRCLING AROUND, his hair was beginning to grow again BECAUSE GOD WASN'T FINISHED. &gt;&gt; SAMSON COMPROMISED. SAMSON FAILED. SAMSON MESSED UP, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND YET [screaming] GOD SAID, "I'M NOT THROUGH WITH YOU. YOU WERE BORN FOR A PURPOSE, FOR A REASON, &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO RENEW. I'M GOING TO LET THAT HAIR GROW. And I'm going to reconnect with you for one final showdown." I was shocked when I saw all the times that Brother Brandham spoke about Samson pages and pages and pages. He loved the story and he particularly loved the prayer that was said at the pillar. I'll close for the 15th time with this. He doesn't have time to get religious and he doesn't have time to do all the, you know, the work, but he's got enough time to scream out JUST ONCE MORE, LORD. AND BECAUSE HIS hair had began to grow &gt;&gt; and was no longer being cut, HE WAS RECONNECTED TO THE covenant and repositioned for the purpose of his birth and for his wife, for his reason. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And one more time, God looked down and he said, "This is it, son. This is it. I'm going to show them who's Lord over Israel. I'm going to show them who's Lord over the Philistines. And even though you failed me and disappointed me and compromised on your on your covenant, I love you and I'm going to use you. I'm going to hear your prayer just once more. And the scripture tells us that Samson destroyed more of the enemies of Israel in his in his death at the end of his life than he had in the entirety of his lifespan. Because when God gives you a purpose, a reason, and a calling, you may drop it, you may lose it, you may fail at it, but God doesn't forget. I want you to know God is not a politician and he will not make a promise that he will not keep. &gt;&gt; If God said it, it settles it. &gt;&gt; IF GOD PROMISED IT, HE IS duty bound to his own word. &gt;&gt; And while you were in your mother's tummy, &gt;&gt; there was a purpose for you being there. &gt;&gt; There was a reason why you were there. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I just don't know if I can get all that." Sure, there was a reason. My mother and father had been intimate together. Yes, but that's not the part of you I'm talking about. That part is where your DNA come from. And that part is from where your natural genetics come from. And that's why you have the color hair you have and the kind of eyes you have. And that's why you're as I mean as handsome and beautiful as you are. Because that comes from the mom and the dad. That comes from the natural. And that is definitely an important part of who YOU ARE. BUT ABOVE THAT, &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE WORLD WAS FRAMED, YES, SIR, &gt;&gt; God knew you. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW YOUR NAME BEFORE YOUR MOTHER KNEW YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW YOUR LIFE. IN FACT, THE SCRIPTURE SAID, "EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE WAS ALREADY WRITTEN AS PAGES IN THE BOOK of the Lord." &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GO, "OH, WHAT A GOD. OH, WHAT A GOD. OH, WHAT A GOD I SERVE." AND IN THAT MOMENT, he had a purpose for you being here. It's that God part of you that I'm talking about. It's that part of himself that he placed over your life in addition to what mother and father had provided. That's the why. That's the reason. That's the purpose. And I want you to know that you will never have perfect peace. You'll never have real joy until you find yourself walking in the reason of your birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for that. Amen. Because it's a critical moment to say amen. &gt;&gt; You'll never You may have a wife. You may have a lovely wife. You may have wonderful children. You may have a successful business. You may live in a pretty nice home. You may even have indoor plumbing. But you'll never find real happiness, real peace, real joy, and a real reason for living &gt;&gt; until you start stepping. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel him now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the in the reason for your birth. &gt;&gt; And you know what? You can do it today because it's not about joining church. It's not about anything like that. It's simply about saying, "I surrender all. I surrender all. All all to thee, my blessed savior, I Surrender all to Jesus. I surrender all to him. I freely give. No one is persuading me or constraining me. I freely give it to him. I'M MAKING A MESS of my life AND I FREELY GIVE IT TO him &gt;&gt; to do with it as he will to step into my purpose. Oh, I &gt;&gt; Jesus [music] I surrender all. Oh, I [music] &gt;&gt; I surrender. I surrender all all to thee my blessed Savior I surrender all sing this verse and all to Jesus I oh God I want to lay it down again. [music] &gt;&gt; I want to lay it down again, Lord. I want to lay my will down again. Worldly worldly pleasure. Oh, forsaken take me. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I surrender. [music] He wants your yes. [music] SOMEBODY'S BEEN ASKING, "WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM ME?" [music] GOD, WHAT DO you want FROM ME? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT he wants. He wants your yes. He just wants your yes. Sing it again with Benjamin, would you? I &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I surrender all. Oh, I surrender. Oh, I surrender [music] all. To thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender. Do [singing] it one more time, son. [music] Oh, and I surrender all. We lay it down today. Oh, I surrender all. [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we pick it up and we go on &gt;&gt; to thee. We just [music] say, "Lord, come." &gt;&gt; Yes, savior. I surrender. It doesn't matter to me where you surrender. You can surrender up here. You ought to really give the devil a black eye and show him that the pew is not going to hold you. But it doesn't matter where. Do it right where you are. Do it where you feel comfortable. You don't have to do it loud enough for me to hear you. You don't have to tell the person next to you who said it. But I challenge you with a heart of concern for your life. You don't know me. How could you be concerned about me? Because it's his heart for you that I feel, not mine. And he just wants your yes. So, so do it right where you are if that's best for you. But make it count. Make it count. How do I do that? By determining that it's not just going to be this moment. You're going to take your yes with you &gt;&gt; when you leave here. And when the enemy tries to talk you out of it, you're going to you're going to use God's word to defeat the enemy. And you're going to say, "It may be a humble start. It may be a feeble start, but I've started [music] on the journey of full surrender. I want him to be Lord." Listen, if if Christ is not Lord of all, he has no interest of being your Lord at all. It's only when you're willing to say, "Above it all, Jesus, I want you to stand above it all. I want you to sit above it all. I want you I want I want your decisions to be my leadership. Not my will, Lord, but yours be done." Father, I I'm going to just pray now, Benjamin. Usually, we wait a moment, but I just I just have to capture this now. Father, in the name of Jesus, These are not my people. They're your people. They're all part of the family of God. And somebody today, I know it as good as I know my name. Somebody today is going to give a yes a little louder spiritually than before. Somebody is going to make a fuller surrender than what they have made before. and you're going to rush in and make the difference in their life as only you can. So Lord, I just ask you to protect this moment right now. Would you send the very presence of the living God and the power of the Holy Spirit to guard this moment right now that the enemy not be able to distract us in any way or to dissuade or to discourage? This is a moment between a a man and his God, a woman and her God. even a child and their God. &gt;&gt; And this is holy. It's not about shaking a hand or joining a church. It's about saying, "Lord, I've done it my way a little too conveniently lately, and I must find your will, my why, my purpose, my reason. And so I surrender." So, Father, give grace where grace is needed. Give us wisdom so that if we have the opportunity to speak life to any of these who are making such a promise to you. May we use wisdom and may we do it with the wonderful grace that you have shown to us just once more. Lord, maybe there are those who feel like they have failed you too many times, let you down too many times, but I'm here to testify that you have such patience and such longsuffering that time and time again when we fail you, you still chase us after us. You still reach for us. So Lord, I ask you right now to remove all condemnation and judgment because there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. Sin will condemn us, but your grace will set us free. And we ask you right now to come and break stubborn will and give us grace to be all that you have called us to be as we spend these next few moments worshiping our creator before we leave. Yes, [music] Jesus. All my words fall short. I've got nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? I could sing these songs as I [singing] often do. that every song must stand and you never do. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. A hallelujah.

Don't you just touch the the person next to you if it's if it's convenient or if it's appropriate or you know what I mean. Even if it embarrasses the life out of them, do it just one time. And just ask the Lord. You don't have to do it out loud, but just ask the Lord, would you strengthen this one? Maybe it's your companion. May maybe it's your own family, but would you just whisper, "Lord, strengthen this woman. You're the only one that can strengthen his." Yes. Strengthen her. Yes. Stir the desire and hunger for you, Lord, in this one I'm standing next to. Stir the hunger. Stir the desire. Let me set a better example. If it's someone in my home, let me set a better example for this one. We can't do it without you, Lord. And just to be honest, we need one another. Lord, we need one another. Brothers need brothers. Sisters need sisters. The body needs the body. And we just stand right now saying, "Lord, strengthen this one. Your goodness has followed us all the days of our life. And we don't want to finish in a in a rotten way. We want to finish well. If it's another few weeks or months or years or whatever it is that you've got left for us on this earth, we want to finish the race well. If we have slowed down, Lord, we want to pick up the pace and we want to get our eyes on the finish line. And the finish line is not a trophy. It's not even a mansion or a street of gold to walk on. It's you. You are the prize that lays before your little bride. And we want to say, Lord, you're more than enough. You're more than enough. If we can win you, if we can gain you as our prize, as our reward, you're more than enough. Just carry a moment with the one that you're standing near and take us back into that song. You just don't realize sometime how strengthening it is when you show just a little kindness to the one that's next to you. Strengthen this whole body. Strengthen the streamers today, Lord. Let your presence touch them right now in their homes. I looked a moment ago and they're streaming from the nations of the world. In Norway, in South Africa, in Iceland, all over the world, so many places. Strengthen them now. I love you, Lord. Oh, your mercy [singing] [music] never fails me. And all my [singing] days I've been held [music] in your hands. From the moment [singing] that I wake up until I lay my hand, [music and singing] I will sing of the goodness of God. [music and singing] Cuz all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so [music] good. With every breath that I am able, [singing] I will sing of the goodness of God. I [singing and music] love your voice, Lord. You have led me through the fire [music] and in the darkest night. You are [singing] close like no other. I've known you as a father and I've known [music] you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness [music] of God. Cuz all my life you have been [music] faithful. Yes, you have, Lord. Oh, and all my life you have been so so good. [music] So in every breath that I am able, [music] oh I will sing of the goodness of God. [music] Cuz your goodness [music] is running after. It's running after me. Cuz your goodness is running after. It's running after me. With [music] my life laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything.

How many of you can say amen? &gt;&gt; I have lived in the goodness of God. What a good God He is. &gt;&gt; He supplies all of our needs according to his riches and glory. He's precious. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's a precious honor and privilege to serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Gley, would you come and and announce the memorial service and close in a word of prayer? I would like to find the the words to apologize for the length of the service, but I just can't seem to find them. So, thank you for staying. That I can say. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for staying. What an honor to be in the presence of the Lord. On Tuesday night at six o'clock, we'll gather here to have a memorial service in honor of our dear sister Williams who has run her race. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're left here to continue the race. And by God's grace, that is what we are going to do. We're going to keep running the race. &gt;&gt; We'll gather together at six o'clock. And when we're finished, then we will gather to have a meal together down at the fellowship hall and give as much comfort as we can to the family as much as we know how as human beings and pray that the Lord will do what we cannot do. Let's bow our heads as we're getting ready to leave. Our father, how blessed we are to be in your presence today. We do live by faith, but we are thankful when you come by, when you let us know you're so close. Thank you that you quicken us. Thank you for the word of the Lord today. Thank you for each one that is gathered to be in the house and those that have been on the streaming today. We pray your blessing upon them, asking that the word that has been preached would uh continue its work through this week and and the the rest of our lifetime. Lord, I thank you that you are the one who is working mightily in us as we yield and say yes to you. Now, as we leave this house, we pray for those that would be traveling, some by air, some on the road. We pray that you would let the angels of the Lord surround them. I pray, God, for those that are traveling in for the memorial, that you'll be with them as they travel. And God, I pray that you will let the peace that passes all understanding rest upon us. We will give you glory and praise. Father, would you pour strength back into our pastor, minister into his into his physical frame? And I pray, God, that you will continue to lead him as he is trying to lead us on in the paths of righteousness. For your name's sake we give you glory and honor and praise. For it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you leave today. Greet one another. Let the love of Jesus shine out of you in the name of the Lord. Once again, we'll be together. Remember, it's at 6:00 Eastern time on Tuesday night, not 7:00 as our normal service time. Thank you to Sister Martha's family for those of you who stayed for the service today. We feel honored. Thank you for doing it. I know it touched her heart, too. Praise God. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; You have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. [singing] You have led me through the fire. And in darkest night, you are close like no other. I have [music] known you as a father, known you as a friend, and I have lived in the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am aable, I will sing of the goodness.
