[33:25] service with the needs of the body if
[33:28] you have a need here this morning you'd
[33:30] like to make it known by an uplifted
[33:32] hand I know that the Lord knows each and
[33:34] everyone we want to remember everyone
[33:35] that's still traveling to and from this
[33:38] place remember the ones that'll be out
[33:40] of town for a few more days even that
[33:42] the Lord a bless and be with them meet
[33:45] every need that they
[33:47] have amen Joshua still got about six
[33:50] hours of travel today I'd like for him
[33:52] to be lifted up sister Megan Kino is at
[33:55] home not feeling well
[33:57] sister christalin has a procedure
[33:59] tomorrow we're praying that the Lord
[34:01] will give her grace to go through it and
[34:03] and good report good
[34:05] results we there are about three of us
[34:08] four of us who have tried to get in
[34:09] touch with Sister Kate Daye over the
[34:11] last three or four days we were not able
[34:14] to do so which causes us to believe that
[34:17] she has either slipped into a coma or
[34:19] has perhaps passed we won't know my
[34:24] understanding from hers we would know
[34:25] for a few days but we would be notified
[34:27] would you pray that if she if she's in
[34:30] the last hours of her life which I sense
[34:33] that she possibly is that God will help
[34:36] her to have a very safe Crossing and if
[34:39] she has crossed pray that the Lord will
[34:41] uh will help those who cared about her
[34:43] she did have some loving neighbors and a
[34:46] cousin and uh and some of us that God
[34:50] will bring comfort and and help us to
[34:52] get through and that was all that I had
[34:55] again lots of people 30s something
[34:57] people traveling over the next few days
[34:59] to come home may God bring them all safe
[35:02] the roads are so dangerous amen also

[35:07] Dwayne and sister Heather Jackson that
[35:09] the Lord will surround them and his
[35:10] perfect will will be accomplished there
[35:12] I saw that they needed had a problem
[35:15] with the placenta and uh they reached
[35:18] out for prayer I'm sure they asked lots
[35:20] of people to pray but they called us and
[35:22] we prayed for them on the phone and the
[35:25] Lord instantly called caus the blood to
[35:27] clot and we're thankful for that it was
[35:30] the grace of God but she needs to be
[35:33] carried in prayer a few more weeks if
[35:35] the Lord would let the baby Terry uh
[35:38] she's what honey 30 33 weeks or she's
[35:43] about 33 weeks or something like that
[35:45] and and after a couple more weeks
[35:47] everything would be all right with no
[35:49] worries so they're not letting her
[35:51] travel right now but uh they said
[35:54] there's nothing she can do to prevent it
[35:56] or to cause cuse it so just ask the Lord
[35:58] to to comfort their hearts and heal her
[36:00] and give her grace to carry it as long
[36:02] as he wants her to carry it then a

[50:15] your name or maybe you'd rather be at
[50:18] home in front of the hell Vision or but
[50:21] I'm so happy today to be in the presence
[50:24] of the Lord
[50:26] with those of like Precious faith we
[50:29] must not take it for granted we must be
[50:32] thankful for all that God has blessed us
[50:35] with we want to thank you for all your
[50:38] prayers for us while we were away we had
[50:40] a wonderful time what a what a blessing
[50:43] to live uh three and a half hours away
[50:47] from a a beautiful place that you could
[50:50] actually sit in the
[50:51] sun uh with a very small number of
[50:54] people very small on the day after
[50:57] Thanksgiving and not be
[50:59] cold
[51:01] wow we had uh seven days away and four
[51:04] of those days we were able to spend them
[51:07] on the beach it has to rain sometimes so
[51:10] we didn't Grumble about the rain when
[51:12] you see the cracked ground you know that
[51:14] the rain the the rain is needed but uh
[51:17] it was good to be together and with all
[51:19] of my children uh our children Joshua
[51:22] got to spend most of those days with us
[51:25] and then he took off to South Carolina
[51:28] when they get older and get love
[51:30] interest here and there well it's a
[51:32] little tougher isn't it so always pray
[51:35] for me I'll pray for you but we're just
[51:38] thankful for the time that we had
[51:40] together I know I don't know about you
[51:42] but I like my
[51:44] family I not only love them I like them
[51:47] and I enjoy being around them I'm so
[51:49] thankful that I don't have that
[51:51] Uncle you know the one I'm talking about
[51:55] Hallelujah Hallelujah we can talk about
[51:57] politics and nobody gets
[52:00] upset we can talk about Israel and
[52:03] nobody gets upset we can talk about the
[52:06] word of the hour and nobody gets upset
[52:08] isn't that wonderful amen and we are so
[52:12] thankful I understand that 17 hostages
[52:16] were just transferred into the hands of
[52:18] the IDF we want to thank God for the
[52:21] third
[52:23] exchange for their safe
[52:27] one of them was flown directly to a
[52:30] hospital in by helicopter in Israel
[52:33] because of needs yesterday one of the
[52:35] young ladies 21 22 years old uh had been
[52:40] had been shot 50 days ago on October the
[52:44] 7th and had been suffering ever since
[52:47] needed a surgery that was not
[52:49] lifethreatening but was very necessary
[52:51] for her wounds that she sustained on
[52:53] that day they literally shot her and
[52:56] then shoved her in the Jeep to take her
[52:58] captive and she was taken yesterday
[53:01] immediately to a hospital and received
[53:04] the surgery that she needed and we're
[53:06] very thankful for that we're thankful
[53:08] that one of the elderly women that that
[53:11] Hamas had reported as dead they had took
[53:14] pictures of her while she was sleeping
[53:17] and sent them around the world to say
[53:19] that she had died of natural causes it
[53:21] was a lie it never happened she was
[53:24] released un fortunately she found out
[53:26] that her husband had been murdered on
[53:28] October the 7th and her son was still
[53:31] being held captive by Hamas one of the
[53:34] most heartwarming things that I have
[53:36] seen in a long time was the daddy who
[53:40] spoke some weeks ago after the the event
[53:45] and had received word that his little
[53:47] daughter how old was she honey just 9
[53:50] years old he had received word that his
[53:52] 9-year-old daughter had died died at the
[53:56] hands of Hamas and he was thanking God
[54:00] that she was no longer suffering and
[54:02] that she had been spared from further
[54:05] abuse not knowing what would happen well
[54:08] yesterday some days after that they got
[54:11] word that she was not dead that she was
[54:13] indeed alive so he had to get used to
[54:16] her death then he had to get used to the
[54:19] fact that no she was alive and she could
[54:21] be uh being tortured or abused but I
[54:25] believe that most all of that melted
[54:27] yesterday when she ran into his arms and
[54:31] if any of you saw that you will
[54:34] understand how important it is for us to
[54:36] pray check the
[54:38] list have you been praying over your
[54:41] list I've been praying over mine and
[54:43] God's doing some things uh two or three
[54:47] that have been on brother Grey's List
[54:49] have already been released and uh I
[54:52] think if you'll check your list you'll
[54:54] find out that that some of you were
[54:56] praying for for some of those that have
[54:58] been released and there'll be others
[55:00] listen I don't agree with a lot of
[55:01] things that are going on I don't think
[55:04] that we ought to have to give uh
[55:06] prisoners for
[55:08] hostages but it's a fact of life it's
[55:11] the only way in in a in a world like the
[55:13] one we live in it's the only way to be
[55:16] able to get these people home safely and
[55:18] the only way that this can continue and
[55:21] Hamas can be destroyed is to bring as
[55:24] many of
[55:25] uh not just Israelis there were four
[55:27] Internationals today um somebody should
[55:31] be asking our president
[55:33] somebody should be asking our president
[55:36] why no Americans have been released
[55:39] somebody should be asking the Jewish
[55:42] Democrats those Democrats in office
[55:45] those those Democrat senators and and uh
[55:48] uh those who serve in the House of
[55:50] Representatives someone should be asking
[55:52] them why they refuse to cry out
[55:55] about our American citizens that are
[55:58] being held captive by by Hamas and they
[56:01] won't do it they're silent they're so
[56:04] mouthy at other times but they're so
[56:07] silent now it's the world that we're
[56:10] living in and the only way to make a
[56:12] difference is to pray and you keep
[56:15] praying that God will bring those people
[56:17] home as many of them as possible and uh
[56:20] you may not pray like I pray but I pray
[56:22] for the total annihilation of Hamas as a
[56:26] as a terrorist entity it's the only way
[56:29] that Israel can have freedom those
[56:31] prisoners are being released in the West
[56:33] Bank which is Israeli and that means
[56:36] that if God doesn't arrest them they
[56:38] will continue their violence one young
[56:40] woman who was released was a prisoner
[56:43] because she had stabbed two Israelis in
[56:46] public who were doing nothing but
[56:47] standing on a street corner and they're
[56:50] releasing her back to do the same thing
[56:52] again it's a wicked world
[56:55] uh they're boasting that none of them
[56:57] have committed murder I assure you that
[57:01] it will be on their radar as soon as
[57:03] they have an opportunity to do it and uh
[57:06] prayer is all that we can do I will tell
[57:08] you one more thing and then be off of
[57:10] the subject if that was happening in
[57:12] this nation everyone would be screaming
[57:15] everyone would be crying out but because
[57:18] it's Israel if that was going on in
[57:21] UK if it was going on anywhere else but
[57:24] in Israel the whole world would be
[57:26] crying out and now I know why they used
[57:29] to show me in
[57:31] Jerusalem looking across the hom Valley
[57:34] over to the hill down just just up the
[57:37] hill from The Grove where Judas hung
[57:40] himself just up the hill from the place
[57:42] where Judas hung himself and the and the
[57:45] and the Potter's field that was used to
[57:48] purchase the money it's there and they
[57:49] know it's there by history the field
[57:52] that was purchased by by Judah is
[57:55] betrayal money you you find that field
[57:57] it's easy to find if you're standing if
[58:00] you're standing on on in the area of
[58:03] Mount Zion or close to the place where
[58:06] Schindler is buried you can look out
[58:09] across that Valley and you'll see the
[58:11] little plot down there where where
[58:13] poppers have been buried for thousands
[58:14] of years and you go up the hill there
[58:17] and you'll see some olive trees believed
[58:20] to be the very place where Judas
[58:22] committed suicide and then go up the
[58:25] hill a little higher there's a there's a
[58:27] row of buildings across there big nice
[58:30] buildings across the hill looking over
[58:32] Jerusalem and the Jews will tell you and
[58:35] the Christians will tell you that's the
[58:37] hill of evil Council it was from Bible
[58:40] times referred to as the hill of evil
[58:43] Council guess who guess whose
[58:45] headquarters sits there on the hill of
[58:47] evil Council today the United
[58:50] Nations there's probably not much more
[58:53] of a of a a wicked group than the United
[58:57] Nations they're Wicked they're not
[58:59] anything like people think they are and
[59:01] they're sitting there looking over they
[59:03] have found that many Hamas terrorists
[59:07] are serving with badges for the United
[59:10] Nations receiving a United Nations
[59:12] paycheck while they're murdering
[59:14] innocent Jewish people oh we need the
[59:17] Prince of Peace to help us we need him
[59:20] enough of that and and we have something
[59:23] to be thankful for and that is that
[59:26] there are some some uh hostages that are
[59:29] coming home not soldiers not there
[59:32] because they wanted to be there but
[59:34] they're because they were taken did you
[59:36] know some of those hostages had no idea
[59:39] the scope of what had happened they
[59:40] weren't all held together they had no
[59:43] idea the scope of what happened on
[59:45] October the 7th many of them didn't even
[59:47] know their loved ones were dead didn't
[59:49] even know they'd been murdered so now
[59:51] they have to come out of that condition
[59:53] and find out that their families have
[59:55] been taken from them I pray for their
[59:57] emotions because they're humans too no
[59:59] matter what the world thinks you can be
[1:00:01] a Jew and be a human Brother David man
[1:00:04] and I'm thankful to know that and I pray
[1:00:07] for their strength that God will help
[1:00:09] them guess what we are
[1:00:14] trending we are almost viral I think you
[1:00:17] could call it viral for a group this
[1:00:19] small size we have a real on in stagram
[1:00:25] that has
[1:00:26] 180,000
[1:00:28] views it has over three 30 over 3300
[1:00:33] likes and quite a few comments and that
[1:00:37] real alone has gained us 800 new
[1:00:41] followers on
[1:00:42] Instagram I tell you that's good that's
[1:00:46] good that's Mission
[1:00:51] work it hasn't all come without uh free
[1:00:55] it's come with a price because everybody
[1:00:58] doesn't find Our Praise beautiful like
[1:01:01] we do one comment was which I don't
[1:01:04] think I'll ever understand this one
[1:01:07] comment just said
[1:01:10] disgusting you know I have thought that
[1:01:12] some people got out of hand with their
[1:01:15] worship I think that some people worship
[1:01:18] like a like a like a you know under some
[1:01:21] kind of tradition and I don't like all
[1:01:23] the I don't like the the rosaries and
[1:01:26] all that kind but I i' I'd never thought
[1:01:29] about somebody's worship as being
[1:01:31] disgusting I might have thought to
[1:01:33] myself that's Antichrist but I've never
[1:01:36] thought it was disgusting when someone
[1:01:37] is doing something that they that they
[1:01:40] know to do or believ to do to worship
[1:01:42] God but don't let that discourage you
[1:01:45] because there have been hundreds of
[1:01:46] comments that have said I've never seen
[1:01:49] anything more beautiful than what looks
[1:01:50] like Amish people worshiping with other
[1:01:54] other other believers one woman said I
[1:01:57] have had no confidence in people dancing
[1:01:59] in the spirit and worshiping that way
[1:02:01] until I saw this real and I could feel
[1:02:04] the genuiness of
[1:02:07] this that's what we Rejoice
[1:02:10] about and I only got my kids kept saying
[1:02:14] you better come in daddy you need to
[1:02:15] come in aren't you going to come in
[1:02:16] aren't you going to come in I said I'm
[1:02:18] not going to comment till the last
[1:02:20] minute I want them to say everything
[1:02:23] they need to say and then I'll get
[1:02:24] involved and the one thing that stirred
[1:02:26] me out of my vacation was when someone
[1:02:30] said I looked them up and their brandom
[1:02:33] mites and when I when I read that I
[1:02:36] thought oh no little
[1:02:39] gal you can call me a lot of things but
[1:02:43] you're not going to call me that and get
[1:02:45] by I'm going to at least let the world
[1:02:47] know I am not that and I am preparing a
[1:02:50] two sermon series on why I am not a
[1:02:54] brand mind and I'll be preaching that
[1:02:55] for you in a few weeks I'm not going to
[1:02:58] carry that kind of a title I may
[1:03:01] appreciate fully the ministry of brother
[1:03:04] brandham but I neither worship him nor
[1:03:07] adore him the way that some people do I
[1:03:11] love him I'm thankful for him I do not
[1:03:14] believe that he was
[1:03:16] inherent I do not believe that he was
[1:03:19] infallible I do not believe that he
[1:03:21] understood everything he was just a Serv
[1:03:24] that God was using but even comments
[1:03:28] like that make people
[1:03:30] curious and they go to the website and
[1:03:33] they hear something they've never heard
[1:03:35] before and you're doing Mission work and
[1:03:38] all you're doing is sitting at home and
[1:03:40] God is using these things that sister
[1:03:42] Anna is putting together the thing the
[1:03:45] the the moments that brother H God's
[1:03:47] using them to reach people that we would
[1:03:50] never be able to reach otherwise aren't
[1:03:52] we blessed so I I need to announce that
[1:03:55] there will be Services next weekend
[1:03:58] Saturday night and Sunday morning we
[1:04:00] will go right ahead with our fellowship
[1:04:03] weekend even though brother Dwayne
[1:04:05] called he said you know I haven't been
[1:04:06] preaching long brother Shelley and I've
[1:04:09] never had to call and say that I won't
[1:04:11] be able to make it but but we let him
[1:04:13] know that we were expecting that call
[1:04:16] and we completely understood we wouldn't
[1:04:19] want her to do anything that would that
[1:04:22] would uh jeopardize her health or the
[1:04:25] health of that little baby but we're
[1:04:27] hoping that they will be with us on our
[1:04:30] February fellowship meeting uh we'll

[1:14:03] midst of the congregation isn't that
[1:14:06] good and he said he had a voice he had a
[1:14:09] mouth he had a tongue he had words he
[1:14:13] said hearken ye
[1:14:15] all
[1:14:17] Judah and ye
[1:14:20] inhabitants of
[1:14:21] Jerusalem and Thou King
[1:14:25] Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you
[1:14:30] be Not Afraid nor
[1:14:34] dismayed by reason of this great
[1:14:38] multitude for the battle Hallelujah for
[1:14:42] the battle is not
[1:14:48] yours but God's it doesn't matter
[1:14:51] whether we're talking about the war in
[1:14:53] Israel or whether we're talking about a
[1:14:56] situation of trouble in your life the
[1:14:59] battle is not yours The Battle Belongs
[1:15:03] to God if we can only remember that
[1:15:07] tomorrow go ye down against them behold
[1:15:11] they come up by the Cliff of ziss and ye
[1:15:14] shall find them at the end of the brook
[1:15:18] before the Wilderness of
[1:15:21] yuel ye shall not need to fight in this
[1:15:25] battle that's a good
[1:15:27] thing set
[1:15:31] yourselves
[1:15:33] placement is an important thing in this
[1:15:35] hour to know where we're placed to be
[1:15:39] placed in the right place to be placed
[1:15:42] in the right position to be set
[1:15:46] s
[1:15:49] set and set yourselves stand can ye
[1:15:54] still and see the
[1:16:00] Salvation see Yeshua in your
[1:16:04] midst with you oh Judah and Jerusalem
[1:16:09] fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out
[1:16:13] against them for the Lord will be with
[1:16:20] you and Jehosaphat bowed his head with
[1:16:23] his face to the ground and all Judah and
[1:16:28] the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before
[1:16:32] the Lord they weren't praising now they
[1:16:36] fell before the Lord
[1:16:39] worshiping the
[1:16:41] Lord this was intimate time this was
[1:16:45] personal time it wasn't celebration it
[1:16:49] wasn't jumping and dancing and shouting
[1:16:52] out it was worshiping him bowed down
[1:16:56] before him and the Levites of the
[1:16:59] children of the coites and of the
[1:17:02] children of the chlorites stood up to
[1:17:06] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:17:09] loud voice on
[1:17:13] high so all you
[1:17:17] critics uh of of the real and the way we
[1:17:20] worship and you just think it's an un
[1:17:23] necessary to be emotional and
[1:17:25] unnecessary to be loud and it's not
[1:17:28] biblical and it has no place in the
[1:17:30] Bible and no no foundation in the Bible
[1:17:34] oh yes it does come on someone mockingly
[1:17:39] said Do You Believe Yeshua or Jesus and
[1:17:42] his disciples would worship this way my
[1:17:45] answer would be absolutely they did they
[1:17:48] didn't worship like a Catholic there
[1:17:50] were no Catholics they didn't worship
[1:17:53] like Pentecostals there weren't any
[1:17:55] Pentecostals they worshiped like
[1:17:58] Jews and Jews worship like the Bible
[1:18:02] said praise the Lord in the dance praise
[1:18:05] the Lord on the high sounding symbol
[1:18:08] praise the Lord with a loud voice so I
[1:18:11] have no reason to believe that they
[1:18:13] worshiped any differently than the
[1:18:15] presedent of the people and it was so
[1:18:18] common and so expected and such an
[1:18:21] acceptable expression of Praise that it
[1:18:25] doesn't even have to be mentioned in the
[1:18:26] New Testament because this is the way
[1:18:29] they were worshiping so all the Church
[1:18:31] of Christ people who say that
[1:18:33] instruments are not allowed in church
[1:18:35] because there are no instruments in the
[1:18:37] New Testament instruments were so much a
[1:18:40] part of praise and worship that they
[1:18:42] didn't even have to be mentioned in the
[1:18:44] New Testament it was never considered
[1:18:46] that anybody was ever going to have a
[1:18:48] problem because this is the common way
[1:18:52] the symbols were there the drums were
[1:18:54] there the stringed instruments were
[1:18:57] there it's just the way they did so
[1:19:00] people ought to be a little real and a
[1:19:02] little fairer and here's the problem
[1:19:03] they're trying to understand a hebraic
[1:19:06] Bible with a Greek
[1:19:09] mindset it's the same conflict that the
[1:19:12] prophets talk about in the Old Testament
[1:19:15] it's the sons of Greece and the sons of
[1:19:18] Zion Right In conflict with one another
[1:19:21] the sons of Zion know what pleases the
[1:19:24] father they know how to worship all
[1:19:26] right and the Levites and the children
[1:19:28] of the Kites and of the children of the
[1:19:30] kites stood up to praise the Lord God of
[1:19:33] Israel how a loud voice with a loud
[1:19:38] voice on
[1:19:41] high that's what it says in my Bible may
[1:19:44] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:19:47] his word you may be
[1:19:49] seated the battle is not ours
[1:19:53] God had a strategy to win this
[1:19:57] battle God has a strategy to win the
[1:20:00] battle in your
[1:20:02] life God knows better than anybody else
[1:20:05] how to get the
[1:20:07] victory he's a Victor somebody say Jesus
[1:20:11] is the Victor Jesus vict over every
[1:20:14] power over every principality over every
[1:20:17] demon come on over every evil influence
[1:20:21] over Hamas
[1:20:23] amen Jesus Is the Victor and he doesn't
[1:20:27] change up his strategy there may be some
[1:20:29] different pieces of the puzzle but if
[1:20:32] God used praise and worship to win the
[1:20:36] battle for Jehoshaphat he'll use praise
[1:20:40] and worship to win the battle in your
[1:20:42] life how many of you learning that
[1:20:46] because before you you you you fall down
[1:20:48] the rabbit hole of of complaining and
[1:20:51] murmuring and belly aing you remember
[1:20:54] whoa if I'll just take a moment and and
[1:20:57] show my gratitude and my thankfulness to
[1:21:01] God if I instead of murmuring about what
[1:21:04] I don't have if I'll just take a moment
[1:21:07] and thank him for what I do have and
[1:21:10] then at the end of that you just really
[1:21:11] don't even want to complain anymore
[1:21:13] because you realized how blessed you are
[1:21:16] how many of you know you're blessed you
[1:21:18] know it now uh we're talking about uh
[1:21:24] levite
[1:21:26] yahel son of
[1:21:29] Zachariah he was a
[1:21:31] levite and he was from the family of
[1:21:35] Asaf you know when you're reading the
[1:21:37] book of Psalm sometime you're reading
[1:21:40] the writings and the spiritual songs of
[1:21:43] King
[1:21:44] David but sometimes you are
[1:21:47] reading the the poetry and the spiritual
[1:21:51] songs of
[1:21:53] a levitical family a priesthood family a
[1:21:56] family of priests who come from the the
[1:22:00] the one man
[1:22:01] Asaf the sons of Asaf were priests and
[1:22:07] they were prophetic as you found out
[1:22:10] yeazel had a a yielding to the spirit of
[1:22:14] the Lord and the spirit of the Lord fell
[1:22:17] on him and used his voice and you this
[1:22:20] was before the gifts of the Spirit
[1:22:23] but here is a prophet a prophecy going
[1:22:26] forth from a
[1:22:28] priest and if you do a little research
[1:22:31] on Asaf you find out he was prominent as
[1:22:35] a singer and a Seer a
[1:22:39] Seer uh uh in David's court so he was
[1:22:43] both a singer and a priest and a
[1:22:47] songwriter and a prophet and God moved
[1:22:52] in his life life he's described as the
[1:22:55] chief of the
[1:22:57] Levites he had uh been appointed to
[1:23:01] minister before the Ark of the Lord what
[1:23:04] a privilege to stand before what was the
[1:23:08] ark of the Lord that was the Ark of the
[1:23:11] Covenant and
[1:23:13] Asaf had some descendants and one of
[1:23:16] those descendants was yeazel and he was
[1:23:20] appointed by his bread brethen under the
[1:23:24] inspiration of the voice of God to stand
[1:23:28] before the Ark of the Lord and Minister
[1:23:32] not to the
[1:23:36] people but to minister unto the
[1:23:40] Lord H we know I heard brother gy say
[1:23:44] last Sunday that we are ordained and
[1:23:48] anointed and and chosen spiritually as
[1:23:52] both
[1:23:54] priests and what else
[1:23:57] Kings we have authority to rule and have
[1:24:02] dominion in the spirit and we have
[1:24:05] authority as a priest to minister not
[1:24:10] only to others but for
[1:24:14] Forefront first of all and most
[1:24:17] importantly we have the privilege to
[1:24:21] minister
[1:24:23] unto the Lord anybody with me you can't
[1:24:27] really minister to the people until you
[1:24:31] understand the responsibility to
[1:24:34] minister unto the Lord every believer
[1:24:37] not just preachers not just not just
[1:24:40] those who have five-fold uh gifts but
[1:24:43] every person filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:24:47] has that a
[1:24:49] calling and an anointing to to serve as
[1:24:54] priest and King and we minister to one
[1:24:59] another as as priesthood of a new in the
[1:25:02] priesthood of the New Covenant but we
[1:25:05] first minister to the Lord how do we do
[1:25:08] that well I sang that you sang that a
[1:25:11] moment ago David was doing just that he
[1:25:14] was ministering unto the Lord when he
[1:25:17] said bless the
[1:25:19] Lord hello come on get with me
[1:25:23] bless the
[1:25:25] Lord oh my mind will and
[1:25:30] emotions yeah so I I if if real
[1:25:36] worship and real Ministry comes out of
[1:25:40] the inside of the inside that's
[1:25:44] spirit and it cannot it cannot be
[1:25:48] demonstrated from Spirit to flesh it it
[1:25:52] must pass through the inner dimension of
[1:25:55] man so it may originate in the spirit
[1:25:59] that's the only kind of praise and
[1:26:01] worship that God will honor is that that
[1:26:03] originates in spirit and in order for it
[1:26:07] to transfer itself to the demonstration
[1:26:11] of the body you know some people say
[1:26:13] well I have a feeling that he was in the
[1:26:17] flesh well I hope he
[1:26:20] was because if he wasn't in the flesh he
[1:26:24] was a disembodied spirit and I'm not
[1:26:26] interested in anything he does somebody
[1:26:29] said I saw him and he was just waving
[1:26:33] his arms and carrying on he must have
[1:26:36] been in the flesh sure he was sure he
[1:26:39] was his flesh is the only thing that God
[1:26:43] has given him to
[1:26:47] demonstrate what's happening in the
[1:26:49] Inner
[1:26:51] Man are you in the flesh when you raise
[1:26:54] up your hands and praise the Lord sure
[1:26:56] you are but your praise doesn't
[1:27:00] originate in your
[1:27:02] flesh it doesn't originate in your body
[1:27:06] it's origin
[1:27:08] Hallelujah is the
[1:27:10] inside of the
[1:27:13] inside that which originates that which
[1:27:15] is birth in the spirit passes through
[1:27:19] the realm of mind you've got to make it
[1:27:22] choice
[1:27:24] will and then what else
[1:27:28] emotions so yes praise and worship is
[1:27:33] going to be
[1:27:36] emotional because your emotions were
[1:27:39] given to you by God to help you
[1:27:47] express that's why we have
[1:27:51] emotions
[1:27:53] they run
[1:27:55] a they lead us
[1:27:58] wrong come on we respond emotionally
[1:28:02] sometime without faith and we respond
[1:28:07] negatively and in an ill way and it
[1:28:11] accomplishes nothing but your emotions
[1:28:14] are not your
[1:28:16] enemy your soul is not your
[1:28:19] enemy it's a gift of God to filter life
[1:28:24] it helps your spirit to be in touch with
[1:28:26] your
[1:28:27] flesh it's the
[1:28:29] middleman the breath of God's spirit
[1:28:33] ruach hakodesh the breath of the Holy
[1:28:37] Spirit went into a flesh body one made
[1:28:41] of the earth a D from the earth from the
[1:28:45] red clay he breathed breath into the
[1:28:49] nostrils of
[1:28:50] Adam the the dirt and Adam
[1:28:55] became a living
[1:28:58] Soul he was breath and body before he
[1:29:03] became a living Soul breath entered into
[1:29:06] a body before he became a living Soul
[1:29:09] his soul was given to him that he might
[1:29:13] remain in contact with his
[1:29:16] environment there is a a sense in our
[1:29:21] life that we we have to be connected to
[1:29:24] the environment around us and the
[1:29:25] atmosphere around us while maintaining
[1:29:28] our connection to God and without our
[1:29:31] mind without our will and without our
[1:29:34] emotions we would not be able to stay
[1:29:37] connected to Earth to reality to life to
[1:29:41] family to to
[1:29:43] obligations to jobs to the Natural Life
[1:29:47] that we must live if it were not for the
[1:29:50] mind and the will and the emotion ions
[1:29:52] the soul of man we would not be able to
[1:29:54] remain connected to the life around us
[1:29:57] to the Earth around us to the
[1:29:59] environment around us to the atmosphere
[1:30:01] around us and had it not been for mind
[1:30:03] will and emotion our spirit would not be
[1:30:05] able to always remain
[1:30:08] connected to God our creator and the
[1:30:11] inspiration of our life because there
[1:30:14] needed to be a way of expressing our
[1:30:17] gratitude our Thanksgiving so yes let me
[1:30:20] just boil that down for you there's
[1:30:23] going to be
[1:30:24] emotion in your
[1:30:28] praise there's going to be
[1:30:31] emotion in your in your
[1:30:34] worship now sometimes you hear Brother
[1:30:36] brandham speaking negatively about
[1:30:40] emotion and it's unfair for you and for
[1:30:44] anybody else including preachers to take
[1:30:48] a paragraph out of context and make it
[1:30:52] sound like he was against emotion listen
[1:30:55] to me carefully brother brandom doesn't
[1:30:58] have that privilege he cannot be against
[1:31:04] emotion he can't do that somebody said
[1:31:07] well it sounded to me like you didn't
[1:31:08] keep reading right he can't be against
[1:31:12] emotion because emotion is a part of the
[1:31:16] of the tripartate
[1:31:19] man anybody with me
[1:31:22] so you can't just say I'm against emot
[1:31:24] you can't be against
[1:31:26] emotion remember I told you that some
[1:31:28] people will say I'm not emotional until
[1:31:31] the cat
[1:31:34] dies and their life is
[1:31:37] over
[1:31:39] hello everybody has the ability to
[1:31:42] express emotion now some of us have been
[1:31:44] through so much we suppress our emotions
[1:31:48] and when we suppress emotions we form a
[1:31:51] toxic environment in our inner
[1:31:53] man God never intended for you to always
[1:31:57] suppress your emotions you have to learn
[1:32:01] to control them you have to learn you
[1:32:04] have to learn to express them without
[1:32:08] sin Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your
[1:32:11] wrath be
[1:32:14] angry be
[1:32:16] angry and sin not Bible said so let not
[1:32:20] the Sun go down on your wrath God
[1:32:22] doesn't
[1:32:23] care if sometimes you're angry
[1:32:28] that's it's how you express your anger
[1:32:32] that can get your spirit man in trouble
[1:32:34] that's good teaching this morning if you
[1:32:37] got to pound the
[1:32:39] wall you got to put a hole in the wall
[1:32:42] because you're angry you're out of
[1:32:45] line you're out of line when you do
[1:32:47] something like that when you kick an
[1:32:50] animal or kick a child or kick a hole in
[1:32:53] the door that's not all right there's a
[1:32:56] way to be angry and sin not what is that
[1:33:01] to control that anger find you something
[1:33:04] to do count to 10 go catch a fish go
[1:33:09] bake a cake go eat a
[1:33:14] cake I've been pretty angry before you
[1:33:19] know you got to let that
[1:33:22] out put you on some praise
[1:33:27] music find a way it's not sin to be
[1:33:31] emotional brother brandom couldn't be
[1:33:34] against
[1:33:36] emotion but what he was against is
[1:33:39] thinking that your
[1:33:41] emotions uh validate your
[1:33:45] experience you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:33:48] because you were
[1:33:50] emotional right
[1:33:52] see he wasn't against speaking in
[1:33:54] tongues but he was against thinking that
[1:33:58] because you spoke in tongues you've got
[1:34:00] the genuine Holy Ghost he said it's got
[1:34:02] to be more than that you've got to live
[1:34:04] a life surrendered to every word of God
[1:34:07] are you with me so sometimes he's
[1:34:09] preaching on tongues as brother gy
[1:34:11] pointed out and it sounds like he's
[1:34:13] against it when he's indeed not against
[1:34:17] it how could he doesn't get the
[1:34:19] privilege of being against
[1:34:22] it because God is for it you can't be
[1:34:26] Godly and be against what God is
[1:34:29] for you can't be Godly and be for what
[1:34:32] God is against hello so tongues are
[1:34:37] important but they are not the initial
[1:34:40] evidence you can talk in tongues and be
[1:34:43] full of the
[1:34:44] devil you can get a tongue that'll you
[1:34:47] know tat tat and tat tie and do all
[1:34:50] kinds of things but if if your life is
[1:34:53] not reflecting the character of Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ you can't trust the tongue that's
[1:34:58] right same way with the
[1:34:59] emotion when you hear Brother brandom
[1:35:02] talking about emotion he's talking about
[1:35:05] people getting so emotional that they
[1:35:07] miss the
[1:35:09] word and they miss the importance of
[1:35:12] Revelation and they exchange a
[1:35:17] sensation for a real deep walk with with
[1:35:21] God are you with me yes but you got to
[1:35:24] have emotion he says to us multiple
[1:35:29] times no emotion no life are you with me
[1:35:34] now they don't have this but I don't
[1:35:36] have any quotes prepared today so I'll
[1:35:39] just go over here to my handy little
[1:35:41] notes and I'll just put in the word
[1:35:47] emotion and I'll just tell you see if I
[1:35:50] can pull up something here
[1:35:53] I don't remember if I called it emotions
[1:35:55] or
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] emotional but I can find you some things
[1:36:04] here
[1:36:06] 64 paragraph
[1:36:08] one
[1:36:11] perseverant he said so I'm not much for
[1:36:13] dead
[1:36:17] things he he he'd be kind of miserable
[1:36:21] around folks who believe it's sin to
[1:36:24] show any
[1:36:25] emotion he said so anything without
[1:36:28] emotion is
[1:36:30] dead the scientific research will prove
[1:36:33] that anything without emotion so if your
[1:36:36] experience hasn't got a
[1:36:38] little emotion in
[1:36:41] it hello he said you better bury
[1:36:45] it and get something that has got some
[1:36:48] emotion in it that's right exactly true
[1:36:52] now I can go on and on and on and on see
[1:36:58] CU I'm still
[1:37:02] scrolling still
[1:37:05] scrolling that's not a man who was
[1:37:07] against emotion still scrolling still
[1:37:11] scrolling finally came to an end uh I I
[1:37:15] finished in 54 it goes from uh my quotes
[1:37:18] there are from like 65 backwards to 54
[1:37:22] so 54 all the way up to 65 he's still
[1:37:25] telling us that there's going to need to
[1:37:28] be a little emotion in your
[1:37:31] religion because the lack of emotion in
[1:37:33] your religion is
[1:37:35] really a lack of
[1:37:38] life he said in anything that doesn't
[1:37:40] have life in it is good for only one
[1:37:42] thing bury it so you will find those
[1:37:46] quotes where brother brandham says some
[1:37:49] things about emotion and people people
[1:37:51] love their
[1:37:53] favorites but I'm going to do when I'm
[1:37:56] looking into something I'm going to do
[1:37:57] with it like I do Christmas I'm not
[1:38:00] going to just give you the quotes that
[1:38:02] prove my point I'm going to let you know
[1:38:05] that he says some things about emotion
[1:38:07] about the Pentecostal church about
[1:38:09] trusting in a sensation about getting
[1:38:12] worked
[1:38:15] up and missing the genuine
[1:38:19] experience between the connection are
[1:38:21] you with me between you and God but you
[1:38:25] can't take some
[1:38:26] instruction about emotion and how to
[1:38:30] find the balance in it and then turn
[1:38:32] around and tell me that he's against
[1:38:34] emotion emotion is a part of life it's a
[1:38:37] part of Praise it's a part of worship
[1:38:39] it's a part of loving
[1:38:41] somebody it's a part of being connected
[1:38:43] to somebody come
[1:38:45] on and when someone has repressed their
[1:38:50] emotions
[1:38:52] they build a a toxicity in their body
[1:38:55] that not only affects the way they
[1:38:57] connect to God it affects the way they
[1:39:00] connect with one another and it affects
[1:39:02] the way that their body
[1:39:04] operates so you want to find a way to
[1:39:08] have healthy
[1:39:09] emotions negative emotions that are not
[1:39:12] dealt with by the word and by the spirit
[1:39:15] become disease in the body so you want
[1:39:18] to deal with that stuff before it's
[1:39:21] starts dealing with you in a physical
[1:39:23] way you don't have to believe that it's
[1:39:26] a fact of brain science they now know
[1:39:30] that it has such a profound effect on
[1:39:33] the brain which is the which is the the
[1:39:35] hard drive of the entire body and they
[1:39:39] know that having the right attitude
[1:39:41] toward your sickness having the right
[1:39:43] attitude toward your situation
[1:39:46] drastically changes the outcome just by
[1:39:49] having the right dealing with with your
[1:39:51] emotions just dealing with it in the
[1:39:53] right way and not in a fanatical way I'm
[1:39:56] not here to encourage you to be fanatic
[1:39:59] but I'm here to encourage you not to
[1:40:01] deny or to suppress the fact that there
[1:40:05] will be emotion in our praise but we're
[1:40:09] not going to leave here and say I know
[1:40:10] I'm a Child of God because I jumped up
[1:40:12] and down is anybody going to say that
[1:40:14] let me look around is there anybody
[1:40:16] that's going to think because you felt a
[1:40:17] little whoos that you're God's child
[1:40:21] that whoos is the is the is the
[1:40:23] confirmation that you're right no no no
[1:40:25] no no the confirmation that you're God's
[1:40:27] child is his
[1:40:31] word it's not how you feel but we're
[1:40:34] going to feel and we're going to lift up
[1:40:37] a loud voice on high and we're going to
[1:40:40] bow in our faces sometime and Worship
[1:40:42] the Lord because that was God's strategy
[1:40:45] for battle it was then and it is now and
[1:40:51] so Asaf one of the chief Levites was
[1:40:54] appointed to minister before the Ark of
[1:40:56] the Lord and he and his brothers were
[1:40:59] appointed
[1:41:01] appointed
[1:41:03] appointed it's an important thing to
[1:41:06] note to sing the songs of
[1:41:10] Thanksgiving to the
[1:41:13] Lord I want to I want to talk a little
[1:41:16] bit about being appointed to praise the
[1:41:19] Lord I it's not just our
[1:41:23] reaction it's not just what we do but we
[1:41:26] really have an appointment by God as an
[1:41:31] end time
[1:41:32] bride to keep our lives
[1:41:37] engaged with him through praise and
[1:41:41] worship we maintain do you understand
[1:41:44] that I said do you understand that we
[1:41:47] maintain our connectivity with God
[1:41:52] we maintain our relationship with God by
[1:41:55] our
[1:41:58] response you know I was taught that when
[1:42:00] you're spoken to you respond to someone
[1:42:04] of any age other than yours and you
[1:42:07] might ought to start practicing now I
[1:42:10] was taught that you respond to a man by
[1:42:14] saying yes
[1:42:16] sir doesn't mean he's over you your lost
[1:42:21] man your dad it just means you're
[1:42:24] respecting him as a person so yes sir is
[1:42:29] a
[1:42:31] response
[1:42:33] yeah I need a little help
[1:42:36] here yeah is not a proper
[1:42:40] response I'm going to say it
[1:42:44] again I'm not going to accept
[1:42:48] that I've lived too long here on the
[1:42:51] earth I'm not going to accept that kind
[1:42:53] of a response
[1:42:55] yeah I'm not going to accept
[1:42:58] yeah Y which is not a word you can say
[1:43:04] yes or you can say yes
[1:43:07] sir you can say no or you can say no sir
[1:43:12] that's an acceptable response I'm going
[1:43:15] to give you the same respect I'm going
[1:43:17] to give you the same courtesy you're
[1:43:20] going to need to teach your children to
[1:43:22] show that kind of respect because it's
[1:43:25] important in this day where there is no
[1:43:28] respect on you you should show that
[1:43:31] respect you'd be surprised how opening
[1:43:34] the door for a
[1:43:36] Stranger by pausing an extra minute to
[1:43:39] let another group come out or let
[1:43:42] another group go in you'd be surprised
[1:43:44] how most of the time it will generate a
[1:43:48] response of gratitude back
[1:43:51] I've said this before and if this sounds
[1:43:53] racial or Prejudice I pray you'll
[1:43:55] forgive me but I I try to be mindful to
[1:43:59] let people come in and to hold the door
[1:44:01] stay a little extra when they say thank
[1:44:04] you I sound like a Chick-fil-A uh
[1:44:06] employee I always respond my pleasure
[1:44:09] and it
[1:44:11] is it is a pleasure to do an act of
[1:44:15] kindness for somebody else but if that
[1:44:18] person happens to be a black woman or
[1:44:21] even a black man I go out of my way I
[1:44:26] pause extra long I'll stay extra long to
[1:44:30] hold the door for them because I want
[1:44:33] them to know in my mind and in my heart
[1:44:37] they are worthy of the same
[1:44:39] respect it's vitally important in this
[1:44:43] hour you may have to practice on a
[1:44:45] little Mexican fellow or a little Asian
[1:44:49] woman you may have to go a little bit
[1:44:51] beyond to show a little extra kindness
[1:44:55] and a little extra respect but you would
[1:44:57] be surprised how far that goes oh my it
[1:45:00] goes so far in the Hostile society that
[1:45:04] we live in today we we we should have a
[1:45:07] proper response when we're spoken to
[1:45:10] when God does something in our life we
[1:45:13] ought to have a proper response uh
[1:45:16] Thanksgiving and praise and later
[1:45:18] worship is just an overl flow of what we
[1:45:21] recognize God doing in our lives and we
[1:45:25] should recognize that there is a sound
[1:45:28] that he wants to hear a song that he
[1:45:31] wants to hear a people that he wants to
[1:45:34] hear from above
[1:45:36] all other
[1:45:40] people you can say all day long to me I
[1:45:43] enjoy are you listening
[1:45:45] folks you can say to me all day long I
[1:45:48] enjoyed the sermon I enjoyed the message
[1:45:50] I enjoyed the service and I'm always
[1:45:52] blessed to hear that but if my wife ever
[1:45:55] says that to me if she ever says honey
[1:45:58] that was a good service I really enjoyed
[1:46:00] that service I really enjoyed what you
[1:46:02] had to say this morning how many of you
[1:46:04] know it it it doesn't silence your
[1:46:07] voice it doesn't negate my gratitude for
[1:46:10] you saying it but she's my my sweetheart
[1:46:13] and when she says to me you did a good
[1:46:18] job it's supposed to be that way way
[1:46:21] when your wife says something to you
[1:46:23] when your husband says something to you
[1:46:25] when they stop to thank you for
[1:46:27] something and and and and yes I believe
[1:46:29] it's a wife's place to take care of her
[1:46:32] husband the best she can and to provide
[1:46:34] a meal for him but that doesn't mean
[1:46:36] that he shouldn't be thankful for
[1:46:40] it I I've had women come here through
[1:46:42] the years and tell me when they first
[1:46:43] got married their husband threw their
[1:46:45] food in the trash I I'm going to tell
[1:46:47] you
[1:46:49] something
[1:46:51] I'm not a woman but if I had have been
[1:46:52] I'd I'd have wanted to go throw all of
[1:46:54] his underwear in the
[1:46:58] trash listen I've I've eaten some meals
[1:47:02] in my lifetime that weren't the
[1:47:05] best it's been years
[1:47:07] ago my wife Came From Another World
[1:47:10] excuse me another country Canada and she
[1:47:13] had to learn a few things about southern
[1:47:16] eating she had to learn that there are
[1:47:19] more vegetables in the world than
[1:47:24] carrots then she had to learn but I did
[1:47:27] my
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:29] best to to find something to
[1:47:33] say my children to this day thank their
[1:47:38] mother for the
[1:47:40] meal when we go out to eat and I buy the
[1:47:43] meal they say and sometimes I say to
[1:47:45] them uh uh Benjamin particularly I'll
[1:47:47] say honey You' thanked me three times
[1:47:51] you don't have to thank me again you're
[1:47:54] welcome you're welcome I wanted to do it
[1:47:57] but how many of you know it makes us
[1:47:59] feel good it does it does it's my job
[1:48:01] I'm going to do it it's my place it's
[1:48:03] it's what I want to do I'm I'm a
[1:48:06] patriarch it's what I want to do in my
[1:48:08] family when I can but oh how nice it is
[1:48:11] to have response well this is kind of
[1:48:12] what praise is it's a response to him
[1:48:16] and he wants to hear Above All Else
[1:48:18] above all there's going to be a lot of
[1:48:20] Hallelujah is lifted up in this nation
[1:48:22] today most services are over by
[1:48:26] now there were a lot of Hallelujah
[1:48:28] lifted up this morning lot of amens lot
[1:48:32] of praise the
[1:48:34] Lords lot of oo and us but he would
[1:48:38] rather hear from
[1:48:43] you he wherever his bride is gathered
[1:48:47] together today you're Hallelujah help me
[1:48:51] somebody you're
[1:48:53] amen you're praise the
[1:48:57] Lord when the elect
[1:49:00] responds when the bride says praise God
[1:49:06] hallelujah when the wife of the
[1:49:09] bridegroom gives him
[1:49:11] thanks gives him praise it catches
[1:49:16] him it catches and captures his heart
[1:49:22] in a way that theatrics cannot do it
[1:49:26] light shows
[1:49:30] and churches with coffee shops and
[1:49:33] tattoo parlors and colored lights on the
[1:49:37] backdrop and smoke and the first thing
[1:49:40] you do when you go into modern church
[1:49:41] today turn off all the
[1:49:46] lights Turn All the Lights On does does
[1:49:50] that make you
[1:49:54] comfortable some years ago
[1:49:57] I went to preach in a church in
[1:50:00] Ohio somewhat message somewhat
[1:50:05] nothing and the first night I went in
[1:50:07] it's a little old country looking Church
[1:50:10] the first night I went
[1:50:13] in you know it's just just pews just
[1:50:16] little plain looking little building you
[1:50:17] go in worship go they turn the lights
[1:50:19] off
[1:50:21] and I sat there for a
[1:50:23] while and I grew more uncomfortable by
[1:50:25] the minute and I thought I can't do
[1:50:28] anything about it they sit in my church
[1:50:29] and then I thought hey you brought me
[1:50:31] here because you wanted me to help you
[1:50:33] in some way now I'm going to go I walk
[1:50:36] right back to where the pastor was and I
[1:50:38] said listen if you want I'll go ahead
[1:50:39] and preach tonight but if you want me to
[1:50:42] stay the rest of the weekend turn the
[1:50:44] lights
[1:50:47] on he said brother are you serious I
[1:50:49] said said I'm as serious as I've ever
[1:50:51] been in my life I'm uncomfortable
[1:50:53] sitting in the dark I don't know who's
[1:50:56] here I don't know who's coming and going
[1:50:58] and I don't know why we have to turn the
[1:51:00] lights off to welcome Jesus he's not
[1:51:02] afraid of the
[1:51:04] dark he doesn't have to have it dark he
[1:51:07] didn't come in slipping through the
[1:51:09] Shadows I I realize that he's not afraid
[1:51:12] of the dark but he don't have to have it
[1:51:14] in the dark you turn on the lights we're
[1:51:17] Children of the
[1:51:18] light and you know what the pastor did
[1:51:20] it and he did it with a good attitude
[1:51:22] and God blessed his church and blessed
[1:51:24] his family and blessed his
[1:51:27] people and there were some of them
[1:51:29] including the pastor there were two or
[1:51:31] three people that I can think of right
[1:51:34] now in those meetings that are now in
[1:51:36] the presence of the Lord died early age
[1:51:40] stricken by different things and taken
[1:51:43] out but I was able to rest knowing that
[1:51:46] they had really had a breakthrough in
[1:51:48] the spirit we gathered GED in a home and
[1:51:50] fellowship with the family that had been
[1:51:52] so broken and so abused by church and to
[1:51:55] see the love that was being shown and
[1:51:58] the way they were coming out of their
[1:51:59] shell and I was so glad that I obeyed
[1:52:02] the Lord by something as simple as
[1:52:04] saying
[1:52:05] hey turn on the lights in here we're not
[1:52:09] here for a
[1:52:12] concert we're not here for some kind of
[1:52:15] show we're not here to be entertained
[1:52:18] we're here to minister
[1:52:20] see a lot of you just came to be
[1:52:22] ministered
[1:52:23] to I pray God will meet you but some of
[1:52:27] us came today to minister to the
[1:52:32] Lord and we realize that as his bride
[1:52:36] it's not our option it's our
[1:52:40] appointment just like there were sons of
[1:52:42] Asaf appointed as singers and praisers
[1:52:47] and Priests to serve the Lord Lord to
[1:52:51] minister unto the Lord his bride has
[1:52:55] been appointed to worship him to
[1:52:59] minister before the Lord in Praise we're
[1:53:03] appointed to do it how many of you want
[1:53:05] to do what you were created to do you
[1:53:08] want to do what you were appointed to do
[1:53:10] I want you to know there are times that
[1:53:12] God gets no glory in
[1:53:14] noise but you let that noise come out of
[1:53:18] his bride you let her get excited about
[1:53:21] him coming
[1:53:23] in that's what we're
[1:53:25] doing we know that if we praise him he
[1:53:30] comes we know that if we glorify him he
[1:53:34] comes and oh does he want to come he
[1:53:38] wants to come so as we read in 2
[1:53:41] Chronicles 20 the next morning I'm

[1:59:56] himself to
[1:59:58] anoint
[1:59:59] Hallelujah if God gives a real Vision he
[2:00:03] releases the provision to cover the
[2:00:06] vision if God appoints someone to praise
[2:00:09] him he's going to release the anointing
[2:00:12] they need to do whatever it is that
[2:00:13] they're called to do and part of your
[2:00:15] calling I just don't know what I what

[2:00:21] you today you may be an apostle you may

[2:00:25] an evangelist you may have some form of
[2:00:27] pull pit Ministry I don't know I can't
[2:00:30] say unless he shows me I can't confirm
[2:00:32] any of that but I'll tell you what I can
[2:00:34] confirm that if you're a part of the end
[2:00:36] time bride of Jesus Christ you have been
[2:00:40] appointed to praise the Lord in this
[2:00:44] hour you've been appointed to praise Him
[2:00:47] you've been called to praise you were
[2:00:48] born to praise
[2:00:52] him as they went out before the Army
[2:00:55] listen he said he appointed singers unto
[2:00:57] the Lord that they should praise the
[2:01:00] beauty of
[2:01:02] Holiness that's not your Holiness the
[2:01:05] only thing that makes you
[2:01:10] holy it's not your long hair here's
[2:01:13] where people always listen to
[2:01:17] me it's not your long dress that makes
[2:01:20] you
[2:01:21] holy it's not your La lack of makeup
[2:01:24] that makes you holy come
[2:01:28] on it's not a man not
[2:01:33] gambling getting away from
[2:01:35] pornography or any of the sort that
[2:01:37] makes him
[2:01:38] holy the only thing that makes anything
[2:01:41] holy is when God gets in it remember the
[2:01:44] bush I don't have to preach on the bush
[2:01:47] do I it was just an ordin
[2:01:49] bush until one day God said I'm getting
[2:01:52] in that bush and he came down crawled in
[2:01:55] that bush and Moses had to take off his
[2:01:57] shoes because not only did the Bush
[2:01:59] become holy but the ground around it
[2:02:01] became Holy Ground why because Moses was
[2:02:04] there
[2:02:05] no because God chose the bush and then
[2:02:09] he put himself There You Are Holy
[2:02:12] because you're chosen of the Lord and
[2:02:14] appointed of the Lord and he has put
[2:02:17] himself
[2:02:19] In You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:21] that's good
[2:02:25] preaching appointed singers unto the
[2:02:28] Lord that they should praise the beauty
[2:02:30] of Holiness his Holiness Lord have mercy
[2:02:34] if you can't think of anything else to
[2:02:35] say you can say you're holy that's You
[2:02:38] Are Holy brother the value of his
[2:02:41] Holiness is the the fullness of the
[2:02:44] value of his Holiness is yet to be seen
[2:02:46] But as the world gets darker and uglier
[2:02:49] and more putrifying every day that we
[2:02:52] live come on more disgusting every day
[2:02:54] we live his Holiness becomes more
[2:02:58] valuable oh to sit a few
[2:03:01] minutes to sit a few minutes in the
[2:03:04] Holiness of the
[2:03:07] Lord to know that he who is Holy has
[2:03:11] come down to inhabit the Praises of his
[2:03:16] people in a minute we're going to get
[2:03:18] out from R of
[2:03:19] that and we're either going to go home
[2:03:22] and eat leftovers or we're going to go
[2:03:24] out into the
[2:03:26] world and you're going to you're going
[2:03:28] to run across anything and
[2:03:31] everything some of you're going to have
[2:03:34] a waitress that despises you because of
[2:03:37] the way you
[2:03:42] look simply because of the way you look
[2:03:45] she hates
[2:03:47] you to her already already you're a
[2:03:49] religious
[2:03:51] fanatic if you had blue on your
[2:03:55] eyes if you were showing your
[2:03:57] cleavage if you were melted and poured
[2:04:00] in a pair of of pants
[2:04:02] britches you slithered in like the world
[2:04:05] slithers everywhere they go have you
[2:04:06] ever watched out people Slither wherever
[2:04:09] they go you'd fit in and she'd be glad
[2:04:11] to serve you not every waitress some
[2:04:15] recognize the Holiness of the Lord on
[2:04:17] you and will reward you will treat you
[2:04:19] respectfully because you'll get a whole
[2:04:21] lot more of that than the in the South
[2:04:23] than you will in other places because
[2:04:25] we're in the Bible Belt and you will
[2:04:27] meet
[2:04:28] people you will meet people now when I'm
[2:04:32] out and my family's out in the in the
[2:04:34] shopping we went shopping in the outlets
[2:04:37] while we were there and we meet all
[2:04:38] kinds of Holiness people and and it's a
[2:04:40] shame because most Holiness people will
[2:04:42] barely speak to one another because
[2:04:44] they're they don't know what flavor they
[2:04:47] are and they hardly ever speak to me
[2:04:50] because I have a
[2:04:54] beard and they've already decided if
[2:04:56] you've got a beard you can't be you
[2:04:58] couldn't be Pentecostal UPC and have a
[2:05:00] beard you couldn't be much of
[2:05:03] anything what a shame it is that people
[2:05:06] who have so much in common can't even
[2:05:08] hardly speak to each other but I watch
[2:05:10] them watching
[2:05:15] us they'll show you a little bit of
[2:05:17] respect
[2:05:19] some of you will meet people angry and
[2:05:21] you don't even know why they're angry
[2:05:23] cut you
[2:05:25] off shoot you a little birdie and you
[2:05:27] don't even know what you
[2:05:30] did and you're going to be like me
[2:05:32] tempted to want to say I'll I'll show
[2:05:34] you what to do that finger I'll I'll
[2:05:36] snap it right off if you keep doing but
[2:05:39] you can't do
[2:05:43] that you can't do that you can get angry
[2:05:46] but you can't sin V silence is
[2:05:49] sin come on you don't even know why but
[2:05:52] it's simply because the world recognizes
[2:05:56] that you've made a stand for something
[2:05:58] and we're living in an hour where that
[2:05:59] is very very hated and when we continue
[2:06:02] and we will continue to face those
[2:06:04] things that's when we're going to begin
[2:06:06] to realize the Beauty and the value of
[2:06:09] being in his holy
[2:06:10] presence oh
[2:06:12] Hallelujah there's nobody in here to
[2:06:15] despise you there's nobody in here to
[2:06:17] mistreat you because you're godly you
[2:06:20] just come together in the presence of
[2:06:21] the Lord we might not like everything
[2:06:24] about every person but when we get in
[2:06:26] here we're not supposed to be looking at
[2:06:28] one another we're supposed to be looking
[2:06:30] at the Lord you're not supposed to be
[2:06:33] judging the length of someone else's
[2:06:37] skirt you're supposed to be looking at
[2:06:40] God hello the only way a body can
[2:06:43] function in this hour is if we can learn

[2:07:10] presence of God he's no longer
[2:07:13] attracted when you get together he's no
[2:07:15] longer attracted to come and be a part
[2:07:17] of your Gathering

[2:07:22] your Holiness your separation from the
[2:07:25] world your desire to yield to your
[2:07:27] appointment as a as a praiser and as a

[2:08:50] bucket but they said praise the Lord for
[2:08:53] his Mery mercy endureth forever let's
[2:08:57] read and when they began to
[2:08:59] sing and to
[2:09:04] praise can you see it the Lord set
[2:09:08] ambushments against the children of
[2:09:10] Ammon Moab and mount Seer which were
[2:09:13] come against Judah and look what
[2:09:14] happened read that for me would you and

[2:09:23] about the swords what
[2:09:26] about no when they began to sing and
[2:09:28] praise the Lord when Judah began to sing
[2:09:31] when Judah began to praise the Lord
[2:09:32] hallelujah when Judah began to say
[2:09:35] praise ye the Lord for his mercy
[2:09:38] endureth forever the Lord said that's
[2:09:40] what I want to hear he come right down
[2:09:41] in the
[2:09:44] midst he set up Heavenly ambushments
[2:09:47] against the the enemy and they were
[2:09:50] smitten somebody say again they were
[2:09:52] smitten they were smitten or the
[2:09:54] children of

[2:09:58] inhabitants of Mount sier utterly to
[2:10:00] slay and Destroy them and when they had
[2:10:03] made an end of the inhabitants of zier
[2:10:05] everyone
[2:10:10] helped here come a a a
[2:10:14] group of
[2:10:16] groups that all wanted Israel
[2:10:20] dead but Israel didn't sweat it they
[2:10:23] just sent Judah
[2:10:26] first these are the appointed ones just
[2:10:29] like this little bride has been
[2:10:30] appointed to
[2:10:32] praise and when that Judah went forth
[2:10:34] and they began to praise the Lord God
[2:10:36] set ambushments against them and the
[2:10:38] next thing you know they turned against
[2:10:40] one another and destroyed each other so
[2:10:44] that the battle could be won this is not
[2:10:46] the only time God won a victory like
[2:10:48] that he knows how to make your enemies
[2:10:50] be at peace with you because he turns
[2:10:52] them against one another and they just
[2:10:54] start fighting one
[2:10:57] another you'll just wait till some of
[2:10:59] these Terror groups get mad with one
[2:11:02] another and turn them loose on each
[2:11:04] other don't you folks sleep on Saturday
[2:11:06] night why are you so sleepy in

[2:11:18] watchtower in the wilderness they looked
[2:11:21] unto the multitude and behold there were
[2:11:23] dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none
[2:11:27] escaped what kind of weapons did they

[2:11:56] praise are you emphasizing praise I
[2:12:00] am this is a picture or type of what
[2:12:03] praise can cause to happen in the spirit
[2:12:04] realm during times of spiritual warfare
[2:12:07] many strategic shifts can take place
[2:12:10] because the people Gather in United

[2:20:47] importance of praising he praised at
[2:20:49] least twice as
[2:20:50] much as he

[2:28:03] forth the Praises of him who hath would
[2:28:06] you finish that for me call you out of
[2:28:12] Darkness somebody turned on the
[2:28:15] lights he called us out of
[2:28:18] Darkness into His
[2:28:22] Marvelous Light which in time passed
[2:28:26] were not a
[2:28:30] people here's the one new man here's the
[2:28:33] grafted
[2:28:35] Gentile who in times past were not a
[2:28:40] people but are now the people of
[2:28:44] God which had not a obtained Mercy but
[2:28:48] now have obtained
[2:28:53] Mercy in the New Testament Church there
[2:28:56] was a council of the
[2:28:57] Brethren and they met together to decide
[2:29:01] what kind of law would be inflicted upon
[2:29:04] the
[2:29:07] Gentiles must they be circumcised must
[2:29:10] they do this must they follow that must
[2:29:13] they do the other and the and the the
[2:29:15] summary is given to us in the
[2:29:18] Bible we should never forget the balance
[2:29:21] of the
[2:29:26] scripture this was placed there because
[2:29:28] there are certain things that are
[2:29:30] required of Jews that are not required
[2:29:33] of the
[2:29:35] Nations I know a lot of people have a
[2:29:37] problem with that I didn't say it the
[2:29:39] book said
[2:29:40] it the New Testament tells us that we as
[2:29:45] Gentiles should not eat eat things that
[2:29:47] are that are that die in their own
[2:29:50] blood there are certain requirements
[2:29:52] that that we
[2:29:56] must
[2:29:58] obey how could the disciples how could
[2:30:01] the apostles let Nations off the
[2:30:04] hook because God was already building a
[2:30:08] one new man and he knew that the temple
[2:30:12] would not stand in the Earth for
[2:30:15] thousands of years
[2:30:18] but that God was building a
[2:30:22] temple in the hearts of men and women
[2:30:26] and that there would come a day under a
[2:30:28] New Covenant and remember the newer
[2:30:31] Covenant does not do away with the
[2:30:34] old Jesus said think not that I am come
[2:30:37] to destroy the law but I am come to
[2:30:41] fulfill the law that word fulfill means
[2:30:44] to fill it all up and let me tell you
[2:30:47] something there's nothing there's no one
[2:30:49] there's nobody that has ever fulfilled
[2:30:53] the righteousness of God Like Jesus
[2:30:56] Christ like Yeshua the Messiah he was
[2:31:00] the word in
[2:31:03] flesh that one new man I that that Peter
[2:31:08] is even talking about here he's not just
[2:31:10] talking to the Jews
[2:31:12] here when he talks about a nation he's
[2:31:15] not just talking about the nation of
[2:31:17] Israel here no read Romans 11 he's
[2:31:21] talking about a grafted in people who
[2:31:24] have now become a chosen generation a
[2:31:26] royal priesthood a holy nation a nation
[2:31:29] of
[2:31:30] priests A peculiar
[2:31:33] people and he says clearly which in time
[2:31:37] past were not a people he's not talking
[2:31:39] about Jews
[2:31:40] there but are now the people of God
[2:31:44] which had not obtained Mercy Mercy but
[2:31:48] now have obtained
[2:31:51] Mercy
[2:31:53] Hallelujah I don't want to go into the
[2:31:55] next section so I'll have the musicians
[2:31:58] to come back and we'll we'll go there on

[2:32:30] character of the bridegroom we enter
[2:32:32] into close contact fellowship and
[2:32:34] intimacy with him and how do we enter
[2:32:36] into close contact and fellowship and
[2:32:39] intimacy with him we do it by building
[2:32:41] him a throne to sit on in our midst and
[2:32:44] the throne that he wants to sit on in

[2:33:02] on our worship on our praise on our
[2:33:05] response when he speaks to us he doesn't
[2:33:08] he doesn't want us to miss his voice he
