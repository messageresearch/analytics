[46:30] oh how good he is to us
[46:34] what blessings that he has poured out in
[46:36] our lives and we're so so grateful for
[46:40] his mercy to us
[46:42] we're so glad that you're here in the
[46:44] service with us today we bless you in
[46:47] the name of the lord
[46:49] and we're just very thankful
[46:52] that the lord is moving among us and
[46:56] we have found out you've noticed some of
[46:58] these that move toward the front and we
[47:00] found out through the years that
[47:02] sometimes you have to move out of your
[47:04] comfort zone
[47:06] and um it's it's it's kind of like when
[47:09] brother branham did a prophetic action
[47:12] when he threw the rock in the air
[47:15] and prophesied that alaska that
[47:17] something was going to happen on the
[47:19] west coast and he said alaska liked to
[47:21] have sunk so sometimes you just have to
[47:24] make a movement and the lord told us in
[47:27] his word if you'll draw nigh to me
[47:30] i'll draw nigh to you
[47:32] so sometimes we just move out of our
[47:34] comfort zone a little bit and let the
[47:35] lord do what he wants to do and and so
[47:40] if that offends you
[47:44] i'm sorry
[47:46] i don't think anybody's offended
[47:49] but you know sometimes
[47:51] sometimes we just have to push in a
[47:53] little harder
[47:54] and i'm grateful to the lord for loving
[47:57] me so much
[47:58] that he just let his grace come down
[48:01] over my life when i didn't deserve it
[48:05] when i was being stupid god let his
[48:07] grace come down over my life and oh what
[48:10] a blessing it is to have his grace in my
[48:13] life and i'm so happy to have
[48:15] so much of my family here this weekend

[1:03:01] so much for entering in
[1:03:03] and there was a wonderful atmosphere and
[1:03:05] one of these days i believe brother
[1:03:07] greeley is just right
[1:03:10] that atmosphere will never leave us
[1:03:11] we'll just step right off into that how
[1:03:13] many of you are looking forward to that
[1:03:17] don't let it get too cold
[1:03:19] for the visitors i
[1:03:21] i heard the air kick on
[1:03:23] and uh
[1:03:24] it's all right with me
[1:03:27] but i don't want anybody to freeze
[1:03:29] or to blame us for the sniffles next
[1:03:31] week either
[1:03:33] we are sure glad to have you here
[1:03:35] we had the
[1:03:36] great honor and privilege
[1:03:39] of wedging ourselves in we were invited
[1:03:42] but
[1:03:43] you still have that feeling
[1:03:45] but it didn't last long
[1:03:47] because if you know anything about this
[1:03:49] family
[1:03:50] you realize that they know how to make
[1:03:52] you feel like a part
[1:03:54] and they certainly did i was feeling
[1:03:57] sorry for myself
[1:03:59] i don't have but one uncle alive
[1:04:02] uh
[1:04:03] no aunts
[1:04:04] i have three first cousins
[1:04:07] and there was a lady here a few sundays
[1:04:09] ago
[1:04:10] who said that i have a third cousin
[1:04:12] still alive
[1:04:13] that i didn't know he even existed
[1:04:15] anymore i thought he'd been gone for 20
[1:04:18] years or more and that's just about all
[1:04:20] the family extended family i have i was
[1:04:22] an only child
[1:04:24] my mother's siblings are gone and so
[1:04:26] uh it's just us
[1:04:28] and we're looking forward to extending
[1:04:30] and spreading and multiplying one day
[1:04:33] many years down the road
[1:04:35] but not too many years down the road
[1:04:38] because i want to be able to enjoy the
[1:04:40] grandchildren
[1:04:42] for at least an hour before we send them
[1:04:44] home right
[1:04:46] oh there's papa
[1:04:50] he's just had a big weekend with his
[1:04:53] but it was wonderful to be included and
[1:04:56] the the food all these folks are cooks
[1:04:59] but the fellowship and the sweetness of
[1:05:02] being with them and spending a day with
[1:05:03] them wasn't was something that we will
[1:05:05] never forget thank you all so much for
[1:05:07] letting us be a part of that
[1:05:09] and then they had a wonderful time
[1:05:11] yesterday brother
[1:05:13] wes greeley was in the back saying how
[1:05:15] wonderful it was it just touched my
[1:05:17] heart
[1:05:18] how wonderful it was to have all his
[1:05:20] family around him yesterday and
[1:05:23] it's a blessing and it's a real heritage
[1:05:26] from the lord isn't it
[1:05:28] today
[1:05:29] 24 years ago
[1:05:31] at the church in columbus
[1:05:33] my wife and i were married today is our
[1:05:35] 24th it don't seem it seems like a lot
[1:05:38] to us but it seems real small when
[1:05:41] you're talking about 63 years
[1:05:44] but i'm so thankful for the 24 years
[1:05:46] that god has given me with my wife
[1:05:48] and i am very thankful for her
[1:05:51] it's him
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:55] i haven't kept her
[1:05:58] the lord has kept her
[1:06:00] he's kept her here for me
[1:06:02] when we first got married i told some of
[1:06:04] them the other day leaving on friday i
[1:06:06] told them that it used to be i didn't
[1:06:08] want to be out of her sight
[1:06:10] i didn't want her to leave the house
[1:06:12] without me because i was afraid she
[1:06:13] wouldn't come back
[1:06:16] that's how insecure i was
[1:06:18] but i'm so thankful that at least for
[1:06:20] these last 24 years she's always come
[1:06:22] back
[1:06:23] and i'm hoping and believing that she
[1:06:25] will until the end so i want her to know
[1:06:28] how much i love her today
[1:06:29] you've been up and down a lot but i'm
[1:06:31] going to ask you to stand again for the
[1:06:33] reading of the word
[1:06:34] and i'm going to ask you to sing this
[1:06:36] little chorus with me not that we need
[1:06:38] another song
[1:06:39] but i just want us to pull our minds
[1:06:41] back together here so that god can speak
[1:06:44] to us i will be mindful to the best of
[1:06:47] my ability of the fact that
[1:06:50] we only have two services a week and
[1:06:52] they tend to be longer services
[1:06:54] and i'll do what i can as a human
[1:06:57] to
[1:06:58] move as fast as i can
[1:07:00] but i don't want to miss an opportunity
[1:07:02] today
[1:07:03] we don't know when we'll have this
[1:07:05] opportunity again
[1:07:06] if sister greene was here she just
[1:07:08] turned 87 and like i liked the quarter
[1:07:11] she said we may never be gathered like
[1:07:14] this again
[1:07:15] if we get together and she was on the
[1:07:17] phone with my wife yesterday and she's
[1:07:19] looking forward to harmony in the desert
[1:07:22] in january at 87.
[1:07:24] she's got her songs practiced and she's
[1:07:26] ready to sing and every time when we
[1:07:29] were out there she would say somebody
[1:07:31] will be missing next year it'll never be
[1:07:33] just like it is somebody won't be able
[1:07:35] to come or somebody will be in heaven so

[1:07:39] moment

[1:12:55] second corinthians chapter 10
[1:12:58] verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare
[1:13:02] are not carnal but mighty
[1:13:06] through god
[1:13:07] to the pulling down
[1:13:10] of what
[1:13:12] strongholds
[1:13:14] casting down
[1:13:16] imaginations and every high thing
[1:13:20] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:13:24] of god
[1:13:25] and bringing into captivity
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:29] every thought
[1:13:32] how many thoughts
[1:13:34] every thought
[1:13:36] to the obedience of christ
[1:13:39] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[1:13:42] disobedience
[1:13:44] when you're
[1:13:45] obedience
[1:13:47] is fulfilled
[1:13:49] i know that we're king james version
[1:13:51] people i am and i'm not ashamed of that
[1:13:54] but if you'd permit me i want to read
[1:13:56] these verses one more time in the
[1:13:58] amplified and i want you to know that
[1:14:01] i've checked them very very carefully
[1:14:04] to the best of my ability i'm not a
[1:14:06] scholar
[1:14:07] but they read very accurate and
[1:14:11] amplified
[1:14:13] so keep in mind what we're looking at as
[1:14:16] we read
[1:14:18] verse
[1:14:19] 3 for though we walk or live in the
[1:14:21] flesh
[1:14:23] we are not carrying on our warfare
[1:14:25] according to the flesh and using mere
[1:14:29] human weapons
[1:14:31] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:14:33] physical
[1:14:35] weapons of flesh and blood but they are
[1:14:38] mighty before god
[1:14:41] for the overthrow
[1:14:43] and destruction of strongholds
[1:14:46] now that ought to excite somebody
[1:14:48] because you know what it means to need
[1:14:50] something overthrown in your life
[1:14:53] pulled down and destroyed in your life
[1:14:57] inasmuch as we refute
[1:15:00] arguments
[1:15:02] and theories
[1:15:04] and reasonings
[1:15:06] and every proud and lofty thing
[1:15:10] that sets itself up against the true
[1:15:13] knowledge of god
[1:15:16] and we lead every thought and purpose
[1:15:19] away captive
[1:15:21] into the obedience
[1:15:24] of christ
[1:15:26] the messiah
[1:15:27] the anointed one i love the way the
[1:15:30] amplified brings that to us this morning
[1:15:33] bow your head with me father
[1:15:36] we thank you for your word it's life to
[1:15:38] us it's health to us it's strength to us
[1:15:42] it brings correction when we need
[1:15:44] correction
[1:15:46] it gives us strength and the wisdom of
[1:15:49] the lord to be able to deal with things
[1:15:51] in our life
[1:15:52] that will often exalt themselves against
[1:15:56] the truth
[1:15:58] and lord we need help in this great
[1:16:00] battle the greatest battle ever fought
[1:16:03] is being fought now
[1:16:05] and we are actively engaged in spiritual
[1:16:09] warfare
[1:16:10] and the battlefield is not in a lonely
[1:16:14] plot
[1:16:15] on the other side of the atlantic ocean
[1:16:17] but the battlefield resides within our
[1:16:20] brain within our mind
[1:16:23] the greatest battle ever fought is being
[1:16:25] fought right now it's not being fought
[1:16:27] in the church
[1:16:29] it's being fought in the minds of the
[1:16:31] bride of jesus christ every day lord we
[1:16:34] are attacked by thoughts
[1:16:38] that desire to take us out of your
[1:16:41] purpose and plan
[1:16:42] and so lord we ask for you to help us to
[1:16:45] remain vigilant
[1:16:47] steadfast
[1:16:48] in our desire to watch every thought
[1:16:52] to deal with every thought
[1:16:54] that we might see the glory of the lord
[1:16:57] pulling down every stronghold destroying
[1:17:01] every paradigm and every death structure
[1:17:04] that sets itself up in our minds to pull
[1:17:07] us out of the truth of god's word we
[1:17:10] need your help today lord because we are
[1:17:12] overcomers in this house
[1:17:15] we have the victory because you are the
[1:17:17] victor and we have the good news that
[1:17:20] the bride is going to win this battle of
[1:17:22] the mind because we are exchanging our
[1:17:26] thoughts
[1:17:27] we are exchanging our mind
[1:17:30] for the mind of christ
[1:17:32] and we can only do that by the help of
[1:17:35] the holy spirit
[1:17:37] so we ask that he would come right now
[1:17:39] and give us grace to approach this word
[1:17:42] and may it accomplish something in our
[1:17:44] life for the glory of god in the name of
[1:17:47] the lord jesus christ we pray and the
[1:17:49] church said amen
[1:17:51] you may be seated
[1:17:54] we started at camp meeting time
[1:17:58] how to overcome
[1:18:00] anything
[1:18:02] then we looked at this war that's raging
[1:18:05] a great warfare is going on
[1:18:09] there's one in the natural and there's
[1:18:11] one in the spiritual
[1:18:13] and whatever happens in the spiritual
[1:18:15] sets the order for what happens in the
[1:18:17] natural
[1:18:18] we like to talk about the natural typing
[1:18:21] the spiritual and this is true
[1:18:24] but in the bride of christ there's a
[1:18:26] reverse order as well and what is
[1:18:28] accomplished in the spirit can affect
[1:18:31] what goes on
[1:18:33] in the natural if you believe that say
[1:18:34] amen
[1:18:36] now brother greeley was brother wes
[1:18:37] greeley was talking i can't really say
[1:18:39] it that way i know it's your name but
[1:18:41] it's just
[1:18:42] you know
[1:18:43] i should say pastor greeley
[1:18:46] uh
[1:18:47] he was talking about these prophetic
[1:18:49] acts he was talking about the prophet
[1:18:52] throwing a rock up in the air and and if
[1:18:55] you'll study the message carefully and i
[1:18:57] know you have you will discover that
[1:18:59] brother branham talks about a vibration
[1:19:02] that is set up in obedience
[1:19:05] you see it wasn't just some thought that
[1:19:07] came to his head randomly but it was an
[1:19:09] inspired thought that came from the lord
[1:19:12] and his obedience brought about a
[1:19:15] vibration that not only shifted things
[1:19:19] in the heavens above but it also shifted
[1:19:22] things in the plates of the earth
[1:19:26] and it caused an earthquake that was
[1:19:29] already on god's mind to become a
[1:19:32] reality
[1:19:33] and his obedience are you trying to tell
[1:19:35] me brother shelly that you believe it
[1:19:37] brother branham would not have been
[1:19:39] obedient to the lord that earthquake
[1:19:41] would have not happened that's exactly
[1:19:43] what i'm telling you i believe
[1:19:45] god has placed himself in the hands of a
[1:19:48] man he did it in moses he did it a
[1:19:52] generation ago and whether you have eyes
[1:19:55] and ears to see and hear it or not he's
[1:19:57] placing his hands in men and women today
[1:20:00] a bride who will have the authority of
[1:20:03] christ
[1:20:04] in the last days to hear his voice
[1:20:08] brother branham said she will have thus
[1:20:10] saith the lord or she will keep still
[1:20:14] and we have been still
[1:20:16] long enough so we must discover what it
[1:20:20] takes to come to the place where we
[1:20:23] awaken to the reality that everything we
[1:20:26] need to make the rapture is in us
[1:20:29] it has been placed there by the word of
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:34] the seed of the word is accomplishing
[1:20:37] things inside of us that sometimes our
[1:20:40] minds struggle to talk us out of
[1:20:44] and that's why every time you give god
[1:20:46] praise for whatever he does in your life
[1:20:51] every time you recognize and identify
[1:20:55] that god is doing something for you even
[1:20:57] if it's not a complete miracle it's just
[1:21:00] the beginning of a miracle and you stop
[1:21:03] and say lord i want to thank you for the
[1:21:05] progress
[1:21:07] you know we used to make fun some seem
[1:21:09] like of the charismatic people because
[1:21:12] they were overly sensitive we we like to
[1:21:15] think
[1:21:16] and when they would be prayed for in
[1:21:19] pentecostals too when they would be
[1:21:21] prayed for sometimes the preachers would
[1:21:23] ask them do you feel better
[1:21:29] they did that in the healing revival sue
[1:21:31] you know
[1:21:32] do you feel better
[1:21:34] and some would say yes i feel better
[1:21:37] and they'd say well is the pain still
[1:21:39] there and they might say something like
[1:21:41] well i feel a little different it's not
[1:21:43] as severe as it was
[1:21:46] and a critic sitting somewhere in the
[1:21:49] church would say wow that's nothing
[1:21:51] let me tell you something what i have
[1:21:54] found is this if i will give god praise
[1:21:58] i'll show you where the prophet said in
[1:21:59] a moment if i will give god the praise
[1:22:02] that he deserves and give him honor that
[1:22:04] is due his name even when i just feel a
[1:22:07] little tingle different in my finger
[1:22:09] than i felt before
[1:22:10] it's not nearly as severe as it was and
[1:22:13] i want to give you praise lord i want to
[1:22:15] thank you that you're faithful and that
[1:22:17] you're watching out for me do you know
[1:22:19] what i've seen god do i've seen that
[1:22:21] cause a snowball effect and as that
[1:22:24] snowball would get bigger and bigger the
[1:22:27] victory would become more and more of a
[1:22:29] reality the miracle would unfold
[1:22:32] and would develop its i could tell
[1:22:35] miracles and you could tell miracles and
[1:22:37] you could share what you've seen god do
[1:22:39] but i guess my point this morning is
[1:22:42] watch for god
[1:22:45] you're his bride but you've got to watch
[1:22:47] for him
[1:22:48] because there is a group of people on
[1:22:50] the face of the earth who stand over a
[1:22:52] blade of grass and say i don't believe
[1:22:54] in god
[1:22:55] brother branham said they just look
[1:22:57] around them and see god in his creation
[1:23:00] if they would just see what god has
[1:23:02] created and recognize that his
[1:23:04] fingerprint is on every blade of grass
[1:23:08] when you stand and look at lofty
[1:23:10] mountain grandeur that we sung about a
[1:23:13] believer sees that and we don't just say
[1:23:16] oh that's beautiful
[1:23:17] we say that is the handiwork
[1:23:20] of my god
[1:23:22] he loved me so much he put that there
[1:23:26] for our enjoyment and if you think
[1:23:28] you've seen something over here just
[1:23:30] wait
[1:23:31] if you think god showed out in the rocky
[1:23:34] mountains and he showed out here and
[1:23:36] showed out there just wait until you
[1:23:38] step into eternity there's so much more
[1:23:41] waiting on us
[1:23:42] than we have ever touched over here
[1:23:45] if you believe that same man you'll have
[1:23:47] to forgive me
[1:23:51] i'm double dry this morning
[1:23:54] now
[1:23:55] we started talking about spiritual
[1:23:58] warfare
[1:24:00] this is not finding a demon under every
[1:24:02] rock
[1:24:04] this is trying to recognize that there
[1:24:06] is a legitimate warfare going on
[1:24:09] and satan is talking
[1:24:12] oh he's talking
[1:24:14] he's talking nonstop and he has a host
[1:24:17] of imps
[1:24:18] that are talking nonstop
[1:24:20] and they're shooting their eras
[1:24:23] i believe brother branham said darts
[1:24:25] they're shooting their arrows
[1:24:27] they're shooting their darts and their
[1:24:29] their desire is to hit the target
[1:24:32] and the target is to so affect your mind
[1:24:36] with reasonings and doubts
[1:24:39] if they can only cause you and i to
[1:24:42] doubt the goodness of our god
[1:24:44] if they can only send
[1:24:47] some article our way that would cause us
[1:24:50] to doubt the absolute truth that god has
[1:24:54] delivered to us in this message
[1:24:56] if they will be able the enemy will
[1:24:58] twist some detail or make something a
[1:25:01] little larger than it should be and it
[1:25:03] gets down in your mind and you begin to
[1:25:06] be overwhelmed with doubts i want you to
[1:25:09] know the demons dance with glee
[1:25:12] as long as you're in a tail spin they
[1:25:15] rejoice because they recognize if they
[1:25:18] can keep you and i in confusion
[1:25:21] you see our bodies have been delivered
[1:25:23] from babylon we have come out of
[1:25:25] denominational confusion
[1:25:27] come on but some of us are still in a
[1:25:30] great battle because there's a lot of
[1:25:32] babylon that's operating in our mind
[1:25:35] we know god's word but we hear all the
[1:25:38] other voices that try to talk us out of
[1:25:41] the reality of what god wants to do in
[1:25:43] us we have faith for somebody else
[1:25:47] we believe that god will move for
[1:25:49] somebody else but we're not sure if god
[1:25:52] really wants to move for us or in us i
[1:25:54] want to tell you i've got good news for
[1:25:56] you i woke up this morning knowing that
[1:25:59] god wants you and i walking in the
[1:26:00] victory
[1:26:02] he wants you and i walking in the
[1:26:03] victory that he has made available to us
[1:26:07] this message was not sent from god to
[1:26:09] make us a bunch of mummies
[1:26:14] you thought i said dummies didn't you
[1:26:16] i said mummies
[1:26:18] and sometimes mummies can act like
[1:26:20] dummies the enemy wants to tie us up and
[1:26:24] tangle us up and twist us up in
[1:26:27] confusion and if he doesn't do that he
[1:26:30] will do it with church entity
[1:26:34] i was thinking his brother greeley was
[1:26:36] talking about brother branham throwing
[1:26:38] the rock i thought well a lot of us came
[1:26:40] from pentecost and we sung a song back
[1:26:43] then that says you got to move
[1:26:46] you got to move you got to move you got
[1:26:48] to move when the lord gets ready
[1:26:52] you better move
[1:26:54] come on
[1:26:55] and you say well is that is that good
[1:26:57] for us today it absolutely is good
[1:27:00] if god tells you to worship him in some
[1:27:02] way that you're not used to doing you
[1:27:04] better obey god
[1:27:06] you better step out of the boat you
[1:27:07] better be willing to get out of your
[1:27:09] comfort zone because if god is talking
[1:27:12] to you by his spirit it's always because
[1:27:14] he's setting you up for something great
[1:27:17] he's setting you up for the answer to
[1:27:19] your prayer he's setting you up for the
[1:27:22] fruition of the miracle that you've been
[1:27:24] waiting on come on now
[1:27:27] and so we we've been talking about the
[1:27:29] spiritual warfare and how it's outlined
[1:27:31] for us in the bible and there's four
[1:27:33] steps to it i'm not going to preach that
[1:27:35] again just going to name them because
[1:27:37] we've just read them to you in the
[1:27:38] scripture number one to pull down every
[1:27:41] stronghold
[1:27:43] god does not want you and i bound
[1:27:48] to strongholds
[1:27:50] he doesn't want death structures
[1:27:53] i'll define that later
[1:27:55] hanging around in our mind
[1:27:58] he wants us to receive only
[1:28:01] the pure
[1:28:02] word of god and everything else
[1:28:07] watch this
[1:28:08] everything else is a lie
[1:28:13] it's a lie we are surrounded by lies and
[1:28:17] we have perceived them to be reality but
[1:28:20] there's only one reality over here in
[1:28:22] satan's eden and that is the pure
[1:28:25] word of almighty god
[1:28:28] and that is found when we take the mind
[1:28:31] of christ and to take the mind of christ
[1:28:35] we have to actively reject our own mind
[1:28:39] how do we do that by taking every
[1:28:41] thought captive
[1:28:44] is that according to the word no
[1:28:48] is this this according no
[1:28:52] the enemy will tell you all kinds of
[1:28:53] things
[1:28:55] number one to pull down strongholds
[1:28:57] number two to cast down imaginations
[1:29:00] number three to cast down every high
[1:29:03] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:29:05] knowledge of christ number four to bring
[1:29:07] every thought into captivity and forcing
[1:29:10] it
[1:29:11] to obey christ
[1:29:12] did you know you've got power over your
[1:29:14] own thoughts
[1:29:15] help me now if you folks will help me
[1:29:17] preach i'll wear myself out for you
[1:29:20] come on
[1:29:22] you've got to get a hold of that thought
[1:29:23] i have to get a hold of that thought and
[1:29:25] examine it and i can't do it long drawn
[1:29:28] out
[1:29:29] come on this is you don't have time to
[1:29:31] call a prayer meeting on every thought
[1:29:34] you got to know the word so that when
[1:29:36] you examine that thought you can
[1:29:38] immediately know if it's according to
[1:29:39] the word or not is that thus saith the
[1:29:42] lord or is that the say of doubt and if
[1:29:44] it's thus saith doubt you've got to grab
[1:29:46] ahold of that and force that thought to
[1:29:49] submit itself to jesus christ and his
[1:29:53] truth
[1:29:54] and then you have to replace that
[1:29:56] thought with the only thing that's going
[1:29:58] to give the bride victory and that's the
[1:30:00] word of god
[1:30:01] the only thing god always didn't he say
[1:30:03] god always uses what his word to defeat
[1:30:09] his enemy
[1:30:11] and how does he interpret his word for
[1:30:13] us
[1:30:14] by bringing it to pass
[1:30:17] these are little
[1:30:18] i don't know slogans cliches pieces of
[1:30:22] quotes
[1:30:22] that we hold onto we repeat them we
[1:30:26] amend them when we hear them not
[1:30:28] realizing that they have become weapons
[1:30:31] that we can use against the enemy
[1:30:34] you take that little quote and i have it
[1:30:36] here you take that little quote where
[1:30:38] brother branham said the right mental
[1:30:40] attitude
[1:30:43] i want you to know that's an atomic bomb
[1:30:46] don't you call that a bullet
[1:30:48] that's more than a bullet that's an
[1:30:50] atomic bomb
[1:30:52] the right mental attitude toward every
[1:30:54] promise of god or any promise of god
[1:30:56] will do what
[1:30:58] bring it to pass
[1:31:01] so it's a very busy life we're living
[1:31:04] now
[1:31:05] and this head gets really
[1:31:08] full
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:11] and one of the things that we find out
[1:31:13] are you will you stay with me a little
[1:31:15] while one of the things we find out is
[1:31:18] we receive these thoughts
[1:31:20] and we hold on to them
[1:31:23] and when we hold on to them they not
[1:31:25] only become a part of our conscious mind
[1:31:29] they also become a part of our
[1:31:31] subconscious mind
[1:31:34] and when we have a thought true or false
[1:31:38] that has become a part
[1:31:40] of our conscious mind and also our
[1:31:44] subconscious mind
[1:31:45] any similar thought
[1:31:48] is automatically received into the brain
[1:31:53] now just a minute i know it sounds a lot
[1:31:57] any similar thought
[1:32:00] because your subconscious brain
[1:32:02] does not have the ability to filter out
[1:32:06] error
[1:32:07] or truth
[1:32:09] it receives all information it's like a
[1:32:11] computer your subconscious is like a
[1:32:13] computer
[1:32:14] and everything you put in it
[1:32:16] it takes it to be the truth
[1:32:18] you have to make a conscious decision
[1:32:20] using your conscious brain
[1:32:22] i'm not a brain scientist but i sure
[1:32:24] have studied a lot about the brain
[1:32:26] i think it's one of the most fascinating
[1:32:28] tools that god has given us
[1:32:30] it's for us
[1:32:32] it's for us it's a gift from god for us
[1:32:36] and you people who say i don't have a
[1:32:37] good brain i want you to know that's a
[1:32:40] lie
[1:32:41] i want you to know the holy spirit in
[1:32:43] you can rework and reach change and
[1:32:46] rebuild and restructure
[1:32:49] anything that's damaged even in your
[1:32:51] physical body
[1:32:52] particularly your physical brain by the
[1:32:54] miracle of epigenetics
[1:32:56] it's a gift from god to be able to even
[1:32:59] reprogram your brain
[1:33:02] and the scripture tells us we do that by
[1:33:05] pulling down thoughts that are contrary
[1:33:08] to god's word and replacing them like
[1:33:12] jesus did it
[1:33:14] is
[1:33:15] written
[1:33:16] how many of you know to do this
[1:33:18] how many of you are always successful at
[1:33:20] doing this i'm saying oh
[1:33:22] my the number shrunk
[1:33:24] because we forget
[1:33:26] we know it but we forget it and this is
[1:33:30] the enemy's uh uh it's his success
[1:33:34] now once you accept a thought
[1:33:36] that thought is placed in your
[1:33:38] subconscious mind
[1:33:40] whatever thoughts you choose to accept
[1:33:43] in your conscious mind
[1:33:45] must be accepted also in your
[1:33:48] subconscious mind it has no ability to
[1:33:51] reject any thoughts we continuously
[1:33:54] think
[1:33:55] are planted firmly in the subconscious
[1:33:58] part of the mind i don't want you to be
[1:33:59] bored
[1:34:00] this repetition of thought becomes
[1:34:03] habits or what we refer to as paradigms
[1:34:08] now paradigms are thought structures
[1:34:11] and they are like a building they've got
[1:34:13] all kinds of bricks
[1:34:15] all kinds of pieces and they form a
[1:34:18] structure in our thinking ability
[1:34:21] and many of us here are bound today by
[1:34:25] wrong paradigms
[1:34:28] and paradigms are scripturally defined
[1:34:30] as strongholds
[1:34:31] and jesus is giving us power over every
[1:34:35] stronghold that the enemy would try to
[1:34:38] build on the battlefield of our mind are
[1:34:41] you still with me
[1:34:43] but they don't fall on their
[1:34:44] own they don't just fall automatically
[1:34:47] because you go to church often
[1:34:49] you have got to make a conscious
[1:34:51] decision i'm going to deal with what the
[1:34:54] enemy is building in my head
[1:34:57] anybody with me
[1:34:58] my old granny used to say and yours did
[1:35:00] too you can't keep a bird from flying
[1:35:03] over your head
[1:35:05] but you can keep him from building a
[1:35:07] nest in your hair
[1:35:09] well i want to tell you something you
[1:35:11] can't always control a thought from
[1:35:13] coming to your mind but you don't have
[1:35:16] to let the enemy use that as another
[1:35:18] brick
[1:35:20] to build a stronghold or a paradigm that
[1:35:24] will continuously pull you out of god's
[1:35:27] program
[1:35:28] for your life i want to tell you this i
[1:35:30] don't know if you're hearing me or not
[1:35:32] but i want to tell you this god's got a
[1:35:34] bride in the earth he's not going to
[1:35:36] have a bride he has a bride and in that
[1:35:38] bride there's going to be victory
[1:35:41] somebody in this house is going to win
[1:35:44] this mind battle over satan and i'm
[1:35:47] going to be one of them you just might
[1:35:49] as well
[1:35:50] make up your mind
[1:35:52] that you're going to be one of them i'm
[1:35:56] going to win this thing
[1:35:58] you're not going to win it by by win it
[1:36:00] by getting smarter you're going to win
[1:36:02] it by being more spiritually minded
[1:36:06] taking the mind of christ
[1:36:08] now let me read just a few more little
[1:36:09] notes and i want to go on to what the
[1:36:11] message tells us
[1:36:13] the the thoughts we choose with our
[1:36:15] conscious mind are impressed upon our
[1:36:17] subconscious mind
[1:36:19] and it moves our body
[1:36:21] into a state of vibration which creates
[1:36:24] an action
[1:36:26] and the actions that are produced create
[1:36:29] the results
[1:36:30] that you are getting in your life
[1:36:32] now folks that's that is actually brain
[1:36:34] science
[1:36:36] that's not uh mind over matter
[1:36:38] new age uh mumble jumbo
[1:36:41] that is not just norman vincent peale
[1:36:43] and dr schuller at schuler and
[1:36:46] no no no no
[1:36:47] this is actually brain science
[1:36:49] you are not forced to live with the
[1:36:51] brain you were born with
[1:36:54] interesting
[1:36:55] you have the ability and especially
[1:36:57] those who have the word of god
[1:36:59] the greatest weapon you've got the
[1:37:01] greatest doctor you've got the greatest
[1:37:03] brain surgeon that has ever existed
[1:37:05] you have the ability to rewire your
[1:37:08] thoughts
[1:37:10] so that every time a lie comes you
[1:37:12] recognize it immediately you pull it
[1:37:15] down in the name of the lord jesus
[1:37:17] christ and you build the thought that's
[1:37:20] true
[1:37:21] to replace the lie
[1:37:24] that you just pulled down
[1:37:26] now i know some of you are looking i
[1:37:27] don't know what this when i first
[1:37:28] started teaching these things
[1:37:30] people would say things like well
[1:37:32] what has that got to do with brother
[1:37:34] adam
[1:37:35] well i want you to know that in my
[1:37:36] opinion brother branham was a brain
[1:37:39] scientist
[1:37:45] he was a brain scientist because you
[1:37:48] don't have to have an education
[1:37:51] to rewire your brain
[1:37:53] he taught more about the mind and
[1:37:57] thoughts
[1:37:58] and the power of our brain and our
[1:38:01] ability
[1:38:02] to be what god says in spite of all the
[1:38:05] obstacles
[1:38:07] come on now
[1:38:08] he preached about overcoming night after
[1:38:12] night after night and the instructions
[1:38:14] were always the same
[1:38:16] he said you've got to use what jesus
[1:38:18] used it
[1:38:20] is
[1:38:21] written
[1:38:23] it defeats every enemy
[1:38:25] every devil
[1:38:26] come on now so everything you see hear
[1:38:29] smell touch and taste
[1:38:32] is either accepted
[1:38:34] or rejected
[1:38:36] by the conscious mind
[1:38:39] whatever is accepted
[1:38:41] is then turned over to the subconscious
[1:38:44] mind which is then turned into action
[1:38:47] through the physical body
[1:38:49] so every action including brushing your
[1:38:52] teeth
[1:38:53] and fluffing your pillow
[1:38:55] and all the things you do without
[1:38:57] thinking about it
[1:38:58] you just do it how many of you know our
[1:39:00] life is filled with thoughts that come
[1:39:02] from the subconscious oh my goodness you
[1:39:05] don't have to learn to drive every time
[1:39:06] you get behind the wheel do you
[1:39:08] you know they say you'll never forget
[1:39:10] how to ride a bicycle
[1:39:11] there are certain things that get
[1:39:13] programmed into us that we don't even
[1:39:15] have to think about
[1:39:17] to do them
[1:39:19] is that right anybody understand
[1:39:21] have you ever look you're going to get
[1:39:23] older
[1:39:27] i see some of you young whippersnappers
[1:39:28] you're going to get older
[1:39:32] and you're going to do thinking you can
[1:39:34] just do like you always did
[1:39:36] and just grab the first thing you find
[1:39:38] and put under your arms
[1:39:41] don't you do it
[1:39:44] everything on the counter is not
[1:39:46] mouthwash
[1:39:50] everything that's pasty is not
[1:39:52] toothpaste
[1:39:54] everything in a tube is not toothpaste
[1:39:56] and where we used to just put things in
[1:39:58] the right place and know where they were
[1:40:00] in our subconscious mind we just start
[1:40:02] getting things we don't even read the
[1:40:03] label we just grab things by what we
[1:40:05] know well as the older we get some of
[1:40:07] those connections
[1:40:09] those synapses
[1:40:11] they kind of get frazzled
[1:40:14] and you got to be mighty careful
[1:40:16] i'm not even going to suggest what you
[1:40:17] might be brushing your teeth with
[1:40:21] but it will happen
[1:40:22] but very much of our life is lived from
[1:40:25] the subconscious mind and the only way
[1:40:27] you can have something in the
[1:40:29] subconscious mind is if it's been
[1:40:30] accepted in the conscious mind
[1:40:32] because you live
[1:40:35] subconsciously
[1:40:37] carrying out actions that you have
[1:40:39] received and learned in your conscious
[1:40:42] mind you don't have to think about
[1:40:43] brushing your teeth who's got a better
[1:40:45] example anybody got a better example of
[1:40:47] things that you do all the time and
[1:40:49] every day and
[1:40:54] oh you're giving us an example of of the
[1:40:56] of the synapsis breaking
[1:40:58] i'm looking is there a better example of
[1:41:00] what we do automatic that we don't have
[1:41:02] to think about well you don't have to
[1:41:04] think about how to how to it's obvious
[1:41:06] for me
[1:41:08] not for some of you that i don't have to
[1:41:09] remember learn and retrain myself to eat
[1:41:12] but how many of you know stroke victims
[1:41:14] do
[1:41:15] because there are certain parts of the
[1:41:17] brain that have been affected and things
[1:41:18] they've done normally and automatically
[1:41:20] all their life they can no longer do now
[1:41:22] if everything has to be
[1:41:25] written
[1:41:27] on the hard drive of your conscious mind
[1:41:30] before you can use it subconsciously and
[1:41:33] that includes how to eat how to brush
[1:41:36] your teeth how to how to to drive the
[1:41:38] car or whatever the example would be did
[1:41:41] you also know that you can program your
[1:41:44] conscious mind to know how to recognize
[1:41:48] anything contrary to the truth of god's
[1:41:51] word
[1:41:52] and if you can learn that in your
[1:41:54] conscious mind you send that into your
[1:41:57] subconscious mind and i want you to
[1:41:59] understand we're talking about real
[1:42:01] brain cells here
[1:42:02] we're not talking about some mystical
[1:42:04] mist we're talking about the ability to
[1:42:07] ride in the hard drive of the mind
[1:42:10] now you add what god has created this
[1:42:12] brain to be able to do on its own you
[1:42:15] add to that what the holy ghost can
[1:42:17] accomplish in your mind
[1:42:19] and i'm telling you you are no longer an
[1:42:21] average part of adam's race
[1:42:23] you now have become a part of god's
[1:42:25] super race
[1:42:27] come on what god has given you and i the
[1:42:29] ability to do by the power of the word
[1:42:32] of god that resides in us
[1:42:34] it causes us to graduate out of adam's
[1:42:38] race into an entirely different creation
[1:42:42] all together
[1:42:44] now i know many people struggle with
[1:42:45] that but it's the truth we're not just a
[1:42:48] part of adam's race or a part of
[1:42:50] abraham's natural seed but by the word
[1:42:53] of god that's in us we are a part of
[1:42:55] abraham's royal seed
[1:42:59] and everything we need to win this
[1:43:01] battle is in us and everything we need
[1:43:03] to make the rapture is in us so we're
[1:43:06] not waiting on something new
[1:43:12] we're not waiting on another experience
[1:43:15] if you think i'm going to preach against
[1:43:16] experience i'm not
[1:43:19] because there's enough message preachers
[1:43:21] who do
[1:43:22] and i don't have to join the ranks
[1:43:25] because i personally believe that you
[1:43:28] must have a personal experience with god
[1:43:33] god has no grandchildren
[1:43:36] nicodemus you must be born again
[1:43:39] you've got to have your own taste of
[1:43:42] that original manna
[1:43:44] hallelujah you don't just have the holy
[1:43:47] ghost because you talk some talk or you
[1:43:50] wear the right belt buckle or you do
[1:43:52] something like other people do let me
[1:43:54] tell you something you've got to have a
[1:43:55] birth you've got to be filled will you
[1:43:58] tell your young people will you tell
[1:44:00] your children so they can tell their
[1:44:02] children you must have the baptism
[1:44:06] of the holy ghost for yourself
[1:44:10] my experience is not enough for my
[1:44:13] children
[1:44:14] brother branham's experience was not
[1:44:17] enough for his children
[1:44:19] you've got to encounter god for yourself
[1:44:22] it won't all look the same way
[1:44:25] i'm not talking about jerking or jumping
[1:44:27] or moving
[1:44:28] i'm not talking about some something
[1:44:30] like that a goosebump
[1:44:32] i'm talking about something so much
[1:44:35] deeper than a feeling
[1:44:38] but when you receive it you can't help
[1:44:41] but feel it
[1:44:42] because it's transforming you from the
[1:44:45] inside out and it's giving you the power
[1:44:48] i want to say it again it's giving you
[1:44:51] the power to win the greatest battle
[1:44:53] ever fought
[1:44:55] this little bride that has lingered in
[1:44:57] defeat way too long is about to awaken
[1:45:02] she's about to recognize who she is
[1:45:06] why because the time is right
[1:45:10] the time is right
[1:45:12] look at israel look at the nations of
[1:45:15] the world look at where we are in this
[1:45:18] nation you will recognize the time is
[1:45:21] right it is manifesting time
[1:45:26] it's time to deal with sickness
[1:45:29] let's see if i get any help with that
[1:45:31] it's time to take sickness by the horn
[1:45:36] and recognize that a great portion of
[1:45:38] what we suffer is demonic
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:44] should i pull out my list
[1:45:46] i think i will
[1:45:48] i'm not getting far enough i got to
[1:45:50] hurry
[1:45:51] of course if i was just going to take my
[1:45:52] normal time i got another
[1:45:54] hour and 20 minutes
[1:45:56] but i'm trying to hurry
[1:45:58] let me give you this list again because
[1:46:00] many of you didn't hear it
[1:46:02] i made a list
[1:46:03] of some of the maladies and infirmities
[1:46:06] that brother branham placed in the three
[1:46:09] realms of the demonic
[1:46:11] first of all he said there are demons
[1:46:13] that operate in the spirit realm how
[1:46:15] many of you know that and here's some of
[1:46:17] them nervousness
[1:46:19] depression
[1:46:21] arrogance
[1:46:22] sullen
[1:46:24] ungodly spirits in case you don't know
[1:46:27] what sullen means
[1:46:28] i wanted to look it up to make sure it
[1:46:30] means bad tempered
[1:46:32] sulky pouty gloomy
[1:46:36] any of you ever dealt with that
[1:46:38] it's demonic
[1:46:41] boy that don't make us feel good it's
[1:46:43] demonic
[1:46:44] and you know there's only one way to
[1:46:45] defeat the demonic
[1:46:49] that's by the word of god
[1:46:51] you don't have to be grumpy your whole
[1:46:53] life tell me lord help me to be i don't
[1:46:56] want to be that way
[1:46:57] how many of you catch yourself being
[1:46:58] grumpy
[1:47:03] how many of you past 40 and you still
[1:47:04] catch yourself pouting
[1:47:08] come on now
[1:47:09] the enemy wants to confuse our minds
[1:47:13] with all of these emotions and we think
[1:47:15] that we can just ignore them and they go
[1:47:18] away but the truth is if the demonic is
[1:47:21] driving those kinds of things
[1:47:24] then we have to take authority over the
[1:47:27] demonic
[1:47:28] and we have to use what tools and what
[1:47:31] weapons we have been given and we have
[1:47:34] to defeat those strongholds
[1:47:36] and pull down those paradigms
[1:47:41] oh
[1:47:41] just a minute preach on brother
[1:47:44] we may be tired but we need to hear this
[1:47:46] oh thank good i'm glad
[1:47:49] insanity
[1:47:52] worldly spirits
[1:47:55] spirits of darkness
[1:47:57] drinking smoking bad habits
[1:47:59] all of these things brother branham said
[1:48:01] operate from the demonic in the realm of
[1:48:04] the spirit in the spirit realm
[1:48:07] you see i see this thing
[1:48:08] so many times now when we first heard
[1:48:11] the truth when the message first came
[1:48:14] pulled us out of denominational thought
[1:48:16] and thinking we were so glad to be free
[1:48:18] from what the church was caught up in
[1:48:21] yes we were
[1:48:23] we were so glad don't don't get nervous
[1:48:25] oh my some of my own folk got nervous
[1:48:28] some of our own church vote got nervous
[1:48:29] because you thought you knew where i was
[1:48:30] going
[1:48:33] i'm going to behave myself
[1:48:35] but i am very disturbed about the fact
[1:48:37] that the longer we've been out of
[1:48:39] babylon
[1:48:42] the more likely it is it seems these
[1:48:44] days that we go back and start picking
[1:48:47] up the things
[1:48:48] that we once knew god had delivered us
[1:48:51] from
[1:48:56] isn't this a wonderful time of year
[1:48:58] to preach about that
[1:49:03] because we used to testify bless god
[1:49:05] he's delivered me from all that fluff
[1:49:09] he's delivered me from all that stuff
[1:49:11] that distracts from who christ really is
[1:49:14] and now all these years later
[1:49:17] you see if the rapture would have took
[1:49:18] place in the 90s some of us would have
[1:49:21] had more victory then than we have now
[1:49:24] come on now
[1:49:25] if the rapture would have took place 10
[1:49:27] years ago some of us would have been
[1:49:29] walking in more victory the problem is
[1:49:31] there cannot be a rapture without you
[1:49:35] if you're a part of god's predestinated
[1:49:37] plan and a seed of god there can't be a
[1:49:41] rapture until you're ready to make it
[1:49:46] so let's get ready
[1:49:48] in that good advice let's let you and i
[1:49:52] do everything we can to get us far away
[1:49:54] from babylon external and internal that
[1:49:58] we possibly can so that god can use us
[1:50:02] because this little bride's going to be
[1:50:03] used on her way out of here
[1:50:05] she's going to shift some things on her
[1:50:07] way out of here oh yes she's going to
[1:50:10] recognize authority that she has by the
[1:50:13] power of the spoken word
[1:50:16] i still hear people talking 40 years
[1:50:18] later we're waiting on the spoken word
[1:50:25] why are we waiting on something that was
[1:50:27] already restored
[1:50:29] when god gave that prophet those five
[1:50:32] examples of the spoken word he was
[1:50:34] showing us that everything we need to
[1:50:37] operate in that is in us
[1:50:40] we're waiting on the timing of the lord
[1:50:43] we're waiting on the hour of the lord
[1:50:45] but we're also waiting to recognize who
[1:50:47] we really are
[1:50:48] because remember he said when that
[1:50:49] little bride when she really begins to
[1:50:51] know who she is
[1:50:54] she's going to win this battle
[1:50:56] this battle that wears you out now how
[1:50:58] many of you get wow i felt good how many
[1:51:01] of you get wore out with this battle
[1:51:04] tired of thinking these negative
[1:51:05] thoughts tired of warring against lies
[1:51:09] but we're not tired enough
[1:51:11] because if we get tired enough we'll do
[1:51:14] something about it
[1:51:16] and we have what we need you don't need
[1:51:18] another revival you don't need another
[1:51:20] prophet you don't need another this or
[1:51:22] another that we just need to recognize
[1:51:25] what god has already placed within us
[1:51:28] and start using and exercising and
[1:51:30] utilizing are you with me
[1:51:33] been in the physical realm brother
[1:51:35] branham named these of course there are
[1:51:36] many more these are the demonic that
[1:51:39] manifests itself in the physical realm
[1:51:41] tumor cancer pneumonia
[1:51:44] arthritis cataracts
[1:51:46] rheumatism tuberculosis epilepsy
[1:51:49] asthmatic conditions germ diseases ulcer
[1:51:53] deafness blindness
[1:51:55] etc
[1:51:57] i asked the church here
[1:51:59] last sunday how many of you noticed that
[1:52:01] several of these maladies
[1:52:03] involve the lungs
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:06] what an hour we're living in now
[1:52:08] where the whole world is
[1:52:10] either fighting to get rid of it
[1:52:12] coming through it or
[1:52:14] hibernating to stay away from it
[1:52:17] lung problems
[1:52:18] and brother branham talks about the
[1:52:20] asthmatic he talks about the germ
[1:52:22] diseases he talks about the tuberculosis
[1:52:24] he talks about these things that deal
[1:52:26] with the lungs and he talks about it
[1:52:27] being the demonic manifesting in the
[1:52:30] physical realm
[1:52:34] i don't know are you are you upset with
[1:52:35] me
[1:52:37] if that's the truth if it's really
[1:52:38] demonic you and i have power over that
[1:52:42] just being honest
[1:52:43] jesus said somebody said what brother
[1:52:44] branham say more
[1:52:46] but let's just go right back to the main
[1:52:47] man jesus he said behold i give you
[1:52:50] power
[1:52:51] over all the powers of the enemy
[1:52:54] you'll be able to tread on serpents and
[1:52:56] scorpions and not be harmed and if you
[1:52:58] drink any deadly poison it'll not harm
[1:53:00] you
[1:53:00] now that's a promise that comes with
[1:53:02] obedience to the word and being filled
[1:53:05] with the power of the holy ghost
[1:53:07] and so we understand that this is just
[1:53:10] the beginning folks you need to know
[1:53:12] this is just the beginning of germ
[1:53:14] diseases
[1:53:15] and viral diseases
[1:53:17] we're just at the beginning and you
[1:53:19] don't even have to be prophetic to know
[1:53:21] that we've already got a new strain on
[1:53:23] the scene
[1:53:24] and a dozen more just waiting on the
[1:53:26] wings
[1:53:27] and you and i are going to need to
[1:53:29] exercise authority over those things in
[1:53:31] our own body and on our own family and
[1:53:33] in our own lives
[1:53:34] and you're you're looking at somebody
[1:53:36] and you look around this church and many
[1:53:38] of us have had the coronavirus but we
[1:53:40] are here to testify
[1:53:43] that it can do one thing to us that god
[1:53:45] didn't allow it to do
[1:53:46] and by his grace we came through with
[1:53:48] the victory
[1:53:50] and i want you to know some people
[1:53:51] didn't lose their praise
[1:53:55] some people came out of that battle with
[1:53:57] more praise than they went into it with
[1:54:00] because they saw the goodness of god
[1:54:04] got to hurry
[1:54:05] and then he said there's demons that
[1:54:07] manifest himself in the religious realm
[1:54:09] unclean spirits
[1:54:11] spirits of doubt
[1:54:13] superstition
[1:54:20] i was an evangelist i would preach on
[1:54:22] superstition
[1:54:26] because there's a lot of that
[1:54:28] there's a lot of that
[1:54:29] unbelief and sin all of these things are
[1:54:31] demonic
[1:54:33] manifesting themselves in the religious
[1:54:35] realm so if they're in the demonic if
[1:54:37] the demonic has something to do with it
[1:54:38] if the demonic is a driving force then
[1:54:40] if jesus has given us power over all the
[1:54:42] powers of the enemy that means we have
[1:54:44] authority over those diseases
[1:54:47] that means we have authority over those
[1:54:48] mind it means we have authority over
[1:54:50] being grumpy sullen pouty arrogant
[1:54:56] we don't have to excuse ourselves
[1:54:58] anymore and just say that's who i am and
[1:55:00] i'm not going to change
[1:55:01] there's power to change
[1:55:03] there's power to be new men and women
[1:55:05] oh there's power to live a victorious
[1:55:08] life in the word
[1:55:10] it's in us
[1:55:11] are you with me
[1:55:13] greatest battle ever fought sweet zoe
[1:55:16] paragraph 91
[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:19] i'm hurrying
[1:55:23] that's in the new ones
[1:55:27] it'll give me a chance to get water can
[1:55:29] i have another one it's going to be a
[1:55:31] two a two bottle service
[1:55:36] it must be accepted in the mind
[1:55:39] now here goes the brain surgeon
[1:55:44] not even an elementary education
[1:55:48] and he's teaching us
[1:55:50] epigenetics
[1:55:52] he's teaching us how things work in the
[1:55:54] brain
[1:55:55] and how the mind is a part of all that
[1:55:57] function that the brain has
[1:55:59] and i'm reading again it must be
[1:56:00] accepted in the mind
[1:56:02] then it is believed with the heart put
[1:56:03] your finger there
[1:56:04] you can't believe anything in your heart
[1:56:06] that you haven't accepted in your
[1:56:07] conscious mind
[1:56:09] you can't act on anything that you
[1:56:11] haven't accepted in your conscious mind
[1:56:13] and allowed it to transfer to your
[1:56:15] subconscious mind but once what you
[1:56:17] believe is so inbred and so deeply
[1:56:20] driven down into who you are it will
[1:56:23] automatically flow into your
[1:56:25] subconscious and you will begin to know
[1:56:27] immediately when you hear something
[1:56:31] whether or not that is the truth
[1:56:34] how many of you know we need that
[1:56:38] we need that
[1:56:39] you don't always have access to the
[1:56:41] computer
[1:56:42] you can't always search the messages of
[1:56:44] brother branham how many of you know we
[1:56:46] need the mind of christ
[1:56:47] so that when we hear something on the
[1:56:49] news or when we hear something by the
[1:56:51] scientist or when we hear something in
[1:56:53] the world that we automatically can
[1:56:54] discern and know whether or not that is
[1:56:56] of the truth
[1:56:58] or whether that is of babylon
[1:57:00] we can recognize that and the only way
[1:57:02] to do that is to understand in order for
[1:57:05] it to be a part of our mind which is a
[1:57:08] functioning part of the brain it must be
[1:57:10] accepted in the mind then it is believed
[1:57:12] it has to then be believed with the
[1:57:14] heart
[1:57:14] then the word of god becomes a reality
[1:57:18] are you still here
[1:57:19] then every sense of
[1:57:22] every senses of soul and body is just
[1:57:25] scoured out with the holy spirit
[1:57:28] then your sense of god
[1:57:31] your conscience of god everything that's
[1:57:34] godly flows through you
[1:57:37] there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:57:40] did you know you can't believe something
[1:57:41] in your heart until you've accepted it
[1:57:43] in your mind
[1:57:45] oh i want to say that again
[1:57:47] you can't believe something in your
[1:57:49] heart unless you've accepted it in your
[1:57:51] mind so you've got to make up your mind
[1:57:54] to accept god's word as your absolute
[1:57:58] truth then your heart's emotion can
[1:58:01] latch on to that and it becomes a part
[1:58:04] of your dna it becomes a part of who you
[1:58:07] are not only spiritually and emotionally
[1:58:10] but also physically if you think you
[1:58:12] understand that say amen
[1:58:14] all righty goes on there's not a doubt
[1:58:16] anywhere there's none can rise up
[1:58:19] there's nothing can come up in the
[1:58:21] memory
[1:58:23] and say well i remember miss jones tried
[1:58:26] to trust god
[1:58:28] and miss so and so miss doe tried to
[1:58:31] trust god for healing one time and she
[1:58:34] failed
[1:58:35] has the devil ever talked to you that
[1:58:36] way
[1:58:37] has the devil ever told you don't you
[1:58:39] remember so and so they threw themselves
[1:58:41] on the mercies of god and they died
[1:58:45] let me tell you something that is no
[1:58:46] sign that if you throw yourself on the
[1:58:48] mercy of god you're going to die too
[1:58:51] when you understand the sovereignty of
[1:58:52] god you will recognize that you're not
[1:58:55] leaving this world one half second
[1:58:57] earlier than what god has intended for
[1:58:59] you to leave and if you believe the
[1:59:01] devil can kill you then you have created
[1:59:04] an enemy that is more powerful than the
[1:59:06] god that created him
[1:59:12] the devil can't kill you
[1:59:16] he would have to have permission
[1:59:19] to take your life
[1:59:20] and he cannot take your life and one
[1:59:23] half second earlier than what god has
[1:59:26] intended and if god is calling you out
[1:59:28] of here the best doctor in the best
[1:59:31] hospital with the best medicine on
[1:59:33] planet earth cannot save your life
[1:59:36] so we better quit putting ourselves in
[1:59:38] the hands of men and women like that
[1:59:40] thinking that they're our salvation
[1:59:43] i don't mean not to go to the doctor i
[1:59:45] mean when you go understand he's a
[1:59:47] flawed man
[1:59:49] and he's only practicing the best he
[1:59:51] knows so don't put all your hope in the
[1:59:54] doctor
[1:59:55] and if you lose a loved one in the
[1:59:57] hospital don't you let the devil put you
[2:00:00] in this vicious cycle of a mind battle
[2:00:02] if they'd have been in a better hospital
[2:00:04] if they'd had a better doctor if they'd
[2:00:06] have been given another kind of medicine
[2:00:08] then they would still be here you must
[2:00:11] either believe or reject the sovereignty
[2:00:13] of god
[2:00:15] anybody with me
[2:00:18] to say that the enemy can come in and
[2:00:20] snatch me out of god's plan and kill my
[2:00:23] body is to say he's more powerful than
[2:00:25] the one who created him
[2:00:27] oh no i know that i know who the prince
[2:00:29] of the power of the area is i know who
[2:00:30] the god of this evil age is but i also
[2:00:32] know god doesn't ever come down off his
[2:00:34] throne
[2:00:36] i want you to know he's got the limits
[2:00:37] on that old devil
[2:00:39] he doesn't have free reign if you think
[2:00:40] the devil has total free reign you
[2:00:42] forgot who sits above him
[2:00:45] he dwells in the second heaven doing
[2:00:47] everything he can to bring destruction
[2:00:49] on planet earth but you forgot above him
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:00:53] it's a god still on his throne
[2:00:56] watching over that little imp
[2:00:57] [Applause]
[2:01:00] i got my eye on you devil
[2:01:03] you can touch them this way and that way
[2:01:05] but you cannot kill them
[2:01:08] i won't let you
[2:01:11] all right
[2:01:12] boy that's good to know
[2:01:14] whoa that's good to know
[2:01:16] that's why i could go to greeley
[2:01:18] thanksgiving yester friday and not be
[2:01:20] afraid of catching something and dying
[2:01:25] glory that's why i can go to walmart i
[2:01:28] don't advise it
[2:01:29] but that's why i can go to walmart and
[2:01:31] not have to go in there with fear
[2:01:33] because i know that i know that i know
[2:01:35] that if he's calling me i better just
[2:01:38] say yes lord
[2:01:41] oh i'm not getting a lot of amens
[2:01:44] it's like the old preacher used to say
[2:01:46] everybody wants to go to heaven nobody
[2:01:48] wants to die
[2:01:52] oh preach on
[2:01:55] said
[2:01:56] paragraph 93 but if that channel
[2:01:59] has been cleaned out or cleared out and
[2:02:01] been purged and been filled on the
[2:02:03] inside with the holy spirit that don't
[2:02:06] even come in memory
[2:02:13] thank you sister for that amen because i
[2:02:15] think that's worthy of an amen
[2:02:17] because the the prophet of god is
[2:02:19] telling us here you've got authority by
[2:02:21] the power of the holy spirit that lives
[2:02:22] inside of you to control your memory
[2:02:25] well i want you to know i've always been
[2:02:26] brought up to think you couldn't deal
[2:02:28] with that memory
[2:02:29] you just have to give it to god and hope
[2:02:31] that
[2:02:31] here the prophet is saying the holy
[2:02:33] spirit has the ability to override
[2:02:37] your hard drive
[2:02:39] i'm going to believe that
[2:02:41] the holy ghost has the power to override
[2:02:44] your hard drive and keep down the memory
[2:02:48] that might come to cheat you out of your
[2:02:50] victory
[2:02:51] he said it right here that don't even
[2:02:52] come in memory no matter about miss
[2:02:54] jones and what she did and what happened
[2:02:56] to her you're just going to trust god
[2:02:58] because your faith has been anointed to
[2:03:00] do so that's pretty powerful isn't it
[2:03:02] paragraph 108
[2:03:04] i don't want to bore you
[2:03:06] what you got then
[2:03:08] i love this one i'm telling you this is
[2:03:10] something else
[2:03:11] he said you've got a solar system
[2:03:15] hallelujah
[2:03:17] it's god set the stars in order and said
[2:03:20] hang there till i call you
[2:03:24] you're part of god's solar system
[2:03:26] he's hung you there you're going to hang
[2:03:28] there till he calls you
[2:03:30] he said they stay there nothing's going
[2:03:33] to move them
[2:03:35] how many of you believe those planets
[2:03:36] just hang right where god put them
[2:03:38] whoa
[2:03:40] and they're hanging there now see if he
[2:03:41] doesn't compare you to the same kind of
[2:03:43] thing
[2:03:45] when god can get a man in his hands
[2:03:48] till he can get senses conscience
[2:03:51] everything cleaned out until it stands
[2:03:53] with god behind it in the spirit there's
[2:03:57] not a devil in the world hallelujah can
[2:04:02] poke a doubt
[2:04:04] in there
[2:04:05] that's right he come around and say you
[2:04:08] don't feel any better
[2:04:11] well i love that
[2:04:13] i love brother branham's preaching away
[2:04:14] and he said they'll say i don't feel
[2:04:16] this and i don't feel that and he said
[2:04:18] what does feelings have to do with it
[2:04:22] feelings doesn't change the truth
[2:04:25] how you feel doesn't change whether
[2:04:27] you've received your healing or not what
[2:04:29] you see with your eye doesn't change the
[2:04:31] fact that god has healed you with his
[2:04:34] stripes we are healed we've got to live
[2:04:38] like healed people whether we feel like
[2:04:40] healed people or not
[2:04:43] we've got to live like victorious people
[2:04:46] whether we feel victory in our heart or
[2:04:47] not
[2:04:48] of course remember what brother branham
[2:04:50] said you just keep saying it till you
[2:04:51] believe it
[2:04:54] you know he didn't rebuke us for saying
[2:04:56] something that wasn't so
[2:04:57] because it is so
[2:05:00] he didn't tell us you can't say i'm
[2:05:01] healed if you're not
[2:05:03] because you are
[2:05:06] so he said you just keep saying it i am
[2:05:08] healed i am healed praise god for
[2:05:11] healing me praise god for healing me
[2:05:13] praise god for healing me
[2:05:18] whoa
[2:05:19] it changes thanksgiving dinner
[2:05:26] wow that silly woman
[2:05:27] who would have ever thought that she
[2:05:29] would have gone for black coffee
[2:05:31] with a stomach condition
[2:05:33] that had nearly destroyed her life
[2:05:36] but she got a little revelation
[2:05:38] whoa
[2:05:39] hallelujah i'm healed
[2:05:42] so why don't i just pour some of this
[2:05:44] black
[2:05:46] acid write down my belly and keep on
[2:05:49] giving god praise remember the story
[2:05:52] because the angel of the lord had passed
[2:05:54] that night through the neighborhood
[2:05:56] looking after those two words of god
[2:05:58] that had been spoken over those two
[2:06:00] women
[2:06:01] don't you give up i said don't you give
[2:06:04] up if god said it don't you give up you
[2:06:08] keep on believing him
[2:06:11] keep on praising him for healing for
[2:06:15] victory for deliverance
[2:06:18] until it comes
[2:06:20] well i get embarrassed to do that don't
[2:06:22] you let the devil embarrass you
[2:06:26] you take god at his word
[2:06:29] give him praise
[2:06:33] glory be to god
[2:06:35] my
[2:06:37] watch thinks i'm having a seizure
[2:06:44] now i'm free in more ways than one
[2:06:46] glory
[2:06:48] glory
[2:06:50] whoo
[2:06:51] let me go on now
[2:06:53] you don't feel any better your conscious
[2:06:57] is even gone to that
[2:06:59] the flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah
[2:07:04] the outlet blows a whistle glory to god
[2:07:12] it shines
[2:07:14] out certainly just as clean and clear
[2:07:16] for the word of god to work through the
[2:07:18] power of god see that's the main thing
[2:07:21] now paragraph 110
[2:07:23] i want you to hold on to this
[2:07:25] there's
[2:07:27] your
[2:07:28] battleground
[2:07:30] i don't care how old you are
[2:07:32] i don't care how long you've been in
[2:07:33] this message
[2:07:35] i don't care how smart you are
[2:07:36] or how dumb you feel
[2:07:39] there's your battleground your
[2:07:41] battleground is back here at the
[2:07:43] beginning back here in the soul
[2:07:49] back in your mind that opens
[2:07:53] the mind is the gate to the soul
[2:07:57] the gate to the spirit
[2:07:59] rather
[2:08:00] now brother branham is correcting
[2:08:02] himself
[2:08:04] but i'm not sure
[2:08:05] that a correction was necessary
[2:08:08] because he goes on to say your mind
[2:08:12] opens up and accepts the spirit
[2:08:16] so i'm not sure he's talking was talking
[2:08:18] about the human spirit
[2:08:20] i think he's talking about the spirit
[2:08:22] your mind opens up and
[2:08:25] accepts and i didn't mean to make you
[2:08:27] nervous by
[2:08:28] assuming what he said
[2:08:31] but we do have this glorious privilege
[2:08:34] of having the absolute word of god
[2:08:39] you know this this is precious folks
[2:08:42] this is precious because brother random
[2:08:44] being a human he stuttered sometime he
[2:08:47] would he would you know get get kind of
[2:08:49] hung up like we all do sometime i mean
[2:08:52] in in in making it plain and sometimes
[2:08:54] there's so many commas in a sentence
[2:08:59] that it's hard sometimes to take that
[2:09:01] phrase and go and see exactly which
[2:09:03] which which noun are we talking about or
[2:09:06] maybe it's talking about a verb
[2:09:08] and so aren't you glad that when we get
[2:09:10] hung like that we're not here to correct
[2:09:12] the prophet we don't have to do such a
[2:09:14] thing as that god will take care of that
[2:09:15] but aren't you glad we have a book
[2:09:18] aren't you glad we have an absolute
[2:09:20] you better help me
[2:09:22] or i'm gonna think you're one of them
[2:09:25] aren't you glad that we can take this
[2:09:27] message back to the word
[2:09:30] we don't have to worry about what he
[2:09:31] meant
[2:09:33] we don't have to worry about if there
[2:09:34] needed to be a little correction there
[2:09:36] or if we don't know how many uh how many
[2:09:38] uh didn't bow in elijah's day and all
[2:09:40] that instead of getting caught up with
[2:09:42] that we can go right back to this book
[2:09:44] and brother brandon said if it doesn't
[2:09:45] dovetail
[2:09:49] i thought you'd help me
[2:09:51] he said if that don't meet like the
[2:09:53] chinese laundry
[2:09:55] if you can't put that in there together
[2:09:56] with the word you better leave that
[2:09:58] alone it doesn't mean it in so
[2:10:00] it means you may not know where to place
[2:10:02] it
[2:10:02] so you just leave it isn't that good i
[2:10:04] believe brother branham was talking here
[2:10:06] he said your mind opens up and accepts
[2:10:08] the spirit or it rejects the spirit he
[2:10:12] said you can have little consciousness
[2:10:15] and little feelings and little
[2:10:16] sensations all these things that has
[2:10:19] nothing to do with it
[2:10:20] he said that's just little sensations
[2:10:22] and things but when it comes to reality
[2:10:24] your mind opens it up your mind your
[2:10:28] mind he didn't say your heart
[2:10:32] so don't tell me that he didn't
[2:10:33] understand the power of the mind and the
[2:10:37] thought the ability to think right
[2:10:40] the ability to be delivered from
[2:10:42] stinking thinking and begin to take the
[2:10:45] mind of christ and think like the word
[2:10:49] oh he understood it he understood it and
[2:10:52] he taught it
[2:10:53] he said that has nothing to do with it
[2:10:55] your mind either accepts it or rejects
[2:10:57] it that's it friends god let none of
[2:11:00] them miss it that's how important
[2:11:02] brother branham thought this word was
[2:11:03] god let none of them miss it
[2:11:07] he goes on to say stay with me see it's
[2:11:10] your mind that opens up the door or
[2:11:12] closes the door you know that's what
[2:11:14] took some of us so long to get the right
[2:11:16] baptism
[2:11:17] that's what took some of us along to get
[2:11:19] the godhead
[2:11:20] and to receive the various parts of this
[2:11:22] message truth because our mind was
[2:11:25] acting
[2:11:27] on our behalf
[2:11:29] to reject something
[2:11:31] that seemed contrary to what we knew to
[2:11:34] be the truth aren't you glad the holy
[2:11:36] spirit can override the mind
[2:11:38] aren't you glad revelation overrides the
[2:11:41] mind aren't you glad that he can come
[2:11:43] and reveal to you truth and you're
[2:11:45] willing to throw everything you've ever
[2:11:46] held onto away because once you see it
[2:11:49] you can't unsee it
[2:11:51] aren't you glad you can't unsee it once
[2:11:53] you see it hallelujah
[2:11:56] somebody said did you hear he left the
[2:11:58] message he did what
[2:12:02] how is that possible
[2:12:05] how can you unsee what you've already
[2:12:08] seen
[2:12:09] maybe you had the pastor's revelation
[2:12:13] maybe you had church revelation
[2:12:16] maybe you didn't have a holy ghost
[2:12:17] revelation
[2:12:18] maybe the holy ghost never made it real
[2:12:20] to you if you're holding on to something
[2:12:22] that the holy ghost has never quickened
[2:12:24] to you i encourage you keep going to the
[2:12:27] word keep going in prayer until god
[2:12:30] makes it real
[2:12:31] because a revelation that's been
[2:12:33] revealed to you by the holy spirit
[2:12:34] becomes a part of who you are
[2:12:36] and the enemy can never move you off of
[2:12:38] who you are
[2:12:40] he can try to fool your mind but he
[2:12:42] can't move you from who you are
[2:12:44] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i want
[2:12:46] to get to something before i give out i
[2:12:49] know you're already there
[2:12:52] amen here we go hurry hurry
[2:12:54] he said listen so
[2:12:57] it's your mind that opens up the door
[2:12:59] closes the door and listens to your
[2:13:01] conscience listens to your memory
[2:13:03] listens to your affections
[2:13:04] but when your mind closes itself to
[2:13:07] these things and let god the spirit of
[2:13:09] his word come in what's it do
[2:13:13] i want you to see a shotgun i don't want
[2:13:16] you to see a water hose
[2:13:18] i want you to see a shotgun
[2:13:20] i want you to see god blowing the rest
[2:13:22] of that gunk right out of your mind
[2:13:25] right out of your thinking so that you
[2:13:27] can think his thoughts
[2:13:29] so that you can hold on to his word
[2:13:31] all right let's read on every doubt is
[2:13:33] gone i want that i want that you believe
[2:13:36] it's possible you believe it's possible
[2:13:38] to live here on planet earth and every
[2:13:41] doubt be gone i do
[2:13:43] i do
[2:13:45] i do how is that possible because when
[2:13:47] doubt comes
[2:13:50] you go to war
[2:13:53] it may fly over
[2:13:55] but you're not going to stand still and
[2:13:56] let it build a nest in your mind
[2:13:59] anybody got doubts
[2:14:02] anybody have a doubt
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:09] most of my doubts are in me
[2:14:12] and am i ever going to get it right
[2:14:14] i'm not really doubting that god's going
[2:14:16] to get it right i'm more concerned about
[2:14:18] whether i'm going to get it right
[2:14:19] come on now but i can have victory over
[2:14:21] every doubt
[2:14:23] and when i do i'm going to talk like
[2:14:24] somebody that's dealt with doubt every
[2:14:26] doubt is gone every fear is gone
[2:14:29] i'm a human
[2:14:31] i know what fear feels like
[2:14:33] i want victory
[2:14:35] i want to live with all that bloat out
[2:14:36] of my mind just blow it out
[2:14:39] you know this whole theme was or have
[2:14:41] you lost your mind
[2:14:43] and here's the key have you lost your
[2:14:44] mind if you're still dabbling in doubt
[2:14:47] if you're still dabbling in fear then
[2:14:48] there's a part of your mind that still
[2:14:50] exists that has to be dealt with
[2:14:52] and the word is the only thing that can
[2:14:54] help you deal with that
[2:14:56] thank god we got the word
[2:14:58] he said there's every feeling is gone
[2:15:00] there's nothing standing there but the
[2:15:02] word of god and satan cannot battle
[2:15:04] against that no sir he cannot battle
[2:15:06] against that now we know that's true yes
[2:15:08] sir we do we know that's true now look
[2:15:10] if you think the battle's new let me let
[2:15:12] me read you the next paragraph i know
[2:15:14] i've been reading a while here that's
[2:15:15] all right look at the next paragraph
[2:15:17] 112. these battles has raged since the
[2:15:19] day of the garden of eden
[2:15:21] the battle in the human mind satan
[2:15:22] started it what did he do when he met
[2:15:24] eve he didn't deny god's word he
[2:15:26] whitewashed it he stopped up some of
[2:15:28] those little channels
[2:15:30] here somewhere
[2:15:32] he said but surely god genesis 3 1
[2:15:34] surely god all these things that he
[2:15:36] promised he knowed the word was right
[2:15:37] but he knowed he couldn't just come
[2:15:39] right out and blast that out
[2:15:41] blair like that but he sugar-coated it
[2:15:44] there's where the problem lies started
[2:15:46] in the garden of eden it operates today
[2:15:48] we hear it today we hear the scientists
[2:15:50] today we hear the news commentators
[2:15:51] today we hear most everybody around us
[2:15:54] today
[2:15:56] delicately politically correct trying to
[2:15:58] say things instead of just saying it
[2:16:00] like it ought to be said the enemy is
[2:16:02] always trying to introduce reasoning in
[2:16:04] there because reasoning will take us out
[2:16:06] of faith every single
[2:16:08] every single time
[2:16:10] all right now
[2:16:11] are you gonna stay with me another
[2:16:12] moment
[2:16:14] thank you you have a thought
[2:16:15] and along with that thought you have
[2:16:17] some kind of feeling an emotion
[2:16:19] is attached to every thought
[2:16:21] interesting
[2:16:23] an emotion is attached to every thought
[2:16:24] did you know that sometimes even a
[2:16:26] fragrance
[2:16:27] or a color can be attached to a thought
[2:16:30] what a brain we've got what a brain
[2:16:32] we've got
[2:16:34] just the smell of turkey in the
[2:16:36] in the oven
[2:16:38] let me suggest you don't put your turkey
[2:16:40] carcass in a crock pot
[2:16:44] with water and and and keep the crock
[2:16:46] pot on all night like my wife did to
[2:16:48] make the stock for the suit let me just
[2:16:49] suggest you don't do that
[2:16:52] or else i didn't know she had done it
[2:16:54] and i woke up at three o'clock in the
[2:16:56] morning i thought somebody was baking a
[2:16:57] turkey in our oven
[2:16:59] i could smell it all through the house
[2:17:01] because she had that stock on low and
[2:17:03] that the smell was permeating you just
[2:17:06] smell a turkey like that and you can you
[2:17:08] can see grandma you can remember grandma
[2:17:10] or
[2:17:11] or ambrosia
[2:17:15] did anybody have ambrosia
[2:17:17] at your thanksgiving table
[2:17:22] i didn't
[2:17:23] either place
[2:17:25] but i did growing up ambrosia
[2:17:29] fruit salad
[2:17:31] but coconut on top sprinkled on top now
[2:17:33] i know there's some folks that don't
[2:17:35] like coconut
[2:17:39] they're genetically impaired or
[2:17:40] something i don't know what it is
[2:17:42] and nice nuts on top and you get a bite
[2:17:45] of soft
[2:17:46] fruit and you get a little crunch a
[2:17:48] little coconut and i'm telling you that
[2:17:50] this good stuff
[2:17:52] mince meat
[2:17:54] pie i can smell i can think of my granny
[2:17:58] and smell mince meat pie or if i ever
[2:18:00] smelt mince meat pie i would think of my
[2:18:02] granny's kitchen and i could see
[2:18:04] thoughts are often accompanied by smells
[2:18:09] and even by colors even by pictures
[2:18:13] and memories will go along like that and
[2:18:15] even emotions
[2:18:18] you can hear something
[2:18:20] and experience the emotion that you felt
[2:18:23] when that memory was driven down that's
[2:18:25] why
[2:18:26] words are so powerful
[2:18:28] that's why words are so dangerous
[2:18:31] that's why we have to be very careful
[2:18:32] with the words that we speak not only
[2:18:34] the thoughts we think but the words that
[2:18:36] we speak because they bring people back
[2:18:39] to places they don't really want to go
[2:18:41] now you are not responsible if you don't
[2:18:44] know everyone's history
[2:18:46] and no one knows everybody's history so
[2:18:50] you really can't shame people
[2:18:52] for saying something when they don't
[2:18:54] know what they're stirring up in you
[2:18:57] and you've got to give them a little
[2:18:58] grace
[2:18:59] and not be quite so paranoid
[2:19:02] give them a little bit of grace
[2:19:04] because they may not understand what all
[2:19:06] is connected there and how many of you
[2:19:08] know you have the ability by the grace
[2:19:09] of god to reprogram some of those
[2:19:11] emotions
[2:19:12] pull them down
[2:19:14] because they exalt themselves against
[2:19:16] the truth of god's word he said you're
[2:19:18] an
[2:19:18] overcomer because i overcame you can
[2:19:21] overcome and if one word or one phrase
[2:19:24] or one smell or one thought can take you
[2:19:27] back to the place of despair
[2:19:30] then you're not an overcomer yet
[2:19:32] and so you've got to ask the lord lord i
[2:19:34] want to be free from that i don't want
[2:19:36] to be in a circumstance it reminds me of
[2:19:38] a circumstance that reminds me of a
[2:19:40] circumstance that reminds me of a
[2:19:42] circumstance and throws me into the into
[2:19:44] the despair of depression i want to be
[2:19:48] able to untangle some of that you got
[2:19:50] the word you've got the holy spirit to
[2:19:53] help you you've got the mind of christ
[2:19:57] so so he said
[2:19:58] you have a thought and this is a this is
[2:20:00] a
[2:20:01] neuroscientist you have a thought and
[2:20:03] along with the thought you have some
[2:20:04] kind of feeling or an emotion about it
[2:20:06] that thought gets planted into your
[2:20:08] subconscious along with that feeling
[2:20:10] which causes your body to feel a certain
[2:20:12] way resulting in a behavior that is in
[2:20:15] alignment with whatever you chose for
[2:20:17] your thoughts
[2:20:18] the key is think about what you're
[2:20:20] thinking about
[2:20:23] the key is your life is the expression
[2:20:26] of your thoughts
[2:20:27] if you don't like where your life is
[2:20:29] right now and where your victory level
[2:20:31] is
[2:20:32] then you'll have to change some of that
[2:20:35] by changing the way you think
[2:20:38] oh that sounds too no no
[2:20:40] no no he said it
[2:20:43] this lays right in the message of the
[2:20:44] hour you can't even believe something in
[2:20:46] your heart until you've accepted in your
[2:20:48] mind
[2:20:49] this is not out of the message this is
[2:20:51] the message
[2:20:52] if your prophet thought enough of you in
[2:20:55] the end time to tell you that your great
[2:20:56] battle is going to be one of the mind
[2:20:58] then he must have wanted us to
[2:21:00] understand that we can win the victory
[2:21:01] in our mind
[2:21:04] and yet a lot of folks aren't winning
[2:21:05] that battle
[2:21:06] in fact sometimes we get on top we get
[2:21:08] it
[2:21:11] this roller coaster we've got to have
[2:21:13] something besides a roller coaster
[2:21:15] we got to get up on the mountain and say
[2:21:17] no more doubts no more fear no more
[2:21:19] devil
[2:21:20] you're not doing this to me
[2:21:22] now you've got to think about what
[2:21:24] you're thinking about because there's
[2:21:26] something called ants
[2:21:29] and i've taught the church here about
[2:21:30] ants
[2:21:31] ants will ruin any picnic right
[2:21:34] ants are automatic
[2:21:36] negative
[2:21:38] thoughts
[2:21:40] you can't think an automatic negative
[2:21:42] thought that hasn't already been wired
[2:21:44] in
[2:21:46] an automatic negative thought is a
[2:21:48] thought that will pop into your head
[2:21:50] without you consciously pulling it up it
[2:21:54] just comes
[2:21:55] you've got to win victory over all the
[2:21:57] ants
[2:21:57] anybody with me i want victory over
[2:22:00] every ant
[2:22:01] that tries to spoil my picnic
[2:22:03] you want me to give you some examples
[2:22:05] when we are obsessively dwelling on an
[2:22:08] unpleasant event that happened in our
[2:22:11] life the enemy builds a stronghold
[2:22:15] around that event
[2:22:23] oh i want to say something but
[2:22:26] i don't want to dishonor my own mother
[2:22:32] you've just got to get over
[2:22:35] some of these things
[2:22:38] you gotta let it go
[2:22:40] while you have an opportunity to let it
[2:22:42] go
[2:22:45] it's affecting us in ways that we don't
[2:22:47] really realize sometimes
[2:22:49] it's like
[2:22:50] the old-timers used to say worry is like
[2:22:52] liquid acid on the brain i believe that
[2:22:55] i believe constantly worrying and
[2:22:57] wringing your hands and being fearful my
[2:23:00] poor mother got to a place in her life
[2:23:02] where she was so fearful of wind of
[2:23:05] thunder of lightning of a storm
[2:23:08] and it it became so obsessive and so bad
[2:23:12] that she had such a hard time getting
[2:23:15] the victory over it
[2:23:17] but when vascular dementia started
[2:23:19] taking effect of her mind it never
[2:23:22] bothered her again
[2:23:26] because that part of her brain that had
[2:23:29] been affected
[2:23:32] squashed
[2:23:35] the ant
[2:23:38] it squashed all the wiring that she had
[2:23:40] done
[2:23:42] she saw her mother
[2:23:44] terrified my mother never was terrified
[2:23:46] until the latter years of her life but
[2:23:49] she saw her mother
[2:23:50] terrified of a little storm i know we
[2:23:53] have some bad storms
[2:23:55] but it got so bad that it didn't have to
[2:23:56] be a bad storm to paralyze her my mother
[2:24:00] would lay in the floor and pull the
[2:24:02] couch over on top of her because of a
[2:24:04] thunderstorm
[2:24:06] with no no no warning
[2:24:08] no watch for a tornado
[2:24:12] but when that dementia began to set in
[2:24:14] because of the of the artery in her neck
[2:24:17] originally
[2:24:18] those kind of things never worried her
[2:24:20] anymore
[2:24:21] i find that so interesting and so
[2:24:24] fascinating that her brain and the
[2:24:26] damage that she had to her brain was
[2:24:28] already beginning to affect those
[2:24:30] thoughts and anybody who's lived with
[2:24:32] someone or know someone with alzheimer's
[2:24:34] they they all the memories all the
[2:24:36] things they all the things that were
[2:24:38] automatic and all the things they
[2:24:39] remember they just start losing those
[2:24:41] things
[2:24:42] now that is because the brain
[2:24:45] continues wants destruction
[2:24:48] once this falling away starts
[2:24:50] on this level it just continues but it
[2:24:53] also speaks to us about the ability that
[2:24:56] we have to start working on some of
[2:24:59] those things before
[2:25:01] they do damage
[2:25:03] because neuroscientists tell us that
[2:25:06] these
[2:25:06] automatic negative thoughts that we
[2:25:08] never deal with we got the word to deal
[2:25:10] with them but we never deal with them
[2:25:12] they start affecting us physically
[2:25:14] are you willing to look at that if we
[2:25:16] got time
[2:25:17] so obsessively dwelling on an unpleasant
[2:25:19] event seeing everything as black and
[2:25:21] white and no middle ground no room to
[2:25:24] try to figure out how we can sort this
[2:25:27] for the best
[2:25:30] always using words like always and never
[2:25:34] jumping to conclusions
[2:25:37] talking almost every excuse me taking
[2:25:39] almost everything personal
[2:25:41] always blaming others for your problems
[2:25:44] blaming yourself for things outside of
[2:25:46] your control
[2:25:48] it's not just about blaming other people
[2:25:49] we blame ourselves for things that we
[2:25:51] can
[2:25:52] we apologize for things that we had
[2:25:54] nothing to do with because we're blaming
[2:25:56] ourselves as though we had something to
[2:25:58] do with it brother sister it's an
[2:25:59] automatic negative thought
[2:26:01] it's more than that it's a stronghold of
[2:26:03] the mind
[2:26:05] and you don't have to live like that for
[2:26:07] the rest of your life there's victory
[2:26:09] for us
[2:26:10] the word can settle some of this
[2:26:13] those are being driven by shoulds and
[2:26:15] shootings and could'ves and would'ves
[2:26:18] and i wish i had ofs
[2:26:20] it will torment you
[2:26:22] there is no torment there's no fear
[2:26:25] brings torment
[2:26:26] there's no fear and there's no torment
[2:26:28] in perfect love how many of you know
[2:26:30] that let me give you an example from the
[2:26:31] message and i'll hurry everything uh
[2:26:33] this is a message everlasting life and
[2:26:35] how to receive it i'm nearly done
[2:26:38] not really i'm just saying that because
[2:26:39] i'm going to have to stop
[2:26:41] paragraph 51 you just imagine somebody
[2:26:44] hates you once
[2:26:46] and they don't hate you
[2:26:48] but you imagine they do
[2:26:52] i just read to you something from a
[2:26:54] neuroscientist
[2:26:56] now i'm reading to you something for
[2:26:57] brother branham
[2:26:59] sounds to me like brother branham
[2:27:00] understood something about neuroscience
[2:27:04] he just brought it down real plain so
[2:27:06] that you and i who are not
[2:27:07] neuroscientists can understand it
[2:27:10] you just imagine somebody hates you once
[2:27:12] and they don't hate you but you imagine
[2:27:13] they do and you just keep thinking they
[2:27:15] don't like me
[2:27:16] and the first thing watch this and the
[2:27:19] first thing
[2:27:20] you'll
[2:27:22] you'll
[2:27:24] you'll
[2:27:26] be shunning that person
[2:27:30] oh i'll get some amens
[2:27:32] are you afraid if you amen i'm going to
[2:27:33] preach another hour
[2:27:36] because if that's the case i'm going to
[2:27:38] try not to
[2:27:39] if i say the truth will you amend it
[2:27:42] you'll start shunning that person
[2:27:55] when they haven't done nothing to you
[2:27:57] but you fixed it up in your head
[2:28:00] i've done this
[2:28:03] me and charity because i heard her amen
[2:28:06] anybody else
[2:28:08] i've done this
[2:28:09] so much so brother shane i'm gonna read
[2:28:11] it again you just imagine somebody hates
[2:28:13] you once and they don't hate you but you
[2:28:15] imagine they do and you just keep
[2:28:17] thinking they don't like me and the
[2:28:19] first thing you'll be shunning that
[2:28:21] person
[2:28:22] because you think they hate you
[2:28:25] so you'll be pulling away and the next
[2:28:27] thing you know you'll be telling
[2:28:28] somebody
[2:28:31] they're shunning me
[2:28:35] they won't have nothing to do with me
[2:28:38] they hate me
[2:28:41] you see how the mind works
[2:28:43] when they haven't done nothing to you
[2:28:45] read on
[2:28:47] and after a while it becomes so a
[2:28:48] reality
[2:28:50] this is what happens in the brain
[2:28:52] it becomes so a reality to you till you
[2:28:54] actually believe that that person
[2:28:56] doesn't like you and you might bawl them
[2:28:58] out
[2:29:01] you may get your courage up
[2:29:04] and you you just may put a verbal
[2:29:06] whooping on them
[2:29:08] now i'm just sick and tired of you
[2:29:10] shunning me
[2:29:13] what
[2:29:16] i thought you were shunning me
[2:29:19] well you're not mad at me no
[2:29:21] i'm not mad at you you're not mad to me
[2:29:23] no i'm not
[2:29:26] now you know what if these things these
[2:29:28] paradigms these strongholds lasted five
[2:29:32] minutes
[2:29:33] we could all just put up with them
[2:29:36] and go on
[2:29:38] but how many of you know they don't just
[2:29:39] last five minutes
[2:29:41] they get down in our brain let me tell
[2:29:43] you something that disturbs me so much i
[2:29:45] can't stand to see families at odds with
[2:29:47] one another
[2:29:49] because i don't have a large family and
[2:29:51] i and i love to see families getting
[2:29:54] along and doing well
[2:29:57] and worshiping god together and serving
[2:29:59] god together and i don't want to see
[2:30:01] people get out of sorts of one another
[2:30:03] and families divide siblings divide
[2:30:06] grandmothers don't get to see their
[2:30:08] grandbabies
[2:30:10] because somebody said she don't like me
[2:30:13] and it got in their head and they
[2:30:15] started pulling away and then so you
[2:30:16] don't know how to act so you pull away
[2:30:19] and the bridge gets bigger the gap gets
[2:30:21] bigger no bridge gap gets bigger the
[2:30:24] chasm gets bigger and you might even get
[2:30:26] the courage about ball them out or say
[2:30:29] something
[2:30:30] to you they might they might get you
[2:30:31] back for instance your wife
[2:30:39] or your husband
[2:30:41] or some neighbor or something like that
[2:30:43] when the person is absolutely innocent
[2:30:44] of any ill thing
[2:30:46] it's because you just imagine it so
[2:30:49] listen
[2:30:50] i'm not shaming you
[2:30:54] if i were shaming you for feeling this
[2:30:56] way i'd be on myself
[2:30:58] i've gone through this many times in the
[2:30:59] ministry
[2:31:01] many many many many many times
[2:31:06] it's because that you just imagined it
[2:31:08] so but till it becomes a reality to you
[2:31:10] and now brother brandon asked this
[2:31:12] question now see what i mean
[2:31:15] do you see what he means
[2:31:18] do you see how these automatic negative
[2:31:19] thoughts they don't start off getting
[2:31:21] wired in but they get wired in because
[2:31:24] we think them and we think them and we
[2:31:25] think them don't you let anything
[2:31:26] separate you from your family
[2:31:29] don't you let anything separate you from
[2:31:31] your blood and don't let anything
[2:31:32] separate you from your blood your your
[2:31:34] jesus blood family
[2:31:35] your spiritual family you make up your
[2:31:38] mind you're going to do the very best
[2:31:39] you can negative thoughts and choices
[2:31:41] obviously affect our spiritual life but
[2:31:43] they also have a great impact on the
[2:31:45] physical body
[2:31:47] watch this
[2:31:48] 75 to 98 of illnesses today come through
[2:31:53] our thought life 75 to 98
[2:31:57] the gap is so large because they don't
[2:31:59] agree
[2:32:03] i'd say the number is so large i can't
[2:32:04] ignore it
[2:32:08] your thoughts affect you that much
[2:32:12] your thoughts affect every cell are you
[2:32:13] too tired to listen
[2:32:15] your thoughts affect every cell of your
[2:32:17] body
[2:32:18] they have the power to affect every cell
[2:32:20] of your body
[2:32:22] there are three t's that cause uh
[2:32:24] disease in the body
[2:32:26] three t's thoughts
[2:32:28] make up 75 to 98
[2:32:31] of current mental physical emotional and
[2:32:33] behavioral illness
[2:32:36] all stemming from the thought life
[2:32:39] and the other two are combined toxins
[2:32:42] and trauma
[2:32:44] and toxins and trauma make up between 2
[2:32:46] and 25
[2:32:48] of all dis-ease disease
[2:32:51] in the body mentally physically
[2:32:52] emotionally and behaviorally
[2:32:55] i want to tell you something that tells
[2:32:57] me right now that my thoughts
[2:32:59] are more important than my shampoo
[2:33:10] that was so good
[2:33:13] you can quote me
[2:33:16] your thoughts are more important than
[2:33:18] your shampoo
[2:33:20] i don't suggest that you wash your hair
[2:33:22] and motor oil
[2:33:25] but i don't suggest that you receive all
[2:33:28] the garbage and smut and lie and filth
[2:33:32] that the enemy wants to tell you in your
[2:33:34] head lie to you and about you come on
[2:33:40] i suggest we do something about it
[2:33:43] because jesus has given us his word
[2:33:48] hallelujah
[2:33:52] [Applause]
[2:33:55] there's one one more thing i wanna i'm
[2:33:57] gonna get to got to have to
[2:34:01] the subconscious mind doesn't understand
[2:34:03] jokes
[2:34:06] doesn't
[2:34:08] you might laugh as a courtesy
[2:34:12] but you won't find something funny if
[2:34:14] your conscious mind doesn't register
[2:34:17] that it's funny
[2:34:18] i got real problems here
[2:34:22] because i have a strange laugh reflex
[2:34:27] like the time my wife and i flew to
[2:34:29] virginia to a strange place
[2:34:31] and i was fixing to go into a service
[2:34:33] where i didn't know anybody in the room
[2:34:34] in the building and i was nervous we
[2:34:36] weren't long married and
[2:34:39] i didn't have an automatic closure on my
[2:34:42] tailgate
[2:34:47] [Music]
[2:34:54] and i didn't know my wife
[2:34:57] on our wedding anniversary forgive me
[2:34:59] honey
[2:35:00] i'm telling this
[2:35:02] i didn't know my wife still had her head
[2:35:07] it's a terrible way to say it that's how
[2:35:08] i felt
[2:35:10] i didn't know she still had her head
[2:35:11] under the tailgate
[2:35:16] she had gotten her bible and her sweater
[2:35:18] what else do you need
[2:35:24] so i mean i just grabbed it and i give
[2:35:27] it a real shove
[2:35:31] oh no
[2:35:32] listen to all the mamas and grannies oh
[2:35:35] no
[2:35:36] yeah it's terrible it's awful
[2:35:38] i should have been shot
[2:35:42] but i'm telling you i crowned her
[2:35:47] boom
[2:35:51] it was so loud i jumped
[2:35:54] i said
[2:35:56] i asked stupid things when i'm under
[2:35:57] pressure
[2:35:59] i said what was that
[2:36:03] she said my head
[2:36:08] i know i want you to know i just grabbed
[2:36:10] her up in my arms and i just caressed
[2:36:12] her and loved her and said oh darling
[2:36:14] please please please forgive me you
[2:36:17] believe
[2:36:20] that they know me too well around here
[2:36:24] i said what did you have your head still
[2:36:27] stuck under there for
[2:36:33] then i went into a fit
[2:36:36] of hysterical laughter
[2:36:40] so don't break a toe around me
[2:36:43] because when i get nervous i laugh
[2:36:47] i've laughed at funerals
[2:36:50] bad i don't mean just a snicker
[2:36:54] when i get nervous i can really really
[2:36:56] really laugh
[2:36:58] your subconscious mind doesn't
[2:37:00] understand when something is supposed to
[2:37:03] be funny
[2:37:04] unless you have a thought in your
[2:37:06] conscious mind that gives you a grid
[2:37:11] so i hear people laughing all the time
[2:37:13] about things that to me are not funny
[2:37:15] because i don't have a conscious grid
[2:37:18] that that's humor
[2:37:20] but then i laugh when people get hurt
[2:37:24] because i have a conscious grid when i
[2:37:26] don't know what else to do i'll just do
[2:37:28] like the vice president
[2:37:35] and i'll cackle
[2:37:40] because the subconscious mind doesn't
[2:37:42] understand jokes
[2:37:45] it believes
[2:37:47] what you say
[2:37:50] about you
[2:37:56] it doesn't know you're joking
[2:38:00] when you call yourself names
[2:38:04] it it takes up real estate
[2:38:08] in your subconscious mind
[2:38:12] if you continue to engage
[2:38:15] that kind of thought
[2:38:17] that thought gets written
[2:38:19] in your conscious mind
[2:38:23] and you start living out of the
[2:38:25] vibration i hope that don't sound too
[2:38:26] weird
[2:38:27] because it's life
[2:38:29] you start living out of the vibration of
[2:38:31] what you say
[2:38:33] your words over other people matter
[2:38:37] your words over yourself matter
[2:38:40] so i'm just encouraging you now to deal
[2:38:42] with what's going on in you right now
[2:38:45] because we work on our relationships by
[2:38:47] working on what's going on in us right
[2:38:49] now don't ever jokingly say i'm a loser
[2:38:57] i'm clumsy
[2:39:02] we didn't allow our children that were
[2:39:04] clumsy to call themselves clumsy
[2:39:09] they grew out of that
[2:39:11] place
[2:39:12] because we didn't want to validate that
[2:39:15] place
[2:39:16] don't call your children clumsy even if
[2:39:18] they act that way
[2:39:21] don't call them
[2:39:22] weird because there's no possible way
[2:39:26] that they're weird unless you are
[2:39:34] and if you are you shouldn't want them
[2:39:36] to be
[2:39:38] don't speak that over their life
[2:39:41] crazy
[2:39:43] stupid
[2:39:46] you can't do anything right
[2:39:49] those words matter and they matter when
[2:39:52] they when you speak them over someone
[2:39:54] else and they matter when you speak them
[2:39:57] over yourself and they matter when you
[2:39:59] think them over yourself you don't even
[2:40:02] have to speak them out loud i'm so
[2:40:04] clumsy i'm so stupid i cancel all of
[2:40:06] that in the blood of jesus christ
[2:40:10] you cannot say those kinds of things and
[2:40:12] expect your subconscious mind to know
[2:40:15] you're just being funny
[2:40:18] you're a child of god you're the
[2:40:20] purchased possession of the lord jesus
[2:40:23] christ his blood has been applied to
[2:40:26] your life he has invested his holy ghost
[2:40:29] in you you are a carrier of the divine
[2:40:32] life
[2:40:34] come on that's who you are
[2:40:36] you are not a failure you are not stupid
[2:40:38] you are not crazy you are not dumb
[2:40:42] you are none of those things and just
[2:40:44] because you're nervous don't say those
[2:40:46] things about yourself don't say them
[2:40:48] about anybody else
[2:40:50] don't thank them
[2:40:51] because it only intensifies i'm i'm i'm
[2:40:55] i'm winding down
[2:40:57] it only intensifies the battle
[2:41:00] that we're trying to minimalize
[2:41:03] how many of you believe we can
[2:41:04] minimalize this battle
[2:41:06] by taking god's word
[2:41:09] and using god's word
[2:41:11] i can give you tons of examples a whole
[2:41:13] page of examples that i'll never get to
[2:41:18] i'm such an idiot i can't believe i'm so
[2:41:20] stupid he or she's such an idiot i can't
[2:41:22] believe they're so stupid
[2:41:24] i can't uh i should be able to handle
[2:41:26] this but i can't handle this anymore
[2:41:28] this makes me so mad he makes me so mad
[2:41:31] she makes me so mad
[2:41:33] she is never here when i need her he is
[2:41:36] never here when i need him
[2:41:38] i can't believe this is happening to me
[2:41:41] my upbringing prevents me from loving or
[2:41:43] trusting people
[2:41:48] are you the old creature
[2:41:51] are you the new creature
[2:41:53] you can't be both
[2:41:54] did you know i mean i could preach all
[2:41:56] day but it wouldn't work because it'd be
[2:41:57] empty in here
[2:41:59] but the bible says a double-minded man
[2:42:01] is unstable in all of his ways
[2:42:03] we got to make up our mind which mind
[2:42:05] we're going to use
[2:42:06] our reminder he is
[2:42:08] does that speak to anybody
[2:42:10] does that speak to anybody
[2:42:12] okay one more quote
[2:42:15] hallelujah
[2:42:17] but i gotta pick it carefully cause
[2:42:18] there's a bunch
[2:42:20] could i have two more thank you
[2:42:26] don't go nowhere
[2:42:27] hold on just a minute oh my
[2:42:32] oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:42:34] hallelujah
[2:42:38] thank you
[2:42:39] thank you for your mercy
[2:42:42] um

[2:42:48] hear him
[2:42:52] 57.
[2:42:54] paragraph 12
[2:42:56] the mind of christ is to be in the
[2:42:58] church
[2:43:00] and the mind of god
[2:43:03] was in christ
[2:43:05] so powerful once you understand that
[2:43:08] christ
[2:43:09] is the mystery of god
[2:43:12] revealed
[2:43:13] if you can understand that you can also
[2:43:16] understand that the bride
[2:43:19] is the mystery
[2:43:21] of christ
[2:43:23] revealed
[2:43:24] watch it get quiet
[2:43:27] brother braham said they're always
[2:43:28] trying to put it on somebody else
[2:43:30] why don't you recognize what god is
[2:43:32] doing in you
[2:43:33] if jesus christ is the mystery of god
[2:43:35] revealed there has to be a bride in the
[2:43:37] last days who reveal christ
[2:43:40] the mind of christ is to be in the
[2:43:41] church and the mind of god was in christ
[2:43:44] and how that the spirit led christ so
[2:43:46] ought his spirit lead the church you
[2:43:48] don't have time if you're being
[2:43:49] spirit-led to believe all these lies
[2:43:52] that the enemy has to say about you and
[2:43:54] speak them over your life or somebody
[2:43:56] else's speak the word
[2:44:01] i'm told by these who study these things
[2:44:03] these neuroscientists etc i'm told that
[2:44:06] the only way to rewire or to wire out
[2:44:09] the negative thoughts is to wire
[2:44:11] positive affirmations of god's word
[2:44:19] i am blessed
[2:44:23] i am a royal seed of abraham
[2:44:27] i am the bride of christ
[2:44:29] i am a son of god i am an overcomer
[2:44:33] because he said i am i'm filled with the
[2:44:36] holy ghost which is the zoe life of god
[2:44:39] come on
[2:44:40] you say oh that's bragging what is it
[2:44:42] when you say all that other junk
[2:44:46] i'll tell you what it is it's lying
[2:44:50] it's lying no liar
[2:44:54] liars cannot have a part
[2:44:57] come on now we got to get some repenting
[2:44:59] going on
[2:45:00] we've got to repent of some of the lies
[2:45:02] we think
[2:45:03] some of the lies we receive some of the
[2:45:06] lies we tell and we've got to speak the
[2:45:08] truth
[2:45:09] by moving in the opposite spirit i'm a
[2:45:11] child i'm a holy ghost field from the
[2:45:14] top of my head to the soles of my feet
[2:45:16] i'm called out of babylon hallelujah i'm
[2:45:19] a part of the third exodus
[2:45:22] my redemption lay beneath those seals
[2:45:25] and jesus came and loosed those seals
[2:45:28] and made a way for me to see my name in
[2:45:31] the lamb's book of life
[2:45:33] you're still with me
[2:45:35] i can no more be lost than god can be
[2:45:37] lost
[2:45:40] there will not be a rapture unless i'm
[2:45:42] in that rapture
[2:45:45] you see i used to have a little
[2:45:46] pentecostal brain come on musicians
[2:45:49] when i first heard those things
[2:45:52] i couldn't repeated that for nothing
[2:45:55] i couldn't have spoken that out of my
[2:45:57] mouth
[2:45:58] i could have never said there will not
[2:46:00] be a rapture unless i'm in it
[2:46:02] i could have never said
[2:46:04] that i could no more be lost than god
[2:46:06] can be lost
[2:46:07] my brain would have fraud
[2:46:12] i would have thought that's the most
[2:46:14] boastful thing
[2:46:16] until you hear brother branham say it
[2:46:21] somebody said what that what what
[2:46:23] difference did that make to you
[2:46:25] i saw that you could boldly declare
[2:46:29] powerful supernatural truths
[2:46:32] with no personal pride
[2:46:34] at all
[2:46:36] brother branham could say those things
[2:46:38] that it didn't sound like he was
[2:46:39] bragging on himself or his ministry
[2:46:42] he could talk about the seventh angel
[2:46:45] as though he was somewhere else in
[2:46:47] another country
[2:46:48] and you never sensed in listening to him
[2:46:51] that he was bragging on his own self or
[2:46:53] his own ministry he was always lifting
[2:46:55] up jesus come on now he taught us how
[2:46:58] not to be proud
[2:46:59] we have had an example of how power can
[2:47:02] operate in humility
[2:47:05] authority can operate in humility now
[2:47:08] god help us
[2:47:09] help us imitate that because that's what
[2:47:12] the bible said imitate their faith god
[2:47:14] help me to imitate the faith of william
[2:47:16] adam
[2:47:18] it's all right and all the other
[2:47:20] pioneers of the faith who kept the faith
[2:47:22] but lord i thank you particularly
[2:47:25] for the one who tied all these loose
[2:47:27] ends together for the one who'd never
[2:47:29] made it to junior high school but taught
[2:47:31] me so much about neuroscience
[2:47:34] hallelujah
[2:47:36] and how that spirit led christ so his
[2:47:38] spirit ought to lead the church and all
[2:47:40] that god was he poured into christ and
[2:47:42] all that christ was
[2:47:45] he part into the church oh hallelujah
[2:47:48] are you all right with that
[2:47:50] so the church has the power
[2:47:52] let's read on
[2:47:54] so the church has the power you better
[2:47:56] read it you better read it out loud so
[2:47:58] the church has the power that christ had
[2:48:00] christ had the power
[2:48:02] that god had
[2:48:05] so the two or three of you who turned up
[2:48:07] your nose while ago
[2:48:08] and curled your lip
[2:48:10] when i said that the bride is the
[2:48:12] mystery of christ revealed
[2:48:13] i just want to say mm-hmm
[2:48:17] he said it
[2:48:20] he said it
[2:48:22] there's nothing to get men out of shape
[2:48:23] about
[2:48:24] confess that over your life wonder what
[2:48:27] the cells of our body will do with that
[2:48:29] truth if we started speaking it over
[2:48:31] ourselves
[2:48:32] somebody said how do i know if it's true
[2:48:34] or not are you kidding me
[2:48:37] because the word of god said it so
[2:48:39] somebody said well i don't know where i
[2:48:41] stand you don't know where you stand of
[2:48:44] course you know where you stand
[2:48:46] you know exactly where you stand
[2:48:48] you know exactly if there's something
[2:48:50] you need to make right you know exactly
[2:48:52] if there's something you need to do to
[2:48:53] draw closer to jesus christ if you do if
[2:48:56] you know that if you sense that do it do
[2:48:58] it now do it quickly
[2:49:00] and then you start dealing with some of
[2:49:02] the ants that are trying to spoil your
[2:49:04] picnic
[2:49:05] you come back to the truth of god's word
[2:49:07] and let this mind of christ now this is
[2:49:10] this is really really really
[2:49:12] what else can i do to convince you
[2:49:16] it's 145.
[2:49:23] who is this the last one
[2:49:27] water oh my my my paragraph 18
[2:49:30] what if abraham would have took what it
[2:49:32] looked like
[2:49:33] 25 years waiting for a promise that god
[2:49:36] gave him
[2:49:37] what if he took what it looked like
[2:49:41] why he'd have never had the baby
[2:49:44] they'd have he'd never been the father
[2:49:47] of little isaac
[2:49:50] but he believed god's word and wouldn't
[2:49:51] turn it loose
[2:49:55] how about you read the next sentence
[2:49:56] with me
[2:49:57] but he watered it day
[2:50:00] and night strong
[2:50:03] giving praise unto
[2:50:06] god
[2:50:09] i want you to water your truth
[2:50:12] i want you to water your promise
[2:50:14] strongly by giving praise to god each
[2:50:17] and every day even if you don't see the
[2:50:20] reality of the manifestation of that
[2:50:21] promise yet i want you to praise god for
[2:50:24] it anyhow like the prophet set the
[2:50:26] example tell him it's praise god for
[2:50:28] healing me praise god for healing me
[2:50:30] whether you can believe it or not say it
[2:50:31] until you do believe it he give us all
[2:50:33] this amazing advice he'd say oh when
[2:50:36] sarah would say honey it's been 25 years
[2:50:38] since a promise was made and here i'm
[2:50:40] nearly 100. listen to what his answer
[2:50:42] would be
[2:50:44] [Music]
[2:50:46] he'd say praise
[2:50:48] god how many of you know if mama ain't
[2:50:51] happy ain't nobody happy
[2:50:54] and here she was
[2:50:56] don't you think it's time to adjust our
[2:50:58] testimony
[2:51:00] don't you think it's time we we just
[2:51:02] change that a little bit not not talk
[2:51:04] not talk about it all the time
[2:51:06] to every neighbor
[2:51:09] everybody we meet on the street don't
[2:51:11] you think it's time we quit taking out
[2:51:13] an ad in the newspaper every week
[2:51:15] it's been 25 years it's been a long time
[2:51:20] and he'd say praise god we're gonna have
[2:51:22] it anyhow cause god said so
[2:51:26] you getting it
[2:51:30] you're gonna have a baby
[2:51:36] i said you will you carry it you carry
[2:51:39] the seed you carry the promise you water
[2:51:42] the promise with praise give god praise
[2:51:45] no matter what it looks like what it
[2:51:47] feels like what it sounds like what it
[2:51:50] smells like
[2:51:51] he said god said so that settles it
[2:51:53] that's right he know the nature of god
[2:51:56] stand with me
[2:51:57] he knowed the nature of god
[2:51:59] because he was a friend
[2:52:01] of god he knowed how to take him because
[2:52:03] he know that his promises no matter how
[2:52:05] foolish they look or how simple they
[2:52:07] looked or how unreasonable they look
[2:52:08] they were true because god said so so
[2:52:11] that settled it forever and i want you
[2:52:12] to notice that he said this
[2:52:14] that's the way every seed of abraham
[2:52:17] does today
[2:52:18] that's the way the born-again christian
[2:52:20] does today no matter what the world says
[2:52:23] what science says
[2:52:26] we could add in there what cnn says
[2:52:30] fox 2.
[2:52:33] they're so full of lies
[2:52:36] god's word stands above it all
[2:52:39] and they're looking at his word and what
[2:52:41] he said to be the truth it doesn't
[2:52:43] matter if they say today the world can't
[2:52:45] be burned up and the dead of them bodies
[2:52:47] can't rise again god said so and that's
[2:52:50] the truth that settles it forever god
[2:52:52] said so and we keep our eyes and we keep
[2:52:55] our eyes and we keep our eyes and we
[2:52:58] keep our eyes hallelujah and we keep our
[2:53:01] eyes
[2:53:03] somebody cast your eyes right now
[2:53:06] on what he said
[2:53:08] look
[2:53:08] up
[2:53:10] look up above what it looks like
[2:53:13] what it feels like
[2:53:15] look up and see what god's word has said
[2:53:19] take a moment or two of your day to deal
[2:53:22] with those ants
[2:53:24] to deal with those strongholds and
[2:53:27] paradigms
[2:53:28] snatch them down and replace them with
[2:53:32] the truth of god's word because we've
[2:53:34] got to win the greatest battle ever
[2:53:35] fought we will win because jesus has won
[2:53:39] for us
[2:53:40] jesus is the victor if you believe that
[2:53:42] same man
[2:53:43] i want you to stretch your hearts
[2:53:46] before him and
[2:53:47] and just symbolize that if you feel like
[2:53:49] you can by just raising your hands for
[2:53:51] just a moment and look to him i want you
[2:53:54] just to look to him
[2:53:56] benjamin will lead us in something for
[2:53:58] worship
[2:53:58] but while he's getting it ready just
[2:54:00] whenever you do start
[2:54:02] while he's getting it ready we're just
[2:54:04] going to look to the word right now lord
[2:54:06] we're looking to you we've got our eyes
[2:54:08] on the word
[2:54:09] we're taking our eyes off the lies
[2:54:12] and we're focusing them on god's word
[2:54:14] we're thanking you for power and
[2:54:16] authority over every automatic negative
[2:54:18] thought we thank you for the truth of
[2:54:20] epigenetics that by the power of the
[2:54:23] holy spirit we have the ability to
[2:54:25] rewire our own brain
[2:54:28] we actually have the power and the
[2:54:29] authority to shift the dna of our own
[2:54:32] physical body by subjecting it to the
[2:54:35] word of god
[2:54:36] and so every organ of my body that's out
[2:54:38] of line i place you right now under the
[2:54:41] true authority of god's word
[2:54:44] and i command in his authority that you
[2:54:46] obey the word of the lord and you
[2:54:48] function as god has created you to
[2:54:50] function
[2:54:51] somebody ought to claim that kind of a
[2:54:53] promise
[2:54:54] somebody ought to take something going
[2:54:56] on in your body that's hindering you
[2:54:59] and giving you trouble and you ought to
[2:55:01] put that right now in his authority
[2:55:03] under the word under the blood under the
[2:55:06] name of jesus and say i refuse to carry
[2:55:09] this any longer i'm placing this where
[2:55:12] god's word tells me to place it it's in
[2:55:14] your hands lord i am no longer that
[2:55:18] i am no longer that
[2:55:20] i am no longer that my identity is not
[2:55:23] found in my disease
[2:55:25] my identity is not found in what part of
[2:55:28] me is not functioning my identity is
[2:55:30] found in the deepest part of who i am
[2:55:33] where the seed of god lies today i'm
[2:55:35] taking you oh yes

[2:55:39] child of the king will you praise him as

[2:57:39] would like to water with worship
[2:57:42] brother branham told us this after
[2:57:43] service is sometimes the most important
[2:57:46] part
[2:57:47] because we're taking what god has spoken
[2:57:49] over our lives and we are taking a hold
[2:57:52] of that in faith and making it our own
[2:57:54] we're claiming it we're identifying with
[2:57:57] this word i want somebody to leave here
[2:58:00] with more victory than how you came this
