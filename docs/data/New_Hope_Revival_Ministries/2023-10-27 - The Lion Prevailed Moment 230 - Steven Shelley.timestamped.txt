[0:00] you see this is what we are supposed to
[0:02] be excited
[0:04] about not because the demons are subject
[0:07] to us but we're supposed to be excited
[0:09] because our name is written in the book
[0:14] Hallelujah and not a devil in hell is
[0:17] able to move your
[0:19] name oh he can slander eyesee you and
[0:23] criticize you and talk about you and
[0:26] smear your reputation down here but he
[0:28] cannot change the fact that your name is
[0:31] recorded in the
[0:33] deed and it was there before there was
[0:36] anything known about it when it was
[0:40] completely a secret you were there
[0:43] praise God before the worlds were framed
[0:47] before the foundations were laid your
[0:50] name was already on the deed because
[0:54] everything was sealed up in that
[0:57] scroll why the the world could have
[1:00] nearly come to an end if that scroll
[1:03] would have remained sealed but thanks be
[1:06] to God not a prophet not a pastor but
[1:09] the lamb prevailed wrestled with the
[1:13] Devil the lamb wrestled with Satan and
[1:17] overcame him Hallelujah so that the
[1:21] seals could come off of that scroll and
[1:24] we could understand what was going to
[1:27] befall what the world was going to
[1:28] experience but if there was nothing else
[1:31] in the seals except a revelation that
[1:34] I'm one of them that my name is there
[1:38] that I misses Jesus Christ and no matter
[1:42] what happens to this in this life though
[1:45] my flesh is given to the skin
[1:49] worms though I rot out there in a grave
[1:52] somewhere I know I know that I know that
[1:55] I know that my redeemer lives I know
[1:59] that he's going to stand on the earth I
[2:01] know that my eyes are going to see the
[2:03] Living God so when you feel that anxiety
[2:06] coming up because of the uncertainties
[2:09] of the world we live in right now your
[2:11] your shortterm future may concern you
[2:15] deeply but remember the one who planned
[2:18] your long-term future is the one that's
[2:21] going to walk with you through your
[2:23] short-term future he's going to be with
[2:26] his
[2:28] people
