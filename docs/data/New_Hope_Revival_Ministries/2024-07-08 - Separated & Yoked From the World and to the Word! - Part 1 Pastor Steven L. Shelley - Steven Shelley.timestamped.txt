[39:27] let's ask God to bring him safely all
[39:29] the way and whatever God's stirring this
[39:32] morning let's let him do it let's just
[39:33] pray God will help us to stay out of his

[1:04:44] want to hurt his
[1:04:46] heart I want to make him number
[1:04:49] one the one thing I've learned about his
[1:04:52] jealous
[1:04:54] character is that if he is not Lord of
[1:04:57] all he will not be Lord at all he is not
[1:05:01] a lucky rabbit's foot he is not a
[1:05:03] horseshoe over the
[1:05:05] door oh no
[1:05:07] sir he wants to be Lord of everything
[1:05:10] every situation we can easily make him
[1:05:13] Lord over some things but other things
[1:05:16] we try to sort ourselves and we do
[1:05:19] ourselves and we do him a great
[1:05:22] disservice we just let him come and be
[1:05:24] Hebrews 13 8 why don't we just let him
[1:05:28] be Hebrews 13
[1:05:31] and8 in every situation in every
[1:05:36] trial in every concern in every
[1:05:44] burden sing the chorus with me one last
[1:05:47] time

[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:00] talks and he

[1:06:16] joy as we

[1:06:28] ever
[1:06:31] known in the Lord good let's clap for
[1:06:35] these musicians for Chad leading the
[1:06:39] singing David and Ashley and Zack and
[1:06:45] and these ladies and sister Laurel and
[1:06:48] brother Cade we're
[1:06:50] blessed we are very very very blessed
[1:06:56] to have a sound Among Us that breaks
[1:06:59] open the heavens you may be seated just
[1:07:02] a moment it's not that the heavens are
[1:07:05] brass to the
[1:07:07] bride but there is a lot uh between us
[1:07:13] and that Dimension there is a lot of
[1:07:16] Darkness that comes there are a lot of
[1:07:18] burdens and worries and troubles and
[1:07:21] concerns and and thoughts and I sense
[1:07:25] there are even some missing this morning
[1:07:28] because of such things as
[1:07:30] that and we are so
[1:07:34] blessed that God has created Among Us a
[1:07:39] sound that opens up the heavenlies and
[1:07:43] if you need something the way is made
[1:07:45] for it to get to you if you need to go
[1:07:48] up the way has been made for you to get
[1:07:50] up a little higher than what you're
[1:07:52] going through at the moment and let me
[1:07:55] tell you something there's no need to
[1:07:57] worry about anything when you're in
[1:08:00] here it's going to wait on you how many
[1:08:03] of you found that to be the truth it's
[1:08:05] going to wait on you it'll meet you at
[1:08:07] the door sometime in your automobile
[1:08:10] before you get to lunch why some
[1:08:13] sometimes uh you can get all agitated
[1:08:17] and twisted up trying to decide where to
[1:08:20] go
[1:08:22] eat peace until it's time to decide
[1:08:26] where to go eat you everything that you
[1:08:30] have faced until you got here today most
[1:08:33] of it'll be waiting on you when you
[1:08:34] leave here the hope is that something
[1:08:38] will transpire in your life that when
[1:08:41] you leave this atmosphere you'll be able
[1:08:43] to face it a little differently than you
[1:08:46] did before you came that's why it's
[1:08:49] vital for you to be in the presence of
[1:08:51] the Lord it's vital and and uh I know
[1:08:55] it's the scripture said where two or
[1:08:57] more but let me tell you something he'll
[1:08:59] be the one he'll make it up you know a
[1:09:02] religious Jew can't pray uh he can read
[1:09:05] the Psalms and he can do all kinds of
[1:09:08] things alone but in order to have a a
[1:09:11] certain level of prayer he has to have a
[1:09:15] minion he has to have nine others who
[1:09:17] will join with him for this special
[1:09:19] level of prayer and and so sometimes
[1:09:22] you'll see religious Jews in the airport
[1:09:25] looking for other religious Jews so that
[1:09:28] they can stand in the corner 10 and have
[1:09:31] this special level of prayer and uh I've
[1:09:34] been I've been locked in a in a tight
[1:09:38] bathroom on an Lal flight to Israel
[1:09:42] while while the religious Jews were
[1:09:44] making a minion outside the door well
[1:09:48] I'm slightly claustrophobic and I had to
[1:09:50] interrupt the
[1:09:51] prayer because I get in there and get
[1:09:54] out as fast as I possibly can it's a
[1:09:56] little tight in there for me but I'm so
[1:10:00] thankful that I don't have to go find
[1:10:02] another
[1:10:04] believer or are are nine other believers
[1:10:07] to face a to find that special level of
[1:10:12] prayer I can go anywhere I want to go if
[1:10:16] I'm willing to come his way I'm going to
[1:10:20] be open and free with you today and I I
[1:10:23] want to I want to ask something of you I
[1:10:25] I want to ask you to look at
[1:10:28] me I don't often do that I'm not a lot
[1:10:31] to look at but I'm asking you to do that
[1:10:36] today it it's it's most distracting at
[1:10:40] times when I can see that your attention
[1:10:43] is somewhere
[1:10:45] else I don't want you to miss what God
[1:10:49] may have for you today it's not that I
[1:10:51] think that I have something on my own
[1:10:54] that's so important
[1:10:56] but I've been with him about this today
[1:10:59] and I try to do that every single week
[1:11:03] and I don't wait until Saturday night or
[1:11:05] Sunday morning oh I'm an hour I'm at
[1:11:08] least an hour hour and a half in the
[1:11:10] word every Sunday morning before I get
[1:11:12] here but that's not to decide what to
[1:11:14] preach usually it is to pull things
[1:11:17] together and make sure that I'm ready
[1:11:20] but I I want you to know last Monday
[1:11:22] morning I woke up my heart was being
[1:11:24] stirred and and uh I started riding on
[1:11:26] it Wednesday morning after church
[1:11:28] Tuesday night I started riding on it the
[1:11:30] Lord's taking me in a slightly different
[1:11:32] direction today I ask for your prayers
[1:11:35] we are excited to hear good reports
[1:11:39] about what the Lord is doing in Indiana
[1:11:42] we're so thankful that our precious
[1:11:44] Miller family from
[1:11:46] Missouri uh brother Truman and sister
[1:11:48] Martha who've been with us for so many
[1:11:51] years long distance they made their way
[1:11:54] over to the meetings in Indiana we heard
[1:11:57] that even our brother Ryan Jasper who
[1:12:02] was with us here some months ago he was
[1:12:04] over to Indiana for the service Friday
[1:12:07] night I believe he had to leave
[1:12:09] yesterday uh to get back to his church
[1:12:13] but we're just thankful to hear and so

[1:12:28] I'm so thankful that they are there to
[1:12:32] amen the word do it's a different
[1:12:34] atmosphere God can meet needs even our

[1:12:40] that they that they haven't had
[1:12:42] particularly ministered to here that
[1:12:44] doesn't offend me that's the way that
[1:12:47] God
[1:12:48] works and uh I'm just so thankful that
[1:12:51] all of you didn't feel compelled to go
[1:12:54] I'm so thank ful you know some of the

[1:13:14] July they closed their church and their

[1:21:15] fries once or twice a year that right
[1:21:18] there is is is uh really a hard thing to
[1:21:22] do only one CE or twice and it used to
[1:21:25] be when I was up there having meetings
[1:21:28] she would say I'm going to have french
[1:21:30] fries but this will be the last time
[1:21:32] this year I wished I was that
[1:21:34] dedicated I'm
[1:21:36] not but anyway she and her husband I met
[1:21:40] them the same weekend that I saw sister
[1:21:44] Alfreda in Michigan at the missionary
[1:21:47] camp that I or the missionary meetings
[1:21:50] that I preached so many years ago early
[1:21:52] 9s for brother Samuel John son and the
[1:21:56] wears had brought a quilt and the quilt
[1:22:00] was the life and Ministry of brother
[1:22:02] brandom made into a quilt and I thought
[1:22:05] it was one of the most amazing things
[1:22:07] I'd ever seen in my life and I wanted
[1:22:10] it and uh I said to Sister Louise do you
[1:22:14] think the sister it's not mine she said
[1:22:16] the woman who made it goes to our church
[1:22:18] I said well do you think she would sell
[1:22:20] it to me she said no I don't think so
[1:22:23] and I said well I'd like to to have it
[1:22:25] and I I would give her $1,000 for it
[1:22:28] that's a lot of money I don't know where
[1:22:30] I was going to get it but wasn't going
[1:22:32] to pull it out of the wallet that's for
[1:22:33] sure and nope no I don't believe she'd
[1:22:36] sell it well years later I met the woman
[1:22:39] who made the quilt and her name was
[1:22:41] Sister
[1:22:43] Whitaker and she had a daughter named
[1:22:47] Stacy so I found the way to get the
[1:22:50] quilt
[1:22:54] I want you to know that quilt has cost
[1:22:56] me many thousands and thousands and
[1:23:01] thousands of
[1:23:03] dollars but I got the quilt and yes

[1:24:29] at me even though I'm not pretty thank
[1:24:32] you so much Ma I didn't hear you but I'm
[1:24:34] assuming you will Matthew
[1:24:37] 25:
[1:24:39] 31-40 Le let's hear what God would say
[1:24:42] to us today I've been wrestling in the
[1:24:44] night for some of you I I could call you
[1:24:47] by name but it wouldn't do much good but
[1:24:50] I'm asking that God gives you Victory I
[1:24:52] want you to have victory in him
[1:24:54] he is the Victor our
[1:24:58] Victorious King isn't he isn't he
[1:25:01] Victorious when the son of man shall
[1:25:04] come in his glory and all the Holy
[1:25:09] Angels with him boy that sounds good to
[1:25:11] me then shall he sit upon the throne of
[1:25:17] his glory beautiful language and before
[1:25:23] him this is read letter words of Jesus
[1:25:26] and before him now listen isn't that
[1:25:28] unusual he's speaking about
[1:25:31] himself he is the one that's going to
[1:25:33] sit on the throne of Glory this is red
[1:25:36] letter this is Matthew this is the
[1:25:38] gospel and before him shall be gathered
[1:25:42] all
[1:25:44] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:25:48] from another as a Shepherd divideth his
[1:25:53] sheep from the goats now in that day
[1:25:57] Church there's going to be sheep Nations
[1:26:00] and there's going to be goat
[1:26:02] Nations and sheep nations are going to
[1:26:06] be made up of those Nations that have
[1:26:09] had sympathy and
[1:26:12] compassion and prayer concern and love
[1:26:16] for Israel and the Jewish
[1:26:19] people and there is only a Remnant left
[1:26:23] in this nation but thank God there's a
[1:26:26] Remnant that prays every day for for the
[1:26:30] nation of Israel it's a blessing to do
[1:26:34] so and goat nations are those that will
[1:26:38] that will reject her and turn her down
[1:26:42] and uh despise her and accuse her and
[1:26:46] and and if you had to guess uh will
[1:26:48] there be more sheep Nations or goat
[1:26:50] Nations what would you think goat
[1:26:53] Nations but we we learned that it's not
[1:26:56] just Nations that are going to be
[1:26:58] divided all of God's sheep are going to
[1:27:02] be divided from goats and they're
[1:27:05] similar you know they're they're
[1:27:08] cousins and they both taste good did you
[1:27:11] know that and uh they eat similar diet
[1:27:15] and they sound similar but they're not
[1:27:18] the same and it's going to take one
[1:27:21] smarter than we are to decide who is a
[1:27:24] sheep and who is a goat but not only
[1:27:28] Nations will be divided but also
[1:27:30] individuals will be divided let's go on
[1:27:33] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:27:37] hand this is individually now he shall
[1:27:41] set the sheep on his right hand but the
[1:27:44] goats they're going on the
[1:27:46] left and uh he goes on then shall the
[1:27:50] king say unto them on his right hand
[1:27:53] come ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:27:58] Kingdom prepared for you what's the next
[1:28:05] phrase when was the kingdom prepared for
[1:28:07] the sheep
[1:28:12] from wasn't an
[1:28:14] afterthought part of the original plan
[1:28:17] for I was a hungered and you gave me
[1:28:21] meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:28:25] I was a stranger and you took me
[1:28:28] in naked and you clothed me I was sick
[1:28:32] and you visited me I was in prison and
[1:28:36] you came unto me then shall the
[1:28:39] righteous answer him the sheep saying
[1:28:42] Lord when saw we thee unhung hered and
[1:28:45] fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
[1:28:50] when when saw we thee a stranger and
[1:28:53] took thee or naked and clothed thee all
[1:28:57] questions or when saw we thee sick or in
[1:29:01] prison and came unto thee and the King
[1:29:05] shall answer and say unto them verily I
[1:29:08] say unto you in as much as ye have done
[1:29:11] it unto one of the least of these my
[1:29:15] brethren ye have done it unto me
[1:29:20] remember he is our elder brother he
[1:29:24] didn't say that that you've done to my
[1:29:25] children like so many have quoted he
[1:29:28] said that you have done to my brethren
[1:29:31] to the least of my brethren he is our
[1:29:35] elder brother both our Papa and our
[1:29:37] elder brother and when you have done to
[1:29:39] them even the least of these my brethren
[1:29:43] ye have done it unto me do you believe
[1:29:47] that do you understand that I'm thankful
[1:29:50] for that
[1:29:51] promise I'm very thankful
[1:29:54] is that verse third that's verse what
[1:29:57] what verse have we come to 40 all right
[1:29:59] one other place but I'll let you be
[1:30:01] seated God bless you as you take your
[1:30:03] rest I'd like to also read Red Letters
[1:30:08] From The Book of Matthew again chapter
[1:30:13] 11 verse 25 through 30 and at that time
[1:30:19] Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh
[1:30:23] father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[1:30:27] thou Hast hid these things from
[1:30:31] the wise and prudent and Hast revealed
[1:30:38] them unto
[1:30:43] babes are you all looking at
[1:30:50] me I mean I I'm very serious this
[1:30:53] morning
[1:30:54] very
[1:30:56] serious I don't like to be that
[1:31:00] serious when brother brandham was
[1:31:03] quoting this verse he would often
[1:31:05] misquote
[1:31:07] it he had a habit of running verses
[1:31:11] together I'm glad he's the only one
[1:31:13] that's ever done that I know none of us
[1:31:17] have ever done that I've done it many
[1:31:19] times and then someone said now where is
[1:31:21] that at you go looking for oh oh well
[1:31:24] part of it is over here and part of it
[1:31:26] is over there when brother Brandon was
[1:31:29] quoting this verse he would often say
[1:31:31] thou has hid these things from the wise
[1:31:33] and prudent and H has revealed them unto
[1:31:36] babes do you know what he would say next
[1:31:38] such as would
[1:31:39] learn a and there's nothing wrong with
[1:31:42] that just didn't say it right here in
[1:31:44] this particular place because if we know
[1:31:47] anything about children babes toddlers
[1:31:51] they they learn some things and you
[1:31:54] can't teach them some things when
[1:31:57] they're when they're
[1:31:58] nursing the there there is a season for
[1:32:01] learning all thing are you with
[1:32:06] me there's a season for learning all
[1:32:10] things and I want to be in the right
[1:32:13] season to learn what I'm supposed to
[1:32:16] learn I want to get it under my belt
[1:32:19] because I don't want to be uh 3540 years
[1:32:24] in the faith and still toddling around
[1:32:28] like like like a a baby or like a
[1:32:33] toddler when I was a boy I enjoyed boy
[1:32:37] things but when I became a man the
[1:32:40] Apostle Paul said I I had to put away
[1:32:42] some of those childish things and I want
[1:32:47] you to know folks we're kind of growing
[1:32:50] into that place you know you're not
[1:32:53] measured by your years here on the earth
[1:32:57] spiritually you're you're kind of being
[1:33:00] measured by your years in the
[1:33:02] faith and I know as as we have learned
[1:33:06] in the natural that babies don't all
[1:33:08] grow at the same
[1:33:10] time H they they grow at different
[1:33:12] spurts have you ever somebody said over
[1:33:15] a little baby well must be having a
[1:33:17] growing spurt because they seem to be
[1:33:20] eating a little more and you know what
[1:33:22] in fact we see that we see that you're
[1:33:25] growing and the baby needs a little more
[1:33:27] nourishment and it eats a little more
[1:33:30] and and it's that way spiritually
[1:33:32] sometime we eat a little more when we
[1:33:35] need it well the reality is we're now in
[1:33:39] a place where we're going to need God's
[1:33:41] food his nourishment spiritual food in
[1:33:45] due season we're going to need it more
[1:33:47] and more all the time because it's only
[1:33:51] the word of God that's going to change
[1:33:55] us I know this is going to be a little
[1:33:57] rough here for a little while but we're
[1:33:58] going
[1:34:00] somewhere uh we are we are being
[1:34:04] separated and we are being yolked and I
[1:34:08] want to call this message separated and
[1:34:11] yolked and I want to give it a subtitle
[1:34:15] from the
[1:34:16] world and to the word we are being
[1:34:20] separated from the world and we are
[1:34:23] being yolked to the word isn't that
[1:34:27] exactly right and that's why we find
[1:34:30] this in Matthew 11 25 and 30 I thank
[1:34:33] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:34:37] because thou has hid these things from
[1:34:39] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[1:34:42] him unto babes let's go on even so
[1:34:45] father for so it seemed good in thy
[1:34:50] sight all things are delivered unto me
[1:34:54] of my father and no man knoweth the son
[1:34:59] but the father neither knoweth any man
[1:35:02] the father save the son and he to
[1:35:06] whomsoever listen he to whomsoever the
[1:35:11] son will reveal him you can't know the
[1:35:15] fatherly aspect of God unless it is
[1:35:18] revealed to you by the son Nobody Knows
[1:35:22] the father like the son
[1:35:24] and nobody knows the son like the father
[1:35:27] and when we have the Son of God he
[1:35:30] reveals to us the nature and the
[1:35:34] character of the Father which is
[1:35:37] sometimes uh in our human way of
[1:35:40] thinking uh a little regimented or a
[1:35:44] little rigid but I want you to know the
[1:35:46] Father's Love For Us is so
[1:35:50] great that he has paid the ultimate
[1:35:54] sacrifice he became the son he stepped
[1:35:58] down into a condescended form died on
[1:36:02] the cross securing eternal life for us
[1:36:05] does that sound like somebody who hates
[1:36:07] you does that sound like somebody who
[1:36:10] wants to crush you to powder no it
[1:36:12] sounds like somebody who loves
[1:36:15] us and loved us with such a love that he
[1:36:20] came up with a masterful plan
[1:36:23] that he might be able to win us and to
[1:36:27] redeem us oh what a blessed people we
[1:36:31] are redeemed of the Lord for such an
[1:36:35] hour as this to know that the son is
[1:36:38] revealing the father that the bridegroom
[1:36:42] is revealing to the bride the very
[1:36:44] nature of the Creator it's powerful and
[1:36:48] as with someone was praying the glory I
[1:36:51] think brother Hawk the glory of knowing
[1:36:55] that we are the the reproduced Christ in
[1:37:00] the earth I tell you that's a powerful
[1:37:02] thing to know that God has reproduced
[1:37:07] himself in the life of his
[1:37:10] sons
[1:37:12] powerful somebody said that may be too
[1:37:15] big of a description is it if the very
[1:37:19] life of God is in you if the very Spirit
[1:37:24] and the fullness of who Jesus Christ is
[1:37:28] and was has been now emptied into the
[1:37:32] bride is it really so much to say that
[1:37:37] he has reproduced himself in a multi
[1:37:40] membered body in a many-membered bride I
[1:37:43] don't think it's so very much at all I
[1:37:46] think it's a logical understanding we
[1:37:49] know that Christ is the mystery of God
[1:37:53] revealed
[1:37:54] and that
[1:37:56] demands that demands that the bride be
[1:38:00] the mystery of Christ revealed if it was
[1:38:04] the responsibility of the son to reveal
[1:38:08] the father it is now the wife's
[1:38:12] responsibility to reveal the
[1:38:15] bridegroom now that's what the word
[1:38:17] teaches us somebody said is that just
[1:38:20] quotations no that's the book that's
[1:38:23] from the
[1:38:24] absolute that's from The Prophet's
[1:38:27] quotebook the Holy
[1:38:30] Bible anybody with me that's where he
[1:38:33] quoted from
[1:38:36] 1611 right there blackb Bible and he was
[1:38:41] quoting from that you sound like you're
[1:38:43] getting a little aggressive well I don't
[1:38:44] mean to sound that way but this one this
[1:38:49] message has cost me something and
[1:38:52] therefore it's of greatest value to me
[1:38:57] when when you labor for something and
[1:39:00] you have to fight some imps to come to
[1:39:04] something you would like to think that
[1:39:07] someone would value the effort because
[1:39:11] whether we recognize it or not it's our
[1:39:14] destiny ha it's our destiny that's being
[1:39:18] revealed and we are not yet what we will
[1:39:21] be in fullness we are now now in measure
[1:39:25] what we will soon be in fullness and
[1:39:28] we'll only get there by being separated
[1:39:32] from the world and yoked to the
[1:39:39] word giving you a chance to
[1:39:42] agree because it's just the
[1:39:45] truth even so father for so it seem good
[1:39:50] in thy sight verse 27 again all the
[1:39:54] things are delivered unto me of my
[1:39:56] father and no man knoweth the son but
[1:39:59] the father neither knoweth any man the
[1:40:00] father save the son and he to whomsoever
[1:40:04] the son will reveal him praise God I'm
[1:40:07] one of them I want to stop and say thank
[1:40:11] you Lord that I am one of them that the
[1:40:15] son has revealed the father to
[1:40:19] Hallelujah come he said red letter come
[1:40:23] unto me all ye that labor and
[1:40:29] are heavy laden and I will give
[1:40:35] you
[1:40:36] rest
[1:40:38] rest I will give you what rest
[1:40:42] rest what was it that the children of
[1:40:45] Israel
[1:40:47] missed they missed
[1:40:52] rest here Hebrews why did they Mis rest
[1:40:57] not because they didn't have the
[1:40:59] word Moses was a faithful deliverer of
[1:41:05] the word but the Bible tells us that the
[1:41:09] reason why Israel failed why they came
[1:41:13] short of rest is because they didn't do
[1:41:18] their part with the word when Moses
[1:41:23] delivered the word the word was no
[1:41:26] longer on the hands of
[1:41:30] Moses when Moses delivered the message
[1:41:33] when
[1:41:35] Noah when Noah delivered the
[1:41:38] word the the word was no longer weighing
[1:41:42] heavy on Noah's hands it was now on the
[1:41:46] hands of the people and they mocked
[1:41:49] him they made fun of him rain are you
[1:41:53] with me rain what is rain we've never
[1:41:57] seen rain I don't believe in a flood cuz
[1:42:01] I don't I don't know what rain is never
[1:42:04] seen anything like that but I want you
[1:42:06] to know it
[1:42:08] came and the Word was on their hands and
[1:42:12] the Bible said what happened was they
[1:42:16] perished they perished they lost
[1:42:20] everything including their lives
[1:42:24] because the word was on their hands and
[1:42:27] they failed to do anything about it the
[1:42:29] children of Israel fail oh my it's
[1:42:32] getting tied in here the children of
[1:42:35] Israel fail uh to enter into rest we've
[1:42:39] been talking about that and why did they
[1:42:42] fail to enter into the promise two
[1:42:44] reasons we can think of from the word
[1:42:47] number one they
[1:42:50] believed an evil report
[1:42:54] you have to measure what some people
[1:43:01] say you can't take it at face
[1:43:05] value because they've been spending too
[1:43:07] many times too much time with the
[1:43:12] 10 and not enough time hear
[1:43:15] me not enough time with the
[1:43:18] two if you hang around evil report
[1:43:21] negative report you you're going to be a
[1:43:23] negative person a Negative Nancy and if
[1:43:26] you're not careful it'll just spew out
[1:43:30] of you so when someone's listening to
[1:43:33] you regurgitate an evil report give me
[1:43:35] just a
[1:43:39] moment then it it just bathes them have
[1:43:43] you ever been
[1:43:45] bathed around the carismatic world they
[1:43:48] call it
[1:43:49] slime and I've had it I've been
[1:43:54] slimed it's not a good feeling I don't
[1:43:57] know a lot about slime when I was a kid
[1:44:00] we didn't play with slime we played with
[1:44:05] Play-Doh we didn't always get to have
[1:44:07] the pretty colors and the nice little
[1:44:10] gadgets and detachments and and
[1:44:13] factories that they they buy now for
[1:44:15] Play-Doh but Mama knew how to make it
[1:44:18] and Granny knew how to make it and and
[1:44:21] uh sometimes that was all we had
[1:44:24] sometimes it was our own fault cuz we Lo
[1:44:26] left the lids
[1:44:28] off of our store bought kind and it
[1:44:32] turned hard I don't care how hard you
[1:44:34] try to keep the colors
[1:44:37] separate they'll get mixed
[1:44:40] up and and so that's what we played with
[1:44:43] but but one generation after me there
[1:44:45] was a a a television network for kids
[1:44:48] then called Nickelodeon I never saw it
[1:44:52] but I was told know that they're the
[1:44:54] ones who made slime a famous play uh Toy
[1:45:00] like playdo but it's kind of a little
[1:45:03] green it's green and
[1:45:05] gooey and kind of you know drops down
[1:45:09] slink slink is you know drops down
[1:45:12] Play-Doh is is really moldable but I
[1:45:14] don't think you can any of you have ever
[1:45:17] played with slime I don't think you can
[1:45:18] you make things out of
[1:45:20] slime so I get that in my
[1:45:24] mind uh I will be honest with you I have
[1:45:27] a terrible confession to make when I was
[1:45:30] a kid on occasion I did see
[1:45:39] Scooby-Doo and and and in Scooby-Doo
[1:45:42] there were some
[1:45:44] enemies that would spew what looked like
[1:45:49] slime and it would come dripping off
[1:45:53] you you know what I'm talking about kind
[1:45:54] of sliding down and piling up on the
[1:45:58] ground I've been there I've been there
[1:46:00] I've been around people who
[1:46:04] vomit
[1:46:06] negativity who vomit evil
[1:46:10] report and you're just covered with it
[1:46:13] and you take it with you and before you
[1:46:16] know it you're agreeing with the
[1:46:20] 10 oh
[1:46:23] you're afraid to amen cuz I'm taking so
[1:46:25] much time to get started you're afraid
[1:46:28] I'll never get through so you're not
[1:46:30] going to cheer me
[1:46:32] on thank you
[1:46:34] brother so it's important to know we've
[1:46:39] got to choose sometime we have to pick
[1:46:41] and choose
[1:46:44] sometime because I don't I don't want to
[1:46:46] be one of
[1:46:47] them who says the the ground opens up
[1:46:50] and swallows the inhabitants of the
[1:46:52] promis land not even worth having
[1:46:54] because the Earth opens up and swallows
[1:46:56] you so you don't even know how long and
[1:46:59] everybody there is a giant when as we
[1:47:02] have said several weeks now just one
[1:47:04] family of giants see how the devil will
[1:47:07] have you looking at everybody around
[1:47:10] you everybody's against me
[1:47:15] no
[1:47:16] no everybody's not now let me be honest
[1:47:20] with you somebody's
[1:47:24] are and if everybody's for
[1:47:29] you something ain't
[1:47:31] right you're not
[1:47:34] separated if if all your friends and all
[1:47:37] your acquaintances and everybody you
[1:47:39] know is for
[1:47:41] you nobody ever sends text about
[1:47:47] you something's
[1:47:49] wrong no but know this everybody is not
[1:47:53] against you somebody's for you and
[1:47:57] somebody's praying for you whether they
[1:48:01] tell you or
[1:48:04] not somebody's
[1:48:06] wrestling on your
[1:48:09] behalf and you you know I know people
[1:48:12] like to be
[1:48:13] engaged people like to be
[1:48:16] told I'm praying for you I'm fighting on
[1:48:20] your behalf sometimes people like to
[1:48:22] hear that but there's a time to share we
[1:48:26] should share we should encourage we
[1:48:28] should let people know I'm in the battle
[1:48:30] but I want you to know if you've got any
[1:48:33] wisdom at
[1:48:34] all there's a time to stand
[1:48:38] back and do your your caring on your
[1:48:42] knees and do your concerning in prayer
[1:48:46] am because sometimes you might discern
[1:48:50] that this is not the devil trying to
[1:48:53] kill somebody this is God trying to
[1:48:56] bring somebody to the
[1:49:01] rest two reasons why I may have to break
[1:49:05] this up and come back and preach
[1:49:07] tonight uh the reality is two reasons
[1:49:13] why they didn't go and enter into that
[1:49:15] rest one they they got under the
[1:49:17] influence of an evil report and the
[1:49:19] whole generation paid the price for
[1:49:22] listening to to them they should have
[1:49:23] stood up against them just like you
[1:49:26] ought to do
[1:49:28] sometime when somebody's sliming
[1:49:31] you you they may not even be attacking
[1:49:34] you they're just sliming you with their
[1:49:37] stuff sometime you ought to just stand
[1:49:40] up and say that may be how you
[1:49:44] feel that's legitimate but that's not
[1:49:47] how I feel that's just want you to know
[1:49:50] we don't all feel that way I want you to
[1:49:53] know for me I'm fully
[1:49:55] persuaded I know that I know that I know
[1:49:58] that I know that I know that I know that
[1:50:01] the son has revealed the father to
[1:50:04] me I'm fully persuaded so you know keep
[1:50:08] your Negative Nancy report to yourself
[1:50:11] your evil report keep it to yourself I
[1:50:14] don't want to be slimed sometimes you
[1:50:18] you have to stand up to somebody you
[1:50:21] love and care about
[1:50:23] and say
[1:50:25] whoa sounds like a sounds like a p PE to
[1:50:37] me pray tell brother Shelly what a PP
[1:50:40] personal
[1:50:43] problem they're not all for
[1:50:47] sharing sounds like you've got a p
[1:50:50] PE it'll get 1 mention if nothing
[1:50:54] else I'm going to go pray I'm going to
[1:50:56] live my life in prayer for you but I'm
[1:51:00] not going to take on your
[1:51:03] PP oh somebody ought to hear
[1:51:06] me I've watched this
[1:51:09] thing I've been watching this thing for
[1:51:11] a long time down through the years of my
[1:51:14] life and I've watched how people attract
[1:51:18] certain kinds of people and and and and
[1:51:22] how people click up based on their own
[1:51:26] weakness when they ought to be clicking
[1:51:28] up based on strengths instead of
[1:51:30] weaknesses come on but the enemy brother
[1:51:33] brandom told it right the enemy will try
[1:51:36] to pull uh you into a little place of
[1:51:39] straggling behind or off to the side or
[1:51:44] he may even fool you into thinking that
[1:51:46] you're running ahead of
[1:51:50] us I'm just waiting on them to catch up
[1:51:54] that's how the enemy works sometime and
[1:51:56] what the enemy does is he comes right in
[1:51:58] to cut you
[1:52:00] off so what's really happening is you're
[1:52:03] being separated from the
[1:52:06] vine are you calling the local church
[1:52:08] the Vine I tell you what the local
[1:52:11] church better be an extension of the
[1:52:14] vine or we're connected to the wrong
[1:52:17] thing our truest connection is to Christ
[1:52:21] he is the life of the Vine
[1:52:23] but God ordained a local
[1:52:27] assembly to keep us
[1:52:31] connected yes and the enemy he'll he'll
[1:52:33] cut you off and in an hour like that
[1:52:36] I've said this the Holy Ghost has said
[1:52:38] it I've said it prophecies have said it
[1:52:41] Visions have said it dreams have said it
[1:52:44] we have to in an hour like that we have
[1:52:47] to circle the
[1:52:50] wagons and we have to say enough is
[1:52:54] enough we are being separated from the
[1:52:57] world and we are being yolked to the
[1:53:02] word and there's no in

[1:53:15] impression of this message stay with us
[1:53:19] that's why I've asked you kindly to look

[1:53:23] eyes and I want to know if you're
[1:53:25] connected or not I know we come to get
[1:53:28] blessed but sometimes we come to get

[1:54:20] us to feel our respons responsibility at
[1:54:23] times he made sure the piano was
[1:54:27] covered I personally asked Kade to pray
[1:54:30] about staying with us this weekend

[1:54:35] blessing and uh to us and his gift
[1:54:38] particularly would be and he graciously
[1:54:41] cancelled his
[1:54:43] plans to be here I appreciate
[1:54:46] that had he not been able to do it had
[1:54:49] he not been willing to do it it we
[1:54:51] wouldn't have stopped

[1:55:56] wonderful I even question the Lord about
[1:55:59] some of this that I'm going to do this
[1:56:01] morning if I can get to it because I
[1:56:04] think others should hear it but I want
[1:56:07] you to know God
[1:56:08] knows I prayed this morning in my off
[1:56:11] God you know you knew before the
[1:56:14] foundation of the world who be in the
[1:56:17] house and who'd be
[1:56:20] streaming Jesus said uh what what was
[1:56:23] the other let's see the children of
[1:56:24] Israel they missed it the rest by two
[1:56:27] things one by getting under the
[1:56:29] influence and the spirit of an evil
[1:56:31] report number two Paul said in Hebrews
[1:56:35] that they
[1:56:37] failed to mix
[1:56:40] Faith with the word that was spoken to
[1:56:45] them somebody get that reference for me
[1:56:48] real quick he uh uh Hebrews
[1:56:52] is it four Hebrews chapter
[1:56:55] 4 or is it three four talks about the
[1:56:59] rest but where where is the verse that
[1:57:03] said they failed to enter into the rest
[1:57:05] because they did not mix the word the
[1:57:08] word they heard did not Prosper them
[1:57:11] because they did not mix it with faith
[1:57:12] can someone Google that search it or
[1:57:15] find it let's read that I I didn't plan
[1:57:17] to use it this morning but I I I feel to
[1:57:20] slow down a moment and and use
[1:57:25] this come on folks what does it
[1:57:35] say can can you pull that up for me Momo
[1:57:38] can you give me Hebrews There It Is For
[1:57:41] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[1:57:45] as unto them but the word preached did
[1:57:49] not profit them
[1:57:52] are you looking at it there it is not
[1:57:55] being mixed with faith in them that
[1:57:58] heard it because of that they failed to
[1:58:01] enter into the rest here's Jesus crying
[1:58:04] out in the gospels come unto
[1:58:07] me all ye that labor verse 28 Matthew 11
[1:58:12] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:58:15] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[1:58:21] upon you and
[1:58:26] learn learn of
[1:58:29] me any message that is sent from God
[1:58:34] must be a message that reveals Jesus
[1:58:39] Christ to us not a denominational
[1:58:45] Jesus the Jesus of the
[1:58:49] Bible come on not the one that turned
[1:58:52] his head at your
[1:58:54] sin but the one that gives you more
[1:58:57] grace when you need it the most he's not
[1:59:01] turning his head away from your sin or
[1:59:04] your unbelief he's just pouring more
[1:59:07] grace on you that's the Bible Jesus not
[1:59:11] the churchy Jesus not the denominational
[1:59:14] Jesus not the religious Jesus that's the
[1:59:17] Jesus of the Bible thank God he's been
[1:59:20] revealed to you thank God if he's been
[1:59:23] made known to you Jesus said take my
[1:59:26] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[1:59:31] meek and lowly in heart
[1:59:37] right in
[1:59:40] heart I want you to know he wasn't a
[1:59:46] he didn't twist his booty when he
[1:59:49] walked
[1:59:53] he wasn't limp
[1:59:55] wristed so if that's what you think meek
[1:59:58] and lowly is you don't know the Jesus of
[2:00:02] the
[2:00:03] Bible are you with me sir some people
[2:00:07] make Jesus looked like he was
[2:00:11] gay
[2:00:12] weak CZ he was meek and lowly the Bible
[2:00:16] said he was meek and lowly in heart
[2:00:22] his demeanor that moved from his heart
[2:00:26] to his behavior was one of
[2:00:29] meekness and
[2:00:31] mildness but when he
[2:00:34] discerned that the words of his father
[2:00:37] were being disregarded are you with are
[2:00:40] you with me are you looking at this way
[2:00:43] as ugly as it may
[2:00:45] be when he discerned that the words of
[2:00:49] his father were being casually NE
[2:00:52] neglected or intentionally uh defamed
[2:00:56] and
[2:00:57] defiled that Meek lowly sheep toen
[2:01:03] children toen
[2:01:06] Jesus he rose
[2:01:09] up and and he called the religious
[2:01:12] leaders
[2:01:15] snakes he did was he not meeking lowly
[2:01:19] in that moment he was in heart yeah
[2:01:22] yes sir he wanted the truth to be in the
[2:01:26] hearts of the people more than anything
[2:01:28] else so much so that he went to the
[2:01:30] Cross to get you that's what he
[2:01:34] had woo he loved you so much he wanted
[2:01:39] what was in
[2:01:40] him to be in us and he went all the way
[2:01:44] but I want you to know he wasn't a
[2:01:48] he wasn't everybody's buddy
[2:01:54] he wasn't one you know the you're the
[2:01:56] best you're the you're the
[2:02:01] most he he wasn't trying to be in the
[2:02:05] club or in the click thank you Jesus he
[2:02:09] had more Fellowship off with a
[2:02:13] handful he enjoyed that way more than he
[2:02:17] did with the crowd but he had to go to
[2:02:19] the crowd to minister the words of his
[2:02:21] father yes are you with me he said come
[2:02:24] unto me take my yoke let me lay a Yol on
[2:02:27] your
[2:02:29] shoulder that's not like the Yoke that
[2:02:31] you've carried with the world you've
[2:02:33] once been yolked with the world but now
[2:02:36] I'm separating you from the world and
[2:02:39] I'm offering you another
[2:02:42] yoke this yoke is not representing
[2:02:45] bondage this yoke is res is representing
[2:02:49] relationship
[2:02:53] you are a slave to me yes Christ but
[2:02:58] you're not one who wears a yoke of
[2:03:01] bondage you're you're what the Bible
[2:03:03] reveals to us is a love
[2:03:08] slave the Bible talks about slaves who
[2:03:12] had reached the end of their indentured
[2:03:15] agreement and were
[2:03:17] free and rather than to go off and enjoy
[2:03:21] their new found Freedom they
[2:03:23] chose to remain at the house of their
[2:03:27] master and serve
[2:03:29] him all of the days of their
[2:03:33] life and they would take their
[2:03:37] earlobe because what you do to your ear
[2:03:41] is represented in the from the natural
[2:03:44] to the
[2:03:49] spiritual they didn't go and get their
[2:03:51] ears picked
[2:03:52] piered so they could wear mud
[2:03:56] flaps like women do
[2:03:59] today but they would take their earlobe
[2:04:02] and lay it up against the door frame of
[2:04:05] the of the door and and the the owner
[2:04:09] would Bor
[2:04:10] it with an all what you use to punch
[2:04:15] leather and that man would now become a
[2:04:20] love slave he had been a slave uh being
[2:04:24] yolked up to slavery to to uh you know
[2:04:28] indentured
[2:04:29] lifestyle but now he liked his treatment
[2:04:33] so well he voluntarily said I don't ever
[2:04:37] want to leave this place so let me put
[2:04:40] my earlobe here and let you bore it with
[2:04:43] an all and I will forever remain in your
[2:04:49] servitude and in your service this is I
[2:04:52] don't know where you are this morning
[2:04:54] but I know where I am this is what we
[2:04:56] need more than anything else in all the
[2:04:58] world we need to make up our mind but
[2:05:01] once your earlobe got pierced through
[2:05:05] you didn't change your mind
[2:05:08] then it became a legal
[2:05:11] ordeal that was a sign that you'd never
[2:05:15] leave that you would stay married to
[2:05:18] your
[2:05:19] vow the rest of the days of your life I
[2:05:23] want you to know I've already had H I'm
[2:05:26] about to talk some more in tongues uh
[2:05:29] I've already laid my earlobe against the
[2:05:33] the house and I've already had it bored
[2:05:36] through with an awe and I have fully
[2:05:39] decided there is nothing out there that
[2:05:42] I'm attracted to there's nothing in this
[2:05:46] world that holds an attraction for me
[2:05:49] like my relationship ship with the one
[2:05:52] who meets me in the garden of my
[2:05:57] heart while the de is still on the Roses
[2:06:01] sir I am
[2:06:03] persuaded that many folks have never
[2:06:07] fallen in love with
[2:06:11] Jesus for years they have gone to church
[2:06:15] for years they have tried to do what is
[2:06:17] right but they've never entered into a
[2:06:20] love affair
[2:06:22] with
[2:06:23] him their praise their worship their
[2:06:26] talk even their amen sometime
[2:06:32] reflects their lack of
[2:06:36] relationship they amen more over what
[2:06:39] sounds like
[2:06:41] rules than they do
[2:06:45] intimacy you see there's a
[2:06:48] vow and we've got to be faithful to that
[2:06:51] vow right no doubt about it but some
[2:06:54] people are more comfortable by the
[2:06:56] structure of
[2:06:57] religion than they are laying at his
[2:07:04] feet and I want you to know
[2:07:06] something you know we we're we're not
[2:07:09] church church
[2:07:11] folks if you really believe you're a
[2:07:14] part of the bride of
[2:07:16] Christ then you are watching your steps
[2:07:24] there came a woman to brother BR I'm not
[2:07:26] even preaching my sermon yet maybe I
[2:07:28] have to save

[2:07:43] had I might be able
[2:07:46] to to find it if you if you just won't
[2:07:50] rush me

[2:08:14] I'm not
[2:08:16] mad I feel

[2:08:22] a little bit of an
[2:08:24] alarm I've got this strong sensation
[2:08:28] this strong feeling
[2:08:31] inside that you're wanting someone else
[2:08:34] to fight for you and you're not willing
[2:08:36] to fight for
[2:08:38] yourself and that's wrong

[2:14:57] days and the last hours of the days do
[2:14:59] you see him now in his word and it goes
[2:15:02] on I I I got so stirred Monday morning
[2:15:06] yes sir when I woke up because I woke up
[2:15:10] to a glimpse of what this woman
[2:15:14] saw it it was not a dream or a vision it
[2:15:17] was somewhere in between but the last
[2:15:20] thing I remember remember before my eyes
[2:15:22] popped open completely aware of my
[2:15:26] bedroom of my sound machine of my fan in
[2:15:31] my
[2:15:32] face of my wife beside me I caught a
[2:15:36] glimpse of what this little woman saw
[2:15:39] and I saw the uh some people it wasn't
[2:15:41] just women on now like the preview of
[2:15:45] the Bride but there were men and women
[2:15:49] and they were packing banners
[2:15:53] and they were marching forward up into
[2:15:57] the
[2:16:00] headship of zachariah's
[2:16:04] Prophecy that the Capstone The Headstone
[2:16:08] will
[2:16:09] come with shouts
[2:16:13] of Grace Grace because in
[2:16:16] 2024 if anybody ever needed Grace
[2:16:22] woo I
[2:16:24] do you do and we don't just need Grace
[2:16:28] folks we've had Grace ever since we
[2:16:30] knelt down and give our heart to the
[2:16:32] Lord we need Grace
[2:16:36] Grace we need a double portion of God's
[2:16:40] grace and favor hello Upon Our Lives not
[2:16:44] to entertain us but to help us move
[2:16:49] forward and upward
[2:16:51] into a place where
[2:16:53] Christ is our
[2:16:56] headship where you don't see or Pastor
[2:16:59] anymore but you see
[2:17:01] Christ where I don't see congregation
[2:17:04] anymore but I see
[2:17:06] Christ because we've moved up into the
[2:17:09] into a place where he is our headship he
[2:17:13] is our
[2:17:15] absolute he is the lover of our soul and
[2:17:20] nothing else satisfies us because we
[2:17:23] have been separated from the world like
[2:17:26] sheep set on the
[2:17:28] right and goats on the left and we have
[2:17:31] been
[2:17:32] yolked to a Christ who says come unto me
[2:17:38] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[2:17:40] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[2:17:43] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[2:17:46] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[2:17:49] rest
[2:17:51] why didn't they get to rest because they
[2:17:54] believe the evil report because they had
[2:17:56] the word they heard the word they
[2:17:58] listened to the
[2:18:00] word but they didn't apply the word
[2:18:03] that's right are you wantan me to help
[2:18:04] you here they spent more time on
[2:18:10] YouTube then they did
[2:18:12] feasting on the word of
[2:18:15] God they spent more time with the with
[2:18:18] the Fox News than they did with the word
[2:18:21] of
[2:18:22] God come on they spent more time with
[2:18:25] tunes on the
[2:18:27] radio now sports
[2:18:31] clips and hunting
[2:18:33] shows and all the things that capture
[2:18:37] our attention none of
[2:18:40] which even those of you who feed on the
[2:18:43] critics of brother brandham none of
[2:18:46] which I could say in and of themselves
[2:18:52] are
[2:18:53] evil sometimes they're
[2:18:57] necessary thank God for Google and you
[2:19:00] you
[2:19:02] YouTube I start say
[2:19:05] Yahoo because it's made
[2:19:08] mechanics out of Brothers who needed to
[2:19:12] fix their own car because sometimes they
[2:19:14] couldn't afford to get somebody else to
[2:19:16] do it so they Googled and youtubed it
[2:19:21] ordered their part and fixed their car I
[2:19:23] couldn't call everything they're evil
[2:19:26] but I want you to know if there's a
[2:19:28] church of people spending more time
[2:19:31] learning how to improve their golf
[2:19:36] game or how to throw their
[2:19:39] frisbee then they are feasting on the
[2:19:42] word it's no
[2:19:43] [Music]
[2:19:45] wonder they can't enter into rest now if
[2:19:49] you think I'm calling you as a Pastor to
[2:19:51] be a fanatic I'm not you've had your
[2:19:54] time in fanaticism you don't want to
[2:19:56] spend any more nights in fanaticism but
[2:20:00] what you do want to do is spend the rest
[2:20:02] of your life so
[2:20:05] wholeheartedly in love with Jesus Christ
[2:20:09] that he is your number one
[2:20:16] passion he means more to you than crossw
[2:20:18] word puzzle
[2:20:21] or word fine no no no no I have I have a
[2:20:27] Pastime I enjoy my family tree I enjoy
[2:20:32] that I'm not preaching against something
[2:20:35] that brings peace to your mind or causes
[2:20:38] you to rest and relax you need that
[2:20:42] we're living in a fast paced crazy Speed
[2:20:49] World sometime times you need to unplug
[2:20:53] sometimes my watch and my phone says hey
[2:20:57] you need to slow down and I'm not even
[2:21:01] moving your heart rate is accelerated
[2:21:05] and your stress levels are high and your
[2:21:08] health is going to be in Jeopardy if you
[2:21:11] spend more time in that place find
[2:21:14] something to do that will bring you rest
[2:21:18] that will bring you peace I'm telling
[2:21:19] that's pretty it's amazing amazing isn't
[2:21:21] it so we need that but it cannot be our
[2:21:25] reason for getting up in the
[2:21:28] morning you say well I have to work a
[2:21:30] job God bless you I know what that feels
[2:21:35] like I have one to work as well but what
[2:21:39] I do understand is if you realize you're
[2:21:43] not going forward or you're not going
[2:21:45] upward with the same urgency that the
[2:21:49] hour seems to to be
[2:21:51] demanding then you ought to dedicate a
[2:21:55] bigger portion of your
[2:21:58] life to his
[2:22:01] word some of you would that would look
[2:22:04] like uh listening to a sermon but I want
[2:22:08] to encourage
[2:22:09] you that in order to properly place the
[2:22:14] messages that God has given us you need
[2:22:18] the Bible you need the Bible you need
[2:22:24] the bi e you need the foundation of the
[2:22:30] scripture we need the foundation of the
[2:22:35] scripture we can't properly place the
[2:22:38] quotations if we don't understand the
[2:22:42] foundation of the Scripture A and for
[2:22:46] those Blowfish who believe that the
[2:22:49] message can stand by itself I totally
[2:22:53] reject that as heresy it is not what he
[2:22:58] preached it must lay upon the proven
[2:23:03] word of God it must fit it must line up
[2:23:09] it must Dove tail or you and I have
[2:23:18] misapplied this is an our to fall in
[2:23:21] love with your
[2:23:25] Bible I'd like to encourage people back
[2:23:28] to your old Leather
[2:23:29] Bible uh a paper Bible if that's what
[2:23:32] you have but if you don't get back to
[2:23:36] that get it on your
[2:23:40] phone get it on
[2:23:43] your your
[2:23:45] laptop get it on your iPad get it on
[2:23:48] your tablet
[2:23:51] get it on your CD
[2:23:53] player get it on on your on your
[2:23:57] iTunes get it wherever and whenever and
[2:24:00] if you've never experienced the joy of
[2:24:04] having someone read the Bible to you get
[2:24:07] it find it I grew up my grandmother had
[2:24:13] the Bible on real
[2:24:17] toore the first Bible that I ever
[2:24:21] heard uh read by
[2:24:24] scorby and later by CM Ward if anybody
[2:24:28] knew I actually met him and knew CM Ward
[2:24:31] if anyone knew these great
[2:24:33] voices they read the Bible my
[2:24:36] grandmother instilled a love for
[2:24:38] listening to the Bible on a real toore
[2:24:41] then a
[2:24:42] cassette she made sure every one of her
[2:24:45] children had the whole Bible on cassette
[2:24:49] she made sure that every one of children
[2:24:51] had the whole B grandchildren had the
[2:24:53] Bible on cassette then
[2:24:57] CD and now you don't need neither you
[2:25:01] can stream
[2:25:02] them what good does it do to hear the
[2:25:06] word of God oh I'm not getting a whole
[2:25:08] lot of help this
[2:25:10] morning it's a little late
[2:25:13] now but it's nothing but the truth if
[2:25:17] you don't understand the scripture you
[2:25:19] will
[2:25:21] misapply the sermon that your pastor
[2:25:23] preaches you will misapply the message
[2:25:27] that you hear from Brother brandom you
[2:25:29] will misapply it if you don't know the
[2:25:33] book if you don't know the
[2:25:38] Bible I agree when they say we
[2:25:41] understand the Bible more and better and
[2:25:44] more clearly and it's a new book because
[2:25:48] we have the message I AG agree with that
[2:25:53] 1,000% and you know what you may not
[2:25:56] agree with it but you have been feeding
[2:25:58] on it here some of you for 30
[2:26:02] years some of you 20 some of you 10 and
[2:26:06] what I've tried to give you is the
[2:26:09] foundation of the scripture with the
[2:26:12] message of the hour stacked on top
[2:26:14] because that's what caused me to see
[2:26:18] that Jesus was not historical figure
[2:26:21] like George Washington but he was a
[2:26:24] living
[2:26:27] reality and he not only wanted to do
[2:26:29] what he did in the Bible but he wanted
[2:26:32] to continue to do what he
[2:26:35] does in seven Church Messengers and
[2:26:40] now in a thundering
[2:26:43] bride here what I'm telling you a
[2:26:46] thundering
[2:26:49] bride when I woke up Monday morning and
[2:26:52] the last thing I saw was people marching
[2:26:55] with
[2:26:56] banners men and
[2:26:59] women they were Godly let me remind you
[2:27:02] that they were Godly on the outside
[2:27:05] because what you are on the inside will
[2:27:08] reflect on the outside whether you want
[2:27:11] it to or not the way you fix your hair
[2:27:15] as a woman will reflect what's going on
[2:27:19] come on now in your life at the moment
[2:27:23] sir sir I look folks you know sometimes
[2:27:27] the way you twist your mouth and face
[2:27:29] and look at me when I'm preaching you
[2:27:31] would think that you think and maybe you
[2:27:33] do that I don't have a clue what I'm
[2:27:36] talking about but I have watched women
[2:27:39] under a wrong Spirit literally change
[2:27:42] the side that they put their ponytail on
[2:27:46] and discerned in the spirit that that
[2:27:50] not every time I think it's amazing when
[2:27:52] folks can do something sisters can do
[2:27:55] something with their hair and I think
[2:27:56] it's amazing when they can do different
[2:27:58] things with their hair but through the
[2:28:01] years oh it's
[2:28:03] quiet I have even discerned at times
[2:28:06] that women would do things like that
[2:28:09] because they were fighting something
[2:28:11] they were under some kind of a spirit
[2:28:14] and they didn't even realize what it was
[2:28:16] doing and how it was affecting them on
[2:28:18] the outside but they dress es were
[2:28:20] getting
[2:28:23] tighter not because they were eating
[2:28:26] more chocolate
[2:28:29] pie but because they were choosing them
[2:28:32] that
[2:28:34] way and I noticed that they were
[2:28:37] twisting a little more than they used to
[2:28:43] twist like I told these young girls at
[2:28:46] message you know that family that was
[2:28:47] visiting here you that are awake that
[2:28:50] family that was visiting here a few
[2:28:52] weeks ago uh I didn't know but the
[2:28:54] little wife who married the English
[2:28:56] husband the wife was in those youth
[2:28:58] camps at byc in the early 90s when I was
[2:29:01] preaching there and she told me are you
[2:29:02] the brother Shelly it's been so yes I I
[2:29:06] was and she remembered my suspenders and
[2:29:09] and she said where are your suspender I
[2:29:11] said well I got married and my wife said
[2:29:13] the suspenders are a no
[2:29:16] no I'm not married to a grandpa yet
[2:29:21] now she is can I have them now can I
[2:29:23] wear them now I'm a I'm a Pap Pap now
[2:29:26] can I have them but the sister said but
[2:29:28] I remembered they matched your
[2:29:34] tie and I would preach to those young
[2:29:37] girls back in the early 90s that you can
[2:29:40] wear
[2:29:41] flats and twist your
[2:29:45] hips to try to catch somebody's
[2:29:48] attention
[2:29:51] so that proves to me it's not just the
[2:29:53] the height of your
[2:29:57] heel sometimes it's a spirit that wants
[2:29:59] to get on you that's right to draw
[2:30:01] someone's attention from something that
[2:30:03] it ought to be on come on so you you and
[2:30:06] I have to understand that we're in a
[2:30:09] Warfare constant
[2:30:11] Warfare and what we what we are
[2:30:14] experiencing we we bring that with us
[2:30:17] when we come together in jesus' name and
[2:30:20] we want to know that there's a way to to
[2:30:23] rid ourselves of the
[2:30:25] Slime before we get in his presence if
[2:30:29] possible and there's one way I know
[2:30:31] that's better than any other way and
[2:30:33] that is bring yourself under the
[2:30:36] authority of the Bible bring yourself
[2:30:40] under the influence of the Bible the
[2:30:43] scripture let this book talk to you if
[2:30:48] you're hung up in the gats
[2:30:53] skip you can come back to it you don't
[2:30:57] have to read listen well I've got a
[2:30:59] reading plan how's that working for you
[2:31:02] for some people it doesn't work very
[2:31:04] well so Find Your
[2:31:06] Way some people open it up read
[2:31:09] something flip it over read something
[2:31:11] else
[2:31:12] fine but do
[2:31:14] it let your children see
[2:31:18] you that's why I said because I I don't
[2:31:21] often use my Bible Bible at home I I use
[2:31:24] it on my computer my phone but let your
[2:31:26] family know not to boast or bra but let
[2:31:28] them know that's right I'm not always on
[2:31:32] Facebook I'm not always doing my family
[2:31:35] tree sometime I'm under the influence
[2:31:39] and the authority of that word because
[2:31:42] I'm recognizing the importance of being
[2:31:45] separated from the world like sheep on
[2:31:48] one side and goats on another and I'm
[2:31:51] recognizing The Importance of Being
[2:31:55] yolked but not to a
[2:31:58] habit which includes overeating for
[2:32:02] me but whatever whatever you have been
[2:32:07] yolked to in the past may God give you a
[2:32:10] spiritual
[2:32:11] divorce may you rise up with strength
[2:32:15] beyond your human understanding and and
[2:32:18] marry your s to that word well brother
[2:32:22] it's dry it's dry to me because I'm in a
[2:32:24] rough place and it's dry to me I didn't
[2:32:27] say it will always be pleasant I didn't
[2:32:30] say you'll always read and want to run
[2:32:32] around the room I didn't say it'll
[2:32:34] always feed your soul like Mana from on
[2:32:37] high I just told you to get under the
[2:32:42] influence of that word and let that word
[2:32:45] talk to you because the word itself
[2:32:48] reveals Jesus to us again then we take
[2:32:51] on top of that the message of the hour
[2:32:54] and he reveals to us that Jesus is not
[2:32:57] just a
[2:32:58] figure but a living
[2:33:01] reality my testimony about hearing
[2:33:03] brother Brandon was that he raised Jesus
[2:33:06] from the pages of history and stood him
[2:33:09] on the
[2:33:10] platform and made him a living reality
[2:33:13] to a generation of people who came
[2:33:15] around 2,000 years after the
[2:33:18] Christ and it's what I want to do and I
[2:33:21] know I can't do that I can't raise Jesus
[2:33:24] up out of the book and stand him here on
[2:33:27] this platform unless I am under the
[2:33:32] influence so I'm not trying to put
[2:33:34] anything on on you that I'm not willing
[2:33:38] to wear
[2:33:39] myself God is calling us to that higher
[2:33:43] walk uh we're coming up to to to his
[2:33:47] headship
[2:33:52] I'm swimming against the tide of
[2:33:55] preachers who are telling their
[2:33:57] congregations around this message every
[2:34:00] weekend we're there we're past that
[2:34:03] we're finished with this prayer lines
[2:34:06] are no longer needed tongues are no
[2:34:09] longer needed things like this are no
[2:34:11] longer needed so I'm swimming against
[2:34:13] that
[2:34:15] Tide while trying to keep a
[2:34:18] balance I tell you what I'm not
[2:34:20] interested in I'm not interested in just
[2:34:24] a little
[2:34:25] jerking and a little moving around and a
[2:34:29] little
[2:34:30] squealing I'm not interested in just
[2:34:32] physical
[2:34:34] manifestation I love that oh just leave
[2:34:38] me in that I'm a happy man but in the
[2:34:41] end it's more it's going to take more
[2:34:44] than chill bumps it's going to take more
[2:34:47] than the hair standing up on our arms
[2:34:50] and legs it's going to take a
[2:34:53] transformation it's going to take coming
[2:34:56] up into the headship of Jesus Christ
[2:35:00] where we quit making our own
[2:35:12] decisions and we let him be our decision
[2:35:15] maker Jesus said I don't are you with me
[2:35:19] I've let you off the hook some of you
[2:35:21] haven't glanced this way in 10
[2:35:27] minutes I I I'm feeling that upward pull
[2:35:32] I'm going I want to tell you something
[2:35:34] I'm
[2:35:35] going you hear me I'm
[2:35:39] going I'm going I'm going to yield my
[2:35:43] life to that upward pull I'm going to
[2:35:47] lay at his
[2:35:48] feet I'm I'm going to love him more in
[2:35:52] the in the closing hours of my life than
[2:35:55] I have ever loved him before I have to I
[2:35:59] have
[2:36:00] to church is not
[2:36:04] enough it's not enough some people use
[2:36:08] that as their excuse to stay home shame
[2:36:11] on
[2:36:13] you shame on
[2:36:15] you for using that as your excuse
[2:36:20] but it's not
[2:36:22] enough if you were at home laying with
[2:36:25] the Lord then surely you would we would
[2:36:29] be able to
[2:36:30] know because you'd walk
[2:36:34] different when you show
[2:36:38] up I want you to know those who are
[2:36:40] under different burdens and are not able
[2:36:42] to always be here you need to know that
[2:36:45] some of those folks don't
[2:36:48] depend on Church
[2:36:52] alone right they have developed a
[2:36:56] relationship with Jesus Christ that
[2:36:59] sustains every day every day he's good
[2:37:03] every day I want to hear somebody say
[2:37:06] he's good every day he's good all the
[2:37:10] time all the
[2:37:12] time all the time he's good he's good
[2:37:19] he's
[2:37:21] good page one is
[2:37:26] finished I want to bring this to a close
[2:37:30] for
[2:37:31] now I am not going to feel
[2:37:35] guilty
[2:37:36] for
[2:37:38] my
[2:37:40] tone or my
[2:37:42] demeanor I'm not don't ask me to don't
[2:37:46] expect me to I Wrestled for this one
[2:37:50] this one cost me something and I'm going
[2:37:53] to deliver it with
[2:37:55] boldness I hope I have if I hadn't I'm
[2:37:58] going to re regain my boldness now and
[2:38:02] move forward to finish because if I'm
[2:38:04] letting it slip I don't want to do that
[2:38:06] I want to deliver this with a little bit
[2:38:08] of the passion I I want you to be able
[2:38:11] to apprehend this the way it apprehended
[2:38:15] me the way it Arrested
[2:38:18] me I got up Monday and I went into the
[2:38:21] den like I normally do I opened up my
[2:38:23] laptop and I be to
[2:38:26] dig for what I had seen and I
[2:38:30] remembered that it that brother brandom
[2:38:32] had described this
[2:38:34] scene but I couldn't remember the
[2:38:37] details if it was his experience or he
[2:38:40] was telling someone else's but but I
[2:38:43] found it and I found some other things
[2:38:45] and one thing led to another and God
[2:38:46] just started talking to my heart
[2:38:51] when brother brandham was talking
[2:38:55] to close
[2:38:58] Brethren about the Fulfillment of the
[2:39:01] tent Vision that we have mentioned to
[2:39:04] you occasionally through the
[2:39:07] years he was sitting at a
[2:39:10] table with brother Arnon
[2:39:14] West I was listening to a tape this week
[2:39:18] and I heard brother brother brandham
[2:39:20] call out to brother West brother Arnon
[2:39:23] West named after the river in the Bible
[2:39:26] brother Benny West's father and he would
[2:39:31] sometimes say I can't remember if you're
[2:39:32] from Georgia or Alabama and that is
[2:39:35] because when he first started uh
[2:39:39] following they were Alabama they were
[2:39:41] Georgians but but then they moved to the
[2:39:44] Huntsville area and they were alabamians
[2:39:46] so I was I heard brother brandom calling
[2:39:49] out to brother Arnon not remembering
[2:39:52] where he was from exactly when they had
[2:39:54] a meal with him on one
[2:39:57] occasion he took a
[2:40:00] napkin and he drew out a
[2:40:05] drawing and he said uh this
[2:40:11] is
[2:40:13] relevant to my tent vision
[2:40:19] our brother
[2:40:21] West saw the
[2:40:25] napkin thought maybe even he had
[2:40:29] it from his
[2:40:32] dad I don't think I ever saw it or or a
[2:40:35] copy of
[2:40:37] it it looked not like tent
[2:40:42] poles it looked like telephone
[2:40:46] poles and they were not connected
[2:40:50] together by
[2:40:52] canvas they were connected together by
[2:40:55] by line by
[2:40:58] wire
[2:41:00] making them
[2:41:02] wonder if it had something to do with
[2:41:05] the telephone
[2:41:07] hookup because in that day brother Perry
[2:41:11] green had
[2:41:14] discovered that there was a way to
[2:41:17] connect people to the services
[2:41:20] that they couldn't travel to and so
[2:41:24] throughout
[2:41:27] 65 there were preparations made in each
[2:41:31] City to set this thing up can you
[2:41:34] imagine in '
[2:41:36] 65 the technology was small there were
[2:41:39] people still on community lines what did
[2:41:42] you call party lines in 65 can you
[2:41:46] imagine waiting on your turn to use the
[2:41:47] phone you pick it up and you hear am I
[2:41:49] preaching on it I can't imagine how they
[2:41:52] pulled it off but brother green went to
[2:41:55] these cities and he made these
[2:41:57] arrangements for this tent for this
[2:42:00] telephone hookup to go out so that the
[2:42:03] services could be carried people would
[2:42:05] meet in their homes and even in churches
[2:42:07] with telephone lines and would hear what
[2:42:10] a wonderful thing back then before there
[2:42:13] was a television camera you you know
[2:42:16] operating and before there was was so
[2:42:18] many things that we have
[2:42:20] today but the last thing that he said to
[2:42:24] brother Arnon about this tent vision is
[2:42:27] that there was a significant
[2:42:32] connection between
[2:42:35] Alabama and that tent
[2:42:40] Vision I've never forgot
[2:42:43] that as I sat there so
[2:42:47] stirred by what I had experience waking
[2:42:50] up as I read
[2:42:53] this as I remembered this Alabama
[2:42:58] connection a little bride marching forth
[2:43:01] and from all kinds of places I'm not
[2:43:04] trying to say anything like exclusivity
[2:43:07] no no
[2:43:09] no but of all the
[2:43:13] places could have been Virgin Islands
[2:43:16] could have been Haiti could have been
[2:43:21] could have been Missouri could have been
[2:43:25] California I
[2:43:28] love the fact that Georgia and
[2:43:31] Alabama made it to the what
[2:43:38] banners Victory
[2:43:40] banners that they were
[2:43:45] waving brother brandham tells us that
[2:43:48] Christ is coming back with Victory
[2:43:53] banners
[2:43:55] waving powerful it's just another way of
[2:43:58] saying I got the victory
[2:44:01] woo I don't need a flag I got
[2:44:06] flags here I wave mine before the Lord
[2:44:11] because I have found out I don't have to
[2:44:13] I don't have to do it here and feel him
[2:44:16] only
[2:44:18] here I discovered something many years
[2:44:21] ago I don't know if it works for
[2:44:24] everybody so I won't say that it
[2:44:27] does but somewhere in my
[2:44:30] journey I discovered that even if I'm
[2:44:34] just
[2:44:37] almost not
[2:44:39] serious I don't want to say
[2:44:42] jesting but I want to say very casually
[2:44:47] without intention lifting my
[2:44:52] handso I discovered years ago maybe it
[2:44:56] doesn't work for anybody but me maybe
[2:44:58] I'm the only one well that'd be
[2:45:02] great put that on my tombstone he was
[2:45:04] the only
[2:45:05] one but I discovered sometime many years
[2:45:08] ago that when I lift my hands like that
[2:45:11] he comes to
[2:45:15] me my little old granny she said honey
[2:45:18] when you don't feel like nobody loves
[2:45:20] you he said you just go in the in the
[2:45:24] bathroom or or turn on the light look in
[2:45:26] the
[2:45:27] mirror and you just say into that mirror
[2:45:31] Jesus I love
[2:45:33] you
[2:45:35] Jesus I love
[2:45:37] you Jesus I love you she said I'm not
[2:45:40] going to tell you you'll see
[2:45:42] him you may not even always hear him but
[2:45:47] she said I promise you you'll Fe feel
[2:45:49] him telling you
[2:45:51] back maybe not the first few times but
[2:45:54] it's some you'll feel him telling you
[2:45:56] back and I love you my granny taught me
[2:46:00] that as a child somewhere along the way
[2:46:02] I learned that even if I was just
[2:46:04] carrying on and somebody would say
[2:46:06] something like dinner's
[2:46:08] ready I know you can't imagine me
[2:46:10] getting excited about
[2:46:12] dinner but I would say oh praise the
[2:46:16] Lord
[2:46:19] I really wasn't particularly thanking
[2:46:22] God at the moment for dinner it just
[2:46:25] become an extension of of of me but I
[2:46:29] discovered that when I did
[2:46:31] that if I paused a moment if I waited a
[2:46:34] moment if I became aware of what I was
[2:46:37] doing he
[2:46:39] came he
[2:46:41] came can you imagine that that he knows
[2:46:45] hand
[2:46:46] signals can you imagine that he is so in
[2:46:50] love with
[2:46:52] you that he will take god of the
[2:46:56] universe will take
[2:46:59] attention from
[2:47:01] you however he can get it
[2:47:05] yes he so longs to have fellowship with
[2:47:09] you that even when you're thanking God
[2:47:11] for
[2:47:14] biscuit he said I'll take that
[2:47:17] praise folks
[2:47:19] that doesn't sound like a god who wants
[2:47:21] you to
[2:47:23] lose that sounds like a god who's
[2:47:25] determined I know I
[2:47:28] know eliana's on my
[2:47:31] watch see she's telling me
[2:47:35] see she's telling me it's
[2:47:40] 142 let me read this one just
[2:47:45] one The Shepherd of the Sheepfold
[2:47:50] paragraph 56 the day is far
[2:47:53] spent and you're going to gather the
[2:47:56] sheep and separate them from the mules
[2:47:59] from the camels from the goats hear this
[2:48:03] well and from the other
[2:48:07] animals that eat in the same
[2:48:13] pasture from the same
[2:48:17] word from the same
[2:48:21] Bible out of the same
[2:48:24] book out of the same building called
[2:48:28] Church do does anybody get the
[2:48:31] importance of that
[2:48:33] statement we're not all sheep over here
[2:48:37] eating the
[2:48:40] word there may be a goat there may be a
[2:48:44] mule that this goes out let me tell you
[2:48:47] something
[2:48:48] there are people out there that watch
[2:48:50] these services to find something else to
[2:48:53] spread about
[2:48:56] us to me you're just a mule trying to
[2:48:59] eat
[2:49:00] grass you didn't you didn't tune in to
[2:49:04] feed or to feast or think that we
[2:49:07] strange ones could possibly encourage
[2:49:09] you on your
[2:49:12] journey you you came to
[2:49:15] mock but there's coming a day
[2:49:19] there's coming an hour when we're going
[2:49:21] to discover that some of us have sat in
[2:49:27] church service after service eating
[2:49:31] grass and we're going to find out that
[2:49:34] we were we were
[2:49:38] goats there there's a separation
[2:49:42] coming and there are three kinds of
[2:49:45] Believers as much as it Grieves me in
[2:49:48] every
[2:49:50] Church
[2:49:51] Believers make Believers and
[2:49:55] unbelievers I I I want to I I want to be
[2:49:58] the real deal don't you then I've got to
[2:50:02] bring myself under the influence of the
[2:50:06] scripture now he said from the other
[2:50:08] animals that eat the same pasture from
[2:50:10] the same word from the same Bible out of
[2:50:12] the same book out of the same building
[2:50:14] culture but just the Sheep listen
[2:50:17] listen you who complain about the number
[2:50:19] of quotes you you who complain about the
[2:50:22] length of the service you complain
[2:50:26] folks you don't do that when you're
[2:50:29] sitting in front of
[2:50:35] YouTube you you don't do that when
[2:50:37] you're when you're sliding down the
[2:50:39] slippery slope of
[2:50:41] [Music]
[2:50:44] telegraph you don't do that when you're
[2:50:46] connecting
[2:50:49] Snapchatting
[2:50:52] and doing some of the things that people
[2:50:55] do and can do for hours and never even
[2:50:58] change their position never even go to
[2:51:01] the bathroom you can sit some of you
[2:51:03] kids can sit and watch a movie or a
[2:51:06] video that's two and a half three hours
[2:51:09] long and never go to the
[2:51:11] potty but you come to church and you go
[2:51:14] four
[2:51:15] times in one sermon
[2:51:20] wow it's not a bladder problem it's not
[2:51:23] a stomach problem then it's a matter of
[2:51:26] wanting to get out to get to escape to
[2:51:29] have a break and what I don't understand
[2:51:33] is why we can give our attention and
[2:51:36] affection to everything else but
[2:51:42] Grumble if somebody comes with more
[2:51:45] listen i' I've come today and I don't
[2:51:47] talk like this
[2:51:49] often enough but I came today not just
[2:51:53] with scriptures and quotes I came with a
[2:51:58] message I don't need you now to say
[2:52:01] anything I came with a message and it
[2:52:04] was from the Lord and you'll have to
[2:52:07] discern you'll have to pray you'll have
[2:52:11] to judge if it was from him or not for
[2:52:15] you but I came knowing
[2:52:19] a and I don't know how long I'll be on
[2:52:21] this but I came knowing that for me it's
[2:52:25] life or death to get this off of me I
[2:52:27] don't want it on me I want it off of
[2:52:31] me I kept hearing multitudes multitudes
[2:52:37] in the valley of
[2:52:40] decision I heard the scripture the Lord
[2:52:44] saying repeating the verse of scripture
[2:52:47] where where the the servant of Moses
[2:52:51] said choose you this
[2:52:57] day whom you will
[2:52:59] serve it's the
[2:53:02] world or the
[2:53:05] word and if you choose the word it's a
[2:53:10] relationship that you have to cultivate
[2:53:12] that's right sir it's not one that you
[2:53:15] can lay down and pick up and lay down
[2:53:17] and pick up and lay down and pick
[2:53:21] up for some of you you come in here and
[2:53:25] you get under the inspiration of the
[2:53:27] anointing of the holy spirit that I have
[2:53:30] prayed
[2:53:32] down and
[2:53:34] others I know that's bold I know that
[2:53:37] sounds pretty but it's a
[2:53:40] truth because people come with all kinds
[2:53:44] of stuff and you expect it to always be
[2:53:48] just what you need it to be and some
[2:53:52] people never even squeeze a little
[2:53:55] prayer that says God would you show up
[2:53:59] today would you meet us today would you
[2:54:03] help us today would you help our pastor
[2:54:07] would you help our preacher would you
[2:54:10] help our song
[2:54:14] leader so really we if you're one of
[2:54:17] those you can't complain about
[2:54:21] anything if you can't take your bones
[2:54:24] down to the voting booth and
[2:54:26] vote you don't have any right to
[2:54:30] criticize the president you have now or
[2:54:33] the one you'll get next I feel the same
[2:54:36] way about the
[2:54:41] service he came today and don't you
[2:54:44] think that for one minute I think that
[2:54:47] it was only because of me if you read
[2:54:50] that into what I said you are so wrong
[2:54:53] but I want you to know that I know and
[2:54:56] you know that if we were depending on
[2:54:59] some of
[2:55:03] you to bless the service on with a
[2:55:07] casual prayer or thought we'd be waiting
[2:55:10] right on out into eternity because we
[2:55:13] take for granted what we
[2:55:16] have until we we go off somewhere else
[2:55:20] and most of us can
[2:55:22] see that in our deadest
[2:55:26] moment most distracted service it's so
[2:55:30] much better than what a lot of people
[2:55:33] have Sunday after Sunday after you don't
[2:55:37] have to say anything
[2:55:38] now we really appreciate it when we
[2:55:40] don't have it but we're humans and when
[2:55:43] we have it all the time sometimes it
[2:55:45] doesn't mean near the same to us but I'm
[2:55:48] telling you we're as we get into this
[2:55:51] final thing that God is going to do he
[2:55:53] is doing he's beginning to do he's
[2:55:56] moving us forward into his
[2:56:00] headship but I got problems but I got
[2:56:02] lost children but I got bills up you
[2:56:05] don't understand seek ye first it's the
[2:56:11] book it's the
[2:56:13] [Music]
[2:56:14] key seek you first the kingdom of God
[2:56:19] God and all of his
[2:56:22] righteousness and all these things shall
[2:56:24] be added unto you I can
[2:56:27] testify others in this house can testify
[2:56:31] if you will focus on the
[2:56:33] kingdom God will get a hold of your
[2:56:36] children God will help their bodies God
[2:56:38] will help the job God come on seek you
[2:56:43] first oh my I'm closing I'm going to
[2:56:47] give the devil one more black eye
[2:56:50] musicians are coming to help us
[2:56:55] close God's word calls this is a message
[2:56:58] called God's word calls for total
[2:57:00] separation from
[2:57:05] unbelief Jesus has
[2:57:08] constantly told us there is a separation
[2:57:19] and we find you musicians I want you to
[2:57:22] listen when you're up here because I may
[2:57:24] take another minute than I
[2:57:28] thought Jesus has constantly told us
[2:57:31] that there is a
[2:57:33] separation and we find that the last
[2:57:36] thing that's predicted to the human race
[2:57:39] before the great final day when we
[2:57:41] Ascend into the presence of the Lord
[2:57:44] there will be a final separation he will
[2:57:48] separate the sheep from the goats and I
[2:57:51] want to be honest with you I believe
[2:57:52] this is a barn full of
[2:57:55] sheep I'm I do I believe you're
[2:57:58] sheep I I don't want you to leave this
[2:58:01] place thinking you know he was just
[2:58:03] calling me a goat because I don't amen
[2:58:05] everything he says nothing could be
[2:58:07] farther from the truth if I was
[2:58:10] depending on everybody's
[2:58:15] amen I know I'll only get it from some
[2:58:18] of you when you're in a good
[2:58:20] mood so that's not the one that keeps me
[2:58:23] going the one that keeps me going is
[2:58:26] from the person who who who who has
[2:58:28] every reason to be
[2:58:31] sour but they're aimen in
[2:58:33] anyhow because they're hoping that
[2:58:35] somewhere faith will kick
[2:58:42] in there will be a final separation he
[2:58:44] will separate the sheep from the goats
[2:58:49] let's go
[2:58:50] on God will continually has been
[2:58:54] separating separating and that's what
[2:58:56] he's doing tonight he said that's what
[2:58:58] he always does you can see it in every
[2:59:01] meeting he separates
[2:59:04] Faith from unbelief that's what we want
[2:59:08] the word to do in our own
[2:59:10] Hearts he speaks out he declares himself
[2:59:14] to those who will believe him and have
[2:59:16] faith in him
[2:59:18] now we find out in numbers I didn't want
[2:59:21] to leave without getting to this little
[2:59:23] part
[2:59:24] here is if it's been quiet maybe it'll
[2:59:27] be frigidly silent
[2:59:30] now now we find out in numbers the 6th
[2:59:33] chapter that a nazarites
[2:59:37] call now
[2:59:39] now you know what a Nazarite is not a
[2:59:44] Nazarene some people say Jesus was a
[2:59:47] Nazarite he was a
[2:59:50] Nazarene he was from Nazareth he may
[2:59:53] have taken at some point in his life a
[2:59:56] Nazarite
[2:59:58] vow but he wasn't a Nazarite he was a
[3:00:01] Nazarene and they're not the same thing
[3:00:04] a Nazarite call was to separate
[3:00:07] themselves from all the world to the
[3:00:10] word of God so there we are separating
[3:00:13] from the
[3:00:14] world and being
[3:00:16] yoked joined to the word of God he said
[3:00:21] that is a azerite call
[3:00:24] separated we find out that Samson was a
[3:00:29] Nazarite unto the
[3:00:31] Lord now we know by scripture that
[3:00:35] Samson's Nazarite vow was
[3:00:38] unlike many of those who took a Nazarite
[3:00:42] vow many who took a Nazarite vow in the
[3:00:44] scripture there was a beginning and an
[3:00:46] ending there was an Iration it was for a
[3:00:50] specific period of time but Samson was
[3:00:54] to be under the vow of a Nazarite for
[3:00:57] his entire
[3:01:00] life like
[3:01:04] you and this sign was that he was to
[3:01:07] wear his hair long with Seven
[3:01:11] Locks now we know that's not a new
[3:01:13] testament call because the New Testament
[3:01:15] tells us that we know it's a shame shame
[3:01:18] for a man to have long hair but in under
[3:01:21] this old Covenant that's how a man
[3:01:24] distinguished
[3:01:25] himself as having been under a vow or a
[3:01:29] contract of Nazarite his hair was to
[3:01:32] grow out without scissors and it was
[3:01:35] divided as Samson's was for sure into
[3:01:39] Seven Locks it was a sign of Separation
[3:01:42] that he was called
[3:01:47] for
[3:01:53] a is it
[3:01:56] spinning that he was called for a
[3:01:59] purpose you missed the last word that he
[3:02:02] was called for a purpose now can you
[3:02:07] flash the definition up there real quick
[3:02:09] of a Nazarite did you did you do that
[3:02:11] one for me honey
[3:02:13] Nazarite an
[3:02:15] Israelite consecrated to the service of
[3:02:18] God under vows to abstain from alcohol
[3:02:24] look a Nazarite like Samson couldn't
[3:02:27] even go Among The
[3:02:30] Grapes not only could he not partake in
[3:02:33] alcohol he couldn't even go into the
[3:02:35] vineyard he couldn't even eat
[3:02:41] raisins I talk about God saying you want
[3:02:44] to make sure you
[3:02:46] don't he didn't eat grap drink grape
[3:02:50] juice he didn't certainly drink wine he
[3:02:52] couldn't go in the in the Groves the the
[3:02:57] uh Vineyards thank
[3:03:00] you or eat dried grapes which was very
[3:03:05] sustaining food
[3:03:06] dried uh dates and dried grapes were
[3:03:11] were were
[3:03:12] Staples but he had to he had to stay
[3:03:15] away from all that uh uh he was to let
[3:03:18] his hair
[3:03:19] grow and he could
[3:03:22] not have contact you can read at number
[3:03:26] six with the
[3:03:28] dead and that included unless a special
[3:03:32] release was granted it meant even his
[3:03:37] parents if even his parents died if he
[3:03:41] was under that vow and not granted some
[3:03:44] special
[3:03:45] release he could not bury the dead he
[3:03:48] could not go to the funeral he could not
[3:03:50] go into the house where a corpse was
[3:03:52] laid out now that's a pretty serious
[3:03:55] vow and if you think that Jesus is not
[3:03:58] kind of for some of that he says in the
[3:04:01] New Testament Let the dead bury the
[3:04:05] dead you tend to them you love them you
[3:04:08] nurture them you minister to them while
[3:04:10] they're
[3:04:12] alive basically helps us to know it's
[3:04:15] it's not of a great value you can do do
[3:04:17] it if you have to to to to help your
[3:04:19] grieving process but it's not of a great
[3:04:21] value to go sit out in the cemetery and
[3:04:23] talk to the tombstone I'm just being
[3:04:25] honest it helps some people but don't
[3:04:28] don't start depending on
[3:04:31] that when they leave here they're
[3:04:33] they're out of here they they love you
[3:04:36] oh but they don't want to come back
[3:04:39] hello so nazari he had to make did do
[3:04:42] you know he had to go to the other side
[3:04:44] did you know that's why Samson was in a
[3:04:46] little bit of trouble there
[3:04:48] he should not have come near to the
[3:04:50] carcass of the lion that he killed
[3:04:52] probably not even killed the
[3:04:53] lion but God said Samson I'm with you
[3:04:57] it's not in the keeping of the rule it's
[3:04:59] in your
[3:05:00] obedience I want to bless you and so he
[3:05:03] sent a
[3:05:05] beehive didn't he you know the story and
[3:05:09] and gave
[3:05:10] honey and Samson said I'll take it to my
[3:05:13] mom and daddy because I've caused them
[3:05:15] enough heartache I might as well give
[3:05:17] them a bucket of honey uh uh as some
[3:05:20] little bit of reward are you still with
[3:05:22] me I'm going to close with this I really
[3:05:25] am I really
[3:05:27] am same sermon God's word calls for
[3:05:30] total unbelief I got to I got to get
[3:05:32] this off this was one of the things I
[3:05:34] have to get off of me and we're done but
[3:05:37] I think today when we see our sisters
[3:05:40] wearing long hair as the Bible said they
[3:05:42] should it does say that 1 Corinthians
[3:05:45] chap 11 a woman's long hair is given her
[3:05:48] for a
[3:05:49] covering it's clear very
[3:05:54] clear wearing long hair as the Bible
[3:05:57] said they should I think it's a Nazarite
[3:05:59] sign this is Brother brandom's
[3:06:01] understanding it's kind of how he
[3:06:03] interpreted this and and and I put my
[3:06:05] amens and Hallelujah right in there with
[3:06:08] him I think it's a nice way of typing
[3:06:11] the separated life it's a type he said I
[3:06:15] think it's a Nazarite sign that they
[3:06:17] want to of the Lord and I know it sounds
[3:06:22] flat what year was this 64 can you
[3:06:26] imagine the modern Pentecostal World
[3:06:29] Phoenix Arizona
[3:06:32] 1964 he says this he said and I know
[3:06:34] that sounds flat I want it to go home I
[3:06:39] want this message to be heard he's
[3:06:40] saying see because it
[3:06:43] is it looks like somebody is trying to
[3:06:46] do to keep something that God told them
[3:06:50] to do he did in the word he did thank
[3:06:55] you for your amen no matter what the
[3:06:58] price what the world has to say about it
[3:07:01] out there or how many scornful laughter
[3:07:06] critics that doesn't bother a person
[3:07:08] that's totally separated from the things
[3:07:11] of the world to the things of God
[3:07:13] there's got to be a separation from the
[3:07:15] world and a and a joint joining to the
[3:07:18] word do you follow that let's go
[3:07:21] on they'll obey the word and separate
[3:07:25] themselves from the things of the world
[3:07:28] because the
[3:07:30] word separates them there it is the book
[3:07:34] it's why we got to have the
[3:07:35] foundation I know they stand look look
[3:07:39] look now look long before there was a
[3:07:43] scroll behind
[3:07:44] me I was teaching the Old Testament
[3:07:48] I've been preaching and teaching the Old
[3:07:51] Testament since I
[3:07:53] started in
[3:07:56] 1975 because I could clearly see the
[3:08:00] only way to understand the New Testament
[3:08:02] properly fully was to understand the Old
[3:08:06] Testament I don't believe either of them
[3:08:08] should stand totally alone I believe
[3:08:10] they're both both wings of the eagle I I
[3:08:13] believe we need them both to understand
[3:08:16] each of them
[3:08:17] believe it with all my heart so it
[3:08:19] wasn't about a Jewish
[3:08:22] thing it was about loving the Bible the
[3:08:24] whole book all of it the world always
[3:08:28] knows its own but as I've said that
[3:08:31] remember criticism on account of the
[3:08:33] word of God is only what what it's
[3:08:35] criticism on account of the
[3:08:38] word it doesn't feel
[3:08:41] good when people stare at
[3:08:45] you when you walk in into a restaurant
[3:08:48] with other sisters or I have three girls
[3:08:51] my wife my two daughters and four with
[3:08:53] my
[3:08:57] daughter-in-law and they've are raising
[3:09:00] uh Eliana with with their conviction
[3:09:04] that she shouldn't wear pants
[3:09:06] either and we're not sure when she'll
[3:09:09] would get old enough to know when and
[3:09:10] not to so there's a there's a way of
[3:09:12] fixing that you can do it like I raised
[3:09:15] my my two girls we raised our two girls
[3:09:18] we didn't put on didn't put them on them
[3:09:21] in the
[3:09:23] beginning then we didn't have to explain
[3:09:25] why we were taking them
[3:09:27] off I know that fell
[3:09:31] flat there's a way out but he said when
[3:09:35] you get criticism on account of the word
[3:09:36] of God I see how they look I see how
[3:09:40] people watch us when I go in with
[3:09:42] them and God forbid they have on
[3:09:45] denim because if they were denim that
[3:09:49] clearly identifies you as being a
[3:09:50] fanatic it seems a jean skirt you know
[3:09:52] that's even a just a pop culture
[3:09:56] mock they want to know if you're the if
[3:09:58] you're Dugger if you're a
[3:09:59] Dugger or or a
[3:10:03] pilgrim we've even had people ignorant
[3:10:05] enough to ask if we were
[3:10:12] Amish remember any criticism you get on
[3:10:15] account of your stand for the word it's
[3:10:16] only Growing Pains of his grace and I
[3:10:19] have to be honest with you I love it I'm
[3:10:23] not a girl so I don't have to go through
[3:10:25] the emotions of the female mindset when
[3:10:28] people are staring but I love it I can
[3:10:32] strut like a
[3:10:34] duck when I walk somewhere with a Godly
[3:10:40] family I don't walk in with my head down
[3:10:43] like I'm some corn pone that don't know
[3:10:45] better hello
[3:10:48] I want everybody to know yeah and we
[3:10:50] know what we're
[3:10:51] doing and when they ask my wife if she's
[3:10:55] doing it because she married me I love
[3:10:57] her testimony I love when she can say to
[3:11:01] them I lived this life way before I met
[3:11:04] my
[3:11:05] husband when I gave my heart to the Lord
[3:11:08] I'm giving her testimony the holy spirit
[3:11:10] of God taught me how to dress he showed
[3:11:14] me what to do I led him
[3:11:17] I had rebelled against the teaching of
[3:11:19] my parents and I didn't embrace it
[3:11:21] because my parents taught me I had
[3:11:23] already come to the conclusion at one
[3:11:25] point in my life they were
[3:11:28] crazy but when I gave my heart although
[3:11:31] although let me say in my wife's defense
[3:11:33] she didn't wear them in front of her mom
[3:11:35] and
[3:11:36] dad she had enough respect somebody said
[3:11:39] that's being a hypocrite no it's called
[3:11:41] r p
[3:11:45] c it's called called
[3:11:48] respect she respect they knew but she
[3:11:52] respected them enough and there's
[3:11:55] nothing wrong with having a little
[3:11:57] respect anybody getting
[3:11:59] me but she will tell people who ask her
[3:12:02] you do that because the church you go to
[3:12:04] you do that because your husband makes
[3:12:05] you no I do it because when I gave my
[3:12:09] heart to the Lord I let the Holy Spirit
[3:12:12] show me the
[3:12:14] way and people shut up they don't know
[3:12:17] what to say because they think that
[3:12:18] every woman who dresses like you dress
[3:12:21] is beat down and mistreated by their
[3:12:23] husbands and
[3:12:24] forced to wear denim skirts for the rest
[3:12:27] of their
[3:12:27] life well let me tell you something
[3:12:31] everybody's not what you think they are
[3:12:34] and they may judge you and they may
[3:12:35] criticize you but you just remember if
[3:12:38] they do it's just growing pains of Grace
[3:12:40] that's right it shows that you have
[3:12:42] separated yourself to be a Christian
[3:12:45] you've not only separated yourself from
[3:12:48] the world from the bar from the alcohol
[3:12:50] from The Swinging From The Dope From the
[3:12:54] pill popping from the wh hopping but you
[3:12:58] have separated yourself
[3:13:00] unto from something and unto something
[3:13:07] else it's it's a Nazarite vow to
[3:13:10] separate a call from God that separates
[3:13:12] you from the things of the world I'm
[3:13:13] nearly done he said I believe tonight
[3:13:16] that every every man and woman every boy
[3:13:18] and girl that's born of the spirit of
[3:13:19] God is a Nazarite under the Lord because
[3:13:22] they've separated them things themselves
[3:13:24] from the cares of the world and from
[3:13:26] whatever the world has got to say you
[3:13:28] live in this city here where there's
[3:13:30] great schools and now we see our nation
[3:13:32] calling for higher standards of
[3:13:34] Education which is all right nothing to
[3:13:36] say about that but that education cannot
[3:13:38] give you salvation anybody like to amen
[3:13:41] that can't do it can't do it a scientist
[3:13:46] can't split a grain of wheat and tell
[3:13:48] you how many different chemicals is in
[3:13:50] it but it can't a can he can't but it
[3:13:53] can't find the life that's in there he
[3:13:55] can't explain it and education can learn
[3:13:58] you help us brother brandom teach you
[3:14:01] mathematics and it can teach you history
[3:14:03] and whatever more but it can't bring
[3:14:05] light to you your education will not do
[3:14:09] that anybody believe that that sheep
[3:14:13] skin on your wall it didn't bring the
[3:14:15] Light of Christ to you God has one way
[3:14:17] of bringing light to you that's when
[3:14:19] you're ready to separate yourself from
[3:14:22] all the things of the world and all the
[3:14:23] cares of the world and cling
[3:14:28] only to the promised
[3:14:31] word Paul was a Nazarite under the Lord
[3:14:34] he was separated from his Orthodox
[3:14:36] Church to the word of the Living God
[3:14:39] Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he
[3:14:42] was separated from among the Brethren to
[3:14:44] Bear the birthstones and to be the high
[3:14:46] priest
[3:14:47] last paragraph it is a total
[3:14:51] separation we're not going to go back
[3:14:54] into the world no more stood in Marvel
[3:14:58] about how he had come to Christ away
[3:15:00] from his addiction he dedicated his life
[3:15:03] to Ministry on Bourbon
[3:15:05] Street and ended up because I'm telling
[3:15:08] you something there are high moments in
[3:15:10] your life that you can flee from every
[3:15:13] devil even the smell of a devil send you
[3:15:16] running
[3:15:17] but there are lower moments in your life
[3:15:20] when you are tired in body and
[3:15:24] mind worn out that one
[3:15:31] little so you've got to be careful where
[3:15:34] you hang
[3:15:35] out the total
[3:15:38] separation cleave only unto God Jesus is
[3:15:41] coming after a bride a woman a church
[3:15:44] that's separated from the things of the
[3:15:45] world or the cares of the
[3:15:50] world she is separated from the
[3:15:54] Fashions of this Modern Age that we live
[3:15:58] in she is separated from the cares and
[3:16:02] the traditions of
[3:16:04] churches she is separated only to
[3:16:09] God and God is the
[3:16:13] word and as a husband and wife is one so
[3:16:16] so does the bride and the word become
[3:16:19] one for the word oh
[3:16:23] my this is too good to skim over because
[3:16:27] we're tired it's too good to skim over
[3:16:29] let it sink in for the word is
[3:16:34] living through the bride yes sir that's
[3:16:38] how and and listen that's her
[3:16:41] credentials listen Holiness is a badge
[3:16:44] of honor
[3:16:46] separated living is a badge of
[3:16:51] honor it can keep family
[3:16:54] strong it can keep people out of the
[3:16:57] lion's
[3:16:58] mouth it can keep people off the Bourbon
[3:17:02] Street and the whiskey and the every
[3:17:05] other you
[3:17:06] know
[3:17:09] tobacco
[3:17:11] pot upper
[3:17:14] downer shooter whatever
[3:17:18] it's a badge of honor it's her
[3:17:20] identification it's her credentials the
[3:17:23] fact that she has let the word live
[3:17:26] through her the fact that she has let
[3:17:28] the word so influence her that she
[3:17:31] doesn't
[3:17:34] care doesn't mean she donees
[3:17:37] notice but at the end of the day she has
[3:17:40] no sister in Christ has no
[3:17:45] intention of pleasing
[3:17:47] the world around her because they turn
[3:17:50] up their
[3:17:54] nose she knows that her chest is given
[3:17:57] her for her
[3:17:59] husband and to nurse her children right
[3:18:02] it's not to show the rest of the world
[3:18:05] there's something wrong with a husband
[3:18:07] that wants his wife to show her
[3:18:10] stuff to other men he spent too much
[3:18:14] time in pornography himself self I
[3:18:17] guarantee
[3:18:21] it you see it's a vicious
[3:18:24] cycle and a and a woman doesn't want she
[3:18:27] wants to show herself to her husband in
[3:18:29] the privacy of a of a
[3:18:32] bedroom not marching down the street
[3:18:34] like this world does my God my family
[3:18:38] told me I they went to Atlanta shopping
[3:18:41] and in a in a nice store stands a woman
[3:18:47] in her
[3:18:49] bra I don't usually say
[3:18:53] that I grew up my my family was so
[3:18:57] oldfashioned my Granny if they ever
[3:19:00] mentioned it and I overheard it they
[3:19:03] either called them unmentionables or a
[3:19:08] brazer you would never think that a
[3:19:11] woman would wear such a thing to do her
[3:19:15] job with a little light shirt over and
[3:19:20] it opened not one
[3:19:21] button so you could see as she was
[3:19:24] serving the ladies or whatever their
[3:19:29] their
[3:19:30] transaction standing there in their bra
[3:19:33] brother brandom said those things he
[3:19:35] said that day would come and people
[3:19:37] mocked him
[3:19:39] then he said they'll wear their outward
[3:19:42] they'll wear their underneath clothes as
[3:19:44] outerwear
[3:19:47] and we're living in that world and that
[3:19:51] little bride of Christ oh don't miss
[3:19:55] what is being said to us today that
[3:19:57] little bride says I don't
[3:19:59] [Music]
[3:20:01] care if they strip off and March down
[3:20:05] the road that is up to them I don't get
[3:20:09] my identification from a society that
[3:20:13] doesn't know the difference in what is
[3:20:15] decent and what is not decent and I
[3:20:19] don't get my validation from a world
[3:20:21] that don't know which pronouns go to a
[3:20:24] male and which pronouns go to a
[3:20:28] female you're going to let that world
[3:20:31] judge you and look down on you because
[3:20:35] you put on a
[3:20:38] skirt God's word listen I know it sounds
[3:20:43] harsh coming from a
[3:20:45] preacher but it's a love
[3:20:48] affair it's Christ saying won't you love
[3:20:54] me more than
[3:20:58] yourself won't you love me more than
[3:21:01] your
[3:21:02] image won't you love me more than than
[3:21:06] your worth if you get your worth from
[3:21:09] the
[3:21:11] nods of the twisted sick world
[3:21:16] that we live in you need that approval
[3:21:19] there's somebody in this
[3:21:22] house you need you need that approval
[3:21:25] from a world that's lost her
[3:21:31] rocker they're having to say things like
[3:21:35] can you
[3:21:36] define for me what a woman
[3:21:40] is what does it take to make a woman
[3:21:44] what what identifies a man man is a
[3:21:47] man I think that you have gotten that
[3:21:50] concept by
[3:21:55] kindergarten you have if you grew up
[3:21:57] with
[3:22:00] brothers and that's the world we live in
[3:22:03] and yet they're they're elements of the
[3:22:04] body of Christ who need the work you
[3:22:07] need you need that dope
[3:22:12] head to look twice at you that means
[3:22:16] means something to you because you
[3:22:19] caught his
[3:22:22] attention no
[3:22:25] sir this this wife of Jesus Christ I
[3:22:29] don't care if she's 13 I don't care if
[3:22:32] she's
[3:22:34] 16 she doesn't need the dangles and
[3:22:39] bangles and and
[3:22:42] Jangles of this world to feel value
[3:22:50] to feel like she's worth something your
[3:22:52] worth is not some diamond on your
[3:22:57] finger your worth is not some
[3:23:01] uh spiders glued to your
[3:23:06] eyeballs something tells me I'm not
[3:23:09] supposed to see somebody's eyelashes at
[3:23:13] at 25 yards
[3:23:18] something tells me God didn't make that
[3:23:21] women that way on
[3:23:24] purpose you can sit in traffic and look
[3:23:27] way across there at the at the
[3:23:30] intersection and see some poor
[3:23:35] girl with
[3:23:39] tarantulas she thinks that she gets her
[3:23:42] value because some dopehead I know I
[3:23:45] need to shut up
[3:23:49] because some dope had whistled at
[3:23:52] her CUA somebody likes that spider
[3:23:56] look let me tell you
[3:23:59] something it's like the it's like
[3:24:02] the it's like the preacher
[3:24:10] said I'm not going into that
[3:24:16] your value to
[3:24:19] Christ you young girls you young
[3:24:22] unmarried
[3:24:24] girls if you've got to twist your body
[3:24:27] if you've got to lower your standard to
[3:24:30] attract uh the the boy of your
[3:24:33] dreams he's not
[3:24:37] worth he's not worth your
[3:24:40] effort if he's got to have a peekaboo
[3:24:43] look at you
[3:24:47] he's not worth your
[3:24:53] time he can't buy you a
[3:24:57] pizza without Googling
[3:25:00] you he's not the kind of man that you
[3:25:02] want to train and raise your children
[3:25:05] hello you know
[3:25:12] this the little girl from the church
[3:25:14] I'll tell it
[3:25:18] the little girl from the church went out
[3:25:21] she went out in the world she wasn't
[3:25:27] married she had a boy he had her if you
[3:25:30] know what I
[3:25:32] mean and he was done with
[3:25:35] her he had no intention of marrying
[3:25:40] her he just wanted to deflower
[3:25:43] her he wanted to take her purity
[3:25:49] and instead of instead of it shaking her
[3:25:52] to the
[3:25:54] core she said I'll just find me somebody
[3:25:57] else that'll have me and she goes from
[3:25:59] boy to
[3:26:01] boy she gets passed around like a piece
[3:26:03] of
[3:26:05] meat and she dares to make
[3:26:10] fun of the little girl that uh has
[3:26:13] stayed with the faith
[3:26:18] this girl's long traded in her glasses
[3:26:21] she's got contacts now and she's fixed
[3:26:24] everything that needed to be fixed
[3:26:28] and when she sees those little girls at
[3:26:31] the church that she used to be one of
[3:26:34] she she used to think they were all
[3:26:37] pretty and now she thinks she's pretty
[3:26:41] and they're just homely
[3:26:43] little plain Janes you know
[3:26:47] so she goes to them and she's going to
[3:26:48] set them straight and she's going to
[3:26:50] she's going to see if she can get them
[3:26:52] to live a
[3:26:53] little because even if you're right and
[3:26:56] Jesus is coming soon you don't want to
[3:26:58] miss out on some of the pleasure and the
[3:27:00] fun that I've had in my life and so
[3:27:02] instead of trying to crawl back to God
[3:27:06] she thinks she could be of a service in
[3:27:09] helping pull some of them
[3:27:10] away so she she starts her work she goes
[3:27:15] back and visits some of them and begins
[3:27:17] to talk to them and she gets some
[3:27:19] cornered and tells them how they need to
[3:27:21] live a little loosen up a little put a
[3:27:23] little color here and fix a little
[3:27:25] something there and show a little
[3:27:27] peek-aboo to the world and on and on and
[3:27:30] on and and she thinks they're just going
[3:27:32] they're so naive and gullible you know
[3:27:35] pushovers to even do like that she
[3:27:38] thinks I'm going to it's not going to be
[3:27:39] hard for me to pull them right into the
[3:27:42] world and they look at her in the face
[3:27:44] and they tell her we love you and we're
[3:27:46] praying for you and we want to see you
[3:27:48] come back to God but we need to tell you
[3:27:50] something
[3:27:52] straight any
[3:27:55] day I
[3:27:57] choose I can be what you
[3:28:03] are but you'll never fully be what I am
[3:28:14] again kind of tough talk in
[3:28:17] it but it was the
[3:28:20] truth they were
[3:28:22] looking she was looking to persuade and
[3:28:25] Pull and that she thought they were
[3:28:27] pushover they knew they knew they
[3:28:28] weren't so stupid they knew what was
[3:28:31] going on and they said we Cho we choose
[3:28:35] we make our choice every day to be what
[3:28:37] we are nobody is keeping making us
[3:28:41] forcing us we have made a choice and
[3:28:44] when your choice is Jesus and to follow
[3:28:46] the world there word and not the world
[3:28:49] there's no greater Choice let's stand
[3:28:53] father I want to be separated from the
[3:28:56] world I want to be yolked to the word
[3:29:00] I'm not ashamed of a Nazarite vow I'm
[3:29:03] not ashamed to be separated I'm not
[3:29:05] ashamed that we have tried to raise our
[3:29:08] children to be
[3:29:11] separated we ask Lord that you help us
[3:29:14] it's not about dress only it that has
[3:29:17] been the focus of these last 30 minutes
[3:29:20] but that that's not what it's all
[3:29:24] about but it's a portion of Our
[3:29:27] Testimony because what you do on the
[3:29:30] inside what's going on on the
[3:29:32] inside oozes its way to the
[3:29:37] outside we want to represent
[3:29:40] you in everything that we say or do the
[3:29:44] enemy is out to

[3:39:58] life we have made a commitment to follow
[3:40:01] you Lord we're here today we're in this
[3:40:06] house today because we committed to
[3:40:08] following you so Lord strengthen my
[3:40:13] brothers strengthen my sisters
[3:40:16] today to get under the influence of your
[3:40:20] word to let your word work in our
[3:40:25] hearts let it not be a
[3:40:28] cliche to get in the word but let it be
[3:40:31] a passion
[3:40:34] Lord read what our life is about Jes
[3:40:39] strengthen us to continue to make good
[3:40:43] choices
[3:40:45] better
[3:40:47] choices Lord I Thank you for every
[3:40:49] brother and every sister under the sound
[3:40:52] of my voice that is committed so many
[3:40:55] times through the years to follow your
[3:40:58] word we're not going back
[3:41:01] now we're going up and onward and
[3:41:05] forward into whatever you have for us
[3:41:09] but we get weary we get
[3:41:12] distracted we get under influence
[3:41:15] and we need you to help us today so we
[3:41:18] ask for each other the the way that we
[3:41:21] receive
[3:41:22] strength like David said is to pray for
[3:41:25] somebody else and my prayer returned to
[3:41:28] my own bosom Lord through the sisters
[3:41:31] who have a particularly hard place
[3:41:35] living in this mixed up
[3:41:37] world would you raise them up with
[3:41:40] strength with conviction with passion
[3:41:44] may you Shield them Lord from the stairs
[3:41:48] and the glares and the grumbles of a
[3:41:51] God's Society of for God forsaken
[3:41:55] Society may they keep their eyes on you
[3:41:58] and desire to continue to reflect you in
[3:42:02] every decision that they make may they
[3:42:05] shine in this dirty world may they cause
[3:42:08] others to dig deeper to pray harder to
[3:42:12] find a way
[3:42:14] back to the god of their childhood for
[3:42:17] so many Lord it's not about just the way
[3:42:21] we look on the
[3:42:23] outside we give you the inside of us the
[3:42:27] Brokenness the
[3:42:29] woundedness the bitterness that comes
[3:42:33] sometime everything that the enemy has
[3:42:36] slimed us with and poured over us we
[3:42:39] don't want a negative or evil report to
[3:42:41] influence us in this hour we don't want
[3:42:44] the word to all around us not prospering
[3:42:48] us to find the rest that you made so
[3:42:51] readily available to us if we'll mix it
[3:42:53] with faith and let it do its work in US
[3:42:56] Lord I ask you to strengthen this body I
[3:42:59] say again I do not believe it's the only
[3:43:02] place but I believe it's one of the
[3:43:05] places where you have placed your name
[3:43:07] in the end time and I do believe there
[3:43:10] is a holy Remnant in this house that
[3:43:13] will March into the head ship of Christ
[3:43:16] no matter what the devil says I believe
[3:43:20] there is a band of Overcomers under the
[3:43:23] sound of my voice who will rise above
[3:43:27] the spirit of leoda and they'll even
[3:43:30] rise above the spirit of
[3:43:33] denominationalism that has crowded into
[3:43:36] this message we thank you Lord that the
[3:43:39] revelation of Jesus Christ will never be
[3:43:43] denominated it will never ever be a
[3:43:45] system we refuse to let it be that in
[3:43:49] our own lives we yield to the upward
[3:43:52] call we yield to it right now strengthen
[3:43:56] whoever it is that stands in need of
[3:43:59] strength today to keep keeping on to
[3:44:03] keep keeping on the brothers who have a
[3:44:06] responsibility Lord for their children
[3:44:08] for their families for their wives
[3:44:11] strengthen them now Lord the pressure of
[3:44:15] the outward appearance may not be on
[3:44:17] them like it is a sister but the inward
[3:44:20] pressure the pressure to be a godly man
[3:44:23] of integrity and character is ever on
[3:44:28] them find the opportunity to make a
[3:44:31] living without cheating somebody that's
[3:44:34] a pressure that every brother faces
[3:44:38] strengthen them
[3:44:40] today strengthen them Lord send a Prayer
[3:44:44] Revival
[3:44:45] send a burden for prayer in this house
[3:44:49] like we have once known restore to us
[3:44:53] the joy of Salvation bring us back under
[3:44:56] the voice of deliverance we pray in the
[3:45:00] name of Jesus we fight our way Lord back
[3:45:05] forward in your name

[3:47:02] that if
[3:47:04] someone is standing on shaking
[3:47:08] ground someone not not fully committing
[3:47:15] there is a
[3:47:16] tendency to want you where they
[3:47:19] are it it's sad but it's the
[3:47:23] reality you see if you're not doing well
[3:47:26] and everybody around you is
[3:47:28] pulling there's something in us sometime
[3:47:31] that wants to pull people down to where
[3:47:33] we are we're struggling they're not so
[3:47:36] we kind of want to invite them into our
[3:47:38] struggle you're going to have to make up
[3:47:41] your
[3:47:42] mind to let your back bone be solid Lord
[3:47:47] like a saw log pray for those who
[3:47:51] struggle pray for those who feel
[3:47:53] distracted pray for those who battle
[3:47:56] unbelief but don't allow your own walk
[3:47:59] your own testimony to be pulled down see
[3:48:03] what you can do to press into the word
[3:48:05] and to press into Christ and maybe God
[3:48:07] will use the
[3:48:08] influence to pull them back to where
[3:48:12] they need to
[3:48:13] be I've watched people congregate

[3:48:18] similar struggle make up your mind
