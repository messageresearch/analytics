[0:00] so for Christ to foreknow you it means
[0:04] that he appointed you as a subject of
[0:08] future privileges Hallelujah
[0:18] you are accepted I want you to know
[0:20] something people may not accept you down
[0:22] here
[0:24] they may not understand you down here
[0:27] you may face more rejection than you do
[0:29] acceptance but you need to remember
[0:32] you're not living on the acceptance of
[0:34] other people
[0:36] you're not functioning by how other
[0:39] people react to you you are accepted by
[0:42] the Beloved
[0:43] you are foreknown predestiness
[0:47] and glorified and the devil doesn't know
[0:50] what to do with you
[0:55] doesn't know what to do with you because
[0:57] you're living out of your destiny scroll
[1:00] you're living out of those five steps of
[1:02] redemption you have been foreknown you
[1:06] have been predestinated you have been
[1:09] called you have been Justified and you
[1:12] are being glorified
[1:14] you're in the process of your
[1:16] glorification
[1:18] he's getting your robe ready
[1:22] the same road brother random said he
[1:24] dressed Christ in on the day of
[1:26] transfiguration
[1:27] which is the day of his glorification
[1:30] so glorified so transfigured before
[1:33] their eyes that light penetrated and
[1:36] inhabited the cells of his body
[1:40] and purest light began to shine out of
[1:44] the pores of his skin
[1:47] God dressed him in a robe of glory and
[1:53] that same robe and it was the robe that
[1:58] said it was the robe that he wore that
[2:01] testified hear ye him
[2:06] when the father gave him that robe it
[2:08] said to the whole Community hear what he
[2:10] has to say he's a fully adopted son when
[2:14] God rapes
[2:16] that robe on your shoulder the message
[2:19] will be the same
[2:24] hear him
[2:26] hear her
[2:28] she doesn't speak of herself anymore he
[2:31] doesn't speak of himself anymore he only
[2:34] speaks of the glorified Christ so for
[2:37] Christ to foreknow you it means that he
[2:41] appointed you as a subject of future
[2:45] privileges Hallelujah
[2:48] he saw you and he chose you to have his
[2:52] authority and he chose you to eventually
[2:55] function in his power and he chose you
[2:58] to be an overcomer like he was an
[2:59] overcomer and he accepted you
