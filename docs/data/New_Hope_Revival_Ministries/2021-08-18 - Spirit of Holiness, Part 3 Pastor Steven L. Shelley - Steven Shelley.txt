Description:
"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments..." Matthew 23:1-5

right now and tell him how much you love him this evening lord we love you tonight we love you tonight we're so thankful that you've given us this blessing and privilege of gathering in your name lord though we may be stream only tonight we know that the saints of god are gathered with us in their homes we're turning our attention lord to you for the next few moments we're letting you be our focus there's so many things to focus on there's such bad news out there so much is going on in haiti so much is going on in afghanistan so many of our own people are fighting the virus but lord for the next little while our focus is not going to be on haiti or afghanistan it's not going to be on a virus but we have gathered together tonight in spirit to lift you up and to let you know that we want to see you we want to see your glory we're not just after miracles or signs or wonders we want all of those things but lord it's you that we want we want a closer relationship with you we love you tonight oh lord you are wonderful and worthy to be praised hallelujah amen god bless you tonight we want to welcome you to our tuesday night service and we are once again stream only as we have been for the last few weeks we had an outbreak of the virus in our church community and many people were fighting it at one time and we wanted to do everything that we could to reduce the spread and uh i don't know how successful we were with that but i know that god is bringing each one through by his grace and thank you for your prayers for one another in our local church body and thank those of you who are streamers with us and you've been watching the services and you have sent many many many notes to say i'm praying for your church family i'm praying for your congregation and we know that god is certainly using those prayers to lift us to higher places and we're so thankful for that and we're going to go to the lord in prayer but i just wanted to let you know that you are welcome we're glad that you've taken a few moments of your life to join with us in this service tonight and uh i want to make sure that you know that we are doing our best to keep in touch my wife is doing a really good job helping me to stay in touch with the different ones and we see god moving we see that the lord is bringing them through and it hasn't been as quickly as we would have liked to have seen it but we nonetheless rejoice and give glory and honor to god i was able to see sister elfrida today in her automobile and she stopped and spoke a moment and and was testifying to me of how the lord has moved for her helped her and i think i mentioned i was able to see sister jeffrey the other day and god has certainly strengthened her and each one that has still been battling we've been getting reports that in most cases they're getting stronger every day and uh fevering less symptoms are going down some are out of quarantine and back to work but i think overall most people would tell you that there's weakness they're weak and they they need their strength to be renewed and you know i believe that's it's not just a physical strength but there's a spiritual strength and we're going to believe the lord so we want to go to the lord in prayer and we know that everybody is not fighting the virus but you have needs and you have problems and you have situations that you need the lord to move on your behalf and we're going to stand with you tonight in faith and we're going to believe that god will move there were several requests that came in uh on the stream on sunday and i was already praying over them sunday evening and monday and again today lifting up families so many of our families out there there the saints have burdened for their families and they want to see them serving the lord we also want to ask you to pray for sister flo's daughter-in-law pam hendrix and we know for many years they worshipped with us here and we still love them like family and that is casey hannah's mother and garvis's wife and she is in the hospital and uh they were having some problems with her and keeping the mask on and so forth and so it looked like they were going to be putting her on a ventilator this evening but we're asking the lord to work a miracle in her life we know that god is more than able we want you to lift up more rains to the lord that god would help her she's been fighting sister weems has been fighting something in her body and needs a touch from the lord we just need a lot of healing but you know he's he's on the case and we want to give god praise for what he has done and you know if we didn't believe god could do it we wouldn't bother bringing it to him but he has told us i want you to sing with me as we get ready to pray faith in god can move a mighty mountain and i still believe that tonight with all my heart let's sing that faith in god faith in god can move a mighty mountain faith in god can't calm the troubled sea oh faith can make a desert like a fountain for faith can't bring the victory [Music] sing it there with me right now would you do it oh faith faith in god it can move a mighty mountain and faith in god oh it can cause the trouble see and faith faith in god can make a desert like a fountain for faith can bring the victory let's pray together heavenly father we thank you tonight that there is no limit to what faith in god can do it's not faith in faith it's faith in god that moves mountains it's faith in god that cools a fevered brow it's faith in god that can smite a cancer cell it's faith in god that can deliver the oppressed let the captive go free and so lord it's you faith is the way we grab ahold of you but you're the deliverer you're the conqueror you're the savior you're the healer so tonight we come to you lord on behalf of sister pam hendrix we ask you god for malween sister williams and marines and lord each and every one in this congregation and out there across the world who are fighting the virus lord we know that you're the one that's standing with your people bringing them through maybe it seemed like moment by moment or minute by minute but lord i thank you that victory has come every day we're hearing many testify that i'm coming a little closer i'm almost out of it now i see the victory in sight and so lord we don't want to let up in our praying we don't want to let up in our believing because we know god that you are more than able and so we just lift them up lord i pray for every streamer right now those who are not a part of the local community of faith but they are believers out there across the world they may not be seeing this live they may watch it at another time but lord you got all that in your great big mind you know their need lord you know exactly what they need and what they will have need of so we join our faith with theirs and we say there will be miracles there will be deliverance there will be victory in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ lord it's not hard to believe you it's not hard to believe you because we've seen what you have done we've watched you move we've watched you make a way where there was no way we heard your word nothing is impossible with you and so lord with men things are possible even sometimes the doctors or a lawyer or some judge would do everything within their power to help but they're limited in power but i want to thank you lord you know no limits there are no restraints as long as we can only believe you are free lord to do what you desire to do in our lives we ask you to bless our time in your word in a few moments let us gain strength from being in your presence and sitting under your word lord it has happened that way so many times in our lives we ask for this help in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory we say amen and the church says amen so be it we agree so we want to mention to you tonight we unless you local believers should hear from us between now and then uh our plan is to gather in person on sunday morning at 11 o'clock here in the sanctuary uh if you are not able if you are perhaps still in quarantine if you still have a fever if you are still fighting symptoms that would hinder you or prevent you or prevent others then we certainly understand that there will be some who will be streaming but uh if you have already come through it and it's behind you and you're out of quarantine and you want to gather then you know if there's just eight or ten of us uh then that'll be fine we'll still be ministering to those who are at home but i don't know about you but i need to see i need to see the body and uh this is one opportunity for us to do that we don't want to endanger anyone that is not what we're trying to do we're just trying to say okay lord you're bringing us through some have come through with victory they're back at work and we might as well gather together in your name on sunday morning at 11 o'clock now if anything should change if there should be a new case or something like that we would let you know and we would go back to stream only we're going to be faithful by the grace of god to do what we can to be a blessing during this time but if possible it sure would be good to have a live amen and a nod and a smile and know that we are together we just need that sometime when we've been through something as a body and you may have even felt like you were going through it alone but i want you to know you were not there were others in the fight there were others in this church community believing god to bring you through and we ought to come with a celebration because i've had several testify to me of miracles they believe miracles have taken place in their body and in their life and we want to give god all the glory for that i think that will do for the music tonight i appreciate the help that we have had appreciate sister laurel being here and brother josh being here and benjamin being here to lead the service lead the worship and play the drums and joshua is on the projector and brother hawk is behind the sound board and the stream board and i just couldn't do this i couldn't do it without their help and i know that you've been praying for me i know you've been praying for them and we appreciate it i'm telling you we really do appreciate you standing with us we want to go to the word tonight and uh we don't have to be a long time together in the word we want you to rest we want those who are still dealing with some stuff we want you to have rest we want you to get strong i know i'm not your mama but i want to tell you to eat you that are still fighting eat something eat anything and somebody said well i can't smell it and i can't taste it i don't care if you can smell it or taste it or not eat it anyway especially if it's healthy because you need that strength and whatever you do drink water drink water drink water drink water these are things that you can do to help some of the weakness and start getting some movement in if it's just you know one sister told me who's come through it with victory she said i made myself i didn't have i i made my own food i washed my own clothes and and she said i wasn't hungry but i ate anyway i knew that i had to and i walked up and down and got exercise and sat on the porch in the sun and and did things like that to help myself and you know she has gotten the victory and so do what you can to get your strength back and just know that we love you and just know that we're thankful that god is helping you and be encouraged be encouraged because i believe that these things are upon us for a reason and we're just putting our eyes on jesus and going on tonight we will take a little lesson in the spirit of holiness we have been preaching on that now for a couple services and we'll need to get in one and maybe maybe two more on the spirit of holiness before we move on we are talking about the seven offices of the holy ghost i say just about every time i introduce a service that i don't know if that's the right terminology we could say ministries or administrations but i know that there are at least seven uh mentioned in the bible and uh for those of you that may be joining us for the first time we spoke about the spirit of life the spirit of truth the spirit of adoption and now we're on the spirit of holiness we'll go to the spirit of grace the spirit of supplication and the spirit of glory all mentioned in the bible and if you are not with us the last two services you can read the specific term of the spirit of holiness in romans chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 but we're not going to read that in the service tonight now we started on sunday in matthew chapter 23 verses 2 through 6 and i would like to read that again and then i'm going to read in two other places in in the book of matthew where jesus is dealing with religion and in verse 2 saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat it's a seat of authority and judgment all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not now we call that hypocrisy and but i love the way that jesus honored them for their determination to observe the truth to stand by the instructions that god gave to moses and yet he said while you're observing what they say do not do as they do in other words you follow their words but don't look at their actions as an example for they say something and they do not what they say verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their works they do for to be seen of men i just want you to know that holiness and the spirit of holiness is not to bring you into a place where you do what you do to be seen of men as in pride we do understand that man looks on the outward appearance god sees the heart that means that the outward appearance is a testimony and so we do understand that we are to be separate and we are to sanctify ourselves but we're not doing what we do so that everyone can see our religious trappings and say oh there goes a holy man there goes a holy woman but we want to show them the character of jesus christ and i'm telling you that the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost operating in our life is bringing us into that place where we are yielding our lives more and more to the character of jesus christ he's not only going to have a bride that operates in his power and his authority but he's going to have a bride that operates in her character can in his character can you say amen and so it's not just about sharing power and authority but it's also about sharing his character but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost seats or rooms that feast and the chief's seats in the synagogues in other words they have become puffed up in their outward trappings and i'm telling you that is not the spirit of holiness this is not true holiness this is what we end up producing when we try to make ourselves holy when we try to work our way into being holy true holiness does not work from the outside in you can clean up the out outside of the sepulchre but if inside you're still filled with dead men's bones then it's hypocrisy and we'll find that jesus goes on to deal with that same spirit among the scribes and the pharisees of his day in fact let me read now in matthew chapter 15. this is going to be a little longer reading 20 verses but i want to read this because again jesus is dealing with the scribes and the pharisees then came jesus described excuse me then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread and this was a reasonable question but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandments of god by your tradition now hold it there just a moment the scribes and the pharisees came to jesus and they asked him why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders and jesus answers a question with a question and that's a good way to be he said why do ye also transgress the commandments of god by your traditions you're taking on traditions that actually transgress the commandment the instruction of god he put it right back on them and he said for god commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death that's a commandment that's not a tradition and then he goes on but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me we're still reading on an honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition in other words your hypocrisy and here he goes on ye hypocrites why did isaias prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me i don't know about you but that grips me it does it speaks to me it causes me to want to search my own heart because we can know the right lingo we can have the right vocabulary we can know the right talk and the right language but jesus said you're being hypocrite you're drawing nigh to me making all of these professions with your mouth honoring me with your lips but you have not placed your heart in my hands you have retained your heart you have held it back from me in other words jesus is saying you've not allowed me to walk through those deep and dark hallways and canyons of your own heart i want to deal with you and cleanse you from the inside out but you're not yielding to that cleansing because you're focusing only on the outward form you're focusing only in keeping your father's traditions but you're missing the point your tradition is not higher than the commandment it's better that you stand with the commandment of the lord and if your tradition is something not contrary to his commandment then hold on to that as well but if if your tradition causes you to transgress the commandment the truth the instruction then you've got to do some adjusting here where does that adjusting take place not in the garment in the costume or in the outward form it takes place in those deep places of the heart when i was just a boy they used to sing a song about the heart and it was a nice song i'll never forget i hadn't heard it in years and brother carpenter's church from mesa arizona came here and visited us with a big busload of young people many years ago and the youth choir sung that song and it was an invitation that jesus should walk through the avenues of my heart and sometimes he he may come to a door and i don't remember the the lyrics of the song but the theme of the song was he might come to a door and i might not want him i might want to protect myself i might want to keep something from him some secret that i'm not ready for him to deal with but he's not there to destroy he's there to lovingly help me to walk through those places to expose in love and light the things that i have tried to hide from him and i want you to know if you hide your sin if you hide even the pain and don't give it to him and allow him if you hide the rejection instead of just saying lord i'm dealing with this then you you suffer a whole lot longer than you have to so let's not do that let's allow him to come and do some work on the inside focus on that a little while and then the overflow hallelujah that beautiful overflow of inward holiness is going to affect us on the outside and not only us it's going to affect those around us there's no doubt about it now he goes on in verse 9 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so they have not only replaced the commandments of god with tradition but now they're replacing that with teaching the commandments of men and oral traditions and and all of these different opinions and ideas and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand i want you to know he's getting serious here verse 11 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man again jesus is putting the emphasis on the inside and what works its way to the surface he's putting greater importance and greater significance why because he knows that this is where true holiness comes from it comes by yielding our inner will our mind our will and our emotions and allowing the holy ghost to direct our thoughts to direct our choices to direct our decisions he said it's not that which goeth into the mouth that defiled the man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man now verse 12 then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up he wasn't moved because of their offense he said let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch jesus was saying you you see the hypocrisy in their life and the critical spirit that surrounds them you'll never be able to bring peace you'll never be able to talk them out of their offense you'll just have to walk off and leave them alone let the blind lead the blind they'll both fall in the ditch i don't believe he was forsaking them all as though they had no hope he was just saying nothing good is going to come out of trying to argue with this kind of a spirit and then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding i know they don't understand but are you also not understanding do you not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the drought or into the drought but those things which proceeded out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man and so even more importantly than what you eat that goes into the belly that is passed off through the digestive system even more important than watching what you eat jesus is saying it's important to go to the heart of the matter the matter of the heart to go right to the inside to the intention because out of that heart the bible tells us out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man now you're in other words you're taking the tradition of the rabbis you are putting that in greater importance you are putting that in a higher position a higher priority than you are by guarding your heart because out of the heart call comes remember that all these things start in the thoughts a man doesn't just go out and commit fornication it's a thought process there's a thought process to committing adultery and thefts and bearing false witness and committing blasphemies it comes from the thoughts which which come from the heart and he goes on and says these are the things which to follow man it seems to me like the scribes and the pharisees wanted to keep people busy with what is on the external and what is and there are a lot of people who focus their whole seems like their whole theme of life is to work on the outside and and that's a good thing to want to behave right live right and do right dress right and be modest and have a good character these are very very important but they don't come from trying to like a leopard trying to change his spots or somebody trying to add a cubit to their stature by giving it a whole lot of thought no that's not the way these things come they come by an inner cleansing they come oh yes by sanctifying they come by the spirit of holiness that works on the inside helps us deal with all these thoughts and temptations that brings us into a place where we could just say yes lord i just want to be like you i just want you to flow out of my life now will you look with me to matthew 12 we're not going to spend too much time here but would you go to matthew 12 i want to read verse 33 to 37 it's again red letter jesus is still trying to to set the record straight and he said either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit so a good tree is known to be a good tree because it bears good fruit and the corrupt tree is known to be that because of rotten fruit or corrupt fruit or fruit that is not good oh generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh this is serious business he said a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but i say unto you listen that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give a count thereof in the day of judgment it's so much more than eating the wrong thing it's so much more than that jesus is saying every idle word it's not the it's not the the enlarged border it's it's not the phylactery all of these things may be just fine but that is not how we walk as children of god sons of god this is a process that takes place from the inside out jesus said then in verse 37 for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned so please understand and i'm not just speaking to people who are the same faith or follow the same ministry or message that we do i'm speaking to people of all kinds of faiths and i'll tell you there are many people out there that when they hear the word holiness the first thing that comes to their mind is legalism and they don't even understand why we would choose to live a different life and maybe not follow the fads and and traditions of and and all the pop culture i guess they call it now they they can't understand and they think that automatically we think that those are the things that bring us salvation but i want you to know that that has nothing to do with how we are saved we are saved by faith in the blood of jesus christ grace brings that great blood to our life and we are saved by grace not by works lest any man should boast but as we yield ourselves because to be born again is to not only be justified but also to be sanctified and to be filled with the holy ghost the spirit of god and that holy ghost within us by the spirit of holiness is bringing us to a place where we begin to see that we're going to answer every believer every person going to answer for what comes out of our mouth now before we close this evening let me say a few other things and then i want to give you a few quotations holiness is not established by external codes of living but by an internal way of living that works itself out in other words you can you can have the enlarged borders and you can you can pray with the phylacteries and you can do all the religious things and still be lost and undone without god but if you get the heart right if you allow the spirit of holiness to deal with your inner man and begin to birth the character of jesus christ in you then i'm going to tell you something it's going to work its way you're going to want to live holy consecrated dedicated and set apart you're not going to want to do anything that causes someone else to be tempted in lust or fornication or other sins you're going to want to present yourself in modesty and in purity and that's not in keeping of a code no siree not at all that's by allowing the holy spirit to show you how to walk and how to talk and how to conduct yourself and god places us you know in communities of faith he places us we were told many years ago here in our church that there was a parabolic anointing over this place and that god was going to use us in many different ways in the end time and that people would come through here that had no idea of the kind of faith that we had stood on but they would understand that god had chosen us to walk this walk as a parable and i tell you i've never seen an hour where walking before god in purity is sending such a message because the world is in such confusion in this hour there's got to be a people who know who they are and who know who their god is and who know what kind of power and ability he has so whenever holiness is only present in a church body by legislated rules and regulations from the outside it produces legalism it produces spiritual pride it produces uh religious spirits that this is bondage and nobody can grow spiritually or thrive spiritually in that kind of an atmosphere but when holiness is is emphasized from the inside out then we all can grow legalism itself produces nothing but condemnation and and legalism is when we hang all these things as our salvation when we say this is i do this i do that i do the other and and because of that this is how i know that i'm accepted by god and and and this is what saves us and then we start looking out and we say if you don't do it like i do it you're not saved and we make all kinds of judgments and condemnations we don't have time brother sister in this hour to worry about really what other people are doing we have got to come to be right ourselves we've got to yield to the spirit of holiness ourselves legalism in itself produces nothing but condemnation a lack of acceptance the feeling of never being able to measure up and this is not what god has come to do it produces this kind of an attitude that says this is too hard and i can't do it anymore and it frustrates people because they don't understand holiness it's not the external part first it's the internal the quality of your intake this is what jesus was teaching the quality of your intake dictates or determines the strength of your output if you don't hear the word on holiness you won't walk in holiness if you don't hear the truth of righteousness and you won't even accept and walk in god's righteousness i want to boil it down i want to boil it down tonight i want to tell you that holiness is a person it's the nature and character of the godhead revealed in the life of the believer this is holiness holiness is not man-made holiness is god made holiness is the nature of god not our human nature it's the nature of god demonstrated in our lives by demonstrating christ-like character that therefore dictates our external lifestyle our choices our decisions the way we conduct ourselves it's it's determined in the heart of a true believer by this spirit of holiness that lives on the inside of us you see it's his righteousness it's his righteousness that we're depending on now i'd like to share a few quotes from brother branham with you before we close our tuesday night service tonight i'd like to read from the message influence from 1963 from the city of new york and the state of new york that's new york new york he said it's the presence of god in our midst now that brings holiness it's not my holiness remember what we said just a moment ago holiness is a person it's the presence of god that brings holiness brother branham said not my holiness not yours but his holiness his presence is what brings the holiness remember we were talking about that bush on mount moriah mount moriah that god chose to put his pillar of fire in and speak to his prophet from just 30 seconds before that was an ordinary bush but now it was a holy bush growing on holy ground what made it holy the presence of god came down brother sister if there's anything about me that's holy if there's anything about you that's holy it's the presence of jesus christ it's god's holy ghost in us it's his holiness in us that makes us holy he goes on to say we ought to humble ourselves cover ourselves in reverence humility and say lord jesus receive me into your kingdom his holiness not ours holy spirit i really like that let me read be not afraid tucson arizona 1963 i i just underlined it all highlighted it all the whole whole paragraph here he said as i said there's no great men and holy men there is not we're not any of us holy we got a holy spirit in us but we're not holy it's he he is the one is holy see it's his holiness not mine not yours his what do you think about that what do you think about the fact that i don't have to produce some kind of holiness i don't have to make myself holiness i just have to yield myself to the spirit of holiness that's working in me by the holy ghost and what that spirit does it rises up in me producing reproducing the holiness of god and there's no way in the world i can keep living like i lived before there's no way i can keep making the decision i now want to be careful what i put before my eyes i now want to be careful what i find myself participating in i now want to be careful what i what i where i go and what i do and even who i go with i now want to be careful because i understand that there's a holiness that that i'm carrying that is not my own it's him it's his and it's precious oh i can't tell you how precious it is in the message christianity versus idolatry do i have a few more minutes yes i do paragraph 191 he said we are made partakers of his holiness we in his image we are living images of a living god been dead to self raised with him he said now listen to this his word made flesh again in us his word made flesh again in us producing in us his word producing in us the spirit of holiness producing in us his righteousness his holiness he said oh brother never look look what is it it's it's he excuse me he said not the i was reading from the from the last one he said not the not the mythical imaginary god sitting out there but the living god what is the living god the word in you making itself real i think we better read that again because you may have a religious mindset and if you have a religious mindset you'll be rejecting that before you give your heart an opportunity to embrace it he said it's not the mythical imaginary god sitting out there but the living god he said what is the living god the word in you making itself real he said phew glory to god oh i know you think i'm a holy roller maybe i am but oh brother do you see it brother sister i see it i see that it's the word of god in us manifesting his righteousness and holiness he said triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living god made manifest in a living temple and the word of god which is god remember the bible tells us that that god is his word and the word was god hallelujah he said triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living god made manifest in a living temple and the word of god which is god is made flesh in you why you're seated in heavenly places triumphed over all things in christ jesus amen oh i just love it he said i have to skip something and go on he was getting carried away in this great truth there is this word of god working in us through us bringing us to a place where we can trust the holy ghost we can trust the spirit of holiness let me read a little more in a message it wasn't so from the beginning he said send his holy spirit down here to come into our flesh which he has sanctified with his own blood you believe in sanctification be ye holy for i am holy he said now you cannot be holy here's god asking us to be holy brother man said now you cannot be holy then he explains i'm not depending on my holiness i have none remember i can do it all right i can look real good on the outside and yet i have no holiness he said rem i have none he said but i'm depending on his holiness it's his holiness that i'm looking at not what well not what i was but what he is that's it go back to the beginning there it is jesus christ the same yesterday let's go to god's provided way paragraph 38 i know some of you are going to believe in me if i don't hurry we're sinners saved by grace we must recognize that from the richest to the poorest from the best dressed to the worst dressed as the outside dressing has nothing to do with it it'll perish but the inside is what lasts i'd rather have my spirit covered with the robe of his holiness than to have the best suits that could be bought in all the world sure rich in the kingdom of god and this was an hour where he's preaching and trying to explain to people it's it's not your money it's not your your class of people somebody might stand there in a fine italian three-piece suit somebody else may come in the best pair of old bib overalls they have they don't have a nice fine italian suit an italian loafer shoes but they get up and they wash those bib overalls and press them up come to the house of god to worship and god does not esteem the man in his italian suit any higher than he does the old farmer in his bib overalls it is not that outward dropping or dressing that makes god accept you oh no it's what he has done in you and for you and now through you that makes you acceptable hallelujah and it's more important it's more important abraham i'm going to finish this abraham paragraph 21 i've got this one and one more he said now you say that has an awful calvinistic swing to it brother branham he said that's right it does and calvinism is all right as long as it stays true to the bible but when it gets off on the wrong limb then it's no good you see brother branham believed in calvinism but he also knew there was something extreme calvinism developed into something extreme that he couldn't follow that through the word and when it gets out of the word that's when we get off of it amen and he made it very clear he said now you say that has an awful calvinistic swing to it brother brown that's right it does and calvinism is all right as long as it stays true to the bible but when he gets off on the wrong limb then it is no good armenianism that's to say same same thing with armenianism as long as that stays with the word you can take all the doctrine as long as it stays with the word man will sometimes try to get you to swallow something it may sound good to the ear but if it doesn't line up with the word it's not of god he said holiness is correct as long as it stays in bible holiness not your holiness but his holiness see then it's not my holiness i'm not depending i'm still reading i'm not depending on my holiness i have none but i'm holy wh i like it w-h-o-l-l-y holy trusting in his holiness now it goes on see it's he he's the one who did it not my works but his finished works that i rest assured that i was received into the beloved and when the beloved was received by god you got to hear this he said not my works but his finished works that i rest assured that i was received into the beloved and when the beloved was received by god god received me in christ that settles it see no negatives no ifs and ands it's a finished work how many of you are trusting in that finished work if you're trusting in anything else it'll fail if you're trusting that you'll always do the right thing that'll fail but if you're trusting that if you continue to yield to him he will cause you he'll lead you he'll anoint you to do the right thing now one last quote is paragraph eight from god perfecting his church being hampton new york he said so we give god praise tonight to know that the holy spirit is in us last night i was teaching on the perfection god perfecting his church bringing the church to perfection through the lord jesus christ that how we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed our heirs according to the promise i believe that and we are perfected i believe that not in our own self not in our own holiness he said my someone said to me not long ago said brother branham do you believe in holiness i don't know why they were asking him a question like that brother branham do you believe in holiness i said yes sir without such no man can see god that's what the bible said i said but not my holiness cause i have not any i believe in holiness see something that he has done and it's that i rest my hopes upon not on my own merits i have none i rest upon his merits having this assurance as he loves me i love him and the whole thing becomes a love affair hallelujah oh those words are precious for me to hear again tonight it's not on my merit it's not on i don't have any assurance that that's enough but i have assurance that as he loves me i love him did you know you couldn't really love him if he didn't love you you couldn't seek after god if he wasn't seeking after you and so i want us to understand yes we have to set ourselves apart from this whole world there's a spirit of the age and a spirit of the world that will take us right down that slippery slope into unbelief yes i believe that yes i believe that a church has a right to have a conviction and set a standard for the body i believe that i believe that that that god speaks to leadership and speaks to pastors and helps them if they're hearing him to know there are certain things that we must do differently here because we've been called to be different but i want you to know nothing all the things that make us different all the things that set us apart none of that is what makes us holy it's god's holy presence it's the spirit of jesus christ in us that makes us holy don't you want more of him don't you want more of the holy ghost don't you want to allow the spirit of holiness to walk down every hallway of your heart every hallway open every door look in every room find anything in there that is not reflecting jesus christ i want the spirit of holiness to convict to speak to show us and then we understand that the holy ghost the same holy ghost that convicts us is the same holy grace same holy ghost that brings the spirit of grace in to give us courage and strength to make a difference to turn loose of things that we have held on to because they are misshaping our character there are things that we just simply have to let go we've carried them so long and they have began to misshape our character and we can't do it on our own but i tell you by the spirit of holiness by the spirit of his grace we can allow him to walk into every room look under every bed search every closet turn the searchlight of his love onto the deepest part of who we are and put his finger on every part that needs more of him i believe if you have a hunger for more of him it's a testimony to us tonight that there's more of him to be had there's more of him available and i want to thank you tonight for joining us in this study together i want us just to yield ourselves to the lord we just open our heart there's a little song i don't know if i can get at a cappella or not but i'll i'll try i'd like to sing with you if you remember lord my heart is open so won't you come inside fill up all my being to a bite i've opened all the windows thrown wide every door lord my heart is open i need you more and more and more sing with me would you lord my heart is open [Music] so won't you come inside fill up all my being i've opened all the windows thrown

you i've had it all but what i need is more of you lord this is our desire tonight that we would make room for you that you would fill us and refill us with your holy ghost lord i ask for grace for every person under the sound of my voice that we might all find grace to yield more to the holy ghost that lives inside of us and if we haven't received the baptism of the holy ghost i'm asking you lord to baptize the believers those who may be seeking a real experience with you lord you're the one who gives you're the one who pours it out some of us have been filled with the baptism of the holy ghost for so many years he's still here he's still real he still abides but lord sometimes we need a refilling we need to just be more yielded to the spirit for we know that if we're led by the spirit of god it testifies that we are the sons of god may the spirit of holiness put its finger on anything in our life oh god deep down that needs to be ministered to that needs to be we need to be freed from father help us to understand that repentance is a gift it's not a given it's a gift and lord once you show us something there may we find grace and courage to repent and that repentance is not begging you that repentance is trusting you it's saying lord i'm so sorry for how i've got off on the wrong track i'm so sorry that i've let something take up space in my life that could be filled with you and i'm asking for your forgiveness and i'm asking that your mercy would come and you would let that holy ghost go into that area drive out all that is unlike you cause me to grow up into who you have called me to be oh this is our desire lord this is our desire let it be o god let it be that there will be answers to these prayers as we agree together i feel sweet presence of the lord i'm so thankful for the sweet spirit of god he could come and really rake us over the coals sometimes he comes with a rebuke but i tell you so much is accomplished when the holy spirit just come and melts us he just softens us when we feel that softening of the holy spirit we just want to yield oh god i want to get out of the way i want bitterness gone i want anger gone i want anything in me that's trying to take a root hold that is not like you i want the holy ghost to dig that up show me what i can do to get rid of that because you are birthing a people into your character oh i thank you lord

healing virtue oh god there were several who sent messages to say that beginning sunday they fell to turn around in their body but lord i'm praying for those that haven't yet experienced a real a real turnaround in their health would you touch them oh god tonight would you go to the root of it would you let that virus die in the name of jesus would you allow their antibodies to raise up oh god i believe you're the creator i believe you can create an infusion of antibodies in everybody that's fighting i know our bodies start creating those but it's sometimes not enough so lord i'm asking you to do what you can do you created these bodies lord i've watched you already bring those through this thing in their 80s so i know that you're concerned and you care for each one who is suffering and so lord i'm asking you that you will let this thing pass from us in the name of the lord jesus christ that we might be gathered together again in person and worship you and sit under your holy precious word we're so thankful for it lord i thank you for those who've labored in any way during this time of stream only to help make an atmosphere that we might reach out and be a blessing and so lord we ask for every one of those needs that we have in our heart for those who are in trouble for those who are backslidden and need to come home to you we're just lifting that all up lord we thank you for making provision for this church and for this ministry in this difficult time and we will give you glory and honor and praise for we ask these things in the exalted name of the lord jesus christ amen and all the saints said amen amen so i want to thank you again for being with us tonight we're giving you a little getting out of here a little early i want you to uh know that we love you we're praying for you not just our own church folks but folks around the world i want to say to our local body that it would just be a great help to us at this time if you would either make arrangements to drop your tithe and offering by the office here or online now many have really been faithful online and you just have to remember that it takes us a week two weeks and sometimes three weeks according to the bank to be able to have those funds to be able to pay bills and do things that we have to do and so if you are able to make arrangements to bring something by then you need to check with one of us and we'll be glad to meet you and and we thank those of you who have done that uh we have a deposit we will be making in the morning because some of you have been doing that and a little bit has come in the mail and god's meeting the need but i just need to remind you that this has been an unusual time now through the whole pandemic i think this is about the longest or maybe equal to the longest it could be that we were i was a little under the weather the last time we had some stream only so it could have been about the same amount of time but it sure feels like a long time that we've been apart but god is good he's faithful and he's keeping us so the lord willing let's gather together those who are able those who are without fever and who are overcoming and out of quarantine those who would like to let's gather together sunday morning at 11 o'clock if anything should change we'll reach out to the local body those of you who stream you stream nothing changes for you we're glad to have you we're streaming on our app on youtube on facebook and on our website and so if you have prayer requests that you want us to pray over you send them and we will do that we just want to say again tonight god bless you thank you for being with us bye-bye until sunday you
