Description:
The blood of God was so powerful that it didn’t just cover, didn’t just hide, but completely removed even the stain of sin, allowing man to partake of His righteousness; a righteousness that man can never attain on his own by keeping the law and offering the right sin offerings. We pray you’ll be blessed by this excerpt from “The Righteous Man Shall Live by Faith (Exile - Part 5).”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] listen the blood of all the Bulls and the Lambs and the goats and and the turtle does and everything else all it could ever do was cover sin and if you remove that blood the sin the same sin the sin that was always there would have been there all along and so what did they have to do they had to come back the next time and bring another offering more blood but every drop of that blood that was spilled was prophesying every time the lamb lost his life every time a goat lost his life every time a turtle Dove's neck was rung and the blood drained out of his body every drop of blood prophesied there's coming a seed there's coming a seed there's coming a seed there's coming a seed there is a blood there is a blood there is a blood this blood will do for now but there is a blood that's coming Hallelujah and when that blood gets here it will not just cover man's sin like a blanket on top but it will so remove as a propitiation for sin it will so remove even the blot even the stain of unrighteousness and because of that blood mankind will be infused with a right ousness of God that he could never attain even if he kept all the works of the law even if he obeyed every commandment in the book of the law he could never be as righteous as he will be when that blood does its job and I want you to know if you came to those Grace Junctions those truth Junctions in your life you didn't come there one minute late [Music] now if God would have had a rather he might would have rather you come earlier but he knew all along when you would finally see that and if God knew from the beginning when you would see that truth or see this truth or the other truth make another step in the right direction if God already knew that how could you be late to the party you got there right on time and that means that even though there was things that you did and believe and and participated in that were not right that were not the best for you they were only types and shadows and and and pieces of Truth all of that you have no guilt before God today somebody should hear me you have no condemnation before God today because if you have found the blood if the blood has found you Hallelujah then all the Wasted Years and all of the mistakes in the journey and any lie that you might have believed and any Twisted truth that you might have embraced and any outward form of righteousness that you might have trusted in instead of the inward work of Grace God knew it and he wants me to tell you it was all right God is not going to say you sorry man how why did it take you so long I've been standing here at this junk waiting on you you drugg your feet you had so much pride that would have been the truth but he's not going to meet me with that he's just going to say I'm so glad you have arrived how do you know that I know that because my sins are not just covered my sins are taken separated as far from me as the East is from the West
