[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right twiced in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New
[1:03] Hope revival ministries and I'm coming
[1:06] to you again today on behalf of brother
[1:09] Eric Erickson and all of the fine folks
[1:12] at the gospel channel you know I don't
[1:14] know if you have missed me or not but I
[1:18] have certainly missed my opportunity to
[1:21] come to you we have had a few weeks of
[1:24] break now and I think some of the
[1:27] programs have been rearing and I hope
[1:29] we're not getting on your nerves by that
[1:31] but would you believe that consistently
[1:34] while we were away not taping regular
[1:37] programs with you we were all the time
[1:41] still receiving prayer requests and
[1:45] testimonies and contact and I want to
[1:48] tell you how encouraging it was and you
[1:52] know sometimes when you call and if it's
[1:55] during our business hours our working
[1:58] hours here someone takes the call and
[2:01] they will often make a note in the
[2:03] computer that they could hear the
[2:05] program in the background and I can't
[2:08] tell you how encouraging that is to us
[2:10] when we come here we come in the name of
[2:13] the Lord and we come to be a blessing we
[2:16] want to teach we want to preach the
[2:18] truth of God's Word but we also just
[2:20] want to be an encouragement to you and
[2:23] this morning earlier I was watching I
[2:27] don't normally do this but sometimes if
[2:29] there's been a break it's a it's a good
[2:31] idea for me to go back and hear the last
[2:34] few minutes of the last program that we
[2:36] recorded and I have to tell you that I
[2:38] really sense the anointing of the Lord
[2:41] coming down at the end of that program
[2:44] as we begin to talk about some of the
[2:46] miracles that we have been blessed to
[2:48] see with our own eyes
[2:50] through the years and a time of prayer
[2:54] that ended the program that was just a
[2:56] real blessing to me and I could sense
[3:00] the anointing of the Lord on it and that
[3:02] was also very encouraging I'm just
[3:04] thankful so many of you wrote to say
[3:07] that you enjoyed the inner
[3:09] used with brother Gerald Hicks his
[3:12] testimony a life that was you know
[3:15] destined really for ruin and failure but
[3:18] by God's grace sometimes we say but God
[3:22] and you know that's what it is we can
[3:25] see that his life would have certainly
[3:27] been different but God he had a
[3:30] different plan I'm just delighted to
[3:33] serve a god like that I am I consider it
[3:37] a real joy to know personally to be
[3:41] intimately acquainted with a god like
[3:44] that who loves us so much and who is so
[3:47] jealous for our destiny that he would do
[3:51] for us for brother Gerald Hicks
[3:54] providing someone to rescue his life as
[3:57] just a little baby to prepare and
[4:00] preserve him for the greater things of
[4:02] God when I look back over my own life
[4:05] and my own testimony and I don't often
[4:08] share anymore the the personal details
[4:12] of my testimony because I realize that
[4:15] in doing so I have at times not with
[4:20] purpose but hurt some of the people who
[4:23] are involved in my life perhaps even
[4:25] including my parents and I wouldn't want
[4:27] to do that but but I can tell you that
[4:30] though the hand of God was on my life
[4:33] from the very beginning there were a lot
[4:36] of heartaches along the way a lot of
[4:38] disappointments a lot of things that
[4:40] could be considered forms of perhaps
[4:43] emotional abuse or but but God he had a
[4:47] plan and he has been faithful and by His
[4:52] grace I want to be faithful to him our
[4:54] lives are different I was told when I
[4:57] was just a small boy by the Lord that my
[5:00] life would be different and that I would
[5:03] experience things that would be
[5:04] difficult to walk through in my younger
[5:07] years but that God would use that he
[5:09] spoke to me I will use the testimony of
[5:12] some of those things and in those
[5:15] earlier years when I felt a little more
[5:16] free to go and speak to young people
[5:19] about my testimony there were
[5:21] Red's maybe thousands of young people
[5:24] who would come and say you know I
[5:25] realize if you could walk through some
[5:28] of the things that you walked through
[5:30] maybe going through the public school
[5:32] system being very very different having
[5:34] strong biblical convictions and you made
[5:37] it by the grace of God coming from a
[5:39] broken home and living through the
[5:43] second marriage of my mother who married
[5:47] a very abusive man and I watched her
[5:49] many many times being beaten almost to
[5:51] the point of death and yet the grace of
[5:53] God preserved me and preserved her
[5:57] because he wanted us to have that
[5:59] opportunity to serve the Lord and to
[6:01] share truth with others and so in those
[6:04] earlier years as I could share that very
[6:06] freely many many people would say this
[6:09] is an encouragement to me and you know
[6:10] what you've got a testimony you've got a
[6:13] testimony you that are holding on to
[6:16] Jesus Christ you've been through some
[6:19] real stuff how do you know that you
[6:22] don't know me well I may not know you
[6:24] personally but I know life I do I
[6:28] understand being a pastor for so many
[6:31] years I'm telling you that your problems
[6:34] may be much different than the one next
[6:36] to you but everybody who's living life
[6:39] on planet Earth we have our difficult
[6:42] trials we have those situations of loss
[6:45] and grief with Hope deferred
[6:48] disappointment and discouragement many
[6:51] of you watching this program have dealt
[6:53] with perhaps most of your life even with
[6:55] heavy depression and it's all you can do
[6:58] to keep pressing through that just to be
[7:01] able to put a smile on your face and
[7:03] sometimes it's a phony smile but it's
[7:05] the best that you can do and yet you
[7:07] survive and in many cases overcome
[7:11] because you have learned to lean on the
[7:14] Lord Jesus Christ and to depend on him
[7:17] and I'm so thankful that we have him I'm
[7:19] so thankful that we're not left here on
[7:22] planet Earth to have to get through to
[7:25] scrape by but God gives us the power of
[7:29] the overcomer if we trust him and we
[7:32] trust his word so let me just say to
[7:35] you know whether you've missed me or not
[7:37] I've really missed you and I'm feel very
[7:40] blessed to be able to come today again
[7:42] and represent the gospel channel what a
[7:45] wonderful work of God is going on
[7:49] through the Ministry of the gospel
[7:50] channel reaching across Europe and all
[7:53] of Scandinavia and I tell you we don't
[7:57] know sometimes really just how far that
[8:00] program is reaching out but we know that
[8:02] many many countries have access and we
[8:05] also believe that through the internet
[8:07] and through YouTube and all of the
[8:09] different media formats that we have
[8:12] today that this ministry the gospel
[8:16] channel we're able to be a blessing to
[8:19] people that we may never meet on planet
[8:23] earth face to face and so today I just
[8:26] want to begin to talk to you I know we
[8:29] won't cover the subject today thoroughly
[8:32] but I'd like to lay a bit of a
[8:34] foundation and I want to talk to you
[8:36] about a series or a subject that I have
[8:38] called schemes and devices you know I
[8:42] believe that there is a literal heaven I
[8:45] believe that God has prepared a place
[8:49] for those of us who trust his grace and
[8:52] who live in surrender to the Scriptures
[8:56] I believe that I believe we who are born
[8:59] again filled with the Holy Spirit of God
[9:02] he said I go to prepare a place for you
[9:05] that where I am you may be there also
[9:08] and I don't believe that that is a
[9:12] imaginary place or it is a symbolic
[9:15] place I believe there is a literal
[9:19] dimension where God has built a home for
[9:23] those of us who trust him I believe it's
[9:26] not too late if you're watching this
[9:29] program and you have not yet trusted the
[9:31] Lord in real repentance for your sins
[9:34] the sins that Jesus has already died for
[9:38] shed his own blood for the remission of
[9:41] those sins but maybe you've not come to
[9:44] him asking for forgiveness and accepting
[9:47] his
[9:47] gift of salvation and if you've not done
[9:50] that yet now is your opportunity because
[9:54] there is a place prepared beyond this
[9:57] life the scripture said if in this life
[10:00] only we had hope we are of all men most
[10:04] miserable and I have to be honest and
[10:07] say that I enjoy life I enjoy living the
[10:12] Christ life even with the aches and the
[10:14] pains and the attacks and and and the
[10:17] heartaches that come along with everyday
[10:19] life but I enjoy serving the Lord
[10:23] you know I sing all the time it's been
[10:27] it's been a little tool that that I have
[10:29] used since I was just a small boy and
[10:32] sometimes when stuff is so you know
[10:35] haywire it just you feel like you're
[10:39] being pressed in the phone calls won't
[10:41] stop and the needs are great and you
[10:47] just don't know how to get through so
[10:49] sometimes I'll just start singing a song
[10:51] there was a song that was particularly a
[10:55] blessing to me many years ago when I was
[10:57] in I would say the darkest trial of my
[10:59] life it was an old hymn of the church
[11:02] some through the water some through the
[11:05] flood some through the fire but all
[11:08] through the blood God leads his dear
[11:12] children along and he does he is
[11:15] faithful to lead us through so maybe I
[11:18] don't know why I said that maybe I said
[11:20] that for somebody who's watching this
[11:22] program right now and you're in a dark
[11:24] trial and you're thinking how I'm ever
[11:25] going to get through it why don't you
[11:27] just belt out a song you don't have to
[11:29] be a great singer the Bible said make a
[11:32] joyful noise and to the Lord well what
[11:34] will people think about me well they'll
[11:36] just have to deal with it you may not be
[11:38] able to do it if you're sitting at your
[11:40] desk at work but your family will just
[11:42] have to put up with you you know for
[11:44] many many years the Lord has given me a
[11:47] gift and that is I wake up every morning
[11:49] with those lyrics of a song running
[11:53] through my mind and you'd be surprised
[11:55] sometimes I will get out of bed and
[11:58] write the words of the song down just to
[12:00] little bit of it and you'd be surprised
[12:02] how many times through the day my mind
[12:05] goes back to that song and I think well
[12:07] that's the reason why that was on my
[12:08] heart you know the Bible talks about the
[12:10] Lord singing over us so I just believe
[12:14] that in every temptation in every dark
[12:17] trial in every situation that we go
[12:19] through the Lord offers us a way of
[12:21] escape oftentimes it's prayer oftentimes
[12:25] it is simply remembering and rehearsing
[12:29] the faithfulness of God so God has
[12:32] definitely provided various ways to help
[12:36] us get through the storms we can pray we
[12:40] can praise we can sing you know we can
[12:44] even dance I'm telling you there are
[12:47] times when the battle rages that it is
[12:50] not a bad idea just to dance before the
[12:53] Lord like the psalmist said you can do
[12:56] it right in your living room just throw
[12:58] up your hands and you know just dance a
[13:01] jig unto the Lord it's a way to praise
[13:04] Him it's a way to say my mind is going
[13:08] to be focused on you Lord no matter
[13:11] what's going on around me I may be
[13:13] distracted by my circumstances but I'm
[13:16] not going to be arrested by my
[13:18] circumstances I think one of the ways
[13:21] that we can overcome in this hour is to
[13:24] learn the ways that the enemy brings
[13:28] attack against us in our lives
[13:31] and so I want to begin this subject and
[13:35] you know I know that there's a lot of
[13:37] people who really they think if if we if
[13:40] we start examining the ways the enemy
[13:43] works that we're just kind of opening up
[13:45] our life or more attack but I don't look
[13:48] at it that way at all because the
[13:50] scriptures are clear we need to know
[13:52] what's going on and we need to be able
[13:55] to recognize what's happening is this
[13:59] just my emotions or is this a spiritual
[14:03] attack that I need to to be on the
[14:06] defense against that I need to do to go
[14:09] to prayer that I need to dig
[14:11] the word and overcome this situation you
[14:17] know the scripture talks about our
[14:19] adversary and how he operates and I'd
[14:22] like to look at a scripture with you in
[14:24] first Peter chapter 5 verse 7 and 8 and
[14:28] I know you're going to be familiar with
[14:30] these verses of Scripture casting all
[14:33] your care upon him that's easier said
[14:37] than done but all what relief what
[14:41] relief we can experience when we obey
[14:44] this verse of scripture casting all your
[14:47] care upon him for he careth for you
[14:53] the Amplified Bible takes verse 7 and
[14:57] translates it this way casting the whole
[15:01] of your care all your anxieties all your
[15:06] worries all your concerns once and for
[15:12] all on him hallelujah for he cares for
[15:16] you affectionately and cares about you
[15:22] watchfully can I read it again
[15:25] casting the whole of your care all your
[15:27] anxieties all your worries all your
[15:30] concerns once and for all on him for he
[15:34] cares for you affectionately and cares
[15:37] about you watchfully isn't that
[15:41] encouraging that he's inviting me to
[15:46] take all of my care my worry my anxiety
[15:49] my deep concerns and cast them this is a
[15:54] physical word cast them on him
[15:58] and I think that perhaps the writer used
[16:04] this word cast because it's not an
[16:08] automatic thing it's not just shaking
[16:11] ourselves and expecting that all of our
[16:13] worries are gonna fall off of us I think
[16:15] it's intentional I think it requires
[16:18] focus and intent to be able to wrap
[16:22] those cares anxieties worry
[16:25] troubles all up into one package and
[16:28] totally throw them on the shoulders of
[16:33] the Lord I believe that it's a powerful
[16:37] phrase here once and for all
[16:39] because I believe ultimately that's what
[16:42] we have to do but I've got a feeling
[16:45] that we're going to feel them again at
[16:48] times we're going to be reminded of them
[16:51] at times in fact we're gonna try to pick
[16:54] them up and carry them again even though
[16:56] we've given them to the Lord to bear the
[16:59] burden to carry the weight I have a
[17:01] feeling that as situations continue to
[17:04] squeeze we're gonna find ourselves again
[17:07] overthinking trying to sort it out even
[17:12] sometimes trying to tell God how to do
[17:14] it and we'll have to be reminded again
[17:17] perhaps by the Holy Spirit or maybe we
[17:21] will write these words on our bathroom
[17:24] mirror or on our refrigerator at least
[17:28] we need to hide them in our heart so
[17:31] that we can be reminded of them again
[17:34] his desire his love his care his concern
[17:38] for us compels him to want to carry
[17:43] every one of our cares
[17:45] I believe it's well placed the next
[17:49] verse in the King James the next verse 8
[17:53] be sober be vigilant because your
[17:57] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[18:02] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[18:07] your adversary the enemy of your soul
[18:12] life the one who wants to ultimately cut
[18:17] you off from the goodness of God and
[18:20] because our enemy is full of intention
[18:24] full of purpose full of ambition he has
[18:28] a plan already calculated against us the
[18:31] scripture is admonishing us to be sober
[18:36] to be a
[18:37] word to be awake it's easy sometimes to
[18:41] fall into a place of complacency but in
[18:45] this hour we're living in the end time
[18:48] and the attack of Satan against the
[18:52] believer seemingly has intensified in
[18:55] this hour and there is no nap time
[18:58] spiritually there's no time to take a
[19:01] spiritual siesta we've got to stay awake
[19:04] and alert and watch for the ways that
[19:08] the enemy is moving against us in this
[19:10] hour
[19:11] remember this brother sister we do not
[19:14] face our enemy alone I have a feeling
[19:18] that in our own ability most of us would
[19:21] fall short
[19:22] being able to completely push back
[19:27] encounter the enemy but thanks be to God
[19:30] we're not doing it on our own it's not
[19:32] in our own power it's not using our own
[19:35] giftings or intelligence it's with the
[19:38] strength of the Lord the Amplified Bible
[19:41] takes verse 8 like this be well-balanced
[19:49] temperent
[19:50] sober of mind be vigilant and cautious
[19:55] at all times for that enemy of yours the
[19:58] devil roams around like a lion roaring
[20:02] in fierce hunger seeking someone to
[20:07] seize upon and devour
[20:10] thanks be to God though he cannot if we
[20:15] learn who our warrior is the Lord
[20:18] Himself will go to battle on our behalf
[20:21] if we get out of his way we put our
[20:25] trust in him we have to learn to take
[20:28] our hands off the situation sometimes
[20:31] you know there's a great temptation to
[20:34] be a problem solver in every situation I
[20:37] just want to fix it Lord just help me
[20:41] fix it but sometimes I'm operating out
[20:44] of my soul my mind my will my emotions
[20:48] and I'm not all
[20:49] operating out of the holy spirit that
[20:52] has transformed my human spirit he sits
[20:56] on the inside of the inside desiring to
[20:59] rule and reign through my soul and body
[21:02] and sometimes we get caught up in the
[21:06] swirl of what we're going through
[21:08] and again we're busy busy trying to sort
[21:11] it out and fix it telling everybody what
[21:13] to do and how to do you go there you do
[21:16] that you need to do the other when
[21:18] really it would be of our best interest
[21:21] to just let go sometime and let God give
[21:26] us leadership and guidance I don't know
[21:28] about you but I've experienced that so
[21:30] many times in my life and then looked
[21:32] back and thought to myself that's not
[21:35] how I would have handled it and look
[21:37] what a mess
[21:38] it would have been but because I trusted
[21:42] in the Lord I put my confidence in him I
[21:45] did everything I could to cast it on him
[21:47] and leave it there not pick it up and
[21:49] try to do it myself again and because of
[21:52] that often times I've been able to say
[21:55] blessed be the name of the Lord
[21:56] look how God moved in and took care of
[22:01] the situation and then back to the King
[22:04] James verse 9 first Peter 5:7 9 says
[22:08] whom resist
[22:09] that's that adversary who operates as a
[22:14] roaring lion
[22:15] now notice he's the counterfeit here
[22:18] because there is a lion there's a true
[22:21] lion in your life the Lion of the tribe
[22:25] of Judah don't you remember in
[22:28] Revelation chapter 5 when the the book
[22:33] is in the hand of the one who sat on the
[22:35] throne and a search was made in heaven
[22:39] for one who would be worthy to take that
[22:41] book and loosed the seven seals thereof
[22:43] and John was weeping the elders were
[22:47] weeping where where will there be one
[22:49] found and all of a sudden a voice cried
[22:52] out the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[22:55] prevailed to take the book and to loose
[22:58] the seals thereof and
[23:00] from the midst of the throne appeared a
[23:02] lamb and I will want you to be fooled by
[23:05] that lamb that lamb was the sacrificial
[23:08] lamb but your lamb is a lion Jesus
[23:12] Christ Yeshua our Messiah our lamb is
[23:16] the lion he is the lion the Lion of the
[23:20] tribe of Judah and I'm telling you when
[23:23] things get really rough in your life and
[23:26] you surrender to him
[23:28] sometimes you're weeping and sobbing and
[23:30] just pouring it out before the Lord you
[23:33] just wait there are times that your lion
[23:37] looks down and sees what you're going
[23:39] through and he roars and I want you to
[23:42] know that when the lion the king of the
[23:44] jungle the natural lion when he roars I
[23:47] want you to know that everything in that
[23:50] jungle runs from the roar
[23:52] it shakes the jungle when the lion roars
[23:56] and you just wait until your lion the
[24:00] lion of the tribe of Judah wait until he
[24:03] roars into your situation breathes his
[24:06] spirit life into your situation watch
[24:10] and see if demons won't flee watch and
[24:13] see if they won't scatter watch and see
[24:16] if your situation won't begin to turn
[24:18] around because I'm telling you when the
[24:20] Lion of Judah roars the angels of God
[24:23] are dispatched from heavenly places to
[24:27] begin to move in unbelievable ways
[24:30] sometimes ways that we can't really see
[24:34] with our eyes but we can perceive in our
[24:37] spirit the angels of the Lord are moving
[24:40] I don't have to say that I don't believe
[24:43] in worshipping angels venerating angels
[24:46] looking up to angels but I want you to
[24:48] know I give thanks to God I'm not
[24:51] ashamed to tell you I give thanks to God
[24:53] today for holy angels that he has
[24:56] created to assist and serve the Saints I
[24:59] want to thank the Lord that he has
[25:01] angels that are commissioned to move
[25:04] when the children of God are crying out
[25:07] to him in prayer he said he would give
[25:10] his angels charge over us
[25:12] to watch over us and keep us lest we
[25:15] would even - our foot against a stone
[25:17] can I just tell you I'm getting pretty
[25:20] excited here can I just tell you that
[25:23] you're not alone in this fight you are
[25:26] not alone on this journey of life it's
[25:30] true you've got an enemy Satan is your
[25:33] adversary it's true that their demon
[25:37] spirits imps of hell that are dispatched
[25:40] against you from the kingdom of darkness
[25:42] but you are not alone and you are not
[25:46] facing the darkness alone you serve the
[25:49] only true Living God there is no other
[25:53] god but our God the God of the Bible the
[25:59] god that we call in English Jehovah I
[26:02] want you to know he is bigger than any
[26:05] name that we can give him any
[26:08] description that we can give him but he
[26:10] is the Lion of the tribe of Judah Lord I
[26:13] I ask you right now for those watching
[26:18] this program that seemed overwhelmed
[26:21] that feel overwhelmed by the darkness
[26:23] I'm asking you Lord to look upon them
[26:26] now see their heart see their life hear
[26:30] their hearts cry to you and I'm asking
[26:33] you according to your will would you
[26:36] please roar into that situation would
[26:40] you release your spirit life into that
[26:43] home right now where sickness has
[26:46] prevailed where bondage addiction has
[26:50] prevailed where depression has prevailed
[26:52] I'm asking you old great God roar
[26:56] against the enemy as you promised that
[26:58] you would we thank you for it Lord we
[27:03] thank you for it Lord again verse 9
[27:06] tells us whom resist steadfast in the
[27:10] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[27:12] are accomplished in your brethren that
[27:15] are in the world that may be of little
[27:18] comfort to you right now but you're not
[27:21] the only one that has an X of painted on
[27:25] your life
[27:26] you're not the only one marked you're
[27:29] not the only one picked out to be picked
[27:31] on I want you to know that these
[27:35] afflictions are common to the lives of
[27:38] the children of God because there's a
[27:41] battle going on that's bigger than a
[27:43] political battle or a racial battle
[27:45] there's a battle that's going on in the
[27:48] heavenlies between the kingdom of light
[27:50] and the kingdom of darkness between the
[27:53] one true Living God and his adversary I
[27:57] want you to know that when we boil all
[27:59] of this down the devil we always say you
[28:03] know he's our enemy he's our adversary
[28:05] but when we boil this down
[28:08] he is the adversary of God and I'm
[28:11] telling you he comes up short against
[28:14] the God that I know and yet he continues
[28:18] to rage and isn't it amazing that our
[28:21] God the one who has manifested himself
[28:25] as the Lion of the tribe of Judah his
[28:28] enemy operates as a roaring lion can you
[28:34] see that counterfeit can you see that
[28:38] imposter that impersonator why don't you
[28:41] call him out right now in your life why
[28:44] don't you recognize what he's trying to
[28:47] do he's trying to stand between you and
[28:51] the true lion of the tribe of Judah he's
[28:54] trying to distract you with his house
[28:57] but he is not the roaring lion he only
[29:02] operates as a roaring lion and we have
[29:07] this promise if we are steadfast in the
[29:09] faith we can rest assure we're not the
[29:13] only one going through this kind of a
[29:15] battle our brethren the saints of God
[29:18] around the world in every nation of the
[29:21] world we're all experiencing our portion
[29:24] of this warfare but I just like to tell
[29:27] the atmosphere Jesus Yeshua the Messiah
[29:31] is the victor he
[29:36] is the victory no matter what the battle
[29:39] is he is the victory we sometimes say
[29:43] and some people think it's kind of a
[29:45] corny statement but it still means a lot
[29:48] to me I've read the back of the book I
[29:51] know how this story ends I know how the
[29:55] enemy is bound I know the bottomless pit
[29:59] he tumbles in for a thousand years I
[30:01] know that he gets that second short
[30:04] little chance at the end where he's
[30:07] loosed a short time against the nation's
[30:09] but I also know that ultimately he is
[30:12] cast in to hell I also know that as a
[30:16] created being I don't want to upset your
[30:18] theology but I also know that as a
[30:21] created being there comes a time that he
[30:24] no longer exists so his time is limited
[30:28] he has an expiration date no wonder he
[30:33] moves with such fierceness no wonder he
[30:36] howls and moans and roars no wonder he
[30:40] throws every fiery dart and arrow
[30:43] against you that he possibly can but the
[30:46] purpose of what we're going to study is
[30:48] not to glorify the enemy it's not to
[30:52] exalt him but it's so that we might have
[30:56] understanding of how he operates and how
[31:00] we can walk in victory that has already
[31:04] been acquired for us it is not up to you
[31:09] and I to win the victory it's up to you
[31:12] and I to appropriate the victory Jesus
[31:16] is the victor Jesus is the Lamb who was
[31:20] found worthy to open up the book and
[31:23] reveal the whole plan of redemption the
[31:27] enemy is one player Satan Lucifer that
[31:31] old devil whatever you want to call him
[31:33] whatever name you want to give him
[31:35] Beelzebub Lord of the Flies whatever
[31:38] your your thought process is in giving
[31:41] him a name I came from old fashioned
[31:45] Pentecost and some of the old Saints
[31:47] would would call him
[31:49] souffl it I remember one preacher coming
[31:53] and he knew his name to be Lucifer and
[31:56] he preached all fifteen minutes of his
[32:00] sermon talking about how wicked Lucy was
[32:02] he'd just give him a nickname and called
[32:05] him Lucy well I want you to know that
[32:08] didn't go over too good you know why
[32:10] this was an evangelist preaching do you
[32:13] know what the pastor's mother-in-law's
[32:14] name was Lucy and so when that preacher
[32:18] was getting up and he was talking about
[32:20] how good-for-nothing Lucy was well
[32:23] everybody had a hard time to hold steady
[32:26] and not fall in the floor laughing
[32:28] because they knew that was the pastor's
[32:30] mother-in-law so I I advise you maybe to
[32:32] choose another more biblical name for
[32:34] the devil but whatever you call him he
[32:37] is defeated and he's just one little
[32:41] part of this whole economy of God I love
[32:45] what William Branham said a great
[32:48] healing evangelists and truly a prophet
[32:51] of God one generation ago he said Satan
[32:55] is a tool in the hand of God to perfect
[33:00] the Saints I love that it shrinks the
[33:05] enemy in my mind when I hear that
[33:08] statement when I recognize that he is
[33:11] only allowed to do what God decides he
[33:18] his power is limited and did you know
[33:22] that some of that power that we see the
[33:25] enemy operating in in fact is power that
[33:28] we have relinquished power that we have
[33:31] handed over to him because we didn't
[33:34] know how he was operating here's a
[33:37] scripture if perhaps you're thinking I
[33:39] don't want to hear two or three programs
[33:42] on the schemes and devices of the enemy
[33:44] I'd rather hear about the Lord well I
[33:47] think that's wonderful I'm gonna try my
[33:49] best to speak and teach and preach about
[33:52] the Lord in these programs but I here's
[33:55] the scripture to consider second
[33:57] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 lest
[34:01] seyton should get an advantage of us for
[34:06] we are not ignorant of his devices if we
[34:12] are ignorant
[34:13] if we fail not to learn or to understand
[34:16] if we decide I'm going to pretend like
[34:19] the devil doesn't exist I'm going to
[34:21] shut my eyes and plug up my ears and I'm
[34:24] going to pretend like there is no devil
[34:26] I know there are people who don't
[34:28] believe that there's a literal Satan
[34:30] these are the same people who don't
[34:33] believe there's a literal hell and many
[34:35] of them don't believe there's a literal
[34:37] heaven and some of them they're not even
[34:40] sure that there's a literal God but I
[34:43] don't understand I'm honest and sincere
[34:46] when I say I don't understand how
[34:49] someone could look at creation even the
[34:52] human body and not believe that there is
[34:56] some divine creator there is an
[34:59] intelligence that is way beyond what we
[35:03] know as mankind a divine creator the
[35:08] Living God the God of the Bible who
[35:12] knows who sees and who understands the
[35:16] enemy again a piece of the plan a piece
[35:18] of the puzzle a part in the endtime
[35:21] drama but not the main focus however if
[35:25] we are not learning alert aware of how
[35:32] the enemy works then we are in a
[35:36] position where the enemy can get
[35:39] advantage or take advantage of us lest
[35:42] Satan should get an advantage of us we
[35:46] are not ignorant of his devices we must
[35:50] understand his schemes we must
[35:52] understand his seductions we must
[35:55] understand his devices do you remember
[35:58] the precious saint of God from the
[36:01] wonderful book and movie the
[36:04] hiding-place
[36:05] mrs. Corrie ten Boom do you remember her
[36:11] story do you remember how that her
[36:14] family
[36:14] was locked away in the concentration
[36:18] camps because they were hiding precious
[36:20] Jewish people from being exterminated
[36:23] and Bessey's father died in the
[36:28] concentration camp her sister Bessie
[36:31] died in the concentration camp other
[36:34] members of the family died in the
[36:36] concentration camp but by the grace of
[36:40] God Corrie survived and not only
[36:43] survived lived many years teaching a
[36:48] message of forgiveness going all over
[36:52] the world even helping in a movement to
[36:55] turn some of those concentration camps
[36:59] of Europe into beautiful homes of
[37:02] healing and help to care for the sick
[37:05] and for the elderly and she wrote some
[37:09] beautiful books some beautiful poetry
[37:11] sir beautiful stories I have several
[37:14] books written by Corrie ten Boom
[37:16] including part of her life travels her
[37:19] life story called a for the Lord
[37:21] and she said something about the enemy
[37:24] that I think's really really good and
[37:27] I'd like to share that with you she said
[37:29] it's a poor soldier indeed who does not
[37:35] recognize the enemy it's a poor soldier
[37:39] indeed who does not recognize the enemy
[37:43] I think that anyone who has ever read
[37:46] perhaps a book about war a book about
[37:50] military movements maybe the life story
[37:55] of a great general a great leader I
[37:59] think you would know that it's often
[38:02] mentioned that part of winning the
[38:07] battle part of winning the war is
[38:10] studying the enemy learning how he
[38:14] thinks how he operates you know the one
[38:18] thing we can thank God for about our
[38:20] enemy is he only has one bag of tricks
[38:23] and he may he may change the color of
[38:27] some
[38:27] he may change the characters in in the
[38:30] drama but really he does not have an
[38:33] endless what would you call supply he
[38:40] doesn't have an endless supply of ways
[38:42] to move against us in our lives in fact
[38:45] it's very limited there's nothing new
[38:47] under the heaven he just does the same
[38:49] thing that he's always been doing and
[38:52] really situations are different and
[38:55] again the actors and the drama are
[38:57] different sometimes it's our close
[38:59] family members that we love sometimes
[39:01] it's folks on our job it's all kinds of
[39:04] things you know and the enemy wants to
[39:07] get us focused on the on the people that
[39:09] are being used instead of the spirit the
[39:11] force that's behind that's the enemy
[39:14] again that's one of his tactics if he
[39:17] can get us focused on fighting one
[39:19] another then we're not fighting against
[39:22] him we're not pushing a back against the
[39:24] enemy and so Corrie ten Boom was helping
[39:28] us to know you if you're gonna if you're
[39:30] gonna defeat the enemy if you're gonna
[39:32] be a true soldier in the army of the
[39:34] Lord it's a good idea to know who your
[39:38] enemy is and how he operates because
[39:41] it's a given that we must know where our
[39:45] victory comes from it certainly comes
[39:47] from the Lord one thing that most of us
[39:51] have learned on our Christian journey is
[39:54] that Satan hates exposure he will go to
[39:58] any extreme to remain hidden in every
[40:02] situation and circumstance of our life
[40:04] and that's why he often has us focusing
[40:07] on how we were raised how we were
[40:10] brought up everybody's against us you
[40:13] know how wronged we have been and so we
[40:16] put names on it and we blame family
[40:19] members or bosses on our job or our
[40:21] people that wouldn't give us a chance
[40:23] and and what happens is the enemy just
[40:26] hiding in all those circumstances if you
[40:29] would recognize that we are not fighting
[40:32] flesh and blood we are not fighting one
[40:35] another but rat
[40:36] the principalities and powers spiritual
[40:39] wickedness in high places turn your
[40:42] attention against the enemy the true
[40:44] enemy pray to God cry out for help
[40:47] resist the enemy rebuke him use the Word
[40:51] of God against him if we would begin to
[40:53] do that shift our focus from the people
[40:55] involved and and the circumstances of
[40:59] the battle and put our focus on
[41:01] defeating the enemy through the blood
[41:03] through the word and through the name if
[41:06] we would do that we would begin to
[41:09] overcome I mean real overcoming power I
[41:14] truly believe that right now on planet
[41:17] Earth there is an elected remnant bride
[41:20] that we are being dressed in the spirit
[41:24] we are being dressed with the garments
[41:26] of the overcomer the fine linen of the
[41:29] saints which is the righteousness of God
[41:31] and as we yield more and more to the
[41:34] Lord in every circumstance of our life
[41:36] every test every trial every moment in
[41:39] the fiery furnace we are being raised up
[41:42] higher and higher and higher into him
[41:45] and so if the enemy can keep us you know
[41:49] occupied with all the little pieces and
[41:52] the details you know I don't know why
[41:55] I'm saying this but the enemy would like
[41:57] to get you hung up in the middle of
[41:59] he-said she-said remember what you did
[42:02] remember what you said remember how you
[42:04] acted back then you remember what what
[42:07] you that's his trick and then he just
[42:10] sort of sits over in the corner and
[42:12] we're mad at each other and we're not
[42:14] fighting the real enemy my god saints of
[42:17] God let's rally ourselves let's let's
[42:20] have our eyes open today let's begin to
[42:23] put the name of Jesus against that enemy
[42:25] and say you're defeated you filthy
[42:28] imposter
[42:29] you take your roaring somewhere else I'm
[42:32] calling on the line of the tribe of
[42:34] Judah I think most of you know of the
[42:38] great CS Lewis who wrote many many
[42:41] profound statements many profound books
[42:44] a lot of you are familiar with with the
[42:48] the
[42:49] Gauri's of of the narnia you know the
[42:53] the series about narnia The Lion the
[42:56] Witch and the Wardrobe etc I know that
[42:59] some Christians resist and they they
[43:01] don't completely understand the purpose
[43:03] of those books but I tell you there is a
[43:05] lot of truth that's that's hidden in
[43:08] that writing it was written that way for
[43:10] a purpose but I think a lot of you are
[43:13] familiar with the book that SIA CS Lewis
[43:15] wrote entitled the Screwtape Letters and
[43:19] in that book he said this Satan's
[43:24] cleverest trick is to convince the world
[43:28] that he does not exist I'm telling you
[43:32] that is simple and yet very very
[43:35] profound what a clever enemy he has
[43:39] convinced so many people that he doesn't
[43:42] exist I've heard many people say there's
[43:45] no real devil there's no real enemy
[43:47] that's just that's just the the nature
[43:49] of man is is there's evil in the very
[43:53] nature of man and that just comes out
[43:56] and that's why men hate and that's why
[43:58] men murder and that's why men kill well
[44:01] I want you to know there's truth to the
[44:03] Fallen nature of man absolutely
[44:05] but there is a driving force behind the
[44:10] Fallen nature of man there is an enemy
[44:13] who operates in hatred who operates in
[44:16] murder who operates in in jealousy and
[44:19] strife he operates that way and he
[44:23] anoints just like we know there is a
[44:25] true anointing from the Holy Ghost of
[44:28] God the enemy also anoints people
[44:31] influences people to operate on his
[44:35] behalf I want you to know the enemy will
[44:38] use anybody and everybody that's willing
[44:40] to be used he's not just using people in
[44:44] mass murders and in terrorism and so
[44:47] forth he'll use your loved ones he'll
[44:50] use people that love you people that you
[44:54] care about to bring attack to your life
[44:58] we're so quick to cut people out of our
[45:00] lives
[45:01] not recognizing that it's not flesh and
[45:05] blood we're fighting here it's something
[45:07] much much bigger than that
[45:09] and so here's this clever sneaky devil
[45:13] convincing people that he doesn't even
[45:16] exist by perpetuating this lie that
[45:20] there is no devil that he doesn't exist
[45:22] he's able many times to sneak up behind
[45:25] God's creation and whisper accusations
[45:29] that cost men and women to blame each
[45:32] other and to blame their circumstances
[45:35] instead of turning their their wrath
[45:39] against the one who is really
[45:41] responsible for what's going on the
[45:43] enemy so who is your enemy it's not
[45:46] people it's not your government it's not
[45:50] some political party your enemy was once
[45:54] a created cherubim that covereth he was
[45:59] once a part of heavens angelic hosts but
[46:04] now he is Satan and here are some
[46:07] scriptures that you can look at if you
[46:09] want to just put them down Isaiah 14
[46:13] verses 12 through 14 Ephesians 6:12 2nd
[46:18] Peter 2:4 and Jude verse 6 we may look
[46:21] at some of these verses
[46:22] at another time but I thought you might
[46:25] want to have them and look over them for
[46:28] yourself though when we looked at
[46:30] Webster's dictionary concerning the word
[46:34] enemy it is defined as a hostile force
[46:38] or power that has destructive effects
[46:42] when we look at the word enemy that's
[46:45] used in our Bible the Hebrew word for
[46:48] enemy in the Old Testament can mean a
[46:52] foe an enemy one who is awake and that's
[46:58] that's evermore the reason why you and I
[47:00] have to be awake because the enemy is
[47:02] awake that's why we have to be watchful
[47:05] because the enemy is watchful he's not
[47:08] laying down doing nothing in this hour
[47:11] he is busy it also means from the Hebrew
[47:14] an adversary or a de-stressor one
[47:18] standing against or hating an observer
[47:22] or one who is critically watching and I
[47:24] guarantee you the enemy your enemy Satan
[47:27] the devil is critically watching your
[47:30] life he's waiting for you to manifest
[47:33] unbelief he's waiting for you to speak
[47:37] out of your mouth your own doubt he's
[47:40] waiting to take advantage of you in that
[47:43] vulnerable moment when you feel
[47:45] overwhelmed when you feel like you're
[47:47] not going to be able to press on and you
[47:49] begin to confess that you know in the
[47:53] south we have so many expressions and
[47:55] some of them we need to absolutely cut
[47:57] out of our vocabulary here in the in the
[48:00] southern part of the United States we
[48:02] say things and you say well that's just
[48:04] it is just an expression but because the
[48:07] Bible says there's a power there's life
[48:10] and death and the words I think we need
[48:12] to I know I let me just say me let me
[48:15] preach to me let me help help myself a
[48:17] little bit here we need to be more
[48:19] careful in the South when someone just
[48:22] say for instance their feet are hurting
[48:23] they'll say oh my feet are killing me
[48:26] all my head is killing me
[48:29] and I know it's just an expression and I
[48:32] know sometimes a headache and especially
[48:35] painful feet can make you feel near to
[48:39] death
[48:39] but that's not the truth your headache
[48:42] is not killing you it's not pleasant
[48:45] it's not something you want to welcome
[48:47] invite in your feet may be painful they
[48:50] may be sore you may feel like you need
[48:53] to sit down and rub them or soak them or
[48:55] whatever but they're not killing you
[48:57] there's power in your words I believe
[49:00] when we begin to recognize that our
[49:02] enemy is watching very critically very
[49:07] fervently critiquing watching waiting
[49:11] for you and I to express some bit of
[49:14] unbelief some bit of doubt in God in
[49:17] God's Word to agree he's constantly
[49:21] speaking lies into our lives and he's
[49:25] waiting most of the time the enemy come
[49:27] with a lie and we disagree we disagree
[49:29] no that's IIIi refuse that I reject that
[49:33] I will not come into agreement with that
[49:35] but when the pressure is on when the
[49:39] furnace is turned up seven times hotter
[49:41] in your life the enemy knows he keeps he
[49:46] keeps working hoping that you will be
[49:49] overwhelmed and that you will begin to
[49:51] confess with your mouth what what is
[49:54] stirring around in your emotions and in
[49:57] your soul life and you'll begin to
[50:00] confess with your mouth doubt in God's
[50:03] ability to get you through this thing
[50:05] I'm not going to make it I can't take
[50:07] listen here's one that we often say and
[50:09] maybe maybe even across the pond maybe
[50:13] you're watching this program and this is
[50:14] an expression that you would use you
[50:16] know I can't I'm not gonna make it I
[50:19] can't make it I can't take this anymore
[50:21] I just I won't be able to go on like
[50:25] this I want you to know that I
[50:28] understand and I can empathize with that
[50:31] kind of an emotion I can't take it
[50:34] anymore I can empathize with that
[50:37] thought with that feeling and with that
[50:40] emotion but I want you to know that is a
[50:43] lie of the devil a lie from your enemy
[50:47] you couldn't take it in the first place
[50:50] but greater is He that is in you than he
[50:55] that is in the world no matter how dark
[50:58] how hot how how pressure do you feel
[51:03] right now if in this moment of test you
[51:08] can cast this care on the Lord because
[51:12] he cares for you you will make it he
[51:16] will strengthen you
[51:17] he will undergird you he will encourage
[51:20] you and he will see you through so we
[51:25] have to keep reminding ourselves
[51:26] sometime who the enemy is and that he is
[51:30] watching and listening to every action
[51:33] and
[51:33] every word to catch us in that moment
[51:37] where we agree with him instead of the
[51:39] truth of God's Word because once that
[51:42] happens he gets the advantage he gets
[51:45] what we call the upper hand as long as
[51:47] you're standing on God's Word and
[51:49] confessing the truth of God's Word that
[51:52] enemy is shrunk in the situation he
[51:56] shrunk but when we agree with him I want
[52:01] you to know he just gets larger and
[52:03] larger and he takes more and more
[52:04] Liberty in our lives even in the army of
[52:08] god soldiers often will fight against
[52:11] each other churches against one another
[52:14] of people against one another even in
[52:17] the body of Christ and what we're doing
[52:20] when we're fighting each other instead
[52:22] of penetrating the enemy's camp to
[52:25] deliver hostages who are bound by the
[52:27] yoke of oppression and floundering in
[52:30] his hopeless den of darkness and what is
[52:33] the church doing fighting one another
[52:35] this is not a time to fight one another
[52:38] this is a time to stand together on the
[52:42] promises of God's Word there was a
[52:46] famous Indian chief in the history of
[52:48] the United States his name was Chief
[52:50] Joseph many people believed that he was
[52:54] a traitor to his own people because he
[52:56] made a league with the with the
[52:58] government of the United States to help
[53:00] bring the Indians into their into their
[53:03] places of reservation because there was
[53:06] such battles going on and we all know
[53:09] that the Native American people were
[53:11] treated very unfairly in the history of
[53:14] the United States we acknowledge that
[53:17] completely part of my heritage is from
[53:20] the tribe of the Cherokee Indians and
[53:22] and we know from history but there were
[53:26] many proud strong brave Indian tribes in
[53:31] America we couldn't say Native American
[53:34] tribes in this nation and they were
[53:37] strong they had strong leadership and
[53:39] many of them were hostile many of them
[53:43] carried out deeds that were we
[53:46] vicious but but many of them are
[53:49] fighting for survival their land was
[53:52] being taken etc and when Chief Joseph
[53:56] was appointed to to be a chief of the
[53:58] nations to be a representative of all of
[54:02] the different fragments of the Native
[54:04] American tribes he said this very
[54:07] important statement and it could also be
[54:10] said about the body of Christ
[54:12] unfortunately we were once a proud
[54:14] Braves strong people of many different
[54:19] tribes but United in in our desire to
[54:24] preserve but we fought too many
[54:29] insignificant Wars battles among
[54:32] ourselves
[54:33] so that when the real enemy came which
[54:36] in this case was the was the the
[54:38] pioneers and the American government and
[54:41] the founding of the new nation what they
[54:44] would eventually do to the Native
[54:45] American people when the real enemy came
[54:48] he said we were too weak to stand
[54:52] against the enemy and I'm telling you
[54:55] this is such a true statement it has
[54:57] become the truth also concerning the
[55:00] body of Christ that we have fought
[55:02] against one another instead of searching
[55:05] out the truth for ourselves we have held
[55:09] on to traditions that are anti word and
[55:14] fought those who desire to take us back
[55:17] to the word we have denominated
[55:21] ourselves divided ourselves and fought
[55:24] against one another until in many cases
[55:27] and in many places the body of Christ
[55:29] has spent more effort fighting each
[55:32] other so that we have allowed our enemy
[55:36] to set in the corner somewhere not
[55:39] realizing he's the one to blame if we're
[55:43] fighting one another then we're not
[55:44] fighting the real enemy I would just
[55:47] encourage you in this hour that we live
[55:50] in right now to recognize the schemes
[55:54] and devices of the devil stand strong in
[55:57] the power of God
[55:59] word pray for one another minister to
[56:03] one another realize that you are not
[56:06] going under if you're holding on to the
[56:09] strong hand of God we prayed
[56:12] spontaneously earlier in this in the
[56:15] program but let me just pray again just

[56:29] strength to stand against the real enemy
[56:31] of their soul may they not be distracted
[56:34] by the bickering of of one another may
[56:37] they not be caught up in the family
[56:39] feud's may they not be caught up in
[56:41] political arguments until the the real
[56:44] enemy is allowed to just overwhelm them
[56:47] and overpower them but may we each and
[56:49] every one by the revelation of the
[56:51] Spirit begin to recognize our enemy and
[56:54] turn the weapons that you have given us
[56:57] your word your blood your name may we
[57:01] turn those weapons against the one true
